https://openalex.org/W2084379296,"The endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) modulates cardiac myocyte function and is expressed in the particulate subcellular fraction. We have previously shown that eNOS is targeted to plasmalemmal caveolae in endothelial cells. Caveolae, specialized domains of the plasma membrane, may serve to sequester signaling proteins; a family of transmembrane proteins, the caveolins, form a key structural component of these microdomains. Caveolae in cardiac tissues contain the muscle-specific isoform caveolin-3, and caveolae in endothelial cells contain the widely expressed isoform caveolin-1, which shares limited sequence identity with caveolin-3. Our immunohistochemical analyses of rat cardiac muscle used isoform-specific caveolin antibodies to reveal prominent caveolin-3 staining in myocyte sarcolemmal membranes and at intercalated discs, whereas caveolin-1 staining was prominent in the vascular endothelium. Caveolin or eNOS antibodies were utilized to immunoprecipitate cardiac myocyte or cultured aortic endothelial cell lysates, which then were analyzed in immunoblots. In endothelial cells, we found that eNOS is quantitatively immunoprecipitated by antibodies to caveolin-1. In cardiac myocyte lysates, nearly all the eNOS is immunoprecipitated instead by antibodies to caveolin-3 and, conversely, eNOS antiserum immunoprecipitated primarily caveolin-3. These studies establish expression of eNOS in cardiac myocyte caveolae and document tissue-specific and quantitative associations of eNOS with caveolin. These findings may have important implications for the regulation of eNOS by caveolin isoforms and by other signaling proteins targeted to caveolae.

https://openalex.org/W1973770464,"Rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) is a structurally complex pectic polysaccharide present in the walls of growing plant cells. We now report that RG-II, released by endopolygalacturonase treatment of the walls of suspension-cultured sycamore cells and etiolated pea stems, exists mainly as a dimer that is cross-linked by a borate ester. The borate ester is completely hydrolyzed at room temperature within 30 min at pH 1, partially hydrolyzed between pH 2 and 4, and stable above pH 4. The dimer is formed in vitro between pH 2.4 and 6.2 by treating monomeric RG-II (0.5 mM) with boric acid (1.2 mM); the dimer formed after 24 h at pH 3.4 and 5.0 accounts for ~30 and ~5%, respectively, of the RG-II. In contrast, the dimer accounts for ~80 and ~54% of the RG-II when the monomer is treated for 24 h at pH 3.4 and 5.0, respectively, with boric acid and 0.5 mM Sr2+, Pb2+, or Ba2+. The amount of dimer formed at pH 3.4 or 5.0 is not increased by addition of 0.5 mM Ca2+, Cd2+, Cu2+, Mg2+, Ni2+, and Zn2+. Steric considerations appear to regulate dimer formation since those divalent cations that enhance dimer formation have an ionic radius >1.1 Å. Our data suggest that the borate ester is located on C-2 and C-3 of two of the four 3′-linked apiosyl residues of dimeric RG-II. Our results, taken together with the results of two previous studies (Kobayashi, M., Matoh, T., and Azuma, J.-I. (1996) Plant Physiol. 110, 1017-1020; Ishii, T., and Matsunaga, T. (1996) Carbohydr.

Although βA4 1-40 is the major form produced by cell metabolism and found in CSF, recent observations suggest that the long-tailed βA4 1-42 plays a more crucial role in AD pathogenesis. Here, we established new monoclonal antibodies against the C-terminal end of βA4 1-40 and 1-42, and used them for the specific Western blot detection. After optimizing the assay conditions, these antibodies detected low picogram amount of βA4, and both βA4 1-40 and 1-42 levels in CSF could be determined by direct loading of the samples. Blood levels of βA4 1-40 and 1-42 were also determined by specific immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot detection. We found that CSF βA4 1-42 level is lower in AD patients compared with non-demented controls, although there was a significant overlap between the groups. The level of βA4 1-40 in CSF, and of βA4 1-40 as well as βA4 1-42 in plasma, were not different between AD patients and controls. Besides the 4-kDa full-length βA4 band, we could also detect several N-terminal variants of βA4 in CSF and plasma of both AD patients and controls. Two N-terminally truncated βA4 species migrating at the position of 3.3 and 3.7 kDa were found in CSF, while 3.7- and 5-kDa forms were found in plasma.

https://openalex.org/W2002079983,"Treatment of SKBr3 human breast carcinoma cells with the benzoquinoid ansamycin, geldanamycin, rapidly depletes p185<sup>c-erbB-2</sup> protein-tyrosine kinase. Loss of p185<sup>c-erbB-2</sup> is initiated by disruption of a heteromeric complex between p185<sup>c-erbB-2</sup> and the 94-kDa glucose-regulated protein, GRP94, to which geldanamycin binds avidly. Here we report that within minutes of exposure to geldanamycin, mature p185<sup>c-erbB-2</sup> becomes polyubiquitinated. Treatment of cells with the specific proteasome proteolytic inhibitor, lactacystin, blocked geldanamycin-induced degradation of p185<sup>c-erbB-2</sup> and enhanced the accumulation of polyubiquitinated p185<sup>c-erbB-2</sup>. Following geldanamycin and lactacystin treatment, a higher molecular weight form of p185<sup>c-erbB-2</sup>, which likely represents ubiquitin-p185<sup>c-erbB-2</sup> conjugates, was detected by anti-p185<sup>c-erbB-2</sup> immunoblotting. Nascent p185<sup>c-erbB-2</sup> synthesized in the presence of geldanamycin is incompletely glycosylated and remains sequestered in the endoplasmic reticulum. While this immature form of the protein is not ubiquitinated in the presence of geldanamycin, its marked, drug-induced instability is nonetheless antagonized by lactacystin. Thus, the rapid depletion of mature p185<sup>c-erbB-2</sup> caused by geldanamycin and the marked, drug-stimulated decrease in half-life of the newly synthesized protein are both mediated by the proteasome, although only the former phenomenon involves polyubiquitination."
https://openalex.org/W2058757351,"Degradation of proteins that are retained in the quality control apparatus of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) has been attributed to a third proteolytic system, distinct from the lysosomal and the cytoplasmic ubiquitin-dependent proteosomal proteolytic pathways. However, several recent studies have shown that ER degradation of a mutant membrane protein, CFTRΔF508, is at least in part mediated from the cytoplasmic side by the 26 S proteasome. In this study, we examined the possibility that ER degradation of mutant secretory protein α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT) Z, the mutant protein associated with infantile liver disease and adult-onset emphysema of α1-AT deficiency, is mediated by the proteasome. The results show that a specific proteasome inhibitor, lactacystin, inhibits ER degradation of α1-ATZ in transfected human fibroblast cell lines and in a cell-free microsomal translocation system. Although it is relatively easy to conceptualize how a transmembrane protein like CFTRΔF508 might be accessible on the cytoplasmic aspect of the ER membrane for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome, it is more difficult to conceptualize how this might occur for a luminal polypeptide. The results show that, once within the lumen of the ER, α1-ATZ interacts with the transmembrane molecular chaperone calnexin and specifically induces the polyubiquitination of calnexin. The results, therefore, provide evidence that the proteasome, from its cytoplasmic localization, induces the degradation of the luminal α1-ATZ molecule by first attacking the cytoplasmic tail of calnexin molecules that are associated with α1-ATZ.

J. Clin. Invest. 1986; 78: 1427-1431Google Scholar). A subgroup of individuals with this deficiency also develop chronic liver injury and hepatocellular carcinoma (2Perlmutter D.H. Ockner R.K. Boyer J. Progress in Liver Disease. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1993: 139Google Scholar). In fact, it is the most common genetic cause of liver disease in children. Although lung injury is due to the decrease in elastase inhibitory capacity ordinarily provided by α1-AT, liver injury is due to the hepatotoxic effect of the abnormally folded α1-ATZ molecule (Glu342 to Lys) that is retained in the ER (2Perlmutter D.H. Ockner R.K. Boyer J. Progress in Liver Disease. W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia1993: 139Google Scholar). Recently, we found that most α1-AT-deficient individuals are “protected” from liver injury because of relatively efficient degradation of α1-ATZ in the ER (“protected hosts”), whereas in a subgroup of α1-AT-deficient individuals affected by severe liver disease (“susceptible hosts”), there is a lag in ER degradation of α1-ATZ (3Wu Y. Whitman I.P. Molmenti E.P. Moore K. Hippenmeyer P. Perlmutter D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9014-9018Google Scholar). This results in greater net retention of hepatotoxic α1-ATZ within the ER. In one susceptible host, the lag in ER degradation of α1-ATZ is associated with a failure to interact with the ER molecular chaperone calnexin, raising the possibility that this interaction is necessary for entry into the degradative pathway (3Wu Y. Whitman I.P. Molmenti E.P. Moore K. Hippenmeyer P. Perlmutter D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9014-9018Google Scholar). Examination of the biochemical characteristics of relatively efficient ER degradation of α1-ATZ in protected hosts (3Wu Y. Whitman I.P. Molmenti E.P. Moore K. Hippenmeyer P. Perlmutter D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9014-9018Google Scholar) suggests similarities with those described for other proteins that are retained/degraded in ER, including, for example, T-cell receptor α subunit, asialoglycoprotein receptor H2a subunit, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase and CFTRΔF508 (4Lippincott-Schwartz J.

Because recent studies have indicated that ER degradation of CFTRΔF508 is at least in part mediated by the proteasome (8Ward C.L. Omura S. Kopito R.R.

Antibody to ubiquitin was purchased from Sigma. Preparation of lactacystin has been described previously (10Omura S. Fujimoto T. Otoguro K. et al.J. Antibiotics. 1991; 44: 113-116Google Scholar). All other chemical products were purchased from Sigma. Fibroblast cell lines which had been transduced with amphotrophic recombinant retroviral particles bearing α1-ATZ cDNA have been described previously (3Wu Y. Whitman I.P. Molmenti E.P. Moore K.

Cell lines were subjected to pulse-chase radiolabeling. For the pulse period, the cells were incubated at 37°C for 2 h in Tran35S-label 250 µCi/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking methionine. The cells were then rinsed rigorously and incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with excess unlabeled methionine for time intervals up to 10 h as the chase period. At the end of each chase period, the extracellular medium was harvested and the cells lysed in phosphate-buffered saline, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 10 mM EDTA, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The radiolabeled cell lysates were subjected to clarification, immunoprecipitation, and immunoprecipitates analyzed by SDS-PAGE/fluorography exactly as described previously (3Wu Y. Whitman I.P.

Chem. 1996; 271: 13215-13220Google Scholar). Aliquots of the radiolabeled cell lysates were also subjected to trichloroacetic acid precipitation and scintillation counting of the trichloroacetic acid precipitates to ensure that there was equivalent incorporation between cell lines under comparison (3Wu Y.

Results were quantified by densitometric scanning of fluorograms on a laser densitometer (2222 ultrascan XL, LKB Instruments, Inc., Houston, TX), and quantification is reported as mean ± one standard deviation. The pGEM-4Z vector (Promega, Inc.) containing either α1-ATM cDNA or α1-ATZ cDNA was linearized beyond the 3′ end of the cDNA using HindIII. SP6 RNA polymerase was used for in vitro transcription in the presence of m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G to generate 7mG-capped mRNAs following the protocol provided by Promega. α1-ATM and α1-ATZ polypeptides were synthesized in the reticulocyte lysate cell-free system according to the protocol in the Promega technical manual. The cell-free reaction mixture (50 µl) contained 35 µl of micrococcal nuclease-treated rabbit reticulocyte lysate supplemented with the following final concentrations of additional components: 20 µM of 19-amino acid mixture minus methionine, 0.8 µ/µl of RNase inhibitor RNasin, 0.8 µCi/µl of [35S]methionine, 4 A260/ml of canine pancreas microsomal vesicles, and 20 µg/ml of the appropriate mRNAs. The cell-free translation and translocation assay was performed for 1 h at 30°C. Where indicated, endoglycosidase H (Endo H) digestion of cell-free translated products was carried out as described previously (3Wu Y. Whitman I.P. Molmenti E.P. Moore K. Hippenmeyer P. Perlmutter D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9014-9018Google Scholar). In addition, where indicated, proteinase K digestion of cell-free translated products was performed as described (12Nicchitta C.V. Blobel G. Cell. 1993; 73: 989-998Google Scholar). The products were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and visualized by fluorography. After the translation reaction, the microsomal vesicles that contained either α1-ATM or α1-ATZ polypeptide were isolated by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4°C. The pelleted microsomal vesicles were resuspended in fresh proteolysis primed lysate contained in a final volume of 50 µl: 40 mM Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 0.5 mM ATP, 10 mM phosphocreatine, 1600 µg/ml creatine phosphokinase, and fresh reticulocyte lysate, according to Ref. 13Bercovich Z. Rosenberg-Hasson Y. Ciechanover A. Kahana C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15949-15952Google Scholar, and incubated at 37°C for the indicated time intervals. Canine pancreatic microsomal vesicles were incubated at 22°C for 30 min in the presence of DTT or GSSG in several different concentrations (our cell-free translocation/pulse-chase assay is done in 2 mM DTT). The vesicles were then subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with anti-calnexin antibody. The blot was developed with the ECL system (Amersham Corp.). First, we examined the effect of a specific, irreversible inhibitor of the proteasome, lactacystin (14Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Google Scholar), on degradation of α1-ATZ in fibroblast cell lines from protected hosts that had been transduced with the α1-ATZ gene. The α1-ATZ polypeptide is retained in the ER of these cells as a 52-kDa Endo H-sensitive glycosylated polypeptide, but is then degraded in a relatively efficient manner (11Teckman J. Perlmutter D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13215-13220Google Scholar). Our previous studies had shown that degradation of α1-ATZ in these cell lines was inhibited by several synthetic protease inhibitors known to inhibit the proteasome, albeit in a relatively less specific manner (3Wu Y. Whitman I.P. Molmenti E.P. Moore K. Hippenmeyer P. Perlmutter D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9014-9018Google Scholar). These cell lines were preincubated for 2 h in the absence or presence of 10 µM lactacystin and then subjected to biosynthetic radiolabeling in a pulse-chase experiment. The results were analyzed by immunoprecipitation and the immunoprecipitates subjected to SDS-PAGE/fluorography (Fig. 1a). In the absence of lactacystin, α1-ATZ progressively decays over 2 h and completely disappears between 2 and 4 h of the chase period. In the presence of lactacystin, the α1-ATZ polypeptide disappears only minimally over the entire 10-h chase period. In Fig. 1b, we examined the effect of lactacystin on degradation of α1-ATZ in another protected cell line. Again, lactacystin mediated a marked decrease in rate of α1-ATZ degradation. In this cell line, a slightly faster migrating ~50-kDa polypeptide was retained in the presence of lactacystin. The immunoprecipitation of this polypeptide was completely blocked by unlabeled purified α1-AT (data not shown), indicating that it is an α1-ATZ intermediate. At ~50 kDa, this cannot be an underglycosylated or deglycosylated form of α1-ATZ (46 kDa) and therefore probably represents an endoproteolytic intermediate. Nevertheless, its biochemical nature is as yet unknown. Lactacystin inhibited the rate of degradation of α1-ATZ in five separate experiments in three different cell lines (data not shown). The t1/2 for degradation of α1-ATZ was 1.75 and 5.25 h in the absence and presence of lactacystin, respectively. In order to further characterize the degradation of α1-ATZ, we examined the possibility that it could be recapitulated in a cell-free microsomal translocation system. α1-AT wild type (M) and α1-ATZ mRNAs were generated by in vitro transcription and used to program a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system supplemented with canine pancreatic microsomal membranes. After 1 h in the translation reaction mixture supplemented with [35S]Met, the microsomal vesicles were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in fresh proteolysis-primed lysate containing ATP, an ATP regenerating system in the absence of [35S]Met, but using the conditions which have been described for many studies of the ubiquitin-dependent proteosomal system (13Bercovich Z. Rosenberg-Hasson Y. Ciechanover A. Kahana C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 15949-15952Google Scholar). After several different time intervals, aliquots were homogenized and subjected to SDS-PAGE/fluorography analysis (Fig. 2a). The results show that a 52-kDa radiolabeled polypeptide is generated from both α1-ATM and α1-ATZ mRNA. This polypeptide corresponds to α1-AT that has acquired high-mannose carbohydrate side chains. In the case of α1-ATM, there are two distinct cleavages during the 16-h chase period, but no significant disappearance of total radiolabeled α1-AT. The mechanism for the two cleavages is not known, but presumably involves luminal endoproteolytic activity. There was also no significant disappearance over 16 h for several different polypeptides that were translocated into the lumen in the cell-free microsomal translocation system using the exact same “pulse-chase” protocol but programming it with mRNA from normal adult human liver (data not shown). For α1-ATZ, there is very little of the two cleavages, but there is progressive disappearance of the α1-AT molecule beginning within 1 h and complete disappearance between 2 and 4 h of the chase period. There is some variability from experiment to experiment in the pattern of disappearance of α1-ATZ during the first three time points, but it is always completely degraded by 4 h of the chase period. The t1/2 for degradation of α1-ATZ in five experiments shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3 is 1.12 ± 0.58 h. Taken together, the data indicate that the α1-ATZ molecule is degraded in microsomal vesicles in a highly specific manner. Moreover, the data show that α1-ATZ degradation can be characterized in the cell-free system. For instance, we could examine the effect of ATP on α1-ATZ degradation in this system. When chased in the absence of ATP (Fig. 2b) or in the presence of ATPγS (Fig. 2c), there is minimal, if any, degradation of α1-ATZ during the chase period. In addition, when chased in the absence of proteolysis-primed lysate, there is no degradation of α1-ATZ (data not shown). Thus, degradation of α1-ATZ is dependent on ATP and on the constituents of the proteolysis-primed lysate.Fig. 3Effect of Endo H (a) and proteinase K (b) and centrifugation (c) on α1-ATZ generated in the cell-free system. a, α1-ATZ mRNA was translated in a reticulocyte lysate supplemented with canine pancreatic microsomal vesicles. After translation, the vesicles were harvested by centrifugation and extracted with SDS. The extracts were incubated overnight at 37°C in the absence (-) or presence (+) of 1 milliunit of Endo H. The products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/fluorography. b, α1-ATZ mRNA was translated in a reticulocyte lysate supplemented with canine pancreatic microsomal vesicles. After translation, the vesicles were harvested by centrifugation. The pellets were resuspended in 50 µl of proteolysis primed lysate. One aliquot was harvested at the end of the translation period (Pulse) and another was harvested after 2 h of the chase period (Chase). For both aliquots, the vesicles were subjected to proteinase K digestion for 30 min in the presence (+) or absence (-) of Triton X-100. The products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/fluorography. c, α1-ATZ mRNA was subjected to the same cell-free translation/translocation and pulse-chase protocol with chase time intervals of 0, 1, and 3 h. At the end of each time interval, the vesicles were pelleted by centrifugation. Supernatant (S) and pelleted vesicles (P) were separately subjected to SDS-PAGE/fluorography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Next, we examined the effect of lactacystin in the cell-free system (Fig. 2d). The results show that lactacystin markedly inhibits degradation of α1-ATZ in this system. To ensure that lactacystin was in fact inhibiting proteasomal activity, we added 125I-lysozyme, a known substrate for the proteasome (15Orian A. Whiteside S. Israel A. Stancovski I. Schwartz A.L. Ciechanover A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21707-21714Google Scholar), to the proteolysis-primed lysate in the absence or presence of 20 µM lactacystin. The results showed that there was time-dependent appearance of trichloroacetic acid-soluble radioactivity in the absence of lactacystin, but markedly inhibited in the presence of lactacystin (data not shown). Taken together, these data provide evidence that ER degradation of α1-ATZ has the characteristics of proteolysis mediated by the 26 S proteasome and provide evidence for the novel use of a cell-free microsomal translocation system to characterize the kinetics of degradation of secretory proteins. Although it is relatively easy to conceptualize how a transmembrane protein like CFTRΔF508 might be accessible on the cytoplasmic aspect of the ER membrane for ubiquitination and degradation by the 26 S proteasome, it is more difficult to conceptualize how this might occur for a luminal polypeptide. Several results militate against the possibility that α1-ATZ is somehow exposed on the external surface of the microsomes in the cell-free system. First, the α1-ATZ being degraded in Fig. 2 is glycosylated. This is proven by its susceptibility to Endo H as shown in Fig. 3a. After Endo H digestion, α1-ATZ migrates to approximately 46 kDa, a mobility that corresponds to the nascent α1-AT polypeptide after its signal peptide has been cleaved. Second, the 52-kDa α1-ATZ polypeptide that is being degraded in the cell-free system is protected from proteinase K (Fig. 3b) added at the end of the pulse period (left) or at the end of the 2-h chase period (right). In each case, proteinase K by itself has no effect, even though it can completely degrade α1-ATZ if it is added together with Triton X-100 that homogenizes the microsomal membranes. In order to exclude the possibility that a portion of the newly synthesized and glycosylated α1-ATZ is pumped out of the microsomal vesicles, we separately analyzed the supernatant and pelleted vesicles at the end of each chase time point (Fig. 3c). There was no evidence that the 52-kDa α1-ATZ polypeptide ever reached the supernatant in this experiment, in experiments in which ATPγS and lactacystin were used to inhibit degradation (data not shown), or in experiments in which ATP was added to stimulate any possible transport activity (data not shown). One possible explanation is that the proteasome attacks the cytoplasmic tail of a transmembrane ER protein to which α1-ATZ has bound. Because our previous studies had shown that α1-ATZ interacts with one such protein, calnexin (3Wu Y. Whitman I.P. Molmenti E.P. Moore K. Hippenmeyer P. Perlmutter D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9014-9018Google Scholar), we examined the possibility that α1-ATZ must interact with calnexin to be degraded by the proteasome. First, we examined the relative electrophoretic mobility of endogenous calnexin in the canine pancreatic microsomal vesicles under the conditions used for the cell free translocation/pulse-chase assay. Several recent studies (16Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Google Scholar, 17Ou W.J. Bergeron J.J. Li Y. Kang C.Y. Thomas D.Y. J Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 18051-18059Google Scholar, 18Tector M. Salter R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19638-19642Google Scholar) have shown that calnexin is inactive as a chaperone if it is reduced by DTT and that this reduced state can be detected in SDS-PAGE under nonreducing conditions by a shift to a slower electrophoretic mobility. Western blot analysis showed that, under the conditions of our assay, calnexin migrated to an electrophoretic mobility that was consistent with the nonreduced, active state. Addition of GSSG to a concentration of 10 mM did not change its migration, but addition of DTT to increase the concentration from the 2 mM, used for our assays, to 5 mM resulted in a shift to a slower electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 4a) identical to that recently described by Hebert et al. (16Hebert D.N. Foellmer B. Helenius A. Cell. 1995; 81: 425-433Google Scholar), Ou et al. (17Ou W.J. Bergeron J.J. Li Y. Kang C.Y. Thomas D.Y.

Next, we examined the possibility that α1-ATZ forms a stable complex with calnexin in the cell-free system. Microsomes which had translocated α1-ATM or α1-ATZ in the absence or presence of castanospermine were homogenized under nondenaturing conditions (2% CHAPS), subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-α1-AT antibody, and then immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-calnexin antibody (Fig. 4b). In the presence of castanospermine (CST), an inhibitor of glucosidase I and II, glycoproteins are not converted to the monoglucosylated intermediate that is necessary for interaction with calnexin (19Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc Natl Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Google Scholar, 20Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Google Scholar). The results show that calnexin is coprecipitated in microsomes that had translocated α1-ATZ. A band corresponding to coprecipitated calnexin is faint, if present at all, in microsomes which had translocated wild type α1-ATM and in microsomes that had translocated α1-ATZ in the presence of CST. Next, we examined the effect of CST on the kinetics of degradation of α1-ATZ in the cell-free system (Fig. 4c). The results show that preincubation of the cell-free system with CST alters the electrophoretic mobility of α1-ATZ as expected and inhibits its degradation. The effect of CST is dose-dependent and sustained for 4 h of the chase period (Fig. 4c, right panel). We also examined the effect of inhibiting glycosylation with the glyco-acceptor peptide NYT on the kinetics of degradation of α1-ATZ in the cell-free system (Fig. 4d). In this experiment, we used a preparation of microsomal vesicles that were less efficient in glycosylation as evidenced by the presence of two α1-ATZ polypeptides, the nascent 46-kDa polypeptide, and the glycosylated 52-kDa polypeptide (left panel). In the absence of NYT, the 52-kDa polypeptide disappears between 1 and 4 h of the chase period, but the 46-kDa nascent polypeptide does not significantly disappear throughout the entire chase period (left panel). In the presence of NYT, there is only a 46-kDa nascent polypeptide that does not undergo degradation during the chase period. These data provide further evidence that glycosylation, which is required for interaction with calnexin, is also required for degradation. If the proteasome actually degrades the α1-ATZ-calnexin complex, one would predict that this complex is ubiquitinated. In order to examine this prediction, microsomes that had translocated α1-ATM or α1-ATZ were homogenized under denaturing conditions (Triton X-100), subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibody to ubiquitin, and then the immunoprecipitates analyzed by Western blot analysis with anti-calnexin antibody (Fig. 4e). The results show a ladder of bands migrating slower than native calnexin, only in the microsomes that had translocated α1-ATZ, indicating that multiple ubiquitin molecules have been conjugated to calnexin. No ubiquitinated calnexin was detected in the corresponding reaction with α1-ATM. Separate aliquots of the immunoprecipitates were subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-α1-AT (right panel), but no polyubiquitinated polypeptides could be detected. These data show that translocation of α1-ATZ into the lumen of the microsome and interaction with the resident ER membrane protein calnexin specifically induces the ubiquitination of calnexin and converts a small cohort of endogenous calnexin molecules into substrates for the proteasome. The results also show that ubiquitin is not conjugated to α1-ATZ. If the proteasome recognizes α1-ATZ-polyubiquitinated calnexin as a substrate, one would also predict that an α1-ATZ-calnexin-ubiquitin conjugate exists. In order to address this issue (Fig. 4f), we did the same experiment shown in Fig. 4e, but with several critical modifications: the chase after translation/translocation was done in the presence of ATPγS and ubiquitin to trap ubiquitin conjugates; microsomes were homogenized under nondenaturing conditions (2% CHAPS); the aliquots were first immunoprecipitated with anti-α1-AT and then subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-ubiquitin (left) and anti-calnexin (right) antibodies. The results show the exact same multi-ubiquitinated ladder as was seen in Fig. 4e. The ladder migrates slower than native calnexin (~90 kDa), is seen in vesicles that have translocated α1-ATZ, but not in those which have translocated α1-ATM, and is recognized by both anti-ubiquitin and anti-calnexin antibodies. This demonstrates the existence of a complex between α1-ATZ and multi-ubiquitinated calnexin. There is also a band at ~60 kDa in each case. We do not know the nature of this band but wonder if it is an α1-ATZ-ubiquitinated calnexin degradation intermediate. Several previous studies have shown that calnexin facilitates the folding and assembly of single-chain and multi-chain membrane and secretory proteins (21Ou W.J. Cameron P.H. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J.M. Nature. 1993; 364: 771-776Google Scholar, 22Hochstenbach F. David V. Watkins J. Brenner M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4734-4738Google Scholar, 23Jackson M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Petersen P.A. Williams D. Science. 1994; 263: 384-387Google Scholar, 24Bergeron J.J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 124-128Google Scholar). The current study shows that calnexin also plays a key role in facilitating the degradation of ligands that cannot fold/assemble productively, as exemplified by a naturally occurring mutant secretory protein. Our data cannot, however, exclude the possibility that α1-ATZ interacts with other transmembrane proteins of the ER and that such, as yet unidentified, interactions can account for part of its degradation. We do not yet know exactly how the entire α1-ATZ-calnexin complex, including the luminal domain of calnexin associated with α1-ATZ, is degraded. The proteasome may initiate a process that is completed by other enzymes within the ER membrane or within the ER lumen. Raposo et al. (25Raposo G. van Santen H.M. Leijendekker R. Geuze H. Ploegh H.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1403-1419Google Scholar) have recently described an electron-dense compartment derived from ER that may be specialized for ubiquitin-dependent proteosomal degradation. Perhaps, the α1-ATZ-calnexin complex is localized to this subcompartment of the ER during its degradation. A recent study by McCracken and Brodsky (26McCracken A.A. Brodsky J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 291-298Google Scholar) has shown that the degradation of unglycosylated pro-α factor in the ER of yeast depends on cytosol, calnexin, and ATP. In this case, the glycosylated form of the polypeptide is not a substrate for ER degradation, and there is evidence that the unglycosylated pro-α factor is transported out of the microsomal vesicles into the cytosol for degradation by an ATP-dependent proteolytic system. We could find no evidence that the unglycosylated form of α1-ATZ is a substrate for ER degradation (Fig. 4d), and no evidence that the 52-kDa glycosylated α1-ATZ polypeptide that is degraded in the cell-free system is ever outside the microsomal vesicles (Fig. 3c). We cannot yet exclude the possibility that the α1-ATZ polypeptide is rapidly exchanged across the microsomal membrane, but it is more likely that the difference in the two studies reflect differences in yeast as compared with mammalian microsomal translocation or differences in the substrates pro-α factor and α1-ATZ. The current study also has important implications for the mechanism by which a subgroup of α1-AT-deficient individuals develop severe liver disease and for potential therapeutic interventions for these individuals. We have shown recently that there is a lag in ER degradation of α1-ATZ in these “susceptible hosts” and have predicted that there will be several distinct mechanisms for this lag in ER degradation among the susceptible host subpopulation. In one susceptible host, the retained α1-ATZ interacts poorly with calnexin (3Wu Y. Whitman I.P. Molmenti E.P. Moore K. Hippenmeyer P. Perlmutter D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9014-9018Google Scholar). In the liver cells of this host, there is likely to be only a very little polyubiquitinated calnexin-α1-ATZ complex that can be recognized for proteolysis by the proteasome. In several other susceptible hosts, the retained α1-ATZ interacts well with calnexin, but is only slowly degraded. 2J. H. Teckman, D. Qu, and D. H. Perlmutter, unpublished observation. These hosts may have a defect in calnexin that prevents its ubiquitination or may have a defect in ubiquitination or in proteasomal activity. These latter hosts would also be more likely to respond to a pharmacological agent, such as interferon-γ (27Gaczynska M. Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 264-267Google Scholar), that enhances the activity of the ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal system. We are indebted to Dr. Aaron Ciechanover for advice; to Drs. A. L. Schwartz, S. Kornfeld, and H. R. Colten for reviewing the manuscript; to Joyce L. Williams for preparing it; and to Dr. Dennis Shields for providing canine pancreatic microsomal membranes."

INTRODUCTIONThere is considerable interest in the regulation of homocysteine (Hcy) 1The abbreviations used are: HcyhomocysteineBHMTbetaine-homocysteine methyltransferaseDMATdimethylacetothetinMSmethionine synthase (vitamin B12-dependent)pHcyplasma total homocyst(e)ine, denoting oxidized and reduced formsPCRpolymerase chain reactionTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. metabolism since even moderate elevations in plasma total homocyst(e)ine (pHcy) have been established as an independent risk factor for the development of arteriosclerotic vascular disease (1Motulsky A.G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 17-20Google Scholar). The enzyme betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT; EC) may have an important role in the modulation of pHcy. BHMT is a cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of betaine and Hcy to dimethylglycine and methionine, respectively (2McKeever M.P. Weir D.G. Molloy A. Scott J.M. Clin. Sci. 1991; 81: 551-556Google Scholar). This reaction also is required for the irreversible oxidation of choline. The only other enzyme known to methylate Hcy in mammalian cells is the folate/vitamin B12-dependent methionine synthase (MS; EC).Large oral doses of betaine have been shown to be an effective treatment for homocystinuria due to deficiencies of cystathionine β-synthase (EC) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (EC) and inborn errors of cobalamin metabolism (3Kang S-S. Wong P.W.K. Malinow M.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1992; 12: 279-298Google Scholar, 4Ueland P.M. Refsum H. Brattstrom L. Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease, Hemostasis, and Endothelial Function. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1992Google Scholar). The level of pHcy in these individuals decreases significantly with betaine treatment, and the incidence of thromboembolism is significantly reduced. The efficacy of betaine treatment is due, at least in part, to increased methylation of Hcy by the BHMT-catalyzed reaction. Betaine treatment, however, usually does not lower pHcy levels to within the normal range, and the moderately elevated levels that remain are highly correlated with vascular disease. BHMT is therefore a target for the treatment of homocystinuria in that better methyl donors may have more potent pHcy-lowering effects. Furthermore, BHMT activity has been shown to vary with dietary and hormonal treatments in rats (5Finkelstein J.D. Kyle W.E. Harris B.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 146: 84-92Google Scholar, 6Finkelstein J.D. Harris B.J. Martin J.J. Kyle W.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 108: 344-348Google Scholar, 7Finkelstein J.D. Martin J.J. Harris B.J. Kyle W.E. J. Nutr. 1983; 113: 519-521Google Scholar) and dietary treatments in chickens. 2J. L. Emmert, T. A. Garrow, and D. H. Baker, submitted for publication. Manipulations of these parameters could improve current therapies for some forms of homocystinuria.A genetic defect in BHMT could result in hyperhomocyst(e)inemia, and perhaps homocystinuria, since it has been reported that this enzyme is responsible for up to 50% of the Hcy methylation capacity in liver (8Finkelstein J.D. Martin J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9508-9513Google Scholar). This possibility has been difficult to determine, since fibroblasts and lymphocytes, tissues normally assayed to detect enzyme defects, do not express BHMT activity (9Wang J. Dudman N.P.D. Lynch J.F. Wilcken D.E.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1991; 204: 239-243Google Scholar). The lack of a cDNA encoding BHMT has precluded investigations into the molecular mechanisms responsible for dietary and hormonally induced changes in BHMT activity. A human cDNA encoding BHMT would aid in the search for defects in its gene.This report describes the purification and kinetic constants of porcine liver BHMT as well as the molecular cloning of a partial porcine cDNA and a near full-length human cDNA encoding this enzyme. A fusion construct of the human cDNA results in BHMT activity in Escherichia coli extracts, an activity absent from wild type bacteria. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of human BHMT with that of E. coli MS indicates regions that may be involved in Hcy binding and catalysis of methyl transfer.DISCUSSIONBHMT is found primarily in the liver and kidney of mammals (2McKeever M.P. Weir D.G. Molloy A. Scott J.M. Clin. Sci. 1991; 81: 551-556Google Scholar, 5Finkelstein J.D. Kyle W.E. Harris B.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 146: 84-92Google Scholar, 24Maw G.A. Biochem. J. 1959; 72: 602-608Google Scholar, 25Ericson L.E. Acta Chem. Scand. 1960; 14: 2101-2112Google Scholar), and it has been purified to homogeneity from rat (26Fromm H.J. Nordlie R.C. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 81: 363-376Google Scholar, 27Lee K- Cava M. Amiri P. Ottoboni T. Lindquist R.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 77-86Google Scholar), horse (28Durell J. Anderson D.G. Cantoni G.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 26: 270-282Google Scholar), and human (29Skiba W.E. Taylor M.P. Wells M.S. Mangum J.H. Awad Jr., W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14944-14948Google Scholar) liver. A preparation of the enzyme from porcine liver has been reported that was estimated to be 90% pure (30Ericson L.E. Acta Chem. Scand. 1960; 14: 2113-2126Google Scholar). These reports consistently show that liver expresses very high levels of this enzyme, ranging from 0.6 to 1.6% of the total soluble protein in crude extracts, and that the enzyme is a hexamer of identical subunits of Mr 45,000.The porcine liver BHMT purification reported here enriched activity 47-fold, with a final yield of 16%. The preparation was judged to be homogenous after sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis yielding a single band of Mr 45,000 (Fig. 1). The enrichment required to obtain homogenous enzyme varied from 47- to 98-fold. The low specific activity of the purified enzyme is similar to that reported for rat (27Lee K- Cava M. Amiri P. Ottoboni T. Lindquist R.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 77-86Google Scholar) and human (29Skiba W.E. Taylor M.P. Wells M.S. Mangum J.H. Awad Jr., W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14944-14948Google Scholar) liver BHMT. The specific activity of purified BHMT is also similar to that of E. coli vitamin B12-independent methionine synthase (EC 2.1.1), another transferase that translocates a nitrogen-bound methyl group to Hcy (31Whitfield C.D. Steers Jr., E.J. Weissbach H. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 390-401Google Scholar).The Km estimates for betaine and L-Hcy are similar in magnitude to previous reports on the rat and human enzymes (19Finkelstein J.D. Harris B.J. Kyle W.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 153: 320-324Google Scholar, 27Lee K- Cava M. Amiri P. Ottoboni T. Lindquist R.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 77-86Google Scholar, 29Skiba W.E. Taylor M.P. Wells M.S. Mangum J.H. Awad Jr., W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14944-14948Google Scholar). The Km estimate for L-Hcy should be considered a maximum estimate. Although dithiothreitol was used to slow the oxidation of Hcy, no effort was made to correct for loss of substrate due to disulfide formation. Furthermore, the hydroxide-dependent conversion of Hcy thiolactone to Hcy is not quantitative (14Duerre J.A. Miller C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1966; 17: 310-315Google Scholar).The level of Hcy in rat and mouse liver is approximately 4 µM (32Ueland P.M. Helland S. Broch O.J. Schanche J-S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2360-2364Google Scholar); therefore, it is likely that liver Hcy levels are lower than the Km of Hcy for BHMT. As with Hcy, the intracellular concentration of betaine has been determined only for the rodent (7Finkelstein J.D. Martin J.J. Harris B.J. Kyle W.E. J. Nutr. 1983; 113: 519-521Google Scholar, 33Barak A.J. Tuma D.J. Lipids. 1979; 14: 860-863Google Scholar, 34Martin J.J. Finkelstein J.D. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 111: 72-76Google Scholar, 35Finkelstein J.D. Martin J.J. Harris B.J. Kyle W.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1982; 218: 169-173Google Scholar, 36Mar M-H.H. Ridky T.W. Garner S.C. Zeisel S.H. J. Nutr. Biochem. 1995; 6: 392-398Google Scholar). The concentration has been shown to be dependent upon dietary choline and betaine and generally ranges from 1 to 10 µmol/g of liver. These levels are significantly higher than the Km of betaine for porcine BHMT (23 µM) and the Km of betaine reported for the rat and human enzymes (48 and 100 µM, respectively). These data indicate that rat liver BHMT is saturated with betaine, although this may not be true for all species. For example, choline oxidase, the first committed reaction for choline oxidation, is reportedly 17-60-fold higher in rat liver than human liver (37Sidransky H. Farber E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1960; 87: 129-133Google Scholar, 38Haubrich D.R. Gerber N.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1981; 30: 2993-3000Google Scholar); therefore, humans probably have significantly lower levels of hepatic betaine. The fact that choline or betaine treatment for homocystinuria lowers pHcy supports the idea that BHMT is not normally saturated with betaine in human liver.The higher Vmax obtained for the methylation of Hcy using DMAT relative to betaine is consistent with previous reports using the purified horse (28Durell J. Anderson D.G. Cantoni G.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 26: 270-282Google Scholar) and porcine (39Ericson L.E. Acta Chem. Scand. 1960; 14: 2127-2134Google Scholar) liver enzymes. These studies used saturating concentrations of both Hcy and methyl donor and measured methionine production by either colorimetric or microbiological assays. It was found that the methylation rate of Hcy using DMAT was 1-2 orders of magnitude greater than that observed using betaine. Comparison of the two substrates using crude rat liver preparations indicated that DMAT was 20 times more effective than betaine at stimulating the production of methionine (40Dubnoff J.W. Borsook H. J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 176: 789-796Google Scholar, 41Maw G.A. Biochem. J. 1956; 63: 116-124Google Scholar, 42Goeger D.E. Ganther H.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 222-227Google Scholar).Dimethylglycine has been reported to be a potent inhibitor of porcine (39Ericson L.E. Acta Chem. Scand. 1960; 14: 2127-2134Google Scholar), rat (19Finkelstein J.D. Harris B.J. Kyle W.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 153: 320-324Google Scholar), and human BHMT (29Skiba W.E. Taylor M.P. Wells M.S. Mangum J.H. Awad Jr., W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14944-14948Google Scholar, 43Allen R.H. Stabler S.P. Lindenbaum J. Metabolism. 1993; 42: 1448-1460Google Scholar), although a Ki has never been reported. This report compared the relative affinities of dimethylglycine, methylthioacetate, and sarcosine for porcine BHMT (Table IV). Methylthioacetate, the demethylated product of DMAT, has a lower affinity for BHMT than dimethylglycine. Sarcosine, an isostere of methylthioacetate, displays no affinity for the enzyme under the assay conditions used. The lower affinity methylthioacetate has for BHMT partly explains the higher Vmax of BHMT when DMAT is used instead of betaine as methyl donor, since the maximum velocity of the reaction is in part a function of the off rates of the products.Betaine is presently used as an effective treatment for vitamin-nonresponsive homocystinuria. This treatment significantly reduces pHcy and improves clinical prognosis. Two different mechanisms likely contribute to the pHcy-lowering effect of betaine. The first is the direct methylation of Hcy by the BHMT-catalyzed reaction. A second effect could be mediated by the subsequent oxidation of dimethylglycine to glycine, catalyzed by dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (EC) and sarcosine dehydrogenase (EC), respectively. These reactions introduce one carbon unit into the folate pool as N5,N10-methylenetetrahydrofolate. This anapleurotic effect could enhance the folate-dependent pathway of Hcy methylation in some forms of homocystinuria. Although the use of betaine in the treatment of homocystinuria elicits a pHcy-lowering response, Allen et al. (43Allen R.H. Stabler S.P. Lindenbaum J. Metabolism. 1993; 42: 1448-1460Google Scholar) have pointed out that this treatment usually does not lower pHcy to within the normal range (10-15 µM). The hyperhomocyst(e)inemia that persists, generally 30-80 µM, is significantly correlated with vascular disease.The inability of betaine treatment to normalize pHcy in homocystinurics is likely related to the kinetic properties of the BHMT reaction. It has been shown that concomitant with a decrease in pHcy during betaine treatment, there is also a dramatic increase in plasma (43Allen R.H. Stabler S.P. Lindenbaum J. Metabolism. 1993; 42: 1448-1460Google Scholar) and urinary (44Laryea M.D. Zab R. Ritgen J. Wendel U. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1994; 230: 169-175Google Scholar) betaine and dimethylglycine. Up to 37-fold increases in plasma dimethylglycine (250 µM) were observed in individuals receiving betaine for homocystinuria compared with a control population. These data indicate that the subsequent oxidation of dimethylglycine is insufficient and therefore accumulates in tissues. Kinetic studies using the purified porcine enzyme indicate that dimethylglycine inhibits BHMT activity uncompetitively when Hcy is varied at either subsaturating (25 µM) or saturating (250 µM) levels of betaine. It is likely that liver BHMT is inhibited by dimethylglycine in vivo.This report indicates that DMAT is a more specific substrate for BHMT than betaine and that the demethylated product of DMAT, methylthioacetate, has lower affinity for BHMT than dimethylglycine. DMAT may be useful for the treatment of homocystinuria. Early work initiated by Maw and Du Vigneaud (45Maw G.A. du Vigneaud V. J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 176: 1037-1045Google Scholar) indicated that DMAT can replace choline (or betaine) in rodent diets devoid of methionine but containing homocystine. DMAT supported growth and prevented fatty liver and renal hemorrhage. Methyl donor-deficient diets have been shown repeatedly to result in growth depression, fatty liver, and, when given to weaning animals, renal hemorrhage. The subsequent metabolic fate of methylthioacetate is not completely understood. However, when rats were given 60 mg of DMAT by either diet or subcutaneous injection, over 50% of the sulfur from this compound was found as sulfate in the urine when measured after 24 h (46Maw G.A. Biochem. J. 1953; 55: 42-46Google Scholar). There have been no reports on DMAT transport or renal clearance. Although previous studies were relatively short term (3 weeks), it seems that DMAT is nontoxic to animals at levels that might be efficacious in the treatment of homocystinuria. It should be pointed out that a homologue of DMAT, dimethylpropiothetin, is also a substrate for BHMT (28Durell J. Anderson D.G. Cantoni G.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1957; 26: 270-282Google Scholar, 39Ericson L.E. Acta Chem. Scand. 1960; 14: 2127-2134Google Scholar, 40Dubnoff J.W. Borsook H. J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 176: 789-796Google Scholar, 41Maw G.A. Biochem. J. 1956; 63: 116-124Google Scholar). The rate of methionine formation using dimethylpropiothetin was consistently shown to be between those of betaine and DMAT when assayed at saturating concentrations of substrates. Dimethylpropiothetin is a naturally occurring compound (47Rhodes D. Hanson A.D. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 357-384Google Scholar), and its demethylated product, methylthiopropionate, is an intermediate in the transamination pathway of methionine catabolism (48Steele R.D. Benevenga N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 7844-7850Google Scholar). Dimethylpropiothetin can also replace choline (or betaine) in rodent diets devoid of methionine but containing homocystine (45Maw G.A. du Vigneaud V. J. Biol. Chem. 1948; 176: 1037-1045Google Scholar). Further studies on the metabolism and toxicity of DMAT and dimethylpropiothetin are warranted, since these compounds may improve the nutritional management of homocystinuria. The recent generation of transgenic mice deficient in cystathionine β-synthase will be useful for the comparison of betaine versus thetins as pHcy-lowering treatments for homocystinuria (49Watanabe M. Osada J. Aratani Y. Kluckman K. Reddick R. Malinow M.R. Maeda N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1585-1589Google Scholar).An important objective of this research was to isolate a cDNA encoding a mammalian BHMT. Toward this end, porcine BHMT was sequenced, and oligonucleotide primers were designed and subsequently used to isolate a partial cDNA encoding porcine BHMT by PCR. This partial cDNA encoded 272 amino acids of porcine BHMT (Fig. 2). Nonredundant primers based on the porcine cDNA were then used to isolate a partial cDNA encoding human BHMT. This partial cDNA encoded 154 amino acids of human BHMT (Fig. 3). The human PCR fragment was used to screen a cDNA library by plaque hybridization, and 12 positive clones were isolated that had similar restriction maps. The BHMT cDNAs represented about 0.5% of the total number of clones in the library, consistent with the high expression of this protein in liver. The vector containing the longest cDNA insert (pTG9) was sequenced (Fig. 3), and the open reading frame encoded a 406-residue protein of Mr 44,969. An alignment of the porcine and human deduced sequences displayed 94% amino acid identity over 272 amino acids (Fig. 2). The deduced human protein is similar in size to the porcine liver enzyme (Fig. 1) and the enzymes isolated from human (29Skiba W.E. Taylor M.P. Wells M.S. Mangum J.H. Awad Jr., W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14944-14948Google Scholar) and rat (27Lee K- Cava M. Amiri P. Ottoboni T. Lindquist R.N. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 77-86Google Scholar) liver. The N terminus of the intact porcine protein begins with an Ala, and this residue aligns with the second amino acid of the deduced human sequence. Since BHMT is a cytosolic protein, it is unlikely that a large signaling peptide is posttranslationally removed, and therefore, the 2.4-kilobase pair human cDNA likely encodes the entire human protein. It is presently not known how much of the 5′-untranslated region of this cDNA may be missing, but a search of the freely accessible DNA data bases failed to retrieve additional sequence beyond that reported here.In vitro simulation studies indicate that MS and BHMT contribute equally to the methylation of Hcy in rat liver (8Finkelstein J.D. Martin J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9508-9513Google Scholar), although in vivo studies indicate that MS and BHMT activities vary depending upon nutritional and hormonal status (5Finkelstein J.D. Kyle W.E. Harris B.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 146: 84-92Google Scholar, 6Finkelstein J.D. Harris B.J. Martin J.J. Kyle W.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 108: 344-348Google Scholar, 7Finkelstein J.D. Martin J.J. Harris B.J. Kyle W.E. J. Nutr. 1983; 113: 519-521Google Scholar). Due to the very high abundance of BHMT in mammalian liver, it is difficult to hypothesize any dietary or physiological condition where BHMT would not significantly contribute to the methylation of Hcy. Mutations in the BHMT gene that diminish BHMT activity would therefore be predicted to cause some degree of hyperhomocyst(e)inemia, if not homocystinuria. A defect in this enzyme has not been reported, but its activity is absent from lymphocytes and fibroblasts (9Wang J. Dudman N.P.D. Lynch J.F. Wilcken D.E.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1991; 204: 239-243Google Scholar), the usual sources of enzyme extracts used for clinical measurements. Dudman et al. (50Dudman N.P.B. Guo X-W. Gordon R.B. Dawson P.A. Wilcken D.E.L. J. Nutr. 1996; 126: 1295-1300Google Scholar) suggested that a deficiency of BHMT could lead to hyperhomocyst(e)inemia, but the fact that such a defect has not been observed could be due to the metabolism of Hcy, produced by the liver and kidney, by cystathionine β-synthase and MS in peripheral tissues. It is likely that the phenotype of BHMT deficiency will have to await the generation of transgenic mice deficient in this enzyme.The possession of DNA sequence encoding BHMT provides the opportunity to screen for mutations in the BHMT gene. The effects of missense mutations on enzyme catalysis can easily be evaluated, since the enzyme can be expressed in E. coli. Furthermore, the specificity of the human enzyme toward thetin substrates can be evaluated, and more detailed studies on the mechanism of the BHMT reaction can proceed. The human cDNA will also allow studies concerning the regulation of expression of this enzyme by diet and hormones. INTRODUCTIONThere is considerable interest in the regulation of homocysteine (Hcy) 1The abbreviations used are: HcyhomocysteineBHMTbetaine-homocysteine methyltransferaseDMATdimethylacetothetinMSmethionine synthase (vitamin B12-dependent)pHcyplasma total homocyst(e)ine, denoting oxidized and reduced formsPCRpolymerase chain reactionTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. metabolism since even moderate elevations in plasma total homocyst(e)ine (pHcy) have been established as an independent risk factor for the development of arteriosclerotic vascular disease (1Motulsky A.G. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 17-20Google Scholar). The enzyme betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT; EC) may have an important role in the modulation of pHcy. BHMT is a cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of betaine and Hcy to dimethylglycine and methionine, respectively (2McKeever M.P. Weir D.G. Molloy A. Scott J.M. Clin. Sci. 1991; 81: 551-556Google Scholar). This reaction also is required for the irreversible oxidation of choline. The only other enzyme known to methylate Hcy in mammalian cells is the folate/vitamin B12-dependent methionine synthase (MS; EC).Large oral doses of betaine have been shown to be an effective treatment for homocystinuria due to deficiencies of cystathionine β-synthase (EC) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (EC) and inborn errors of cobalamin metabolism (3Kang S-S. Wong P.W.K. Malinow M.R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1992; 12: 279-298Google Scholar, 4Ueland P.M. Refsum H. Brattstrom L. Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease, Hemostasis, and Endothelial Function. Marcel Dekker Inc., New York1992Google Scholar). The level of pHcy in these individuals decreases significantly with betaine treatment, and the incidence of thromboembolism is significantly reduced. The efficacy of betaine treatment is due, at least in part, to increased methylation of Hcy by the BHMT-catalyzed reaction. Betaine treatment, however, usually does not lower pHcy levels to within the normal range, and the moderately elevated levels that remain are highly correlated with vascular disease. BHMT is therefore a target for the treatment of homocystinuria in that better methyl donors may have more potent pHcy-lowering effects. Furthermore, BHMT activity has been shown to vary with dietary and hormonal treatments in rats (5Finkelstein J.D. Kyle W.E. Harris B.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 146: 84-92Google Scholar, 6Finkelstein J.D. Harris B.J. Martin J.J. Kyle W.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1982; 108: 344-348Google Scholar, 7Finkelstein J.D. Martin J.J. Harris B.J. Kyle W.E. J. Nutr. 1983; 113: 519-521Google Scholar) and dietary treatments in chickens. 2J. L. Emmert, T. A. Garrow, and D. H. Baker, submitted for publication. Manipulations of these parameters could improve current therapies for some forms of homocystinuria.A genetic defect in BHMT could result in hyperhomocyst(e)inemia, and perhaps homocystinuria, since it has been reported that this enzyme is responsible for up to 50% of the Hcy methylation capacity in liver (8Finkelstein J.D. Martin J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 9508-9513Google Scholar). This possibility has been difficult to determine, since fibroblasts and lymphocytes, tissues normally assayed to detect enzyme defects, do not express BHMT activity (9Wang J. Dudman N.P.D. Lynch J.F. Wilcken D.E.L. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1991; 204: 239-243Google Scholar). The lack of a cDNA encoding BHMT has precluded investigations into the molecular mechanisms responsible for dietary and hormonally induced changes in BHMT activity. A human cDNA encoding BHMT would aid in the search for defects in its gene.This report describes the purification and kinetic constants of porcine liver BHMT as well as the molecular cloning of a partial porcine cDNA and a near full-length human cDNA encoding this enzyme. A fusion construct of the human cDNA results in BHMT activity in Escherichia coli extracts, an activity absent from wild type bacteria. A comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of human BHMT with that of E. coli MS indicates regions that may be involved in Hcy binding and catalysis of methyl transfer."

The cDNA, for which we propose the name Has2, encodes a novel protein with a predicted molecular mass of 63.6 kDa. Has2 shows 55% amino acid identity with Xenopus DG42 and 52% identity with the mouse HAS protein, another putative hyaluronan synthase recently reported by Itano and Kimata (Itano, N., and Kimata, K. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 9875-9878). The deduced primary structure revealed the presence of several hydrophobic stretches which can form multiple transmembrane domains. It also demonstrated the complete conservation of amino acid residues that are known to be critical for N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity of yeast chitin synthase. When the Has2 cDNA was transfected into human 293 and Chinese hamster ovary cells, the production of hyaluronan in the transfected cells increased up to 34- and 9-fold, respectively. Strong expression of Has2 mRNA was observed in exponentially proliferating human IMR-90 fibroblasts but not in growth-arrested IMR-90 cells. These results suggest that the Has2 protein is a crucial component of the human hyaluronan synthase system.

Hyaluronan (HA) 1The abbreviations used are: HAhyaluronic acid or hyaluronanHAShyaluronan synthasePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCRpolymerase chain reactionkbkilobase(s)bpbase pair(s). is a glycosaminoglycan of alternating N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and glucuronic acid (GlcA) residues synthesized by essentially all organisms from bacteria to mammals. Several lines of evidence indicate that, unlike other glycosaminoglycans, the HA synthesis occurs at the inner surface of the plasma membrane with the growing HA chains extruding through pore-like structures into the extracellular space (1Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1984; 220: 191-198Crossref Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 2Philipson L.H. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5017-5023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The structure of the Streptococcus HA synthase (HasA) appears to be consistent with this model of HA synthesis, since it has several hydrophobic stretches that could form multiple transmembrane domains (3DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Search of the sequence data base revealed that Rhizobium NodC gene, yeast chitin synthases, and the Xenopus developmental protein DG42 bear substantial similarities to HasA (4DeAngelis P.L. Yang N. Weigel P.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 199: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have hypothesized that the mammalian HA synthase is a member of this family of proteins and attempted to clone it by using the sequence homology between HasA and DG42. Here we report the identification of a novel member of this family named Has2 which has an activity to direct greatly increased HA synthesis in transfected cells. hyaluronic acid or hyaluronan hyaluronan synthase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction kilobase(s) base pair(s). Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized from the mRNA isolated from IMR-90 human fibroblasts using a cDNA synthesis kit from Amersham. PCR was performed with the cDNA and oligonucleotide primers designed based on the amino acid homologies between HasA (3DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and DG42 (5Rosa F. Sargent T.D. Rebbert M.L. Michaels G.S. Jamrich M. Grunz H. Jones E. Winkles J.A. Dawid I.B. Dev. Biol. 1988; 129: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The combination of the following primers reproducibly amplified a fragment of expected size (130 bp); sense primer, 5′-GGIGA(T/C)GA(T/C)(A/C)GICA(T/C)(T/C)TIAC-3′ (corresponding to amino acid sequences 233GDDRCLT of HasA and 340GDDRHLT of DG42); antisense primer, 5′-TTI(G/T)TCCAIC(G/T)I(G/T)T(C/T)TG(C/T)TG-3′ (corresponding to amino acid sequences 270QQNRWNK of HasA and 378QQTRWTK of DG42). The nucleotide sequence of the amplified fragment was shown to have significant similarities to those of DG42 and HasA. A longer cDNA fragment was then amplified with a degenerate sense primer (5′-TA(C/T)TGGATGGCNTT(C/T)AA(C/T)GTNGA-3′) corresponding to an upstream conserved region (260YWMAFNIE in Fig. 1) and a nested antisense primer (5′-GGTTGCTGGTTTAGCCA-3′). The resulting 276-bp fragment was sequenced and used to screen a λZAP human brain stem cDNA library (Stratagene). Two clones, λHFB1 and λHFB2, were plaque-purified, from which corresponding plasmids, pHFB1 and pHFB2, were excised with helper phage. The insert cDNAs were sequenced as described previously (6Watanabe K. Yamada H. Yamaguchi Y. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1207-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Analysis for protein structures was performed by the PredictProtein (EMBL, Heidelberg) and the TMpred (Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, Lausanne) programs. The nucleotide sequence encoding the 12CA5 epitope sequence (YPYDVPDYA) (7Wilson I.A. Niman H.L. Houghten R.A. Cherenson A.R. Connolly M.L. Lerner R.A. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar) was introduced by PCR into the 3′ end of the coding region. Briefly, a PCR fragment was amplified between nucleotide positions 2071 and 2191 with the following primers; sense primer, 5′-AATTGTTGGAACGTTGCTC-3′; antisense primer, 5′-TCAGGCGTAATCTGGCACATCGTATGGGTATACATCAAGCACCATGTC-3′. (This primer contains antisense sequence for the 12CA5 epitope and a stop codon as indicated by single and double underlines, respectively.) The resulting PCR fragment includes a SphI site corresponding to the SphI site at nucleotide position 2097 of Has2 and sequences encoding the 12CA5 epitope and a stop codon. The PCR fragment was subcloned into pGEM-T (Promega), from which a 150-bp SphI fragment was excised at the SphI site in the PCR fragment and a single SphI site in the multiple cloning site of pGEM-T. Thus, the excised fragment consists of the nucleotides 2098-2191 of Has2, the 12CA5 epitope, a stop codon, and a short segment (26 bp) of the multiple cloning site of pGEM-T. This fragment was then ligated into the SphI site (nucleotide position 2097) of pHFB1. The entire Has2 insert in this construct was excised and ligated to the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) in sense orientation to generate pHAStagC. To establish stable transfectants, subconfluent human 293 cells in a 10-cm culture dish were transfected with 10 μg of pHAStagC using Pharmacia CellPhect transfection kit and selected in the presence of 800 μg/ml G418. Dihydrofolate reductase-deficient CHO-DG44 cells were co-transfected with 10 μg of pHAStagC and 1 μg of pSV2dhfr as described above and selected in nucleoside-free medium (8Yamaguchi Y. Ruoslahti E. Nature. 1988; 336: 244-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and 400 μg/ml G418. From each transfection, up to five resistant colonies were picked using cloning rings. Among them, three clones for each cell line were randomly selected for further studies (designated as 293pHAStagC-1, −2, and −3, and CHOpHAStagC-1, −2, and −3). For the assay of HA production, 1 × 105 cells were plated in a 35-mm well and cultured overnight. Then cells were fed with fresh media, and their culture supernatants were collected after a 24 h-incubation for assay. Quantities of HA produced by transient and stable transfectants were measured in the culture supernatants by the radiometric HA binding assay using Pharmacia HA Test kit (Pharmacia AB, Uppsala, Sweden) (3DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14568-14571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since most of the synthesized HA is secreted into cultured media (10Heldin P. Asplund T. Ytterberg D. Thelin S. Laurent T.C. Biochem J. 1992; 283: 165-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 11Suzuki M. Asplund T. Yamashita H. Heldin C.-H. Heldin P. Biochem J. 1995; 307: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), the amount of cell-associated HA was not determined. The 293pHAStagC-1 cells in a 10-cm culture dish were washed and detached with 50 m Tris (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 NaCl and 2.5 m EDTA. Detached cells were pelleted, resuspended in 1.4 ml of 50 m Tris (pH 8.0), and disrupted by sonication. A suspension of the disrupted cells was ultracentrifuged in a Beckman TLS rotor at 50,000 rpm for 45 min and the supernatant was collected. Pellets were dissolved in 0.5 ml of 1% SDS, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g to remove insoluble materials. Amounts equivalent to 1/70 of each fraction were loaded in each lane of a 8-16% gradient SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed by immunoblotting. We obtained a probe for a putative human HA synthase by a series of PCRs with degenerate primers which were designed based on the sequence homology between HasA and DG42. By screening a human brain stem cDNA library with the probe, we obtained a clone λHFB1 which contains a 3-kb insert covering the entire open reading frame. Complete sequencing of the λHFB1 insert demonstrated that it encodes a novel protein of 552 amino acid residues and a calculated molecular mass of 63.6 kDa (Fig. 1), for which we propose the name Has2. Alignment analyses showed that Has2 is 55% and 52% identical, respectively, to Xenopus DG42 (5Rosa F. Sargent T.D. Rebbert M.L. Michaels G.S. Jamrich M. Grunz H. Jones E. Winkles J.A. Dawid I.B. Dev. Biol. 1988; 129: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) and the mouse HAS protein, another putative mouse HA synthase recently reported (12Itano N. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9875-9878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Analysis by PredictProtein and TMpred programs predicted 6 potential transmembrane helices, 2 in the N-terminal and 4 in the C-terminal regions. Both programs predicted a type II transmembrane topology for the N terminus of the protein. Between the N-terminal and C-terminal regions, there is a long sequence without potential transmembrane domains. In this region, residues that are thought to be crucial for N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity of chitin synthase 2 (13Nagahashi S. Sudoh M. Ono N. Sawada R. Yamaguchi E. Uchida Y. Mio T.

To demonstrate the enzyme activity of the protein, we transfected the Has2 cDNA into human 293 and CHO cells. Expression of the recombinant protein was verified by immunoblotting with 12CA5 monoclonal antibodies (Boehringer Mannheim) which recognize the epitope tag. Quantitation of HA production demonstrated that randomly selected 293 transfectant clones produce HA up to 34-fold higher than the HA production by control transfected and untransfected 293 cells (Table I). In CHO cells where the background production of HA is much lower than that of 293 cells, HA production by transfectants was still significantly greater (up to 9-fold) than that of control cells (Table I).Table I.HA production by stable transfectants of Has2 cDNAExperimentTransfectant cloneaClones 293pHAStagC-1, 293pHAStagC-2, and 293pHAStagC-3 were isolated from transfection of human 293 cells with pHAStagC.

Open table in a new tab Like DG42, the deduced primary structure of Has2 predicts multiple hydrophobic stretches that may serve as transmembrane domains. However, Rosa et al. (5Rosa F. Sargent T.D. Rebbert M.L. Michaels G.S. Jamrich M. Grunz H. Jones E. Winkles J.A. Dawid I.B. Dev. Biol. 1988; 129: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) reported that a large proportion of DG42 in Xenopus embryo is solubilized in physiological buffers without any detergents. To examine the subcellular distribution of Has2, stably transfected cells were fractionated by ultracentrifugation and the distribution of Has2 in these fractions was analyzed by immunoblotting with 12CA5 antibodies (Fig. 3A). This experiment demonstrated that a minor portion (∼30%) of Has2 is present in the supernatant fraction, which mainly consists of cytosol. Nevertheless, the majority of Has2 was fractionated into the pellet, which contains membranes. To rule out the possibility that this was due to incomplete extraction, we examined the distribution of BAG-1, a Bcl-2 binding cytosolic protein (14Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar), in the same samples. As shown in Fig. 3B, BAG-1 was completely extracted into the supernatant. These results confirmed that the majority of Has2 is indeed associated with cell membranes as predicted from its sequence. It is not clear at present whether the Has2 detected in the supernatant fraction, which migrates slightly slower in SDS-PAGE than the membrane-associated Has2 (see Fig. 3A), represents a biochemically distinct population. In Northern blotting analysis, two Has2 mRNA species of 4.4 kb and 2.5 kb in size were detected in exponentially proliferating IMR-90 fibroblasts (Fig. 4). Quiescent IMR-90 cells at confluency do not express detectable levels of Has2 mRNA. Has2 is a novel member of the family that includes HasA (3DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yeast chitin synthases (15Bulawa C.E. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1993; 47: 505-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), NodC (16Bulawa C.E. Wasco W. Nature. 1991; 353: 710Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and DG42 (5Rosa F.

Although not originally identified as enzymes, NodC and DG42 have been shown to catalyze synthesis of chitin-like oligosaccharides (17Geremia R.A. Mergaert P. Geelen D. Van Montagu M. Holsters M.

HA and chitin are structurally related, while HA is a repeating disaccharide polymer of GlcA(β1→3) GlcNAc(β1→4) residues, chitin is a homopolymer of GlcNAc(β1→4). Therefore, these proteins have β-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity in common. The overall structure of Has2 with its multiple potential transmembrane domains is strikingly similar to the other members of the family, yet the similarity is not only in the overall structure. Nagahashi et al. (13Nagahashi S. Sudoh M. Ono N. Sawada R. Yamaguchi E. Uchida Y. Mio T. Takagi M. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13961-13967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) have identified 5 amino acid residues that are crucial for the β-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity of Saccharomyces chitin synthase 2 and found that these residues are conserved in the members of the family including HasA, NodC, and DG42. Remarkably, these residues are also completely conserved in Has2 (Fig. 2). This strongly suggests that Has2 has at least β-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity. Comparison of amino acid sequences showed that while Has2 and the HAS protein (12Itano N. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9875-9878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) are distinct molecular entities, they are similarly distant from Xenopus DG42. On the other hand, the zebra fish and mouse “DG42-like” cDNAs, for which partial sequences have been reported by Semino et al. (20Semino C.E. Specht C.A. Raimondi A. Robbins P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4548-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), are essentially identical to the corresponding region of Has2 (93% and 100% identical, respectively). These data suggest that Has2, the HAS protein, and DG42 represent three distinct molecular entities of the family, whereas the zebra fish and mouse DG42-like cDNAs (20Semino C.E. Specht C.A. Raimondi A. Robbins P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4548-4553Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) are likely to be the homologues of Has2. We showed that, upon transfection, Has2 confers a greatly increased production of HA to cells. Furthermore, the expression pattern of Has2 mRNA in confluent and proliferating fibroblasts is consistent with the reported pattern of HA synthesis in these cells; the synthesis of HA increases in proliferating fibroblasts while it is inhibited in growth-arrested cells (21Brecht M. Mayer U. Schlosser E. Prehm P. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 22Matuoka K. Namba M. Mitsui Y. J.

Thus, taken together with the aforementioned structural similarities, these results strongly suggest that Has2 is a crucial component of the human HA synthase system if not the HA synthase per se. Although our data have not ruled out the possibility that Has2 is an activator or inducer of true HA synthase, this wealth of circumstantial evidence appears to indicate otherwise. In any event, the enzymatic properties of Has2 should be thoroughly examined in future studies to definitely prove that Has2 is the authentic hyaluronan synthase. A most critical question is whether Has2 alone is capable of synthesizing high molecular mass HA. Although studies on bacterial HA synthesis demonstrated that HasA is the sole component required for a functional HA synthase (24DeAngelis P.L. Weigel P.H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9033-9039Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), it is not known whether the same is true for the mammalian system. Finally, it is important to determine how Has2 associates with cell membranes and whether the membrane association is required for its activity. Our finding that Has2 is present in a cytosolic fraction as well as in membranes suggests the possibility that HA synthesis in mammalian cells could be regulated by a dynamic interaction of Has2 with cell membranes.

These morphological changes are correlated with an increase in the level of polymerized tubulin and in the level of the microtubule-associated protein, MAP2c.

The AT1 receptor is closely associated with cardiovascular regulation, fluid volume homeostasis, and cellular growth (1Bottari S.P. de Gasparo M. Steckelings U.M. Levens N.R. Front.

Tsuzuki S. Inui H. Hamakubo T. Inagami T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24543-24546Google Scholar), but a definitive physiological function has yet to be assigned. We have reported previously that Ang II decreases the T-type calcium current in nondifferentiated NG108-15 cells expressing only the angiotensin AT2 receptor type (15Buisson B. Bottari S.P. de Gasparo M. Gallo-Payet N. Payet M.-D. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 161-164Google Scholar, 16Buisson B. Laflamme L. Bottari S.P. de Gasparo M. Gallo-Payet N. Payet M.D. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1994; 267: C1389-C1397Google Scholar) also reported that activation of the AT2 receptor increased a potassium channel activity. Moreover, Xiong and Marshall (18Xiong H. Marshall K.C. Neuroscience. 1994; 62: 163-175Google Scholar) reported that Ang II, via the AT2 receptor, could inhibit membrane depolarization and action potential elicited by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in the locus coeruleus, a brain area containing only Ang II receptors of the AT2 subtype. Considering the abundance of T-type Ca2+ channels in neurons from fetal brain (19Spitzer N.C. J. Neurobiol. 1991; 22: 659-673Google Scholar), the crucial role of Ca2+ in neuronal differentiation (20Kater S.B. Mills L.R. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 891-899Google Scholar) and the abundance of AT2 receptors during this developmental period, it could be postulated that Ang II, via the AT2 receptor could affect some aspects of neuronal differentiation. angiotensin II microtubule-associated protein dibutyryl cAMP fetal bovine serum Hanks' buffered saline 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid Tris-buffered saline sarcosine Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Neuronal differentiation is characterized by neurite extension that involves several biochemical steps directed toward promotion of the assembly of tubulin monomers into microtubules necessary to support the growing neurites. Several molecules play crucial roles in neurite outgrowth. Among these are the microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) (21Tucker R.P. Brain Res. Rev. 1990; 15: 101-120Google Scholar), which include both high molecular weight proteins, termed MAP1 to MAP5, and low molecular weight proteins, including tau (22Matus A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1988; 11: 29-44Google Scholar). These proteins promote tubulin polymerization as well as stabilize microtubules and occur as embryonic and adult isoforms whose differential expression during brain development correlates with the maturation of neuronal circuitry. For example, MAP2 and tau bind to distinct populations of microtubules in adult neurons: MAP2 to somatodendritic microtubules and tau to axonal microtubules (23Matus A. Bernhardt R. Hugh-Jones T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 3010-3014Google Scholar, 24Binder L.I. Frankfuter A. Rebhun L.I. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 1371-1378Google Scholar). Expression of specific brain MAPs is critical for regulating neurite outgrowth and differentiation. Several lines of evidence have demonstrated a strong correlation between the pattern of expression of neuronal MAPs and the morphological differentiation of neurons (22Matus A. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1988; 11: 29-44Google Scholar). In their nondifferentiated state, the hybrid cells NG108-15 (neuroblastoma × glioma) are rounded and actively dividing. Chronic exposure of NG108-15 cells to dibutyryl cAMP (dbcAMP) induces a process of differentiation that includes elaboration of neurites, development of electrical excitability, formation of functional synapses, alteration of ligand-gated channel properties, and a reduced rate of cell division. Thus, differentiated NG108-15 cells exhibit a neuronal phenotype, whereas glial properties appear to be suppressed (25Hamprecht B. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1977; 49: 99-170Google Scholar, 26Hamprecht B. Glaser T. Reiser G. Bayer E. Propst F. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 316-341Google Scholar). Moreover, when nondifferentiated, NG108-15 cells express exclusively the AT2 receptor subtype and mainly the T-type Ca2+ channel (15Buisson B. Bottari S.P. de Gasparo M. Gallo-Payet N. Payet M.-D. FEBS Lett. 1992; 309: 161-164Google Scholar). These cells also express tau and MAP2 and are thus useful in examining factors initiating neuronal differentiation (27Beaman-Hall C.M. Vallano M.L. J. Neurobiol. 1993; 24: 1500-1516Google Scholar). We have taken advantage of these properties to investigate the role of Ang II on differentiation and neurite outgrowth, with emphasis on cytoskeletal proteins. We found that Ang II induces outgrowth of neurites in nondifferentiated cells. These morphological changes are correlated with an increase in polymerized tubulin and an increase in the level of microtubule-associated MAP2c. In contrast, during the process of differentiation with dbcAMP, where both AT1 and AT2 receptors are present, application of Ang II induces neurites involution. These results are the first to assign a physiological role for the AT2 receptor in neuronal differentiation, which is to induce neurite outgrowth, by acting on tubulin polymerization and on the level of microtubule-associated MAP2c. Moreover, our results demonstrate that activation of the AT1 receptor subtype inhibits the process of differentiation induced by dbcAMP and inhibits the effect elicited by the AT2 receptor. NG108-15 cells (provided by Drs. M. Emerit and M. Hamon; INSERM, U. 238, Paris, France) were cultured (passage 4 to 17) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Life Technologies, Inc., Burlington, Canada) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Life Technologies, Inc.), HAT supplement (hypoxanthine, aminopterin, thymidine) (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 50 mg/liter gentamycin at 37°C in 80-cm2 Nunclon Delta flasks in a humidified atmosphere of 93% air and 7% CO2, as suggested by Hamprecht et al. (26Hamprecht B. Glaser T. Reiser G. Bayer E. Propst F. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 109: 316-341Google Scholar). The medium was replaced every 2 days. Subcultures were performed at subconfluence. Under these conditions, cells express only the AT2 receptor subtype of Ang II (Fig. 1A). For differentiation, the cells were cultured for 24 h in the normal culture medium and thereafter replaced by DMEM low glucose (1 mg/liter glucose) containing 1% fetal calf serum (Inotech), HAT supplement, 50 mg/liter gentamycin, and 1 mM dbcAMP (Boehringer Mannheim, Montreal, Canada). The cells were allowed to differentiate for 24 h prior to Ang II or Ang II/analogs treatment. Cells were cultured for 3 subsequent days under these conditions, with the differentiation medium being changed every day. For all experiments, cells were plated at the same initial density. Experiments and cytoskeleton extractions were performed on the 4th day. The analog [Sar1,Ile8]Ang II was iodinated by the Iodogen method and separated on a 25-cm C-18 µ-Bondapak column (Waters, Milford, MA) with a linear gradient of 20-60% acetonitrile in a buffer of 7% isopropanol, 0.25 M ammonium acetate, pH 5.0, at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Carrier-free monoiodinated product was obtained as a single homogenous peak at 20 min. The specific activity was approximately 1000 Ci/mmol. Binding assays were performed on cultured cells as described previously (28Guillon G. Gallo-Payet N. Balestre M.-N. Lombard C. Biochem. J. 1986; 253: 765-775Google Scholar). NG108-15 cells (1.0-1.5 × 106 cells/Petri dish) were washed with 2 ml of Hanks' buffered saline (HBS: NaCl, 130 mM; KCl, 3.5 mM; CaCl2, 1.8 mM; MgCl2, 0.5 mM; NaHCO3, 2.5 mM; HEPES, 5 mM, supplemented with 1 g/liter glucose and 0.5% BSA) and incubated for 15 min at 22°C in the same medium. The hormone binding reaction was initiated by quick aspiration of the HBS medium and addition to each Petri dish of 0.8 ml of HBS containing the labeled peptide alone or with analogs as described above. Incubations were performed in triplicates for 45 min at room temperature (22°C). After incubation, cells were rapidly detached by scraping them with a rubber policeman. Incubations media were filtered through Whatman GF/C filters, rinsed three times, and counted in a Beckman γ counter. Displacement curves illustrated in Fig. 1 show that, in nondifferentiated cells, DUP 753 did not displace the iodinated Ang II analog from the Ang II receptor (Fig. 1A), although, in differentiated cells, labeling was displaced by DUP 753 (Fig. 1B), indicating the presence of AT1 receptors. These results show that nondifferentiated cells contain only AT2 receptors, while cells that have initiated differentiation express both subtypes of the Ang II receptor. Three days of Ang II treatment induced the expression of AT1 receptors, which remained in low proportions however (20% displacement) compared with the AT2 receptors (Fig. 1C), while decreasing the number of AT1 receptors in dbcAMP-differentiated cells (20% displacement compared with 50% in control dbcAMP-treated cells) (Fig. 1D). Preparations enriched in microtubules were obtained from cells grown in 100-mm Petri dishes as described by Solomon (29Solomon F. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 134: 139-147Google Scholar) with some modifications. The cells were pretreated with 1 µM Taxol (Sigma) for 2 h before extraction of microtubules. At this concentration Taxol stabilizes microtubules without promoting polymerization. The culture medium was then aspirated and replaced by PM2G buffer (PIPES, 0.1 M; glycerol, 2 M; MgCl2, 5 mM; EGTA, 2 mM, aprotinin, 40 TIU/ml; phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mM; benzamidine, 1 mM, pH 6.9) containing Taxol (1 µM). Cells were scraped from the substratum with a rubber policeman and transferred to a 15-ml conical tube and centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 37°C. The cell pellet was then extracted with PM2G buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 1 µM Taxol. After a 15-min incubation at 37°C the suspension was centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min at 37°C. The pellet containing the microtubules and associated proteins was then solubilized in Tris buffer 125 mM, pH 6.8, containing 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) (w/v), 20% glycerol (v/v), and 10%β-mercaptoethanol (v/v) and heated to 100°C for 5 min. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 5 min, the supernatant was stored at -20°C until Western blot analysis. For total cell extracts, cells grown in 100-mm Petri dishes were washed twice with HBS buffer and solubilized as described above. β-Tubulin was detected with monoclonal antibody purchased from Amersham (Oakville, Ontario, Canada); monoclonal antibody that recognizes all MAP2 forms were purchased from Sigma and the monoclonal tau antibody 5E2 was kindly provided by Dr. Ken Kosik (Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Samples from equivalent number of cells were compared in each experiment. Samples were separated on 4-15% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred electrophoretically to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, CA). Membranes were blocked with 1% gelatin, 0.05% Tween 20 in TBS buffer, pH 7.5. After three washes with TBS/Tween 20 (0.05%), membranes were incubated either with anti-tubulin (1:250), anti-MAP2 (1:500), or anti-tau (1:750) for 2 h at room temperature, followed by four washes with TBS/Tween 20. Detection was accomplished using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Amersham, Oakville, Ontario, Canada) and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham). The immunoreactive bands were scanned by laser densitometry and expressed in arbitrary units. For immunofluorescence, cells were plated on plastic coverslips (Starsted, St. Laurent, Quebec, Canada) and were grown and treated for 3 days with appropriate stimuli. Cells were rinsed twice with HBS, fixed with formaldehyde 3.7% (v/v) (in HBS), pH 7.4, for 15 min at room temperature, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (v/v) in HBS. Nonspecific binding was eliminated by washing with HBS/glycine (100 mM) solution for 1 h at 4°C followed by incubation with 5% milk solution. Cells were then incubated with the anti-tubulin antibody (1:50) for 1 h at room temperature. Coverslips were washed and further incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary fluorescein-conjugated anti-IgG antibody (Boehringer Mannheim). The coverslips were then mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). We first examined the effects of Ang II on the morphological changes and cytoskeletal interactions that lead to the initial neurite outgrowth from neuronal cell bodies. Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/dish. As shown by phase-contrast microscopy, after 3 days in culture, nontreated, nondifferentiated control cells were actively dividing and had round cell bodies, although some cells exhibited thin processes (Fig. 2A). After a 3-day treatment with Ang II (100 nM), most cells extended one or two neurite processes with a growth cone at their tip (Fig. 2B) along with a longer process, while the cell body retained a rounded appearance. Moreover, the number of cells was lower than in control, nontreated cells (from 4.3 ± 0.8 × 106 cells/control dishes to 3.2 ± 0.6 × 106 cells/Ang II-treated dishes, 25% decrease), indicating that the rate of cell division had decreased. Cell viability was not affected since they remained attached to the substratum, persistently excluded trypan blue, and the effect was reversible after removal of the hormone (data not shown). These morphological changes were due to AT2 receptor activation, since cells co-incubated with Ang II plus the AT2 receptor antagonist, PD 123319, kept their rounded appearance and formed aggregates (Fig. 2C), while co-incubation with Ang II plus DUP 753 did not alter the morphological appearance of Ang II-treated cells (data not shown). In addition, 3-day treatment with CGP 42112 also induced neurite extension and branching. These treated cells had a polygonal cell body, and the number of extensions and branchings appeared higher than in Ang II-treated cells (Fig. 2D). The morphological appearance of the cells after the 3-day treatment with Ang II was similar to those observed after a 3-day treatment with 1 mM dbcAMP, although in the latter, the cells had mainly one axon-like process and one or two dendrite-like processes (Fig. 3A). However, if Ang II was applied during the 3-day differentiating period, neurite retraction was observed, cells exhibit then a round up appearance but conserve one process (Fig. 3B). This morphological change was mediated by the AT1 receptor activation, since cells co-incubated with DUP 753 kept their differentiated morphology (Fig. 3C), as cells treated with CGP 42112 (Fig. 3D). Related changes in the distribution of microtubules were determined by immunofluorescence microscopy with an antibody to β-tubulin. In nondifferentiated cells, microtubules appear as long and thin filaments, loosely distributed throughout the cell (Fig. 4A). After a 3-day treatment with Ang II, most cells exhibited neurite processes with growth cones at their tips (Fig. 4B). When examined at higher magnification, intensification of microtubule labeling was noticed at the periphery of the cell body (Fig. 4C). Moreover, microtubules became organized in parallel bundles in the neurite and remained dispersed in the central part of the growth cone (Fig. 4D). In cells differentiated by a 3-day treatment with dbcAMP, microtubules were organized in longitudinal bundles localized within the cytoplasm of neurites and were abundant at the perinuclear region (Fig. 5A). When Ang II was added during the 3-day of differentiating period, cells became polygonal with microtubules retracted within the cell body (Fig. 5B). In order to quantify and to better characterize the pharmacology of the effects mediated by Ang II, the amount of polymerized tubulin was analyzed in detergent-extracted cytoskeletal fractions prepared from control, Ang II- or Ang II/analog-treated cells. Since neurite outgrowth requires large amounts of tubulin, its measurement represents an index of neurite extension. Cytoskeletal fractions from equivalent numbers of cells were analyzed in parallel. Thus, the cellular contents of each of the major proteins could be compared directly. As shown in Fig. 6A, in nondifferentiated cells treated for 3 days with Ang II, the level of tubulin had increased compared with nontreated control cells (lane 2 versus lane 1). The effect was specific to the AT2 receptor, since co-incubation with 10 µM PD 123319, a specific AT2 antagonist, reversed the effect of Ang II (lane 3 versus lane 1), whereas co-incubation with 10 µM DUP 753, which inhibits AT1 receptor, did not alter tubulin levels induced by Ang II (lane 4 versus lane 2). Moreover, 3-day treatment with 100 nM CGP 42112 (an AT2 receptor agonist) produced an effect similar to Ang II (lane 5 versus lane 2). Comparative densitometric analysis from five different experiments are illustrated in Fig. 7A and show that Ang II and CGP 42112, respectively, induced a 7- and 6- fold increase of tubulin levels compared with nontreated control cells and conclusively demonstrate that the effect is mediated through the AT2 receptor. Changes in microtubule levels may be due to an increase in total cell tubulin content or may reflect increased polymerization of the tubulin pool. In order to verify this point, total tubulin levels were measured in cellular extracts. As shown in Fig. 6B, Ang II did not induce significant changes in the level of total tubulin content.Fig. 7Quantitative densitometric analysis of the nondifferentiated (A, B) and differentiated NG108-15 cells (C, D) were treated for three days with Ang II or Ang II/analogs and harvested as described under “Materials and Methods.” Cytoskeletal fractions from equivalent numbers of cells were resolved in 4-15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. □, control; , 100 nM Ang II; 100 nM Ang II + 1 µM DUP 753; ▦, 100 nM Ang II + 10 µM PD 123319; □, 100 nM CGP 42112.

A monoclonal antibody recognizing a common epitope in both adult (MAP2a and -b) and juvenile (MAP2c) (27Beaman-Hall C.M. Vallano M.L. J. Neurobiol. 1993; 24: 1500-1516Google Scholar, 30Weisshaar B.

Fig. 6C shows that the antibody to MAP2 revealed two bands with similar intensities of around 85 and 76 kDa. Three-day treatment with Ang II induced a 5.3-fold increase in both MAP2c bands (Fig. 6C, lane 2 versus lane 1 and Fig. 7B). This effect was reproduced with CGP 42112 (4.7-fold increase) (Fig. 6C, lane 5 versus lane 1 and Fig. 7B) and reversed when Ang II was co-incubated with PD 123319 (lane 4 versus lane 2). However, addition of DUP 753, the AT1 receptor antagonist, also inhibited the Ang II effect (Fig. 6C, lane 3 versus lane 2 and Fig. 7B). Tau was detected with the monoclonal antibody 5E2. In nondifferentiated cells, tau appeared as a single isoform with a molecular mass of 58 kDa (Fig. 6D). The level of tau was not significantly affected by treatment with Ang II or Ang II/analogs. As equal amount of cells were analyzed by Western blotting, we could observe that the level of tubulin had increased by 5-fold in differentiated control cells compared with nondifferentiated control cells (compared lanes 1 in Fig. 6, A and E, and Fig. 7, A and C). The addition of Ang II during the 3 days of differentiating treatment with dbcAMP induced a small, but not significant, increase in the level of tubulin. However, when the AT1 receptor was inactivated by co-incubation with DUP 753, a net increase in the level of polymerized tubulin was observed (Fig. 6E, lane 3 versus lane 1) (2.5-fold increase over control, n = 5, Fig. 7C), which appeared to be mediated by the AT2 receptor. This observation was confirmed in cells treated with CGP 42112, which also induced an increase in tubulin content (Fig. 6E, lane 5 versus lane 1) (2.8-fold increase over control, n = 5, Fig. 7C). When PD 123319 was added together with Ang II, tubulin content was similar to that seen in control cells (Fig. 6E, lane 4 versus lane 1). As seen in nondifferentiated cells, total tubulin levels in control or Ang II- or Ang II/analog-treated cells did not change over the experimental period as compared with control (Fig. 6F). In differentiated control cells, the 76-kDa form of MAP2c was predominant (Fig. 6G, lane 1) and had increased compared with the nondifferentiated control cells (Fig. 6C, lane 1). Addition of Ang II for 3 days increased the level of the 85-kDa form without change in the 76-kDa form (Fig. 6G, lane 2 versus lane 1 and Fig. 7D). Here again, these effects were mediated by the AT2 receptor subtype, since co-incubation with PD 123319 inhibits the increase in the level of the 85-kDa form of MAP2 (Fig. 6G, lane 4 versus lane 2) and addition of CGP 42112 increased it (Fig. 6G, lane 5 versus lane 1 and Fig. 7D). However, the addition of DUP 753 did not modify significantly the level of MAP2 that was seen in cells under Ang II treatment (Fig. 6G, lane 3 versus lane 2 and Fig. 7D). Differentiation of NG108-15 cells by dbcAMP was accompanied by an increase in the level of the 58-kDa form of tau (Fig. 6, H versus D, lane 1). A minor band of 36 kDa was also present (Fig. 6H). Treatment with Ang II or Ang II/analogs did not significantly modify the basal level of tau. The most important observation of our study is that Ang II, via the AT2 receptor, acts on the microtubule-associated-protein, MAP2, initiating neurite outgrowth in nondifferentiated, rounded, and dividing NG108-15 cells. The second point is that opposite effects were observed in cells differentiated with dbcAMP, in which both AT1 and AT2 receptors are present. This illustrates a control of Ang II-induced differentiation by a negative feedback mechanism whereby the process is induced by AT2 receptor and inhibited by time-dependent expression of the AT1 receptor. When cultured in the presence of 10% FBS, NG108-15 cells contain only AT2 receptors. Although these results differ from those of Tallant et al. (31Tallant E.A. Diz D.I. Khosla M.C. Ferrario C.M. Hypertension. 1991; 17: 1135-1143Google Scholar), the groups of Speth et al. (32Speth R.C. Mei L. Yamamura H.I. Pept. Res. 1989; 2: 232-239Google Scholar) and Carrithers et al. (33Carrithers M.D. Masuda S. Koide K.A. Weyhenmeyer J.A. Neuroscience Lett. 1992; 135: 45-48Google Scholar) also found that, in nondifferentiated cells, Ang II receptor is not linked to G protein (33Carrithers M.D. Masuda S. Koide K.A. Weyhenmeyer J.A. Neuroscience Lett. 1992; 135: 45-48Google Scholar) and does not stimulate inositol phosphate production (32Speth R.C. Mei L. Yamamura H.I. Pept. Res. 1989; 2: 232-239Google Scholar), two properties associated with the AT1 receptor activation, thus supporting that in nondifferentiated cells, Ang II receptors are not of the AT1 type. These nondifferentiated cells treated for 3 days with Ang II develop neurites; this stimulation of neurite extension is accompanied by an increase in tubulin polymerization. Pharmacological studies demonstrate that these effects are attributable to the AT2 receptor, since application of CGP 42112 produces the same effects as Ang II, while co-incubation with DUP 753 does not alter the Ang II effect. Similar morphological changes were obtained in PC12 cells treated for 3 days with the well known differentiating factor, nerve growth factor (34Chiou J.-Y. Westhead E.W. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 1963-1966Google Scholar, 35Wu Y.Y. Bradshaw R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 409-422Google Scholar). We did not observe significant changes in total tubulin content after a 3-day treatment with Ang II and/or agonist or antagonists (Fig. 6B), which indicates that the nondifferentiated cells contain a pool of tubulin sufficient to support neurite outgrowth, as reported previously by Ferreira and Caceres (36Ferreira A. Caceres A. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 392"

https://openalex.org/W1605977136,"We report preliminary characterization of a gene designated β-R1, which is selectively expressed in response to interferon β (IFN-β) compared with IFN-α. In human astrocytoma cells, β-R1 was induced to an equivalent extent by 10 IU/mL IFN-β or 2500 IU/mL IFN-α2. To address the mechanism of this differential response, we analyzed induction of the β-R1 gene in fibrosarcoma cells and derivative mutant cells lacking components required for signaling by type I IFNs. β-R1 was readily induced by IFN-β in the parental 2fTGH cell line, but not by recombinant IFN-α2, IFN-α Con1, or a mixture of IFN-α subtypes. IFN-α8 induced β-R1 weakly. β-R1 was not induced by IFN-β in mutant cell lines U2A, U3A, U4A, and U6A, which lack, respectively, p48, STAT1, JAK1, and STAT2. U5A cells, which lack the Ifnar 2.2 component of the IFN-α and -β receptor, also failed to express β-R1. U1A cells are partially responsive to IFN-β and IFN-α8 but lacked β-R1 expression, indicating that TYK2 protein is essential for induction of this gene. Taken together, these results suggest that the expression of β-R1 in response to type I IFN requires IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 plus an additional component, which is more efficiently formed on induction by IFN-β compared with IFN-α.

J. Invest. Dermatol. 1990; 95: 665-715Google Scholar, 2Sen G.C. Ransohoff R.M. Adv. Virus Res. 1993; 42: 57-102Google Scholar, 3Sen G.C. Lengyel P. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1988; 35: 27-72Google Scholar). These biological activities are mediated by the products of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), the expression of which is governed largely at the transcriptional level (7Friedman R.L. Manly S.P. McMahon M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Cell. 1984; 38: 745-755Google Scholar, 8Weil J. Epstein C.J. Epstein L.B. Seidman J.J. Sabran J.L. Grossberg S.E. Nature. 1983; 301: 437-439Google Scholar). IFNs are classified into two groups. Collectively, the IFNs-α, -β, and -Ω are designated type I IFNs, and IFN-γ is referred to as type II IFN (3Sen G.C. Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5017-5020Google Scholar). These IFN types bind distinct cellular receptors and activate partially dissimilar but overlapping transcriptional signaling pathways (9Farrar M.A. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 571-611Google Scholar, 10Uze G. Lutfalla G. Mogensen K.E. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 3-26Google Scholar, 11Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Google Scholar, 12Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Google Scholar).In the human IFN system, there are at least 18 nonallelic IFN-α genes, four of which are pseudogenes, and one IFN-β gene (3Sen G.C. Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5017-5020Google Scholar). The IFN-α subtypes are structurally similar to each other and to IFN-β. IFN-α and -β are encoded in a multigene array on human chromosome 9, share a common intronless genomic organization, and appear collectively to use the same signaling pathway. Although type I IFNs exhibit differences in assays of antiviral, antiproliferative, and clinical effects, the biochemical basis and physiological consequences of these distinctions remain uncertain, as no gene(s) have been shown to be induced selectively by a type I IFN. The identification of such selectively regulated genes could promote efforts to address different biological properties and signaling pathways of the varied type I IFNs.Transcriptional regulation by type I IFNs has been intensively studied and is relatively well understood (reviewed in Refs. 11Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Google Scholar, 12Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Google Scholar, 13Ihle J. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Google Scholar, 14Pellegrini S. Schindler C. Trends Biochem Sci. 1993; 18: 338-342Google Scholar). IFN-α and -β activate transcription of ISGs through the assembly and translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of ISGF3, a multisubunit transcription factor that interacts with the ISRE enhancer element upstream of the promoters of ISGs. ISGF3-α contains STAT-1/STAT-2 heterodimers that are activated by phosphorylation on tyrosine of the two component polypeptides of the complex. This heterodimer associates with ISGF3-γ, a 48-kDa DNA binding subunit (p48) to form ISGF3, a complex that possesses high-affinity binding capacity for the ISRE, and is competent to activate transcription from ISRE-containing promoters. The generation of ISGF3 in response to IFN-α and -β requires participation of two receptor-associated tyrosine kinases of the JAK family, TYK2 and JAK1.Recently, an ISRE-ISGF3 independent pathway for IFN-α and -β induction of the IRF-1 gene was described (15Haque S.J. Williams B.R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19523-19529Google Scholar). This transcriptional response was detected through studies of an inverted repeat element located upstream of the IRF-1 structural gene (16Sims S.H. Cha Y. Romine M.F. Gao P.-Q. Gottlieb K. Deisseroth A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 690-702Google Scholar). IFN-α and -β activation of IRF-1 was shown to be mediated by generation of a factor distinct from ISGF3, termed inverted repeat binding factor (IRBF) (15Haque S.J. Williams B.R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19523-19529Google Scholar). Similarly, IFN-α and -β induction of one of the human guanylate-binding protein genes involves the interaction of a factor, termed IFN-α activated factor with an enhancer element, initially described as the IFN-γ-activated sequence (17Decker T. Lew D.J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 5147-5153Google Scholar). The γ-activated sequence element is dissimilar to the ISRE and can be considered to belong to the group of inverted repeat elements (18Kanno Y. Kozak C.A. Schindler C. Driggers P.H. Ennist D.L. Gleason S.L. Darnell Jr., J. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3951-3963Google Scholar). Factors such as IRBF-α/β and IFN-α activated factor contain activated STAT-1α homodimers or STAT-1/STAT-2 heterodimers, and p48 is dispensable for their formation (19Shuai K. Ziemiecki A. Wilks A.F. Harpur A.G. Sadowski H.B. Gilman M.Z. Darnell J.E. Nature. 1993; 366: 580-583Google Scholar, 20Li X. Leung S. Qureshi S. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5790-5794Google Scholar).Generation of these varied signaling complexes is determined by interaction of monomeric IFN-α and -β with a multicomponent receptor complex, with subsequent activation of JAK kinases that are associated with the cytoplasmic face of the receptor complex (10Uze G. Lutfalla G. Mogensen K.E. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 3-26Google Scholar). During this process, protein-protein interactions among the constituents of this supercomplex result in kinase phosphorylation and activation, phosphorylation of the receptor subunits, and recruitment of the STAT components. There is sufficient complexity in this system to allow for potentially different pathways of activation in response to the various IFN-α and -β subtypes, and recent evidence supports such a possibility. One example comes from studies of UIA cells, which lack the JAK kinase TYK2 (21Velazquez L. Fellous M. Stark G.R. Pellegrini S. Cell. 1992; 70: 313-322Google Scholar). U1A cells were initially characterized as deficient for binding and response to IFN-α but partially responsive to IFN-β (22Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4605-4612Google Scholar). This observation suggested that binding sites for IFN-α required the presence of TYK2 for their expression and that IFN-β binding sites could be formed in the absence of TYK2. Recent reports confirmed and amplified this conception of the IFN-α and -β receptor, with the demonstration that a kinase-deficient TYK2 mutant could partially restore the response to IFN-α (23Velazquez L. Mogensen K.E. Barbieri G. Fellous M. Uzá G. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3327-3334Google Scholar). Thus, TYK2 provided a structural component for the IFN-α and -β receptor complex, and this structural contribution was particularly important for binding IFN-α. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that one IFN subtype, IFN-α8, was competent to induce a transcriptional and antiviral response from U1A cells. 2G. Foster, O. Rodrigues, F. Ghouze, D. Testa, M. Liao, G. R. Stark, L. Leadbeater, and H. Thomas, unpublished observations. This finding suggested that various IFN-α subtypes could interact with multisubunit IFN-α and -β receptor complexes with detectably different outcomes. Two groups have also reported that a receptor-associated membrane protein of 95-100 kDa was rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine after treatment with IFN-β but not IFN-α2 or IFN-α8, drawing a biochemical distinction between type I IFN subtypes (24Abramovich C. Shulman L.M. Ratovitski E. Harroch S. Tovey M. Eid P. Revel M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5871-5877Google Scholar, 25Platanias L.C. Uddin S. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17761-17764Google Scholar).In this report, we describe preliminary characterization of a gene designated β-R1, which is selectively induced by IFN-β compared with IFN-α. This is the first report of a gene that is selectively induced in this fashion. The signaling pathway that mediates expression of this gene in IFN-β-treated cells appears to be novel.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell LinesThe CRT astrocytoma cell line was described previously and was derived from a grade IV human astrocytoma (26Estes M.L.

A mixture of natural leukocyte IFN-α species (1 × 108 IU/mg protein) was provided by Wellcome Research Laboratories (Kent, United Kingdom), and recombinant IFN-β (2 × 108 IU/mg protein) was from Berlex (Richmond, CA). Purified recombinant IFN-γ (1.9 × 107 IU/mg protein) was obtained from Genentech, Inc. (South San Francisco, CA). Natural IFN-α8 was kindly provided by Dr. Douglas Testa (AAG, Inc., Phillipsburg, NJ) and was purified by high-performance liquid chromatography from leukocyte-derived IFN-α as described previously (33Fan S.

Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 62: 156-159Google Scholar).RNA Fingerprinting Using Arbitrary PrimersRNA fingerprinting using arbitrary primed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed as described, with local modifications (35Ralph D. McClelland M. Welsh J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10710-10714Google Scholar, 36Welsh J. Chada K. Dalal S. Cheng R. Ralph D. McClelland M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 4965-4970Google Scholar). RNA was routinely used at a concentration of 5-10 µg/mL for reverse transcription. For experiments described in this report, RNA was reverse transcribed using primer zf-8. The same primer was used for second-strand synthesis and PCR. Aliquots of the reaction product were amplified by PCR, using zf-9, zf-10, and zf-11 in the presence of [32P]dCTP. Reaction products were separated on 4% sequencing gels that were dried onto 1-mm Whatman filter paper and subjected to autoradiography. Bands of interest were excised, and the cDNA was eluted overnight in 10 mM Tris-HCl and 1 mM EDTA. An aliquot of the gel-isolated cDNA was amplified by PCR, with the oligonucleotide primers used to generate the fingerprint. Amplified cDNAs were gel purified and stored at -20°C for subcloning.Amplified cDNA products were cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, WI). For each PCR product, 6-10 independently isolated plasmids were sequenced using vector primers and the Sequenase reagent kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The plasmid carrying the 468-bp partial cDNA fragment was designated pGEM-T-β-R1.RNase Protection AssayProbesβ-R1 probe protects a 470-bp fragment of β-R1 mRNA and was generated after cleaving plasmid pGEM-T-β-R1 with restriction enzyme StyI. From the linearized plasmids, [32P]UTP-labeled riboprobes were generated by in vitro transcription using 1 mM ATP, 1 mM GTP, 1 mM CTP, and 60 µCi of [32P]UTP (800 Ci/mmol), 1 µg of RNase inhibitor (Boehringer Mannheim), 1 µg of linearized plasmid DNA, and 1 U of SP6 RNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim) in a total volume of 20 µl, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37°C, with an additional incubation for 20 min at 37°C after addition of 1 µl of RNase-free DNase I (Boehringer Mannheim). The riboprobe was recovered by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The pellet was resuspended in 30 µl of hybridization buffer containing 80% formamide and 1 × PIPES. The 6-16 and 9-27 probes were described by Ackrill et al. (38Ackrill A.M. Reid L.E. Gilbert C.S. Gewert D.R. Porter A.C. Lewin A.R. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 591-598Google Scholar) and yield protected fragments of 190 and 160 bases, respectively. IRF-1 and γ-actin probes protect 175 and 130 bases, respectively (32Muller M.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4221-4228Google Scholar).Hybridization10-20 µg of total cellular RNA was denatured at 85°C for 5 min in buffer containing 80% formamide and 1 × PIPES with 250,000 cpm of β-R1 cRNA probe, 40,000 cpm of 6-16, 9-27, and IRF-1 probes, and 7500 cpm of γ-actin in a total reaction volume of 30 µl, immediately transferred to a 50°C water bath and allowed to hybridize overnight (14-16 h). The reaction mixture was then digested with 20 U/ml of RNase T2 (Life Technologies) in a total volume of 250 µl in buffer containing 50 mM NaAc (pH 4.5), 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA at 37°C for 1 h, followed by precipitation at -70°C for 15 min with 20 µg of glycogen, 265 µl of 4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate (Life Technologies), and 530 µl of isopropanol. The sample was recovered by centrifugation, and the pellet was washed with 100% ethanol and resuspended in 6 µl of loading buffer, heated at 95°C for 3 min, electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel, and visualized by autoradiography. The hybridization signal was quantitated with a storage phosphor technique, using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyville, CA).DISCUSSIONWe used RNA fingerprinting to isolate a novel IFN-γ-regulated gene, β-R1, which proved, unexpectedly, to be selectively induced by IFN-β compared with IFN-α. This selective lack of response to IFN-α was first detected with IFN-α2 but extended to other subtypes, including IFN-α Con1. A mixture of multiple natural IFN-α subtypes also failed to induce expression of β-R1. Natural IFN-α8, which shares some receptor binding characteristics with IFN-β, was found to induce β-R1 weakly. β-R1 is the first gene to our knowledge that is selectively induced by IFN-β compared with IFN-α.Type I interferons (IFN-α and -β) activate many genes through an enhancer, termed the ISRE (48Friedman R.L. Stark G.R. Nature. 1985; 314: 637-639Google Scholar). The β-R1 gene was uninducible in mutant cell lines U2A, U3A, U4A, and U6A, which lack p48, STAT1, JAK1, and STAT2, respectively. Cell lines reverted by individual components recovered IFN-β regulation of β-R1. These experiments indicate that all known factors required for formation of ISGF3 and other type I IFN signaling complexes are essential for β-R1 expression. We interpret this observation to suggest the presence of an ISGF3 binding site in the regulatory region of the gene; the most persuasive evidence in this regard is the failure of IFN-β to induce β-R1 in U2A cells. The specific requirement for STAT2 suggests further that this regulatory element functions through binding ISGF3 or an analogous factor. Signaling through an alternative IFN-β receptor was considered as an explanation of selective β-R1 response to IFN-β. However, requirement for Ifnar 2.2 and STAT2 argued against this concept.A component in addition to ISGF3 may be required for induction of the β-R1 gene, as IFN-β and IFN-α did not exhibit differential efficiency for generating ISGF3. The additional factor is not the STAT-1α homodimeric species of IRBF-α and -β, as this complex was also generated equally in response to the two type I IFN subtypes. The potential role of recently described components such as STAT-1/STAT-2 and STAT-1/STAT-3 heterodimers will need to be addressed in this regard (20Li X. Leung S. Qureshi S. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5790-5794Google Scholar). STAT-1/STAT-2 heterodimers are readily generated in 2fTGH cells after treatment with IFN-α, arguing against their role in this selective response (20Li X. Leung S. Qureshi S. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5790-5794Google Scholar). STAT-1/STAT-3 heterodimers, also present after IFN-α-treatment, play an undefined role in the type I IFN response (13Ihle J. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Google Scholar).Surprisingly, we found that β-R1 was not induced by IFN-β or IFN-α8 in UIA cell lines lacking the protein tyrosine kinase TYK2. This observation was unexpected, because IFN-β elicits TYK2-independent signaling in these cells, resulting in moderately robust induction of ISRE-dependent genes (22Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4605-4612Google Scholar). Initial results in the U1A cell clone were confirmed and extended by experiments using additional complementation group U1 (TYK2-) cell lines that were selected for maximum response to IFN-β. We conclude that β-R1 is unusual among ISGs in its requirement for TYK2 to mediate the response to IFN-β. Velazquez et al. (23Velazquez L. Mogensen K.E. Barbieri G. Fellous M. Uzá G. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3327-3334Google Scholar) recently showed that kinase-deficient mutants of TYK2 can partially restore binding and response to IFN-α and augment the response to IFN-β. It will be of interest to determine whether enzymatically active TYK2 is required for the induction of β-R1 by IFN-β and, if so, to examine TYK2 substrates.IFN-γ induction of β-R1 may also be of interest. IFN-γ can generate transcriptional activators that include STAT-1α homodimers (IFN-γ-activated factor and IRBF-γ) and the GRR (interferon γ response region) binding factor involved in expression of FcγRI (13Ihle J. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Google Scholar, 32Muller M. Laxton C. Briscoe J. Schindler C. Improta T. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4221-4228Google Scholar, 49Decker T. Lew D.J.

A. 1991; 88: 11305-11309Google Scholar). IFN-γ treatment also brings about the expression of the IRF-1 and IRF-2 family members, as well as a novel factor that binds upstream of the mig promoter (16Sims S.H. Cha Y. Romine M.F. Gao P.-Q. Gottlieb K. Deisseroth A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 690-702Google Scholar, 18Kanno Y. Kozak C.A. Schindler C. Driggers P.H. Ennist D.L. Gleason S.L. Darnell Jr., J. Ozato K. Mol. Cell.

Immunol. 1995; 155: 3472-3480Google Scholar). IFN-γ activates transcription of genes containing ISRE elements, probably via trans-acting factors composed of STAT-1α homodimers that associate with p48 (54Bluyssen H.A.R. Muzaffar R. Vlieststra R.J. van der Made A.C.J. Leung S. Stark G.R. Kerr I.M. Trapman J. Levy D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5645-5649Google Scholar). IFN-γ induction of β-R1 requires p48, suggesting that this pathway may be implicated in its expression. There were differences between IFN-γ and IFN-β for induction of β-R1. In particular, sensitivity to protein synthesis inhibition for the β-R1 response to IFN-γ contrasted with superinduction by IFN-β plus cycloheximide (Fig. 1b). This observation may suggest the involvement of newly synthesized components (such as IRF-1) in the IFN-γ pathway. Based on these data, we infer that ISGF3 is required but is not sufficient for induction of β-R1 by type I IFNs. We propose that the promoter of β-R1 has compound regulatory elements that act through an ISRE binding complex and a putative novel factor that is more efficiently formed on induction with IFN-β than IFN-α (Fig. 6a). A complex that binds the ISRE, as well as a putative additional component, is also essential for expression of β-R1 after IFN-γ treatment (Fig. 6b). The regulatory elements of the β-R1 gene may be useful as a tool to identify distinct pathways of type I IFN signaling that differentiate the IFN-α and IFN-β transcriptional responses.

J. Invest. Dermatol. 1990; 95: 665-715Google Scholar, 2Sen G.C. Ransohoff R.M. Adv. Virus Res. 1993; 42: 57-102Google Scholar, 3Sen G.C. Lengyel P. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1988; 35: 27-72Google Scholar). These biological activities are mediated by the products of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), the expression of which is governed largely at the transcriptional level (7Friedman R.L. Manly S.P. McMahon M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Cell. 1984; 38: 745-755Google Scholar, 8Weil J. Epstein C.J. Epstein L.B. Seidman J.J. Sabran J.L. Grossberg S.E. Nature. 1983; 301: 437-439Google Scholar). IFNs are classified into two groups. Collectively, the IFNs-α, -β, and -Ω are designated type I IFNs, and IFN-γ is referred to as type II IFN (3Sen G.C. Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5017-5020Google Scholar). These IFN types bind distinct cellular receptors and activate partially dissimilar but overlapping transcriptional signaling pathways (9Farrar M.A. Schreiber R.D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1993; 11: 571-611Google Scholar, 10Uze G. Lutfalla G. Mogensen K.E. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 3-26Google Scholar, 11Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Google Scholar, 12Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Google Scholar).In the human IFN system, there are at least 18 nonallelic IFN-α genes, four of which are pseudogenes, and one IFN-β gene (3Sen G.C. Lengyel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5017-5020Google Scholar). The IFN-α subtypes are structurally similar to each other and to IFN-β. IFN-α and -β are encoded in a multigene array on human chromosome 9, share a common intronless genomic organization, and appear collectively to use the same signaling pathway. Although type I IFNs exhibit differences in assays of antiviral, antiproliferative, and clinical effects, the biochemical basis and physiological consequences of these distinctions remain uncertain, as no gene(s) have been shown to be induced selectively by a type I IFN. The identification of such selectively regulated genes could promote efforts to address different biological properties and signaling pathways of the varied type I IFNs.Transcriptional regulation by type I IFNs has been intensively studied and is relatively well understood (reviewed in Refs. 11Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Google Scholar, 12Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Google Scholar, 13Ihle J. Cell. 1996; 84: 331-334Google Scholar, 14Pellegrini S. Schindler C. Trends Biochem Sci. 1993; 18: 338-342Google Scholar). IFN-α and -β activate transcription of ISGs through the assembly and translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus of ISGF3, a multisubunit transcription factor that interacts with the ISRE enhancer element upstream of the promoters of ISGs. ISGF3-α contains STAT-1/STAT-2 heterodimers that are activated by phosphorylation on tyrosine of the two component polypeptides of the complex. This heterodimer associates with ISGF3-γ, a 48-kDa DNA binding subunit (p48) to form ISGF3, a complex that possesses high-affinity binding capacity for the ISRE, and is competent to activate transcription from ISRE-containing promoters. The generation of ISGF3 in response to IFN-α and -β requires participation of two receptor-associated tyrosine kinases of the JAK family, TYK2 and JAK1.Recently, an ISRE-ISGF3 independent pathway for IFN-α and -β induction of the IRF-1 gene was described (15Haque S.J. Williams B.R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19523-19529Google Scholar). This transcriptional response was detected through studies of an inverted repeat element located upstream of the IRF-1 structural gene (16Sims S.H. Cha Y. Romine M.F. Gao P.-Q. Gottlieb K. Deisseroth A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 690-702Google Scholar). IFN-α and -β activation of IRF-1 was shown to be mediated by generation of a factor distinct from ISGF3, termed inverted repeat binding factor (IRBF) (15Haque S.J. Williams B.R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19523-19529Google Scholar). Similarly, IFN-α and -β induction of one of the human guanylate-binding protein genes involves the interaction of a factor, termed IFN-α activated factor with an enhancer element, initially described as the IFN-γ-activated sequence (17Decker T. Lew D.J. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell Biol. 1991; 11: 5147-5153Google Scholar). The γ-activated sequence element is dissimilar to the ISRE and can be considered to belong to the group of inverted repeat elements (18Kanno Y. Kozak C.A. Schindler C. Driggers P.H. Ennist D.L. Gleason S.L. Darnell Jr., J. Ozato K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3951-3963Google Scholar). Factors such as IRBF-α/β and IFN-α activated factor contain activated STAT-1α homodimers or STAT-1/STAT-2 heterodimers, and p48 is dispensable for their formation (19Shuai K. Ziemiecki A. Wilks A.F. Harpur A.G. Sadowski H.B. Gilman M.Z. Darnell J.E. Nature. 1993; 366: 580-583Google Scholar, 20Li X. Leung S. Qureshi S. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5790-5794Google Scholar).Generation of these varied signaling complexes is determined by interaction of monomeric IFN-α and -β with a multicomponent receptor complex, with subsequent activation of JAK kinases that are associated with the cytoplasmic face of the receptor complex (10Uze G. Lutfalla G. Mogensen K.E. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1995; 15: 3-26Google Scholar). During this process, protein-protein interactions among the constituents of this supercomplex result in kinase phosphorylation and activation, phosphorylation of the receptor subunits, and recruitment of the STAT components. There is sufficient complexity in this system to allow for potentially different pathways of activation in response to the various IFN-α and -β subtypes, and recent evidence supports such a possibility. One example comes from studies of UIA cells, which lack the JAK kinase TYK2 (21Velazquez L. Fellous M. Stark G.R. Pellegrini S. Cell. 1992; 70: 313-322Google Scholar). U1A cells were initially characterized as deficient for binding and response to IFN-α but partially responsive to IFN-β (22Pellegrini S. John J. Shearer M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4605-4612Google Scholar). This observation suggested that binding sites for IFN-α required the presence of TYK2 for their expression and that IFN-β binding sites could be formed in the absence of TYK2. Recent reports confirmed and amplified this conception of the IFN-α and -β receptor, with the demonstration that a kinase-deficient TYK2 mutant could partially restore the response to IFN-α (23Velazquez L. Mogensen K.E. Barbieri G. Fellous M. Uzá G. Pellegrini S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3327-3334Google Scholar). Thus, TYK2 provided a structural component for the IFN-α and -β receptor complex, and this structural contribution was particularly important for binding IFN-α. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that one IFN subtype, IFN-α8, was competent to induce a transcriptional and antiviral response from U1A cells. 2G. Foster, O. Rodrigues, F. Ghouze, D. Testa, M. Liao, G. R. Stark, L. Leadbeater, and H. Thomas, unpublished observations. This finding suggested that various IFN-α subtypes could interact with multisubunit IFN-α and -β receptor complexes with detectably different outcomes. Two groups have also reported that a receptor-associated membrane protein of 95-100 kDa was rapidly phosphorylated on tyrosine after treatment with IFN-β but not IFN-α2 or IFN-α8, drawing a biochemical distinction between type I IFN subtypes (24Abramovich C. Shulman L.M. Ratovitski E. Harroch S. Tovey M. Eid P. Revel M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5871-5877Google Scholar, 25Platanias L.C. Uddin S. Colamonici O.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17761-17764Google Scholar).In this report, we describe preliminary characterization of a gene designated β-R1, which is selectively induced by IFN-β compared with IFN-α. This is the first report of a gene that is selectively induced in this fashion. The signaling pathway that mediates expression of this gene in IFN-β-treated cells appears to be novel."

While Zap-70 is restricted to T-cells and natural killer cells, Syk accumulates in B-cells, mast cells, platelets, and immature T-cells. In addition, we found that an isoform of Syk (SykB), which carries a 23-amino acid deletion in the “linker” region, is prominently expressed in bone marrow. To better understand the relative impact of Syk, SykB, and Zap-70 on signal transduction, we compared their intrinsic enzymatic properties in transiently transfected COS-1 cells and in hemopoietic cells. Using modified versions of these enzymes bearing a common Myc epitope at the amino terminus, we determined that the ability of Syk and SykB to undergo autophosphorylation and to phosphorylate erythrocyte band 3 in immune complex kinase reactions was at least 100-fold greater than that of Zap-70. Similarly, Syk and SykB, but not Zap-70, caused prominent tyrosine phosphorylation of p120c-cbl in COS-1 cells. A similar pattern of activity was also noted for endogenous Syk and Zap-70 from hemopoietic cells. To understand the structural basis for these characteristics, we also created and analyzed a series of chimeras between Syk and Zap-70.

Ann. Neurol. 1993; 33: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Besides its role in neuropathies, the HNK-1 carbohydrate has been recognized as an important mediator of molecular recognition in normal development of the nervous system. It is expressed by recognition molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily, members of the tenascin family, integrins, and proteoglycans (5Schachner M. Martini R. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 183-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and it binds to certain isoforms of laminin (6Hall H. Liu L. Schachner M. Schmitz B. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1993; 5: 34-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) and to P- and L-selectins (7Needham L.K. Schnaar R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1359-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). There are also indications that the HNK-1 carbohydrate is involved in the maintenance of the blood-brain barrier (8Kanda T. Yamawaki M. Ariga T. Yu R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7897-7901Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Differential expression of the epitope in motor and sensory axons of the femoral nerve in adult mice appears to be responsible for guidance of regenerating axons after a lesion. 1T. M. Brushart, R. Martini, and M. Schachner, unpublished observations. Furthermore, the HNK-1 carbohydrate represents a molecular memory of degenerating myelinating Schwann cells associated with the motor axons before the lesion (9Martini R. Xin Y. Schmitz B. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1992; 4: 628-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The HNK-1 epitope is found on the single N-glycan of P0, the glycoprotein which is responsible for formation and maintenance of peripheral myelin (10Giese K.P. Martini R. Lemke G. Soriano P. Schachner M. Cell. 1992; 71: 565-576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Carbohydrates containing the HNK-1 determinant appear to be of functional importance for P0, since this glycoprotein loses its adhesive properties, when the biosynthesis of complex-type carbohydrates is blocked (11Filbin M.T. Tennekoon G.H. Neuron. 1991; 7: 845-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 12Filbin M.T. Tennekoon G.H. J. Cell. Biol. 1993; 122: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Moreover, there is evidence that homophilic binding between P0 molecules is partly mediated by a lectin-like interaction between P0 and the HNK-1 carbohydrate (13Griffith L.S. Schmitz B. Schachner M. J. Neurosci. Res. 1992; 33: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). So far, detailed information on the carbohydrate structure of the epitope has been restricted to the glycolipid-bound form (14Chou D.K. Ilyas A.A. Evans J.E. Costello C. Quarles R.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11717-11725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Attempts to identify the HNK-1 carbohydrate on glycoproteins, using mass spectrometry (15Uyemura K. Kitamura K. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1991; 98C: 63-72Google Scholar) or various chromatographic techniques (16Field M.C. Wing D.R. Dwek R.A. Rademacher T.W. Schmitz B. Bollensen E. Schachner M. J.

Simon M. Steck A.J. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 53-853Google Scholar), have not provided the conclusive data that are necessary for a rigorous elucidation of its role in development and disease. In this study, we describe the structure of the major HNK-1 reactive oligosaccharide of bovine P0. Bovine sciatic nerves (40 g) were ground to a fine powder under liquid nitrogen and suspended in 250 ml of a 0.29 sucrose solution. The suspension was layered in 25-ml aliquots over 15 ml of 0.85 sucrose and centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g at 4°C. Myelin was collected from the interface between the two sucrose layers and washed twice with H2O to remove sucrose. The myelin was delipidated by two extractions with chloroform/methanol. The methanol/water phase with the precipitated protein was collected and dried by evaporation under reduced pressure. The delipidated myelin was quickly frozen in and homogenized under liquid nitrogen. After suspension in 100 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (10 m phosphate, 150 m NaCl, pH 7.4) with 1% SDS, the mixture was heated for 10 min at 100°C and incubated at room temperature under continuous mixing. After 16-40 h, the myelin suspension was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 × g to remove undissolved material and concentrated by ultrafiltration (YM10 membrane, Amicon). P0 was purified from the solubilized myelin proteins by sequential gel filtration on a 50 × 1.6-cm Superose 12 prep grade column and on a 60 × 1.6-cm Superdex 75 prep grade column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.), run in phosphate-buffered saline with 0.1% SDS. After adding SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol (0.5% each), the purified P0 preparation (1-2.5 mg/ml) was boiled for 5 min, diluted 1:1 with enzyme buffer (50 m Tris-HCl, 50 m EDTA, pH 8.4) containing 2% Nonidet P-40, and treated with 1 unit/ml PNGase F 2The abbreviations used are: PNGase Fpeptide-N4-(N-acetyl-β-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidaseHPAEChigh pH anion-exchange chromatographyROErotating frame nuclear Overhauser enhancementTOCSYtotal correlated spectroscopy. (EC, Boehringer Mannheim) for 20-40 h at room temperature. To remove proteins and non-ionic detergents, the PNGase F digest was extracted twice with chloroform/methanol. The combined water/methanol phases were dried and desalted on Bio-Gel P2 (Bio-Rad). Further fractionation, by high pH anion-exchange chromatography (HPAEC) (19Hardy M.R. Townsend R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), was performed using a CarboPac PA 100 column (Dionex DX-500 system, Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA) with a 30-ml gradient from 100 m to 600 m sodium acetate in 0.1 NaOH. Corresponding fractions from different runs were pooled, neutralized, and desalted on P2. peptide-N4-(N-acetyl-β-glucosaminyl)asparagine amidase high pH anion-exchange chromatography rotating frame nuclear Overhauser enhancement total correlated spectroscopy. For immunostaining, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Optimal transfer of P0 was observed in a transfer buffer containing 27 m sodium phosphate and 10% methanol, pH 6.5. To test their HNK-1 reactivity, glycans isolated from P0 were coupled to BSA by reductive amination (20Needham L.K. Schnaar R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The HNK-1 epitope was detected with the 412 (L2) (21Kruse J. Mailhammer R. Wernecke H. Faissner A. Sommer I. Goridis C. Schachner M. Nature. 1984; 311: 153-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) HNK-1 monoclonal antibody. Prior to NMR-spectroscopic analysis in 2H2O, samples were exchanged twice in 99.9%2H2O with intermediate lyophilization and finally dissolved in 450 μl of 99.96%2H2O (Isotec). 1H NMR measurements were carried out on a Bruker AMX-500 or AMX-600 spectrometer (Bijvoet Center, Department of NMR Spectroscopy, Utrecht University). The 1HO2H signal was suppressed by presaturating for 0.8-1 s. Experiments were performed at a probe temperature of 285 K unless indicated otherwise. Chemical shifts (δ) are expressed by reference to internal acetone (δ 2.225 ppm). To achieve phase sensitive detection in the t1 direction, the TPPI method (22Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar) was applied. two-dimensional spectra were recorded with 400-600 t1 experiments, and 96-152 (8-24 for trisaccharide) free induction decays of 2048 data points were collected per t1 experiment. Data sets were processed using Bruker UXNMR software. In short, time-domain data were multiplied with a shifted squared sine bell function. After zero-filling and Fourier transformation, the resulting data sets of 1024 × 1024 (or 2048 × 2048) data points were base-line corrected in both frequency domains by fifth order polynomial fits. Two-dimensional TOCSY spectra were recorded using a “clean” MLEV-17 spin-lock pulse sequence of 100 ms preceded by a 2.5-ms trim-pulse (23Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3112) Google Scholar, 24Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar, 25Griesinger C. Otting G. Wüthrich K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7870-7872Crossref Scopus (1199) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional ROE spectra (26Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 63: 207-213Google Scholar) were recorded at a field strength of 2.3 kHz with the offset at 5.5 ppm and a spin lock time of 150 ms (or 300 ms for the trisaccharide). Fraction D8 of the HPAEC separation was treated with β-N-acetylhexosaminidase (EC; from Streptococcus pneumoniae, Oxford Glycosystems) for 16 h at 37°C, according to the manufacturer's instructions. The ratio of enzyme to substrate was lowered to approximately 15 milliunits of enzyme for 70 nmol of glycan (amount estimated from NMR spectra). Glycans were separated from BSA (from the enzyme preparation) and salts by gel filtration. P0 was extracted from bovine sciatic nerve and purified by repeated gel filtration to a final purity of more than 90% (Fig. 1A). Enzymic deglycosylation of P0 with PNGase F was quantitative, judging from the 2-kDa shift in mobility on SDS-PAGE and the virtual disappearance of reactivity with HNK-1 monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 1, A and B). After separation from the protein, the carbohydrate pool was fractionated by high pH anion-exchange chromatography (19Hardy M.R. Townsend R.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 208-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), resulting in five major (10-25% each) and three minor (<5% each) fractions (data not shown). One-dimensional 500 MHz 1H-NMR spectroscopy 3C. W. E. M. van Zuylen, H. Voshol, M. Schachner, and J. F. G. Vliegenthart, manuscript in preparation. showed that three of the major carbohydrate fractions contained structural reporter group resonances, similar to the SO4-3GlcA element of the synthetic HNK-1 reactive trisaccharide YM677 (SO4-3GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc), prepared by Ogawa and co-workers (27Schmitz B. Schachner M. Ito Y. Nakano T. Ogawa T. Glycoconj. J. 1994; 11: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). At this stage of the purification, one of the three fractions, designated D8, was homogeneous, as judged from the NMR spectrum. To confirm its HNK-1 immunoreactivity, D8 was coupled to bovine serum albumin and reacted with two independent monoclonal antibodies to HNK-1 (Fig. 1C). Further structural analysis using combined one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy was carried out with fraction D8 (Fig. 2 and Table I).Fig. 2Analysis of the HNK-1 carbohydrate structure by TOCSY. Parts of TOCSY spectra, recorded at 500 MHz, are shown of D8 (A) and of the synthetic trisaccharide YM677 (B).

Open table in a new tab The structural reporter group (28Vliegenthart J.F.G. Dorland L. Halbeek H. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1983; 41: 209-374Crossref Scopus (797) Google Scholar) signals of D8 show that this oligosaccharide contains two modifications of the common Asn-linked pentasaccharide core (Fig. 3): a fucose α1-6 linked to the first N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and a so-called bisecting GlcNAc, linked to the first core mannose (Man) as a third extension (29Hård K. Damm J.B.L. Spruijt M.P.N. Bergwerff A.A. Van Dedem G.W.K. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 785-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The two outermost Mans are both substituted with an additional GlcNAc. This basic structure can be deduced from the chemical shifts of H-1 and H-2 of Man-3/Man-4, H-1 of Man-4′ and H-1, H-4, H-5 and NAc, of GlcNAc-9 (Table I), which are comparable to those of a diantennary structure with a bisecting GlcNAc (29Hård K. Damm J.B.L. Spruijt M.P.N. Bergwerff A.A. Van Dedem G.W.K. Kamerling J.P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 785-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The trisaccharide YM677 provided the necessary reference data for the assignment of terminal SO4-3GlcAβ1-3Gal linked to GlcNAc. Analysis of two-dimensional NMR spectra of YM677 and D8 reveals identical spin patterns in both compounds, confirming that the HNK-1 trisaccharide element is present in D8 (Table I and Fig. 2). In order to determine the branch location of SO4-3GlcAβ1-3Gal, D8 was treated with hexosaminidase, which removes unsubstituted GlcNAcs (Fig. 3). A two-dimensional TOCSY spectrum of this sample (Fig. 2) showed the disappearance of the signals corresponding to GlcNAc-5 and GlcNAc-9 (Fig. 3) and changes in the chemical shifts of the core mannoses (3, 4, and 4′). The chemical shifts are now in agreement with a structure, in which only Man 4′ is extended (30Grey A.A. Narasimhan S. Brisson J.R. Schachter H. Carver J.P. Can. J. Biochem. 1982; 60: 1123-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This points to the location of the HNK-1 epitope in the α1-6-linked branch. This is confirmed by ROE contacts that prove the sequential linkages from GlcA to Gal-6′ to GlcNAc-5′ to Man-4′ (Table I). For further confirmation of the structure deduced from the NMR data, an aliquot of D8 was permethylated and analyzed using positive-mode fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry. The most intense pseudomolecular ion was observed at m/z 2552.49 corresponding to M + Na −1 Me of the permethylated deduced structure. Some less intense pseudomolecular ions, stemming from multiply undermethylated structures, were also detectable. In this study we present the complete structure of an N-glycan carrying the HNK-1 epitope, isolated from the immunoglobulin superfamily recognition molecule P0 from bovine peripheral nervous system. This is the first structure of an integral glycoprotein-derived HNK-1 carbohydrate chain that has been firmly established by NMR parameters. Comparison of this P0-derived structure with the carbohydrate structure of the HNK-1-containing glycolipids (14Chou D.K. Ilyas A.A. Evans J.E. Costello C. Quarles R.H. Jungalwala F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 11717-11725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) shows that they have a sulfated trisaccharide, corresponding to the reference trisaccharide YM677 (Fig. 3), in common. Apparently, since it is the only common element, this trisaccharide is sufficient for reactivity with the HNK-1 antibodies. Schmitz et al. (27Schmitz B. Schachner M. Ito Y. Nakano T. Ogawa T. Glycoconj. J. 1994; 11: 345-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) describe this part of the glycolipid-derived structure to be responsible for biological activity, whereas a glycolipid with only a sulfated glucuronic acid is inactive. Whether the “backbone” part of the oligosaccharide is of functional significance remains to be clarified. The HNK-1 epitope is prominently expressed on P0, since approximately 80% of all P0 molecules from bovine sciatic nerve have HNK-1-reactive oligosaccharides.3 The single N-glycosylation site of P0 carries the HNK-1 carbohydrate on three or four different glycans,3 of which the most predominant one was analyzed in the present study. The degree of HNK-1 substitution of the P0 glycans is highly relevant, since its putative function, maintaining the structural integrity of myelin by homophilic adhesion, depends on its glycosylation status (see Introduction). Previous data (31Brunden K.R. J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 1659-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) indicate that the carbohydrate composition of rat P0 varies with age, suggesting that the expression of the HNK-1 epitope could be varied to accommodate for alterations in external requirements. In contrast to its highly homologous counterparts from human, rat, and bovine, P0 from the mouse is not HNK-1 reactive, even though the carbohydrate is expressed in peripheral myelin (32Löw K. Orberger G. Schmitz B. Martini R. Schachner M. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1994; 6: 1773-1781Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It is tempting to speculate that, when an HNK-1 epitope is functionally important for a particular glycoprotein in several animal species, structurally related carbohydrates, which are not recognized by HNK-1 antibodies, serve as structural and functional substitutes in cases where no HNK-1 reactivity is observed. These structures will await further elucidation. Knowledge of the carbohydrate structure of the HNK-1 epitope now opens the way for further steps in the elucidation of the involvement of this carbohydrate in recognition processes and for analysis of the glycosyltransferases involved in its biosynthesis. With respect to the latter aspect, it should be noted that different glucuronyltransferases appear to be involved in the biosynthesis of the glycolipid- and glycoprotein-bound forms of the epitope (33Oka S. Terayama K. Kawashima C. Kawasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22711-22714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the linkage of glucuronic acid to lactosamine is the same in both forms, this suggests that other structural or environmental factors play a role in acceptor recognition by the glucuronyltransferase. Furthermore, by modifying the carbohydrate structure, one can now study the structural requirements for the function of the HNK-1 carbohydrate in terms of molecular details. Since autoimmunoreactivity against the HNK-1 epitope is responsible for damage to nervous tissue in demyelinating neuropathies (see Introduction), compounds that block the binding site of the autoantibodies to HNK-1 have potential therapeutic applications. Obviously, the HNK-1 trisaccharide YM677 could be used for this purpose, but the disadvantage of this compound, and of oligosaccharides in general, is that their chemical synthesis is a laborious enterprise. This problem could be solved by trying to find a “minimal” structure, which is less complex and easier to prepare, but which retains high affinity for the autoantibodies. Further structural studies of HNK-1 oligosaccharides and the functionally relevant HNK-1 related carbohydrates might provide clues for the development of such functional “mimics.” On the other hand, as soon as glycosyltransferases to produce the HNK-1 structure enzymically are available, application of HNK-1 carbohydrates as therapeutic compounds in autoimmune demyelinating neuropathies represents a feasible option. We thank Prof. T. Ogawa for the generous gift of the YM677 trisaccharide and Dr. J. Thomas-Oates for help with the mass spectrometry. Bovine sciatic nerves were obtained from the Schlachthof Hinwil with the kind help of Dr. Schmidt."

https://openalex.org/W2011262627,"We have examined the determinants of the translational repression of mRNA by the Xenopus oocyte-specific Y-box protein FRGY2 using in vitro and in vivo assays. In vitro reconstitution of messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) complexes demonstrates that the sequence-specific RNA-binding cold shock domain is not required for translational repression, whereas the RNA-binding C-terminal tail domain is essential. However, microinjection of reconstituted mRNPs into Xenopus oocytes demonstrates that although translational repression occurs in the absence of consensus RNA binding sequences for FRGY2, the presence of FRGY2 recognition elements within mRNA potentiates translational repression. Analysis of the in vivo assembly of mRNP shows that the cold shock domain alone is not stably incorporated into mRNP, whereas the C-terminal tail domain is sufficient for stable incorporation. We suggest that translational repression of mRNA by FRGY2 is favored by sequence-selective recognition of RNA sequences by the cold shock domain. However, translational repression in vitro and the assembly of mRNP in vivo requires the relatively nonspecific interaction of the C-terminal tail domain with mRNA.

INTRODUCTIONTranslational control of gene expression is particularly important during early metazoan development (Davidson, 9Davidson E.H. Gene Activity in Early Development.

The molecular mechanisms that determine the translational repression (masking) of maternal mRNA are only partially defined. Much attention has focused on the role of regulated polyadenylation of mRNA as a means of controlling translation in the Xenopus oocyte (Jackson and Standart, 14Jackson R.J. Standart N.

Cytoplasmic adenylation of mRNA has a major role in the activation (unmasking) of particular maternal mRNAs on oocyte maturation (Wickens, 37Wickens M. Semin. Dev.

An additional contribution to translational repression derives from the packaging of maternal mRNA with RNA-binding proteins including the Y-box proteins (Standart and Jackson, 32Standart N.

Franke W.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11-15Google Scholar; Tafuri and Wolffe, 33Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9028-9032Google Scholar). The FRGY2 protein was originally identified as an oocyte-specific transcription factor that associates with the Y-box, a regulatory element found in the promoters of genes that are selectively active in oocytes (Tafuri and Wolffe, 33Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9028-9032Google Scholar, 34Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. New Biol. 1992; 4: 349-359Google Scholar; Wolffe et al., 42Wolffe A.P. Tafuri S. Ranjan M. Familari M. New Biol. 1992; 4: 290-298Google Scholar). Thus FRGY2 might be an example of a multifunctional protein capable of associating with DNA and RNA, comparable to the role of TFIIIA in the synthesis and storage of 5 S rRNA (Wolffe and Brown, 40Wolffe A.P. Brown D.D. Science. 1988; 241: 1626-1632Google Scholar).An active role for FRGY2 in masking mRNA is suggested from several independent experiments. The reconstitution of FRGY2 with mRNA in vitro represses translation (Richter and Smith, 25Richter J.D. Smith L.D. Nature. 1984; 309: 378-380Google Scholar; Kick et al., 15Kick D. Barrett P. Cummings A. Sommerville J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 4099-4109Google Scholar). Expression of FRGY2 in somatic cells leads to both an increase in mRNA accumulation from promoters containing a Y-box and the translational silencing of that mRNA (Ranjan et al., 24Ranjan M. Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1725-1736Google Scholar). Overexpression of FRGY2 in the Xenopus oocyte facilitates the silencing of mRNA synthesized in vivo (Bouvet and Wolffe, 2Bouvet P. Wolffe A.P. Cell. 1994; 77: 931-941Google Scholar). Antibodies that bind the FRGY2 family of proteins relieve the inhibition of translation when introduced into a Xenopus oocyte (Braddock et al., 4Braddock M. Muckenthaler M. White M.R.H. Thorburn A.M. Sommerville J. Kingsman A.J. Kingsman S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5255-5264Google Scholar; Gunkel et al., 13Gunkel N. Braddock M. Thorburn A.M. Muckenthaler M. Kingsman A.J. Kingsman S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 405-412Google Scholar).The FRGY2 protein has a modular structure containing an amino (N)-terminal nucleic acid binding cold shock domain (CSD) that is conserved between prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (Wolffe, 38Wolffe A.P. Bioessays. 1994; 16: 245-251Google Scholar). The CSD consists of a five-stranded β-barrel containing a well characterized RNA binding motif RNP-1 (Schindelin et al., 26Schindelin H. Marahiel M.A. Heinemann U. Nature. 1993; 364: 164-168Google Scholar; Schnuchel et al., 27Schnuchel A. Wiltscheck R. Czisch M. Herrier M. Willimsky G. Graumann P. Marahiel M.A. Holak T.A.

The CSD confers sequence-specific RNA recognition to the FRGY2 protein (Bouvet et al., 3Bouvet P. Matsumoto K. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28297-28303Google Scholar). The carboxyl (C)-terminal tail domain of FRGY2 also interacts with RNA (Murray, 21Murray M.T. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13910-13917Google Scholar). However, this interaction shows no apparent sequence selectivity (Bouvet et al., 3Bouvet P. Matsumoto K. Wolffe A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28297-28303Google Scholar). The C-terminal tail domain contains islands of basic/aromatic amino acids and of acidic amino acids containing sites of phosphorylation (Tafuri and Wolffe, 33Tafuri S.R. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9028-9032Google Scholar; Sommerville, 28Sommerville J. Bioessays. 1992; 14: 337-339Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of FRGY2 has been implicated in the repression of translation (Kick et al., 15Kick D. Barrett P. Cummings A. Sommerville J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 4099-4109Google Scholar; Murray et al., 22Murray M.T. Krohne G. Franke W.W. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 1-11Google Scholar).In this work we have explored the determinants of translational repression by FRGY2. We make use of in vitro reconstitution of FRGY2 interactions with mRNA and in vitro translation to demonstrate a major role for the tail domain in this translational repression. We establish that FRGY2 can bind selectively to specific sequences in vivo, but find that although this selectivity augments translational repression, it is not essential for the translational repression of mRNA following injection of naked mRNA or reconstituted mRNPs into the Xenopus oocyte. Finally, we examine the role of the individual domains of FRGY2 in the assembly of mRNP in vivo. We find that the tail domain is essential for the stable incorporation of exogenous FRGY2 into mRNPs. Our results provide evidence for an essential role for the tail domain in stabilizing the interaction of FRGY2 with mRNA in vivo and in directing the translational repression of mRNA in vitro. INTRODUCTIONTranslational control of gene expression is particularly important during early metazoan development (Davidson, 9Davidson E.H. Gene Activity in Early Development.

The molecular mechanisms that determine the translational repression (masking) of maternal mRNA are only partially defined. Much attention has focused on the role of regulated polyadenylation of mRNA as a means of controlling translation in the Xenopus oocyte (Jackson and Standart, 14Jackson R.J. Standart N.

Cytoplasmic adenylation of mRNA has a major role in the activation (unmasking) of particular maternal mRNAs on oocyte maturation (Wickens, 37Wickens M. Semin. Dev. Biol. 1992; 3: 399-412Google Scholar). An additional contribution to translational repression derives from the packaging of maternal mRNA with RNA-binding proteins including the Y-box proteins (Standart and Jackson, 32Standart N.

https://openalex.org/W2112748791,"Several proinflammatory cytokines can increase prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) synthesis in a variety of cell types, constituting an important component of the inflammatory response. We demonstrate here that leukoregulin, a 50-kDa product of activated T lymphocytes, dramatically increases PGE2 synthesis in cultured human orbital fibroblasts. This up-regulation is mediated through an induction of prostaglandin-endoperoxide H synthase-2 (PGHS-2), the inflammatory cyclooxygenase. Steady-state levels of PGHS-2 mRNA are increased within 1.5 h of leukoregulin addition and are near maximal by 6 h, when they are 50-fold or higher above basal levels. The increase in PGHS-2 mRNA levels is partially blocked by cycloheximide, suggesting de novo synthesis of an intermediate protein may be required for a maximal leukoregulin response. Nuclear run-on studies indicate PGHS-2 gene transcription is up-regulated by leukoregulin 2-fold after 2 and 6 h. PGHS-2 protein, as assessed by Western blotting and two-dimensional protein gel analysis, is increased dramatically in orbital fibroblasts. This lymphokine-dependent expression of PGHS-2 is blocked by dexamethasone, and the increase in PGE2 and cAMP levels following leukoregulin treatment is also blocked by indomethacin and by SC 58125, a newly developed PGHS-2-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor. The dramatic increase in cAMP levels causes marked alteration in orbital fibroblast morphology. PGHS-2 expression in dermal fibroblasts is also increased by leukoregulin; however, the response is considerably less robust, and these cells do not undergo a change in morphology. Both orbital and dermal fibroblasts express high levels of PGHS-1 mRNA and protein, the other abundant form of cyclooxygenase. In contrast to its effects on PGHS-2 expression, leukoregulin fails to alter PGHS-1 levels in either orbital or dermal fibroblasts, suggesting that PGHS-1 is not involved in cytokine-dependent prostanoid production in human fibroblasts. The increased PGHS-2 expression elicited by leukoregulin in orbital fibroblasts may be a consequence of both transcriptional and post-transcriptional effects. These observations help clarify the pathogenic mechanism relevant to the intense inflammation associated with Graves' ophthalmopathy. Lymphocytes trafficked to orbital tissues have a putative role, through the cytokines they release, in the activation of fibroblasts in this autoimmune disease.

https://openalex.org/W1996989066,"Inverse agonists are ligands that are capable of repressing basal receptor activity in the absence of an agonist. We have designed a series of C-1-substituted acetylenic retinoids that exhibit potent antagonism of retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-mediated transactivation. Comparison of these related retinoid antagonists for their ability to repress basal RAR transcriptional activity demonstrates that the identity of the C-1 substituent differentiates these ligands into two groups: RAR inverse agonists and neutral antagonists. We show that treatment of cultured human keratinocytes with a RAR inverse agonist, but not a RAR neutral antagonist, leads to the repression of the serum-induced differentiation marker MRP-8. While RAR-selective agonists also repress expression of MRP-8, cotreatment with a RAR inverse agonist and a RAR agonist results in a mutual repression of their individual inhibitory activities, indicating the distinct modes of action of these two disparate retinoids in modulating MRP-8 expression. Our data indicate that RARs, like β<sub>2</sub>-adrenoreceptors, are sensitive to inverse agonists and that this new class of retinoids will provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of RAR function in skin and other responsive tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1976798101,"Macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions accumulate free cholesterol (FC) as well as cholesteryl ester and appear to have high rates of phospholipid (PL) synthesis and increased PL mass. Previous short term (i.e. ≤24 h) studies with cultured macrophages have shown that these cells respond to FC loading by up-regulating phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis. We propose that this response is adaptive by keeping the FC:PL ratio in the macrophages from reaching toxic levels. We further propose that one cause of macrophage necrosis, a prominent and important event in atherosclerosis, is an eventual decrease of this adaptive response. To explore these ideas, cultured macrophages were loaded with FC for up to 4 days and assayed for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, FC and PL mass, and cytotoxicity. For the first 24 h, cellular phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis and FC and PL mass increased 3-4-fold, and thus the FC:PL molar ratio was prevented from reaching very high levels; at this point, there were no overt signs of cytotoxicity. Over the next 24-48 h, however, phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, and then phosphatidylcholine mass, began to decrease. Initially, the macrophages remained healthy and continued to accumulate FC, but eventually these macrophages, but not unloaded macrophages, became necrotic (swollen organelles and disrupted membranes). Lipoprotein dose studies indicated a close relationship between the onset of macrophage necrosis and the FC:PL ratio. To test further the causal nature of these relationships, cellular FC and PL mass were independently manipulated by using high density lipoprotein3 (HDL3) to decrease cellular FC and choline depletion to decrease cellular PC. As predicted by our hypotheses, HDL3 protected FC-loaded macrophages from necrosis, whereas choline depletion accelerated cytotoxic changes. These findings support the idea that the initial increase in phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in FC-loaded macrophages is an adaptive response that prevents cholesterol-induced macrophage necrosis. We propose that an eventual failure of the PL response in foam cells may represent one cause of macrophage necrosis in advanced atherosclerotic lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2077696520,"Bax, a member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins, has been shown to promote apoptosis while other members of the family, including Bcl-XL and Bcl-2, inhibit cell death induced by a variety of stimuli. The mechanism by which Bax promotes cell death is poorly understood. In the present report, we assessed the ability of Bax to antagonize the death repressor activity of Bcl-XL during chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in the lymphoid cell line, FL5.12. Expression of wild-type Bax countered the repressor activity of Bcl-XL against cell death mediated by VP-16 and cisplatin. We performed site-directed mutagenesis of the BH1, BH2, and BH3 homology regions in Bax to determine the ability of wild-type and mutant Bax to heterodimerize with Bcl-XL and to antagonize the protective effect of Bcl-XL against chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Bax proteins expressing alanine substitutions of the highly conserved amino acids glycine 108 in BH1, tryptophan 151 and 158 in BH2, and glycine 67 and aspartic acid 68 in BH3 retained their ability to promote chemotherapy-induced cell death that was inhibited by Bcl-XL and to form heterodimers with Bcl-XL. Bax proteins containing deletions of the most highly conserved amino acids in BH1 (Delta102-112) and BH2 (Delta151-159) maintained the ability of Bax to antagonize the death repressor activity of Bcl-XL and to associate with Bcl-XL. However, Bax with BH3 deleted did not form heterodimers with Bcl-XL, but retained its ability to counter the death repressor activity of Bcl-XL. These results demonstrate that the conserved BH3, but not BH1 or BH2, homology region of Bax is necessary for its interaction with Bcl-XL in mammalian cells. Furthermore, our results indicate that Bax does not require BH1, BH2, BH3, or heterodimerization with Bcl-XL to counter the death repressor activity of Bcl-XL. Therefore, Bax can antagonize Bcl-XL during VP-16 and, in a lesser degree, during cisplatin-induced cell death independent of its heterodimerization with Bcl-XL."
https://openalex.org/W2043213039,"The urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) is a membrane protein comprised of three extracellular domains. In order to study the importance of this domain organization in the ligand-binding process of the receptor we subjected a recombinant, soluble uPAR (suPAR) to specific proteolytic cleavages leading to liberation of single domains. Treatment of the receptor with pepsin resulted in cleavage between residues 183 and 184, thus separating the third domain (D3) from the rest of the molecule, which was left as an intact fragment (D(1 + 2)). D(1 + 2) proved capable of ligand binding as shown by chemical cross-linking, but quantitative binding/competition studies showed that the apparent ligand affinity was 100- to 1000-fold lower than that of the intact suPAR. This loss of affinity was comparable with the loss found after cleavage between the first domain (D1) and D(2 + 3), using chymotrypsin. This result shows that in addition to D1, which has an established function in ligand binding (Behrendt, N., Ploug, M., Patthy, L., Houen, G., Blasi, F., and Danø, K. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 7842-7847), D3 has an important role in governing a high affinity in the intact receptor. Real-time biomolecular interaction analysis revealed that the decrease in affinity was caused mostly by an increased dissociation rate of the ligand complex of D(1 + 2). Zero length cross-linking, using carbodiimide-induced, direct condensation, was used to identify regions within suPAR engaged in molecular ligand contact. The purified suPAR was cross-linked to the radiolabeled amino-terminal fragment (ATF) of urokinase, followed by cleavage with chymotrypsin. In accordance with the cleavage pattern found for the uncomplexed receptor, this treatment led to cleavage between D1 and D(2 + 3). Analysis of the radiolabeled fragments revealed the expected ligand labeling of D1 but a clear labeling of D(2 + 3) was also found, indicating that this part of the molecule is also situated in close contact with ATF in the receptor-ligand complex. The latter contact site may contribute to the role of molecular regions outside D1 in high affinity binding.

The proteolytic cascade system of plasminogen activation is an important mechanism in extracellular tissue degradation processes that occur in cancer invasion as well as in certain normal tissue remodeling processes (1Danø K. Andreasen P.A. Grøndahl-Hansen J. Kristensen P. Nielsen L.S. Skriver L. Adv. Cancer Res. 1985; 44: 139-266Google Scholar). The interaction between the urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) 1The abbreviations used are: uPAurokinase plasminogen activatoruPARuPA receptorsuPARsoluble uPAR (residue 1-277)ATFamino-terminal fragment (residue 6-135) of uPAPBSphosphate-buffered salineHPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyDSSN,N′-disuccinimidylsuberatePAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisEDC1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride. and the cellular uPA receptor (uPAR) is a key event in this reaction sequence, since it is decisive for the localization of the activation processes and furthermore leads to cascade amplification (2Danø K.

Fibrinolysis. 1994; 8 (Suppl. 1): 189-203Google Scholar). urokinase plasminogen activator uPA receptor soluble uPAR (residue 1-277) amino-terminal fragment (residue 6-135) of uPA phosphate-buffered saline high performance liquid chromatography N,N′-disuccinimidylsuberate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride. The functional importance of this binding reaction makes it a potential target for interference with cancer invasion, either alone or in conjunction with inhibition of other extracellular proteolytic systems. The first reagents with inhibitory effect against the uPA-uPAR interaction, being valuable primarily as research tools, have been identified already (3Behrendt N. Rønne E. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5985-5989Google Scholar, 4Goodson R.J. Doyle M.V. Kaufman S.E. Rosenberg S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7129-7133Google Scholar). Increased knowledge of the structure-function relationship of the receptor binding reaction is likely to assist further development along this line. uPAR is a highly glycosylated membrane protein composed of three homologous domains with a structure defining a distinct protein family (5Behrendt N. Rønne E. Ploug M. Petri T. Løber D. Nielsen L.S. Schleuning W.-D. Blasi F. Appella E. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6453-6460Google Scholar, 6Behrendt N. Ploug M. Patthy L. Houen G. Blasi F. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7842-7847Google Scholar, 7Ploug M. Kjalke M. Rønne E. Weidle U. Høyer-Hansen G. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17539-17546Google Scholar, 8Ploug M. Ellis V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 163-168Google Scholar). The receptor has no intracellular region but is anchored in the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety (9Ploug M. Rønne E. Behrendt N. Jensen A.L. Blasi F. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1926-1933Google Scholar) that is covalently linked to the last residue of the third domain. Referring to the sequence derived from cDNA (10Roldan A.L. Cubellis M.V. Masucci M.T. Behrendt N. Lund L.R. Danø K. Appella E. Blasi F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 467-474Google Scholar), the sequence of the mature uPAR probably extends to Gly283 (the likely residue of glycosylphosphatidylinositol attachment (11Møller L.B. Ploug M. Blasi F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 493-500Google Scholar)). However, binding studies in solution are conveniently done using a soluble uPAR mutant protein (suPAR, residues 1-277) that has the same ligand affinity as the membrane-bound uPAR (12Ploug M. Ellis V. Danø K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8991-8997Google Scholar). Early studies of the domain structure of uPAR showed that the first domain (D1, residues 1-87) could be liberated with chymotrypsin and could subsequently bind to the receptor-binding region (the amino-terminal fragment, ATF) of uPA as shown by chemical cross-linking with a homobifunctional, amino-reactive reagent (6Behrendt N. Ploug M. Patthy L. Houen G. Blasi F. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7842-7847Google Scholar). Recently, studies on the binding determinants have been extended to show that a specific tyrosine residue in D1, number 57, becomes protected against chemical modification upon ligand complex formation (13Ploug M. Rahbek-Nielsen H. Ellis V. Roepstorff P. Danø K. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 12524-12534Google Scholar). However, it has also become clear that the isolated D1 has a much lower ligand affinity than the intact uPAR (12Ploug M. Ellis V. Danø K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8991-8997Google Scholar), indicating that the rest of the protein is also important for high affinity binding. The molecular mechanism underlying this phenomenon is not known. In order to obtain a better understanding of the structural background for ligand binding, we have now studied the functional properties of other fragments of uPAR, and in addition we demonstrate the existence of a potential ligand contact site outside D1. suPAR was isolated from the culture medium of transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells by immunoaffinity chromatography as described (7Ploug M. Kjalke M. Rønne E. Weidle U. Høyer-Hansen G. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17539-17546Google Scholar) and subsequently subjected to gel filtration on a Superdex 75 prep grade column (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden), using PBS as the eluent, for removal of trace contents of IgG. Human two-chain uPA was purchased from Serono, Aubonne, Switzerland. ATF (residues 6-135 of human uPA) was a kind gift from Dr. A. Mazar, Abbott Laboratories, IL. ATF was labeled with 125I as published previously (5Behrendt N. Rønne E. Ploug M. Petri T. Løber D. Nielsen L.S. Schleuning W.-D. Blasi F. Appella E. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6453-6460Google Scholar), except that the time of iodination was limited to 10 min. Monoclonal antibodies against defined fragments of uPAR were from clones described previously, i.e. anti-uPAR R5, directed against D1 (14Rønne E. Høyer-Hansen G. Brünner N. Pedersen H. Rank F. Osborne C.K. Clark G.M. Danø K. Grøndahl-Hansen J. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1995; 33: 199-207Google Scholar), and anti-uPAR R2, directed against D(2 + 3) (15Rønne E. Behrendt N. Ellis V. Ploug M. Danø K. Høyer-Hansen G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 233-236Google Scholar). Porcine pepsin (3670 units/mg protein) and bovine chymotrypsin (68 units/mg protein) were purchased from Sigma and Worthington, respectively. Samples to be used for studies on the specificity of zero length cross-linking were prepared from U937 cells after stimulation with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (16Nielsen L.S. Kellerman G.M. Behrendt N. Picone R. Danø K. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2358-2363Google Scholar). Lysis of the cells in Triton X-114 followed by temperature-dependent detergent phase separation were performed as described (17Behrendt N. Ploug M. Rønne E. Høyer-Hansen G. Danø K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 223: 207-222Google Scholar). The detergent phase, containing uPAR as shown previously (5Behrendt N. Rønne E. Ploug M. Petri T. Løber D. Nielsen L.S. Schleuning W.-D. Blasi F. Appella E. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6453-6460Google Scholar), was isolated. For digestion with pepsin, a 1000-µl sample of suPAR (670 µg/ml in PBS, obtained after gel filtration as above) was acidified by addition of 110 µl of 0.5 M acetic acid. Pepsin (a freshly prepared 1 µg/ml solution in 0.05 M acetic acid) was added to the sample to yield a final concentration of 0.1 µg/ml at pH 3.9. The sample was incubated for 2 h at 37°C, after which the solution was neutralized by addition of 410 µl of 1 M Tris/HCl, pH 8.1, for termination of the reaction. Chymotryptic fragments of suPAR (D1 and D(2 + 3)) were prepared according to Ref. 7Ploug M. Kjalke M. Rønne E. Weidle U. Høyer-Hansen G. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17539-17546Google Scholar with minor modifications. Before digestion, immunoaffinity purified suPAR was dialyzed against 0.1% acetic acid, lyophilized, and reconstituted in 0.05 M Tris/HCl, pH 8.1, to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml. Chymotrypsin (final concentration 0.1 µg/ml) was added, followed by incubation for 4 h at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (2 mM). Gel filtration of cleavage products was done as described (7Ploug M. Kjalke M. Rønne E. Weidle U. Høyer-Hansen G. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17539-17546Google Scholar), using PBS and 0.1 M NH4HCO3 as the elution buffers for purification of peptic and chymotryptic fragments, respectively. Fractions containing the domains of interest were identified by SDS-PAGE, acidified with trifluoroacetic acid, and further purified by reversed-phase HPLC on a Pro-RPC HR 5/2 column (Pharmacia Biotech). This chromatographic step was performed by gradient elution from solvent A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O, pH 1.9) to solvent B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 70% 2-propanol). Since the fragments under study eluted in the interval between 20 and 30% B-solvent, the elution system was designed as a broken gradient including a low-slope segment covering this region (linear increase from 20 to 30% solvent B in the interval from 20 to 80 min). For homobifunctional cross-linking and ligand competition studies, purified suPAR or fragments thereof were diluted in PBS with 0.1% Tween 80 and incubated with 125I-labeled ATF for 1 h at 4°C followed by cross-linking with N,N′-disuccinimidylsuberate (DSS) as described (17Behrendt N. Ploug M. Rønne E. Høyer-Hansen G. Danø K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 223: 207-222Google Scholar). In some experiments, varying amounts of unlabeled ATF or uPA were premixed with the labeled ligand. After SDS-PAGE (see below) and autoradiography the results of competition studies were quantified by γ-counting of excised electrophoretic bands. In those cases, for each sample a blind sample was prepared in the same manner but in the absence of suPAR material and electrophoresed on the same gel; parallel positions on the gel were subjected to γ-counting for blind subtraction. For zero length cross-linking, suPAR material or cell extracts were incubated with labeled ATF in the same manner. After transferring the samples to room temperature, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC, Pierce) and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (Pierce) were added from freshly prepared stock solutions to yield final concentrations of 10 mM of each reagent. The samples were incubated for 30 min, after which the reaction was stopped by addition of ammonium acetate (a 1 M stock solution, titrated to pH 7.4) to a final concentration of 500 mM. All analyses by SDS-PAGE were performed according to Laemmli (18Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) on 6-16% gradient slab gels. For reducing sample treatment, 20 mM dithiothreitol was included in the sample buffer. Reduced samples were alkylated with 50 mM (final concentration) of iodoacetamide after boiling. Cross-linked samples were diluted in 0.1 M Tris/HCl, pH 8.1, with 0.1% Tween 80 and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Monoclonal antibodies directed against specified parts of the uPAR molecule were added to final concentrations of 10 µg/ml. Subsequently, immunoprecipitation was performed as described (17Behrendt N. Ploug M. Rønne E. Høyer-Hansen G. Danø K. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 223: 207-222Google Scholar), except that the incubation periods for the antigen-antibody reaction and for the protein A-Sepharose adsorption step, respectively, were reduced to 1 h in each case. Kinetic studies of ligand binding were performed by real-time interaction analysis (19Karlsson R. Michaelsson A. Mattsson L. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 145: 229-240Google Scholar) using a BIAcore 2000™ apparatus (Pharmacia Biosensor, Uppsala, Sweden). uPA (20 µg/ml in 10 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0) was immobilized on a CM5-type sensor chip using the reagents and procedures supplied with the Amine Coupling Kit (Pharmacia Biosensor). Samples of suPAR or D(1 + 2) were diluted in PBS with 0.05% surfactant P20 (Pharmacia Biosensor) (running buffer) before injection. The kinetics of binding were recorded at a buffer flow of 5 µl/min, including an injection phase of 5 min followed by dissociation for 7.5 min. At the end of each run, the remaining bound material was eluted by injection of 0.1 M acetic acid, 0.5 M NaCl, to restore complete binding capacity in the next cycle. Analysis of binding data relative to kinetic models, using nonlinear curve fitting, was performed using the BIAevaluation™ software, version 2.1. The data were evaluated relative to a bimolecular association reaction model (association model a of the software) and a first-order dissociation reaction (dissociation model a). Optimal sections of each curve were selected, using derived, logarithmic plots as recommended (43BIAevaluation 2.1 Software Handbook (1995) Pharmacia Biosensor, Uppsala, Sweden.Google Scholar). The applicability of the chosen model was ascertained by evaluating the resulting fitted curves, using the residual plot function of the software (requiring a random point scattering for the fit to be accepted) as well as calculation of χ2 (requiring a χ2 value below 0.2 in both the association and dissociation phase for acceptance). Calculated values for the association rate constant (ka) and the dissociation rate constant (kd) were used for deriving the apparent dissociation constant (KD app = kd/ka). Automatic NH2-terminal sequencing was done using an Applied Biosystems protein sequencer, model 477A. Acid hydrolysis of protein fragments and amino acid composition analysis were performed as described (7Ploug M. Kjalke M. Rønne E. Weidle U. Høyer-Hansen G. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17539-17546Google Scholar). The finding that the isolated, ligand-binding D1 (6Behrendt N. Ploug M. Patthy L. Houen G. Blasi F. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7842-7847Google Scholar) has a much lower ligand affinity than the intact uPAR (12Ploug M. Ellis V. Danø K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8991-8997Google Scholar) has stressed the importance of functional studies on all of the domains of this receptor. Such studies, however, have been hampered by the lack of proteolytic cleavage methods other than those leading to the liberation of D1. In order to solve this problem, we surveyed a number of cleavage conditions, using purified recombinant, soluble uPAR (suPAR (20Rønne E. Behrendt N. Ploug M. Nielsen H.J. Wüllisch E. Weidle U. Danø K. Høyer-Hansen G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 167: 91-101Google Scholar)) as the substrate. It turned out that treatment of suPAR with pepsin at pH 3.9 led to a simple fragment pattern that included two cleavage products not observed previously. In SDS-PAGE these fragments migrated with apparent Mr 33,000 and 19,000, respectively (Fig. 1A, lane 3). The two fragments were purified by gel filtration (Fig. 1B) followed by reversed-phase HPLC (Fig. 1C). The fractions a1 and b1 (Fig. 1C) each contained a single fragment (Fig. 1A, lanes 1 and 2). These products were subjected to NH2-terminal sequencing to yield the results shown in Table I. It was clear that the larger fragment (fraction a1) had the same NH2 terminus as the intact suPAR, whereas the sequence of the smaller fragment (fraction b1) showed that the major cleavage position was the Glu183-Leu184 bond. In addition, a minor sequence could be followed in fraction b1, representing cleavage at the Leu184-Glu185 bond. For both fragments, amino acid composition data (Table II) were in complete accordance with cleavage at positions 183 and 184.TABLE I.NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of purified fragments and partial sequences of intact suPARFraction a1aThe material contained 60 pmol of D(1 + 2) and gave an initial yield of 43 pmol of phenylthiohydantoin-Leu in cycle 1.

Chem. 1991; 266: 7842-7847Google Scholar). Fraction b1 thus contained the isolated domain 3 (D3), whereas fraction a1 contained a large, uncleaved fragment comprised of the intact domains 1 and 2 (D(1 + 2)). The ligand-binding properties of the purified fragments were initially studied in a qualitative manner, using chemical cross-linking to 125I-labeled ATF (6Behrendt N. Ploug M. Patthy L. Houen G. Blasi F. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7842-7847Google Scholar, 16Nielsen L.S. Kellerman G.M. Behrendt N. Picone R. Danø K. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2358-2363Google Scholar). The cross-linking capability of these fragments was thus compared with that of suPAR fragments studied previously (Fig. 2). This experiment showed that D(1 + 2) was capable of cross-linking to ATF (lane 3), whereas no cross-linked product was formed by ATF and D3 (lane 4). This result was expected since a determinant, reactive with ATF in cross-linking, is present in D1 (6Behrendt N. Ploug M. Patthy L. Houen G. Blasi F. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7842-7847Google Scholar). However, the amount of D(1 + 2) required in order to obtain a clear signal was much higher than the amount of intact suPAR needed (lane 2, see the legend to Fig. 2). Rather, the ligand cross-linking efficiency of D(1 + 2) appeared comparable with that of D1, purified from a chymotryptic digest as described previously (12Ploug M. Ellis V. Danø K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8991-8997Google Scholar) (lane 5). In order to study this difference further, we modified the cross-linking assay to allow quantitative analyses of ligand binding. In a simple system with suPAR and labeled ATF, the amount of cross-linked complex does not reflect the equilibrium binding situation. First, the efficiency of the cross-linking reaction is unknown, and second, the covalent reaction disturbs the equilibrium by fixing the noncovalent complex. However, we could indeed find conditions where the fraction of labeled ligand molecules that became cross-linked was a linear function of the amount of suPAR present. This was shown by excision and γ-counting of labeled protein bands after SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A). Under these conditions, linearity was obtained in the interval from 0 to 100 pM of suPAR. By choosing a constant concentration of suPAR within the dynamic range, this allowed us to use cross-linking as a reporter system to follow the blocking of suPAR by a competing, nonlabeled ligand. As long as the labeled and the nonlabeled ligand would react identically with suPAR (i.e. competing for the same site and cross-linking with the same efficiency), the presence of the competitor would lead to a decrease in the amount of cross-linked, labeled ATF, which would reflect the fraction of suPAR bound by the competitor. As shown in Fig. 3B (triangles), competition with nonlabeled ATF thus revealed an IC50 between 0.1 and 1 nM, in accordance with the KD of suPAR binding found by other methods (12Ploug M. Ellis V. Danø K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8991-8997Google Scholar, 21Stoppelli M.P. Corti A. Soffientini A. Cassani G. Blasi F. Assoian R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These conditions did indeed represent equilibrium binding since no change occurred when incubation of suPAR and 125I-ATF was prolonged beyond 1 h. Due to the limited supplies of ATF, we were unable to use this reagent as a competitor in high concentrations in our routine work. However, it was found that competition with intact uPA led to a saturation curve closely similar to that found with ATF (Fig. 3B (circles)), in accordance with the fact that all of the binding determinants of uPA reside inside the ATF part of the molecule (21Stoppelli M.P. Corti A. Soffientini A. Cassani G. Blasi F. Assoian R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4939-4943Google Scholar, 23Appella E. Robinson E.A. Ullrich S.J. Stoppelli M.P. Corti A. Cassani G. Blasi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 4437-4440Google Scholar). This assay was used for comparison of the binding properties of intact suPAR and D(1 + 2) (Fig. 4). As already noted in the qualitative analyses above, a strong cross-linking signal with D(1 + 2) could only be obtained with elevated concentrations of this fragment (see the legend to Fig. 4). However, in agreement with the assumption that this phenomenon was caused by a lowered affinity, competition for binding was found to require much higher concentrations of uPA than those needed in the case of intact suPAR (Fig. 4A). It should be noted that the electrophoretic separation step of this method allowed the direct identification of the protein that was competed for by the ligands. This excluded interference from trace contents of other fragments or residual, intact suPAR and furthermore allowed control experiments with partially purified fractions; see below. Quantification of the results by γ-counting showed that ATF binding to D(1 + 2) was competed with an IC50 between 100 and 1000 nM of uPA (Fig. 4B, squares), i.e. a value 100-1000-fold higher than that found with intact suPAR (circles). Even though the concentration of D(1 + 2) used here had to be higher than that of intact suPAR in order to obtai"

Only NOS2 (the inducible isoform, iNOS) does so at the low levels of free Ca2+ in resting cells and when almost all Ca2+ is chelated in cell-free preparations. To test directly whether the predicted CaM-binding region of mouse NOS2 accounts for its Ca2+ independence, we prepared chimeric NOS's in which mouse NOS2 residues 503-532 were reciprocally exchanged with the corresponding residues 725-754 of rat NOS1 (neuronal NOS). Unlike either parent, both chimeras required an intermediate level of free Ca2+ to bind CaM and generate NO. In cell lysates, the concentration of Ca2+ necessary for half-maximal activity (EC50) was ~0 for NOS2, 200-300 nM for NOS1, and 7-10 nM for the chimeras. Results were similar when the region exchanged was enlarged by 7-8 residues toward the amino terminus. In contrast, when the carboxyl-terminal half of NOS2 (residues 454-1144) was replaced with that of NOS1 (residues 675-1429), the resulting chimera resembled NOS1 (EC50, 200-300 nM free Ca2+). Truncation analysis suggested that NOS2 residues within the sequence 484-726 were required for Ca2+-independent CaM-binding.

When myoblasts differentiate to myotubes, α7 mRNA and protein expression is up-regulated. To explore the mechanisms involved in the tissue-specific and developmentally regulated expression of α7, we isolated and characterized a genomic clone containing ~2.8 kilobase pairs (kb) of the 5′-flanking region of the murine α7 gene. The 5′-flanking region lacks both TATA and CCAAT boxes but contains five putative Sp1 binding sites located in a CpG island. Two transcription start sites, located near an initiator-like sequence, are 176 and 170 base pairs upstream of the translation start site. There are numerous binding sites for developmental and cell type-specific transcription factors, including AP-1, AP-2, GATA, and several AT-rich sites. There are also eight consensus E-boxes that bind the basic helix-loop-helix family of muscle-specific transcription factors. The ~2.8-kb 5′-flanking region was an active promoter in C2C12 skeletal myoblasts and exhibited increased expression upon conversion to myotubes but was inactive in HtLM2 cells, a mouse breast carcinoma epithelial cell line that does not express α7. Deletion analysis identified both positive and negative regulatory elements within the ~2.8-kb fragment. In 10T1/2 fibroblasts the ~2.8-kb α7 promoter was trans-activated by the myogenic basic helix-loop-helix proteins myogenin and MyoD but not by MRF4 and myf5.

Recently, the cDNAs for rat and mouse α7 have been isolated and shown to be alternatively spliced in both the extracellular (giving rise to two isoforms, X1 and X2) and cytoplasmic (producing three isoforms, A, B, and C) domains. Subsequent work has shown that these alternatively spliced forms are also developmentally regulated in muscle (7Collo G. Starr L. Quaranta V. J. Biol.

Resistance of Factor VaLeiden to inactivation by activated protein C (APC) contributes to thrombotic tendencies in subjects with the variant due, in part, to the inability to terminate thrombin production which increases both fibrin accretion and the frequency of thrombus formation. A reduced ability to inhibit thrombin generation, however, may lead to the stabilization of a clot through the activation of thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI). This hypothesis was tested by determining the profibrinolytic effect of APC on lysis time using clots formed with plasma from either homozygous normal (n = 4) or homozygous factor VLeiden (n = 4) subjects. Clots were formed in the presence of tissue-type plasminogen activator, thrombin, phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine vesicles, Ca2+, and various concentrations of APC. Approximately 10-fold more APC was required to reduce lysis time from 140 to 50 min in clots containing factor VLeiden compared to normal factor V. This effect was specific to the form of factor V present in plasma since identical results were obtained in an appropriately reconstituted purified system, which included both TAFI and either form of factor V purified from pooled plasma. In the absence of TAFI, APC did not affect clot lysis in experiments with either normal factor V or factor VLeiden. During the various lysis assays performed with purified components, clots were solubilized and the proteolytic alterations in factor V/Va were assessed by Western blotting using a specific factor Va heavy chain monoclonal antibody. The heavy chain of factor VaLeiden persisted for as long as 60 min, in the presence of 6.3 n APC indicating sustained activity of factor VaLeiden during the lysis assay. In contrast, no factor Va heavy chain was present after the first 5.0 min in clots formed in the presence of normal factor V and 6.3 n APC. These combined data indicate that factor VaLeiden specifically attenuates the profibrinolytic effect of APC. Thus, an impaired TAFI-dependent profibrinolytic response to APC in APC-resistant individuals appears to be an additional factor contributing to the prothrombotic tendencies in subjects with factor VLeiden.

Thus, an impaired TAFI-dependent profibrinolytic response to APC in APC-resistant individuals appears to be an additional factor contributing to the prothrombotic tendencies in subjects with factor VLeiden. Prothrombinase is the enzymatic complex responsible for prothrombin activation and is composed of the cofactor, factor Va, and the protease, factor Xa, associated on a membrane surface in the presence of Ca2+ (1Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Hibbard L.S. Tracy P.B. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1981; 370: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Single-chain plasma factor V is activated by thrombin to produce factor Va. The presence of factor Va in the prothrombinase complex increases the catalytic efficiency of prothrombin activation by 5 orders of magnitude as compared with that of factor Xa alone. Activation and inactivation of factor Va, therefore, constitute key regulatory events in the generation of thrombin (2Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prothrombinase is regulated, in part, by activated protein C (APC) 1The abbreviations used are: APCactivated protein CTAFIthrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitortPAtissue plasminogen activatorPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPCPSphosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylserine. which is formed by limited proteolysis of protein C by thrombin in complex with the cofactor thrombomodulin (3Esmon C.T. Owen W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2249-2252Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). APC inhibits prothrombinase through proteolytic inactivation of the cofactor, factor Va. Proteolytic inactivation of factor Va by APC occurs through three sequential cleavages of the heavy chain at residues Arg506, Arg306, and Arg679 (4Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage at Arg506 is necessary for efficient exposure of the inactivating cleavage sites at Arg306 and Arg679. Cleavage at Arg306 only occurs efficiently when the cofactor is membrane-bound and reduces factor Va cofactor activity by 80%. Remaining cofactor activity is lost following a membrane-independent cleavage at Arg679 (4Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). APC can also prevent activation of the procofactor through proteolysis at 4 sites: Arg306, Arg506, Arg679, and Lys994. Cleavage at Arg306 occurs first and appears to preclude activation of factor V (4Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol.

A G → A substitution at nucleotide 1691 in the factor V gene results in an Arg506→ Gln mutation in the factor V molecule (factor VLeiden, factor VR506Q) that, upon activation, is resistant to inactivation by APC (5Bertina R.M. Koeleman B.P.C. Koster T. Rosendaal F.R. Dirven R.J. De Ronde H. van der Velden P.A. Reitsma P.H. Nature. 1994; 369: 64-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (3834) Google Scholar). Although factor VLeiden is inactivated by APC in the presence of a membrane surface with a rate similar to that observed for normal factor V, factor VaLeiden is inactivated by APC with a rate 5-10 times slower than similarly derived normal factor Va (6Kalafatis M.

Blood. 1995; 85: 3405-3411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cleavage of both factor VLeiden and factor VaLeiden by APC correlates primarily with cleavage at both Arg306 and Arg679 producing a Mr = 54,000 fragment (6Kalafatis M. Bertina R.M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4053-4057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar), whereas, cleavage of both normal factor V and factor Va correlates with cleavage at both Arg306 and Arg506 resulting in the appearance of Mr = 30,000 fragment. Recent data have demonstrated that APC is also profibrinolytic. The profibrinolytic mechanism of APC in clots formed from plasma is attributed to its ability to attenuate thrombin generation since high concentrations of thrombin are required to activate thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI, which is also known as plasma procarboxypeptidase B) (8Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 9Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Resistance of factor VaLeiden to inactivation by APC may result in more frequent formation of thrombi resulting from inadequate regulation of thrombin production. A previously unappreciated mechanism by which resistance of factor Va to inactivation by APC could potentiate thrombosis is through the sustained activation of TAFI, thereby increasing the resistance of a thrombus to tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)-induced lysis. This hypothesis was tested by comparing the profibrinolytic potential of APC in clots produced from plasma or purified components containing either factor V or factor VLeiden. Recombinant tPA (activase) was provided by Dr. G. Vehar of Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). The lyophilized powder was dissolved in water to give a final concentration of 1.0 mg/ml, from which working stock solutions were prepared as described previously (11Bajzar L. Fredenburgh J.C. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16948-16954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fibrinogen, plasminogen, recombinant α2-antiplasmin, prothrombin, thrombin, PCPS vesicles, antithrombin III, and factor Xa were isolated, prepared, and concentrations were determined as described previously (8Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). Purified human APC was provided by Dr. Paul Haley (Haematologic Technologies Inc., Essex Junction, VT). Factor V was isolated from pooled normal plasma and from pooled plasma of 4 patients genotyped and determined to be homozygous for factor VLeiden, as described previously (6Kalafatis M. Bertina R.M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4053-4057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). For experiments using whole plasma, citrated fresh frozen plasma, containing either normal factor V or factor VLeiden, was thawed at 37°C and dialyzed extensively against 20 m HEPES, 150 m NaCl, pH 7.4 (HBS). Plasma was initially diluted with HBS such that the A280 was 16 (typically a 1/3 dilution) and reconstituted with 10 μ PCPS vesicles. Clots (100 μl) were formed from the plasma by the addition of plasma to the wells of a microtiter plate containing 2 μl of separated aliquots of thrombin/Ca2+ (final concentrations of 6.0 n and 5.0 m, respectively) and tPA (final concentration of 294 p) and APC (final concentration 0-50 n). The plate was transferred to a Thermomax microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) that was maintained at 37°C, and the turbidity at λ = 405 nm was monitored at 2.5-min intervals over the duration of the experiment. Lysis profiles, generated by plotting relative absorbance (A405/max A405) as a function of time, were used to determine lysis times. Lysis time is operationally defined as the time required to attain the transition midpoint in the reduction from the maximum turbidity to baseline values. Relative lysis time is calculated by dividing the lysis time determined at a given concentration of APC by the lysis time determined in the absence of APC. In experiments using purified components, plasma was replaced with a solution comprising fibrinogen (3.0 μ), plasminogen (0.9 μ), recombinant α2-antiplasmin (0.5 μ), prothrombin (0.7 μ), antithrombin III (0.3 μ), TAFI (50 n), and factor V (6.7 n) reconstituted in HBS and supplemented with PCPS vesicles (10.0 μ). The lysis assay was carried out as previously indicated except a 2-μl aliquot of factor Xa (final concentration of 100 p) was also included in the well of the microtiter plate. A series of identical clots were produced from plasma containing either factor V or factor VLeiden in the presence of various concentrations of APC. At various times (0, 5, 10, and 60 min), the clots were solubilized and the reactions were quenched by the addition of 100 μl of 0.2 sodium acetate, pH 4.5. The samples were then diluted in sample preparation buffer (1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10% glycerol with bromphenol blue in 0.2 Tris, pH 8.0) and subjected to SDS-PAGE using a 5-15% gradient gel (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Following transfer to nitrocellulose (13Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar), cleavage products of factor V were detected with MoAb FVaHC#6 (6Kalafatis M. Bertina R.M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4053-4057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 14Kalafatis M. Haley P.E. Lu D. Bertina R.M. Long G.L. Mann K.G. Blood. 1996; 87: 4695-4707Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which recognizes an epitope on factor V between amino acid residues 307 and 506, and visualized using chemiluminescence (Chemiluminescence Detection Kit; DuPont NEN). The profibrinolytic effect of APC was determined for clots produced from dialyzed and diluted plasma samples obtained from 4 normal subjects and 4 individuals homozygous for factor VLeiden. Fig. 1, a and b, represents the lysis profiles of clots formed from a representative plasma sample containing normal factor V and factor VLeiden, respectively, in the presence of various concentrations of APC (0-50 n). Substantially more APC was required to achieve a similar reduction in clot lysis when plasma containing factor VLeiden was used in the assay (compare Fig. 1a (⋄) and Fig. 1b (•)). The magnitude of the difference is better represented in Fig. 1c which is a plot of the average lysis times of the samples as a function of the APC concentration. The EC50 for APC in clots formed from plasma containing normal factor V was approximately 3 n, whereas, for plasma containing factor VLeiden, it was 27 n. Similarly, the effect of APC on the reduction of lysis time was maximum at 5 n in clots formed from normal plasma, whereas concentrations of APC ≥ 50 n were necessary to achieve the same lysis time in clots formed using plasma containing factor VLeiden. The near identity of the maximum absorbance due to clot formation in all cases indicates that the amount of fibrin formed was similar. Further, since APC, at concentrations as high as 50 n, did not alter the maximum absorbance change, it is concluded that APC did not appreciably affect clot structure either directly or indirectly by inhibiting the activation of prothrombin in situ. Clots formed from plasma containing normal factor V respond to lower concentrations of APC when compared to clots formed from plasma containing factor VLeiden. These data indicate that the profibrinolytic effect of APC is attenuated in clots formed from plasma containing the APC-resistant factor VLeiden molecule. Lysis times were enhanced by APC when clots were formed in the presence of TAFI and either form of factor V. As was observed in the plasma-based system, APC was less effective in enhancing lysis of clots formed in the presence of factor VLeiden. The plot of lysis time as a function of APC concentration, shown in Fig. 2c, quantitatively demonstrates the relative profibrinolytic potential of APC in clots formed from either normal factor V or factor VLeiden. Under these conditions, the EC50 values for normal factor V and factor VLeiden were 3 and 22 n, respectively. Lysis times of clots produced in the absence of TAFI were invariant at 75 min regardless of either the concentration of APC or form of factor V present. These data are in excellent agreement with those determined using the plasma-based system and demonstrate that the difference in the profibrinolytic effect of APC is exclusively dependent upon both the factor V species present in the assay as well as the presence of TAFI. Previous experiments have demonstrated that near-quantitative conversion of prothrombin to thrombin during the fibrinolytic assay is necessary to activate TAFI (8Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 11Bajzar L. Fredenburgh J.C. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16948-16954Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Functional factor Va, therefore, is required during the assay to form the prothrombinase complex and ensure adequate prothrombin activation. Five identical lysis reactions were initiated for each assay condition and at times 0, 5, 10, and 60 min a fibrin clot, representing each condition, was solubilized and the reactions were concomitantly quenched. The fifth reaction was allowed to proceed until completion and was used to determine lysis time. Fig. 3, upper panel, shows the lysis profiles of clots formed from purified components with normal factor V or factor VLeiden in the absence and presence of APC. The lysis times were essentially identical for clots formed with either form of factor V (150 min) in the absence of APC; however, 6.3 n APC significantly shortened lysis time only in clots formed in the presence of normal factor V (75 min) but not in the presence of factor VLeiden (135 min). In this particular assay, 50 n APC was only marginally able to shorten the lysis time of clots formed in the presence of factor VLeiden (118 min). The Western blot (Fig. 3, lower panel), shows the fragments produced by activation/inactivation of both factor V species during the lysis assays. In the absence of APC, the heavy chain of normal factor Va was evident at the initial time point but was consumed by 60 min during the lysis assay. This is most likely due to the action of plasmin which is formed during the late stages of the assay (15Lee C.D. Mann K.G. Blood. 1989; 73: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For this reason, comparison of the presence of active forms of factor Va was limited to the initial (<10 min) time points of the lysis assay. In the presence of 6.3 n APC, the heavy chain of normal factor Va has been completely degraded within the first 5 min giving rise to a fragment of Mr = 30,000 indicating complete inactivation of either factor V and factor Va by APC (Fig. 3, lower panel, lane 6A). In contrast, even in the presence of 50 n APC, some heavy chain of VaLeiden persisted after 5 min (Fig. 3, lower panel, lane 8B). A fragment of factor VaLeiden (Mr = 60,000) was also apparent and represents a portion of the heavy chain comprising amino acid residues 307-709. Based on the presence of this fragment and its relative cofactor activity, in addition to the presence of the factor Va heavy chain, it was estimated that as much as 25% of the initial activity of VaLeiden remains at 5 min (6Kalafatis M. Bertina R.M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4053-4057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Similar analyses indicated that in the presence of 6.3 n APC ≥ 50% of the initial activity remained after 5 min (Fig. 3, lower panel, lane 5B). These data indicate persistence of cofactor activity in the presence of high concentrations of APC and factor VaLeiden, which in turn is responsible for thrombin generation and subsequent TAFI activation. Although interpretation of the data shown in Fig. 3 (lower panel) demonstrates the presence of functional factor Va during the lysis experiments it is not possible, with these data alone, to reject the possibility that factor V and not factor Va is the substrate for APC, since cleavage of either substrate would prevent thrombin generation and subsequent TAFI activation. The rate of inactivation of both normal factor V and factor VLeiden is similar. However, a difference in the profibrinolytic effect of APC was observed in these studies. We must conclude, therefore, that activation of factor V must have occurred prior to inactivation by APC since only the rate of inactivation of the two cofactors is significantly different (6Kalafatis M. Bertina R.M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4053-4057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Since APC is present at time zero, there is the potential to preclude activation of the pro-cofactor in which case the magnitude of the difference between the EC50 values reported is underestimated. However, the 7-10-fold difference in the EC50 for the profibrinolytic effect of APC is in accordance with the reported difference in the rate of inactivation of the two cofactors as assessed using a prothrombinase activity assay (6Kalafatis M. Bertina R.M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4053-4057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 7Heeb M.J. Kojima Y. Greengard J.S. Griffin J.H. Blood. 1995; 85: 3405-3411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The balance between coagulation and anticoagulation can affect the resistance of a clot to fibrinolysis at a given concentration of tPA. In this report, we demonstrate that resistance of factor VaLeiden to inactivation by APC produces a clot that is also resistant to the profibrinolytic effect of APC. Therefore, regulation of the prothrombinase complex, specifically through modulation of factor Va cofactor activity, plays a pivotal role in determining the relative stability of a clot to fibrinolysis. Since this effect is not observed in the absence of TAFI, these results highlight a potential physiological role for TAFI in disease states involving deregulation of coagulation. Further, we propose that the thrombotic tendencies in subjects with factor VLeiden is likely due to the inability of APC to effectively inactivate factor VaLeiden which would contribute to thrombosis through the production of thrombi more resistant to fibrinolysis due to sustained activation of TAFI and subsequent inhibition of fibrinolysis in addition to other effects caused by impaired regulation of thrombin generation."

In the present study, DNase I footprinting, antibody/electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), site-directed mutagenesis, and transient cotransfection experiments provide evidence that Pax-6 interacts at LSR1 and LSR2 to activate the αB-crystallin promoter in the lens. paired-domain chloramphenicol acetyltransferase electrophoretic mobility shift assay kilobase pair(s) base pair(s). Approximately 2.7 kbp NdeI-PstI DNA fragments containing the mouse αB-cat fusion genes were isolated from plasmids p11-3, p61-7 (5Dubin R.A. Gopal-Srivastava R. Wawrousek E.F. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4340-4349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and p9760 (6Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by electroelution, phenol-chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation. Each fragment contained 60 bp of pBR322 sequence at its 5′ end, murine αB-crystallin promoter sequences, the bacterial cat gene, and SV40-derived sequences, including the small t antigen splice sites and polyadenylation signal. The αB115-cat fusion gene isolated from p11-3 contained the −115/+44 sequence of the αB-crystallin gene, the αB68-cat fusion gene isolated from p61-7 contained the −68/+44 sequence of the αB-crystallin gene, and the αBLSR1(Mu-9760)-cat fusion gene isolated from p9760 (−164/+44) contained mutated LSR1 sequence (143- to −129) (6Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) of the αB-crystallin promoter (Fig. 1). Linear DNA fragments were injected into one pronucleus of a single celled mouse embryo (FVB/N strain) (24Gordon J.W. Scangos G.A. Plotkin D.L. Barbosa J.A. Ruddle F.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7380-7384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). The embryos were obtained from superovulated FVB/N females. Injected embryos were transferred into FVB/N females made pseudopregnant by mating to vasectomized FVB/N males. Transgenic mice were created by the National Eye Institute Centralized Transgenic Facility. DNA was isolated (25Hogan B. Costantini F. Lacey E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986: 174Google Scholar) from tails of founder Fo mice and analyzed by Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction analyses for the presence of the transgene. We used 5′ oligodeoxynucleotide primers (oligodeoxynucleotide 10660, 5′-CCCTGATCACAAGTCTCCATGAACT-3′, for αB115-cat and oligodeoxynucleotide 10661, 5′-ACCCCTGACCTCACCATTCCAGAAG-3′, for αB68-cat, and oligodeoxynucleotide 10662, 5′-TCTCTTTTCTTAGCTCAGTGTCTAG-3′, for αBLSR1(Mu-9760)-cat, which were specific for the murine αB-crystallin promoter, and a 3′ oligodeoxynucleotide primer (oligodeoxynucleotide 7576, 5′-CGGTCTGGTTATAGGTACATTGAGC-3′) which was specific for the cat gene. Fo mice containing the transgene were mated to nontransgenic FVB/N mice to obtain F1 offspring, and sibling matings were used to establish homozygous mouse lines. The transgene copy number for each mouse was estimated by hybridization intensity in a slot blot analysis of the genomic DNA relative to the standard samples representing 0-50 copies of the transgene, using the ECL 3′-Oligo Labeling Detection System (RPN 2130/2131, Amersham) and the 1.6-kbp NdeI/BamHI fragment from pSVO-CAT as the labeled probe. Blots were exposed at room temperature for 1 min. Hemizygous mice between 1 and 3 months of age were sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation and the lenses, lung, heart, liver, kidney, spleen, brain (cerebrum), and skeletal muscle (from thigh) were homogenized with 0.25 Tris-HCl (pH 7.8) in Duall glass homogenizers (Knotes, 0020). The lenses were homogenized in polypropylene Eppendorf microcentrifuge tubes, centrifuged for 10 min at 4°C, and the supernatant fraction heated at 65°C for 15 min followed by centrifugation for 10 min at 4°C. Protein concentrations were determined in the final supernatant fraction with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions using bovine serum albumin for the standards. Tissue extracts containing 0.5-20 μg of total protein were analyzed for CAT activity by the biphasic assay (26Neumann J.R. Morency C.A. Russian K.O. Bio/Technology. 1987; 5: 444-447Google Scholar). The level of CAT activity was taken as an indirect measure of promoter strength. Plasmid DNA was prepared by the alkaline lysis method (27Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 1.34Google Scholar) followed by ultracentrifugation banding in CsCl-ethidium bromide. For transfection experiments plasmid DNA was isolated and purified using the QIAGEN plasmid kit (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA). Mouse tail DNA was isolated by modification of the procedure of Hogan et al. (25Hogan B. Costantini F. Lacey E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986: 174Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from αTN4-1 mouse lens cells (28Yamada T. Nakamura T. Westphal H. Russell P. Curr. Eye Res. 1989; 9: 31-37Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar), L929 fibroblasts (29Earle W.R. Schilling E.L. Stark T.H. Straus N.P. Brown M.F. Shelton E. J. Natl.

Y.). 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Complementary oligodeoxynucleotides were synthesized (model 380A synthesizer; Applied Biosystems) and annealed at 1:1 molar ratio as described previously (32Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7144-7152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides were labeled on one strand, and EMSAs were performed as described previously (32Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7144-7152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Wild type and mutated versions of an oligodeoxynucleotide containing the sequence −152/−121 (LSR1) or the wild type oligodeoxynucleotide containing the sequence −78/−28 (LSR2) of the αB-crystallin promoter were used for EMSA. For footprinting lens extract was partially purified on a heparin ultrogel A4R column and eluted with 400 m KCl as described previously (33Cvekl A. Horska K. Vlcek C. Paces V. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 103: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Anti-quail-Pax-6 antibody was a gift from Dr. Simon Saule (34Carriere C. Plaza S. Martin P. Quatannens B. Bailly M. Stehelin D. Saule S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7257-7266Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). DNase I footprinting was performed by using the EcoRI-BamHI restriction fragment of pD96 (5Dubin R.A. Gopal-Srivastava R. Wawrousek E.F. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4340-4349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) spanning positions −666 to +76 of the αB-crystallin promoter. A polymerase chain reaction-generated fragment corresponding to the −190 to +40 sequence of the αB-crystallin promoter was used for footprinting experiments with the paired domain of purified mouse Pax-6 (PD5 and its alternatively spliced form, PD5a) (12Epstein A.J. Glaser T. Cai J. Jepeal A. Walton D.S. Maas R.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2022-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). The Pax-6 GST expression vectors were gifts of Dr. Richard Maas (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). End labeling, EMSA, and DNase I footprinting were performed as described previously (32Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7144-7152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations that were generated previously (6Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) within the −164/+44 EcoRI/PstI fragment of the mouse αB-crystallin gene obtained from pRD30A (5Dubin R.A. Gopal-Srivastava R. Wawrousek E.F. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4340-4349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used for transfection experiments and EMSAs. In brief, site-specific mutations (Mu-9760 and Mu-9761) (6Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) were introduced by using a oligodeoxynucleotide-directed mutagenesis kit (Sculptor in vitro mutagenesis kit, Amersham). Mutagenic oligodeoxynucleotides contained the substitution sequence TCTAGA (XbaI site) and 20 bases on each side complementary to the αB-crystallin promoter sequence. The resulting mutated restriction fragments were subcloned into pRD30A at the unique BamHI site (5Dubin R.A. Gopal-Srivastava R. Wawrousek E.F. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4340-4349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing the ligation junctions and mutated regions. Mouse COP-8 fibroblasts (35Tyndall C. La Mantia G. Thacker C.M. Favaloro J. Kamen R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 6231-6250Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml of gentamicin in 10% CO2. The cells were propagated on 60-mm diameter plastic dishes. Seven μg of wild type αB-promoter-cat plasmids (p65-7 and p11-3) (5Dubin R.A. Gopal-Srivastava R. Wawrousek E.F. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4340-4349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or mutated test plasmids (Mu-9760 and Mu-9761) (6Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), increasing amounts (0.1-3 μg) of pKW10-Pax6 (which expresses the wild type PD, homeodomain, and transactivation domain of mouse Pax-6), and 2 μg of internal control pCH110 which expresses β-galactosidase (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) were cotransfected for 6 h as calcium phosphate precipitates as described previously (32Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7144-7152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the cotransfection experiments using p11-3, three mutant forms of Pax-6 cDNA expression vectors were used (p309C expresses the PD (1-140 amino acids), p310A expresses the PD and the homeodomain (1-286 amino acids), and p312A expresses the PD, homeodomain, and a part of transactivation domain (1-388 amino acids) of Pax-6). Cells were harvested and extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection. CAT activities were determined by the biphasic (26Neumann J.R. Morency C.A. Russian K.O. Bio/Technology. 1987; 5: 444-447Google Scholar) assay, and β-galactosidase activities were determined as described previously (32Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7144-7152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The transfection data represent the means of three separate experiments, with each experiment being conducted with duplicate plates. Three constructs of αB-crystallin promoter-cat fusion genes (Fig. 1) were used as transgenes in transgenic mice. The αB115-CAT construct does not contain the αB-crystallin muscle-preferred enhancer (−426/−259) and LSR1 (−147/−118). The αB68-CAT construct contains a severely truncated αB-crystallin promoter (−68/+44) lacking any of the previously identified αB-crystallin cis-regulatory elements (32Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7144-7152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Gopal-Srivastava R. Haynes II, J.I. Piatigorsky J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 7081-7090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The αBLSR1(Mu-9760)-CAT construct contains 164 bp of 5′-flanking sequence and a mutated LSR1 sequence (6Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 7A). Polymerase chain reaction analyses of tail DNA were performed from the transgenic mice containing αB115-CAT, αB68-CAT, and αBLSR1(Mu-9760)-CAT constructs, to establish the presence of the transgene. Five of the 21 Fo mice carried the αB115-cat transgene in their genome, 3 out of 29 Fo mice contained the αB68-cat transgene, and 5 out of 37 Fo mice contained the αBLSR1(Mu-9760)-cat transgene. Three lines carrying one integration site (all had multiple copy numbers) of each construct were chosen for further analysis.

Open table in a new tab To investigate the possibility that there are sequences downstream of LSR1 (6Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) that can confer lens-specific αB-crystallin promoter activity, we analyzed the αB115-CAT and αB68-CAT transgenic mice generated above. The transgenic mice were sacrificed and numerous tissues (heart, lung, liver, spleen, kidney, skeletal muscle, brain, and lens) were assayed for CAT activity. The transgenic data are summarized in Table I. Average CAT activities for αB115-CAT, αB68-CAT, and αBLSR1(Mu-9760)-CAT in various tissues are shown in Fig. 2A. All the mice from multiple independent lines (different founders) containing the αB115-cat transgene expressed CAT activity exclusively in the lenses at significantly higher level than the background CAT activity observed in the lenses of nontransgenic mice (see Table I and Fig. 2A). In contrast to the results obtained with the αB115-cat transgene, the mice containing the αB68-cat transgene had no CAT activity in the lens or any other tissue examined (Table I and Fig. 2A) except for mouse #55 in which CAT activity in the lenses was above the background. The low lens activity of the αB68-cat transgene in mouse #55 may be due to its different integration site, which may have reconstructed an adequate binding site for a positive transcription factor. Unexpectedly, αBLSR1(Mu-9760)-cat transgene containing mice did not exhibit CAT activity in any of the tissues analyzed, including the lens (Table I and Fig. 2A). With LSR2 still intact in the αBLSR1(Mu-9760)-CAT construct, a low CAT activity was expected in the lenses of the transgenic mice. Several possibilities to explain this observation are discussed below. Fig. 2B depicts the average CAT activities in lenses of all the transgenic mice for the present and earlier experiments carrying the αB426-cat (6Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), αB164-cat (6Gopal-Srivastava R. Piatigorsky J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1281-1286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), αB115-cat, and αB68-cat transgenes. The transgenic mice containing the αB426-cat transgene (which includes the muscle-preferred enhancer) had an average of seven times more CAT activity in the lens than the transgenic mice containing the αB164-cat transgene (which lacks the enhancer). For the αB115-cat transgene (which lacks both enhancer and LSR1) there was an additional 30-fold decrease in average CAT activity in the lens. Finally there was no CAT activity in the lenses of the transgenic mice harboring the αB68-cat transgene. These data indicate that the sequences downstream of −115 contribute to the lens expression of the αB-crystallin gene. Sequences downstream of −115 contain a motif highly conserved in the human, mouse, and duck αB-crystallin promoter, previously called Block 2 (37Wistow G. Graham C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 105-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), which we rename here LSR2 for lens-specific region 2. Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that the minimum lens-specific promoter for the αB-crystallin gene is sequence −115 to +44 and that the −164/−115 sequence enhances activity of the αB promoter in a lens-specific fashion. We next performed DNase I footprinting experiments in order to localize lens nuclear protein binding sites in the αB-promoter. A DNase I footprint obtained with a partially purified nuclear extract from the αTN4-1 lens cells (28Yamada T. Nakamura T. Westphal H. Russell P. Curr. Eye Res. 1989; 9: 31-37Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar) or adult mouse lenses is shown in Fig. 3. The results showed that the sequences between positions −147 and −118 (LSR1), −72 and −51 (LSR2) and −30 and −7 of the αB-crystallin 5′-flanking region were protected from DNase I digestion (Fig. 3). Since we noted sequence similarities between the footprinted regions and binding sites for Pax-6 (23Cvekl A. Piatigorsky J. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 621-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), we examined the possibility that the paired domain of Pax-6 (PD5) can bind to the DNase I protected regions. A DNase I protection assay of the −190/+40 fragment revealed that the regions covering LSR1 (−160/−131), LSR2 (−97/−27), and a sequence in exon 1 (+2/+29) on the upper (sense) strand were footprinted by PD5 (Fig. 4). Positions −164 to −120 (LSR1), −72 to −28 (LSR2) and +2 to +27 (in exon 1) of the lower (antisense) strand were also protected from DNase I digestion by PD5. There were some differences in the footprinted regions obtained with PD5 and its alternatively spliced form, PD5a (PD of Pax-6 that contains 14 extra amino acids) (12Epstein A.J. Glaser T. Cai J. Jepeal A. Walton D.S. Maas R.L. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2022-2034Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). PD5a did not create a DNase I footprint on the upper (sense) strand of LSR2. On the lower (antisense) strand, a more extended footprint covering the sequence between −106 and −28 was obtained for PD5a, consistent with more than one binding site for this form of Pax-6. In a control test, GST-fused Prox-1 (recombinant protein) did not create a footprint in either the LSR1 or the LSR2 regions (data not shown). The Pax-6 footprinted sequences for upper and lower strands and the surrounding nucleotides are shown in Fig. 5A. Regions that resemble the consensus binding sequence for the paired-domain of Pax-6 (PD5) and PD5a are shown in Fig. 5B; the uppercase nucleotides conform with the Pax-6 consensus binding site and the lowercase nucleotides deviate from the consensus binding site.Fig. 4DNase I footprinting of the murine αB-crystallin promoter with purified paired domain of Pax-6 (PD5).

https://openalex.org/W2061735639,"We have here investigated the effect of the regulatory Tat protein of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) on the PI 3-kinase catalytic activity in PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells. After as early as 1 min from the beginning of the treatment with recombinant HIV-1 Tat protein, a significant increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase was noticed in 48 h serum-starved PC12 cells. Moreover, the addition of Tat to PC12 cells induced a great increase in PI 3-kinase immunoprecipitated with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody with a peak of activity (19-fold increase with respect to the basal levels) after a 15-min treatment. This increase in PI 3-kinase activity was significantly higher in PC12 cell cultures supplemented with Tat protein than in cultures stimulated by 100 ng/ml nerve growth factor (NGF; 8-fold increase with respect to the basal levels). Further experiments showed that Tat protein was able to specifically activate PI 3-kinase at picomolar concentrations. In fact: (i) maximal activation of PI 3-kinase was observed at concentrations as low as 1 ng/ml and was specifically blocked by anti-Tat neutralizing antibody; (ii) a Tat-dependent activation was also observed in experiments in which PI 3-kinase activity was evaluated in either anti-Tyr(P) or anti-p85 immunoprecipitates; (iii) 100 n wortmannin completely blocked the Tat-mediated increase in PI 3-kinase activity both in vitro and in vivo.

Tat protein is a small (86-104 amino acid) protein encoded by two exons. Tat can be divided in five distinct domains called N-terminal, cysteine-rich, core, basic, and C-terminal sequences. While the cysteine-rich region is responsible for the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds, the basic region contains nuclear localization signals and the binding site for the transactivation response element RNA, located at the 5′ end of all viral mRNAs (1Jones K.A.

The best characterized biological effect of Tat is the transactivation of HIV-1 genome, which takes place after specific interactions of Tat protein with the stem-loop transactivation response element sequence of the long terminal repeat viral RNA at the nuclear level. In addition to acting intracellularly, Tat protein shows the unique property, for a viral protein, to be actively released in culture by HIV-1-infected and tat-transfected cells (2Ensoli B. Barillari G. Zaki Salahuddin S. Gallo R.C. Wong-Staal F. Nature. 1990; 345: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar) and displays pleiotropic activities on the survival, growth, and function of various cell types by acting as a viral growth factor (2Ensoli B. Barillari G. Zaki Salahuddin S. Gallo R.C. Wong-Staal F. Nature. 1990; 345: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 3Milani D. Zauli G. Neri L.M. Marchisio M. Previati M. Capitani S. J.

Friedman D.J. Wang C. Metelev V. Pardee A.B. Science. 1995; 268: 229-2318Crossref Scopus (549) Google Scholar). In particular, we have previously demonstrated that picomolar concentrations of recombinant Tat (0.1-10 ng/ml) promote the survival of PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells under serum-free culture conditions (3Milani D. Zauli G. Neri L.M. Marchisio M. Previati M. Capitani S. J. Gen. Virol. 1993; 74: 2587-2594Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Additionally, PC12 cells stably transfected with tat cDNA show an increased resistance to apoptotic death (4Zauli G. Gibellini D. Milani D. Mazzoni M. Borgatti P. La Placa M. Capitani S. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4481-4485PubMed Google Scholar). However, the addition in culture of anti-Tat neutralizing antibodies to these tat-transfected cells completely blocked their increased resistance to apoptosis (7Zauli G. La Placa M. Vignoli M. Re M.C. Gibellini D. Furlini G. Milani D. Marchisio M. Mazzoni M. Capitani S. J. AIDS. 1995; 10: 306-316Google Scholar), indicating that Tat released extracellularly by tat-transfected cells is required to promote cell survival. Although experimental evidence for the existence of high affinity receptor for Tat is still lacking, our data suggested that recombinant Tat might act by inducing intracellular signal transduction. Since it has been recently shown that NGF protects PC12 cells from apoptosis by activating PI 3-kinase (8Yao R. Cooper M.G. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar), we here investigated whether extracellular Tat was also able to activate PI 3-kinase in PC12 cells. Full-length recombinant Tat and p24 proteins of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), produced in Escherichia coli (American Bio-Technologies, Inc., Cambridge, MA), were stored at −70°C with 0.1 m dithiothreitol to prevent oxidation and resuspended in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) before use. Murine NGF was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from DuPont NEN. Anti-Tyr(P) antibody, used in both Western blot and immunoprecipitation experiments, was a murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) generated using a phosphotyramine as an immunogen and was a generous gift from Dr. Thomas Roberts (Dana Faber Hospital, Boston, MA). Antibody to the 85-kDa subunit of PI 3-kinase (anti-p85) was raised in rabbits by Dr. Brian Schaffhausen (Tufts University, Boston, MA) and is commercially available from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Anti-Tat and anti-p24 neutralizing monoclonal antibodies were purchased from American Bio-Technologies, Inc. Wortmannin, purchased from Sigma, was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at 10 m, stored at −20°C in the dark, and diluted with distilled water immediately before use. Rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum (all from Seromed, Biochrom KG, Berlin, Germany). Before stimulation with Tat, p24, or NGF, the medium was replaced, and PC12 cells were cultured for 48 h with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium alone in the absence of serum. The cells were then stimulated by adding 100 ng/ml NGF or various concentrations of HIV-1 Tat or p24 proteins to the culture medium. PC12 cells were lysed in lysis buffer (137 m NaCl, 20 m Tris, pH 7.5, 1 m MgCl2, 1 m CaCl2, 10% glycerol (v/v), 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 m vanadate, and 1 m PMSF, and debris were removed by centrifugation. PI 3-kinase was immunoprecipitated with either 1 μl of anti-p85 or 3 μl of anti-Tyr(P) (3.5 mg/ml) for 3 h at 4°C. The immunoprecipitates were collected with protein A-Sepharose, washed three times in PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40; twice in 0.1 Tris, 0.5 LiCl; and twice in TNE (10 m Tris, 100 m NaCl, 1 m EDTA, pH 7.5). All wash solutions contained 100 μ vanadate. The samples were then boiled for 5 min and electrophoresed on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels, and proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After incubation with TBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin at 37°C for 1 h, the membranes were incubated with anti-Tyr(P) or anti-p85 for 2 h at 4°C. The filters were washed three times in TBS, 0.2% Tween 20 (TTBS) and proteins were visualized using a chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham, United Kingdom) with secondary antibodies from Sigma. To reprobe the filters, they were stripped of primary and secondary antibodies in 100 m 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, for 45 min at 70°C, washed three times in TBS, reblocked, and treated as described above. HIV-1 Tat or p24 proteins or NGF were added to intact cells for the indicated times at 37°C. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold buffer A (137 m NaCl, 20 m Tris, 1 m MgCl2, 1 m CaCl, 1 m vanadate, pH 7.5), and lysed in lysis buffer (buffer A plus 10% glycerol (v/v), 1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 m PMSF. The lysates were vortexed and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm. The cleared supernatant was transferred to a fresh microcentrifuge tube, and incubated with anti-Tyr(P) (3.5 mg/ml lysate) or anti-p85 (2 μl/ml lysate) antibody for 2 h at 4°C. Protein A-Sepharose (4 mg/ml lysate) was then added for 1 h at 4°C to the lysates. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times in PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40; twice in 0.1 Tris, 0.5 LiCl; and twice in TNE. All wash solutions contained 100 μ vanadate. The PI 3-kinase assay on the immunoprecipitate was performed by adding sonicated PI (in 10 m HEPES, 1 m EDTA, pH 7.5; 0.5 mg/ml final concentration) and [γ-32P]ATP (5-10 μCi/sample) to the immunoprecipitates for 10 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 80 μl of HCl (2) and 160 μl of methanol:chloroform (1:1 mixture). The lipid-containing organic phase was resolved on oxalate-coated thin-layer chromatography plates (Silica Gel 60, Merck) developed in chloroform:methanol:water:ammonium hydroxide (60:40:3:2). Radiolabeled spots, identified by autoradiography on Kodak X-Omat S films, were excised and quantified by scintillation counting. Separation of deacylated phosphoinositides was carried out on a Parthisphere SAX, 120 × 4.6-mm column, equipped with a Sax precolumn insert following a previously described procedure (9Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Soltoff S.P. Libby P. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 167-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). The chromatographic apparatus used was composed of a 9012 ternary gradient pump and a 2550 UV-visible detector, both from Varian (Palo Alto, CA). To verify that the 32P labeling was present on the 3-OH instead of the 4-OH, radiolabeled phosphoinositides were scraped off the TLC plate, the silica was incubated at 53°C for 90 min with 0.6 ml of 40% methylamine, cooled, transferred to a new tube, and dried by vacuum. The samples were transferred into 0.6 ml of water and washed twice with 1 ml of n-butanol/petroleum ether/ethyl formate (20:4:1 by volume), after which the aqueous layer was dried under vacuum and stored at −20°C. To achieve glycerophosphoinositol separation, the sample was reconstituted in water, filtered on a 0.2-μm filter, and injected into the HPLC apparatus previously equilibrated in water. After 1 min, a gradient between 0 and 15% of 1 (NH4)2HPO4 was developed over a time of 50 min. Since previous studies (10Soltoff S.P. Rabin S.L. Cantley L.C. Kaplan D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17472-17477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the exposure of PC12 cells to NGF induces an increase in anti-Tyr(P)-immunoprecipitable PI 3-kinase activity, we first compared the ability of Tat protein and NGF to stimulate PI 3-kinase activity in PC12 cells. Fig. 1A shows PI 3-kinase activity immunoprecipitated using anti-Tyr(P) antibody at different time points after addition of Tat or NGF. Both Tat protein (1 ng/ml) and NGF (100 ng/ml) potently stimulated PI 3-kinase activity. Both proteins showed significant stimulation within 1 min, but Tat gave rise to a more prolonged stimulation, peaking at 15 min. On the other hand, HIV-1 p24 protein at concentrations of 1-100 ng/ml was unable to stimulate PI 3-kinase activity over the base line (data not shown). Activation of PI 3-kinase was further investigated using an antibody against the 85-kDa subunit of the p85/p110 type PI 3-kinase. As shown in Fig. 1 (B and C), Tat (1 ng/ml) stimulated the anti-p85 precipitable PI 3-kinase activity, and maximal stimulation was observed at 15 min after addition of Tat. The product of the lipid kinase activity was analyzed by deacylation and HPLC separation and shown to be phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (data not shown). Since it has been observed that Tat displays different and sometimes opposite effects on cell survival depending on the concentrations used in various studies (2Ensoli B. Barillari G. Zaki Salahuddin S. Gallo R.C. Wong-Staal F. Nature. 1990; 345: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 4Zauli G. Gibellini D. Milani D. Mazzoni M. Borgatti P. La Placa M. Capitani S. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4481-4485PubMed Google Scholar, 5Viscidi R.P. Mayur K. Lederman H.M. Frankel A.D. Science. 1989; 246: 1606-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 6Li C.J. Friedman D.J. Wang C. Metelev V. Pardee A.B. Science. 1995; 268: 229-2318Crossref Scopus (549) Google Scholar), in the next group of experiments various concentrations of Tat protein in the range 0.1-1000 ng/ml were added in culture to 48-h serum-starved PC12 cells for 10 min before performing the PI 3-kinase assay on anti-p85 immunoprecipitates. A concentration-dependent activation was observed, with maximum stimulation occurring at 1 ng/ml Tat. Higher concentrations of Tat were less effective (data not shown). The fungal metabolite WT has been shown to inhibit PI 3-kinase activity in various cell types when used at nanomolar concentrations (11Okada T. Sakuma L. Fukui Y. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3563-3567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 48 h serum-starved PC12 cells were pretreated for 20 min with 100 n WT and then supplemented for additional 10 min with 1 ng/ml Tat protein. The Tat-mediated elevation of PI 3-kinase activity was completely blocked by a brief exposure to WT, which also suppressed the basal catalytic activity still present in serum-starved PC12 cells left untreated. Pretreatment of 1 ng/ml Tat with 1 μg/ml anti-Tat but not anti-p24 mAb for 30 min also completely abolished the Tat-induced increase in PI 3-kinase activity. In addition, the in vitro treatment with WT completely blocked PI 3-kinase activity and Nonidet P-40, an in vitro inhibitor of PI 3-kinase but not of PI 4-kinase or other lipid kinases (12Fukui Y. Hanafusa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1651-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), suppressed the catalytic activity associated with p85 immunoprecipitates (data not shown). Since an anti-Tyr(P) antibody precipitated PI 3-kinase activity from Tat-stimulated cells, we investigated the effect of Tat on protein-Tyr phosphorylation in PC12 cells. Increased Tyr phosphorylation was observed on at least five proteins of molecular masses between 200 and 66 kDa (Fig. 2, left panel). In next experiments, p85 immunoprecipitates were blotted with anti-Tyr(P) to determine whether Tat stimulates direct phosphorylation of this protein. A small increase in a doublet band at 85 kDa was observed in anti-Tyr(P) blotting (Fig. 2, right panel), but this increase peaked at 1 min, while PI 3-kinase activity peaked much later (Fig. 1). In this report, we have demonstrated that extracellular HIV-1 Tat protein promotes the activation of PI 3-kinase in PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells. PI 3-kinase phosphorylates the D-3 position of the inositol ring of phosphoinositols and produces D-3 phosphoinositides (phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate). Increasing experimental evidence indicates that D-3 phosphorylated inositides represent a class of second messenger molecules, which can activate specific protein kinase C isoforms and Akt-Ser/Thr kinase, interact with SH2 domains and induce cytoskeletal rearrangement (13Nakanishi H. Brewer K.A. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kaziauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N.

Biol. 1993; 13: 6052-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). PI 3-kinase is often found in cellular complexes with ligand-activated growth factor receptors and oncogene protein-tyrosine kinases. Activation of the mammalian PI 3-kinase complex can play a critical role in transducing growth factor responses. The lipid kinase complex has been implicated in a variety of cell functions, including mitogenesis, cell transformation, etc. (16Kapeller R. Cantley L.C. BioEssays. 1994; 16: 565-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). Moreover, a role for PI 3-kinase in the promotion of neuronal cell survival has been recently demonstrated by Yao and Cooper (8Yao R. Cooper M.G. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). These authors have shown that NGF counteracts the apoptotic cell death program induced by serum withdrawal in PC12 cells by activating PI 3-kinase. In this respect, it is particularly noteworthy that we have previously demonstrated that recombinant Tat is also able to protect PC12 cells from apoptosis induced by serum withdrawal (4Zauli G. Gibellini D. Milani D. Mazzoni M. Borgatti P. La Placa M. Capitani S. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4481-4485PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown here that 1 ng/ml Tat potently stimulates PI 3-kinase, reaching values of activation (approximately 20-fold increase with respect to the basal level) significantly higher than those observed in PC12 cell cultures supplemented with 100 ng/ml NGF (8-fold increase with respect to the basal level). Therefore, PI 3-kinase may represent a common intracellular target for both NGF and Tat protein. It is also noteworthy that activation of PI 3-kinase was achieved with picomolar concentrations of recombinant Tat, which are likely to be physiologically present in vivo, since similar concentrations have been detected in the supernatant of HIV-1-infected cells (2Ensoli B. Barillari G. Zaki Salahuddin S. Gallo R.C. Wong-Staal F. Nature. 1990; 345: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 7Zauli G. La Placa M. Vignoli M. Re M.C. Gibellini D. Furlini G. Milani D. Marchisio M. Mazzoni M. Capitani S. J. AIDS. 1995; 10: 306-316Google Scholar) as well as in the sera of some HIV-1-infected individuals (17Westendorp M.O. Frank R. Ochsenbauer C. Stricker K. Dhein J. Walczak H. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). On the other hand, 0.1-1 μg/ml Tat protein were less efficient in promoting PI 3-kinase activation. Consistently, these high concentrations of Tat were unable to promote cell survival and instead showed a toxic effect on both neuronal and lymphoid cell types (6Li C.J. Friedman D.J. Wang C. Metelev V. Pardee A.B. Science. 1995; 268: 229-2318Crossref Scopus (549) Google Scholar, 17Westendorp M.O. Frank R. Ochsenbauer C. Stricker K. Dhein J. Walczak H. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H. Nature. 1995; 375: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 18Magnuson D.S. Knudsen B.E. Geiger J.D. Brownstone R.M. Nath A. Ann. Neurol. 1995; 37: 373-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). This cytotoxic activity was likely due to the up-regulation of cellular genes encoding for inhibitory cytokines (19Zauli G. Davis B.R. Re M.C. Visani G. Furlini G. La Placa M. Blood. 1992; 80: 3036-3043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Buonaguro L. Barillari G. Chang H.K. Bohan C.A. Kao V. Morgan R. Gallo R.C. Ensoli B. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 7159-7167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since extracellular Tat can be rapidly taken up by intact cells and concentrate into the nucleus (21Frankel A.D. Pabo C.O. Cell. 1988; 55: 1189-1193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2353) Google Scholar), a possible explanation for many of the biological effects of Tat, including the prevention from apoptosis, is a direct gene transactivation (22Mann D.A. Frankel A.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1733-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). However, several lines of evidence suggest that extracellular Tat may also specifically interact with surface receptors. Although the demonstration of a high affinity receptor for extracellular Tat protein is still lacking, various integrins (αvβ3, α5β1, αvβ5) have been proposed as putative receptors for extracellular Tat (23Brake D.A. Debouck C. Biesecher G. J. Cell. Biol. 1990; 111: 1275-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 24Barillari G. Gendelman R. Gallo R.C. Ensoli B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1993; 121: 461-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Moreover, Weeks et al. (26Weeks B.S. Desai K. Loewenstein P.M. Klotman M.E. Klotman P. Green M. Kleinman H.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5279-5284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have described the existence of a 90-kDa surface receptor that was specifically immunoprecipitated by an anti-Tat mAb from the surface of PC12 cells. Several considerations favor the hypothesis that extracellular Tat activates PI 3-kinase acting through a surface receptor. (i) Various integrins have been shown to activate protein-tyrosine kinases, such as p125FAK (27Zachary I. Rozengurt E. Cell. 1992; 71: 891-894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Consistently, we have shown that Tat induced an early (1 min) tyrosine phosphorylation of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase, which acts as an adaptor protein allowing the p110 catalytic subunit to interact with receptor and nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. (ii) Maximal activation of PI 3-kinase was obtained with concentrations of Tat as low as 1 ng/ml, while higher concentrations were less efficient in activating PI 3-kinase. This renders less likely the possibility that Tat must be internalized in order to activate PI 3-kinase.

https://openalex.org/W2127338105,"Long tracts of CCG trinucleotide or CCGNN pentanucleotide repeats in DNA have previously been shown to resist assembly into nucleosomes. This may provide a molecular explanation for the nature of certain rare, folate-sensitive fragile sites in human chromosomes that contain expanded CCG triplet tracts. Further, it is known that methylation of CpG dinucleotides at or near these fragile sites enhances the fragile phenotype. Here DNAs containing 76 tandem CCG triplets or 48 CCGNN pentanucleotide repeats were methylated with SssI methylase at three different levels of methylation. Using competitive nucleosome reconstitution/gel shift assays, the ability of these DNAs and a mixed sequence DNA from the pUC19 plasmid were compared in their ability to assemble into nucleosomes. DNA methylation had no significant effect on nucleosome formation over the pUC 19 fragment. However, the highly methylated DNAs containing 76 CCG triplets or 48 CCGNN pentanucleotide repeats were 2.0 ± 0.2-fold and 2.1 ± 0.3-fold less efficient in nucleosome assembly than the respective unmethylated forms, and 4.4 ± 0.4-fold and 12.6 ± 1.6-fold less efficient than a pUC19 fragment of similar length.

In eukaryotic cells methylation of CpG dinucleotides by DNA methyltransferase can directly inhibit gene expression (reviewed in Ref. 1Tate P.H. Bird A.P. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). This enzyme, which places a methyl group on the cytosine residues of 5′-CpG-3′ dinucleotides, has been isolated from several species and shown to play an important role in embryonic development (2Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3116) Google Scholar). The inhibition of transcription by methylation has been shown to be mediated by the binding of a methyl-CpG-binding protein (MeCP-1) 1The abbreviations used are: MeCP-1methyl-CpG-binding proteinFRAXfragile X syndromebpbase pair(s)DHFRdihydrofolate reductase. to DNA sequences containing methylated CpG dinucleotides, with the degree of inhibition depending on the degree of methylation (3Boyes J.

DNA methylation also plays a direct role in certain pathological processes, for example in the fragile X syndrome (FRAX). This disease results from the inactivation of the FMR-1 gene, which encodes an RNA-binding protein (5Ashley Jr., C.T. Wilkinson K.D. Reines D. Warren S.T.

Cell. 1993; 74: 291-298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). A block of repeating CCG triplets, which varies from 5 to 50 repeats in normal individuals, was mapped to the 5′-untranslated region of this gene (7Kremer E.J. Pritchard M. Lynch M. Yu S. Holman K.

In carriers of FRAX, the triplet block frequently contains 60-190 triplet repeats and in individuals with the frank disease, expansions to 200 or more repeats are common. Here there is a strong correlation between the severity of the disease and the degree of methylation of CpG dinucleotides in the region of the expanded CCG repeats, with higher levels of methylation being more deleterious (9Pieretti M.

The fragile X syndrome was named for the presence of a rare, folate-sensitive fragile site on the X chromosome (FRAXA) whose appearance correlates with the disease. Fragile sites are defined cytologically as loci that exhibit properties of unstable chromatin, and they stain poorly and exhibit uncondensed gaps or enhanced DNA fragmentation. At FRAXA, the CCG repeat block itself is the site of preferential chromosomal breakage (7Kremer E.J. Pritchard M. Lynch M. Yu S. Holman K. Baker E. Warren S.T. Schlessinger D. Sutherland G.R.

Recently, expanded CCG triplet blocks have been correlated with four other rare, folate-sensitive fragile sites in the human genome, FRAXE, FRAXF, FRA16A, and FRA11B (11Homstra I.K. Nelson D.L.

In all five cases, the expression of the fragile site depends directly on the size of the triplet repeat block and the degree of methylation of the CCG repeats and adjacent CpG islands. To investigate the molecular basis of these fragile sites, we recently examined the ability of DNA containing long blocks of CCG triplet repeats to assemble into nucleosomes. Using a combination of electron microscopy and competitive nucleosome reconstitution assays, we showed (16Wang Y.-H. Gellibolian R. Shimizu M. Wells R.D. Griffith J. 1996Google Scholar) that blocks of >50 contiguous CCG repeats strongly exclude nucleosomes, providing a possible explanation for the unstable chromatin phenotype. To test a specific model of nucleosome exclusion, we synthesized a model DNA containing repeating CCGNN pentanucleotides and demonstrated that a tract of 48 such repeats also strongly excludes nucleosomes (17Wang Y.-H. Griffith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Because the expression of the five fragile sites described above depends on the degree of methylation, it seemed important to examine the effects of DNA methylation on the ability of DNAs containing CCG or CCGNN repeats to assemble into chromatin. In this study, we have used competitive nucleosome reconstitution/gel retardation assays to investigate this issue and show that methylation inhibits nucleosome formation 2-fold beyond the inherent exclusion due to the sequences themselves. This observation provides further support for a model in which nucleosome exclusion creates unstable chromatin at these fragile sites, which may further facilitate the binding of the MeCP-1 protein to inhibit transcription from this region. Plasmid p(CCGNN)48 contains four head-to-tail copies of 5′-CCGTA CCGAT CCGAA CCGGA CCGCT CCGAG CCGTC CCGTG CCGCA CCGGC CCGTT CCGAT-3′. This 240-base pair (bp) repeat block is termed here (CCGNN)48. A 268-bp fragment containing this element and a few nucleotides from the vector was obtained by EcoRI and XbaI digestion of p(CCGNN)48 (17Wang Y.-H. Griffith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). A 282-bp fragment containing the (CCG)76 repeat was obtained by AvaI digestion of pRW3376 (18Shimizu M. Gellibolian R. Oostra B.A. Wells R.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 258: 614-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and a 262-bp pUC 19 fragment was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification using primer pairs from nucleotide 239 to 263 and from nucleotide 477 to 500. Restriction endonuclease-treated fragments or polymerase chain reaction products were purified by electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide gels, eluted with a solution containing 0.5 ammonium acetate, 1 m EDTA, and 0.1% SDS, and the purified DNAs were dephosphorylated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (New England Biolabs), then labeled with T4 DNA kinase (New England Biolabs) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham). SssI methylase (New England Biolabs) was used to methylate cytosines in CpG dinucleotides (19Nur I. Szyf M. Razin A. Glaser G. Rottem S. Razin S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 19-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction buffer contains 160 μ S-adenosylmethionine, 50 m NaCl, 10 m Tris·HCl, pH 7.9, and 10 m EDTA and no Mg2+ was included in the reaction to avoid the topoisomerase activity in SssI methylase preparations (20Matsuo K. Silke J. Gramatikoff K. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5354-5359Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out at 37°C for 2 h using 0.25-6 units of SssI methylase, and DNAs were then extracted with phenol and chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. The degree of methylation was determined by resistance to cleavage with a methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease HhaI for the (CCG)76-containing DNA and the pUC 19 fragment (Fig. 1) and BsrFI for the (CCGNN)48-containing DNA. DNA fragments labeled with 32P (50 ng) were mixed with 10 μg of unlabeled calf thymus DNA and 2.5 μg of histone octamers (isolated from HeLa cells; Ref. 21Hsieh C.-H. Griffith J.D. Cell. 1988; 52: 535-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) in a solution containing 2 NaCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma). The total DNA added is roughly equivalent to a 4-fold molar excess over the histone octamers. The salt was slowly lowered in increments of 0.1 to a final concentration of 0.1 by adding a solution of 20 m HEPES, 1 m EDTA, pH 7.5 (5 min for each step at room temperature). The assembly mixtures were then directly electrophoresed on 5% polyacrylamide gels at 150 V for 4 h at room temperature to separate free DNA from the nucleosome-assembled DNA. Samples were visualized by autoradiography. The amounts of DNA in each band were determined by PhosphorImager scanning (Molecular Dynamics). Each DNA was reconstituted in three separate but identical experiments. To examine the influence of DNA methylation on nucleosome formation over DNAs containing long tracts of CCG, or CCGNN repeats, SssI methylase was used to place a methyl group on the C5 position of cytosines within the 5′-CpG-3′ dinucleotides (19Nur I. Szyf M. Razin A. Glaser G. Rottem S. Razin S. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 164: 19-24Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two parallel sets of experiments were carried out. In one, a 262-bp fragment from pUC19 was compared to a 282-bp DNA containing 76 tandem CCG repeats (16Wang Y.-H. Gellibolian R. Shimizu M. Wells R.D. Griffith J. 1996Google Scholar). In the second set, the same pUC19 fragment was compared to a 268-bp fragment containing 48 contiguous CCGNN repeats (17Wang Y.-H. Griffith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). The number of possible methylation sites for the pUC19 fragment, the CCG-containing DNA, and the CCGNN-containing DNA is 40, 164, and 102, respectively. For the first set, the two DNAs were incubated with 0, 1, or 6 units of SssI methylase for 2 h at 37°C. The level of methylation was estimated from the cleavage pattern by the methylation-sensitive restriction endonuclease HhaI (Fig. 1). These two DNAs each contain a single HhaI site, and thus the resistance to cleavage by HhaI provides a direct measure of the level of methylation of the DNA. The amount of DNA in each band of the HhaI treated samples was determined by PhosphorImager scanning. The level of methylation was 0, 95%, and ∼100% for the pUC 19 fragment and 0, 45%, and 89% for the (CCG)76 DNAs. For the second set of DNAs, the pUC 19 fragment was treated with 0, 0.25, or 1 units of methylase to achieve degrees of methylation of 0, 36%, and 43% and the (CCGNN)48 DNA was treated with 0, 0.5, and 4 units of methylase to methylate at 0, 12%, and 62%, respectively (data not shown). Competitive nucleosome reconstitution was used to measure the energetics of nucleosome formation over the CCG and CCGNN repeats as compared to a pUC 19 DNA of the same size. For these assays, 50 ng of each DNA fragment (labeled with 32P) methylated at three different levels was mixed with a 200-fold excess of unlabeled calf thymus DNA (10 μg) and 2.5 μg of histone octamers in a solution containing 2 NaCl. The salt was lowered stepwise to 0.1 NaCl and the mixture electrophoresed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel to separate free DNA from the nucleosome-assembled DNA (Fig. 2) (see “Experimental Procedures”). The results, summarized in Table I (panel A) present the ratio of the nucleosome-assembled DNA to free DNA for the pUC19 fragment and the (CCG)76 DNA fragment each with three different degrees of methylation. This analysis showed that DNA methylation had no measurable influence on nucleosome formation for the pUC 19 fragment, an observation noted in several previous studies (22Felsenfeld G. Nickol J. Behe M. McGhee J.D. Jackson D. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1982; 47: 577-584Crossref Google Scholar, 23Drew H.R. McCall M.J. J. Mol.

In contrast, the (CCG)76 DNA methylated at 89% of the available sites was 2.0 ± 0.2-fold less effective in nucleosome assembly compared to the same (CCG)76 DNA fragment that was unmethylated, and 4.4 ± 0.4-fold less effective relative to the pUC19 fragment. The difference in free energy between the methylated (at 89%) and the unmethylated (CCG)76 DNA is 405 ± 44 cal/mol. With respect to the pUC19 DNA, the methylated (at 89%) (CCG)76 DNA is 880 ± 54 cal/mol less favorable.Table ICompetitive nucleosome reconstitution with methylated DNAsSampleMethylationComplex DNA/free DNAFree energy%cal/molA.pUC19 (262 bp)010009590 ± 955 ± 54100105 ± 7−21 ± 36(CCG)76 (282 bp)045 ± 2475 ± 154537 ± 2595 ± 328923 ± 2880 ± 54B.pUC19 (262 bp)010003691 ± 949 ± 464398 ± 110 ± 59(CCGNN)48 (268 bp)016 ± 11074 ± 201213 ± 01209 ± 0628 ± 11498 ± 75 Open table in a new tab Similar results were obtained when the pUC19 fragment was compared to the 268-bp fragment containing 48 tandem CCGNN repeats (Table I, panel B; Fig. 3). The (CCGNN)48 DNA fragment methylated at 62% of the available sites was 2.1 ± 0.3-fold and 12.6 ± 1.6-fold less effective in nucleosome formation compared to the unmethylated (CCGNN)48 DNA and the pUC 19 fragment, respectively. These efficiencies correspond to 425 ± 93 and 1498 ± 75 cal/mol differences in free energy, respectively. In this study, the effect of methylation of CpG dinucleotides on the ability of DNAs containing CCG or CCGNN repeats to assemble into nucleosomes was investigated. This analysis showed that DNAs containing ∼228-240 bp of continuous repeats, which are already severalfold less efficient in nucleosome assembly over mixed sequence DNAs, were further repressed in assembly following methylation. The greatest difference was observed with a fragment containing the (CCGNN)48 repeat block. When this DNA was highly methylated, it was nearly 13-fold less effective in nucleosome assembly as compared to a mixed sequence DNA of the same size. Here methylation further increased the nucleosome exclusion due to sequence effects alone by ∼2-fold. These results combined with the previous data provide a likely explanation for the molecular basis of the rare, folate-sensitive fragile sites, since the appearance of the fragile sites is directly linked to the increased length of the CCG triplet blocks and the high degree of methylation at the G/C-rich regions. The CCG and CCGNN repeating sequences are both members of a repeating motif: ((G/C)3NN)n. In a recent model study (17Wang Y.-H. Griffith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar), we synthesized DNAs containing (CCGNN)n repeats to test the hypothesis that (G/C)3 wedges, which bend preferentially only into the major groove of DNA, would, when spaced by 2 nucleotides, generate a DNA that would resist wrapping around the histone core of a nucleosome. This was based on the work of Shrader and Crothers (25Shrader T.E. Crothers D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7418-7422Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 26Shrader T.E. Crothers D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 216: 69-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), which showed that DNA containing alternating major groove ((G/C)3) and minor groove ((A/T)3) wedges spaced by 2 nucleotides will preferentially wrap around the histone octamer to form nucleosomes. Sequence match analysis of the GenBank data base against 240 bp of a ((G/C)3NN)48 repeating sequence revealed many matches, and 75 examples showed ≥85% sequence match over 200 bp of this motif. Many of these were present in or near the control regions for eukaryotic genes (17Wang Y.-H. Griffith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). Among them, the 5′ control regions of the human dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and ETS-2 genes have been probed for nuclease-hypersensitive sites in vivo (often identified as nucleosome-free regions) and the nuclease-hypersensitive regions (27Shimada T. Inokuchi K. Nienhuis A.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 145-1445Google Scholar, 28Mavrothalassitis G.J. Watson D.K. Papas T.S. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1337-1342PubMed Google Scholar) were found to overlap with the regions containing the ((G/C)3NN)48 motif. It remains unknown how heavily methylated these loci may be, however from the findings described here, methylation of these regions could influence gene expression by further promoting nucleosome exclusion. The DHFR, ETS-2, and several other genes that show sequence matches with the ((C/G)3NN)48 motif are genes regulated by promoters lacking a TATA box. The “TATA-less” family includes many housekeeping genes, several oncogenes, and genes encoding growth factors and transcription factors (29Azizkhan J.C. Jensen D.E. Pierce A.J. Wade M. Crit. Rev. Eukaryotic Gene Exp. 1993; 3: 229-254PubMed Google Scholar). We suggested that the ((C/G)3NN)48-like sequences in these genes may provide a mechanism that keeps the promoter regions accessible to transcription factors in part by excluding nucleosomes. Pugh and Tjian (30Pugh B.F. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1935-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that Sp1 is required in the initiation of transcription from TATA-less promoters by TFIID. Sp1 is a general transcription factor that recognizes the consensus sequence: 5′-(G/T)GGGCGGG(G/A)2(C/T)-3′ (31Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Tjian R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1986; 11: 20-23Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (875) Google Scholar). This sequence is very G/C-rich and thus resembles the ((G/C)3NN)n motif. Indeed a GenBank sequence analysis revealed many sites that had been shown to be Sp1 binding sites within the sequences identified as having high degree of sequence matches to the ((G/C)3NN)48 sequence. It has been demonstrated that methylation at the CpG dinucleotides of the Sp1 binding sites does not affect binding of Sp1 (32Harrington M.A. Jones P.A. Imagawa M. Karin M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2066-2070Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 33Holler M. Westin G. Jiricny J. Schaffner W. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1127-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Therefore, methylation of the DNA may increase the accessibility of the Sp1 binding sites within the promoter regions by inhibiting chromatinization while simultaneously not altering its affinity for Sp1 protein. The overall effect would be to facilitate initiation of transcription from TATA-less promoters. The free energy differences in nucleosome assembly between the methylated and unmethylated DNA are relatively low (Table I). However, in the cell, at physiological ionic strength and in the presence of histone H1 and other factors, these differences may be large enough to have strong biological effects and are likely to increase in strength as the size of the repeat tract lengthens. Furthermore, little has been known about how these values translate into nucleosome stability under physiological salt conditions. However, the examples of the DHFR and ETS-2 genes (17Wang Y.-H. Griffith J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar) cited above argue that the free energy of nucleosome formation measured in vitro by gel retardation methods are physiologically relevant. In addition, the strong correlation between the unstable chromatin phenotype of the rare folate-sensitive fragile sites and the unfavorable energies of nucleosome formation of repeating CCG DNA, in particular when methylated, further argues that the range of free energies measured in vitro provide insight into the range of chromatin stability in vivo. Myotonic dystrophy is a human genetic disease also linked to expansions of repeating triplets, in particular a block of CTG triplet repeats found in the 3′-untranslated region of the myotonic dystrophy protein kinase gene (34Fu Y.-H. Pizzuti A. Fenwick Jr., R.G. King J. Rajnarayan S. Dunne P.W. Dubel J. Nasser G.A. Ashizawa T. De Jong P. Wieringa B. Korneluk R. Perryman M.B. Epstein H.F. Caskey C.T.

Earle-MacDonald J. De Jong P.J. Wieringa B. Korneluk R.G. Science. 1992; 255: 1253-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1378) Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that DNA containing long CTG triplet repeats from myotonic dystrophy patients form hyperstable nucleosomes (36Wang Y.-H. Amirhaeri S. Kang S. Wells R.D. Griffith J.D. Science. 1994; 265: 669-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 37Wang Y.-H. Griffith J.D. Genomics. 1995; 25: 570-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and suggested that this could alter the local chromatin structure to create the pathology. Thus, two repeating triplets involved in human genetic diseases: CTG and (methylated) CCG generate chromatin that is either hyperstable or hypostable. Indeed, we estimate that there may be a 80-fold difference in the stability of chromatin containing long tracts of these two triplet repeats. The data presented here support a general proposal for the role of CCG repeats and methylation in the generation and expression of fragile sites containing these triplet repeats (Fig. 4). Long repeating CCG triplet blocks inhibit chromatinization of DNA (16Wang Y.-H. Gellibolian R. Shimizu M. Wells R.D. Griffith J. 1996Google Scholar), which would increase the accessibility of these regions to DNA methyltransferase. Methylation in turn would further repress chromatinization and make the DNA more available for binding by methyl-CpG-binding proteins, which have been shown to repress transcription (3Boyes J. Bird A. Cell. 1991; 64: 1123-1134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar, 4Boyes J. Bird A. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 327-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Thus, these changes promoted by methylation would lead to the simultaneous generation of a fragile site and the repression of nearby genes such as the FMR-1 gene."

We studied the influence of overexpression of c-myc oncogene on megakaryopoiesis and endomitosis in vivo, using transgenic mice carrying c-myc fused to the estrogen receptor under the control of the platelet factor 4 (PF4) megakaryocyte-specific promoter. The rationale behind this strategy was to obtain controlled overexpression of an active c-Myc, depending on the estrogen level in the mouse circulation. Analysis of these transgenic mice revealed that the bone marrow of female transgenic mice or of estrogen-injected male transgenic mice, but not of age-matched transgenic males nor nontransgenic females, contained frequent immature myeloid cells and an increased number of megakaryocytes. Deregulated expression of c-Myc shifted the normal ploidy profile of megakaryocytes due to a significant increase in proliferating megakaryocytes and a decrease in the fraction of ploidizing cells. These transgenic mice represent a novel in vivo model for a Myc-induced myeloproliferative disorder which can be controlled. Platelets, essential for vascular integrity and hemostasis, fragment from polyploid megakaryocytes, characterized by their endomitotic cell cycle. We studied the influence of overexpression of c-myc oncogene on megakaryopoiesis and endomitosis in vivo, using transgenic mice carrying c-myc fused to the estrogen receptor under the control of the platelet factor 4 (PF4) megakaryocyte-specific promoter. The rationale behind this strategy was to obtain controlled overexpression of an active c-Myc, depending on the estrogen level in the mouse circulation. Analysis of these transgenic mice revealed that the bone marrow of female transgenic mice or of estrogen-injected male transgenic mice, but not of age-matched transgenic males nor nontransgenic females, contained frequent immature myeloid cells and an increased number of megakaryocytes. Deregulated expression of c-Myc shifted the normal ploidy profile of megakaryocytes due to a significant increase in proliferating megakaryocytes and a decrease in the fraction of ploidizing cells. These transgenic mice represent a novel in vivo model for a Myc-induced myeloproliferative disorder which can be controlled. Platelet precursors, the megakaryocytes, undergo an endomitotic cell cycle whereby they replicate DNA but do not undergo cytokinesis. This unique cell cycle leads to the formation of polyploid cells which mature and subdivide their cytoplasm into platelets (reviewed by Mazur (30Mazur E.M. Exp. Hematol. 1987; 15: 340-350PubMed Google Scholar)). A normal cell cycle in eukaryotic cells consists of a tightly regulated sequence of phases including, gap (G1), DNA synthesis (S) followed by a gap (G2), and mitosis (M). Progression through the cell cycle is regulated by cyclin-dependent protein kinases (reviewed by Cross et al. (8Cross F. Roberts H. Weintranb H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5P: 341-349Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar)), which are essential for the start of the S phase (Blow and Nurse, 3Blow J.J. Nurse P. Cell. 1990; 62: 855-862Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and Cdc2 for the start of mitosis (Nurse, 33Nurse P. Nature. 1990; 344: 503-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). The binding of the mitotic cyclin, cyclin B, to Cdc2 induces phosphorylation and activation of the mitosis promoting factor which is essential for the G2 to M transition (Gould et al., 15Gould K.L. Moreno S. Owen D.J. Sazer S. Nurse P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3202-3297Crossref Scopus (327) Google Scholar; Pines and Hunter, 37Pines J. Hunter T. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2987-2991Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Cdk2 associates with cyclin E in the middle of G1 phase (Koff et al., 23Koff A. Giordano A. Desai D. Yamashita K. Harper J.W. Elledge S. Nishimoto T. Morgan D.D. Franza B.R. Roberts J.M. Science. 1992; 257: 1689-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar) and complexes with cyclin A at the start of S phase (Tsai et al., 46Tsai L.H. Harlow E. Meyerson M. Nature. 1991; 353: 174-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Other studies also show that cyclin D, differentially expressed in different cell types, can regulate G1 progression via interaction with either Cdk2, Cdk4, or Cdk5 (Matsushime et al., 28Matsushime H. Roussel M.F. Ashmun R.A. Sherr C.J. Cell. 1991; 65: 701-713Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar, 29Matsushime H. Quelle D.E. Shurtleff S.A. Shibuya M. Sherr C.J. Kato J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2066-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). During the formation of polyploid cells in the megakaryocytic lineage, the cells undergo a cell cycle containing Gap and S phases, but lacking cytokinesis (Wang et al., 48Wang Z. Zhang Y. Kamen D. Lees E. Ravid K. Blood. 1995; 86: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Odell et al., 34Odell T.T. Jackson Jr., C.W. Reiter R.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1968; 53: 321-328Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, little is known about the role of specific genes in megakaryocyte polyploidization. In a recent study we found that the endomitotic cell cycle in this cell type is associated with a reduced level of cyclin B1 and high level of the G1 phase cyclin, cyclin D3 (Wang et al., 48Wang Z. Zhang Y. Kamen D. Lees E. Ravid K. Blood. 1995; 86: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Zhang et al., 50Zhang Y. Wang Z. Ravid K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4266-4272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). One oncogene whose protein product plays a well-established role in the regulation of the cell cycle, cell growth, and differentiation is c-myc (reviewed by Kelly and Siebenlist (22Kelly K. Siebenlist U. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1986; 4: 317-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar)). Myc expression is sufficient to induce cells to enter the S phase of the cell cycle (reviewed by Cory (7Cory S. Adv. Cancer Res. 1986; 47: 189-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar)). Expression of Myc is induced following mitogenic stimulation, is shut off during entry into quiescence, and its expression is deregulated in various neoplasias (Cole, 6Cole M.D. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1986; 20: 361-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar; Marcu et al., 27Marcu K.B. Bossone S.A. Patel A.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 809-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These effects of Myc were attributed to its ability to bind growth suppressors such as the retinoblastoma gene product (Rustgi et al., 41Rustgi A. Dyson N. Bernards R. Nature. 1991; 352: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar), to act as a sequence-specific transcriptional regulator (Amin et al., 1Amin C. Wagner A.J. Hay N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and to induce DNA replication (Classon et al., 5Classon M. Henriksson M. Sumegi J. Klien G. Hammaskjold M.L. Nature. 1987; 330: 272-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Recently, c-Myc was also connected to apoptosis, as overexpression of Myc in cells deprived of serum-induced programmed cell death (Evan et al., 13Evan G.I. Wyllie A.H. Gilbert C.S. Littlewood T.D. Land H. Brooks M. Waters C.M. Penn L.Z. Hancock D.C. Cell. 1992; 69: 119-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2773) Google Scholar). Earlier studies measured c-Myc mRNA levels in isolated megakaryocytes and in hematopoietic cell lines that can be induced to express megakaryocytic features (Dorn et al., 10Dorn G.W. Davis M.G. D'Angelo A.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1231-C1239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Eckhardt et al., 11Eckhardt S.G. Dai A. Davidson K.K. Forseth B.J. Wahl G.M. Von Hoff D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6674-6678Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar; Gewirtz and Shen, 14Gewirtz A.M. Shen Y.M. Exp. Hematol. 1990; 18: 945-952PubMed Google Scholar). However, the effects of altered c-Myc expression on megakaryopoiesis and platelet production in vivo have not been described. Since megakaryocyte precursor proliferation occurs prior to megakaryocyte polyploidization, and the cell undergoing polyploidization is more differentiated than the cell undergoing cell division, we hypothesized that c-Myc overexpression in early megakaryocytes may increase precursor proliferation and, thus, decrease the fraction of polyploid cells. We have tested this hypothesis by using a transgenic model with constitutive overexpression of c-Myc in the megakaryocytic lineage in vivo. The model was constructed by targeting the conditionally active c-Myc estrogen receptor chimeric protein (Eilers et al., 12Eilers M. Picard D. Yamamoto K. Bishop M.J. Nature. 1989; 340: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) to megakaryocytes and platelets via the platelet factor 4 (PF4) 6The abbreviations used are: PF4platelet factor 4kbkilobase(s)HGHhuman growth hormonePCRpolymerase chain reactionPBSphosphate-buffered saline. megakaryocyte-specific promoter (Ravid et al., 38Ravid K. Beeler D.L. Rabin M.S. Ruley H.E. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1521-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). This approach was taken in order to establish an in vivo model with controlled activation of c-Myc, depending on estrogen level in the mouse. Our results support the hypothesis that c-Myc overexpression induces megakaryocyte precursor proliferation at the expense of polyploidization. platelet factor 4 kilobase(s) human growth hormone polymerase chain reaction phosphate-buffered saline. The plasmid PF4MERGH was constructed by using gene fragments from the following PUC based plasmids: pPF4GH (Ravid et al., 39Ravid K. Doi T. Beeler D.L. Kuter D.J. Rosenberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6116-6122Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) which contains the rat 1.1-kb PF4 promoter linked to human growth hormone gene (HGH); pMV-7MER (Eilers et al., 12Eilers M. Picard D. Yamamoto K. Bishop M.J. Nature. 1989; 340: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) which contains exons 2 and 3 of human myc fused to the estrogen receptor (MER). pPF4GH has a unique NdeI site at the 5′ end of the PF4 promoter, a unique EcoRI site at the 3′ end of the HGH gene and a unique BanII site 20 bp downstream of the transcriptional start. The plasmid was digested with EcoRI and BanII to release the HGH gene. The resulting PUC 19-PF4 promoter fragment (with EcoRI/BanII cohesive ends) was ligated to the 2.4-kb MER fusion gene fragment (Eilers et al., 12Eilers M. Picard D. Yamamoto K. Bishop M.J. Nature. 1989; 340: 66-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar), the latter obtained by digesting pMV-7MER (generous gift of Dr. Michael Bishop) with EcoRI. This ligation was done in the presence of the BanII/EcoRI linker TCGGTTAA which destroys the BanII site. The orientation of insertion was tested by DNA sequencing (Ravid et al., 39Ravid K. Doi T. Beeler D.L. Kuter D.J. Rosenberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6116-6122Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) of the resulting plasmid, termed PF4MER. We next introduced a 442-base pair region of the HGH poly(A) tail starting from the stop codon of the HGH gene (Selden et al., 42Selden R.F. Howie K.B. Rowe M.E. Goodman H.M. Moore D.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3173-3179Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The poly(A) fragment was generated by PCR of pPF4GH (Ravid et al., 39Ravid K. Doi T. Beeler D.L. Kuter D.J. Rosenberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6116-6122Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), with primers which also introduced a unique KpnI site at the 3′ end of the poly(A) tail. The plasmid containing the PF4 promoter, followed by MER and the HGH poly(A) tail, was termed PF4MERGH. This later plasmid also had unique SacI sites at both ends of the MER gene. The DNA sequence of the final construct pPF4MERGH was verified (Ravid et al., 39Ravid K. Doi T. Beeler D.L. Kuter D.J. Rosenberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6116-6122Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and subsequently digested with NdeI and KpnI to free the genes from vector sequences. The resulting 3.9-kb fragment which contained the PF4 promoter followed by MER, followed by the HGH poly(A) tail, was purified as described before (Ravid et al., 38Ravid K. Beeler D.L. Rabin M.S. Ruley H.E. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1521-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and used for producing transgenic mice as described below. The DNA fragment was injected into one-cell embryos at a concentration of 3 μg/ml to produce transgenic mice, all as described previously (Ravid et al., 38Ravid K. Beeler D.L. Rabin M.S. Ruley H.E. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1521-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Foster mice females were of the CD1 strain (Charles River Breeding Laboratories), and the microinjected eggs were of the FVB strain (Taconic Farms, Germantown, NY). Mice were screened for transgenic integration by Southern blot analysis of tail DNA, using MER as a probe (Ravid et al., 38Ravid K. Beeler D.L. Rabin M.S. Ruley H.E. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1521-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Transgene expression was detected by reverse transcriptase-PCR. To this end, a HGH poly(A)-specific sense primer (TTGCGGCCGCGAATTCCTGCCCGGGTGGCATCC) and an antisense primer consisting of 17 T residues were used to amplify DNA reverse-transcribed from RNA prepared from bone marrow of transgenic or normal mice, all as described before (Ravid et al., 38Ravid K. Beeler D.L. Rabin M.S. Ruley H.E. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1521-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 39Ravid K. Doi T. Beeler D.L. Kuter D.J. Rosenberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6116-6122Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Injection of estrogen in the form of Premarin (Ayerst Laboratories, Philadelphia, PA) was performed as follows. A stock solution of Premarin phosphate-buffered saline of 200 μg/ml was prepared under sterile conditions. Male mice, wild type or transgenic, were anesthetized, and the large muscle of the hind limb was injected with 100 μl of the stock Premarin using a tuberculin syringe and a 301/2-gauge needle. Injections were given every other day, alternating from left to right hind limb, for up to 21 days. Bone marrow was harvested from the femurs of transgenic mice as described previously (Kuter et al., 25Kuter D.J. Greenberg S.M. Rosenberg R.D. Blood. 1989; 74: 1952-1957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Ravid et al., 39Ravid K. Doi T. Beeler D.L. Kuter D.J. Rosenberg R.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 6116-6122Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Megakaryocytes were identified by in situ staining for acetylcholine esterase as described before (Jackson, 19Jackson C.W. Blood. 1973; 42: 413-421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Ravid et al., 40Ravid K. Li Y. Rayburn H.B. Rosenberg R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1545-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Blood was collected by cardiac puncture (Ravid et al., 38Ravid K. Beeler D.L. Rabin M.S. Ruley H.E. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1521-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) into EDTA, and cells were counted in a Cell-Dyn 3500 automated blood analyzer, calibrated for rodent analyses using a Veterinary Package (Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Park, IL). Bone marrow cells were stained with rat anti-mouse CD11b (MAC-1) monoclonal antibody at a concentration of 0.5 μg/106 cells/50 μl or with rat anti-mouse TER-119-erythroid cell monoclonal antibody at a concentration of 1.5 μg/106 cells/50 μl or with rat anti-mouse stem cell antigen monoclonal antibody at a concentration of 2 μg/106 cells/50 μl. All reactions with the first antibodies (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) were done in the presence of phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum, incubated at 4°C overnight. Fluorescein-conjugated anti-rat immunoglobulin (Sigma) was used as the second antibody at a concentration of 16.7 μg/ml at 4°C for 2 h. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACScan system (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Data were collected and analyzed by Lysys program (Becton Dickinson). For immunohistochemistry, cytospun bone marrow cells were fixed in the presence of 2% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 45 min at room temperature. Slides were washed with PBS and blocked with 2% fetal bovine serum and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS, for 20 min at room temperature. This blocking solution was drained and the cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 20 μg/ml mouse monoclonal antibody to human myc (Ab-1, Oncogene Science, Cambridge, MA). Cells were washed with PBS and reacted with a secondary antibody, anti-mouse IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate, adsorbed with mouse and human Ig (Biosource International, Camarillo, CA), and diluted 125-fold. Both first and secondary antibodies were diluted in PBS supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. For peptide neutralization experiments, c-Myc antibody was reacted with a 10-fold (by weight) excess of Peptide-1 (Oncogene Science, Cambridge, MA) for 2 h at room temperature. In order to reduce background, the antibody-peptide complexes were centrifuged for 15 min at full speed in a microcentrifuge and the supernatant was discarded (according to the manufacturer's instructions). Immunohistochemistry was performed as described above, using c-Myc antibody neutralized with the peptide. Immunohistochemistry with anti-rat PF4 (generous gift of Robert D. Rosenberg) was performed as described before (Ravid et al., 40Ravid K. Li Y. Rayburn H.B. Rosenberg R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 1545-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Samples of sternum, femur, spleen, liver, heart, and lung were removed from the mouse following euthanasia. The samples were placed in a fixative (“OptimalFix,” American Histology, Lodi, CA) for shipment to the UCD Davis Transgenic Histopathology Laboratory. There, the samples were dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, sectioned at 10 microns, stained with hematoxylin and eosin, coverslipped, and presented for interpretation. The marrow contents of the femur and sternum were evaluated in three-step sections each. All the megakaryocytes in each compartment of each of the step sections were counted using a hand-held counter. Collection of bone marrow from femurs and tibias of transgenic and control mice was done as described before (Ravid et al., 38Ravid K. Beeler D.L. Rabin M.S. Ruley H.E. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1521-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar; Kuter et al., 25Kuter D.J. Greenberg S.M. Rosenberg R.D. Blood. 1989; 74: 1952-1957Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Bone marrow megakaryocytes were subjected to ploidy analyses, using a FACScan flow cytofluorometer (Becton-Dickinson) as detailed elsewhere (Jackson et al., 20Jackson C.W. Brown L.K. Somerville B.C. Lyles S.A. Look A.T. Blood. 1984; 63: 768-778Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; Shivdasani et al., 43Shivdasani R.A. Rosenblatt M.F. Zucker-Franklin D. Jackson C.W. Hunt P. Saris C.J.M. Orkin S.H. Cell. 1995; 81: 695-704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). To this end, megakaryocytes in bone marrow cell suspensions were labeled with 4A5 monoclonal antibody ascites (Burstein et al., 4Burstein S.A. Friesse P. Downs T. Mei R.-L. Exp. Hematol. 1992; 20: 1170-1177PubMed Google Scholar) (generous gift of Sam Burstein) and subsequently with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG(Fab′)2 (Tago, Inc.). DNA content of 4A5 antibody-positive cells stained with propidium iodide was determined and analyzed using a statistical package on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton-Dickinson). We used the ApopTag Plus in situ Apoptosis Detection kit (Oncor, Gaithersburg, MD) in order to determine apoptosis in individual bone marrow cells. The method which involves direct immunoperoxidase detection of digoxigenin-labeled genomic DNA was used on cytospun bone marrow cells. Cells were treated with 2% H2O2 in phosphate-buffered saline in order to quench endogenous peroxidase activity and subjected to apoptosis assay, all as described by the manufacturer. The construct used to generate transgenic mice, referred to as PF4MERGH, contains 1104 base pairs of the 5′ upstream region of the rat PF4 gene (promoter region) linked to human myc fused in-frame to the hormone binding domain of the human estrogen receptor gene (together producing MER) tagged at 3′ with the poly(A) tail of the human growth hormone gene (HGH) (Fig. 1A). This fusion gene is expressed in cells constitutively, but remains in an inactive state. Exposure to estrogen depresses the regulatory portion (hormone binding domain) of the fusion protein and thereby enables Myc to function (Eilers et al., 1989). Given that female mice contain high levels of estrogen, overexpressed Myc should be active in female, but not male, transgenic mice. The above segment of the PF4 promoter was selected because our previous transgenic studies demonstrated that the critical tissue-specific regulatory domain is located within this region (Ravid et al., 38Ravid K. Beeler D.L. Rabin M.S. Ruley H.E. Rosenberg R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1521-1525Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). PF4MERGH was microinjected into pronuclei of fertilized mouse eggs, and the injected embryos were implanted into pseudopregnant outbred females. The offspring were screened for transgene integration by Southern blot analyses of tail DNA digested with SacI, using the MER gene as a probe (Fig. 1B). Three founder mice were identified, of 66 mice produced. The offspring of founders 6 and 20 carried the transgene while founder 33 did not transfer the transgene (40 offspring mice were tested). Founders 6 and 20 exhibited about two and five copies of the transgene integrated, respectively, as compared to diluted linearized control DNAs (not shown). As to transgene expression, we could not follow it reliably by Northern blot analyses on isolated megakaryocytes, because this cell type is rare in the bone marrow. Therefore, the F1 progeny of these mice were tested for transgene expression by reverse transcriptase-PCR, using RNA prepared from bone marrow cells and DNA primers which do not recognize mouse DNA sequences, i.e. primers specific to the HGH gene fragment (Fig. 1C). The results indicated that bone marrow cells of the offspring, of both founders 6 and 20, expressed the transgene. However, the liver, skeletal muscle, heart, brain, and lung of offspring from the above founders were negative for transgene expression (not shown). We also confirmed the expression of the transgene in megakaryocytes of the transgenic mice by immunohistochemistry, using an antibody to human Myc. Bone marrow megakaryocytes derived from transgenic mice stained strongly with anti-human c-Myc (Fig. 1, D, E, H, and I). It is interesting to note that in megakaryocytes of female transgenic mice human Myc was localized primarily in the nucleus, while in male transgenic mice human Myc was detected mainly in the cytoplasm. This suggested that upon exposure to estrogen (in female mice) Myc-ER is not anchored in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1, D and E), but rather localized in the nucleus (Fig. 1, H and I). Histological evaluation of different tissues harvested from different transgenic mice, 2-5 months of age, indicated that the spleens in female transgenic mice, particularly in pregnant ones, but not in age-matched transgenic males nor in nontransgenic mice, were slightly enlarged. The average weight of the spleens in pregnant transgenic mice was increased by 24%± 5% (n = 4) (p < 0.03) as compared to nontransgenic pregnant mice. The spleens in the female transgenic mice contained abundant zones of immature myeloid cells (Fig. 2), but the lymphoid follicles and red pulps are normal. A variety of other tissues tested were normal histologically (not shown). Histological analyses of marrow in all four compartments in the sternum indicated that the nontransgenic male or female mice as well as male transgenic mice contained a similar number of megakaryocytes/compartment (30 to 35 megakaryocytes). Female transgenic mice had from 65/compartment for the non-pregnant to an average of 76 megakaryocytes/compartment for pregnant ones (Fig. 3 and Table I). Pregnancy in nontransgenic mice was associated with a marginal increase in the number of megakaryocytes (Table I), as previously observed in rats (Jackson et al., 1992). Estrogen-injected male transgenic mice, but not estrogen-injected nontransgenic male mice, displayed an augmented number of megakaryocytes (Table I). These results indicated that increased megakaryopoiesis in the transgenic mice, was estrogen-driven. Pregnancy in transgenic mice, but not in nontransgenic ones, was associated with a moderate change in platelet count (Table I).Fig. 3Histological evaluation of the sternum in transgenic mice.

In this case, megakaryocytes were identified by in situ staining with acetylcholine esterase, uniquely expressed in rodent and cat megakaryocytes (Jackson, 19Jackson C.W. Blood. 1973; 42: 413-421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by immunostaining for PF4, uniquely expressed in megakaryocytes of various species. As shown in Table II, the number of megakaryocytes in cytospun bone marrow cells was higher in transgenic mice as compared to nontransgenic mice. The majority of acetylcholine esterase-positive cells in the transgenic mice or nontransgenic mice were identified morphologically as large mature megakaryocytes. The majority of PF4-positive cells in transgenic mice, but not in nontransgenic mice, appeared as small and immature (not shown). It should be pointed out, however, that cells expressing low levels of PF4, as typical of early megakaryocytes (Vinci et al., 47Vinci G. Tabilio A. Deschamps J.F. Van Haeke D. Henri A. Guichard J. Tetteroo P. Lansdorp P.M. Hercend T. Vainchenker W. Breton-Goriun J. Br. J. Haematol. 1984; 56: 589-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), could have been missed by the immunohistochemistry method used. These results indicated that PF4-driven expression of Myc induced proliferation of cells which did not reach the differentiation stage at which acetylcholine esterase is expressed. The phenotype in homozygous offspring of founder 6 was similar to that observed in heterozygote mice. All of the bone marrow analyses data are from transgenic offspring of founder 6; however, similar data also were obtained with founder 20, e.g. female transgenic mice derived from founder 20 and aged matched nontransgenic female mice had an average of 81 ± 9 (n = 3) and 30 ± 4 (n = 5) megakaryocytes per sternum compartment, respectively (p < 0.005).Table IIThe percentage of cells expressing acetylcholine esterase and PF4 in bone marrow of transgenic miceMouseAcetylcholine esterase-positive cellsPF4-positive cells%Nontransgenic0.030.04Transgenic0.100.95 Open table in a new tab In order to test if the megakaryocyte accumulation observed in the transgenic mice was due to increased survival or production, we determined the frequency of megakaryocytes undergoing apoptosis. Using the TUNEL method (Surh and Sprent, 1994) to detect DNA fragmentation, the presence of apoptosis was confirmed in some megakaryocytes of female offspring of line 6. Examination of three slides of cytospun bone marrow cells derived either from nontransgenic or transgenic pregnant mice revealed that apoptosis of megakaryocytes was more frequent in the transgenic mice, i.e. 4/53 megakaryocytes in transgenic mice and 1/77 megakaryocytes in nontransgenic mice underwent apoptosis, in accordance with a previous report (Guy et al., 16Guy C.T. Zhou W. Kaufman S. Robinson M.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 685-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The 1.1-kb 5′-noncoding region of the PF4 gene, used in this study, is a tissue-specific promoter which directs expression of transgenes in early megakaryocytes of transgenic mice (Ravid et al., 38Ravid K.

Two acute transforming retroviruses, avian myeloblastosis virus and the E26 leukemia virus, transduced portions of c-myb and encode Myb proteins that are truncated in both the DBD and the NRD. Several conserved potential sites for phosphorylation by proline-directed serine/threonine protein kinases reside in or near the NRD, suggesting that phosphorylation might play a role in regulating c-Myb. We have previously demonstrated that serine 528, located in the NRD, is a target for p42mapk in vitro. Serine 528 is phosphorylated in vivo in several cell lines, and substitution of serine 528 to alanine (S528A) resulted in an increased ability of Myb to transactivate a synthetic promoter containing five copies of the mim-1A Myb-responsive element and a minimal herpes tk promoter. We have tested the ability of S528A Myb to transactivate a series of cellular target promoters and report that the serine to alanine substitution increased the ability of Myb to activate transcription from the CD34 promoter but not the c-myc or mim-1 promoters. This suggests that phosphorylation of serine 528 may differentially regulate c-Myb activity at different promoters. The DNA binding and multimerization activities of c-Myb appear to be unaffected by the S528A substitution, suggesting that phosphorylation of serine 528 may mediate its effect on the transcription transactivating activity of c-Myb by regulating interactions with other proteins.

The DNA binding and multimerization activities of c-Myb appear to be unaffected by the S528A substitution, suggesting that phosphorylation of serine 528 may mediate its effect on the transcription transactivating activity of c-Myb by regulating interactions with other proteins. The c-myb proto-oncogene encodes a nuclear DNA binding protein that functions as both a transcriptional activator and repressor (1Graf T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 249-255Google Scholar, 2Nakagoshi H. Nagase T. Ueno Y. Ishii S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 7315-7324Google Scholar). Expression of c-myb is detected primarily in hematopoietic tissue although c-myb mRNA has been reported in primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (3Thompson C.B. Challoner P.B. Neiman P.E. Groudine M. Nature. 1986; 319: 374-380Google Scholar), smooth muscle cells (4Brown K.E. Kindy M.S. Sonenshein G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 4625-4630Google Scholar), and several non-hematopoietic human tumors including neuroblastoma (5Thiele C.J. Cohen P.S. Israel M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1677-1683Google Scholar), colon carcinoma (6Alitalo K. Winqvist R. Lin C.C. de la Chapelle A. Schwab M. Bishop J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4534-4538Google Scholar), small cell lung carcinoma (7Griffin C.A. Baylin S.B. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 272-275Google Scholar), and breast carcinoma (8Guerin M. Sheng Z.M. Andrieu N. Riou G. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 131-135Google Scholar). The down-regulation of c-myb expression is associated with hematopoietic maturation, and in each hematopoietic lineage examined the expression of c-myb mRNA and protein is highest in immature normal tissue and tumor cell lines (1Graf T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 249-255Google Scholar). This pattern of expression led to the hypothesis that the c-myb gene product would play a role in regulating hematopoiesis, and this has been supported experimentally in several systems. First, c-myb antisense oligodeoxynucleotides inhibit both erythroid and myeloid colony formation in vitro (9Gewirtz A.M. Calabretta B. Science. 1988; 242: 1303-1306Google Scholar). Second, murine erythroleukemia cells and leukemic myeloid cells stably transfected with either constitutively expressed or inducible c-myb expression vectors were blocked in their ability to terminally differentiate in response to chemical inducing agents in vitro (10McClinton D. Stafford J. Brents L. Bender T.P. Kuehl W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 705-710Google Scholar, 11Clarke M.F. Kukowska-Latallo J.F. Westin E. Smith M. Prochownik E.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 884-892Google Scholar). Third, transgenic mice lacking a functional c-myb gene developed normally to day 14 and after that they died with severely disrupted patterns of erythroid and myeloid development (12Mucenski M.L. McLain K. Kier A.B. Swerdlow S.H. Schreiner C.M. Miller T.A. Pietryga D.W. Scott Jr., W.J. Potter S.S. Cell. 1991; 65: 677-689Google Scholar). Finally, Badiani et al. (13Badiani P. Corbella P. Kioussis D. Marvel J. Weston K. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 770-783Google Scholar) demonstrated that transgenic mice carrying a dominant interfering c-myb allele under the control of a CD2 promoter had disrupted patterns of T-lymphogenesis. The murine c-Myb protein is a 636-amino acid peptide of approximately 75 kDa (1Graf T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 249-255Google Scholar). Chicken c-myb was identified as the cellular homologue of two viral myb genes carried by the avian myeloblastosis virus (AMV) 1The abbreviations used are: AMVavian myeloblastosis virusDBDDNA binding domainMREMyb-responsive elementNRDnegative regulatory domainNF-Mnuclear factor-myeloidEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assaybpbase pairGSTglutathione S-transferasemAb.monoclonal antibodyPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisPBSphosphate-buffered saline. and the E26 virus (14Shen-Ong G.L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1032: 39-52Google Scholar, 15Lüscher B. Eisenman R.N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2235-2241Google Scholar). These viruses independently transduced portions of the c-myb gene, deleting both amino- and carboxyl-terminal coding sequences. Three major functional domains have been defined on the c-Myb protein: 1) a DNA binding domain, 2) an acidic transactivation domain, and 3) a negative regulatory domain. The DNA binding domain (DBD) is located near the amino-terminal end of the protein and is a highly conserved region consisting of three imperfect repeats (R1-3) of 50-52 amino acids each. The DNA binding domain defines a family of Myb-related proteins that have been identified in humans, mice, chickens, Drosophila, yeast, slime molds, and plants (1Graf T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1992; 2: 249-255Google Scholar). Biedenkapp et al. (16Biedenkapp H. Borgmeyer U. Sippel A.E. Klempnauer K.H. Nature. 1988; 335: 835-837Google Scholar) demonstrated that Myb bound DNA specifically to the consensus sequence PyAAC(G/T)G. This led to the finding that Myb could transactivate transcription when this element, referred to as the Myb-responsive element (MRE), was ligated to various test promoters (17Weston K. Bishop J.M. Cell. 1989; 58: 85-93Google Scholar, 18Ibanez C.E. Lipsick J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2285-2293Google Scholar). Although the DBD provides the only sequences required for DNA binding, it does not appear to activate transcription by itself. Deletion analysis and linker scanning of both c- and AMV v-Myb led to the identification of an approximately 50-amino acid acidic region, carboxyl-terminal to the DBD, that is required for transactivation by Myb (17Weston K. Bishop J.M. Cell. 1989; 58: 85-93Google Scholar, 18Ibanez C.E. Lipsick J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2285-2293Google Scholar, 19Sakura H. Kanei Ishii C. Nagase T. Nakagoshi H. Gonda T.J. Ishii S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5758-5762Google Scholar). The third major functional region is the broadly defined negative regulatory domain (NRD). Deletion of this region results in up to a 10-fold increase in Myb-induced transcription activation when assayed by transient co-transfection with several test promoters (18Ibanez C.E. Lipsick J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2285-2293Google Scholar, 19Sakura H. Kanei Ishii C. Nagase T. Nakagoshi H. Gonda T.J. Ishii S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5758-5762Google Scholar, 20Kalkbrenner F. Guehmann S. Moelling K. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 657-661Google Scholar). This region contains a leucine zipper-like motif (16Biedenkapp H. Borgmeyer U. Sippel A.E. Klempnauer K.H. Nature. 1988; 335: 835-837Google Scholar), and point mutations of key residues in this motif increase both the transcription activating and transforming activity of murine Myb (21Kanei-Ishii C. MacMillan E.A. Nomura T. Sarai A. Ramsay R.G. Aimoto S. Ishii S. Gonda T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3088-3092Google Scholar). Thus, it is of particular interest that potential protein-protein interactions have been identified in blotting studies using a peptide containing this motif to probe HeLa cell extracts (21Kanei-Ishii C. MacMillan E.A. Nomura T. Sarai A. Ramsay R.G. Aimoto S. Ishii S. Gonda T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3088-3092Google Scholar). Several other features of the NRD are also consistent with it playing a role in regulating c-Myb activity. First, it is a site of proviral integration as well as modification by alternative splicing (15Lüscher B. Eisenman R.N. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 2235-2241Google Scholar). Second, disruption of the carboxyl-terminal portion of AMV v-Myb (which retains a portion of the NRD) by linker insertion results in an increase in the transactivating activity of AMV v-Myb (22Lane T. Ibanez C. Garcia A. Graf T. Lipsick J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2591-2598Google Scholar). Third, both amino- and carboxyl-terminal deletions have been reported to independently activate the transforming potential of c-Myb. Finally, cells transformed by differentially truncated forms of c-Myb differ phenotypically (23Grasser F.A. Graf T. Lipsick J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 3987-3996Google Scholar, 24Press R.D. Reddy E.P. Ewert D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2278-2290Google Scholar). This finding suggests that changes in the structure of c-Myb may be important in determining cell lineage and stage of development in hematopoietic cells presumably by altering the array of genes regulated by c-Myb. avian myeloblastosis virus DNA binding domain Myb-responsive element negative regulatory domain nuclear factor-myeloid electrophoretic mobility shift assay base pair glutathione S-transferase monoclonal antibody polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphate-buffered saline. The sequence-specific DNA binding by Myb proteins led to the demonstration that both c- and v-myb encoded transcription factors (17Weston K. Bishop J.M. Cell. 1989; 58: 85-93Google Scholar, 18Ibanez C.E. Lipsick J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2285-2293Google Scholar), and a number of candidate target promoters have been identified, including mim-1 (25Ness S.A. Marknell A. Graf T. Cell. 1989; 59: 1115-1125Google Scholar), c-myc (26Evans J.L. Moore T.L. Kuehl W.M. Bender T. Ting J.P.-Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5747-5752Google Scholar), CD34 (27Melotti P. Ku D.H. Calabretta B. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1023-1028Google Scholar), CD4 (28Frampton J. Gibson T.J. Ness S.A. Doderlein G. Graf T. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 891-901Google Scholar), T cell receptor-δ (29Hernandez-Munain C. Krangel M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 473-483Google Scholar), and a murine thymic locus control region (30Ess K.C. Whitaker T.A. Cost G.J. Witte D.P. Hutton J.J. Aronow B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5707-5715Google Scholar). Each of these promoters requires the DBD for transactivation by Myb and contains at least one Myb binding site. The sequence of these Myb binding sites is surprisingly variable, and Myb proteins bind these sites with varying affinity (31Ramsay R.G. Ishii S. Gonda T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5656-5662Google Scholar). In the case of the mim-1 promoter there are three MRE's that bind Myb with different affinities in vitro (25Ness S.A. Marknell A. Graf T. Cell. 1989; 59: 1115-1125Google Scholar, 31Ramsay R.G. Ishii S. Gonda T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5656-5662Google Scholar). Mutation of the highest affinity site (mim-1A) abrogates activation by Myb proteins while mutation of the lower affinity sites has less of an effect. In some cases, c-Myb has been demonstrated to activate transcription in cooperation with Ets-2, core binding factor and NF-M (25Ness S.A. Marknell A. Graf T. Cell. 1989; 59: 1115-1125Google Scholar, 29Hernandez-Munain C. Krangel M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 473-483Google Scholar, 32Burk O. Mink S. Ringwald M. Klempnauer K.H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2027-2038Google Scholar, 33Dudek H. Tantravahi R.V. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S. Reddy E.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1291-1295Google Scholar). In contrast, the DBD is not required for the activation of transcription from the human hsp 70 promoter or the avian MD1 promoter, and it has been suggested that c-Myb may bind and inactivate a negative acting transcription factor (34Klempnauer K.H. Arnold H. Biedenkapp H. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1582-1589Google Scholar, 35Burk O. Klempnauer K.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3713-3719Google Scholar). Thus, c-Myb may regulate gene expression via at least two distinct mechanisms. However, little is known about how c-Myb activates transcription or the mechanisms that regulate c-Myb activity. Both v- and c-Myb are phosphorylated on serine and threonine at multiple sites in vivo (36Luscher B. Christenson E. Litchfield D.W. Krebs E.G. Eisenman R.N. Nature. 1990; 344: 517-522Google Scholar, 37Luscher B. Eisenman R.N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 775-784Google Scholar, 38Aziz N. Miglarese M.R. Hendrickson R.C. Shabanowitz J. Sturgill T.W. Hunt D.F. Bender T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6429-6433Google Scholar, 39Bading H. Beutler C. Moelling K. Oncogene. 1989; 4: 33-38Google Scholar). Lüscher et al. (36Luscher B. Christenson E. Litchfield D.W. Krebs E.G. Eisenman R.N. Nature. 1990; 344: 517-522Google Scholar) demonstrated that serines 11 and 12 are phosphorylated in vivo and are targets for phosphorylation in vitro by casein kinase II. Phosphorylation of serines 11 and 12 results in decreased sequence-specific DNA binding in vitro, and substitution of these sites by alanine results in decreased cooperativity with NF-M (40Oelgeschlager M. Krieg J. Luscher-Firzlaff J.M. Luscher B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5966-5974Google Scholar). In addition, c-Myb becomes hyperphosphorylated at several unidentified sites during mitosis, and mitotic c-Myb binds DNA less efficiently than interphase c-Myb (41Lüscher B. Eisenman R.N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 775-784Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated that murine c-Myb is phosphorylated on serine 528 (which lies within the NRD) in vivo and that it is a target for phosphorylation by p42mapk in vitro. Substitution of serine 528 by alanine results in 3-7-fold increase in the ability of c-Myb to activate transcription from an artificial promoter/reporter construct consisting of five copies of the mim-1A MRE and a minimal herpesvirus tk promoter (38Aziz N. Miglarese M.R. Hendrickson R.C. Shabanowitz J. Sturgill T.W. Hunt D.F. Bender T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6429-6433Google Scholar, 42Aziz N. Wu J. Dubendorff J.W. Lipsick J.S. Sturgill T.W. Bender T.P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2259-2265Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that substitution of serine 528 by alanine modulates the transcription activating properties of c-Myb on some target promoters, but not others, suggesting the phosphorylation of serine 528 provides a mechanism to differentially regulate c-Myb activity. Interestingly, this substitution does not affect the ability of c-Myb to bind DNA or to form multimerized complexes. We suggest that phosphorylation of serine 528 may serve to regulate the interaction between c-Myb and other proteins that modulate c-Myb activity. The African green monkey kidney cell lines, CV-1 and CMT3COS, were obtained from Dr. David Rekosh (University of Virginia) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and 2 mM glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified incubator at 37°C in 10% CO2. The CMT3COS cell line is a derivative of CV-1 and is transformed by SV40 large T antigen driven by the mouse metallothionein I promoter (43Gerard R.D. Gluzman Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3231-3240Google Scholar). The murine c-myb expression vector pRMb3SV.wt (44Cuddihy A.E. Brents L.E. Aziz N. Bender T.P. Kuehl W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3505-3513Google Scholar) contains the entire murine c-myb coding sequence driven by the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat and sequences for polyadenylation from SV40. The empty control vector pR3SV that lacks c-myb coding sequences was generated by NcoI digestion, which removes the c-myb coding sequences, and religation. Oligodeoxynucleotide mutagenesis was used to create alanine (pRMb3SV.S528A) and aspartate (pRMb3SV.9) substitution mutations at serine 528 of murine c-Myb. Briefly, the 2-kilobase pair NcoI fragment, containing the murine c-myb coding sequences, was isolated from pRMb3SV.wt (44Cuddihy A.E. Brents L.E. Aziz N. Bender T.P. Kuehl W.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3505-3513Google Scholar, 45Bender T.P. Kuehl W.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3204-3208Google Scholar) and subcloned into pALTER (Promega). Oligodeoxynucleotide-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the Altered Sites II System (Promega) per the manufacturer's instructions. Mutant cDNAs were then subcloned into pR3SV via their NcoI sites, creating pRMb3SV.S528A and pRMb3SV.9. Insert orientation was confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion, and the presence of appropriate mutations was confirmed by double-stranded dideoxynucleotide chain termination DNA sequencing using a Sequenase version 2.0 kit per the manufacturer's instructions (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The SV40 origin of replication was introduced into pR3SV, pRMb3SV.wt, pRMB3SV.S528A, and pRMb3SV.9 for autonomous replication in the SV40 large T antigen-transformed CMT3COS cell line. Briefly, pSV4Ori, which carries a 376-bp EcoRI/HindIII fragment containing the SV40 origin of replication ligated into pUC18, was obtained from Dr. David Rekosh (University of Virginia). pSV4Ori was digested with EcoRI and HindIII and made blunt-ended by filling using Klenow fragment, and the 376-bp fragment was isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis. pR3SV, pRMb3SV.wt, pRMb3SV.S528A, and pRMb3SV.9 were linearized with BamHI, made blunt-ended by filling using Klenow fragment, treated with calf intestinal phosphatase, and ligated with the 376-bp fragment to yield pR3SVori, pRMb3SVori.wt, pRMb3SVori.S528A, and pRMb3SVori.9. In pRMb3SV-based plasmids, the unique BamHI site lies immediately 3′ to the polyadenylation sequences. To generate pOriGST.FLwt and pOriGST.FLS528A, pR3SVori was linearized by digestion with HindIII and BglII and treated with calf intestinal phosphatase. Polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify sequences encoding GST-fusion proteins from pG2T.wt, pG2T.S528A, pGEX-2T, and pGEX2TK.E1A12S. The pG2T.wt and pG2T.S528A plasmids encode GST fused amino-terminally to full-length wild type or S528A murine c-Myb, respectively (42Aziz N. Wu J. Dubendorff J.W. Lipsick J.S. Sturgill T.W. Bender T.P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2259-2265Google Scholar). pGEX2TK.E1A12S was obtained from Dr. Daniel Engel (University of Virginia) and encodes GST fused amino-terminally to the full-length adenovirus Type 2 E1A 12S coding sequence. Forward (forgex2: 5′-GACAAGCTTGCCATG:TCCCCTATACTAGGTTATTGG-3′) and reverse (revgex: 5′-CAGAGATCTTCAGTCAGTCACGATGAATTCC-3′) oligodeoxynucleotide primers for polymerase chain reaction amplification were commercially synthesized (Oligos Etc.). Forgex2 includes sequences beginning at the translation initiation codon of GST (nucleotide position 270 in pGEX-2T, underlined above) and ending within the GST coding region at nucleotide position 294. Forgex2 also contains a HindIII site near the 5′-end and a minimal Kozak sequence (46Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Google Scholar) (corresponding to nucleotides -3 through -1 in murine c-myb) immediately 5′ to the GST translation initiation codon. Revgex contains sequences corresponding to nucleotides 961 through 939 in the polylinker of pGEX-2T plus a BglII site at the 5′-end. Each 100-µl reaction included 500 ng each of forgex2 and revgex primers, 20 ng of DNA template, 200 µM dNTPs, 10 µl of 10 × reaction buffer (100 mM KCl, 100 mM (NH4)SO4, 200 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.8 at 25°C), 20 mM MgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100) and 0.5 µl (1 unit) Deep Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). Additional MgSO4 was added to bring the final concentration to 6 mM. Amplification was carried out in a Perkin-Elmer DNA thermocycler under the following conditions: 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 50°C for 2 min, and 72°C for 4 min, followed by one extension cycle at 72°C for 15 min and a 4°C soak cycle. Polymerase chain reaction products were extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol, and digested with HindIII and BglII. The digested DNA products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated into the pR3SVori vector. The presence of appropriate mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing as described above. The pOri.GSTFLwt and pOri.GSTFLS528A plasmids consist of pR3SVori with the GST wild type c-myb or the GST-S528A c-myb fusion insert, respectively. pOri.GST contains only the GST coding sequences, and pOri.GSTE1A12S contains the GST-E1A12S fusion gene insert. The pCD34[-3.7k/+302]d.luc plasmid was obtained from Dr. Brian Davis (Medical Research Institute of San Francisco, CA) and contains the human CD34 promoter (nucleotides -3700 through +302) cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase reporter gene (47He X.E.

To construct pMycBg.luc, a 1.7-kilobase pair BglII fragment from the murine c-myc promoter containing both the P1 and P2 c-myc promoters was prepared from pLSBgCAT (a gift from Dr. Jenny Ting, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill) and ligated into the BglII site of pGL2-BASIC (Promega). The pdE.luc plasmid was obtained from Dr. Scott Ness (Northwestern University, Evanston, IL) and contains a 242-bp chicken mim-1 promoter fragment cloned upstream of firefly luciferase (25Ness S.A. Marknell A. Graf T. Cell. 1989; 59: 1115-1125Google Scholar). Diagrams of the Myb-responsive promoters are shown in Fig. 1. Transient transfections into CV-1 and CMT3COS cells were performed using the CaPO4 precipitation method (48Van den Elsen P. Houweling A. Van Eb A. Virology. 1983; 128: 377-390Google Scholar) as described previously (38Aziz N. Miglarese M.R. Hendrickson R.C. Shabanowitz J. Sturgill T.W. Hunt D.F. Bender T.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6429-6433Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated at 1 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish 16-20 h prior to transfection. Cells were incubated overnight with the CaPO4-DNA precipitate in a 37°C humidified incubator containing 10% CO2, washed twice with PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 4.3 mM Na2HPO4·H2O, 1.4 mM KH2PO4), and further incubated in growth media described above until harvest at 48 h post-transfection. All cotransfection assays included 1 µg of individual reporter plasmid and the indicated amounts of c-Myb expression plasmids per dish. The total amount of DNA per transfection was made equal by the addition of an appropriate amount of the empty pR3SV expression vector. Transfections for luciferase assays were performed in triplicate. Cell lysates were prepared and luciferase assays performed using the luciferase assay kit (Promega) per the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were washed once with PBS and incubated in 400 µl of 1 × Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega) for 15 min at 27°C. Cells were harvested by scraping with a rubber policeman, transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, and frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath. The lysates were thawed and clarified by centrifugation in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at the maximum setting for 30 s. The supernatants were transferred to fresh microcentrifuge tubes and stored at -80°C. Lysates were thawed and kept on ice throughout the assay. Twenty microliters of lysate was added to a microcentrifuge tube containing 100 µl of luciferase assay reagent (Promega), and the mixture was agitated gently by hand for 5 s. Luciferase activity was assayed in a LKB RackBeta scintillation counter. Events registering on either photomultiplier tube (open channels) over a 15-s period were recorded. Data are reported as the mean counts over background plus or minus the standard error. Background was defined for each assay as the counts generated in 15 s by Luciferase Assay Reagent without the addition of cell lysate. CMT3COS cells were transfected with 4 µg of pRMb3SVori.wt, pRMb3SVori.S528A, pRMb3SVori.9, or pR3SVori as described above. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were washed once with PBS and 300 µl lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM NaF, 5 µM ZnCl2, 100 µM sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 5 units/ml α2-macroglobulin (Boehringer Mannheim), 2.5 µg/ml pepstatin (Sigma), 2.5 µg/ml leupeptin (Sigma), 0.15 mM benzamidine (Sigma), 2.8 µg/ml aprotinin (Sigma)) was added to each dish. Cells were harvested by scraping and transferred into microcentrifuge tubes, vortexed for 30 s, and centrifuged at the maximum setting for 30 min at 4°C. Supernatants were moved to clean microcentrifuge tubes and stored at -80°C. EMSA was carried out using CMT3COS cell extracts as described by Oelgeschlager et al. (40Oelgeschlager M. Krieg J. Luscher-Firzlaff J.M. Luscher B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5966-5974Google Scholar). One hundred nanograms of a double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide, containing a single MRE based on the mim-1A MRE (upper strand, 5′-TCGATCGACACATTATAACGGTTTTTTAGC-3′), was radiolabeled with 100 µCi of [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Corp., 3000 Ci/mmol) using Klenow fragment to a specific activity of 1.9 × 108 cpm/µg. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed from the reactions using NenSorb columns per the manufacturer's instructions (DuPont NEN). The mim-1A MRE oligodeoxynucleotide was commercially synthesized with four base overhangs (Oligo's Etc). EMSA reactions contained 1 µl of transfected CMT3COS cell lysate, 2 µl of 10 × buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% nonfat dry milk, 50% glycerol, 0.1% saturated bromphenol blue), 2 µl of 100 mM dithiothreitol (Boehringer Mannheim), 1 µl of 1 µg/µl poly(dI-dC) (Sigma), 13 µl of H2O, 1 µl (approximately 0.1 ng or 10,000 cpm) of 32P-labeled probe and were incubated at 27°C for 45 min. For competition assays, cell extracts were preincubated with unlabeled competitor oligodeoxynucleotide for 30 min at 27°C at which time labeled probe was added to the reaction for an additional 15 min. A double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotide containing a cyclic AMP response element, provided by Dr. Daniel Engel (University of Virginia), was used as a nonspecific competitor (upper strand, 5′-GTCCCCCGTGACGTCACCCGGGAG-3′). For supershifts, cell extract was preincubated with 20 µg of anti-Myb Type I monoclonal antibody (UBI) for 30 min at 4°C. Reactions were loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel and run at 40 V/cm in prechilled (4°C) 0.25 × TBE buffer (12.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 12.5 mM boric acid, 0.25 mM EDTA). The gel was dried onto Whatman 3 M filter paper and exposed to XAR-5 film (Kodak) at 27°C for 4-16 h. Detection of Myb-Myb interactions was performed essentially as described (49Kim K.M. Alber G. Weiser P. Reth M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 911-916Google Scholar) with several modifications. CMT3COS cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells per 100-mm dish 20 h prior to transfection by the CaPO4 method (48Van den Elsen P. Houweling A. Van Eb A. Virology. 1983; 128: 377-390Google Scholar). For each dish, 15 µg of either pOri.GSTFLwt, pOriGSTFLS528A, pOri.GSTE1A12S, or pOriGST was cotransfected with 1 µg of either pRMb3SVori.wt or pRMb3SVori.S528A. At 48 h post-transfection, the cells were harvested by gentle scraping in PBS and transferred to a 50-ml conical tube (Sarstedt). Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at 4°C, resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold PBS, and transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. Cells were then pelleted by brief microcentrifugation, resuspended in 300 µl of HNNE+ (10 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 0.01 unit/ml α2-"

This study demonstrates that the free radical nitric oxide (NO) is also a regulator of IL-1 bioactivity.

IL-1 activity was determined by thymocyte proliferation bioassay and by a new spectrophotometric bioassay based on IL-1-specific induction of NOS and NO production by an insulinoma cell line, RINm5F. Neither NO nor NOS inhibitors present in the macrophage supernatant interfere with the bioassays.

https://openalex.org/W2070758793,"The c-Abl tyrosine kinase has been shown previously to bind DNA. Using polymerase chain reaction-based binding site-selection methods, no consensus high affinity binding site for c-Abl was found. Instead, oligonucleotides with runs of A/T sequences were isolated, and purified c-Abl was shown to bind A/T-containing oligonucleotides better than those without A/T sequences. DNA binding of c-Abl was dependent on three high mobility group 1-like boxes (HLBs), which bound cooperatively to the A/T-rich oligonucleotides. To distinguish binding to A/T sequences per se from binding to nonspecific DNA with a bend at the A/T-rich region, two oligonucleotides were compared for binding to c-Abl. Both oligonucleotides contained A/T sequences. In one, the A/T motif was part of an 80-mer duplex DNA. In another, the A/T motif was in the duplex arm of an 80-mer “bubble DNA” containing an internal unpaired 20-mer region to provide a flexible hinge. Interestingly, the HLBs of c-Abl bound better to the oligonucleotide containing the bubble, suggesting a higher affinity for bent DNA rather than A/T sequences per se. Taken together, these observations define a new class of DNA binding domains, the HLBs, which do not bind DNA with a high degree of sequence specificity, but may selectively bind to bent DNA or to sequences that are easier to distort.

Taken together, these observations define a new class of DNA binding domains, the HLBs, which do not bind DNA with a high degree of sequence specificity, but may selectively bind to bent DNA or to sequences that are easier to distort. Protein-tyrosine kinases comprise a large family of enzymes with more than 100 members found in higher eukaryotes. The majority of protein-tyrosine kinases are localized at the plasma membranes, where they are involved in the transduction of extracellular signals (1van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Google Scholar). However, not all of the protein-tyrosine kinases are localized at the cell periphery (2Wang J.Y.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 373-376Google Scholar). The tyrosine kinase encoded by the c-abl proto-oncogene is found in the nucleus of cultured fibroblasts (2Wang J.Y.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 373-376Google Scholar, 3Wang J.Y.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 35-43Google Scholar). The tyrosine kinase activity of the nuclear c-Abl is regulated in the cell cycle through an interaction with the retinoblastoma protein, RB (4Welch P.J. Wang J.Y.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 779-790Google Scholar, 5Welch P.J. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 5542-5551Google Scholar). In resting or early G1 cells, the unphosphorylated RB binds to the tyrosine kinase domain of c-Abl and inhibits the enzyme activity. With the activation of the G1 cyclin-dependent kinases and the phosphorylation of RB, c-Abl is released and activated (4Welch P.J. Wang J.Y.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 779-790Google Scholar, 5Welch P.J. Wang J.Y.J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 5542-5551Google Scholar). Thus, c-Abl tyrosine kinase is a downstream target of regulation by the cyclin-dependent kinases at G1/S transition. An unique function found with c-Abl but not other tyrosine kinases is the ability of c-Abl to bind DNA. The DNA binding function of c-Abl is also regulated in the cell cycle. Previously, the DNA binding function of c-Abl was mapped to a 99-amino acid domain in the C-terminal region of the protein (6Kipreos E.T. Wang J.Y.J. Science. 1992; 256: 382-385Google Scholar). As cells enter mitosis, this region of c-Abl becomes hyperphosphorylated on Ser/Thr residues (7Kipreos E.T. Wang J.Y.J. Science. 1990; 248: 217-220Google Scholar). This hyperphosphorylation is correlated with the inactivation of DNA binding (6Kipreos E.T. Wang J.Y.J. Science. 1992; 256: 382-385Google Scholar). Several other DNA-binding proteins, such as Myc and Myb, have also been shown to become hyperphosphorylated and inactivated during mitosis (8Luscher B. Eisenman R.N. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 775-784Google Scholar). Taken together, the cell cycle-dependent regulation of c-Abl tyrosine kinase and DNA binding functions suggest that this nuclear tyrosine kinase may play a role in cell cycle progression. The C-terminal repeated domain (CTD) 1The abbreviations used are: CTDC-terminal repeated domainHMGhigh mobility groupHLBHMG-like boxCTD-IDCTD-interacting domainEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayPCRpolymerase chain reactionGSTglutathione S-transferase. of RNA polymerase II has been identified as a nuclear substrate of c-Abl. Our laboratory has shown that the large subunit of RNA polymerase II is tyrosine-phosphorylated in vivo, and that c-Abl can phosphorylate the CTD to a high stoichiometry in vitro (9Baskaran R. Dahmus M.E. Wang J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11167-11171Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the CTD requires not only the tyrosine kinase activity of c-Abl, but also two other CTD-interacting domains (CTD-IDs) found in c-Abl. Mutation of the CTD-IDs in c-Abl can abolish its CTD kinase activity, but does not affect its autokinase activity or its ability to phosphorylate enolase, a nonspecific substrate (10Duyster J. Baskaran R. Wang J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1555-1559Google Scholar, 11Baskaran R. Chiang G.G. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 3361-3369Google Scholar). One CTD-ID is the Abl Src homology 2 domain, which binds to the tyrosine-phosphorylated CTD (10Duyster J. Baskaran R. Wang J.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1555-1559Google Scholar). Another CTD-ID is found at the C terminus of c-Abl, and this domain binds to the unphosphorylated CTD (11Baskaran R. Chiang G.G. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 3361-3369Google Scholar). The CTD-IDs are also required for c-Abl to phosphorylate the CTD in vivo and to form a complex with RNA polymerase II (11Baskaran R. Chiang G.G. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 3361-3369Google Scholar). These findings suggest that c-Abl is likely to be a physiologically relevant CTD kinase, and it may participate in the regulation of transcription during cell cycle progression. C-terminal repeated domain high mobility group HMG-like box CTD-interacting domain electrophoretic mobility shift assay polymerase chain reaction glutathione S-transferase. To understand the role of c-Abl in transcription regulation, it is necessary to know whether the DNA binding domain of c-Abl can select specific DNA sequences. A previous report has suggested that c-Abl can bind to a palindromic sequence, EP, found in the hepatitis B enhancer (12Dikstein R. Heffetz D. Ben-Neriah Y. Shaul Y. Cell. 1992; 69: 751-757Google Scholar). Experiments described in that report were consistent with the presence of c-Abl in the EP-binding complex. However, those results did not demonstrate a direct interaction between c-Abl and the palindromic sequence of EP. Using a PCR-based method to select and amplify oligonucleotide sequences, we found that c-Abl did not select the palindromic enhancer sequence of EP. Instead, oligonucleotides with a high A/T content were obtained. The structural basis for the binding of c-Abl to A/T-rich sequences is the presence of three sets of amino acid sequences that are distantly related to the high mobility group 1 (HMG1) domain found in a large number of DNA-binding proteins (13Landsman D. Bustin M. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 539-546Google Scholar, 14Grosschedl R. Giese K. Pagel J. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 94-100Google Scholar). The three HMG-like domains (HLBs) were shown to bind DNA cooperatively and were likely to bind better to bent DNA. NIH3T3 cells and 3T3 Abl knockout (Abl-/-) cells (a gift from Dr. D. Baltimore, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA) were cultured at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. Sf9 cells were cultured at 27°C in Grace's insect media (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 0.3% yeastolate (Difco), 0.3% lactalbumin hydrolysate (Difco), and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HyClone). Nuclear and whole cell extracts from NIH3T3 cells (Abl+/+) and 3T3 Abl knockout cells (Abl-/-) were prepared as described previously (15Lassar A.B. Davis R.L. Wright W.E. Kadesch T. Murre C. Voronova A. Baltimore D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1991; 66: 305-315Google Scholar). 3T3 Abl knockout cells (Abl-/-) were co-transfected with pBKCMV-Abl-Tag and a pRSV-based vector containing the hygromycin resistance gene at a ratio of 5:1 using the calcium phosphate method. After 24 h of transfection, cells were split 1:20 and were incubated for another 24 h. Stable transfectants were selected for 14 days in media containing 0.1% G418 sulfate. Individual colonies were isolated and checked for expression of c-Abl-Tag by Western blot using 8E9, a c-Abl-specific antibody. Two stable clones (clones 9 and 10) expressing c-Abl were isolated. Nuclear extracts from each clone were made and used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Cyclic amplification and selection of targets (CASTing) was performed as described previously (16Wright W.E. Binder M. Funk W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4104-4110Google Scholar). Briefly, an 81-base pair oligonucleotide containing a random stretch of 35 nucleotides (5′-CTCGGTACCTCGAGTGAAGCTTGA(N)35GGGAATTCGGATCCGCGGTAAC-3′), a 5′-end PCR primer (5′-CTCGGTACCTCGAGTGAAGCTTGA-3′), and a 3′-end PCR primer (5′-GTTACCGCGGATCCGAATTCCC-3′) were synthesized. Five micrograms of the oligonucleotide was converted to double-stranded DNA by extension of excess 3′ PCR primer for 30 min at 72°C with Taq DNA polymerase. Ten micrograms of this double-stranded DNA was mixed with 4 µl of nuclear extract (see below) in 20 µl of binding buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 100 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µg/ml aproteinin, 10 µg/ml leupeptin, 10 µg/ml pepstatin, 10 µg/ml phenanthroline, 1 mM NaF, 1 mM Na3Vo4, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 20% glycerol). Following a 20-min incubation at room temperature, 10 µl of anti-c-Abl (8E9) antibody-coated magnetic beads was added. The mixture was agitated at room temperature on a rotator for 1 h. The magnetic beads were retrieved from solution with a magnet and were washed three times with binding buffer plus 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and then once with a 50-µl wash with PCR buffer. The beads were resuspended in a 100-µl PCR mixture containing 1 × PCR buffer, 150 nM each of the two PCR primers, 2 mM Mg2+, and 125 µM dNTP. After heating the PCR mixture at 95°C for 5 min, Taq DNA polymerase (2 units) was added. PCR was performed for 10-20 cycles (94°C, 1 min; 65°C, 1 min; 72°C, 1 min), after which the primer concentration was increased to 450 nM with a finishing cycle of 94°C, 3 min; 72°C, 10 min. The PCR reaction was monitored by gel electrophoresis so that overamplification of the DNA was avoided. A 10-µl sample of the above PCR product was mixed with 10 µg of salmon sperm DNA and subjected to a new round of CASTing. After 10 rounds of CASTing, the selected DNA was digested with XhoI and EcoRI and subcloned into pBKSK+ (Stratagene). Thirty-one clones selected with Abl+/+ nuclear extract, and 19 clones selected with Abl-/- nuclear extract were sequenced. The plasmids expressing glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins of c-Abl DNA binding domain fragments, GXS (Xho-Sal), GUS (Stu-Sal), and GXU (Xho-Stu) were constructed as described previously (6Kipreos E.T. Wang J.Y.J. Science. 1992; 256: 382-385Google Scholar). GST/NarI-SalI (GNS) was constructed by digesting pBK/c-abl type IV with NarI, filling in with Klenow, and digesting again with SalI. The resulting NarI-SalI fragment was isolated from a gel and ligated to the pGEX-KG vector, which was previously cut with XbaI, filled in with Klenow, and cut with SalI. GST fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified as described (17Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus containing murine His-tagged c-Abl type IV (a gift from Dr. M. Dahmus, University of California, Davis) as described previously (9Baskaran R.

After 72 h of infection, cells from six 15-cm plates were collected and spun down at 1000 rpm (Sorvall RT6000) for 5 min. All the subsequent procedures were carried out at 4°C. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and were lysed directly in nuclear extraction buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.6, 500 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 1 mM DTT, 20% glycerol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 µM benzamidine chloride, 10 µg/ml each of aproteinin, leupeptin, and phenanthroline) at 4 × 107 cells/ml. Lysed cells were gently rocked for 1 h and were then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm (Sorvall SS-34 rotor) for 10 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a 2-ml Ni2+ column (Probond™, Invitrogen) equilibrated in buffer A (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 500 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT). After washing the column with washing buffer B (20 mM HEPES, pH 6.3, 500 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT), elution was carried out with buffer B containing 300 mM imidazole. The eluate was dialyzed against buffer C (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.05% Nonidet P-40), and was applied to a heparin-Sepharose (Pharmacia) column. This column was eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient of 0.05-1 M KCl in buffer C. c-Abl fractions at 400 mM KCl were pooled and concentrated by using a Centricon 10 unit (Amicon). In some preparations, Ni2+ column fractions containing c-Abl were subsequently fractionated on native-DNA cellulose and c-Abl was detected in fractions eluted with 400 mM KCl. 18/26, 5′-CCGATGGATCCTATAAATGAGATTTTTTGAGGTAGATGTGTGTGGAGATCTAC-3′; EP, 5′-AGACGGATCCATTGCAGATCCGTTGCTCGGCAACGGCCTACTGTAGGAATTCGGA-3′; clone 18, 5′-TCCACACACATCTACCTCAAAAAATCTCATTTATA-3′; clone 30, 5′-TTTTGTATCGTGATATATATTCCCCACAAGGAAAAT-3′; clone 10, 5′-ACAACTGTCTACCTCCAAGCTCAAGCTTCACTCGA-3′. In the experiment where binding to single-stranded, duplexed, and bubble DNA was compared, we synthesized three oligonucleotides. The same 80-mer top, 5′-GCCACGGCCGATGGATCCTATAAATGAGATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTATGTCCTAGCAAAGCGTATGTGATCACTGG-3′, was used. This oligonucleotide contained 8 random nucleotides at the 5′-end followed by the first 22 nucleotides of 18/26. The 6 T nucleotides of 18/26 were extended to 20 T nucleotides, followed by 30 random nucleotides. The duplex oligonucleotide is made with a complementary bottom strand. The 80-mer bubble was made by hybridizing the 80-mer top with the bubble bottom strand 5′-CCAGTGATCACATACGCTTTGCTAGGACATCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCATCTCATTTATAGGATCCATCGGCCGTGGC-3′ to generate a 20-mer unpaired T/C region with two 30-base pair arms. Duplex oligonucleotides were made by mixing equal amounts (100 ng/µl) of complementary single-stranded DNA in 1 × SSC buffer, denaturing at 80°C for 2 min, and cooling slowly to room temperature. The renatured double-stranded DNA was further purified by acrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by electroelution. Radiolabeled duplex oligonucleotides were made by first phosphorylating with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase, then annealing, and finally purifying on an acrylamide gel. The 80-mer duplex and bubble DNA were each made by hybridizing an equal amount of 32P-labeled 80-mer top with 5 × molar excess of cold complementary bottom, or bubble bottom, respectively. For single-stranded probe, the labeled 80-mer top strand was mixed with 5 × molar excess of the unlabeled strand. Thus, the specific radioactivity of the three probes (single-stranded, double-stranded, and bubble) was identical in the binding assay. The gel shift reaction mixture (20 µl) contained 2 ng of 5′-labeled clone 18/26 or clone 18, 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, 0.1% Triton, 3% glycerol, and 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The reactions were initiated by adding purified c-Abl or GST-fusion proteins to the concentrations indicated in the figure legends, then incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The samples were then loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide (55:1 acrylamide/bisacrylamide) gel that had been prerun for 15 min. The gel was run in 0.5 × TBE (100 mM Tris base, 100 mM boric acid, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.3) at 4°C at 300 V for 3 h. Antibodies were preincubated with c-Abl for 15 min at room temperature prior to adding to the mixture. For EMSA done with whole cell extracts, 2 µg of extract was used in each reaction in the presence of 1 µg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA. The gel was subsequently dried and subjected to autoradiography. The data for the DNA binding curve were quantitated using the Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. To determine if c-Abl can select specific sequences, we used the CASTing method (16Wright W.E. Binder M. Funk W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4104-4110Google Scholar). Nuclear extract prepared from NIH3T3 cells was incubated with an excess amount of oligonucleotides, each containing a 35-nucleotide core of random sequences flanked by two PCR primers (see “Materials and Methods”). Those oligonucleotides complexed with c-Abl were selected by absorption onto magnetic beads coated with the anti-Abl monoclonal antibody 8E9. After washing, the bound oligonucleotides were released, amplified by PCR, and then subjected to another round of selection. After 10 rounds, the PCR products were cloned and sequenced. No consensus sequence was found among the selected oligonucleotides. However, 24 out of 31 clones sequenced (77%) contained runs of A/T sequences that were between 5 and 9 nucleotides in length (Fig. 1A). Moreover, most clones contained more than one run of A/T. These clustered runs of A/T are boxed in the sequence and are referred to as the “A/T-rich motif” (Fig. 1A). To determine if the selection of the A/T-rich motif was dependent on c-Abl, a control CASTing experiment using nuclear extracts from Abl-null 3T3 cells was performed. The 8E9-coated magnetic beads brought down the c-Abl protein from the 3T3 extracts (Fig. 1C, lower panel, lane 1) but did not bring down any detectable Abl protein from the Abl-null 3T3 extracts (lane 2) when an equal amount of total protein was used (Fig. 1C, upper panel). Seventeen clones were sequenced from CASTing selection performed with the Abl-null 3T3 extracts. Among them, six (clones 3, 8, 9, 13, 14, and 15) contained A/T runs of 5 and 6 nucleotides in length (Fig. 1B). Only one clone (clone 2) contained the type of A/T-rich motif found among the c-Abl-selected clones. Thus, the selection of A/T-rich motifs was more efficient when the c-Abl protein was present in the nuclear extracts. To further examine the protein-DNA complexes formed with the A/T-rich motif, an oligonucleotide was synthesized based on the sequence of two selected clones, 18 and 26 (Fig. 1A). These two clones differed by only 1 nucleotide and contained a 34-nucleotide identical sequence oriented in opposite directions relative to the PCR primer arms. Whole cell extracts from NIH3T3 cells, Abl-null 3T3 cells, and NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with a pBK-based Abl-TAG expression plasmid were made and used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). Many protein-DNA complexes were formed with the 18/26 probe (Fig. 2). The A-complex, migrating at the top of the lane, could be competed away with the inclusion of unlabeled 18/26 probe (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 2 and 3 or lanes 6 and 7). The amount of this complex could be correlated with the amount of c-Abl. A decreased amount of this complex was found in the Abl-null nuclear extract (lane 4), whereas an increased amount of the complex was observed in the transfected cell extract (lane 6). To further document the correlation between the specific gel shift complex and the amount of c-Abl, a pBK-based vector expressing c-Abl was introduced into the Abl-null cells. Two stably transfected clones expressing c-Abl were isolated. Again, the amount of this gel shift complex also correlated with the level of expression of c-Abl (Fig. 2B). In a mock-reconstituted clone (Fig. 2B, lane 3), the A-complex was present at a low level. In two Abl-reconstituted clones (lanes 4 and 5), the intensity of this protein-DNA complex was found to parallel the level of c-Abl in the extracts (Fig. 2C, lanes 4 and 5). These observations suggested that c-Abl might be present in the A-complex. Two antibodies, the 8E9 antibody that reacts with the Abl-Src homology 2 domain and the 12CA5 antibody that reacts with the HA-TAG, were tested for their ability to supershift the A-complex. However, they did not have any effect on the A-complex. These negative results could be due to shielding of the c-Abl in the A-complex. Alternatively, c-Abl might not be present in the A-complex, and the observed correlation could be due to some indirect effect of c-Abl on the formation of the A-complex. To determine if c-Abl indeed prefers A/T-rich motifs, we used purified c-Abl protein in DNA binding reactions. The murine c-Abl type IV protein was tagged at the N terminus with 6 histidines (His6-tag) and overproduced in insect Sf9 cells using the recombinant baculovirus expression system. The His6-tagged c-Abl was purified in a two-step process, beginning with a Ni2+ column followed by a heparin-Sepharose column (see “Materials and Methods”). Approximately 100-fold increase in specific activity was achieved. When analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, c-Abl represented greater than 90% of the protein in the purified fraction (Fig. 3B, lane 3). The purified c-Abl bound to the 18/26 probe and formed a stable complex that was detectable by EMSA (Fig. 3A, lane 2). The 8E9 antibody did not react with the 18/26 probe (lane 4), but it was able to supershift this complex (lane 3). As a control, an antibody against Cdc2 had no effect on this protein-DNA complex (lane 5). These results showed that c-Abl protein was present in the protein-DNA complex. Binding preference of c-Abl to an A/T-rich motif was tested by competition. Three unlabeled oligonucleotides were used: 1) 18, which contained the identical sequence as the labeled probe, 2) 30, which contained an A/T-rich motif, and 3) 10, which contained no A/T-rich motif (Fig. 1A). Each oligonucleotide competed for binding to c-Abl, but with different efficiencies (lanes 6-30). The binding data were quantitated using PhosphorImager (Fig. 3C). When compared to the competition with oligonucleotide 18, oligonucleotide 30 was about 8-fold less efficient. However, oligonucleotide 10, which lacked the A/T-rich motif, required more than 60-fold the amount to achieve the same degree of competition. These observations supported the interpretation of the CASTing results and suggested that c-Abl preferentially bound to A/T-rich DNA. Previously, the DNA binding domain of c-Abl was determined to be the 99-amino acid region between the StuI and SalI sites of the murine c-abl sequence (6Kipreos E.T. Wang J.Y.J. Science. 1992; 256: 382-385Google Scholar). Several searches of the protein sequence data bases were conducted, but no apparent similarity with any of the known DNA binding domains was detected. After finding that c-Abl bound better to A/T-rich DNA, we repeated the search by focusing on DNA binding domains that are known to select A/T-rich sequences, i.e. the HMG domains. Such a focused search revealed that the 99-amino acid region and two other regions of c-Abl were distantly related to the HMG box (Fig. 4A). These were designated as HMG-like boxes (HLBs) 1-3. HLB-1 lies between the NarI and XhoI restriction sites of murine c-Abl, HLB-2 lies between XhoI and SalI, and HLB-3, between SalI and StuI, which corresponds to the previously assigned 99-amino acid DNA binding domain (6Kipreos E.T. Wang J.Y.J. Science. 1992; 256: 382-385Google Scholar). A multiple sequence alignment of several HMG box sequences is shown in Fig. 4A. These sequences were divided into three groups. The top group contains HMG boxes that are found in sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. The middle group consists of HMG boxes that do not exhibit clear sequence specificity. The bottom group contain the three c-Abl HLBs that are quite divergent from the HMG boxes. HLB-1, -2, and -3 of c-Abl share 34%, 30%, and 35% similarity to the human SRY sequence, respectively. To determine the roles that the three HLBs have in DNA binding, a series of GST fusion proteins containing different combinations of the HLBs (Fig. 5B) were tested for binding to the 18/26 probe (Fig. 5A). The fusion protein containing HLB3 could bind 18/26 by itself, which is consistent with the previous assignment of this region as the DNA binding domain of c-Abl (6Kipreos E.T. Wang J.Y.J. Science. 1992; 256: 382-385Google Scholar). The fusion protein containing HLB2 did not form a stable complex with 18/26. This was also consistent with the results of previous experiments in which DNA binding was measured by Southwestern blotting and binding to DNA cellulose (6Kipreos E.T. Wang J.Y.J. Science. 1992; 256: 382-385Google Scholar). Interestingly, the fusion protein containing both HLB 2 and 3 bound to DNA with an affinity higher than HLB3 alone. Addition of HLB1 in the fusion protein GNS caused an additional, albeit less dramatic, increase in the binding affinity. In fact, GNS bound the 18/26 probe as well as the full-length c-Abl protein (Fig. 5A). These results suggested that all three HLBs of c-Abl contributed to the binding of the A/T-rich sequence. An interesting feature of the HMG domain is its ability to induce DNA bending upon binding (14Grosschedl R. Giese K. Pagel J. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 94-100Google Scholar). The preference for A/T sequences by HMG domains is most likely due to the fact that A/T sequences are more flexible in adopting a bent conformation (14Grosschedl R. Giese K. Pagel J. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 94-100Google Scholar). Our observations that c-Abl preferred A/T-rich oligonucleotides and that c-Abl contained three HMG-like domains prompted us to test if c-Abl bound to A/T sequences per se or preferred A/T-rich sequences because they were easier to bend. Two 80-mer oligonucleotides were prepared based on the sequence of probe 18/26 (see “Materials and Methods”). Both oligonucleotides contained the A/T sequence of 18/26 in the left 30-mer region. The duplex oligonucleotide contained a central 20-mer of T-A homoduplex, whereas the bubble oligonucleotide contained a central 20-mer of unpaired T/C. The T-A duplex or the unpaired T/C are flanked by identical 30-mer right and left arms (Fig. 6B). Binding of the GNS protein (Fig. 5B) to these two oligonucleotides and to a single-stranded 80-mer containing only the T-strand was determined as a function of protein concentration (Fig. 6A). Consistent with previous results (6Kipreos E.T. Wang J.Y.J. Science. 1992; 256: 382-385Google Scholar), GNS bound duplex DNA better than single-stranded DNA. Interestingly, GNS was found to bind the bubble DNA better than the A/T-rich duplex. These results suggested that the HLBs of c-Abl did not bind to A/T sequences per se. The single-stranded region in the bubble DNA might function as a flexible hinge for bending, and thus allowing the HLBs to bind cooperatively to the two arms of a bent DNA. The DNA binding function of c-Abl is shown here to be mediated by three HMG-like boxes, which do not select DNA sequences with a high degree of specificity. The HLBs of c-Abl are quite divergent from the HMG domains and cannot be classified as a member of the HMG family (14Grosschedl R. Giese K. Pagel J. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 94-100Google Scholar). However, the preference for binding to A/T-rich oligonucleotides and to bubble DNA indicates that the HLBs may be functionally similar to the HMG box. The HMG box is a DNA binding domain of about 80 amino acids found in a number of proteins that bind to DNA with different degrees of sequence specificity. Those that bind DNA with little sequence specificity, including HMG-1, HMG-2, and UBF, tend to contain more than one HMG box. UBF, a transcription factor for RNA polymerase I, contains four HMG boxes (18Jantzen H.M. Admon A. Bell S.P. Tjian R. Nature. 1990; 344: 830-836Google Scholar). The cooperative binding of the three HLBs in c-Abl is similar to the cooperative binding of the four HMG boxes in UBF (19Jantzen H.M. Chow A.M. King D.S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1950-1963Google Scholar). HMG family members that can discriminate between DNA sequences include the T-cell transcription factors, TCF-1/LEF-1, and the testis determination factor, SRY (19Jantzen H.M. Chow A.M. King D.S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1950-1963Google Scholar, 20Travis A. Amsterdam A. Belanger C. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 880-894Google Scholar, 21van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. Dooijes D.

Smith M.J. Foster J.W. Frischauf A.M. Lovell-Badge R. Goodfellow P.N. Nature. 1990; 346: 240-244Google Scholar). Although these HMG proteins show preference for some specific sequences, their sequence recognition capabilities, as argued by Grosschedl, are quite modest (14Grosschedl R. Giese K. Pagel J. Trends Genet. 1994; 10: 94-100Google Scholar). Moreover, the consensus binding sequence of TCF-1/LEF-1, 5′-(A/T)(A/T)CAAAG-3′, and the preferred binding sequence for SRY, 5′-(A/T)AACAA(T/A)-3′, are A/T-rich (20Travis A. Amsterdam A. Belanger C. Grosschedl R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 880-894Google Scholar, 21van de Wetering M. Oosterwegel M. Dooijes D. Clevers H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 123-132Google Scholar, 22Waterman M.L. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A.

Selection of the A/T-rich sequence by the HMG box is likely due to the fact that binding by an HMG domain requires a large distortion in the DNA backbone. This has been shown by an NMR study of the SRY·DNA complex (26Werner M.H. Huth J.R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 705-714Google Scholar). The binding to bent DNA can explain the cooperative binding of the three HLBs in c-Abl. It will be of interest to determine the structure of the c-Abl HLBs and the way they bind DNA. Our results do not support the previous report that c-Abl binds to the palindromic sequence in the hepatitis B viral enhancer, EP (12Dikstein R. Heffetz D. Ben-Neriah Y. Shaul Y. Cell. 1992; 69: 751-757Google Scholar). We have performed selection not only with the CASTing method, but also with the SAAB method (27Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Google Scholar), which uses EMSA to select and amplify oligonucleotides bound to c-Abl. In no case did we observe the selection of the EP sequence. Proteins that bind DNA with low specificity are not necessarily randomly distributed on cellular DNA (28Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Google Scholar). In fact, HMG proteins have been shown to be recruited to specific promoter complexes, such as the NF-κB·DSP1 complex in the interferon-responsive element (28Tjian R. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 77: 5-8Google Scholar, 29Lehming N. Thanos D. Brickman J.M. Ma J. Maniatis T. Ptashne M. Nature. 1994; 371: 175-179Google Scholar). The c-Abl tyrosine kinase may well be present in the EP-enhancer complex. However, our results would suggest that the EP complex must also contain a DNA-binding protein that recognizes the EP sequence. Bending of DNA by HMG proteins can promote the binding of other nuclear proteins, such as the progesterone receptor, to the bent site (30Onate S.A. Prendergast P. Wagner J.P. Nissen M. Reeves R. Pettijohn D.E. Edwards D.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3376-3391Google Scholar). Perhaps c-Abl, through DNA bending, can promote the formation of the EP complex. The association of c-Abl with a specific transcription factor has been reported. Our laboratory has shown that RB can simultaneously bind to c-Abl and the transcription factor E2F. In fact, c-Abl and E2F can be co-immunoprecipitated from the nuclear extracts prepared from RB-positive cells (31Welch P.J. Wang J.Y.J. Genes & Dev. 1995; 9: 31-46Google Scholar). E2F is a family of transcription factors composed of E2F/DP heterodimers. The E2F-binding site is found in several cell cycle-regulated promoters, including cyclin A, cyclin E, and Cdc2 (32DeGregori J. Kowalik T. Nevins J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4215-4224Google Scholar). The assembly of an E2F·c-Abl complex through RB suggests that c-Abl may participate in the regulation of promoters that contain E2F sites. Recently, the v-Abl tyrosine kinase has been shown to form a complex with another transcription factor, CREB, that binds to the cyclic AMP-responsive element. In this instance, v-Abl is shown to enhance transcription from the cyclic AMP-responsive element (33Birchenall-Roberts M.C. Ruscetti F.W. Kasper J.J. Bertolette III, D.C. Yoo Y.D. Bang O.-S. Roberts M.S. Turley J.M. Ferris D.K. Kim S.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6088-6099Google Scholar). The c-Abl tyrosine kinase has been shown to modulate transcription in transient co-transfection assays. Welch and Wang showed that c-Abl can supertransactivate a 5xGal4-fos-CAT reporter in conjunction with GAL4-VP16 (4Welch P.J. Wang J.Y.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 779-790Google Scholar). This supertransactivation function requires both the tyrosine kinase activity and the DNA binding function. Deletion of the HLBs 2 and 3, as in the mutant c-Abl ΔXS, abolished the supertransactivation function of c-Abl (4Welch P.J. Wang J.Y.J. Cell. 1993; 75: 779-790Google Scholar). Recently, Baskaran et al. have extended this observation to show that c-Abl can also stimulate a fos-CAT reporter containing the basal fos promoter (11Baskaran R. Chiang G.G. Wang J.Y. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 3361-3369Google Scholar). Again, both the tyrosine kinase and the DNA binding function are required. Identification of the three HLBs and their binding to bent DNA form the basis for future studies on the mechanism by which c-Abl tyrosine kinase modulates transcription. We thank Dr. Jeff R.

Osteopontin gene expression is also stimulated by growth factors, such as transforming growth factor β and epidermal growth factor (17Noda M. Yoon K. Prince C.W. Butler W.T. Rodan G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13916-13921Google Scholar, 18Laverdure G.R. Banerjee D. Chackalaparampil I. Mukherjee B.B. FEBS Lett. 1987; 222: 261-265Google Scholar). Moreover, suppression of osteopontin expression by antisense RNA prevented malignant transformation, suggesting that osteopontin plays a critical role in tumorigenesis (19Su L. Mukherjee A.B. Mukherjee B.B. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2163-2169Google Scholar, 20Behrend E.I. Craig A.M. Wilson S.M. Denhardt D.T. Chambers A.F. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 832-837Google Scholar, 21Gardner H.A. Berse B. Senger D.R. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2321-2326Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that osteopontin expression is diminished in various tissues of c-src-deficient mice (22Chackalaparampil I. Peri A. Nemir M. Mckee M. Lin P.-H. Mukherjee B.B. Mukherjee A.B. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1457-1467Google Scholar), suggesting that osteopontin expression is stimulated by c-Src. Osteopontin is one of the genes highly expressed in osteoclasts (23Ikeda T. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Suda T. Yoshiki S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1992; 40: 1079-1088Google Scholar, 24Tezuka K. Sato T. Kamioka H. Nijweide P.J. Tanaka K. Matsuo T. Ohta M. Kurihara N. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 911-917Google Scholar), and c-src deficiency causes inactivation of osteoclasts and osteopetrosis (25Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Google Scholar, 26Boyce B.F. Yoneda T. Lowe C. Soriano P. Mundy G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1622-1627Google Scholar). Interestingly, epidermal growth factor and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate stimulation of osteopontin expression in c-src-deficient cells is similar to that in wild type cells, suggesting that c-Src stimulates osteopontin expression via a different pathway, which seems to be physiologically important (22Chackalaparampil I. Peri A. Nemir M. Mckee M. Lin P.-H. Mukherjee B.B. Mukherjee A.B. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1457-1467Google Scholar). In this report, we investigated the effect of v-Src on osteopontin promoter activity and tried to elucidate the mechanism of its stimulatory effects by identifying the transcription factor(s) involved. The HT1080 human fibrosarcoma cell line, which was used in the previous study to investigate v-Src stimulation of matrix metalloproteinase-9 promoter (7Sato H. Kita M. Seiki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23460-23468Google Scholar), was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (JRH Biochemicals, Lenexa, KS). NIH 3T3 cells transformed by v-src (27Kohl N.E. Mosser S.D. deSolms J. Giuliani E.A. Pompliano D.L. Graham S.L. Smith R.L. Scolnick E.M. Oliff A. Gibbs J.B. Science. 1993; 260: 1934-1937Google Scholar) and their parental NIH 3T3 cell line were kindly provided by Drs. N. E. Kohl and J. B. Gibbs (Merck Research Laboratories) and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Oligonucleotides were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Plasmid pEcoRIB containing RSV src region (28Czernilofsky A.P. Levinson A.D. Varmus H.E. Bishop J.M. Tischer E. Goodman H.M. Nature. 1980; 287: 198-203Google Scholar, 29Czernilofsky A.P. Levinson A.D. Varmus H.E. Bishop J.M. Tischer E. Goodman H. Nature. 1983; 301: 736-738Google Scholar) was obtained from ATCC. An EcoRI-HindIII fragment containing the v-src-coding region was excised from pEcoRIB and cloned into pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) under the control of cytomegalovirus promoter. Deletion mutants of osteopontin promoter were constructed, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a PstI fragment containing the -910 to +90 region of the mouse osteopontin gene as a template (30Craig A.M. Denhardt D.T. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 100: 163-171Google Scholar), and cloned upstream of the firefly luciferase gene of the pXP2 vector (31Norden S.K. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 454-458Google Scholar), generating op-910, op-79, op-72, op-65, op-55, and op-37 which contain the -910, -79, -72, -65, -55, and -37 to +79 region of the mouse osteopontin promoter, respectively. Mutations were introduced by PCR using primers containing mutations as shown in Fig. 1, and sequences were confirmed by sequencing using a Sequenase version 2.0 sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). A fragment containing -37 to +52 of herpes simplex virus (HSV) tk minimal promoter was prepared from pBLCAT2 vector (32Luckow B. Schütz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Google Scholar) by PCR and inserted between the BglII and HindIII sites of pGL2-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI), generating tk-LUC. Two double strand synthetic oligonucleotides corresponding to -72 to -56 and -72 to -38 of mouse osteopontin promoter were prepared and inserted upstream of HSV tk minimal promoter of tk-LUC plasmid in forward orientations, generating reporter plasmids as follows; REx3-tk and REx1-tk contain three and one copies of -72 to -38 fragments, respectively, upstream of tk minimal promoter. OP6/7-tk contains one copy of the -72 to -56 fragment upstream of the tk minimal promoter. Cells were transfected with calcium phosphate-DNA coprecipitation method as described previously (33Takeshita S. Tezuka K. Takahashi M. Honkawa H. Matsuo A. Matsuishi T. Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 71: 9-18Google Scholar). HT1080 cells were plated onto six-well multiwell dishes (Costar, Cambridge, MA) at a density of 3 × 105 cells/well. Eighteen hours later, cells were transfected with reporter plasmids (2 µg/well) together with the v-Src expression plasmid or pcDNA3 plasmid (2 µg/well). To control for transfection efficiency and nonspecific effects of v-Src coexpression, the promoter activity of each promoter-luciferase reporter construct with or without v-Src coexpression was calculated and expressed relative to tk-LUC promoter activity, transfected into parallel separate cells with or without v-Src coexpression in the same experiments. HT1080 cells were harvested and used for luciferase assays 48 h after transfection. For NIH 3T3 cells, medium was changed to serum-free DMEM 5 h post transfection, and a cell lysate was prepared 43 h later. Luciferase assays were performed as described previously (34Towler D.A. Bennett C.D. Rodan G.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 614-624Google Scholar). Preparation of nuclear extracts and gel shift assays were performed as described previously (34Towler D.A. Bennett C.D. Rodan G.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 614-624Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide competitors for AP-1, AP-2, CTF/NF-1, NF-κB, and Sp1 were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). An oligonucleotide competitor for C/EBP was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-CBF-A antibody (35Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8286-8292Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Drs. S. Maity and B. de Crombrugghe (University of Texas). For the antibody shift experiments, 0.5-1 µl of anti-CBF antibody or rabbit preimmune serum was incubated with the binding reaction mixture for 15 min before the probes were added. The reaction mixture was loaded onto a 4-20% gradient polyacrylamide precast gel (NOVEX, San Diego, CA). Methylation interference assay was performed as described previously (36Janssen K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Wiley-Interscience, New York1994Google Scholar). A double strand oligonucleotide corresponding to the -72 to –38 sequence of the osteopontin promoter was labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) and [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Corp.) at either end. Labeled oligonucleotides were partially methylated by dimethyl sulfate, incubated with nuclear extract of HT1080 cells, and subjected to gel mobility shift assays. Retarded and free probes were purified from the gel and treated with piperidine. The interrupted residues were visualized by gel electrophoresis on an 8% sequence gel. When v-src-transformed NIH 3T3 cells and parental NIH 3T3 cells became semiconfluent, medium was changed to serum-free DMEM, and cultured for additional 48 h. Total RNA was prepared as described previously (37Chomozynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Ten micrograms of total RNA was separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and blotted onto nylon membrane (Hybond-N, Amersham). The radioactive probe was prepared from mouse osteopontin cDNA and human β-actin gene (38Tezuka K. Takeshita S. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. Kikuno R. Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 246-251Google Scholar), and Northern blotting was performed as described previously (39Tezuka K. Tezuka Y. Maejima A. Sato T. Nemoto K. Kamioka H. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1106-1109Google Scholar). Cotransfection of op-910 and op-79 with a v-Src expression plasmid into HT1080 cells increased the expression of both constructs by approximately 5-6-fold (Fig. 2). Deletion up to -66 had no effect on the v-Src stimulation (Fig. 2). This suggests that the distal AP-1-like sequence in this fragment does not play a major role in v-Src stimulation. Removal of the -65 to -56 segment significantly decreased both v-Src stimulation and basal promoter activity. It should be noted that constructs op-55 and op-37 lost v-Src stimulation but still retained significant promoter activity as high as that of the tk-minimal promoter used as a control. Next, heterologous promoter constructs were made, in which the -72 to -56 or -72 to -38 fragment of the osteopontin promoter was inserted upstream of the HSV tk minimal promoter of tk-LUC. As shown in Fig. 3, the -72 to -38 fragment increased basal activity and conferred v-Src response to a tk minimal promoter, whereas the -72 to -56 fragment moderately increased basal activity but did not confer v-Src response. These observations suggested that the v-Src response element (v-SrcRE) is located between -65 and -38.Fig. 3Effect of v-Src coexpression on heterologous promoter constructs. Each heterologous promoter construct together with the v-Src expression plasmid (closed bars) or with the pcDNA3 plasmid (open bars) were cotransfected into HT1080 cells. A large arrow represents one osteopontin -72 to -38 segment. A small arrow represents one osteopontin -72 to -56 segment. Means and standard deviations of triplicate samples are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To characterize the nuclear factor(s) which bind to v-SrcRE, gel shift assays were performed using the double strand oligonucleotide corresponding to -72 to -38 of the mouse osteopontin promoter (Fig. 4). One major retarded band was observed, and its intensity was decreased by the addition of increasing amounts of cold oligonucleotide (Fig. 4, lanes 1-4). A 200-400-fold excess of cold oligonucleotide which contains the known consensus sequence for one of the following, AP-1, AP-2, Sp-1, NF-κB, CTF/NF-1, or C/EBP, did not compete with the binding of the -72 to -38 fragment (data not shown). To localize the protein binding site, a methylation interference assay was performed (Fig. 5). Methylation of residues -57, -54, -53, -50, or -49 interfered with protein binding to the -72 to -38 fragment. This result indicates that the -57 to -49 segment, which contains an inverted CCAAT box, is important for binding. This was further confirmed by the fact that a fragment corresponding to the -72 to -38 sequence in which the CCAAT box was mutated (-57 CCTGATTGG -49 to ACTGATTTT) did not compete with the wild type -72 to -38 fragment for protein binding (Fig. 4, lane 8).Fig. 5Methylation interference assay. A, either the sense or antisense strands of the mouse osteopontin -72 to -38 fragment were end-labeled and used for the methylation interference assay. F and B represent free and bound probes, respectively. Closed triangles and open triangles indicate strong and weak inhibition of binding, respectively. B, nucleotide sequence of the mouse osteopontin -72 to -38 fragment. The inverted CCAAT box is boxed. Closed and open arrowheads indicate the position of strong and weak inhibition of binding, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To confirm that the CCAAT box plays a role in v-Src stimulation of the osteopontin promoter, mutations were introduced into the op-72 and op-79 constructs, as shown in Fig. 1. Mutation of AP-1-like sequence of op-79 had no effect on v-Src stimulation (data not shown). That is consistent with the fact that op-65 which lacks the AP-1-like sequence still retained v-Src stimulation (Fig. 2). Mutation of the CCAAT-box of op-72 significantly diminished both basal promoter activity and v-Src stimulation, whereas mutation of the adjacent GC-rich sequence had little effect on v-Src stimulation (Fig. 6). We next searched for the possible type of CCAAT-binding factor involved. Oligonucleotides corresponding to consensus sequences for CTF/NF-1 or C/EBP did not compete with the -72 to -38 fragment for specific protein binding (data not shown). However, there is another class of CCAAT box-binding factors, called NF-Y or CBF, originally identified as factors binding to the major histocompatibilty complex class II and to the α2 chain of type I collagen promoters, respectively (40Dorn A. Bollekens J. Staub A. Benoist C. Mathis D. Cell. 1987; 50: 863-872Google Scholar, 41Hatamochi A. Golumbek P.T. Van Schaftingen E. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 5940-5947Google Scholar). Biochemical characterization of the protein complex binding to the two CCAAT boxes of RSV LTR suggested that it is identical or closely related to CBF or NF-Y (42Faber M. Sealy L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 22243-22254Google Scholar). A fragment corresponding to the -155 to -122 sequence of RSV LTR, containing the distal CCAAT box, partially competed with the -72 to -38 fragment of mouse osteopontin promoter in the gel shift assay (Fig. 4, lanes 5-7). A fragment corresponding to the -72 to -56 sequence of the osteopontin promoter did not compete by itself with the -72 to -38 fragment; however, the combination of the RSV CCAAT fragment and the osteopontin -72 to -56 fragment competed with the -72 to -38 fragment as effectively as the -72 to -38 fragment itself (data not shown). On the other hand, excess cold osteopontin fragment -72 to -38, as well as the RSV CCAAT fragment itself, displaced to the same extent binding activity to the RSV CCAAT fragment (Fig. 4, lanes 9-15). These results indicate that there are two factors binding to the osteopontin -72 to -38 fragment, and they migrate to similar positions in the gel shift assays. One seems to bind to the inverted CCAAT box, and the other to the -72 to -56 segment. The binding activity to the -72 to -56 fragment in HT1080 nuclear extract was also confirmed by gel shift assay (data not shown). Interestingly, in Fig. 5, methylation of residues -65, -63, -62, -60, or -59 increased the binding, suggesting that these residues may also affect the protein-DNA interaction. However, heterologous promoter analysis (Fig. 3) and mutation analysis (Fig. 6) strongly suggested that the inverted CCAAT box but not the -72 to -56 segment plays a critical role in v-Src stimulation of the osteopontin promoter. Therefore, we concentrated on the CCAAT box-binding factor. To further characterize this CCAAT box-binding factor, we used anti-CBF-A antibody which can supershift the CBF-complex in gel shift assays (35Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8286-8292Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, the anti-CBF antibody supershifted both the complex formed with the osteopontin -72 to -38 fragment and with the RSV CCAAT fragment. These findings suggest that the factor binding to the osteopontin -72 to -38 fragment is either the CBF, which binds to the CCAAT box of RSV LTR, or is closely related to it. Dutta et al. (43Dutta A. Stoeckle M.Y. Hanafusa H. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 243-254Google Scholar) reported that two CCAAT boxes in RSV LTR play an important role in serum-dependent transcription. They also found that v-Src stimulates binding activity to the CCAAT box by using a temperature-sensitive mutant of v-Src. Our findings suggest that a similar mechanism is involved in the stimulation of the osteopontin promoter by v-Src. This mechanism may play a role in the transformation of cells by RSV and the participation of osteopontin in this process. To examine if v-Src stimulation of the osteopontin promoter occurs in situ, we compared osteopontin mRNA levels in v-src-transformed NIH 3T3 and in parental cells. In v-src-transformed NIH 3T3, osteopontin mRNA levels were significantly higher than in the parental NIH 3T3 (Fig. 8). The relative promoter activity of op-72 to op-37 was also significantly higher in v-src-transformed cells than in the parental cells (Fig. 9). Moreover, the stimulation was not observed when the CCAAT box was mutated (Fig. 9). These results suggest that, upon transformation by v-src, osteopontin expression increases, and at least part of the stimulation is due to the increased promoter activity mediated by the v-SrcRE that we identified. In a gel shift assay, we could not see any difference in the protein-DNA complex formed with the -72 to -38 fragment using nuclear extract prepared from v-src transformed and wild type NIH 3T3 cells (data not shown), suggesting that the effect may not be due to the abundance of CBF.Fig. 9Relative promoter activity of op-72 and muCCAAT in v-src-transformed and wild type NIH 3T3 cells. Reporter plasmids, op-72, op-37, and muCCAAT, were transfected into either v-src-transformed (3c) or wild type NIH 3T3 (NIH) cells. After 5 h, medium was changed to serum-free medium, and cells were incubated for additional 43 h. Luciferase activity was measured and shown as promoter activity relative to op-37. Means and standard deviations of triplicate samples are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It has been reported that a dominant negative Ras mutant or a farnesyltransferase inhibitor, which interferes with Ras activity, blocked oncogenic action of v-Src, suggesting that at least part of v-Src action is mediated by Ras (27Kohl N.E. Mosser S.D. deSolms J. Giuliani E.A. Pompliano D.L. Graham S.L. Smith R.L. Scolnick E.M. Oliff A. Gibbs J.B. Science. 1993; 260: 1934-1937Google Scholar, 44Stacey D.W. Roudebush M. Day R. Mosser S.D. Gibbs J.B. Feig L.A. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2297-2304Google Scholar). Recently, a ras-activated enhancer was identified in the mouse osteopontin promoter, which interacts with an ETS-related transcription factor (45Guo X. Zhang Y.P. Mitchell D.A. Denhardt D.T. Chambers A.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 476-487Google Scholar). The response element, GGAGGCAGG, was located at -725 to -717, which is far upstream of the v-SrcRE identified here. However, that study also suggested that the -88 to +79 region contains regulatory elements which contribute to the increased expression in ras-transformed cells. Our findings are consistent with those results and suggest that several enhancer elements may contribute to the increased expression of osteopontin upon transformation. The protooncogene of v-src, c-src, plays an important role in cell signaling (46Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Google Scholar). Gene knockout of c-src resulted in osteopetrosis in mice (25Soriano P. Montgomery C. Geske R. Bradley A. Cell. 1991; 64: 693-702Google Scholar). In c-src-deficient mice, osteoclasts are inactivated and do not resorb bone (26Boyce B.F. Yoneda T. Lowe C. Soriano P. Mundy G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1622-1627Google Scholar). Recently, it was reported that osteopontin expression was diminished in c-src-deficient cells (22Chackalaparampil I. Peri A. Nemir M. Mckee M. Lin P.-H. Mukherjee B.B. Mukherjee A.B. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1457-1467Google Scholar). Our results complement these findings, although c-Src and v-Src may have different modes of action. Osteopontin is highly expressed in osteoblasts and osteoclasts in bone tissue (23Ikeda T. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Suda T. Yoshiki S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1992; 40: 1079-1088Google Scholar, 24Tezuka K. Sato T. Kamioka H. Nijweide P.J. Tanaka K. Matsuo T. Ohta M. Kurihara N. Hakeda Y. Kumegawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 911-917Google Scholar). The mechanism by which c-src deficiency causes osteoclast inactivation has not been elucidated. A reduction in osteopontin expression in osteoblasts and/or osteoclasts of c-src-deficient mice could play a role in osteoclast inactivation. Thus, stimulation of the osteopontin promoter by Src may have a function not only in tumor cells but also in the physiological function of normal tissues. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2064948261,"Hydrophobic sites on the surface of factor VIII, factor VIIIa, and their derived subunits were evaluated using the fluorescent, apolar probe, bisanilinonapthalsulfonic acid (bis-ANS). Two hydrophobic sites, with indicated affinities for the probe, were identified on factor VIII (Kd = 0.2 and 1.22 μ), the isolated heavy chain (HC; Kd = 0.21 and 1.44 μ), and light chain (LC; Kd = 0.04 and 0.22 μ). Comparison of these values and fluorescence emission maxima parameters suggested that the higher affinity site on each isolated subunit contributes to the divalent metal ion-dependent, intersubunit interaction while the two lower affinity sites are retained on the surface of the factor VIII heterodimer. A single bis-ANS site was identified on both the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer (Kd = 0.19 μ) and A2 subunit (Kd = 0.11 μ), whereas two sites, equivalent to the sites of factor VIII, were observed on factor VIIIa. These results suggested the absence of interactive hydrophobic sites between A2 subunit and dimer, a major conformational change around the hydrophobic site in A2 upon dissociation, and the lack of accessible hydrophobic regions on the B domain of HC. Ca2+ reduced the emission intensity of bis-ANS bound to the isolated LC, HC, and A1 subunit, but not the A2 subunit. Reconstitution of factor VIII activity from isolated HC and LC was inhibited by >90% in the presence of 20 μ bis-ANS, whereas this concentration of probe had no effect on the reconstitution of FVIIIa from the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer and A2 subunit. These results indicate that intersubunit hydrophobic interactions are important for the metal ion-dependent association between A1 and A3 domains, but are not required for the metal ion-independent interaction between A2 subunit and the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer in factor VIIIa.

Reconstitution of factor VIII activity from isolated HC and LC was inhibited by >90% in the presence of 20 μ bis-ANS, whereas this concentration of probe had no effect on the reconstitution of FVIIIa from the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer and A2 subunit. These results indicate that intersubunit hydrophobic interactions are important for the metal ion-dependent association between A1 and A3 domains, but are not required for the metal ion-independent interaction between A2 subunit and the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer in factor VIIIa.

Earlier results from our laboratory suggested that the reconstitution of factor VIII from isolated HC and LC was mediated by both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions (8Fay P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 262: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this report we identify and characterize the exposed hydrophobic sites on the surface of factor VIII, factor VIIIa, and isolated subunits using tryptophan fluorescence as well as extrinsic fluorescence from the apolar probe, bis-ANS. Results from this study indicate fewer exposed hydrophobic sites on factor VIII compared with isolated subunits, suggesting involvement of some of these sites in heterodimer formation. Additional analyses using factor VIIIa subunits permitted localization of these sites to factor VIII domains. Studies on the reconstitution of cofactor activity confirmed the importance of intersubunit hydrophobic interactions in the metal ion-dependent linkage within the factor VIII molecule. Recombinant factor VIII was generously provided by Debra Pittman of the Genetics Institute and by Dr. Jim Brown of the Bayer Corporation. Factor VIII subunits (15Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 13246-13250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared from recombinant factor VIII as described previously. Human α-thrombin was obtained from Enzyme Research Laboratories. The dipotassium salt of bis-ANS was obtained from Molecular Probes and used without further purification. The stock solutions of bis-ANS were prepared in buffer (20 m Tris, 0.1 NaCl at pH 7.0), filtered, and the concentration determined by absorbance at 385 nm using an extinction coefficient, ϵ385 = 16,790 cm−1−1. Factor VIII activity was determined using a one stage clotting assay with substrate plasma that had been chemically depleted of factor VIII activity (17Casillas G. Simonetti C. Pavlovsky A. Coagulation. 1971; 4: 107-111Google Scholar). Factor VIII was reconstituted from isolated HC and LC (100 n each) in a reaction containing 20 m Tris (pH 7.2), 0.2 NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20, and 20 m MnCl2. Factor VIIIa reconstitution assays were performed using purified A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer and the A2 subunit (20 n each) in 20 m Mes (pH 6.0), 0.01% Tween 20, and 0.1 NaCl. All reactions were run at room temperature. Other additions are as described in the figure legend. Protein concentrations were determined by the Coomassie Blue dye binding method of Bradford (1976) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Fluorescence measurements were performed using a SPEX Fluorolog 1681 spectrometer. The concentration of protein used for these studies was approximately 150 n. The excitation and emission slit widths were set to 1.5 and 6 mm, respectively. Samples with bis-ANS were excited at 385 nm, and emission spectra were recorded between 400 and 600 nm. The fluorescence intensities of the samples were corrected for the absorption of dye by the relation (18Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1983Crossref Google Scholar), Fcorr = Fobs antilog(ODex+ ODem/2), where ODex and ODem are the optical densities at excitation and emission wavelengths, respectively. All spectra were corrected with respect to the spectra of buffer background and dilution effects. Titration data of the bis-ANS-protein complex was analyzed by double-reciprocal plots (19Horowitz P.M. Criscimagna N.L. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 2587-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20Wang J.L. Edelman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1185-1191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or a least squares regression program (21Safer J. Roller R.P. Gajdusek D.C. Gibbs J.C.J.

Biochem. 1976; 65: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The maximum dye to protein ratio for the complex formation was approximately 15-30. For the energy transfer experiments, an excitation wavelength of 295 nm was used, since this reduces or eliminates the involvement of tyrosine fluorescence from the protein. Data from the quenching of tryptophan emission by bis-ANS were analyzed using a modified Stern-Volmer equation (23Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar). Resultant plots were used to calculate the Kd values of dye for the protein (24Prasad A.R. Luduena R.F. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 3536-3540Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The efficiency of energy transfer (EET) (25Stryer L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 819-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar), from tryptophan to bis-ANS, was calculated from the formula, EET = 1 − (Qt/Qo), where Qt and Qo are the relative fluorescence intensities of energy donor (tryptophan) in the presence and absence of energy acceptor (bis-ANS), respectively. CD spectra in the range of 200-250 nm at room temperature were recorded on a Jasco-720 spectropolarimeter. Samples were measured in a cylindrical fused quartz cell with the path length of 10 mm, using a 2-nm bandwidth, 4-nm slit width, 16-s response time, 5 nm/min scan speed, and 0.1-nm step size. The concentration of protein used for these studies was approximately 200 n in 20 m Tris (pH 7.0) and 0.1 NaCl. Observed ellipticities were converted to mean residue ellipticity and are expressed in degrees·cm2.dmol−1. The CD spectra of factor VIII is shown in Fig. 1. The negative band in the 210-220 nm region indicated the presence of a significant proportion of β-sheet content in the protein. The isolated HC and LC of factor VIII showed CD spectral properties similar to each other and to the parent factor VIII molecule (Fig. 1). That factor VIII and its subunits possess high β-sheet content is consistent with these molecules containing hydrophobic sites (26Semisotnov G.V. Rodionova N.A. Razgulyaev O.I. Uversky V.N.

No additional conformational changes were detected in the secondary structure of either LC or HC upon the addition of Ca2+ or Mn2+ (data not shown), suggesting that association of the subunits with divalent metal ions that allow for factor VIII reconstitution (7Nordfang O. Ezban M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1115-1118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Fay P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 262: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) do not affect the gross structure of these subunits. Exposed hydrophobic sites in factor VIII and its isolated subunits were probed with bis-ANS. In aqueous medium, this reagent shows an emission maximum at 533 nm (28Shi L. Palleros D.R. Fink A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7536-7546Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). When bis-ANS binds to a hydrophobic moiety, its fluorescence intensity increases severalfold and the emission maxima are blue-shifted, the extent of which depends on the environment of the binding site (29Stryer L. J. Mol. Biol. 1965; 13: 482-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1323) Google Scholar, 30Turner D.C. Brand L. Biochemistry. 1968; 7: 3381-3390Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). A large increase in the bis-ANS fluorescence and a shift in the emission maximum from 533 to 498 nm were observed upon addition of a saturating level bis-ANS to factor VIII (Fig. 2). No further shift in the emission maximum was observed at higher concentrations of dye. In the absence of protein, the fluorescence intensity of 10 μ bis-ANS in buffer was negligible compared with the fluorescence of dye in presence of protein (data not shown). Titration data yielded plots that were initially hyperbolic (up to approximately 0.4 μ), but showed a further inflection at higher dye concentrations (Fig. 3). The shape of the titration curve indicated that bis-ANS had more than one binding site on the factor VIII. The Kd values calculated from these data are shown in Table IFig. 3Titration of factor VIII at different concentrations of bis-ANS. Factor VIII was at 0.2 μ. The increase in bis-ANS fluorescence was monitored at a fixed emission wavelength of 498 nm. The excitation wavelength was 385 nm.

Open table in a new tab The isolated factor VIII subunits showed markedly different interactions with bis-ANS. In the presence of HC, low concentrations of bis-ANS (<0.4 μ) showed an emission maximum at 489 nm (data not shown) that shifted slightly to a maximum of 492 nm upon further addition of dye (Fig. 2), indicating more than one binding site. Analysis of data showed the presence of two binding sites on HC. LC also showed similar results. These results suggest that both HC and LC possess two bis-ANS binding sites with different emission properties. Kd values (Table I) indicate that sites in the HC are of similar affinity to the sites in factor VIII, whereas the LC contains a higher affinity site as well as a site equivalent to the high affinity site in factor VIII or HC. The observation of two surface-exposed hydrophobic sites on each of the factor VIII subunits, as well as on the factor VIII heterodimer, indicates that the site(s) present on one or both of the isolated subunits participate in the intersubunit interaction and become inaccessible to bis-ANS. Heterotrimeric factor VIIIa showed two bis-ANS sites (Table I) similar to the sites observed in factor VIII. This result indicated that the exposed hydrophobic sites were not localized to the B domain or the N-terminal region of the LC, since these regions are absent in the activated molecule. Factor VIIIa-derived A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer and A2 subunit each showed a single binding site for bis-ANS with an emission maximum at 498 nm (data not shown). The affinity of dye for the two sites were similar to each other (Table I) and equivalent to the high affinity site observed on factor VIII. Evaluation of the isolated A1 subunit also revealed a single bis-ANS site that exhibited a lower affinity and reduced emission maximum compared with the site in A1/A3-C1-C2. That factor VIIIa contains two ANS sites, whereas single sites were observed on the A2 subunit and A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer, suggested that association of these components in factor VIIIa does not result from a hydrophobic-mediated interaction. The affinities of bis-ANS for factor VIII and isolated HC and LC were also determined using fluorescence energy transfer. Energy transfer was detected from the overlap of the tryptophan fluorescence emission spectrum of factor VIII (or subunits) and excitation spectrum of bis-ANS. For these experiments, an excitation wavelength of 295 nm was used to avoid the interference from tyrosine fluorescence. Following addition of bis-ANS to factor VIII, there was a decrease in the tryptophan fluorescence emission at 339 nm concurrent with an increase in the bis-ANS fluorescence at 498 nm (Fig. 4A). The isoemissive point at 420 nm indicated that the binding sites of bis-ANS for factor VIII had the same emission spectra. We observed a slight deviation in the isoemissive point at 420 nm for the HC (Fig. 4B) and LC (data not shown). This result was consistent with the isolated subunits having binding sites for bis-ANS with different emission properties. Analysis of the tryptophan emission quenching data using a modified Stern-Volmer plot (23Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 114: 199-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar) was biphasic for factor VIII (Fig. 5) and HC and LC (data not shown), indicating the presence of two binding sites on the proteins. The Kd values obtained from this analysis were equivalent to those calculated from the simple titration data and are shown in Table I.Fig. 5Modified Stern-Volmer plot for the the quenching of factor VIII intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence emission by bound bis-ANS. Fluorescence intensity of tryptophan emission was measured at 339 nm, and the excitation wavelength was 295 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The efficiency of energy transfer from tryptophan to bound bis-ANS in factor VIII is shown in Table II. At saturating concentrations of bis-ANS, transfer efficiency reached a maximum of 40%. In factor VIIIa the transfer efficiency from tryptophan to bis-ANS was 45%. The similarity of these values was consistent with the above data, suggesting that the B domain did not participate in ANS binding. Energy transfer efficiency data observed for other subunits are also presented in Table II. In general, we observed that energy transfer appeared to be more efficient with the monomeric subunits (HC, LC, and A2) compared with dimeric/trimeric molecules (factor VIII, factor VIIIa, and A1/A3-C1-C2) and may reflect altered conformation in the hydrophobic sites when subunits are in the dissociated state.Table IIEfficiency of energy transfer from Trp to bound bis-ANS in factor VIII, factor VIIIa, and its isolated subunitsSubunitsEfficiency of energy transfer%FVIII40FVIIIa45A1/A3-C1-C239HC60LC48A137A250 Open table in a new tab In the presence of divalent metal ions, factor VIII can be reconstituted from isolated LC and HC (8Fay P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 262: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and this reconstitution was probed with bis-ANS. The probe inhibited the generation of clotting activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6). Less than 10% of maximal factor VIII activity was reconstituted in the presence of 20 μ bis-ANS; whereas this concentration of bis-ANS had no effect on the clotting activity of native factor VIII (data not shown). Thus, hydrophobic sites on the LC and/or HC appear important for the Me2+-dependent interaction between factor VIII subunits yielding functional cofactor, and these sites are effectively blocked by the probe. Contrary to the effect of bis-ANS on the reconstitution of factor VIII activity, relatively high concentrations of dye did not affect the reconstitution of factor VIIIa activity, consistent with the electrostatic nature of the association of A2 subunit with A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer (12Lollar P. Parker E.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12481-12486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13246-13250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The extrinsic fluorescence of HC (100 n) in the presence of an equimolar concentration of bis-ANS was evaluated for changes in fluorescence intensity following addition of Me2+ and LC (Fig. 7). Under these initial conditions, the probe should selectively occupy the high affinity site in HC. Addition of CaCl2 (20 m) to the HC-dye complex resulted in a decrease in the fluorescence intensity without change in the peak position (489 nm), consistent with displacement of the dye by the Ca2+. Subsequent addition of LC (100 n) resulted in a further decrease in the fluorescence intensity without change in the emission maxima of dye-protein complex, suggesting that association of LC with HC resulted in a further displacement of the probe. Similar results were observed when the order of factor VIII subunits was reversed (data not shown). Furthermore, Ca2+ reduced the extrinsic fluorescence of the A1-dye complex, whereas Ca2+ had no effect on that of the A2-dye complex (data not shown). Taken together with the studies on reconstitution of factor VIII activity, these results suggest competition between bis-ANS and Me2+ for the high affinity sites in the subunits and indicate the importance of hydrophobic residues for Me2+ binding and regeneration of factor VIII activity. Further support for the participation of hydrophobic residues in the intersubunit interaction was obtained following changes in intrinsic fluorescence during dissociation of factor VIII. Addition of EDTA (10 m) to factor VIII resulted in the decrease (∼20%) in the intrinsic fluorescence emission (recorded from 300 to 450 nm) of tryptophan residues in factor VIII with no detectable change in the wavelength of fluorescence emission maximum (Fig. 8). The excitation wavelength of 295 nm was used to avoid the energy transfer from tyrosines to tryptophans. This result suggested that metal ion chelation resulted in a change in the local environment of tryptophan residue(s), consistent with exposure of hydrophobic sites to the solvent. Furthermore, factor VIII, factor VIIIa, HC, and LC all showed emission maximum at 339 nm (data not shown), suggesting that most of the tryptophan residues are partially buried. Control experiments, performed in the same buffer, showed that EDTA did not quench the tryptophan fluorescence. In this study we examine the role of exposed hydrophobic regions on factor VIII, factor VIIIa, and their isolated subunits in protein conformation, intersubunit interactions, and activity regeneration. Differential affinities of the apolar fluorophore, bis-ANS, for the protein substrates and resultant emission properties of the bound probe permitted the identification and localization of surface-exposed hydrophobic sites. The identical binding and emission properties of factor VIII and factor VIIIa for bis-ANS suggested the absence of hydrophobic sites on the factor VIII B domain. This conclusion was supported by the similarity of energy transfer efficiencies (Trp to bis-ANS) observed for factor VIII and factor VIIIa. The B domain, which exhibits significant heterogeneity in size (3Vehar G.A. Keyt B. Eaton D. Rodriguez H. O'Brien D.P. Rotblat F. Oppermann H. Keck R. Wood W.I. Harkins R.N. Tuddenham E.G.D. Lawn R.M. Capon D.J. Nature. 1984; 312: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) and is dispensable for clotting activity (6Fay P.J. Anderson M.T. Chavin S.I. Marder V.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 871: 268-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 31Toole J.J. Pittman D.D. Orr E.C. Murtha P. Wasley L.C. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5939-5943Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), is characterized by electron microscopy as a rod-like tail structure extending up to 50 nm from a globular head, the latter comprised of the A and C domains (32Fowler W.E. Fay P.J. Arvan D.S. Marder V.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7648-7652Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus the two hydrophobic sites identified on the isolated HC are contained within the A domains. These sites possess different emission properties, suggesting differences in the environment around them. Similarly, LC also showed two hydrophobic sites having different emission properties. Therefore, reconstitution of factor VIII from LC plus HC likely results in loss of two sites to the intersubunit interaction and retention of the remaining two sites on the surface of the factor VIII heterodimer. Based upon the similarity of the low affinity bis-ANS site on factor VIII (1.22 μ) with that on the HC (1.4 μ) and the identical fluorescence emission maxima (498 nm) values of the high affinity site on factor VIII (0.20 μ) with the low affinity site on LC (0.22 μ), we propose that these two hydrophobic sites on the free subunits are retained on the surface of factor VIII. Thus, we predict that the high affinity site present on HC (0.21 μ) and on the LC (0.04 μ) participate in the intersubunit association and as such are localized to the A1 domain and A3 domain, respectively. Results obtained with the factor VIIIa-derived subunits were consistent with the above model. Interaction of the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer with bis-ANS revealed a single binding site with a Kd of 0.19 μ. We attribute this site to the LC-derived domains (A3-C1-C2), since its affinity and fluorescence properties are similar to that observed for the high affinity site on factor VIII (0.20 μ). Therefore, the site observed on the isolated A1 subunit (0.77 μ) likely contributes to the Me2+-dependent interaction with A3-C1-C2 and is thus inaccessible in the dimer. This observation is consistent with the Ca2+-dependent sensitivity of the bis-ANS site on A1 subunit. Thus the A2 domain, present in factor VIII but lacking in the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer, likely contributes the weak affinity bis-ANS site (1.22 μ) to factor VIII. Reconstitution of A1/A3-C1-C2 with A2 subunit to yield factor VIIIa resulted in the formation of two bis-ANS sites of equivalent affinities to those observed in the factor VIII molecule, confirming both the lack of hydrophobic sites on the B domain and the presence of a weak affinity site on the A2 subunit (domain). However, affinity of the fluorophore for the isolated A2 subunit was markedly (10-fold) greater (Kd = 0.11 μ) when compared with values for the A2 subunit in association with the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer (Kd = 1.10 μ) or when the A2 domain is contiguous with the A1 domain in the factor VIII HC (Kd = 1.22 μ). This result suggested an altered conformation around the hydrophobic site in A2 when free and/or that the site is partially buried and less accessible to the fluorophore when A2 is in complex. From the above model, both HC and LC contribute a single hydrophobic site in the formation of the factor VIII heterodimer. These sites may be involved in the binding of divalent metal ion based upon the observation that addition of Ca2+ to the complex of bis-ANS with HC or LC resulted in a decrease in fluorescence intensity. This result suggested that a fraction of the bound fluorophore was displaced by the metal ion. An alternative explanation, that the subunits were undergoing a metal ion-induced conformational change, which reduced the bis-ANS fluorescence, was not supported by our CD results or the observation that the fluorescence emission maxima remained unchanged. Furthermore, addition of either LC to HC-bis-ANS-Ca2+ complex or HC to LC-bis-ANS-Ca2+ complex resulted in a further decrease in the fluorescence intensity. Again, this result was consistent with displacement of fluorophore rather than alteration of conformation given the capacity of the apolar probe to block reconstitution of factor VIII. Taken together, these data support the role of hydrophobic interactions in the metal ion-dependent binding of HC and LC. Intrinsic fluorescence and energy transfer studies further supported the role of hydrophobic residues in the inter-factor VIII subunit interaction. Factor VIII has 22 tryptophan residues in HC and 14 in the LC (3Vehar G.A. Keyt B. Eaton D. Rodriguez H. O'Brien D.P. Rotblat F. Oppermann H. Keck R. Wood W.I. Harkins R.N. Tuddenham E.G.D. Lawn R.M. Capon D.J. Nature. 1984; 312: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar) that are randomly distributed in the subdomains of factor VIII. These residues show a fluorescence emission maximum at 339 nm, indicating that most of the tryptophans are partially buried (33Burstein E.A. Vedenkina N.S. Ivkova M.N. Photochem. Photobiol. 1973; 18: 263-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1060) Google Scholar). The observed decrease in the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence on chelation of divalent metal with EDTA was likely the result of a major perturbation of environment around the tryptophan resides in the protein following the dissociation of HC and LC. This conformational change was also suggested by the observed increase in the efficiency of energy transfer (Trp to bis-ANS) for monomeric factor VIII(a) subunits compared with di- and trimeric factor VIII(a) forms. A functional role for hydrophobic sites was confirmed following evaluation of the effects of bis-ANS on the reconstitution of factor VIII activity from isolated subunits. We observed that low concentrations of the probe resulted in marked inhibition of regeneration of factor VIII activity. In an earlier study (8Fay P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 262: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), we showed that optimal reconstitution of factor VIII required moderate ionic strength, suggesting that both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions were important for the reassociation of factor VIII subunits and regeneration of cofactor activity. We observed that bis-ANS had no effect on the activity of intact factor VIII, suggesting that the two exposed hydrophobic sites on the heterodimer either do not contribute to cofactor function or, if so, participate in high affinity interactions such that the probe is readily displaced by the competing macromolecule. The observation that bis-ANS had no effect on the reconstitution of factor VIIIa from the A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer and A2 subunit was consistent with this intersubunit interaction exclusively occurring by electrostatic forces (10Fay P.J.

Factor VIII A domains share approximately 40% sequence identity with the triplicated A domains of the circulating copper-binding protein, ceruloplasmin (3Vehar G.A. Keyt B. Eaton D. Rodriguez H.

Recent homology modeling studies (34Pan Y. DeFay T. Gitschier J. Cohen F.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 740-744Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) using several blue copper-binding proteins as a data base suggest the presence of a single type II copper-binding site in factor VIII. This putative site, formed from His99 and His161 of the A1 domain and His1957 of the A3 domain, is believed to function in the divalent metal ion linkage between the HC and LC of factor VIII. The sequences around these His residues are: PVSLH99AVGV, SYLSH161VDLV, and IHSIH1957FSGH (3Vehar G.A. Keyt B. Eaton D. Rodriguez H. O'Brien D.P. Rotblat F. Oppermann H. Keck R. Wood W.I. Harkins R.N. Tuddenham E.G.D. Lawn R.M. Capon D.J. Nature. 1984; 312: 337-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). Inspection of these sequences reveals a high concentration of apolar residues, consistent with the participation of intersubunit hydrophobic interactions at or near the site of metal ion bonding. Furthermore, two tryptophan residues, Trp106 and Trp1942, are located near His99 and His1957 in the linear sequence, respectively, and could serve as reporters for the metal ion-dependent changes in intrinsic fluorescence. In summary, we present a model for the exposed hydrophobic sites in factor VIII and its isolated subunits. Structural and functional results indicate a role for a subset of these sites in the metal ion-dependent, inter-factor VIII subunit interaction required for expression of cofactor activity.

Recently it has been found that calmodulin both activates and inhibits the RYR Ca2+ channel, depending upon the free [Ca2+]; at submicromolar Ca2+ calmodulin activates the channel, while at micromolar Ca2+ calmodulin inhibits channel activity (Tripathy et al., 27Tripathy A.

The immunoglobulin fraction was then dialyzed overnight against phosphate-buffered saline at 4°C. Triad vesicles (1 mg/ml) were incubated in the presence or in the absence of mAb419 (Ab/HSR ratio of 1) for 2 h at 37°C. 45Ca2+ loading was carried out for 30 min at room temperature in the presence of 2.5 mM CaCl2, 75 mM KCl, 25 mM MES, pH 7.0. Rapid kinetic 45Ca2+ release was measured by using a rapid filtration apparatus (Biologic, Claix, France) as described previously (Moutin and Dupont, 18Moutin M.J. Dupont Y. J. Biol.

For real time binding experiments a BIAcore biosensor system (Pharmacia Biotech. Inc.) was used. All experiments were performed at 25°C. Between injections the sensor chip was continuously washed with 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 3.4 mM EDTA, 0.005% BIAcore surfactant P20 (Pharmacia). The fusion protein 19E was directly coupled through its amino groups to the sensor surface activated by N-hydroxysuccinimide and N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide according to the manufacturer's instruction. The remaining N-hydroxysuccinimide groups were then inactivated with 1 mM ethanolamine. Fusion protein 19E was electroeluted from SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then labeled with digoxigenin-3-O-methylcarbonyl-ϵ-aminocaproic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide ester according to manufacturer's instructions. Overlays with digoxigenin-fusion protein 19E and -calmodulin were carried out as described by Menegazzi et al. (16Menegazzi P. Larini F. Treves S. Guerrini R. Quadroni M. Zorzato F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9078-9084Google Scholar). 45Ca2+ overlay was carried out as described by Maruyama et al. (15Maruyama K. Mikawa T. Ebashi S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1984; 95: 511-519Google Scholar). We raised monoclonal Abs (mAb419) against a fusion protein (number 19) encompassing residues 281-620 of the rabbit skeletal muscle RYR protomer. The monoclonal Ab 419 reacted strongly with the protein band corresponding to the RYR protomer and with its own Ag (Fig. 1A, lanes 1b and 2b, respectively). To map the RYR immunopositive peptide within fusion protein 19, we made a set of constructs and probed the respective fusion proteins with mAb419. Fig. 1B shows that the immunological reactivity of the monoclonal antibody was retained only by fusion proteins 19A and 19E. On the contrary the Ab did not recognize fusion proteins 19C and 19D, suggesting that the sequence surrounding the break point between 19C and 19D is crucial to confer the immunoreactivity to mAb419. Of interest, the break point, which abolishes immunological reactivity occurs in correspondence of Met335, i.e. few residues upstream Gly341. Triad vesicles were incubated with mAb419 and then passively loaded with 45Ca2+. Rapid 45Ca2+ release kinetics were monitored at pCa 8. As shown by Fig. 2A, in the presence of mAb419 the rate constant of Ca2+ release (k = 32.1 s-1) was increased with respect to control experiments (k = 0.12 s-1). Activation of the Ca2+ release rate (k = 4.2 s-1 versus k = 72.4 s-1) was also observed when the experiments were carried out at pCa 4.5 (Fig. 2B). To further confirm the effect of the mAb419 on the functional properties of RYR, we measured the equilibrium binding of [3H]ryanodine at different pCa. Fig. 2C shows that the Ca2+ dependence of [3H]ryanodine binding displays a bell-shaped curve both in the presence and in the absence of mAb419. However, the half-maximal [Ca2+] for stimulation of [3H]ryanodine binding was significantly lower in the presence of mAb419 (0.1 versus 1.2 µM). No significant change for inhibition of ryanodine binding by high [Ca2+] was observed, indicating the specificity of the effect of mAb419. The increase of Ca2+ sensitivity of both 45Ca2+ release and ryanodine binding rates in the presence of mAb419 could be due to a direct interaction with a domain involved in Ca2+ binding or to a modification of a Ca2+-dependent regulatory site, which is adjacent in the three-dimensional structure but may be distant in the linear sequence. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we examined whether the set of RYR fusion proteins we produced encompass Ca2+ binding sites. In agreement with previous results, 45Ca2+ overlay of fusion proteins 19, 19A-19E indicates that none of them contain Ca2+ dependent allosteric sites (not shown). Thus, the effect of the mAb on Ca2+ dependence of ryanodine binding could be due to the perturbation by the Ab of a regulatory sequence adjacent to the Ab's epitope in the three-dimensional structure. Such a regulatory domain could be localized in the RYR itself or on a protein associated with the RYR complex. To investigate potential molecular interactions of the immunopositive fusion protein 19E with protein components of the Ca2+ release machinery, we immobilized fusion protein 19E onto the dextran matrix coating the gold sensor chip, and its interaction with the purified RYR was monitored using the optical biosensor BIAcore (Pharmacia). Fig. 3A shows the sensorgram representing real time binding of mAb419 to the immobilized 19E RYR fusion protein; the signal increased and reached a plateau in few hundred seconds, indicating that the immobilization step did not modify the immunological properties of the fusion protein. In the next set of experiments, we analyzed the interaction of the purified RYR complex with the RYR fusion protein 19E. To prevent nonspecific binding of the purified RYR complex to the sensor chip we first injected 10 µl of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and then the purified RYR complex into the flow cell. Injection of bovine serum albumin produced no signal (not shown). The sensorgrams in Fig. 3B shows the real time interaction of the immobilized 19E RYR fusion protein with increasing concentrations of purified RYRs. As can be seen, the resonance unit response of the 19E-coupled sensor chip is dose-dependent and approaches saturation after injection of 4.15 µg of purified RYR complex. The interaction between the RYR and the immobilized fuion protein could be inhibited by preincubation of the RYR complex with free fusion protein 19E (Fig. 3C). These results clearly indicate that a specific binding between the purified RYR complex and fusion protein 19E takes place. To identify the domain(s) of the RYR involved in the interaction with fusion protein 19E, we performed overlays on Western blots of fusion proteins covering the entire sequence of the RYR protomer, using digoxigenin-labeled fusion protein 19E as the ligand (Fig. 4). Out of the ten fusion proteins tested, only two, fusion proteins 1 and 28, defined by residues 281-1172 and 2937-3225, respectively, displayed an interaction with digoxigenated 19E. Of the two fusion proteins capable of binding 19E, protein 28 was particularly interestingly, since it encompasses a sequence (residues 2937-3225) which has been reported previously to bind calmodulin even at low [Ca2+] (Menegazzi et al., 16Menegazzi P. Larini F. Treves S. Guerrini R. Quadroni M. Zorzato F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9078-9084Google Scholar; Buratti et al., 1Buratti R. Prestipino G. Menegazzi P. Treves S. Zorzato F. Biophys. Biochem. Res. Commun. 1995; 213: 1082-1090Google Scholar). Thus, we examined whether the binding domain of fusion protein 28 for fusion protein 19E overlaps with that of calmodulin. Fig. 5 shows that a RYR fusion protein 28 carrying a deletion at its COOH terminus did not bind either calmodulin or fusion protein 19E, suggesting that the binding of both calmodulin and RYR fusion protein 19E is specific and requires the COOH-terminal sequence defined by residues 3010-3225. Using a similar approach we found that the presence of the COOH-terminal portion of RYR fusion protein 1 (residues 799-1172, defined by protein 2) is essential to confer binding with fusion protein 19E. Fig. 4 also shows that in the terminal cisternae fraction of rabbit skeletal muscle, two proteins are able to bind digoxigenin-fusion protein 19E. As expected binding was observed in correspondence of a band having a molecular weight identical to that of the RYR protomer. In addition, a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 110 kDa also exhibited strong binding.Fig. 5Identification of the domain of fusion proteins 28 and 1 involved in the interaction with fusion protein 19E.

Interestingly, this apparent increase of the Ca2+ sensitivity of the RYR in the presence of mAb419 is similar to what has been observed previously with triad vesicles from MH-susceptible pigs (Mickelson et al., 17Mickelson J.R. Gallant E.M. Litterer L.A. Johnson K.M. Rempel W.E. Louis C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9310-9315Google Scholar). Nevertheless Ca2+ overlay experiments indicate that the fusion proteins 19 and 19A-19E do not display Ca2+ binding. Therefore the effect of mAb419 suggests that the sequence corresponding to fusion protein 19E interact with another region of the RYR directly involved in the regulation of the channel by Ca2+. Real time surface plasmon resonance (BIAcore technique) indicates that the fusion protein 19E is able to interact with the purified native RYR complex. As to the sequence(s) involved in the intramolecular interaction between the fusion protein 19E and the RYR complex two polypeptides were identified: the first is localized at the NH2-terminal portion of the RYR protomer and is defined by residues 799-1172, the second is a calmodulin binding domain that is able to interact with calmodulin at low [Ca2+] (Menegazzi et al., 16Menegazzi P. Larini F. Treves S. Guerrini R. Quadroni M. Zorzato F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9078-9084Google Scholar). We also show that a modification of the calmodulin binding site, which leads to the loss of calmodulin binding, also brings about the loss of the interaction of fusion protein 19E with its target sequence. These results represent the first evidence for a functional role for the region of the RYR encompassing Gly341; it is tempting to think that this residue plays a crucial role in the intramolecular link between sequences encompassed by fusion protein 19E and calmodulin binding domains of the RYR. The abnormalities of the RYR in MH susceptible individuals could be due to a modification of this intramolecular interaction, which may in turn lead to an increase in Ca2+ sensitivity. However, one should also consider that 19E interacts with another region of the RYR defined by residues 799-1172 as well as with a 110-kDa peptide present in terminal cisternae vesicles. These interactions could also play an important role in the regulation of Ca2+ release from the RYR."
https://openalex.org/W1966074333,"2-Iodohexadecanal (2-IHDA) is a major thyroid iodolipid. It mimics the main regulatory effects of iodide on thyroid metabolism: inhibition of H2O2 production and of adenylyl cyclase. The biosynthesis of 2-IHDA and its metabolism have been investigated in cultured dog thyroid cells maintained in a differentiated state by forskolin. Incubation of these cells with [9,10-3H]hexadecan-1-ol or [9,10-3H]palmitic acid labeled several phospholipids, but [9,10-3H]hexadecan-1-ol was selectively incorporated into plasmenylethanolamine. In the presence of an exogenous H2O2 generating system (glucose oxidase), iodide induced the production of [9,10-3H]2-IHDA from [9,10-3H]hexadecan-1-ol-labeled cells but not from [9,10-3H]palmitic acid-labeled cells. 2-IHDA was also generated during the lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination of brain and heart plasmalogens, and of ethyl hexadec-1-enyl ether, a synthetic vinyl ether-containing compound. Taken together, these results show that thyroid 2-IHDA is derived from plasmenylethanolamine via an attack of reactive iodine on the vinyl ether group. 2-Iodohexadecan-1-ol (2-IHDO) was also detected in these studies; it was formed later than 2-IHDA, and thyroid cells converted exogenous 2-IHDA into 2-IHDO in a time-dependent way. The ratio of 2-IHDO/2-IHDA increased with H2O2 production and decreased as a function of iodide concentration. An aldehyde-reducing activity was detected in subcellular fractions of the horse thyroid. No formation of 2-iodohexadecanoic acid could be detected. Reduction into the biologically inactive 2-IHDO is thus a major metabolic pathway of 2-IHDA in dog thyrocytes. 2-Iodohexadecanal (2-IHDA) is a major thyroid iodolipid.

It has been known as early as 1955 that the iodinating capacity of the thyroid gland is not restricted to tyrosyl residues in thyroglobulin. Some of the unknown iodinated compounds were characterized as lipids. The major iodolipid formed in the horse thyroid incubated in vitro with iodide was identified as 2-iodohexadecanal (2-IHDA) 1The abbreviations used are: 2-IHDA2-iodohexadecanalBSAbovine serum albuminEHDEethyl hexadec-1-enyl etherGCgas chromatographyRPreverse phaseNPnormal phaseHPLChigh performance liquid chromatography2-IHDO2-iodohexadecan-1-olLSIMSliquid secondary ion mass spectrometryMGmonoacylglycerolEIelectron impactMSmass spectrometryPEsynthetic phosphatidylethanolaminePLEphosphatidylethanolamine containing 60% plasmenylethanolamineHPTLChigh performance thin layer chromatographyTSHthyrotropin.

This compound was also detected in the rat, the dog, and the human thyroid (1Pereira A. Braekman J.-C. Dumont J.E. Boeynaems J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17018-17025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Panneels V. Van den Bergen H. Niccoli P. Van Sande J. Braekman J.C. Boeynaems J.M. Thyroid. 1995; 5: 123Google Scholar). Another α-iodoaldehyde, 2-iodooctadecanal, was also detected in the rat thyroid and in the dog thyroid where it was even more abundant than 2-IHDA (1Pereira A. Braekman J.-C. Dumont J.E. Boeynaems J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17018-17025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pleiotropic inhibitory actions of excess iodide on the thyroid are well known and constitute an homeostatic mechanism of protection against thyrotoxicosis in case of sudden exposure to an abundant supply of iodine (3Wolff J. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1989; 261: 211-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It was shown recently that 2-IHDA mimics several of the actions of iodide. In particular, it directly inhibited the H2O2-producing NADPH oxidase, which is the target of the Wolff-Chaikoff effect (4Corvilain B. Van Sande J. Dumont J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 154: 1287-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), in thyroid porcine membranes (5Ohayon R. Boeynaems J.-M. Braekman J.-C. Van den Bergen H. Gorin Y. Virion A. Mol.

Dumont J.E. Boeynaems J.M. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 1994; 106: 41-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This latter effect shared several features of the inhibition of cAMP formation by iodide (7Van Sande J. Cochaux P. Dumont J.E. Mol.

Van Sande J. Swillens S. Dumont J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 170: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) in intact cells or in membranes prepared from thyroid tissue exposed to iodide. Furthermore a comparison with various 2-IHDA analogues demonstrated that the effects of 2-IHDA are highly specific and identified the critical role of two structural determinants: the aldehyde function and the iodine at C2 (6Panneels V.

These data suggest that 2-IHDA is the mediator of the regulatory actions of iodide on the thyroid. So far little attention has been paid to the biosynthesis and metabolic fate of 2-IHDA. The attack of reactive iodine on the vinyl ether group of plasmalogens appears as a rather straightforward mechanism of 2-IHDA formation.

Briefly, iodine (49 mg, 0.20 mmol, 1 eq) and mercury (II) chloride (26 mg, 0.10 mmol, 0.5 eq) were added to [9,10-3H]hexadecanal dissolved in dry dichloromethane (1 ml) and mixed with 25 mg of octanal (30 μl, 0.20 mmol, 2 eq) to prevent the radiodegradation of [9,10-3H]2-iodohexadecanal. Just before use, [9,10-3H]2-iodohexadecanal was separated from 2-iodooctanal by RP-HPLC as described below. The following two-step sequence was used to prepare the mixture of E/Z isomers of ethyl hexadec-1-enyl ether starting from hexadecanal. 517 mg (2.15 mmol) of hexadecanal were dissolved in anhydrous ethanol (3 ml) under nitrogen. A catalytic amount of p-toluenesulfonic acid and molecular sieves (4 Å) were added, and the mixture was refluxed until completion of Reaction 1 Reaction 1. Synthesis of hexadecanal diethyl acetal. . The reaction was monitored by TLC (hexane/dichloromethane, 1:1) or by infrared analysis (disappearance of the carbonyl band at 1732 cm−1) and was completed within 24 h. The mixture was diluted with hexane (50 ml) and washed with an aqueous solution of NaOH 0.5%, and the organic layer was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by flash chromatography on silica gel (hexane/dichloromethane, 95:5) affording the pure acetal as an oil (294 mg, 43%).

After cooling to −10°C, 40 μl (0.18 mmol, 1.5 eq) of hexamethyldisilazane and 25 μl (0.16 mmol, 1.3 eq) of trimethylsilyl iodide were added (Reaction 2 Reaction 2. Synthesis of ethyl hexadec-1-enyl ether(14Miller R.D. McKean D.R. Tetrahedron Lett. 1982; 23: 323-326Crossref Scopus (54) Google Scholar). ). The mixture was stirred under dry nitrogen for 3 h at 0°C, and then at room temperature (20 h) until completion of the reaction (TLC, hexane/ether 8:2), and then diluted with pentane (20 ml), washed with a cold saturated aqueous NaHCO3 solution, and dried over anhydrous K2CO3. After removal of the solvent in vacuo, the residue was chromatographed on silica gel (hexane with 0.1% triethylamine) to afford 12 mg (37%) of a colorless oil consisting of a 7:3 mixture of the Z/E isomers of ethyl hexadec-1-enyl ether.

Ethyl hexadec-1-enyl ether was purified by RP-HPLC on a octadecyl silica gel column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm) eluted isocratically with acetonitrile (1 ml/min). EHDE, synthetic phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylethanolamine containing 60% of plasmenylethanolamine (PLE), or phosphatidylcholine containing 30% of plasmenylcholine (200 μg) were incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min in 2 ml of a phosphate buffer (0.1, pH 7.4) containing lactoperoxidase (7 μg/ml, 200 units/mg), [125I]NaI (30 μCi/ml), KI (16 μ), and H2O2 (0.26 m). The reaction was stopped by the addition of ethyl acetate (2 × 2 ml). After partial evaporation of the sample and solubilization in chloroform, the neutral lipids were separated from their plasmalogen precursors on silica gel cartridges (Sep PakR) and eluted with chloroform (10 ml). 2-IHDA production was determined by HPTLC, reverse and straight phase HPLC, and by GC-MS, as described below. First the lipid extracts were purified on silica gel cartridges (Sep PakR) from which they were eluted with chloroform (10 ml). An aliquot of the sample was chromatographed on HPTLC silica gel plates over 55 or 120 mm, with n-hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid (8:2:0.1). The radiolabeled lipids were detected by autoradiography of the TLC plate. In this system, the RF of the standards 2-IHDA and 2-IHDO were 0.83 ± 0.05 and 0.33 ± 0.04, respectively (mean ± S.D. of seven elutions). The detection of 2-IHDA by RP-HPLC was performed on a octadecyl silica gel column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm) eluted isocratically with acetonitrile (1 ml/min). The retention times of 2-IHDA, 2-IHDO and 2-iodohexadecanoic acid detected spectrophotometrically at 276 nm were, respectively, 11.0 ± 0.4 min (mean ± S.D. of 11 injections), 10.2 ± 0.3 min (mean ± S.D. of two injections), and 8.1 ± 0.7 min (mean ± S.D. of three injections). The detection of 2-IHDA by NP-HPLC was performed on a Lichrospher Silica Gel column (4 × 250 mm, 5 μm). Elution was performed with n-hexane/chloroform/acetic acid (90:10:0.5) for 5 min at 1 ml/min and then with a linear gradient to n-hexane/chloroform/acetic acid (20:80:0.5) over 5 min. Fractions of 0.5 or 1 ml were counted using a liquid scintillation counter or a γ-counter. The retention times of synthetic 2-IHDA, 2-IHDO, and 2-iodohexadecanoic acid were, respectively, 4.5 ± 0.8 min (mean ± S.D. of nine injections), 16.5 ± 0.9 min (mean ± S.D. of nine injections), and 6.3 ± 0.36 min (mean ± S.D. of four injections). GC-MS analyses were performed using a capillary GC (TRACOR 540) coupled to an ion trap detector mass spectrometer (FINNIGAN ITD 800) on a 1.5 m × 0.25 mm fused silica gel column (Wcot) containing chemically bonded polyethylene glycol (CP-Wax 52CB, Chrompack). The following elution program was applied: initial temperature, 100°C (1 min); final temperature, 200°C; rate of rise, 30°C/min. The temperature of the transfer line was 220°C. Helium was used as carrier gas (pressure, 15 p.s.i.). Injections were performed directly on-column. Electron impact (EI) with an electron beam energy of 70 eV or chemical ionization with ammonia were both used. 2-IHDA was analyzed either as such or after derivatization into its O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl)oxime derivative, prepared as follows: a solution of 0.6 mg (2.4 μmol) of O-(2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorobenzyl)hydroxylamine hydrochloride in water (100 μl) was added to 2-IHDA (15 μg, 41 nmol) dissolved in ethanol (100 μl). The mixture was vortexed for 5 min and allowed to stand at room temperature for 25 min. The mixture was diluted with water (0.4 ml) and extracted with hexane (3 × 0.5 ml). The hexane phase was analyzed by GC-MS using the conditions described above. Phospholipids (PLE, Sigma P 9137) were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1) and analyzed with a Waters Associates HPLC apparatus equipped with a Waters 510 pump, a thermostatic regulator Waters TCM, and a variable wavelength Merck Hitachi L-4000 UV detector (detection at 205 nm). Instrument control, data acquisition, and data processing were provided by a Waters Millennium 2.1 data system. Phospholipid molecular species were separated with RP-HPLC on a RP-18 Lichrospher 100 (4 × 250 mm, 5 μm) column (Merck) as the stationary phase and a mobile phase of methanol/acetonitrile/water (90.5:7.0:2.5) containing 20 m choline chloride by isocratic elution at 1.5 ml/min, at 35°C (15Gross R.W. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1662-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Liquid secondary ion mass spectrometry (LSIMS) of phospholipids was performed on a FISONS VG AUTOSPEC spectrometer. Phospholipids were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (1:1) and mixed with glycerol used as the matrix. For acid methanolysis, PLE (100 μg, Sigma P 9137) was dissolved in chloroform (100 μl) and treated with 2.5 methanolic HCl (200 μl) at room temperature for 30 min under magnetic stirring (16Kayganich K.A. Murphy R.C. Anal. Chem. 1992; 64: 2965-2971Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). After complete evaporation of the solvents under nitrogen, the residue was dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1) (500 μl) and analyzed by RP-HPLC using the conditions described above. Minced dog thyroid tissue was digested by collagenase type I (120 units/ml) and deoxyribonuclease (100 units/ml) in basal Eagle's medium for 60 min at 37°C (17Roger P.P. Servais P. Dumont J.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1987; 172: 282-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The resulting suspension of follicles was filtered through nylon mesh, separated from isolated cells by three centrifugations (2 min at 770 × g followed by 2 min at 100 × g twice) and seeded on 6-cm diameter Petri dishes at a density of 350,000 cells/cm2 in a mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium/MCDB 104 medium (2:1:1, v/v/v) supplemented by 2 m sodium pyruvate, 5 μg/ml insulin, 40 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2.5 μg/ml amphotericin B. The Petri dishes were maintained in a water-saturated incubator at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. After 24 h of cell spreading, the medium was replaced by the same mixture supplemented with forskolin (5 μ), in order to induce cell differentiation (18Roger P.P. Van Heuverswyn B. Lambert C. Reuse S. Vassart G. Dumont J.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 152: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The test incubations were made on the fourth day. Dog thyrocytes were labeled with [9,10-3H]hexadecan-1-ol (100 μCi/dish) for the last 24 h of culture (19Thomas S.E. Morris S.J. Xu Z. Byers D.M. Palmer F.B. Spence M.W. Cook H.W. Biochim. Biophys.

Cells were scraped in 2 ml of glacial phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged at 4°C for 5 min at 770 × g and homogenized in 1 ml of methanol/chloroform (2:1) at 0°C. The homogenate was centrifuged at 4°C for 5 min at 2770 × g. The resulting pellet was homogenized a second time at 0°C in 1 ml of methanol/chloroform (2:1), and the homogenate was centrifuged at 4°C for 5 min at 2770 × g. The supernatants of the two centrifugations were pooled, and the solvent composition was adjusted (methanol/chloroform/water, 1:1:0.9) in order to allow phase separation (20Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42689) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the total lipid extracts were resolved on HPTLC aluminum silica gel 60 plates (Merck, 200 × 200 mm) by a two-step one-dimensional elution. The first elution was developed over 7 cm with chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (58:38:0.9:2.7) (21Holub B.J. Skeaff C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 141: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and was followed by a second one using ethyl acetate/isooctane/acetic acid/water (58:27:11:4) over 12 cm. Standard lipids co-migrating with the samples were visualized by iodine vapor, and the corresponding zones in sample lanes were cut, eluted, and counted in a β-scintillation counter. To quantify plasmalogen labeling on the sn1 position, the vinyl ether bond of the plasmalogen was cleaved by acidic treatment of the plate (15 min of HCl 37% vapor) after the first elution; the radioactivity removed by HCl corresponds to plasmalogens (22Ferrell W.J. Radloff D.M. Radloff J.F. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 37: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Dog thyrocytes were pre-equilibrated at 37°C in a HEPES-buffered medium: 20 m HEPES (pH 7.4), 3 m Na2HPO4, 120 m NaCl, 5 m KCl, 1 m MgCl2, 1 m CaCl2, 10 m glucose. After 30 min, the medium was replaced by 3 ml of fresh buffer containing BSA (0.5 mg/ml) with or without TSH (1 milliunit/ml). Two types of experiments were performed. In some cases, the incubation medium contained [125I]NaI (33 μCi/ml, 0.01-10 μ) with or without glucose oxidase (0.0024-2.4 units/ml or -amino acid oxidase (1.2 units/ml). In other experiments, the dog thyrocytes, labeled with [9,10-3H]hexadecan-1-ol as described above, were incubated with or without KI (100 μ), glucose oxidase (2.4 units/ml), and methimazole (500 μ). The incubation was stopped after 3 h; cells were rinsed and scraped in 2 ml of glacial phosphate-buffered saline. Lipid extraction and iodolipid separation and detection were performed as described above. Aldehyde reductase and alcohol dehydrogenase activities were determined in horse thyroid subcellular fractions by monitoring the decrease in the absorbance at 343 nm due to the oxidation of NAD(P)H in the presence of 2-IHDA. Horse thyroid membranes (6Panneels V. Van Sande J. Van den Bergen H. Jacoby C. Braekman J.C. Dumont J.E. Boeynaems J.M. Mol.

The kinetics of NADH or NADPH disappearance were performed over 30 min at 37°C on a Uvikon 930 (Kontron Instruments) spectrophotometer. The molar extinction coefficient of NAD(P)H at 343 nm is 6200 −1·cm−1. The incubation of a crude preparation of bovine brain PLE or of bovine heart phosphatidylcholine containing plasmenylcholine with lactoperoxidase, radioiodide, and H2O2 generated an iodinated material co-migrating with synthetic 2-IHDA in HPTLC (Fig. 1a) and in RP-HPLC (not shown). This material was not produced when synthetic PE was incubated under the same experimental conditions (Fig. 1a). The iodination of the PLE preparation by lactoperoxidase was associated with the consumption of plasmenylethanolamine and not phosphatidylethanolamine (Fig. 1b, B). To establish the specific role of the vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens in the generation of 2-IHDA, EHDE (23Marmer W.N. Nungesser E. Foglia T.A. Lipids. 1986; 21: 648-651Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar) was synthesized. Incubation of EHDE with lactoperoxidase and radioiodide generated an iodinated material co-eluting with synthetic 2-IHDA in HPTLC (Fig. 1a) and in RP-HPLC (not shown). The identity of this compound as 2-IHDA was confirmed by GC-MS (Fig. 1c). When dog thyrocytes in culture were incubated with radioiodide, they produced two iodolipids co-eluting in RP-HPLC with synthetic 2-IHDA (Fig. 2) and 2-iodooctadecanal (data not shown). This production was amplified in the presence of the H2O2 generating system glucose-glucose oxidase (Fig. 2): 2.4 units/ml glucose oxidase induced a 11.7 ± 5.0-fold increase (mean ± S.D. of five experiments) of the radioactivity incorporated into the neutral lipids fraction containing 2-IHDA. As control, no radioactivity was found in the lipid extract when nonthyroid cells (COS-7 cells) were incubated with radioiodide and glucose oxidase (data not shown). Using [9,10-3H]hexadecan-1-ol to label plasmalogens in the sn1 position (19Thomas S.E. Morris S.J. Xu Z. Byers D.M. Palmer F.B. Spence M.W. Cook H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1126: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we investigated if they were the source of 2-IHDA in dog thyrocytes. When the cells were incubated with [9,10-3H]hexadecan-1-ol or [9,10-3H]palmitic acid, several classes of lipids were labeled (Table I). The labeling patterns were similar, except for a larger incorporation of [9,10-3H]hexadecan-1-ol in the fraction co-migrating with the PE standard. This difference was abolished following exposure of the plates to HCl vapor, which is known to cleave the vinyl ether bond of plasmalogens (22Ferrell W.J. Radloff D.M. Radloff J.F. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 37: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The RP-HPLC chromatogram of phospholipids remaining after acid methanolysis of the PLE mixture was similar to the chromatogram obtained after lactoperoxidase-catalyzed iodination of PLE mixture with disappearance of the same plasmalogen peaks (Fig. 1b, C). The results are thus consistent with a selective incorporation of [9,10-3H]hexadecan-1-ol at the sn1 position of plasmenylethanolamine. On the basis of the difference between the radioactivity present before and after HCl treatment, we computed that 12.3 ± 3.8% of the cell-associated hexadecan-1-ol label was incorporated into plasmenylethanolamine (mean ± S.D. of seven different experiments). That difference was only 4.2 ± 2.6% (p < 0.0001, paired Student's t test on 19 samples, seven experiments) in the case of plasmenylcholine.Table IComparison of the labeling of dog thyrocytes phospholipids by [9,10-3H]hexadecan-1-ol and [9,10-3H]palmitic acid: labeling of plasmalogens by [9,10-3H]hexadecan-l-ol]Hexadecan-1-ol labelingPalmitic acid labelingHCl treatment−+−+LPC2.8 ± 0.24.1 ± 3.45.0 ± 04.1 ± 1PC46.1 ± 0.144.1 ± 0.756.5 ± 7.850.8 ± 13PS + PI6.5 ± 1.45.0 ± 0.49.0 ± 0.56.2 ± 0.8PE27.5 ± 1.310.0 ± 1.214.5 ± 0.213.0 ± 0.1PA1.0 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.11.0 ± 01.4 ± 0DAG, TG, NL16.2 ± 3.335.7 ± 4.713.8 ± 7.024.4 ± 14 Open table in a new tab Incubation of [9,10-3H]hexadecan-1-ol-labeled dog thyrocytes with both iodide (100 μ) and glucose oxidase (2.4 units/ml) led to the generation of a tritium-labeled material co-eluting with synthetic 2-IHDA in RP-HPLC and representing 0.11-0.56% of the cell-associated [9,10-3H]hexadecan-1-ol labeling (range of five experiments) (Fig. 3). Production of this material was inhibited by methimazole at a concentration (500 μ) that is known to inhibit iodolipid formation in horse thyroid slices (1Pereira A. Braekman J.-C. Dumont J.E. Boeynaems J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17018-17025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). That compound was not detectable when [9,10-3H]palmitic acid-labeled dog thyrocytes were incubated with iodide and glucose oxidase (Fig. 4). In these experiments, the radioactivity recovered in the total lipid extract was 22 ± 3 106 and 41 ± 7 106 cpm, respectively, with hexadecan-1-ol and palmitic acid labeling, indicating that the negative result with [9,10-3H]palmitic acid was not due to a lower incorporation into the thyrocytes.Fig. 4Comparison of the iodination of [9,10-3H]hexadecan-1-ol and [9,10-3H]palmitic acid-labeled material in dog thyroid cells exposed to iodide.

The cells were then incubated for 3 h at 37°C in 3 ml of HEPES-buffered medium containing BSA (0.5 mg/ml), TSH (1 milliunit/ml), KI (100 μ), and glucose oxidase (0.8 unit/ml).

ABC proteins have a characteristic modular organization; they contain two membrane-spanning domains (MSDs), each with multiple transmembrane spans, and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs), which hydrolyze ATP. STE6 is an ABC transporter that mediates export of the a-factor mating pheromone in Saccharomyces cerevisiae; it is 1 of over 20 ABC proteins known to exist in yeast (3Kuchler K. Sterne R.E.

ABC proteins may be classified by the organization of their four modules. STE6 contains all four modules (two MSDs and two NBDs) on a single polypeptide. This 4-in-1 arrangement is seen in many eukaryotic ABC proteins, including P-glycoprotein, also called the multidrug resistance protein (MDR) (8Gottesman M.M. Hrycyna C.A. Schoenlein P.V. Germann U.A. Pastan I. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 607-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar), and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) (2Higgins C.F.

Alternatively, many ABC transporters are composed of half-size molecules, which contain one MSD and one NBD on a single polypeptide. Such half-molecules are thought to associate into hetero- or homodimers (2-plus-2 arrangement). The mammalian TAP transporter, which transports peptides into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum for antigen presentation, is encoded as two half-molecules (TAP1 and TAP2) that heterodimerize to form the functional peptide transporter (10Androlewicz M.J.

The Drosophila genes white (w), brown (bw), and scarlet (st) all encode half-molecules that are thought to associate in pairs to transport the pigment precursors responsible for eye color. The products of w and bw are required for guanine transport, while the w and st gene products are required for tryptophan transport (13Ewart G.D. Cannell D. Cox G.B. Howells A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10370-10377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Escherichia coli hemolysin transporter, HlyB, is encoded as a half-molecule that functions as a homodimer (14Koronakis V. Hughes C. Koronakis E. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 1163-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Many prokaryotic members of the ABC superfamily are further subdivided, with their MSDs and NBDs on separate polypeptides; examples include the oligopeptide permease (OppBCDF), the histidine permease (HisMPQ), the maltose permease (MalFGK), and a protease exporter (PrtDEF) (15Fath M.J.

For ABC proteins that consist of more than one polypeptide, the multiple subunits are thought to physically associate with one another in order to form the complete transporter (20Panagiotidis C.H. Reyes M. Sievertsen A. Boos W. Shuman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23685-23696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To begin to define critical sites of contact between modules of an ABC protein, we have examined the interactions between separately expressed domains of STE6 by testing the ability of partial molecules to interact and to restore function to a strain lacking the native STE6 gene. In a previous study, we showed that STE6 half-molecules, when co-expressed, can promote transport of a-factor (21Berkower C. Michaelis S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3777-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate by co-immunoprecipitation that these half-molecules interact physically, supporting the view that they assemble in vivo to form a functional transporter. We also demonstrate a physical interaction between STE6 half-molecules and full-length STE6. Such complexes appear to be functional as well, since we observe strikingly efficient rescue of the defective activity of mutated full-length STE6 by co-expression of the corresponding “wild-type” half-molecule; this type of intragenic complementation may have potential implications for cystic fibrosis gene therapy. We also demonstrate that a STE6 quarter-molecule consisting of the N-terminal MSD of STE6 can interact physically and functionally with the C-terminal three-quarters of STE6. Thus, information capable of driving assembly is contained in the membrane-spanning domains of STE6. Taken together, our studies with STE6 partial molecules indicate that physical interactions between certain modules of STE6 can occur efficiently and reflect a functionally productive association.

Open table in a new tab Metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation of a-factor were carried out under steady-state conditions, as described previously (21Berkower C. Michaelis S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3777-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Immunofluorescence using the anti-HA 12CA5 monoclonal antibody was done as described (27Berkower C. Loayza D. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1185-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). For preparation of unlabeled extracts for immunoprecipitation, cells were grown to exponential phase (A600 0.5-1.5) in SC dropout medium. Cells (30 A600) were harvested, washed twice in distilled water and once in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 m NaCl, 5 m EDTA, 50 m Tris, pH 7.5, 1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml chymostatin), resuspended in 100 μl of IP buffer, and lysed by vortexing with acid-washed glass beads in 12 one-min pulses at 4°C. The lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min and spun for 15 min in a microcentrifuge at 13,000 rpm. To ensure that all insoluble material was removed, the supernatant was spun for an additional 30 min in a Beckman TL-100 ultracentrifuge (TLA 100.2 rotor) at 80,000 rpm. A volume of supernatant corresponding to that derived from 10 A600 units of cells was raised to 1 ml in IP buffer and incubated overnight at 4°C with 5 μl of anti-HA 12CA5 mouse monoclonal antibody (BAbco, Richmond, CA), 10 μl of anti-myc 9E10 mouse monoclonal antibody (ascites fluid; gift of J. Borjigin and J. Nathans), or 10 μl of anti-STE6-NBD2 C12-JH210 rabbit polyclonal antibody (21Berkower C. Michaelis S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3777-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Antigen-antibody complexes were collected on either Protein A-Sepharose beads (for 12CA5 and C12-JH210) or Protein G-agarose beads (for 9E10) and washed four times in IP buffer and twice in wash buffer B (150 m NaCl, 5 m EDTA, 50 m Tris, pH 7.5, 1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml chymostatin). Proteins were released from the beads by addition of Laemmli sample buffer and incubated at 37°C for 20 min prior to electrophoresis. SDS-PAGE was carried out using 8.6% acrylamide Laemmli gels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose in transfer buffer (192 m glycine, 25 m Tris, 15% methanol) for 4 h at a constant current of 400 mA. Filters were stained with Ponceau S stain and examined for uniformity of transfer and then probed with HRP-conjugated anti-HA antibodies and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Boehringer Mannheim). For the bottom panel of Fig. 2, the filter was reprobed after storage with HRP-conjugated anti-myc antibodies. HRP-conjugated antibodies were a gift of J. Gill and D. J. Ashmore (Boehringer Mannheim). To prepare labeled extracts for immunoprecipitation of STE6 full-length and partial molecules, cells (5 A600U) were labeled with 200 μCi of EXPRE35S35S (DuPont NEN) for 20 min at 30°C, and proteins were extracted as above. Following immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE, labeled proteins were visualized by autoradiography. It was important to confirm that the functional rescue of mutant full-length ste6 molecules by half-molecules is due to complementation, rather than to regeneration of a full-length wild-type STE6 gene by DNA recombination. To distinguish between these possibilities, we examined plasmids recovered from 12 independent diploid mating products. If mating were the result of complementation of mutant full-length ste6 by a wild-type half-molecule, then none of the plasmids recovered from the diploid mating products should contain a wild-type STE6 gene. On the other hand, if mating resulted from recombination, we would expect to recover only wild-type full-length STE6-containing plasmids from the diploid mating products. Two types of tests were carried out. In the first test, individually purified colonies from strain SM1646 transformed with pSM338 (full-length mutant ste6-K398R) plus pSM537 (N-Half) were patch-mated to a MATα mating tester (KFY112), and diploids from 12 independent matings were isolated. Plasmids were recovered from each diploid and transformed into E. coli. DNA was purified from multiple E. coli isolates, and those containing full-length STE6 were analyzed further for the absence or presence of a BglII site, which is diagnostic for the K398R mutation. Plasmids carrying full-length STE6 all contained the BglII site corresponding to the K398R mutation. No plasmids carrying a wild-type STE6 gene were recovered, indicating that mating was not the result of recombination between N-Half and STE6 to regenerate a full-length, wild-type STE6 gene. In the second test, transformants of SM1646 carrying plasmid pSM434 (ste6-C-Half) together with pSM440 (ste6-G1087V) and transformants carrying plasmid pSM537 (N-Half) together with either pSM338 (ste6-K398R), pSM438 (ste6-G392V), or pSM402 (ste6-G509D) were patch-mated to KFY112. Plasmids were isolated from the resulting diploids and retransformed into strain SM2721 (ste6-Δ5). Individual transformants displayed either the rare mating phenotype associated with the full-length ste6 mutant or the nonmating phenotype associated with expression of a lone STE6 half-molecule. No transformant displayed the confluent mating phenotype associated with complementation of a full-length ste6 mutant by co-expression of a half-molecule. This test provided independent evidence that the increase in mating observed when a half-molecule is co-expressed with full-length mutant ste6 is due to complementation and not to recombination and generation of a wild-type STE6 gene. We showed previously that co-expression of the N-Half and C-Half of STE6 leads to efficient export of a-factor (21Berkower C. Michaelis S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3777-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Here, we sought to determine whether the functional complementation of the two half-molecules reflects their physical interaction. STE6 half-molecules and other partial constructs used in this study are depicted schematically in Fig. 1. We constructed epitope-tagged versions of each half of STE6, using different epitopes, and asked whether antibodies specific to an epitope present on one half could immunoprecipitate the other, when the two halves were co-expressed in the same cell. The N-Half of STE6 was tagged with the myc epitope to generate N-Half-myc, while the C-Half of STE6 was tagged with the influenza hemagglutinin epitope to generate C-Half-HA. The two halves of STE6 were expressed from separate vectors in a Δste6 strain. Extracts were prepared in buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, and proteins were immunoprecipitated with mouse monoclonal anti-myc antibodies. Immunoprecipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunodetection was carried out with HRP-conjugated mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibodies. The anti-myc immunoprecipitates do not contain a specific band recognized by anti-HA antibodies when either N-Half-myc or C-Half-HA is expressed alone (Fig. 2, lanes 1 and 2). However, when both halves are co-expressed in the same cell, a 60-65-kDa band corresponding to C-Half-HA is apparent (Fig. 2, lane 3), indicating that C-Half-HA co-immunoprecipitates with N-Half-myc, and suggesting that they can form a complex in vivo. (It should be noted that C-Half-HA exhibits a greater mobility than its predicted molecular mass of 72 kDa, as does untagged C-Half (21Berkower C. Michaelis S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3777-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar).) The interaction between the two halves must occur in vivo prior to cell lysis, since co-immunoprecipitation is not observed when lysates from two strains expressing each half separately are mixed (Fig. 2, lane 4). The efficiency of the interaction between the two halves can be roughly quantitated by comparison of the amount of C-Half-HA obtained by co-immunoprecipitation with N-Half-myc (lane 3) to that obtained when C-Half-HA is immunoprecipitated directly with anti-HA antibodies (lanes 5-8). The amount of C-Half-HA that co-immunoprecipitates with N-Half-myc is about 10% of the total amount of immunoprecipitable C-Half-HA. We have previously shown that STE6 half-molecules when expressed independently exhibit the same stability as one another and as full-length STE6 (27Berkower C. Loayza D. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1185-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To ensure that the level of N-Half-myc is the same in the absence and presence of the C-Half-HA, the membrane in the upper left panel of Fig. 2 was reprobed with HRP-conjugated anti-myc antibodies (Fig. 2, lower panel). Comparison of lanes 2 and 3 indicates that N-Half-myc is present at an equivalent level whether or not C-Half-HA is present. To test if STE6 half-molecules can also associate with full-length STE6, we tagged each STE6 half-molecule with the myc epitope and expressed it alone or in combination with full-length STE6-HA. As shown in Fig. 3, full-length STE6-HA can co-immunoprecipitate both with N-Half-myc (lane 3) and with C-Half-myc (lane 11). The efficiency of this interaction, as quantitated by comparison to the sample directly immunoprecipitated with anti-HA, is about 20% (lanes 5-8 and 13-16), roughly similar to the interaction between the two halves themselves. To examine whether the observed interaction between full-length and half-molecules of STE6 is a functional one, we asked if a wild-type half-molecule could rescue the mating defect of a full-length ste6 mutant. We expressed six ste6 substitution mutants, three altered in NBD1 and three in NBD2, either alone or in combination with a corresponding wild-type half-molecule (containing a wild-type version of the mutated NBD). The three NBD1 point mutants, G392V, K398R, and G509D, have mating efficiencies ≤1% of the wild-type level ((21) and Table II). When N-Half is expressed in strains bearing these ste6 mutants, mating is increased dramatically (Table II and Fig. 4). When C-Half is expressed together with the NBD2 mutants, G1087V, K1093R, and G1193D, mating efficiency is also dramatically increased (Table II and Fig. 4 for G1087V). Therefore, the physical interaction between full-length STE6 and half-molecules appears to reflect a functionally significant interaction. In contrast, co-expression of C-Half with an NBD1 mutant does not significantly improve mating, nor does co-expression of N-Half with an NBD2 mutant (Fig. 4).Table II.Rescue of full-length ste6 mutants by co-expression of a half-moleculeSTE6 mutationMating efficiencyaThe mating efficiencies of strains bearing the indicated mutant STE6 plasmids were measured by quantitative mating assays and are expressed as percentages of the mating efficiency of a strain containing a wild-type STE6 plasmid (pSM322).

Each value is averaged from three experiments. The mating efficiency of a Δste6 strain carrying a single plasmid that contains only the N-Half or C-Half of STE6 is <0.0001%. Open table in a new tab ste6 NBD mutants that impair mating efficiency do so because the a-factor pheromone is exported from the cell at reduced levels (21Berkower C. Michaelis S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3777-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether the functional complementation observed when a half-molecule is co-expressed with a full-length ste6 NBD mutant is also manifested as an increased level of a-factor export. Cells were metabolically labeled, and secreted a-factor was immunoprecipitated from the medium. As shown in Fig. 5, lanes 3-8, for each NBD1 mutant that we tested, co-expression of N-Half causes a dramatic increase in the amount of a-factor exported. Similarly, co-expression of C-Half causes increased a-factor export from each NBD2 mutant (Fig. 5, lanes 9-14). Therefore, complementation of a full-length ste6 NBD mutant by a half-molecule occurs by improving the ability of mutant ste6 to transport its substrate, a-factor, and not by circumventing the normal dependence of mating on a-factor export. To ensure that rescue of a full-length ste6 point mutant by a half-molecule is achieved by complementation and not by recombination between the two plasmids to regenerate a wild-type STE6 gene, we analyzed DNA from diploids produced when the MATa Δste6 strain co-expressing both constructs was mated to a MATα partner. DNA was obtained from over 15 independent diploid mating products and analyzed, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In no case was a wild-type STE6 gene recovered, indicating that the observed increase in mating was due to complementation resulting from the interaction of two separately encoded molecules, rather than to DNA recombination. The reduced activity of the ste6 NBD mutants used in this study could in principle result either from impaired function or from mislocalization in the ER as has been observed for certain MDR1 and CFTR mutants (28Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28683-28689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Cheng S.H. Gregory R.J. Marshall J. Paul S. Souza D.W. White G.A. Cell. 1990; 63: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1398) Google Scholar). To distinguish between these two possibilities, we compared the cellular localization of the six NBD mutants with that of wild-type STE6 by immunofluorescence. It should be noted that although STE6 is present at the plasma membrane in an endocytosis-defective mutant, due to its rapid turnover rate in a wild-type strain STE6 exhibits a punctate pattern indicative of Golgi staining (27Berkower C. Loayza D. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1185-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, for all of the mutants used in this study, the staining pattern is indistinguishable from that of wild-type STE6 (compare panels c-h to panel b). For reference, staining with the ER marker Kar2 is also shown (Fig. 6, panels i-j). These results indicate that the reduced activity of the mutants cannot be attributed to retention of STE6 in the ER, in contrast to certain STE6 mutant alleles isolated in this laboratory that are retained in the ER and show a staining pattern coincident with that of Kar2. 2D. Loayza, A. Tam, and S. Michaelis, unpublished observations. We wished to determine which domain(s) of STE6 mediate the interaction between its two halves. To do so, we tested whether modular portions of STE6, such as an isolated MSD or NBD, could associate with the rest of the molecule and if such an association could regenerate a functional transporter. We generated STE6 partial (quarter and three-quarter) molecules consisting of N-1/4-HA and C-3/4, and also N-3/4-HA and C-1/4, as shown schematically in Fig. 1. We chose to tag only the N-terminal partial molecule of each pair, since we expected from the relatively high efficiency of previous co-immunoprecipitations (see above, Fig. 2, Fig. 3) that any co-precipitating C-terminal partial molecule would be detectable by direct visualization of labeled proteins in the immunoprecipitate. C-terminal partial molecules can also be identified by antibodies against NBD2. Cells carrying plasmids encoding pairs of 1/4 and 3/4 partial molecules were metabolically labeled, proteins were solubilized in the presence of 1% Triton X-100, and proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies or anti-STE6-NBD2 antibodies. As expected, a radiolabeled species corresponding to STE6-C-3/4 can be immunoprecipitated with antibodies to STE6-NBD2 (Fig. 7A, lane 4). This C-3/4 species is evident (albeit faintly) when N-1/4-HA is immunoprecipitated using anti-HA antibodies from a strain in which N-1/4-HA and C-3/4 are co-expressed (Fig. 7A, lane 3), but is absent when N-1/4 -HA and C-3/4 are expressed individually (Fig. 7A, lanes 1 and 2). Thus, MSD1 is capable of physical association with the rest of STE6 (NBD1-MSD2-NBD2), even when it is expressed separately. In contrast to the association observed between N-1/4 (MSD1) and C-3/4, when C-1/4 (NBD2) is co-expressed with N-3/4-HA, co-immunoprecipitation does not occur. The latter molecule is immunoprecipitated with anti-HA, but no band corresponding to C-1/4 is detectable (Fig. 7B, lane 3). Indeed, localization studies of the C-1/4 molecule indicate that it is completely soluble and does not associate with membranes (data not shown). When these three-quarter or one-quarter partial molecules are expressed individually in a Δste6 strain, no STE6 function is observed, as assayed by mating (Fig. 8 and data not shown). However, co-expression of N-1/4 and C-3/4 in the same strain efficiently restores its ability to mate (Fig. 8). In contrast, co-expression of N-3/4 together with C-1/4 does not give rise to any functional STE6 (Fig. 8). This lack of function is not due to low levels of C-1/4 production (see Fig. 7B, lane 4), nor is it due to instability of the C-1/4 partial molecule, which is actually much more stable than full-length STE6 and other partial molecules (27Berkower C. Loayza D. Michaelis S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 1185-1198Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These results indicate that MSD1 of STE6, when expressed independently, can form a productive association with the rest of the molecule, whereas a separately encoded NBD2 cannot associate with the rest of the molecule and fails to form a functional transporter. A distinguishing feature shared by members of the ABC superfamily is their modular design. Each transporter consists of four domains, including two MSDs and two NBDs, which may be encoded either as a single polypeptide (referred to here as a full-length protein), as two half-molecules, or as three or four separate polypeptides. We showed previously that STE6 can be severed into half-molecules, and when these two halves are co-expressed, a nearly wild-type level of STE6 function is observed (21Berkower C. Michaelis S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3777-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Two models could account for this result: 1) either the two halves must interact physically to form a single functional complex or 2) they may carry out completely independent activities, and thus do not require a direct physical interaction in order to function. The co-immunoprecipitation experiments reported here demonstrate that the two separately encoded halves of STE6 can physically interact with each other and support the model that association between STE6 half-molecules is necessary for function. The interaction between STE6 half-molecules takes place only in vivo and not in vitro after protein solubilization, suggesting that some cellular component, for instance a chaperone, may be required to mediate the assembly of the two halves. A physical association between separately encoded modules has also been demonstrated for several other ABC proteins. For instance, the mammalian TAP transporter is composed of two “half-molecules,” TAP1 and TAP2. Both subunits are required for peptide transport (30Townsend A. Trowsdale J. Semin. Cell Biol. 1993; 4: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and interaction between the subunits has been demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation (12Russ G. Esquivel F. Yewdell J.W. Cresswell P. Spies T. Bennink J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21312-21318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Other ABC proteins for which a physical interaction between modules has been detected include the bacterial maltose and histidine permeases, whose individual domains are encoded as separate polypeptides (20Panagiotidis C.H. Reyes M. Sievertsen A. Boos W. Shuman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23685-23696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Kerppola R.E. Shyamala V.K. Klebba P. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9857-9865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and mammalian MDR1 which, like STE6, is encoded as a full-length ABC protein. When artificially severed, the two halves of MDR1 were shown to interact by co-immunoprecipitation and to exhibit in vitro drug-stimulated ATPase activity that relied on the presence of both half-molecules (32Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7750-7755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). While these studies with MDR1 examined function in vitro, the experiments presented here for STE6 partial molecules provide in vivo evidence for both physical and functional interactions between modules of STE6. To begin to identify regions of interaction between modules of the STE6 polypeptide, we further subdivided STE6 into quarter and three-quarter molecules. We expressed these partial molecules either alone or together and assessed their physical interactions by co-immunoprecipitation and their functional interactions by mating tests. Our results demonstrate both a physical and a functional interaction in vivo between the N-terminal quarter molecule consisting solely of MSD1 of STE6 and a C-terminal three-quarter molecule containing the remainder of STE6 (NBD1-MSD2-NBD2). This finding indicates that the association between the two halves of STE6 occurs at least in part via membrane-spanning domains. Conversely, we did not find evidence for interaction between the C-terminal quarter molecule (NBD2) and the N-terminal three-quarters of STE6 (MSD1-NBD1-MSD2), suggesting that the NBDs, or at least NBD2, may provide little or no contribution to the interaction between the two halves of STE6. Alternatively, it is possible that when the C-terminal quarter molecule is expressed separately, it is improperly folded such that it interacts with a chaperone, at the expense of its interaction with the N-terminal three-quarters of STE6. Interestingly, a study that tested the association of domains within MDR1 (33Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21839-21844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) produced results somewhat different from those reported here for STE6. That study found that two independently encoded NBDs of MDR1 can interact with each other, as can two MSDs. In addition, it was found that an NBD and its corresponding MSD can also interact, suggesting that a significant degree of association between the two halves of MDR1 occurs through both the MSDs and NBDs. However, the in vivo functional significance of these MDR1 partial-molecule interactions was not tested. Our studies indicate that for STE6, the combined use of the co-immunoprecipitation assay, which tests physical interactions between separate domains, together with assays that measure STE6 function in vivo (mating and a-factor export), can provide an effective method for analyzing specific regions involved in the association of domains of STE6. For instance, by studying the effects of MSD1 mutations on the interaction and function of partial molecules, we expect to locate more precisely the regions within MSD1 that are important for its association with the rest of STE6. We have shown here by co-immunoprecipitation that a STE6 half-molecule, which is inactive by itself, can associate with full-length STE6. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that this interaction is functionally productive. Strikingly, when full-length STE6 containing an NBD mutation is co-expressed with the corresponding wild-type half-molecule, STE6 activity is dramatically restored, despite the fact that neither molecule alone can support mating to a significant extent. This “half-molecule complementation” phenomenon occurs for mutations in both halves of STE6. We showed that restoration of STE6 function is not due to the regeneration of a wild-type STE6 gene by DNA recombination. Instead, it is likely that a complex is formed between mutant full-length STE6 and the wild-type half-molecule. Wild-type STE6 may itself form an oligomeric complex consisting of two or more full-length molecules. The level at which the half-molecules complement the mutant full-length protein is most likely at the functional level, since none of the mutants tested here show any evidence of mislocalization; it remains to be tested whether a half-molecule could complement a mislocalized full-length version of STE6. It should be noted that we were unable to demonstrate complementation between two full-length ste6 mutants, one containing a mutation in NBD1, the other in NBD2 (data not shown). It is not clear why two NBD mutants fail to complement each other, while a half-molecule can complement mutant full-length STE6. Perhaps there are significantly greater steric limitations on interactions between the halves of STE6 when they are contained within two separate full-length STE6 proteins than between a lone half-molecule and full-length STE6. It is also possible that when a STE6 oligomer is formed that contains more then one mutant NBD, the entire oligomer is rendered nonfunctional. The phenomenon of rescue of the defective function of a full-length ste6 mutant by co-expression of a half-molecule has potentially interesting implications for the treatment of disorders involving mutant ABC proteins, notably cystic fibrosis (CF). Many CF-causing mutations result in a single-residue alteration in one of the two NBDs of CFTR (9Zielenski J. Tsui L.-C. Annu. Rev. Genetics. 1995; 29: 777-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). It is attractive to speculate that the expression of a CFTR half-molecule via gene therapy might rescue the mutant defect and restore a high level of function. Furthermore, expression of half-molecules might minimize possible problems associated with ectopic expression of full-length CFTR, such as the potential side effects of producing functional CFTR in cell types that do not normally make the protein, or the difficulty of packaging such a large gene into a viral particle. It was reported that the C-terminal half of CFTR can physically associate with its N-terminal half when both are co-expressed in HeLa cells (34Ostedgaard L.S. Rich D.P. DeBerg L.G. Welsh M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5 (Abstr. 1111): 191Google Scholar). It would be interesting to determine whether such interactions produce a functional CFTR-like complex and whether a CFTR half-molecule could rescue function when co-expressed with mutant versions of full-length CFTR.

The prothyrotropin-releasing hormone (pro-TRH) precursor (26 kDa) undergoes proteolytic cleavage at either of two sites, generating a 15/10-kDa or a 9.5/16.5-kDa N/C-terminal pair of intermediates. Using transfected AtT20 cells encoding a prepro-TRH cDNA, we have previously reported that this initial set of cleavages occurs prior to entry into the secretory granules (Nillni, E. A., Sevarino, K. A., and Jackson, I. M. D. (1993) Endocrinology 132, 1271-1277). In this study, we set out to identify the subcellular compartment where this initial cleavage takes place as well as to determine the sites of processing of the intermediates produced. Our strategy was to block the transport of pro-TRH or its intermediates from one subcellular compartment to the next and to assay for the accumulation of intermediates, presumably because their processing occurs in a post-blockade compartment.Radiolabeling experiments in AtT20 cells in the presence of the drug brefeldin A, which blocks transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex, led to an accumulation of the 26-kDa precursor, suggesting a post-endoplasmic reticulum site of processing. When Golgi complex-to-secretory granule transport was blocked at 20°C, the processing of the 26-kDa precursor was not affected, suggesting a Golgi complex site of processing. At this temperature, the 15-kDa N-terminal intermediate accumulated, suggesting a post-Golgi complex processing site, while the 16.5-kDa C-terminal intermediate was processed in the Golgi complex to produce a 5.4-kDa peptide.

The primary function of TRH is to stimulate the synthesis and release of thyrotropin-stimulating hormone, which in turn regulates thyroid function (5Jackson I.M.D. Regulation of Thyrotropin Secretion. Raven Press Ltd., New York1994Google Scholar). TRH also stimulates the synthesis and release of prolactin and growth hormone from the anterior pituitary (6Bowers C.Y. Friesen H.G. Hwang P. Guyda H.J. Folkers K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1971; 45: 1033-1041Google Scholar, 7Wilber J.F. Utiger R.D. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1967; 127: 488-490Google Scholar, 8Takahara J. Arimura A. Schally A.V. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1974; 146: 831-835Google Scholar). TRH is widely distributed within the central nervous system (9Lechan R.M. Thyroid Today. 1993; 16: 1-11Google Scholar), where it acts as both a neurotransmitter and a neuromodulator (10Metcalf G. Nature. 1974; 252: 310-311Google Scholar, 11Hedner J. Hedner T. Jonason J. Lundberg D. Neurosci. Lett. 1981; 24: 317-320Google Scholar). Among the cryptic peptides, prepro-TRH-(160-169) (pST10) has been reported to potentiate thyrotropin-stimulating hormone release from the anterior pituitary and to stimulate thyrotropin-stimulating hormone-β gene promoter activity (2Roussel J.-P. Hollande F. Bulant M. Astier H. Neuroendocrinology. 1991; 54: 559-565Google Scholar). Furthermore, prepro-TRH-(178-199) is believed to be a corticotropin-releasing inhibitory factor (3Redei E. Hilderbrand H. Aird F. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3557-3563Google Scholar), inhibiting both basal and corticotropin-releasing hormone-stimulated ACTH synthesis and secretion. However, a new publication has indicated that this cryptic peptide has no significant inhibitory effect on basal or stimulated ACTH secretion by normal pituitary corticotrophs in vitro (12Nicholson W.E. Orth D.N. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 2171-2174Google Scholar). More recently, we found that opiate withdrawal in rat periaqueductal gray produced an increase in the level of the N-terminal prepro-TRH-(53-74) (pYT22) peptide, whereas the level of TRH remained unaltered (4Legradi G. Rand W.M. Hitz S. Nillni E.A. Jackson I.M.D. Lechan R.M. Brain Res. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar), suggesting that this cryptic peptide may have a biological function in periaqueductal gray. thyrotropin-releasing hormone adrenocorticotropic hormone polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis endoplasmic reticulum Golgi complex secretory granules brefeldin A trans-Golgi network N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate pro-opiomelanocortin substance P. Rat prepro-TRH is a 29-kDa polypeptide composed of 255 amino acids. This precursor contains an N-terminal 25-amino acid leader sequence that targets the protein to the secretory pathway; five copies of the TRH progenitor sequence (Gln-His-Pro-Gly), each flanked by two pairs of basic amino acids (Lys or Arg); and seven cryptic peptides inserted between the TRH sequences (13Lechan R.M. Wu P. Jackson I.M.D. Wolfe H. Cooperman S. Mandel G. Goodman R.H. Science. 1986; 231: 159-161Google Scholar). Much of the knowledge about the post-translational processing of pro-TRH has come from studies using the AtT20 corticotropic cell line transfected with cDNA encoding prepro-TRH (1Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Jackson I.M.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1260-1270Google Scholar). By Western blot analysis, immunoprecipitation followed by SDS-PAGE, and radioimmunoassay, we demonstrated that pro-TRH is present in AtT20 cells as a 26-kDa protein. We further showed by pulse-chase analysis that the 26-kDa precursor is cleaved at two mutually exclusive sites. The first cleavage generates a 15-kDa N-terminal peptide (prepro-TRH-(25-151) or -(25-157)) and a 10-kDa C-terminal peptide (prepro-TRH-(154-255) or -(160-255)). A second (alternative) cleavage generates a 9.5-kDa N-terminal peptide (prepro-TRH-(25-106) or -(25-112)) and a 16.5-kDa C-terminal peptide (prepro-TRH-(109-255) -(115-225)). In subsequent steps using specific antibodies developed in this laboratory to multiple sequences of the prohormone, we showed that the 15-kDa N-terminal intermediate moiety of pro-TRH was further processed to a 6-kDa peptide corresponding to prepro-TRH-(25-80) and a 3.8-kDa peptide corresponding to prepro-TRH-(83-112). Processing of the remaining 10-kDa C-terminal fragment produced a 5.4-kDa peptide corresponding to the C-terminal flanking peptide prepro-TRH-(208-255). Furthermore, processing of the 9.5-kDa N-terminal fragment arising from the alternative cleavage of the 26-kDa prohormone at residues 107-108 was postulated to account for the production of the N-terminal peptides prepro-TRH-(25-50), prepro-TRH-(53-74), and prepro-TRH-(83-106), while the 16.5-kDa fragment was further processed to produce a 5.4-kDa peptide arising from the C terminus of the prohormone, prepro-TRH-(208-255) (1Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Jackson I.M.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1260-1270Google Scholar). To generate biologically active TRH or any of the other peptides, pro-TRH is cleaved at paired basic residues by the action of the recently discovered family of subtilisin/kexin-like proteases, PC1 and PC2, as has been demonstrated in our recent studies (14Nillni E.A. Friedman T.C. Todd R.B. Birch N.P. Loh Y.P. Jackson I.M.D. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2462-2472Google Scholar, 15Friedman T.C. Loh Y.P. Huang S.S. Jackson I.M.D. Nillni E.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4462-4472Google Scholar, 16Nillni E.A. Luo L.G. Jackson I.M.D. McMillan P. Endocrinology. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar). These cleavages are followed by the action of carboxypeptidase H activity to remove the basic residue(s) (17Hook V.Y.H. Loh Y.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 2776-2780Google Scholar, 18Scott R.E.M. Pintar J.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 585-596Google Scholar). To generate TRH, the TRH extended form Gln-His-Pro-Gly is then amidated by the action of peptidylglycine α-amidating monooxygenase (19Eipper B.A. Stoffers D.A. Mains R.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1992; 15: 57-85Google Scholar), and the Gln residue undergoes cyclization to a pGlu residue to yield TRH. Processing of the 26-kDa pro-TRH precursor to smaller intermediates has been shown to occur prior to packaging into the secretory granules (20Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Jackson I.M.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1271-1277Google Scholar), but the extent of the processing and the exact intracellular compartment where this processing occurs are yet unclear. In this study, we set out to determine in what intracellular compartment, the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi complex (GC), or secretory granules (SGs), the processing of pro-TRH to smaller intermediates and cryptic peptides takes place. The importance of understanding prohormone processing derives from the use of post-translational processing of hormone precursor proteins as a mechanism by which cells increase their biological and functional diversity. This paradigm therefore implies that two or more hormone peptides with different biological functions can be originated from the same gene, and it is through differential post-translational processing that cells selectively produce specific peptides for secretion. The experimental strategy used to study the sites of pro-TRH processing was to block peptide transport from one cellular compartment to another and to observe how much processing occurs prior to the point of blockade. To study the processing that occurs in the rough ER, we blocked the exit of peptides from this compartment by adding brefeldin A (BFA) to the cell medium. BFA is a fungal metabolite that blocks ER-to-GC transport of proteins by reversibly inhibiting the exchange of GDP for GTP in ARF proteins, preventing their recruitment to intracellular membranes and subsequent vesicle formation (21Helms J.B. Rhodman J.E. Nature. 1992; 360: 352-354Google Scholar, 22Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Google Scholar). To study the processing steps that occur in the GC, we incubated cells at reduced temperatures. Incubation of cells at 20°C has been shown to prevent the packaging of proteins into the SGs in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (23Saraste J. Kuismanen E. Cell. 1985; 38: 535-549Google Scholar, 24Griffiths G. Pfeiffer S. Simons K. Matlin K. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 949-964Google Scholar, 25Kuliawat R. Arvan P. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 521-529Google Scholar) and has been used previously to study the processing of other prohormones (26Milgram S.L. Mains R.E. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 737-745Google Scholar, 27Xu H. Shields D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 1169-1184Google Scholar, 28Zhou A. Mains R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17440-17447Google Scholar). Therefore, to further understand neuropeptide processing at the intracellular level, we used an AtT20 corticotropic tumor cell line expressing a prepro-TRH cDNA as previously characterized (1Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Jackson I.M.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1260-1270Google Scholar, 29Sevarino K.A. Goodman R.H. Spiess J. Jackson I.M.D. Wu P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21529-21535Google Scholar). Our results show that the 26-kDa precursor as well as its 16.5-kDa C-terminal cleavage product are processed in the GC, while the 15-kDa N-terminal intermediate is further processed in the SGs. AtT20 cells transfected with a cDNA encoding prepro-TRH (29Sevarino K.A. Goodman R.H. Spiess J. Jackson I.M.D. Wu P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21529-21535Google Scholar) were grown in 75-cm2 flasks at 37°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air with 90% humidity (30Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Wu P. Jackson I.M.D. Conn P.M. Neurosciences: Neuropeptide Technology. Academic Press, New York1991: 51Google Scholar). Each flask was plated with 5 million cells, and cultures were maintained for 6 days in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum as described previously (30Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Wu P. Jackson I.M.D. Conn P.M. Neurosciences: Neuropeptide Technology. Academic Press, New York1991: 51Google Scholar). Culture medium was removed every 2 days and replaced with fresh medium. Experiments were performed at a confluency corresponding to 20-30 × 106 cells. The medium was removed from 75-cm2 flasks, and 6 ml of leucine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's essential medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to each and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Cells were pulsed with 200 µCi of [3,4,5-3H]leucine (156 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN) for 3 h at 37°C in the presence or absence of brefeldin A (Sigma) at 10 µg/ml in the cell medium. For short-term pulse-chase, cells were washed three times with 10 ml of Hanks' solution after 15 min of pulse and chased in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1 mM unlabeled leucine. For the temperature experiments, the chase was carried out in a 20°C water bath. At various times, cells were harvested over ice in 2 N acetic acid containing 5 mM EDTA and EGTA and protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, aprotinin, bacitracin, bestatin, and pepstatin, each at 0.01%). Cells were detached with a cell scraper; and extracts were boiled for 10 min, sonicated, and centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was separated and lyophilized. The following antibodies were utilized for the immunoprecipitation studies: anti-pCC10, which recognizes prepro-TRH-(25-255) (26 kDa), prepro-TRH-(25-151) (15 kDa), and prepro-TRH-(25-74) (6 kDa); the C-terminal antibody anti-pYE17, which recognizes prepro-TRH-(25-255) (26 kDa), prepro-TRH-(115-255) (16.5 kDa), prepro-TRH-(160-255) (10 kDa), and prepro-TRH-(208-255) (5.4 kDa); and anti-pAC12, which recognizes prepro-TRH-(208-255) (5.4 kDa). Fig. 1 depicts the cryptic peptides within the pro-TRH molecule that are recognized by the various polyclonal antibodies. Immunoprecipitations were carried out essentially as described previously (1Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Jackson I.M.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1260-1270Google Scholar). Briefly, lyophilized cell extracts were resuspended in 500 µl of buffer A (10 mM NaPO4, pH 7.2, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100) and 25 µl of 2% bovine serum albumin. Samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was divided in two so that immunoprecipitations could be carried out with N- and C-terminal antibodies. Samples were incubated with 8 µl of primary antibody for 1 h at 37°C, followed by 24 h at 4°C. Goat anti-rabbit IgG (8 µl) was added to each sample along with 75 µl of buffer B (500 mM KCl, 50 mM NaH2PO4, pH 7.4, 5 mM NaEDTA, and 0.25% Triton X-100) and incubated for 4 h at 4°C. Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge for 30 min, and immunoprecipitates were washed twice with 300 µl of buffers B and C (10 mM phosphate buffer, pM 7.2, 150 mM NaCl), followed by resuspension in 120 µl of sample buffer (0.0625 M Tris, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 15% glycerol, and 15 mM dithiothreitol). Samples were boiled for 4 min prior to SDS-PAGE. Samples were loaded onto a 1.5-mm discontinuous Tricine-polyacrylamide gel, with 3% cross-linking (acrylamide/bisacrylamide solution) stacking gel and 6% cross-linking separating gel (31Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Google Scholar). Following electrophoresis, gels were cut into 2-mm slices in a gel slicer (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA), and proteins were extracted from gel slices by incubation in 0.5 ml of 2 N acetic acid for 3-4 days at 4°C. Scintillation fluid (Bio Safe II, RPI, Mount Prospect, IL) was added, and the samples were counted in a scintillation counter. Lyophilized samples were resuspended in 300 µl of sample buffer, centrifuged for 10 min in a microcentrifuge, and boiled for 4 min, followed by SDS-PAGE. Gel proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) overnight. The membrane was blocked in 50 ml of 2% nonfat dry milk overnight and washed three times with TTBS (20 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.5), and 8 µl of primary IgG was added in antibody buffer (TTBS and 1% nonfat dry milk) and incubated overnight at 4°C. The membrane was washed again three times with TTBS, and secondary goat anti-rabbit antibody was added in a 1:3000 dilution in antibody buffer. Enhanced chemiluminescence analysis was carried out using the Immun-Lite chemiluminescent kit according to the manufacturer's specifications (Bio-Rad). Cell content lysates and release media samples (1 ml each) from 6-well plates were centrifuged briefly to remove cell debris, and proteins were precipitated in a equal volume of 10% trichloroacetic acid. The supernatant was removed, and proteins were resuspended overnight in 200 µl of TS-2 tissue solubilizer (RPI) at 37°C. Resuspended protein was transferred to scintillation vials, 4 ml of scintillation fluid was added to each, and radioactivity was measured. Before studying the effects of the cellular blockades on the processing of pro-TRH, we wanted to determine the effectiveness of our blockades. The strategy was to pulse-chase AtT20 cells and see if the labeled proteins were prevented from reaching the last compartment of the secretory pathway, the SGs, when the chase was carried out in the presence of BFA or temperature blockades. We briefly pulsed transfected AtT20 cells with [3H]leucine for 15 min, followed by a chase with unlabeled leucine for 4 h under three different conditions: 37°C, 37°C with BFA, and 20°C to allow the labeled protein to travel to the SGs. We then induced the fusion of the SGs with the plasma membrane to release the stored proteins into the medium by incubating cells with the secretagogue PMA (phorbol 12-myristate ester) for 1 h and without PMA to measure the unstimulated or basal release. Radioactive protein released into the medium was measured after trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Protein released from the SGs was calculated by subtracting basal release protein levels (without PMA) from stimulated release protein levels (with PMA). Fig. 2 shows an inhibition of the amount of protein released into the medium from the SGs in BFA-treated cells and in temperature-blocked cells when compared with control cells. For BFA-treated cells, the protein levels appear as a negative number because basal release in these cells was higher than stimulated release. We conclude that the BFA and 20°C temperature conditions used in this study result in a blockade of protein transport through the secretory pathway of AtT20 cells. Based on our previously described pathway of pro-TRH processing and the proposed sites where PC1 and PC2 produced their endoproteolytic cleavages (14Nillni E.A. Friedman T.C. Todd R.B. Birch N.P. Loh Y.P. Jackson I.M.D. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 2462-2472Google Scholar, 15Friedman T.C. Loh Y.P. Huang S.S. Jackson I.M.D. Nillni E.A. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4462-4472Google Scholar, 16Nillni E.A. Luo L.G. Jackson I.M.D. McMillan P. Endocrinology. 1996; (in press)Google Scholar), the first cleavage of the 26-kDa precursor can occur at either of two sites to generate either a 15/10-kDa or a 9.5/16.5-kDa pair of N/C-terminal intermediates. This first set of alternative cleavages has been shown to occur prior to packaging into the SGs based on subcellular fractionation studies (20Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Jackson I.M.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1271-1277Google Scholar). Limitations in this approach prevent the assignment of this first cleavage to either the ER or the GC. To determine how much processing of the 26-kDa precursor if any occurs in the ER, we pulsed cells with [3H]leucine for 3 h to label pro-TRH and its intermediates, in the presence or absence of BFA to block the exit of proteins from the ER to the GC. Whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with anti-pCC10 antibodies specific for the intact 26-kDa precursor and N-terminal intermediates (see Fig. 1) (1Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Jackson I.M.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1260-1270Google Scholar), and immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE. We reasoned that if the pro-TRH precursor (26 kDa) was normally processed upon leaving the ER, blocking its exit from this compartment with BFA would prevent its processing and lead to an accumulation over control levels. Indeed, Fig. 3A shows a BFA-dependent accumulation of the 26-kDa precursor, suggesting that it is normally processed upon leaving the ER. In addition, the 15- and 9.5-kDa N-terminal intermediates produced in BFA-blocked cells accumulate ~4-fold over the levels seen in control cells, suggesting that further processing of these intermediates into smaller peptides occurs in a post-ER compartment (Fig. 3C). The increase in 26-kDa precursor levels was not due to an increase in protein synthesis in response to BFA because we did not observe an increase in the levels of trichloroacetic acid-precipitated material in the presence of BFA (data not shown). Fig. 3B shows the profile of pro-TRH intermediates from an identical experiment immunoprecipitated with anti-pYE17 antibodies, which detect the 26-kDa precursor along with other C-terminal intermediates (see Fig. 1). As shown above in Fig. 3A, the 26-kDa precursor accumulates in BFA-treated cells over control levels. The 16.5-kDa C-terminal intermediate is produced in BFA-blocked cells and accumulates 2-fold over control levels (Fig. 3C), suggesting that its processing to yield smaller intermediates also occurs in a post-ER compartment. The 10-kDa intermediate accumulates only slightly in BFA-blocked cells, suggesting that it might be further processed in the ER itself or is rapidly degraded as suggested in earlier studies (1Nillni E.A. Sevarino K.A. Jackson I.M.D. Endocrinology. 1993; 132: 1260-1270Google Scholar). Since the BFA data suggested that cleavage of the 26-kDa precursor occurred in a post-ER compartment, we wanted to determine if this compartment was the GC. We pulsed transfected AtT20 cells continuously with [3H]leucine at 20°C to prevent exit of proteins from the GC and checked the levels of the 26-kDa precursor after 1 and 3 h of labeling with anti-pYE17 antibodies. Fig. 4A shows the profile of pro-TRH immunoprecipitates from such an experiment. The level of the 26-kDa precursor did not change from 1 to 3 h, suggesting it had achieved a steady-state level where the rate of formation of the 26-kDa precursor equaled its rate of breakdown. Because the 26-kDa protein cannot exit the GC at 20°C, the amount produced between 1 and 3 h had to be broken down into smaller intermediates in the GC or in a previous compartment. When we repeated the experiment in the presence of BFA as shown in Fig. 4B, the 26-kDa precursor did not achieve steady-state levels and instead accumulated over time in the ER as it did at 37°C, suggesting that when its exit from the ER is blocked, the 26-kDa precursor is not processed. Thus, if the 26-kDa precursor is processed in a post-ER compartment and prior to packaging into the SGs, this compartment must be the Golgi complex, most likely the TGN, where other prohormones have been shown to be cleaved. Furthermore, these results show that the enzymes that process the 26-kDa precursor are still active at low temperatures. Having determined that the 26-kDa precursor is cleaved in the GC, we next wanted to determine the fate of its cleavage products, the 15/10-kDa and the 9.5/16.5-kDa intermediates. We were unable to detect the 10- and 9.5-kDa intermediates in sufficiently high amounts, probably due to their instability or rapid turnover, so our analysis was limited to the 15-kDa N-terminal and 16.5-kDa C-terminal peptides. To determine if these two intermediates were further processed in the GC, we used a 20°C incubation to block their exit from this compartment. Cells were pulsed with [3H]leucine for 4 h to label pro-TRH intermediates and chased for various times with unlabeled leucine before harvesting. Pro-TRH intermediates were immunoprecipitated with N- and C-terminal antibodies and separated by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 5A shows a 2-fold accumulation of the 15-kDa peptide at 20°C over control levels when its exit from the GC was blocked (Fig. 5C), suggesting that processing of the 15-kDa intermediate normally occurs in a post-Golgi compartment, i.e. the SGs. In contrast, Fig. 5B shows a time-dependent decrease of the 16.5-kDa intermediate at 20°C over control levels. This rapid processing suggests that this intermediate is normally processed in the GC prior to packaging into the SGs (Fig. 5C). It is possible that the 15-kDa intermediate is normally processed in the GC and that the accumulation observed at 20°C was not due to a blockade of the Golgi complex, but to an inhibition of the proconverting enzymes by the reduced temperature. To test this possibility, we wanted to see if the 15-kDa intermediate would also accumulate at 25°C, when the temperature is also low, but proteins can exit the GC into immature SGs. We reasoned that if the low temperature and not the blockade was responsible for the accumulation of the 15-kDa intermediate, then we might expect to see this accumulation at 25°C. Fig. 6 shows the N-terminal immunoprecipitates after a short-term pulse with [3H]leucine, followed by a 4-hour chase at different temperatures. The levels of the 15-kDa intermediate for the 25°C chase were identical to those at 37°C, while the levels at 20°C showed an accumulation of the 15-kDa intermediate. These results suggest that the accumulation of the 15-kDa N-terminal intermediate is not due to an inhibition of proconverting enzymes by low temperature, but is instead due to the inability of the 15-kDa intermediate to reach the SGs at 20°C, where it would normally be processed. It is interesting that the 16.5-kDa intermediate is processed faster at 20°C than at 37°C. This might be due to a parallel accumulation of processing enzymes in the TGN. We have shown that the 16.5-kDa C-terminal intermediate is further processed in the GC. Processing of this intermediate results in a 5.4-kDa C-terminal intermediate and a putative 9.5-kDa N-terminal intermediate (see Fig. 1). Thus, we expected that at 20°C, these peptides might accumulate. Because our antibodies were not raised against epitopes from the 9.5-kDa region of pro-TRH, our analysis was limited to the 5.4-kDa fragment. To check for accumulation of this intermediate at 20°C, we pulsed cells for 15 min in [3H]leucine and chased them with unlabeled leucine for 2 h. We immunoprecipitated cell content proteins with the C-terminal antibodies anti-pYE17, which recognizes the 26-, 16.5-, and 5.4-kDa intermediates, and anti-pAC12, which recognizes the 5.4-kDa cryptic peptide. Fig. 7 shows the peptide profile after a 2-h chase. The levels of the 16.5-kDa intermediate dropped at 20°C versus 37°C as shown earlier. In addition, we observed a marked accumulation of the 5.4-kDa peptide, produced from cleavage of the 16.5-kDa peptide. These results suggest that the 16.5-kDa intermediate is cleaved at the pair of basic residues 206 and 207 to yield a 5.4-kDa C-terminal product in the GC. We did not analyze what happens with the cryptic peptides. In the course of our experiments with BFA, we observed the appearance of a new peak never previously observed, corresponding to a protein of ~41 kDa. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), the levels of this protein ar"
https://openalex.org/W1985999142,"Cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) are required for cell cycle progression. Two potentially significant Cdk substrates in human cells are the human single-stranded binding protein (HSSB or RPA), which plays an essential role in DNA replication, repair, and recombination, and the tumor suppressor p107 which acts to negatively regulate cell growth. In this report we describe the in vitro phosphorylation of these two proteins by Cdks in an attempt to understand how cyclin-substrate interactions direct phosphorylation efficiencies. We show that cyclin A-Cdk2 efficiently phosphorylates the p34 subunit of HSSB (HSSB-p34) alone or as a part of the heterotrimeric complex. In contrast, cyclin E-Cdk2 that is active in phosphorylating histone H1, does not support the phosphorylation of the p34 subunit of HSSB. We provide evidence that this differential phosphorylation results from a specific interaction between HSSB-p34 and cyclin A, but not cyclin E. Thus the observed cell cycle-dependent phosphorylation of HSSB-p34 at the G1 to S transition is most likely catalyzed by cyclin A-Cdk2 initiated by the direct interaction between cyclin A and the HSSB-p34 subunit. These studies are consistent with our previous observation that p107, which directly binds cyclin A, is efficiently phosphorylated by cyclin A-Cdk2 but not cyclin B-associated kinases. Here we further demonstrate that cyclin A only complexes with p107 in its unphosphorylated form. These data suggest a catalytic mechanism by which Cdk acts: substrate targeting by a cyclin-substrate interaction followed by dissociation of the Cdk upon phosphate incorporation allowing the Cdk to become available for the next cycle of phosphorylation."

https://openalex.org/W2108033224,"The Escherichia coli K5 capsular polysaccharide has the same (GlcUA→GlcNAc)n structure as the nonsulfated heparan sulfate/heparin precursor polysaccharide. A monoclonal antibody (mAb 865) against the K5 polysaccharide has been described (Peters, H., Jürs, M., Jann, B., Jann, K., Timmis, K. N., and Bitter-Sauermann, D. (1985) Infect. Immun. 50, 459-466). In this report, we demonstrate the binding of anti-K5 mAb 865 to N-acetylated sequences in heparan sulfates and heparan sulfate proteoglycans but not to heparin. This is shown by direct binding and fluid phase inhibition of mAb 865 in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In this system we found that the binding of the mAb decreased with increasing sulfate content of the polysaccharide. By testing chemically modified K5 and heparin polysaccharides, we found that each of the modifications that occur during heparan sulfate (HS) synthesis (N-sulfation, C-5 epimerization, and O-sulfation) prevents recognition by mAb 865. Samples of heparan sulfate from human aorta (HS-II) were selectively degraded so as to allow the separate isolation of N-sulfated and N-acetylated block structures. N-Sulfated oligosaccharides (obtained after N-deacetylation by hydrazinolysis followed by nitrous acid deamination at pH 3.9) were not recognized by mAb 865, in contrast to N-acetylated oligosaccharides (obtained after nitrous acid deamination at pH 1.5), although the reactivity was lower than for intact HS-II. Analysis of the latter's pH 1.5 deamination products by gel filtration indicated that a minimal size of 18 saccharide units was necessary for antibody binding. These results lead us to propose bivalent antibody-heparan sulfate interaction, in which both F(ab) domains of the mAb interact with their epitopes, both of which are present in a single large (≥18 saccharide units) N-acetylated domain and additionally with single epitopes present in two N-acetylated sequences (each <18 saccharide units) bridged by a short N-sulfated domain. Immunohistochemistry with mAb 865 on cryostat sections of normal human kidney tissue, revealed its binding to most but not all renal basement membranes. However, all renal basement membranes contain heparan sulfate, as shown by a mAb against heparitinase-digested heparan sulfate stubs (mAb 3G10). This finding indicates that not all heparan sulfate chains present in basement membranes express the mAb 865 epitopes. Besides the normal distribution, mAb 865 staining was found in fibrotic and sclerotic lesions in vessels, interstitium, and mesangium in transplant kidneys with chronic vascular rejection. Occasionally, a decrease of staining was observed within tubulo-interstitium and glomeruli.

INTRODUCTIONThe biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS) 1The abbreviations used are: HSheparan sulfate(s)ELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayHSPGheparan sulfate proteoglycan(s)mAbmonoclonal antibodyPBSphosphate-buffered saline. involves the formation of a nonsulfated (GlcUAβ1,4→GlcNAcα1,4)n precursor polysaccharide N-acetylheparosan, which subsequently undergoes a series of polymer modification reactions. These reactions start with N-deacetylation/N-sulfation of GlcNAc residues, which is followed by C-5 epimerization of GlcUA to IdceA units, and finally by O-sulfation at various positions (1Lindahl U. Lidholt K. Spillmann D. Kjellán L. Thromb. Res. 1994; 75: 1-32Google Scholar). The GlcUA C-5 epimerization and O-sulfation reactions occur in the close vicinity of N-sulfate groups, pointing to a key role for the glucosaminyl N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase enzyme in determining the overall extent of modification of the HS chain. Structural analysis of HS from various sources has revealed that these modifications tend to colocalize in block sequences, separated by relatively unmodified domains (2Schmidt A. Lemming G. Yoshida K. Buddecke E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 322-328Google Scholar, 3Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11208-11215Google Scholar, 4Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T.

Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1244: 104-112Google Scholar). The extent of biosynthetic modification, affecting the number, length, and substitution patterns of the modified domains as well as their position along the HS chain, may differ among cell types (7Kato M. Wang H. Bernfield M. Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18881-18890Google Scholar), alter during proliferation (8Schmidt A. Buddecke E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 52: 229-235Google Scholar), and change as a result of cell transformation (9Pejler G. David G. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 69-77Google Scholar, 10Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2690-2699Google Scholar).Many biological activities of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are due to interactions between the HS polysaccharide side chains and a variety of proteins such as extracellular matrix molecules, enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, growth factors, and other cytokines (1Lindahl U. Lidholt K. Spillmann D. Kjellán L. Thromb. Res. 1994; 75: 1-32Google Scholar, 11Jackson R.L. Busch S.J. Cardin A.D. Phys. Rev. 1991; 71: 481-539Google Scholar, 12Kjellán L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev.

These interactions can be either specific, dependent on defined sulfation patterns within given sequences of sugar residues, as described for antithrombin (14Lindahl U. Thunberg L. Backstrom G. Riesenfeld J. Nordling K. Bjork I. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12368-12376Google Scholar), basic fibroblast growth factor (15Turnbull J.E. Fernig D.G. Ke Y. Wilkinson M.C. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol.

J. 1995; 310: 497-505Google Scholar); or they can be mainly based on relatively nonspecific electrostatic interactions and involve proteins such as lipoprotein lipase (19Parthasarathy N. Goldberg I.J. Sivaram P. Mulloy B. Flory D.M. Wagner W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22391-22396Google Scholar), platelet factor 4 (20Maccarana M. Lindahl U. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 271-277Google Scholar) and mast cell protease I (21Pejler G. Maccarana M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14451-14456Google Scholar) (see Ref. 22Spillmann D. Lindahl U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 677-682Google Scholar for a general discussion).Structural analysis of HS is complicated by the fact that even highly purified and uniform preparations consist of mixtures of polysaccharide chains that have reached different levels of modification. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that specifically recognize well-defined epitopes in HS could be major tools in such analysis. Already in 1985 a mAb (designated as mAb 865) against the Escherichia coli K5 polysaccharide had been described (23Peters H. Jürs M. Jann B. Jann K. Timmis K.N. Bitter-Suermann D. Infect. Immun. 1985; 50: 459-466Google Scholar). This bacterial polysaccharide has the same (GlcUAβ1,4→GlcNAcα1,4)n structure as the nonsulfated HS/heparin precursor polysaccharide (24Vann W.F. Schmidt M.A. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 359-364Google Scholar), suggesting that anti-K5 mAb 865 might recognize the N-acetylated (K5-like) domains in HS. In the present report, we show that this is indeed the case. Immunohistological application of the mAb on normal human renal tissue and on transplant kidneys with chronic vascular rejection revealed these N-acetylated HS sequences in extracellular matrix and basement membranes. Since in most protein-HS interactions highly sulfated, IdceA-rich domains are involved, the possible biological significance of these relatively unmodified N-acetylated domains in HS is discussed.DISCUSSIONThe present study deals with the recognition of HS by mAb 865, which is directed against the E. coli K5 bacterial polysaccharide, of which the generation and basic characteristics were described previously (23Peters H. Jürs M. Jann B. Jann K. Timmis K.N. Bitter-Suermann D. Infect. Immun. 1985; 50: 459-466Google Scholar). Based on the following findings we concluded that the epitope in HS recognized by mAb 865 was located in the (relatively) unmodified N-acetylated domains of HS. (i) Chemical modification of K5 and heparin, yielding K5-related derivatives that are N-sulfated, C-5 epimerized to produce L-IdceA units, or O-sulfated completely prevented antibody recognition. (ii) The binding of mAb 865 to HS/heparin decreases with increasing sulfate contents of the polysaccharide. (iii) N-acetylated oligosaccharides obtained after deamination (pH 1.5) of HS-II were still recognized by mAb 865, whereas the corresponding N-sulfated oligosaccharides were devoid of antibody binding. While these results do not rule out the occurrence of occasional O-sulfate groups or IdceA units in the N-acetylated regions recognized by the antibody, it is recalled that the GlcUA C-5 epimerization and O-sulfation reactions are restricted to the close vicinity of N-sulfate groups (1Lindahl U. Lidholt K. Spillmann D. Kjellán L. Thromb. Res. 1994; 75: 1-32Google Scholar).Oligosaccharides obtained by deamination (at pH 1.5) of HS are recognized by mAb 865 but only provided that they contain ≥18 saccharide units, thus suggesting a requirement for bivalent antibody binding. Assuming that one sugar residue is ~6 Å in length, an oligosaccharide of 20 residues (which gives maximal interaction with mAb 865) would be ~120 Å. This value agrees with the calculated distance between both Fab arms of an immunoglobulin molecule (39Klein J. Immunology: The Science of Self-Nonself Discrimination. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1982: 156Google Scholar). Simultaneous binding of both F(ab) antibody domains will strongly promote the interaction. It is noteworthy that a comparable type of bivalent binding has been described recently for the interaction of interferon-γ dimer with HS (18Lortat-Jacob H. Turnbull J.E. Grimaud J-A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 497-505Google Scholar). In this elegant study it was shown that the high affinity binding domain for interferon-γ in HS is composed of two terminal N-sulfated domains, linked together by an intervening N-acetylated domain. The interferon-γ dimer bound to both N-sulfated terminal regions, while a monovalent interferon-γ-HS interaction was insufficient for stable binding. Our finding that deamination at pH 1.5 results in partial loss of antibody recognition suggests that in native HS, not only the large N-acetylated domains (≥18 saccharide units) but also smaller N-acetylated sequences bridged by a short N-sulfated domain, are recognized by mAb 865. Cleavage of the HS polysaccharide at N-sulfated glucosamine residues (deamination at pH 1.5) thus abolishes bivalent antibody recognition of such small N-acetylated sequences. Alternatively, the extended minimal polymer size of 18 saccharide units needed for antibody recognition might be explained by assuming a conformational epitope. For example, in a helical polymer structure, a much longer primary sequence will be required for the maintenance of a conformational epitope.Immunofluorescence studies on human kidney sections with mAb 865 revealed that the carbohydrate epitope is not evenly distributed among the HS subspecies of this tissue. All basement membranes, as expected, were found to contain HS, as evidenced by the anti-HS stub mAb 3G10. However, the polysaccharide present in some tubular basement membranes stained poorly with mAb 865, suggesting the existence of HS isoforms lacking the corresponding epitope. The most likely explanation for this is the existence of a high sulfated HS isoform in these particular tubular basement membranes. This is supported by the finding that another anti-HS mAb (JM-403), which recognizes epitopes with N-unsubstituted glucosamine units in low sulfated HS isoforms (37van den Born J. Gunnarsson K. Bakker M.A.H. Kjellán L. Kusche-Gullberg M. Maccarana M. Berden J.H.M. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31303-31309Google Scholar), shows the same staining pattern. Alternatively, the N-acetylated domains may be inappropriately spaced for antibody binding. Staining with mAb 865 was also observed in mild fibrosis and sclerosis, which is found in normal renal tissue, secondary to aging. This led us to the analysis of renal tissue with more extensive fibrosis. To this end we evaluated renal transplant biopsies with chronic vascular rejection. In these biopsies, fibrotic and sclerotic lesions were positive for both anti-HS stub mAb 3G10 and for mAb 865. This increased staining, however, is not specific for vascular chronic rejection, since preliminary experiments in our laboratory indicated that also in experimental models of renal diseases (Adriamycin nephropathy and active Heymann glomerulonephritis), fibrotic areas clearly express the mAb 865 epitope. 2C. J. I. Raats and J. van den Born, unpublished observations. Using anti-K5 mAb 865 as a probe to detect HS, our findings indicate that HS in these fibrotic/sclerotic areas represents a low sulfated HS isoform. We suggest that these HS chains are attached to perlecan, since anti-perlecan core protein mAbs also stain renal fibrotic/sclerotic areas (40Sharma A.K. Mauer S.M. Kim Y. Michael A.F. Kidney Int. 1993; 44: 774-788Google Scholar), and mAb 865 binds to perlecan in ELISA (Fig. 1, C and D).What is the biological significance of these N-acetylated domains in HS? As indicated in the Introduction, many growth factors, enzymes, and enzyme inhibitors can bind to HS. Generally such interactions involve variously sulfated regions along the polysaccharide chain; so far no proteins have been shown to specifically interact with the N-acetylated domains in HS. Nevertheless, N-acetylated sequences in HS have been implicated in a variety of biologically important processes. Thus, N-acetylated oligosaccharides isolated after nitrous acid deamination of HS from bovine lung were found to be more effective inhibitors of mesangial cell proliferation than either the intact polymer or highly sulfated oligosaccharides from the same source (41Groggel G.C.

Moreover, it has been shown that HS fragments obtained after digestion with heparinase (yielding low sulfated GlcUA- and GlcNAc-rich oligosaccharides) inhibited endothelial cell proliferation induced by acidic fibroblast growth factor, in contrast to HS fragments obtained after digestion with heparitinase (yielding high sulfated IdceA-rich oligosaccharides) (42Gordon P.B. Choi H.U. Conn G. Ahmed A. Ehrmann B. Rosenberg L. Hatcher V.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 140: 584-592Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported that small K5 fragments and N-acetylated oligosaccharides derived from HS inhibited normal angiogenesis (43Hahnenberger R. Jakobson A.M. Ansari A. Wehler T. Svahn C.M. Lindahl U. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 567-573Google Scholar). These data indicate that mAb 865-positive HS present in the extracellular matrix may represent a pool of immobilized precursors of antiproliferative and antiangiogenic oligosaccharides. It has been demonstrated that biologically active oligosaccharides may be released from the matrix by the action of various endoglycosidases (44Vlodavsky I. Bar-Shavit R. Ishai-Michaeli R. Bashkin P. Fuks Z. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 268-271Google Scholar, 45Matzner Y. Bar-Ner M. Yahalom J. Ishai-Michaeli R. Fuks Z. Vlodavsky I. J. Clin.

A. 1995; 92: 5037-5041Google Scholar). While the substrate specificities of these enzymes have not yet been elucidated in detail, it has been suggested that certain enzyme species may preferentially cleave nonsulfated regions in the HS chain (49Nakajima M. Irimura T. Di Ferrante N. Nicolson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2283-2290Google Scholar), whereas others require sulfate groups for substrate recognition (50Oldberg A. Heldin C-H. Wasteson A. Busch C. Hüük M. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5755-5762Google Scholar, 51Oosta G.M. Favreau L.V. Beeler D.L. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11249-11255Google Scholar, 52Thunberg L. Bäckstrüm G. Wasteson A. Robinson H.C. Ogren S. Lindahl U. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10278-10282Google Scholar). We thus may envisage an elaborate system of distinct bioactive oligosaccharides, generated by the action of endoglycosidases on HS substrates composed of sulfated and nonsulfated regions. INTRODUCTIONThe biosynthesis of heparan sulfate (HS) 1The abbreviations used are: HSheparan sulfate(s)ELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayHSPGheparan sulfate proteoglycan(s)mAbmonoclonal antibodyPBSphosphate-buffered saline. involves the formation of a nonsulfated (GlcUAβ1,4→GlcNAcα1,4)n precursor polysaccharide N-acetylheparosan, which subsequently undergoes a series of polymer modification reactions. These reactions start with N-deacetylation/N-sulfation of GlcNAc residues, which is followed by C-5 epimerization of GlcUA to IdceA units, and finally by O-sulfation at various positions (1Lindahl U. Lidholt K. Spillmann D. Kjellán L. Thromb. Res. 1994; 75: 1-32Google Scholar). The GlcUA C-5 epimerization and O-sulfation reactions occur in the close vicinity of N-sulfate groups, pointing to a key role for the glucosaminyl N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase enzyme in determining the overall extent of modification of the HS chain. Structural analysis of HS from various sources has revealed that these modifications tend to colocalize in block sequences, separated by relatively unmodified domains (2Schmidt A. Lemming G. Yoshida K. Buddecke E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 59: 322-328Google Scholar, 3Lyon M. Deakin J.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11208-11215Google Scholar, 4Turnbull J.E. Gallagher J.T.

Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1244: 104-112Google Scholar). The extent of biosynthetic modification, affecting the number, length, and substitution patterns of the modified domains as well as their position along the HS chain, may differ among cell types (7Kato M. Wang H. Bernfield M. Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18881-18890Google Scholar), alter during proliferation (8Schmidt A. Buddecke E. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 52: 229-235Google Scholar), and change as a result of cell transformation (9Pejler G. David G. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 69-77Google Scholar, 10Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2690-2699Google Scholar).Many biological activities of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) are due to interactions between the HS polysaccharide side chains and a variety of proteins such as extracellular matrix molecules, enzymes, enzyme inhibitors, growth factors, and other cytokines (1Lindahl U. Lidholt K. Spillmann D. Kjellán L. Thromb. Res. 1994; 75: 1-32Google Scholar, 11Jackson R.L. Busch S.J. Cardin A.D. Phys. Rev. 1991; 71: 481-539Google Scholar, 12Kjellán L. Lindahl U. Annu. Rev.

These interactions can be either specific, dependent on defined sulfation patterns within given sequences of sugar residues, as described for antithrombin (14Lindahl U. Thunberg L. Backstrom G. Riesenfeld J. Nordling K. Bjork I. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 12368-12376Google Scholar), basic fibroblast growth factor (15Turnbull J.E. Fernig D.G. Ke Y. Wilkinson M.C. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol.

J. 1995; 310: 497-505Google Scholar); or they can be mainly based on relatively nonspecific electrostatic interactions and involve proteins such as lipoprotein lipase (19Parthasarathy N. Goldberg I.J. Sivaram P. Mulloy B. Flory D.M. Wagner W.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22391-22396Google Scholar), platelet factor 4 (20Maccarana M. Lindahl U. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 271-277Google Scholar) and mast cell protease I (21Pejler G. Maccarana M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14451-14456Google Scholar) (see Ref. 22Spillmann D. Lindahl U. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1994; 4: 677-682Google Scholar for a general discussion).Structural analysis of HS is complicated by the fact that even highly purified and uniform preparations consist of mixtures of polysaccharide chains that have reached different levels of modification. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that specifically recognize well-defined epitopes in HS could be major tools in such analysis. Already in 1985 a mAb (designated as mAb 865) against the Escherichia coli K5 polysaccharide had been described (23Peters H. Jürs M. Jann B. Jann K. Timmis K.N. Bitter-Suermann D. Infect. Immun. 1985; 50: 459-466Google Scholar). This bacterial polysaccharide has the same (GlcUAβ1,4→GlcNAcα1,4)n structure as the nonsulfated HS/heparin precursor polysaccharide (24Vann W.F. Schmidt M.A. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 359-364Google Scholar), suggesting that anti-K5 mAb 865 might recognize the N-acetylated (K5-like) domains in HS. In the present report, we show that this is indeed the case. Immunohistological application of the mAb on normal human renal tissue and on transplant kidneys with chronic vascular rejection revealed these N-acetylated HS sequences in extracellular matrix and basement membranes. Since in most protein-HS interactions highly sulfated, IdceA-rich domains are involved, the possible biological significance of these relatively unmodified N-acetylated domains in HS is discussed."

We have addressed this issue with respect to the neurotrophic molecule ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF). Administration of CNTF in vivo resulted in modest decreases in levels of CNTFRα mRNA and protein in skeletal muscle. CNTF causes the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of LIFRβ and gp130 and the induction of the immediate-early gene, tis11; injection of CNTF 3-7 h after an initial exposure failed to re-stimulate these immediate-early responses, suggesting a biochemical desensitization to CNTF not accounted for by decreased receptor protein. To determine whether the desensitization of immediate-early responses caused by CNTF resulted in a functional desensitization, we compared the efficacy of multiple daily injections versus a single daily dose of CNTF in preventing the denervation-induced atrophy of skeletal muscle. Surprisingly, injections of CNTF every 6 h, which falls within the putative refractory period for biochemical responses, resulted in efficacy equal to or greater than injections once daily. These results suggest that although much of the CNTF signal transduction machinery is down-regulated with frequent CNTF dosing, biological signals continue to be recognized and interpreted by the cell.

Yancopoulos G.D. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1992; 4: 139-155Google Scholar). Studies on the physiological properties of CNTF in these culture systems have provided insights into the pharmacological potential of this factor in vivo. For example, motor neurons express CNTF receptors (2Ip N. McClain J. Barrezueta N.X. Aldrich T.H. Pan L. Li Y. Wiegand S.J. Friedman B. Davis S. Yancopoulos G.D. Neuron. 1993; 10: 89-102Google Scholar) and retrogradely accumulate 125I-CNTF (3Curtis R. Adryan K.M. Zhu Y. Harkness P.J. Lindsay R.M. DiStefano P.S. Nature. 1993; 365: 253-255Google Scholar) in a receptor-mediated fashion. Accordingly, CNTF prevents motor neuron cell death and ameliorates neuromuscular deficits in wobbler and pmn mutant mice, both models of motor neuron disease (4Mitsumoto H. Ikeda K. Klinkosz B. Cedarbaum J.M. Wong V. Lindsay R.M. Science. 1994; 265: 1107-1110Google Scholar, 5Sendtner M. Schmalbruch H. Stückli K.A. Carroll P. Kreutzberg G.W. Thoenen H. Nature. 1992; 358: 502-504Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, CNTF prevents the axotomy-induced retrograde neuronal death of anterior thalamic neurons (6Clatterbuck R.E. Price D.L. Koliatsos V.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2222-2226Google Scholar) and of neurons in the substantia nigra (7Hagg T. Quon D. Higaki J. Varon S. Neuron. 1992; 8: 145-158Google Scholar). Although CNTF receptors are highly localized in nervous tissues (2Ip N. McClain J. Barrezueta N.X. Aldrich T.H. Pan L. Li Y. Wiegand S.J. Friedman B. Davis S. Yancopoulos G.D. Neuron. 1993; 10: 89-102Google Scholar), receptor expression has also been characterized in many nonneuronal tissues (8MacLennan A.J. Gaskin A.A. Lado D.C. Mol.

Abstr. 1994; 20: 42Google Scholar), suggesting a wider spectrum of action of this factor in vivo than was initially thought. Most prominently, functional CNTF receptors have been localized to skeletal muscle, and CNTF displays trophic activity on denervated muscle (10Helgren M.E. Squinto S.P. Davis H.L. Parry D.J. Boulton T.G. Heck C.S. Zhu Y. Yancopoulos G.D. Lindsay R.M. DiStefano P.S. Cell. 1994; 76: 493-504Google Scholar).

The functional receptor for CNTF exists as a tripartite complex consisting of CNTFRα, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein, and two β components termed leukemia inhibitory factor receptor-β (LIFRβ) and gp130 (11Davis S. Aldrich T.H. Stahl N. Pan L. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Ip N.Y. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1993; 260: 1805-1808Google Scholar, 12Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1993; 74: 587-590Google Scholar). These β components are also necessary receptor subunits for LIF, oncostatin M, interleukin-6, and cardiotrophin-1 (13Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. J.

The binding of CNTF to CNTFRα results in the stepwise recruitment of gp130 and LIFRβ on the cell surface, forming a high affinity complex capable of initiating signal transduction cascades (13Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 1454-1466Google Scholar). Unlike the receptor tyrosine kinase class of receptors, formation of the CNTF receptor complex results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the β subunits by the Jak/Tyk family of cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that are constitutively associated with the β subunits (18Stahl N. Boulton T.G. Farruggella T. Ip N.Y. Davis S. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Ihle J.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1994; 263: 92-95Google Scholar). In addition, autophosphorylation of Jak occurs on distinct tyrosine residues. Specific tyrosine phosphate residues on the β subunits and the Jaks serve as docking sites for certain SH2 domain-containing proteins, the combinations of which may dictate responsiveness to various growth and trophic factors (18Stahl N. Boulton T.G. Farruggella T. Ip N.Y. Davis S. Witthuhn B.A. Quelle F.W. Silvennoinen O. Barbieri G. Pellegrini S. Ihle J.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Science. 1994; 263: 92-95Google Scholar). Immediate-early signal transduction pathways in response to CNTF proceed via activation of the MAP kinase pathway, as well as by activation of the STAT family of cytosolic transcriptional activators (see Ref. 19Curtis R. DiStefano P.S. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 383-386Google Scholar). This, in turn, results in the induction of immediate-early genes such as tis11 and c-fos, which have been shown to contain in their 5′-untranslated regions a CNTF response element, which most likely represents a STAT response element (20Bonni A. Frank D.A. Schindler C. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 262: 1575-1579Google Scholar). These signal transduction cascades have been well established in various CNTF-responsive cells in vitro (21Ip N.Y. Nye S.H. Boulton T.G. Davis S. Taga T. Li Y. Birren S.J. Yasukawa K. Kishimoto T. Anderson D.J. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1121-1132Google Scholar), and we have shown recently that CNTF administration in vivo results in the phosphorylation of gp130/LIFRβ and induction of tis11 in a number of CNTFRα-bearing tissues, including skeletal muscle, dorsal root ganglia, peripheral nerve, adrenal, and heart tissues (9DiStefano P.S. Stark J. Adryan K.M. Curtis R. Farruggella T. Stahl N. Lindsay R.M. Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 1994; 20: 42Google Scholar, 10Helgren M.E. Squinto S.P. Davis H.L. Parry D.J. Boulton T.G. Heck C.S. Zhu Y. Yancopoulos G.D. Lindsay R.M. DiStefano P.S. Cell. 1994; 76: 493-504Google Scholar). The potent survival-promoting and neuroprotective actions of trophic factors have stimulated considerable interest in their potential as therapeutic agents in neurological disorders such as trauma, neurodegeneration, and muscle disease (22Lindsay R.M. Wiegand S.J. Altar C.A. DiStefano P.S. Trends Neurosci. 1994; 17: 182-190Google Scholar). To achieve maximal benefit from such molecules, it becomes important to determine their optimal dose as well as their optimal dose frequency. Although ligand-induced down-regulation of receptors is a common feature of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and certain polypeptide growth factors, less is known about the extent to which repeated or chronic administration of polypeptide growth factors may induce desensitization of their signal transduction pathways and/or the downstream functional sequelae. In the present study we have addressed several critical questions regarding the administration of pharmacological doses of CNTF in vivo. First, does CNTF cause decreased expression of CNTFRα mRNA or protein in responsive tissues? Second, are immediate-early cellular responses (tyrosine phosphorylation or tis11 induction) also desensitized or down-regulated with repeated administration of CNTF? Third, is there cross-desensitization between CNTF and related cytokines, such as LIF? Fourth and most importantly, is down-regulation of receptor or of signal transduction cascades associated with a functional desensitization to repeated administration of the factor? We show here that CNTF administration results in decreased levels of CNTF receptor, and repeated frequent administration results in reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of receptor components and induction of tis11. To assess whether these events are associated with a functional desensitization to CNTF, we examined the ability of multiple, frequent doses of CNTF to prevent the denervation-induced atrophy of skeletal muscle, a property of CNTF established previously in our laboratory (10Helgren M.E. Squinto S.P. Davis H.L. Parry D.J. Boulton T.G. Heck C.S. Zhu Y. Yancopoulos G.D. Lindsay R.M. DiStefano P.S. Cell. 1994; 76: 493-504Google Scholar). We show that despite down-regulation of the CNTF receptor and its signal transduction cascades, repeated frequent administration of CNTF resulted in no functional desensitization to this factor, establishing a non-equivalence between biochemical desensitization and pharmacological activity of CNTF in vivo. These studies suggest a model whereby tissues maintain their responsiveness to a given factor by adjusting the intracellular “gain” to increased or persistent extracellular signals. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250-300 g were housed two per cage, given food and water ad libitum, and maintained on a 12-h light-dark cycle. Recombinant human CNTF (referred to as CNTF henceforth) was formulated in 10 mM phosphate, 12 mM lactate, 5% mannitol, pH 4.5. Recombinant human LIF (generously provided by Dr. J. A. Miller, Amgen) was supplied in phosphate-buffered saline. To examine in vivo signal transduction events, animals were injected with lactate/phosphate/mannitol vehicle, CNTF, or LIF at doses ranging from 0.1-1.0 mg/kg. In all experimental paradigms, CNTF, LIF, and vehicle solutions were administered subcutaneously. It was determined previously that tyrosine phosphorylation and tis11 induction peaked 45 and 60 min, respectively, after a subcutaneous dose of CNTF (10Helgren M.E. Squinto S.P. Davis H.L. Parry D.J. Boulton T.G. Heck C.S. Zhu Y. Yancopoulos G.D. Lindsay R.M. DiStefano P.S. Cell. 1994; 76: 493-504Google Scholar). Therefore, rats were sacrificed 52 min after the injection, and skeletal muscle (soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL)) and other tissues were rapidly dissected; routinely, total RNA was prepared from the right muscle, and the left muscle was used for gp130/LIFRβ tyrosine phosphorylation analysis. In some experiments, animals received sciatic nerve transections 24 h prior to CNTF administration to determine the effect of denervation on immediate-early responses to CNTF. To assess possible refractory periods for phosphorylation or tis11 induction after repeated doses of CNTF, the following experimental paradigm was adopted. Rats were administered a pre-dose of either vehicle or CNTF, followed 1-48 h later by a test dose of CNTF. The doses of CNTF used were either 0.1 or 1.0 mg/kg. Fifty-two min after the test dose, animals were sacrificed and the muscles or lumbar 1-6 dorsal root ganglia (L1-L6 DRG) were processed for immediate-early responses as described above (see also Fig. 3). For cross-desensitization experiments, LIF (0.1 mg/kg) was also included in the pre-dose and test dose paradigm. For controls, pre-dose injections of vehicle were made 5 h prior to the test dose. Soleus muscles or L1-L6 DRG were homogenized in 4 M guanidine containing 5%β-mercaptoethanol, and total RNA was prepared by the method of Chomszynski and Sacchi (23Chomszynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). Ten µg of total RNA was separated on 1% formaldehyde gels and transferred to nylon membranes. Membranes were hybridized with 32P-labeled cDNA probes for rat CNTFRα or tis11 as described (2Ip N. McClain J. Barrezueta N.X. Aldrich T.H. Pan L. Li Y. Wiegand S.J. Friedman B. Davis S.

CNTF was radioiodinated to a specific activity of ~2000 cpm/fmol as described previously (3Curtis R. Adryan K.M. Zhu Y. Harkness P.J. Lindsay R.M. DiStefano P.S. Nature. 1993; 365: 253-255Google Scholar). Muscles from rats treated with CNTF were homogenized with a polytron in 10 volumes of phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 µg/ml aprotinin and 1 mM PMSF. Samples were centrifuged 1,000 × g for 10 min and the resulting supernatants were centrifuged 100,000 × g for 20 min in a Beckman ultracentrifuge (model TL100). The resulting pellets were resuspended in the homogenization buffer and 200 µl aliquots of membranes (containing equal protein concentrations) were incubated with 4 nM 125I-CNTF in the presence or absence of a 200-fold excess of unlabeled rat CNTF to determine specific binding. After binding for 1.5 h on ice, the cross-linking agent disuccinimidyl suberate (200 µM) was added to each tube for 30 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was quenched by adding 1 ml of 20 mM Tris, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4, for 15 min on ice. Samples were clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min. Pellets were resuspended in the Tris/NaCl quenching buffer and 370 milliunits of phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (Sigma) were added to each sample for 30 min at 37°C to cleave the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored CNTFRα from membranes. Samples were clarified by ultracentrifugation and the supernatants were incubated overnight at 4°C with 25 µg of recombinant gp130-IgG produced in baculovirus. 2T. E. Ryan, unpublished data. 125I-CNTF-CNTFRα-gp130-IgG complexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose and pellets were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline/0.2% Tween-20. Samples were resolved on 7.5% acrylamide SDS gels and 125I-CNTF-cross-linked species were visualized autoradiographically using Kodak BioMax MR film. Immunoprecipitations and antiphosphotyrosine immunoblots for gp130/LIFRβ/Jak complexes were performed essentially as described (10Helgren M.E. Squinto S.P. Davis H.L. Parry D.J. Boulton T.G.

Autoradiographic bands from Northern blots, Western blots, or cross-linking experiments were quantified using an LKB (Uppsala, Sweden) laser densitometer (model XL) interfaced with the GelScan XL program (LKB) to integrate area under the curve for individual bands. In instances in which band intensities were beyond the linear range of detection, band intensities from multiple exposures were analyzed to determine relative band intensities. In vivo responses to CNTF were assessed by monitoring the degree to which CNTF prevented the denervation-induced atrophy of soleus muscle. Briefly, animals were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine/xylazine (50/10 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) and a 5-mm segment of the right sciatic nerve was resected at the level of the knee. The left side was sham operated. Animals were administered vehicle or CNTF (0.1-0.3 mg/kg) either once daily or four times daily every 6 h for 4 days. The animals were sacrificed, the muscles were weighed, and the ratios of right:left muscle weights were determined for each animal. The percent rescue of muscle weight was also calculated based on wet weight ratios, using the following formula: Treatmentratio- Mean Vehicleratio/1 - Mean Vehicleratio. Differences between treatment groups were compared using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Dunnett's post hoc test. All animal use in this study was conducted in compliance with approved institutional animal care and use protocols and according to NIH guidelines (52NIH, (1985) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, NIH Publication No. 86-23.Google Scholar). A series of experiments was carried out to determine whether administration of CNTF caused down-regulation of CNTFRα mRNA and protein in vivo. Given that CNTFRα mRNA is dramatically up-regulated in skeletal muscle within 24 h after denervation, we examined the ability of CNTF to regulate its own receptor expression both in normal and in denervated muscles. Rats were injected once daily with 1.0 mg/kg CNTF for 1, 4, or 7 days, and the steady state levels of CNTFRα mRNA were determined in soleus and EDL muscles. A single injection of CNTF resulted in significant down-regulation of CNTFRα mRNA expression in both soleus and EDL muscles 24 h later (Fig. 1, A and B). When rats were injected daily for 4 or 7 days, the down-regulation of receptor was maintained. This was apparent in normal, as well as in denervated, muscles (Fig. 1, A and B). Fig. 1, C and D, shows the quantification of CNTFRα mRNA down-regulation in response to daily CNTF administration. The results are from multiple experiments and include data for soleus and EDL muscles. With the exception of 1 day after sciatic nerve lesion, steady state expression of CNTFRα was significantly reduced to approximately 50% of control throughout the treatment period (p < 0.05, ANOVA). Further investigation revealed that a single injection of CNTF resulted in decreased CNTFRα mRNA as early as 1 h after injection (not shown). In addition, two injections placed 5 h apart resulted in a significant reduction (65%) in mRNA (Fig. 1E). In situ hybridization studies in muscle confirmed the down-regulation of CNTFRα mRNA by CNTF treatment (data not shown). We next used a 125I-CNTF cross-linking method to estimate relative levels of CNTFRα protein on skeletal muscle membranes after daily exposure to CNTF. Fig. 2A shows that this cross-linking assay was specific for CNTFRα because 1) the band comigrated with the known molecular mass (~100 kDa) for the CNTF-CNTFRα complex (25Stahl N. Davis S. Wong V. Taga T. Kishimoto T. Ip N.Y. Yancopoulos G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7628-7631Google Scholar); 2) cross-linking was blocked by a 200-fold excess of unlabeled CNTF; 3) omitting the phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C step or the gp130-IgG incubation resulted in no signal; and 4) a recombinant CNTFRα (with a slightly higher molecular mass) competed for cross-linking of 125I-CNTF to muscle membrane CNTFRα (not shown). As with CNTFRα mRNA, CNTF induced a down-regulation of CNTFRα protein reproducibly, although the time course was much more protracted and the magnitude of the response was not as great (Fig. 2, B and C). Denervation resulted in a steady increase in 125I-CNTF cross-linked to CNTFRα, reaching 4-fold by 7 days (Fig. 2, A-C). Significant down-regulation (35-40% reduction) was observed only after 7 days of treatment in normal muscle, and receptor was decreased by 40 and 15% after 1 or 7 days, respectively, in denervated soleus muscle. Similar quantitative results were observed with EDL and gastrocnemius muscles. We also tested whether three injections of CNTF, placed 5 h apart, would result in decreased CNTFRα, as determined by 125I-CNTF cross-linking to muscle membranes. This treatment resulted in modest decreases of only 20% in normal muscles (not shown). This contrasts with the substantial down-regulation of CNTFRα mRNA with short-interval, repeated dosing (Fig. 1E). We have previously shown that subcutaneous administration of CNTF results in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of LIFRβ, gp130, and Jak kinase in skeletal muscle (10Helgren M.E. Squinto S.P. Davis H.L. Parry D.J. Boulton T.G. Heck C.S. Zhu Y. Yancopoulos G.D. Lindsay R.M. DiStefano P.S. Cell. 1994; 76: 493-504Google Scholar). This effect peaks at 45 min and returns to baseline 2-3 h postinjection. Shortly after the onset of tyrosine phosphorylation, the immediate-early gene tis11 is induced, peaking at 1 h and extinguishing by ~4 h. The half-life of CNTF is short, and doses of 0.1-1.0 mg/kg are cleared from the plasma by 2-4 h. Experiments were undertaken to determine whether repeated doses of CNTF, administered at different time intervals, resulted in down-regulation (desensitization) of these immediate-early responses in skeletal muscle. Rats were administered a pre-dose of either vehicle or CNTF (1.0 mg/kg), followed 1, 3, 5, 7, 24, or 48 h later by a test dose of CNTF (see “Materials and Methods” and Fig. 3). Consistent with previous studies, administration of CNTF resulted in increased tyrosine phosphorylation of LIFRβ and gp130 52 min after the injection (Fig. 4). Performing this experiment in rats whose muscles were denervated by sciatic nerve transection resulted in generally heightened responses. If the animals were injected with CNTF prior to the test dose (and sacrificed at 52 min), there was a marked diminution of the response to the test dose. This was slightly evident at the 1-h interval, and with 3-, 5-, and 7-h intervals the response was greatly diminished. It is important to note that tyrosine phosphorylation of receptor components in this paradigm never reached the background levels observed in vehicle-treated rats. When the dosing interval was spaced 24 or 48 h apart there was no desensitization, indicating that the apparent refractory period for this response was between 7 and 24 h. We next determined whether a similar pattern of desensitization was observed for tis11 induction using the same pre-dose/test dose paradigm outlined in Fig. 3. Using a dose of 1.0 mg/kg CNTF, tis11 was induced 20-fold in normal soleus muscle, and prior denervation resulted in a 40-fold induction (Fig. 5). As with tyrosine phosphorylation experiments, administration of CNTF at 1, 3, 5, or 7 h prior to the test dose caused a progressive failure of CNTF to elicit increased tis11 responses. Furthermore, the response returned to its maximum when the interval between doses was 24-48 h. Quantification of this response in normal and denervated muscles is represented in Fig. 6. It is once again important to note that even though the desensitization of the tis11 response is quite substantial, it was never reduced to levels observed in vehicle-treated animals and was routinely 2.5 ± 0.4-fold above background (p < 0.05; n = 3). Similar quantitative results were obtained from densitometric analysis of tyrosine phosphorylation experiments (not shown). We then estimated the dose of CNTF necessary to elicit these small increments (2.5-fold) in receptor tyrosine phosphorylation or tis11 induction to correlate this with the levels of CNTF that might be encountered by tissues under physiological conditions. Therefore, we performed a dose-response test with CNTF in normal and sciatic nerve-transected rats. Fig. 7 shows that a dose of 0.01 mg/kg caused a discernible induction of tis11 in normal rats and that doses of 0.001-0.01 mg/kg were effective in previously denervated muscle; the maximal activation of tis11 was also greater in muscles that had been denervated 24 h prior to injection (Fig. 6, Fig. 7). From the results presented thus far there are at least two possible mechanisms by which desensitization might arise. First, the fact that administration of CNTF results in down-regulation of receptor mRNA and protein suggests that the desensitization mechanism lies at the level of the cell surface receptor. Second, it is possible that other downstream regulatory events are involved. To address the latter possibility, we performed cross-desensitization experiments with LIF and CNTF, using the pre-dose/test dose paradigm (Fig. 3) with tis11 induction as the readout. We took advantage of the fact that LIF also uses components of the CNTF receptor complex, namely LIFRβ and gp130, but does not bind to CNTFRα. In addition, LIF and other related factors activate signal transduction cascades similar to those elicited by CNTF (21Ip N.Y. Nye S.H. Boulton T.G. Davis S. Taga T. Li Y. Birren S.J. Yasukawa K. Kishimoto T. Anderson D.J. Stahl N. Yancopoulos G.D. Cell. 1992; 69: 1121-1132Google Scholar). Using DRG as the responsive tissue, it was found that a pre-dose of LIF (0.1 mg/kg, 4 h earlier) resulted in biochemical desensitization to a test dose of CNTF (0.1 mg/kg). However, the inverse was not true in that tissues preexposed to CNTF were not refractory to a test dose of LIF (Fig. 8A). Similar results were observed in soleus muscle (Fig. 8B). Therefore, mechanisms downstream from the receptor may be involved in the biochemical desensitization with repeated administration of CNTF. Given that CNTF treatment caused down-regulation of CNTFRα and marked desensitization of immediate-early signal transduction responses, we sought to determine whether this resulted in a functional desensitization to CNTF. To assess this, we tested various dosing regimens on the ability of CNTF to prevent the denervation-induced atrophy of skeletal muscle. We have previously shown that treatment of rats daily with doses of CNTF (0.03-1.0 mg/kg) partially prevents this atrophy (10Helgren M.E. Squinto S.P. Davis H.L. Parry D.J. Boulton T.G. Heck C.S. Zhu Y. Yancopoulos G.D. Lindsay R.M. DiStefano P.S. Cell. 1994; 76: 493-504Google Scholar). To best approximate conditions that would down-regulate CNTF receptor and induce desensitization to immediate-early responses, rats were treated with vehicle or CNTF (0.1 or 0.3 mg/kg) every 6 h for 4 days; for comparison, other groups were treated once daily for 4 days. Rats whose muscles were denervated for 4 days showed a 30% reduction of wet weight, and once-daily dosing with 0.3 mg/kg CNTF resulted in only a 15-20% reduction in weight, or a rescue of 30% (Fig. 9, A and B). Surprisingly, treatment of rats with CNTF every 6 h resulted in equal or slightly greater efficacy on sparing of muscle wet weight (and a wet weight rescue of 50%) compared to those animals treated once daily (Fig. 9, A and B). It is worth noting that the muscle wet weight sparing effect was not the result of a single exposure to CNTF because discontinuation of the CNTF treatment resulted in a loss of the efficacy (0.70 ± 0.03 versus 0.73 ± 0.05; p = 0.6). Therefore, signals elicited by frequent injections of CNTF are critical to the efficacy, even though certain signal trans"

Previous studies suggested that the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIIAα was not required for FcγRIIIAα-ζ association or signaling by FcγRIIIA. However, in these studies, the truncated FcγRIIIAα chains still expressed the four most membrane-proximal amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail (amino acids 230-233). By successive truncations from the C terminus of FcγRIIIAα, we have studied the role played by the membrane-proximal amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIIAα in (i) FcγRIIIA expression, (ii) FcγRIIIAα-ζ association, and (iii) signal transduction. We provide evidence that this region is not required for FcγRIIIA expression or FcγRIIIAα-ζ association. However, signaling by FcγRIIIA is strictly dependent on the membrane-proximal amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIIAα. Thus, total deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIIAα results in a severely impaired tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase C-γ1, zap, and syk and rise in intracellular free Ca2+ following receptor ligation with specific anti-CD16 monoclonal antibody or Ig-anti-Ig complexes, suggesting that FcγRIIIAα-ζ association per se is not sufficient to establish the signal function of FcγRIIIA.

Natural killer (NK) cells are cytotoxic for target cells coated with IgG antibodies. This property is referred to as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and is mediated through binding to target-bound IgG by the low affinity FcR for IgG expressed at the NK cell surface. Two distinct forms of the human low affinity FcR for IgG, FcγRIIIA and FcγRIIIB, have been identified (1Ravetch J.V. Perussia B. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 481-497Google Scholar). FcγRIIIA, which is found on NK cells and macrophages, is a transmembrane protein complex, whereas the form expressed on neutrophils, FcγRIIIB, is anchored to the outer plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety (1Ravetch J.V. Perussia B. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 481-497Google Scholar). FcγRIIIA, the T cell receptor (TCR), and the B cell receptor (BCR) have many structural and functional features in common. Like TCR and BCR complexes, FcγRIIIA exist as multimeric receptor complexes composed of the ligand-binding FcγRIIIAα (CD16) chain noncovalently associated with various disulfide-linked subunits (2Anderson P. Caligiuri M. Ritz J. Schlossman S.F. Nature. 1989; 341: 159-162Google Scholar, 3Lanier L.L. Yu G. Phillips J.H. Nature. 1989; 342: 803-805Google Scholar, 4Lanier L.L. Yu G. Phillips J.H. J.

The associated chains are defined as a family of disulfide-linked dimers (6Orloff D.G. Ra C. Frank S.J. Klausner R.D. Kinet J.-P. Nature. 1990; 347: 189-191Google Scholar), which are closely related and can substitute for each other (7Howard F.D. Rodewald H.-R. Kinet J.-P. Reinherz E.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, all of these dimers can form part of the TCR complex (8Koyasu S. D'Adamio L. Arulanandam A.R.N. Abrham S. Clayton L.K. Reinherz E.L. J. Exp.

In addition to structural similarities, there are significant similarities between the signaling pathways coupled to FcγRIIIA, the TCR, and the BCR, respectively. Thus, ligation of each of these receptors induces tyrosine phosphorylation of several substrates including phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) (14O'Shea J.J. Weissman A.M. Kennedy I.C.S. Ortaldo J.R. Proc.

The precise pathway by which receptor engagement initiates these events is not fully known, although src family kinases, the zap/syk kinases, and the tyrosine-containing activation motif (TAM) in the cytoplasmic tail of the associated subunits, all play important roles (reviewed in Ref. 20Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Google Scholar). Previous studies suggested that the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIIAα might not be required for signaling by FcγRIIIA (21Wirthmueller U. Kurosaki T. Murakami M.S. Ravetch J.V. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1381-1390Google Scholar, 22Bonnerot C. Amigorena S. Choquet D. Pavlovich R. Choukroun V. Fridman W.H.

In all of these studies, however, the truncated FcγRIIIAα chains still expressed the four most membrane-proximal amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail. Thus, it remained unknown whether the membrane-proximal amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIIAα also play a role in signal transduction following FcγRIIIA ligation. Although chimeric receptor molecules containing the extracellular part of FcγRIIIAα and the cytoplasmic domain of subunits with TAM are effective signal transducers when cross-linked by extracellular ligands (24Romeo C. Armiot M. Seed B. Cell. 1992; 68: 889-897Google Scholar, 25Kolanus W. Romeo C. Seed B. Cell. 1993; 74: 171-183Google Scholar), it is possible that the cytoplasmic tail of the ligand binding subunit in intact receptors plays a role in signaling, as recently demonstrated for the BCR (26Pleiman C.M. Chien N.C. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2837-2844Google Scholar). In this study, we show that signaling by FcγRIIIA following stimulation with specific anti-CD16 mAb or immune complexes is strictly dependent on the membrane-proximal amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIIAα. In contrast, this region is not required for FcγRIIIAα-ζ association and cell surface expression. JGN cells, a TCR cell surface negative variant of the human T cell line Jurkat that synthesize no CD3γ (27Geisler C. J.

In all constructs, a guanosine instead of a thymidine was found at position 559 (resulting in a valine instead of a phenylalanine at amino acid position 176 in the extracellular domain). Accordingly, two independent samples of the original FcγRIII-2 plasmid (kindly donated by Dr. J. V. Ravetch) were sequenced and in both samples the base at position 559 was found to be a guanosine and not a thymidine as previously published. These results indicated that position 559 in FcγRIIIAα might be polymorphic in the population or that a variation had been introduced into position 559 as a result of propagation of the plasmids. 2J. V. Ravetch, personal communication. The last possibility seems less likely as identical sequencing results were obtained from two independent plasmids. The constructs were transfected into JGN cells using the Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at a setting of 270 V and 960 µF with 40 µg of plasmid per 2 × 107 cells. After 3-4 weeks of selection, G418-resistant clones were expanded and maintained in medium without G418. FACS analyses were performed as described previously on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson) (31Dietrich J. Neisig A. Hou X. Wegener A.K. Gajhede M. Geisler C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 299-310Google Scholar). [Ca2+]i of cells was measured with the intracellular fluorescent indicator fura-2/AM (Sigma). Fura-2/AM was added to a 1-ml cell suspension (4 × 106 cells) in complete medium to a final concentration of 2.5 µM. After a 20-min incubation at room temperature, cells were washed twice and resuspended in 2 ml of assay buffer (115 mM NaCl, 4.6 mM KCl, 2.5 mM CaCl2, 1.5 mM KH2PO4, 1.5 mM MgSO4, 24 mM NaHCO3, and 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4). Fluorescence measurements were performed using FLDM software in a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B luminescence spectrometer (Emeryville, CA) equipped with a thermostatic cuvette holder maintained at room temperature with continuous stirring. The ratio of fura-2/AM fluorescence at 340 nm to that at 380 nm was recorded in real time and expressed in arbitrary units. To initiate calcium mobilization, anti-CD16 or F101.01 mAb was added at time 50 s. At time 300 s, F(ab)2 fragments of RAM Ig or intact RAM Ig was added. Ionophore-Ca2+ salt (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany) was added at time 500 s as a receptor independent control. The background values of the samples were determined first and subtracted from the values obtained in the stimulation assay. At least two independent clones of each transfectant were analyzed. Cells were surface-iodinated as described previously (28Geisler C. Plesner T. Pallesen G. Skjodt K. Odum N. Larsen J.K. Scand. J. Immunol. 1988; 27: 685-696Google Scholar, 34Hou X. Dietrich J. Kuhlmann J. Wegener A.K. Geisler C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1228-1233Google Scholar) and solubilized for 45 min at 4°C in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 8 mM iodoacetamide, and 1% digitonin (Sigma)). For immunoprecipitation, precleared lysate was incubated with 1.0 µg of mAb for 2 h at 4°C. Protein A-Sepharose (PA) was added and the incubation continued for 2 h. The immunoprecipitates were washed five times in lysis buffer, boiled for 5 min with sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol), and subjected to SDS-PAGE on 10% acrylamide gels under nonreducing conditions. Autoradiography of the dried gels was performed by using Hyperfilm-MP (Amersham Laboratories, Amersham, UK). 14C-Labeled proteins from Amersham were used as molecular weight markers. For Western blotting, 5 × 106 cells in 1 ml of RPMI medium were stimulated with the anti-CD16 mAb 3G8 plus F(ab)2 fragments of RAM Ig, F101.01 plus intact RAM Ig, or PBS at 37°C for 2 min. The pelleted cells were lysed in modified RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mM NaCl, and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5) containing phosphatase and protease inhibitors (1 mM vanadate, 2 mM EDTA, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The postnuclear fractions were precleared by incubation with PA at 4°C for 30 min and precipitated with the indicated mAb for 2 h at 4°C. PA beads were added and the incubation continued for 2 h. Beads were washed four times in modified RIPA buffer without phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The immunoprecipitates were eluted with sample buffer plus 2% 2-mercaptoethanol by boiling for 5 min, separated by 8-10% SDS-PAGE, and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-ECL, Amersham) as described previously (35Wegener A.-M.K. Hou X. Dietrich J. Geisler C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4675-4680Google Scholar). The membranes were blocked in 3% skim milk, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.5% Tween 20 in PBS and incubated with the indicated primary mAb. Washing, incubation with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and visualization of the proteins by the enhanced chemiluminescence technique were performed as described previously (35Wegener A.-M.K. Hou X. Dietrich J. Geisler C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4675-4680Google Scholar). At least two independent clones of each transfectant were analyzed. Conflicting results have been presented concerning the role of the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIIAα in the assembly of FcγRIIIAα and ζ/γ. One report suggested that both the transmembrane region and the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIIAα were involved in the interaction with γ (11Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1989; 342: 805-807Google Scholar), whereas another report found that the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIIAα was dispensable for FcγRIIIAα-ζ association (4Lanier L.L. Yu G. Phillips J.H. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1571-1576Google Scholar). However, in both reports, the truncated FcγRIIIAα chains studied contained the four most membrane-proximal amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail. To our knowledge, the role of these amino acids for FcγRIIIAα-ζ association and function has not been described previously. To analyze the role of the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIIAα for FcγRIIIAα-ζ complex formation and function in stable transfectants, stop codons were inserted in FcγRIIIAα cDNA corresponding to residues 242, 234, 233, 232, 231, and 230 resulting in truncated FcγRIIIAα chains designated Fcγt242, -t234, -t233, -t232, -t231, and -t230, respectively (Fig. 1A) (FcγRIIIAα residue numbering according to Ref. 1Ravetch J.V. Perussia B. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 481-497Google Scholar). To avoid any possible interference in signaling by the TCR, these constructs were transfected into the TCR cell surface negative Jurkat variant JGN (27Geisler C. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 2437-2445Google Scholar). G418-resistant clones were isolated and analyzed for cell surface expression of FcγRIIIAα. All of the truncated FcγRIIIAα chains were expressed at the surface of JGN with comparable intensity as the wild-type FcγRIIIAα as determined by FACS analyses using CLB/FcRgran1, 3G8, or Leu-11c mAb (Fig. 1B). Several studies have demonstrated the requirement of the ζ/γ subunits for signaling through FcγRIIIAα (21Wirthmueller U. Kurosaki T. Murakami M.S. Ravetch J.V. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1381-1390Google Scholar, 22Bonnerot C. Amigorena S. Choquet D. Pavlovich R. Choukroun V. Fridman W.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2747-2757Google Scholar, 23Daeron M. Malbec O. Bonnerot C. Latour S. Segal D.M. Fridman W.H. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 783-792Google Scholar). It was therefore important to analyze whether the truncated FcγRIIIAα chains expressed at the cell surface were associated with the ζ chain. The ζ chain is poorly labeled by cell surface iodination; however, it should be possible to detect FcγRIIIAα-ζ association by coprecipitation-labeled FcγRIIIAα with anti-ζ mAb. Accordingly, cells were surface radioiodinated, lysed in 1% digitonin lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitated with anti-CD16 mAb CLB/FcRgran1, anti-ζ mAb, or PBS. The precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Precipitates obtained with the anti-CD16 mAb clearly demonstrated the presence of the FcγRIIIAα in all of the transfectants (Fig. 2). The FcγRIIIAα chains moved as a broad band with a molecular mass between 50 and 70 kDa for FcγWT and a molecular mass between 40 and 60 kDa for the truncated FcγRIIIAα chains. As expected, the ζ band was only weakly seen in the precipitates from all transfectants. However, most importantly, anti-ζ mAb clearly coprecipitated the FcγRIIIAα chain from all transfectants with comparable intensities (Fig. 2). The ability of FcγRIIIA containing truncated FcγRIIIAα chains to mediate a rise in [Ca2+]i following stimulation with the specific anti-CD16 mAb 3G8, was next studied. As shown in Fig. 3B, 3G8 induced a rapid but weak rise in [Ca2+]i in JGN cells transfected with FcγWT. This response was further potentiated following cross-linking with F(ab)2 fragments of RAM Ig (Fig. 3B). As expected, no detectable rise in [Ca2+]i was observed in the FcγRIIIA negative parent cell line, JGN (Fig. 3A). In contrast to JGN-FcγWT cells, none of the transfectants expressing truncated FcγRIIIAα chains showed a rise in [Ca2+]i following stimulation with 3G8 alone. Following optimal stimulation by cross-linking with RAM Ig, a rise in [Ca2+]i in JGN-Fcγt242 and JGN-Fcγt234 cells was seen equal to the one observed for JGN-FcγWT cells. However, further truncation resulted in an impaired rise in [Ca2+]i (Fig. 3) suggesting that the most membrane-proximal amino acids were required for an efficient rise in [Ca2+]i. Indeed, cells expressing FcγRIIIAα lacking all of the amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail were nearly unable to respond to optimal stimulation (Fig. 3H). Similar results were obtained following stimulation of the transfectants with Ig-anti-Ig complexes. Whereas the rise in [Ca2+]i was comparable for JGN-FcγWT, JGN-Fcγt242, and JGN-Fcγt234 cells, truncations from residue 233 to 230 resulted in a progressive weakening of the response following treatment with Ig-anti-Ig complexes (Fig. 4).Fig. 4[Ca2+]i measurements. Cells were treated with F101.01 (anti-TCR) mAb at 50 s and subsequently with RAM Ig at 300 s. In one experiment, JGN-FcγWT cells were treated with RAM Ig at 50 s (B, thin line). The ratio of fura-2/AM fluorescence at 340 nm to that at 380 nm was recorded and is given in arbitrary units (ordinate). The abscissa gives the time in seconds. Ionophore-Ca2+ salt was added at 500 s in all experiments. The cell line analyzed is given in the upper left corner of each histogram.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) One of the earliest signaling events following FcγRIIIA ligation is tyrosine phosphorylation of several cytoplasmic substrates including the ζ subunit (14O'Shea J.J. Weissman A.M. Kennedy I.C.S. Ortaldo J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 350-354Google Scholar). To analyze the role of the FcγRIIIAα tail in receptor-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation, JGN-FcγWT and JGN-Fcγt230 cells were treated with either cross-linked anti-CD16 mAb (3G8), Ig-anti-Ig complexes, or PBS for 2 min at 37°C prior to lysation and immunoprecipitation with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 coupled to agarose beads. The precipitates were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed in Western blotting with 4G10 (Fig. 5A). Treatment with cross-linked anti-CD16 mAb or Ig-anti-Ig complexes resulted in tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins in both JGN-FcγWT and JGN-Fcγt230 cells. Although no significant qualitative differences were observed in the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins from the two cell lines, significant quantitative differences were seen. Most strikingly, the ζ chain and two unidentified proteins with a molecular mass of approximately 40 and 55-60 kDa became only weakly phosphorylated in JGN-Fcγt230 cells as compared with the corresponding proteins in JGN-FcγWT cells, suggesting that some of the tyrosine kinases activated by engagement of wild-type FcγRIIIA were not as efficiently (or not at all) activated by engagement of FcγRIIIA containing the tail-less FcγRIIIAα chain. As deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIIAα resulted in a severe impairment of the rise in [Ca2+]i following receptor engagement, it was of interest to analyze whether truncation of the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIIAα influenced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1. Accordingly, PLC-γ1 was immunoprecipitated from JGN-FcγWT and JGN-Fcγt230 cells treated with cross-linked anti-CD16 mAb (3G8), Ig-anti-Ig complexes, or PBS for 2 min at 37°C, and the immunoreactive material was analyzed in Western blotting with the anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 (Fig. 5B, upper panel). A tyrosine-phosphorylated protein with a molecular mass of 145-150 kDa was detected only in the PLC-γ1 immunoprecipitates from JGN-FcγWT cells treated with cross-linked anti-CD16 mAb or with Ig-anti-Ig complexes. Using anti-PLC-γ1 antibodies as blotting reagents, a single band was detected, at similar levels in all anti-PLC-γ1 immunoprecipitates, corresponding to a protein with a molecular mass identical to that of the phosphoprotein, confirming the identification of the tyrosine-phosphorylated protein with PLC-γ, and excluding that the lack of its detection with the anti-phosphotyrosine mAb in the precipitates from JGN-Fcγt230 cells was due to its absence from these precipitates (Fig. 5B, lower panel). These results strongly suggested that deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIIAα disturbed the coupling of the receptor to protein tyrosine phosphorylation events involving the phosphorylation of ζ and PLC-γ1. Since the known components of FcγRIIIA lack intrinsic kinase activity, this indicated that the association and/or activation of non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases involved in FcγRIIIA signaling is dependent on the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIIAα. It has been demonstrated that stimulation of FcγRIIIA induces an increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases zap and syk (16Vivier E. da Silva A.J. Ackerly M. Levine H. Rudd C.E. Anderson P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 1872-1876Google Scholar, 17Stahls A. Liwszyc G.E. Couture C. Mustelin T. Andersson L.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2491-2496Google Scholar). Accordingly, zap and syk were immunoprecipitated from JGN-FcγWT and JGN-Fcγt230 cells treated with cross-linked anti-CD16 mAb (3G8), Ig-anti-Ig complexes, or PBS for 2 min at 37°C, and the immunoreactive material was analyzed in Western blotting with the anti-phosphotyrosine mAb 4G10 (Fig. 6). zap from JGN-FcγWT cells became strongly phosphorylated whereas zap from JGN-Fcγt230 cells became only weakly phosphorylated following stimulation with cross-linked anti-CD16 mAb or Ig-anti-Ig complexes (Fig. 6A). Likewise, syk from JGN-FcγWT cells became strongly phosphorylated whereas syk from JGN-Fcγt230 cells became only weakly phosphorylated following stimulation with cross-linked anti-CD16 mAb or Ig-anti-Ig complexes (Fig. 6B). In addition, phosphorylated ζ was clearly coprecipitated with syk in JGN-FcγWT cells following stimulation with cross-linked anti-CD16 mAb or Ig-anti-Ig complexes but was only weakly coprecipitated with syk from JGN-Fcγt230 cells following stimulation with cross-linked anti-CD16 mAb. It has previously been shown that truncated FcγRIIIAα with only the four most membrane-proximal amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail left allows surface expression and signaling through FcγRIIIA (21Wirthmueller U. Kurosaki T. Murakami M.S. Ravetch J.V. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 175: 1381-1390Google Scholar, 22Bonnerot C. Amigorena S. Choquet D. Pavlovich R. Choukroun V. Fridman W.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2747-2757Google Scholar, 23Daeron M. Malbec O. Bonnerot C. Latour S. Segal D.M. Fridman W.H. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 783-792Google Scholar). Our results are in agreement with these results. More importantly, we have extended these studies by demonstrating that further truncations of the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIIAα still allow FγRIIIAα-ζ association and expression but severely affect the signaling capacity of FcγRIIIA. At first sight, our results might seem controversial as it has generally been believed that the short cytoplasmic tails of the ligand binding subunits of FcR, TCR, and BCR were not involved in signal transduction. However, our findings that the membrane-proximal part of the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIIAα is important for FcγRIIIA signaling are not unprecedented. Thus, a similar important role in signal transduction by the BCR has been described for the short cytoplasmic tail of membrane-bound IgM (mIgM). Point mutation of one of the three amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail of mIgM completely abrogated antigen-induced signal transduction by the BCR (26Pleiman C.M. Chien N.C. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 2837-2844Google Scholar). Several possibilities for the role of the membrane-proximal amino acids of the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIIAα may be suggested. The cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIIAα may be directly involved in association with non-receptor protein-tyrosine kinases e.g. syk. syk is found in association with FcγRIIIA (17Stahls A. Liwszyc G.E. Couture C. Mustelin T. Andersson L.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 2491-2496Google Scholar), FcϵRI (36Hutchcroft J.E. Geahlen R.L. Deanin G.G. Oliver J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9107-9111Google Scholar), the BCR (37Hutchcroft J.E. Harrison M.L. Geahlen R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8613-8619Google Scholar), and the TCR (38Chan A.C. van Oers N.S. Tran A. Turka L. Law C.L. Ryan J.C. Clark E.A. Weiss A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4758-4766Google Scholar). In B cells, syk may associate with the BCR by two different mechanisms: syk may be bound to the resting BCR via the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of mIg, and syk may be bound to the tyrosine-phosphorylated TAM of the Ig α and β chains of the activated BCR via its SH2 domains (39Pleiman C.M. D'Ambrosio D. Cambier J.C. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 393-399Google Scholar). Likewise, in T cells there is evidence that syk is constitutively bound to the resting TCR by a still unidentified mechanism (40Couture C. Baier G. Altman A. Mustelin T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5301-5305Google Scholar) and that syk associates with the tyrosine-phosphorylated TAM of the ζ chain of the activated TCR via its SH2 domains (38Chan A.C. van Oers N.S. Tran A. Turka L. Law C.L. Ryan J.C. Clark E.A. Weiss A. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4758-4766Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that syk binds to FcγRIIIA via the transmembrane and membrane-proximal part of the FcγRIIIAα chain. Alternatively, the transmembrane and membrane-proximal part of the FcγRIIIAα chain might be indirectly involved in the association with syk or other protein-tyrosine kinases via a third unidentified molecule. An alternative but not mutually exclusive explanation might be that the membrane-proximal part of the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIIAα in response to ligand binding induces conformational changes in the ζ chain promoting optimal binding and/or function of the TAM-associated kinases. Thus, this model implies that the membrane-proximal part of the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIIAα is involved in transfer of information from the ligand binding subunit to subunits involved in downstream signaling. CD45 has been found to associate with FcγRIIIA at the cell surface (41Altin J.G. Pagler E.B. Kinnear B.F. Warren H.S. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1994; 72: 87-96Google Scholar). CD45 is a phosphotyrosine phosphatase that is crucial for the normal function of T and B cells and presumably other leukocytes as well (42Koretzky G.A. Picus J. Thomas M.L. Weiss A. Nature. 1990; 346: 66-68Google Scholar, 43Koretzky G.A. Picus J. Schultz T. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2037-2041Google Scholar, 44Koretzky G.A. Kohmetscher M.A. Kadleck T. Weiss A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1138-1142Google Scholar, 45Justement L.B. Brown V.K. Lin J. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 399-406Google Scholar). In the absence of CD45, the rapid TCR-triggered tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins normally seen is severely reduced resulting in impaired activation of PLC and rise in [Ca2+]i (42Koretzky G.A. Picus J. Thomas M.L. Weiss A. Nature. 1990; 346: 66-68Google Scholar, 43Koretzky G.A. Picus J. Schultz T. Weiss A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2037-2041Google Scholar, 44Koretzky G.A. Kohmetscher M.A. Kadleck T. Weiss A. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1138-1142Google Scholar). One mechanism by which CD45 seems to regulate these events is by regulating src family protein-tyrosine kinases including lck (reviewed in Ref. 46Mustelin T. Burn P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 215-220Google Scholar). A third role of the membrane-proximal part of the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIIAα could be to contribute to the association between FcγRIIIA and CD45 and thereby indirectly to regulate lck. The roles of the membrane-proximal part of the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIIAα proposed above appear to be inconsistent with the finding that receptor chimeras containing the cytoplasmic tail of ζ/γ (22Bonnerot C. Amigorena S. Choquet D. Pavlovich R. Choukroun V. Fridman W.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2747-2757Google Scholar, 23Daeron M. Malbec O. Bonnerot C. Latour S. Segal D.M. Fridman W.H. J.

Chem. 1994; 269: 6491-6497Google Scholar) are effective signal transducers when cross-linked by mAb. It is, however, possible that cross-linking of such chimeric receptor molecules allows a closer “nonphysiological” contact of their cytoplasmic tails than cross-linking of the ligand binding subunits of intact receptors does. A closer contact of the TAM in chimeric receptors could facilitate activation of protein-tyrosine kinases constitutively bound to the TAM (51van Oers N.S. Tao W. Watts J.D. Johnson P. Aebersold R. Teh H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5771-5780Google Scholar). Clearly, further studies are necessary to resolve the role of the cytoplasmic tail of FcγRIIIAα in signal transduction. We thank Dr. J.

In T4 coliphage infection the two enzymes are found in dNTP synthetase, a multienzyme complex for deoxyribonucleotide biosynthesis. Protein-protein interactions involving the phage-coded forms of these two enzymes have been explored in three experiments that use the respective purified protein as an affinity ligand. First, an extract of radiolabeled T4 proteins was passed through a column of immobilized enzyme (either dTMP synthase or dCMP deaminase), and the specifically bound proteins were identified. Second, two mutant form of dCMP deaminase (H90N and H94N), altered in presumed zinc-binding sites, were analyzed similarly, with the results suggesting that some, but not all, interactions require normal structure near the catalytic site. Third, affinity chromatography using either enzyme as the immobilized ligand, revealed interactions between the two purified enzymes in the absence of other proteins. In these experiments we noted a significant effect of dCTP, an allosteric modifier of dCMP deaminase, upon the interactions.

Protein-protein interactions involving the phage-coded forms of these two enzymes have been explored in three experiments that use the respective purified protein as an affinity ligand. First, an extract of radiolabeled T4 proteins was passed through a column of immobilized enzyme (either dTMP synthase or dCMP deaminase), and the specifically bound proteins were identified. Second, two mutant form of dCMP deaminase (H90N and H94N), altered in presumed zinc-binding sites, were analyzed similarly, with the results suggesting that some, but not all, interactions require normal structure near the catalytic site. Third, affinity chromatography using either enzyme as the immobilized ligand, revealed interactions between the two purified enzymes in the absence of other proteins. In these experiments we noted a significant effect of dCTP, an allosteric modifier of dCMP deaminase, upon the interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2013290339,"A previously unidentified endogenous substrate for protein -isoaspartyl methyltransferase in mammalian brain has been characterized and partially purified. This high mass methyl-accepting protein (HMAP) is concentrated in rat brain cytosol and is not detectable in rat liver, heart, lung, kidney, or skeletal muscle. HMAP is acidic and heterogeneous in size, with an average mass, as judged by size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography, greater than 700 kDa. After partial purification from cow brain by anion-exchange chromatography, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and gel filtration, HMAP could accept 12.1 nmol of methyl groups per mg of protein, suggesting that it contains a level of isoaspartate at least 50 times greater than that of the average protein in brain cytosol. Partially purified HMAP is degraded by trypsin, verifying that it is composed, at least in part, of protein. Additional studies on this unusual macromolecule may shed important new light on mechanisms of isoaspartate formation in cells and the molecular pathology of brain aging.

Formation of atypical β-linked isopeptide bonds at Asp-X and Asn-X sequences is emerging as a major source of spontaneous protein damage under physiological conditions (1Brennan T.V. Clarke S.

Formation of isoaspartate occurs when the α-nitrogen of the C-flanking amino acid (X) attacks the side-chain carbonyl of an Asp or Asn residue, resulting in the formation of a succinimide intermediate. The succinimide subsequently hydrolyzes to produce a mixture typically composed of 15-30% aspartate in a normal α-linkage and 60-85% aspartate in an abnormal β-linkage (isoAsp). Asp-X and Asn-X sequences both make significant contributions to isoAsp formation during in vitro aging of purified proteins. This reaction can account for the observation that internal Asn residues tend to deamidate more rapidly under mild conditions than internal Gln residues (5Robinson A.B. Rudd C.J. Curr. Top. Cell.

PIMT-dependent methylation of isoAsp sites with [methyl-3H]AdoMet also provides a convenient assay for quantitating levels of isoAsp in peptides and proteins (13Johnson B.A. Aswad D.W. Anal.

Brain is one of the richest sources of PIMT in mammalian tissues (14Diliberto Jr., E.J. Axelrod J. J. Neurochem. 1976; 26: 1159-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 15Kim S. Paik W.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 252: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In a recent study on formation of isoAsp in rat brain tubulin (16Najbauer J. Orpiszewski J. Aswad D.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5183-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we noted the presence of a high mass methyl-acceptor (>200 kDa) that was labeled extensively when brain cytosol was incubated in the presence of [methyl-3H]AdoMet. Initial experiments suggested that the methylation of this molecule was not dependent on the addition of purified PIMT, implying that it might be a substrate for a different methyltransferase. We observed, however, that methylation of this molecule was partially reversed by exposure to mildly alkaline conditions, a characteristic of many isoAsp methyl esters. In the present work, we provide direct evidence that this methyl acceptor, now termed HMAP (high mass methyl-accepting protein) is a specific and highly effective substrate for PIMT, and, moreover, that it is selectively enriched in brain cytosol. A partial purification and characterization of HMAP from cow brain is also presented. S-Adenosyl–[methyl-3H]methionine, 15 Ci/mmol, was obtained from DuPont NEN and adjusted to lower specific activity by dilution with purified unlabeled AdoMet (Sigma). Recombinant rat PIMT (type I isoform) was isolated and purified to homogeneity as described previously (17David C.L. Aswad D.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The specific activity of PIMT was 9000 units/mg, where a unit is defined as 1 pmol of methyl transferred per min to bovine γ-globulins (5 mg/ml) at pH 6.2, 30°C. The normal and isoAsp-5 forms of δ-sleep-inducing peptide (DSIP; Trp-Ala-Gly-Gly-Asp-Ala-Ser-Gly-Glu) were obtained from Bachem Bioscience, Inc. Trypsin (type XIII) was obtained from Sigma. Leupeptin was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim. Immediately after decapitation, the brains of male Sprague-Dawley rats (7-8 weeks of age) were excised and homogenized at 4°C in 4 volumes of fractionation buffer using six strokes of a Teflon-glass homogenizer rotating at approximately 300 rpm. Fractionation buffer consisted of 10% (w/w) sucrose dissolved in PEMPL buffer (5 m sodium PIPES, pH 7.0, 2 m EDTA, 7 m 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 m phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.9 mg/ml leupeptin). Subsequent procedures were all carried out at 2-4°C. The homogenate was filtered through cheesecloth, then centrifuged at 800 × g for 20 min to produce a crude nuclear fraction (P1). The first supernatant (S1) was centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 20 min to produce an intermediate pellet (P2). This second supernatant (S2) was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to produce a high-speed pellet (P3) and cytosol (S3). Prior to methylation analysis, the P1, P2, and P3 fractions were washed twice by homogenization in fractionation buffer followed by recentrifugation at the appropriate speed. Each of the washings was done in a volume of buffer twice that used for the original tissue homogenization. The twice-washed pellets were rapidly resuspended by homogenization in sucrose-free PEMPL buffer, to effect a hypotonic lysis with the intent of releasing HMAP trapped in vesiculated compartments. After 30 min in the hypotonic buffer, sucrose was added to a final concentration of 10% (w/v) prior to storage at −70°C. The protein concentrations of the P1, P2, P3, and S3 fractions were 7.2, 8.3, 5.4, and 4.4 mg/ml, respectively. Protein concentrations were determined with the method of Lowry et al. (18Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) after precipitation in 7% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. Methylation reactions destined for analysis by SDS-PAGE were carried out in 6 μl of 75 m potassium MES, pH 6.2, containing 2.5-3.0 mg/ml tissue-extract-protein and 50 μ [methyl-3H]AdoMet (20,000 dpm/pmol). When added, purified PIMT was present at 1.8 μ. Methylation was initiated by addition of the labeled AdoMet and carried out for 10 min at 30°C. Reactions were stopped by adding 2 μl of stop solution (8% (w/v) SDS and 20% (w/v) 2-mercaptoethanol) followed by heating at 50°C for 10 min. The stopped samples were prepared for acidic SDS-PAGE by adding 2 μl of 0.5 sodium phosphate, pH 2.4, containing 50% (w/v) glycerol and 0.05% (w/v) pyronin Y. Pre-column methylation of rat brain cytosol (S3) for analytical size-exclusion high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was carried out as above in a reaction volume of 30 μl. The reaction was terminated by combining it with 50 μl of unmethylated rat brain cytosol (13 mg/ml in protein), to act as carrier, followed immediately by rapid gel filtration on a 1-ml Sephadex G25 (superfine) “spin-column” (19Jones A.J. Helmerhorst E. Stokes G.B. Biochem. J. 1983; 211: 499-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) equilibrated with 10 m sodium phosphate, pH 6.2, 150 m NaCl, and 1.5 m 2-mercaptoethanol (PBSM buffer). Post-column methylation of fractions from the size-exclusion HPLC used for analysis of trypsin sensitivity of HMAP was carried out at pH 6.8 for 30 min and processed by the diffusion assay as described previously (20Paranandi M.V. Guzzetta A.W. Hancock W.S. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 243-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was carried out in 0.75-mm-thick slab gels in a continuous pH 2.4 buffer system (21Fairbanks G. Avruch J. J. Supramol. Struct. 1972; 1: 66-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Gels of 10% or 5% acrylamide were used as indicated. Electrophoresis was carried out at room temperature in a Bio-Rad Mini-PROTEAN II apparatus at 50 V for 2.5 h. Molecular weight standards for SDS-PAGE were purchased from Bio-Rad. After electrophoresis, proteins were stained with Coomassie Blue R-250, impregnated with salicylate, dried, and then subjected to fluorography (40-50 h of exposure) on sensitized film as described previously (16Najbauer J. Orpiszewski J. Aswad D.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5183-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To estimate the size of native HMAP, a 50-μl sample of methylated rat brain cytosol (400 μg of protein) was chromatographed on a 7.8 × 300 mm Bio-Sil SEC 250 (Bio-Rad) size-exclusion HPLC column. The column was equilibrated and run in PBSM buffer at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Effluent was monitored at 278 nm while collecting fractions of 0.25 ml. The 3H content of each fraction was determined by scintillation counting. The column was calibrated with a set of gel filtration standards from Bio-Rad (catalog number 151-1901) consisting of thyroglobulin (670 kDa), immunoglobulin G (158 kDa), ovalbumin (44 kDa), myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin B-12 (1.35 kDa). The elution times of the standards were determined in a separate run under conditions identical to those used for analysis of the brain extracts. The elution pattern of the standard mixture, monitored at 278 nm, was virtually identical to the pattern provided by the manufacturer, thus allowing assignment of elution positions for each of the standards. Except where indicated otherwise, all procedures were carried out at 0-4°C. Sixty grams of frozen, demyelinated, cow cerebral cortex were homogenized in 4 volumes of 20 m BisTris-Cl, pH 7.0, 150 m NaCl, 0.5 m EDTA, 1 m DTT, 100 μ phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin for 1 min in an Ultraturrax model STD Tissuemizer (Tekmar Co.). After centrifugation at 9,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was removed and recentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. This supernatant was adjusted to 0.25 NaCl by addition of 1 NaCl, then loaded onto a 2.5 × 20 cm column of DEAE-cellulose (Whatman DE23) previously equilibrated with 20 m BisTris-Cl, pH 7.0, 0.25 NaCl, 1 m DTT. After washing with 1 column volume of this buffer, the column was developed with a 1-liter linear gradient of 0.25 to 1.0 NaCl made up in the same buffer. HMAP (eluting as a single broad peak centered at about 0.5 NaCl) was localized in column fractions by submitting a 3H-methylated portion of each fraction to acidic SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. Fractions containing HMAP were pooled and brought to 30% saturation with solid ammonium sulfate. After removing precipitated proteins by centrifugation, the supernatant was adjusted to 95% saturation with additional ammonium sulfate, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation. The final pellet was dissolved in 10 ml of sodium phosphate, pH 6.6, 0.25 NaCl, 1.5 m 2-mercaptoethanol, and loaded onto a 1.5 × 56 cm column of Sephacryl HR400 (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with the same buffer and run at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. HMAP, detected as described above, eluted as a major peak between the position of a 670-kDa marker and the void volume. Pooled fractions were concentrated to 4.0 ml (2.3 mg/ml protein) over an Amicon YM-10 membrane. HMAP, purified as above, was reduced and alkylated with iodoacetate as described previously (20Paranandi M.V. Guzzetta A.W. Hancock W.S. Aswad D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 243-253Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 6.9 mg of the reduced and alkylated HMAP was rechromatographed on the Sephacryl HR400 column, this time in the presence of 2.5 urea. Rechromatography indicated that reduction and alkylation had not significantly altered the molecular weight profile of HMAP. Ultrafiltration (Amicon YM-10 membrane) was used to simultaneously concentrate and exchange the rechromatographed HMAP into trypsin digestion buffer (0.1 sodium acetate, 10 m Tris acetate, 1 m CaCl2, pH 8.0). Trypsin digestion was carried out for 30 min at 37°C in a 100-μl reaction containing 1.0 mg/ml HMAP and 0.05 mg/ml trypsin. After stopping the reaction with 2 μl of glacial acetic acid, two-thirds of the digest was applied to a 7.5 × 300 mm Bio-Sil TSK 125 (Bio-Rad) size-exclusion HPLC column run at 1.0 ml/min in 10 m sodium acetate, pH 4.8, containing 150 m NaCl. Effluent was monitored at 278 nm while collecting fractions of 0.5 ml. A sample of undigested HMAP, subjected to a mock trypsin incubation, was run under the same conditions to serve as a control. The brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, and leg muscle were excised from an 8-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rat. The leg muscle was homogenized for 30 s in 1 volume of cold 10% sucrose in PEMPL buffer using an Ultraturrax model STD Tissuemizer (Tekmar Co.). All the other tissues were homogenized in the same buffer using a Dounce homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 9,000 × g for 20 min. The resulting supernatants were then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 60 min to produce the final cytosol. Samples of cytosol were then methylated in the presence or absence of purified PIMT as described above and analyzed by acidic SDS-PAGE in 10% acrylamide. As noted previously (16Najbauer J. Orpiszewski J. Aswad D.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5183-5190Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), incubation of rat brain cytosol with [methyl-3H]AdoMet, followed by SDS-PAGE in 10% acrylamide, results in a methylation pattern dominated heavily by a high mass macromolecule that barely enters the gel (Fig. 1A, lane 1). To determine if this methylation is dependent on the presence of endogenous PIMT, a parallel incubation was carried out in the presence of 0.4 m isoAsp-DSIP, a commercially available isoAsp-containing nonapeptide that serves as an effective substrate for both the rat recombinant (Km = 16 μ) and the cow brain (Km = 4 μ) enzymes (17David C.L. Aswad D.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1995; 6: 312-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 22Johnson B.A. Aswad D.W. Neurochem. Res. 1993; 18: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The presence of this alternative substrate blocked methylation of HMAP (lane 2), while the presence of 0.4 m DSIP (a homologous peptide containing a normal aspartate in place of the isoAsp) had no effect on endogenous methylation (lane 3). When purified PIMT was added to brain cytosol at a final concentration of 1.8 μ, methylation of HMAP was stimulated to a level above that observed for endogenous methylation (lane 4 versus lane 1). These results indicate that HMAP is a highly effective and specific substrate for PIMT in rat brain extracts. In an attempt to obtain a better estimate of the mass of HMAP, a sample similar to that used in lane 1 of Fig. 1A was subjected to SDS-PAGE in 5% acrylamide. As shown in Fig. 1B, HMAP migrated further into this gel, producing a diffuse region of methylation whose average apparent mass was well in excess of 200 kDa, indicating that HMAP is both large and heterogeneous. The subcellular distribution of HMAP in rat brain is shown in Table I. The highest specific activity was found in the S3 (100,000 × g supernatant) fraction, accounting for 61% of total HMAP recovered from all fractions. The lysed P1 (900 × g crude nuclear) fraction contained 32% of total HMAP. Much of this may represent soluble HMAP initially trapped in unbroken cells and large vesiculated cell fragments during homogenization.Table I.Subcellular distribution of HMAP in rat brainSubcellular fractionHMAP specific activityaHMAP activity was determined after SDS-PAGE as picomoles of [3H]CH3 recovered from each gel slice per mg of protein loaded per lane.

Open table in a new tab To determine the apparent mass of undenatured HMAP, we subjected rat brain cytosol, methylated with or without addition of purified PIMT, to size-exclusion HPLC. As shown in Fig. 2A, methyl-accepting activity was dominated by a major peak eluting between 670 kDa and the column void volume. The preferential methylation of HMAP by endogenous PIMT shown in Fig. 1 prompted us to consider the possibility that HMAP might be tightly associated with PIMT in brain cytosol. To test this, we subjected unmethylated brain cytosol to size-exclusion HPLC and then assayed fractions for PIMT activity. All of the enzyme activity eluted between 9.7 and 10.8 min, consistent with the native molecular mass (25 kDa) of rat PIMT (data not shown); thus, any association of PIMT with HMAP in cytosol is insufficiently tight to persist during size-exclusion HPLC. In preparation for undertaking a partial purification of HMAP, we determined that HMAP is present in cow brain at a level similar to that found in rat brain (data not shown). Because of its greater tissue mass, we chose to purify HMAP from cow brain. In preliminary experiments, we had found that rat HMAP bound to DEAE-cellulose, but not to CM-cellulose, at neutral pH and low ionic strength. Upon application of cow brain cytosol to DEAE-cellulose, we used a linear salt gradient to elute bound proteins from the column. HMAP eluted as single broad peak centered at approximately 0.5 NaCl, suggesting that it is a highly acidic protein (data not shown). By combining anion-exchange chromatography, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and gel filtration (see “Experimental Procedures”), we were able to purify cow brain HMAP approximately 50-fold (relative to cytosol) to a specific methyl-accepting activity of 12.1 nmol of CH3 incorporated per mg of protein. Sensitivity of this partially purified HMAP to trypsin digestion is shown in Fig. 2B. Because the methyl esters associated with methylated HMAP are unstable at neutral and alkaline pH, it was necessary to digest HMAP with trypsin prior to methylation and subsequent analysis. The upper two panels of Fig. 2B show that more than 90% of the UV-absorbing material containing partially purified HMAP was degraded to lower mass fragments. In parallel, the methyl-accepting activity associated with the HMAP peak was redistributed to a wide range of fragments of substantially smaller size. These results indicate that HMAP is composed, at least in part, of protein. To investigate the tissue distribution of HMAP, cytosol was prepared from freshly excised rat brain, heart, lung, liver, kidney, and skeletal muscle, methylated in the presence or absence of added PIMT or isoAsp-DSIP, and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by fluorography. As shown in Fig. 3, only brain contains significant levels of HMAP. Heart and lung tissues exhibit weak methylation of a large protein, but this substrate migrates with an apparent mass somewhat lower than that of HMAP. This result indicates that either HMAP is derived from a protein (or proteins) highly enriched in brain, or, alternatively, that HMAP is derived from a more widely distributed protein that is uniquely susceptible to isoaspartate formation in brain. HMAP is extensively methylated in vitro by endogenous PIMT in brain cytosol and is the only such substrate detected under the conditions used in Fig. 1. This preferential methylation suggests that HMAP may have a high affinity for PIMT as well as an abundance of methyl-accepting sites. The specific methyl-accepting capacity of partially purified HMAP from cow brain was estimated to be 12.1 nmol of CH3/mg of protein, approximately 50 times the average methyl-accepting capacity of unfractionated brain cytosol. If one corrects for the observation that HMAP contributes about 70% of total methyl-accepting capacity seen in rat brain cytosol (Fig. 2A), then the methyl-accepting capacity of HMAP in cow brain is at least 150 times that of the average cytosolic protein (excluding HMAP itself). If HMAP were considered as an aggregate of 60-kDa subunits (a typical mass for a cytosolic protein), its methyl-accepting capacity would correspond to a stoichiometry of 0.70 mol of isoAsp per mol of 60-kDa subunit. Mammalian PIMT has been shown to methylate both -isoaspartyl residues (10Brennan T.V. Anderson J.W. Jia Z. Waygood E.B. Clarke S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 5985-5995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in peptides and proteins; however, methylation of -aspartyl residues in peptides seems to occur with a catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) that is 2-3 orders of magnitude lower than -isoaspartyl residues (23Lowenson J.D. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5985-5995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Under the conditions of our methylation assays, we would not expect significant methylation of -aspartyl residues. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the high methyl-accepting capacity of HMAP represents a high content of -isoaspartyl residues. Although they may not contribute significantly to methylation capacity under our conditions, the presence of -aspartyl residues in HMAP would not be surprising since racemization of Asp occurs via formation of the same succinimide intermediate that generates peptide bond isomerization at Asp-X sequences (24Geiger T. Clarke S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 785-794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The high methyl-accepting capacity of HMAP, together with its large size and heterogeneity, suggest that it may consist of aggregates of damaged proteins that have accumulated high levels of -isoaspartyl (and possibly -aspartyl) residues. Further purification and partial sequencing of HMAP peptides should indicate if it consists of aggregates of known proteins or if it constitutes a unique protein. Isoaspartate has been found in the β-amyloid protein that comprises a significant portion of the protein aggregates in neuritic plaques and vascular amyloid deposits isolated from human brains afflicted with Alzheimer's disease (25Roher A.E.

Nevertheless, HMAP, like neuritic amyloid, may arise from the accumulation of proteins that are metabolically isolated, unable to be efficiently repaired by PIMT or to be broken down by intracellular proteases. Alternatively, HMAP may be a “normal” protein with highly unusual characteristics. Further studies on the structure, cellular localization, and developmental/age dependence of HMAP levels, should provide important clues to its significance and function.

https://openalex.org/W2062227183,"The mechanism by which the naturally occurring ligand for a nuclear hormone receptor regulates transcription remains largely unknown. One approach combines the specificity of monoclonal antibodies, which recognize a three-dimensional epitope, with ligand binding. Using purified retinoic acid receptor γ D and E domains, a panel of six unique monoclonal antibodies were isolated and characterized using solid-state receptor binding and retinoic acid receptor (RAR)-RXR heterodimer supershift formation. Three antibodies are specific for RARγ (mAbI, mAbII, and mAbV) and four recognize a three-dimensional epitope (mAbI, mAbIV, mAbV, and mAbVI). Three antibodies (mAbIII, mAbV, and mAbVI) dissociate from the receptor in electrophoretic mobility shift assays upon the addition of retinoic acid. In particular, the binding characteristics of mAbIII, whose epitope was mapped to a region identified as an Ω-loop (amino acids 207-222), suggest a model for ligand binding to the receptor. In this model, ligand binding causes a positioning of helix 12 into a favorable conformation for interaction with the transcriptional machinery. The Ω-loop then closes in order to stabilize this “active” position. The results reported here also suggest that a region of the hinge or D domain of the receptor (amino acids 156-188), an area that can play a role in protein-protein interactions, may also be important in ligand-induced functional changes.

The effects of t-RA are mediated through two types of nuclear retinoic acid receptors: RAR, which binds all-trans-RA (t-RA), as well as the isomer 9-cis -RA and RXR, which binds only 9-cis-RA (3Allenby G.

The E or ligand binding domain has also been shown to have ligand dependent transactivation (AF-2) and dimerization functions as well (7Forman B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol.

The D domain, or hinge region, has a function which is largely unknown and consists of three subregions (D1, D2, and D3), of which D2 is the least conserved among subtypes. Several studies have shown that conformational changes occur in RARs and other nuclear receptors upon ligand binding (10Leid M. J. Biol.

Further, ligand-induced conformational changes have also been hypothesized as prerequisites for transcriptional activation (12Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. McGrath M.E. West B.L. Baxter J.D.

Recently, the x-ray crystal structure of a liganded RARγ ligand binding domain was reported by Renaud et al. (20Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). They propose an Ω-loop structure, which may play a role in ligand-induced conformational changes that impact transcriptional activity. These results support earlier reports, using site-directed mutagenesis, which verify critical amino acid contact points within the ligand binding domain in close proximity to the Ω-loop (21Ostrowski J.

In the present study, we have isolated and characterized a series of monoclonal antibodies raised against purified DEγ protein (24Lupisella J.A. Driscoll J.E. Metzler W.J. Reczek P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24884-24890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) that recognize conformational epitopes. mAbI and mAbV are specific for hRARγ and recognize elements both in the N-terminal end of the D domain and the C-terminal end of the E domain, thereby placing regions of these domains within close proximity in three-dimensional space. Another antibody, mAbIII, has been mapped to the Ω-loop region of domain E. These antibodies predict elements of three-dimensional structure that are consistent with the x-ray crystal structure of RARγ (20Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) and are also in good agreement with the recently published structure of RXRα, which shares considerable sequence homology and secondary structural characteristics (25Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar). mAbIII is of particular interest, since it is shown here to dissociate from the receptor upon binding of t-RA and is therefore sensitive to conformational changes within the receptor. This action of mAbIII suggests a model of the conformational events that occur with ligand binding that may explain the transcriptional activity of t-RA. Expression vector pET-15b, and host strain Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) were purchased from Novagen, Inc. pSG5/hRARα, β, and γ and hRXRα were gifts from Dr. Pierre Chambon. Taq polymerase, PCR buffers, and deoxynucleoside triphoshates were obtained from Perkin-Elmer Corp. Amplification was performed in an Ericomp Easycycler™. Oligonucleotides used in PCR reactions and for electrophoretic shift assay (EMSA) were synthesized by Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. pMal-C and pIH902 vectors were purchased from New England BioLabs, Inc. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. All other chemicals were purchased from unless otherwise noted. All experiments involving retinoic acid were performed in subdued light. BALB/C mice were immunized subcutaneously once with a 1:1 mixture of hRAR/DEγ in complete Freund's adjuvant followed by a second injection in incomplete Freund's adjuvant 2 weeks later (50 μg of RAR/animal). Purification of hRAR/DEγ using nickel chelation chromatography was as described previously (24Lupisella J.A. Driscoll J.E. Metzler W.J. Reczek P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24884-24890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Two weeks after the second immunization, 25 μg of hRAR/DEγ in PBS was given intravenously. A mouse demonstrating high titer was sacrificed and its spleen fused 3 days later. The fusion was performed by standard methods (26Tam M.R. Buchanan T.M. Sandstrom E.G. Holmes K.K. Knapp J.S. Siadak A.W. Nowinski R.C. Infect. Immun. 1982; 36: 1042-1053Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell culture supernatants of hybrid cells were assayed for anti-RAR antibodies by the antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) described below. Twelve positive masterwells were then analyzed by EMSA. On the basis of these results, mAbs were subcloned by limiting dilution from three masterwells. After two rounds of subcloning, six stable cell lines were established. Hybridomas were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with -glutamine (292 μg/ml), 15% fetal bovine serum, 1 × penicillin-streptomycin, and 1 × hypoxanthine thymidine supplement. For dilution cloning, 10% hybridoma cloning supplement (Boehringer Mannheim) was added. Monoclonal antibodies were purified using an ImmunoPure IgG purification kit (Pierce) as described by the manufacturer. Construction of pET-15b expression vectors for full-length RARα, β, and γ and RXRα was by PCR amplification from pSG5/hRARα, β, γ, or hRXRα. For RARα, β, and γ, forward primers were designed so that an NdeI site at the 5′ end of each receptor placed an ATG start codon downstream and in frame with the N-terminal polyhistidine tail. Reverse primers for each receptor contained a stop codon, immediately followed by a BamHI site. For RXRα, the method was the same except XhoI sites at the 5′ and 3′ end were used. Verification of the constructs was by DNA sequencing according to the method of Sanger (27Sanger F. Coulson A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 94: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1475) Google Scholar), and the integrity of the expressed proteins was confirmed by ligand binding assays (data not shown). Expression in E. coli BL21(DE3) and preparation of crude soluble extracts was as described previously (24Lupisella J.A. Driscoll J.E. Metzler W.J. Reczek P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24884-24890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), except that cells were grown in superbroth (Quality Biological, Inc.) containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin. The maltose-binding protein-RAR fusions described in Fig. 2 and used for epitope mapping were prepared using appropriate restriction enzyme sites located within pSG5/hRARγ and ligated into either the pMal-C or pIH902 expression vectors. Crude receptor protein extracts were made from E. coli containing these fusions according to the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs). Epitope mapping was done concurrently by two methods using the MBP/hRARγ protein fusions to detect regions to which the monoclonal antibodies bound. The first method was the antibody capture ELISA as described below. The second method involved immunoprecipitation as follows. 10 μg of purified mAb was incubated with 100 μl of MBP/hRARγ protein fusion extracts on ice for 2 h in 50 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. 100 μl of 10% v/v protein A-agarose was added to each reaction and allowed to incubate, rotating at 4°C for 1 h. The resin was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 1 min at 4°C and washed three times with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer (50 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The antibody-antigen complexes were removed from the resin by adding 50 μl of 1 × Laemmli buffer in the absence of reducing agents and heating at 85°C for 10 min, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 2 min. The supernatants were then analyzed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (29Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (204097) Google Scholar) stained with rapid Coomassie stain (Diversified Biotech). Ligand binding affinity was determined using methods previously described (24Lupisella J.A. Driscoll J.E. Metzler W.J. Reczek P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24884-24890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In a given binding assay, 300 ng of purified hRAR/DEγ receptor protein was incubated with a 10-fold excess of each of the purified mAbs in the presence of 1 n [3H]t-RA. The apparent Kd was calculated from the IC50 derived from competition for binding with unlabeled t-RA. Purified DEγ was diluted to 2 μg/ml and crude extracts of RARα, β, and γ and RXRα and MBP/hRARγ protein fusions were diluted 1:10 with 50 m Carbonate/Bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6. Diluted antigen (50 μl/well) was placed into 96-well microtiter plates (Fisher). The plates were sealed and incubated at 37°C for 2 h and then at 4°C overnight. The plates were washed three times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. The wells were blocked with 200 μl of PBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 30 min at room temperature and washed three times as before with PBS/Tween 20. The wells were then incubated with 50 μl of cell culture supernatants, diluted if necessary in 50 m Carbonate/Bicarbonate buffer for 1 h at room temperature, and washed three times as described previously. The wells were next incubated with 50 μl/well horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc.) diluted 1:4,000 in 50 m Carbonate/Bicarbonate buffer for 30 min at room temperature and then washed three times as before. Finally, each well was incubated with 50 μl of substrate buffer (95 m NaOAc·3H2O, 3.8 m citric acid monohydrate, 1.4 m urea H2O2, pH 5.5) containing 0.1 mg/ml 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine at room temperature until blue color developed. The substrate was prepared as follows: 4.9 g of NaOAc·3H2O was dissolved in 360 ml of water. The pH adjusted to 5.5 with 0.42 g of citric acid monohydrate dissolved in 20 ml of water, after which was added 49.4 mg of urea H2O2. The reaction was stopped with 50 μl/well of 3 H2SO4 and the absorbance at 450/630 read. Isotype analysis was accomplished using mouse monoclonal antibody isotyping reagents (Sigma) in the antibody capture ELISA described above. To determine if the epitopes were conformational, the antibody capture ELISA described above was repeated using antigen (purified and crude extracts) that had been heated in a 95°C water bath for 15 min. Receptor protein (1-2 μl of E. coli expressed RAR or RXR extracts or 1 μl of a 1:1:6 mixture of RAR extract:RXR extract:binding buffer) was incubated with 1 μg of poly(dI·dC) (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and binding buffer for 15 min on ice. The binding buffer contained 10 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 m EDTA, 0.4 m dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, and 150 m KCl in the final reaction volume. In experiments where t-RA was added, 1 μl of a 1:1:6 mixture of RAR extract:RXR extract:binding buffer incubated with t-RA dissolved in Me2SO was further incubated overnight at 4°C so that the final ligand concentration in the protein-DNA binding reactions ranged from 0 to 1 μ. The concentration of Me2SO in the initial 18-h incubations of receptor and ligand did not exceed 2% (v/v). The samples were then incubated for 15 min at room temperature after the addition of 1 μl of 33P-labeled, double-stranded oligonucleotide probe consisting of the DR5 βRARE sequence 5′-GGT AGGGTTCAC CGA AAGTTCACT CG-3′ (28Zelent A. Mendelsohn C. Kastner P. Krust A. Garnier J.-M. Ruffenach F. Leroy P. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 71-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar) prepared as follows. Each synthesized complementary oligonucleotide was labeled with an equimolar quantity of [γ-33P]ATP (DuPont, specific activity 2,000 Ci/mmol) using polynucleotide kinase (Pharmacia) in labeling buffer (0.1 dithiothreitol, 0.1 MgCl2, 0.5 Tris-HCl, pH 9.0) for 30 min at 37°C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 100 m EDTA. Annealing of the complementary oligonucleotides was accomplished by slow cooling (3-4 h) in a water bath from 95°C to room temperature. The labeled probe was diluted so that 1 μl equaled 100,000 cpm. Antibody-induced supershifts were done by incubation of reaction mixtures (see above) for an additional 15 min at room temperature with 5 μl of hybridoma supernatants or, in some cases, 1 μl of purified mAb. The final reaction volume was 20 μl. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved on 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (prerun 1 h) in 0.5 × TBE at 12.5 V/cm at 8°C for approximately 2.5 h. The gels were dried onto filter paper, and the radioactivity was visualized either on Kodak X-Omat film or on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager (model 445SI). Immunization of BALB/C mice with purified hRAR/DEγ (24Lupisella J.A. Driscoll J.E. Metzler W.J. Reczek P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24884-24890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) resulted in hybridomas exhibiting a range of binding activities as measured by ELISA and EMSA. The supernatants from 12 masterwells were initially characterized by EMSA on the basis of their ability to supershift recombinant RAR-RXR heterodimers on a labeled DR5 βRARE (results not shown). Three masterwells, which tested positive for supershifting, were then subjected to two rounds of subcloning by limiting dilution. Selection of positive clones was by ELISA using purified hRAR/DEγ as the antigen. Further characterization of these positive clones resulted in the establishment of six distinct monoclonal antibody-producing cell lines (Table I).Table ICharacterization of mAbs using ELISA and EMSA with full-length receptor protein and purified antigenmAbELISAEMSAIsotypeRARαRARβRARγPurified DEγRXRαRARαRARβRARγI−−−+−−−+++IgG1II−−++++++−−−−IgG1III++++++++++++−++++++++IgG1IV+++++++++−−−−IgG1V−−++++−−+/−+++IgG1VI+++++++++−−+/−++IgG1+, strength of interaction; −, no interaction detected. Open table in a new tab +, strength of interaction; −, no interaction detected. The characterization of the six unique mAbs using ELISA and EMSA is shown in Table I. Each antibody was found to be of the IgG1 class using isotype-specific reagents. Additionally, none of the antibodies cross-react with RXRα in the ELISA assay. Three antibodies, mAbI, mAbII, and mAbV, were found to be specific for the RARγ receptor by ELISA. Two of these, mAbI and mAbV, were also specific for hRARγ by EMSA. mAbII and mAbIV could only be detected by ELISA, most probably because they recognize an epitope that is involved in DNA binding or heterodimerization and therefore were unable to supershift these complexes. Further, mAbI can only be detected by ELISA in the truncated form. This may be due to recognition of an epitope protected in the full-length receptor or may simply reflect the sensitivity of the assay when using a purified target. Differences were also noted in the degree of antibody binding to the full-length receptor protein as assessed between the two assays for mAbVI, which gave a stronger response for RARα and β in ELISA but a slightly weaker response for RARγ as compared with the EMSA. mAbIII had an equally strong response in both assays. The differences between assays may be reflective of the different forms of the antigen that are presented in each, i.e. a monomer in the plate-based assay and a heterodimer complex with DNA in the gel shift assay. Fig. 1 shows a representative EMSA for mAbI demonstrating its specificity for hRARγ. Taken together, these data suggest that mAbI, mAbII, and mAbV are specific for hRARγ, while mAbIII, mAbIV, and mAbVI recognize all three receptor subtypes. Interestingly, only mAbIII retains recognition for all three receptor subtypes in both assays. As pointed out above, the antigen used to produce the antibodies in this report was purified unliganded hRAR/DEγ expressed in E. coli with binding characteristics comparable to the native protein (24Lupisella J.A. Driscoll J.E. Metzler W.J. Reczek P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24884-24890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Since the antigen was present in its native conformation, it is possible that at least some of the antibodies isolated would recognize a three-dimensional determinant. To identify which of the six antibodies fit this criterion, each was tested in a solid state ELISA for binding to native versus denatured protein (Table II). After heat denaturation, only mAbII and mAbIII were able to recognize hRAR/DEγ in both the native and denatured form reflecting recognition by a primary amino acid sequence epitope. The binding of all other antibodies was nearly eliminated when heat-denatured hRAR/DEγ was used. These results suggest that mAbI, mAbIV, mAbV, and mAbVI recognize a three-dimensional epitope and that two of these, mAbI and mAbV, recognize hRARγ-specific sequences or conformations. In order to identify the regions within hRAR/DEγ that are recognized by each antibody, particularly in the case of those that recognize a conformational epitope, a series of E. coli expressed, truncated MBP/hRARγ protein fusions (Fig. 2A) were used in immunoprecipitation reactions. Each construct is named for the hRARγ amino acid numbers it contains. Fig. 2B summarizes the immunoprecipitation results for each of the protein fusions. The binding of mAbI and mAbV was mapped to amino acids (156-188) and (354-421), since a strong interaction occurs with the (3-454) and (86-454) constructs but not the (156-354) or (188-454) truncated receptors. These results indicate that amino acid regions (156-188) and (354-421) are necessary for antibody recognition. The binding of mAbII, mAbIV, and mAbVI was mapped to amino acids (156-188) only, and mAbIII was mapped to amino acids (207-222) using the same strategy. This mapping was confirmed using ELISA in which the plates were coated with crude extracts containing the protein fusions. Identical results were achieved except in the case of mAbI and mAbV, where no binding could be detected (results not shown). Inspection of Table I and Fig. 2B indicates that mAbI and mAbV have very similar properties and may actually recognize the same epitope. Both mAbs demonstrated a weak receptor interaction in ELISA compared to a strong interaction in the EMSA and gave nearly identical results with regard to their specificity, ability to bind only native protein, and map locations. In order to determine if these two mAbs were unique, an EMSA was done with various combinations of two antibodies added simultaneously (Fig. 3). The results of this experiment suggest that mAbI and mAbV, while mapped to the same general region, recognize different epitopes since their simultaneous addition results in an increased mobility shift beyond that of either antibody alone. This observation also occurred when mAbI was added simultaneously with mAbVI, indicating that the epitopes contained within the mapped region common to them were different as well. The addition of mAbV with mAbVI, however, did not lead to an enhanced supershift. Since these antibodies are unable to bind concurrently, they must compete for and therefore contain a shared epitope on the receptor. The complete epitopes of mAbV and mAbVI cannot be identical, however, since mAbV requires an additional region for binding (amino acids 354-421). In order to measure the effect of the mAbs on the receptor's ability to bind ligand, the apparent Kd of binding to t-RA in the presence of a 10-fold excess of mAb was determined by competition binding experiments. The results given in Table III indicate that no significant change in binding affinity occurred for any of the antibodies tested. Since the mAbs were shown to have no effect on ligand binding affinity themselves, they became ideal “reporter” molecules with which to moniter ligand-induced surface changes that potentially affected residues within an epitope. In order to prove this hypothesis, EMSA antibody supershifts were performed with receptor that had been incubated with increasing amounts of ligand. Fig. 4A shows the effect of concentrations up to 1 μ t-RA on mAbI, mAbV, and mAbVI supershifts of an RARγ-RXRα heterodimer complexed to the βRARE as described under “Experimental Procedures.” At 10−8 t-RA, there is a clearly diminished supershift with mAbV and mAbVI, while no effect is observed for mAbI, even at the highest concentration of t-RA. Fig. 4B shows the same experiment using mAbIII. The supershifted (upper) bands disappear with increasing t-RA concentration, while the heterodimer (lower) band reappears in a reciprocal fashion. Quantitation of these bands using phosphoimagery is shown in Fig. 4C. The density of the supershifted (upper) band and heterodimer (lower) band is equivalent at approximately 3.5 n, close to the reported Kd for binding of t-RA to hRARγ (3Allenby G. Bocquel M.-T. Saunders M. Kazmer S. Speck J. Rosenberger M. Lovey A. Kastner P. Grippo J. Chambon P. Levin A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Investigation into the nature of ligand-induced conformational changes and the protein-protein interactions or non-interactions that follow will provide a greater understanding of retinoid action. Primary amino acid sequence has been used to identify non-homologous regions between receptor subtypes, and attempts to raise antibodies against synthetic peptides that recognize these regions have been very successful in selection for receptor specificity (30Gaub M.-P.

Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The primary goal of this study, however, has been the discovery of antibodies which recognize three-dimensional epitopes that may be sensitive to structural changes that occur upon ligand binding. To accomplish this, mice were immunized against the native, unliganded D and E domains of human RARγ purified as described previously (24Lupisella J.A. Driscoll J.E. Metzler W.J. Reczek P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24884-24890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The resulting monoclonal antibodies (mAbI-VI) were isolated and further characterized. Fig. 5 provides a summary of the primary amino acid sequence for RARγ and the regions to which the mAbs in this study were mapped. The helices determined by crystallographic studies for hRARγ are noted (20Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) including the helix previous to helix 1, which is predicted after Garnier et al. (34Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). Although the precise recognition sequence for mAbI-mAbVI has not been determined, these antibodies are shown to bind to three distinct regions within the receptor. All mAbs except mAbIII recognize sequence elements in region 1. mAbII and mAbIV are similar in that neither is able to bind an RARγ-RXRα heterodimer/DNA complex. However, the recognized epitopes are clearly distinct since mAbII recognizes RARγ only, while mAbIV cross-reacts with all three receptor subtypes. Region 1 also contains amino acids termed the H-box by Predki et al. (35Predki P.F. Zamble D. Sarkar B. Giguere V. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 31-39PubMed Google Scholar) (amino acids 156-171). These authors provide evidence that this region may mediate the structural arrangement of heterodimeric partners on RAREs and suggest it functions by direct protein-protein contact with the RXR DNA binding domain. The H-box is contained within the D1 region of the receptor, which is almost completely conserved between RARα, β, and γ and also contains a predicted helical region (34Garnier J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3380) Google Scholar). This observation is consistent with those reported here, since mAbIV was found to recognize all three receptor subtypes and does not bind to denatured receptor (Table II). mAbII, which is RARγ-specific and recognizes a non-conformational epitope might overlap from this region into D2 (amino acids 171-191), as this region is quite divergent between RAR subtypes and contains a random stretch of amino acids between the predicted α-helix and helix 1 (Fig. 5). Two additional antibodies (mAbI and mAbV) were also found to map to region 1. Epitope mapping of these mAbs using the truncated receptors (Fig. 2A) led to the interesting finding that the N-terminal region of the D domain (amino acids 156-188) as well as the C-terminal region of the E domain (amino acids 354-421) were both required for antibody recognition. Further, these antibodies were unable to recognize receptor protein upon heat denaturation (Table II). This is consistent with the idea that these mAbs recognize a conformational epitope and suggests that region 1 and region 3 are in close proximity in the three-dimensional structure of the native receptor, a finding in good agreement with the recently published x-ray crystallographic structures of RARγ (20Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) and RXRα (25Bourguet W. Ruff M. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 375: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar), in which helix 1 and helix 9 are in close proximity to one another. Inspection of the primary sequence of the mapped regions and those corresponding to the region immediately preceding helix 1 and the end of helix 9 revealed the presence of a basic amino acid cluster of lysine (amino acids 166-169) and arginine (amino acids 366-369), respectively. Inasmuch as the convergence of the N-terminal end of D and C-terminal end of E is immediately adjacent to the DNA binding domain, the presence of the basic amino acid clusters in these regions suggests the possibility of an interaction with the phosphodiester backbone of DNA upstream or downstream of the RARE. Finally, mAbVI also maps to region 1 and shares a common epitope with mAbV. mAbVI differs from mAbV in that it is not RARγ-specific, but the specificity of mAbV could be conferred by the area in region 3 to which it and not mAbVI binds. Interestingly, these mAbs are shown to dissociate from the RARγ-RXRα heterodimer/DNA complex upon addition of t-RA, a result not observed with mAbI (Fig. 4A). That these mAbs are sensitive to ligand-induced conformational changes suggests a role for protein-protein interactions in this region. The model proposed by Renaud et al. (20Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) suggests a major conformational change upon ligand binding, tending toward more compactness of the molecule. Such a conformational change might also preclude the binding of an interacting factor with the receptor in this region. Region 1 contains amino acids 183-188, which are homologous to the first 6 amino acids in the CoR-box of RARα, an 18-amino acid region proposed by Kurokawa et al. (19Kurokawa R. Soderstrom M. Horlein A. Halachmi S. Brown M. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Nature. 1995; 377: 451-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) to bind the nuclear receptor co-repressor, N-CoR. Only one mAb was isolated that mapped to region 2 (mAbIII). mAbIII recognizes both native and denatured receptor in the random coil region of amino acids 207-222 (Table II). Region 2 has been identified as an Ω-loop (20Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) from the x-ray crystal structure and is located between helix 1 and 3. Fig. 4 (B and C) shows that the antibody supershift caused by interaction with mAbIII can be effectively dissociated from the RAR-RXR heterodimer with increasing concentrations of t-RA. Quantitation of the supershifted and heterodimer bands by phosphoimagery show an inverse relationship with the point of intersection at about 3.5 n, close to the Kd for t-RA binding (3Allenby G. Bocquel M.-T. Saunders M. Kazmer S. Speck J. Rosenberger M. Lovey A. Kastner P. Grippo J. Chambon P. Levin A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). These results provide direct evidence to support the model proposed by Renaud et al. (20Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar), which is based on a comparison of the x-ray crystal structures derived for holoE-RARγ and apoE-RXRα. Since mAbIII was made using apoDE-RARγ as antigen, it most probably recognizes the unliganded conformation as depicted in Fig. 6. When t-RA is bound, helix 12 flips up to cover the ligand binding pocket making a salt bridge between a lysine residue (K264) on helix 4 and a glutamic acid (E414) on helix 12. The Ω-loop closes over helix 12, thus stabilizing the liganded or “active” conformation and allowing interaction between the AF2 domain contained within helix 12 and the transcriptional machinery. The residues recognized by mAbIII are then unavailable for antibody binding and mAbIII dissociates (Fig. 4C and 6). The panel of six distinct mAbs raised against native hRAR/DEγ described here have been characterized and shown to be useful probes for providing structural and functional information regarding RARγ, its interactions with ligand and possibly other factors. In order to support the use of these antibodies as “reporters” of conformational changes on the surface of the receptor protein, it was important to show that the antibodies themselves did not induce structural alterations which affected ligand binding affinity (Table III). The lack of any change in ligand binding affinity induced by the binding of antibodies was not surprising in light of the x-ray crystal structure showing that t-RA binds in the interior of the receptor (20Renaud J.-P. Rochel N. Ruff M. Vivat V. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Moras D. Nature. 1995; 378: 681-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar). As a result, several of the mAbs could be used to detect ligand-induced conformation changes. The most striking result involves the binding properties of mAbV and mAbVI, since both of these antibodies dissociate from the receptor in the presence of ligand yet their recognition epitope is located at some distance from the ligand binding pocket. This result suggests that the ligand binding signal can be transduced to other parts of the protein and ultimately affect residues on the protein's surface which may be spatially distinct from the actual ligand binding site. Current experiments are aimed at testing this hypothesis. We thank Dr. Pierre Chambon for providing the cDNA for RARα, β, γ, and RXRα and for continued encouragement and many valuable discussions. In addition, Drs. S. Currier and J. Ostrowski provided help in the initial characterization of the antibodies as well as a critical reading of the manuscript."
