https://openalex.org/W2143909130,"Extensive evidence suggests that the human ability to adaptively implement a wide variety of tasks is preferentially a result of the operation of a fronto-parietal brain network (FPN). We hypothesized that this network's adaptability is made possible by flexible hubs: brain regions that rapidly update their pattern of global functional connectivity according to task demands. Using recent advances in characterizing brain network organization and dynamics, we identified mechanisms consistent with the flexible hub theory. We found that the FPN's brain-wide functional connectivity pattern shifted more than those of other networks across a variety of task states and that these connectivity patterns could be used to identify the current task. Furthermore, these patterns were consistent across practiced and novel tasks, suggesting that reuse of flexible hub connectivity patterns facilitates adaptive (novel) task performance. Together, these findings support a central role for fronto-parietal flexible hubs in cognitive control and adaptive implementation of task demands."

https://openalex.org/W3121812901,"Introduction How do the network positions of the first individuals in a society to receive information about a new product affect its eventual diffusion? To answer this question, we develop a model of information diffusion through a social network that discriminates between information passing (individuals must be aware of the product before they can adopt it, and they can learn from their friends) and endorsement (the decisions of informed individuals to adopt the product might be influenced by their friends’ decisions). We apply it to the diffusion of microfinance loans, in a setting where the set of potentially first-informed individuals is known. We then propose two new measures of how “central” individuals are in their social network with regard to spreading information; the centrality of the first-informed individuals in a village helps significantly in predicting eventual adoption. Methods Six months before a microfinance institution entered 43 villages in India and began offering microfinance loans to villagers, we collected detailed network data by surveying households about a wide range of interactions. The microfinance institution began by inviting “leaders” (e.g., teachers, shopkeepers, savings group leaders) to an informational meeting and then asked them to spread information about the loans. Using the network data, the locations in the network of these first-informed villagers (or injection points), and data regarding the villagers’ subsequent participation, we estimate the parameters of our diffusion model using the method of simulated moments. The parameters of the model are validated by showing that the model correctly predicts the evolution of participation in each village over time. The model yields a new measure of the effectiveness of any given node as an injection point, which we call communication centrality. Finally, we develop an easily computed proxy for communication centrality, which we call diffusion centrality. Results We find that a microfinance participant is seven times as likely to inform another household as a nonparticipant; nonetheless, information transmitted by nonparticipants is important and accounts for about one-third of the eventual informedness and participation in the village because nonparticipants are much more numerous. Once information passing is accounted for, an informed household’s decision to participate is not significantly dependent on how many of its neighbors have participated. Communication centrality, when applied to the set of first-informed individuals in a village, substantially outperforms other standard network measures of centrality in predicting microfinance participation in this context. Finally, the simpler proxy measure—diffusion centrality—is strongly correlated with communication centrality and inherits its predictive properties. Discussion Our results suggest that a model of diffusion can distinguish information passing from endorsement effects, and that understanding the nature of transmission may be important in identifying the ideal places to inject information."

These internally generated stimuli sometimes get associated with concurrent external stimuli, which can lead to the formation of false memories. Ramirez et al. (p. 387 ; see the cover) identified a population of cells in the dentate gyrus of the mouse hippocampus that encoded a particular context and were able to generate a false memory and study its neural and behavioral interactions with true memories. Optogenetic reactivation of memory engram–bearing cells was not only sufficient for the behavioral recall of that memory, but could also serve as a conditioned stimulus for the formation of an associative memory."

https://openalex.org/W2134106182,"Not mTORCing Inhibition of the protein kinase complex mTORC1 has potentially beneficial therapeutic affects that include inhibition of cancer and extension of life span. However, effects of its inhibition in vivo have sometimes been disappointing. One reason may be that the well-studied inhibitor of mTORC1, rapamycin, inhibits some effects of mTORC1 but not others. In line with this idea, Kang et al. ( 1236566 ) show that the effect of rapamycin depends on the substrate. Characteristics of the phosphorylation sites on various substrates caused them to be phosphorylated with different efficiency by mTORC1. The substrates that were most efficiently phosphorylated were resistant to inhibition of mTORC1. The results explain how various sites, sometimes within the same protein, can differ in their sensitivity to rapamycin."
https://openalex.org/W2022159597,"PTEN Variations The product of the tumor suppressor gene phosphate and tensin homolog on chromosome ten ( PTEN) is a lipid and protein phosphatase that regulates important cellular processes, including growth, survival, and metabolism (see the Perspective by Leslie and Brunton ). Though PTEN is best known for effects on the phosphatidylnositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway, the PTEN protein is also found in the nucleus. Bassi et al. (p. 395 ) found that PTEN's presence in the nucleus was regulated in response to covalent modification of the protein by SUMOylation and phosphorylation. Cells lacking nuclear PTEN showed increased sensitivity to DNA damage and underwent cell death if the PI3K pathway was also inhibited. Hopkins et al. (p. 399 , published online 6 June) discovered an alternative translation start site in human PTEN messenger RNA that allowed expression of a protein, PTEN-Long, with about 170 extra amino acids. The unusual enzyme was released from cells and then taken up into other cells. In a mouse tumor model, uptake of the enzyme inhibited the PI3K pathway and inhibited tumor growth."

Yagi and Yunes (p. 365 ) examined the moment of inertia of neutron stars, which determines how fast they can spin, and the quadrupole moment and tidal Love number, which determine how much they can be deformed. The findings suggest that these three quantities obey universal relationships that are independent of the internal structure of the stars, implying that measurements of one of the three could accurately predict the other two."

Studying a rat model, Saeidi et al. (p. 406 ; see Perspective by Berthoud ) found that the surgically reconfigured intestinal segment (the Roux limb) underwent an adaptive response characterized by increased glucose uptake and utilization, apparently triggered by exposure to undigested nutrients. As a result of this change, the intestine provided a major tissue for whole-body glucose control. Whether the same adaptive response occurs in the human intestine remains to be examined."

https://openalex.org/W2074309287,"Help Shared Germinal centers are specialized structures within lymph nodes, where B cells undergo the changes required to produce high-affinity antibodies. This process relies on T follicular helper (Tfh) cells. The dynamic properties of Tfh cells and how they affect the selection of B cells, however, are not well understood. Using two-photon laser scanning microscopy of mouse lymph nodes, Shulman et al. (p. 673 , published online 25 July) find that Tfh cells are not restricted to a single germinal center, but instead emigrate into neighboring germinal centers within the same lymph nodes. Furthermore, newly activated T cells can enter already established germinal centers and presumably influence ongoing B cell selection and differentiation. Such active movement may ensure maximal diversification of the B cell response and promote the production of high-affinity antibodies."

https://openalex.org/W2142749172,"Brain activity generates extracellular voltage fluctuations recorded as local field potentials (LFPs). It is known that the relevant microvariables, the ionic currents across membranes, jointly generate the macrovariables, the extracellular voltage, but neither the detailed biophysical knowledge nor the required computational power have been available to model these processes. We simulated the LFP in a model of the rodent neocortical column composed of >12,000 reconstructed, multicompartmental, and spiking cortical layer 4 and 5 pyramidal neurons and basket cells, including five million dendritic and somatic compartments with voltage- and ion-dependent currents, realistic connectivity, and probabilistic AMPA, NMDA, and GABA synapses. We found that, depending on a number of factors, the LFP reflects local and cross-layer processing. Active currents dominate the generation of LFPs, not synaptic ones. Spike-related currents impact the LFP not only at higher frequencies but below 50 Hz. This work calls for re-evaluating the genesis of LFPs."

https://openalex.org/W1988295528,"Observations of the galaxy NGC 253 show that the cool molecular wind from the central starburst region limits star-formation activity and the final stellar content. New interferometric observations from the ALMA radio telescope reveal the central two kiloparsec region of the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 253 in unprecedented detail. Using the new data it is now possible to measure the mass-outflow rate of the starburst system for the first time. By ejecting around nine solar masses per year (three times the mass converted to stars in the same period), the starburst-driven 'superwind' limits the star-formation rate and the number of stars produced in this galaxy. The under-abundance of very massive galaxies1,2 in the Universe is frequently attributed to the effect of galactic winds3,4,5,6. Although ionized galactic winds are readily observable, most of the expelled mass (that is, the total mass flowing out from the nuclear region) is likely to be in atomic7,8 and molecular phases9,10,11 that are cooler than the ionized phases. Expanding molecular shells observed in starburst systems such as NGC 253 (ref. 12) and M 82 (refs 13, 14) may facilitate the entrainment of molecular gas in the wind. Although shell properties are well constrained12, determining the amount of outflowing gas emerging from such shells and the connection between this gas and the ionized wind requires spatial resolution better than 100 parsecs coupled with sensitivity to a wide range of spatial scales, a combination hitherto not available. Here we report observations of NGC 253, a nearby15 starburst galaxy (distance ∼ 3.4 megaparsecs) known to possess a wind16,17,18,19,20, that trace the cool molecular wind at 50-parsec resolution. At this resolution, the extraplanar molecular gas closely tracks the Hα filaments, and it appears to be connected to expanding molecular shells located in the starburst region. These observations allow us to determine that the molecular outflow rate is greater than 3 solar masses per year and probably about 9 solar masses per year. This implies a ratio of mass-outflow rate to star-formation rate of at least 1, and probably ∼3, indicating that the starburst-driven wind limits the star-formation activity and the final stellar content."
https://openalex.org/W2042507145,"The strength of synaptic transmission is controlled by the number and activity of neurotransmitter receptors. However, little is known about absolute numbers and densities of receptor and scaffold proteins and the stoichiometry of molecular interactions at synapses. Here, we conducted three-dimensional and quantitative nanoscopic imaging based on single-molecule detections to characterize the ultrastructure of inhibitory synapses and to count scaffold proteins and receptor binding sites. We observed a close correspondence between the spatial organization of gephyrin scaffolds and glycine receptors at spinal cord synapses. Endogenous gephyrin was clustered at densities of 5,000–10,000 molecules/μm2. The stoichiometry between gephyrin molecules and receptor binding sites was approximately 1:1, consistent with a two-dimensional scaffold in which all gephyrin molecules can contribute to receptor binding. The competition of glycine and GABAA receptor complexes for synaptic binding sites highlights the potential of single-molecule imaging to quantify synaptic plasticity on the nanoscopic scale."
https://openalex.org/W1979464069,"Spontaneous fMRI fluctuations are organized in large-scale spatiotemporal structures, or resting-state networks (RSN). However, it is unknown how task performance affects RSN dynamics. We use MEG to measure slow (∼0.1 Hz) coherent fluctuations of band-limited power (BLP), a robust correlate of RSN, during rest and movie observation and compare them to fMRI-RSN. BLP correlation, especially in α band, dropped in multiple RSN during movie although overall topography was maintained. Variability of power correlation increased in visual occipital cortex, and transient decrements corresponded to scenes perceived as ""event boundaries."" Additionally, stronger task-dependent interactions developed between vision and language networks in θ and β bands, and default and language networks in γ band. The topography of fMRI connectivity and relative changes induced by the movie were well matched to MEG. We conclude that resting-state and task network interactions are clearly different in the frequency domain despite maintenance of underlying network topography."
https://openalex.org/W1991901212,"Optogenetic techniques provide effective ways of manipulating the functions of selected neurons with light. In the current study, we engineered an optogenetic technique that directly inhibits neurotransmitter release. We used a genetically encoded singlet oxygen generator, miniSOG, to conduct chromophore assisted light inactivation (CALI) of synaptic proteins. Fusions of miniSOG to VAMP2 and synaptophysin enabled disruption of presynaptic vesicular release upon illumination with blue light. In cultured neurons and hippocampal organotypic slices, synaptic release was reduced up to 100%. Such inhibition lasted >1 hr and had minimal effects on membrane electrical properties. When miniSOG-VAMP2 was expressed panneuronally in Caenorhabditis elegans, movement of the worms was reduced after illumination, and paralysis was often observed. The movement of the worms recovered overnight. We name this technique Inhibition of Synapses with CALI (InSynC). InSynC is a powerful way to silence genetically specified synapses with light in a spatially and temporally precise manner."
https://openalex.org/W2168798091,"Large numbers of inbred laboratory rat strains have been developed for a range of complex disease phenotypes. To gain insights into the evolutionary pressures underlying selection for these phenotypes, we sequenced the genomes of 27 rat strains, including 11 models of hypertension, diabetes, and insulin resistance, along with their respective control strains. Altogether, we identified more than 13 million single-nucleotide variants, indels, and structural variants across these rat strains. Analysis of strain-specific selective sweeps and gene clusters implicated genes and pathways involved in cation transport, angiotensin production, and regulators of oxidative stress in the development of cardiovascular disease phenotypes in rats. Many of the rat loci that we identified overlap with previously mapped loci for related traits in humans, indicating the presence of shared pathways underlying these phenotypes in rats and humans. These data represent a step change in resources available for evolutionary analysis of complex traits in disease models."
https://openalex.org/W2043609864,"In a FtsZ FtsZ is a guanosine triphosphatase that polymerizes into protofilaments at the bacterial division site. FtsZ recruits the accessory division proteins to the septum and also provides mechanical forces needed to constrict the membrane and reduce the cell width. However, how FtsZ generates mechanical force is unclear. While one popular model suggests that mechanical forces are generated by means of a change in FtsZ structure induced by guanosine triphosphate hydrolysis, nucleotide-dependent conformational transitions have yet to be observed in FtsZ monomer structures. Such transitions may be a feature of FtsZ only in its native protofilament-forming state. Li et al. (p. 392 ) sought to resolve this question by obtaining high-resolution structures of guanosine diphosphate–bound FtsZ filaments. The results suggest a complex and dynamic FtsZ protofilament network with a high degree of plasticity that is capable of generating forces to drive cytokinesis, during cycles of hydrolysis, while maintaining the structural integrity of individual monomers."

We localized a region in the macaque occipitotemporal sulcus that responds preferentially to images of scenes. Single-unit recording revealed that this region, which we term the lateral place patch (LPP), contained a large concentration of scene-selective single units. These units were not modulated by spatial layout alone but were instead modulated by a combination of spatial and nonspatial factors, with individual units coding specific scene parts. We further demonstrate by microstimulation that LPP is connected with extrastriate visual areas V4V and DP and a scene-selective medial place patch in the parahippocampal gyrus, revealing a ventral network for visual scene processing in the macaque."

Holographic duality provides a systematic approach to studying such quantum turbulence by mapping the dynamics of a strongly interacting quantum liquid into the dynamics of classical gravity. We use this gravitational description to numerically construct turbulent flows in a holographic superfluid in two spatial dimensions. We find that the superfluid kinetic energy spectrum obeys the Kolmogorov -5/3 scaling law, with energy injected at long wavelengths undergoing a direct cascade to short wavelengths where dissipation by vortex annihilation and vortex drag becomes efficient. This dissipation has a simple gravitational interpretation as energy flux across a black hole event horizon."
https://openalex.org/W2049772246,"Hypertriglyceridemia is the most common lipid disorder in obesity and type 2 diabetes. It results from increased production and/or decreased clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. To better understand the pathophysiology of hypertriglyceridemia, we studied hepatic regulation of triglyceride metabolism by the activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a member of the basic leucine zipper-containing protein subfamily. We determined the effect of ATF4 on hepatic lipid metabolism in Atf4(-/-) mice fed regular chow or provided with free access to fructose drinking water. ATF4 depletion preferentially attenuated hepatic lipogenesis without affecting hepatic triglyceride production and fatty acid oxidation. This effect prevented excessive fat accumulation in the liver of Atf4(-/-) mice, when compared with wild-type littermates. To gain insight into the underlying mechanism, we showed that ATF4 depletion resulted in a significant reduction in hepatic expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, a nuclear receptor that acts to promote lipogenesis in the liver. This effect was accompanied by a significant reduction in hepatic expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and fatty-acid synthase, three key functions in the lipogenic pathway in Atf4(-/-) mice. Of particular significance, we found that Atf4(-/-) mice, as opposed to wild-type littermates, were protected against the development of steatosis and hypertriglyceridemia in response to high fructose feeding. These data demonstrate that ATF4 plays a critical role in regulating hepatic lipid metabolism in response to nutritional cues."
https://openalex.org/W2102046690,"Sensory neurons adopt distinct morphologies and functional modalities to mediate responses to specific stimuli. Transcription factors and their downstream effectors orchestrate this outcome but are incompletely defined. Here, we show that different classes of mechanosensory neurons in C. elegans are distinguished by the combined action of the transcription factors MEC-3, AHR-1, and ZAG-1. Low levels of MEC-3 specify the elaborate branching pattern of PVD nociceptors, whereas high MEC-3 is correlated with the simple morphology of AVM and PVM touch neurons. AHR-1 specifies AVM touch neuron fate by elevating MEC-3 while simultaneously blocking expression of nociceptive genes such as the MEC-3 target, the claudin-like membrane protein HPO-30, that promotes the complex dendritic branching pattern of PVD. ZAG-1 exercises a parallel role to prevent PVM from adopting the PVD fate. The conserved dendritic branching function of the Drosophila AHR-1 homolog, Spineless, argues for similar pathways in mammals."

Here, we show that transgenic deletion of NARP decreases the number of excitatory synaptic inputs onto FS (PV) INs and reduces net excitatory synaptic drive onto FS (PV) INs. Accordingly, the visual cortex of NARP(-/-) mice is hyperexcitable and unable to express ocular dominance plasticity, although many aspects of visual function are unimpaired. Importantly, the number and strength of inhibitory synaptic contacts from FS (PV) INs onto principle neurons in the visual cortex is normal in NARP(-/-) mice, and enhancement of this output recovers the expression of experience-dependent synaptic plasticity. Thus the recruitment of inhibition from FS (PV) INs plays a central role in enabling the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2002818210,"Humans can resist temptations by exerting willpower, the effortful inhibition of impulses. But willpower can be disrupted by emotions and depleted over time. Luckily, humans can deploy alternative self-control strategies like precommitment, the voluntary restriction of access to temptations. Here, we examined the neural mechanisms of willpower and precommitment using fMRI. Behaviorally, precommitment facilitated choices for large delayed rewards, relative to willpower, especially in more impulsive individuals. While willpower was associated with activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), posterior parietal cortex (PPC), and inferior frontal gyrus, precommitment engaged lateral frontopolar cortex (LFPC). During precommitment, LFPC showed increased functional connectivity with DLPFC and PPC, especially in more impulsive individuals, and the relationship between impulsivity and LFPC connectivity was mediated by value-related activation in ventromedial PFC. Our findings support a hierarchical model of self-control in which LFPC orchestrates precommitment by controlling action plans in more caudal prefrontal regions as a function of expected value."
https://openalex.org/W2128989053,"The glutathionylation of intracellular protein thiols can protect against irreversible oxidation and can act as a redox switch regulating metabolic pathways. In this study we discovered that the Omega class glutathione transferase GSTO1-1 plays a significant role in the glutathionylation cycle. The catalytic activity of GSTO1-1 was determined in vitro by assaying the deglutathionylation of a synthetic peptide by tryptophan fluorescence quenching and in T47-D epithelial breast cancer cells by both immunoblotting and the direct determination of total glutathionylation. Mutating the active site cysteine residue (Cys-32) ablated the deglutathionylating activity of GSTO1-1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the expression of GSTO1-1 in T47-D cells that are devoid of endogenous GSTO1-1 resulted in a 50% reduction in total glutathionylation levels. Mass spectrometry and immunoprecipitation identified β-actin as a protein that is specifically deglutathionylated by GSTO1-1 in T47-D cells. In contrast to the deglutathionylation activity, we also found that GSTO1-1 is associated with the rapid glutathionylation of cellular proteins when the cells are exposed to S-nitrosoglutathione. The common A140D genetic polymorphism in GSTO1 was found to have significant effects on the kinetics of both the deglutathionylation and glutathionylation reactions. Genetic variation in GSTO1-1 has been associated with a range of diseases, and the discovery that a frequent GSTO1-1 polymorphism affects glutathionylation cycle reactions reveals a common mechanism where it can act on multiple proteins and pathways."

We show here that Mef2 is required for this daily fasciculation-defasciculation cycle. Moreover, the master circadian transcription complex CLK/CYC directly regulates Mef2 transcription. ChIP-Chip analysis identified numerous Mef2 target genes implicated in neuronal plasticity, including the cell-adhesion gene Fas2. Genetic epistasis experiments support this transcriptional regulatory hierarchy, CLK/CYC- > Mef2- > Fas2, indicate that it influences the circadian fasciculation cycle within pacemaker neurons, and suggest that this cycle also contributes to circadian behavior. Mef2 therefore transmits clock information to machinery involved in neuronal remodeling, which contributes to locomotor activity rhythms."
https://openalex.org/W2061606627,"The immunoglobulin superfamily glycoprotein CD147 (emmprin; basigin) is associated with an invasive phenotype in various types of cancers, including malignant breast cancer. We showed recently that up-regulation of CD147 in non-transformed, non-invasive breast epithelial cells is sufficient to induce an invasive phenotype characterized by membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP)-dependent invadopodia activity (Grass, G. D., Bratoeva, M., and Toole, B. P. (2012) Regulation of invadopodia formation and activity by CD147. J. Cell Sci. 125, 777-788). Here we found that CD147 induces breast epithelial cell invasiveness by promoting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-Ras-ERK signaling in a manner dependent on hyaluronan-CD44 interaction. Furthermore, CD147 promotes assembly of signaling complexes containing CD147, CD44, and EGFR in lipid raftlike domains. We also found that oncogenic Ras regulates CD147 expression, hyaluronan synthesis, and formation of CD147-CD44-EGFR complexes, thus forming a positive feedback loop that may amplify invasiveness. Last, we showed that malignant breast cancer cells are heterogeneous in their expression of surface-associated CD147 and that high levels of membrane CD147 correlate with cell surface EGFR and CD44 levels, activated EGFR and ERK1, and activated invadopodia. Future studies should evaluate CD147 as a potential therapeutic target and disease stratification marker in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2120820768,"Inhibition of Arp2/3-mediated actin polymerization by PICK1 is a central mechanism to AMPA receptor (AMPAR) internalization and long-term depression (LTD), although the signaling pathways that modulate this process in response to NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activation are unknown. Here, we define a function for the GTPase Arf1 in this process. We show that Arf1-GTP binds PICK1 to limit PICK1-mediated inhibition of Arp2/3 activity. Expression of mutant Arf1 that does not bind PICK1 leads to reduced surface levels of GluA2-containing AMPARs and smaller spines in hippocampal neurons, which occludes subsequent NMDA-induced AMPAR internalization and spine shrinkage. In organotypic slices, NMDAR-dependent LTD of AMPAR excitatory postsynaptic currents is abolished in neurons expressing mutant Arf1. Furthermore, NMDAR stimulation downregulates Arf1 activation and binding to PICK1 via the Arf-GAP GIT1. This study defines Arf1 as a critical regulator of actin dynamics and synaptic function via modulation of PICK1."

https://openalex.org/W2140907695,"Pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), the protein product of the SERPINF1 gene, has been linked to distinct diseases involving adipose or bone tissue, the metabolic syndrome, and osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type VI. Since mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) differentiation into adipocytes vs. osteoblasts can be regulated by specific factors, PEDF-directed dependency of murine and human MSCs was assessed. PEDF inhibited adipogenesis and promoted osteoblast differentiation of murine MSCs, osteoblast precursors, and human MSCs. Blockade of adipogenesis by PEDF suppressed peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), adiponectin, and other adipocyte markers by nearly 90% compared with control-treated cells (P<0.001). Differentiation to osteoblasts by PEDF resulted in a common pathway that involved PPARγ suppression (P<0.01). Canonical Wnt-β-catenin signaling results in a MSC differentiation pattern analogous to that seen with PEDF. Thus, adding PEDF enhanced Wnt-β-catenin signal transduction in human MSCs, demonstrating a novel Wnt agonist function. In PEDF knockout (KO) mice, total body adiposity was increased by >50% compared with controls, illustrating its systemic role as a negative regulator of adipogenesis. Bones from KO mice demonstrated a reduction in mineral content recapitulating the OI type VI phenotype.

Eukaryotic integral membrane proteins insert, assemble, and mature at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Skach, 2009Skach W.R. Cellular mechanisms of membrane protein folding.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 606-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Membrane proteins that fail to mature are ubiquitinated by ER resident ubiquitin ligases and degraded by the proteasome in a process termed ER-associated degradation (ERAD) (Vembar and Brodsky, 2008Vembar S.S. Brodsky J.L. One step at a time: endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 944-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). ERAD pathways are also utilized for regulatory control of membrane proteins on the basis of cellular demand (Hampton, 2002Hampton R.Y. ER-associated degradation in protein quality control and cellular regulation.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, DeBose-Boyd, 2008DeBose-Boyd R.A. Feedback regulation of cholesterol synthesis: sterol-accelerated ubiquitination and degradation of HMG CoA reductase.Cell Res. 2008; 18: 609-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Thus, all newly synthesized membrane proteins are triaged between degradative and nondegradative fates at the ER. Proper triage is critical to cellular homeostasis and physiology. Failure to efficiently target misfolded proteins for degradation can lead to proteotoxicity, cell death, and disease (Chiti and Dobson, 2006Chiti F. Dobson C.M. Protein misfolding, functional amyloid, and human disease.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2006; 75: 333-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (5127) Google Scholar). Conversely, overaggressive surveillance would result in degradation of functional products and loss-of-function consequences (Grove et al., 2011Grove D.E. Fan C.Y. Ren H.Y. Cyr D.M. The endoplasmic reticulum-associated Hsp40 DNAJB12 and Hsc70 cooperate to facilitate RMA1 E3-dependent degradation of nascent CFTRDeltaF508.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2011; 22: 301-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Inappropriate triage of regulated factors can also lead to imbalanced expression levels with pathologic effects (DeBose-Boyd, 2008DeBose-Boyd R.A. Feedback regulation of cholesterol synthesis: sterol-accelerated ubiquitination and degradation of HMG CoA reductase.Cell Res. 2008; 18: 609-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Thus, achieving the correct balance in membrane protein triage is vital, but the mechanisms that regulate client discrimination are not well understood. A key step in triage between degradative and nondegradative fates is client ubiquitination by an ER-resident ubiquitin ligase (Hirsch et al., 2009Hirsch C. Gauss R. Horn S.C. Neuber O. Sommer T. The ubiquitylation machinery of the endoplasmic reticulum.Nature. 2009; 458: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). A polyubiquitin tag serves as a signal for downstream factors to extract the membrane protein and deliver it to the proteasome for degradation (Vembar and Brodsky, 2008Vembar S.S. Brodsky J.L. One step at a time: endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 944-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (1022) Google Scholar). The acquisition or not of polyubiquitin is therefore a deciding factor for client triage. The simplest model is one where clients destined for degradation are recruited to the ligase, whereas other proteins are not. This paradigm of discrimination, based solely on ligase access, is common in regulated degradation. For example, Sic1 is targeted for degradation only after phosphorylation generates a mark for ubiquitin ligase recruitment (Feldman et al., 1997Feldman R.M. Correll C.C. Kaplan K.B. Deshaies R.J. A complex of Cdc4p, Skp1p, and Cdc53p/cullin catalyzes ubiquitination of the phosphorylated CDK inhibitor Sic1p.Cell. 1997; 91: 221-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Although attractively simple, there are several reasons to suspect that ligase access alone cannot provide sufficient discriminatory power in quality control. First, quality control is usually thought to involve broad “surveillance” of many potential clients, with commitment for degradation of only a minor subset. Second, most quality-control ligases must recognize a highly diverse range of clients; not only are there numerous individual proteins, but each one can be misfolded in myriad ways. This means that a single “recognition motif” or degron is unlikely, placing constraints on the level of selectivity that can be achieved by simple interaction. And third, essentially all newly synthesized proteins are potential clients early in their biosynthesis before they have folded, assembled, and matured. Thus, the issue may be less about whether a client interacts with a ligase, but rather more subtle aspects of the nature of the interaction. Indeed, coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) and crosslinking studies show qualitatively similar ligase interactions for degraded and nondegraded versions of potential clients. For example, the client Hmg2p interacts with the ligase Hrd1p regardless of whether Hmg2p is subsequently degraded or not (Gardner et al., 2001Gardner R.G. Shearer A.G. Hampton R.Y. In vivo action of the HRD ubiquitin ligase complex: mechanisms of endoplasmic reticulum quality control and sterol regulation.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4276-4291Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, Sato et al., 2009Sato B.K. Schulz D. Do P.H. Hampton R.Y. Misfolded membrane proteins are specifically recognized by the transmembrane domain of the Hrd1p ubiquitin ligase.Mol. Cell. 2009; 34: 212-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Similarly, the ligase-client interactions for degraded and nondegraded forms of TCRα are also remarkably similar (Ishikura et al., 2010Ishikura S. Weissman A.M. Bonifacino J.S. Serine residues in the cytosolic tail of the T-cell antigen receptor alpha-chain mediate ubiquitination and endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of the unassembled protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 23916-23924Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, ligase access per se does not obligate client degradation; rather, a more nuanced model is needed to explain how modest differences in ligase interaction are converted to large differences in client fate. Efforts to study this process in mechanistic depth have been hampered by various challenges. In vitro systems to date are typically composed of microsomes (or semipermeabilized cells) combined with cytosol (Shamu et al., 1999Shamu C.E. Story C.M. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. The pathway of US11-dependent degradation of MHC class I heavy chains involves a ubiquitin-conjugated intermediate.J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, Nakatsukasa et al., 2008Nakatsukasa K. Huyer G. Michaelis S. Brodsky J.L. Dissecting the ER-associated degradation of a misfolded polytopic membrane protein.Cell. 2008; 132: 101-112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, Garza et al., 2009Garza R.M. Sato B.K. Hampton R.Y. In vitro analysis of Hrd1p-mediated retrotranslocation of its multispanning membrane substrate 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 14710-14722Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although the cytosol is experimentally accessible, the membrane components remain a challenge. Full control of reactions in the membrane requires the capacity to independently reconstitute purified client and ligase complexes. Unfortunately, a misfolded protein client poses considerable obstacles to expression, purification, and reconstitution. Furthermore, the multiple components and complex topology of ER-resident ligases (Hirsch et al., 2009Hirsch C. Gauss R. Horn S.C. Neuber O. Sommer T. The ubiquitylation machinery of the endoplasmic reticulum.Nature. 2009; 458: 453-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar) has thus far precluded their functional membrane reconstitution. Thus, it has not been possible to rigorously examine how the nature of client-ligase interactions in the membrane influences ubiquitination and commitment for degradation. To circumvent these issues, we turned to virus-mediated degradation of host membrane protein from the ER. Several viruses encode membrane proteins that exploit host ubiquitin ligases for regulated degradation of key cellular proteins (Isaacson and Ploegh, 2009Isaacson M.K. Ploegh H.L. Ubiquitination, ubiquitin-like modifiers, and deubiquitination in viral infection.Cell Host Microbe. 2009; 5: 559-570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Such systems have yielded key insights into ERAD previously and provide several attractive features for reconstitution studies. First, the client is not recognized on the basis of misfolding, meaning that a native protein amenable to recombinant production can be used. Second, the system is typically orthogonal to endogenous pathways and utilizes a single defined ligase. Third, viral systems are usually rapid, efficient, and robust. Thus, viral systems of regulated degradation often encapsulate the salient features of a physiologic process in a simplified format. In this study, we exploit these advantages to reconstitute with purified components the ubiquitination of CD4 by the HIV-encoded protein Vpu. The reconstituted system permitted quantitative mechanistic analysis to reveal key aspects of substrate discrimination and commitment for degradation. We discovered that modest differences in client-ligase interaction are converted into clear differences in polyubiquitination by a combination of processivity differences and deubiquitinases (DUBs) that impact the dwell time of a degradation mark on potential clients. These findings have implications for the mechanism underlying membrane protein triage and quality control at the ER. The HIV-encoded membrane protein Vpu interacts with CD4 at the ER and routes it for proteasomal degradation (reviewed by Nomaguchi et al., 2008Nomaguchi M. Fujita M. Adachi A. Role of HIV-1 Vpu protein for virus spread and pathogenesis.Microbes Infect. 2008; 10: 960-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar; Figure S1A available online). Although Vpu is not a ubiquitin ligase, its phosphorylation at two sites by casein kinase 2 (CK2) permits a high-affinity interaction with the SCFβTrCP ubiquitin ligase complex via its F-box protein βTrCP (Margottin et al., 1998Margottin F. Bour S.P. Durand H. Selig L. Benichou S. Richard V. Thomas D. Strebel K. Benarous R. A novel human WD protein, h-beta TrCp, that interacts with HIV-1 Vpu connects CD4 to the ER degradation pathway through an F-box motif.Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 565-574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Ligase recruitment to the ER leads to ubiquitination of the unstructured cytosolic tail of CD4. Phospho-Vpu therefore converts the nucleocytoplasmic SCFβTrCP complex into an ER ubiquitin ligase that mediates selective degradation of its CD4 client. Importantly, the basic features of this system work in various heterologous systems (Chen et al., 1993Chen M.Y. Maldarelli F. Karczewski M.K. Willey R.L. Strebel K.

Cell. 2004; 14: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), arguing against cell-type-specific features in CD4 degradation. The Vpu-mediated CD4 degradation pathway therefore affords a simplified model of membrane protein degradation whose mechanistic details may be amenable to dissection by in vitro reconstitution. Our strategy was to first define versions of CD4 and Vpu that differ in their membrane interactions and degradation and then use these model clients and nonclients to investigate the basis of substrate discrimination during membrane protein triage. CD4 expression in cultured cells was downregulated in a dose-dependent manner by coexpression of Vpu (Figure 1A). A phosphorylation site Vpu mutant (Vpu-SN; see Table S1 for construct details) was completely inactive (Figure S1B), as characterized in earlier work (Schubert and Strebel, 1994Schubert U. Strebel K. Differential activities of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1-encoded Vpu protein are regulated by phosphorylation and occur in different cellular compartments.J. Virol. 1994; 68: 2260-2271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Magadán et al., 2010Magadán J.G. Pérez-Victoria F.J. Sougrat R. Ye Y. Strebel K. Bonifacino J.S. Multilayered mechanism of CD4 downregulation by HIV-1 Vpu involving distinct ER retention and ERAD targeting steps.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1000869Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Changing three residues in the transmembrane domain (TMD) of Vpu (I17F/V21F/V25L, termed Vpu-M1) largely abolished its ability to downregulate CD4 (Figure 1A). Similar results were seen when the Vpu TMD was replaced with heterologous TMDs (Vpu-M2, and Vpu-M3; Figure S1C). Replacing the TMD of CD4 with heterologous TMDs (CD4-M1 and CD4-M2) also rendered it refractory to Vpu downregulation (Figure 1B) unless the heterologous TMD (CD4-M3) could interact with Vpu (Figure S1D). Importantly, the various CD4 and Vpu TMD mutant proteins were verified by fractionation experiments to be membrane inserted (data not shown). Results from the steady-state experiments with the M1 mutants were confirmed by pulse-chase analysis (Figure S1E). Thus, Phospho-Vpu-mediated CD4 degradation from the ER depends on features of the TMDs of both proteins (Magadán and Bonifacino, 2012Magadán J.G. Bonifacino J.S. Transmembrane domain determinants of CD4 Downregulation by HIV-1 Vpu.J. Virol. 2012; 86: 757-772Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). To examine the contribution of TMDs to the CD4-Vpu interaction, we performed co-IP experiments. The Vpu-SN phosphorylation mutant permitted interactions to be assessed in the absence of downstream degradation. As expected (Bour et al., 1995Bour S. Schubert U. Strebel K. The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpu protein specifically binds to the cytoplasmic domain of CD4: implications for the mechanism of degradation.J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1510-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Magadán et al., 2010Magadán J.G. Pérez-Victoria F.J. Sougrat R. Ye Y. Strebel K. Bonifacino J.S. Multilayered mechanism of CD4 downregulation by HIV-1 Vpu involving distinct ER retention and ERAD targeting steps.PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1000869Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), Vpu-SN coimmunoprecipitated CD4 (Figure 1C) and vice versa (Figure S1F). However, a qualitatively similar interaction by co-IP was also observed with TMD mutants of either Vpu or CD4 (Figures 1C, S1F, and S1G). Deleting the cytosolic domain of CD4 showed a marked (>80%), but not complete, loss in co-IP with Vpu (Figure 1C), consistent with an interaction between their cytosolic tails (Bour et al., 1995Bour S. Schubert U. Strebel K. The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vpu protein specifically binds to the cytoplasmic domain of CD4: implications for the mechanism of degradation.J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1510-1520Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Combining the CD4 cytosolic deletion with a Vpu TMD mutant abolished the interaction entirely (data not shown). Thus, the CD4-Vpu interaction is bipartite via both the cytosolic and TMD regions. The contribution of the TMD was judged to be relatively minor based on the modest ∼30% reduction in co-IP with the CD4 or Vpu M1 mutants (Figure 1D). This indicates that the TMD mutant proteins are engaged in CD4-Vpu complexes to at least 70% the level as the wild-type pair. Yet, phospho-Vpu-dependent CD4 degradation is almost completely lost (quantified in Figure 1D), suggesting that even small decreases in interaction are sufficient to effect a large change in degradation. This mirrors earlier observations with ER ubiquitin ligases, where degraded versus nondegraded versions of clients displayed surprisingly minor differences in ligase interaction (Gardner et al., 2001Gardner R.G.

Chem. 2010; 285: 23916-23924Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Thus, the Vpu-CD4 system and their TMD mutants provide a simple model system to dissect the mechanistic basis of selective degradation for subtly different client-ligase interactions in the membrane (Figure 1E). To facilitate in vitro reconstitution of Vpu-mediated CD4 ubiquitination, we isolated ER microsomes from cells expressing HA-tagged Vpu or phosphorylation-deficient Vpu-SN. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed that Vpu, but not Vpu-SN, was associated with the SCFβTrCP complex (Figure 2A). The Vpu-SCFβTrCP complex was completely stable to 0.8 M salt wash (Figure S2A), illustrating that this complex essentially behaves as an integral membrane ubiquitin ligase. Importantly, the microsomes were functional for protein translocation (Figure 2B), allowing 35S-labeled proteins to be introduced into them by in vitro translation.Figure S2Features of mCD4 Ubiquitination on Microsomes by Vpu, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Microsomes were isolated from HEK293 cells (‘control’), HEK293 cells expressing HA-tagged wild-type Vpu (‘WT-Vpu-HA’), or HEK293 cells expressing Vpu-SN (‘Vpu-SN-HA’) and subjected to high salt wash with 0.8 M KAc.

Note that polyubiquitination is sharply reduced by the K48R mutant ubiquitin. Given that Vpu has at most one or two residues in the ER lumen, we reasoned that the only relevant portion of CD4 for its selective ubiquitination was the TMD and cytosolic tail. A “mini-CD4” (mCD4) containing only these domains was constructed (Table S2) and verified to insert efficiently and correctly into ER microsomes by in vitro translation (Figure 2C). Although this construct does not contain a signal peptide, the TMD, now being positioned near the N terminus, acts as a type I signal anchor to mediate targeting and insertion (Higy et al., 2004Higy M. Junne T. Spiess M. Topogenesis of membrane proteins at the endoplasmic reticulum.Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 12716-12722Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Protease protection assays combined with IPs verified that mCD4 acquires the correct type I topology (Figure 2C). Appending an N-terminal glycosylation site to mCD4 resulted in mCD4 glycosylation (Figure 2C), corroborating its insertion by an independent means. Following mCD4 in vitro translation and insertion, microsomes were isolated and washed with 0.8 M salt to remove the cytosol and any noninserted mCD4. Next, ubiquitination reactions were initiated by adding purified E1 and E2 enzymes, together with tagged-ubiquitin and ATP. Ubiquitin pull-downs followed by visualization of the radiolabeled mCD4 revealed a ladder of ubiquitinated mCD4 (Figure 2D). Glycosylated mCD4 was also ubiquitinated (Figure 2D), verifying that membrane-inserted mCD4 was being modified. Ubiquitination was dependent on SCFβTrCP because a parallel reaction with phosphorylation-deficient Vpu-SN failed to be ubiquitinated (Figure 2D), consistent with its inability to coimmunoprecipitate SCFβTrCP (Figures 2A and S2A). Furthermore, the absolute dependence on phospho-Vpu illustrates that endogenous ligases in this system do not perceive mCD4 as a misfolded protein for ubiquitination. Optimal polyubiquitination was achieved using a mixture of UbcH3 and UbcH5 (Figure S2B), consistent with different E2 enzymes being optimal for initial ubiquitination versus chain elongation (Rodrigo-Brenni and Morgan, 2007Rodrigo-Brenni M.C.

Ubiquitination was not observed when the four lysines in the tail of CD4 were mutated to arginines (data not shown). Thus, the Vpu-SCFβTrCP ligase complex ubiquitinates mCD4 on isolated membranes in vitro, setting the stage for reconstitution with purified factors. The modularity of the Vpu-CD4 system afforded the opportunity to assemble it from individual recombinant factors in liposomes (Figure 3A). We expressed and purified mCD4 and Vpu from E. coli (Figure 3B), confirmed that purified Vpu can be phosphorylated efficiently by purified Casein Kinase 2 (CK2; data not shown), and that the cytosolic domain interacted efficiently with βTrCP in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (Figure S3A). We then optimized conditions for reconstitution of mCD4 and Vpu into synthetic liposomes such that most of it was incorporated in the correct orientation as determined by protease protection assays (Figure S3B). Co-IP experiments showed that when mCD4 and Vpu were coincorporated into the same liposomes, they interacted with each other (Figure 3C). By contrast, mixing separate liposomes each containing mCD4 or Vpu, followed by solubilization and IP, showed minimal interaction (Figure 3C).Figure S3Vpu Interactions, Topology, and Activity in Proteoliposomes, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A) His6-tagged cytosolic domains of Vpu or Vpu-SN were expressed and purified from E. coli and incubated with CK2 as indicated.

https://openalex.org/W2035522955,"Sox11 deletion mice are known to exhibit developmental defects of craniofacial skeletal malformations, asplenia, and hypoplasia of the lung, stomach, and pancreas. Despite the importance of Sox11 in the developing skeleton, the role of Sox11 in osteogenesis has not been studied yet. In this study, we identified that Sox11 is an important transcription factor for regulating the proliferation and survival of osteoblast precursor cells as well as the self-renewal potency of mesenchymal progenitor cells via up-regulation of Tead2. Furthermore, Sox11 also plays an important role in the segregation of functional osteoblast lineage progenitors from osteochondrogenic progenitors. Facilitation of osteoblast differentiation from mesenchymal cells was achieved by enhanced expression of the osteoblast lineage specific transcription factors Runx2 and Osterix. Morpholino-targeted disruption of Sox11 in zebrafish impaired organogenesis, including the bones, which were under mineralized. These results indicated that Sox11 plays a crucial role in the proliferation and survival of mesenchymal and osteoblast precursors by Tead2, and osteogenic differentiation by regulating Runx2 and Osterix.Background: Sox11 deletion mice exhibit developmental defects, yet the detailed roles of Sox11 in osteogenesis are unknown.Results: Sox11 stimulated proliferation and survival of mesenchymal and osteoblast precursor cells through up-regulation of Tead2, as well as stimulated osteogenesis via Runx2 and Osterix.Conclusion: Sox11 positively regulates osteogenesis.Significance: Novel functions of Sox11 and its target genes during osteogenesis were established. Sox11 deletion mice are known to exhibit developmental defects of craniofacial skeletal malformations, asplenia, and hypoplasia of the lung, stomach, and pancreas. Despite the importance of Sox11 in the developing skeleton, the role of Sox11 in osteogenesis has not been studied yet. In this study, we identified that Sox11 is an important transcription factor for regulating the proliferation and survival of osteoblast precursor cells as well as the self-renewal potency of mesenchymal progenitor cells via up-regulation of Tead2. Furthermore, Sox11 also plays an important role in the segregation of functional osteoblast lineage progenitors from osteochondrogenic progenitors. Facilitation of osteoblast differentiation from mesenchymal cells was achieved by enhanced expression of the osteoblast lineage specific transcription factors Runx2 and Osterix.

Conclusion: Sox11 positively regulates osteogenesis. Significance: Novel functions of Sox11 and its target genes during osteogenesis were established. The formation of vertebrate skeletal elements exclusively depends on the differentiation of two cell types, osteoblasts and chondrocytes, which are derived from common mesenchymal precursor cells (1.Hartmann C. Transcriptional networks controlling skeletal development.Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2009; 19: 437-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Several transcription factors contribute to the commitment of mesenchymal progenitors to osteogenesis. The crucial transcription factors shown to be involved in osteogenesis include runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), 2The abbreviations used are: Runx2, Runt-related transcription factor-2; HMG, high mobility group; Col1a1, TypeI collagen; Ocn, osteocalcin; Alp, alkaline phosphatase; BMP-2, bone morphogenic protein-2; PTH, parathyroid hormone; MO, morpholino oligonucleotide; PI, propidium iodide; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase.

For the commitment of mesenchymal stem cells to osteochondrogenic progenitors and osteoblast differentiation, another transcription factor Osterix is absolutely required (11.Lengner C.J. Hassan M.Q.

Osterix has been shown to specifically induce osteoblast differentiation and bone formation in vivo. Like Runx2-null mice, Osterix-null mice also exhibited a complete absence of bone matrix and osteoblasts. Osterix-deficient mice demonstrated a lack of mineralized matrix in only the bones formed by intramembranous ossification (11.Lengner C.J. Hassan M.Q. Serra R.W. Lepper C. van Wijnen A.J. Stein J.L.

The novel zinc finger-containing transcription factor osterix is required for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation.Cell. 2002; 108: 17-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2789) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Osterix was shown to be regulated by Runx2 in a Runx2-dependent and independent manner during osteoblast differentiation (14.Matsubara T. Kida K. Yamaguchi A. Hata K. Ichida F. Meguro H. Aburatani H. Nishimura R. Yoneda T. BMP2 regulates Osterix through Msx2 and Runx2 during osteoblast differentiation.J. Biol.

However, the upstream regulation thereof, except for Runx2, and the molecular mechanisms underlying the action of Osterix during osteogenesis are less understood. Sox genes encode transcription factors that contain a high mobility group (HMG), which interacts with DNA binding domains. Based on their protein specificity, Sox proteins are divided into eight different groups (SoxA-SoxH) (15.Schepers G.E. Teasdale R.D. Koopman P.

Origin and diversity of the SOX transcription factor gene family: genome-wide analysis in Fugu rubripes.Gene. 2004; 328: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Sox genes have also been identified as the master genes for the fate determination and cell survival of specific cell types (18.Bhattaram P. Penzo-Mendez A. Sock E. Colmenares C. Kaneko K.J. Vassilev A. Depamphilis M.L. Wegner M. Lefebvre V. Organogenesis relies on SoxC transcription factors for the survival of neural and mesenchymal progenitors.Nat. Commun. 2010; 1: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Mesenchymal progenitor cells give rise to many cell lineages including osteoblasts, chondrocytes, fibroblasts, adipocytes, and myocytes during organogenesis. Only a few studies have shown the molecular requirements for the self-renewality and lineage-specific decisions of mesenchymal and osteoblasts cells. The best known examples of genes involved in the fate decision of mesenchymal progenitor cells are Sox5, Sox6, and Sox9, which function together to specify the fate and differentiation of chondrocytes (19.Bi W. Deng J.M. Zhang Z. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Sox9 is required for cartilage formation.Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). The transcription factors Sox4, Sox11, and Sox12 belong to the SoxC gene family (20.Dy P. Penzo-Méndez A. Wang H. Pedraza C.E. Macklin W.B. Lefebvre V. The three SoxC proteins–Sox4, Sox11 and Sox12–exhibit overlapping expression patterns and molecular properties.Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 3101-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and share a high degree of identity in both the high-mobility-group domain and a group specific transactivation domain. In previous mouse embryonic studies, these three genes were shown to be highly and concomitantly expressed in multipotent neural and mesenchymal cells. Furthermore, specific inactivation of SoxC family genes demonstrated the essentiality of these genes in neural and mesenchymal progenitor survival (18.Bhattaram P. Penzo-Mendez A. Sock E. Colmenares C. Kaneko K.J. Vassilev A. Depamphilis M.L. Wegner M. Lefebvre V. Organogenesis relies on SoxC transcription factors for the survival of neural and mesenchymal progenitors.Nat.

Expression of the Sox11 gene in mouse embryos suggests roles in neuronal maturation and epithelio-mesenchymal induction.Dev. Dyn. 1997; 210: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). However, the detailed role of SoxC factors in specifying the fate and differentiation of osteoblasts has not yet been demonstrated. In a previous study, Sox11-deficient mice exhibited various craniofacial and skeletal malformations; Sox11 (+/−) mice were small in body size and asplenic, and 40% of these mice had a cleft palate or cleft lips, L4,5 vertebrae that were duplicated, and had a tail that was kinked (22.Sock E. Rettig S.D. Enderich J. Bösl M.R. Tamm E.R. Wegner M. Gene targeting reveals a widespread role for the high-mobility-group transcription factor Sox11 in tissue remodeling.Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 6635-6644Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). In these mice, the last two or three sternebrae as well as the xiphoid process were defective and irregularly mineralized. It was also shown that Sox4 (+/−) and Sox11 (−/−) embryos died around E10.5 (18.Bhattaram P. Penzo-Mendez A. Sock E. Colmenares C. Kaneko K.J. Vassilev A. Depamphilis M.L. Wegner M. Lefebvre V.

Cell Biol. 2004; 24: 6635-6644Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Also, limbs failed to bud, somites were rudimentary, and embryo growth was arrested at the development stage of E8.5 (18.Bhattaram P. Penzo-Mendez A. Sock E. Colmenares C. Kaneko K.J. Vassilev A. Depamphilis M.L. Wegner M. Lefebvre V. Organogenesis relies on SoxC transcription factors for the survival of neural and mesenchymal progenitors.Nat. Commun. 2010; 1: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Even though phenotypic evidence of skeletal malformations in Sox11 knock-out mice has already been shown, there are no detailed findings for the precise role of Sox11 in osteogenesis. In the present study, we demonstrated that Sox11 works as an important regulator of the proliferation and apoptosis of osteoblast precursor and early osteoblast lineage cells. Knockdown of Sox11 in primary calvaria cells reduced the expression of osteoblast fate specifying transcription factors, mainly Runx2 and Osterix. In vivo experiments with antisense morpholino oligonucleotide (MO)-mediated knock down of Sox11 in zebrafish revealed a significant decrease in bone formation and osteogenesis shown by alizarin red staining. Primary mouse calvaria cells and MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast cells were cultured in α-minimal essential medium (α-MEM) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS and 1× penicillin/streptomycin (Welgene, Korea). MC3T3-E1 and C3H10T1/2 cells were cultured in osteogenic differentiation medium containing growth medium and 10 mm β-glycerophosphate (Sigma) and 50 μg/ml l-ascorbic acid (Sigma). The recombinant proteins rhBMP-2, FGF-2, and hPTH were used as upstream growth factors (R&D Systems Inc). Primary calvaria cells used in this study were isolated from the parietal bones of 3–4 day neonatal mice calvaria (ICR) after serial digestion in 1× HBSS digestion medium containing 0.02% collagenase (Invitrogen), 0.05% trypsin (Invitrogen), and 0.53 mm EDTA (Invitrogen). The fractions containing primary cells were collected after the 3rd, 4th, and 5th digestions and these cells were passed through a cell strainer to separate traces of cell debris. Finally, these cells were cultured in α-MEM and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 and 95% air, and the medium was changed every 2–3 days until the cells reached full confluence. Adult ICR mice were housed in a temperature controlled condition (22 °C) under artificial illumination and standard humidity with access to food and water ad libitum. Embryos and postnatal pups were obtained from time-mated pregnant mice. The presence of a vaginal plug was confirmed as embryonic day 0 (E0). Embryos and tissue samples were harvested at different developmental stages. All animal procedures were approved by the institutional animal research committee. Total RNA was extracted from cells according to a standard protocol using the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). After RNA isolation, 2 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using random oligo dT primer and reverse transcriptase (Promega). For semi-quantitative PCR analysis, 1 μl of cDNA template was used. To study mRNA expression, the RT-PCR primers used in this study are Sox11 Forward-5′-AAGAACATCACCAAGCAGCA-3′; Reverse-5′-TCCAGGTCCTTATCCCACCAG-3′, Runx2 Forward-5′-CCGCACGACAACCGCACCAT-3′; Reverse-5′-CGCTCCGGCCCACAAATCTC-3′, Col1a1 Forward-5′-CATTAGGCGCAGGAAGGTCAGC-3′; Reverse-5′-GAGGCATAAAGGGTCGTGG-3′,Osterix Forward-5′-TGAGGAAGAAGCCCATTCAC-3′; Reverse-5′-ACTTCTTCTCCCGGGTGTG-3′, Osteocalcin Forward-5′-AAGCAGGAGGGCAATAAGGT-3′; Reverse-5′-TGCCAGAGTTTGGCTTTAGG-3′,Tead2 Forward-5′-CTGAGGACAGGGAAGACGAG-3′; Reverse-5′-CAGAGCTCCCTGACCAGAAC-3′, Yap Forward-5′-AGGAGAGACTGCGGTTGAAA-3′; Reverse-5′-TGCTGTAGCTGCTCATGCTG-3′, Birc5 Forward-5′-CATCGCCACCTTCAAGAACT-3′, Reverse-5′-CAGGGGAGTGCTTTCTATGC-3′, Actin Forward-5′-TTCAACACCCCAGCCATGT-3′; Reverse-5′-TGTGGTACGACCAGAGGCATAC-3′ and Real time-PCR primers used in this study are Sox11 Forward-5′-TCCCATCGTCTTCTTCTTCTTC-3′; Reverse-5′-TCACTGCATCCACATGGAATA-3′, Runx2 Forward-5′-CAGATGACATCCCCATCCATCC-3′; Reverse-5′-AAGTCAGAGGTGGCAGTGTC-3′, Osterix Forward-5′-CTGCTTGAGGAAGAAGCTCAC-3′; Reverse-5′-CTGAAAGGTCAGCGTATGGC-3′, Gapdh Forward-5′-AATGTGTCCGTCGTGGATCTG-3′; Reverse-5′-CAACCTGGTCCTCAGTGTAGC-3′. The cycle conditions for the PCR primers were as follows: Sox11, Osterix, and Ocn, 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for about 34 cycles; Col1a1, Tead2, and Runx2, 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for 29 cycles; β-Actin, 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for about 27 cycles. The initial denaturation cycle for the PCR reactions was 94 °C for 3 min and final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. All PCR products were separated on a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. For quantitative Real-time PCR (qPCR), Sox11, Runx2, Osterix, and Gapdh (Glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase) primers were designed and synthesized separately (Metabion international AG, Germany). The qPCR reactions were performed in triplicate in a 96-well plate using the standard protocol recommended by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) using power SYBR green PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems). The β-actin and Gapdh gene primers were used as endogenous controls for semi-quantitative PCR and qPCR, respectively. Relative expressions of all the genes were quantified using the Applied Biosystems 7500 software. The relative values of mRNA levels were showed from three replicates of a representative experiment. Protein samples were extracted from MC3T3-E1, primary calvaria cells, and bone tissues using protein cell lysis buffer (Intron Biotechnology, Korea), containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics Korea Co. Ltd.). After sonication of the cells in lysis buffer for 30–60 s, the protein extracts were centrifuged at 13000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min. The protein extracts were then separated by electrophoresis on a 12% acrylamide gel and then transferred to an activated PVDF membrane (Millipore, MA). The membrane was blocked in TBST buffer (TBS+0.1% Tween-20) containing 5% skim milk powder or bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with anti-Sox11 polyclonal antibody and anti-Runx2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Tead2 (Millipore), Osterix (Abcam), p-p53, caspase-3-cleaved (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) Bax, Bcl2 and anti-β-Actin monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) separately. After washing, the membranes were transferred to secondary antibody, HRP-conjugated anti-goat, anti-rabbit, and anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, the resultant antibody binding to the membrane was detected on x-ray film using an ECL chemiluminescence detection kit (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) following manufacturer's instructions. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining was performed in osteoblast differentiated cells after the cells were fixed in a citrate-acetone-formaldehyde solution (Sigma) for 30 s and washed once with deionized water at room temperature. These cells were then stained with an alkaline dye mixture prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions with an alkaline phosphatase staining kit (Sigma). The cells were incubated in the alkaline dye mixture for 1 h to overnight at 18–26 °C, and examined microscopically. To study the function of Sox11 in osteoblast cells, siRNA for Sox11 was used to transfect the cells. The oligonucleotide siRNAs for the mouse Sox11 used in this study were (GenBankTM accession No.NM_009234) siRNA-1: 5′-CACUCAUAACGUUCCAUGU (dTdT)-3′ (Sense); 5′-ACA UGG AAC GUU AUG AGU G(dTdT)-3′ (Antisense); siRNA-2: 5′-CAG GUA UGG GAC ACC UAGU(dTdT)-3′ (Sense); 5′-ACU AGG UGU CCCAUACCUG(dTdT)-3′ (Antisense); siRNA-3: 5′-CUGACUUAAGACCAGAGUU(dTdT)-3′ (Sense); 5′-AAC UCU GGU CUU AAG UCAG(dTdT)-3′ (Antisense) (Bioneer, Daejeon, Korea) and Tead2 siRNA was purchased from Origene Technologies (Rockville, MD). The effects of Sox11 and Tead2 siRNA were monitored by RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCR analysis after 72 h of transfection. MC3T3-E1 cells, primary calvaria cells, and C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in a 12-well dish, and grown to 70–80% confluence. The cells were then transfected with the Lipofectamine RNAi-Max transfection reagent as well as 50 picomol/ml of Sox11, Tead2, and control siRNA, according to the manufacturer's protocol with minor modifications (Invitrogen). Cell survival assay was performed after 72 h of siSox11 and control siRNA transfection in MC3T3-E1 and primary calvaria cells using a CCK-8 assay kit following the manufacturer's protocol (Dojindo Molecular Technologies). This assay was performed to determine the number of viable cells during cell proliferation. The number of viable cells was determined after siRNA transfection in a 12-well dish and washing of the cells with 1× PBS and trypsin-EDTA treatment. Finally, the cells were collected in 1 ml of growth medium and counted with a C-Chip DHC-NO1 disposable hemocytometer. An apoptotic assay was performed after knockdown of Sox11 followed by propidium iodide (PI) staining. Stained cells were visualized and photographed with a fluorescent microscope. For absolute quantification of the apoptotic cells, the PI-stained cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS-Calibur flow cytometry systems, Dickinson and Company). Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) cytotoxicity assay was performed after 72 h of Sox11 siRNA transfection in MC3T3-E1 and primary calvaria cells. The cytotoxicity effects after knockdown of Sox11 were evaluated by measuring LDH activity with a nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay kit following the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). Stable cytosolic LDH enzyme was released after cell lysis converted a tetrazolium salt into a red color formazan. The color formation was directly proportional to the number of lysed cells. Bone marrow cells were flushed from the femurs and tibias of 2-month-old mice, filtered, and seeded in two 35-mm dishes containing a minimum essential medium (α-MEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and a final concentration of 1× penicillin/streptomycin (Welgene Inc., Daegu, South Korea). The medium was replaced with fresh medium every 2 days. After 1 week in culture, bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells were trypsinized and seeded in a 6-well or 12-well dish for siSox11 and siTead2 transfection along with the control siRNA. After 48 h of transfection, the cells were seeded in a 35-mm dish for colony-forming unit fibroblast (CFU-F) assay, and after 7–10 days in cell culture, the cells were fixed and stained with crystal violet. The number and diameter of colonies (colony ≥15 number of cells) were counted and measured microscopically. The colony number showed as mean values from the three replicates of a representative experiment. MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast and C3H10T1/2 mesenchymal cells were used for ChIP assay. The protocol was slightly modified from the user manual of the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology). Crosslinking was performed on ∼80–100% confluent cells in a 10-cm dish using 1% formaldehyde in the culture medium mentioned above for specific cell types. Crosslinking was stopped by the addition of 2.5 m glycine for 2 min at room temperature, followed by washing of the cells with cold PBS and resuspension of the cells in 1 ml of ChIP lysis buffer. The resuspended cells were sonicated for 15 min in cycles of 10 s on and off at 4 °C. The sonicated product (∼500 bp) was then used as the input after reverse cross linking. The precleared lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Sox11 antibody (H-290 Sc-20096) and normal rabbit IgG at 4 °C overnight on a rocker. Immunoprecipitated DNA was collected and purified with pre-blocked A/G-agarose beads and subsequently eluted. This DNA was then analyzed by PCR with specific primers to identify the putative Sox11 binding element containing regions in the Osterix intron and Runx2 promoter. The chip primers used for Sox11 binding element regions on Runx2 promoter were M1; F.P: 5′-TCCAAGAGGGCAAAAGAAGA-3′, R.P: 5′-TCTTTCATCAGCGTGGACAG, M2; F.P: 5′-AGTCACTGTCCACGCTGATG-3′, R.P: 5′-TTTTATTACGTGGCGGCTCT-3′, M3:5′-TCCCCAGGCTAACACTTTTG-3′, R.P: 5′-ACTGAGTGTGTGGCGTTCTG-3′.The PCR conditions were optimized with each of the primer sets before Chip PCR was performed. Osterix intron DNA fragments were amplified from mouse genomic DNA, which were sequenced and cloned into TA cloning vectors (RBC Life Sciences). After sequencing, the fragments were sub cloned into pGL3-promoter vectors after digestion with the restriction enzymes KpnI/BglII. The Runx2 promoter construct used in this study was previously described by our group (23.Park S.J. Jung S.H. Jogeswar G. Ryoo H.M. Yook J.I. Choi H.S. Rhee Y. Kim C.H. Lim S.K. The transcription factor snail regulates osteogenic differentiation by repressing Runx2 expression.Bone. 2010; 46: 1498-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Point mutations at putative Sox11 binding sites were introduced with an Expand Long Range dNTPack kit (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) and point mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing before analyzing reporter activity. For luciferase reporter activity, MC3T3-E1 cells (3 × 104 cells/well) were seeded in 24-well plates before transfection. Transfection was performed with a mixture of 200 ng/well of each plasmid containing regulatory region and the Sox11 expression plasmid (a gift from Prof. M. Wegner) or a control vector, and 10 ng/well of pRL-TK plasmid as a transfection control were transfected with Lipofectamine plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase activity was measured in the cell lysates after 48 h of transfection using a Promega Dual Luciferase assay kit with a GLOMAX 20/20 luminometer. Zebrafish were raised under standard conditions at 28.5 °C with a light-dark cycle of 14/10 h. Zebrafish embryos were obtained from a cross between AB wild-type adults. These were cultured in embryonic water with methylene blue to inhibit fungal growth. Antisense morpholino oligonucleotides directed against zebrafish sox11 (sox11a Mo; 5′-CG CTGTTGTCCGTTTGCTGCACCAT-3′, sox11b Mo; 5′-CTGTGCTCCGTCTGCTGCACCA TGT-3′) and control Mo; 5′-CCTCTTACCTCAGTTACAATTTATA 3′ were obtained from Gene Tools, Inc. Morpholinos were solubilized in Danieau buffer to a final concentration of 1 mm, and ∼330 pg of morpholinos was injected into each zebrafish embryo at the 1- or 2-cell stage. The zebrafish embryos were then microinjected with control or a Sox11 specific morpholino oligomer. Microinjection of Sox11 morpholino was carried out under a dissection microscope (Leica) using a WPI microinjector and a picopump controller. In situ hybridization in 3–4 dpf zebrafish was performed using runx2a, runx2b, and osterix RNA probes described previously (30.Li N. Felber K. Elks P. Croucher P. Roehl H.H.

https://openalex.org/W1983587424,"Green leaf volatiles (GLVs) consisting of six-carbon aldehydes, alcohols, and their esters, are biosynthesized through the action of fatty acid hydroperoxide lyase (HPL), which uses fatty acid hydroperoxides as substrates. GLVs form immediately after disruption of plant leaf tissues by herbivore attacks and mechanical wounding and play a role in defense against attackers that attempt to invade through the wounds. The fates and the physiological significance of the counterparts of the HPL reaction, the 12/10-carbon oxoacids that are formed from 18/16-carbon fatty acid 13-/11-hydroperoxides, respectively, are largely unknown. In this study, we detected monogalactosyl diacylglycerols (MGDGs) containing the 12/10-carbon HPL products in disrupted leaf tissues of Arabidopsis, cabbage, tobacco, tomato, and common bean. They were identified as an MGDG containing 12-oxo-9-hydroxy-(E)-10-dodecenoic acid and 10-oxo-7-hydroxy-(E)-8-decenoic acid and an MGDG containing two 12-oxo-9-hydroxy-(E)-10-dodecenoic acids as their acyl groups. Analyses of Arabidopsis mutants lacking HPL indicated that these MGDGs were formed enzymatically through an active HPL reaction. Thus, our results suggested that in disrupted leaf tissues, MGDG-hydroperoxides were cleaved by HPL to form volatile six-carbon aldehydes and non-volatile 12/10-carbon aldehyde-containing galactolipids. Based on these results, we propose a novel oxylipin pathway that does not require the lipase reaction to form GLVs."
https://openalex.org/W2100553841,"Chrysin (5,7-dihydroxyflavone), a natural flavonoid widely distributed in plants, reportedly has chemopreventive properties against various cancers. However, the anticancer activity of chrysin observed in in vivo studies has been disappointing. Here, we report that a chrysin derivative, referred to as compound 69407, more strongly inhibited EGF-induced neoplastic transformation of JB6 P(+) cells compared with chrysin. It attenuated cell cycle progression of EGF-stimulated cells at the G1 phase and inhibited the G1/S transition. It caused loss of retinoblastoma phosphorylation at both Ser-795 and Ser-807/811, the preferred sites phosphorylated by Cdk4/6 and Cdk2, respectively. It also suppressed anchorage-dependent and -independent growth of A431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells. Compound 69407 reduced tumor growth in the A431 mouse xenograft model and retinoblastoma phosphorylation at Ser-795 and Ser-807/811. Immunoprecipitation kinase assay results showed that compound 69407 attenuated endogenous Cdk4 and Cdk2 kinase activities in EGF-stimulated JB6 P(+) cells. Pulldown and in vitro kinase assay results indicated that compound 69407 directly binds with Cdk2 and Cdk4 in an ATP-independent manner and inhibited their kinase activities. A binding model between compound 69407 and a crystal structure of Cdk2 predicted that compound 69407 was located inside the Cdk2 allosteric binding site. The binding was further verified by a point mutation binding assay. Overall results indicated that compound 69407 is an ATP-noncompetitive cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor with anti-tumor effects, which acts by binding inside the Cdk2 allosteric pocket. This study provides new insights for creating a general pharmacophore model to design and develop novel ATP-noncompetitive agents with chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic potency."
https://openalex.org/W2156997485,"Hypertension is regulated through both the central and systemic renin-angiotensin systems. In the central renin-angiotensin system, zinc-dependent aminopeptidase A (APA) up-regulates blood pressure by specifically cleaving the N-terminal aspartate, but not the adjacent arginine, from angiotensin II, a process facilitated by calcium. Here, we determined the crystal structures of human APA and its complexes with different ligands and identified a calcium-binding site in the S1 pocket of APA. Without calcium, the S1 pocket can bind both acidic and basic residues through formation of salt bridges with the charged side chains. In the presence of calcium, the binding of acidic residues is enhanced as they ligate the cation, whereas the binding of basic residues is no longer favorable due to charge repulsion. Of the peptidomimetic inhibitors of APA, amastatin has higher potency than bestatin by fitting better in the S1 pocket and interacting additionally with the S3' subsite. These results explain the calcium-modulated substrate specificity of APA in central hypertension regulation and can guide the design and development of brain-targeting antihypertensive APA inhibitors."

We hypothesized that strain-induced release of HB-EGF and TGF-α is mediated via integrin-ADAM17/TACE interactions. Employing an in vitro system to simulate mechanical forces in fetal lung development, we showed that mechanical strain of fetal epithelial cells actives TACE, releases HB-EGF and TGF-α, and promotes differentiation. In contrast, in samples incubated with the TACE inhibitor IC-3 or in cells isolated from TACE knock-out mice, mechanical strain did not release ligands or promote cell differentiation, which were both rescued after transfection of ADAM17. Cell adhesion assay and co-immunoprecipitation experiments in wild-type and TACE knock-out cells using several TACE constructs demonstrated not only that integrins α6 and β1 bind to TACE via the disintegrin domain but also that mechanical strain enhances these interactions. Furthermore, force applied to these integrin receptors by magnetic beads activated TACE and shed HB-EGF and TGF-α. The contribution of integrins α6 and β1 to differentiation of fetal epithelial cells by strain was demonstrated by blocking their binding site with specific antibodies and by culturing the cells on membranes coated with anti-integrin α6 and β1 antibodies.

https://openalex.org/W2021978386,"The FK506-binding protein (FKBP) family of peptidyl-prolyl isomerases (PPIases) is characterized by a common catalytic domain that binds to the inhibitors FK506 and rapamycin. As one of four FKBPs within the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Fpr4 has been described as a histone chaperone, and is in addition implicated in epigenetic function in part due to its mediation of cis-trans conversion of proline residues within histone tails. To better understand the molecular details of this activity, we have determined the solution structure of the Fpr4 C-terminal PPIase domain by using NMR spectroscopy. This canonical FKBP domain actively increases the rate of isomerization of three decapeptides derived from the N terminus of yeast histone H3, whereas maintaining intrinsic cis and trans populations. Observation of the uncatalyzed and Fpr4-catalyzed isomerization rates at equilibrium demonstrate Pro(16) and Pro(30) of histone H3 as the major proline targets of Fpr4, with little activity shown against Pro(38). This alternate ranking of the three target prolines, as compared with affinity determination or the classical chymotrypsin-based fluorescent assay, reveals the mechanistic importance of substrate residues C-terminal to the peptidyl-prolyl bond."

https://openalex.org/W2058150442,"Heterotrimeric G proteins play an essential role in cellular signaling; however, the mechanism regulating their synthesis and assembly remains poorly understood. A line of evidence indicates that the posttranslational processing of G protein β subunits begins inside the protein-folding chamber of the chaperonin containing t-complex protein 1. This process is facilitated by the ubiquitously expressed phosducin-like protein (PhLP), which is thought to act as a CCT co-factor. Here we demonstrate that alternative splicing of the PhLP gene gives rise to a transcript encoding a truncated, short protein (PhLPs) that is broadly expressed in human tissues but absent in mice. Seeking to elucidate the function of PhLPs, we expressed this protein in the rod photoreceptors of mice and found that this manipulation caused a dramatic translational and posttranslational suppression of rod heterotrimeric G proteins. The investigation of the underlying mechanism revealed that PhLPs disrupts the folding of Gβ and the assembly of Gβ and Gγ subunits, events normally assisted by PhLP, by forming a stable and apparently inactive tertiary complex with CCT preloaded with nascent Gβ. As a result, the cellular levels of Gβ and Gγ, which depends on Gβ for stability, decline. In addition, PhLPs evokes a profound and rather specific down-regulation of the Gα transcript, leading to a complete disappearance of the protein.

Conclusion: Both G protein α and βγ functional units are subject to the regulation. Significance: We describe a potential mechanism for regulating the cellular levels of G proteins. Heterotrimeric G proteins are a conserved group of molecules involved in a great number of signaling processes in eukaryotes (1.Lagerström M.C. Schiöth H.B. Structural diversity of G protein-coupled receptors and significance for drug discovery.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2008; 7: 339-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). Although much is known about G protein-mediated signaling, far less is known about G protein biogenesis. All heterotrimeric G proteins are composed of α, β, and γ subunits encoded by distinct genes. In humans, 16 genes code for Gα, 12 genes code for Gγ, and five genes code for Gβ. The mechanisms underlying the process of selection and assembly of these subunits into mature G proteins remain unknown. Evidently, the folding of nascent G protein β polypeptides requires the direct assistance of chaperonin containing t-complex protein 1 (CCT 2The abbreviations used are: CCTchaperonin containing t-complex protein 1PhLPphosducin-like proteinPhLPsphosducin-like protein short isoformTCP-1t-complex protein 1qPCRquantitative PCR. ; also known as TRiC) (2.Willardson B.M.

Chaperonin CCT is a large, cylindrically shaped ATPase complex composed of two stacked rings. Each ring is made of eight t-complex protein 1 (TCP-1) subunits, designated α–θ in mammals (5.Muñoz I.G.

In its open conformation, the substrate proteins are allowed to enter the central cavity. Nucleotide binding occurs once the substrate is bound, and ATP hydrolysis triggers the conversion from the open to the closed conformation (5.Muñoz I.G. Yébenes H. Zhou M. Mesa P. Serna M. Park A.Y.

The exact mechanism by which CCT folds the substrate proteins has not been clearly defined, but it is thought to involve a set of sequential, hierarchical steps. The CCT substrates identified thus far are all soluble proteins, diverse in functions and structures (7.Thulasiraman V. Yang C.F. Frydman J.

Thus, one commonality among PhLP1 to -3 is that they all participate in protein folding by acting as co-chaperones of CCT (2.Willardson B.M. Howlett A.C.

Alternative splicing of the PhLP1 gene in rats gives rise to two distinct transcripts, 297 and 218 amino acids long. A product of a short transcript was originally designated as phosducin-like protein short isoform (PhLPs) (28.Miles M.F. Barhite S. Sganga M. Elliott M. Phosducin-like protein.

Essentially the same transcript was later detected in the human retina and named phosducin-like orphan protein 1 (PHLOP1) (29.Craft C.M. Xu J. Slepak V.Z. Zhan-Poe X. Zhu X. Brown B. Lolley R.N.

To gain a better understanding of this important function, we ectopically expressed PhLPs in mouse rods, photoreceptor neurons of the retina that maintain very high levels of the heterotrimeric G protein, transducin (Gαt1β1γ1). We found that PhLPs disrupted several steps in the biosynthesis of rod transducin, which could also be observed in cell culture models. PhLPs specifically targeted the chaperonin CCT preloaded with nascent Gβ1. In contrast to the full-length PhLP, which facilitated the assembly of the Gβ1γ1 heterodimer, PhLPs disrupted this process by trapping Gβ1 inside the chaperonin. In addition, PhLPs evoked a strong and specific transcriptional suppression of Gαt1. This study, thus, provides the first evidence that the short isoform of PhLP can act as a negative regulator of the synthesis and assembly of heterotrimeric G proteins in vivo. Transgenic mice expressing Δ1–83PhLP-FLAG have been previously described (32.Posokhova E. Song H. Belcastro M. Higgins L. Bigley L.R. Michaud N.A. Martemyanov K.A. Sokolov M. Disruption of the chaperonin containing TCP-1 function affects protein networks essential for rod outer segment morphogenesis and survival.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2011; 10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All analyses were performed using Δ1–83PhLP-FLAG+/− and Δ1–83PhLP-FLAG−/− littermates at postnatal day 10, according to the procedures approved by the animal care and use committees of West Virginia University. The alternatively spliced PhLP transcripts were detected in the Human Total RNA Master Panel II (Clontech). One microgram from each RNA sample was reverse transcribed using random hexamers and RNase H(−) reverse transcriptase. The region of the phosducin-like protein gene (PDCL) containing exon 2 was amplified with primers located in exons 1 (PDCL_1-F, 6-FAM-TGACCCACTGCTCTTCCTCT) and 3 (PDCL_1-R, GATGGGACCTGCAAGTCATT). The forward primer carries a 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-FAM) fluorescent tag attached to its 5′-end. The resulting fluorescently labeled products were resolved using denaturing polyacrylamide electrophoresis and imaged on a Typhoon imager (GE Healthcare) in the fluorescence mode. To measure the levels of mRNA in the retina, RNA was isolated from single retinas using the Absolutely RNA Miniprep kit (Agilent Technologies), according to the manufacturer's protocol for small samples and including two DNase treatments. The final RNA concentration was determined using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies). Using a two-step quantitative RT-PCR process, cDNA from each retina was generated from 5 ng of total RNA using the AffinityScript qPCR cDNA synthesis kit (Agilent Technologies) and oligo(dT) primers. Negative controls included no reverse transcriptase and no RNA template. Quantitative real-time PCR experiments were performed in triplicate with 0.5 ng of cDNA using the Brilliant II SYBR® Green qPCR master mix (Agilent Technologies), reference dye, and a 200 nm concentration of each primer. Reactions were incubated at 95 °C for 10 min and then cycled 27 times at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 30 s using a Stratagene Mx3000PTM real-time PCR system. A melting curve analysis was added at the end to verify a single product from each reaction, and the fluorescence was recorded during every qPCR cycle at both the annealing step (55 °C) and the extension step (72 °C). Fluorescence values were analyzed using MxPro qPCR software version 4.10, and amplification thresholds were normalized to those of GAPDH. Primers for mouse Gnat1, Gnb1, Gnb5, and Gngt1 were designed using GenBankTM mouse mRNA sequences and PrimerQuest software and selected to amplify products crossing exon-exon boundaries. The primers were synthesized and HPLC-purified by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Primer concentrations were optimized for each reaction prior to running the quantitative RT-PCR experiments. The primer sequences used were as follows: Gnat1, 5′-TGC CAT CAT CTA CGG CAA CAC TCT-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTT GGG CAT TGT GCC TTC CTC AAT-3′ (reverse); Gnb1, 5′-AGA ATC CAA ATG CGG ACC AGG AGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACC ACA GGC CAC ATA ATT CCC AGA-3′ (reverse); Gnb5, 5′- ACC AGA AGG ACC CTC AAA GG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCA TGT CAG AGT TGG TGA AGC-3′ (reverse); Gngt1, 5′-TGC CAG TGA TCA ACA TCG AAG ACC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCA CAC AGC CTC CTT TGA GTT CCT-3′ (reverse); GAPDH, 5′-GAC TTC AAC AGC AAC TCC CAC-3′ (forward) and 5′-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA-3′ (reverse). Retinas were collected at postnatal day 10 and frozen on dry ice. Each retina was homogenized in 0.2 ml of buffer containing 125 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, and 6 m urea by short ultrasonic pulses, and the resulting extract was cleared by centrifugation. The total protein concentration was determined on a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. To prepare SDS-PAGE samples, the protein concentration in each of the compared samples was adjusted to the same value, and bromphenol blue tracking dye and 5% β-mercaptoethanol were added. Typically, 10-μl samples from Tg(+) and Tg(−) littermates were separated side by side on a 10–20% Tris/HCl acrylamide gel (Bio-Rad). Quantification of the specific bands was performed using an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's protocols. Data from three independent measurements utilizing at least three mice of each genotype each time were averaged. Total RNA were isolated from the retina using the Absolutely RNA Miniprep kit, and its quality was assessed with Bioanalyzer (both from Agilent Technologies). Samples were processed using an Affymetrix GeneChip whole transcript sense target labeling assay and hybridized to Affymetrix Mouse Exon 1.0 ST microarrays according to the manufacturer's instructions. Microarrays were analyzed using GeneBase software as described previously (33.Xing Y. Kapur K. Wong W.H. Probe selection and expression index computation of affymetrix exon arrays.PloS One. 2006; 1: e88Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 34.Kapur K. Xing Y. Ouyang Z. Wong W.H. Exon arrays provide accurate assessments of gene expression.Genome Biol. 2007; 8: R82Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). GeneBase estimates the gene expression levels based on probes with highly correlated signals across multiple samples, thus reducing the bias from cross-hybridizing probes or probes located in alternative exons. To take advantage of the probe selection algorithm of GeneBase, we combined our mouse retina arrays with the Affymetrix mouse exon 1.0 ST mouse tissue panel, which contains 33 arrays hybridized to samples from 11 tissues. p values were adjusted using Benjamini-Hochberg's procedure. Δ1–83PhLP-FLAG was captured from the retinas with anti-FLAG-agarose and vacuum-dried, as described previously (32.Posokhova E. Song H. Belcastro M. Higgins L. Bigley L.R. Michaud N.A. Martemyanov K.A. Sokolov M. Disruption of the chaperonin containing TCP-1 function affects protein networks essential for rod outer segment morphogenesis and survival.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2011; 10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A pull-down from 70 retinas was sent to Applied Biomics, Inc. (Hayward, CA), which conducted two-dimensional PAGE separation, protein identification in the spots by LC/MS/MS, and data analysis. In another experiment, a pull-down from 150 retinas was dissolved in buffer containing 125 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 6 m urea, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and bromphenol blue tracking dye and subjected to a standard SDS-PAGE separation on a 12.5% Tris/HCl gel (Bio-Rad). Following a short run, the gel was stained with Colloidal Coomassie (LC 6025, Invitrogen), and the entire lane was excised from the gel and cut into identical fragments. The proteins in each gel fragment were digested with trypsin and analyzed by microcapillary reverse-phase HPLC nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry (μLC/MS/MS) on the Thermo LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer at the Harvard Mass Spectrometry and Proteomic Resource Laboratory (Cambridge, MA). The acquired MS/MS spectra were correlated with known sequences using programs developed in this laboratory (35.Chittum H.S. Lane W.S. Carlson B.A. Roller P.P. Lung F.D. Lee B.J. Hatfield D.L. Rabbit β-globin is extended beyond its UGA stop codon by multiple suppressions and translational reading gaps.Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10866-10870Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) and the Sequest algorithm (40.Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates 3rd, J.R. An approach to correlate tandem mass spectral data of peptides with amino acid sequences in a protein database.J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5419) Google Scholar). The data were analyzed to reach an estimated false discovery rate of ∼1% using a reverse database strategy. When a peptide sequence could be assigned to more than one protein, the assignment was made to the protein that had accumulated the most peptide spectra; thus, no peptide spectrum was ever assigned to more than one protein. Mouse phosducin-like protein with a C-terminal FLAG tag (PhLP-FLAG) was prepared by reverse transcription of total retinal RNA from a 129/SV mouse using the gene-specific primer 5′-ACT AAA TGA GAC TAC AA, followed by PCR with the following primers: forward primer, 5′-GAG ACC ATG GCA ATG ACA ACC CTG GAT GAT AAG TTA CTG; reverse primers, 5′-CTT GTC ATC GTC GTC CTT GTA ATC ATC TAT TTC CAG ATC GCT GTC TTC and 5′-GCC TGG ATC CCT ACT ACT TGT CAT CGT CGT CCT TGT AAT C. The product was cut with NcoI and BamHI restriction endonucleases and inserted into the pTriEx4 expression vector (Novagen) at these sites. To utilize the potential for a Kozak sequence at the NcoI site and 5′-end of PhLP-FLAG, a few additional bases needed to be added, thereby expressing PhLP-FLAG with an additional methionine and alanine at the N terminus. PhLPs (Δ1–83PhLP-FLAG) was subcloned from pRhop4.4k-Δ1–83PhLP (32.Posokhova E. Song H. Belcastro M. Higgins L. Bigley L.R. Michaud N.A. Martemyanov K.A. Sokolov M. Disruption of the chaperonin containing TCP-1 function affects protein networks essential for rod outer segment morphogenesis and survival.Mol. Cell Proteomics. 2011; 10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) using PCR and the following primers to add a C-terminal FLAG tag: forward primer, 5′-GAG ACC ATG GAG CGG CTG ATC AAA AAG CTG TC T ATG AG; reverse primer, 5′-GCC TGG ATC CCT ACT ACT TGT CAT CGT CGT CCT TGT AAT C. The product was cut with NcoI and BamHI restriction endonucleases and inserted into the pTriEx4 vector at these sites. The coding sequence of mouse Pdc was subcloned from another vector in our laboratory, pSC-A Kozak/Pdc/FLAG, using PCR and the following primers: forward primer, 5′-GAG ACC ATG GAA GAA GCC GCC AGC CAA AGC; reverse primer, 5′-GGG CCT CTC GAG TTC AAT GTC CTC GTC TTC CAT GTT G. The product and pTriEx4 vector were digested with NcoI and XhoI restriction endonucleases and ligated at these sites to generate a Pdc construct that would be expressed with a C-terminal His6 epitope tag. Human rod transducin β (Gβ1) cDNA was amplified from a human retinal cDNA library (a kind gift from Dr. Jeremy Nathans, Johns Hopkins University) and subcloned into the EcoRI and NotI restriction sites in the pCMV-myc vector to create Gβ1 with an N-terminal myc epitope tag (Clontech). Similar to the transducin β subunit, human rod transducin Gγ1 with an N-terminal HA epitope tag was generated using the NcoI (partial digestion) and XhoI sites in the pCMV-HA vector (Clontech). The integrity of all constructs was confirmed by sequence analysis. HEK 293 cells (ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/Ham's F-12 (50:50 mixture) medium (Mediatech, Inc.), supplemented with 10% defined fetal bovine serum (HyClone) and 1× penicillin-streptomycin-l-glutamine (Invitrogen) or 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.292 mg/ml l-glutamine. For the transfection, cells were plated in 10-cm plates, so they would be at least 50% confluent the following"
