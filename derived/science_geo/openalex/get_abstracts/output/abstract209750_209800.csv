https://openalex.org/W2026337324,"A variant of human lactate dehydrogenase is described. The occurrence of lactate dehydrogenase-1, -2, -3, and -4 as five, four, three, and two components, respectively, is interpreted as supporting the hypothesis that LDH isozymes are tetramers formed from various combinations of two types of subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1982627994,"Ultrafiltrates of human myoglobin from 200 individuals were examined by starch-gel electrophoresis. Only two variants, Mb Aberdeen and Mb Annapolis , of the commonly occurring myoglobin Mb + were encountered. Each variant is apparently inherited as an autosomal codominant. Heterozygotes for either mutation lack apparent muscular disease. Combined electrophoresis and chromatography of Mb Annapolis indicate a loss of arginine at a position near the C-terminal portion of the molecule."

Studies with inhibitors of respiration, oligomycin, and uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation indicate that the energy necessary for these reactions may be provided either in the form of ATP in the absence of electron transport, or in the form of a high-energy intermediate of oxidative phosphorylation, which operates even though ATP is not produced."

https://openalex.org/W2085272259,"Local anesthetics, injected into the spinal extradural space, can be recovered from the spinal cord and brain. Transport from the extradural space into the neuraxis is independent of an active circulation. Distribution is greatest in the periphery of the cord and is most intense near the site of injection. The drugs probably diffuse into the subperineural spaces of the mixed nerves and then pass centripetally along the spinal roots into the cerebrospinal fluid and the cord."

With a lethal subcutaneous dose of approximately 0.14 micrograms for a 20-gram mouse, it is, along with saxitoxin and tetrodotoxin, one of the most toxic nonprotein substances known."

Their heart rate increased and the period of apnea between breathing cycles decreased. Small animals had a slightly greater mean uptake per gram than those five to ten times as large."

If treatment was delayed until the day of onset of encephalomyelitis, the disease was still suppressed and the death rate was reduced. The protective effect of methotrexate was reversed by folinic acid."

The administration of histamine increased gastric acidity."

https://openalex.org/W2061757396,Combinations of 6-thioguanine and uracil mustard produced greater inhibition of the growth of sarcoma 180 than that equivalent to the sum of the inhibitory effects caused by the optimum levels of the individual drugs. This potentiation was accomplished without marked weight loss by the host. Some possible biochemical mechanisms responsible for the drug synergy are discussed.

https://openalex.org/W2051621070,A PRECISE method of chronic implantation of large electrodes into brain structures is to locate the generator of a signal and then to place the electrodes in a manner which will record the maximum electrical activity. Freeman1 has developed such a method for implanting into the prepyriform cortex utilizing the electrical field produced in this area by electrical activation of the lateral olfactory tract. This method was adapted for chronically implanting bipolar electrodes into the olfactory bulb of cats.
https://openalex.org/W1979035996,"IN his letter defining ‘social homeostasis’ Mackintosh1 has referred to the uniformity of first crosses of inbred strains as compared with the parental stocks citing the monograph by Lerner2 and the more recent review by Biggers, McLaren and Michie3. These authors are perhaps influenced by their genetic theories. The results of experiments performed by Dobzhansky and Wallace4 justify their conclusions that “homeostatic adjustments are superior in heterozygotes to those in homozygotes”. However, Lerner himself points out that most other experimental work cannot provide unequivocal evidence on the role of heterozygosity in developmental homeostasis as “even when the phenotypic F1 variance is lower than the parental average, the reduction may have been due to the genetic and not to the environmental component”."
