https://openalex.org/W2003797386,"An unbiased approach for the genome-wide detection of off-target cleavage by CRISPR-Cas9 RNA–guided nucleases reveals wide variability in the off-target activity of different guide RNAs. CRISPR RNA-guided nucleases (RGNs) are widely used genome-editing reagents, but methods to delineate their genome-wide, off-target cleavage activities have been lacking. Here we describe an approach for global detection of DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) introduced by RGNs and potentially other nucleases. This method, called genome-wide, unbiased identification of DSBs enabled by sequencing (GUIDE-seq), relies on capture of double-stranded oligodeoxynucleotides into DSBs. Application of GUIDE-seq to 13 RGNs in two human cell lines revealed wide variability in RGN off-target activities and unappreciated characteristics of off-target sequences. The majority of identified sites were not detected by existing computational methods or chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). GUIDE-seq also identified RGN-independent genomic breakpoint 'hotspots'. Finally, GUIDE-seq revealed that truncated guide RNAs exhibit substantially reduced RGN-induced, off-target DSBs. Our experiments define the most rigorous framework for genome-wide identification of RGN off-target effects to date and provide a method for evaluating the safety of these nucleases before clinical use."
https://openalex.org/W2156653081,"Recent research with face-to-face groups found that a measure of general group effectiveness (called “collective intelligence”) predicted a group’s performance on a wide range of different tasks. The same research also found that collective intelligence was correlated with the individual group members’ ability to reason about the mental states of others (an ability called “Theory of Mind” or “ToM”). Since ToM was measured in this work by a test that requires participants to “read” the mental states of others from looking at their eyes (the “Reading the Mind in the Eyes” test), it is uncertain whether the same results would emerge in online groups where these visual cues are not available. Here we find that: (1) a collective intelligence factor characterizes group performance approximately as well for online groups as for face-to-face groups; and (2) surprisingly, the ToM measure is equally predictive of collective intelligence in both face-to-face and online groups, even though the online groups communicate only via text and never see each other at all. This provides strong evidence that ToM abilities are just as important to group performance in online environments with limited nonverbal cues as they are face-to-face. It also suggests that the Reading the Mind in the Eyes test measures a deeper, domain-independent aspect of social reasoning, not merely the ability to recognize facial expressions of mental states."
https://openalex.org/W2056197193,"Mild hyperuricemia has been linked to the development and progression of tubulointerstitial renal damage. However the mechanisms by which uric acid may cause these effects are poorly explored. We investigated the effect of uric acid on apoptosis and the underlying mechanisms in a human proximal tubule cell line (HK-2). Increased uric acid concentration decreased tubule cell viability and increased apoptotic cells in a dose dependent manner (up to a 7-fold increase, p<0.0001). Uric acid up-regulated Bax (+60% with respect to Ctrl; p<0.05) and down regulated X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein. Apoptosis was blunted by Caspase-9 but not Caspase-8 inhibition. Uric acid induced changes in the mitochondrial membrane, elevations in reactive oxygen species and a pronounced up-regulation of NOX 4 mRNA and protein (p<0.05). In addition, both reactive oxygen species production and apoptosis was prevented by the NADPH oxidase inhibitor DPI as well as by Nox 4 knockdown. URAT 1 transport inhibition by probenecid and losartan and its knock down by specific siRNA, blunted apoptosis, suggesting a URAT 1 dependent cell death. In summary, our data show that uric acid increases the permissiveness of proximal tubule kidney cells to apoptosis by triggering a pathway involving NADPH oxidase signalling and URAT 1 transport. These results might explain the chronic tubulointerstitial damage observed in hyperuricaemic states and suggest that uric acid transport in tubular cells is necessary for urate-induced effects."
https://openalex.org/W2044357199,"In angiosperm organelles, cytidines are converted to uridines by a deamination reaction in the process termed RNA editing. The C targets of editing are recognized by members of the pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein family. Although other members of the editosome have begun to be identified, the enzyme that catalyzes the C-U conversion is still unknown. The DYW motif at the C terminus of many PPR editing factors contains residues conserved with known cytidine deaminase active sites; however, some PPR editing factors lack a DYW motif. Furthermore, in many PPR-DYW editing factors, the truncation of the DYW motif does not affect editing efficiency, so the role of the DYW motif in RNA editing is unclear. Here, a chloroplast PPR-DYW editing factor, quintuple editing factor 1 (QED1), was shown to affect five different plastid editing sites, the greatest number of chloroplast C targets known to be affected by a single PPR protein. Loss of editing at the five sites resulted in stunted growth and accumulation of apparent photodamage. Adding a C-terminal protein tag to QED1 was found to severely inhibit editing function. QED1 and RARE1, another plastid PPR-DYW editing factor, were discovered to require their DYW motifs for efficient editing. To identify specific residues critical for editing, conserved deaminase residues in each PPR protein were mutagenized. The mutant PPR proteins, when expressed in qed1 or rare1 mutant protoplasts, could not complement the editing defect. Therefore, the DYW motif, and specifically, the deaminase residues, of QED1 and RARE1 are required for editing efficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2016802652,"Oxidative stress can induce premature cellular senescence. Senescent cells secrete various growth factors and cytokines, such as IL-6, that can signal to the tumor microenvironment and promote cancer cell growth. Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1) is a class III histone deacetylase that regulates a variety of physiological processes, including senescence. We found that caveolin-1, a structural protein component of caveolar membranes, is a direct binding partner of Sirt1, as shown by the binding of the scaffolding domain of caveolin-1 (amino acids 82–101) to the caveolin-binding domain of Sirt1 (amino acids 310–317). Our data show that oxidative stress promotes the sequestration of Sirt1 into caveolar membranes and the interaction of Sirt1 with caveolin-1, which lead to inhibition of Sirt1 activity. Reactive oxygen species stimulation promotes acetylation of p53 and premature senescence in wild-type but not caveolin-1 null mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Either down-regulation of Sirt1 expression or re-expression of caveolin-1 in caveolin-1 null MEFs restores reactive oxygen species-induced acetylation of p53 and premature senescence. In addition, overexpression of caveolin-1 induces stress induced premature senescence in p53 wild-type but not p53 knockout MEFs. Phosphorylation of caveolin-1 on tyrosine 14 promotes the sequestration of Sirt1 into caveolar membranes and activates p53/senescence signaling. We also identified IL-6 as a caveolin-1-specific cytokine that is secreted by senescent fibroblasts following the caveolin-1-mediated inhibition of Sirt1. The caveolin-1-mediated secretion of IL-6 by senescent fibroblasts stimulates the growth of cancer cells. Therefore, by inhibiting Sirt1, caveolin-1 links free radicals to the activation of the p53/senescence pathway and the protumorigenic properties of IL-6."
https://openalex.org/W2072815676,"NUT midline carcinoma (NMC) is a rare but highly aggressive cancer typically caused by the translocation t(15;19), which results in the formation of the BRD4-NUT fusion oncoprotein. Previous studies have demonstrated that fusion of the NUT protein with the double bromodomains of BRD4 may significantly alter the cellular gene expression profile to contribute to NMC tumorigenesis. However, the mechanistic details of this BRD4-NUT function remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined the NUT function in transcriptional regulation by targeting it to a LacO transgene array integrated in U2OS 2-6-3 cells, which allow us to visualize how NUT alters the in situ gene transcription dynamic. Using this system, we demonstrated that the NUT protein tethered to the LacO locus recruits p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP), induces histone hyperacetylation, and enriches BRD4 to the transgene array chromatin foci. We also discovered that, in BRD4-NUT expressed in NMC cells, the NUT moiety of the fusion protein anchored to chromatin by the double bromodomains also stimulates histone hyperacetylation, which causes BRD4 to bind tighter to chromatin. Consequently, multiple BRD4-interacting factors are recruited to the NUT-associated chromatin locus to activate in situ transgene expression. This gene transcription function was repressed by either expression of a dominant negative inhibitor of the p300-NUT interaction or treatment with (+)-JQ1, which dissociates BRD4 from the LacO chromatin locus. Our data support a model in which BRD4-NUT-stimulated histone hyperacetylation recruits additional BRD4 and interacting partners to support transcriptional activation, which underlies the BRD4-NUT oncogenic mechanism in NMC."
https://openalex.org/W2129407162,"Importance Comorbidities are common in COPD, but quantifying their burden is difficult. Currently there is a COPD-specific comorbidity index to predict mortality and another to predict general quality of life. We sought to develop and validate a COPD-specific comorbidity score that reflects comorbidity burden on patient-centered outcomes. Materials and Methods Using the COPDGene study (GOLD II-IV COPD), we developed comorbidity scores to describe patient-centered outcomes employing three techniques: 1) simple count, 2) weighted score, and 3) weighted score based upon statistical selection procedure. We tested associations, area under the Curve (AUC) and calibration statistics to validate scores internally with outcomes of respiratory disease-specific quality of life (St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, SGRQ), six minute walk distance (6MWD), modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea score and exacerbation risk, ultimately choosing one score for external validation in SPIROMICS. Results Associations between comorbidities and all outcomes were comparable across the three scores. All scores added predictive ability to models including age, gender, race, current smoking status, pack-years smoked and FEV1 (p<0.001 for all comparisons). Area under the curve (AUC) was similar between all three scores across outcomes: SGRQ (range 0·7624–0·7676), MMRC (0·7590–0·7644), 6MWD (0·7531–0·7560) and exacerbation risk (0·6831–0·6919). Because of similar performance, the comorbidity count was used for external validation. In the SPIROMICS cohort, the comorbidity count performed well to predict SGRQ (AUC 0·7891), MMRC (AUC 0·7611), 6MWD (AUC 0·7086), and exacerbation risk (AUC 0·7341). Conclusions Quantifying comorbidity provides a more thorough understanding of the risk for patient-centered outcomes in COPD. A comorbidity count performs well to quantify comorbidity in a diverse population with COPD."
https://openalex.org/W1978387067,"Various types of cyanobacterial mats were predominant in a wetland, constructed for the remediation of oil-polluted residual waters from an oil field in the desert of the south-eastern Arabian Peninsula, although such mats were rarely found in other wetland systems. There is scarce information on the bacterial diversity, spatial distribution and oil-biodegradation capabilities of freshwater wetland oil-polluted mats. Microbial community analysis by Automated Ribosomal Spacer Analysis (ARISA) showed that the different mats hosted distinct microbial communities. Average numbers of operational taxonomic units (OTUsARISA) were relatively lower in the mats with higher oil levels and the number of shared OTUsARISA between the mats was <60% in most cases. Multivariate analyses of fingerprinting profiles indicated that the bacterial communities in the wetland mats were influenced by oil and ammonia levels, but to a lesser extent by plant density. In addition to oil and ammonia, redundancy analysis (RDA) showed also a significant contribution of temperature, dissolved oxygen and sulfate concentration to the variations of the mats’ microbial communities. Pyrosequencing yielded 282,706 reads with >90% of the sequences affiliated to Proteobacteria (41% of total sequences), Cyanobacteria (31%), Bacteriodetes (11.5%), Planctomycetes (7%) and Chloroflexi (3%). Known autotrophic (e.g. Rivularia) and heterotrophic (e.g. Azospira) nitrogen-fixing bacteria as well as purple sulfur and non-sulfur bacteria were frequently encountered in all mats. On the other hand, sequences of known sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRBs) were rarely found, indicating that SRBs in the wetland mats probably belong to yet-undescribed novel species. The wetland mats were able to degrade 53–100% of C12–C30 alkanes after 6 weeks of incubation under aerobic conditions. We conclude that oil and ammonia concentrations are the major key players in determining the spatial distribution of the wetland mats’ microbial communities and that these mats contribute directly to the removal of hydrocarbons from oil field wastewaters."
https://openalex.org/W1987347300,"The angiotensin II type I (AT1R) and the prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) F prostanoid (FP) receptors are both potent regulators of blood pressure. Physiological interplay between AT1R and FP has been described. Abdominal aortic ring contraction experiments revealed that PGF2α-dependent activation of FP potentiated angiotensin II-induced contraction, whereas FP antagonists had the opposite effect. Similarly, PGF2α-mediated vasoconstriction was symmetrically regulated by co-treatment with AT1R agonist and antagonist. The underlying canonical Gαq signaling via production of inositol phosphates mediated by each receptor was also regulated by antagonists for the other receptor. However, binding to their respective agonists, regulation of receptor-mediated MAPK activation and vascular smooth muscle cell growth were differentially or asymmetrically regulated depending on how each of the two receptors were occupied by either agonist or antagonist.

HEK 293 cells were plated in poly-l-ornithine-coated 24-well plates at a density of 100,000 cells per well. After 24–48 h, cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS, and binding buffer was added (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2% (g/ml) BSA) in the presence of 100,000 cpm of either 125I-Ang II or [3H]PGF2α and increasing concentrations of cold ligand (Ang II or PGF2α, in half-log increments) in a final volume of 0.5 ml. Nonspecific binding was assessed in the presence of 10 μm cold Ang II (AT1R) or PGF2α (FP). To assess allosteric interactions, 1 μm PGF2α or Ang II or 2 μm L158,809 or AS604872 was used in parallel with both radioligand and cold ligand. Binding was performed overnight at 4 °C. Cells were then washed three times with ice-cold PBS, detached with 0.2 m NaOH for 10 min at room temperature, and solubilized in immunoprecipitation buffer for protein quantification for 10 min at room temperature. Radioactivity was quantified using a γ-counter (125I), or lysates were added to 5 ml of scintillation liquid and counted in a β-counter (3H). Transfected HEK 293 cells were washed once with PBS, detached with PBS/EDTA (5 mm) for 5 min at 37 °C, and centrifuged (500 × g for 5 min). The supernatant was removed, and the cell pellet was homogeneously resuspended in complete binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2% (g/ml) BSA, with 1× protease inhibitor) at a concentration of 50 μg of protein/300 μl.

[3H]PGF2α or 125I-Ang II dissociation was initiated by adding 100 μl of 125 μm Ang II or PGF2α, respectively, resulting in a final concentration of 25 μm cold ligand in 500 μl of complete binding buffer. Binding was quenched at time 0, 1, 2.5, 5, 15, and 30 min (each in triplicate) following the addition of cold ligand by diluting the cells with 3 ml of cold binding buffer and then immediately filtering. Filters were washed twice with 3 ml of cold binding buffer. Total and nonspecific binding (each in triplicate) were assessed by equilibrating the cells (50 μg) with 100,000 cpm of hot ligand in 500 μl for 2 h in the absence or presence of 25 μm cold ligand, respectively. Radioactive signal was counted using either a γ-counter (125I) or with scintillation liquid in a β-counter (3H). AT1R, AT1R/FP, or VSMCs were photolabeled as described previously (16Servant G. Laporte S.A. Leduc R. Escher E. Guillemette G. Identification of angiotensin II-binding domains in the rat AT2 receptor with photolabile angiotensin analogs.J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were incubated at room temperature for 90 min with 1 nm [125I-Sar1,Bpa8]Ang II in 500 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 2 mg/ml BSA) with or without cold Ang II (1 μm). After three washes, cells were resuspended in binding buffer and irradiated with UV light for 30 min at 0 °C. Cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol) containing 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 μg/ml leupeptin, 2.5 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm pepstatin, and 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and after lysis, the clarified cellular lysate was subjected to immunoprecipitation with pooled anti-FP (clones 6D12, 7D2, 8E9, 9G3, and 10G10) monoclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C. Protein G-agarose beads were then added for another 4 h. After three washes with lysis buffer, incorporation was quantified using a γ-counter (PerkinElmer Life Sciences Cobra Auto-Gamma). The specific counts/min for photoaffinity labeling was calculated as follow: (cpm from the total photoaffinity labeling with 1 nm [125I-Sar1,Bpa8]Ang II) − (cpm from the nonspecific photoaffinity labeling with 1 nm [125I-Sar1,Bpa8]Ang II in the presence of 1 μm Ang II). The net counts/min for immunoprecipitation were calculated as follow: (specific cpm from the protein G-agarose beads in the presence of anti monoclonal antibody) − ((specific cpm from the protein G-agarose beads in the absence of anti monoclonal antibody) + (blank cpm)). In some experiments, immunoprecipitates were solubilized in Laemmli buffer and run on 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried before autoradiography for 5–14 days on a Typhoon FLA 9500 biomolecular imager. To detect and analyze interactions between AT1R and FP, BRET was used as described previously (18Wrzal P.K. Devost D. Pétrin D. Goupil E. Iorio-Morin C. Laporte S.A. Zingg H.H. Hébert T.E. Allosteric interactions between the oxytocin receptor and the β2-adrenergic receptor in the modulation of ERK1/2 activation are mediated by heterodimerization.Cell. Signal. 2012; 24: 342-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). For this purpose, HEK 293 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and transfected with a fixed amount of an FP receptor tagged at its C terminus with Renilla luciferase (FP-RLuc) and co-transfected with an increasing amount of plasmids encoding AT1R or GABA-B2 (the latter as a negative control), both tagged at their C terminus with YFP (AT1R-YFP, GABAB2-YFP). Cells were assayed 48 h post-transfection. After the addition of the substrate coelenterazine h, emission was measured using an injector-equipped plate reader spectrofluorometer (Synergy 2 from BioTek) at the wavelengths of 485 and 528 nm, corresponding to the maxima of the emission spectra for RLuc and YFP, respectively. For confocal microscopy, 48 h after transfection, HEK 293 cells were serum-starved for 30 min, and imaging was performed using a Zeiss LSM-510 Meta laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) equipped with XL-3 temperature chamber with a ×63 glycerol/water immersion lens. Image acquisition was done in single track mode using 514 and 543 nm excitation wavelengths and using BP530–600 and LP560 emission filter sets for Venus/YFP and mRFP, respectively. Co-localization between Venus/YFP and mRFP was calculated with Pearson's correlation coefficient, using the JaCoP (Just another Co-localization Plugin) plugin in ImageJ (19Bolte S. Cordelières F.P. A guided tour into subcellular co-localization analysis in light microscopy.J. Microsc. 2006; 224: 213-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (3234) Google Scholar). For each image, a region of interest was drawn to calculate the Pearson's correlation coefficient; for all nonstimulated cells, the membrane, where the Venus/YFP signal was most abundant, was chosen. For stimulated cells, the region of interest was chosen where a maximum of endocytic Venus/YFP-labeled vesicles was found. VSMCs were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 15,000 cells/well in triplicate. After 24 h without serum, cells were treated as indicated in the figure legends for an additional 24 h. The last 8 h of stimulation, 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine or [3H]leucine was added per well. Cells were then put on ice and washed once with PBS and incubated 15 min in 5% trichloroacetic acid. Cells were lysed in 0.2 m NaOH, and the incorporated radioactivity was counted using a β-counter. Vessel constriction was studied ex vivo as described previously (20Thorin E. Functional cross-talk between endothelial muscarinic and α2-adrenergic receptors in rabbit cerebral arteries.Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 1188-1193Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Segments of the abdominal aorta (2 mm in length) were isolated from 3-month-old C57BL/6 mice mounted on 20-μm tungsten wires in small vessel myographs, stretched to optimal isometric tension, and maintained in physiological saline solution (PSS: NaCl, 119 mm; KCl, 4.7 mm; KH2PO4, 1.18 mm; MgSO4, 1.17 mm; NaHCO3, 25 mm; CaCl2, 1.6 mm; EDTA, 0.023 mm; glucose, 10 mm; aerated with 12% O2, 5% CO2, 83% N2; pH 7.4) at 37 °C. In these experimental conditions, arterial rings have no resting tone. After a 40-min stabilization period, arterial segments were challenged with 40 mm KCl PSS (KCl was substituted for an equivalent concentration of NaCl). Single cumulative concentration-response curves to Ang II (0.1 nm to 0.3 μm) and PGF2α (0.1 nm to 10 μm) were obtained from independent segments. To determine the impact of activation of the FP on angiotensin-dependent contraction, segments were preincubated with a threshold constricting concentration of PGF2α (1 μm) followed 20 min later by a dose-response curve to Ang II. To then assess whether the occupancy alone of the FP could modulate Ang II-induced contraction, arterial segments were preincubated with either one of the antagonists of FP, AS604872 (1 μm), or AL-8810 (10 μm), followed 20 min later by a dose-response curve to Ang II. Finally, to assess the effects of the activation and the occupation of AT1R on PGF2α-induced contraction, arterial segments were preincubated with Ang II (10 nm) and L158,809 (1 μm), respectively, followed 20 min later by a dose-response curve to PGF2α. The data were expressed as a percentages of contraction induced by 40 mm KPSS. Student's t tests were performed to compare concentration-response curves. Preincubation with the L158,809 had no effects on the resting tension. More importantly, preincubation with Ang II and PGF2α did not increase tone (0.0 ± 0.0%, n = 4, and 0.06 ± 0.02%, n = 5, respectively). VSMCs or stable FP cells (transiently co-transfected with increasing amounts of FLAG-AT1R) were starved for 30 min at 37 °C and stimulated or not with 100 nm PGF2α or Ang II in the presence of absence of different ligands as described in individual figures. Immunoblotting was then performed with anti-p-ERK1/2 or anti-total ERK1/2, For p-ERK1/2 and total ERK1/2 semi-quantitative analysis by densitometry, the ImageJ program was used. The p-ERK1/2 signal was normalized to total ERK1/2, and fold over basal activation was calculated. This assay was performed as described previously (21Zimmerman B. Beautrait A. Aguila B. Charles R. Escher E. Claing A. Bouvier M. Laporte S.A. Differential β-arrestin-dependent conformational signaling and cellular responses revealed by angiotensin analogs.Sci. Signal. 2012; 5: ra33Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Briefly, VSMCs were grown in 10-cm dishes for 24 h. The cells were then starved without serum. The next day, cells were washed once with PBS and collected in PBS containing 20 mm EDTA. For the assay, 104 cells per well (384-well plate) were used. Cells were first pretreated for 30 min at 37 °C with vehicle, 20 μm L158,809, or 10 μm AL-8810 or AS604872. Cells were then treated with increasing concentrations of PGF2α or Ang II for 60 min at 37 °C. IP1-d2 and anti-IP1-cryptate were added for an additional 2 h at room temperature. Plates were read on a Synergy 2 multimode microplate reader. All graphs are represented as the mean value ± S.E. Intensity of the signals from Western blots and FRET experiments was determined by densitometric analysis with ImageJ. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism software with one-way analysis of variance (Table 1 and FIGURE 2, FIGURE 7) or two-way analysis of variance (Figs. 1, 3, and 6) and, when appropriate, with Bonferroni (comparison between all or selected groups) post hoc tests. A two-tailed p value lower than 0.05 was considered significant.TABLE 1Ki values for [3H]PGF2α or 125I-labeled Ang II binding in doubly stable FP/AT1R HEK 293 cellsUsed receptor partnerRadioligand[3H]PGF2α on FP125I-Labeled Ang II on AT1RnmnmNone4.79 ± 1.351.94 ± 0.63AT1R unoccupied1.85 ± 0.62ap < 0.01 was compared with None for [3H]PGF2α binding.L158,809-bound AT1R1.63 ± 0.91ap < 0.01 was compared with None for [3H]PGF2α binding.Ang II-bound AT1R1.78 ± 0.92ap < 0.01 was compared with None for [3H]PGF2α binding.FP unoccupied1.20 ± 0.57AS604872-bound FP0.48 ± 0.35bp < 0.01 was compared with None for 125I-labeled Ang II binding.PGF2α-bound FP0.68 ± 0.16cp < 0.05.a p < 0.01 was compared with None for [3H]PGF2α binding.b p < 0.01 was compared with None for 125I-labeled Ang II binding.c p < 0.05.

https://openalex.org/W1998292182,"Saliva functions in innate immunity of the oral cavity, protecting against demineralization of teeth (i.e. dental caries), a highly prevalent infectious disease associated with Streptococcus mutans, a pathogen also linked to endocarditis and atheromatous plaques. Gel-forming mucins are a major constituent of saliva. Because Muc19 is the dominant salivary gel-forming mucin in mice, we studied Muc19−/− mice for changes in innate immune functions of saliva in interactions with S. mutans. When challenged with S. mutans and a cariogenic diet, total smooth and sulcal surface lesions are more than 2- and 1.6-fold higher in Muc19−/− mice compared with wild type, whereas the severity of lesions are up to 6- and 10-fold higher, respectively. Furthermore, the oral microbiota of Muc19−/− mice display higher levels of indigenous streptococci. Results emphasize the importance of a single salivary constituent in the innate immune functions of saliva. In vitro studies of S. mutans and Muc19 interactions (i.e. adherence, aggregation, and biofilm formation) demonstrate Muc19 poorly aggregates S. mutans. Nonetheless, aggregation is enhanced upon adding Muc19 to saliva from Muc19−/− mice, indicating Muc19 assists in bacterial clearance through formation of heterotypic complexes with salivary constituents that bind S. mutans, thus representing a novel innate immune function for salivary gel-forming mucins.

https://openalex.org/W2000934030,"Fish aggregating devices, or FADs, are used widely in developing countries to concentrate pelagic fish, making them easier to catch. Nearshore FADs anchored close to the coast allow access for rural communities, but despite their popularity among policy makers, there is a dearth of empirical analysis of their contributions to the supply of fish and to fisheries management. In this paper we demonstrate that nearshore FADs increased the supply of fish to four communities in Solomon Islands. Estimated total annual fish catch ranged from 4300 to 12 000 kg across the study villages, with nearshore FADs contributing up to 45% of the catch. While it is clear that FADs increased the supply of fish, FAD catch rates were not consistently higher than other fishing grounds. Villages with limited access to diverse or productive fishing grounds seemingly utilized FADs to better effect. Villagers believed FADs increased household income and nutrition, as well as providing a source of fish for community events. FADs were also perceived to increase intra-household conflict and reduce fishers' participation in community activities. FADs need to be placed within a broader rural development context and treated as another component in the diversified livelihoods of rural people; as with other livelihood options they bring trade-offs and risks."
https://openalex.org/W2098983142,"Given the established role of Chlamydia spp. as causative agents of both acute and chronic diseases, search for new antimicrobial agents against these intracellular bacteria is required to promote human health. Isoflavones are naturally occurring phytoestrogens, antioxidants and efflux pump inhibitors, but their therapeutic use is limited by poor water-solubility and intense first-pass metabolism. Here, we report on effects of isoflavones against C. pneumoniae and C. trachomatis and describe buccal permeability and initial formulation development for biochanin A. Biochanin A was the most potent Chlamydia growth inhibitor among the studied isoflavones, with an IC50 = 12 µM on C. pneumoniae inclusion counts and 6.5 µM on infectious progeny production, both determined by immunofluorescent staining of infected epithelial cell cultures. Encouraged by the permeation of biochanin A across porcine buccal mucosa without detectable metabolism, oromucosal film formulations were designed and prepared by a solvent casting method. The film formulations showed improved dissolution rate of biochanin A compared to powder or a physical mixture, presumably due to the solubilizing effect of hydrophilic additives and presence of biochanin A in amorphous state. In summary, biochanin A is a potent inhibitor of Chlamydia spp., and the in vitro dissolution results support the use of a buccal formulation to potentially improve its bioavailability in antichlamydial or other pharmaceutical applications."
https://openalex.org/W1964719485,"Aquifer ecosystems provide a range of important services including clean drinking water. These ecosystems, which are largely inaccessible to humans, comprise a distinct invertebrate fauna (stygofauna), which is characterized by narrow distributions, high levels of endemism and cryptic species. Although being under enormous anthropogenic pressure, aquifers have rarely been included in conservation planning because of the general lack of knowledge of species diversity and distribution. Here we use molecular sequence data and phylogenetic diversity as surrogates for stygofauna diversity in aquifers of New South Wales, Australia. We demonstrate how to incorporate these data as conservation features in the systematic conservation planning software Marxan. We designated each branch of the phylogenetic tree as a conservation feature, with the branch length as a surrogate for the number of distinct characters represented by each branch. Two molecular markers (nuclear 18S ribosomal DNA and mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I) were used to evaluate how marker variability and the resulting tree topology affected the site-selection process. We found that the sites containing the deepest phylogenetic branches were deemed the most irreplaceable by Marxan. By integrating phylogenetic data, we provide a method for including taxonomically undescribed groundwater fauna in systematic conservation planning."
https://openalex.org/W2042844661,"The present study explored the impact of dietary isoleucine (Ile) on fish growth and flesh quality and revealed a possible role of muscle antioxidant defense in flesh quality in relation to dietary Ile. Grass carp (weighing 256.8±3.5 g) were fed diets containing six graded levels of Ile (3.8, 6.6, 9.3, 12.5, 15.2 and 18.5 g/kg) for eight weeks. The results indicated that compared with Ile deficiency (3.8 g/kg diets) and excess (18.5 g/kg diets) groups, 9.3–15.2 g Ile/kg diet supplementations promoted fish growth and muscle fat deposition, whereas 6.6–15.2 g Ile/kg diets supplementation enhanced muscle nutrients (protein and total EAAs) deposition. Furthermore, muscle shear force, pH value, and hydroxyproline concentration were improved by 9.3–12.5, 9.3 and 9.3 g Ile/kg diet supplementations, respectively. However, muscle cooking loss, lactate content, and activities of cathepsin B and L were decreased by 6.6–15.2, 9.3–12.5, 9.3–12.5 and 9.3–15.2 g Ile/kg diet supplementations, respectively. Additionally, 6.6–15.2 and 6.6–12.5 g Ile/kg diet supplementations attenuated malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl contents, respectively. The activities of copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione content were enhanced by 6.6–9.3, 6.6–12.5 and 6.6–15.2 g Ile/kg diet supplementations, respectively. Moreover, the relative mRNA expressions of antioxidant enzymes, including Cu/Zn-SOD (6.6–12.5 g/kg diets) and GPx (12.5 g/kg diets), as well as antioxidant-related signaling molecules, including NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) (6.6–12.5 g/kg diets), target of rapamycin (6.6–12.5 g/kg diets), ribosomal S6 protein kinase 1 (9.3–12.5 g/kg diets) and casein kinase 2 (6.6–12.5 g/kg diets), were up-regulated when Ile diet supplementations were administered at these levels, respectively, whereas the relative mRNA expression of Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 was down-regulated with 9.3 g Ile/kg diet supplementations. Collectively, the present study indicated that optimum isoleucine improved flesh quality, partly due to the activation of antioxidant defense through the Nrf2 signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1987416126,"Objectives To study the body mass index (BMI) trajectory in patients with incident end-stage kidney disease and its association with all-cause mortality. Methods This longitudinal cohort study included 17022 adult patients commencing hemodialysis [HD] (n = 10860) or peritoneal dialysis [PD] (n = 6162) between 2001 and 2008 and had ≥6-month follow-up and ≥2 weight measurements, using the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry data. The association of time-varying BMI with all-cause mortality was explored using multivariate Cox regression models. Results The median follow-up was 2.3 years. There was a non-linear change in the mean BMI (kg/m2) over time, with an initial decrease from 27.6 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 27.5, 27.7) to 26.7 (95% CI: 26.6, 26.9) at 3-month, followed by increments to 27.1 (95% CI: 27, 27.2) at 1-year and 27.2 (95% CI: 26.8, 27.1) at 3-year, and a gradual decrease subsequently. The BMI trajectory was significantly lower in HD patients who died than those who survived, although this pattern was not observed in PD patients. Compared to the reference time-varying BMI category of 25.1–28 kg/m2, the mortality risks of both HD and PD patients were greater in all categories of time-varying BMI <25 kg/m2. The mortality risks were significantly lower in all categories of time-varying BMI >28.1 kg/m2 among HD patients, but only in the category 28.1–31 kg/m2 among PD patients. Conclusions BMI changed over time in a non-linear fashion in incident dialysis patients. Time-varying measures of BMI were significantly associated with mortality risk in both HD and PD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2039652202,"Background Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown origin, characterized by erosions and new bone formation. Diagnosis of PsA is mainly clinical and there are no biomarkers available. Moreover in PsA autoantibodies have not been described so far. Indeed an autoimmune origin has been suggested but never proven. Aim of the study was to investigate the possible presence of autoantibodies typically associated with PsA. Methods We used pooled IgG immunoglobulins derived from 30 patients with PsA to screen a random peptide library in order to identify disease relevant autoantigen peptides. Results Among the selected peptides, one was recognised by nearly all the patients’ sera. The identified peptide (PsA peptide: TNRRGRGSPGAL) shows sequence similarities with skin autoantigens, such as fibrillin 3, a constituent of actin microfibrils, desmocollin 3, a constituent of the desmosomes and keratin 78, a component of epithelial cytoskeleton. Interestingly the PsA peptide shares homology with the nebulin-related anchoring protein (N-RAP), a protein localized in the enthesis (point of insertion of a tendon or ligament to the bone), which represents the first affected site during early PsA. Antibodies affinity purified against the PsA peptide recognize fibrillin, desmocollin, keratin and N-RAP. Moreover antibodies directed against the PsA peptide are detectable in 85% of PsA patients. Such antibodies are not present in healthy donors and are present in 13/100 patients with seroposive rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In seronegative RA these antibodies are detectable only in 3/100 patients. Conclusions Our results indicate that PsA is characterized by the presence of serum autoantibodies crossreacting with an epitope shared by skin and joint antigens."
https://openalex.org/W1980751636,"The prevalence of allergic rhinitis (AR) in China has increased with an apparent geographic variation. The current study aims to investigate the AR prevalence/classification, diagnosis/treatment conditions, trigger factors, and risk factors in the general population of Guangzhou, the third biggest city in China. A cross-sectional survey was performed in the citizens in Guangzhou from December 2009 to March 2010 by using a stratified multistage cluster sampling method. All subjects were asked to complete a comprehensive questionnaire via a face to face interview. A total of 9,899 questionnaires were valid. The prevalence rate of AR in the general population of Guangzhou was 6.24%, with a significant higher prevalence in urban area (8.32%) versus rural area (3.43%). Among the AR subjects, most (87%) were diagnosed with intermittent AR and 87% suffered from moderate-severe symptoms. High percentages of the AR patients did not have previously physician-based diagnosis (34%) or specific medical treatment (55%). Morning time, winter season, and cold air were the most common trigger factors of AR. Family history of AR, current living place, living place during babyhood, smoking, home renovation, and pet ownership were the significant risk factors associated with AR prevalence in the population. The study demonstrated comprehensive epidemiological and clinical information about the AR in Guangzhou population.

https://openalex.org/W2023421690,"Background Routine Outcome Monitoring (ROM) is used as a means to enrich the process of treatment with feedback on patient outcomes, facilitating patient involvement and shared decision making. While traditional ROM measures focus on retrospective accounts of symptoms, novel mHealth technology makes it possible to collect real life, in-the-moment ambulatory data that allow for an ecologically valid assessment of personalized and contextualized emotional and behavioural adjustment in the flow daily life (mROM). Method In a sample of 34 patients with major depressive disorder, treated with antidepressants, the combined effect of treatment and natural course was examined over a period of 18 weeks with Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). EMA consisted of repeated, within-subject, mini-measurements of experience (eg positive affect, negative affect, medication side effects) and context (eg stressors, situations, activities) at 10 unselected semi-random moments per day, for a period of six days, repeated three times over the 18-week period (baseline, week 6 and week 18). Results EMA measures of emotional and behavioural adjustment were sensitive to the effects of treatment and natural course over the 18-week period, particularly EMA measures focussing on positive mood states and the ability to use natural rewards (impact of positive events on positive mood states), with standardized effect sizes of 0.4–0.5. EMA measures of activities, social interaction, stress-sensitivity and negative mood states were also sensitive to change over time. Conclusion This study supports the use of mROM as a means to involve the patient in the process of needs assessment and treatment. EMA data are meaningful to the patient, as they reflect daily life circumstances. Assessment of treatment response with mROM data allows for an interpretation of the effect of treatment at the level of daily life emotional and social adjustment – as an index of health, obviating the need for an exclusive focus on traditional measures of ‘sickness’."
https://openalex.org/W1994964123,"Vocal fold epithelial cells likely play an important, yet currently poorly defined, role in healing following injury, irritation and inflammation. In the present study, we sought to identify a possible role for growth factors, epidermal growth factor (EGF) and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGFβ1), in epithelial regeneration during wound healing as a necessary first step for uncovering potential signaling mechanisms of vocal fold wound repair and remodeling. Using a rat model, we created unilateral vocal fold injuries and examined the timeline for epithelial healing and regeneration during early and late stages of wound healing using immunohistochemistry (IHC). We observed time-dependent secretion of the proliferation marker, ki67, growth factors EGF and TGFβ1, as well as activation of the EGF receptor (EGFR), in regenerating epithelium during the acute phase of injury. Ki67, growth factor, and EGFR expression peaked at day 3 post-injury. Presence of cytoplasmic and intercellular EGF and TGFβ1 staining occurred up to 5 days post-injury, consistent with a role for epithelial cells in synthesizing and secreting these growth factors. To confirm that epithelial cells contributed to the cytokine secretion, we examined epithelial cell growth factor secretion in vitro using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Cultured pig vocal fold epithelial cells expressed both EGF and TGFβ1. Our in vivo and in vitro findings indicate that epithelial cells are active participants in the wound healing process. The exact mechanisms underlying their roles in autocrine and paracrine signaling guiding wound healing await study in a controlled, in vitro environment."
https://openalex.org/W1982546191,"Rationale The diffusing capacity (DL) of the lung can be divided into two components: the diffusing capacity of the alveolar membrane (Dm) and the pulmonary capillary volume (Vc). DL is traditionally measured using a single-breath method, involving inhalation of carbon monoxide, and a breath hold of 8–10 seconds (DL,CO). This method does not easily allow calculation of Dm and Vc. An alternative single-breath method (DL,CO,NO), involving simultaneous inhalation of carbon monoxide and nitric oxide, and traditionally a shorter breath hold, allows calculation of Dm and Vc and the DL,NO/DL,CO ratio in a single respiratory maneuver. The clinical utility of Dm, Vc, and DL,NO/DL,CO in the pediatric age range is currently unknown but also restricted by lack of reference values. Objectives The aim of this study was to establish reference ranges for the outcomes of DL,CO,NO with a 5 second breath hold, including the calculated outcomes Dm, Vc, and the DL,NO/DL,CO ratio, as well as to establish reference values for the outcomes of the traditional DL,CO method, with a 10 second breath hold in children. Methods DL,CO,NO and DL,CO were measured in healthy children, of European descent, aged 5–17 years using a Jaeger Masterscreen PFT. The data were analyzed using the Generalized Additive Models for Location Scale and Shape (GAMLSS) statistical method. Measurements and Main Results A total of 326 children were eligible for diffusing capacity measurements, resulting in 312 measurements of DL,CO,NO and 297 of DL,CO, respectively. Reference equations were established for the outcomes of DL,CO,NO and DL,CO, including the calculated values: Vc, Dm, and the DL,NO/DL,CO ratio. Conclusion These reference values are based on the largest sample of children to date and may provide a basis for future studies of their clinical utility in differentiating between alterations in the pulmonary circulation and changes in the alveolar membrane in pediatric patients."

The data support roles for intermediates in the glycerol-3-phosphate pathway of triacylglycerol synthesis: diacylglycerol (DAG), which may cause insulin resistance in liver by activating PKCϵ, and phosphatidic acid (PA), which inhibits insulin action in hepatocytes by disrupting the assembly of mTOR and rictor. To determine whether increases in DAG and PA impair insulin signaling when produced by pathways other than that of de novo synthesis, we examined primary mouse hepatocytes after enzymatically manipulating the cellular content of DAG or PA. Overexpressing phospholipase D1 or phospholipase D2 inhibited insulin signaling and was accompanied by an elevated cellular content of total PA, without a change in total DAG. Overexpression of diacylglycerol kinase-θ inhibited insulin signaling and was accompanied by an elevated cellular content of total PA and a decreased cellular content of total DAG.

https://openalex.org/W2158796494,"To date, volatile sex pheromones have not been identified in the Coccinellidae family; yet, various studies have suggested that such semiochemicals exist. Here, we collected volatile chemicals released by virgin females of the multicolored Asian lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis (Pallas), which were either allowed or not allowed to feed on aphids. Virgin females in the presence of aphids, exhibited “calling behavior”, which is commonly associated with the emission of a sex pheromone in several Coleoptera species. These calling females were found to release a blend of volatile compounds that is involved in the remote attraction (i.e., from a distance) of males. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses revealed that (–)-β-caryophyllene was the major constituent of the volatile blend (ranging from 80 to 86%), with four other chemical components also being present; β-elemene, methyl-eugenol, α-humulene, and α-bulnesene. In a second set of experiments, the emission of the five constituents identified from the blend was quantified daily over a 9-day period after exposure to aphids. We found that the quantity of all five chemicals significantly increased across the experimental period. Finally, we evaluated the activity of a synthetic blend of these chemicals by performing bioassays which demonstrated the same attractive effect in males only. The results confirm that female H. axyridis produce a volatile sex pheromone. These findings have potential in the development of more specific and efficient biological pest-control management methods aimed at manipulating the behavior of this invasive lady beetle."
https://openalex.org/W2075608184,"Epidemiology studies have established a strong link between lung cancer and arsenic exposure. Currently, the role of disturbed cellular energy metabolism in carcinogenesis is a focus of scientific interest. Hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1A) is a key regulator of energy metabolism, and it has been found to accumulate during arsenite exposure under oxygen-replete conditions. We modeled arsenic-exposed human pulmonary epithelial cells in vitro with BEAS-2B, a non-malignant lung epithelial cell line. Constant exposure to 1 µM arsenite (As) resulted in the early loss of anchorage-dependent growth, measured by soft agar colony formation, beginning at 6 weeks of exposure. This arsenite exposure resulted in HIF-1A accumulation and increased glycolysis, similar to the physiologic response to hypoxia, but in this case under oxygen-replete conditions. This “pseudo-hypoxia” response was necessary for the maximal acquisition of anchorage-independent growth in arsenite-exposed BEAS-2B. The HIF-1A accumulation and induction in glycolysis was sustained throughout a 52 week course of arsenite exposure in BEAS-2B. There was a time-dependent increase in anchorage-independent growth during the exposure to arsenite. When HIF-1A expression was stably suppressed, arsenite-induced glycolysis was abrogated, and the anchorage-independent growth was reduced. These findings establish that arsenite exerts a hypoxia-mimetic effect, which plays an important role in the subsequent gain of malignancy-associated phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W1976702800,"Cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) is a diflavin enzyme that transfers electrons to many protein partners. Electron transfer from CPR to cyt c has been extensively used as a model reaction to assess the redox activity of CPR. CPR is composed of multiple domains, among which the FMN binding domain (FBD) is the direct electron donor to cyt c. Here, electron transfer and complex formation between FBD and cyt c are investigated. Electron transfer from FBD to cyt c occurs at distinct rates that are dependent on the redox states of FBD. When compared with full-length CPR, FBD reduces cyt c at a higher rate in both the semiquinone and hydroquinone states. The NMR titration experiments reveal the formation of dynamic complexes between FBD and cyt c on a fast exchange time scale. Chemical shift mapping identified residues of FBD involved in the binding interface with cyt c, most of which are located in proximity to the solvent-exposed edge of the FMN cofactor along with other residues distributed around the surface of FBD. The structural model of the FBD-cyt c complex indicates two possible orientations of complex formation. The major complex structure shows a salt bridge formation between Glu-213/Glu-214 of FBD and Lys-87 of cyt c, which may be essential for the formation of the complex, and a predicted electron transfer pathway mediated by Lys-13 of cyt c.

https://openalex.org/W1967034089,"The present study focuses on the genetic and biochemical characterization of mycothiol S-conjugate amidase (Mca) of Corynebacterium glutamicum. Recombinant C. glutamicum Mca was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to apparent homogeneity. The molecular weight of native Mca protein determined by gel filtration chromatography was 35 kDa, indicating that Mca exists as monomers in the purification condition. Mca showed amidase activity with mycothiol S-conjugate of monobromobimane (MSmB) in vivo while mca mutant lost the ability to cleave MSmB. In addition, Mca showed limited deacetylase activity with N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) as substrate. Optimum pH for amidase activity was between 7.5 and 8.5, while the highest activity in the presence of Zn2+ confirmed Mca as a zinc metalloprotein. Amino acid residues conserved among Mca family members were located in C. glutamicum Mca and site-directed mutagenesis of these residues indicated that Asp14, Tyr137, His139 and Asp141 were important for activity. The mca deletion mutant showed decreased resistance to antibiotics, alkylating agents, oxidants and heavy metals, and these sensitive phenotypes were recovered in the complementary strain to a great extent. The physiological roles of Mca in resistance to various toxins were further supported by the induced expression of Mca in C. glutamicum under various stress conditions, directly under the control of the stress-responsive extracytoplasmic function-sigma (ECF-σ) factor SigH."
https://openalex.org/W2058502936,"Development and patterning of neural tissue in the vertebrate embryo involves a set of molecules and processes whose relationships are not fully understood. Classical embryology revealed a remarkable phenomenon known as vertical signalling, a gastrulation stage mechanism that copies anterior-posterior positional information from mesoderm to prospective neural tissue. Vertical signalling mediates unambiguous copying of complex information from one tissue layer to another. In this study, we report an investigation of this process in recombinates of mesoderm and ectoderm from gastrulae of Xenopus laevis. Our results show that copying of positional information involves non cell autonomous autoregulation of particular Hox genes whose expression is copied from mesoderm to neurectoderm in the gastrula. Furthermore, this information sharing mechanism involves unconventional translocation of the homeoproteins themselves. This conserved primitive mechanism has been known for three decades but has only recently been put into any developmental context. It provides a simple, robust way to pattern the neurectoderm using the Hox pattern already present in the mesoderm during gastrulation. We suggest that this mechanism was selected during evolution to enable unambiguous copying of rather complex information from cell to cell and that it is a key part of the original ancestral mechanism mediating axial patterning by the highly conserved Hox genes."
https://openalex.org/W2071206405,"Adolescence and early adulthood are developmental time periods during which creative cognition is highly important for adapting to environmental changes. Divergent thinking, which refers to generating novel and useful solutions to open-ended problems, has often been used as a measure of creative cognition. The first goal of this structural neuroimaging study was to elucidate the relationship between gray matter morphology and performance in the verbal (AUT; alternative uses task) and visuo-spatial (CAT; creative ability test) domain of divergent thinking in adolescents and young adults. The second goal was to test if gray matter morphology is related to brain activity during AUT performance. Neural and behavioral data were combined from a cross-sectional study including 25 adolescents aged 15-17 and 20 young adults aged 25-30. Brain-behavior relationships were assessed without a priori location assumptions and within areas that were activated during an AUT-scanner task. Gray matter volume and cortical thickness were not significantly associated with verbal divergent thinking. However, visuo-spatial divergent thinking (CAT originality and fluency) was positively associated with cortical thickness of the right middle temporal gyrus and left brain areas including the superior frontal gyrus and various occipital, parietal, and temporal areas, independently of age. AUT brain activity was not associated with cortical thickness. The results support an important role of a widespread brain network involved in flexible visuo-spatial divergent thinking, providing evidence for a relation between cortical thickness and visuo-spatial divergent thinking in adolescents and young adults. However, studies including visuo-spatial divergent thinking tasks in the scanner are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2076439728,"The present work aimed at investigating the effects of mechanically amplified tremor on cortico-muscular coherence (CMC) in the alpha band. The study of CMC in this specific band is of particular interest because this coherence is usually absent in healthy individuals and it is an aberrant feature in patients affected by pathological tremors; understanding its mechanisms is therefore important. Thirteen healthy volunteers (23±4 years) performed elbow flexor sustained contractions both against a spring load and in isometric conditions at 20% of maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC). Spring stiffness was selected to induce instability in the stretch reflex servo loop. 64 EEG channels, surface EMG from the biceps brachii muscle and force were simultaneously recorded. Contractions against the spring resulted in greater fluctuations of the force signal and EMG amplitude compared to isometric conditions (p<.05). During isometric contractions CMC was systematically found in the beta band and sporadically observed in the alpha band. However, during the contractions against the spring load, CMC in the alpha band was observed in 12 out of 13 volunteers. Partial directed coherence (PDC) revealed an increased information flow in the EMG to EEG direction in the alpha band (p<.05). Therefore, coherence in the alpha band between the sensory-motor cortex and the biceps brachii muscle can be systematically induced in healthy individuals by mechanically amplifying tremor. The increased information flow in the EMG to EEG direction may reflect enhanced afferent activity from the muscle spindles. These results may contribute to the understanding of the presence of alpha band CMC in tremor related pathologies by suggesting that the origin of this phenomenon may not only be at cortical level but may also be affected by spinal circuit loops."

This study evaluated the potential therapeutic impact of six different NR2B and A2A receptor antagonists given either alone or in combination in unilateral 6-OHDA-lesioned rats without (monotherapy) or with (add-on therapy) the co-administration of L-Dopa: Sch-58261+ Merck 22; Sch-58261+Co-101244; Preladenant + Merck 22; Preladenant + Radiprodil; Tozadenant + Radiprodil; Istradefylline + Co-101244. Animals given monotherapy were assessed on distance traveled and rearing, whereas those given add-on therapy were assessed on contralateral rotations. Three-way mixed ANOVA were conducted to assess the main effect of each drug separately and to determine whether any interaction between two drugs was additive or synergistic. Additional post hoc analyses were conducted to compare the effect of the combination with the effect of the drugs alone. Motor activity improved significantly and was sustained for longer when the drugs were given in combination than when administered separately at the same dose. Similarly, when tested as add-on treatment to L-Dopa, the combinations resulted in higher levels of contralateral rotation in comparison to the single drugs. Of special interest, the activity observed with some combinations could not be described by a simplistic additive effect and involved more subtle synergistic pharmacological interactions. The combined administration of A2A/NR2B-receptor antagonists improved motor behaviour in 6-OHDA rats. Given the proven translatability of this model such a combination may be expected to be effective in improving motor symptoms in patients."
https://openalex.org/W2081068781,"Objective How do the holidays – and the possible New Year’s resolutions that follow – influence a household’s purchase patterns of healthier foods versus less healthy foods? This has important implications for both holiday food shopping and post-holiday shopping. Methods 207 households were recruited to participate in a randomized-controlled trial conducted at two regional-grocery chain locations in upstate New York. Item-level transaction records were tracked over a seven-month period (July 2010 to March 2011). The cooperating grocer’s proprietary nutrient-rating system was used to designate “healthy,” and “less healthy” items. Calorie data were extracted from online nutritional databases. Expenditures and calories purchased for the holiday period (Thanksgiving-New Year’s), and the post-holiday period (New Year’s-March), were compared to baseline (July-Thanksgiving) amounts. Results During the holiday season, household food expenditures increased 15% compared to baseline ($105.74 to $121.83; p<0.001), with 75% of additional expenditures accounted for by less-healthy items. Consistent with what one would expect from New Year’s resolutions, sales of healthy foods increased 29.4% ($13.24/week) after the holiday season compared to baseline, and 18.9% ($9.26/week) compared to the holiday period. Unfortunately, sales of less-healthy foods remained at holiday levels ($72.85/week holiday period vs. $72.52/week post-holiday). Calories purchased each week increased 9.3% (450 calories per serving/week) after the New Year compared to the holiday period, and increased 20.2% (890 calories per serving/week) compared to baseline. Conclusions Despite resolutions to eat more healthfully after New Year’s, consumers may adjust to a new “status quo” of increased less-healthy food purchasing during the holidays, and dubiously fulfill their New Year’s resolutions by spending more on healthy foods. Encouraging consumers to substitute healthy items for less-healthy items may be one way for practitioners and public health officials to help consumers fulfill New Year’s resolutions, and reverse holiday weight gain."

We examined the relationship between increased serum bilirubin and renal function that was evaluated by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using CKD-EPI equations modified by a Japanese coefficient. Stepwise multiple regression analysis with eGFR as the objective variable, and adjusted risk factors as the explanatory variables, showed that serum bilirubin (β = 0.11, P<0.001) was significantly and independently associated with eGFR, in addition to gender, age, prevalence of antihypertensive medication, triglycerides, prevalence of antidiabetic medication, and serum uric acid. Compared with stages 1+2 (eGFR ≥60.0 ml/min/1.73 m2), mean multivariate-adjusted odds ratio {95% (confidence interval (CI)} for hypobilirubinemia (first quartile, <0.52 mg/dL) was 3.52 (range: 1.88–6.59). Next, to control potential confounding factors, data were further stratified by gender, age, medication (antihypertensive, antidyslipidemic, and antidiabetic agents), and prevalence of cardiovascular disease. The standardized coefficient for eGFR was significant in both groups, and there was no interaction between the groups. Our data demonstrated an independent positive association between serum bilirubin and eGFR in both genders. Low serum bilirubin level would be useful as a potential risk factor for renal function."
https://openalex.org/W1994154833,"Amyloids are highly organized protein aggregates that arise from inappropriately folded versions of proteins or polypeptides under both physiological as well as simulated ambiences. Once thought to be irreversible assemblies, amyloids have begun to expose their more dynamic and reversible attributes depending upon the intrinsic properties of the precursor protein/peptide and experimental conditions such as temperature, pressure, structural modifications in proteins, or presence of chemicals in the reaction mixture. It has been repeatedly proposed that amyloids undergo transformation to the bioactive peptide/protein forms under specific conditions. In the present study, amyloids assembled from the model protein ovalbumin (OVA) were found to release the precursor protein in a slow and steady manner over an extended time period. Interestingly, the released OVA from amyloid depot was found to exhibit biophysical characteristics of native protein and reacted with native-OVA specific monoclonal as well as polyclonal antibodies. Moreover, antibodies generated upon immunization of OVA amyloidal aggregates or fibrils were found to recognize the native form of OVA. The study suggests that amyloids may act as depots for the native form of the protein and therefore can be exploited as vaccine candidates, where slow antigen release over extended time periods is a pre-requisite for the development of desired immune response."

Evidence from patterns of brain expression and initial pharmacologic studies led us to use genetic and pharmacologic approaches to examine the influence of altered 5-HT1B receptor activity on hyperactivity in DAT KO mice. Heterozygous 5-HT1B KO and pharmacologic 5-HT1B antagonism both attenuated locomotor hyperactivity in DAT KO mice. Furthermore, DAT KO mice with reduced, but not eliminated, 5-HT1B receptor expression regained cocaine-stimulated locomotion, which was absent in DAT KO mice with normal levels of 5-HT1B receptor expression. Further experiments demonstrated that the degree of habituation to the testing apparatus determined whether cocaine had no effect on locomotion in DAT KO or reduced locomotion, helping to resolve differences among prior reports. These findings of complementation of the locomotor effects of DAT KO by reducing 5-HT1B receptor activity underscore roles for interactions between specific 5-HT receptors and dopamine (DA) systems in basal and cocaine-stimulated locomotion and support evaluation of 5-HT1B antagonists as potential, non-stimulant ADHD therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W2010352525,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a leading genetic cause of infant death worldwide, is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by the loss of SMN1 (survival motor neuron 1), which encodes the protein SMN. The loss of SMN1 causes a deficiency in SMN protein levels leading to motor neuron cell death in the anterior horn of the spinal cord. SMN2, however, can also produce some functional SMN to partially compensate for loss of SMN1 in SMA suggesting increasing transcription of SMN2 as a potential therapy to treat patients with SMA. A cAMP response element was identified on the SMN2 promoter, implicating cAMP activation as a step in the transcription of SMN2. Therefore, we investigated the effects of modulating the cAMP signaling cascade on SMN production in vitro and in silico. SMA patient fibroblasts were treated with the cAMP signaling modulators rolipram, salbutamol, dbcAMP, epinephrine and forskolin. All of the modulators tested were able to increase gem formation, a marker for SMN protein in the nucleus, in a dose-dependent manner. We then derived two possible mathematical models simulating the regulation of SMN2 expression by cAMP signaling. Both models fit well with our experimental data. In silico treatment of SMA fibroblasts simultaneously with two different cAMP modulators resulted in an additive increase in gem formation. This study shows how a systems biology approach can be used to develop potential therapeutic targets for treating SMA."
https://openalex.org/W2021918407,"Apolipoprotein (Apo) D is an important protein produced in many parts of the body. It is necessary for the development and repair of the brain and protection from oxidative stress. The purpose of this study was to investigate the extent to which apoD interacts with lipoproteins in human plasma. By using detergent-free ELISA, we show that immobilized monoclonal antibodies against apoD very efficiently bind to low density lipoprotein (LDL) from plasma; this binding is as equally efficient as binding to an anti-apoB monoclonal antibody. Adding detergent to the plasma inhibited the binding, suggesting that the binding is dependent on the presence of intact lipoprotein particles. Reversing the system by using immobilized anti-apoB revealed that the affinity of apoD for LDL is rather low, suggesting that multiple bindings are needed for a durable connection. Biosensor experiments using purified lipoproteins also showed that purified apoD and high density lipoprotein 3 (HDL3), a lipoprotein fraction rich in apoD, were both able to bind LDL very efficiently, indicating that the HDL3-LDL interaction may be a physiological consequence of the affinity of apoD for LDL. Furthermore, we found that apoD increases the binding of HDL to actively growing T24 bladder carcinoma cells but not to quiescent, contact-inhibited, confluent T24 cells. This result is especially intriguing given that the T24 supernatant only contained detectable levels of apoD after growth inhibition, raising the possibility that alternating the expression of apoD and a putative apoD-receptor could give direction to the flow of lipids. In the current paper, we conclude that apoD mediates binding of HDL to LDL and to growing T24 carcinomas, thereby highlighting the importance of apoD in lipid metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2050781677,"Construction and analyses of tissue specific networks is crucial to unveil the function and organizational structure of biological systems. As a direct method to detect protein dynamics, human proteome-wide expression data provide an valuable resource to investigate the tissue specificity of proteins and interactions. By integrating protein expression data with large-scale interaction network, we constructed 30 tissue/cell specific networks in human and analyzed their properties and functions. Rather than the tissue specificity of proteins, we mainly focused on the tissue specificity of interactions to distill tissue specific networks. Through comparing our tissue specific networks with those inferred from gene expression data, we found our networks have larger scales and higher reliability. Furthermore, we investigated the similar extent of multiple tissue specific networks, which proved that tissues with similar functions tend to contain more common interactions. Finally, we found that the tissue specific networks differed from the static network in multiple topological properties. The proteins in tissue specific networks are interacting looser and the hubs play more important roles than those in the static network."
https://openalex.org/W2040434984,"Ligand activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) prevents cardiac myocyte hypertrophy, and we previously reported that diacylglycerol kinase zeta (DGKζ) is critically involved. DGKζ is an intracellular lipid kinase that catalyzes phosphorylation of diacylglycerol; by attenuating DAG signaling, DGKζ suppresses protein kinase C (PKC) and G-protein signaling. Here, we investigated how PPAR-DGKζ signaling blocks activation of the hypertrophic gene program. We focused on export of histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) from the nucleus, a key event during hypertrophy, since crosstalk occurs between PPARs and other members of the HDAC family. Using cardiac myocytes isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats, we determined that liganded PPARs disrupt endothelin-1 (ET1)-induced nuclear export of HDAC5 in a manner that is dependent on DGKζ. When DGKζ-mediated PKC inhibition was circumvented using a constitutively-active PKCε mutant, PPARs failed to block ET1-induced nuclear retention of HDAC5. Liganded PPARs also prevented (i) activation of protein kinase D (the downstream effector of PKC), (ii) HDAC5 phosphorylation at 14-3-3 protein chaperone binding sites (serines 259 and 498), and (iii) physical interaction between HDAC5 and 14-3-3, all of which are consistent with blockade of nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling of HDAC5. Finally, the ability of PPARs to prevent neutralization of HDAC5 activity was associated with transcriptional repression of hypertrophic genes. This occurred by first, reduced MEF2 transcriptional activity and second, augmented deacetylation of histone H3 associated with hypertrophic genes expressing brain natriuretic peptide, β-myosin heavy chain, skeletal muscle α-actin, and cardiac muscle α-actin. Our findings identify spatial regulation of HDAC5 as a target for liganded PPARs, and to our knowledge, are the first to describe a mechanistic role for nuclear DGKζ in cardiac myocytes. In conclusion, these results implicate modulation of HDAC5 as a mechanism by which liganded PPARs suppress the hypertrophic gene program."
https://openalex.org/W1989189101,"Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus is a δ-proteobacterium that preys upon Salmonella spp., E. coli, and other Gram-negative bacteria. Bdellovibrio can grow axenically (host-independent, HI, rare and mutation-driven) or subsist via a predatory lifecycle (host-dependent, HD, the usual case). Upon contact with prey, B. bacteriovorus enters the host periplasm from where it slowly drains the host cytosol of nutrients for its own replication. At the core of this mechanism is a retractile pilus, whose architecture is regulated by the protein Bd0108 and its interaction with the neighboring gene product Bd0109. Deletion of bd0108 results in negligible pilus formation, whereas an internal deletion (the one that instigates host-independence) causes mis-regulation of pilus length. These mutations, along with a suite of naturally occurring bd0108 mutant strains, act to control the entry to HI growth. To further study the molecular mechanism of predatory regulation, we focused on the apparent lifecycle switch protein Bd0108. Here we characterize the solution structure and dynamics of Bd0108 using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy complemented with additional biophysical methods. We then explore the interaction between Bd0108 and Bd0109 in detail utilizing isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and NMR spectroscopy. Together our results demonstrate that Bd0108 is an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) and that the interaction with Bd0109 is of low affinity. Furthermore, we observe that Bd0108 retains an IDP nature while binding Bd0109. From our data we conclude that Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus utilizes an intrinsically disordered protein to regulate its pilus and control predation signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1996443075,"Understanding the mechanisms that drive population dynamics is fundamental for management of wild populations. The guanaco (Lama guanicoe) is one of two wild camelid species in South America. We evaluated the effects of density dependence and weather variables on population regulation based on a time series of 36 years of population sampling of guanacos in Tierra del Fuego, Chile. The population density varied between 2.7 and 30.7 guanaco/km2, with an apparent monotonic growth during the first 25 years; however, in the last 10 years the population has shown large fluctuations, suggesting that it might have reached its carrying capacity. We used a Bayesian state-space framework and model selection to determine the effect of density and environmental variables on guanaco population dynamics. Our results show that the population is under density dependent regulation and that it is currently fluctuating around an average carrying capacity of 45,000 guanacos. We also found a significant positive effect of previous winter temperature while sheep density has a strong negative effect on the guanaco population growth. We conclude that there are significant density dependent processes and that climate as well as competition with domestic species have important effects determining the population size of guanacos, with important implications for management and conservation."
https://openalex.org/W2041407259,"Wheat starch development is a complex process and is markedly difference by changes in spikelet spatial position. The present study deals with endosperm starch granule distribution and spatial position during filling development. The study was conducted with pure starch isolated from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), Jimai20 and Shannong1391, at 7–35 days after anthesis (DAA). The results showed that grain number, spikelet weight and grain weight per spikelet in different spatial position showed parabolic changes. Upper spikelets had highest starch and amylose content followed by basal spikelets, then middle spikelets. The paper also suggested the volume percents of B-type and A-type granule in grain of middle spikelets were remarkably higher and lower than those of basal and upper spikelets, respectively. However, no significant difference occurred in the number percents of the two type granule. The ratio of amylase to amylopectin was positively correlated with the volume proportion of 22.8–42.8 µm, but was negatively related to the volume proportion of <9.9 µm. The results indicated that the formation and distribution of starch granules were affected significantly by spikelet position, and grains at upper and basal spikelet had the potential of increasing grain weight through increasing the volume of B-type granules."

LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) was used for transfection as directed by the manufacturer. The hippocampi of embryonic-day-18 rat embryos were digested with 0.125% trypsin-EDTA for 15 min at 37 °C followed by trituration with pipettes in the plating medium (DMEM with 10% FBS). Dissociated neurons were transfected using a nucleofector device (Amaxa Nucleofector II). Control and transfected neurons were plated onto coverslips coated with poly-d-lysine (0.1 mg/ml). After culturing for 4 h, the medium was changed to neuronal culture medium (neurobasal media containing 1% glutamine and 2% B27). All cell samples were seeded on 12-mm poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips for immunofluorescence analysis. The treated cells were washed with PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 30 min, and incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. After blocking with 10% goat serum in PBS at room temperature for 1 h, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight and subsequently with the appropriate Alexa 555- or CF633-conjugated secondary antibody. Coverslips were mounted, and the cells were examined under a confocal microscope (Olympus, Okoya, Japan). For the quantitative analysis, images were automatically taken by a laser-based confocal high content system (Opera, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by 40× objective magnification. Disrupted microtubule networks were quantified and plotted by an image data analysis system (Columbus, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Data the mean ± S.E. from three independent experiments. HEK293 cells at 80% confluency were cotransfected with myc-tagged MARK2 WT and HA-tagged PKAc constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent for 48 h. Cells were washed with PBS and lysed in cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 0.5% Triton X-100) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm Na3VO4. For the coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins, E18 mouse brain was lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer as described above. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g. Cell lysates were preincubated with myc-tagged antibody or HA-tagged antibody overnight at 4 °C and then immunoprecipitated with protein A-agarose (Sigma) for 4 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with ice-cold PBS, an appropriate volume of loading buffer was added to the beads, the beads were boiled, and the proteins were then analyzed by Western blot.

Recombinant liver kinase B1 (LKB1) protein was bought from Carna Biosciences. Recombinant MARK2 WT or MARK2 S409A (400 nm) were incubated with or without PKAc (400 nm) at 30 °C for 4 h in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.01% Brij-35, and 100 μm ATP. The samples (MARK2 WT with or without PKAc and MARK2 S409A with or without PKAc and MARK2 S409E) were then incubated for a further 30 min at 30 °C by the addition of 20 nm LKB1 protein. Analyses of the activities of MARK2 proteins were carried out in typical assay conditions of a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.01% Brij-35, 100 μm ATP (0.4 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP per reaction), and 100 μm AMARA peptide as described previously (13Pang T.

The reaction was initiated by the addition of MARK2 proteins, incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, and terminated by the addition of 50 μl of 1% H3PO4. Particulate matter was then transferred to phosphocellulose pH plates (Millipore) and washed 4 times with 0.1% H3PO4. Radioactivity that had been incorporated in the AMARA peptide was determined by liquid scintillation counting in a Wallac MicroBeta plate counter. Background radioactivity estimated from reactions conducted without enzymes was subtracted from sample radioactivities. All reactions were repeated in three independent experiments. The samples were loaded on 10% (w/v) SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted using the indicated primary antibodies. The bands were visualized using HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL substrate (Thermo) and analyzed with Bio-Rad ChemiDoc System(Bio-Rad) and Image laboratory software. The tryptic peptides generated by tryptic in-gel digestion were dissolved in solvent A (0.1% formic acid, 2% acetonitrile, 98% H2O). Samples were then injected onto a manually packed reversed phase C18 column (150 mm × 79 μm, 3-μm particle size, Dikma, China) coupled to Easy nLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Peptides were eluted from 8% to 80% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in 90% acetonitrile and 10% H2O) in solvent A (0.1% formic acid in 2% acetonitrile and 98% H2O) with a 90-min gradient at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. The eluent was analyzed by using Q Exactive mass spectrometer. For full MS analysis, the scan range was m/z 350–1300 with a resolution of 70,000. The 10 most intense ions in each full MS spectrum were sequentially fragmented by higher energy collision dissociation with a normalized collision energy of 28%. The dynamic exclusion duration was set to be 30 s, and the isolation window was 2.0 m/z. The raw files were analyzed by Mascot software (Version 2.3) against the UniProt human database to identify the phosphorylation sites. For mascot search, we specified the parameters including carbomidomethyl (C) as the fixed modification and acetylation (protein N-term), oxidation (M), and phosphorylation (ST) as variable modifications. Other parameters were as follows: mass error for parent ion mass was ±10 ppm with fragment ion as ± 0.02 Da, and the enzyme was trypsin with 2 maximum missing cleavages. Data are presented as the means ± S.E. from three independent experiments. Significance was analyzed using a two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. A value of p < 0.05 (*) was considered statistically significant, a value of p < 0.01 (**) was considered statistically highly significant, and a value of p < 0.001 (***) was considered statistically extremely significant. MARK2 induces microtubule disruption by phosphorylating MAPs (7Drewes G. Ebneth A. Preuss U. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. MARK, a novel family of protein kinases that phosphorylate microtubule-associated proteins and trigger microtubule disruption.Cell. 1997; 89: 297-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Here, HEK293 cells were fixed and stained with antibodies against α-tubulin to visualize microtubules. pEGFP-MARK2 WT (wild-type MARK2 with enhanced green fluorescent protein appended to its N terminus) caused microtubule disruption and cell shrinkage in 60% of the transfected cell (Fig. 1, A, e-h, and C), which is extremely significant in contrast with the extended shape and intact microtubule network observed in the control cells (Fig. 1, A, a–d, and C) (p < 0.001) as reported previously (14Zhang X. Zhu J. Yang G.Y. Wang Q.J. Qian L. Chen Y.M. Chen F. Tao Y. Hu H.S. Wang T. Luo Z.G. Dishevelled promotes axon differentiation by regulating atypical protein kinase C.Nat. Cell Biol. 2007; 9: 743-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). When HEK293 cells were cotransfected with HA-PKAc (PKA catalytic subunit with an HA-YPYDVPDYA tag at its N terminus) and EGFP-MARK2 WT, the shrinking cells with disrupted microtubule significantly decreased by 41% compared with the cells transfected only with MARK2 WT (p = 0.003) (Fig. 1, A, i–l, and C), whereas the overexpression of PKAc did not influence the protein amount of the transfected EGFP-MARK (Fig. 1B). HEK293 cells transfected with PKAc alone presented an intact microtubule network and normal morphology. The p value is 0.23 compared with the control cells. (Fig. 1, D and E). Coimmunoprecipitation experiments were conducted to clarify the interaction between PKA and MARK2. After being coexpressed with myc-MARK2 WT in HEK293 cells and immunoprecipitated by anti-myc antibody, PKAc was detected in the MARK2 immune complex (Fig. 2A). MARK2 was also coimmunoprecipitated and detected using anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2B), further demonstrating the interaction between PKA and MARK2. To explore how PKA inhibited the microtubule disruption caused by MARK2, we investigated whether PKA was able to phosphorylate and inhibit MARK2 kinase activity. Interestingly, after treatment with forskolin, immunoprecipitated endogenous MARK2 was phosphorylated, as determined by immunoblotting against the specific phospho-PKA substrate antibody at the optimal PKA substrate motif Arg-Arg-X-Ser/Thr (RRX(S*/T*)) (15Diegelmann S.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 15044-15049Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). This phosphorylation was totally blocked by pretreatment with H89, a specific PKA antagonist. The well defined PKA substrate CREB was used as a positive control to confirm the reliability of the experiment (Fig. 3A). To explore which site on MARK2 was phosphorylated by PKA, we analyzed the MARK2 sequence (Fig. 3B) and found that Ser-409 in the spacer domain of MARK2 matched the optimal PKA substrate motif RRX(S/T) (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, a search of protein phosphorylations in eukaryotic databases showed that tandem mass spectrometry studies (17Daub H. Olsen J.V. Bairlein M. Gnad F. Oppermann F.S. Körner R. Greff Z.

Therefore, we supposed that PKA may act as the upstream kinase of MARK2 by directly phosphorylating Ser-409. The nano HPLC-MS/MS analysis using a high resolution Q Exactive mass spectrometer was carried out to confirm the phosphorylating site MARK2 targeted by PKA. The Ser-409 phosphorylated peptide (RFpSDQAAGPAIPTSNSYSK, pS is phosphorylated Ser) of MARK2 incubated with PKA was detected, whereas no phosphorylation at Ser-409 was identified in the protein from the group of MARK-WT alone (Fig. 3G). Besides, the autoradiography showed that PKAc phosphorylated the wild-type MARK2, and mutation of the Ser residue at 409 to Ala significantly reduced phosphorylation. The immunoblotting analysis of the SDS gel against MARK2 antibody also showed that the Mr of MARK2 shifted upward in the presence of PKAc, which was obviously reversed by mutation of Ser-409 to Ala (Fig. 3C). Both autoradiography and MS/MS analysis obviously indicated that PKAc could phosphorylate MARK2 at Ser-409, although the possibility that PKA phosphorylates other sites on MARK2 cannot be excluded. To investigate whether PKA inhibits the kinase activity of MARK2 after its phosphorylation, we used a bacterially expressed PKAc and MARK2 in an in vitro kinase activity assay. In the analysis of MARK2 proteins, including MARK2 WT, MARK2 S409A with or without PKA, or MARK2 S409E kinase activity against a well known substrate, the AMARA peptide was performed by a radioactivity incorporation assay. LKB1 was used to pre-phosphorylate and activate the E. coli expressed MARK2 proteins (MARK2 WT, MARK2 S409A, MARK2 S409E), with no activity against AMARA peptide (Fig. 3D). Fig. 3F showed that both the wild-type MARK2 and the mutant MARK2 S409A had similarly high kinase activities, whereas the activity of the mutant MARK2 S409E was reduced to 60.67% that of the control (***, p < 0.001). The activity of wild-type MARK2 was significant inhibited by the PKAc, with 53.60% activity of the wild type (**m p = 0.0016) (Fig. 3D). The kinase-dead mutant of PKAc (PKA-KD), without autophosphorylation at Thr197 (Fig. 3Ei), had no significant inhibitory activity on MARK2 (p = 0.25) (Fig. 3Eii). However, the activity of the MARK2 S409A mutant was hardly affected by the PKAc (p = 0.99) (Fig. 3F). PKAc alone showed no kinase activity against AMARA peptide (Fig. 3D). The in vitro kinase activity assay showed that PKAc could significantly inhibit the kinase activity of MARK2 WT. The mutation of MARK2 Ser-409 to Ala did not affect MARK2 enzyme activity but blocked the inhibitory effects of PKAc on MARK2 kinase activity. The mutation of MARK2 Ser-409 to Glu significant decreased the kinase activity, mimicking the inhibitory effects of PKAc. These results clearly indicated that PKA significantly inhibits MARK2 kinase activity by phosphorylating Ser-409. To investigate the role of the predicted PKA phosphorylation site Ser-409 of MARK2 in the regulation of microtubule stability, EGFP-MARK2 S409A or MARK2 S409E was cotransfected with or without HA-PKAc into HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, MARK2 S409A overexpression caused microtubule disruption in 66% of the transfected HEK293 cells, similar to the microtubule disrupted cells percentage (60%) caused by MARK2 WT overexpression (p = 0.35). However, PKA did not reverse the microtubule disruption induced by MARK2 S409A. Microtubule disruption was caused in 61% of the MARK2 S409A and HA-PKAc co-expressed cells, not significantly different from that of the MARK2 S409A expressed alone (p = 0.68) (Fig. 4, A and C), whereas PKAc did not change the MARK2 S409A protein homeostasis (Fig. 4B). This suggested that the mutation of Ser to Ala at 409 blocked the phosphorylation of this site by PKA, leading to the inability of PKA to counteract MARK2. As shown in Fig. 4, D and E, only 27% of the MARK2 S409E-overexpressing cells had disrupted microtubules, similar to the control cells (p = 0.079) and significantly less than that of the MARK WT (p = 0.013) or MARK2 S409A-overexpressing cells (p = 0.003). In agreement with the kinase activity data in vitro, the overexpression of the MARK2 mutant S409E alone, mimicking a continuously phosphorylated state at Ser-409, did not disrupt the microtubule stability, similar to the rescue effect of active PKA on MARK2 WT. Together, our data support that PKA rescues the disruption of microtubule stability induced by MARK2 by phosphorylating MARK2 on Ser-409. Because MARK2 elicits profound effects on neuronal differentiation (10Chen Y.M. Wang Q.J. Hu H.S. Yu P.C. Zhu J. Drewes G. Piwnica-Worms H. Luo Z.G.

The complex containing PKA and MARK2 was immunoprecipitated from the E18 mouse brain (Fig. 5A), demonstrating that PKA and MARK2 endogenously interact. MAP2 could also be detected in the PKA-MARK2 immune complex (Fig. 5A). It suggested that MAP2 (or other proteins) as the substrate of MARK2 and the anchoring protein of PKA (48Harada A. Teng J. Takei Y. Oguchi K. Hirokawa N. MAP2 is required for dendrite elongation, PKA anchoring in dendrites, and proper PKA signal transduction.J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) may facilitate the interaction between PKA and MARK2 in brain. To monitor the state of endogenous MARK2 and PKA in primary neurons, we probed primary hippocampal neurons with antibodies against MARK2 and PKAc. As shown in Fig. 5B, PKAc and MARK2 were mostly distributed in the cytoplasm and neurite protrusions. The colocalization of PKAc and MARK2 was partial and mainly occurred in certain zones near neurites. The partial localization of PKAc and MARK2 was observed in the tips of neurites in growth cones and some segments along neurites. All of these loci of colocalization are involved in the formation and maintenance of neurite outgrowth, indicating that endogenous MARK2 and PKA may interact to regulate neurite outgrowth. The overexpression of MARK2, but not its kinase-defective mutant, in undifferentiated primary hippocampal cultures impairs neuronal microtubule stability, thereby blocking neurite outgrowth (20Yoshimura Y.

Here we report a tertiary trisomy uncovered by characterizing a T-DNA insertion mutant (aur2-1/+) in the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) AURORA2 locus. Whole-genome analysis with DNA tiling arrays revealed a chromosomal translocation linked to the aur2-1 allele, which collectively accounted for a tertiary trisomy 2. Morphologic, cytogenetic and genetic analyses of aur2-1 progeny showed impaired male and female gametogenesis to various degrees and a tight association of the aur2-1 allele with the tertiary trisomy that was preferentially inherited. Transcriptome analysis showed overlapping and distinct gene expression profiles between primary and tertiary trisomy 2 plants, particularly genes involved in response to stress and various types of external and internal stimuli. Additionally, transcriptome and gene ontology analyses revealed an overrepresentation of nuclear-encoded organelle-related genes functionally involved in plastids, mitochondria and peroxisomes that were differentially expressed in at least three if not all Arabidopsis trisomics. These observations support a previous hypothesis that aneuploid cells have higher energy requirement to overcome the detrimental effects of an unbalanced genome. Moreover, our findings extend the knowledge of the complex nature of the T-DNA insertion event influencing plant genomic integrity by creating high-grade trisomy. Finally, gene expression profiling results provide useful information for future research to compare primary and tertiary trisomics for the effects of aneuploidy on plant cell physiology."
https://openalex.org/W1973712076,"Frequency modulated (FM) sweeps are common in species-specific vocalizations, including human speech. Auditory neurons selective for the direction and rate of frequency change in FM sweeps are present across species, but the synaptic mechanisms underlying such selectivity are only beginning to be understood. Even less is known about mechanisms of experience-dependent changes in FM sweep selectivity. We present three network models of synaptic mechanisms of FM sweep direction and rate selectivity that explains experimental data: (1) The ‘facilitation’ model contains frequency selective cells operating as coincidence detectors, summing up multiple excitatory inputs with different time delays. (2) The ‘duration tuned’ model depends on interactions between delayed excitation and early inhibition. The strength of delayed excitation determines the preferred duration. Inhibitory rebound can reinforce the delayed excitation. (3) The ‘inhibitory sideband’ model uses frequency selective inputs to a network of excitatory and inhibitory cells. The strength and asymmetry of these connections results in neurons responsive to sweeps in a single direction of sufficient sweep rate. Variations of these properties, can explain the diversity of rate-dependent direction selectivity seen across species. We show that the inhibitory sideband model can be trained using spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP) to develop direction selectivity from a non-selective network. These models provide a means to compare the proposed synaptic and spectrotemporal mechanisms of FM sweep processing and can be utilized to explore cellular mechanisms underlying experience- or training-dependent changes in spectrotemporal processing across animal models. Given the analogy between FM sweeps and visual motion, these models can serve a broader function in studying stimulus movement across sensory epithelia."

Most studies have focused on embryo transmigration when the embryo is covered with a mucin-like glycoprotein capsule and on the characterization of the chorionic girdle and chorionic gonadotropin (CG) secretion. However, the events preceding and following capsule disappearance have not been well studied. In this study, the mRNA expression in conceptus membranes at days 19, 21, and 25 (day 0 = day of ovulation) was analyzed by RNA-seq (SOLiD3), and transcript levels on these three days and day 13 were confirmed by real-time PCR. Of the 26,416 equine genes registered, 20,436 transcripts were aligned to sequences in the Ensembl database, from which 4,625 transcripts were registered in both Ensembl and the KEGG pathway. Each of the 4,625 transcripts was examined through KEGG pathway analysis, and 12 transcripts of integrins (ITGs) and collagens (COLs) were confirmed through real-time PCR. Our data indicated that extracellular matrix (ECM)-related mRNAs were highly expressed in day 19, 21, and 25 conceptus membranes. In combination with previous results, which confirmed a lack of laminin and fibronectin transcript expression in the endometrium, these observations suggest that in contrast to attachment through focal adhesion, conceptus chorionic membrane ECMs function as a scaffold-like structure to possibly maintain the shape of the conceptus and a separation between chorionic membranes and the uterine luminal epithelium."

https://openalex.org/W2060626426,"Objectives 1H-MRS is widely regarded as the most accurate noninvasive method to quantify hepatic fat content (HFC). When practical period of breath holding, and acquisition of HFC over multiple liver areas is considered, a fast MR spectroscopic imaging technique is desired. The aim of this study is to examine the feasibility and reproducibility of echo planar spectroscopic imaging (EPSI) on the quantification of HFC in subject with various HFCs. Methods Twenty two volunteers were examined in a 3T MR system. The acquisition time of proposed EPSI protocol was 18 seconds. The EPSI scans were repeated 8 times for each subject to test reproducibility. The peak of water and individual peaks of fat including methyl, methylene, and allylic peaks at 0.9, 1.3, and 2.0 ppm were fitted. Calculated amount of water and fat content were corrected for T2 relaxation. The total HFC was defined as the combination of individual peaks. Standard deviation (SD), coefficient of variance (COV) and fitting reliability of HFC quantified by LCModel were calculated. Results Our results show that the SDs of total HFC for all subjects are less than 2.5%. Fitting reliability is mostly under 10% and positively correlates with COV. Subjects separated into three subgroups according to quantified total HFC show that improved fitting reliability and reproducibility can be achieved on subjects with higher total HFC. Conclusions We have demonstrated feasibility of the proposed EPSI protocols on the quantification of HFC over a whole slice of liver with scan time in a single breath hold."
