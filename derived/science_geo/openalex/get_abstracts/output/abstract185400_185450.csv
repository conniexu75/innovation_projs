https://openalex.org/W2012834939,"In contrast to the well-established roles of PPARγ and PPARα in lipid metabolism, little is known for PPARδ in this process. We show here that targeted activation of PPARδ in adipose tissue specifically induces expression of genes required for fatty acid oxidation and energy dissipation, which in turn leads to improved lipid profiles and reduced adiposity. Importantly, these animals are completely resistant to both high-fat diet-induced and genetically predisposed (Leprdb/db) obesity. As predicted, acute treatment of Leprdb/db mice with a PPARδ agonist depletes lipid accumulation. In parallel, PPARδ-deficient mice challenged with high-fat diet show reduced energy uncoupling and are prone to obesity. In vitro, activation of PPARδ in adipocytes and skeletal muscle cells promotes fatty acid oxidation and utilization. Our findings suggest that PPARδ serves as a widespread regulator of fat burning and identify PPARδ as a potential target in treatment of obesity and its associated disorders."

https://openalex.org/W2151503690,"We describe a paradigm for nociception in Drosophila. In response to the touch of a probe heated above 38 degrees C, Drosophila larvae produce a stereotypical rolling behavior, unlike the response to an unheated probe. In a genetic screen for mutants defective in this noxious heat response, we identified the painless gene. Recordings from wild-type larval nerves identified neurons that initiated strong spiking above 38 degrees C, and this activity was absent in the painless mutant. The painless mRNA encodes a protein of the transient receptor potential ion channel family. Painless is required for both thermal and mechanical nociception, but not for sensing light touch. painless is expressed in peripheral neurons that extend multiple branched dendrites beneath the larval epidermis, similar to vertebrate pain receptors. An antibody to Painless binds to localized dendritic structures that we hypothesize are involved in nociceptive signaling."

https://openalex.org/W1970752390,"Bacteriophages are the most abundant organisms in the biosphere and play major roles in the ecological balance of microbial life. The genomic sequences of ten newly isolated mycobacteriophages suggest that the bacteriophage population as a whole is amazingly diverse and may represent the largest unexplored reservoir of sequence information in the biosphere. Genomic comparison of these mycobacteriophages contributes to our understanding of the mechanisms of viral evolution and provides compelling evidence for the role of illegitimate recombination in horizontal genetic exchange. The promiscuity of these recombination events results in the inclusion of many unexpected genes including those implicated in mycobacterial latency, the cellular and immune responses to mycobacterial infections, and autoimmune diseases such as human lupus. While the role of phages as vehicles of toxin genes is well established, these observations suggest a much broader involvement of phages in bacterial virulence and the host response to bacterial infections."

https://openalex.org/W2047553717,"Estrogen receptor is a key regulator of proliferation and differentiation in mammary epithelia and represents a crucial prognostic indicator and therapeutic target in breast cancer. Mechanistically, estrogen receptor induces changes in gene expression through direct gene activation and also through the biological functions of target loci. Here, we identify the product of human MTA3 as an estrogen-dependent component of the Mi-2/NuRD transcriptional corepressor in breast epithelial cells and demonstrate that MTA3 constitutes a key component of an estrogen-dependent pathway regulating growth and differentiation. The absence of estrogen receptor or of MTA3 leads to aberrant expression of the transcriptional repressor Snail, a master regulator of epithelial to mesenchymal transitions. Aberrant Snail expression results in loss of expression of the cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin, an event associated with changes in epithelial architecture and invasive growth. These results establish a mechanistic link between estrogen receptor status and invasive growth of breast cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2025182546,"We demonstrate that the tendons associated with the axial skeleton derive from a heretofore unappreciated, fourth compartment of the somites. Scleraxis (Scx), a bHLH transcription factor, marks this somitic tendon progenitor population at its inception, and is continuously expressed through differentiation into the mature tendons. Two earlier-formed somitic compartments, the sclerotome and myotome, interact to establish this fourth Scx-positive compartment. The tendon progenitors are induced at the sclerotome's edge, at the expense of skeletogenic Pax1 positive cells and in response to FGF signaling in the adjacent myotome. The tendon primordia thus form in a location abutting the two tissues that the mature tendons must ultimately connect. Tendon progenitor formation may reveal a general mechanism for the specification of other somitic subcompartments."
https://openalex.org/W1978450158,"Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) are large multiprotein assemblies that allow traffic between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. During mitosis in higher eukaryotes, the Nuclear Envelope (NE) breaks down and NPCs disassemble. How NPCs reassemble and incorporate into the NE upon mitotic exit is poorly understood. We demonstrate a function for the conserved Nup107-160 complex in this process. Partial in vivo depletion of Nup133 or Nup107 via RNAi in HeLa cells resulted in reduced levels of multiple nucleoporins and decreased NPC density in the NE. Immunodepletion of the entire Nup107-160 complex from in vitro nuclear assembly reactions produced nuclei with a continuous NE but no NPCs. This phenotype was reversible only if Nup107-160 complex was readded before closed NE formation. Depletion also prevented association of FG-repeat nucleoporins with chromatin. We propose a stepwise model in which postmitotic NPC assembly initiates on chromatin via early recruitment of the Nup107-160 complex."
https://openalex.org/W2091300474,"The presence of multiple copies of the major replicative DNA polymerase (DnaE) in some organisms, including important pathogens and symbionts, has remained an unresolved enigma. We postulated that one copy might participate in error-prone DNA repair synthesis. We found that UV irradiation of Mycobacterium tuberculosis results in increased mutation frequency in the surviving fraction. We identified dnaE2 as a gene that is upregulated in vitro by several DNA damaging agents, as well as during infection of mice. Loss of this protein reduces both survival of the bacillus after UV irradiation and the virulence of the organism in mice. Our data suggest that DnaE2, and not a member of the Y family of error-prone DNA polymerases, is the primary mediator of survival through inducible mutagenesis and can contribute directly to the emergence of drug resistance in vivo. These results may indicate a potential new target for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W1988475719,"Mature adipocytes and myocytes are derived from a common mesenchymal precursor. While IGF-1 promotes the differentiation of both cell types, the signaling pathways that specify the distinct cell fates are largely unknown. Here, we show that the Rho GTPase and its regulator, p190-B RhoGAP, are components of a critical switch in the adipogenesis-myogenesis ""decision."" Cells derived from embryos lacking p190-B RhoGAP exhibit excessive Rho activity, are defective for adipogenesis, but undergo myogenesis in response to IGF-1 exposure. In vitro, activation of Rho-kinase by Rho inhibits adipogenesis and is required for myogenesis. The activation state of Rho following IGF-1 signaling is determined by the tyrosine-phosphorylation status of p190-B RhoGAP and its resulting subcellular relocalization. Moreover, adjusting Rho activity is sufficient to alter the differentiation program of adipocyte and myocyte precursors. Together, these results identify the Rho GTPase as an essential modulator of IGF-1 signals that direct the adipogenesis-myogenesis cell fate decision."
https://openalex.org/W2079676584,"The structure of mitochondria is highly dynamic and depends on the balance of fusion and fission processes. Deletion of the mitochondrial dynamin-like protein Mgm1 in yeast leads to extensive fragmentation of mitochondria and loss of mitochondrial DNA. Mgm1 and its human ortholog OPA1, associated with optic atrophy type I in humans, were proposed to be involved in fission or fusion of mitochondria or, alternatively, in remodeling of the mitochondrial inner membrane and cristae formation (Wong, E. D., Wagner, J. A., Gorsich, S. W., McCaffery, J. M., Shaw, J. M., and Nunnari, J. (2000) J. Cell Biol. 151, 341–352; Wong, E. D., Wagner, J. A., Scott, S. V., Okreglak, V., Holewinske, T. J., Cassidy-Stone, A., and Nunnari, J. (2003) J. Cell Biol. 160, 303–311; Sesaki, H., Southard, S. M., Yaffe, M. P., and Jensen, R. E. (2003) Mol. Biol. Cell, in press). Mgm1 and its orthologs exist in two forms of different lengths. To obtain new insights into their biogenesis and function, we have characterized these isoforms. The large isoform (l-Mgm1) contains an N-terminal putative transmembrane segment that is absent in the short isoform (s-Mgm1). The large isoform is an integral inner membrane protein facing the intermembrane space. Furthermore, the conversion of l-Mgm1 into s-Mgm1 was found to be dependent on Pcp1 (Mdm37/YGR101w) a recently identified component essential for wild type mitochondrial morphology. Pcp1 is a homolog of Rhomboid, a serine protease known to be involved in intercellular signaling in Drosophila melanogaster, suggesting a function of Pcp1 in the proteolytic maturation process of Mgm1. Expression of s-Mgm1 can partially complement the Δpcp1 phenotype. Expression of both isoforms but not of either isoform alone was able to partially complement the Δmgm1 phenotype. Therefore, processing of l-Mgm1 by Pcp1 and the presence of both isoforms of Mgm1 appear crucial for wild type mitochondrial morphology and maintenance of mitochondrial DNA. The structure of mitochondria is highly dynamic and depends on the balance of fusion and fission processes.

Therefore, processing of l-Mgm1 by Pcp1 and the presence of both isoforms of Mgm1 appear crucial for wild type mitochondrial morphology and maintenance of mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondria are dynamic structures. Their overall morphology and the shape of the inner membrane are highly variable (5Reichert A.S. Neupert W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1592: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). This is exemplified by a wide variety of mitochondrial ultrastructures observed in different organisms and tissues and by the dependence of these structures on the metabolic and genetic state of the cell. Mitochondrial dynamics has recently gained increasing attention, and quite a number of proteins affecting this structural diversity have been identified. Still, our understanding of the underlying molecular events is rather incomplete. Fusion and fission of mitochondrial membranes are processes that have to be balanced in order to maintain mitochondrial morphology (6Sesaki H. Jensen R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 699-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). For example, when fusion of mitochondria is abolished, fission can still continue, and consequently mitochondria get progressively fragmented (reviewed in Ref. 7Westermann B. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The roles of a number of proteins such as the GTPase Fzo1 (8Fritz S. Rapaport D. Klanner E. Neupert W. Westermann B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 152: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and the dynamin-like GTPase Dnm1 (9Bleazard W. McCaffery J.M. King E.J. Bale S. Mozdy A. Tieu Q. Nunnari J. Shaw J.M. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) in fusion and fission are known. Less clear is the role of the mitochondrial dynamin-like protein Mgm1, which is another component essential for maintaining mitochondrial morphology in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Deletion of the corresponding gene in yeast leads to extensive fragmentation of mitochondria and loss of mitochondrial DNA (10Guan K. Farh L. Marshall T.K. Deschenes R.J. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 11Jones B.A. Fangman W.L. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 380-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 12Shepard K.A. Yaffe M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Mutations in the orthologous gene in humans, OPA1, are associated with optic atrophy type I (reviewed in Ref. 13Delettre C. Lenaers G. Pelloquin L. Belenguer P. Hamel C.P. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2002; 75: 97-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Dynamins are a family of large GTPases involved in membrane fission during endocytosis (reviewed in Ref. 14Hinshaw J.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 483-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). However, the physiological roles of the mitochondrial dynamin-like proteins Mgm1 and OPA1 are not understood very well. Several hypotheses have been put forward that are mainly based on the homology to dynamins, on the mitochondrial localization, and the fragmentation of mitochondria in strains in which Mgm1 is mutated or deleted (10Guan K. Farh L. Marshall T.K. Deschenes R.J. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 11Jones B.A. Fangman W.L.

According to one hypothesis, Mgm1 modulates the morphology of the inner membrane and therefore is thought to be involved in cristae formation and/or inner membrane fission events (2Wong E.D. Wagner J.A. Gorsich S.W. McCaffery J.M. Shaw J.M. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Down-regulation of OPA1 in HeLa cells by small interfering RNA was reported to alter cristae morphology (15Olichon A. Baricault L. Gas N. Guillou E. Valette A. Belenguer P. Lenaers G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 7743-7746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). On the other hand, two recent reports indicate an important role for Mgm1 in the fusion of mitochondria (3Wong E.D. Wagner J.A. Scott S.V. Okreglak V. Holewinske T.J. Cassidy-Stone A. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 4Sesaki, H., Southard, S. M., Yaffe, M. P., and Jensen, R. E. (2003) Mol. Biol. Cell, in pressGoogle Scholar). Contradicting views exist about the exact submitochondrial location of Mgm1. It is still a matter of debate whether Mgm1 is located in the outer membrane (12Shepard K.A. Yaffe M.P. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) or in the intermembrane space of mitochondria (2Wong E.D. Wagner J.A. Gorsich S.W. McCaffery J.M. Shaw J.M. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 3Wong E.D. Wagner J.A. Scott S.V. Okreglak V. Holewinske T.J. Cassidy-Stone A. Nunnari J. J.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 4151-4161PubMed Google Scholar). Mgm1 and its orthologs from all species investigated so far exist in at least two isoforms (2Wong E.D. Wagner J.A. Gorsich S.W. McCaffery J.M. Shaw J.M. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 12Shepard K.A. Yaffe M.P. J.

Commun. 1998; 251: 720-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, it is crucial to clarify the identity of these isoforms and how they are generated. Furthermore, it is important to unravel the function of each of these isoforms. Are they both necessary for wild type mitochondrial morphology and maintenance of mitochondrial DNA, or do they serve independent functions? Here we present data that provide new insights into the biogenesis of Mgm1 and the role of its two isoforms for wild type-like mitochondrial morphology and maintenance of mtDNA 1The abbreviations used are: mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; MPP, mitochondrial processing peptidase; s-Mgm1, short isoform of Mgm1; l-Mgm1, large isoform of Mgm1. in yeast. Plasmids and Yeast Strains—Mgm1-(1–228) was amplified from genomic yeast DNA (W303) using the primer 5′-CCC CGA ATT CGA GCT CGC CAT GAG TAA TTC TAC TTC ATT AAG G-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CCC CGG ATC CAT GTG CAG AAG AAG AGT CC-3′. The PCR product was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and cloned in frame into pGEM4 (Invitrogen) containing mouse dihydrofolate reductase between the BamHI and HindIII restriction sites to yield a dihydrofolate reductase fusion protein. Mgm1-(1–427) was amplified using 5′-CCC CGC GGC CGC TCT AGA TCA GAG AGG ATA TTT TTT ATT ATT C-3′ as a reverse primer instead, digested with SacI and XbaI, and cloned into pGEM4. Full-length Mgm1 was cloned into pYES2 (Promega) after amplification with the reverse primer 5′-CCC CGC GGC CGC TCT AGA TCA TAA ATT TTT GGA GAC GCC C-3′ and digestion with SacI and XbaI. For the construction of s-Mgm1* (Fig. 4A), the sequence for the first 167 amino acids of cytochrome b 2 was amplified using primers 5′-CCC CGA GCT CGC CAT GCT AAA ATA CAA ACC TTT ACT A-3′ and 5′-GAT GTA GCG GCT ATT AGA GTA GCG GAT CCT TGA AGG GGA CCC-3′ and fused to Mgm1-(161–902) by two-sided overlap extension PCR (20Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar) with the second PCR product obtained by amplification with 5′-GGG TCC CCT TCA AGG ATC CGC TAC TCT AAT AGC CGC TAC ATC-3′ and the reverse primer for full-length Mgm1. The resulting sequence coding for the fusion protein was cloned into pYES2 using the SacI and XbaI restriction sites. The large isoform, l-Mgm1* (Fig. 4A), was obtained in a similar way using 5′-CAC AAG ACG GTG GTC ATG GAT CAC TCG ACG ATG ACG AAA GT-3′ and 5′-ACT TTC GTC ATC GTC GAG TGA TCC ATG ACC ACC GTC TTG TG-3′ as the two overlapping internal primers carrying the deletion of residues 154–167 of Mgm1. For the expression of full-length Mgm1 and l-Mgm1* under control of the endogenous promoter, these constructs were subcloned into pRS315 (21Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 1-270PubMed Google Scholar) using the SacI and XbaI restriction sites. Approximately 1000 bp upstream and the first 351 bp of the Mgm1 open reading frame were amplified from genomic DNA using the primers 5′-CCC CGA GCT CCA AGT CAT GTG AAG GAT GGA C-3′ and 5′-CCC CGC TAG CTT CTT CCA TCT TAT AAG C-3′. The resulting fragment was exchanged for a fragment of the respective constructs in pRS315 using the SacI and NheI restriction sites. For s-Mgm1*, the promoter was amplified using 5′-CCC CGA ATT CAG ATC TTT AGT AAA GGT TTG TAT TTT AGC ATG CTT TCA GAG TAT TAT GGT GAA-3′ as the reverse primer instead, which introduces a BglII site into the sequence of cytochrome b 2 by a silent mutation and cloned into the SacI and EcoRI restriction sites of pYES2. s-Mgm1* was amplified from s-Mgm1* in the pYES2 plasmid using the primer 5′-CCC CAG ATC TCG AAG AAC TGT GAG GCT GC-3′, which also contains the silent mutation for the BglII restriction site and the reverse primer for full-length Mgm1. The resulting fragment was cloned into the BglII and XbaI restriction sites of pYES2 containing the endogenous promoter of Mgm1 and then subcloned into pRS313 (21Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 1-270PubMed Google Scholar) using the SacI and XbaI restriction sites. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. S. cerevisiae W303 (ade2–1, leu2–3, his3–11,15, trp1–1, ura3–1, can1–100 MATα) was used as a wild type strain. The plasmids with the endogenous promoter were used for transformation of the heterozygous diploid deletion strains MGM1/Δmgm1 or PCP1/Δpcp1 (obtained from EUROSCARF, Germany). Protease deletion strains (Fig. 3) were obtained from the homozygous diploid deletion library (Research Genetics). Mitochondria for in vitro import experiments were prepared from S. cerevisiae D273-10B. Culturing of yeast, sporulation of diploid strains, and tetrad dissection were performed according to standard protocols (22Sherman F.F. Fink G.R. Hicks J. Methods in Yeast Genetics: A Laboratory Course. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar).Fig. 3Pcp1 is required for the processing of l-Mgm1 to s-Mgm1. Total cell extracts of deletion mutants deficient in one known or predicted mitochondrial protease were prepared and analyzed by immunoblotting for Mgm1. Lack of s-Mgm1 in the Δpcp1 strain is indicated by an arrowhead. WT, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Antibodies—Antibodies against Mgm1 were raised in rabbits using as antigens the C-terminal peptide H2N-CKKSYKGVSKNL-COOH and the internal peptide H2N-CSHQFEKAYFKENKK-COOH, both containing an additional cysteine for coupling to an affinity resin. Peptide synthesis, coupling of the peptide to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and immunization of the rabbits were carried out by Pineda Antikörperservice (Berlin, Germany). For affinity purification, peptides were coupled to SulfoLink® Coupling Gel (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The antibody against the C-terminal epitope was used for Western analysis unless indicated differently. Determination of Growth on Nonfermentable Carbon Source—In order to compare growth on fermentable versus nonfermentable carbon sources, drop dilution assays were performed. After tetrad dissection, cells were grown to exponential phase for 16 h on liquid-selective glucose medium at 30 °C, adjusted to a concentration of 0.7 A 578 nm/ml, and subjected to consecutive 10-fold dilution steps. 5-μl aliquots of each dilution were spotted on YPD and YPG plates in duplicate, and the plates were incubated for two (YPD) or three (YPG) days at 30 °C. Import of Preproteins into Mitochondria—Radiolabeled precursor proteins were synthesized using a coupled reticulocyte lysate transcription-translation system (Promega) in the presence of [35S]methionine. Mitochondria were isolated as described (23Sirrenberg C. Bauer M.F. Guiard B. Neupert W. Brunner M. Nature. 1996; 384: 582-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Import reactions were carried out in import buffer at 25 °C (600 mm sorbitol, 50 mm HEPES, 80 mm KCl, 10 mm MgAc2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm NADH, 2.5 mm ATP, 2.5 mm malate, 2.5 mm succinate, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2). 50 μg of mitochondria and 1% (v/v) reticulocyte lysate with the radiolabeled precursor were used per import reaction. Membrane potential was dissipated by adding carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone to a final concentration of 50 μm. After import, samples were diluted, treated with hypoosmotic buffer (20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4) to selectively rupture the outer membrane, and treated with proteinase K as indicated. Carbonate Extraction—To extract peripherally bound membrane proteins, mitochondria were diluted to a final concentration of 1 mg/ml in 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.4. After the addition of an equal volume of freshly prepared 0.2 m sodium carbonate solution, samples were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. The membrane and soluble fractions were separated by centrifugation at 45,000 rpm in a TLA45 rotor for 30 min at 4 °C. Equal fractions of membrane-associated and soluble proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Yeast Total Cell Extracts—Yeast total cell extracts were prepared by alkaline lysis. The pellet of 2 ml of yeast culture (A 578 = 1) was resuspended in 250 μl of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8. Then 50 μl of lysis buffer (1.85 m NaOH, 7.4% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol and 20 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) were added. After incubation for 10 min at 4 °C, samples were precipitated with 220 μl of 72% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, washed once with acetone, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Fluorescence Microscopy—Heterozygous diploid strains were cotransformed with plasmid pVT100U-mtGFP expressing mitochondria targeted green fluorescent protein (24Westermann B. Neupert W. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1421-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). After tetrad dissection, cells were grown for 16 h to exponential phase in liquid-selective glucose medium at 30 °C and analyzed by standard fluorescence microscopy (25Prokisch H. Neupert W. Westermann B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 2961-2971Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Classification and quantification of the morphology phenotypes were performed without knowledge of strain identity at the time of analysis. To test for the presence of mitochondrial DNA, cells grown under the same conditions were stained with 1 μg/ml DAPI for 1 h and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline. Only cells showing no trace of staining outside the nucleus were classified as lacking mtDNA (rhoO). For quantification of the phenotype, at least 150 cells were analyzed in three independent experiments, and the average and S.D. were calculated. Determination of N Termini of Mgm1 Isoforms—10 mg of mitochondria were lysed in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.6, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride for 15 min. After a clarifying spin, the supernatant was subjected to immunoprecipitation for 3 h at 4 °C using Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) preloaded with antibodies against the C terminus of Mgm1. Samples were eluted from the beads with SDS-containing buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Mgm1 bands were cut and subjected to N-terminal sequencing by Edman degradation (TOPLAB GmbH, Germany). Localization of Mgm1—In a first approach to determine the submitochondrial location of Mgm1, two different derivatives of precursors of Mgm1, Mgm1-(1–228)-dihydrofolate reductase and Mgm1-(1–427), were imported into isolated yeast mitochondria (Fig. 1). Both precursors were processed upon import, yielding proteins of 47 kDa (Fig. 1A) and 43 kDa (Fig. 1B), respectively. This corresponds to the removal of the N-terminal 9-kDa mitochondrial targeting sequence of Mgm1 by the mitochondrial processing peptidase (MPP). When proteinase K was added after import, the mature proteins were protected from digestion in mitochondria, indicating that the precursors were transported across the outer membrane. When the outer membrane was selectively opened by hypoosmotic shock (swelling), the imported and processed proteins became sensitive to proteinase K. The inner membrane was not ruptured after swelling, since matrix proteins were not degraded and the ADP/ATP carrier (Aac2) was converted to a fragment indicative of proteolytic attack from the intermembrane space (data not shown). Taken together, both Mgm1 precursor proteins became localized in the intermembrane space after import in vitro. As expected for proteins containing an N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence, the import of both precursors was dependent on the presence of membrane potential, ΔΨ. We conclude that residues 1–228 are sufficient to localize Mgm1 to the intermembrane space. In a second approach, we studied the submitochondrial distribution of endogenous Mgm1. Isolated yeast mitochondria were treated with proteinase K and subjected to SDS-electrophoresis and immunoblotting using antibodies directed against a C-terminal (Fig. 1C) and an internal epitope of Mgm1 (Fig. 1D). Endogenous Mgm1 was protected from digestion by proteinase K in mitochondria in both cases. After selective opening of the outer membrane, both isoforms of Mgm1 were digested by the protease. Swelling efficiency and the intactness of the inner membrane after swelling were controlled by decorating the same Western blots with antibodies against Oxa1 and Aac2; fragments characteristic for mitochondria with opened outer membrane and intact inner membrane were observed (26Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2217-2226Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 27Pfanner N. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7528-7536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, the C terminus and the internal epitope (residues 484–497) of both Mgm1 isoforms are located in the intermembrane space. This is consistent with the localization proposed by Wong et al. (2Wong E.D. Wagner J.A. Gorsich S.W. McCaffery J.M. Shaw J.M. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 341-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) and by two recent reports (3Wong E.D. Wagner J.A. Scott S.V. Okreglak V. Holewinske T.J. Cassidy-Stone A. Nunnari J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 4Sesaki, H., Southard, S. M., Yaffe, M. P., and Jensen, R. E. (2003) Mol. Biol. Cell, in pressGoogle Scholar). Also, the human ortholog OPA1 was recently localized to this subcompartment (17Olichon A. Emorine L.J. Descoins E. Pelloquin L. Brichese L. Gas N. Guillou E. Delettre C. Valette A. Hamel C.P. Ducommun B. Lenaers G. Belenguer P. FEBS Lett. 2002; 523: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In summary, both isoforms of Mgm1, the large isoform (l-Mgm1; 97 kDa) and the short isoform (s-Mgm1; 84 kDa) are located in the intermembrane space. Determination of the N Termini of Both Mgm1 Isoforms—In order to further analyze the structure of the two isoforms, their N termini were determined. To this end, mitochondria were solubilized, and Mgm1 was immunoprecipitated using an antibody raised against the C terminus. After SDS-PAGE and blotting onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, the bands corresponding to the two isoforms were cut out from the membrane, and the respective N termini were determined by Edman degradation (Fig. 2A). In the case of l-Mgm1, the N-terminal sequence was ISHFPKII, corresponding to amino acid residues 81–88 of Mgm1. Since there is an MPP consensus site (28Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar) after residue Ser80, we conclude that l-Mgm1 is generated by MPP cleavage immediately after the mitochondrial targeting sequence of Mgm1. In the case of s-Mgm1, the two peptides ATLIAATS and LIAATS were found in similar amounts. These peptides correspond to amino acid residues 161–168 and 163–168, respectively. We suggest that the initial cleavage takes place after Thr160 and that the further removal of two residues is caused by other peptidases in the intermembrane space or during the preparation of cell extracts. Still, the possibility is not excluded that the initial cleavage of Mgm1 can occur after Thr160 as well as after Thr162. Membrane Association of Mgm1—Mgm1 contains a predicted transmembrane segment from residue 94 to 113, which, as shown above, is only present in l-Mgm1 and not in s-Mgm1. Therefore, the two isoforms should differ in their membrane association. In order to address this, mitochondria were swollen to rupture the outer membrane and then extracted with either low salt, high salt, or sodium carbonate, and membranes were separated by ultracentrifugation. Neither of the two isoforms of Mgm1 was released from mitochondria by swelling alone, indicating that they are not soluble proteins in the intermembrane space (Fig. 2B). With high salt, about 50% of s-Mgm1 was released from the membranes, whereas l-Mgm1 was resistant to salt extraction (Fig. 2B). Treatment with sodium carbonate led to the removal of significant fractions of both isoforms from the membrane (Fig. 2B). However, l-Mgm1 was more resistant, probably because it contains the predicted N-terminal membrane-spanning segment. The incomplete resistance of l-Mgm1 to carbonate extraction can be attributed to the presence of only few amino acid residues on the N-terminal side of the predicted transmembrane segment, leading to a weaker embedding in the membrane. A similar behavior upon alkaline treatment of mitochondria was observed for d-lactate dehydrogenase (Fig. 2B), a protein that is anchored to the inner membrane by a single N-terminal transmembrane segment and faces the intermembrane space (29Rojo E.E. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8040-8047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In contrast, the ADP/ATP carrier (Aac2), an integral membrane protein with six membrane-spanning segments (27Pfanner N. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 7528-7536Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was completely resistant to extraction by carbonate (Fig. 2B). In order to investigate whether l-Mgm1 and s-Mgm1 differ in their association with either the outer or the inner membrane, we generated mitochondrial membrane vesicles by sonication and fractionated them on a sucrose gradient. Both isoforms of Mgm1 were found to be associated with vesicles derived from both membranes (data not shown). This may be due to the release of Mgm1 from membranes during sonication and subsequent nonspecific binding to vesicles. Such an association with membranes would not be unusual for a dynamin-like protein, since dynamins are known to bind to and spontaneously assemble on lipid vesicles (30Sweitzer S.M. Hinshaw J.E. Cell. 1998; 93: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, this behavior makes it highly unreliable to conclude to which membrane Mgm1 is attached. The Mitochondrial Protease Pcp1 Is Involved in the Generation of s-Mgm1—In order to investigate how the isoforms of Mgm1 are generated, we prepared total cell extracts of different deletion mutants that were deficient in one of the known or putative mitochondrial proteases. In all strains, similar steady state levels of both isoforms of Mgm1 as in wild type were observed, with the exception of the Δpcp1 strain (Fig. 3). In this strain, the band corresponding to s-Mgm1 was absent, whereas the steady state level of l-Mgm1 was increased. Two additional minor bands were observed in the Δpcp1 strain, but they were distinct from s-Mgm1 in size. They are probably the result of nonspecific degradation during the preparation of cell extracts. Thus, the presence of Pcp1 appears to be essential for the generation of s-Mgm1. Pcp1 was shown to be imported into mitochondria in vitro (31Steinmetz L.M. Scharfe C. Deutschbauer A.M. Mokranjac D. Herman Z.S. Jones T. Chu A.M. Giaever G. Prokisch H. Oefner P.J. Davis R.W. Nat. Genet. 2002; 31: 400-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Pcp1 was identified in a recent screen for mutants with aberrant mitochondrial morphology and predicted to be located in the inner membrane of mitochondria (32Dimmer K.S. Fritz S. Fuchs F. Messerschmitt M. Weinbach N. Neupert W. Westermann B. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). In that study, the Δpcp1 strain showed a phenotype strikingly similar to that of the Δmgm1 strain; both strains have fragmented mitochondria and cannot grow on nonfermentable carbon sources (10Guan K. Farh L. Marshall T.K. Deschenes R.J. Curr. Genet. 1993; 24: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 11Jones B.A. Fangman W.L.

On the basis of sequence comparison, seven putative chloroplastic Trxs have been identified, four belonging to the <i>m</i>-type, two belonging to the <i>f</i>-type, and one belonging to a new <i>x</i>-type. In the present work, these isoforms were produced and purified as recombinant proteins without their putative transit peptides.

The study confirms the strict specificity of fructose-bisphosphatase for Trx <i>f</i>, reveals that some Trxs are unable to activate NADP-malate dehydrogenase, and shows that the new <i>x</i>-type is the most efficient substrate for peroxiredoxin while being inactive toward the two other targets. This suggests that this isoform might be specifically involved in resistance against oxidative stress. Three-dimensional modeling shows that one of the <i>m</i>-type Trxs, Trx <i>m</i>3, which has no activity with any of the three targets, exhibits a negatively charged surface surrounding the active site. A green fluorescent protein approach confirms the plastidial localization of these Trxs."
https://openalex.org/W2082056536,"Cell adhesion and communication are interdependent aspects of cell behavior that are critical for morphogenesis and tissue architecture. In the skin, epidermal adhesion is mediated in part by specialized cell-cell junctions known as desmosomes, which are characterized by the presence of desmosomal cadherins, known as desmogleins and desmocollins. We identified a cadherin family member, desmoglein 4, which is expressed in the suprabasal epidermis and hair follicle. The essential role of desmoglein 4 in skin was established by identifying mutations in families with inherited hypotrichosis, as well as in the lanceolate hair mouse. We also show that DSG4 is an autoantigen in pemphigus vulgaris. Characterization of the phenotype of naturally occurring mutant mice revealed disruption of desmosomal adhesion and perturbations in keratinocyte behavior. We provide evidence that desmoglein 4 is a key mediator of keratinocyte cell adhesion in the hair follicle, where it coordinates the transition from proliferation to differentiation."

We hypothesized that these alterations reflect an aging-induced proinflammatory shift in vascular regulatory mechanisms. Thus, in isolated coronary arteries of young (3-month-old) and aged (25-month-old) male Fischer 344 rats the expression of 96 cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors were screened by a cDNA-based microarray technique. In aged vessels expressions of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (3.3x), interleukin (IL)-1beta (3.0x), IL-6 (2.9x), IL-6Ralpha (2.8x) and IL-17 (6.1x) genes were significantly increased over young vessels. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction confirmed these results. Western blotting demonstrated that protein expressions of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-17 were also significantly increased in vessels of aged rats compared with those of young rats. Immunofluorescent double labeling showed that in aged vessels IL-1beta and IL-6 are predominantly localized in the endothelium, whereas TNF-alpha and IL-17 are localized in smooth muscle. Thus, a proinflammatory shift in the profile of vascular cytokine expression may contribute to the aging-induced phenotypic changes in coronary arteries, promoting the development of ischemic heart disease in the elderly."
https://openalex.org/W2147068335,"While it is thought that advanced glycation end products (AGEs) act by stimulating transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta to mediate diabetic injury, we report that AGEs can activate TGF-beta signaling, Smads, and mediate diabetic scarring directly and independently of TGF-beta. AGEs activate Smad2/3 in renal and vascular cells at 5 min, peaking over 15-30 min before TGF-beta synthesis at 24 h and occurs in TGF-beta receptor I and II mutant cells. This is mediated by RAGE and ERK/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). In addition, AGEs also activate Smads at 24 h via the classic TGF-beta-dependent pathway. A substantial inhibition of AGE-induced Smad activation and collagen synthesis by ERK/p38 MAPK inhibitors, but not by TGF-beta blockade, suggests that the MAPK-Smad signaling crosstalk pathway is a key mechanism in diabetic scarring. Prevention of AGE-induced Smad activation and collagen synthesis by overexpression of Smad7 indicates that Smad signaling may play a critical role in diabetic complications. This is further supported by the findings that activation of Smad2/3 in human diabetic nephropathy and vasculopathy is associated with local deposition of AGEs and up-regulation of RAGE. Thus, AGEs act by activating Smad signaling to mediate diabetic complications via both TGF-beta-dependent and -independent pathways, shedding new light on the pathogenesis of diabetic organ injury."
https://openalex.org/W2079844104,"Hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIF) mediate complex adaptations to reduced oxygen supply, including neoangiogenesis. Regulation of HIF occurs mainly through oxygen-dependent destruction of its alpha subunit. In the presence of oxygen, two HIFalpha prolyl residues undergo enzymatic hydroxylation, which is required for its proteasomal degradation. We therefore tested whether pharmacological activation of HIFalpha by hydroxylase inhibitors may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of ischemic diseases. Three distinct prolyl 4-hydroxylase inhibitors-l-mimosine (L-Mim), ethyl 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate (3,4-DHB), and 6-chlor-3-hydroxychinolin-2-carbonic acid-N-carboxymethylamid (S956711)-demonstrated similar effects to hypoxia (0.5% O2) by inducing HIFalpha protein in human and rodent cells. L-Mim, S956711, and, less effectively, 3,4-DHB also induced HIF target genes in cultured cells, including glucose transporter 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor, as well as HIF-dependent reporter gene expression. Systemic administration of L-Mim and S956711 in rats led to HIFalpha induction in the kidney. In a sponge model for angiogenesis, repeated local injection of the inhibitors strongly increased invasion of highly vascularized tissue into the sponge centers. In conclusion, structurally distinct inhibitors of prolyl hydroxylation are capable of inducing HIFalpha and HIF target genes in vitro and in vivo and induce adaptive responses to hypoxia, including angiogenesis."

Here, we analyze the molecular events underlying the primary response to the Dpp/BMP morphogen in Drosophila. Throughout development, Dpp transduction causes the graded transcriptional downregulation of the brinker (brk) gene. We first provide significance for the brk expression gradient by showing that different Brk levels repress distinct combinations of wing genes expressed at different distances from Dpp-secreting cells. We then dissect the brk regulatory region and identify two separable elements with opposite properties, a constitutive enhancer and a Dpp morphogen-regulated silencer. Furthermore, we present genetic and biochemical evidence that the brk silencer serves as a direct target for a protein complex consisting of the Smad homologs Mad/Medea and the zinc finger protein Schnurri. Together, our results provide the molecular framework for a mechanism by which the extracellular Dpp/BMP morphogen establishes a finely tuned, graded read-out of transcriptional repression."

By using the anti-leishmanial drug potassium antimony tartrate, we demonstrate that, upon drug exposure, intracellular L. donovani amastigotes undergo apoptotic death characterized by nuclear DNA fragmentation and externalization of phosphatidylserine. Changes upstream of DNA fragmentation included generation of reactive oxygen species like superoxide, nitric oxide, and hydrogen peroxide that were primarily concentrated in the parasitophorous vacuoles. In the presence of antioxidants like N-acetylcysteine or Mn(III) tetrakis(4-benzoic acid)porphyrin chloride, an inhibitor of inducible nitric-oxide synthase, a diminution of reactive oxygen species generation and improvement of amastigote survival were observed, suggesting a close link between drug-induced oxidative stress and amastigote death. Changes downstream to reactive oxygen species increase involved elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations in both the parasite and the host that was preventable by antioxidants. Flufenamic acid, a non-selective cation channel blocker, decreased the elevation of Ca2+ in both the cell types and reduced amastigote death, thus establishing a central role of Ca2+ in intracellular parasite clearance. This influx of Ca2+ was preceded by a fall in the amastigote mitochondrial membrane potential. Therefore, this study projects the importance of flufenamic acid-sensitive non-selective cation channels as important modulators of antimonial efficacy and lends credence to the suggestion that, within the host cell, apoptosis is the preferred mode of death for the parasites.

Therefore, this study projects the importance of flufenamic acid-sensitive non-selective cation channels as important modulators of antimonial efficacy and lends credence to the suggestion that, within the host cell, apoptosis is the preferred mode of death for the parasites. Apoptosis, a morphologically distinct form of cell death that is crucial for embryogenesis, tissue homeostasis, and disease control in metazoans, has also been demonstrated in unicellular organisms including yeast and protozoan parasites (1Ameisen J.C. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 367-393Google Scholar, 2Madeo F. Frohlich E. Frohlich K.U. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 729-734Google Scholar, 3Welburn S.C. Lillico S. Murphy N.B. Mem. Inst.

The protozoan parasites have a digenic life cycle, residing as flagellated extracellular promastigotes in the gut of the insect vector or as obligatory intracellular amastigotes found in the parasitophorous vacuoles of mammalian macrophages. Within the protozoan parasite group, Leishmania spp., the causative agents of various forms of leishmaniasis (7Chang K.P. Dwyer D.M. Science. 1976; 193: 678-680Google Scholar) are one of the most well studied genera for expression of apoptosis-like phenotypes in extracellular forms induced by exposure to various death-inducing stimuli. For example, stationary phase promastigotes and axenic amastigotes of Leishmania donovani, Leishmania major, and Leishmania mexicana show a DNA fragmentation pattern in multiples of oligonucleosomal length units when undergoing death in culture, thus demonstrating the expression of a hallmark of apoptosis (5Lee N. Bertholet S. Debrabant A. Muller J. Duncan R. Nakhasi H.L. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 53-64Google Scholar, 6Zangger H. Mottram J.C. Fasel N. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1126-1139Google Scholar). Exposure of axenic amastigotes of Leishmania infantum to an antimonial compound (SbIII) yields similar results (8Sereno D. Cavaleyra M. Zemzoumi K. Maquaire S. Ouaissi A. Lemesre J.L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 3097-3102Google Scholar). Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induces nuclear condensation, DNA ladder formation, and activation of caspase-like activity in L. donovani promastigotes that occur through a Ca2+-dependent mechanism (4Das M. Mukherjee S.B. Shaha C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2461-2469Google Scholar, 9Mukherjee S.B. Das M. Sudhandiran G. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24717-24727Google Scholar). The protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine, known to induce apoptosis in all mammalian nucleated cells (10Weil M. Jacobson M.D. Coles H.S. Davies T.J. Gardner R.L. Raff K.D. Raff M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1053-1059Google Scholar), stimulates apoptosis-like death in the promastigotes of L. major (11Arnoult D. Akarid K. Grodet A. Petit P.X. Estaquier J. Ameisen J.C. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 65-81Google Scholar). Not only the Leishmania spp. but also other closely related kinetoplastid parasites of the group Trypanosoma are known to use apoptotic death to control cell proliferation in the insect vector mid gut and in vitro (12Welburn S.C. Maudlin I. Med. Vet. Entomol. 1997; 11: 286-289Google Scholar). All the above studies describe apoptotic phenotype in promastigote forms that are either encountered in the insect gut or in the mammalian blood stream. Investigations on promastigotes yield important information, but their utility is limited because the promastigote form is not a clinically relevant stage although they transmit the disease. The actual survival of intracellular amastigotes encountered in the mammalian host determines disease pathogenesis. Importantly, promastigote and amastigote forms surviving in two disparate biological environments are very different in terms of metabolic pathways and their susceptibility to anti-leishmanial compounds (13Berman J.D. Waddell D. Hanson B.D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1985; 27: 916-920Google Scholar, 14Roberts W.L. Berman J.D. Rainey P.M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1234-1239Google Scholar). Therefore, observations with intracellular amastigotes addressing questions related to parasite survival are more relevant and could lay the foundation for rational strategies of drug development. However, mechanisms of parasite death inside the macrophages remain elusive, and there is no clear consensus in the literature regarding the manner by which the intracellular protozoan parasites are killed. To our knowledge, two recent reports suggest that intracellular amastigotes of the kinetoplastid parasites upon exposure to death-inducing stimuli show DNA breakage, but the kinetics of DNA fragmentation or the mechanisms inducing such changes are not known (6Zangger H. Mottram J.C. Fasel N. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1126-1139Google Scholar, 15Holzmuller P. Sereno D. Cavaleyra M. Mangot I. Daulouede S. Vincendeau P. Lemesre. J.L. Infect.

ROS is known to induce apoptosis in metazoans (20Mignotte B. Vayssiere J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 252: 1-15Google Scholar) and in unicellular organisms existing outside the host cell (4Das M. Mukherjee S.B. Shaha C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2461-2469Google Scholar, 9Mukherjee S.B. Das M. Sudhandiran G. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24717-24727Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that ROS generation might have a direct bearing on apoptotic death of intracellular parasites, but this phenomenon has not been examined adequately. ROS is also generated by anti-leishmanial drugs like antimonials in blood (21Rais S. Perianin A. Lenoir M. Sadak A. Rivollet D. Paul M. Deniau M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 2406-2410Google Scholar), but it is not known whether this is directly linked to apoptotic death of amastigote forms of Leishmania spp. It remains to be shown whether apoptotic pathway of death is an inherent feature of intracellular parasitic life style because the features and mechanisms of apoptotic death in intracellular parasitic forms have not been sufficiently described. The idea that, while existing in closely knit groups, unicellular organisms acquire a new level of individuality and can express features of apoptosis under situations of stress prompted us to explore whether or not, while living in close association inside the macrophages, the parasites have the capability to undergo apoptosis. Also, if there is apoptotic death, what are the associative mechanisms of the process? Earlier studies from this laboratory have shown that the promastigotes of L. donovani undergo apoptosis in response to H2O2 via a Ca2+-mediated mechanism induced by oxidative stress (4Das M. Mukherjee S.B. Shaha C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2461-2469Google Scholar, 9Mukherjee S.B. Das M. Sudhandiran G. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24717-24727Google Scholar); therefore, we asked whether intracellular amastigote death involves similar features or uses different mechanisms. To address this issue, we used a model of drug-induced intracellular amastigote death to study the changes associated with amastigote clearance. The findings project a new possibility that, under conditions of drug exposure, nonselective cation channels in both the host and the parasite are important modulators of drug efficacy. Importantly, it lends acceptance to the suggestion that, in situations of close existence of the parasites, such as within the host cell, apoptosis is the preferred mode of death.

Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2461-2469Google Scholar, 9Mukherjee S.B. Das M. Sudhandiran G. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24717-24727Google Scholar). Briefly, the cultures were grown on slants containing 1% glucose, 5.2% brain heart infusion agar extract, and rabbit blood (6%, v/v) at 25 °C. Macrophages—J774A.1 macrophage cell line (ATCC no. TIB-67) was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 4 mm l-glutamine adjusted to contain 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 4.5 g/liter glucose, and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and air. Infected Macrophages—J774A.1cells (5 × 105 cells/ml) were seeded on coverslips and incubated overnight using DMEM containing 10% FCS. After 24 h, these cells were incubated with L. donovani promastigotes (5 × 106) in the log phase of growth in serum-free media for 2–6 h. The infected cells were then maintained in DMEM containing 10% FCS from 1–18 h at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and air. Before use, loosely adherent promastigotes were removed from the macrophages by incubation of the cells for 3 min in cold distilled water. Purified Amastigotes—J774A.1 cells grown in 125-mm tissue culture flasks infected with L. donovani promastigotes (as per procedures described above) were used to purify amastigotes by the method of Chang and Hendricks (22Chang K.P. Hendricks L.D. Leishmaniasis. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., New York1985: 213-244Google Scholar) with a few modifications. Briefly, flasks containing infected J774A.1 were flushed, and cells were harvested and centrifuged. The cells were then subjected to freezing in liquid nitrogen with subsequent thawing at 37 °C for four cycles. The released amastigotes and disrupted macrophages were spun at 400 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was suspended in DMEM containing 10% FCS. This suspension was loaded onto a Percoll gradient (20–40-90%) and spun in a swing rotor (S40) in a Jouan 4i (Saint Herblain, France) centrifuge at 1200 × g for 1 h. Amastigotes were collected using a Pasteur pipette from the appropriate layer and viewed under a phase contrast microscope for purity check. To rule out any toxic effect of the drug on the host cell, potassium antimony tartrate (PAT) was used at different doses (10–50 μg/ml) to incubate uninfected macrophages and cell viability was determined at 36 h. For assessment of anti-leishmanial activity of the drug, infected macrophages were incubated with selected doses of PAT from 3 to 36 h. For cell treatments in Ca2+-related studies, nifedipine was used at a concentration of 100 μm and flufenamic acid (FFA) was used at a concentration of 200 μm. For Ca2+ chelation, 0.3 and 3 mm EGTA was used in the extracellular media. Antioxidants, NAC and MnTBAP were used at concentrations of 20 mm and 100 μm, respectively. Aminoguanidine, known to be a fairly specific inhibitor of cytokine inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) (23Holstad M. Jansson L. Sandler S. Gen. Pharmacol. 1997; 29: 697-700Google Scholar), was used as a nitric oxide inhibitor at the doses of 50 and 100 μm. To visualize the infection rate of the macrophages, coverslips containing infected J774A.1 cells were treated with cold water for 3 min with mild shaking to dislodge loosely bound promastigotes. Coverslips were then washed thoroughly with phosphate-buffered saline and stained with propidium iodide (PI) (7.5 μg/ml) containing digitonin (0.05%) for permeabilization for 5 min so that both the macrophage and amastigote nuclei take up PI to make counting comfortable. The coverslips were mounted in 10% glycerol and infection was checked either with a Nikon Optiphot fluorescence microscope or a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope (Zeiss Inc, Thornwood, NY). For confocal microscopy, a 488-nm argon ion laser was used to excite the cells and a 560-nm long pass filter was used to collect images for the PI stain. Phase contrast images were collected in the transmission mode, both images were overlapped when necessary, and the number of amastigotes counted. Only well rounded nuclei showing PI stain were counted as surviving amastigotes because irregular structures may represent disrupted nuclei of cells undergoing death. At least 200 cells of four independent experiments were counted. All counts were carried out on coded samples. Measures of both the number of infected cells and the number of amastigotes/100 cells were taken at different intervals to arrive at a time point that could be used as time 0 for drug treatment. Following drug treatment, drug activity was estimated by calculating percentage of growth inhibition by estimating the number of amastigotes/100 infected macrophages in treated wells divided by the number of amastigotes/100 infected macrophages in untreated wells × 100. Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase Enzyme (TdT)-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL)—Detection of DNA fragmentation by TUNEL was carried out using a TUNEL assay kit according to instructions from the manufacturer and as described previously (4Das M. Mukherjee S.B. Shaha C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2461-2469Google Scholar, 9Mukherjee S.B. Das M. Sudhandiran G. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24717-24727Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and postfixation permeabilization was carried out with 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 10 min at room temperature followed by incubation with buffer containing nucleotide mix (50 μm fluorescein-12-dUTP, 100 μm dATP, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.6) for 1 h at 37 °C. Detection was carried out by both flow cytometry and microscopy. Flow Cytometry—Formaldehyde fixed cells (106) stained for TUNEL were analyzed on an Elite ESP flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA) using an argon ion laser tuned to 488 nm. Green fluorescence gated on forward and side light scatter was collected using a band-pass filter (525 ± 10 nm) and displayed using logarithmic amplification. Microscopy—TUNEL labeling was visualized with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope using plan-neofluor objectives of 40× or 100× with numerical apertures of 0.75 and 1.3, respectively. Pinhole was set at 100 μm. For detection of green TUNEL-stained nuclei and red PI counterstain, cells were simultaneously illuminated with 488- and 563-nm laser lines and fluorescence was collected with a 500–550-nm band pass filter for green fluorescence detection and a 560-nm long pass filter for red fluorescence. Individual frames were averaged over four to eight frames. Laser was used at 13% power. Serial z-sections of each field were captured sequentially, and the sections were collected at 0.5-μm intervals in the z axis through a 40× objective. Agarose Gel DNA Analysis—Isolation of DNA from amastigotes and agarose gel electrophoresis was carried out as described previously (4Das M. Mukherjee S.B. Shaha C. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2461-2469Google Scholar, 9Mukherjee S.B. Das M. Sudhandiran G. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24717-24727Google Scholar). Amastigotes harvested from infected macrophages and subsequently Percoll purified were incubated with annexin V conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (1:50) for 30 min at room temperature in dark. Cells were then lightly permeabilized and stained by a solution containing digitonin (0.01%) and PI (7.5 μg/ml), respectively. The staining was visualized through a confocal microscope by simultaneously illuminating the cells with 488- and 563-nm laser lines, and fluorescence was collected with a 500–550-nm band pass filter for green fluorescence and a 560-nm long pass filter for red fluorescence detection. To monitor the level of ROS, the cell permeant probe H2DCFDA was used as described previously (9Mukherjee S.B. Das M. Sudhandiran G. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24717-24727Google Scholar). H2DCFDA is a nonpolar compound that readily diffuses into cells, where it is hydrolyzed to the nonfluorescent derivative dichlorodihydrofluorescein and trapped within the cells. In the presence of a proper oxidant, dichlorodihydrofluorescein is oxidized to the highly fluorescent 2,7-dichlorofluorescein. Cells from different treatment groups were suspended in DMEM and incubated with H2DCFDA (2 μg/ml) for 15 min in the dark. Relative fluorescence was monitored in a PerkinElmer LS50B Spectrofluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) set at an excitation wavelength of 507 nm and emission wavelength of 530 nm with a slit width of 5 nm. Data were normalized to values obtained from vehicle-treated controls. For each experiment, fluorometric measurements were performed in triplicate and expressed as fluorescence intensity units (FIU). For microscopy, cells were illuminated with a 488-nm laser and images were collected using a band pass filter (505–550 nm) with the pinhole set at 100 μm. Laser was used at 13–15% power, and individual frames were averaged over four to eight frames. Collecting the fluorescent image with a single rapid scan minimized the effects of dichlorodihydrofluorescein photo-oxidation. Identical parameters were used for different groups. For measurement of O2·¯, lucigenin was used as an indicator of O2·¯ (24Wang H.D. Pagano P.J. Du Y. Cayatte A.J. Quinn M.T. Brecher P. Cohen R.A. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 810-818Google Scholar). Typically, 1 × 106 cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of buffer. 50 μl of suspended cells was mixed with 50 μl of 2 mm lucigenin (dissolved in reaction buffer, phosphate-buffered saline, 1 g of glucose/liter, and 2 mm MgCl2). The reaction was placed in the dark for 10 min and then read using a luminometer (Lumicount, Packard, CT). Data are expressed as luminometer units. NO detection was carried out as per protocol from the manufacturer. Briefly, treated and untreated cells were incubated with the fluorescence probe DAF-FM (1 μm) for 30 min and washed two times, and NO generation was measured at excitation of 495 nm and emission at 515 nm with a LS-50B spectrofluorometer. Data are expressed as FIU at 515 nm. Reduced glutathione (GSH) was measured as described previously (9Mukherjee S.B. Das M. Sudhandiran G. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24717-24727Google Scholar). Mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) was measured using JC-1 probe as described previously (9Mukherjee S.B. Das M. Sudhandiran G. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24717-24727Google Scholar). JC-1 is a cationic mitochondrial vital dye that is lipophilic and becomes concentrated in the mitochondria in proportion to the membrane potential; more dye accumulates in mitochondria with greater Δψm and ATP generating capacity. Therefore, the fluorescence of JC-1 can be considered as an indicator of relative mitochondrial energy state. The dye exists as a monomer at low concentrations (emission, 530 nm, green fluorescence) but at higher concentrations forms J-aggregates (emission, 590 nm, red fluorescence). Briefly, cells after different treatments were collected and incubated for 7 min with 10 μm JC-1 at 37 °C, washed, resuspended in media, and measured for fluorescence at two different wavelengths as mentioned above. The ratio of the reading at 590 nm to the reading at 530 nm (590/530 ratio) was considered as the relative Δψm value. Changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration, [Ca2+]i, were monitored with the fluorescent probe fluo-3/AM as described previously (9Mukherjee S.B. Das M. Sudhandiran G. Shaha C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24717-24727Google Scholar). Briefly, purified amastigotes or infected macrophages were loaded for 30 min at 25 °C with 5 μm fluo-3/AM containing 1 μm pluronic acid F-127 for proper dispersal and 0.25 mm sulfinpyrazone, an organic anion transport inhibitor, to inhibit the leakage of the fluo-3 dye. Just before use, a sample of loaded cells was washed with medium to remove nonhydrolyzed fluo-3/AM. Fluorescence measurements were performed at 25 °C with excitation at 488 nm and emission at 522 nm. To convert fluorescence values into absolute [Ca2+]i, calibration was performed at the end of each experiment. [Ca2+]i was calculated using the equation: [Ca2+]i = Kd[(F – Fmin)/(Fmax – F)], where Kd is the dissociation constant of the Ca2+·Fluo 3 complex (400 nm) and F represents the fluorescence intensity of the cells. Fmax represents the maximum fluorescence (obtained by treating cells with 10 μm calcium ionophore A23187), and Fmin corresponds to the minimum fluorescence (obtained from ionophore-treated cells in the presence of 3 mm EGTA). Fluorescence intensities were expressed as the increase in fluorescence with respect to base-line fluorescence intensity before stimulation. For microscopic detection of fluo-3 staining in infected macrophages, fluo-3-labeled cells were probed by a single rapid scan with a 488-nm argon ion laser and images collected by using a 530-nm filter. Nomarski images were collected in the transmission mode and overlapped with the fluo-3 images. Paired comparisons were conducted using a paired t test, and all data are presented as mean values ± S.E. Differences were considered significant at a 0.05 level of confidence. Potassium Antimony Tartrate Is Cytotoxic to L. donovani Amastigotes Residing within J774A.1 Cells—Host cell entry by promastigote protozoa involves the formation of membrane-bound PVs, where they transform into the immotile amastigote forms (25Rittig M.G. Bogdan C. Parasitol. Today. 2000; 16: 292-297Google Scholar). The success of these organisms in surviving within the PVs determines pathogenesis of a disease. To arrive at a time point with optimum infection that could be used as a model system to study amastigote changes induced by the anti-leishmanicidal drug used, macrophages were checked at different time points after termination of co-incubation with the promastigotes. It was observed that, after 18 h in serum-rich media, ∼18 amastigotes/macrophage were visible (no. of amastigotes/macrophage at 0 h, 2 ± 0.01; at 6 h, 8 ± 1; at 12 h, 14 ± 2; at 18 h, 18 ± 2 (n = 5)). The percentages of macrophages that could be infected in a given experiment varied between 92 and 95%. The last time point (18 h) was used as time 0 for initiation of drug treatment. For combating visceral leishmaniasis, the most commonly used anti-leishmanicidal drug is sodium stibogluconate, a pentavalent antimonial that is targeted to destroy parasites within the PVs (26Harder A. Greif G. Haberkorn A. Parasitol. Res. 2001; 87: 778-780Google Scholar). We chose PAT, a trivalent antimonial, because pentavalent antimony is converted to trivalent antimony inside macrophages before it can be cytotoxic to the parasites; therefore, trivalent antimony is the active form of pentavalent antimony (27Ephros M. Bitnun A. Shaked P. Waldman E. Zilberstein D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 278-282Google Scholar, 28Frezard F. Demicheli C. Ferreira C.S. Costa M.A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 2001; 45: 913-916Google Scholar). Prior to assessing the anti-leishmanicidal activities of PAT toward L. donovani amastigotes residing within J774A.1 cells, toxicity of the drug (10, 15, 20, 25, and 50 μg/ml) on uninfected J774A.1 cells was evaluated to rule out doses that would affect the host cell. With 50 μg of PAT, within 12 h ∼45% macrophages were dead, a feature reported for pentavalent antimony that is toxic at high doses to THP-1 cells (8Sereno D. Cavaleyra M. Zemzoumi K. Maquaire S. Ouaissi A. Lemesre J.L. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 3097-3102Google Scholar). Although 20 and 25 μg/ml amounts of the drug did not have significant effect on macrophages in terms of cell death, the adhering capacity of the macrophages was compromised by 36 h. The doses of 10 and 15 μg/ml PAT were neither cytotoxic to macrophages nor did they reduce their adhering capacity by 36 h. Therefore, we tested these two doses for their cytotoxic activity on amastigotes to arrive at a suitable time frame within which the effects of the drug on the amastigotes could be studied. To determine the rate of clearance, permeabilized PI-stained treated and untreated infected macrophages were used for counting the number of amastigotes in the host cell by visualization using both phase contrast and fluorescence images (Fig. 1, inset ii). The dose of 15 μg/ml was found to be the appropriate dose because that could reduce the number of amastigotes si"
https://openalex.org/W2080437238,"Calmodulin (CaM) is a ubiquitous Ca2+-binding protein that regulates the ryanodine receptors (RyRs) by direct binding. CaM inhibits the skeletal muscle ryanodine receptor (RyR1) and cardiac muscle receptor (RyR2) at >1 μm Ca2+ but activates RyR1 and inhibits RyR2 at <1 μm Ca2+. Here we tested whether CaM regulates RyR2 by binding to a highly conserved site identified previously in RyR1. Deletion of RyR2 amino acid residues 3583–3603 resulted in background [35S]CaM binding levels. In single channel measurements, deletion of the putative CaM binding site eliminated CaM inhibition of RyR2 at Ca2+ concentrations below and above 1 μm. Five RyR2 single or double mutants in the CaM binding region (W3587A, L3591D, F3603A, W3587A/L3591D, L3591D/F3603A) eliminated or greatly reduced [35S]CaM binding and inhibition of single channel activities by CaM depending on the Ca2+ concentration. An RyR2 mutant, which assessed the effects of 4 amino acid residues that differ between RyR1 and RyR2 in or flanking the CaM binding domain, bound [35S]CaM and was inhibited by CaM, essentially identical to wild type (WT)-RyR2. Three RyR1 mutants (W3620A, L3624D, F3636A) showed responses to CaM that differed from corresponding mutations in RyR2. The results indicate that CaM regulates RyR1 and RyR2 by binding to a single, highly conserved CaM binding site and that other RyR type-specific sites are likely responsible for the differential functional regulation of RyR1 and RyR2 by CaM.

Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 2Fill M. Copello J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 893-922Google Scholar, 3Meissner G. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: d2072-d2080Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, three structurally and functionally related RyR isoforms include RyR1, predominant in skeletal muscle, RyR2, predominant in cardiac muscle, and RyR3, which was initially isolated from brain but is found in many tissues. The three isoforms are comprised of four 560-kDa RyR subunits and four 12-kDa FK506-binding protein subunits. Multiple endogenous effectors regulate the RyRs, including Ca2+, Mg2+, ATP, and calmodulin (CaM) (1Franzini-Armstrong C. Protasi F. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 699-729Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 2Fill M. Copello J.A. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 893-922Google Scholar, 3Meissner G. Front. Biosci. 2002; 7: d2072-d2080Google Scholar, 4Balshaw D.M. Yamaguchi N. Meissner G. J. Membr. Biol. 2002; 185: 1-8Google Scholar).CaM is a ubiquitous cytosolic Ca2+-binding protein that modulates proteins through CaM-dependent protein kinases or by direct binding (5Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Google Scholar). CaM modulates the RyRs by direct binding since CaM affects channel function in the absence of ATP (6Meissner G. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 244-251Google Scholar, 7Meissner G. Henderson J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3065-3073Google Scholar). CaM inhibits all three RyRs at Ca2+ concentrations above 1 μm; however, differences in the regulation of the RyRs at submicromolar Ca2+ concentrations have been described. At free Ca2+ concentrations below 1 μm, CaM has a stimulatory effect on RyR1 and RyR3 channel activities (8Buratti R. Prestipino G. Menegazzi P. Treves S. Zorzato F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1995; 213: 1082-1090Google Scholar, 9Tripathy A. Xu L. Mann G. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1995; 69: 106-119Google Scholar, 10Chen S.R.W. Li X. Ebisawa K. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24234-24246Google Scholar), whereas RyR2 is unaffected (11Fruen B.R. Bardy J.M Byrem T.M. Strasburg G.M. Louis C.F. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: C724-C733Google Scholar) or inhibited (12Balshaw D.M. Xu L. Yamaguchi N. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20144-20153Google Scholar) by CaM.Studies investigating the CaM binding properties of the RyRs have focused on RyR1. Trypsin digestion and peptide binding studies indicate that Ca2+-free CaM (apoCaM) and Ca2+-bound CaM (CaCaM) bind RyR1 amino acid residues 3614–3643 (13Rodney G.G. Moore C.P. Williams B.Y. Zhang J.Z. Krol J. Pedersen S.E. Hamilton S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2069-2074Google Scholar, 14Moore C.P. Rodney G. Zhang J.Z. Santacruz-Toloza L. Strasburg G. Hamilton S.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 8532-8537Google Scholar). Mutations in this region resulted in loss of high affinity CaCaM and apoCaM binding and modulation of RyR1 channel activity (15Yamaguchi N. Xin C. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22579-22585Google Scholar).The present study was undertaken to identify the CaM binding sites in RyR2. We generated eight RyR2 mutants focusing on the domain corresponding to the apo- and CaCaM regulatory domain that is highly conserved between RyR1 and RyR2. One mutant assessed the significance of a 1,5,10 CaM recognition motif (5Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Google Scholar) by substituting a corresponding amino acid residue in RyR1 and RyR2. The results of the study show that (i) like RyR1, RyR2 has a high affinity CaM binding domain that is shared by apoCaM and CaCaM; (ii) deletion of the CaM binding site eliminates inhibition of RyR2 by CaM at submicromolar and micromolar Ca2+; and (iii) corresponding mutations in the CaM binding site differentially alter the CaM binding properties and regulation by CaM of the skeletal and cardiac RyRs.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—[3H]Ryanodine was obtained from Perkin Elmer Life Sciences, Tran35S label was obtained from ICN Radiochemicals (Costa Mesa, CA), unlabeled ryanodine was obtained from Calbiochem, unlabeled CaM was obtained from Sigma, Complete protease inhibitors were obtained from Roche Applied Science, and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells were obtained from ATCC. Full-length RyR2 cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Junichi Nakai at National Institute of Physiological Sciences, Okazaki, Japan.Construction of Mutant cDNAs—The full-length rabbit RyR2 cDNA (16Nakai J. Imagawa T. Hakamata Y. Shigekawa M. Takeshima H. Numa S. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 169-177Google Scholar) was subcloned into pCIneo. Single and multiple base changes and deletions were introduced by Pfu-turbo polymerase-based chain reaction by using mutagenic oligonucleotides and the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The complete mutated sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. A 721-bp fragment (ClaI/SacII, 10483–11203) subcloned into pBluescript vector (Stratagene) was used as template for mutagenesis of RyR2. The fragment with the mutation was subcloned back into the original position of RyR2 in two steps: to a vector containing a BbrPI/SacII (residues 5038–11203) fragment and to full-length RyR2 in pCIneo.The full-length rabbit RyR1 cDNA (ClaI/XbaI) was subcloned into pCMV5 (17Gao L. Tripathy A. Lu X. Meissner G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 223-226Google Scholar). For construction of RyR1-F3636A, a 243-bp RyR1 cDNA fragment (EclXI/BamHI, 10872–11114) subcloned into pBluescript vector was used as template for mutagenesis. The mutated sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing and subcloned back into the original position of RyR1 in three steps: the sequence was subcloned back to a vector containing a PvuI/NdeI (residues 8600–11304) fragment and then back to a vector containing a PvuI/XbaI (residues 8600–15276) fragment, and finally, mutated RyR1 full-length plasmids were prepared by ligation of two fragments (ClaI/PvuI, PvuI/XbaI containing the mutated sequence) and pCMV5 (ClaI/XbaI). Nucleotide numbering is as described (16Nakai J. Imagawa T. Hakamata Y. Shigekawa M. Takeshima H. Numa S. FEBS Lett. 1990; 271: 169-177Google Scholar, 17Gao L. Tripathy A. Lu X. Meissner G.

Cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in high glucose Dulbecco's modified eagle medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and plated the day before transfection. For each 10-cm tissue culture dish, 3.5 μg of cDNA was used. Cells were harvested about 48 h after transfection as described (15Yamaguchi N. Xin C. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22579-22585Google Scholar).[3H]Ryanodine Binding—[3H]Ryanodine binding experiments were performed with crude membrane fractions prepared from HEK293 cells as described (15Yamaguchi N. Xin C. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22579-22585Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, membranes were incubated at room temperature with 2.5 nm [3H]ryanodine in 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 250 mm KCl, 5 mm glutathione (oxidized), 20 μm leupeptin, and 200 μm Pefabloc and the indicated free Ca2+ concentrations. Nonspecific binding was determined using 1000-fold excess of unlabeled ryanodine. After 20 h, aliquots of the samples were diluted with 8.5 volumes of ice-cold water and placed on Whatman GF/B filters preincubated with 2% polyethyleneimine in water. Filters were washed with three 5 ml of ice-cold 100 mm KCl, 1 mm KPipes, pH 7.0. Radioactivity remaining on the filters was determined by liquid scintillation counting to obtain bound [3H]ryanodine.[35S]Calmodulin Binding—[35S]CaM was metabolically labeled using Tran35S label and purified as described (12Balshaw D.M. Xu L. Yamaguchi N. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20144-20153Google Scholar). Crude membrane fractions prepared from HEK293 cells (15Yamaguchi N. Xin C. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22579-22585Google Scholar) were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with 15–200 nm [35S]CaM in 10 mm KPipes, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 0.15 m sucrose, 150 mm KCl, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm glutathione (reduced), 20 μm leupeptin, 200 μm Pefabloc, and 1 mm EGTA plus Ca2+ concentrations to yield <10 nm, 0.4 μm, or 100 μm free Ca2+. Samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 30 p.s.i. in a Beckman Airfuge after aliquots were taken for determination of total radioactivity. Radioactivity in the pellet fractions was determined by scintillation counting to obtain bound [35S]CaM. Nonspecific binding of [35S]CaM was determined by incubating equal protein amounts of membranes obtained from vector-transfected HEK293 cells. In parallel experiments, Bmax values of [3H]ryanodine binding were determined by incubating membranes for 4 h at room temperature with a saturating concentration of [3H]ryanodine (40 nm) in 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 0.6 m KCl, 0.15 m sucrose, 1 mm glutathione (oxidized), 20 μm leupeptin, 200 μm Pefabloc, and 200 μm Ca2+. Specific [3H]ryanodine binding was determined as described above.Single Channel Recordings—Single channel measurements were performed using the planar lipid bilayer method (18Gao L. Balshaw D. Xu L. Tripathy A. Xin C. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 828-840Google Scholar). Planar lipid bilayers contained phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylcholine in the ratio of 5:3:2 (25 mg of total phospholipid/ml of n-decane). Membrane fractions of HEK293 cells expressing wild type (WT) or mutant RyRs were pretreated for 30 min with 1 μm myosin light chain kinase-derived calmodulin binding peptide to remove endogenous CaM (12Balshaw D.M. Xu L. Yamaguchi N. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20144-20153Google Scholar). Final peptide concentration was 10 nm following the addition of membranes to the cis (cytosolic) chamber of the bilayer apparatus. A strong dependence of single channel activities on cis Ca2+ concentration indicated that the large cytosolic “foot” region faced the cis chamber of the bilayers. The trans (lumenal) side of the bilayer was defined as ground. Measurements were made with symmetrical 0.25 m KCl, 20 mm KHepes, pH 7.4, with the indicated concentration of Ca2+. Exogenous CaM was added to the cis solution. Electrical signals were filtered at 2 kHz, digitized at 10 kHz, and analyzed as described (18Gao L. Balshaw D. Xu L. Tripathy A. Xin C. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 828-840Google Scholar). Po values in multichannel recordings were calculated using the equation Po = Σ iPo,i/N, where N is the total number of channels, and Po,i is channel open probability of the ith channel.Biochemical Assays and Data Analysis—Free Ca2+ concentrations were obtained by including in the solutions the appropriate amounts of Ca2+ and EGTA as determined using the stability constants and computer program published by Schoenmakers et al. (19Schoenmakers T.J. Visser G.J. Flik G. Theuvenet A.P. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 870-879Google Scholar). Free Ca2+ concentrations of ≥1 μm were verified with the use of a Ca2+ selective electrode.Results are given as means ± S.E. Significances of differences in the data (p < 0.05) were determined using Student's t test.RESULTSIdentification of the CaM Binding Site in RyR2—Previous mutagenesis studies identified 2 residues in the RyR1 CaM binding domain that were required for high affinity CaCaM binding and inhibition of RyR1 channel activity. One mutation also resulted in loss of apoCaM binding and activation of RyR1 (15Yamaguchi N. Xin C. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22579-22585Google Scholar). Because the region of the RyR1 apoCaM and CaCaM binding site is highly conserved among the RyRs (Fig. 1), we introduced the corresponding mutations into RyR2. Membrane fractions prepared from HEK293 cells transiently expressing WT or mutant RyR2s were incubated with increasing [35S]CaM concentrations in the presence of <10 nm Ca2+ to study apoCaM binding, 0.4 μm Ca2+ (a Ca2+ concentration that results in activation of RyR1 but inhibition of RyR2 by CaM (12Balshaw D.M. Xu L. Yamaguchi N. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20144-20153Google Scholar)), and 100 μm Ca2+ to study CaCaM binding. Bound [35S]CaM activities were measured using a centrifugation assay. The Bmax values of [3H]ryanodine binding were determined in parallel experiments.The tetrameric WT-RyR2 bound [35S]CaM in a concentration-dependent manner with 1.9 ± 0.2 [35S]CaM/high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding site at 200 nm CaM and <10 nm Ca2+, which corresponds to 0.5 CaM/RyR2 subunit (Fig. 2), as there is only one high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding site/RyR2 tetramer. The use of 200 nm CaM likely did not result in saturation binding. However, higher CaM concentrations could not be used because these resulted in high background binding levels. The mean numbers of bound [35S]CaM/RyR2 subunit were 0.65 at 200 nm CaM and 0.4 μm Ca2+ and 0.73 at 75 nm CaM and 100 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 2.). By comparison, WT-RyR1 bound/subunit ∼1 apoCaM at <10 nm Ca2+ and ∼1 CaCaM at 100 μm Ca2+ (15Yamaguchi N. Xin C. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22579-22585Google Scholar). Fig. 2 also shows the [35S]CaM binding properties of RyR2 mutants RyR2-W3587A and RyR2-L3591D that correspond to RyR1-W3620A and RyR1-L3624D. Each RyR1 mutation eliminated CaCaM binding at 100 μm Ca2+ with one of the mutations (RyR1-L3624D) resulting in loss of apoCaM binding at <10 nm Ca2+ (15Yamaguchi N. Xin C. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22579-22585Google Scholar). RyR2-W3587A retained and RyR2-L3591D lost CaM binding at <10 nm Ca2+ (Fig. 2), as observed previously for the two corresponding RyR1 mutants (15Yamaguchi N. Xin C. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22579-22585Google Scholar). However, CaM binding to the RyR2 mutants was not eliminated at 100 μm Ca2+ or 0.4 μm Ca2+. Thus, the corresponding RyR1 and RyR2 mutants have similar apoCaM but different CaCaM binding properties.Fig. 2[35S]CaM binding to WT- and mutant RyR2s. Membrane fractions prepared from HEK293 cells expressing WT or mutant RyR2s were incubated for 2 h at room temperature with indicated concentrations of [35S]CaM in the presence of <10 nm Ca2+ (apoCaM) (top), 0.4 μm Ca2+ (middle), and 100 μm Ca2+ (CaCaM) (bottom). The ratios of [35S]CaM binding values to maximal binding values of [3H]ryanodine were obtained, taking into account that there is one high affinity [3H]ryanodine binding site/RyR2 tetramer. Maximal values of [3H]ryanodine binding (pmol/mg of protein), determined as detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” ranged from 0.4 to 1.2 for WT- and mutant RyR2s. RyR2–4M is RyR2-Q3580Y/R3581K/K3596R/A3606T. Data are the mean ± S.E. of 4–15 experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Preliminary experiments indicated that CaM did not inhibit [3H]ryanodine binding to WT-RyR2 expressed in HEK293 cells (not shown) but was inhibitory in single channel measurements. Membrane fractions prepared from HEK293 cells transiently expressed with WT- and mutant RyR2 cDNAs were incorporated into planar lipid bilayers. Single WT- and mutant RyR2 channel activities were recorded with K+ as current carrier in the absence and presence of exogenously added CaM. The use of K+ rather than Ca2+ as current carrier improved control of the cis Ca2+ concentration (20Xu L. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 2302-2312Google Scholar). The functional effects of 50 nm and 1 μm CaM were examined with 0.4 and 2 μm free Ca2+ in the cis (cytosolic) chamber, i.e. at two Ca2+ concentrations where CaM inhibits the native RyR2. Under these conditions, RyR1 is activated by CaM at 0.4 μm and inhibited at 2 μm free Ca2+ (see Fig. 6). A low micromolar Ca2+ concentration of 2 μm was used because CaM is less effective in inhibiting the RyR2 ion channel at elevated Ca2+ concentrations (12Balshaw D.M. Xu L. Yamaguchi N. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20144-20153Google Scholar).Fig. 6Effects of CaM on single WT-RyR1 and RyR1-F3636A ion channels. Single channel currents were recorded as described in the legend Fig. 3 at –20 mV (downward deflections from closed level, c) in symmetric 0.25 m KCl, 20 mm KHepes, pH 7.4, media with 0.3 μm Ca2+ and 1 mm ATP (left panels) or 2 μm Ca2+ (right panels) in the cis chamber before (top traces) and after the addition of 50 nm CaM (middle traces) and 1 μm CaM (bottom traces).

The averaged channel open probability (Po) of WT-RyR2 in the presence of 0.4 μm free Ca2+ was reduced to 35% of the control activity with 50 nm CaM and to 21% with 1 μm CaM in the cis chamber (Fig. 4). In the presence of 2 μm free Ca2+, 50 nm and 1 μm CaM were less effective in inhibiting WT-RyR2, reducing Po to 73 and 54% of the control, respectively.Fig. 3Effects of CaM on single WT- and mutant RyR2 ion channels. Membrane fractions prepared from HEK293 cells expressing WT-RyR2 (A), RyR2-W3587A (B), RyR2-L3591D (C), or RyR2-Δ3583–3603 (D) were fused with a lipid bilayer. Single channel currents were recorded at –20 mV (downward deflections from closed level, c) in symmetric 0.25 m KCl, 20 mm KHepes, pH 7.4, media with 0.4 μm Ca2+ (left panels) or 2 μm Ca2+ (right panels) before (top traces) and after the addition of 50 nm CaM (middle traces) and 1 μm CaM (bottom traces). Data of 4–8 single channel recordings are summarized in Fig. 4.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 4Channel open probabilities of WT- and mutant RyR2s and RyR1s. Data were obtained as described in legend for Fig. 3. RyR2–4M is RyR2-Q3580Y/R3581K/K3596R/A3606T. Data show the relative mean channel open probability (Po,–CaM = 100%) ± S.E. at 0.4 μm Ca2+ (top) and 2 μm Ca2+ (bottom) of 4–8 single channel recordings for RyR2s, 4–6 single channel recordings for RyR1s.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Single channel recordings showed that at 2 μm Ca2+, CaM inhibited RyR2-W3587A (Figs. 3B and 4) and RyR2-L3591D (Figs. 3C and 4) to an extent comparable with WT-RyR2. These results are in agreement with a similar extent of [35S]CaM binding to wild type and the two mutant RyR2s in the presence of 100 μm Ca2+. In contrast, CaM failed to inhibit RyR2-W3587A and RyR2-L3591D when the Ca2+ concentration was lowered from 2 to 0.4 μm Ca2+ despite the fact that both mutants bound CaM at 0.4 μm Ca2+.Both apoCaM and CaCaM binding to RyR2 was eliminated by deleting 21 amino acid residues (amino acids 3583–3603) (Fig. 2) corresponding to the CaM binding domain of RyR1 (Fig. 1). Loss of CaM binding resulted in loss of inhibition of RyR2-Δ3583–3603 activity by CaM in single channel measurements at 0.4 and 2 μm Ca2+ (Figs. 3D and 4). The deletion of amino acid residues 3583–3603 did not introduce major global protein conformational changes because the mutant displayed a single channel open probability (Po = 0.33 ± 0.12 versus 0.39 ± 0.05 for WT-RyR2 at 2 μm Ca2+), single channel conductance (Fig. 3D), and Ca2+ activation/inactivation profile (Fig. 5) not significantly different from RyR2, as determined in single channel and [3H]ryanodine binding measurements, respectively. The results indicate that like RyR1, RyR2 has a single functional CaM binding site.Fig. 5Ca2+ dependence of [3H]ryanodine binding to WT- and mutant RyR2s. Specific binding was determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” in 0.15 m KCl, 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, media containing 5 mm glutathione (reduced), 2.5 nm [3H]ryanodine, and the indicated Ca2+ concentrations. Normalized [3H]ryanodine binding data are the average of 4–5 experiments. Standard errors were 20% or less.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Role of a 1,5,10 CaM Recognition Motif—RyR2 has a 1,5,10 CaM recognition motif (Val-3599, Phe-3603, Leu-3608) (5Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Google Scholar) that is conserved in RyR1 (Fig. 1). We assessed the significance of this motif in the regulation of the RyRs by CaM by preparing RyR2-F3603A and corresponding RyR1-F3636A. For RyR2-F3603A, CaM binding was at background levels at <10 nm Ca2+ but was present at 0.4 and 100 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 2). The results suggest that RyR2-Phe-3603 is required for apoCaM but not for CaCaM binding. The expression level of RyR1-F3636A was too low to determine its CaM binding levels.Single channel recordings showed that CaM inhibited RyR2-F3603A activity at 2 μm Ca2+ but was without a significant effect at 0.4 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 4). CaM inhibited WT-RyR1 and RyR1-F3636A single channel activities at >1 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 6). A decrease in [3H]ryanodine binding by 1 μm CaM also indicated a decrease in WT and mutant RyR1 activities at >1 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 7). At 0.3 μm Ca2+ in the presence of 1 mm ATP to increase the otherwise very low channel activities, addition of CaM yielded the expected increase in activity of WT-RyR1 in both assays. In contrast, in the presence of 0.3 μm Ca2+, a significant decrease in RyR1-F3636A [3H]ryanodine binding and single channel activities was observed after the addition of 1 μm CaM (although in single channel measurements not at 50 nm CaM). Thus, the loss of CaM modulation of RyR2-F3603A evident at <1 μm Ca 2+ is no longer present when the corresponding Phe in RyR1 is substituted with Ala. Remarkably, the RyR1 mutation led to inhibition by 1 μm CaM at submicromolar Ca2+, as compared with activation of WT-RyR1.Fig. 7CaM inhibition and activation of [3H]ryanodine binding to WT-RyR1 and RyR1-F3636A. Specific [3H]ryanodine binding to WT-RyR1 and RyR1-F3636A were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” in presence of 0.3 μm Ca2+ and 1 mm AMP-PCP (a nonhydrolyzable ATP analog) (top)or25 μm Ca2+ (bottom)inthe absence (open bars) or presence (filled bars) of 1 μm CaM. Normalized [3H]ryanodine binding data are the means ± S.E. of 4–5 experiments. *, p < 0.05, as compared with control (–CaM).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Effects of CaM on Two RyR2 Double Mutations—None of the single site RyR2 mutants described above abolished CaM inhibition of RyR2 at 2 μm Ca2+. The effects of two double mutations (W3587A/L3591D, L3591D/F3603A) were therefore determined. Both mutants had low [35S]CaM binding activities at <10 nm and 100 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 2). Single channel recordings showed that, consistent with the binding data, addition of 50 nm or 1 μm CaM did not inhibit the single channel activity of either mutant at 0.4 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 4). CaM also failed to inhibit RyR2-L3591D/F3603A at 2 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 4). In contrast, at 2 μm Ca2+, CaM inhibited W3587A/L3591D, notwithstanding that the mutant had low CaM binding levels ([35S]CaM/[3H]ryanodine = 0.25 ± 0.15 at 50 nm CaM, as compared with 1.6 ± 0.2 for WT-RyR2, n = 3).Role of RyR2-specific 12-amino-acid Residues—RyR2 has a 12-amino-acid insert near the CaM binding site that is absent from RyR1 (Fig. 1). An RyR2 mutant with a deletion of this region (RyR2-Δ3564–3575) was tested as a possible explanation for the differential regulation of RyR2 and RyR1 by CaM at 0.4 μm Ca2+. The deletion did not alter apoCaM and CaCaM binding (Fig. 2) or CaM inhibition at 0.4 and 2 μm Ca2+ (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the deletion mutant displayed a single channel conductance (not shown) and Ca2+ activation/inactivation profile (Fig. 5) essentially identical to WT-RyR2. The results suggest that the RyR2-specific 12-amino-acid sequence does not directly contribute to modulation by CaM.Role of Nonidentical Amino Acid Residues in or Flanking RyR1 and RyR2 CaM Binding Domains—The CaM binding region identified in RyR2 (amino acids 3583–3603) is highly conserved in RyR1 with a single conserved charge difference where Arg-3629 in RyR1 corresponds to Lys-3596 in RyR2 (Fig. 1). To assess the effects of the nonidentical amino acid residue, as well as three additional amino acids in or flanking the CaM binding domain, we prepared an RyR2 quadruple mutant (RyR2–4M) by substituting 4 amino acids in RyR2 with the corresponding amino acids in RyR1 (in Fig. 1, substituted amino acids are indicated by the asterisk). RyR2–4M exhibited [35S]CaM binding (Fig. 2) and effects of CaM on single channel activities (Fig. 4) essentially identical to WT-RyR2. The results indicate that receptor sites other than the CaM binding domain are responsible for the differential regulation of the skeletal and cardiac RyRs by CaM.DISCUSSIONTwo experimental strategies were taken to identify the CaM binding site in RyR2, [35S]CaM binding measurements and single channel recordings using the planar lipid bilayer method. Deletion of amino acid residues 3583–3603 was sufficient to eliminate CaM binding and inhibition of RyR2 channel activity by CaM at submicromolar and micromolar Ca2+ concentrations. Mutagenesis generated four RyR2 single or double mutants in this region that eliminated or greatly reduced apoCaM binding with the double mutants also resulting in loss of or reduced CaCaM binding levels. Single channel recordings showed that at 0.4 μm Ca2+, RyR2-W3587A, -L3591D, and -F3603A bound CaM but were not inhibited by CaM concentrations as high as 1 μm. On the other hand, RyR2-W3587A/L3591D was inhibited by 50 nm CaM at 2 μm Ca2+ despite a low CaM binding level. Furthermore, an unexpected finding was that corresponding mutations in the CaM binding site affected the CaM binding properties and regulation by CaM of the skeletal and cardiac RyRs differently (Table I).Table I[35S]CaM binding and CaM regulation of WT and mutant RyR1s and RyR2sCaM BindingCaM Regulation<10 nM Ca2+0.4 μM Ca2+>1 μM Ca2+0.4 μM Ca2+>1 μM Ca2+WT-RyR1+++ND+++++++++RyR1-W3620A+++aData are from Ref. 15.N"

Using a cell-free system, we show here that, although Aβ40 and CTFγ 50–99 were the predominant species produced by membranes prepared from cells overexpressing wild-type (wt) APP and wt presenilin (PS) 1 or 2, the production of CTFγ 49–99, which begins at Leu-49, was remarkably enhanced in membranes from cells overexpressing mutant (mt) APP or mtPS1/2 that increases the production of Aβ42. Furthermore, a γ-secretase inhibitor, which suppresses Aβ40 production and paradoxically enhances Aβ42 production at low concentrations, caused the proportion of CTFγ 50–99 to decrease and that of CTFγ 49–99 to increase significantly.

One of the Aβ species, Aβ42, has a much higher aggregation potential (8Hilbich C. Kisters-Woike B. Reed J. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 149-163Google Scholar, 9Burdick D.

Neuron. 1994; 13: 45-53Google Scholar). It is reasonable to postulate that Aβ42 accumulation in the brain is the very initial event in the development of AD including sporadic AD. Indeed, all mutations of PS1/2 and some mutations of APP that cause familial AD result in increased Aβ42 production (11Sisodia S.S. St. George-Hyslop P.H. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 281-290Google Scholar). Recently, we and other groups found that APP is cleaved by PS-dependent γ-secretase, not only in the middle of the transmembrane domain (γ-cleavage) but also near the cytoplasmic membrane boundary (ϵ-cleavage) (12Gu Y. Misonou H. Sato T. Dohmae N. Takio K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35235-35238Google Scholar, 13Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C.

Reinhard F.B. Vogel M. Paliga K. Baier G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Evin G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2825-2835Google Scholar). The major product of the latter process is a CTFγ of APP that begins at Val-50. This cleavage site is a few residues inside the membrane from the cytoplasmic/membrane boundary and is similar to site 3 cleavage of Notch (16Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Google Scholar). Since production of CTFγ is inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of PS1 (17Wolfe M.S. Xia W. Ostaszewski B.L. Diehl T.S. Kimberly W.T. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 513-517Google Scholar), ϵ-cleavage is PS-dependent as well as γ-cleavage (13Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 835-841Google Scholar, 14Yu C. Kim S.H. Ikeuchi T. Xu H. Gasparini L. Wang R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43756-43760Google Scholar, 15Weidemann A. Eggert S. Reinhard F.B. Vogel M. Paliga K. Baier G. Masters C.L. Beyreuther K. Evin G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2825-2835Google Scholar). Furthermore, ϵ-cleavage is also inhibited with γ-secretase inhibitors, which are known to selectively bind to PS1/2 (12Gu Y. Misonou H. Sato T. Dohmae N. Takio K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35235-35238Google Scholar, 13Sastre M. Steiner H. Fuchs K. Capell A. Multhaup G. Condron M.M. Teplow D.B. Haass C. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 835-841Google Scholar, 14Yu C. Kim S.H.

Evin G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2825-2835Google Scholar). However, it has remained unknown how ϵ-cleavage relates to the generation of distinct Aβ species or whether this step is essential to generate Aβ. We therefore examined whether there is a link between CTFγ and Aβ production using a cell-free system. Taking advantage of familial AD mutations of APP and PS1/2 and a γ-secretase inhibitor, we show here that, when Aβ40 is predominantly produced, CTFγ 50–99 is the major product of ϵ-cleavage, and when a large amount of Aβ42 is produced, CTFγ 49–99 is predominantly produced. Thus, ϵ-cleavage may be linked to the specificity of γ-cleavage. APP- and PS1/2-overexpressing Cells—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with cDNA encoding wild-type (wt) APP751 (7WD10 cells) and mutant (mt) APP751 (V717F) were described previously (18Podlisny M.B. Ostaszewski B.L. Squazzo S.L. Koo E.H. Rydell R.E. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9564-9570Google Scholar). 7WD10 cells were further transfected with cDNA encoding wt, N141I, or D366A PS2 or wt, M146L, M233T, or G384A PS1 as described previously (19Qi Y. Morishima-Kawashima M. Sato T. Mitsumori R. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1042-1052Google Scholar). V717F cells were further transfected with cDNA encoding wt, M233T, or G384A PS1. Human embryonic kidney HEK293 cells were transfected with cDNA encoding wt, V717G, or V717F (according to APP770 numbering) APP695 (20Haass C. Schlossmacher M.G. Hung A.Y. Vigo-Pelfrey C. Mellon A. Ostaszewski B.L. Lieberburg I. Koo E.H. Schenk D. Teplow D.B. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 322-325Google Scholar). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Stably transfected CHO cells were further added with G418, zeocin, or puromycin (Invitrogen). Cell-free Assay and Inhibitor Treatment—Confluent cells were harvested and homogenized in homogenization buffer (20 mm Pipes, pH 7.0, 140 mm KCl, 0.25 m sucrose, and 5 mm EGTA). Homogenized cells were centrifuged at 800 × g to remove nuclei and cell debris. The supernatant was further ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The resultant pellet, total membrane fraction, was suspended in homogenization buffer. The membrane fraction at a protein concentration of 2.5 mg/ml in homogenization buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture was incubated at 37 °C for the indicated time, and the reaction was stopped by placing the reaction mixture on ice. After extraction of lipids twice with chloroform/methanol (2:1) and chloroform/methanol/water (1:2:0.8), the residue was extracted with 70% formic acid, and the extract was dried. The remaining proteins were dissolved with the SDS sample buffer containing 9 m urea and subjected to 16.5% SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting using antibodies BA27 (specific for Aβ40), BC05 (specific for Aβ42), 6E10 (raised against Aβ1–16, and appropriate for assessing total Aβ; Senetek PLC, Maryland Heights, MO), and C4 (raised against the 30 C-terminal residues of APP). Aβ40/42 and CTFγ were quantified by a LAS-1000plus luminescent image analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan) using defined amounts of authentic Aβ (Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland) as a standard. DFK-167 was purchased from Enzyme Systems Products (Livermore, CA) and dissolved in Me2SO. Mass Spectrometric and Amino Acid Sequence Analyses of CTFγ— Membrane fractions prepared from 80 dishes of cultured cells were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h to separate the soluble and membrane-bound CTFγ. The membrane-bound fraction was suspended and homogenized in 1% Triton X-100, which completely extracted CTFγ (data not shown). Solubilized CTFγ was immunoprecipitated once with 4G8 (epitope: Aβ17–24; Senetek PLC, Maryland Heights, MO) to remove the other C-terminal fragments of APP (CTFα and CTFβ), and then CTFγ was immunoprecipitated with C4, extracted with 70% formic acid, and dried by vacuum centrifugation. The partially purified samples were subjected to gel filtration on two tandemly arrayed TSK-gel Super SW2000 columns (Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan), which were developed with 6 m guanidine hydrochloride in 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 6.0). Pooled putative CTFγ fractions were further purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) on CAPCELL PAK Phenyl SG300 (Shiseido, Tokyo, Japan). The fractions corresponding to peaks 1 and 2 were subjected to an Applied Biosystems model 494 cLC or model 492 protein sequencer. Both CTFγ 50–99 and CTFγ 49–99 were quantified from the yields of Val-50 at the first and second cycles, respectively. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry on the Voyager Biospectrometry Workstation (Applied Biosystems). Immunoprecipitated CTFγ was extracted with 1% trifluoroacetic acid, 30% acetonitrile. Masses of the peptides were determined in a linear mode, using sinapinic acid as a matrix. For calibration, bovine insulin (Sigma) was used as an external standard. Production of Aβ42 and CTFγ 49–99 Is Increased in Membranes from CHO Cells Expressing mtAPP or mtPS2—To learn whether there is any relationship between Aβ40/42 and CTFγ, we used a cell-free Aβ or CTFγ production system consisting of membranes prepared from various stable transfectants. When membranes prepared from wtAPP-overexpressing or wtPS2-overexpressing cells were incubated, Aβ40 was a predominant species produced (Fig. 1A). In contrast, when the incubated membranes were from mtAPP (V717F) and mtPS2 (N141I) cells, the proportion of Aβ42 was increased specifically and predominantly (Fig. 1A). Besides Aβ40/42, the membranes also produced comparable amounts of CTFγ, a counterpart of Aβ (Fig. 1B). Membranes from the cells overexpressing a dominant negative mutant of PS2, D366A (21Kimberly W.T. Xia W. Rahmati T. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3173-3178Google Scholar), produced negligible amounts of Aβ40/42 and a trace amount of CTFγ (Fig. 1, A and B). This mutant accumulated large amounts of CTFα/β, the immediate substrates for γ-secretase (Fig. 1, A and B). Thus, this cell-free Aβ production system reflects the Aβ secretion profile observed in in vitro culture of each cell line (data not shown). Cell-free production of Aβ and CTFγ took very similar time courses, with both gradually declining after 10–20 min (19Qi Y. Morishima-Kawashima M. Sato T. Mitsumori R. Ihara Y. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 1042-1052Google Scholar) (data not shown). A specific γ-secretase inhibitor, DFK-167 (22Wolfe M.S. Citron M. Diehl T.S. Xia W. Donkor I.O. Selkoe D.J. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 6-9Google Scholar), suppressed Aβ40 production but paradoxically enhanced Aβ42 production at low concentrations in the membranes from wtPS2 cells, as previously reported (22Wolfe M.S. Citron M. Diehl T.S. Xia W. Donkor I.O. Selkoe D.J. J. Med. Chem. 1998; 41: 6-9Google Scholar, 23Zhang L. Song L. Terracina G. Liu Y. Pramanik B. Parker E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5049-5055Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, C and D). We wondered whether production of Aβ40 and Aβ42 is correlated with particular species of CTFγ. The generated CTFγ was separated into soluble and membrane-bound forms. A larger proportion of CTFγ was released into soluble fraction during incubation, and the remaining proportion of CTFγ was left membrane-bound (see Table I). As a first step to purification of CTFγ, highly efficient immunoprecipitation with C4 (see “Experimental Procedures”) was employed. CTFγ immunoprecipitated from the soluble and membrane-bound fractions was subjected to mass spectrometric analysis; several species of CTFγ were identified in each of the membranes (Fig. 1E), the results of which were consistent with our previous report (12Gu Y. Misonou H. Sato T. Dohmae N. Takio K. Ihara Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35235-35238Google Scholar). The largest peak in wtAPP and wtPS2 membranes represented CTFγ 50–99. Notably, whereas CTFγ 49–99 was a minor signal in wtAPP and wtPS2 membranes, it became a major signal in mtAPP (V717F) and mtPS2 (N141I) membranes. This raises the possibility that the extent of Aβ40 production is related to that of CTFγ 50–99 production, and that of Aβ42 production is related to that of CTFγ 49–99 production.Table IQuantification of soluble and membrane-bound CTFγ 49–99 and 50–99Cell LinesMolecular speciesYieldProportionsSolubleMembrane-boundTotalSolubleMembrane-boundTotalpmol%%%wtAPPCTFγ 50-994.402.366.7770.4 ± 4.374.971.3CTFγ 49-992.190.692.8929.6 ± 4.325.128.7mtAPP (V717F)CTFγ 50-991.131.552.6821.9 ± 4.134.827.8CTFγ 49-994.452.917.3678.1 ± 4.165.272.2wtPS2CTFγ 50-998.781.209.9881.5 ± 3.772.380.7CTFγ 49-991.470.391.8618.5 ± 3.727.719.3wtPS2 + DFK-167CTFγ 50-994.291.235.52*74.8 ± 0.972.874.6CTFγ 49-991.370.481.85*25.2 ± 0.927.225.4mtPS2 (N141I)CTFγ 50-992.101.033.1343.0 ± 2.864.849.7CTFγ 49-992.480.533.0157.0 ± 2.835.250.3 Open table in a new tab Production of Aβ42 and CTFγ 49–99 Is Increased in Membranes from CHO Cells Expressing mtPS1—To further confirm such increased production of CTFγ 49–99, we examined membrane fractions prepared from wt or mtPS1 (M146L, M233T, and G384A)-overexpressing cells. By incubation for 20 min, wtPS1 membranes produced Aβ40 predominantly, a situation that is similar to that of wtAPP and wtPS2 membranes (Fig. 2, A and B). On the other hand, mtPS1 membranes produced larger amounts of Aβ42, although the ratios of Aβ42 to Aβ40 differed among mutations (Fig. 2A). Concomitantly produced CTFγ was immunoprecipitated and subjected to mass spectrometric analysis (Fig. 2C). In the wtPS1 membranes, the largest signal was CTFγ 50–99. In contrast, in the mtPS1 membranes, the peaks for CTFγ 49–99 were found to be significantly larger. In M233T and G384A membranes in which Aβ42 was produced predominantly (Fig. 2A), the peaks for CTFγ 49–99 were much higher (Fig. 2C). In contrast, in M146L membranes, the peak for CTFγ 49–99 was almost at the same level as that in wtPS1 (Fig. 2C), and the Aβ42 production was only slightly increased (Fig. 2A). Membranes from HEK293 Cells Expressing mt APP Show an Increased Production of Aβ42 and CTFγ 49–99 —To determine whether these differences were due to an idiosyncrasy of CHO cells, we examined the membrane fractions from wt, V717G, and V717F APP-overexpressing HEK293 cells. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, whereas Aβ40 was predominantly produced in the membranes from wtAPP-overexpressing cells, the proportion of Aβ42 production was significantly increased in membranes from V717G and V717F APP-overexpressing cells. The CTFγ immunoprecipitated from membranes of HEK293 cells was similarly analyzed by mass spectrometry. The major species was CTFγ 50–99 in the membrane of wtAPP-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3C). On the other hand, the major peaks in the membranes from V717G- and V717F-overexpressing HEK293 cells were CTFγ 49–99, which is similar to mtAPP-expressing CHO cells (see Fig. 1E). Interestingly, all cell lines of HEK293 cells appeared to produce significantly larger amounts of CTFγ 52–99 as compared with CHO cells, an observation that agrees with previous reports (14Yu C. Kim S.H. Ikeuchi T. Xu H. Gasparini L. Wang R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43756-43760Google Scholar, 24Chen F. Gu Y. Hasegawa H. Ruan X. Arawaka S. Fraser P. Westaway D. Mount H. St. George-Hyslop P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36521-36526Google Scholar). From these results, it is likely that, although ϵ-cleavage may show some variability among cell lines, CTFγ 50–99 is a predominant species in wtAPP and wtPS1/2 membranes in which Aβ40 was predominantly produced, and CTFγ 49–99 production is increased in mtAPP and mtPS1/2 membranes, in which Aβ42 production was increased. Quantification of CTFγ Species Using an Amino Acid Sequencer—Peak heights for several CTFγ species on mass spectrometric profiles may not be quantitative. Thus, we sought to quantify precisely each molecular species of CTFγ produced using an amino acid sequencer. The CTFγ species produced in membranes from four cell lines as shown in Fig. 1 were carefully analyzed. C4-immunoprecipitated CTFγ was fractionated by gel filtration, followed by RP-HPLC (Fig. 4A). The fractions corresponding to peaks 1 and 2 (see Fig. 4A) were subjected to amino acid sequence analysis. Five species of CTFγ were identified (see Fig. 1E); peak 1 contained four molecular species (CTFγ 52–99, 51–99, and 50–99 and a trace amount of 49–99), whereas peak 2 contained two molecular species (CTFγ 49–99 and 48–99). Among them, CTFγ 50–99 and 49–99 accounted for >90% of CTFγ in each cell line, and the remaining species (CTFγ 52–99, 51–99, and 48–99) were at detectable but negligible levels. Other species (e.g. CTFγ 53–99, 54–99, etc.) were undetectable by sequence analysis. The accurate proportion of CTFγ 49–99/50–99 for each cell line is provided in Table I. The proportions of CTFγ 49–99 were 28.7 and 19.3% for wtAPP and wtPS2 membranes, respectively (Table I and Fig. 4B). Both membranes produced Aβ40 predominantly (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the proportions of CTFγ 49–99 were increased to 72.2 and 50.3% for the membranes of mtAPP (V717F) and mtPS2 (N141I) cells, respectively, both of which produced increased amounts of Aβ42 (Fig. 1A). These data were consistent with the results of mass spectrometric analysis, indicating that the evaluation by mass spectrometry is very informative in the present study. Proportion of CTFγ 50–99 Is Decreased at a Low Concentration of DFK-167—To further verify that the increase in the proportion of CTFγ 49–99 is independent of the cell type, we next examined the effect of DFK-167, an inhibitor that at low concentrations specifically inhibited the production of Aβ40 and paradoxically increased Aβ42 production (Fig. 1D), on the proportion of CTFγ species produced by the membranes (Table I). The proportions of CTFγ 50–99 and CTFγ 49–99 in the soluble fraction of 10 μm inhibitor-treated wtPS2 membrane were significantly (p < 0.05) changed to 74.8 ± 0.9% from 81.5 ± 3.7% and to 25.2 ± 0.9% from 18.5 ± 3.7%, respectively, concomitantly with the proportion of Aβ40 produced decreasing to ∼60% from more than 80% and Aβ42 produced increasing to ∼40% from less than 20% (Figs. 1D and 4B). These results strongly suggest that Aβ40 and Aβ42 production is related to that of CTFγ 50–99 and CTFγ 49–99, respectively (Fig. 4C). Additive Effects of mtAPP and mtPS1 on Aβ and CTFγ Species—An increase in CTFγ 49–99 production accompanying a decrease in CTFγ 50–99 production was observed in mtAPP-, mtPS1-, and mtPS2-overexpressing cells. To examine whether the combination of mtAPP and mtPS1 has an additional effect on the produced CTFγ species, we established stable transfectants co-expressing mtAPP (V717F; hereafter VF) and wt or mtPS1 (M233T or G384A). The ratio of Aβ40/42 produced in wtPS1 membranes (VF/wtPS1) was almost the same as that observed in V717F-only membranes (Fig. 5, A and B). On the other hand, the proportion of Aβ42 production was significantly increased in mtPS1 membranes (VF/M233T and VF/G384A) as compared with VF/wtPS1. This additive effect of mtAPP and mtPS1 on Aβ42 production was consistent with the previous report (25Citron M. Eckman C.B. Diehl T.S. Corcoran C. Ostaszewski B.L. Xia W. Levesque G. St. George Hyslop P. Younkin S.G. Selkoe D.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 1998; 5: 107-116Google Scholar). Interestingly, the membranes from VF/G384A cells produced much smaller amounts of Aβ and CTFγ and accumulated CTFα/β (Fig. 5, A and B). It is possible that this mtPS1-associated γ-secretase has a lower affinity and/or inefficient cleavage for V717F substrate. We next analyzed CTFγ species produced in these membranes by mass spectrometry. The major species was CTFγ 49–99 in the VF/wtPS1 membranes, similarly to V717F membranes (Fig. 5C). On the other hand, the peaks for CTFγ 50–99 were found to be smaller in both VF/M233T and VF/G384A membranes. In these membranes, the peaks of CTFγ 50–99 were also remarkably smaller as compared with mtPS1-only membranes (Figs. 2C and 5C). Because mass spectrometric analyses are not so quantitative, we could not accurately assess whether or how much CTFγ 49–99 in these membranes was increased as compared with that in VF/wt-PS1 membrane. However, these results strongly suggest that mtAPP and mtPS1 have an additive effect on CTFγ species produced. It has long been claimed that mutations of APP clustered close to the C terminus of Aβ alter the cleavage specificity of γ-secretase, leading to increased Aβ42 production. Accordingly, we thought that such APP mutations would preferentially affect γ-cleavage without substantial effects on ϵ-cleavage that occurs near the cytoplasmic membrane boundary. However, most unexpectedly, as shown in Figs. 1E and 3C, mtAPP (V717F) had a remarkable effect on the ϵ-cleavage and generated a large amount of CTFγ 49–99 (e.g. 72.2%). This large increase in the production of long CTFγ was far more than increased proportion of Aβ42 produced (e.g. 39.5 ± 0.98% for V717F in CHO cells) (Fig. 1A). As is the case, the extent of Aβ42 production is not proportionate to the extent of long CTFγ production. For example, mtPS2 (N141I) generated Aβ42 predominantly (81.6 ± 2.1%), whereas the proportion of CTFγ 49–99 was 50.3%, and similar results can be seen among other mutations of PS1 (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the presence of 10 μm DFK-167 increased production of Aβ42 by about 2-fold, an extent more than that of CTFγ 49–99 (∼1.3-fold). Thus, the proportion of Aβ40 and Aβ42 does not faithfully reflect that of CTFγ 50–99 and 49–99. In contrast to CHO cells, HEK293 cell membranes produced a significant amount of another CTFγ, CTFγ 52–99 (Fig. 3C). Moreover, CTFγ 52–99 was significantly increased in mtAPP membranes. Even in CHO cells, CTFγ 52–99 appears to be very slightly increased in the membranes from mtAPP and mtPS1/2 cells (Figs. 1E, 2C, and 5C). Thus, the production of CTFγ 52–99 may also be related to that of Aβ42, although further study is required to confirm this view. A number of recent reports have argued for a reciprocal relationship between γ-cleavage and Notch site 3 cleavage. Several PS1 mutations that increase the production of Aβ42 were found to reduce Notch site 3 cleavage (24Chen F. Gu Y. Hasegawa H. Ruan X. Arawaka S. Fraser P. Westaway D. Mount H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 36521-36526Google Scholar, 29Moehlmann T. Winkler E. Xia X. Edbauer D. Murrell J. Capell A. Kaether C. Zheng H. Ghetti B. Haass C. Steiner H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These results are consistent with the present quantitative data based on sequencing, showing that the total amounts of CTFγ produced in the mtPS2 membranes are reduced to ∼50% of those of wtPS2 membranes (Table I). Thus, mtPS1/2 causes not only a reduction in the extent of ϵ-cleavage but also an alteration in the proportion of CTFγ species (i.e. an increase of long CTFγ). This contrasts with mtAPP, which does not affect the extent of ϵ-cleavage (24Chen F. Gu Y. Hasegawa H. Ruan X. Arawaka S. Fraser P. Westaway D. Mount H. St. George-Hyslop P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 36521-36526Google Scholar) but produces an unexpectedly large amount of CTFγ 49–99 (Fig. 1E, 3C, and 4C). It is therefore reasonable to speculate that this particular characteristic underlies the mechanisms for increased Aβ42 production by each mtAPP and mtPS1/2 membranes. The differing characteristics of mtPS1/2 and mtAPP might further complicate the relationship between γ- and ϵ-cleavage. Thus far identified substrates of γ-secretase are cleaved at or near the cytoplasmic membrane boundary, and some are also in the middle of the transmembrane domain (16Schroeter E.H. Kisslinger J.A. Kopan R. Nature. 1998; 393: 382-386Google Scholar, 30Okamoto I. Kawano Y. Murakami D. Sasayama T. Araki N. Miki T. Wong A.J. Saya H. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 755-762Google Scholar, 31Marambaud P. Shioi J. Serban G. Georgakopoulos A. Sarner S. Nagy V. Baki L. Wen P. Efthimiopoulos S. Shao Z. Wisniewski T. Robakis N.K. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1948-1956Google Scholar, 32Lammich S. Okochi M. Takeda M. Kaether C. Capell A. Zimmer A.K. Edbauer D. Walter J. Steiner H. Haass C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44754-44759Google Scholar, 33Okochi M. Steiner H. Fukumori A. Tanii H. Tomita T. Tanaka T. Iwatsubo T. Kudo T. Takeda M. Haass C. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5408-5416Google Scholar). This suggests that γ-cleavage and ϵ-cleavage are universal phenomena in a particular subset of type I membrane proteins. Further, a potential link between Aβ42 and CTFγ 49–99 raises further questions. Which cleavage, γ- or ϵ-cleavage, comes first, and how does one cleavage affect the other? We failed to detect a particular CTFγ longer than CTFγ 48–99 by either mass spectrometric analysis or sequencing. One possible interpretation is that CTFβ is first cleaved at the ϵ-site, and thus cleaved products (Aβ 1–48 and 1–49) undergo γ-cleavage, and Aβ40/42 are secreted. Previous studies reported the existence of long Aβ 1–46 by mass spectrometric analysis (34Kuo Y.M. Kokjohn T.A. Watson M.D. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Sue L.I. Kalback W.M. Emmerling M.R. Beach T.G.

However, in our hands, longer Aβ species were undetectable, although we cannot rule out the possibility that the steady-state levels of such intermediates in the lysates are below the detection limit. It is also possible that γ- and ϵ-cleavage occur simultaneously or nearly so along the CTFβ molecule, leaving a small hydrophobic membrane peptide that must be difficult to isolate and detect. Development of specific inhibitors for γ- or ϵ-cleavage might help us to identify a particular intermediate(s) and then lead us to a better understanding of the relationship between two kinds of cleavage."
https://openalex.org/W2065349942,"To better understand the role of disrupted transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) signaling in fibrosis, we have selectively expressed a kinase-deficient human type II TGFβ receptor (TβRIIΔk) in fibroblasts of transgenic mice, using a lineage-specific expression cassette subcloned from the pro-α2(I) collagen gene. Surprisingly, despite previous studies that characterized TβRIIΔk as a dominant negative inhibitor of TGFβ signaling, adult mice expressing this construct demonstrated TGFβ overactivity and developed dermal and pulmonary fibrosis. Compared with wild type cells, transgenic fibroblasts proliferated more rapidly, produced more extracellular matrix, and showed increased expression of key markers of TGFβ activation, including plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, connective tissue growth factor, Smad3, Smad4, and Smad7. Smad2/3 phosphorylation was increased in transgenic fibroblasts. Overall, the gene expression profile of explanted transgenic fibroblasts using cDNA microarrays was very similar to that of littermate wild type cells treated with recombinant TGFβ1. Despite basal up-regulation of TGFβ signaling pathways, transgenic fibroblasts were relatively refractory to further stimulation with TGFβ1. Thus, responsiveness of endogenous genes to TGFβ was reduced, and TGFβ-regulated promoter-reporter constructs transiently transfected into transgenic fibroblasts showed little activation by recombinant TGFβ1. Responsiveness was partially restored by overexpression of wild type type II TGFβ receptors. Activation of MAPK pathways by recombinant TGFβ1 appeared to be less perturbed than Smad-dependent signaling. Our results show that expression of TβRIIΔk selectively in fibroblasts leads to paradoxical ligand-dependent activation of downstream signaling pathways and causes skin and lung fibrosis. As well as confirming the potential for nonsignaling receptors to regulate TGFβ activity, these findings support a direct role for perturbed TGFβ signaling in fibrosis and provide a novel genetically determined animal model of fibrotic disease.

Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) 1The abbreviations used are: TGFβ, transforming growth factor β; TβRI and TβRII, TGFβ type I and II high affinity receptor, respectively; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; CMV, cytomegalovirus; RT, reverse transcriptase; SSc, systemic sclerosis; 3TP, trimeric TGFβ response element of the PAI-1 promoter; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. isoforms β1–β3 are important regulators of embryonic and postnatal cell differentiation and proliferation. They are also potent profibrotic factors in vitro. Transgenic and gene-targeted mutant mice have proven valuable for investigating the important roles of the TGFβ family in growth and development. For example, mice lacking TGFβ1 show substantial embryonic lethality, and those that are born develop a fatal disseminated inflammatory illness within the first postnatal month. Conversely, mice lacking TGFβ2 all die neonatally with defective epithelial-mesenchymal interaction, whereas mice lacking TGFβ3 show a perinatal lethal phenotype with cleft palate (1Bottinger E.P. Letterio J.J. Roberts A.B. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1355-1360Google Scholar). These different knock-out phenotypes suggest somewhat distinct biological functions in vivo, although all three TGFβ isoforms signal though the same specific receptor complex, so differential effects are likely to reflect patterns of ligand expression or the influence of accessory receptors at the cell surface. Ligand engagement by the type II high affinity receptor (TβRII) appears to be a major limiting step in cellular activation, and mice lacking this receptor die early in embryonic development from abnormal yolk sac vascularization (2Oshima M. Oshima H. Taketo M.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 179: 297-302Google Scholar). There is tight regulation of extracellular TGFβ ligand bio-availability, dependent upon its release from preformed large latent complexes in which TGFβ is noncovalently associated with its propeptide fragment, latency-associated peptide and covalently linked to one of several latent TGFβ-binding proteins (3Annes J.P. Munger J.S. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 217-224Google Scholar). Release of active ligand from the large latent complex occurs through chemical, thermal, or proteolytic activity. In vivo thrombospondin-1 and a number of matrix metalloproteinases determine stability of the large latent complex, and interestingly thrombospondin-1 null mice develop a phenotype reminiscent of TGFβ1 null animals, suggesting that extracellular cleavage of latent TGFβ complexes may be a key mechanism regulating ligand activity (4Crawford S.E. Stellmach V. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Ribeiro S.M. Lawler J. Hynes R.O. Boivin G.P. Bouck N. Cell. 1998; 93: 1159-1170Google Scholar). A number of accessory proteins facilitate binding of TGFβ ligand to its high affinity receptors. Of these accessory receptors, betaglycan is widely expressed, whereas endoglin has a restricted pattern of expression, being present predominantly on endothelial cells. Downstream signaling pathways activated by TGFβ are becoming increasingly well delineated. At the cell surface, ligand engagement by TβRII allows phosphorylation of serine residues within the type I receptor (TβRI). This activates receptor kinase activity, leading to a series of downstream events. Much interest has focused on defining the role of the Smad family of proteins in TGFβ signaling (3Annes J.P. Munger J.S. Rifkin D.B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 217-224Google Scholar), showing that the activated kinase of TβRI phosphorylates Smad3, which then associates with Smad4 to form complexes that determine many of the effects of TGFβ on transcriptional activation. However, it is now appreciated that Smad-independent signaling also occurs (5Hocevar B.A. Brown T.L. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1345-1356Google Scholar). Thus, other downstream pathways including members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family can also be activated by TGFβ (6Ravanti L. Hakkinen L. Larjava H. Saarialho-Kere U. Foschi M. Han J. Kahari V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 27: 37292-37300Google Scholar), and these may control levels of transcriptional coactivators or other transcription factors that interact with Smad proteins to determine the diverse effects of TGFβ on target cells (7Rosado E. Schwartz Z. Sylvia V.L. Dean D.D. Boyan B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1590: 1-15Google Scholar). Although there is considerable evidence that expression or function of TGFβ isoforms is altered in fibrotic disease, supported by its potent profibrotic activity in tissue culture, there have been relatively few studies directly examining the consequences of sustained disruption of TGFβ signaling in vivo. This is in part due to confounding effects of TGFβ on nonfibroblastic cells. Recently a potent fibroblast-specific transcriptional enhancer has been delineated within the far upstream region of the mouse pro-α2(I) collagen gene (8Bou-Gharios G. Garrett L.A. Rossert J. Niederreither K. Eberspaecher H. Smith C. Black C. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1333-1344Google Scholar). In previous work, we have shown that expression of reporter transgenes linked to this enhancer recapitulate expression of type I collagen in fibroblasts, but not other cell types, during embryonic development and postnatally (9Denton C.P. Zheng B. Shi-wen X. Bou-Gharios G. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. Black C.M. de Crombrugghe B. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 712-722Google Scholar). This enhancer therefore provides a unique tool by which genetic perturbation can be targeted specifically to fibroblasts. In the present study, we have used this enhancer to selectively express a kinase-deficient mutant type II TGFβ receptor (TβRIIΔk). This construct encodes the extracellular and transmembrane portion of the human TβRII. It may therefore engage free TGFβ ligand but cannot directly lead to phosphorylation of TβRI to initiate downstream signaling (10Weis-Garcia F. Massague J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 276-289Google Scholar). Such a truncated receptor has previously been characterized as a competitive antagonist for TGFβ1 and, when expressed at high levels in vitro, operates as a dominant negative inhibitor of TGFβ activity (11Brandt T. MacLellan W.R. Schneider M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11500-11503Google Scholar). We predicted that fibroblast-specific expression of TβRIIΔk would selectively disrupt TGFβ signaling in these cells without affecting other type I collagen-producing cells or nonmesenchymal lineages. As expected, fibroblasts cultured from mice expressing the mutant receptor were refractory to exogenous TGFβ1, but surprisingly they also demonstrated a constitutive biochemical phenotype reminiscent of TGFβ1 activation, and adult transgenic mice developed dermal and pulmonary fibrosis. As well as providing insight into the potential regulatory effects of nonsignaling TGFβ receptors and the long term effect of sustained TGFβ overactivity in vivo, these transgenic mice provide a novel genetically determined model for fibrotic disease. Generation of Transgenic Mice—The cDNA encoding a truncated TβRII protein comprising amino acids 24–184 of human TβRII, including extracellular and transmembrane domains and a few residues of the cytoplasmic portion of the receptor, was used in this study (10Weis-Garcia F. Massague J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 276-289Google Scholar). The coding sequence was excised from its source plasmid (pSV-TβRIIΔk) using HindIII and XbaI and subcloned into pBluescript KS+/–. This was excised using HindIII and EcoRV, treated with Klenow fragment, and cloned into the expression vector pCD3 at a blunted SalI site. The expression vector pCD3 includes a 6-kb upstream fragment of the mouse pro-α2(I) collagen (Col1a2) gene, between –19.5 and –13.5 kb upstream of the transcription start site, linked to a minimal Col1a2 promoter (–350 to +35 bp). This enhancer-promoter cassette has previously been shown to strongly direct expression of reporter transgenes to fibroblasts in embryonic development and postnatally (8Bou-Gharios G. Garrett L.A. Rossert J. Niederreither K. Eberspaecher H. Smith C. Black C. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1333-1344Google Scholar, 9Denton C.P. Zheng B. Shi-wen X. Bou-Gharios G. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. Black C.M. de Crombrugghe B. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 712-722Google Scholar). The vector also includes the intron and polyadenylation signal from the murine protamine-1 gene (12Schmidt A. Rossi P. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 347-354Google Scholar, 13Mercer E.H. Hoyle G.W. Kapur R.P. Brinster R.L. Palmiter R.D. Neuron. 1991; 7: 703-716Google Scholar). An internal ribosome entry site from the encephalomyocarditis virus was subcloned at the 5′-end of the Escherichia coli β-galactosidase (LacZ) gene, having been excised as an NcoI-ClaI fragment from the internal ribosome entry site-LacZ-containing plasmid pWH8 (14Kim D.G. Kang H.M. Jang S.K. Shin H.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3636-3643Google Scholar). This was introduced into the pRM-6kb-LacZ plasmid (9Denton C.P. Zheng B. Shi-wen X. Bou-Gharios G. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. Black C.M. de Crombrugghe B. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 712-722Google Scholar) using directional cloning between the same restriction sites. The final transgene construct is shown in Fig. 1A. Transgenic mice were generated according to standard methods. In brief, the transgene construct was linearized by digestion with SacII, and the backbone bacterial sequence was removed using NruI. The fragment was gel-purified and electroeluted prior to ultracentrifugation (60 min at 4 °C). After dilution to 2 ng/ml final concentration in microinjection buffer (15.Hogan, B., Costantini, F., and Lacy, E. (1980) Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual, pp. 497–500, Cold Spring Harbor, NYGoogle Scholar), the DNA solution was microinjected into fertilized B6D2 F2 oocytes. These were transferred into CD1 foster mothers and examined at embryonic day 15.5 or allowed to reach full term for examination of postnatal time points. Progeny were backcrossed with wild type mice to establish lines. Mice were genotyped by PCR of genomic DNA extracted from tail biopsies of neonatal pups or from placentas of founder embryos, using primers specific for the β-galactosidase reporter gene (16Labarca C. Paigen K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 344-352Google Scholar) (5′-CGGATAAACGGAACTGGAAA-3′ and 5′-TAATCACGACTCGCTGTATC-3′) to yield a 500-bp product. Amplification was undertaken by 35 cycles of 60 s of annealing at 58 °C, 2.6 mm Mg2+, and 60 s of extension at 72 °C. Later, transgene expression was determined in whole mount embryos using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) staining for β-galactosidase activity (see below). Co-expression of this marker gene provided a simple method for confirming that genotypically transgenic animals expressed the transgene and also facilitated later histological and biochemical analysis of derived transgenic mouse lines. Expression of the β-galactosidase marker was also measured by biochemical assay. Fresh tissue samples were homogenized for 90 s and centrifuged at 3000 × g for 5 min, and β-galactosidase activity in the tissue extract or in lysed tissue culture cells was measured by GalactoLight™ chemiluminescence assay, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA). In brief, 20 μl of extract supernatant was added to 100 μl of reaction buffer/Galacton™ substrate mixture, and luminescence was measured after a 30-min incubation. Wild type tissue extract was included in each assay to control for background β-galactosidase activity. Biopsy wet weight or DNA content of the tissue extract was used for standardization of raw data. DNA concentration was measured by fluorometry using the Hoechst 3358 fluorochrome in a dedicated filter fluorometer (16Labarca C. Paigen K. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 102: 344-352Google Scholar) (Hoefer TKO 100; Amersham Biosciences). Histological Analysis—For histological analysis, 6 × 6-mm samples of adult mouse tissues or whole mount embryos (embryonic day 15.5) were processed for X-gal staining. Briefly, after fixation for 60 min (0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.3, 5 mm EGTA (pH 8.0), 2 mm magnesium chloride, 0.2% glutaraldehyde, 0.3% formaldehyde), samples were rinsed for 90 min and stained with X-gal staining solution (1 mg/ml) at room temperature, as described previously. Tissue was processed through increasing concentrations of ethanol and stored in 80% ethanol at –20 °C. Tissues were dehydrated and paraffin wax-embedded, and 7-μm sections were cut and counterstained with eosin. For detailed histological assessment of transgenic tissues, hematoxylin and eosin staining of paraffin-embedded tissues was undertaken. Masson's trichrome and Van Giesen elastin staining was performed to further assess extracellular matrix deposition. Analysis of Skin Collagen Content—Noncross-linked fibrillar collagen content of biopsy specimens was determined using the Sircol™ colorimetric assay (Biocolor, Belfast, UK). Punch skin biopsies (6 mm) were obtained from shaved areas of skin from the lower back of age- and sex-matched transgenic (n = 7) or nontransgenic (n = 7) littermates, and time points of 6, 14, and 24 weeks were examined. Biopsies were finely chopped and homogenized in 0.5 m acetic acid with 1:20 (w/w) pepsin overnight at 4 °C. The samples were centrifuged, and 100 μl of supernatant was analyzed using the Sircol™ dye reagent. Dye-collagen complexes were resolubilized and assayed using a microplate reader at 540 nm. Standard curves were used to determine exact collagen content per biopsy. This assay measures the noncross-linked collagen content and has been shown to reflect recently synthesized collagen in fresh tissue samples (17Kuznetsova N. Leikin S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36083-36088Google Scholar) and closely correlate with hydroxyproline content (18Li Y.Y. Feng Y.Q. Kadokami T. McTiernan C.F. Draviam R. Watkins S.C. Feldman A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 12746-12751Google Scholar). Data were expressed as mean collagen content per biopsy corrected for DNA content as described above. Fibroblast Culture—Fibroblast cultures were derived from skin biopsies from lower back of neonatal transgenic or control littermate mice. Cells were cultured in the presence of antibiotics and passaged at confluence. Transgene expression levels were routinely measured by biochemical assay of β-galactosidase activity. Proliferation of dermal fibroblasts cultured from transgenic mice or from nontransgenic littermates was compared by direct cell counting. Following 24 h of culture in low serum (0.5% fetal calf serum) medium, 104 cells were seeded into each well of replicate six-well tissue culture plates. At 24-h intervals, the cell layer was recovered and resuspended. Cell number was assessed by direct counting in duplicate samples for a series of cultures (n = 4) derived from two different transgenic or wild type littermates. Data from these experiments were combined for comparison of growth rates. Flow Cytometric Analysis of TGFβ Receptor Expression—Expression of cell surface TGFβ receptors was analyzed and quantified by flow cytometry. Confluent cultures of neonatal fibroblasts were detached using Ca2+/Mg2+-free EDTA (10 mm) for 10 min at 4 °C, and single cell suspensions were incubated with the primary antibodies at 10 μg/ml for 60 min at 4 °C, followed by a species-specific fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibody for 30 min at 4 °C. Cells were then washed and fixed in freshly prepared 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS. An isotype-matched irrelevant primary monoclonal antibody was used as a control for nonspecific binding. Fluorescence intensities of stained cells were measured by FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson, Twickenham, UK), analyzing data from 104 cells after gating on the basis of their size and granularity. Biotinylated antibodies specific for murine type I and type II TGFβ receptors (R & D Systems Ltd., Oxford, UK) were used to measure endogenous receptor expression. The transgene product was detected using a directly fluorescein-conjugated mouse monoclonal antibody specific for the extracellular portion of the human TβRII (R&D Systems), showing less than 10% cross-reactivity with the mouse receptor. Total TGFβ1 binding was assessed by the Fluorokine™ kit (R&D Systems), using a biotinylated TGFβ1 conjugate in place of a primary antibody. Analysis of Gene Expression—For the TGFβ-regulated gene plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), fluorescent real time PCR (Taqman) was used to confirm basal and TGFβ1-induced differences in gene expression. These experiments demonstrated constitutive overexpression and refractoriness to further activation by recombinant TGFβ1, and this was confirmed by Western blot experiments and using cDNA microarrays. Initial time course experiments suggested that more comprehensive analysis of gene expression a 12-h time point would be informative. For this, total mRNA was prepared from confluent cultures of early passage neonatal dermal fibroblasts using the Triazol™ RNA extraction kit, following the manufacturer's protocol. Constitutive patterns of gene expression for transgenic fibroblasts or cells cultured from wild type littermates were compared with gene expression following incubation with TGFβ1 ligand (4–10 ng/ml final concentration). Expression analysis was performed using Clontech Atlas Mouse 1.2 arrays, incorporating oligonucleotides specific for 1176 mouse gene transcripts. Hybridization was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, after DNase I treatment of the total RNA, 5 μg of each paired sample (TGFβ1-treated or -untreated, or transgenic and nontransgenic) was incubated with the sequence-specific primer mix and reverse transcriptase. The resulting cDNA probes were labeled by incorporation of [α-32P]dATP and simultaneously hybridized to the microarrays. After hybridization, membranes were washed, and radioactivity determined by a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Differential gene expression was assessed using the Clontech Atlas-Image™ software. After alignment of individual gene spots on the microarray image file, differentially expressed genes were identified by normalization for global gene expression. Relative and absolute differences in gene expression profiles were compared. Significant differential expression was defined by at least a 2-fold consistent difference between samples (19Young R.A. Cell. 2000; 102: 9-15Google Scholar, 20Kaminski N. Allard J.D. Pittet J.F. Zuo F. Griffiths M.J. Morris D. Huang X. Sheppard D. Heller R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1778-1783Google Scholar). To determine constitutive differences in gene expression, basal expression patterns were compared for wild type or transgenic cells. The pattern of TGFβ1-modulated gene expression in wild type fibroblasts was compared with constitutive differences in gene expression for transgenic and wild type cells. Correlation analysis was performed to compare differences in gene expression and statistical significance determined by Student's t test using the SPSS™ statistical program. Western Blot Analysis—To examine biochemical or functional differences between transgenic or wild type fibroblast cultures and compare responsiveness to recombinant TGFβ1 ligand, a series of Western blot experiments were performed. Gene products that are known to be TGFβ-regulated were initially examined in time course experiments. Additional protein targets were selected based on cDNA microarray data. Cell layer lysates and tissue culture supernatants were examined from independent strains derived from transgenic or nontransgenic littermates (n = 4). To determine TGFβ1 responsiveness, parallel cultures were treated for 12 h with recombinant TGFβ1 as outlined above. Supernatants were concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation to selectively enrich samples for secreted matrix proteins. After SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, proteins were electroblotted onto nylon membranes and probed with specific antibodies. These were localized by chemiluminescence using a specific secondary antibody. For supernatants, specific antibodies to collagen type I (Southern Biotechnology Inc., Birmingham, AL), fibronectin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and keratinocyte growth factor (FGF7) (R&D Systems) were used. Cell layer lysates were probed using antibodies directed against Smad3, phospho-Smad2/3, Smad4, Smad7, vimentin (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF; antibody supplied by FibroGen Inc.). Total and phosphorylated p38MAPK and ERK1/2 were detected by specific antibodies following activation of fibroblast monolayers using recombinant TGFβ1 at time points between 15 min and 24 h. We hypothesized that basal differences in gene and protein expression might be dependent upon extracellular TGFβ and tested this using a soluble TβRII fusion protein that incorporates two ligand binding domains from the rabbit type II TGFβ receptor linked by the Fc portion of rabbit IgG. By binding active but not latent TGFβ, this has been shown to be a powerful potent and highly selective competitive antagonist (21Smith J.D. Bryant S.R. Couper L.L. Vary C.P. Gotwals P.J. Koteliansky V.E. Lindner V. Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 1212-1222Google Scholar). Initial studies confirmed that a concentration of 5 μg/ml completely blocked promotion of type I collagen synthesis by recombinant TGFβ1 (4–10 ng/ml) in normal fibroblasts, and this concentration was tested on transgenic cells. Transient Transfection Assays of Gene Activation—To assess TGFβ1 responsiveness, a series of TGFβ-regulated promoter-reporter constructs were introduced into transgenic or wild type cells by transient transfection, and the effect of recombinant TGFβ1 on reporter gene expression was determined. Constructs used for these experiments have been previously described, including PAI-1 (22Abe M. Harpel J.G. Metz C.N. Nunes I. Loskutoff D.J. Rifkin D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 276-284Google Scholar), Col1a2 (12Schmidt A. Rossi P. de Crombrugghe B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 347-354Google Scholar), fibronectin (5Hocevar B.A. Brown T.L. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1345-1356Google Scholar), and a trimeric sequence delineated as the TGFβ response element of the PAI-1 promoter, designated 3TP (23Chipuk J.E. Cornelius S.C. Pultz N.J. Jorgensen J.S. Bonham M.J. Kim S.J. Danielpour D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1240-1248Google Scholar). All were linked to a firefly luciferase reporter, and plasmids were transfected into neonatal fibroblasts using LipofectAMINE Plus™ (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Assessment of luciferase activity was by a dual luciferase reporter gene system (Promega Corp., Madison, WI) with a 1:100 test plasmid/control pTK-Renilla luciferase ratio. For experiments, 70% confluent fibroblast monolayers were used in 24-well tissue culture plates. After 12 h, serum-supplemented medium was added to each well, and 12 h later TGFβ1 was added. Initial experiments used concentrations between 1 and 100 ng/ml and time points of 6–24 h for wild type neonatal mouse fibroblasts and determined that treatment of cells at between 4 and 10 ng/ml for 16 h gave consistent responses of the firefly luciferase gene expression after correction for transfection efficiency. To examine whether overexpression of wild type high affinity TGFβ receptors might influence ligand responsiveness or basal properties of wild type or transgenic fibroblasts, cDNAs encoding full-length type I and type II receptors regulated by a CMV promoter were cotransfected with reporter constructs into wild type or transgenic littermate fibroblasts (see Ref. 9Denton C.P.

Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 712-722Google Scholar for a detailed description of these receptor expression constructs). Effects of recombinant TGFβ1 (4 ng/ml) on a 3TP-regulated firefly luciferase reporter gene (see above) were assessed in a series of three independent experiments and similar experiments performed using a Col1a2-luciferase construct. Adult TβRIIΔk Transgenic Mice Develop Skin and Lung Fibrosis—From a series of pronuclear injections, 13 PCR-positive founders were obtained. Seven of these founders (54%) showed bacterial β-galactosidase activity by X-gal staining of whole mount embryos (embryonic day 15.5), confirming that the integrated transgene was expressed. Of the expressing founders, there was a range intensity of X-gal staining, as observed in reporter mice previously (9Denton C.P. Zheng B. Shi-wen X. Bou-Gharios G. Zhang Z. Eberspaecher H. Black C.M. de Crombrugghe B. Arthritis Rheum. 2001; 44: 712-722Google Scholar), but all expression was in fibroblastic tissues, including stromal cells of specialized organs and at sites of membranous ossification in the skull. (Fig. 1B). Histological examination confirmed expression in meninges, fascia, dermis, and fibroblastic cells within developing limbs (Fig. 1, C–G). Two transgenic lines (designated F107 and M113) were established from female and male founders. Both lines demonstrated consistent expression in the skin and other fibroblastic structures, and one of these (M113) was used for detailed histological and biochemical studies. TβRIIΔk transgenic mice appeared normal postnatally, but from 6 weeks ∼25% of animals failed to thrive and lost weight. Systematic histological examination of these mice identified patchy areas of altered lung histology with reduced airspace and increased cellular connective tissue (Fig. 2, A and B) and extra"

We performed experiments aimed at determining whether intermittent fasting (IF) can improve cardiovascular health and also tested the hypothesis that beneficial effects of IF can be mimicked by dietary supplementation with 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) a non-metabolizable glucose analog. Four-month-old male rats were implanted with telemetry probes to allow continuous monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, physical activity, and body temperature. Rats were then maintained for 6 months on one of three different dietary regimens: ad libitum feeding, IF, or 2DG supplementation. Rats on the IF regimen consumed 30% less food over time and had reduced body weights compared with rats fed ad libitum, whereas rats on the 2DG regimen did not reduce their food intake and maintained their body weight. Heart rate and blood pressure were significantly decreased within 1 month in rats on IF and 2DG diets and were maintained at reduced levels thereafter. Body temperature was significantly decreased in group IF, but not in group 2DG. Levels of serum glucose and insulin were significantly decreased in rats maintained on IF and 2DG-supplemented diets, suggesting that IF and 2DG diets affect insulin sensitivity in a similar manner. Finally, rats in groups IF and 2DG exhibited increased levels of plasma adrenocorticotropin and corticosterone, indicating that these diets induced a stress response. We conclude that reductions in blood pressure, heart rate, and insulin levels, similar to or greater than those obtained with regular physical exercise programs, can be achieved by IF and by dietary supplementation with 2DG by a mechanism involving stress responses."
https://openalex.org/W2053283111,"Oxidative damage to DNA has been implicated in carcinogenesis during chronic inflammation. Epidemiological and biochemical studies suggest that one potential mechanism involves myeloperoxidase, a hemeprotein secreted by human phagocytes. In this study, we demonstrate that human neutrophils use myeloperoxidase to oxidize uracil to 5-chlorouracil in vitro. Uracil chlorination by myeloperoxidase or reagent HOCl exhibited an unusual pH dependence, being minimal at pH ∼5, but increasing markedly under either acidic or mildly basic conditions. This bimodal curve suggests that myeloperoxidase initially produces HOCl, which subsequently chlorinates uracil by acid- or base-catalyzed reactions. Human neutrophils use myeloperoxidase and H2O2 to chlorinate uracil, suggesting that nucleobase halogenation reactions may be physiologically relevant. Using a sensitive and specific mass spectrometric method, we detected two products of myeloperoxidase, 5-chlorouracil and 5-bromouracil, in neutrophil-rich human inflammatory tissue. Myeloperoxidase is the most likely source of 5-chlorouracil in vivo because halogenated uracil is a specific product of the myeloperoxidase system in vitro. In contrast, previous studies have demonstrated that 5-bromouracil could be generated by either eosinophil peroxidase or myeloperoxidase, which preferentially brominates uracil at plasma concentrations of halide and under moderately acidic conditions. These observations indicate that the myeloperoxidase system promotes nucleobase halogenation in vivo. Because 5-chlorouracil and 5-bromouracil can be incorporated into nuclear DNA, and these thymine analogs are well known mutagens, our observations raise the possibility that halogenation reactions initiated by phagocytes provide one pathway for mutagenesis and cytotoxicity at sites of inflammation.

The initial product of the enzyme is superoxide, which dismutates to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The oxidizing equivalents in H2O2 are used by myeloperoxidase (5Dunford H.B. Heme Peroxidases.

Science. 1986; 234: 200-203Google Scholar). HOCl produced by myeloperoxidase will also generate brominating oxidants in vitro and in vivo by a pathway that might involve bromine chloride (BrCl), HOBr, or other halogenating intermediates (13Henderson J.P.

In this study, we have investigated the role of myeloperoxidase in chlorinating uracil in vitro and used isotope dilution gas chromatography/mass spectrometry to identify 5-chlorouracil and 5-bromouracil in neutrophil-rich human inflammatory tissue. Our observations indicate that halogenating intermediates generated by phagocyte peroxidases represent one potential pathway for modifying nucleic acids at sites of inflammation in vivo. Materials—Myeloperoxidase (donor:hydrogen-peroxide oxidoreductase, EC 1.11.1.7) was isolated from HL-60 cells by sequential lectin affinity and size-exclusion chromatography (26Heinecke J.W. Li W. Francis G.A. Goldstein J.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 2866-2872Google Scholar, 27Rakita R.M. Michel B.R. Rosen H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 1075-1080Google Scholar). Enzyme concentration (A430/A280 > 0.8) was determined spectrophotometrically (ϵ430 = 178 mm–1 cm–1) (28Morita Y. Iwamoto H. Aibara S. Kobayashi T. Hasegawa E. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1986; 99: 761-770Google Scholar). Chloride-free sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) was prepared as described (18Henderson J.P. Byun J. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33440-33448Google Scholar, 29Thomas E.L. Grisham M.B. Jefferson M.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 569-585Google Scholar). The concentration of NaOCl was determined spectrophotometrically (ϵ292 = 350 m–1 cm–1) (30Morris J.C. J. Phys. Chem. 1966; 70: 3798-3805Google Scholar). 5-Bromo-[13C4,15N2]uracil was synthesized as described (19Henderson J.P. Byun J. Williams M.V. McCormick M.L. Parks W.C. Ridnour L.A. Heinecke J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1631-1636Google Scholar). For isotope-labeled 5-chlorouracil, [13C4,15N2]uracil (1 mm; Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., Andover, MA) was exposed to 1 mm HOCl for 15 min at 25 °C in 50 mm phosphoric acid and 1 m NaCl. The reaction was quenched by adding 6 mm l-methionine. 5-Chloro[13C4,15N2]uracil (isotope enrichment > 98%) was isolated by HPLC. 1The abbreviations used are: HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; GC, gas chromatography; TMS, trimethylsilyl; DTPA, di-ethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid; MS, mass spectrometry. The synthetic compound was identical to authentic 5-chlorouracil by HPLC and GC retention times; its TMS derivative exhibited an identical electron ionization mass spectrum with major fragment masses increased by 6 atomic mass units. Uracil Oxidation—Reactions were performed in buffer A (100 mm sodium chloride, 100 μm DTPA, and 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7). They were initiated by adding oxidant (H2O2 or HOCl) to vortexed samples and terminated by adding 6 mm l-methionine. The concentration of H2O2 was determined spectrophotometrically (ϵ240 = 39.4 m–1cm–1) (31Nelson D.P. Kiesow L.A. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 49: 474-478Google Scholar). The pH of the reaction mixtures was varied using phosphoric acid and Chelex 100 (Bio-Rad)-treated monobasic sodium phosphate and dibasic sodium phosphate. Human Neutrophils—Neutrophils were prepared by density gradient centrifugation (32Heinecke J.W. Li W. Daehnke H.L.R. Goldstein J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4069-4077Google Scholar) and suspended in buffer B (10 mm sodium phosphate, 100 mm NaCl, 1.4 mm CaCl2, 1.4 mm MgSO4,2mm dextrose, and 100 μm DTPA, pH 7) supplemented with 1 mm uracil. At the end of the incubation, the supernatant was extracted with 2-propanol/diethyl ether (22:78, v/v) (33Kok R.M. De Jong A.P.J.M. J. Chromatogr. 1985; 343: 59-66Google Scholar), which was then back-extracted with 0.2 m ammonium hydroxide and concentrated to dryness under vacuum. The extract was derivatized for electron capture GS/MS as described below. Reverse-phase HPLC—Uracil oxidation products were analyzed and purified for NMR analysis as described (34Henderson J.P. Byun J. Mueller D.M. Heinecke J.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2052-2059Google Scholar). For mass spectrometric analysis, HPLC fractions were collected and concentrated under nitrogen. Uracils extracted from human tissue were eluted from a reverse-phase HPLC column (34Henderson J.P. Byun J. Mueller D.M. Heinecke J.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2052-2059Google Scholar) at 1 ml/min with 95% solvent A (50 mm ammonium acetate) and 5% solvent B (50 mm ammonium acetate in 90% methanol) for 4 min, followed by a linear gradient to 100% solvent B over 20 min. NMR—The HPLC-purified reaction product was solubilized in D2O and analyzed at 25 °C with a Varian Unity-Plus 500 spectrometer (499.843 MHz for 1H) equipped with a Nalorac indirect detection probe. 1H chemical shifts were referenced to external sodium 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionate-2,2,3,3-d4 in D2O. Spectra were recorded from eight transients with a 12-s preacquisition delay over a spectral width of 8000 Hz. Uracil Extraction from Tissue—l-Methionine (6 mm final concentration) was added to tissue obtained for clinical indications and immediately frozen at –80 °C. Human plasma and urine were obtained from healthy volunteers. Following the addition of isotope-labeled internal standards (13C4,15N2-labeled uracil, 5-chlorouracil, and 5-bromouracil and [13C2,15N]uracil for monitoring artifactual halogenation), the thawed samples were extracted with 2-propanol/diethyl ether (22:78, v/v) (33Kok R.M. De Jong A.P.J.M. J. Chromatogr. 1985; 343: 59-66Google Scholar), which was back-extracted with 0.2 m ammonium hydroxide and then fractionated by reverse-phase HPLC as described above. Buffer A supplemented with uracil was subjected to the same isolation procedure and analyzed to ensure that ex vivo oxidation or contamination did not account for any observed analyte. GC/MS—Pentafluorobenzyl derivatives of pyrimidines were quantified by isotope dilution GC/MS. For tissue sample analysis, HPLC fractions were suspended in 0.2 m sodium phosphate (pH 10.5) containing 0.5 m tetrabutylammonium hydrogen sulfate. Uracil, 5-chlorouracil, and 5-bromouracil were alkylated for 60 min at 25 °C with dichloromethane containing pentafluorobenzyl bromide (33Kok R.M. De Jong A.P.J.M. J. Chromatogr. 1985; 343: 59-66Google Scholar). Following centrifugation, the aqueous phase was removed, and the organic phase was dried under nitrogen. Residual derivatizing agent was removed by silica gel chromatography (35Giese R.W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 271: 504-522Google Scholar). The derivatives were suspended in toluene, and 1-μl aliquots were injected using an on-column inlet on a Hewlett-Packard Model 6890 gas chromatograph equipped with a 12-m DB-1701 capillary column (0.2-mm inner diameter, 0.33-μm film thickness; J & W Scientific) interfaced with a Hewlett-Packard Model 5973 mass spectrometer. Ions were monitored in the negative ion electron capture ionization mode with methane as the reagent gas. Injector and interface temperatures were 280 and 290 °C, respectively. The initial GC oven temperature was 170 °C for 1 min, followed by a 10 °C/min increasing ramp to 250 °C. Toluene was analyzed between samples to ensure that traces of analyte were not being carried over. TMS derivatives of pyrimidines were prepared and analyzed by GC/MS as described (18Henderson J.P. Byun J. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33440-33448Google Scholar). The Myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl–System Chlorinates Uracil at Plasma Concentrations of Halide Ions—We exposed uracil to the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl– system in buffer A and used HPLC to characterize the product. The reaction mixture yielded a new peak of material with a retention time and UV-visible absorption spectrum identical to those of authentic 5-chlorouracil (Fig. 1, A and B). The structure of the uracil oxidation product was investigated by GC/MS (Fig. 1C). The GC retention times and electron ionization mass spectra of the TMS derivatives of the oxidation product and authentic 5-chlorouracil were essentially identical. The oxidation product exhibited a molecular ion at m/z 290 and a prominent fragment ion at m/z 275 consistent with the ·CH3 loss typical of TMS derivatives. These ions also exhibited prominent (M + 2) isotope peaks consistent with the isotopic abundance of 35Cl and 37Cl, strongly suggesting a monochlorinated product. Ions consistent with loss of chlorine radical were observed at m/z 255 ([M-Cl]+) and m/z 239 ([M-CH3-HCl]+ or [M-CH4-Cl]+). As anticipated for compounds that lack chlorine, these fragment ions no longer exhibited the prominent (M + 2) isotopic pattern. Myeloperoxidase Chlorinates Uracil at C-5 of the Pyrimidine Ring—To determine the position of chlorine on the pyrimidine ring of uracil, we used HPLC to isolate the product from the myeloperoxidase reaction mixture and analyzed it with high resolution 1H NMR. The spectrum of the product was essentially identical to that of authentic 5-chlorouracil (data not shown), but it was distinct from that of 6-chlorouracil. Significant features included loss of the C-5 proton resonance, a downfield shift in the C-6 proton, and conversion of the C-6 proton resonance from a doublet to a singlet. These findings are consistent with substitution of a chlorine atom at C-5 of the pyrimidine ring. 5-Chlorouracil Is a Specific Product of Myeloperoxidase—We used reverse-phase HPLC to characterize uracil chlorination by various peroxidases. 5-Chlorouracil was generated by myeloperoxidase, but not by eosinophil peroxidase, lactoperoxidase, or horseradish peroxidase. The reaction required myeloperoxidase, H2O2, and Cl–. It was blocked by catalase, a scavenger of H2O2, and azide and 3-aminotriazole, two inhibitors of heme enzymes. Methionine, a potent scavenger of HOCl, also blocked the reaction (Table I). These results demonstrate that chlorination of uracil by myeloperoxidase requires active enzyme, Cl–, and H2O2. Adding 4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid, a phenolic compound, causes only a minor reduction in 5-chlorouracil yield (36Eiserich J.P. Hristova M. Cross C.E. Jones A.D. Freeman B.A. Halliwell B. van der Vliet A. Nature. 1998; 391: 393-397Google Scholar). This observation suggests that myeloperoxidase chlorinates uracil more readily than it chlorinates a phenolic ring.Table IProduction of 5-chlorouracil by peroxidases and other oxidation systemsCondition5-ChlorouracilμMComplete peroxidase systemMyeloperoxidase15.2 ± 0.1Eosinophil peroxidase<0.1Lactoperoxidase<0.1Horseradish peroxidase<0.1Complete myeloperoxidase system minusMyeloperoxidase<0.1H2O2<0.1Cl-<0.1Complete myeloperoxidase system plusAzide (10 mM)<0.13-Aminotriazole (10 mM)<0.1L-Methionine (6 mM)<0.1Catalase (200 nM)<0.14-Hydroxyphenylacetic acid (1 mM)12.3 ± 0.2Other oxidation systemsHOCl (50 μM)52.4 ± 0.6FeSO4 (100 μM)<0.1FeSO4 + H2O2 (100 μM + 2 mM)<0.1CuSO4 + H2O2 (100 μM + 2 mM)<0.1Glucose (100 mM)<0.1 Open table in a new tab Reagent HOCl generated 5-chlorouracil almost quantitatively at neutral pH in buffer A, which contained a plasma concentration of NaCl. In contrast, two different systems that generate hydroxyl radical, FeSO4 plus excess H2O2 and CuSO4 plus excess H2O2 (37Huggins T.G. Wells-Knecht M.C. Detorie N.A. Baynes J.W. Thorpe S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12341-12347Google Scholar), failed to chlorinate uracil, as did FeSO4 alone or glucose (Table I). Collectively, these results indicate that HOCl generated by myeloperoxidase converts uracil into 5-chlorouracil and that hydroxyl radical, ferrous iron, or glycoxidation reactions are unable to chlorinate uracil under our experimental conditions. Ascorbate and Thiols Potently Inhibit Uracil Chlorination by Myeloperoxidase—We used HPLC to examine the effects of antioxidants on the yield of 5-chlorouracil produced by the myeloperoxidase system (Table II). The water-soluble antioxidants ascorbate, N-acetylcysteine, and glutathione, which react with HOCl to form dehydroascorbate and oxygenated thiols, inhibited uracil chlorination almost completely. Taurine, which reacts with HOCl to produce chloramines, significantly reduced the yield of 5-chlorouracil. Nitrite, a nitric oxide breakdown product, also inhibited uracil chlorination, perhaps by acting as an alternative substrate for myeloperoxidase or by reacting with HOCl to produce nitrosyl chloride and nitrate. Less effective were trolox, a water-soluble vitamin E analog, and phenol, which would be expected to form p-chlorophenol. Mannitol, frequently used as a hydroxyl radical scavenger, had virtually no effect on 5-chlorouracil production. These observations indicate that water-soluble antioxidants that scavenge HOCl are effective inhibitors of uracil chlorination by myeloperoxidase.Table IIAntioxidant and nitrite effects on 5-chlorouracil generation by the myeloperoxidase-H2O2-Cl- systemAntioxidant5-Chlorouracil (% inhibition)μMNone16.0 ± 0.2 (0)Ascorbate<0.1 (99)N-Acetyl cysteine<0.1 (99)Glutathione0.3 ± 0.1(98)Taurine2.8 ± 0.3(82)Sodium nitrite5.8 ± 0.1(64)Trolox9.6 ± 0.8(40)Phenol11.3 ± 0.1(29)Mannitol15.9 ± 0.2 (1) Open table in a new tab Uracil Chlorination by Myeloperoxidase Has Both Acidic and Neutral pH Optima—Uracil chlorination by myeloperoxidase at neutral pH increased with increasing peroxide concentration and reaction time (Fig. 2) and was optimal at a plasma concentration of Cl– (100 mm). The product yield of 5-chlorouracil was ∼20% relative to peroxide. The pH dependence for chlorination by myeloperoxidase showed an unusual bimodality, with optima at pH 4 and 7 (Fig. 2). These observations indicate that myeloperoxidase produces high yields of 5-chlorouracil under both neutral and acidic conditions. Two Distinct Reaction Pathways Chlorinate Uracil—To better understand the mechanism for 5-chlorouracil production, we examined the pH dependence of 5-chlorouracil formation by HOCl, the chlorinating intermediate generated by myeloperoxidase (Fig. 3). Reagent HOCl produced quantitative yields of 5-chlorouracil under both strongly acidic and mildly basic conditions, with the product yield being lowest at pH 5. Because Cl2 is in equilibrium with HOCl by a reaction requiring Cl– and H+ (38Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Mueller D.M. Crowley J.R. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1283-1289Google Scholar), we explored its role in the reaction using chloride-free HOCl. Omitting NaCl (Fig. 3, –NaCl) had little effect on the 5-chlorouracil yield when the pH of the reaction mixture was >5. In contrast, omission of Cl– markedly diminished the product yield when the pH was <5. Under strongly acidic conditions, chlorination of uracil was independent of Cl–, possibly due to generation of Cl2 from trace amounts of Cl– contaminant. At plasma concentrations of Cl–, chlorination of uracil was directly proportional to the concentration of HOCl in the reaction mixture at both pH 4 and 8 (Fig. 3). However, the yield of 5-chlorouracil was increased markedly by Cl– at pH 4, but was independent of Cl– at pH 8. The rate of uracil chlorination was also significantly increased by 100 mm Cl– at pH 4, but not at pH 8 (Fig. 3). It is noteworthy that the reaction rate was highest at pH 8. In contrast, ring chlorination of deoxycytidine by HOCl is optimal under acidic conditions (18Henderson J.P. Byun J. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33440-33448Google Scholar). These observations suggest that chlorination of uracil by myeloperoxidase involves two different reaction pathways. Under acidic conditions, a Cl2-like species mediates chlorination. Under neutral conditions, chlorination involves HOCl or its conjugate base, ClO– (pKa ∼ 7.2). Activated Human Neutrophils Generate 5-Chlorouracil—To determine whether human phagocytes can also chlorinate uracil, we incubated neutrophils in a physiological salt solution supplemented with 1 mm uracil. Phorbol ester-stimulated neutrophils produced a peak of material that co-migrated with 5-chlorouracil upon HPLC. We isolated this material by HPLC, converted it to the pentafluorobenzyl derivative, and analyzed the derivative by negative ion chemical ionization GC/MS. The GC retention time, mass spectrum, and isotope pattern of the derivative identified the material as 5-chlorouracil. Formation of 5-chlorouracil required activation of the neutrophils with phorbol ester and was inhibited by azide and catalase, implicating a peroxidase and H2O2 in the reaction (Table III). In contrast, superoxide dismutase modestly enhanced the product yield, perhaps by increasing the availability of H2O2 or by preventing superoxide from inactivating myeloperoxidase (39Kettle A.J. Sangster D.F. Gebicki J.M. Winterbourn C.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 956: 58-62Google Scholar).Table IIIRequirements for conversion of uracil into 5-chlorouracil by human neutrophilsCondition5-ChlorouracilnMComplete system161 ± 10Complete system minusPhorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (200 nM)<10Cells<10Complete system plusAzide (10 mM)<10L-Methionine (6 mM)<10Catalase (10 μg/ml)<10Superoxide dismutase (10 μg/ml)186 ± 7 Open table in a new tab Human Inflammatory Tissue Contains 5-Chlorouracil and 5-Bromouracil—To determine whether phagocytes halogenate uracil in vivo, we searched for 5-chlorouracil and 5-bromouracil in tissue harvested from six humans suffering from a variety of bacterial infections. Each tissue sample represented an inflammatory exudate collected from a site of superficial infection and was rich in neutrophils and cellular debris. After adding internal standards and 6 mm l-methionine (a scavenger of HOCl and H2O2) to the samples, uracils were extracted and subjected to reverse-phase HPLC. Materials eluting with the HPLC retention time of uracil, 5-chlorouracil, or 5-bromouracil were converted to their pentafluorobenzyl derivatives and analyzed by negative ion electron capture GC/MS. The samples of inflammatory tissue contained 60–600 μm uracil, a substrate for halogenation by myeloperoxidase. GC/MS analysis revealed two peaks of material that exhibited major ions and retention times identical to those of authentic 5-chlorouracil and 5-bromouracil (Fig. 4). Selected ion monitoring demonstrated that the ions derived from 5-chlorouracil and 5-bromouracil coeluted with those derived from 5-chloro[13C4,15N2]uracil and 5-bromo[13C4,15N2]uracil, respectively. The isotopic distribution of 35Cl and 37Cl was exploited to confirm the identity of 5-chlorouracil. Selected ion monitoring demonstrated the peak area ratio (∼3:1) of the ions at m/z 325 and 327 expected for a monochlorinated compound. Similarly, the isotopic distribution of 79Br and 81Br demonstrated the peak area ratio (∼1:1) of the ions at m/z 369 and 371 expected for a monobrominated compound. The mass/charge ratios of ions, isotopic patterns, and retention times upon GC were consistent with the presence of endogenous 5-chlorouracil and 5-bromouracil in the human inflammatory tissue samples. All of the infected patients had 5-chlorouracil and/or 5-bromouracil in their inflammatory tissues. Quantification by isotope dilution GC/MS demonstrated that 5-chlorouracil was present in the samples from all six individuals with levels ranging from 0.7 to 36 μmol/mol of uracil. Three of these samples also contained 5-bromouracil; the levels of this halogenated nucleobase ranged from 3.9 to 59 μmol/mol of uracil. When 5-bromouracil was detected, it was more abundant than 5-chlorouracil, suggesting that eosinophil peroxidase contributes to uracil halogenation or that Br– is present at high enough levels to favor bromination by myeloperoxidase (13Henderson J.P. Byun J. Williams M.V. Mueller D.M. McCormick M.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7867-7875Google Scholar, 40Gaut J.P. Yeh G.C. Tran H.D. Byun J. Henderson J.P. Richter G.M. Brennan M.L. Lusis A.J. Belaaouaj A. Hotchkiss R.S. Heinecke J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11961-11966Google Scholar). To determine whether the 5-chlorouracil or 5-bromouracil detected in the samples might have been generated artifactually during workup, we performed three sets of experiments. First, the analytic procedure was applied to samples of plasma or urine from healthy donors. Under these conditions, neither halogenated base was detectable. Second, we quantified the levels of halogenated nucleobases in livers harvested from apparently healthy mice. We again failed to detect either 5-chlorouracil or 5-bromouracil (limit of detection, ∼0.9 nmol/mol of uracil), providing strong evidence that artifactual halogenation of uracil did not take place during tissue workup or analysis. Third, uracil labeled with two 13C atoms and one 15N atom was added to inflamed tissue. The material was extracted, derivatized, and analyzed by negative ion electron capture GC/MS (Fig. 4, A and C). Any uracil that was artifactually chlorinated or brominated during the analysis would have been detected as halogenated [13C2,15N1]uracil. The base peaks ([M-pentafluorobenzyl·]–) of the pentafluorobenzyl· derivatives of chlorinated and brominated [13C2,15N1]uracils were at m/z 328 (35Cl isotopomer) and 374 (81Br isotopomer), respectively. However, ions at m/z 328 or 374 could also be attributed to the naturally occurring 13C present in endogenous 5-chlorouracil or 5-bromouracil. When a correction was made for the contribution of 13C derived from endogenous 5-chlorouracil (relative abundance of 13C to 12C is ∼0.01), the peak of material at m/z 328 that coeluted with the 5-chlorouracil internal standard corresponded to a level of artifact <1%. Similarly, peaks of material observed at m/z 374 accounted for only 1.6, 1.7, and 5.2% of the endogenous 5-bromouracil observed in three independent analyses. Collectively, these observations indicate that 5-chlorouracil and 5-bromouracil were present in inflamed human tissue and that the halogenated pyrimidines were not generated ex vivo during extraction or analysis. Our results demonstrate that both purified myeloperoxidase and human neutrophils can chlorinate uracil in vitro and that inflamed human tissue contains both chlorinated and brominated uracils. These findings provide strong evidence that nucleobases are targeted for halogenation during inflammation in human tissue, raising the possibility that oxidants generated by myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase play key roles in the pathways for DNA damage during inflammation. Myeloperoxidase is the most likely source of 5-chlorouracil in vivo because the latter is a specific product of the myeloperoxidase system in vitro. In contrast, 5-bromouracil could be generated by either eosinophil peroxidase or myeloperoxidase (13Henderson J.P. Byun J. Williams M.V. Mueller D.M. McCormick M.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7867-7875Google Scholar, 34Henderson J.P. Byun J. Mueller D.M. Heinecke J.W. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2052-2059Google Scholar), both of which preferentially brominate uracil at plasma concentrations of halide (100 mm Cl– and 100 μm Br–). In fact, we have recently shown that 3-chlorotyrosine and 3-bromotyrosine production is inhibited in mice deficient in myeloperoxidase, indicating that the enzyme promotes both chlorination and bromination reactions in vivo (40Gaut J.P. Yeh G.C. Tran H.D. Byun J. Henderson J.P. Richter G.M. Brennan M.L. Lusis A.J. Belaaouaj A. Hotchkiss R.S. Heinecke J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 11961-11966Google Scholar). 5-Chlorouracil and 5-bromouracil might also be generated indirectly by deamination of cytosine nucleosides that have been halogenated by phagocyte peroxidases (13Henderson J.P. Byun J. Williams M.V. Mueller D.M. McCormick M.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7867-7875Google Scholar, 18Henderson J.P. Byun J. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33440-33448Google Scholar). Although only low concentrations of uracil, a substrate for myeloperoxidase halogenation, are normally present in plasma, the dissolution of dead cells that occurs during inflammation would presumably liberate nucleobases and nucleosides into the extracellular environment. Indeed, we found the uracil content of inflamed tissue fluid (as high as 600 μm) to be nearly 1000-fold higher than that of plasma, as assessed by isotope dilution GC/MS. Therefore, inflammation greatly increases the free pyrimidine content of tissue, providing myeloperoxidase with ample substrate for halogenation. The inflammatory milieu thus provides all of the necessary factors (numerous phagocytes and a high local concentration of substrate) for halogenation of pyrimidines. Furthermore, because inflammation also causes cells to proliferate, it sets the stage for thymine analogs such as halogenated nucleobases to be incorporated into newly synthesized DNA (1Ames B.N. Gold L.S. Willett W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5258-5265Google Scholar). The chlorination of uracil by myeloperoxidase or reagent HOCl exhibited an unusual pH dependence, being minimal at pH ∼5, but increasing markedly under either acidic or mildly basic conditions. This bimodal curve suggests that myeloperoxidase initially produces HOCl, which subsequently chlorinates uracil by acid- or base-catalyzed reactions. 5-Chlorouracil formation by reagent HOCl was independent of Cl– under neutral and basic conditions, suggesting that chlorination involves HOCl or its conjugate base, ClO–. The increased reactivity of uracil at basic pH may derive from preferential halogenation of uracil anion (pKa ∼ 9.5) or a different, tautomeric form of uracil. In contrast, chlorination by HOCl below pH 5 was strongly dependent on Cl–, suggesting the involvement of a Cl2-like species in a different reaction pathway. These observations indicate that myeloperoxidase chlorinates uracil by two different pathways that appear to involve HOCl under basic conditions and Cl2 under acidic conditions. The precise role of antioxidants in preventing DNA damage in vivo will depend critically on the underlying chemistry for damage. Our in vitro experiments showed that the chlorination of uracil by HOCl was strongly inhibited by ascorbate and low molecular mass thiols. In contrast, the vitamin E analog trolox and phenol had little effect. These results suggest that ascorbate and glutathione, but not phenolic compounds such as vitamin E, might help protect nucleobases from oxidative damage by halogenating intermediates in vivo. It is noteworthy that ascorbate promotes modification of nucleobases by products of lipid peroxidation in vitro (41Lee S.H. Oe T. Blair I.A. Science. 2001; 292: 2083-2086Google Scholar), emphasizing the importance of understanding the chemical mechanisms of DNA damage in vivo. Previous studies have demonstrated that the artifactual generation of halogenated and nitrated oxidation products is a major problem during the analysis of biological material (42Cadet J. Douki T. Ravanat J. Environ. Health Perspect. 1997; 105: 1034-1039Google Scholar, 43Hazen S.L. Crowley J.R. Mueller D.M. Heinecke J.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 909-916Google Scholar, 44Gaut J.P. Byun J. Tran H.D. Lauber W.M. Carroll J.A. Hotchkiss R.S. Belaaouaj A. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 1311-1319Google Scholar, 45Gaut J.P. Byun J. Tran H.D. Heinecke J.W. Anal.

J. 2000; 345: 453-458Google Scholar). Indeed, some studies have found that virtually all of the oxidation products detected in tissue were generated artifactually (42Cadet J. Douki T. Ravanat J. Environ. Health Perspect. 1997; 105: 1034-1039Google Scholar, 46Yi D. Ingelse B.A. Duncan M.W. Smythe G.A. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 11: 578-586Google Scholar, 47Frost M.T. Halliwell B. Moore K.P. Biochem. J. 2000; 345: 453-458Google Scholar). This is particularly a problem when acidic conditions are used for sample hydrolysis or derivatization. However, we were unable to detect halogenated nucleobases in human plasma or urine or in livers harvested from apparently healthy mice. Moreover, we directly monitored the ex vivo formation of halogenated nucleobases by adding [13C2,15N1]-uracil to tissue samples and then monitoring the appearance of halogenated [13C2,15N1]uracil. Artifactual halogenation accounted for <1% of the 5-chlorouracil and <5% of the 5-bromouracil that we detected in inflammatory tissue. Collectively, these observations provide strong evidence that 5-chlorouracil and 5-bromouracil were present in the inflamed human tissue and that the halogenated pyrimidines were not generated ex vivo during extraction or analysis. Whereas many studies have focused on direct oxidation of chromosomal DNA as a mechanism for mutagenesis (1Ames B.N. Gold L.S. Willett W.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5258-5265Google Scholar, 2Marnett L.J. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 361-370Google Scholar), we recently showed that myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase brominate the free nucleobase uracil and the free nucleoside deoxycytidine in vitro at plasma concentrations of chloride and bromide (13Henderson J.P. Byun J. Williams M.V. Mueller D.M. McCormick M.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 7867-7875Google Scholar, 19Henderson J.P. Byun J. Williams M.V. McCormick M.L. Parks W.C. Ridnour L.A.

MS, flow cytometric analysis, and immunohistochemical studies revealed that 5-bromouracil is incorporated into the DNA of dividing mammalian cells exposed to purified 5-bromodeoxycytidine produced by eosinophil peroxidase (19Henderson J.P. Byun J. Williams M.V. McCormick M.L. Parks W.C. Ridnour L.A. Heinecke J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1631-1636Google Scholar). Previous studies have also shown that 5-chlorouracil and 5-bromouracil can be taken up by mammalian cells and tissues and subsequently converted to their corresponding deoxynucleosides by thymidine phosphorylase (48Gotto A.M. Belkhode M.L. Touster O. Cancer Res. 1969; 29: 807-811Google Scholar, 49Pal B.C. Cumming R.B. Walton M.F. Preston R.J. Mutat. Res. 1981; 91: 395-401Google Scholar). DNA polymerase then incorporates the resulting chlorodeoxyuridine and bromodeoxyuridine into DNA (50Morris S.M. Mutat. Res. 1993; 297: 39-51Google Scholar, 51Morris S.M. Mutat. Res. 1991; 258: 161-188Google Scholar). Thus, our detection of halogenated uracil may be significant, as 5-chlorodeoxyuridine and 5-bromodeoxyuridine are well established thymidine analog mutagens that mispair with guanine, causing GC-to-AT and AT-to-GC transitions (52Yu H. Eritja R. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15935-15943Google Scholar). Based on our own observations and previous findings, we propose that nucleobases are halogenated by phagocytes and incorporated into host DNA during replication or repair in a process we term nucleotide precursor mutagenesis. In this way, DNA may be damaged both indirectly by incorporation of halogenated nucleosides and directly by oxidation of DNA in situ. We have demonstrated that 5-chlorouracil is a specific product of myeloperoxidase and have detected two products of myeloperoxidase, 5-chlorouracil and 5-bromouracil, in neutrophil-rich inflammatory tissue from humans. These observations indicate that human neutrophils use myeloperoxidase to halogenate uracil in vivo. Transition mutations occurring in genes containing these halogenated nucleobases could then alter cell cycle regulation, DNA replication, or DNA repair, creating a link between myeloperoxidase activity and increased cancer risk.

https://openalex.org/W2063413026,"Deactivation of light-activated rhodopsin (metarhodopsin II) involves, after rhodopsin kinase and arrestin interactions, the hydrolysis of the covalent bond of all-trans-retinal to the apoprotein. Although the long-lived storage form metarhodopsin III is transiently formed, all-trans-retinal is eventually released from the active site. Here we address the question of whether the release results in a retinal that is freely diffusible in the lipid phase of the photoreceptor membrane. The release reaction is accompanied by an increase in intrinsic protein fluorescence (release signal), which arises from the relief of the fluorescence quenching imposed by the retinal in the active site. An analogous fluorescence decrease (uptake signal) was evoked by exogenous retinoids when they non-covalently bound to native opsin membranes. Uptake of 11-cis-retinal was faster than formation of the retinylidene linkage to the apoprotein. Endogenous all-trans-retinal released from the active site during metarhodopsin II decay did not generate the uptake signal. The data show that in addition to the retinylidene pocket (site I) there are two other retinoidbinding sites within opsin. Site II involved in the uptake signal is an entrance site, while the exit site (site III) is occupied when retinal remains bound after its release from site I. Support for a retinal channeling mechanism comes from the rhodopsin crystal structure, which unveiled two putative hydrophobic binding sites. This mechanism enables a unidirectional process for the release of photoisomerized chromophore and the uptake of newly synthesized 11-cis-retinal for the regeneration of rhodopsin.

Support for a retinal channeling mechanism comes from the rhodopsin crystal structure, which unveiled two putative hydrophobic binding sites. This mechanism enables a unidirectional process for the release of photoisomerized chromophore and the uptake of newly synthesized 11-cis-retinal for the regeneration of rhodopsin. During its function as a photoreceptor, the visual pigment rhodopsin undergoes changes through a cycle of uptake of 11-cis-retinal and release of photoisomerized chromophore, all-trans-retinal (reviewed in Ref. 1McBee J.K. Palczewski K. Baehr W. Pepperberg D.R. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2001; 20: 469-529Google Scholar). In rhodopsin, 11-cis-retinal is bound to the opsin apoprotein by a Schiff base linkage to Lys296. In the dark ground state, the rhodopsin conformation with a λmax of 500 nm is stabilized by a salt bridge between the protonated Schiff base and the Glu113 counterion. The activated state metarhodopsin II (Meta II, λmax = 380 nm) arises from light-induced 11-cis/all-trans-retinal isomerization and conformational changes that break the salt bridge but retain the all-trans-retinylidene linkage in the original binding site (reviewed in Refs. 2Okada T.

Thereby, photoisomerization is coupled to the protein conformational change that leads to a G-proteincoupled signal cascade, eventually setting off neuronal signaling (1McBee J.K. Palczewski K. Baehr W. Pepperberg D.R. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2001; 20: 469-529Google Scholar). Initial deactivation of Meta II begins with the interaction of active rhodopsin with its receptor kinase, phosphorylation of the receptor, and a tight binding of arrestin to the still activated phosphorylated form of the receptor (6Palczewski K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 261-269Google Scholar, 7Pulvermüller A. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14082-14088Google Scholar). Full deactivation occurs when rhodopsin is regenerated. This requires the hydrolysis of the all-trans-retinylidene linkage and release of all-trans-retinal from the active site (1McBee J.K. Palczewski K. Baehr W. Pepperberg D.R. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2001; 20: 469-529Google Scholar). Critical steps include the nucleophilic attack of water on the retinylidene bond within the hydrophobic binding site of rhodopsin and the diffusion of the hydrolyzed chromophore out of the binding pocket. Formation of opsin accompanies a significant increase in intrinsic Trp fluorescence after release of all-trans-retinal from the active site (8Heck M. Schädel S.A. Maretzki D. Bartl F.J. Ritter E.

The retinal remains associated with opsin membranes and is converted by endogenous NADPH-dependent retinol dehydrogenase (RDH, 1The abbreviations used are: RDH, retinol dehydrogenase; BTP, bis-Tris-propane; Gt, photoreceptor G-protein, transducin; HTO, heptane-1,2,3-triol; Meta II, metarhodopsin II (photoactivated rhodopsin); Meta III, metarhodopsin III; DM, n-dodecyl-β-maltoside; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; ROS, rod outer segment. reviewed in Ref. 1McBee J.K.

Maretzki D. Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3162-3169Google Scholar). However, the stability of the complex between arrestin and phosphorylated Meta II may depend on the RDH activity (10Palczewski K. Jäger S. Buczylko J. Crouch R.K. Bredberg D.L. Hofmann K.P.

Chem. 1992; 267: 15701-15706Google Scholar). In addition, during the Meta II decay a storage form of rhodopsin, metarhodopsin III (Meta III), is generated. Meta III and opsin are formed in parallel (8Heck M. Schädel S.A. Maretzki D. Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3162-3169Google Scholar). Studies on the effect of active site methylation (12Jäger S. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2901-2908Google Scholar) and palmitoylation of opsin on transducin (Gt) activation, and the retinoid competition on regeneration (13Sachs K. Maretzki D. Hofmann K.P.

Chem. 2000; 275: 6189-6194Google Scholar), led to the proposal of a secondary binding site for all-trans-retinal within the opsin molecule. In this study, we demonstrate a site-directed retinal migration from the active site to an exit site during Meta II decay. Once this process has occurred, 11-cis-retinal is taken up into an entrance site and moved to the active site for rhodopsin regeneration. This ligand channeling mechanism is based firmly on the crystal structure of rhodopsin (15Teller D.C. Okada T. Behnke C.A. Palczewski K. Stenkamp R.E.

Wilden U. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 81: 489-496Google Scholar). Rhodopsin concentration was determined in solubilized samples (1% LDAO) from the difference in absorption at 500 nm before and after the complete bleaching using extinction coefficient ϵ = 40,600 m–1 cm–1. Opsin membranes were prepared from illuminated disc membranes, in the presence of hydroxylamine (10 mm), by extraction of the photoisomerized chromophore with bovine serum albumin (fatty acid-free) (13Sachs K. Maretzki D. Hofmann K.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 238-251Google Scholar, 14Sachs K. Maretzki D. Meyer C.K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6189-6194Google Scholar). Opsin concentration was determined in solubilized samples (1% n-dodecyl-β-maltoside, DM) from its absorption at 280 nm using extinction coefficient ϵ = 81,200 m–1 cm–1 (19Surya A. Foster K.W. Knox B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5024-5031Google Scholar). All membrane preparations were resuspended in isotonic BTP-buffer (130 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm bis-Tris-propane, pH 7.5) and stored at –80 °C with 0.3 m sucrose. Membrane suspensions were sonicated briefly prior to the fluorescence measurements to reduce turbidity. Samples were solublized at low concentrations of opsin in membranes (∼1 μm) with 0.1% DM in the BTP buffer. Illumination Protocol—Complete bleaching (15 s at 495 nm) of rhodopsin membranes under conditions favoring Meta II was carried out at pH 6.0 (20 °C), and pH was adjusted to the desired value immediately after photoactivation (8Heck M. Schädel S.A. Maretzki D. Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3162-3169Google Scholar). To reach a complete decay of Meta II, the sample was incubated for 60 min. Fluorescence Measurements—Emission spectra of intrinsic Trp fluorescence (SPEX Fluorolog 1680 instrument) were recorded between 310 and 400 nm using excitation at 295 nm and in BTP buffer, pH 6.5, at 20 °C. Samples were bovine serum albumin-stripped opsin membranes or solubilized opsin (0.1% DM) at a final concentration of 1 μm in 750 μl. In some samples, ethanolic solutions of retinoids (5 μl) were added in a stoichiometric amount to opsin. The excitation and emission slit bandpass were 0.4 and 7 nm, respectively. Low light intensities were used to prevent bleaching reactions of retinal or rhodopsin in the samples. For time-resolved records, fluorescence emission was monitored at 330 nm under the conditions outlined above. The fluorescence intensity was measured in counts per second (cps). Protein and Chromophore Modeling—A rhodopsin model suitable for simulations was built using the coordinates deposited in the Protein Data Bank under 1HZX identifier (15Teller D.C. Okada T. Behnke C.A. Palczewski K. Stenkamp R.E. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7761-7772Google Scholar). Hydrogen atoms were added in Insight II (v.2000, Accelrys, San Diego, CA). Missing loops of rhodopsin were created using Modeler module (20Sali A. Potterton L. Yuan F. van Vlijmen H. Karplus M. Proteins. 1995; 23: 318-326Google Scholar) of Insight II. Verifications of created loops and the whole structure were done using Profile-3D module (21Bowie J.U. Luthy R. Eisenberg D. Science. 1991; 253: 164-170Google Scholar) by calculating the compatibility between the sequence and the structure. Quenching of the Intrinsic Protein Fluorescence upon Uptake of Retinal into Opsin—Changes in intrinsic Trp fluorescence are monitors of interactions between 11-cis-retinal or all-trans-retinal and opsin (8Heck M. Schädel S.A. Maretzki D. Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3162-3169Google Scholar, 9Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. J. Biol.

Addition of all-trans-retinal to membranes containing opsin significantly quenched the Trp fluorescence emission (Fig. 1A). This change coincided with the observation that all-trans-retinal formed a non-covalent complex with opsin (11Hofmann K.P. Pulvermüller A. Buczylko J. Van Hooser P. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15701-15706Google Scholar, 12Jäger S. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2901-2908Google Scholar, 13Sachs K. Maretzki D. Hofmann K.P. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 315: 238-251Google Scholar, 14Sachs K. Maretzki D. Meyer C.K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6189-6194Google Scholar, 24Fukada Y. Yoshizawa T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 675: 195-200Google Scholar, 25Cohen G.B. Oprian D.D. Robinson P.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12592-12601Google Scholar, 26Cohen G.B. Yang T. Robinson P.R. Oprian D.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6111-6115Google Scholar). When the membranes were solubilized in n-dodecyl-β-maltoside (DM), all-trans-retinal had only a minor effect on opsin fluorescence, suggesting that the binding of the retinal to opsin is detergent-sensitive (Fig. 1C). Addition of 11-cis-retinal to either membrane-bound or solubilized opsin significantly quenched Trp fluorescence (Fig. 1, B and D). 11-cis-Retinal regenerated rhodopsin under both conditions, as evidenced by an increase in absorption at 500 nm (data not shown), thereby quenching the intrinsic Trp fluorescence. These experiments unveiled that binding of all-trans-retinal or 11-cis-retinal leads to a decrease in intrinsic protein fluorescence emission. However, only 11-cis-retinal can regenerate rhodopsin. 11-cis-Retinal Uptake Precedes Schiff Base Formation—The interaction of retinal isomers with opsin was further analyzed by monitoring the time-dependent changes of intrinsic Trp fluorescence (Fig. 2). The complex formation between all-trans-retinal and membrane-bound opsin proceeded within seconds (t½ ∼5 s; Fig. 2, trace a). As expected (14Sachs K. Maretzki D. Meyer C.K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6189-6194Google Scholar), subsequent illumination of the opsin·all-trans-retinal complex did not result in any significant change in fluorescence. The uptake signal, as we term the rapid decrease in intrinsic protein fluorescence upon addition of retinoids, induced by addition of 11-cis-retinal to opsin membranes is biphasic (Fig. 2, trace b). The initial fast phase (t½ ∼6 s) is similar to the uptake signal seen with all-trans-retinal. The slower decrease in fluorescence intensity appeared to follow regeneration of rhodopsin (data not shown). This is confirmed by the fact that subsequent illumination led to an expected increase in fluorescence (Fig. 2, trace b) (8Heck M. Schädel S.A. Maretzki D. Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3162-3169Google Scholar, 9Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5073-5076Google Scholar), termed here the “release signal,” that is specific only to retinoids that regenerate pigments such as 9-cis-retinal (trace d) (27Kandori H. Shichida Y. Yoshizawa T. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 2001; 66: 1197-1209Google Scholar, 28Kawamura S. Wakabayashi S. Maeda A. Yoshizawa T. Vision Res. 1978; 18: 457-462Google Scholar), and not 13-cis-retinal (trace c), or all-trans-retinal (trace a). The results demonstrate that both all-trans-retinal and 11-cis-retinal associate very rapidly with opsin to form opsin·retinal complexes. In the case of 11-cis-retinal, the complex is the precursor of the regenerated pigment. In solubilized samples, the uptake signal with 11-cis-retinal is slower (t½ ∼140 s; Fig. 2, trace f). The signal likely correspond to regeneration of rhodopsin, in which the retinal bound in the original pocket, quenches Trp fluorescence. Consistently, a substantial fluorescence change was induced by illumination of the sample after completion of the uptake signal, showing that a considerable fraction of opsin was regenerated to light-sensitive rhodopsin under these conditions. Virtually no light-induced fluorescence changes are observed after incubation of solubilized opsin with all-trans-retinal or 13-cis-retinal (Fig. 2, traces e and g), while 9-cis-retinal (Fig. 2, trace h) had similar properties to those of 11-cis-retinal. Uptake of Retinal After Decay of Meta II—The decay of Meta II is accompanied by a significant increase in fluorescence, both in detergent (8Heck M. Schädel S.A. Maretzki D. Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3162-3169Google Scholar, 9Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5073-5076Google Scholar) and in native membranes (8Heck M. Schädel S.A. Maretzki D. Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3162-3169Google Scholar). This is the release signal, reflecting the release of all-trans-retinal from the active site. Here, Meta II formed in membranes was allowed to decay for 60 min without removal of the endogenous photoisomerized chromophore. Subsequent addition of exogenous all-trans-retinal at 1:1 ratio to opsin (Fig. 3A) produced a normal uptake signal, although an amount equimolar to opsin was already present in the membranes. The signal had the same amplitude as was measured with purified opsin without endogenous retinal (Fig. 2, trace a). A second illumination after addition of exogenous all-trans-retinal and incubation had no effect on opsin fluorescence. However, when the membranes were solublized with DM, a biphasic increase in fluorescence intensity was observed (Fig. 3A). The amplitude of the fast initial jump is comparable with the amplitude of the uptake signal, suggesting that the detergent causes dissociation of the complex between opsin and the exogenously added all-trans-retinal. Subsequently, the fluorescence increased to a high Trp emission intensity, which is typical for solubilized opsin (see Fig. 1). Consistently, the release signal from a solubilized light-activated rhodopsin sample was larger (data not shown). A large, biphasic uptake signal was observed when 11-cis-retinal was used instead of all-trans-retinal (Fig. 3B). These results are similar to the observation made for opsin depleted of endogenous chromophore (see Fig. 2, trace b). A second illumination evoked a small release signal. The addition of detergent increased the fluorescence to the same maximum level as was seen with the all-trans isomer. No significant uptake signals were observed upon addition of retinoids to dark-adapted rhodopsin membranes (data not shown). The observation of a normal uptake signal after Meta II decay demonstrates that there is a rapid complex formation between the exogenously added all-trans-retinal/11-cis-retinal and the decay product of Meta II. The retinal released in the course of Meta II decay does not diffuse freely. If this were the case, it would necessarily equilibrate, thus reducing or even canceling the uptake signal. Even if we assume that part of the released chromophore bound to binding sites other than on opsin, the same would apply to the exogenously provided chromophore. Consistently, all measured uptake signals (including that with empty apoprotein and with the Meta II decay product) had the same amplitude. Moreover, the absolute level of fluorescence intensity of purified empty opsin was similar to the Meta II decay product (i.e. opsin containing endogenous all-trans-retinal). These data argue for two independent binding sites for retinals on the opsin molecule (entrance and exit sites, see “Discussion”), in addition to the original binding pocket bearing the 11-cis-retinylidene/all-trans-retinylidene linkage. A similar protocol was employed with all-trans-retinol. The uptake signal was again observed both with decayed Meta II and isolated opsin apoprotein (Fig. 3C), demonstrating that all-trans-retinol quenches opsin fluorescence like the retinal isomers. The release signal of all-trans-retinal is also seen in the presence of NADPH (Fig. 3D). The amplitude of the signal is reduced due to the quenching effect of NADPH but is similar when normalized to initial fluorescence intensity (see Ref. 8Heck M. Schädel S.A. Maretzki D. Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3162-3169Google Scholar). This result suggests that all-trans-retinol enzymatically formed during Meta II decay, like endogenous all-trans-retinal, may not be entirely free to diffuse. Crystal Structure of Rhodopsin Offers Potential Binding Sites for Retinoids—In the crystal structure of rhodopsin, two heptane-1,2,3-triol (HTO) molecules were identified that bind to two hydrophobic cavities (Fig. 4a). One of them is located in a large cavity, which also easily accommodates 11-cis-retinal (311 Å3) and all-trans-retinal (309 Å3), close to the palmitoylation site within the transmembrane segment (termed site II). For the all-trans-retinal, the contact residues include Met317, Val318, and Leu321 of helix 8 around the polyene chain and Leu50, Ile54 (helix 1), Val304, and Met308 (helix 7) around the β-ionone ring (Fig. 4b). Cys322 and Leu328 of the C-terminal loop are close to the oxygen atom of retinal. Site II for the cis-retinoid consists of Phe52, Pro53, Phe56, Leu57, Gln64, and Tyr60 of helix 1. Thr 320 and Lys339 of the C-terminal loop are close to the oxygen atom of retinal. Leu321 divides the cis-from the trans-site and is covered by palmitoyl chains. It is plausible that these sites are occupied by detergent when membranes are solubilized, competing out the retinoid effects as demonstrated in the study. The second site is located on the cytoplasmic surface of rhodopsin (site III) (Fig. 4c). It encompasses Asn315, Cys316, Thr319 (helix 8), Lys325, Asn326, Leu328, and Gly329 (C-terminal loop) and residues around the β-ionone include Ala333, Thr336, Val337, Ser338, Glu341, and Thr342. The size of site II is large enough to accommodate all-trans-retinal and 11-cis-retinal individually or together (Fig. 4b), while the smaller site III can only bind one all-trans-retinal molecule (Fig. 4c). Site III is different from the HTO-binding site located in the main cavity on the rhodopsin cytoplasmic surface, which is more hydrophilic than site III. In agreement with the modeling, all-trans-retinal is likely to bind to the more hydrophobic cavity termed site III. Based on intrinsic opsin fluorescence data, we have analyzed the conversions linked to the uptake and release of retinoids by rhodopsin. We used preparations of isolated disc membranes, a simplified system devoid of the complex metabolic machinery of regeneration but providing the correct lipid host and thus a valid model to study retinoid release (8Heck M. Schädel S.A. Maretzki D. Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3162-3169Google Scholar) and uptake. The evidence presented in our studies shows that rhodopsin contains putative peripheral binding sites for retinoids in addition to the well known retinylidene pocket (site I in Fig. 4d). The data suggest a channeling of the retinal ligand through an entrance site (site II), the active site I, and an exit site (site III). Sites II and III are only functional in an undisturbed lipid environment in the absence of detergent, because binding of retinoids is based on hydrophobic interactions. During Decay of Meta II, all-trans-Retinal Is Released from the Active Site to an Exit Site—A release of the chromophore from the original binding site (site I) can be observed by an accompanying change in the intrinsic Trp fluorescence of the apoprotein (this study and Refs. 8Heck M. Schädel S.A. Maretzki D. Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3162-3169Google Scholar and 9Farrens D.L. Khorana H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5073-5076Google Scholar). According to current understanding, all-trans-retinal is released to the cytoplasm and then reduced to all-trans-retinol by a membrane-bound RDH (1McBee J.K. Palczewski K. Baehr W. Pepperberg D.R. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2001; 20: 469-529Google Scholar). A fraction of all-trans-retinal may escape into the intradiscal space, where it is removed to the cytoplasm by an ABCR transporter protein (reviewed in Refs. 1McBee J.K. Palczewski K. Baehr W. Pepperberg D.R. Prog. Retin. Eye Res. 2001; 20: 469-529Google Scholar and 29Sun H. Nathans J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2001; 33: 523-530Google Scholar). A first surprising result of the current analysis is that opsin, embedded in the lipid host of the membrane, does not release its photoisomerized chromophore into the bulk lipid phase. Instead, opsin keeps the chromophore bound in a site termed the “exit” site, preventing all-trans-retinal to diffuse freely. Endogenous all-trans-retinal does not migrate to the entrance site and does not cancel the release signal, while exogenously added retinoids bind to the entrance site, suppressing Trp fluorescence. Moreover, the persistent occupation of the exit site by endogenous all-trans-retinal is not merely due to a higher affinity of the exit site compared with the entrance site. If this were the case, exogenously added retinoid (1:1 ratio of retinoid to opsin) would preferentially bind to the exit site, thus not causing a quenching of fluorescence. The data in Fig. 3 show that after completion of the release signal, the binding signal is the same as with opsin, i.e. with empty active and release sites (Fig. 2). We conclude that the exit site remains closed for added retinoids, and then filling of the entrance site does not require emptying of the exit site. Reduction of all-trans-Retinal Can Occur in the Exit Site— Although all-trans-retinol evokes an uptake signal when exogenously added, release signal of all-trans-retinal in the presence of NADPH and subsequent uptake signal of exogenous retinol were again of the same size (Fig. 3, C and D). This indicates that during Meta II decay and subsequent enzymatic reduction, neither all-trans-retinal nor -retinol became free (see above). We may infer that, at least under the experimental conditions, even all-trans-retinol remained bound to the exit site. This would in turn allow the conclusion that reduction involves opsin·RDH complex formation. Although we have not yet attempted to study the complex with arrestin, reduction of the opsin-bound photoisomerized chromophore would open the possibility that both arrestin and RDH bind. This observation would explain why arrestin does not inhibit the visual cycle in vivo (30Palczewski K. Van Hooser J.P. Garwin G.G. Chen J. Liou G.I. Saari J.C. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12012-12019Google Scholar). Retinoids Are Taken Up into an Entrance Site—The release of all-trans-retinal and also the uptake of retinoids accompany a change in intrinsic protein fluorescence. The quench effect upon uptake is observed in native disc membranes, but not in the presence of detergent (Fig. 1). The uptake signal is observed with both all-trans-retinal and 11-cis-retinal when they are added to opsin devoid of any endogenous retinoid (Figs. 1 and 2) or after the decay of Meta II (Fig. 3). For a 1:1 ratio of retinal to opsin, the signal is of approximately the same size as the release signal. An obvious explanation would be that the added retinal re-fills the active site during Schiff base formation. However, this cannot be the case because the fluorescence change is 20 times faster than rhodopsin regeneration. The kinetics indicate a separate complex formation step, different from the formation of ground state rhodopsin. This would still leave open the possibility that the retinoids enter the active site and form a non-covalent association inside the pocket (site I). In such a model, an assumption would be that in a subsequent slower reaction, 11- or 9-cis-retinal would form the Schiff base from this pre-bound state. However, excess of all-trans-retinal or all-trans-retinol do not inhibit formation of rhodopsin (14Sachs K. Maretzki D. Meyer C.K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6189-6194Google Scholar, 31Matsumoto H. Yoshizawa T. Vision Res. 1978; 18: 607-609Google Scholar, 32Daemen F.J. Nature. 1978; 276: 847-848Google Scholar). This observation excludes any significant occupation of the active site by all-trans-retinal during uptake into opsin and proves that, for all-trans-retinal, the uptake signal cannot be interpreted as an uptake into the active site. Consistent with these observations, all-trans-retinal and 13-cis-retinal, which do not regenerate rhodopsin because they do not fit the active site of opsin (33Jang G.F. Kuksa V. Filipek S. Bartl F. Ritter E. Gelb M.H. Hofmann K.P. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26148-26153Google Scholar), also evoke a detergent-sensitive uptake signal (Fig. 2). Because the uptake yielded a signal with the same amplitude and similarly fast kinetics, not only with all-trans-but also with 11-cis- and 9-cis-retinal, we infer that 11-cis-retinal also passes through an “entrance” site(s) before it migrates to the active site and forms the Schiff base. In the case of 11-cis-retinal, it is channeled to the active site, causing a transient activation of opsin (34Kefalov V.J. Crouch R.K. Cornwall M.C. Neuron. 2001; 29: 749-755Google Scholar) before the 11-cis-reinylidene linkage is formed. This reaction could be aided by two residues, Glu181 and Glu113, which may act as general bases. Ligand Channeling in Opsin—The scheme in Fig. 5A interprets the findings based on the notion that retinals are unidirectionally passed through the three sites identified above (ligand-channeling hypothesis). The reaction pathway starts with rhodopsin (activation state), in which 11-cis-retinal is covalently bound via a protonated Schiff base to the active site and the intrinsic Trp fluorescence is fully quenched. Light absorption leads through retinal isomerization to Meta II (active state). Despite the activating conversion, the net change in fluorescence between rhodopsin and Meta II is very small (8Heck M. Schädel S.A. Maretzki D. Bartl F.J. Ritter E. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3162-3169Google Scholar). A large change in Trp fluorescence (relief from fluorescence quenching) occurs in the subsequent Meta II decay. In parallel to Meta III (storage state) formation, exit and entrance sites are now set to function. Channeling all-trans-retinal into the exit site and opening the entrance for various retinoids generates a native form of opsin, the opsin (exit) state. In this state, the RDH enzyme has access to its all-trans-retinal substrate and can form all-trans-retinol with NADPH as a cofactor. The cycle is closed when fresh 11-cis-retinal binds to the entrance site, to form the opsin·11-cis-retinal complex (entrance state), which enables regeneration of rhodopsin. The driving force for retinal channeling is provided by the light reaction, which is also the link between the two ducts for cis- and trans-retinal, respectively (Fig. 5A), and secures the unidirectionality of the overall process. When fresh 11-cis-retinal binds to the entrance, the exit site can release all-trans-retinal or all-trans-retinol. In this condition, the all-trans species may also bind to the entrance site (of another opsin molecule) (14Sachs K. Maretzki D. Meyer C.K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6189-6194Google Scholar). The complex formed in vitro (Fig. 5B), for which an activity toward the G-protein (12Jäger S. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2901-2908Google Scholar, 14Sachs K. Maretzki D. Meyer C.K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6189-6194Google Scholar, 25Cohen G.B. Oprian D.D. Robinson P.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12592-12601Google Scholar) and rhodopsin kinase (35Buczylko J. Saari J.C. Crouch R.K. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20621-20630Google Scholar) has been demonstrated, may be identified with the state with all-trans-retinal in the entrance site. It is important to note that all-trans-retinal bound to the entrance site does not inhibit the regeneration of rhodopsin (14Sachs K. Maretzki D. Meyer C.K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6189-6194Google Scholar). In agreement with the modeling (see below), this implies a more complex structure of the entrance domain, with a site to which all-trans-retinal can bind without inhibition of the duct for 11-cis-retinal permeation. A consequence of the above reaction scheme is that empty opsin is unlikely to exist in situ. Only harsh treatment in vitro, e.g. by washing with bovine serum albumin or treatment with hydroxylamine, can fully strip the exit site. Finally, it must be recognized that all-trans-retinal added in excess forms both covalent and non-covalent complexes with opsin as documented in previous studies (11Hofmann K.P. Pulvermüller A. Buczylko J. Van Hooser P. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15701-15706Google Scholar, 12Jäger S. Palczewski K. Hofmann K.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2901-2908Google Scholar). Assignment of Ligand Channeling to Rhodopsin Structure— The ligand channeling found in this study is reminiscent of the tunneling of substrate found in some hydrophobic ligand-binding proteins, such as phosphatidyl-transfer protein (36Roderick S.L. Chan W.W. Agate D.S. Olsen L.R. Vetting M.W. Rajashankar K.R. Cohen D.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 507-511Google Scholar). Most likely, the selectivity comes about through a specific opsin conformation that arises when all-trans-retinal is released from the active site. This conformational change is a late consequence of photon absorption and cannot be induced once opsin is stripped of endogenous all-trans-retinal and collapsed to a new conformation. Such a transformation would allow unidirectional uptake and release of the chromophore. In a previous investigation of the opsin·all-trans-retinal complex (14Sachs K. Maretzki D. Meyer C.K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6189-6194Google Scholar), we had found that all-trans-retinal-induced opsin activity toward the G-protein depended on palmitoylation of Cys322 and Cys323. When combining this with the present results, one would identify site II as the entrance, and would suggest site III as the exit. In native opsin, only 11-cis-retinal can pass the tunnel to the active site I. Only for certain mutants, including E113Q (37Sakmar T.P. Franke R.R. Khorana H.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8309-8313Google Scholar), the all-trans isomer has access to site I. According to modeling, either all-trans- or 11-cis-retinal can bind to site II in rhodopsin, but it would take opsin to allow all-trans- or 11-cis-retinal to induce the conformational change seen in the fluorescence uptake signal. The detailed mechanism by which the conformational change translates into a fluorescence change remains to be elucidated. There is a large distance between the entrance site and Trp265, which resides in site I and is the interaction partner of the β-ionone in the dark state. Therefore, we must envisage an indirect mechanism for the quenching related to retinal uptake. There is an additional change in fluorescence when 11-cis-retinal passes from the entrance to the active site. 11-cis-retinal may reorient itself during Schiff base formation, thus tightly immobilizing Trp265 (38Saam J. Tajkhorshid E. Hayashi S. Schulten K. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 3097-3112Google Scholar). Using intrinsic Trp fluorescence, we analyzed how a ligand finds its way through a native receptor protein. The ligand (11-cis-/all-trans-retinal) is passed over through rhodopsin from entrance to active to exit sites. Although these sites can already be assigned to the structure of the inactive ground state, the structure of the tunnel, which allows the ligand to pass, is not known. The data indicate that after the passage, the ligand remains bound to the putative exit site (site III). In this way, reduction to retinol can occur through the action of a retinol-binding protein, RDH. Although these results could be specific to the visual system, the mechanism may be more universal for the large family of G-protein-coupled receptors."

There is strong evidence that GABAA receptor endocytosis is clathrin-dependent; however, this process is not well understood. Here we demonstrate that in HEK 293 cells, endocytosis of GABAA receptors composed of either α1β2γ2Lor α1β2 subunits is blocked by the dominant negative dynamin construct K44A. Furthermore, we identify a dileucine AP2 adaptin-binding motif within the receptor β2 subunit that is critical for endocytosis. Internalization of GABAA receptors lacking this motif is dramatically inhibited, and the receptors appear to accumulate on the cell surface. Patch clamp analysis of receptors lacking the dileucine motif show that there is an increase in the peak amplitude of GABA-gated chloride currents compared with wild-type receptors. Additionally, GABA-gated chloride currents in HEK 293 cells expressing wild-type receptors are increased by introduction of a peptide corresponding to the dileucine motif region of the receptor β2 subunit but not by a control peptide containing alanine substitutions for the dileucine motif. In mouse brain cerebral cortical neurons, the dileucine motif peptide increases GABA-gated chloride currents of native GABAA receptors.

The GABAA receptor is a ligand-gated chloride channel that, upon activation by GABA 1The abbreviations used are: GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; FBS, fetal bovine serum. 1The abbreviations used are: GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; FBS, fetal bovine serum. (γ-aminobutyric acid), mediates increases in chloride conductance resulting in membrane hyperpolarization and neuronal inhibition (1Whiting P. Bonnert T.P. McKernan R.M. Farrar S. LeBourdelles B.

The role of these receptors in hyperexcitability states, such as epilepsy and anxiety, is widely recognized. Importantly, GABAA receptors mediate the effects of benzodiazepines and barbiturates, two frequently prescribed classes of therapeutic agents. The GABAA receptor is a pentameric receptor composed of multiple subunits, each containing four membrane-spanning regions (M1-M4) with a large intracellular loop between M3 and M4. A number of subunits exist (α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3, δ, θ, ϵ, π), and receptors composed of α1β2γ2L subunits are believed to represent the predominant GABAA receptor subtype in the brain (1Whiting P. Bonnert T.P. McKernan R.M. Farrar S. LeBourdelles B. Heavens R.P. Smith D.W. Hewson L. Rigby M.R. Sirinrthsinghji D.J.S. Thompson S.A. Wafford K.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 868: 645-653Google Scholar).Receptor endocytosis is known to regulate the cell surface expression of neurotransmitter receptors, and such regulation is an important mechanism for controlling the synaptic efficacy of neurotransmitters (2Carroll R. Beattie E. von Zastrow M. Malenka R. Nature. 2001; 2: 315-324Google Scholar). Although GABAA receptors undergo endocytosis, the mechanism is not well understood. Several lines of evidence indicate that GABAA receptor endocytosis may be clathrin/dynamin-dependent. These include the presence of GABAA receptors in clathrin-coated vesicles isolated from brain (3Tehrani M.H.J. Barnes Jr., E.M. J. Neurochem. 1993; 60: 1755-1761Google Scholar), the colocalization of the receptor with transferrin receptors (4Connolly C.N. Kittler J.T. Thomas P. Uren J.M. Brandon N.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36565-36572Google Scholar), and the colocalization and co-immunoprecipitation of hippocampal GABAA receptors with the clathrin adaptor complex AP2 adaptin (5Kittler J.T. Delmas P. Jovanovic J.N. Brown D.A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7972-7977Google Scholar). Additionally, peptides that disrupt dynamin-amphiphysin interactions increase GABA inhibitory post-synaptic current amplitudes in hippocampal neurons (5Kittler J.T. Delmas P. Jovanovic J.N. Brown D.A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7972-7977Google Scholar). Direct examination of GABAA receptor endocytosis in HEK 293 cells has revealed that receptor endocytosis is blocked by hypertonic sucrose (5Kittler J.T. Delmas P. Jovanovic J.N. Brown D.A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7972-7977Google Scholar), a treatment known to inhibit, but is not specific for, clathrin-dependent endocytosis (6Walker J.K. Premont R.T. Barak L.S. Caron M.G.

Unexpectedly, a recent study (8Cinar H. Barnes Jr., E.M. Biochem. 2001; 40: 14030-14036Google Scholar) has demonstrated that although constitutive GABAA receptor endocytosis in HEK 293 cells is blocked by hypertonic sucrose, it is not blocked by the dynamin dominant negative mutant K44A, indicating that GABAA receptors are endocytosed via a clathrin-independent mechanism. Thus, the pathway(s) by which GABAA receptors are endocytosed are not well characterized. Furthermore, the domains on the receptor that are involved in the endocytic process have not been identified. In the present study, we sought to clarify the mechanism by which GABAA receptors are endocytosed and identify the receptor domains involved.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals and MaterialsTimed-pregnant C57Bl/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories) were housed in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care approved facility (University of North Texas Health Sciences Center). The mice were kept on a 12 h light/dark cycle and fed standard laboratory rodent chow. Cortical slices were prepared in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. HEK 293 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Human GABAA receptor cDNAs (9Farrar S. Whiting P.J. Bonnert T.P. McKernan R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10100-10104Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Dr. Paul Whiting (Merck, Sharp, and Dohme Research Laboratories, Essex, UK). Dynamin and dynamin K44A cDNAs were gifts from Dr. Sandra Schmid (The Scripps Research Institute). The following antibodies were used: Texas Red and Alexa 488-conjugated secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), mouse monoclonal 9E10 anti-myc antibody (BD Biosciences), and mouse polyclonal anti-myc 9E10 ascites fluid (gift from Dr. Kelly Tatchell, LSU Health Science Center, Shreveport, LA).Construction of Receptor MutantsTo mutate the tyrosine and/or dileucine AP2 adaptin-binding motifs within the GABAA receptor β2 subunit, site-specific mutations were introduced using the Stratagene QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to kit instructions. Oligonucleotides were synthesized (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA) that contained the desired mutation and at least 15 bases of homology to the wild-type cDNA. The mutants and their respective PCR primers were: (myc)-β2(Y304F), 5′-CCCTAGTCAAACGCCATCTTCTTTGG-3′ and 5′-GGGATCAGTTGCGGTAGAAGAAACC-3′ and (myc)-β2(L343A/L344A), 5′-CCATGAGAACAT CGCAGCGAGCACTCTCGAG-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGAGTGCTCGCTGCGATGTTCTCATGG-3′. Colonies were screened by sequencing using the Sequenase 2.0 kit (US Biochemical, Cleveland, OH) with [35S]dATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Mutated subunits were sequenced in their entirety (Arizona State University sequencing facility). The dileucine (ENILLSSTLEI) and control dialanine (ENIAASSTLEI) peptides used for the electrophysiology experiments were synthesized by Genemed Synthesis, Inc. (San Francisco, CA).HEK 293 Cell Culture and TransfectionTo plate HEK 293 cells, cells were trypsinized (0.05%), triturated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 containing 10% FBS media, pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 10 ml of media, and diluted to ∼200,000 cells per 0.5 ml. 35-mm poly-l-lysine-coated glass bottom insert dishes (MatTek Corp., Ashland, MA) were seeded at ∼1 × 105 cells in a volume of 2 ml/dish. Dishes were incubated overnight at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2/95% air. Cells were then transfected with 0.6 μg of plasmid DNA using the calcium phosphate method and placed in a 3% CO2 incubator for 17 h. Cells were then washed twice, the media changed and cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2/95% air for ∼42 h before use. To avoid problems associated with the expression of high amounts of recombinant protein, we used a transfection protocol that resulted in 15–25% transfection efficiency.ImmunofluorescenceReceptor Endocytosis Protocol—Living HEK 293 cells expressing recombinant GABAA receptors were incubated on ice in 100 μl of HEPES buffer (25 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2,15mm glucose, pH 7.4) containing 5 μg/ml mouse monoclonal 9E10 anti-myc antibody for 1 h, followed by a 1 h incubation on ice with 1 ml of buffer containing a Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:500) to label cell surface receptors. Cells were then incubated for 20 min at 37 °C to allow receptor endocytosis. To identify the Texas Red-labeled receptors that were not internalized during this 20 min period, cells were incubated for 1 h on ice in 1 ml of buffer containing an Alexa 488-conjugated rabbit anti-goat antibody (1:1000). Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and visualized by confocal microscopy. For these experiments, colocalized Texas Red and Alexa 488 labeling represents those Texas Red-labeled receptors that remained on the cell surface during the 37 °C incubation, whereas Texas Red labeling not colocalized with Alexa 488 represents receptors that were endocytosed during the 37 °C incubation period. The immunolabeling of myc-tagged GABAA receptors in living HEK 293 cells has been used previously to study GABAA receptor endocytosis (4Connolly C.N. Kittler J.T. Thomas P. Uren J.M. Brandon N.J.

Gibson A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 259-271Google Scholar).Receptor Cell Surface Labeling Protocol—For the cell surface expression experiments, HEK 293 cells expressing GABAA receptors were incubated with mouse anti-myc 9E10 containing ascities (1:1000) for 1 h on ice followed by a 1 h incubation on ice with a Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:500). Cells were rinsed and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and visualized by confocal microscopy. For these experiments, at least three independent experiments were performed, where independent experiments are defined as experiments performed on different batches of HEK 293 cells transfected at different times. For each independent experiment at least three cells were quantified and averaged to yield one “n.” The data from each independent experiment were then averaged.Confocal MicroscopyA Bio-Rad MRC-1024 laser scanning system with an argon/krypton laser (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) was used for fluorescence microscopy. The excitation wavelengths and emission filters used for Alexa 488 and Texas Red were 488 nm, 522/30 and 568 nm, 605/32, respectively. A 60× objective was used to collect images. Laser intensity, photo-multiplier gain, and iris were optimized for each set of experiments and held constant throughout. Images were captured using LaserSharp MRC-1024 software and processed using Adobe Photoshop software.Tissue CultureOrganotypic explants were derived from ∼360 μm thick, hemi-coronal slices of postnatal day (P) 2 (day of birth = P1) frontal and cingulate cerebral cortex, obtained from both male and female pups born of timed-pregnant C57Bl/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories) as previously described (11Singh M. Setalo G. Guan X. Frail D.E. Toran-Allerand C.D. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1694-1700Google Scholar). Explant slices were maintained as roller tube cultures (12Gahwiler B. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1981; 4: 329-342Google Scholar) on rat tail collagen-coated/poly-d-lysine pre-coated glass coverslips and grown in steroid-deficient and phenol red-free maintenance medium (gelding serum (25%); Hank's buffered saline solution (22.5%); minimum Eagle's medium 50%); glucose (7.5 mg/ml); l-glutamine (2 mm); ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml)). Cultures were maintained in vitro for 3 days prior to experimentation.ElectrophysiologyThe conventional whole cell configuration of the patch clamp technique was used to study GABA-gated currents in transiently transfected HEK 293 cells or organotypic explants (13Huang R.Q. Dillon G.H. J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1998; 286: 243-255Google Scholar). The pipette solution contained (in mm): 140 CsCl, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 4 Mg-ATP, pH 7.2. Coverslips containing HEK 293 cells were placed in a small chamber (∼1.5 ml) on the stage of an inverted light microscope (Olympus IMT-2) and superfused continuously (5–8 ml/min) with the following external solution containing (in mm): 125 NaCl, 5.5 KCl, 1.5 CaCl2, 0.8 MgCl2,20 HEPES-Na, 10 glucose, pH 7.3. Neurons from explant slices were recorded in synaptic blockade medium ((in mm): 128 NaCl, 3.0 KCl, 11.4 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 2.0 CaCl2, 10 glucose, 300 mOsm, pH 7.3) to minimize presynaptic inputs using an upright microscope (Nikon Optiphot 2-UD) fitted with Hoffman modulation contrast optics. All recordings were obtained at 35 °C, with cells voltage-clamped at –60 mV. GABA was prepared in the extracellular solution and was applied to cells from independent reservoirs using a Y-shaped tube positioned within 100 μm of the cell.RESULTSTo examine constitutive endocytosis of GABAA receptors, HEK 293 cells expressing recombinant receptors composed of α1(myc)-β2γ2L subunits were labeled as described under “Experimental Procedures.” An endocytosis time course is shown in Fig. 1A. At time zero (ice, no time at 37 °C), the receptor does not undergo endocytosis and remains on the cell surface (represented by the colocalization of Texas Red and Alexa 488 signals). At times subsequent to 0 min, the receptor is constitutively endocytosed, as is evident by the punctate Texas Red signal within cells. By 40 min, most, if not all, of the receptors had been endocytosed (little to no yellow signal remaining). Because the receptor is thought to be recycled back to the cell surface following endocytosis (8Cinar H. Barnes Jr., E.M. Biochem. 2001; 40: 14030-14036Google Scholar), the time course of endocytosis was followed to 60 min. If internalized receptor was returned to the surface during this period, yellow signal should reappear; however, no reappearance of the yellow signal was detected at 60 min. It is also possible that Texas Red-conjugated antibody dissociated from the receptor following endocytosis and that unlabeled receptors were then recycled back to the surface. Such events, however, would not contribute to our measurements because these receptors would not be labeled with the Alexa 488-conjugated antibody. Thus, our experimental protocol provides a measurement of receptor endocytosis without complications due to receptor recycling.To determine whether constitutive receptor endocytosis is dynamin-dependent, receptors composed of α1(myc)-β2γ2L subunits were co-expressed with dynamin constructs (Fig. 1B, top panels). Co-expression of the dominant negative dynamin mutant K44A, but not of wild-type dynamin, inhibited receptor endocytosis. Quantitative data for this experiment are shown in Fig. 2A. Similar results were obtained when untagged receptors were detected using a mouse monoclonal anti-β2/3 subunit antibody (data not shown).Fig. 2Constitutive endocytosis of GABAA receptors in living HEK 293 cells is blocked by the dominant negative dynamin mutant K44A. Replicate data for experiments in Fig. 1, B and C above. Endocytosis of GABAA receptors composed of either α1(myc)-β2γ2L (panel A) or α1(myc)-β2 (panel B) subunits was significantly inhibited by co-expression of dynamin K44A but not by wild-type dynamin (*, p ≤ 0.01; unpaired t test, n = 3 for each condition).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Because it was suggested that clathrin-dependent endocytosis of the receptor requires the presence of the γ2 subunit (10Connolly C.N. Uren J.M. Thomas P. Gorrie G.H. Gibson A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 259-271Google Scholar), endocytosis of receptors composed of only α1(myc)-β2 subunits was examined (Fig. 1B, bottom left panel). Similar to receptors composed of α1(myc)-β2γ2L subunits, receptors lacking the γ2L subunit were also internalized, indicating that the γ2L subunit is not required for endocytosis. Furthermore, the endocytosis of receptors lacking the γ2L subunit was inhibited by overexpression of dynamin K44A but not wild-type dynamin (Fig. 1B, bottom, middle, and right panels). Quantitative data are shown in Fig. 2B. Similar results were observed using a mouse anti-β2/3 subunit antibody to detect untagged receptors (data not shown).For the clathrin-dependent endocytic pathway, cargo proteins are recruited to clathrin-coated pits by AP2 adaptin complexes that recognize dileucine and tyrosine motifs within target proteins (14LeBorgne R.L. Hoflack B. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 499-503Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic loop region of the receptor β2 subunit contains both dileucine (LL at 343,344) and tyrosine YXXθ (YIFF, 304–307) AP2-adaptin-binding motifs (Fig. 3), where θ = a large hydrophobic amino acid. To investigate whether these motifs play a role in constitutive receptor endocytosis, the dileucine and tyrosine motifs were mutated individually and together. For these experiments the leucines at residues 343 and 344 were mutated to alanines and the tyrosine at position 304 was mutated to a phenylalanine. Endocytosis of the mutant proteins was then examined in HEK 293 cells expressing receptors composed of α1(myc)-β2γ2L, α1(myc)-β2(L343A/L344A;Y304F)γ2L, α1(myc)-β2(L343A/L344A)γ2L or α1(myc)-β2(Y304F)γ2L subunits (Figs. 4 and 5). Constitutive endocytosis was observed for both wild-type receptors and receptors composed of α1(myc)-β2(Y304F)γ2L subunits. Therefore, the tyrosine motif is not required for this process. In contrast, the endocytosis of receptors lacking the dileucine motif, i.e. those composed of α1(myc)-β2(L343A/L344A;Y304F)γ2L or α1(myc)-β2(L343A/L344A)γ2L subunits, was greatly inhibited, indicating that the dileucine motif is critical for this process. Because it was possible that mutation of the dileucine motif resulted in a gross disruption of receptor structure, we performed patch clamp studies to test the functional integrity of the receptors containing the mutant subunit. As shown in Fig. 6, GABA-gated chloride currents were observed in cells expressing α1(myc)-β2(L343A/L344A)γ2L subunits. Furthermore, the receptors were potentiated by diazepam, indicating that the γ2L subunit had been incorporated into the receptor (15Pritchett D.B. Sontheimer H. Shivers B.H. Nature. 1989; 338: 582-585Google Scholar). In these experiments, in the presence of 1 μm diazepam, GABA-gated chloride currents were 174 ± 18% (n = 9) and 164 ± 9.3% (n = 12) of the GABA control response for wild-type and mutant (α1(myc)-β2(L343A/L344A)γ2L) receptors, respectively.Fig. 3Diagram showing the locations of the dileucine and tyrosine-based AP2 adaptin-binding motifs on the GABAA receptor β2 subunit. •, tyrosine motif YIFF at 304–307; ▪, dileucine motif LL at 343, 344.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 4Mutation of the dileucine AP2 adaptin-binding motif on the GABAA receptor β2 subunit inhibits receptor endocytosis and increases cell surface expression.A, living HEK 293 cells co-expressing α1(myc)-β2γ2L, α1(myc)-β2(L343A/L344A;Y304F)γ2L, α1-(myc)-β2(L343A/L344A)γ2L, or α1(myc)-β2(Y304F)γ2L were labeled by indirect immunofluorescence using the receptor endocytosis protocol and visualized by confocal microscopy.

Whole cell patch clamp recordings were recorded in the presence of GABA (10 μm) or GABA (10 μm) + diazepam (1 μm). Both wild-type and mutant receptors were responsive to GABA and potentiated by diazepam.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Because the endocytosis of receptors lacking the dileucine motif on the β2 subunit was inhibited, we expected that the receptor would accumulate at the cell surface. As shown in Fig. 4B, there was an increase in the level of surface immunolabeling of cells expressing the mutant receptor. Consistent with the immunolabeling results, the maximal current of GABA-gated chloride currents activated by 1 mm GABA in cells expressing receptors containing the β2 subunit dileucine motif mutant was nearly twice that observed for wild-type (7145 ± 473 pA in mutant receptors, n = 5 versus 3735 ± 357 pA for wild-type receptors, n = 13, unpaired t test, p ≤ 0.01).Because it was possible that mutation of the receptor dileucine motif affected receptor endocytosis/function in a manner that was unrelated to specific endocytic mechanisms, we performed competition experiments using a 10 amino acid peptide that corresponds to the dileucine motif region of the receptor β2 subunit. Presumably, if the dileucine region of the β subunit is a binding partner for AP2 adaptin, the peptide should compete with receptor for AP2 binding and thus prevent receptor endocytosis. Using the patch clamp technique, GABA-gated chloride currents were recorded with pipettes containing either a control dialanine peptide (identical to the dileucine peptide except that alanines were substituted for leucines) or the dileucine peptide (peptide sequences specified under “Experimental Procedures”). Recordings made in the presence of the control peptide showed a stable GABA response peak current amplitude during the 25 min recording period (Fig. 7). Experiments conducted with the dileucine peptide showed an approximate 44% increase in GABA-gated chloride currents when compared with control recordings at 25 min. By 10 min, significant increases in GABA responses were noted.Fig. 7GABA-gated chloride currents in HEK 293 cells are increased by a peptide that corresponds to the dileucine motif region of the receptor β2 subunit.A, whole cell patch clamp recordings were obtained from HEK 293 cells expressing GABAA receptors composed of α1(myc)-β2γ2L subunits. Pipette solution included either a control dialanine peptide (50 μm, top traces) or a peptide corresponding to the dileucine motif region of the receptor β2 subunit (dileucine peptide, 50 μm, bottom traces). Current amplitude in response to GABA (10 μm) remained stable over time with intracellular dialysis of the control dialanine peptide, but increased significantly when the cell was dialyzed with the dileucine peptide.

Similar to the experiments in HEK 293 cells, in the presence of the dileucine peptide there was a significant increase in GABA-gated chloride currents that was evident beginning at 10 min (Fig. 8). At 30 min, there was an ∼60% increase in GABA responses in cell exposed to the dileucine peptide relative to control recordings.Fig. 8GABA-gated chloride currents of cerebral cortical neurons are increased by a peptide that corresponds to the dileucine motif region of the receptor β2 subunit. Experiments are similar to those described in Fig. 6. A, whole cell patch clamp recordings were obtained from GABAA receptors of cortical neuronal slices.

B, mean results from experiments on cortical GABAA receptors. Average current amplitudes between the two groups were significantly different at 10 min and remained so throughout the recording period. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; n = 5–7 at each time point for each group.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Our results are inconsistent with the dynamin-independent endocytosis of chicken GABAA receptors that was recently reported (8Cinar H. Barnes Jr., E.M. Biochem. 2001; 40: 14030-14036Google Scholar). It is possible that species differences could account for the discrepancy between our results and those of Cinar and Barnes (8Cinar H.

Chinchetru M.A. Darlison M.G. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 10-16Google Scholar). One difference between our protocol and that of Cinar and Barnes (8Cinar H. Barnes Jr., E.M. Biochem. 2001; 40: 14030-14036Google Scholar) is that their experiments were performed in the presence of FBS. To determine whether this methodological difference could underlie our disparate findings, we repeated our endocytosis assays in the presence of FBS. In the presence of FBS, co-expression of dynamin K44A failed to block GABAA receptor endocytosis (Figs. 9A and 10). Furthermore, GABAA receptors that lacked the dileucine AP2 adaptin-binding motif on the β2 subunit were internalized in the presence of FBS (Fig. 9B). Finally, using the “cell surface labeling” protocol, few GABAA receptors were detected on the surface of cells treated with FBS (data not shown).Fig. 9Fetal bovine serum promotes dynamin-independent, dileucine motif-independent GABAA receptor endocytosis.A, living HEK 293 cells co-expressing α1(myc)-β2γ2L subunits, α1(myc)-β2γ2L + dynamin or α1(myc)-β2γ2L + dynamin K44A were labeled by indirect immunofluorescence as described under “Experimental Procedures” by the receptor endocytosis protocol, except that 10%"
https://openalex.org/W1981749500,"ATP2C1, encoding the human secretory pathway Ca2+/Mn2+ ATPase (hSPCA1), was recently identified as the defective gene in Hailey-Hailey Disease (HHD), an autosomal dominant skin disorder characterized by persistent blisters and erosions. To investigate the underlying cause of HHD, we have analyzed the changes in expression level and function of hSPCA1 caused by mutations found in HHD patients. Mutations were introduced into hSPCA1d, a novel splice variant expressed in keratinocytes, described here for the first time. Encoded by the full-length of optional exons 27 and 28, hSPCA1d was longer than previously identified splice variants. The protein competitively transported Ca2+ and Mn2+ with equally high affinity into the Golgi of COS-1 cells. Ca2+- and Mn2+-dependent phosphoenzyme intermediate formation in forward (ATP-fuelled) and reverse (Pi-fuelled) directions was also demonstrated. HHD mutant proteins L341P, C344Y, C411R, T570I, and G789R showed low levels of expression, despite normal levels of mRNA and correct targeting to the Golgi, suggesting instability or abnormal folding of the mutated hSPCA1 polypeptides. P201L had little effect on the enzymatic cycle, whereas I580V caused a block in the E1∼P → E2-P conformational transition. D742Y and G309C were devoid of Ca2+- and Mn2+-dependent phosphoenzyme formation from ATP. The capacity to phosphorylate from Pi was retained in these mutants but with a loss of sensitivity to both Ca2+ and Mn2+ in D742Y and a preferential loss of sensitivity to Mn2+ in G309C. These results highlight the crucial role played by Asp-742 in the architecture of the hSPCA1 ion-binding site and reveal a role for Gly-309 in Mn2+ transport selectivity.

These results highlight the crucial role played by Asp-742 in the architecture of the hSPCA1 ion-binding site and reveal a role for Gly-309 in Mn2+ transport selectivity. At present, three distinct classes of phosphorylation-type Ca2+ transport ATPases have been identified in mammalian cells: plasma membrane (PMCA), 1The abbreviations used are: PMCA, plasma membrane calcium adenosine triphosphatase; (h)SPCA1, (human) secretory pathway Ca2+/Mn2+-adenosine triphosphatase; HHD, Hailey-Hailey disease; SERCA, sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium adenosine triphosphatase; PMR, plasma membrane ATPase-related; cDNA, complementary DNA; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; GSP, gene-specific primers; nt, nucleotide(s); D, donor; Bis-Tris, 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum (SERCA), and Golgi-associated secretory pathway (SPCA) Ca2+ transport ATPases. These proteins serve to actively pump Ca2+ out of the cytoplasm, thus contributing to the maintenance of a low cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in resting conditions (reviewed in Ref. 1Møller J.V. Juul B. le Maire M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 1-51Google Scholar). Relatively little is known about the SPCA class. ATP2C1, the gene encoding the human secretory pathway Ca2+/Mn2+-ATPase (hSPCA1), was recently identified as the defective gene in Hailey-Hailey disease (HHD, OMIM 16960), an autosomal-dominant skin disorder characterized by abnormal keratinocyte adhesion in the suprabasal layer of the epidermis (2Sudbrak R. Brown J. Dobson-Stone C. Carter S. Ramser J. White J. Healy E. Dissanayake M. Larrègue M. Perrussel M. Lehrach H. Munro C.S. Strachan T. Burge S. Hovnanian A. Monaco A.P. Hum. Mol.

Sequence analysis suggests that the protein retains the remarkable conservation in structure and function that exists across the Ca2+-ATPase class and that, like PMCA, the SPCA class possesses only one of the two high affinity Ca2+-binding sites present in SERCA. Most of our knowledge of the SPCA class comes from studies of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae homologue, named somewhat confusingly PMR1 for plasma membrane ATPase-related, which shares 49% amino acid identity with hSPCA1. Following the initial identification of PMR1 as a probable Ca2+-ATPase (4Rudolf H.K. Antebi A. Fink G.R. Buckley C.M. Dorman T.E. LeVitre J. Davidow L.S. Mao J. Moir D.T. Cell. 1989; 58: 133-145Google Scholar), the protein was localized to the Golgi or one of its subcompartments (5Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Google Scholar). Studies of null strains defective in PMR1 illustrated a pleiotropic effect on Golgi function, including impaired proteolytic processing, incomplete glycosylation, and defective pre-, post-, and intra-Golgi translocation of secreted proteins (5Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Google Scholar). These defects resulted in defective cell wall morphogenesis, which is interestingly reminiscent of abnormal keratinocyte adhesion in HHD. Moreover, in yeast these phenotypes could be reversed by addition of Ca2+ (10 μm) to the medium, implicating a direct role for Ca2+ in Golgi function (5Antebi A. Fink G.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 633-654Google Scholar). Evidence suggests that PMR1 can also transport Mn2+ (6Lapinskas P.J. Cunningham K.W. Lui X.F. Fink G.R. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1382-1388Google Scholar). Although being an essential cofactor for a wide range of enzymes (7Dürr G. Strayle J. Plemper R. Elbs S. Klee S.K. Catty P. Wolf D.H. Rudolf H.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1149-1162Google Scholar, 8Cottrell G.S. Hooper N.M. Turner A.J. Biochemistry (Mosc). 2000; 39: 15121-15128Google Scholar, 9Hearn A.S. Stroupe M.E. Cabelli D.E. Lepock J.R. Trainer J.A. Nick H.S. Silverman D.N. Biochemistry (Mosc). 2001; 40: 12051-12058Google Scholar), high concentrations of Mn2+ are toxic, interfering with Mg2+-binding sites on proteins and compromising the fidelity of DNA polymerases (10Beckman R.A. Mildvan A.S. Loeb L.A. Biochemistry (Mosc). 1985; 24: 5810-5817Google Scholar). PMR1-type pumps appear to be the principal route for Mn2+ detoxification, via the secretory pathway, and are important in maintaining both cytosolic and luminal Mn2+ homeostasis. The first functional study on SPCA in animals was conducted on Caenorhabditis elegans. C. elegans SPCA was shown to transport Ca2+ and Mn2+ with high affinity into the Golgi following heterologous expression in COS-1 cells (11Van Baelen K. Vanoevelen J. Missiaen L. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10683-10691Google Scholar). Overexpression of human SPCA1 in yeast and Chinese hamster ovary cells was restricted to the Golgi compartment and, moreover, was able to complement the PMR1 null mutation, as demonstrated by the ability to transport Ca2+ and Mn2+ in yeast (12Ton V.-K. Mandal D. Vahadji C. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 6422-6427Google Scholar). Key insights into structure/function relationships have been provided by functional analysis of over 250 point mutations in SERCA1a. This has led to identification of specific domains important in Ca2+ and ATP binding and phosphorylation, together with residues important in the conformational changes associated with the various stages of the catalytic cycle (13Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 101-106Google Scholar, 14MacLennan D.H. Rice W.J. Green N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28815-28818Google Scholar) (Scheme 1). In contrast, mutagenic studies of the SPCA class have been limited and have only involved the S. cerevisiae protein. Mutations in the active phosphorylation site, Asp-372, had the expected effect of abolishing Ca2+ transport activity (15Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Google Scholar). Residues in the putative N-terminal EF hand-like motif were reported to have a modulatory effect on ion transport, through their importance in ion binding and participation in long range interactions involved in ATP binding and phosphorylation (16Wei Y. Marchi V. Wang R. Rao R. Biochemistry (Mosc). 1999; 38: 14534-14541Google Scholar). Other reports have targeted the oxygen-containing side chains of the predicted transmembrane domains M4–M8, likely to be involved in the coordination of Ca2+ and Mn2+ ions (17Wei Y. Chen J. Rosas G. Tompkins D.A. Holt P.A. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23927-23932Google Scholar), and have defined Gln-783 as crucial in Mn2+ selectivity of PMR1 (18Mandal D. Woolf T.B. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23933-23938Google Scholar). We have previously described a spectrum of mutations scattered throughout the ATP2C1 gene in HHD patients (2Sudbrak R. Brown J. Dobson-Stone C. Carter S. Ramser J. White J. Healy E. Dissanayake M. Larrègue M. Perrussel M. Lehrach H. Munro C.S. Strachan T. Burge S. Hovnanian A. Monaco A.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1131-1140Google Scholar, 19Dobson-Stone C. Fairclough R. Dunne E. Brown J. Dissanayake M. Munro C.S. Strachan T. Burge S. Sudbrak R. Monaco A.P. Hovnanian A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 338-343Google Scholar). Although nonsense, frameshift, and splice-site mutations are predicted to cause nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (20Frischmeyer P.A. Dietz H.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 1893-1900Google Scholar) or aberrant splicing, the underlying cause of disease in patients carrying missense mutations cannot be predicted a priori. In this study we investigated the molecular and physiological basis of HHD in patients carrying these mutations, providing new insights into SPCA structure/function relationships. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce these disease-causing point mutations into the cDNA sequence of a novel splice variant of hSPCA1, which was identified and functionally characterized in this study. More than 50% of the mutants studied here showed low levels of protein expression, despite normal levels of mRNA and correct localization to the Golgi compartment. Other mutants are characterized by lack of ion transport, caused by specific alterations to the partial reactions of the catalytic cycle, such as defects in Ca2+ and Mn2+ binding and inability of the phosphoenzyme intermediate to undergo the energy-transducing E1∼P → E2-P conformational transition. Materials—Radiochemicals and chemicals were obtained from Amersham Biosciences (UK), PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Boston, MA), and Sigma (Dorset, UK). DNA sequencing was performed using the ABI Prism 377 sequencer and the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (PE-Applied Biosystems, Cheshire, UK). Unless otherwise stated, PCR was carried out using the Expand™ Long Template PCR system (Roche Applied Science, E. Sussex, UK). Anti-mouse/rabbit alkaline phosphate-conjugated secondary antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences. Sheep anti-TGN46 was purchased from Serotec (Oxford, UK); fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies (donkey anti-sheep, goat anti-rabbit) were from Molecular Probes (Leiden, The Netherlands). Free ion concentrations were calculated using the CaBuf program (available at ftp.cc.kuleuven.ac.be/pub/droogmans/cabuf.zip) based on the stability constants for oxalate, EGTA, and ATP, as described before (11Van Baelen K. Vanoevelen J. Missiaen L. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10683-10691Google Scholar). Reverse Transcriptase-PCR Analyses—Following extraction of total RNA from human keratinocytes with TRIzol (Invitrogen), both reverse transcription of ATP2C1 and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR, were performed using the Marathon™ cDNA amplification kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The gene-specific primer, ATP2C13′GSP (5′-CCAAGTCTGTGTTTGAGATTGGACTCTGC-3′), corresponded to nucleotides (nt) 2618–2646 in the ATP2C1d sequence. Products were subcloned into the PCR-cloning vector pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI) and sequenced in both directions. Splice variants identified by sequencing were subsequently amplified by PCR using ATP2C13′GSP and antisense primers Ex27R (5′-TTGCCCTTCTAAATGATCCTC-3′) or Ex28R (5′-GGAAGAGCTGCAGGAAGATG-3′) in standard reaction conditions. Ex27R and Ex28R, respectively, represent the inverse complement of nt 3039–3059 and 3048–3067 in the ATP2C1a and ATP2C1d sequences. PCR conditions were as follows: 4 min of denaturation at 95 °C and 30 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C,30sat58 °C, and 30 s at 72 °C. First strand cDNA was prepared for LightCycler™-based real-time PCR analysis (Roche Applied Science) following total RNA extraction from transfected COS-1 cells using the Absolutely RNA™ RT-PCR Miniprep kit (Stratagene). A 276-bp PCR product was generated using ATP2C1 primers C7F (5′-TTGGTTGGCTGGTTACTGGG-3′) and C7R (5′-AGCATGCAGACCATCTGAAGT-3′), corresponding to nt 973–992 and the inverse complement of nt 1228–1248, respectively, in the ATP2C1d sequence. GAPDH amplification was performed, to control for equal RNA loading between samples, using primers GAPDHF (5′-ATCATCCCTGCCTCTACTGG-3′) and GAPDHR (5′-TGCTGTAGCCAAATTCGTTG-3′) to generate a 349-bp product. Sequences correspond to nt 120–139 and the inverse complement of nt 449–468 in the GAPDH sequence. Real-time PCR amplification was performed with 1 μl of cDNA product in a 20-μl reaction containing 0.5 μm of each primer and QuantiTect™ SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Qiagen, W. Sussex, UK). The PCR cycle consisted of 15 min of denaturation at 95 °C, followed by 45 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C, 20 s at 60 °C, and 20 s at 72 °C. Fluorescence data was acquired at the end of each extension cycle. To confirm amplification specificity, PCR products were subjected to a melting curve analysis, as described previously (21Gutzmer R. Mommert S. Kiehl P. Wittman M. Kapp A. Werfel T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 116: 926-932Google Scholar). Analysis of real-time PCR data was performed using the LightCycler™ software (Roche Applied Science). Crossing points, defined as the cycle number at which all samples are exponentially amplifying, were recalculated into relative log concentrations of RNA according to PCR efficiency calculated from standard curves generated using serially diluted cDNA for GAPDH and ATP2C1 primer sets. ATP2C1 amplification was then corrected for equal GAPDH expression between samples. PCR products were isolated from the LightCycler™ capillaries after cycling and visualized following electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels. cDNA Construction, Site-specific Mutagenesis, COS-1 Cell Culture, and Transfection—A full-length cDNA clone encoding ATP2C1d was constructed using cDNA fragments amplified by 5′ and 3′ RACE-PCR and was subcloned into vector pSPORT1 (Invitrogen). The full-length ATP2C1d cDNA was then transferred into the mammalian expression vector pMT2, with the insert corresponding to the entire coding sequence (nt 125-end) of the deposited ATP2C1d nucleotide sequence. Missense mutations originally reported in HHD patients by Sudbrak et al. (2Sudbrak R. Brown J. Dobson-Stone C. Carter S. Ramser J. White J. Healy E. Dissanayake M. Larrègue M. Perrussel M. Lehrach H. Munro C.S. Strachan T. Burge S. Hovnanian A. Monaco A.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1131-1140Google Scholar) and Dobson-Stone et al. (19Dobson-Stone C. Fairclough R. Dunne E. Brown J. Dissanayake M. Munro C.S. Strachan T. Burge S. Sudbrak R. Monaco A.P. Hovnanian A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 338-343Google Scholar) were introduced into the wild type ATP2C1 expression clone using the QuikChange™ XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The full-length cDNA clones were sequenced in both directions to ensure no additional sequence changes had been introduced during mutagenesis. Details of mutations introduced into the hSPCA1 protein sequence are given in Table I. COS-1 cells for immunocytochemistry, microsome preparation, and isotope flux were cultured and transiently transfected with FuGENE™ 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) as previously described (11Van Baelen K. Vanoevelen J. Missiaen L. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10683-10691Google Scholar). For total RNA or protein extraction 1 × 106 COS-1 cells were seeded in 60-mm culture dishes 24 h before transfection.Table ISummary of mutant proteins studiedhSPCA1 mutationEquivalent SERCA1a residueaDetermined by sequence alignment with SERCA1a.Putative protein domainbPutative protein domain prediction is based on the position of the equivalent residue within the structure of SERCA1a.P201LcP201L, C344Y, and T570I, respectively, represent mutations P185L, C328Y, and T554I, originally reported by Sudbrak et al.

Open table in a new tab Preparation of Antiserum to hSPCA1 Protein—Antibodies were raised essentially as described before (11Van Baelen K. Vanoevelen J. Missiaen L. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10683-10691Google Scholar). ATP2C1 cDNA was amplified using primers ATP2C1CYTF (5′-GCATGCTGTGAAAAAGCTGCCTATTG-3′; ATP2C1d nt 1122–1141) and ATP2C1CYTR (5′-GTCGACGCAACCTTTGGTACTATTTG-3′; ATP2C1d nt 1954–1973) containing, respectively, SphI and SalI sites at their 5′-end. PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 10 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 57 °C, and 60 s at 68 °C. After 10 cycles the extension time was increased to 90 s. The PCR amplification product encoded a fragment of hSPCA1 corresponding to the large cytoplasmic loop between transmembrane segments 4 and 5. The SphI/SalI-cut PCR fragment was ligated into the corresponding sites in the pQE-31 bacterial expression vector (Qiagen). Following expression in Escherichia coli using the QIAexpress Type IV System (Qiagen), the recombinant protein migrated at the expected size of 33 kDa on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Protein Preparation and Immunostaining Analyses—For total protein extractions COS-1 cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline before lysis in freshly prepared buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris HCl (pH 8), 5 mm EDTA, 2% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, chymostatin, and antipain). After 30-min incubation on ice, insoluble proteins were pelleted at 6000 × g. Soluble protein was retained in the supernatant. Microsomes were isolated from COS-1 cells as described by Verboomen et al. (22Verboomen H. Wuytack F. De Smedt H. Himpens B. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 591-596Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by using the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce, Rockford, IL). For Western blotting, proteins were separated and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Edinburgh, UK) using the NuPAGE® system with 4–12% Bis-Tris pre-cast gels (Invitrogen). For immunofluorescence, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100. Cells and membranes were quenched with 3% bovine serum albumin and 1% goat serum, followed by incubation with primary and secondary antiserum as described in the figure legends. Membranes were then incubated with ECF substrate (Amersham Biosciences) and fluorescent imaging was performed using a Storm 840 PhosphorImager in combination with ImageQuaNT™ software (Amersham Biosciences). 45Ca2+/54Mn2+ Fluxes—These radioactive isotope fluxes were essentially performed as described earlier (11Van Baelen K. Vanoevelen J. Missiaen L. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10683-10691Google Scholar). Cells were loaded with 120 mm KCl, 30 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 6.8), 5 mm ATP, 0.44 mm potassium EGTA (pH 6.8), 10 mm NaN3, and 2 μm thapsigargin to inhibit SERCA activity. Unless otherwise stated, cells were loaded for 90 min and 5 mm potassium oxalate was included in the loading medium. MgCl2, CaCl2, and MnCl2 were added to obtain a free Mg2+ concentration of 0.5 mm (unless otherwise stated) and the indicated concentrations of free Ca2+ and Mn2+. Calcium ionophore A23187 (10 μm) was included in the efflux medium as indicated. Analysis of Phospho-intermediates—Phosphorylation from [γ-32P]ATP, processing of the acid-precipitated microsomal proteins, and acidic SDS-PAGE electrophoresis were essentially performed as described before (11Van Baelen K. Vanoevelen J. Missiaen L. Raeymaekers L. Wuytack F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10683-10691Google Scholar). The rate of dephosphorylation of the phosphoenzyme intermediate formed from ATP was analyzed after treatment with EGTA and ADP for serial time intervals prior to acid quenching (23Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Leberer E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21018-21023Google Scholar, 24Dode L. Vilsen B. Van Baelen K. Wuytack F. Clausen J.D. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45579-45591Google Scholar). Phosphorylation was performed in 100 μl of a solution containing 160 mm KCl, 17 mm potassium Hepes (pH 7), 5 mm NaN3, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 2 μm thapsigargin. Phosphorylation from 0.5 mm32Pi was performed at 25 °C as before (23Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Leberer E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21018-21023Google Scholar). Quantification of the separated phosphoenzyme band was performed by imaging using the Packard Cyclone™ storage phosphor system (Packard Bioscience, Berkshire, UK). Appropriate background phosphorylation levels were subtracted before data analysis as described (24Dode L. Vilsen B. Van Baelen K. Wuytack F. Clausen J.D. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45579-45591Google Scholar). Alternative Splicing of ATP2C1 Primary Transcript—The primary aim of this study was to explore the stability and functional properties of a selected panel of mutated hSPCA1 proteins (see Table I), with each mutant incorporating one of the documented ATP2C1 missense mutations previously identified in HHD patients in our laboratory (2Sudbrak R.

Dermatol. 2002; 118: 338-343Google Scholar). We have chosen to assess the effect of these disease mutations when introduced into a new splice variant, ATP2C1d, described here for the first time. This variant was identified following the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR analysis, performed on cDNA reverse-transcribed from isolated human keratinocyte total RNA. As shown in Fig. 1A, 3′ RACE-PCR produced three strong bands of 450, 420, and 336 bp. Subcloning and subsequent sequencing confirmed that the 336- and 420-bp fragments, respectively, corresponded to the previously described splice variants ATP2C1a (2Sudbrak R. Brown J. Dobson-Stone C.

Strachan T. Burge S. Hovnanian A. Monaco A.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 1131-1140Google Scholar), whereas the 450-bp band corresponded to a novel splice variant, designated ATP2C1d. A weaker 325-bp band, corresponding to a variant previously identified by Hu et al. (3Hu Z. Bonifas J.M. Beech J. Bench G. Shigihara T. Ogawa H. Ikeda S. Mauro T. Epstein Jr., E.H. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 61-65Google Scholar), was also amplified by PCR and was designated ATP2C1c in this study. However, the corresponding protein, hSPCA1c, is unlikely to play an important functional role in keratinocytes (see “Discussion”). The scheme in Fig. 1B depicts the four modes of alternative splicing, and Fig. 1C illustrates the structure of the corresponding mature mRNAs. ATP2C1d (hSPCA1d), identified in this study, results from activation of a novel internal 5′ donor splice site (designated D2) in exon 27 within codon Val-919 (nt 2756 relative to the ATG start codon). Val-919 is found immediately upstream of the exon 27 TGA translation stop codon, meaning that exon 27 reaches a maximum size of 128 bp. ATP2C1d mRNA is expressed to a high level in keratinocytes and is encoded by the full-length of optional exons 27 and 28, making ATP2C1d the longest alternatively spliced variant. In view of this, all our further experiments were performed using this variant, either in its wild type form or following the introduction of nine missense mutations identified in HHD patients (Table I). Characterization of the Transport Capacity for Ca2+ and Mn2+ of Novel Splice Variant hSPCA1d—For functional characterization, hSPCA1d was transiently expressed in COS-1 cells. First, its ability to transport Ca2+ and Mn2+ was investigated. Because the fraction of Golgi-derived membranes accounts for only a small proportion of total ER in microsomal fractions, conventional techniques used to measure SERCA-mediated Ca2+ transport activity into isolated microsomes (22Verboomen H. Wuytack F. De Smedt H. Himpens B. Casteels R. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 591-596Google Scholar) could not be employed here. Alternatively, all Ca2+ uptake measurements were performed using detergent-permeabilized whole cells (25Missiaen L. De Smedt H. Parys J.-B. Casteels R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7238-7242Google Scholar). COS-1 cells transfected with empty vector (control) or wild type hSPCA1d cDNA were first permeabilized with saponin in a medium mimicking cytosolic composition and then loaded with 45Ca2+ in the presence of sodium azide (NaN3), to inhibit mitochondrial pump activity, and in the presence of thapsigargin, to inhibit SERCA pump activity. Efflux of the Ca2+ taken up by active pumps was then followed for 16 min in Ca2+-free medium, with the ionophore A23187 being added after 8 min. Fig. 2A shows that hSPCA1d-transfected cells exhibit a significantly higher thapsigargin-insensitive Ca2+-uptake compared with control cells. The addition of A23187 enhanced the release of stored Ca2+, suggesting that the Ca2+ had been transported into a membrane-delineated compartment. These results support the theory that hSPCA1d represents a thapsigargin-insensitive Golgi pump. Furthermore, the addition of 5 mm potassium oxalate to the loading medium stimulated an increase in the Ca2+-uptake capacity of hSPCA1 by more than 50%, when compared with uptake in the absence of oxalate. Oxalate acts to increase the ability of hSPCA1d to transport Ca2+ into the Golgi by precipitating Ca2+ and thus reducing the free Ca2+ concentration within the Golgi lumen. Fig. 2B compares the time-dependent loading of 45Ca2+ in hSPCA1d-expressin"
https://openalex.org/W2036871316,"V0V1-ATPase is a proton-translocating ATPase responsible for acidification of eukaryotic intracellular compartments and for ATP synthesis in archaea and some eubacteria. We demonstrated recently the rotation of the central stalk subunits in V1, a catalytic sector of V0V1-ATPase (Imamura, H., Nakano, M., Noji, H., Muneyuki, E., Ohkuma, S., Yoshida, M., and Yokoyama, K. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 100, 2312–2315), but the rotation of the proteolipid ring, a predicted counterpart rotor in the membrane V0 sector, has remained to be proven. V0V1-ATPase that retained sensitivity to N′,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide was isolated from Thermus thermophilus, immobilized onto a glass surface through the N termini of the A subunits of V1, and decorated with a bead attached to a proteolipid subunit of V0. Rotation of beads was observed in the presence of ATP, and direction of rotation was always counterclockwise viewed from the membrane side. The rotation proceeded at ∼3.0 rev/s in average at 4 mm ATP and was abolished by N′,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide treatment. Thus, the rotation of the central stalk in V1 accompanies rotation of a proteolipid ring of V0 in the functioning V0V1-ATPase. V0V1-ATPase is a proton-translocating ATPase responsible for acidification of eukaryotic intracellular compartments and for ATP synthesis in archaea and some eubacteria. We demonstrated recently the rotation of the central stalk subunits in V1, a catalytic sector of V0V1-ATPase (Imamura, H., Nakano, M., Noji, H., Muneyuki, E., Ohkuma, S., Yoshida, M., and Yokoyama, K.

The rotation proceeded at ∼3.0 rev/s in average at 4 mm ATP and was abolished by N′,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide treatment. Thus, the rotation of the central stalk in V1 accompanies rotation of a proteolipid ring of V0 in the functioning V0V1-ATPase. V0V1-ATPase catalyzes the interconversion of the energy of proton translocation across membranes and the energy of ATP hydrolysis/synthesis (1Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Google Scholar, 2Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Google Scholar, 3Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12951-12954Google Scholar). Eukaryotic cells adopt V0V1-ATPase as an ATP hydrolysis-driven proton pump that carries out acidification of cellular compartments such as lysosomes and extracellular fluid in the case of renal acidification, bone resorption, and tumor metastasis (1Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Google Scholar). On the contrary, in archaea and some eubacteria, a major role of V0V1-ATPase is to produce ATP that is driven by downhill proton flow across membranes (4Gruber G. Wieczorek H. Harvey W.R. Muller V. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 2597-2605Google Scholar, 5Yokoyama K. Muneyuki E. Amano T. Mizutani S. Yoshida M. Ishida M. Ohkuma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20504-20510Google Scholar). V0V1-ATPase is a complicated protein complex with a molecular mass of ∼800 kDa composed of many different subunits arranged into two sectors, V0 and V1 (1Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Google Scholar). We have studied V0V1-ATPase from a thermophilic eubacterium, Thermus thermophilus, a stable enzyme that allows experimental procedures difficult for enzymes from other sources, and developed the expression systems of subcomplexes and subunits in Escherichia coli (5Yokoyama K. Muneyuki E. Amano T. Mizutani S. Yoshida M. Ishida M. Ohkuma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20504-20510Google Scholar). The V1 sector of T. thermophilus, which has ATP hydrolyzing activity by itself, is made up of four different subunits, A (63 kDa), B (53 kDa), D (25 kDa), and F (12 kDa) with a stoichiometry of A3B3D1F1 (6Yokoyama K. Oshima T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21946-21950Google Scholar). The A subunit contains a catalytic site, and the A and B subunits are arranged alternately to form a hexameric cylinder (7Yokoyama K. Ohkuma S. Taguchi H. Yasunaga T. Wakabayashi T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13955-13961Google Scholar). The D subunit fills the central cavity of the cylinder and, together with the F subunit, forms a central stalk (7Yokoyama K. Ohkuma S. Taguchi H. Yasunaga T. Wakabayashi T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13955-13961Google Scholar, 8Arata Y. Baleja J.D. Forgac M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11301-11307Google Scholar, 9Xu T. Vasilyeva E. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28909-28915Google Scholar). The V0 sector is responsible for proton translocation across membranes, and the principal components involved in proton translocation are a highly conserved family of hydrophobic subunits, often termed as proteolipid because of their solubility in organic solvents. The eukaryotic V0 sector contains three similar but different proteolipid species, which are predicted to contain at least four transmembrane helices, arranged in a ring-like structure (2Stevens T.H. Forgac M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 779-808Google Scholar, 10Wilkens S. Forgac M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44064-44068Google Scholar, 11Powell B. Graham L.A. Stevens T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23654-23660Google Scholar). On the contrary, single proteolipid proteins with two transmembrane helices, termed L subunit, make a ring-like structure in V0 sector of T. thermophilus V0V1-ATPase (4Gruber G. Wieczorek H. Harvey W.R. Muller V. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 2597-2605Google Scholar, 7Yokoyama K. Ohkuma S. Taguchi H. Yasunaga T. Wakabayashi T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13955-13961Google Scholar). The V0 sector of T. thermophilus contains another membrane protein, I subunit (71 kDa), a homolog of yeast Vph1p, that interacts with the proteolipid ring and plays also a critical role in proton translocation (12Kawasaki-Nishi S. Nishi T. Forgac M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12397-12402Google Scholar). V0V1-ATPase is known to be structurally and evolutionary related to F0F1-ATP synthase, which is responsible for ATP production in mitochondria, chloroplasts, and many eubacteria (1Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Google Scholar, 4Gruber G. Wieczorek H. Harvey W.R. Muller V. J. Exp. Biol. 2001; 204: 2597-2605Google Scholar, 13Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 714-749Google Scholar). F0F1-ATP synthase is also composed of two sectors, F0 and F1. The c subunit in F0 is a proteolipid protein composed of two transmembrane helices and forms a ring structure (14Stock D. Leslie A.G. Walker J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1700-1705Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis in catalytic sites of F1 drives rotation of the central stalk subunits, γ and ϵ (15Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita Jr., K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Google Scholar, 16Tsunoda S.P. Aggeler R. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 898-902Google Scholar), and this rotation in turn drives the rotation of the F0c-ring (16Tsunoda S.P. Aggeler R. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 898-902Google Scholar, 17Nishio K. Iwamoto-Kihara A. Yamamoto A. Wada Y. Futai M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 13448-13452Google Scholar, 18Tsunoda S.P. Aggeler R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 244-248Google Scholar) that is thought to be directly responsible for proton translocation (19Oster G. Wang H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1458: 482-510Google Scholar). Because of the functional and structural similarity between V0V1-ATPase and F0F1-ATP synthase, it has been assumed that V0V1-ATPase would use a similar rotary mechanism in catalysis (1Nishi T. Forgac M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 94-103Google Scholar, 20Yoshida M. Muneyuki E. Hisabori T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 669-677Google Scholar). In fact, the rotation of the D and F subunits relative to the A and B subunits in V1-ATPase from T. thermophilus was recently proven (21Imamura H. Nakano M. Noji H. Muneyuki E. Ohkuma S. Yoshida M. Yokoyama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2312-2315Google Scholar). Here, we show the visual demonstration of ATP-dependent rotation of the proteolipid ring in V0V1-ATPase. Purification of Mutant V0V1-ATPase—A mutated V0V1-ATPase (AHis8 tags/A-S232A/A-T235S/L-E23C) was constructed by integration vector system (22Tamakoshi M. Yaoi T. Oshima T. Yamagishi A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 173: 431-437Google Scholar, 23Tamakoshi M. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 222: 125-132Google Scholar, 24Tamakoshi M. Uchida M. Tanabe K. Fukuyama S. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4811-4844Google Scholar). pUTpyrE, which carries the pyrE gene cassette, was constructed. The XbaI-EcoRI fragment containing the leuB gene of pT8leuB was cloned in pUC119, and then the NdeI-EcoRI fragment was replaced with the NdeI-EcoRI fragment containing the pyrE gene of pINV (24Tamakoshi M. Uchida M. Tanabe K. Fukuyama S. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4811-4844Google Scholar). The sequence corresponding to a 1550-bp region, which is upstream of the atpA gene, containing the termination codon of the atpF gene and the sequence corresponding to a 1750-bp region containing the mutated atpA gene (A-His8 tags/A-S232A/A-T235S) with its Shine-Dalgarno sequence were cloned in the SphI-SalI and EcoRV-EcoRI sites of pUTpyrE, respectively. A pyrE strain, T. thermophilus TTY1, was genetically transformed with the resultant plasmid as described previously (22Tamakoshi M. Yaoi T. Oshima T. Yamagishi A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 173: 431-437Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on a minimum-medium plate without uracil. To introduce cysteine residue to L subunit, another integration vector was then constructed. The sequence corresponding to a 1250-bp region, which is upstream of the atpL gene, containing the termination codon of the atpG gene and the sequence corresponding to a 1350-bp region containing the mutated atpL gene (l-E23C) with its Shine-Dalgarno sequence were cloned in the SphI-SalI and EcoRV-EcoRI sites of pBHTK1 (25Nureki O. Shirouzu M. Hashimoto K. Ishitani R. Terada T. Tamakoshi M. Oshima T. Chijimatsu M. Takio K. Vassylyev D.G. Shibata T. Inoue Y. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 2002; 58: 1129-1137Google Scholar), respectively. The transformant involved in atpA mutation was transformed with the resultant plasmid containing mutated atpL gene. The transformant was selected on a nutrient-medium plate containing 0.1 mm kanamycin. Chromosomal DNA was prepared from a transformed strain, and mutations were confirmed by sequencing with a ABI 310 sequencer. The recombinant T. thermophilus was grown as described previously (6Yokoyama K. Oshima T. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21946-21950Google Scholar, 26Yokoyama K. Akabane Y. Ishii N. Yoshida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12248-12253Google Scholar). The cells (200 g) harvested at log-phase growth were suspended in 400 ml of 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), containing 5 mm MgCl2 and disrupted by sonication. The membranes were precipitated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min and washed with the same buffer twice. The washed membranes were suspended in 20 mm sodium imidazole (pH 8.0), 0.1 m NaCl, and 10% (w/v) octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether (C12E8), and the suspension was sonicated. The debris and insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min, and the supernatant was applied onto a Ni2+-NTA 1The abbreviations used are: NTA, nitrilotriacetic acid; DCCD, N′N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide; C12E8, octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether; ACMA, 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine. -Superflow column (3 × 10 cm, Qiagen) equilibrated with 20 mm sodium imidazole (pH 8.0), 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.1% C12E8. The column was washed with 200 ml of the same buffer. The protein was eluted with a linear imidazole gradient (20–100 mm). The fractions containing the V0V1-ATPase were combined and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.05% C12E8 for 2 h. The dialyzed solution was applied to a Resource Q column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, and 0.05% C12E8. The proteins were eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–0.5 m). The above purification procedures were carried out at 4 °C and completed within 8 h. The purified V0V1-ATPase was immediately biotinylated with a 10-molar excess of 6-{N′-[2-(N-maleimido)ethyl]-N-piperazinylamido}-hexyl-d-biotinamide (biotin-PEAC5-maleimide, Dojindo) in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.05% C12E8. After a 15-min incubation at 25 °C, proteins were separated from unbound reagents with a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences). The biotinylated V0V1-ATPases were kept on ice and used for experiments within a day. Specific biotinylation of the L subunit was checked by Western blotting using streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Amersham Biosciences). Rotation Experiments—A flow cell (5 μl) was made of two coverslips (bottom, 24 × 36 mm2; top, 18 × 18 mm2) separated by two spacers of 50-μm thickness. The glass surface of the bottom coverslip was coated with Ni2+-NTA. The biotinylated V0V1-ATPase (0.1–1 μm) in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.05% C12E8, and 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin) was applied to the flow cell and was washed with 20 μl of buffer A. When sensitivity to inhibition by N′,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD) was examined, the biotinylated enzyme (1 μm) was incubated for 30 min at 25 °C in buffer A containing 100 μm DCCD prior to infusing into the flow cell. The suspension (10 μl) of 0.1% (w/v) streptavidin-coated beads (ϕ = 0.56 μm, Bangs Laboratories Inc.) in buffer A was infused into the flow cell, and unbound beads were washed out with 40 μl of buffer A. Observation of rotation was started after infusion of 10 μl of buffer A supplemented with indicated concentrations of ATP and an ATP-regenerating system (0.2 mg/ml creatine kinase and 2.5 mm creatine phosphate). Rotation of beads was observed with a bright-field microscope (IX70, Olympus) at a magnification of 1000. Images were video-recorded (30 frames/s) with a CCD camera. All of these procedures and observations were carried out at 25 °C. Other Assays—ATPase activity was measured at 25 °C with an enzyme-coupled ATP-regenerating system (5Yokoyama K. Muneyuki E. Amano T. Mizutani S. Yoshida M. Ishida M. Ohkuma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20504-20510Google Scholar). The ATPase assay solution contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 4 mm ATP-Mg, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 100 μg/ml lactate dehydrogenase, 100 μg/ml of pyruvate kinase, 0.2 mm NADH, and 0.05% C12E8. When DCCD sensitivity of ATPase activity was examined, the enzyme (1 μm) was incubated at 25 °C with 100 μm DCCD in 20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0), 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.05% C12E8. The aliquots were taken out at indicated times, and residual ATPase activity was assayed. In the case when DCCD sensitivity of V0V1-ATPase isolated from membranes with Triton X-100 was examined, the reaction mixture and assay mixture contained 0.05% Triton X-100 instead of 0.05% C12E8. ATP-driven H+ translocation by V0V1-ATPase was monitored at 25 °C by fluorescence quenching of 9-amino-6-chloro-2-methoxyacridine (ACMA) (excitation at 410 nm; emission at 480 nm). Reconstituted vesicles containing purified V0V1-ATPase were suspended at 10 μg of protein/ml in 10 mm HEPES/KOH (pH 8.0), 100 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.3 μg/ml ACMA, and the reaction was initiated by adding 4 mm ATP. At indicate times, 1 μg/ml carbonyl cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone was added. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). Properties of Mutated V0V1-ATPase for Rotation Assay—To prepare mutant V0V1-ATPase (A-His8 tags/A-S232A/A-T235S/l-E23C) of T. thermophilus for the rotation experiment, we have been using the shuttle integration vector system (22Tamakoshi M. Yaoi T. Oshima T. Yamagishi A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 173: 431-437Google Scholar, 23Tamakoshi M. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 222: 125-132Google Scholar, 24Tamakoshi M. Uchida M. Tanabe K. Fukuyama S. Yamagishi A. Oshima T. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4811-4844Google Scholar, 25Nureki O. Shirouzu M. Hashimoto K. Ishitani R. Terada T. Tamakoshi M. Oshima T. Chijimatsu M. Takio K. Vassylyev D.G. Shibata T. Inoue Y. Kuramitsu S. Yokoyama S. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 2002; 58: 1129-1137Google Scholar). T. thermophilus is absolutely aerobic (27Oshima T. Imahori K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1974; 75: 179-183Google Scholar), and the membranes of recombinant T. thermophilus cells must contain the functional mutated ATP synthase. The His8 tags were added to the N termini of the A subunits to immobilize the enzyme to the Ni2+-NTA-coated glass surface. Glutamic acid 23 of the L subunit was replaced with cysteine for biotinylation. Turnover rate of wild type V0V1-ATPase rapidly decays because of entrapping inhibitory Mg-ADP in a catalytic site (5Yokoyama K. Muneyuki E. Amano T. Mizutani S. Yoshida M. Ishida M. Ohkuma S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20504-20510Google Scholar). The active time interval is too short to find and analyze the rotating molecules, and therefore, the S232A/T235S double substitution in the A subunit, which was found to suppress the Mg-ADP inhibition, was introduced. The mutated V0V1-ATPase was solubilized and purified to homogeneity in the presence of C12E8. The ATPase activity of isolated V0V1-ATPase lasted for at least 10 min after adding ATP. The V0V1-ATPase exhibited simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Km value of 450 ± 80 μm and a kcat value of ∼9.5 ± 1.0 s–1. Fig. 1A shows sensitivity of V0V1-ATPase to inactivation by DCCD, a specific inhibitor that modifies a critical carboxylate in proteolipid subunit. DCCD has been generally used as a marker to show that the F0F1-ATPase is intact (13Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 714-749Google Scholar, 16Tsunoda S.P. Aggeler R. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 898-902Google Scholar, 28Kaim G. Matthey U. Dimroth P. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 688-695Google Scholar). If proton translocation and ATP hydrolysis is uncoupled because of damage of the functional connection between F0 and F1, ATPase activity is no longer sensitive to DCCD inhibition. This contention is also the case for V0V1-ATPase, and we looked for the procedures to isolate the DCCD-sensitive enzyme. Among the detergents we tested, C12E8 gave the best results. The ATPase activity of V0V1-ATPase solubilized and purified in C12E8 was inhibited by DCCD and was nearly completely lost after a 30-min incubation (Fig. 1A). The isolated V1-ATPase was not inhibited by DCCD (data not shown). On the contrary, Triton X-100 has a deteriorating effect on V0V1-ATPase as was observed for F0F1-ATPase (18Tsunoda S.P. Aggeler R. Noji H. Kinosita Jr., K. Yoshida M. Capaldi R.A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 244-248Google Scholar). The enzyme solubilized and purified in Triton X-100 lost the sensitivity to DCCD inhibition (Fig. 1A). The isolated V0V1-ATPase reconstituted into phospholipid liposomes showed an ATP-dependent proton translocation activity, and this activity was also completely lost by DCCD treatment (Fig. 1B). Thus, our preparation of V0V1-ATPase retained intact activity that coupled proton translocation and ATP hydrolysis. Rotation of the Proteolipid Ring—The observation system of V0V1-ATPase rotation is similar to that used for V1-ATPase (Fig. 2A). Rotation was visualized by a bead obliquely attached to the L subunit, which was illuminated as a bright-field image under optical microscopic field. Specificity of biotinylation of the L subunits in V0V1-ATPase was confirmed by protein immunoblotting with streptavidin (Fig. 2B). The biotinylation of V0V1-ATPase did not affect the enzymatic properties, turnover rate, and DCCD sensitivity (data not shown). The His8 tags of the enzymes were immobilized to the Ni2+-NTA-coated glass surface. We found rotating beads attached to the L subunit in V0V1-ATPase when the flow cell was infused by a buffer containing ATP (Fig. 3A). 10–20 rotating beads were usually found in 0.2-mm2 area of a single flow cell where a total of 2000–3000 beads were found. Rotations were unidirectional and, similar to V1-ATPase, directions were always counterclockwise when viewed from the membrane side (V0 side). Azide, which has been known as specific inhibitor of F1-ATPase, did not affect the observed rotation of V0V1-ATPase at 4 mm ATP (Fig. 3B). The average rotation rate at 4 mm ATP was calculated to be ∼3.0 rev/s for the beads showing apparently uninhibited rotation that continued for >20 s without pause longer than 2 s. One revolution consumes three ATP molecules, and therefore, the above rotation rate may correspond to a kcat value of ∼10 s–1 that agrees well to the value obtained from the bulk phase kinetics. Rotations at 1 mm ATP (not shown) appeared very similar to those observed at 4 mm ATP, and the average rotation rate was ∼2.7 rev/s. At 0.2 mm ATP, the substrate ATP binding to the enzyme becomes the rate-limiting step in the whole catalytic cycle and the rotation was slowed significantly (Fig. 3C).Fig. 3Time courses of rotation of beads attached to the L subunit.A, rotation at 4 mm ATP. B, rotation at 4 mm ATP in the presence of 0.5 mm sodium azide. C, rotation at 0.2 mm ATP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To address inhibitory effect of DCCD on rotation of V0V1-ATPase, the enzyme was incubated with DCCD for 30 min before rotation assay. The number of rotating beads decreased to ∼5% compared with non-treated enzyme (Fig. 4). The inhibitory effect of DCCD on rotation is comparable with that on ATPase activity of the enzyme in the bulk solution. Rotation of the beads attached to V1-ATPase was not affected with DCCD treatment. These results indicate that the observed rotations were those of the functional V0V1-ATPase with coupling entity. We show here the rotation of the proteolipid ring of V0V1-ATPase. The rotation is DCCD-sensitive, and therefore, such controversy over the intactness of the enzyme as was raised on the DCCD-insensitive rotation of F0F1-ATPase in Triton X-100 (16Tsunoda S.P.

Whether other subunits also contribute to make up the rotor awaits further study."

The whole-body exposure of Swiss mice to environmental cigarette smoke (ECS) during pregnancy decreased the number of fetuses per dam, placenta weight, and fetus weight. ECS increased DNA adducts, oxidative nucleotide alterations, and cytogenetic damage in fetus liver. Evaluation by cDNA array of 746 genes showed that 61 of them were expressed in fetus liver under basal conditions. The oral administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) during pregnancy enhanced the expression of three genes only, including two glutathione S-transferases and alpha1-antitrypsin precursor, whose deficiency plays a pathogenetic role in congenital emphysema. Transplacental ECS upregulated the expression of 116 genes involved in metabolism, response to oxidative stress, DNA and protein repair, and signal transduction. NAC inhibited the ECS-related genetic damage and upregulation of most genes. ECS stimulated pro-apoptotic genes and genes downregulating the cell cycle, which may justify growth impairments in the developing fetus. Thus, both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms were modulated by ECS. Moreover, hypoxia-related genes and several oncogenes and receptors involved in proliferation and differentiation of leukocytes were induced in the fetal liver, which also bears hematopoietic functions."

TbMSP-B mRNA occurs in both procyclic and bloodstream trypanosomes, whereas TbMSP-A and -C mRNAs are detected only in bloodstream organisms. RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated gene silencing was used to investigate the function of TbMSP-B protein.

Procyclic trypanosomes have been shown previously to have an uncharacterized cell surface metalloprotease activity that can release ectopically expressed surface proteins. To determine whether TbMSP-B is responsible for this release, transgenic variant surface glycoprotein 117 (VSG117) was expressed constitutively in T. brucei procyclic TbMSP-RNAi cell lines, and the amount of surface VSG117 was determined using a surface biotinylation assay. Ablation of TbMSP-B but not TbMSP-A mRNA resulted in a marked decrease in VSG release with a concomitant increase in steady state cell-associated VSG117, indicating that TbMSP-B mediates the surface protease activity of procyclic trypanosomes.

The MSP genes (MSPs) are located in tandem arranged multigene arrays in all Leishmania sp. studied (25Roberts S.C. Swihart K.G. Agey M.W. Ramamoorthy R. Wilson M.E. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem.

Within the gene arrays, individual genes display different life cycle-specific expression patterns (27Ramamoorthy R. Swihart K.G. McCoy J.J. Wilson M.E. Donelson J.E. J. Biol.

The relative locations of the MSPs in the Leishmania genome do not provide an indication of their differential expression, but the MSPs expressed in different life cycle stages have different 3′ untranslated region sequences (24Ramamoorthy R. Donelson J.E. Paetz K.E. Maybodi M. Roberts S.P. Wilson M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1888-1895Google Scholar). Experiments with a reporter gene fused to the MSP 3′ untranslated regions demonstrate that this life cycle-specific regulation is conferred by specific sequences within the 3′ untranslated region (2Myung K.S. Beetham J.K. Wilson M.E. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16489-16497Google Scholar, 33Kelly B.L. Nelson T.N. McMaster W.R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 116: 101-104Google Scholar). Another protozoan parasite, the African trypanosome, also effectively thwarts the mammalian immune system but does so by a different mechanism. This pathogen is transmitted by tsetse flies and causes African sleeping sickness, a fatal disease unless treated with highly toxic drugs. In contrast to Leishmania, African trypanosomes are exclusively extracellular throughout their life cycle. In the bloodstream of their host, they evade the immune system by undergoing antigenic variation, a phenomenon whereby they periodically switch their major surface protein, the variant surface glycoprotein (VSG). Because antigenic variation is a very efficient immune evasion strategy for an extracellular parasite, we were surprised to discover genes encoding homologues of Leishmania MSPs in the African trypanosome genome (34El-Sayed N.M. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 167-178Google Scholar, 35El-Sayed N.M.A. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26742-26748Google Scholar). The corresponding MSP molecules in extracellular African trypanosomes do not contribute to parasite entry and survival in macrophages as they do for the intracellular Leishmania, so they might perform cellular functions for African trypanosomes that they either do not provide for Leishmania or are functions yet to be discovered in Leishmania. One possible function was suggested by our earlier biochemical studies showing that when cultured trypanosomes in the procyclic stage, i.e. the developmental stage that occurs in the tsetse fly midgut, were engineered to synthesize a transgenic VSG, the procyclic organisms utilized the enzymatic activity of a cell-surface, zinc-dependent metalloprotease to release the VSG molecules from the plasma membrane (36Bangs J.D. Ransom D.M. McDowell M.A. Brouch E.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4285-4294Google Scholar, 37Bangs J.D. Ransom D.M. Nimick M. Christie G. Hooper N.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 111-117Google Scholar). However, the first TbMSP species that we identified was expressed solely in bloodstream-form parasites and seemed unlikely to account for the procyclic protease activity (35El-Sayed N.M.A. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26742-26748Google Scholar). Here we document that Trypanosoma brucei has three differentially expressed families of MSP genes, which we call TbMSP-A, -B, and -C. Examination of the T. brucei genomic DNA sequences currently available in the data bases does not reveal any additional TbMSP families, although more could appear when the determination of the T. brucei genome sequence is complete. All three TbMSP families are expressed in bloodstream-stage trypanosomes, but only TbMSP-B is expressed in the procyclic stage. We show here using RNA interference (RNAi) that TbMSP-B can function to release the ectopically expressed VSG from the surface of procyclic trypanosomes. Thus, TbMSP-B imparts a protein-processing function to the surface of African trypanosomes. Identification of TbMSP-B and -C Genes—The TbMSP-B and -C genes were identified by using the previously determined TbMSP-A amino acid sequence (GenBank™/EBI accession number U86345) (35El-Sayed N.M.A. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26742-26748Google Scholar) to search the genome survey sequences data base of T. brucei bacterial artificial chromosome end sequences (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/) deposited by The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR). In addition to TbMSP-A, several related but nonidentical sequences were found and arranged into contigs. Gaps in the sequence were closed by PCR amplifying the gap region from genomic DNA and DNA sequencing. The sequences for TbMSP-B and -C matched those deposited subsequently by TIGR and the Sanger Institute, respectively (GenBank™/EBI accession numbers AC099045, AY230807, and TRYP10.0. 000073_31[48784–50556]). Gene Cloning—The coding sequences of TbMSP-A and -B were PCR-amplified from T. brucei genomic DNA with the following primers (XbaI sites are underlined): 5′-GCTCTAGATGGCAGTGATTATGTTCCCTCGT and 5′-GCTCTAGAGCCGTCACACGCATACTACTATC (Tb-MSP-A) and 5′-GCTCTAGACGCGGTTTTCTGTATTGTTTTG and 5′-GCTCTAGAGCATACATTACCATATCAGCGTC (TbMSP-B). The PCR products were digested with XbaI and ligated into the XbaI sites of plasmid p2T7TiA/GFP (42LaCount D.J. Barrett B. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17580-17588Google Scholar) to generate plasmids p2T7TiA/TbMSP-A and p2T7TiA/TbMSP-B, respectively. Cell Lines and Transfections—Procyclic T. brucei 29-13 cells (T7RNAP NEO TETR HYG) and the bloodstream T. brucei single marker cell line (T7RNAP TETR NEO) were gifts from G. A. M. Cross (Rockefeller University, New York) (43Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Google Scholar). The 29-13 cells were maintained in Cunningham's SM medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and were transfected with NotI-linearized plasmids (5–10 μg) as described (42LaCount D.J. Barrett B. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17580-17588Google Scholar). Stable transformants were selected in 15 μg/ml G418, 50 μg/ml hygromycin, and 2.5 μg/ml phleomycin. Clonal lines were established from drug-resistant pooled lines obtained by limiting dilution. The bloodstream T. brucei single marker line was grown in HMI-9 medium (54Hirumi H. Hirumi K. Doyle J.J. Cross G.A. Parasitol. 1980; 80: 371-382Google Scholar) supplemented with 10% FCS and transfected as described (43Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Google Scholar). Transfected cells were transferred to 12 ml of HMI-9 + 10% FCS and distributed among wells in a 24-well tissue culture plate. After recovering overnight, an equal volume of HMI-9 + 10% FCS plus 5 μg/ml G418 and 5 μg/ml phleomycin was added to the wells. Northern Analysis—Total RNA (5 μg) was subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane with 20× SSC. Blots were hybridized with 5 × 106 cpm of 32P-random primed probe/ml in 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, and 100 μg/ml single-stranded salmon sperm DNA. Final wash conditions were 0.2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Expression of VSG117 in TbMSP-B RNAi Cells—The neomycin resistance cassette (NEO) in the plasmid pXS2neo:117wt (36Bangs J.D. Ransom D.M. McDowell M.A. Brouch E.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4285-4294Google Scholar) was replaced with a PCR-generated puromycin resistance cassette (PAC) using flanking AscI and PacI restriction sites. The resultant vector is designed for stable constitutive expression of the VSG117 gene in procyclic trypanosomes following integration into the tubulin gene locus. The BstXI-linearized plasmid was electroporated into procyclic T. brucei 29-13 cells already bearing p2T7Ti/TbMSP-B (clone F2) or p2T7Ti/TbMSP-A (clone A1) and selected with puromycin (5 μg/ml) as described previously (36Bangs J.D. Ransom D.M. McDowell M.A. Brouch E.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4285-4294Google Scholar). VSG Release Assay—Proteolytic release of VSG from the surface of transgenic procyclic trypanosomes has been described previously (36Bangs J.D. Ransom D.M. McDowell M.A. Brouch E.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4285-4294Google Scholar). Briefly, procyclic RNAi cell lines stably expressing VSG117 were surface-biotinylated with sulfo-N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidobiotin (Pierce) and then incubated for 6 h at 27 °C in culture medium (36Bangs J.D. Ransom D.M. McDowell M.A. Brouch E.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4285-4294Google Scholar). VSG was immunoprecipitated from cell and medium fractions and separated by SDS-PAGE. After electroblotting to membranes, biotinyl-VSG was detected by chemiluminescence with avidin-horseradish peroxidase (Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Cells displayed excellent motility and morphology throughout the 6-h assay period. To determine the effect of ablation of specific TbMSP genes, the RNAi cell lines were maintained in log phase culture (1 × 105–2 × 106 cells/ml) in the absence or presence of tetracycline (1 μg/ml) for 5 days prior to assay of the VSG release. Identification of T. brucei Genes Encoding Homologues of Leishmania MSPs—The first leishmanial MSP-like gene to be identified in T. brucei was discovered while sequencing sheared T. brucei genomic DNA fragments, i.e. genomic survey sequences, and the corresponding cDNA was identified in a bloodstream T. brucei cDNA library (34El-Sayed N.M. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 84: 167-178Google Scholar, 35El-Sayed N.M.A. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26742-26748Google Scholar). Subsequent Southern blots and sequence determination of a cloned 14-kb genomic DNA fragment revealed that the T. brucei genome contains at least five closely related copies of the gene encoding this TbMSP, and northern blots showed that they are expressed predominately in bloodstream trypanosomes (35El-Sayed N.M.A. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26742-26748Google Scholar). We have named this gene family TbMSP-A. Inspection of the partially determined chromosomal sequences of T. brucei now available at the web sites of TIGR (tigrblast.tigr.org/er-blast/index.cgi?project=tba1), the Sanger Institute (www.genedb.org/genedb/tryp/index.jsp), and the National Center for Bioinformatics (NCBI; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/) reveals two other gene families encoding proteins with substantial homology to the leishmanial MSPs, and we have named these families TbMSP-B and -C. As described below, the coding regions for these three families do not cross-hybridize on northern blots despite the fact that they encode proteins with about 33% amino acid identity. The TbMSP-B family contains four tandem genes located on chromosome VIII, and the TbMSP-C family is comprised of a single gene at the end of a long gene cluster on chromosome X. The diploid T. brucei genome has 11 megachromosome pairs (chromosomes I–XI), and the chromosomal location of the TbMSP-A family has not yet been identified by either chromosome-specific DNA sequencing or hybridization to chromosomes separated on pulsed field electrophoresis gels. No evidence for the presence of additional TbMSP families is available in the current data bases of the partially determined T. brucei genomic sequence. These data bases are now large enough that any given gene has a >95% chance of being at least partially represented. 2N. El-Sayed, personal communication. However, the data bases of TIGR and the Sanger Institute contain randomly sheared end sequences and other small genomic sequences (<0.5 kb) encoding segments of TbMSP-like genes, and to date it is not possible to determine whether they all fit into one of the three TbMSP classes. Therefore, it remains possible that additional intact TbMSPs will be found when the T. brucei genomic sequence determination is completed. Fig. 1 shows a comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of a representative member of each of the three TbMSP families. In all three sequences the locations of 20 cysteines, 10 prolines, and the metalloprotease catalytic site motif of HEXXH are conserved. These same cysteine and proline positions and the HEXXH catalytic site are conserved in virtually all leishmanial MSPs for which genes have been sequenced to date, suggesting that the TbMSPs have the same general secondary and tertiary structure as do the leishmanial MSPs. The three TbMSP sequences range in size from 591 to 622 amino acids and display about 33% positional identity overall. They differ most at their termini, and their C-terminal differences are particularly apparent in the alignment shown in Fig. 1. Nascent TbMSP-A has an extended C-terminal region, absent in the other two, that is rich in serines and glutamates and culminates in a short hydrophobic segment. Nascent TbMSP-B has a C-terminal hydrophobic tail reminiscent of the hydrophobic C termini of most but not all leishmanial MSPs that are replaced by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor to the plasma membrane. Nascent TbMSP-C has a highly hydrophilic C terminus rich in charged amino acids and prolines, indicating that it is not linked to a membrane via a GPI anchor. All three TbMSPs have hydrophobic residues at their N termini that are predicted to serve as signal peptides, although this has yet to be proven. Differential Expression of the Three TbMSP Families— Northern blots of RNAs from the two main developmental stages of T. brucei, the procyclic and bloodstream stages, were probed with 32P-labeled representatives of the three TbMSP families (Fig. 2). Within each of the three TbMSP families the nucleotide sequences of the coding, untranslated, and intergenic regions are highly similar and cross-hybridize. However, despite the amino acid similarities of the TbMSP proteins encoded by the three families, the nucleotide sequences of the three families are sufficiently different (data not shown) that they do not cross-hybridize with each other under high stringency hybridization conditions (Fig. 2). The northern blots in Fig. 2 show that TbMSP-A and -C mRNAs are expressed predominantly in bloodstream trypanosomes, whereas TbMSP-B mRNA is about 2-fold more abundant in procyclic trypanosomes. A reprobe of the blot with 32P-labeled tubulin coding region verified equal loadings of the bloodstream and procyclic RNAs in the blots (data not shown). However, the relative intensities of the signals between the three blots cannot be compared directly because of potential differences in the specific activities of the three radioactive TbMSP probes. To estimate the relative expression levels, 30,000 cDNA clones from a T. brucei bloodstream cDNA library were probed separately with the coding regions for TbMSP-A, -B, and -C, and the ratio of cDNAs encoding TbMSP-A, -B, and -C was found to be about 10:4:1 (not shown). Thus, in bloodstream trypanosomes the mRNA for TbMSP-A is about twice as abundant as the mRNA for TbMSP-B, which in turn is four times more abundant than the mRNA for TbMSP-C. As a further comparison, the ratio of cDNA clones encoding the highly abundant VSG (which comprises 5–10% of the total protein of the organism (38Turner M.J. Br. Med. Bull. 1985; 41: 137-143Google Scholar)) compared with those encoding TbMSP-A was found to be about 150:1. RNAi Silencing of the TbMSP-B Family in Procyclic and Bloodstream T. brucei—Because TbMSP-B expression occurs in both procyclic and bloodstream trypanosomes, the resulting protein product likely serves a function(s) needed by trypanosomes during both of these developmental stages. In contrast, TbMSP-A and -C play roles required only during the bloodstream stage because their expression was detected only in bloodstream organisms. We conducted the experiments described here to examine the function(s) of the constitutively expressed TbMSP-B family. To test the possibility that this function(s) is needed for the growth of procyclic and bloodstream trypanosomes, we employed the technique of RNA interference to deplete both developmental stages of TbMSP-B mRNA. RNAi is a potent method for “knocking down” expression of specific genes in African trypanosomes and other eukaryotes (39Ngo H. Tschudi C. Ullu E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14687-14692Google Scholar, 40Fire A. Xu S. Montgomery M.K. Kostas S.A. Driver S.E. Mello C.C. Nature. 1998; 391: 806-811Google Scholar, 41Hannon G.J. Nature. 2002; 418: 244-251Google Scholar). The method relies on the presence of double-stranded RNA bearing at least part of the targeted mRNA sequence, which in turn triggers a cascade of events still being elucidated that results in degradation of mRNA (41Hannon G.J. Nature. 2002; 418: 244-251Google Scholar). A 1-kb segment of the 5′ coding region of a representative TbMSP-B was PCR-amplified and inserted between opposing T7 promoters in the plasmid p2T7Ti (42LaCount D.J. Barrett B. Donelson J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17580-17588Google Scholar). Two tetracycline operator sequences located downstream of the T7 promoters confer tetracycline-responsive double-stranded RNA expression. The resulting plasmid p2T7Ti/TbMSP-B was linearized with NotI and was transfected into the cultured T. brucei procyclic cell line 29-13 and the cultured T. brucei bloodstream single marker line, both of which constitutively expressed T7 RNA polymerase and the tetracycline repressor (43Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Google Scholar). NotI linearization of the plasmid exposes ribosomal DNA spacer sequences at each end, facilitating integration of the plasmid at a ribosomal DNA spacer region of the genome. Transfected cells bearing the integrated plasmid were selected based upon resistance to bleomycin, and cell clones from each transfection were obtained by serial dilution. Fig. 3 shows Northern blots of RNAs from two cloned procyclic cell lines (clones F2 and F6) and two cloned bloodstream cell lines (clones A1 and A4) before and after tetracycline induction of TbMSP-B RNAi. As a control, RNAs also were examined from procyclic and bloodstream trypanosome clones containing integrated p2T7Ti/GFP, from which RNAi directed against the green fluorescent protein (GFP), a non-trypanosome protein, can be induced (clone D2). The results show that tetracycline induction of TbMSP-B RNAi diminishes the amount of TbMSP-B mRNA in both procyclic clones F2 and F6 and in bloodstream clones A1 and A4. As expected, tetracycline induction of GFP RNAi in the procyclic and bloodstream D2 clones does not significantly affect the TbMSP-B mRNA level. The filters were stripped and reprobed with the tubulin coding region to confirm that the same amounts of RNA were loaded in each lane. The growth of the cloned TbMSP-B and GFP RNAi cell lines in culture in the absence or continuous presence of tetracycline was examined over a 6- to 7-day period (Fig. 4). Tetracycline induction of RNAi against TbMSP-B or GFP (control) had no significant effect on the growth rate in culture of either procyclic or bloodstream trypanosomes. Thus, diminishing the amount of TbMSP-B mRNA does not affect the growth of either procyclic or bloodstream T. brucei in culture, suggesting that TbMSP-B protein is not essential for cultured growth of either developmental stage. Inhibition of VSG Release from Transgenic Procyclic T. brucei after Induction of RNAi against TbMSP-B—A distinctive feature of T. brucei is that its procyclic and bloodstream stages are each coated with about 107 copies of a GPI-anchored protein that is the predominant protein exposed on the organism's surface at that developmental stage. The outer membrane of procyclic trypanosomes is covered with an invariant protein, of which there are two forms, EP-procyclin and GPEET-procyclin, named for amino acid repeats in their C termini (EP-procyclin has 22–30 Glu-Pro repeats, and GPEET-procyclin has 5–6 Gly-Pro-Glu-Glu-Thr repeats followed by 3 EP repeats (44Roditi I. Clayton C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 103: 99-100Google Scholar, 45Roditi I. Furger A. Ruepp S. Schurch N. Butikofer P. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 117-130Google Scholar, 46Hotz H.R. Biebinger S. Flaspohler J. Clayton C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1998; 91: 131-143Google Scholar)). In contrast, the outer membrane of bloodstream trypanosomes is covered with a VSG that periodically switches as individual trypanosomes within the trypanosome population endeavor to keep one step ahead of the host's immune system (for review, see Ref. 47Borst P. Ulbert S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 17-27Google Scholar). In both life cycle stages, the GPI-anchored surface protein constitutes as much as 5–10% of the total cellular protein, placing a large burden on the cell's mechanisms for protein secretion and surface protein turnover. We have developed previously a model system for the study of these secretory and turnover pathways in which procyclic trypanosomes constitutively express a full-length transgenic VSG (36Bangs J.D. Ransom D.M. McDowell M.A. Brouch E.M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4285-4294Google Scholar). The transgenic VSG is transported to the cell surface, where it is released to the medium in a truncated form by an endoproteolysis that is inhibited by several known metalloprotease inhibitors, consistent with the possibility that a TbMSP might be involved in the process (37Bangs J.D. Ransom D.M. Nimick M. Christie G. Hooper N.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2001; 114: 111-117Google Scholar). To test the possibility that TbMSP-B, i.e. the only TbMSP expressed in procyclic cells, contributes to this release process, a procyclic TbMSP-B RNAi cell line (clone F2) was engineered to express constitutively full-length VSG117 (see “Experimental Procedures”). An equivalent procyclic TbMSP-A RNAi cell line (clone A1) expressing VSG117 was generated as a specificity control. Induction of TbMSP-A RNAi has no effect on procyclic TbMSP-B mRNA levels, cell viability, or growth. 3D. J. LaCount and J. E. Donelson, unpublished observations.

https://openalex.org/W2021360741,"Alkaline phosphatase (AP) from Escherichia coli as well as APs from many other organisms exist in a dimeric quaternary structure. Each monomer contains an active site located 32 Å away from the active site in the second subunit. Indirect evidence has previously suggested that the monomeric form of AP is inactive. Molecular modeling studies indicated that destabilization of the dimeric interface should occur if Thr-59, located near the 2-fold axis of symmetry, were replaced by a sterically large and charged residue such as arginine. The T59R enzyme was constructed and characterized by sucrose-density gradient sedimentation, size-exclusion chromatography, and circular dichroism (CD) and compared with the previously constructed T59A enzyme. The T59A enzyme was found to exist as a dimer, whereas the T59R enzyme was found to exist as a monomer. The T59A, T59R, and wild-type APs exhibited almost identical secondary structures as judged by CD. The T59R monomeric AP has a melting temperature (Tm) of 43 °C, whereas the wild-type AP dimer has a Tm of 97 °C. The catalytic activity of the T59R enzyme was reduced by 104-fold, whereas the T59A enzyme exhibited an activity similar to that of the wild-type enzyme. The T59A and wild-type enzymes contained similar levels of zinc and magnesium, whereas the T59R enzyme has almost undetectable amounts of tightly bound metals. These results suggest that a significant conformational change occurs upon dimerization, which enhances thermal stability, metal binding, and catalysis.

The T59A and wild-type enzymes contained similar levels of zinc and magnesium, whereas the T59R enzyme has almost undetectable amounts of tightly bound metals. These results suggest that a significant conformational change occurs upon dimerization, which enhances thermal stability, metal binding, and catalysis. In some oligomeric proteins, the isolated monomeric subunits must be assembled before the protein becomes functional. Such behavior is exemplified by studies on homodimeric chorismate mutase (1MacBeath G. Kast P. Hilvert D. Science. 1998; 279: 1958-1961Google Scholar) and the trimeric catalytic subunit of aspartate transcarbamoylase (2Wente S.R. Schachman H.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 31-35Google Scholar). In both of these enzymes, the active site contains residues donated from neighboring chains, and each active site is located at the interface between subunits. The reasons for obligatory subunit association are less obvious for enzymes that do not have a shared active site or exhibit allosteric control and regulation. For example, triosephosphate isomerase (3Borchert T.V. Abagyan R. Jaenicke R. Wierenga R.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1515-1518Google Scholar, 4Schliebs W. Thanki N. Jaenicke R. Wierenga R.K. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9655-9662Google Scholar) and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase A (5Ottosen M.B. Bjornberg O. Norager S. Larsen S. Palfey B.A. Jensen K.F. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2575-2583Google Scholar) are both dimeric enzymes that have active sites in which all the catalytically important residues are derived from a single polypeptide chain. Nevertheless, monomeric mutants of triose-phosphate isomerase and dihydroorotate dehydrogenase A were found to lack structural stability and to exhibit the absence or reduction of activity. A monomeric form of a dimeric enzyme that contains an unshared active site in each subunit, Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase (phosphomonoester hydrolase (EC 3.1.3.1)), is characterized in this study. Alkaline phosphatase is a homodimeric metalloenzyme, which hydrolyzes phosphomonoesters into inorganic phosphate and the corresponding alcohol. The dimer contains two active sites, located 32 Å apart, each of which accommodates a magnesium and two zinc ions (6Sowadski J.M. Handschumacher M.D. Murthy H.M.K. Foster B.A. Wyckoff H.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 186: 417-433Google Scholar). It has been determined that all three metals play a role in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme (7Stec B. Holtz K.M. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1303-1311Google Scholar). Dimerization of the AP 1The abbreviations used are: AP, alkaline phosphatase; CD, circular dichroism. monomer occurs spontaneously upon the addition of metals, whereas AP will not dimerize in the absence of metals (8Schlesinger M.J. Barrett K. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 4284-4292Google Scholar, 9Falk M.C. Bethune J.L. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1471-1478Google Scholar). The two monomers of AP are held together by an extensive network of hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions along the interface. The interface of each subunit is composed of 86 amino acids, encompasses 20% of the protein, 2900 Å2 of surface area, and is comprised of a secondary structure of four α-helices and three β-strands (7Stec B. Holtz K.M. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1303-1311Google Scholar). Analysis of the interface using the most recent high resolution (1.75 Å) structure of AP as the basis (7Stec B. Holtz K.M. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1303-1311Google Scholar) reveals that there are 26 hydrogen-bonding interactions occurring among the residues of the interface. It was suggested in 1965 that these interface interactions of the AP dimer alter the tertiary structure of each subunit upon dimer formation in a manner that allows the metals to bind, creating the functional active site (10Schlesinger M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 4293-4298Google Scholar). Monomers of the wild-type enzyme have been obtained through a variety of techniques such as thiol reduction in the presence of urea (11Levinthal C. Signer E.R. Fetherolf K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1962; 48: 1230-1237Google Scholar), acid treatment (12Schlesinger M.J. Levinthal C. J. Mol. Biol. 1963; 7: 1-12Google Scholar), metal chelation, followed by incubation in 5% formamide (9Falk M.C. Bethune J.L. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1471-1478Google Scholar), or by isolation of matrix bound monomers (13McCracken S. Meighen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 2396-2404Google Scholar). However, the characterization of these monomeric forms of E. coli AP have been conducted under very specialized conditions. Therefore, to understand better the functional role of the dimerization process in E. coli AP, a monomeric version of the enzyme was rationally designed by altering a single amino acid side chain in the monomer-monomer interface. A stable monomeric version of the protein allowed a more direct comparison between the properties of the monomer and those of the wild-type dimeric form under benign buffer conditions. Materials—Agar, agarose, ampicillin, p-nitrophenyl phosphate, magnesium chloride, and zinc sulfate were purchased from Sigma. Tris, sucrose, and enzyme-grade ammonium sulfate were supplied by ICN Biomedicals (Costa Mesa, CA). Tryptone and yeast extract were obtained from Difco Laboratories (Detroit, MI). DNA sequencing was carried out by Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Molecular Medicine Unit. The oligonucleotides required for site-specific mutagenesis and sequencing were obtained from Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA). Plasmids were isolated and purified using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep kit purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Strains and Plasmids—E. coli K12 strain MV1190 (Δ(lac-proAB), supE, thi, Δ(sri-recA) 306::Tn10(tetr)/F′ traD36, proAB, lacIq, lacZΔM15) was obtained from J. Messing. E. coli K12 strain SM547 (Δ(phoA-phoC), phoR, tsx::Tn5, Δlac, galK, galU, leu, strr) was a gift from H. Inouye. The mutations were constructed in plasmid pEK154, which contains the wild-type phoA gene and its natural promoter in pUC119. This plasmid was derived from plasmid pEK48 (14Chaidaroglou A. Brezinski J.D. Middleton S.A. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8338-8343Google Scholar) by removal of an 882-base pair BstEII-XhoI fragment followed by treatment with T4 DNA ligase after the sticky ends had been filled out with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase. Plasmid pEK381 has the T59A mutation in the phoA gene introduced into pEK154 (15Martin D.C. Pastra-Landis S.C. Kantrowitz E.R. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1152-1159Google Scholar). Construction of a Plasmid for the Expression of the T59R Alkaline Phosphatase—The T59R mutation was induced in the phoA gene contained in the plasmid pEK154 using the procedures outlined by Stratagene in the QuikChange mutagenesis kit protocol. The entire gene was sequenced to ensure that the correct mutation was present and to confirm that no other mutations had been introduced. The final plasmid containing the T59R mutation in the phoA gene was designated pEK618. Modeling Studies—All molecular modeling studies were carried out using the program QUANTA, and energy minimization was accomplished using X-PLOR (16Brünger A.T. X-PLOR Version 3.1: a System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992Google Scholar). The 1.75-Å wild-type AP Protein Data Bank structure 1ED8 (7Stec B. Holtz K.M. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1303-1311Google Scholar) was used as the base structure. Protein Expression—SM547, an E. coli strain with the wild-type phoA gene deleted from the chromosome and a mutation in the phoR regulatory gene, was used as the host strain for expression of the wild-type and mutant AP. The deletion of the phoA gene ensures that no alkaline phosphatase can be produced in the absence of a phoA-containing plasmid present in the host strain. Protein Purification—The wild-type, T59R, and T59A enzymes were isolated from the periplasmic space by osmotic shock and ammonium sulfate precipitation by the methods previously described (14Chaidaroglou A. Brezinski J.D. Middleton S.A. Kantrowitz E.R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8338-8343Google Scholar). Final purification was carried out on a Bio-Rad BioLogic HR system using a Q-Sepharose Fast Flow column (1.6 × 10 cm). A 200-ml gradient from 0 to 0.1 m NaCl in TMZP buffer (0.01 m Tris-HCl, 0.001 m MgCl2, 10–5m ZnSO4, 10–4m NaH2PO4, 0.31 × 10–2m NaN3, pH 7.4) was used to elute the protein. The purity of the enzyme was determined by SDS-PAGE (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar). Determination of the Protein Concentration—The concentration of the wild-type enzyme was determined by absorbance measurements at 278 nm with an extinction coefficient of 0.71 cm2/mg (18Plocke D.J. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1962; 1: 1039-1043Google Scholar). The concentration of the mutant enzymes was determined by the Bio-Rad version of Bradford's dye binding assay (19Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Google Scholar) using wild-type alkaline phosphatase as the standard. Determination of the Enzymatic Activity—Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured spectrophotometrically utilizing p-nitrophenyl phosphate as the substrate at 25 °C by monitoring the release of p-nitrophenolate at 410 nm (20Garen A. Levinthal C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1960; 38: 470-483Google Scholar) in 1 m Tris buffer, pH 8.0. Sucrose-density Gradient Centrifugation—Sedimentation coefficients of the mutant enzymes were determined by sucrose-density gradient centrifugation. A 4.6-ml gradient of 6–25% sucrose in 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, was used. After preparation, 200 μl of ∼5 mg/ml protein solution was carefully layered on top of the gradient. The tubes were spun at 170,000 × g for 18 h using a Beckman SW 55Ti rotor in a Beckman L-70 centrifuge. The gradients were fractionated using a Brandel BR-9620 fractionator. A 50% sucrose, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin solution was slowly pumped from the fractionator to a UV detector (Gilson Model 112) in order to monitor changes in absorbance. The increase in absorbance, due to the bovine serum albumin, was used to determine the end of the gradient collection. Calibration was accomplished using carbonic anhydrase, bovine serum albumin, and wild-type AP as standards. Size-exclusion Chromatography—Gel filtration chromatography was carried out on a Bio-Rad BioLogic HR system using a Bio-Rad Bio-Prep SE 100/17 column. The column was eluted with 40 mm NaH2PO4 buffer, pH 8.0, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and calibrated using as standards bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, chymotrypsin A, cytochrome c, and rabbit muscle aldolase, which have known Stokes radii of 3.55, 3.05, 2.09, 1.70, and 4.81 nm, respectively. Thermal Stability—An Aviv circular dichroism spectrometer model 202 was used to obtain CD spectra from 195 to 300 nm and determine Tm curves for the wild-type and mutant alkaline phosphatases. All experiments were carried out using 2 ml of ∼0.04 mg/ml enzyme in 10 mm KH2PO4 buffer, pH 8.0. For the Tm experiments, the CD signal at 222 nm was monitored as the temperature increased in 1 °C intervals from 25 to 100 °C. The sample was allowed to equilibrate at each temperature for 1 min before the CD signal was measured. Determination of Metal Content—A PerkinElmer 3100 atomic absorption spectrometer was used to determine the metal content of the enzymes. Before analysis, the enzyme samples were dialyzed against metal-free 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 8.0, at 4 °C for 6 h. Enzyme solutions of ∼5 mg/ml were aspirated into the flame at a rate of 1 ml/min and compared with magnesium chloride and zinc sulfate standards. Design of a Monomeric Alkaline Phosphatase—The most appropriate mutation for destabilization of dimeric AP was determined through molecular modeling studies. When a Thr to Arg mutation was introduced at position 59 in the AP structure (Protein Data Bank number 1ED8) using the program QUANTA and subsequently minimized using X-PLOR, large movements of the protein backbone around the location of the amino acid substitution were required to accommodate the mutation, suggesting that the physical mutation may interfere with dimer formation. Quaternary Structure of the T59A and T59R Alkaline Phosphatases—The quaternary structure of the T59A and T59R enzymes was determined by both sucrose-density gradient sedimentation and size-exclusion chromatography. The sedimentation patterns of the wild-type and T59A enzymes are virtually identical (Fig. 1) indicating that they have the same dimeric quaternary structure. The sedimentation pattern of the T59R enzyme exhibited no species migrating as a dimer; rather a slower migrating species was observed. The sedimentation coefficients of the T59A and T59R enzymes were 6.1 and 3.6 S, respectively. Based upon these sedimentation coefficients, it can be inferred that the T59A enzyme migrates as a dimer and the T59R enzyme migrates as a monomer. Size-exclusion chromatography was used to determine the Stokes radius of the T59R, T59A, and wild-type enzymes. The elution profiles for the T59A and wild-type enzymes were very similar with nearly identical retention times. However, the T59R enzyme eluted with a longer retention time. These results further support the proposal of a dimeric structure for the T59A enzyme and a monomeric structure for the T59R enzyme. Based upon these experiments, the Stokes radii of the wild-type, the T59A, and the T59R were determined to be 3.41, 3.35, and 2.93 nm, respectively. An estimate of molecular mass can be determined from the sedimentation coefficient and Stokes radius (21Ohashi T. Erickson H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14220-14226Google Scholar). The calculated molecular mass for both the wild-type and T59A enzymes was 87,000 daltons, whereas the T59R had a molecular mass of 44,000 daltons, again indicating that the T59R enzyme is monomeric. Kinetic Characterization of the T59R Alkaline Phosphatase— The T59R AP had substantially reduced activity compared with the wild-type enzyme. Although the activity of the T59R AP was 104-fold lower than that of the wild-type enzyme, it was still considerably higher than that observed for the noncatalyzed reaction. To rule out the possibility that the observed activity was due to the formation of trace amounts of the more active dimeric form, the effects of protein concentration on the specific activity were measured. Over more than a 200-fold range of protein concentration (0.0019 to 0.39 mg/ml), the specific activity was found to be virtually unaltered. The lack of a concentration dependence of the specific activity is indicative of the absence of any monomer-dimer equilibrium occurring for the T59R enzyme. As seen in Table I, the kinetic parameters for the wild-type and T59A enzymes are similar. However, the kcat of the T59R enzyme is reduced by more than 35,000-fold as compared with the wild-type enzyme.Table IKinetic parameters for the wild-type and modified enzymes at pH 8.0EnzymekcataThe kcat values are calculated from the Vmax using a dimer molecular weight of 94,000 (35) for wild type and T59A and a monomer molecular weight of 47,000 for T59R.Kmkcat/Kms-1μM-1M-1 s-1Wild-type74.7 ± 1.221.8 ± 1.83.4 × 106T59AbThe values for the T59A enzyme were reported previously (15).56.3 ± 3.824.9 ± 2.42.3 × 106T59R2.12 (± 0.05) × 10-439.2 ± 4.45.4a The kcat values are calculated from the Vmax using a dimer molecular weight of 94,000 (35Bradshaw R.A.

Open table in a new tab Influence of Metals on the Activity of T59R Alkaline Phosphatase—Two different sets of measurements were performed to determine whether increased amounts of Zn2+ and/or Mg2+ altered the kinetic properties of the T59R AP. First, the activity of the T59R AP was determined in the presence of Zn2+ and/or Mg2+ at up to 100-fold higher concentrations than normally used for the wild-type enzyme. In the second set of experiments, the T59R AP was incubated with 10 mm Zn2+ (1000-fold higher concentration than normally used) at 25 °C and 37 °C for 4 h before the activity measurements were performed. The T59R AP in TMZP and in metal-free 0.01 m Tris, pH 8.0, buffer was incubated with Zn2+ followed by activity measurements in 1 m Tris, pH 8.0, with 1000 μmp-nitrophenyl phosphate as the substrate. The activity of the T59R AP carried out in the presence of Zn2+ and Mg2+ and after incubation with 10 mm Zn2+ showed very little change in activity when compared with the activity of the untreated T59R AP. Analysis of the Mutant and Wild-type APs by Circular Dichroism—As seen in Fig. 2, the CD spectra of the T59R, T59A, and wild-type enzymes are virtually identical. Deconvolution of these CD spectra (22Bohm G. Muhr R. Jaenicke R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 191-195Google Scholar) indicates that the three enzymes have almost identical secondary structures. Each enzyme contained almost identical percentages of α-helix, β-sheet, β-turn, and random coil. CD was also used to determine the thermal stability of the wild-type and mutant enzymes by monitoring the temperature-dependent change in ellipticity at 222 nm. The Tm curves for the T59A, T59R, and wild-type enzymes are shown in Fig. 3. The T59A enzyme exhibits a Tm of ∼92 °C, about 5 °C lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. However, the T59R mutation induced a dramatic effect on thermal stability. The Tm for the T59R enzyme was 43 °C, significantly lower than the 97 °C observed for the wild-type enzyme. These data clearly indicate that the T59R mutation has a dramatic effect on the thermal stability of the enzyme, whereas the T59A mutation has almost no influence on the thermal stability. Metal Content of the Wild-type and Mutant Enzymes— Atomic absorption was used to determine the metal content of the wild-type and mutant enzymes. This experiment provides data only on tightly bound metals, because the enzyme is dialyzed in metal-free buffer in preparation for the experimental determination. The wild-type and T59A enzymes were found to have ∼3.4 mol of zinc and 2.0 and 1.5 mol of magnesium per mol of enzyme, respectively. The atomic absorption analysis indicated that there were only trace levels of both magnesium and zinc in the T59R enzyme. These results indicate that either the T59R enzyme does not bind zinc or magnesium or that it binds these metals so weakly that the dialysis step used in the preparation of the enzyme removes them. The two active sites in the dimeric E. coli alkaline phosphatase are ∼32 Å apart. Because no active site residues are contributed from the adjacent subunit, no obvious requirement exists for obligatory dimerization. Yet mutants of the E. coli enzyme have been isolated that exhibit intergenic complementation. A heterodimeric form of the enzyme, containing different mutations in the two subunits, exhibits significantly higher activity than would be expected based upon the activity of the homodimeric species used to create the hybrid enzymes (12Schlesinger M.J. Levinthal C. J. Mol. Biol. 1963; 7: 1-12Google Scholar, 23Fan D.P. Schlesinger M.J. Torriani A. Barrett K.J. Levinthal C. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 15: 32-48Google Scholar, 24Garen A. Garen S. J. Mol.

Biol. 1963; 28: 539-542Google Scholar). This observed intergenic complementation suggests that the formation of the dimer interface may result in structural alterations that influence activity. Although most APs have quaternary structures that are dimeric or higher order aggregrates of dimers, there are a few APs reported to be monomeric, such as ones from Pyrococcus abyssi (27Zappa S. Rolland J.-L. Flament D. Gueguen Y. Boudrant J. Dietrich J. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2001; 67: 4504-4511Google Scholar), Bombyx mori (28Eguchi M. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. Part B Comp. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 111: 151-162Google Scholar), Vibrio sp. (29Hauksson J.B. Andresson O.S. Asgeirsson B. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2000; 27: 66-73Google Scholar), Bacillus intermedius (30Sharipova M.R. Balaban N.P. Mardanova A.M. Nekhotyaeva N.V. Dementyev A.A. Vershinina O.A. Garusov A.V. Leshchinskaya I.B. Biochemistry (Mosc.). 1998; 63: 1178-1182Google Scholar), and one of the two APs from Bacillus subtilis (31Hulett F.M. Bookstein C. Jensen K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 735-740Google Scholar). In some cases at least, the evidence for the monomeric nature of these APs is weak. In fact, it has recently been established that the P. abyssi AP does not exist as an active monomer although stable monomers can be isolated under certain conditions. 2S. Zappa, personal communication. Martin et al. (15Martin D.C. Pastra-Landis S.C. Kantrowitz E.R. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1152-1159Google Scholar) have attempted to disturb the dimer interface of AP using site-directed mutations that eliminated hydrogen-bonding interactions across subunits. Although some of the AP mutants were found in a detectable monomer-dimer equilibrium, none of the mutations weakened the interface sufficiently to allow the isolation of a monomer form of the enzyme. In this work, an amino acid with a bulky charged side chain was introduced into a confined area of the interface so that steric hindrance would completely destabilize the dimeric form of the enzyme. The study of a monomeric form of AP will allow us to understand better the role of the dimer interface for the function of E. coli AP. Creation of a Monomeric Alkaline Phosphatase—Modeling studies of the interface region of AP suggested a number of locations that were potential candidates for the introduction of a large, bulky, and charged side chain that would disturb the formation of the dimeric structure. One such location was Thr-59, which is near the 2-fold axis of symmetry. The replacement of Thr-59 with Arg would, therefore, place two Arg residues in the interface exactly juxtaposed to each other adding charge repulsion in addition to steric interference to destabilize the interface. Analysis of the T59R AP indicated that the mutation indeed disrupted the quaternary structure of the enzyme. The T59R enzyme was found by sucrose-density gradient sedimentation to sediment as expected for a monomer. The molecular mass of the T59R enzyme was determined to be approximately half that of the wild-type enzyme by a combination of sucrose-density gradient sedimentation and size-exclusion chromatography. Because no intermediate migrating species were observed between the positions expected for the monomer and dimer in the sucrose gradient profile of the T59R enzyme, subunit association must be completely prevented in the T59R enzyme. Unlike the T59R enzyme, the T59A AP exists as a dimer, indicating that the absence of hydrogen bonding when methyl replaced a hydroxy group was not enough to impair dimerization. In contrast, the bulky charged side chain of Arg at position 59 is sufficient to destabilize the interface and prevent dimer formation. To determine whether the T59R mutation caused monomer formation by significantly altering the secondary structure of the enzyme, circular dichroism was used to compare the T59A, T59R, and wild-type enzymes. The monomer form of the T59R enzyme retains the same overall secondary structural fold as the wild-type enzyme. The CD spectra of these three APs were almost identical, indicating that the mutations at position 59 do not significantly alter the secondary structure of the enzyme. Therefore, the loss of the ability of the T59R enzyme to dimerize is not the result of alterations in the secondary structure of the enzyme due to the mutation. Altered Properties of the Monomeric Alkaline Phosphatase— The monomer form of alkaline phosphatase generated in this work has significantly different catalytic activity and structural stability compared with the wild-type enzyme. The thermal melting profiles for the monomer, as determined by CD, indicate an enormous change in thermal stability. Considering that E. coli is not a thermophilic organism, E. coli AP is an extremely thermally stable protein for its size with a Tm of 97 °C. The more than 50 °C reduction in Tm of the monomeric T59R AP (Tm = 43 °C) indicates that the presence of the dimer interface adds tremendous structural stabilization to the native enzyme. Thus, one of the roles of the interface in E. coli AP is to provide thermal stability for the enzyme. It is interesting to note that one of the alkaline phosphatases reported to exist as a monomer was isolated from Vibrio sp. (29Hauksson J.B. Andresson O.S. Asgeirsson B. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2000; 27: 66-73Google Scholar), a psychrophile. The formation of higher order quaternary structures may well provide a general mechanism for thermal stability for AP in particular and multimeric enzymes in general. The monomeric T59R AP has severely impaired catalytic ability. In fact, the kcat of the T59R AP is 4-fold lower than that shown by mutant versions of AP in which the critical nucleophilic Ser-102 residue has been replaced by Ala or Gly (32Stec B. Hehir M.J. Brennan C. Nolte M. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 647-662Google Scholar). Even at Zn2+ concentrations 1000-fold higher than required for the wild-type enzyme, no significant increase in activity was detected. These results indicate that the low activity of the T59R AP is not simply the result of weakened binding of the metals to the active site of the enzyme. Because the T59A enzyme has almost the same kcat as the wild-type enzyme, the reduction in activity induced by the T59R mutation must be a direct result of the different quaternary structures of the T59A and T59R enzymes. The CD data, which showed that the secondary structures of the T59A, T59R, and wild-type APs were indistinguishable, support this conclusion. Two points have been made evident by these experiments. First, an intact subunit interface is absolutely required for normal catalytic function of E. coli AP. Second, stability of the subunit is greatly enhanced upon association and formation of the dimer interface. As found in earlier studies, maintenance of the structural integrity of the interface has an apparent role in dimer stabilization. In fact, the first 40 residues of the amino terminus of AP have more intersubunit contacts than intrasubunit contacts. This structural feature seems to indicate that the amino-terminal segment of the protein is important for maintaining the dimeric structure. For example, truncation of either the first 10 or 35 residues from the amino terminus greatly destabilizes the dimeric form of the E. coli enzyme and reduces the activity by 20% (8Schlesinger M.J. Barrett K. J. Biol. Chem. 1965; 240: 4284-4292Google Scholar, 33Tyler-Cross R. Roberts C.H. Chlebowski J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4523-4528Google Scholar). Both a monomeric and dimeric form of AP exists in Bacillus subtilis (31Hulett F.M. Bookstein C. Jensen K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 735-740Google Scholar, 34Hulett F.M. Kim E.E. Bookstein C. Kapp N.V. Edward C.W. Wyckoff H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1077-1084Google Scholar). The amino acid identities found between the B. subtilis AP III (dimeric) and AP IV (monomeric) and the E. coli enzyme are 33% and 34% respectively. The core and active site residues of the B. subtilis enzymes are well conserved when compared with E. coli AP. However, in contrast, the interface residues of the B. subtilis APs are far less conserved when compared with E. coli AP. Another notable difference in the sequence alignment between the two B. subtilis and E. coli APs is residue 59 (E. coli numbering) (34Hulett F.M. Kim E.E. Bookstein C. Kapp N.V. Edward C.W. Wyckoff H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1077-1084Google Scholar). In the E. coli enzyme, residue 59 is a Thr; and in the dimeric B. subtilis AP, the corresponding residue is a Ser; whereas in the monomeric B. subtilis AP, the residue is Arg. The monomeric T59R E. coli enzyme, therefore, can be compared with that of the monomeric B. subtilis enzyme where the sequence-aligned residue at position 59 is Arg. These comparisons taken together suggest that dimerization of the monomeric form of B. subtilis AP and of E. coli T59R AP may not occur because the Arg side chain sterically hinders intersubunit interactions. This work has elucidated aspects of the functional and structural role of the AP interface, such as the requirement for interfacial interactions, which are critical for the formation of a catalytically functional active site pocket. The monomeric T59R AP bound insignificant amounts of magnesium or zinc, which are required in the proposed catalytic mechanism of wild-type AP (7Stec B. Holtz K.M. Kantrowitz E.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 1303-1311Google Scholar). Because interfacial interactions are absent in the T59R monomer, the active site pocket remains impaired, and this effect is reflected in the exceedingly low enzymatic activity. However, the loss of the interface interactions and incomplete formation of an active site pocket do not affect the secondary structure, yet they influence the overall folding stability. These findings suggest that the interfacial interactions of AP not only strengthen the protein fold of AP but also align the residues in the active sites that are required for optimum metal-binding and phosphatase activity.

https://openalex.org/W2099857213,"Ubiquinone (coenzyme Q; Q) is a key factor in the mitochondria electron transport chain, but it also functions as an antioxidant and as a cofactor of mitochondrial uncoupling proteins. Furthermore, Q isoforms balance in Caenorhabditis elegans is determined by both dietary intake and endogenous biosynthesis. In the absence of synthesis, withdrawal of dietary Q8 in adulthood extends life span. Thus, Q plays an important role in the aging process and understanding its synthesis acquires a new impetus. We have identified by RNA interference (RNAi) eight genes, including clk-1, involved in ubiquinone biosynthesis in C. elegans feeding animals with dsRNA-containing Escherichia coli HT115 strains. Silenced C. elegans showed lower levels of both endogenous Q9 and Q8 provided by diet, produced less superoxide without a significant modification of mitochondrial electron chain, and extended life span compared with non-interfered animals. E. coli strains harboring dsRNA also interfered with their own Q8 biosynthesis. These findings suggest that more efficient electron transport between a lower amount of Q and electron transport capacity of the mitochondrial complexes leads to less production of reactive oxygen species that contributes to extension of life span in the nematode C. elegans."
https://openalex.org/W2014092356,"The procoagulant function of activated factor V (FVa) is inhibited by activated protein C (APC) through proteolytic cleavages at Arg306, Arg506, and Arg679. The effect of APC is potentiated by negatively charged phospholipid membranes and the APC cofactor protein S. Protein S has been reported to selectively stimulate cleavage at Arg306, an effect hypothesized to be related to reorientation of the active site of APC closer to the phospholipid membrane. To investigate the importance of protein S and phospholipid in the APC-mediated cleavages of individual sites, recombinant FV variants FV(R306Q/R679Q) and FV(R506Q/R679Q) (can be cleaved only at Arg506 and Arg306, respectively) were created. The cleavage rate was determined for each cleavage site in the presence of varied protein S concentrations and phospholipid compositions. In contrast to results on record, we found that protein S stimulated both APC cleavages in a phospholipid composition-dependent manner. Thus, on vesicles containing both phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine, protein S increased the rate of Arg306 cleavage 27-fold and that of Arg506 cleavage 5-fold. Half-maximal stimulation was obtained at ∼30 nm protein S for both cleavages. In conclusion, we demonstrate that APC-mediated cleavages at both Arg306 and Arg506 in FVa are stimulated by protein S in a phospholipid composition-dependent manner.

Activated factor V (FVa) 1The abbreviations used are: FVa, activated factor V; FXa, activated factor X; FV, factor V; APC, activated protein C; PS, phosphatidylserine; PE, phosphatidylethanolamine; PC, phosphatidylcholine. is a procoagulant cofactor to activated factor X (FXa) in the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin (1Butenas S.

The procoagulant function of FVa is down-regulated by the anticoagulant serine protease activated protein C (APC) (2Dahlbäck B. Lancet. 2000; 355: 1627-1632Google Scholar, 4Esmon C.T. Ding W. Yasuhiro K. Gu J.M. Ferrell G. Regan L.M. Stearns-Kurosawa D.J. Kurosawa S. Mather T. Laszik Z. Esmon N.L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 70-74Google Scholar). APC cleaves FVa at three sites, Arg306, Arg506, and Arg679 (5Kalafatis M. Rand M.D. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31869-31880Google Scholar). The Arg506 site is kinetically most favored, and cleavage results in decreased affinity for FXa and partial loss of procoagulant activity (6Nicolaes G.A. Tans G. Thomassen M.C. Hemker H.C. Pabinger I. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Rosing J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21158-21166Google Scholar). Cleavage at Arg306 impairs the procoagulant function more severely, and the combined cleavage at Arg306 and Arg506 results in the dissociation of the A2 fragment and complete loss of FVa activity (7Mann K.G. Hockin M.F. Begin K.J. Kalafatis M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20678-20683Google Scholar). The role of the Arg679 cleavage in the regulation of FVa activity is not fully elucidated, but appears to be of minor importance. Recently, we found that, in the presence of protein S, the Arg679 cleavage might play a role in the degradation of naturally occurring FVa variants that are mutated at Arg306, such as FV Cambridge and FV Hong Kong (8Norstrøm E. Thorelli E. Dahlbäck B. Blood. 2002; 100: 524-530Google Scholar). Efficient inactivation of FVa by APC requires the presence of negatively charged phospholipids, with phosphatidylserine (PS) being the most potent stimulator of the APC cleavage of FVa (9Bakker H.M. Tans G. Janssen-Claessen T. Thomassen M.C. Hemker H.C. Griffin J.H. Rosing J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 171-178Google Scholar). In addition, incorporation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) into the phospholipid membrane has been found to enhance the inactivation of FVa by APC (10Smirnov M.D. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 816-819Google Scholar). This was proposed to be a selective effect on the FVa inactivation because the effect of PE on the APC cleavage of FVa was more pronounced than what had been reported for other coagulation complexes (11Smeets E.F. Comfurius P. Bevers E.M. Zwaal R.F. Thromb. Res. 1996; 81: 419-426Google Scholar, 12Neuenschwander P.F. Bianco-Fisher E. Rezaie A.R. Morrissey J.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13988-13993Google Scholar). Other membrane components that have been reported to increase the efficiency of APC cleavage of FVa include cardiolipin and glycolipids (13Fernandez J.A. Kojima K. Petaja J. Hackeng T.M. Griffin J.H. Blood Cells Mol. Dis. 2000; 26: 115-123Google Scholar, 14Deguchi H. Fernandez J.A. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8861-8865Google Scholar). The phospholipid membrane fluidity, which is determined by the presence of polyunsaturated fatty acids, also affects FVa inactivation, with increased degradation being seen at higher degrees of polyunsaturation (15Smirnov M.D. Ford D.A. Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3591-3598Google Scholar). Lipid oxidation is also associated with an increased rate of FVa inactivation (16Safa O. Hensley K. Smirnov M.D. Esmon C.T. Esmon N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1829-1836Google Scholar). So far, studies on how the individual FVa cleavage sites are affected by the membrane composition have not been performed. Protein S works as a cofactor to APC in the degradation of FVa (17Walker F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5521-5524Google Scholar). It has been reported that protein S selectively enhances the APC-mediated cleavage at Arg306, whereas it has no effect on cleavage at Arg506 (18Rosing J. Hoekema L. Nicolaes G.A. Thomassen M.C. Hemker H.C. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Tans G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27852-27858Google Scholar). The mechanism by which protein S works as a cofactor for APC and the molecular background for the selective stimulation of the Arg306 cleavage are not fully understood. Protein S has been shown to stimulate APC binding to the phospholipid surface (19Walker F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11128-11131Google Scholar). Moreover, protein S has been shown to decrease the distance of the active site of APC from the membrane surface, an effect that is speculated to be related to the selective stimulation of the Arg306 cleavage (20Yegneswaran S. Smirnov M.D. Safa O. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5462-5468Google Scholar). Another suggested function of protein S is to annihilate the FXa-mediated protection of FVa against APC degradation (21Solymoss S. Tucker M.M. Tracy P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14884-14890Google Scholar), but this has been challenged by other groups (18Rosing J. Hoekema L. Nicolaes G.A. Thomassen M.C. Hemker H.C. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Tans G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27852-27858Google Scholar). Initially, the protein S effect was reported to be dependent on the phospholipid concentration, with protein S having no effect at saturating concentrations of phospholipids (19Walker F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11128-11131Google Scholar). Later studies have claimed that, although protein S requires the presence of negatively charged phospholipids, its effect is independent of phospholipid concentration and composition (9Bakker H.M. Tans G. Janssen-Claessen T. Thomassen M.C. Hemker H.C. Griffin J.H. Rosing J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 208: 171-178Google Scholar). The aim of this investigation was to elucidate how phospholipid membrane composition and protein S affect the individual APC cleavage sites. For this purpose, we constructed recombinant FV(R306Q/R679Q) and FV(R506Q/R679Q) variants, which can be cleaved only at Arg506 and Arg306, respectively. The FVa inactivation was monitored by a prothrombinase-based assay, and apparent second-order rate constants for the Arg306 and Arg506 cleavages were calculated. Surprisingly, we found that protein S enhanced cleavage not only at Arg306, but also at Arg506. The protein S effect was dependent on the presence of PS and stimulated by the inclusion of PE in the membrane. These results provide new insights into the importance of membrane composition for APC-mediated degradation of FVa and the mechanism of protein S activity.

Phospholipid Vesicle Preparation—The phospholipid stocks were dissolved in 10:90 methanol/chloroform solution, and the concentrations were determined by phosphate analysis (27Fiske C.H. SubbaRow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 374-389Google Scholar). Mixtures of the lipids (weight-based) were prepared in 10:90 methanol/chloroform and kept at –20 °C. Aliquots were taken from the stocks, dried under N2, and then resuspended in Hepes at room temperature. Phospholipids for the prothrombinase assay were sonicated in a Misonix XL 2020 sonicator at amplitude 3 for 10 min. Fresh phospholipid vesicles were prepared every day. For the inactivation assay, extruded phospholipid vesicles were used to avoid heterogeneity in the size of the vesicles (10Smirnov M.D. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 816-819Google Scholar). The extrusion was performed using a LiposoFast basic extruder (Armatis, Mannheim, Germany) as described (28MacDonald R.C. MacDonald R.I. Menco B.P. Takeshita K. Subbarao N.K. Hu L.R. Biochim.

The phospholipid mixtures dissolved in buffer were subjected to freeze-thaw circles and subsequently extruded 19 times through a membrane with a 100-nm pore size. The extruded phospholipids were used for 2 days. Expression and Quantification of Recombinant FV Variants—The recombinant FV(R306Q/R679Q) and FV(R506Q/R679Q) variants were constructed as previously described (8Norstrøm E. Thorelli E. Dahlbäck B. Blood. 2002; 100: 524-530Google Scholar). The recombinant proteins were transiently expressed in COS-1 cells using the DEAE-dextran transfection method (29Kaufman R.J. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 487-511Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, FV cDNA in the pMT2 vector was mixed with Tris (pH 7.3), 0.1 mm chloroquine, and DEAE-dextran in Dulbecco's modified essential medium (Invitrogen, Paisley, Scotland) and incubated for 4 h. The cells were thereafter shocked with 10% Me2SO for 2 min. The proteins were harvested in serum-free medium (Opti-MEM) 60–70 h after transfection and concentrated in Vivaspin with a molecular weight cutoff of 100,000. Aliquots were frozen at –80 °C. The concentrations of the recombinant proteins were determined by both enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and prothrombinase assay. The FV-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed as described (8Norstrøm E. Thorelli E. Dahlbäck B. Blood. 2002; 100: 524-530Google Scholar). Partial Purification of Recombinant FVa—Conditioned medium (400 ml) from FV transfections was applied to a 25-ml Q-Sepharose fast flow column equilibrated with 25 mm Hepes and 5 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.5) (buffer A) at 4 °C. Prior to the application, the medium was first diluted three times in buffer A to lower the ionic strength, and 10 mm benzamidine was added to inhibit degradation during the purification procedure. After loading, the column was washed with 50 ml of buffer A supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 at a flow rate of 2 ml/min, followed by a wash with 70 ml of buffer A without the detergent. A 25-ml 0–1 m NH4Cl gradient in buffer A was applied at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and the fractions were screened for FVa activity with the prothrombinase assay. The buffer in the peak fractions was exchanged with 25 mm Hepes and 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.7) with 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 5 mm CaCl2 (buffer B) using a PD-10 column. The phospholipid content before and after purification was measured with a phospholipid B kit (Wako Bioproducts), which detects choline-containing phospholipids. Prothrombinase Assay—To determine the activity of FVa, a prothrombinase-based assay was used as described (8Norstrøm E. Thorelli E. Dahlbäck B. Blood. 2002; 100: 524-530Google Scholar). Briefly, a mixture of 0.5 μm prothrombin and 50 μm phospholipid vesicles (10:90 (w/w) PS/PC) was prepared in 25 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.7) containing 0.5 mg/ml ovalbumin. FV was activated by thrombin (final concentration of 0.5 units/ml) at 37 °C for 10 min. FXa (final concentrations of 5 nm for FVa(R506Q/R679Q) and 0.05 nm for FVa(R306Q/R679Q)) and the FVa samples were added to the prothrombinase mixture; and after 2 min, the prothrombin activation was stopped by 40-fold dilution in ice-cold EDTA buffer (50 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, and 1% polyethylene glycol 6000 (pH 7.9)). The amount of thrombin formed was measured kinetically with S2238. FVa Inactivation Assay—FV was incubated with thrombin (0.5 units/ml) for 10 min at 37 °C in buffer B. After activation of FV, phospholipid vesicles (final concentration of 25 μm) and protein S were added, and a subsample was taken from the mixture and diluted 1:5 in ice-cold buffer B. APC was subsequently added. The amounts of APC and protein S added varied in the different experiments as indicated in the description of the individual experiments. At different time points, samples were taken from the inactivation mixture and diluted 1:5 in ice-cold buffer B to stop the reaction. The FVa activities in the diluted samples were then measured with the prothrombinase assay for the remaining FVa activity. Equations Used for Curve Fitting—Inactivation of recombinant FVa(R506Q/R679Q) and FVa(R306Q/R679Q) was followed in time to calculate pseudo first-order rates for Arg306 and Arg506 cleavages by APC, respectively. The inactivation curves obtained were fitted to an equation already reported (18Rosing J. Hoekema L. Nicolaes G.A. Thomassen M.C. Hemker H.C. Varadi K. Schwarz H.P. Tans G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27852-27858Google Scholar). The equation was modified due to the fact that only one cleavage occurs in our FV variants. For calculation of cleavage at position 506, the time curves obtained for FVa(R306Q/R679Q) were fitted to Equation 1, Vat=Va0·e−(k506)t+B·Vao(1−e−(k506)t)(Eq. 1) in which Vat is the cofactor activity determined at time t, Va0 is the cofactor activity determined before APC is added, B is the remaining procoagulant cofactor activity of FVa cleaved at position 506, and k506 is the rate constant of cleavage at position 506. The residual activity B was determined from time curves where complete cleavage at Arg506 had been accomplished, i.e. in the presence of 10:20:70 PS/PE/PC and protein S. The complete inactivation was obvious from the fact that prolonged incubation with APC did not lead to more loss of activity, i.e. the time curve leveled off at the residual FVa activity. Additionally, the validity of the B value was investigated in experiments using increasing concentrations of APC. For calculation of cleavage at position 306, Equation 2 was used, Vat=Va0·e−(k306)t+C·Va0(1−e−(k306)t)(Eq. 2) and fitted to the time curve of FVa(R506Q/R679Q). Here, C is the remaining procoagulant cofactor activity of FVa cleaved at position 306, and k306 is the rate constant of cleavage at position 306. The residual activity C was determined in a manner similar to that described above for cleavage at position 506. Use of the equations requires that the inactivation curves are independent of FVa concentration (percent FVa inactivation versus time) and that the rates are linear for APC concentration. Control experiments were performed, and the inactivation curves fulfilled these criteria. Western Blot Analysis of Recombinant FV Variants—Recombinant and plasma-derived human FV were incubated with 0.3 units/ml thrombin for 10 min at 37 °C to activate FV to FVa. FVa (final concentration of 0.8 nm) was subsequently incubated with APC (at the concentration indicated for each individual experiment) with or without 100 nm protein S in the presence of 25 μm phospholipids (10:20:70 PS/PE/PC). At different time points, the inactivation was stopped by addition of denaturing solution. The samples were run under reducing conditions on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. A monoclonal antibody against the heavy chain of FVa (AHV-5146) was used to detect the FVa fragments, and the Western blots were developed using a Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Labs, Inc., Burlingame, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. FXa Titration of APC-cleaved FVa(R306Q/R679Q) and FVa(R506Q/R679Q)—To determine the FXa concentration dependence of the residual activities of Arg306- and Arg506-cleaved FVa, a FXa titration experiment was performed using the prothrombinase assay as described (30Steen M. Dahlbäck B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38424-38430Google Scholar). Briefly, wild-type FV, FV(R506Q/R679Q), and FV(R306Q/R679Q) were activated by thrombin. FVa(R506Q/R679Q) and FVa(R306Q/R679Q) were subsequently incubated for 10 min at 37 °C with 25 μm phospholipid vesicles (10:20:70 PS/PE/PC, natural extracts) and 0.05 nm APC for FVa(R306Q/R679Q) and 0.2 nm APC plus 100 nm protein S for FVa(R506Q/R679Q). The FVa variants were subsequently diluted to a final concentration of 32 pm, and FXa was added at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 50,000 pm together with 50 μm phospholipid vesicles (10:90 PS/PC, natural extracts). The mixtures were incubated for 4 min before preheated prothrombin (0.5 μm) was added to start the thrombin generation. The reaction was stopped after 1 min by a 40-fold dilution with ice-cold EDTA buffer, and the thrombin formed was measured using S2238. Residual FVa Activity after APC Cleavage of FVa at Arg306 and Arg506—The FVa(R506Q/R679Q) and FVa(R306Q/R679Q) variants were cleaved with APC, and their residual FVa activities were determined at increasing concentrations of FXa (Fig. 1). In comparison, a FXa titration was performed using wild-type FVa. The Arg506 cleavage resulted in a molecule expressing decreased maximal FVa activity (∼70% at 20 nm FXa) as well as decreased FXa affinity (∼10-fold). After cleavage at Arg306, the FVa activity was severely impaired; and even at the highest FXa concentration, the activity was only 10–20% of the activity of uncleaved FVa. Protein S Stimulates APC-mediated Cleavages at Both Arg306 and Arg506—The time courses of APC-mediated inactivation of the recombinant FVa variants were determined using the prothrombinase-based assay to measure the remaining FVa activity (Figs. 2 and 3). As the residual FVa activities after APC cleavage of the FVa(R506Q/R679Q) and FVa(R306Q/R679Q) variants were distinct (Fig. 1), different FXa concentrations were used in the prothrombinase assays for the two FVa variants. In the case of FVa(R506Q/R679Q) (Arg306 cleavage), the FXa concentration was 5 nm, whereas the FXa concentration was reduced to 0.05 nm for FVa(R306Q/R679Q) (Arg506 cleavage). At this low FXa concentration, the remaining activity of the FVa(R306Q/R679Q) variant was ∼15%, whereas much higher activities (50–60%) were obtained at higher FXa concentrations (5 nm). The lowering of the FXa concentration made it easier to monitor the APC-mediated cleavage at Arg506 due to the larger difference in activity between cleaved and intact FVa. For the FVa(R506Q/R679Q) variant, the remaining activity after APC cleavage was quite low also at the high FXa concentration.Fig. 3APC-mediated inactivation of the FVa(R306Q/R679Q) variant. The FV(R306Q/R679Q) variant (final concentration of 0.8 nm) was incubated with 0.5 units/ml thrombin for 10 min at 37 °C. APC (final concentration of 0.05 nm) was added to the reaction mixture, which also contained 25 μm phospholipids (10:90 PS/PC (upper panel), 5:20:75 PS/PE/PC (middle panel), or 10:20:70 PS/PE/PC (lower panel)). Experiments were performed in the absence (open symbols) and presence (closed symbols) of 100 nm protein S. At intervals, samples were taken, and the FVa degradation was stopped by 1:5 dilution in ice-cold buffer B. FVa activity was measured with the prothrombinase assay. The FVa activity was related to the activity observed before the addition of APC. The plotted values represent the mean of three individual experiments; error bars represent S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To study the effect of protein S on the Arg306 cleavage, time courses of APC inactivation of the FVa(R506Q/R679Q) variant performed in the presence and absence of protein S at different phospholipid compositions were followed (Fig. 2). Because cleavage at position 306 constitutes the slow phase of FVa inactivation, a high concentration of APC (0.8 nm) was used in these experiments. The inactivation was performed in the presence of phospholipid vesicles with three different compositions, 10:90 PS/PC (Fig. 2, upper panel), 5:20:75 PS/PE/PC (middle panel), and 10:20:70 PS/PE/PC (lower panel). Under all three conditions, protein S stimulated the APC-mediated cleavage at Arg306. The rate constants that were obtained by fitting the time courses to Equation 2 are given in Table I. In the presence of 10:90 PS/PS and 5:20:75 PS/PE/PC, protein S enhanced the Arg306 cleavage to the same extent (∼8–10-fold). However, in the presence of 10:20:70 PS/PE/PC, the stimulation of the cleavage at position 306 by protein S was as high as 27-fold, indicating that the protein S effect is dependent on the composition of the membrane. The FVa degradation went to completion only when 10:20:70 PS/PE/PC was used in the presence of protein S. However, under all conditions used, cleaved FVa had the same residual FVa activity (the C value in Equation), which can be derived from the complete FVa degradation obtained when using 10:20:70 PS/PE/PC in the presence of protein S.Table IComparison of rates of cleavage at Arg306 on different phospholipid vesicles in the absence or presence of protein SPhospholipid composition (synthetic unless indicated)k306+Protein S-Protein SM-1 S-110:90 PS/PC(1.5 ± 0.3) × 106(1.5 ± 0.2) × 1055:20:75 PS/PE/PC(3 ± 0.3) × 106(3.7 ± 0.2) × 10510:20:70 PS/PE/PC(1.2 ± 0.2) × 107(4.5 ± 0.8) × 10510:20:70 PS/PE/PC (natural)1 × 1083.9 × 106 Open table in a new tab To study the effect of protein S on the APC-mediated cleavage at Arg506, the same set of phospholipid vesicles was used as for cleavage at position 306, but the APC concentration was lowered to 0.05 nm because the Arg506 cleavage is much faster than the Arg306 cleavage (Fig. 3). In contrast to results on record, protein S was found to enhance the Arg506 cleavage by APC. The protein S-dependent stimulation of the APC-mediated Arg506 cleavage was ∼3–5-fold at all three phospholipid compositions (Table II), which was lower than the stimulation observed for the Arg306 cleavage. As described for cleavage at position 306, the residual FVa activity of APC-cleaved FVa can be determined from the experiment using 10:20:70 PS/PE/PC in the presence of protein S, and this was used as the B value in Equation 1.Table IIComparison of rates of cleavage at Arg506 on different phospholipid vesicles in the absence or presence of protein SPhospholipid composition (synthetic unless indicated)k506+Protein S-Protein SM-1 S-1-PLaPhospholipid.(6.8 ± 1.4) × 105(5 ± 2) × 105100% PC(6.8 ± 0.8) × 105(6.7 ± 1.6) × 10520:80 PE/PC(8.8 ± 0.4) × 105(7.7 ± 1.2) × 10510:90 PS/PC(3.3 ± 0.2) × 107(1.1 ± 0.1) × 1075:20:75 PS/PE/PC(2.9 ± 0.5) × 107(0.8 ± 0.2) × 10710:20:70 PS/PE/PC(1.7 ± 0.3) × 108(3.7 ± 0.8) × 10710:90 PS/PC (natural)(4.6 ± 2.6) × 108(1.9 ± 1.3) × 10810:20:70 PS/PE/PC (natural)9 × 1082.7 × 108a Phospholipid. Open table in a new tab In the experiments described, we used well defined synthetic phospholipids with a 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl composition. The phospholipids that have been used to investigate FVa inactivation vary a lot between the different studies. Because no other group has reported any stimulation of the Arg506 cleavage by protein S, inactivation of FVa(R306Q/R679Q) was also performed in the presence of 10:90 PS/PC prepared from natural extracts (Fig. 4 and Table II). On these vesicles, the APC-mediated cleavage at Arg506 occurred much faster both in the presence and absence of protein S, but the potentiation exerted by protein S was still detectable. Inactivation was also followed on 10:20:70 PS/PE/PC prepared from natural phospholipid extracts for both Arg506 and Arg306 (Tables I and II). Also on these vesicles, the effect of protein S on the Arg506 cleavage was detectable, but was less prominent than on synthetic phospholipids (Table II). However, cleavage at Arg306 was still greatly enhanced by the presence of protein S (∼25-fold) (Table I). Western Blot Analysis of APC-mediated FVa Cleavage—To correlate the loss of activity according to the FVa inactivation assay with the formation of proteolytic products, aliquots were taken from the FVa inactivation mixtures and analyzed by Western blotting (Figs. 5 and Fig. 6). A monoclonal antibody against the heavy chain of FVa (epitope located between positions 307 and 506) was used in combination with a highly sensitive detection system. This allowed detection of the low amount of APC-generated fragments directly from the FVa degradation incubation mixture, even though it contained only 0.8 nm FVa. The high sensitivity of the Western blot technique also allowed detection of the small amount of uncleaved heavy chain that remained after the APC digestion. According to titration experiments in which decreasing amounts of FVa were applied to the Western blot, ∼5% of the uncleaved heavy chain (corresponding to 0.04 nm FVa) could be detected. Because the remaining uncleaved heavy chain did not express FVa activity (as determined by FXa titration as in Fig. 1), it probably had dissociated from its light chain, which would explain its resistance to APC. As the calculation of rate constants is insensitive to the concentration of FVa, the presence of this FVa species did not affect the calculated constants. In the FVa(R506Q/R679Q)-containing incubation mixtures, APC-mediated proteolysis resulted in the generation of a 60-kDa band, which corresponds to the Arg306–Arg709 fragment generated after cleavage at Arg306 (Fig. 5). In the presence of protein S, this band was clearly detected already after 0.5 min of incubation. In contrast, in the absence of protein S, this band was significantly weaker on the Western blot and occurred only at later time points.Fig. 6Western blot analysis of the APC-mediated cleavage at Arg506. Recombinant FV(R306Q/R679Q) or purified human normal FV or FV Leiden (final concentration of 0.8 nm) was incubated with thrombin for 5 min at 37 °C to activate FV, and 5 units/ml hirudin was subsequently added.

https://openalex.org/W1967969238,"Epac1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the small GTPase Rap1 that is directly activated by cAMP. This protein consists of a regulatory region with a cAMP-binding domain and a catalytic region that mediates the GEF activity. Epac is inhibited by an intramolecular interaction between the cAMP-binding domain and the catalytic region in the absence of cAMP. cAMP binding is proposed to induce a conformational change, which allows a LID, an α-helix at the C-terminal end of the cAMP-binding site, to cover the cAMP-binding site (Rehmann, H., Prakash, B., Wolf, E., Rueppel, A., de Rooij, J., Bos, J. L., and Wittinghofer, A. (2003) Nat. Struct. Biol. 10, 26–32). Here we show that mutations of conserved residues in the LID region affect cAMP binding only marginally but have a drastic effect on cAMP-induced GEF activity. Surprisingly, some of the mutants have an increased maximal GEF activity compared with wild type. Furthermore, mutation of the conserved VLVLE sequence at the C-terminal end of the LID into five alanine residues makes Epac constitutively active. From these results we conclude that the LID region plays a pivotal role in the communication between the regulatory and catalytic part of Epac.

A multitude of cellular stimuli, including hormones, growth factors, and neurotransmitters, induce activation of the Gαs subunit of heterotrimeric G-proteins, which, in turn, activates adenylyl cyclase to synthesize cyclic AMP (cAMP) from ATP. cAMP acts as a second messenger that binds to and regulates PKA 1The abbreviations used are: PKA, protein kinase A; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; Epac, exchange protein directly activated by cAMP; REM, Ras exchange motif; DEP, Dishevelled/Egal-10/pleckstrin (domain); PKG, cGMP-regulated protein kinase; mantGDP, 2′(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) guanosine diphosphate; C subunit, catalytic subunit; R subunit, regulatory subunit; CAT, catalytic domain; RD, regulatory domain; AC50, half-maximal activity. and cyclic nucleotide-dependent ion channels (1Kaupp U.B. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1995; 5: 434-442Google Scholar). More recently, cAMP-responsive guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for Rap proteins were identified, i.e. Epac (exchange protein directly activated by cAMP) (2de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Google Scholar) or cAMP-GEF (3Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E.

They act as molecular switches that cycle between a GDP-bound inactive and a GTP-bound active state. Nucleotides are bound tightly to the protein and are released with a very slow dissociation rate. GEFs act by accelerating the slow intrinsic nucleotide dissociation rate by several orders of magnitude. Because the GTP concentration in the cell is much higher then the GDP concentration, Rap is then loaded with GTP. In the GTP-bound form, Rap interacts specifically with proteins to activate downstream targets. Rap1 plays, among other things, a pivotal role in integrin-mediated cell adhesion (4Katagiri K.

Rap-GTP is recycled into its inactive state by hydrolyzing GTP to GDP, a process that is catalyzed by Rap-specific GTPase-activating proteins (RapGAPs). Two isoforms of Epac, Epac1 and Epac2, were found in mammalian cells, both consisting of a regulatory and a catalytic region (2de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.

Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Google Scholar). The catalytic region contains a CDC25 homology domain and a REM domain, both of which are characteristic for GEF proteins of Ras-like small GTP-binding proteins such as Ras, Ral, and Rap (Fig. 1). Whereas the CDC25 homology domain contains the active site (10van den Berghe N. Cool R.H. Horn G. Wittinghofer A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 845-850Google Scholar) and forms the interface with its substrate (11Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Google Scholar), the REM (12Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Google Scholar) domain stabilizes the CDC25 homology domain without being directly involved in catalysis (11Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Google Scholar). The regulatory region of Epac contains a cAMP-binding domain and a Dishevelled/Egl-10/pleckstrin (DEP) domain (13Bos J.L. de Rooij J. Reedquist K.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 369-377Google Scholar). The cAMP-binding domain is responsible for cAMP-mediated GEF activation (2de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 20829-20836Google Scholar), whereas the DEP domain is responsible for the membrane localization of Epac (15Qiao J. Mei F.C. Popov V.L. Vergara L.A. Cheng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26581-26586Google Scholar). Whether the DEP domain binds to proteins or lipids is still elusive. Epac2 contains an additional N-terminal cyclic nucleotide monophosphate-binding domain of still unknown function. Activation of Epac as well as PKA and PKG (cGMP-regulated kinase) is mediated by the binding of cyclic nucleotide to the cyclic nucleoside monophosphate (cNMP)-binding domains. Whereas Epac and PKG consist of only one polypeptide chain, PKA is composed of catalytic (C) and regulatory (R) subunits. The R subunit contains two cAMP-binding domains and forms a homodimer that, in the absence of cAMP, binds to and inhibits the protein kinase activity of the two C subunits. Binding of cAMP leads to the release of the C subunits from the complex and its activation. PKG also contains a dimerization sequence in its regulatory part. Inactive PKG thus resembles inactive PKA, although it contains a different number of polypeptide chains. A chimera of PKG and PKA can be created that maintains the nucleotide specificity of the cyclic nucleoside mono-phosphate-binding domains (16Wild N. Herberg F.W. Hofmann F. Dostmann W.R. FEBS Lett. 1995; 374: 356-362Google Scholar). These findings suggest that, in PKA and PKG, the inhibition is realized in the same way by the binding of a regulatory domain to the kinase domain either in an intra or an intermolecular manner. For Epac, the regulatory region also inhibits GEF activity in the absence of cAMP, and cAMP relieves this inhibition (2de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Google Scholar). Indeed, in vitro, an isolated catalytic domain, which is constitutively active, is inhibited by an isolated regulatory domain, suggesting a direct physical interaction between the regulatory and the catalytic regions of Epac. This inhibition is released by cAMP (14de Rooij J. Rehmann H. van Triest M. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20829-20836Google Scholar). The kinase domain of the C subunit of PKA was structurally analyzed in great detail and was, in fact, the first protein kinase structure to be solved (17Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 414-420Google Scholar, 18Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Google Scholar). Structures of the different R subunits of PKA have been analyzed in the presence of bound cAMP (19Su Y. Dostmann W.R. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.H. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Google Scholar, 20Diller T.C. Madhusudan Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 73-82Google Scholar). However a structure of the holoenzyme is, to date, not available, and the interaction of the R and the C subunits is incompletely understood in molecular terms. Like-wise, it is not understood in any detail how the binding of cAMP induces dissociation of the holoenzyme. Recently, we have solved the structure of the regulatory region of Epac2 in the cAMP-free conformation (21Rehmann H. Prakash B. Wolf E. Rueppel A. de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 26-32Google Scholar). When compared with the cAMP-bound regulatory subunits of PKA, the most obvious difference between these structures is a C-terminal helix, also called LID, which, in PKA, covers cAMP against the solvent and is unstructured in the determined Epac structure, most likely because it is flexible due to the absence of cAMP. It was argued that the HINGE region regulates the orientation of the LID. In turn, the conformation of the HINGE is directly regulated by the presence or absence of cAMP (21Rehmann H. Prakash B. Wolf E. Rueppel A. de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 26-32Google Scholar). Here we present results indicating that the region of Epac, which would correspondent to the LID region in PKA, is involved in the direct communication between the regulatory domain and the catalytic region. A mutation has been found that completely relieves the auto-inhibition of Epac. Preparation of Proteins—All Epac constructs were expressed as GST fusion proteins from the pGEX-4T2 vector in the Escherichia coli strain CK600K as described previously (22Kraemer A. Rehmann H.R. Cool R.H. Theiss C. de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 1167-1177Google Scholar). These constructs are from human Epac1 and comprise the following amino acid residues: Epac, 149–881; Epac-RD1–328, 1–328; Epac-RD149–317, 149–317; Epac-RD149–328, 149–328; and Epac-CAT, 324–881. Single/double amino acid and Ala5 mutations were made in the Epac-(149–881) background. Mutations were introduced according to the QuikChange procedure (Stratagene). Because of low expression levels and poor solubility, only low and impure amounts of Epac-CAT and Epac(Ala)5 were available. The concentration of these proteins was therefore determined after SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis. The C-terminal truncated version of Rap1B was expressed as described (10van den Berghe N. Cool R.H. Horn G. Wittinghofer A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 845-850Google Scholar). We refer to this construct as Rap1 in the text. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—To analyze the binding of cAMP to the isolated cAMP-binding domain, a microcalorimeter (MicroCal Inc.) was used. The protein was brought to 25 °C in the 1.38-ml cell of the apparatus, and cAMP was injected in 40 steps of 6 μl every 4 min up to a 2–3-fold molar excess. The concentration of the protein was typically 50 μm, and the concentration of the nucleotide solution was 10–20 times higher. The cAMP solution was in the same buffer as the purified protein. The data were analyzed using the manufacturer's software. In Vitro Activation of Rap1—In vitro activation of Rap1 was performed as described previously (10van den Berghe N. Cool R.H. Horn G. Wittinghofer A. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 845-850Google Scholar). Briefly, 200 nm of Rap1B loaded with the fluorescent GDP analogue 2′(3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) guanosine diphosphate (mantGDP) were incubated in the presence of 20 μm GDP (Sigma) and either 100 nm (mutant) Epac or isolated domains as indicated. cAMP (Sigma) was added as indicated for the individual experiments. The nucleotide exchange was measured in real time as decay in fluorescence using a Spex1 spectrofluorometer (Spex Industries). The decay is caused by the release of protein-bound man-tGDP, which shows higher fluorescence intensity in the hydrophobic environment of the protein than in the buffer solution. The obtained data were fitted to a single exponential decay, and the rate constants (kobs) calculated were plotted against the cAMP concentration. The concentration dependence of the rate constants was treated as a normal titration experiment. All data analysis, fitting, and plotting were done with the Grafit 3.0 program (Erithacus Software). Regulation of GEF Activity via the C-terminal Region of the cAMP Domain—The isolated recombinant catalytic domain of Epac1 (Epac-CAT) is active as a GEF and accelerates release of GDP bound to Rap1. The activity is independent of cAMP but can be inhibited by the addition of recombinant regulatory domain (Epac-RD1–328) (14de Rooij J. Rehmann H. van Triest M. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20829-20836Google Scholar). The heterodimeric Epac-RD1–328-Epac-CAT complex can be reactivated by cAMP (Fig. 2A). To investigate whether an isolated cAMP-binding domain was sufficient for trans-inhibition, we tested Epac-RD149–328. As expected, this cAMP-binding domain was sufficient to inhibit Epac-CAT. Interestingly however, a cAMP-binding domain that is shorter by only eleven amino acids at the C terminus (Epac-RD149–317) did not inhibit Epac-CAT, not even at much higher concentrations (Figs. 1 and 2B). To exclude the possibility that Epac-RD149–317 is not properly folded, we determined the affinity for cAMP, because an unfolded protein should not be able to bind cAMP. As determined by isothermal titration calorimetry, the cAMP affinities for Epac-RD149–328 (4 μm) and for Epac-RD149–317 (3 μm) are similar (Fig. 3). From these results we conclude that the additional eleven amino acids are required for the trans-inhibition of Epac-CAT and, thus, for the communication of the cAMP-binding domain to Epac-CAT. The VLVLE Sequence Is Required for Auto-inhibition—Sequence comparison identifies a VLVLE motif within the additional eleven residues, which is conserved between different Epac proteins from man to nematode and fly (Fig. 1). To investigate the function of these residues in the regulation of Epac1, we mutated the VLVLE motif in Epac to AAAAA creating Epac(Ala)5. Epac is inactive in the absence of cAMP but becomes active after the addition of cAMP (Fig. 4A). In contrast, Epac(Ala)5 is active in the absence of cAMP in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 4, B and C). Importantly, cAMP does not stimulate this activity any further (Fig. 4B). From these results we conclude that the VLVLE sequence is required for the inhibition of Epac by the regulatory domain. To understand in more detail the contribution of the individual residues of the VLVLE motif, mutations were generated as indicated (Table II). First, residues were mutated in a pair-wise alanine scan generating Epac(VAALE), Epac(VLAAE), and Epac(VLVAA). The mutant proteins were characterized by determination of the cAMP concentration necessary to obtain half-maximal activity (AC50) as well as the maximal GEF activity measured as the maximal rate constant kmax for dissociation of mantGDP from Rap1-mantGDP, which was achieved under standard experimental conditions and saturating concentrations of cAMP. The results are shown in Fig. 5 and summarized in Table I. All of the mutations were inactive in the absence of cAMP and show cAMP-dependent GEF activity. Importantly, AC50 and kmax values of the mutants did not differ more than 2-fold compared with the wild type protein. Whereas the kmax of Epac(VLVAA) is comparable with wild type, it shows an AC50 of 25 μm as compared with 45 μm for wild type. Epac(VAALE) and Epac(VLAAE) are characterized by a reduced kmax but an almost unchanged AC50. Apparently, the VLVLE motif tolerates a number of mutational assaults.Table IIBiochemical properties of mutations in the LID regionKdAC50Relative kmaxμMWild type3451E308A6.3153T311A5.5152.3R313A6.2401H317A3.6500.2 Open table in a new tab Table IBiochemical properties of mutations in the VLVLE regionAC50Relative kmaxμMWild type451VAALE450.6VLAAE500.4VLVAA241VWVLE650.6VLRLE500.4VLVLR172.3 Open table in a new tab In a second series of experiments, more drastic mutations to charged or bulky residues were introduced into the VLVLE sequence to generate Epac(VLRLE), Epac(VWVLE), Epac-(VLDLE), and Epac(VLVLR) (Fig. 5 and Table II). Replacing leucine with the more bulky hydrophobic residue tryptophane in Epac(VWVLE) is well tolerated, as is the positive charge in Epac(VLRLE). This latter mutant shows a 2.5-fold reduced maximal catalytic activity. Epac(VLDLE), wherein valine is replaced by the small negatively charged aspartate, is not soluble. Apparently, this alteration has a drastic effect on the structure of the protein. Replacement of the negative glutamate by alanine in Epac(VLVAA) showed no gross changes in properties. However, changing the negatively charged glutamate into the positively charged arginine in Epac(VLVLR) resulted in a 2-fold decrease in AC50 and, very surprisingly, a 2.3-fold increase in kmax as compared with wild type. Because the concentration of active protein is crucial for these experiments, we used different preparations of wild type and mutant proteins and obtained similar results, not deviating by more than 15% for both AC50 and kmax. From these measurements we conclude that the VLVLE sequence can tolerate extensive mutations without affecting the inhibition by the regulatory region. However, the mutations do modulate the ability of cAMP to activate Epac. Most dramatic is the 2.3-fold increase activity of Epac(VLVLR), indicating that wild type Epac is activated submaximally by cAMP, at least in vitro. Additional Conserved Amino Acids in the LID Region—From the comparison between the crystal structure of the cAMP-free regulatory domain of Epac2 and the cAMP-bound regulatory domain of PKA (19Su Y. Dostmann W.R. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.H. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Google Scholar, 20Diller T.C. Madhusudan Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 73-82Google Scholar), a model of the molecular mechanism of cAMP-induced activation was developed (21Rehmann H. Prakash B. Wolf E. Rueppel A. de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 26-32Google Scholar). It predicts that cAMP binding induces a conformational change in the phosphate binding cassette (PBC) and the HINGE of the cAMP-binding domain. This, in turn, induces the C-terminal helix of the cAMP-binding domain, the LID, to move toward the core structure and shield cAMP from the solvent. The VLVLE motif is located at the end of the LID (Figs. 1 and 8). A number of additional conserved residues in the LID (Fig. 1) were analyzed for their possible involvement in binding the adenine base of cAMP and/or mediating the interaction between the regulatory region and the catalytic region. Four mutants were made in Epac-RD148–328 and analyzed by measuring the affinity of cAMP to the isolated cAMP-binding domain by isothermal titration calorimetry. Whereas H317A showed wild type affinity, E308A, T311A, and R313A showed a 2-fold reduction in affinity for cAMP, arguing that these residues make a small contribution to binding of cAMP. In addition, the same mutations were made in Epac to determine cAMP-dependent catalytic activity using the fluorescent GEF assay (Fig. 6 and Table II). The AC50 values of R313A and H317A are similar to wild type, whereas E308A and T311A show a 3-fold lower AC50. Remarkably, both E308A and T311A showed a 2–3-fold increase in cAMP-induced GEF activity compared with wild type, whereas H317A has a 5-fold reduced maximal activity.Fig. 6Mutations in the LID region change the activation properties of Epac.A and B, the affinity of the isolated cAMP-binding domain for cAMP was analyzed by isothermal titration calorimetry. Representative measurements are shown for T311A (A) and H317A (B). The determined affinities are summarized in Table II. C, 200 nm Rap-mantGDP were incubated in the presence of excess GDP and different cAMP concentrations with 100 nm Epac and the indicated mutants, respectively. The reaction rates (kobs) were determined by fitting analysis and plotted against the cAMP concentration. wt, wild type.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The G332S Polymorphism Does Not Affect the Regulation of Epac by cAMP—Interestingly, a G322S polymorphism is localized C-terminal to the cAMP-binding domain in close proximity to the VLVLE sequence (23Vanvooren V. Allgeier A. Nguyen M. Massart C. Parma J. Dumont J.E. Van Sande J. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2001; 144: 605-610Google Scholar). To investigate whether this mutation may affect the regulation of Epac by cAMP, this mutation was introduced in Epac, and cAMP-induced activation was analyzed (Fig. 7). However, G332S showed the same AC50 value as wild type, whereas the maximal activity was slightly increased by 20%. A previous comparison of the structures of the cAMP-free (open) cAMP-binding domain of Epac and the cAMP-bound (closed) cAMP-binding domain of PKA revealed that the main difference between the open and the closed structure is the orientation of the LID. In the closed conformation of PKA, this LID covers the cAMP-binding site and interacts with the adenine group of cAMP. This suggests that this LID region may be the main determinant of the interaction between the cAMP-binding domain and the catalytic region of Epac (21Rehmann H. Prakash B. Wolf E. Rueppel A. de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 26-32Google Scholar). This would imply that, in the open conformation, the LID is able to interact with the catalytic region, resulting in an inhibition of the activity (see Fig. 8). Here we show that the LID region of Epac1 indeed plays a pivotal role in the communication between the regulatory and catalytic domain of Epac. Most notably, deletion of the C-terminal region of the LID, containing a conserved VLVLE sequence, completely abolishes the ability of the regulatory domain to inhibit the exchange activity of Epac. This was shown in a trans-inhibition experiment in which an isolated cAMP-binding domain is capable of inhibiting an isolated catalytic region only when the region containing the VLVLE sequence is present. In addition, the Epac(Ala)5 mutant, wherein the VLVLE sequence is replaced by alanine residues, is constitutively active, and cAMP cannot activate this mutant protein further. Thus, the VLVLE sequence is essential for inhibition of the catalytic region by the open cAMP-binding domain even when the two domains are separated. This strongly suggests that this region directly interacts with the catalytic region. Further analysis of the VLVLE sequence revealed that mutating individual residues into alanine had modifying effects on cAMP-induced activation. This is reflected by either a change in the AC50 for cAMP and/or a change in the maximal activity. Apparently, the sequence requirement for the VLVLE sequence to inhibit the catalytic domain is not very strict. Nevertheless the sequence is highly conserved. This may indicate that the small changes we observe can nevertheless not be tolerated in vivo or imply that the VLVLE sequence, in addition to inhibiting the regulatory domain, serves an additional function. Indeed, single amino acid changes did affect cAMP-induced regulation. This is reflected by either a change in the AC50 for cAMP and/or a change in kmax. Most surprisingly, mutating glutamate into the positively charged arginine resulted in a 2–3-fold higher kmax of Epac. From these results, we conclude that the VLVLE sequence also serves as an element that is responsible for translating cAMP binding in a correct activation response. Most likely, the VLVLE sequence is conserved to serve both in the inhibition of the catalytic region and the establishment of the correct conformational response to cAMP. We have also identified conserved residues in the N-terminal part of the LID region that are involved in the regulation mechanism. From their positioning compared with PKA, we assumed that these residues might be involved in the interaction with the base of cAMP. Indeed, the affinity of cAMP for isolated cAMP domains of the E308A, T311A, and R313A mutants is reduced ∼2-fold. This difference is relatively minor and suggests that the core structure and the phosphate-binding cassette mainly provide the affinity of cAMP for Epac. As for the single mutations in the VLVLE sequence, mutants with mutations in the N-terminal LID region also affect the AC50 of cAMP to activate Epac and the maximal activation at saturating cAMP levels. The H317A mutant is still responsive to cAMP with a wild type AC50 value but a kmax of only one-fifth of wild type. This indicates that H317 plays a key role in releasing Epac from auto-inhibition, perhaps by sensing the correct base structure of cAMP. A similar interaction is found between cAMP and tryptophane or a tyrosine residue in the LID of PKA (19Su Y. Dostmann W.R. Herberg F.W. Durick K. Xuong N.H. Ten Eyck L. Taylor S.S. Varughese K.I. Science. 1995; 269: 807-813Google Scholar, 20Diller T.C. Madhusudan Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Structure (Camb.). 2001; 9: 73-82Google Scholar). In contrast, E308A and T311A show a reduced AC50 value and a higher kmax. Apparently, these mutants make Epac more active. The observation that certain LID mutants have a higher or lower kmax than wild type is very intriguing and reminiscent of our findings that certain cAMP analogues also show either reduced (22Kraemer A. Rehmann H.R. Cool R.H. Theiss C. de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 1167-1177Google Scholar) or increased maximal activity. 2H. Rehmann, unpublished observations. This indicates that the LID region in the presence of cAMP still influences the catalytic region and precludes a simple model as for PKA, wherein the activation of the catalytic region is caused by the dissociation of the regulatory region. For Epac, the interaction between the regulatory region and the catalytic region apparently remains after the binding of cAMP and imposes a restraint on the activity of Epac. One possible reason for this continuing restraint in the presence of cAMP is that Epac has an additional level of regulation that can modulate the effect of cAMP. This additional level of regulation may impinge on Epac through the binding of regulators to, for instance, the DEP domain, affecting the orientation of the LID region. This explanation for the various levels of maximal activity, which is consistent with the mutational data and thermodynamic considerations, can be put forward by considering the four-state model of Epac activation (Fig. 9) proposed earlier (22Kraemer A. Rehmann H.R. Cool R.H. Theiss C. de Rooij J. Bos J.L. Wittinghofer A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 306: 1167-1177Google Scholar). Regulation of Epac is thus described by a system of coupled equilibria between a bound and an unbound state and between an inactive and an active state. Whereas ligand-free Epac exists mostly (but not exclusively) in the inactive conformation, the binding of cAMP to the cAMP-binding domain shifts the equilibrium more (but not totally) to the active conformation. One should note that the AC50 values measured here reflect the overall equilibrium of cAMP binding and activation, whereas kmax reflects the equilibrium between the cAMP-bound inactive and active conformation The VLVLE-(Ala)5 mutation would thus favor the active conformation even in the absence of ligand, described by Kd3. Other mutations would influence the conformational equilibrium Kd2 between cAMP-bound inactive and active conformation. The fact that Epac(VLVLR), Epac(E308A), and Epac(T311A) have a higher maximal activity than wild type protein would indicate, keeping with the same model, that cAMP does not induce maximal activity even in the wild type protein and that Epac can therefore exist in a cAMP-bound but inactive conformation. The fact that maximal activity can be increased 2–3-fold indicates that the equilibrium described by Kd2 is close to or even a bit lower than unity and that a low energy barrier for the conformational change (described by Kd2) might be advantageous for cAMP signaling or will be influenced by other cellular components. Preliminary NMR shows that, in the absence and presence of cAMP, there is indeed a fast dynamic inter-conversion between two conformations, which we assume corresponds to the active and inactive conformations. 3A. Shimada, unpublished observations At this moment, the residues in the catalytic region in contact with the LID are elusive. It could be that the LID, in particular the VLVLE sequence, interacts with the CDC25 homology domain, thereby preventing binding of Rap (Fig. 8). Alternatively, the LID region may induce a conformational change in the catalytic region, for instance through an interaction with the REM domain. Indeed, recently structural and biochemical evidences were presented that the REM domain could accelerate the intrinsic activity of the CDC25 homology domain of the Ras GEF Sos (24Margarit S.M.

However, in these studies it was not possible to differentiate between CGRP receptors located in blood vessels or Schwann cells and those on muscle fibers. Activation of the CGRP receptor increases intracellular cAMP (25Van Valen F. Piechot G. Jurgens H. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 119: 195-198Google Scholar, 26Asahina A. Moro O. Hosoi J. Lerner E.A. Xu S.

Neuron. 1993; 11: 1187-1195Google Scholar, 30Maggi C.A. Santicioli P. Giuliani S. J. Auton. Pharmacol. 1995; 15: 403-419Google Scholar, 31Disa J. Parameswaran N. Nambi P. Aiyar N. Neuropeptides. 2000; 34: 229-233Google Scholar). In skeletal muscle, transcripts encoding the regulatory subunit of cAMP-dependent PKA, Riα, as well as the protein, are concentrated at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) where they co-localize with AChR, whereas the transcripts encoding the catalyic subunit Cα are present in innervated and noninnervated regions of the fibers (32Imaizumi-Scherrer T. Faust D.M. Bénichou J.-C. Hellio R. Weiss M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1241-1254Google Scholar). In addition, two PKA anchoring proteins, d-AKAP1 and d-AKAP2, have also been localized to the NMJ in adult skeletal muscle (33Perkins G.A. Wang L. Huang L.J. Humphries K. Yao V.J. Martone M.

Several ways that cholinergic transmission can potentially be modulated include altering the numbers of receptors at the synapse, their gating properties, or the rate of neurotransmitter degradation. Studies using tissue-cultured skeletal muscle have consistently shown that CGRP increases expression of AChR mRNA and protein with a consequent increase in AChR on the cell surface (22Jennings C.G.B. Mudge A.W. Brain Res. 1989; 504: 199-205Google Scholar, 34New H.V. Mudge A.M. Nature. 1986; 323: 809-811Google Scholar, 35Fontaine B. Klarsfeld A. Hökfelt T. Changeux J.-P. Neurosci.

This increase appears to be mediated by increased levels of intracellular cAMP (37Laufer R. Changeux J.-P. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 901-906Google Scholar, 38Laufer R. Changeux J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2683-2689Google Scholar). The results of studies on the effects of CGRP and increasing cAMP on the expression of AChE in tissue-cultured skeletal muscle, on the other hand, have been more variable. Skeletal muscle cells express several forms of AChE, including globular and collagen-tailed forms, all of which are catalytically active (reviewed in Refs. 39Massoulié J. Pezzementi L. Bon S. Krejci E. Valette F.M. Prog. Neurobiol. 1993; 41: 31-91Google Scholar and 40Rotundo R.L. Fambrough D.M. Engle A.E. Franzini-Armstrong C. Myology. 2nd Ed. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1994: 607-623Google Scholar). However, only the latter are concentrated at the neuromuscular synapse (41Hall Z.W. J. Neurobiol. 1973; 4: 343-361Google Scholar), where they are attached to the synaptic basal lamina (42Hall Z.W. Kelly R.B. Nature. 1971; 232: 62-63Google Scholar, 43Lwebuga-Mukasa J.S. Lappi S. Taylor P. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 1425-1434Google Scholar, 44McMahan U.J. Sanes J.R. Marshall L.M. Nature. 1978; 271: 172-174Google Scholar, 45Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19152-19159Google Scholar). Treatment of rat or mouse myotubes with CGRP results in a decrease in AChE expression (46Boudreau-Larivière C. Jasmin B.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 22-26Google Scholar, 47Choi R.C.Y. Siow N.L. Zhu S.Q. Wan D.C.C. Wong Y.H. Tsim K.W.K. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 732-745Google Scholar, 48da Costa Juniorperiod L.V. Lapa A.J. Godinho R.O. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 229-236Google Scholar), whereas treatment of chicken myotubes with CGRP in one laboratory showed no change in the expression of catalytically active AChE while actually showing an increase in total AChE protein and mRNA (49Choi R.C.Y. Leung W.Y. Dong T.T.X. Wan D.C.C. Tsim K.W.K. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 217: 165-168Google Scholar, 50Choi R.C.Y. Yung L.Y. Dong T.T.X. Wan D.C.C. Wong Y.H. Tsim K.W.K. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 152-160Google Scholar). These changes were also mediated by a cAMP-dependent mechanism and depended on the cAMP response element of the AChE gene (47Choi R.C.Y. Siow N.L. Zhu S.Q. Wan D.C.C. Wong Y.H. Tsim K.W.K. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2001; 17: 732-745Google Scholar). The reasons for these observed differences in AChE regulation by CGRP between mammalian and avian species are not yet clear. Recently, the complex of proteins forming the CGRP receptor has been elucidated (27McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Google Scholar, 28Evans B.N. Rosenblatt M.I. Mnayer L.O. Oliver K.R. Dickerson I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31438-31443Google Scholar). Activation of the receptor by CGRP results in increased levels of intracellular cAMP, suggesting a G-protein-coupled receptor. We now know that the CGRP receptor is unique among G-protein-coupled receptors in that it is a complex composed of at least three proteins. The ligand-binding protein named calcitonin receptor-like receptor (CRLR) has the stereotype structure of a seven-transmembrane receptor but is inactive when expressed in cells alone (29Chang C.P. Pearse II, R.V. O'Connell S. Rosenfeld M.G. Neuron. 1993; 11: 1187-1195Google Scholar, 51Fluhmann B. Muff R. Hunziker W. Fisher J.A. Born W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 206: 341-347Google Scholar). CRLR requires two additional accessory proteins for function; receptor activity modifying protein 1 (RAMP1) acts as a molecular chaperone and is required for routing of CRLR to the cell surface as well as pharmacologic specificity (27McLatchie L.M. Fraser N.J. Main M.J. Wise A. Brown J. Thompson N. Solari R. Lee M.G. Foord S.M. Nature. 1998; 393: 333-339Google Scholar), and the CGRP receptor component protein (RCP) is required for coupling the receptor to the cellular signal transduction pathway (28Evans B.N. Rosenblatt M.I. Mnayer L.O. Oliver K.R. Dickerson I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31438-31443Google Scholar, 52Prado M.A. Evans-Bain B. Oliver K.R. Dickerson I.M. Peptides. 2001; 22: 1773-1781Google Scholar). Although studies from many laboratories have clearly shown that CGRP has effects on skeletal muscle at the cellular, molecular, and physiological levels, two laboratories have recently reported that αCGRP null mice are devoid of an abnormal skeletal muscle phenotype (53Lu J.T. Son Y.J. Lee J. Jetton T.L. Shiota M. Moscoso L. Niswender K.D. Loewy A.D. Magnuson M.A. Sanes J.R. Emeson R.B. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1999; 14: 99-120Google Scholar, 54Salmon A.M. Damaj I. Sekine S. Picciotto M.R. Marublo L. Changeux J.-P. NeuroReport. 1999; 10: 1-6Google Scholar). The studies by Lu et al. (53Lu J.T. Son Y.J. Lee J. Jetton T.L. Shiota M. Moscoso L. Niswender K.D. Loewy A.D. Magnuson M.A. Sanes J.R. Emeson R.B. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1999; 14: 99-120Google Scholar) were particularly detailed in that they examined not only the morphology of the NMJ but also the appearance of specific synaptic components such as the AChR, the receptor density, the localized expression of synapse-specific genes, and AChR subunits in the adult and during early development, synapse elimination, and even reinnervation following nerve crush. In all cases the CGRP null mice appeared identical to the wild type animals. Thus CGRP may not be necessary for normal development, or, alternatively and as has happened in the cases of many experimentally generated gene-deficient strains of mice, the normal function has been taken over by another protein. Another possibility discussed by Lu et al. (53Lu J.T. Son Y.J. Lee J. Jetton T.L. Shiota M. Moscoso L. Niswender K.D. Loewy A.D. Magnuson M.A. Sanes J.R. Emeson R.B. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1999; 14: 99-120Google Scholar) is a compensatory role that αCGRP may be playing in these αCGRP null mice. Another interpretation is that CGRP functions not in the development of the neuromuscular synapse but in the regulation of specific synaptic proteins once the synapse has formed. In this case its role would be modulatory rather than regulatory, a possibility that was not examined in the studies described above. In the present studies we use immunofluorescence microscopy to show that all components of the CGRP receptor, CRLR, RCP, and RAMP1, are present at the avian neuromuscular junction. Using tissue-cultured quail skeletal muscle, we show that CGRP increases intracellular cAMP levels with a consequent decrease in total AChE expression as well as a complete loss of the synaptic form of the enzyme. This decrease is due to a decrease in AChE mRNA levels and the rate of AChE translation. Thus CGRP appears to inhibit the expression of AChE at the transcriptional level and, at the adult NMJ, may be involved in attenuating AChE expression through a similar mechanism. Tissue Culture of Embryonic Muscle and Drug Treatments—Primary quail skeletal muscle cells were cultured on collagen-coated 35-mm dishes in 2 ml of Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 2% chicken embryo extract, and 10 μg/ml of gentamicin (EMEM 210) (55Rotundo R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 479-483Google Scholar). The cultures were fed on the third day and every other day thereafter. When used, CGRP or forskolin (both from Sigma) were added directly to the culture medium at the concentrations and for the times indicated in each experiment. The cAMP analogs 8br-cAMP and db-cAMP, as well as IBMX, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase, and dd-forskolin, an inactive analog of forskolin used as a control, were purchased from Sigma. These pharmacological agents were dissolved directly in the culture medium, usually for 24 or 48 h, as indicated in each experiment. Analysis of AChE Oligomeric Forms and Assay of Enzyme Activity— Total AChE activity was measured by scraping the cells into 500 μl of borate extraction buffer/culture dish (20 mm borate buffer, pH 9.0, 1 m NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mm benzamidine, 5 mmN-ethyl maleimide, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin) (all from Sigma) followed by 20 min of centrifugation at 12,000 rpm. 20-μl aliquots of supernatant were assayed for AChE activity using the radiometric method of (56Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Andres V. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Google Scholar) as previously described (55Rotundo R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 479-483Google Scholar). To analyze AChE forms, 100–200 μl of supernatant were layered on 5–20% sucrose gradients in 20 mm borate buffer, pH 9.0, 1 m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 2 mm EDTA and centrifuged in a Beckman SW41 rotor for 16 h at 36,000 rpm at 4 °C. The fractions were assayed for AChE activity using the colorimetric reaction of Ellman (57Johnson C.D. Russell R.L. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 64: 229-238Google Scholar) or the radiometric assay. Cell surface AChE was assayed in whole cultures using the modified radiometric assay as described previously (58Rotundo R.L. Fambrough D.M. Cell. 1980; 22: 595-602Google Scholar). To measure the rates of AChE synthesis, muscle cultures were incubated in the presence or absence of forskolin or CGRP for 24 h, and the total myotube AChE was inhibited by incubation with 10 μm diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), a membrane-permeable irreversible AChE inhibitor, in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. Fresh medium containing the same drugs was then added back to the cultures, and the newly synthesized AChE was assayed 2 h later. Immunofluorescence Localization of AChE and CGRP Receptor Complex Components—The antibodies rabbit anti-RCP (R83) (28Evans B.N. Rosenblatt M.I. Mnayer L.O. Oliver K.R. Dickerson I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31438-31443Google Scholar, 52Prado M.A. Evans-Bain B. Oliver K.R. Dickerson I.M. Peptides. 2001; 22: 1773-1781Google Scholar), rabbit anti-RAMP1 (OA-350), and rabbit anti-CRLR (OA910) (both the generous gifts from Dr. Kevin Oliver; see Refs. 28Evans B.N. Rosenblatt M.I.

Peptides. 2001; 22: 1773-1781Google Scholar for details), plus preimmune rabbit serum were used to labeled the CGRP receptor complex at a 1:1000 dilution. FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and FITC-conjugated rabbit-anti mouse IgG were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). The mouse monoclonal anti-avian AChE 1A2 (59Rotundo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13186-13194Google Scholar) was used at a concentration of 20 μg/ml to directly label the enzyme at the neuromuscular junction. Rhodamine-conjugated α-bungarotoxin was used to label AChR. Immunofluorescence localization and analysis; 10-μm cryostat sections of adult quail posterior latisimus dorsi muscle were labeled for 1 h with the primary antibody against one of the components of the CGRP complex together with rhodamine-conjugated α-bungarotoxin. The sections were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% horse serum followed by the addition of FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit second. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, the sections were mounted and viewed with a Leica DMR-A microscope equipped with a Princeton Instruments cooled CCD camera, and the images were analyzed using Metamorph software. RNase Protection Assay—Quantitation of AChE mRNA was measured as described in Ref. 60Rossi S.G. Vazquez A.E. Rotundo R.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 919-928Google Scholar. Briefly, aliquots of RNA isolated from triplicate 60-mm cultures, incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of forskolin, were hybridized overnight at 45 °C with antisense 32P-labeled probe (61Sambrook J. Fritsh E.F. Maniatis T. Nolan C. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. I. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 7.10-7.11Google Scholar). The probe consisted of a 302-nucleotide segment transcribed from quail AChE cDNA starting 46 nucleotides upstream from the ATG translation start site, subcloned in pGEM-4Z, and linearized with HindIII. Unlabeled sense AChE transcript was used as a standard. Hybridized samples were digested with 6 units of RNase ONE (Promega, Madison, WI), ethanol-precipitated, and electrophoresed on denaturing polyacrylamide urea gels. The protected RNA was quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and Image Quant software. cAMP Accumulation Assay—The production of cAMP was assayed using the method described in Ref. 62Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal. Biochem. 1974; 58: 541-548Google Scholar as modified (28Evans B.N. Rosenblatt M.I. Mnayer L.O. Oliver K.R. Dickerson I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31438-31443Google Scholar, 63Sarkar A. Dickerson I.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 455-464Google Scholar). Quail myotube cultures (4–7 days old) were incubated overnight in EMEM 210 supplemented with 1 μCi/ml [3H]adenine (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA). The following day the cells were preincubated with 0.2 mm IBMX, an inhibitor of phosphodiesterase, for 30 min prior to the addition of the indicated drugs or agonists for an additional 30 min in the presence of IBMX. The reaction was terminated by removing the medium and extracting the cells in ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid. [3H]ATP and [3H]cAMP were separated by sequential chromatography through Dowex column (ATP counts), and alumina column (cAMP counts) and the percentage of conversion of ATP to cAMP were measured as the ratio of cAMP counts/(cAMP counts + ATP counts). Components of the CGRP Signaling Complex Are Localized at the Neuromuscular Junction—Although it is clear that CGRP can regulate the expression of AChR and AChE in muscle and that CGRP is present in motoneurons where it accumulates in nerve terminals, the presence of CGRP receptors at the neuromuscular junction has not been demonstrated. To determine whether the CGRP receptor complex was present in adult quail muscle, 10-μm cross-sections of posterior latisimus dorsi and anterior latisimus dorsi muscles were labeled with rhodamine α-bungarotoxin to visualize the AChR and with anti-AChE monoclonal antibody 1A2 to visualize the enzyme (Fig. 1). Because the CGRP receptor complex consists of three proteins, CRLR or CGRP receptor-like receptor, RAMP1 or receptor activity modifying protein, and RCP, the CGRP-receptor component protein required to activate the signaling pathway, we labeled each individually using the appropriate antibody described under “Experimental Procedures,” followed by FITC-conjugated second antibody. For each set of experiments at least two microscope slides each with two or three cryostat sections of muscle were used for each antibody. Each section has at least 15–20 neuromuscular junctions, so that more than 50 NMJs were viewed for each antibody-AChR co-localization. This experiment was repeated three times, and groups for all four antibodies as well as preimmune serum and second antibody alone were included in each experiment. On all of the sections examined, the indicated protein co-localized with the AChR and AChE at all of the synapses. Thus the three components of the CGRP receptor complex, detected by indirect immunofluorescence using specific antibodies, are all concentrated at the neuromuscular junction where they co-localize with AChE and AChR (Fig. 1). CGRP and Forskolin Stimulate cAMP Synthesis in Quail Skeletal Muscle—Several reports have shown that CGRP is capable of regulating AChR and AChE expression in skeletal muscle through a cAMP-dependent signaling pathway. To determine whether CGRP can stimulate the accumulation of cAMP in quail muscle cultures, 4-day-old myotubes were incubated with varying concentrations of CGRP or forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase, and cAMP accumulation was assayed. Fig. 2 shows that incubation with CGRP or stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin resulted in a dose-dependent accumulation of intracellular cAMP. Addition of SQ22536, a specific inhibitor of adenylyl cyclase, for 30 min followed by 30 μm forskolin resulted in a complete inhibition of cAMP accumulation, indicating that the increased levels of cAMP by forskolin in our cultures are due to adenylyl cyclase stimulation (results not shown). Forskolin and cAMP Analogs Decrease Total AChE Synthesis and Block Expression of the Collagen-tailed AChE Form—To determine whether increasing intracellular cAMP altered the synthesis of AChE forms, total enzyme activity in 7-day quail muscle cultures was irreversibly inhibited with DFP (see “Experimental Procedures”), followed by culturing in EMEM 210 for 24 h in the presence of the cAMP analogs 8br-cAMP (100 μm) or db-cAMP (100 μm), forskolin (50 μm), IBMX (100 μm), the inactive forskolin analog dd-forskolin (50 μm), or normal medium. After 24 h, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 500 μl of borate extraction buffer and centrifuged, and 200 μl of the supernatants were loaded on 5–20% sucrose gradients to analyze AChE forms by velocity sedimentation. The fractions were collected from the bottom of the gradient and assayed for AChE activity. Fig. 3 shows that any treatment that increases effective intracellular cAMP levels results in a decrease of all newly synthesized AChE oligomeric forms. The effects, however, were most pronounced for the collagen-tailed (A12) AChE form whose expression was completely eliminated. Increasing cAMP Levels Decreases the Expression of AChE Molecules on the Muscle Cell Surface—One of the predicted consequences of decreasing expression of the collagen-tailed AChE form, which is the form that attaches to the extracellular matrix, would be a decreased accumulation of cell surface AChE. To determine whether inhibiting expression of the collagen-tailed AChE resulted in changes in cell surface AChE, 7-day-old muscle cultures were incubated for 48 h in complete medium with or without 10 μm forskolin, and the cell surface AChE was assayed as described (58Rotundo R.L. Fambrough D.M. Cell. 1980; 22: 595-602Google Scholar). This assay uses [3H]acetylcholine phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, added directly to washed cells on the culture dish to measure hydrolysis by enzyme molecules with their catalytic sites on the surface of the cell. Fig. 4A shows that the expression of AChE activity is attenuated in forskolin-treated cultures. When the collagentailed AChE forms aggregates on the surface of quail myotubes in culture, it forms clusters of enzyme molecules that associate with AChR and several other membrane-bound and extracellular matrix molecules (64Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1657-1667Google Scholar, 65Rossi S.G. Rotundo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1979-1987Google Scholar). To determine whether the decreased cell surface enzyme activity on forskolin-treated myotubes was also reflected in a decrease in clusters of AChE, we quantified the number of AChE clusters/nucleus on cultures treated for 48 h with forskolin compared with untreated cultures. The AChE was localized by indirect immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibody 1A2 and FITC-conjugated second antibody, followed by Hoechst 33342 to stain the nuclei. Three muscle cultures/group were quantified by counting the number of AChE clusters on myotubes and the number of myonuclei in the same fibers in 10 random fields/dish. The number of AChE clusters/nucleus on forskolin-treated cultures was ∼70% of the number of AChE clusters/nucleus on normal cultures (Fig. 4B), suggesting also that the number of nuclei expressing AChE decreased after activation of the cAMP pathway. Long Term Forskolin Treatment Reversibly Down-regulates AChE Activity—To determine the half-maximal forskolin concentration needed to inhibit AChE synthesis, triplicate 6-day quail muscle cultures were treated overnight with increasing concentrations of forskolin, and the total AChE activity was assayed. The dose-response curve shows that the half-maximal effect of forskolin on AChE activity is obtained at ∼10 μm (Fig. 5A). Long term forskolin treatments (24 h) were required to obtain a reduction of AChE activity, whereas a 4-h treatment had no effect, as shown in Fig. 5B. These results suggested that the mechanism of forskolin action on AChE regulation probably involved the transcription of AChE mRNA rather than a translational control (see next section). To determine whether the effect of forskolin on AChE activity was reversible, we treated 4-day-old muscle cultures with forskolin for 24 h and then either fed the cultures with normal medium or continued forskolin treatment for 1 more day. The reversibility of the inhibition of AChE synthesis by increased accumulation of cAMP is shown in Fig. 6.Fig. 6The inhibition of AChE synthesis by forskolin is reversible. Groups of muscle cultures were incubated beginning on day 4 with medium with or without 10 μm forskolin. After 24 h, a subset of cultures were rinsed with normal culture medium and incubation continued in the absence of forskolin. •, untreated; ○, 10 μm forskolin; ▾, 10 μm forskolin for 24 h and then normal medium. The effects of forskolin are completely reversible under these conditions. Each point is the mean ± S.E. of three cultures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Forskolin Inhibits the Synthesis of AChE by Reducing AChE mRNA Levels—We had previously observed a positive correlation between the amount of globular AChE forms present, the AChE transcript levels, and the rate of AChE synthesis in our quail muscle cultures (60Rossi S.G. Vazquez A.E. Rotundo R.L. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 919-928Google Scholar). Because the globular AChE forms were decreased in forskolin-treated cultures (Fig. 3), we expected to find decreased AChE transcript levels as well. Moreover, as mentioned above, long term forskolin treatments were required to have an effect on AChE activity, suggesting a possible regulation of AChE synthesis at the transcriptional level. Therefore, to examine this possibility, we measured AChE transcript levels using an RNase protection assay in muscle cultures incubated overnight with or without 10 μm forskolin. Our results indicate that after long term (overnight) forskolin treatment, the levels of AChE transcripts decreased (Fig. 7, A and B), and the rate of AChE translation, measured by assaying newly synthesized AChE activity after DFP treatment following the procedure described under “Experimental Procedures,” decreased as well (Fig. 7C). Treatment of Myotubes with CGRP Inhibits AChE Synthesis—To determine the effects of CGRP on newly synthesized AChE activity and oligomeric forms, 6-day quail muscle cultures were DFP-treated, and newly synthesized enzyme was extracted in borate extraction buffer after 24-h incubation in medium with or without 30 μm CGRP or 10 μm forskolin. Long term CGRP treatments, like long term forskolin, decreased all AChE oligomeric forms, especially the collagen-tailed (synapse-associated) form (Fig. 8). To determine whether the effects of CGRP were directly on AChE synthesis, muscle cultures were treated with 30 μm CGRP overnight, and total AChE activity was assayed. A parallel set of cultures pretreated with CGRP overnight were DFP-treated, and the rate of synthesis was measured. Fig. 9 shows that total AChE activity (panel A) and rate of AChE synthesis (panel B) decreased when CGRP receptors were activated, indicating the involvement of the cAMP signaling pathway in AChE regulation by CGRP.Fig. 9CGRP stimulation reduces the rate of AChE translation in cultured muscle cells. Muscle cultures were treated overnight with CGRP, and the rate of AChE synthesis was measured using the rate of recovery of AChE enzyme activity following DFP treatment. The total AChE levels were reduced by almost 50% in the cells, as usual for this treatment time (A), and the rate of AChE translation (B) was reduced proportionately. Each bar is the mean ± S.E. of three cultures.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Here we present direct evidence for the localization of the CGRP receptor complex, CRLR, and its accessory proteins, RAMP1 and RCP, at the neuromuscular synapse. The co-localization of these three proteins with other components of the neuromuscular junction, the AChR and AChE (Fig. 1), and the catalytic and regulatory subunits of PKA (32Imaizumi-Scherrer T. Faust D.M. Bénichou J.-C. Hellio R. Weiss M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1241-1254Google Scholar, 33Perkins G.A. Wang L. Huang L.J. Humphries K. Yao V.J. Martone M. Deerinck T.J. Barraclough D.M. Violin J.D. Smith D. Newton A. Scott J.D. Taylor S.S. Ellisman M.H. BMC Neurosci. 2001; 2: 17Google Scholar) provide evidence that the entire signaling system necessary for transducing CGRP binding into increases in intracellular cAMP is specifically localized to this synapse. All of these components are also expressed in aneural quail muscle cultures because CGRP is capable of stimulating adenylyl cyclase and eliciting an increase in intracellular cAMP (Fig. 2). Increasing intracellular cAMP levels has a pronounced inhibitory effect on the expression of all AChE oligomeric forms with the most striking effect on the expression of the collagentailed form that is concentrated at the neuromuscular junction (Figs. 3 and 8). This observation suggests that cAMP also affects expression of the noncatalytic collagenic tail subunit, ColQ. These observations are consistent with observations from several groups on the effects of CGRP on AChE in mammalian skeletal muscle, both in vivo (12Hodges-Savola C.A. Fernandez H.L. Neurosci. Lett. 1995; 190: 117-120Google Scholar, 13Fernandez H.L. Hodges-Savola C.A. J. Appl. Physiol. 1996; 80: 357-362Google Scholar, 14Fernandez H.L. Ross G.S. Nadelhaft I. Brain Res. 1999; 844: 83-97Google Scholar) and in vitro (46Boudreau-Larivière C. Jasmin B.J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 444: 22-26Google Scholar, 47Choi R.C.Y. Siow N.L. Zhu S.Q. Wan D.C.C. Wong Y.H.

Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 229-236Google Scholar) where down-regulation of the enzyme has been documented. In contrast, one laboratory has shown that CGRP and increasing cAMP levels had no effect on the expression of chicken AChE activity, whereas it increased the expression of AChE mRNA and protein, representing an inactive form of the enzyme (49Choi R.C.Y. Leung W.Y. Dong T.T.X. Wan D.C.C. Tsim K.W.K. Neurosci. Lett. 1996; 217: 165-168Google Scholar, 50Choi R.C.Y. Yung L.Y. Dong T.T.X. Wan D.C.C. Wong Y.H. Tsim K.W.K. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 152-160Google Scholar). The reason for the increase of this catalytically inactive AChE, originally described as a rapidly overturning intracellular pool in avian muscle cultures (66Rotundo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19398-19406Google Scholar), is unknown but could be a property unique to tissue-cultured chicken muscle because it has not been observed in other species. The regulation of AChE by CGRP in quail skeletal muscle cultures appears to be via activation of the adenylyl cyclase/PKA pathway, as has been shown in other systems, and most likely involves transcriptional controls. Although there is no effect of increasing cAMP levels short term, within a few hours, there is a pronounced inhibition of AChE expression following a more prolonged overnight exposure to drugs that increase intracellular cAMP levels (Figs. 5, 7, and 9). This inhibition of AChE expression most likely occurs as a consequence of decreased AChE mRNA transcription (Fig. 7, A and B), resulting in a proportional decrease in the rate of AChE translation (Figs. 7C and 9). This stands in contrast to the long term effects of CGRP and increased cAMP levels on expression of the AChR where mRNA and protein levels are both increased. Because activation of the CGRP receptor results in a decrease in all AChE forms, along with a specific decrease in the collagen-tailed synaptic form of the enzyme, it would appear that one function of this pathway is to increase the sensitivity of this synapse to acetylcholine. One way to accomplish this would be to decrease the levels of AChE bound to the synaptic basal lamina and hence decrease the degradation rate of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. This interpretation is strengthened by the observation that activation of adenylyl cyclase decreases the levels of cell surface AChE as well as the surface clusters of AChE molecules that consist primarily of the collagentailed AChE associated with AChRs (Fig. 4). In addition, this hypothesis is consistent with studies from several laboratories focusing on the regulation of the nicotinic AChR in adult muscle as well as in culture (reviewed in Refs. 1Jansen J.K. Fladby T. Prog. Neurobiol. 1990; 34: 39-90Google Scholar, 2Changeux J.P. Duclert A. Sekine S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 657: 361-378Google Scholar, 3Hall Z.W. Sanes J.R. Cell. 1993; 72: 99-121Google Scholar, 4Sanes J.R. Lichtman J.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 389-442Google Scholar). These studies indicate that CGRP and/or increases in cAMP increase the synthesis of AChR and increase the numbers of receptors inserted into the plasma membrane (11Buffelli M. Pasino E. Cangiano A. Neuroscience. 2001; 104: 561-567Google Scholar). Increases in cAMP also appear to result in increased stability and hence longer half-life of the receptors once they are inserted into the synapse (67Shyng S.L. Xu R. Salpeter M.M. Neuron. 1991; 6: 469-475Google Scholar, 68Xu R. Salpeter M.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 165: 30-39Google Scholar). These coordinated consequences of CGRP receptor activation, increases in AChR with a parallel decrease in AChE, provide a simple mechanism for increasing the sensitivity of the synapse to acetylcholine on an intermediate to long-term basis.

https://openalex.org/W2136012661,"Leptin has been shown to decrease glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in both in vivo and in vitro studies. As some of the effects of leptin have been elicited through both peripheral and central mechanisms, we assessed whether leptin modulates insulin secretion also through the central nervous system. We infused leptin or saline through implanted intracerebro-ventricular (ICV) catheters to chronically catheterized, conscious rats (n=15), 2 h after initiation of hyperglycemic (approximately 11 mM) clamp. On ICV administration of leptin, there was a gradual and progressive decrease in plasma insulin levels by 52% with 30 ng (P<0.005) and by 28% with 20 ng (P<0.05) of leptin compared with ICV saline. The effect of 20 ng leptin ICV was replicated by intravenous (IV) leptin infusion that achieved physiological leptin levels of approximately 17 ng/ml (n=5). When the melanocortin (MC) pathway was blocked with a nonselective MC-3/4 antagonist SHU 9119 administered ICV, and either saline or leptin (n=12) was infused IV, intravenous leptin failed to produce a decrease in glucose-stimulated insulin levels. We conclude that leptin decreases insulin levels by a predominantly central mechanism, probably via the melanocortin receptors; and peripheral leptin receptors on the beta-cells do not play a major role. The physiological features of this response suggest a possible role for leptin in the evolution of diabetes in overweight individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2061001012,"Cathepsin G is a neutrophil-derived serine protease that contributes to tissue damage at sites of inflammation. The actions of cathepsin G are reported to be mediated by protease-activated receptor (PAR)-4 (a thrombin receptor) in human platelets. This study provides the first evidence that cathepsin G promotes inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate accumulation, activates ERK, p38 MAPK, and AKT, and decreases contractile function in cardiomyocytes. Because some cathepsin G responses mimic cardiomyocyte activation by thrombin, a role for PARs was considered. Cathepsin G markedly activates phospholipase C and p38 MAPK in cardiomyocytes from PAR-1–/– mice, but it fails to activate phospholipase C, ERK, p38 MAPK, or AKT in PAR-1- or PAR-4-expressing PAR-1–/– fibroblasts (which display robust responses to thrombin). These results argue that PAR-1 does not mediate the actions of cathepsin G in cardiomyocytes, and neither PAR-1 nor PAR-4 mediates the actions of cathepsin G in fibroblasts. Of note, prolonged incubation of cardiomyocytes with cathepsin G results in the activation of caspase-3, cleavage of FAK and AKT, sarcomeric disassembly, cell rounding, cell detachment from underlying matrix, and morphologic features of apoptosis. Inhibition of Src family kinases or caspases (with PP1 or benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone, respectively) delays FAK and AKT cleavage and cardiomyocyte detachment from substrate.

Collectively, these studies describe novel cardiac actions of cathepsin G that do not require PARs and are predicted to assume functional importance at sites of interstitial inflammation in the heart. Cathepsin G is a major serine protease released by activated neutrophils at sites of vascular injury and inflammation (1Molino M. Blanchard N. Belmonte E. Tarver A.P. Abrams C. Hoxie J.A. Cerletti C. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11168-11175Google Scholar, 2Parry M.A. Myles T. Tschopp J. Stone S.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 335-341Google Scholar). Cathepsin G is a strong agonist for platelets, causing a rise in intracellular calcium, aggregation, and degranulation. Cathepsin G induces functional and morphological changes in endothelial cells that lead to increased permeability and growth factor release (1Molino M. Blanchard N. Belmonte E. Tarver A.P. Abrams C. Hoxie J.A. Cerletti C. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11168-11175Google Scholar, 3Weksler B.B. Jaffe E.A. Brower M.S. Cole O.F. Blood. 1989; 74: 1627-1634Google Scholar, 4Selak M.A. Biochem.

Cathepsin G also induces tissue injury and contributes to the pathogenesis of certain chronic pulmonary diseases, such as emphysema and cystic fibrosis (6Bird P.I. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1999; 77: 47-57Google Scholar). These diverse cellular actions of cathepsin G have been attributed to the cleavage and function modulation of a range of protein substrates, including clotting factors (factor V and factor VII), neutrophil chemoattractants (tumor necrosis factor α, interleukin-1, and interleukin-8), and matrix components (including collagen, fibronectin, and elastin). Recent studies have focused on cathepsin G-dependent cleavage of seven transmembrane spanning domain G protein-coupled protease-activated receptors (PARs) 1The abbreviations used are: PARs, protease-activated receptors; IP, inositol phosphate; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; Z, benzyloxycarbonyl; fmk, fluoromethyl ketone; PTX, pertussis toxin; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; MMPs, matrix-degrading metalloproteinases; FAK, focal adhesion kinase. as an additional potentially important mechanism whereby cathepsin G modulates coagulation and tissue remodeling at sites of injury and inflammation. PAR-1, the prototypical receptor for thrombin, is activated as a result of thrombin-dependent cleavage of its extracellular N terminus to expose a new N-terminal sequence (SFLLRN) that binds intramolecularly and serves as a tethered ligand (7Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11023-11027Google Scholar). Since the initial cloning of PAR-1, three additional structurally homologous PARs have been identified; PAR-3 and PAR-4 are activated by thrombin, whereas PAR-2 is activated by trypsin, membrane-type serine protease-1, and mast cell tryptase (but not thrombin) (8Dery O. Corvera C.U. Steinhoff M. Bunnett N.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1429-C1452Google Scholar, 9Takeuchi T. Harris J.L. Huang W. Yan K.W. Coughlin S.R. Craik C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26333-26342Google Scholar). PARs are endowed with two unique regulatory features as a result of their distinctive proteolytic activation mechanism. PAR-1, PAR-3, and PAR-4 need not be entirely selective for thrombin but are predicted to be susceptible to activation by any serine protease capable of cleaving the N terminus at the site that exposes the tethered ligand sequence. Additionally, PAR cleavage at sites on the N terminus more proximal to the transmembrane domain is predicted to amputate the tethered ligand sequence and render the PAR unresponsive to subsequent proteolytic activation. Cathepsin G is reported to modulate PAR function via both mechanisms. At concentrations achieved in the vicinity of activated neutrophils, cathepsin G mimics the action of thrombin to mobilize intracellular calcium in Xenopus oocytes and fibroblast cell lines that stably overexpress human PAR-1 or human PAR-4 (but not in untransfected cells or cells that overexpress PAR-2 or PAR-3). Mutagenesis studies suggest that in each case the mechanism entails cleavage of the N terminus (at the Arg41–Ser42 bond in PAR-1 and the Arg47–Gly48 bond in PAR-4) to expose the tethered ligand (1Molino M. Blanchard N. Belmonte E. Tarver A.P. Abrams C. Hoxie J.A. Cerletti C. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11168-11175Google Scholar, 10Sambrano G.R. Huang W. Faruqi T. Mahrus S. Craik C. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6819-6823Google Scholar). These results suggest that cathepsin G should display generalized agonist actions in cells that express either PAR-1 or PAR-4. However, for unclear reasons, agonist actions of cathepsin G are consistently identified in human platelets but not other thrombin-responsive cell types, such as human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human lung fibroblasts (1Molino M.

Rather, in cells that express PAR-1 but do not display stimulatory responses to cathepsin G, the predominant effect of cathepsin G is to non-productively cleave PAR-1 at a site close to the first transmembrane domain (Phe55–Trp56). This amputates the tethered ligand domain and renders PAR-1 unresponsive to subsequent stimulation by thrombin (although cathepsin G-cleaved PAR-1 is otherwise structurally intact and fully responsive to SFLLRN) (1Molino M. Blanchard N. Belmonte E. Tarver A.P. Abrams C. Hoxie J.A. Cerletti C. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11168-11175Google Scholar). Recent studies (13Cumashi A. Ansuini H. Celli N. De Blasi A. O'Brien P.J. Brass L.F. Molino M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 533-538Google Scholar) indicate that human and murine PAR-3 also can be disabled by cathepsin G (although via distinct mechanisms) and that certain cathepsin G actions on PARs may be species-dependent. The cardiovascular signaling properties of PARs generally have been explored in platelets (where the actions of thrombin are critical for normal hemostasis and arterial thrombosis) and the vessel wall (where thrombin promotes changes in endothelial cell morphology, which lead to altered monolayer permeability, and induces proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells). However, recent studies identify cardiomyocytes as an additional cardiovascular target for thrombin and related proteases. Cardiomyocytes cultured from neonatal rat ventricles co-express PAR-1, PAR-2, and PAR-4 (mRNA for PAR-3 is not detected) (14Jiang T. Kuznetsov V. Pak E. Zhang H.L. Robinson R.B. Steinberg S.F. Circ.

Darrow A.L. Andrade-Gordon P. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11714-11720Google Scholar). PAR-1 and PAR-2 agonists induce similar increases in phosphoinositide hydrolysis and intracellular calcium; both receptors link to the activation of ERK, stimulation of p38 MAPK, and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (18Sabri A. Muske G. Zhang H. Pak E. Darrow A. Andrade-Gordon P. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1054-1061Google Scholar). Recent studies (19Sabri A. Guo J. Elouardighi H. Darrow A.L. Andrade-Gordon P. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11714-11720Google Scholar) indicate that PAR-4 also effectively activates p38 MAPK in cardiomyocytes; PAR-4 stimulates phosphoinositide hydrolysis, activates ERK, and induces hypertrophy but more weakly. The predominant natural activator(s) of endogenous cardiomyocyte PARs remains uncertain. Although cardiomyocyte PAR-1 may be activated by thrombin in the setting of hemorrhagic infarction (where the endothelial barrier is broken and cardiomyocytes come into direct contact with blood-borne substances), most myocardial events are not accompanied by hemorrhage into the myocardium. Hence, other potential mechanisms for PAR activation must be considered. This study tests whether cathepsin G elaborated by neutrophils at sites of injury and/or inflammation (myocarditis, the border zone of a myocardial infarction) exerts a primary agonist action in cardiomyocytes and whether cathepsin G responses can be attributed to activation of a known PAR. Materials—Chemicals were purchased commercially from the following sources: thrombin (Calbiochem); fura 2-AM (Molecular Probes); [3H]myoinositol (24.4 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences); pertussis toxin (PTX, List Biologicals). Cathepsin G was obtained from Calbiochem for most experiments; selected experiments were performed with cathepsin G from Sigma and yielded equivalent results. All other chemicals were reagent-grade and obtained from standard chemical suppliers. SFLLRN and AYPGKF were synthesized at the State University of New York, Stony Brook, as C-terminal amides, purified by high pressure liquid chromatography, and characterized by mass spectroscopy. Peptide solutions were made fresh from powder for all experiments. Cardiomyocyte Cultures—Cardiac myocytes were dissociated from the ventricles of Wistar rats (postnatal day two) or PAR-1–/– or background strain C57BL/6 mice (embryonic day 18–20) by a trypsin digestion protocol which incorporates a differential attachment procedure to enrich for cardiac myocytes (14Jiang T. Kuznetsov V. Pak E. Zhang H.L. Robinson R.B. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 553-563Google Scholar). Although the preplating step effectively decreases fibroblast contamination, myocytes were subjected to 30 gray of X-rays on day 1 of culture to halt the proliferative potential of any residual contaminating fibroblasts (14Jiang T. Kuznetsov V. Pak E. Zhang H.L. Robinson R.B. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 553-563Google Scholar). Cardiomyocytes were plated at a density of 0.5 × 106 cells per ml (2 ml per 35-mm dish) and were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For assays of ERK, p38 MAPK, or AKT activation, cells were serum-starved in 1:1 DMEM/F-12 medium for 24 h.

Stable transfectants were selected in 250 mg/ml of hygromycin B and screened by specific agonist-induced calcium mobilization. Cultures were maintained in DMEM containing 10% calf serum and 250 μg/ml hygromycin; for assays of MAPK or AKT activation, cultures were serum-starved overnight. Phosphoinositide Hydrolysis—Cells were incubated for 72 (cardiomyocytes) or 24 h (cell lines) with 3 μCi/ml [3H]myoinositol, washed, preincubated with 10 mm LiCl for 20 min, and then stimulated with agonists for the indicated intervals at room temperature. Inositol phosphates (IPs) were extracted and eluted sequentially by ion-exchange chromatography on Dowex columns according to methods published previously (14Jiang T. Kuznetsov V. Pak E. Zhang H.L. Robinson R.B. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 553-563Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Immunoblot analysis was used to compare levels of total and phosphorylated ERK, p38 MAPK, and AKT and to track the accumulation of caspase-3 and FAK cleavage products. Following exposure to test agents as indicated in individual experimental protocols, cells were washed three times with ice-cold calcium/magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4), scraped into hot SDS-PAGE sample buffer, sonicated, and then centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was diluted in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and stored at –70 °C. Western blot analysis was performed according to manufacturer's instructions, with bands detected by enhanced chemiluminescence and quantified by laser scanning densitometry. For each panel in each figure, the results are from a single gel exposed for a uniform duration. Measurement of Cytosolic Free Calcium and Cell Shortening—Intracellular calcium and shortening was simultaneously measured photometrically in fura-2-loaded cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes according to methods published previously (14Jiang T. Kuznetsov V. Pak E. Zhang H.L. Robinson R.B. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 553-563Google Scholar). In brief, myocytes cultured on coverslips were loaded with fura-2 by incubation in Tyrode's solution containing 3 μm of the acetoxymethyl ester form of fura-2 (fura-2/AM) and 1.5 μl/ml of 25% (w/v in dimethyl sulfoxide) Pluronic F-127 for 20 min at 37 °C. Cardiomyocytes were rinsed with fresh Tyrode's solution and maintained for at least 15 min at room temperature to allow for de-esterification of the dye. Cardiomyocytes were superfused with room temperature Tyrode's solution gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 at a rate of 1 ml/min and paced by electrical field stimulation at 1 Hz throughout the experimental protocol (to avoid changes in cell calcium due to potential chronotropic actions of agonists). Drugs were introduced as a bolus into the prechamber of a three compartment superfusion chamber described previously (14Jiang T. Kuznetsov V. Pak E. Zhang H.L. Robinson R.B. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 553-563Google Scholar). Intracellular fura-2 fluorescence was monitored (at a sampling rate of 100 Hz) with a device that alternately illuminates the cells with 340 and 380 nm light while measuring emission at 520 nm (Photon Technologies, Inc., Princeton, NJ). Intracellular calcium is reported as the fura-2 fluorescence ratio (due to the uncertainties inherent in any attempt to calibrate these signals, as discussed in detail by us and others elsewhere (14Jiang T. Kuznetsov V. Pak E. Zhang H.L. Robinson R.B. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 553-563Google Scholar)). Glass microspheres (2.1 ± 0.5 μm) were added to the monolayer cultures to provide high contrast spots for tracking cell motion. The cell image was directed to a video optical system (Crescent Electronics), and a glass bead attached to the cardiomyocyte surface was tracked along a raster line segment during electrically stimulated contractions. The lack of a single axis of myofibrillar alignment renders measurements of cell length during electrically stimulated contractions meaningless in this preparation. Therefore, relative cell motion rather than actual cell length is reported. The analog voltage output from the motion detector was calibrated to convert to micrometers of movement. The motion signal, obtained at a rate of 60 Hz, was digitized and stored using Deltascan software (Photon Technology Int.). Time-lapse Video and Fluorescence Microscopy—Cells were grown on 25-mm slides that were mounted in sealed rose chambers maintained at 37 °C, in the presence of media with or without cathepsin G. Images were taken every 5 min for ∼24 h with a Spot RT Monochrome CCD camera (Diagnostics Instruments) on a Nikon Eclipse TE300 Phase contrast/differential interference contrast microscope. Some slides were stained with Hoechst 33342 or 33258 and imaged through a UV-2A filter cube. The Uniblitz Shutter (model VMMD1) was controlled by Spot RT software or Scion Imaging (National Institutes of Health). Pictures were captured and then stacked by Spot software, and montages were prepared through Photoshop software. Cathepsin G Promotes Phosphoinositide Hydrolysis and Activates ERK, p38 MAPK, and AKT in Cardiomyocytes; Distinct Signaling by Cathepsin G and PAR Agonists—Fig. 1 shows that cathepsin G markedly increases IP accumulation in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Responses are detected at relatively low concentrations of cathepsin G, typical of those reported to be generated at sites of inflammation. The characteristics of IP accumulation in response to conventional PAR-1 agonists (thrombin, SFLLRN) versus cathepsin G are quite distinct. Consistent with previous results, PAR-1 activation by maximally stimulatory concentrations of thrombin (1 unit/ml) or the PAR-1 agonist peptide SFLLRN (300 μm) results in transient elevations of IP2/IP3, followed by a more sustained accumulation of IP1 (22Sabri A. Pak E. Alcott S.A. Wilson B.A. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1047-1053Google Scholar). In contrast, cathepsin G promotes the progressive accumulation of IP2 and IP3 (to levels as high or higher than the levels transiently observed in cells stimulated with thrombin or SFLLRN); the accompanying cathepsin G-induced rise in IP1 levels is trivial in comparison. Because we recently identified PAR-4 as an additional cellular receptor for thrombin in cardiomyocytes (19Sabri A. Guo J. Elouardighi H. Darrow A.L. Andrade-Gordon P. Steinberg S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11714-11720Google Scholar), we also compared responses to cathepsin G and AYPGKF (a derivative of the PAR-4 tethered ligand sequence that is highly specific for PAR-4 and acts at ∼10-fold lower concentrations than the tethered ligand sequence GYPGKF itself) (23Faruqi T.R. Weiss E.J. Shapiro M.J. Huang W. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19728-19734Google Scholar). Table I shows that AYPGKF induces a rise in IP1 levels, but the magnitude of this response is relatively modest compared with the rise in IP1 levels elicited by 1 unit/ml thrombin (a concentration that maximally activates phosphoinositide hydrolysis in cardiomyocytes). AYPGKF actions cannot be attributed to robust PAR-4 signaling in a minor contaminating fibroblast population, because cardiac fibroblasts display brisk/pronounced increases in IP accumulation in response to thrombin and SFLLRN, but cardiac fibroblasts do not respond to AYPGKF (24Sabri A. Short J. Guo J. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 532-539Google Scholar). Of note, stimulation with AYPGKF results in the sustained accumulation of IP1, with only a relatively minor associated increase in IP2/IP3 levels. This is quite distinct from the effect of cathepsin G, which promotes the preferential accumulation of IP2/IP3. The actions of cathepsin G and thrombin are distinguished further based upon their sensitivities to the inhibitory effects of PTX. Previous studies established that the effect of thrombin to activate phospholipase C in cardiomyocyte cultures is severely curtailed by pretreatment with PTX (22Sabri A. Pak E. Alcott S.A. Wilson B.A. Steinberg S.F. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 1047-1053Google Scholar). In contrast, IP2/IP3 accumulation in response to cathepsin G is PTX-insensitive (IP2 + IP3 accumulation (CPM over basal): control 238 ± 14; PTX 253 ± 22, n = 3; not significant). Collectively, these experiments identify rather distinct IP responses to cathepsin G versus conventional PAR agonists in cardiomyocytes, suggesting that PARs are unlikely mediators of the cardiac actions of cathepsin G.Table IDistinct patterns of phosphoinositide hydrolysis in response to conventional PAR agonists (thrombin and AYPGKF) versus cathepsin GIP1IP2 + IP3Basal475 ± 4895 ± 6Thrombin1632 ± 65ap < 0.05 versus basal.144 ± 18ap < 0.05 versus basal.AYPGKF648 ± 50ap < 0.05 versus basal.126 ± 12ap < 0.05 versus basal.Cathepsin G542 ± 74327 ± 22ap < 0.05 versus basal.a p < 0.05 versus basal. Open table in a new tab The studies next examined whether cathepsin G activates ERK, p38 MAPK, and AKT, effectors previously identified as targets of PARs in cardiomyocytes. Fig. 2 shows that cathepsin G promotes a rapid and transient increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation; the response is maximal at 5 min and wanes thereafter. The magnitude of cathepsin G-dependent activation of ERK is relatively modest, compared with the robust response induced by thrombin. In contrast, cathepsin G markedly activates p38 MAPK and AKT (to levels equivalent to or slightly exceeding the response to thrombin) but with relatively slow kinetics. Activation of p38 MAPK and AKT is detectable at 5 min and increases progressively during the first 30 min of stimulation. These results suggest that cathepsin G and PARs activate certain common target effectors. However, differences in the kinetics and the magnitude of these responses suggest distinct activation mechanisms. Fig. 3 shows that cathepsin G also depresses the amplitude of cell shortening (43.9 ± 9.6%, n = 11, p < 0.01). The PAR-1 agonist SFLLRN induces a similar decrease in contractile function (61.4 ± 10.5%, n = 13, p < 0.01). However, the effects of cathepsin G and SFLLRN on intracellular calcium regulation are quite different. SFLLRN increases diastolic and peak systolic calcium ion concentration (30.5 ± 4.7 and 28.7 ± 8.8%, respectively, n = 13, p < 0.01), whereas cathepsin G does not significantly alter intracellular calcium. The effect of cathepsin G to depress contractile function, without altering intracellular calcium, is most consistent with a mechanism that reduces myofibrillar calcium sensitivity. Stimulatory Actions of Cathepsin G Do Not Require PAR-1 or PAR-4 —Certain aspects of the cellular response to cathepsin G (in particular the unusually slow/progressive accumulation of IP2/IP3, without an associated rise in IP1) are sufficiently distinct from the response to traditional PAR agonists to suggest that cathepsin G might act via a distinct signaling mechanism. Therefore, the studies next took advantage of cardiomyocytes cultured from ventricles of wild-type and PAR-1–/– mice to investigate the role of PAR-1 in the stimulatory actions of cathepsin G. Fig. 4 shows that SFLLRN promotes IP accumulation and activates p38 MAPK in cardiomyocytes cultured from wild-type, but not PAR-1–/–, mice. Control experiments establish that the defect in SFLLRN activation cannot be attributed to a lesion in components of the signaling pathway distal to PAR-1, because IP accumulation in response to purinergic receptor activation with ATP is robust in both wild-type and PAR-1–/– cultures (Fig. 4A). In contrast to SFLLRN responses, which require expression of a PAR-1 gene product, cathepsin G promotes IP accumulation and stimulates p38 MAPK in cardiomyocytes from both wild-type and PAR-1–/– mice. These results indicate that the stimulatory actions of cathepsin G in cardiomyocytes do not require PAR-1 expression. Fibroblast cell lines derived from PAR-1–/– mice that stably express human PAR-1 or PAR-4 also were used to explore a possible PAR requirement for cathepsin G signaling. Fig. 5A shows that thrombin and PAR agonist peptides activate phosphoinositide hydrolysis, with the predicted differences in peptide agonist specificity and potency for thrombin. IP accumulation is maximally elicited by SFLLRN or 1 unit/ml thrombin in cells that overexpress PAR-1 and by AYPGKF or 10 units/ml thrombin in cells that overexpress PAR-4 (a receptor optimally cleaved by higher thrombin concentrations). In each case, receptor stimulation (proteolytically with thrombin or with peptide agonist) results in the activation of ERK, p38 MAPK, and AKT pathways (Fig. 5, B and C). In contrast, cathepsin G promotes only a very minor increase in the levels of IP1 or IP2/IP3 in cells that overexpress PAR-4; cathepsin G does not detectably elevate IP levels above basal in cells that express PAR-1 (Fig. 5A). Although cathepsin G weakly activates ERK (but not p38 MAPK or AKT) in PAR-1- and PAR-4-expressing cell lines (Fig. 5, B and C), this response displays atypically slow kinetics (peak at 10 min, relative to ERK activation by PARs which is maximal at 5 min). Cathepsin G also induces a similar weak and delayed activation of ERK in PAR–/– cells that do not respond to thrombin or peptide agonists (Fig. 5D). This indicates that the low level of ERK activation by cathepsin G cannot be ascribed to activation of either PAR-1 or PAR-4. Cells that overexpress PAR-1 maintain a spread morphology and remain adherent to substrate during incubation with cathepsin G. In contrast, cells that overexpress PAR-4 round and detach from the underlying matrix during incubation with cathepsin G. These morphological changes do not result from PAR-4 activation, because intense PAR-4 stimulation with either thrombin or AYPGKF does not induce comparable morphologic changes. More likely, the very minor signaling responses induced by cathepsin G in cells that overexpress PAR-4 (in the context of cell detachment from matrix) represent the consequences of cathepsin G-induced alterations in cell adhesion and not proteolytic activation of PAR-4 by cathepsin G. Collectively, these results raise serious doubts that the agonist actions of cathepsin G can be attributed to the activation of either PAR-1 or PAR-4. Cathepsin G Disables PAR-1 but Not PAR-2 or PAR-4 — Cathepsin G cleavage could disable, rather than activate, PARs. Fig. 6A shows that preincubation with cathepsin G for 30 min completely abrogates subsequent IP1 accumulation induced by thrombin in cells that overexpress PAR-1; responses to SFLLRN remain intact, indicating that the receptor remains otherwise structurally intact. Whereas PAR-1 is highly susceptible to cathepsin G-dependent cleavage, preincubation with cathepsin G does not impair subsequent phosphoinositide hydrolysis induced by either thrombin or AYPGKF in cells that overexpress human PAR-4 (Fig. 6B). These results provide further evidence that PAR-4 is not a direct target for cathepsin G actions. Fig. 6C also shows that cathepsin G disables PAR-1 in rat cardiomyocytes; treatment with cathepsin G renders cardiomyocyte cultures refractory to subsequent stimulation by thrombin but not by SFLLRN. These results are noteworthy, because the disabling pro"

The duration and magnitude of purinergic signaling is governed by a network of purine-converting ectoenzymes, and endothelial and lymphoid cells are generally characterized by counteracting ATP-inactivating and ATP-regenerating/adenosine-eliminating, phenotypes, respectively. By using cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells and normal or leukemic lymphocytes as an in vitro model of leukocyte-endothelial interactions, we have identified a link between the adhesion cascade and extracellular purine turnover. Upon adhesion, lymphocytes suppress endothelial purine metabolism via (i) inhibition of ecto-5′-nucleotidase/CD73-mediated AMP hydrolysis, (ii) rapid deamination of the remaining adenosine, and (iii) maintenance of the sustained pericellular ATP level through continuous nucleotide release and phosphotransfer reactions. Compensation of the loss of adenosine promotes vascular barrier function (measured as a paracellular flux of 70 kDa fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran) and decreases transendothelial leukocyte migration. Together, these data show that adherent lymphocytes attempt to prevent adenosine formation in the endothelial environment that, as a consequence, may impair the vascular barrier function and facilitate the subsequent step of leukocyte transmigration into the tissue. These leukocyte adhesion-mediated shifts in the local nucleotide and nucleoside concentrations represent a previously unrecognized paracrine mechanism affecting the functional state of the targeted vascular endothelium and coordinately regulating lymphocyte trafficking between the blood and tissues.

These leukocyte adhesion-mediated shifts in the local nucleotide and nucleoside concentrations represent a previously unrecognized paracrine mechanism affecting the functional state of the targeted vascular endothelium and coordinately regulating lymphocyte trafficking between the blood and tissues. Lymphocyte trafficking between the blood and tissues is essential for the proper function of the immune system. Present hypotheses suggest a multistep model of the leukocyte extravasation, including transient lymphocyte adhesion to the endothelial lining, rolling of the cell along the endothelium, cellular activation, activation-dependent arrest, and finally, transmigration into the tissue (1Springer T.A. Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Google Scholar). Leukocyte-endothelial interactions are dynamic, involve both cell adhesion through specific receptor-ligand pairs and bidirectional cell signaling, and are affected by soluble mediators, which can modulate adhesive molecules and signaling events in both cell types (2Panes J. Perry M. Granger D.N. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 537-550Google Scholar). The role of extracellular purines as important cell modulators has emerged relatively recently. Most models of purinergic signaling depend on functional interactions between distinct processes, including (i) release of endogenous nucleotides through channel-like pathways, secretory exocytosis, or leakage upon cell damage (3Lazarowski E.R.

Most of these effects are mediated through the G protein-coupled platelet P2Y1/P2Y12 and endothelial or lymphoid P2Y1/P2Y2 receptors, as well as via lymphoid “cytolytic” P2X7 and other P2X receptors with intrinsic pore-forming activities (6Di Virgilio F.

The generated adenosine in turn has a non-redundant counteracting role in the attenuation of inflammation and protection from excessive tissue damage in vivo via interaction with its own nucleoside-selective receptors (5Ralevic V.

Particularly, adenosine stimulates angiogenesis and acts as a potent cytoprotective agent (18Spychala J. Pharmacol.

Physiol. 1994; 76: 5-13Google Scholar). Subsequent to signal transduction, adenosine needs to be inactivated either by rapid uptake into the cells (24Griffith D.A. Jarvis S.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1286: 153-181Google Scholar) or via deamination by ecto-adenosine deaminase usually associated in larger complexes with CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV (25Franco R. Valenzuela A. Lluis C.

FASEB J. 2001; 15: 251-260Google Scholar) and other (3Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31061-31068Google Scholar, 27Lazarowski E.R. Homolya L. Boucher R.C.

Chem. 2003; 278: 11256-11264Google Scholar) laboratories. Given that endothelial and lymphoid cells are generally characterized by counteracting ATP-inactivating and ATP-regenerating/adenosine-removing phenotypes, respectively (10Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Samburski S.S. Spychala J. Jalkanen S. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 121-128Google Scholar), these studies were designed to measure purine-converting pathways in the dynamics of leukocyte-endothelial interactions and, in this way, identify a link between the adhesion cascade and extracellular purine turnover. Isolation and Treatment of Cells—HUVEC (passages 2–3) were grown to confluence either on 24-well tissue culture plates (Greiner) or Transwell polycarbonate membranes (0.4- or 5-μm pore sizes; Costar) as described previously (26Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Jalkanen S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 251-260Google Scholar). PBL were isolated from freshly drawn donor blood using Ficoll centrifugations. The B cell lymphoma line Namalwa was from ATCC. In some experiments, the cells were preincubated with soluble apyrase from potato (grade III, 2 units/ml) or recombinant PI-PLC (0.5 units/ml) from Bacillus thuringiensis (both from Sigma), and then washed twice with RPMI 1640. The lymphocytes were also disrupted by sonication (Braun sonicator Labsonic U) and centrifuged for 10 min at 15000 × g to obtain the conventional “crude membrane” (pellet) and cytosolic fractions. The cytosolic fractions were centrifuged through microconcentrator devices (mass cut-off <1 kDa; Pall Filtron) and additionally treated with 8% Norit A (ICN Biomedicals) for elimination of endogenous nucleotides. Ectoenzymatic Interconversion of 3H-Nucleotides—Ecto-nucleotidases were assayed with [2-3H]AMP (specific activity 18.6 Ci/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) and [2,8-3H]ATP (19 Ci/mmol; Sigma) as reported previously (26Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Jalkanen S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 251-260Google Scholar). Endothelial and/or lymphoid cells were co-incubated at 37 °C under gentle orbital rotation in the following ways: (a) HUVEC monolayers were incubated 20 min with lymphocytes (or their subcellular fraction) and then either washed to remove non-adherent cells or directly challenged with 3H-nucleotides; (b) Transwell-Clear membranes (3 μm) were placed onto a plate with cultured HUVEC. Namalwa cells (1 × 106) and [3H]AMP were added to the upper and lower chambers, respectively; (c) for 5′-nucleotidase kinetics, detached HUVEC (5 × 104 cells) were incubated in RPMI 1640 containing 5 mmol/liter β-glycerophosphate, AMP (20–900 μmol/liter) with tracer [3H]AMP and other nucleotides or lymphocytes. Adenine nucleotides/nucleosides were separated by thin layer chromatography and quantified by scintillation counting (31Yegutkin G.G. Burnstock G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1373: 227-236Google Scholar). Quantification of Extracellular ATP—Cultured HUVEC and/or Namalwa cells (1.5 × 106 per well) were incubated in 24-well plates, and extracellular ATP was quantified by luciferin-luciferase assay as described previously (26Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Jalkanen S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 251-260Google Scholar). Lymphocyte Binding to Endothelial Cells—Namalwa cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in RPMI 1640 containing 15 μg/ml biscarboxyethyl carboxyfluorescein, acetoxymethyl ester (BCECF) (Lambda Fluoreszenztechnologie) and 5% fetal calf serum and rinsed to remove non-bound dye. BCECF-labeled lymphocytes were incubated with HUVEC monolayers for 60 min at 37 °C under orbital rotation in the final volume of 250 μl of RPMI 1640. After intensive washing, the adherent lymphocytes were detached by using 5 mmol/liter EDTA, harvested into white non-phosphorescent microplate (Cliniplate), and quantified with a TECAN Ultra fluoropolarimeter (excitation/emission wavelengths 485/545 nm). Paracellular Permeability Assay—Using a modification of the method previously described (20Lennon P.F. Taylor C.T. Stahl G.L. Colgan S.P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1433-1443Google Scholar), HUVEC monolayers grown on polycarbonate permeable inserts (0.4-μm pore size) were placed into 24-well plates containing 0.8 ml RPMI 1640. Namalwa cells (5 × 105 per well) were added to inserts and preincubated for 20 min in the final volume of 200 μl of RPMI 1640 without or with 50 μmol/liter exogenous adenosine. The assay was started by addition of 3.5 μmol/liter FITC-dextran 70 kDa (ICN Biomedicals) to fluid within the insert, and the plates were incubated at 37 °C under orbital rotation (60 rpm). Aliquots of the assay medium from the lower chamber were transferred to the white 96-well microplate and assayed for FITC-dextran concentration (excitation, 485 nm; emission 545 nm; TECAN-Ultra). Transmigration Studies—For transmigration studies, Namalwa cells were labeled by incubation for 10 min at 37 °C with 10 μmol/liter CFSE (Molecular Probes) in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. HUVEC monolayers grown on permeable inserts (5 μm pore size) were placed into 24-well white Visiplate (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) containing 0.9 ml of RPMI 1640 medium and 50 ng/ml B-lymphocyte chemoattractant (R&D Systems). The inserts were preincubated for 20 min with 100 μl of RPMI 1640 (alone or with 50 μmol/liter adenosine) prior to addition of lymphocytes. Meantime, CFSE-labeled Namalwa were also treated for 20 min in the absence or presence of adenosine (50 μmol/liter) followed by direct transfer of 100 μl of lymphocyte suspension (5 × 105 cells) to the insert with HUVEC monolayers. The plates were gently rotated for 3.5 h at 37 °C, and fluorescence in the lower chamber was directly measured by using TECAN-Ultra fluoropolarimeter (excitation, 485 nm; emission 545 nm). To correct for the nonspecific leakage of the fluorescent dye, CFSE-labeled lymphocytes were also incubated in parallel 0.4-μm Transwells, and this background fluorescence was taken into account during calculation of the number of transmigrated lymphocytes. Dot-blot and Immunoblotting Analyses—HUVEC monolayers were incubated for1hat37 °C in the absence and presence of Namalwa (1 × 106 cells) or PI-PLC (0.5 units/ml). The medium was collected, and soluble CD73 molecules were determined by dot-blot assay with anti-CD73 mAb 4G4 as described (32Airas L. Niemela J. Salmi M. Puurunen T. Smith D.J. Jalkanen S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 421-431Google Scholar). HUVEC with adherent lymphocytes were pooled from four similar wells and subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE. Because Namalwa-challenged HUVEC contained adherent lymphocytes, the amounts of the lysate loaded per lane were adjusted per number of endothelial cells in the wells rather than per total protein amount. Ecto-5′-nucleotidase was detected by using rabbit polyclonal antibody against human ecto-5′-nucleotidase (gift from Dr. Jozef Spychala) and normal rabbit serum (1:100) as a negative control, as described previously (10Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Samburski S.S. Spychala J. Jalkanen S. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 121-128Google Scholar). Cell Surface Biotinylation—The endothelial surface proteins were biotinylated either before or after the incubation of cultured HUVEC with Namalwa cells. The cells were incubated for 40 min at 37 °C in a final volume of 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimido-biotin (Pierce), 0.1 mmol/liter CaCl2, and 1.0 mmol/liter MgSO4. Cells were solubilized in a lysis buffer containing 50 mmol/liter β-octyl-glucoside, 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% aprotinin (all from Sigma), and the lysates were centrifuged for 40 min at 20000 × g and 4 °C. The biotin-labeled surface proteins were precipitated with immobilized monomeric avidin beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and then eluted from streptavidin pellets with the SDS sample buffer and subjected to 8% SDS-PAGE. Sample volumes were adjusted so that each sample was derived from an equivalent amount of starting material. Biotinylated cell-surface ecto-5′-nucleotidase was detected by using a polyclonal antibody against ecto-5′-nucleotidase as described previously (10Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Samburski S.S. Spychala J. Jalkanen S. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 121-128Google Scholar). Fluorescence Microscopy—Cultured HUVEC were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with or without Namalwa (1.5 × 106 cells), washed, and stained with the following mAbs: 1E9 (gift from Dr. Linda Thompson) and 4G4, both recognizing different epitopes of CD73 but partially inhibiting its catalytic activity; 2C8 against endothelial CD31; and 3G6 against chicken T-cells (32Airas L. Niemela J. Salmi M. Puurunen T. Smith D.J. Jalkanen S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 421-431Google Scholar). For intracellular staining, HUVEC were first fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized by using 0.2% saponin. The second-stage antibody used was a FITC-conjugated anti-mouse Ig (DAKO A/S), and the slides were mounted with Fluoromount and analyzed with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX60). Data Analyses—Statistical comparisons were made using Student's t test, and p values < 0.05 were taken as significant. Ecto-5′-nucleotidase kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax) were calculated by using the Michaelis-Menten equation (GraphPad Prism™, version 3.03; San Diego, CA). Lymphocytes Inhibit Endothelial Ecto-5′-nucleotidase but Not E-NTPDase—In the initial assays, ecto-5′-nucleotidase activity was assayed in cultured HUVEC and PBL suspension and defined as the rate of [3H]AMP conversion into [3H]nucleosides. Both cell types displayed significant AMP-hydrolyzing activity equal to 264 ± 31 (n = 22) and 8.3 ± 1.1 (n = 14) nmol/106 cells/hour, respectively. Surprisingly, co-incubation of HUVEC with PBL was accompanied by decrease of the joint 5′-nucleotidase activity by 18.2 ± 1.2% (n = 12; p < 0.01) as compared with the theoretical sum value of both cell types taken alone (Fig. 1A). Because understanding of the underlying inhibitory mechanisms is hampered by co-expression of ecto-5′-nucleotidase, we pretreated either endothelial or lymphoid cells with PI-PLC (0.5 units/ml), thereby causing shedding of at least 75–80% of the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored 5′-nucleotidase molecules (10Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Samburski S.S. Spychala J. Jalkanen S. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 121-128Google Scholar). Addition of partially 5′-nucleotidase-depleted PBL to the HUVEC still decreased the joint AMP hydrolysis, whereas no significant inhibition was observed after PBL addition to the PLC-treated HUVEC (data not shown). Moreover, ecto-5′-nucleotidase/CD73-negative Namalwa B-cells (Fig. 1A) and Jurkat T-cells (data not shown) inhibited endothelial ecto-5′-nucleotidase even more efficiently as compared with PBL. Together, these data suggest that the inhibition is primarily because of leukocyte-mediated inhibition of endothelial ecto-5′-nucleotidase and that it is not restricted to a certain lymphocyte subpopulation. Use of other nucleotide substrates, [3H]ATP (Fig. 1B) and [3H]ADP (data not shown), did not reveal significant changes in the joint E-NTPDase activities during leukocyte-endothelial interaction. Role of Lymphocyte-derived Nucleotides in Endothelial Ecto-5′-nucleotidase Inhibition—For further experiments we took advantage of the ability of Namalwa cells to inhibit endothelial 5′-nucleotidase in a concentration-dependent fashion (Fig. 2A). After lymphocyte disruption, only cytosolic extracts, but not membrane pellet, are able to inhibit endothelial enzyme, although not as efficiently as intact cells. The cytosolic fraction retained its inhibitory potency after passage through low molecular mass cut-off filters (Fig. 2A), whereas the removal of endogenous nucleotides by Norit A prevented its inhibition of endothelial 5′-nucleotidase (97.2 ± 1.9% of the control activity; n = 2). Direct bioluminescent assay confirmed the presence of relatively high ATP concentrations in Namalwa lysates (933 ± 134 pmol/106 cells, n = 11). Although these data indicate that lymphocyte-derived nucleotides may in principle act as inhibitors of endothelial 5′-nucleotidase, a distinction needs to be drawn between the inhibitory effects of lymphoid cells and their lysates. In the case of intact cells, an alternative mechanism for the nucleotide appearance could be the nonlytic release of endogenous ATP. Both HUVEC and Namalwa maintained ATP at a certain steady-state level as detected by luciferin-luciferase assay (Fig. 2B). However, because inhibition of endothelial 5′-nucleotidase is only detectable at threshold ATP/ADP concentrations of ∼10–5 mol/liter (26Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Jalkanen S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 251-260Google Scholar), it seems unlikely that nanomolar levels of the released ATP are sufficient to block [3H]AMP hydrolysis in our studies. Removal of extracellular ATP by Namalwa treatment with apyrase did not prevent their inhibitory action on endothelial 5′-nucleotidase, and, furthermore, only slight enzyme inhibition was observed when Transwell chambers with lymphocyte suspension were placed on the top of the wells with cultured HUVEC (Fig. 2C). These data suggest the involvement of other cellular mechanisms in the enzyme inhibition by intact lymphocytes. Endothelial Ecto-5′-nucleotidase Is Primarily Inhibited via Lymphocyte Adhesion—Incubation of HUVEC with Namalwa was accompanied by stable lymphocyte adhesion on the endothelial surface with prominent cluster formation (Fig. 3A). For quantitative analysis, Namalwa cells were labeled with fluorescent dye BCECF. Non-linear regression analysis revealed that lymphocyte binding to the HUVEC fits to a sigmoidal curve (Fig. 3B) with maximum binding capacity of 243 ± 29 × 103 cells per well (n = 5). This is equivalent to about four lymphocytes per one endothelial cell. Importantly, the number of adherent lymphocytes shows a highly significant correlation with their ability to inhibit endothelial 5′-nucleotidase (Fig. 3C), thus allowing us to consider the enzyme inhibition as a direct consequence of lymphocyte binding. Kinetic Evidence That Lymphocytes and Their Lysates Inhibit Endothelial 5′-nucleotidase via Different Mechanisms— Kinetic analysis of [3H]AMP hydrolysis by HUVEC was then performed in the presence of fixed amounts of lymphocytes and other nucleotides as potential ecto-5′-nucleotidase inhibitors. Inhibitor concentrations were chosen to approximate IC50 values found in preliminary competitive experiments with Namalwa cells (see Fig. 2A) and the major enzyme-inhibiting nucleotides AMPCP (α,β-methylene ADP), ADP, and ATP (26Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Jalkanen S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 251-260Google Scholar). Statistical analysis revealed a decrease of the maximal velocity (Vmax) of endothelial 5′-nucleotidase in the presence of lymphocytes (Fig. 4B) without any changes in the apparent Km values (Fig. 4A), thus indicating that these inhibitory effects are non-competitive in nature. Contrary to native lymphocytes, their cytosolic fractions primarily affected the enzyme affinity (manifested in the increased Km value), and this competitive mechanism was similar to that observed with exogenous nucleotides (Fig. 4). These data confirm the existence of two distinct and principally independent inhibitory mechanisms including 1) non-competitive inactivation of endothelial ecto-5′-nucleotidase by adherent lymphocytes and 2) leakage of endogenous NTP/NDP under cell damage and their competition with AMP for the enzyme catalytic site. Lymphocytes Switch Endothelial Purine Metabolism from Adenosine Formation to ATP Re-synthesis via Phosphotransfer Reactions—To evaluate the whole pattern of purine metabolism, HUVEC monolayers and/or Namalwa cells were incubated with 10 μmol/liter [3H]AMP; Fig. 5A depicts a representative thin layer chromatography autoradiography of its major interconversion pathways. HUVEC ecto-5′-nucleotidase efficiently converted AMP into nucleosides with adenosine being the major metabolite (lane 2). Co-incubation of Namalwa with HUVEC prevented adenosine appearance, first via inhibition of ecto-5′-nucleotidase-mediated AMP hydrolysis and second, by rapid adenosine conversion via inosine to hypoxanthine (lane 4). Inhibitor of adenosine deaminase erythro-9-(2-hydroxy-3-nonyl)adenine hydrochloride (EHNA) blocked further conversion of adenosine in the experiments with HUVEC, either alone (lane 3) or in combination with lymphocytes (lane 5). These findings are consistent with our recent studies showing that a significant portion of [3H]adenosine is directly inactivated by ecto-adenosine deaminase expressed on the lymphoid and, to a lesser extent, endothelial surface (10Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Samburski S.S. Spychala J. Jalkanen S. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 121-128Google Scholar). Notably, the amount of radioactivity retained by lymphocytes during their incubation with HUVEC and [3H]AMP did not exceed 0.5–0.7% of total radioactivity added. This value was not affected by inhibitors of the nucleoside transport NBTI and dipyridamole (data not shown), thus allowing us to exclude possible uptake of nucleotide-derived adenosine into the cells. Although Namalwa were unable to degrade [3H]AMP, these cells were capable of converting [3H]AMP into [3H]ADP (Fig. 5A, lane 6). Further time-course analysis revealed that this [3H]AMP phosphorylation was only partially inhibited after lymphocyte pretreatment with soluble apyrase as well as during co-incubation of Namalwa cells with HUVEC (Fig. 5B). Because this backward AMP phosphorylation is mediated via ecto-adenylate kinase reaction and requires γ-phosphate-donating ATP (10Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Samburski S.S. Spychala J. Jalkanen S. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 121-128Google Scholar, 26Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Jalkanen S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 251-260Google Scholar), these data may suggest that lymphocytes continuously maintain certain levels of apyrase-resistant pericellular ATP that are sufficient for activation of phosphotransfer reactions even during leukocyte-endothelial interactions. Inactivation of Endothelial Ecto-5′-nucleotidase/CD73 by Lymphocytes Does Not Involve Enzyme Internalization, Sequestration, or Shedding—Because ecto-5′-nucleotidase on various cell types is attributed to the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositolanchored surface antigen CD73 sharing both enzymatic and antigenic properties (32Airas L. Niemela J. Salmi M. Puurunen T. Smith D.J. Jalkanen S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 421-431Google Scholar, 33Resta R. Yamashita Y. Thompson L.F. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 161: 95-109Google Scholar), we performed immunofluorescent staining to follow the fate of the endothelial ecto-5′-nucleotidase/CD73 molecule; these data are summarized in Fig. 6. Cultured HUVEC show intense staining with anti-CD73 antibody 4G4 in a pattern indicative of membrane localization of this antigen (panel A), and it became relatively faint after lymphocyte binding to HUVEC (panel B). Use of another anti-CD73 mAb, 1E9, gave similar staining results (data not shown). The differences in the CD73-specific staining between control (panel C) and lymphocyte-treated (panel D) HUVEC still remained evident after permeabilization of the cells, thus excluding the possibility of endothelial ecto-5′-nucleotidase/CD73 internalization during lymphocyte binding. Such lymphocyte-mediated inhibition is specific for CD73, because the expression of another endothelial molecule CD31 remained unchanged when HUVEC were incubated in the absence (panel E) or presence (panel F) of Namalwa cells. Lymphocyte binding did not stimulate any shedding of 5′-nucleotidase/CD73 from the HUVEC surface, whereas use of PI-PLC treatment as a positive control caused massive release of soluble CD73 molecules into the bathing medium (Fig. 7A). Next, we wanted to examine whether the leukocyte-mediated inhibition of endothelial ecto-5′-nucleotidase/CD73 is accompanied by concurrent loss of surface-associated enzyme itself. Because the available monoclonal anti-CD73 antibodies are not suitable for immunoblotting analysis, we used a polyclonal antibody against a peptide corresponding to residues 155ETPFLSNPGTNLVFGD of the human ecto-5′-nucleotidase (10Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Samburski S.S. Spychala J. Jalkanen S. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 121-128Google Scholar), and a single protein band of ∼70 kDa was clearly detected in HUVEC lysates (Fig. 7B). The total pool of ecto-5′-nucleotidase molecules remained unchanged after HUVEC incubation with Namalwa (Fig. 7B). Similar results were observed when surface CD73 was biotinylated prior to addition of lymphocytes (Fig. 7C). Importantly, co-incubation of HUVEC and Namalwa with subsequent biotinylation of cell surface proteins revealed significant decrease in the amount of the biotinylated ecto-5′-nucleotidase molecules (Fig. 7C). These data suggest that lymphocytes mask endothelial ecto-5′-nucleotidase without any covalent modification of this ectoenzyme or its sequestration within plasma membrane subdomains. Adenosine Is Important for Regulation of Vascular Barrier Function and Transendothelial Leukocyte Migration—Permeability assays and transmigration studies were then performed by co-incubation of Namalwa suspension with HUVEC monolayers grown on permeable inserts. The cells were pretreated with or without 50 μmol/liter adenosine, thus allowing us to compensate the loss of endogenous adenosine that occurs during leukocyte-endothelial interactions and, in this way, to evaluate the physiological consequences of the leukocyte-mediated suppression of endothelial metabolism. The paracellular permeability assay was first performed by using 0.4-μm Transwells and FITC-labeled dextran (70 kDa). Exogenous adenosine significantly decreased the clearance of FITC-dextran across inserts with endothelial monolayers co-incubated without or with lymphocyte suspension (Fig. 8A). Further transmigration studies revealed that the number of CFSE-labeled Namalwa cells that had migrated across the HUVEC-containing Transwells containing exogenous adenosine was lower when compared with untreated cells (Fig. 8B). Noteworthy, both clearance of FITC-dextran (Fig. 8A) and lymphocyte transmigration (Fig. 8B) across the empty inserts were higher compared with the HUVEC monolayers, thus confirming that endothelial cells in fact serve as a barrier preventing paracellular flux of macromolecules and restraining cell migration. By investigating the combined features of lymphocyte-endothelial interactions and extracellular purine metabolism, we have identified a link between these different but apparently interrelated processes and have additionally shown that endothelial ecto-5′-nucleotidase/CD73 is a potential key target for circulating lymphocytes. Namalwa B-cells caused progressive inhibition of endothelial ecto-5′-nucleotidase activity with a concomitant decrease in the CD73-specific staining of the HUVEC surface. The extent of ecto-5′-nucleotidase inhibition showed a close correlation with the number of adherent lymphocytes, thus allowing us to consider the enzyme inhibition as a direct consequence of lymphocyte-endothelial adhesion. This inhibition was specific for ecto-5′-nucleotidase/CD73 and did not affect the activity of another endothelial ectoenzyme, ENTPDase, or the expression of the HUVEC CD31 molecule. Noteworthy, freshly isolated PBL were also able to inhibit endothelial ecto-5′-nucleotidase, although not as efficiently as leukemic cells. These relatively slight inhibitory effects may be because of co-expression of ecto-5′-nucleotidase/CD73 and heterogeneity of PBL with significant variations in the CD73 expression among lymphocyte subsets (33Resta R. Yamashita Y. Thompson L.F. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 161: 95-109Google Scholar). Taking into account the existence of highly efficient shuttle mechanisms between extra- and intracellular 5′-nucleotidase pools in some cells types (32Airas L. Niemela J. Salmi M. Puurunen T. Smith D.J. Jalkanen S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 421-431Google Scholar, 34Zimmermann H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 345-365Google Scholar), one might suggest a down-regulation of the endothelial enzyme under lymphocyte adhesion via rapid internalization and/or prevention of its recycling on the cell surface. However, this seems unlikely because at least 85–90% of ecto-5′-nucleotidase/CD73 molecules are located on the HUVEC surface (10Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Samburski S.S. Spychala J. Jalkanen S. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 121-128Google Scholar). Moreover, HUVEC permeabilization did not provide evidence for endothelial enzyme accumulation in intracellular stores upon lymphocyte adhesion. Alternatively, the enzyme may be shed from the cell surface, as was demonstrated earlier with glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored ecto-5′-nucleotidase/CD73 and other purine-converting ectoenzymes during mAb triggering (32Airas L. Niemela J. Salmi M. Puurunen T. Smith D.J. Jalkanen S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 421-431Google Scholar), shear stress stimulation (35Yegutkin G. Bodin P. Burnstock G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 129: 921-926Google Scholar), and certain chemical stimuli (29Donaldson S.H. Picher M. Boucher R.C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 209-215Google Scholar). However, we were unable to detect release of soluble 5′-nucleotidase/CD73 during HUVEC incubation with lymphocytes. Immunoblotting analysis with polyclonal antibody also did not reveal any lymphocyte-mediated loss or irreversible inactivation of endothelial ecto-5′-nucleotidase itself. Together, these results suggest selective masking of the endothelial ecto-5′-nucleotidase/CD73 molecule and inhibition of its catalytic activity by adherent lymphoid cells directly on the cell surface, presumably via a temporal and non-competitive mechanism. We also revealed yet another mechanism of competitive ecto-5′-nucleotidase inhibition by endogenous nucleotides, but it occurs only after the disruption of lymphocytes. Although these data fit well with the known feed-forward inhibition of endothelial 5′-nucleotidase by micromolar concentrations of precursor ATP/ADP (8Meghji P. Pearson J.D. Slakey L.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 725-731Google Scholar, 26Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Jalkanen S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 251-260Google Scholar), this inhibitory mechanism is presumably restricted to sites of traumatic tissue injury with massive nucleotide release from the damaged cells and/or dense granules of activated platelets. In parallel with inhibition of endothelial ecto-5′-nucleotidase/CD73, lymphocytes efficiently deaminated nucleotide-derived adenosine, thereby providing a supplementary scavenging mechanism that prevented adenosine appearance during lymphocyte-endothelial adhesion. An important point of consideration is whether this leukocyte-mediated elimination of adenosine via the dual mechanism of inhibition of endothelial ecto-5′-nucleotidase and catalytic deamination of the remaining nucleoside is relevant to basal and/or acute inflammatory responses in vivo. Extracellular adenosine has been shown to enhance vascular barrier function by activating endothelial A2B receptors (19Richard L.F. Dahms T.E. Webster R.O. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: H35-H42Google Scholar, 20Lennon P.F. Taylor C.T. Stahl G.L. Colgan S.P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1433-1443Google Scholar) and to interfere with leukocyte-endothelial adhesion via occupancy of A2A receptors on stimulated neutrophils (17Sitkovsky M.V. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 65: 493-501Google Scholar, 23Cronstein B.N. J. Appl. Physiol. 1994; 76: 5-13Google Scholar). Because the released adenine nucleotides provide the major source of extracellular adenosine, directional regulation of ecto-5′-nucleotidase-mediated AMP hydrolysis significantly affects permeability changes in the vascular endothelium (20Lennon P.F. Taylor C.T. Stahl G.L. Colgan S.P. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1433-1443Google Scholar) and intestinal epithelial cells (21Synnestvedt K. Furuta G.T. Comerford K.M. Louis N. Karhausen J. Eltzschig H.K. Hansen K.R. Thompson L.F. Colgan S.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 993-1002Google Scholar) and inhibits neutrophil function at inflamed sites in the murine air porch model of inflammation (36Morabito L. Montesinos M.C. Schreibman D.M. Balter L. Thompson L.F. Resta R. Carlin G. Huie M.A. Cronstein B.N. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 295-300Google Scholar). Our permeability and transmigration studies confirm the important role of adenosine in the maintenance of vascular barrier function and further demonstrate for the first time that selective inhibition of endothelial ecto-5′-nucleotidase activity occurs in the dynamics of leukocyte-endothelial adhesion, and it may serve as a prerequisite for facilitation of subsequent leukocyte transmigration into the tissue. Another relevant point is that, because ecto-5′-nucleotidase serves as a “master switch” between two counteracting, ATP-consuming and ATP-generating extracellular pathways (26Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Jalkanen S. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 251-260Google Scholar), inhibition of this endothelial ectoenzyme by adherent lymphocytes directionally shifts the joint purine metabolism toward continuous ATP regeneration via phosphotransfer reactions. By using luciferase-based luminometric assay, we showed that lymphoid cells steadily maintain extracellular ATP at a certain nanomolar range that basically represents a net balance between the constitutive release of endogenous ATP and/or its ectoenzymatic interconversion (3Lazarowski E.R. Boucher R.C. Harden T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31061-31068Google Scholar). Noteworthy, incubation of Namalwa cells with [3H]AMP caused its significant transphosphorylation via an ecto-adenylate kinase reaction that occurs even in the absence of exogenous γ-phosphate-donating ATP and remains resistant to treatment with apyrase (Ref. 10Yegutkin G.G. Henttinen T. Samburski S.S. Spychala J. Jalkanen S. Biochem. J. 2002; 367: 121-128Google Scholar; see also Fig. 5). Recent luminometric assays with firefly luciferase stably adsorbed onto the platelet surface (37Beigi R. Kobatake E. Aizawa M. Dubyak G.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C267-C278Google Scholar); confocal microscopy studies with pancreatic acini (4Sorensen C.E. Novak I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32925-32932Google Scholar) also showed transient formation of relatively high (micromolar) concentrations of apyrase-resistant pericellular ATP that differ from the “bulk” extracellular ATP pool. The ability of lymphocytes to retain the elevated pericellular ATP level may provide an efficient paracrine mechanism for leukocyte-governed triggering of purinergic signaling in the targeted endothelial cell. In conclusion, the results presented here demonstrate that the pattern of purine metabolism is selectively disturbed during leukocyte adhesion, thereby affecting the functional state of the targeted endothelium and leading to a preponderance of pro-inflammatory mechanisms. These findings provide a novel insight into the leukocyte adhesion-mediated changes of vascular endothelium such as disorganization of inter-endothelial junctions (38Del Maschio A. Zanetti A. Corada M. Rival Y. Ruco L. Lampugnani M.G. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 497-510Google Scholar), impairment of barrier function and promotion of transendothelial leukocyte migration (this study), and transfer of Ca2+ fluxes to the counter endothelial cells (39Pfau S.

https://openalex.org/W2084087272,"Apoptotic resistance of cancer cells may be overcome by the combination of treatments that activate the two major apoptotic pathways: (i) the death receptor pathway activated by death ligands and (ii) the DNA damage pathway activated by chemotherapy. We have previously shown that mesothelioma cells, resistant to most treatments, are sensitive to the combination of the death ligand tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL/Apo2L) plus chemotherapy. We investigated a possible role for c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in the synergistic effect, knowing that JNK can be activated separately by TRAIL and by DNA damage. We chose to study the M28 and REN human mesothelioma cell lines, which are p53-inactivated, to avoid an interaction between p53 and JNK. We showed that JNK was activated by TRAIL and by etoposide and that the activation was enhanced by the combination of the two treatments. We found this activation to be caspase-independent. To inhibit the JNK pathway, we used either dominant-negative constructs of JNK1 and JNK2 (compared with dominant-negative caspase 9) or a chemical inhibitor of the JNK pathway (SP600125). In cells treated with TRAIL plus etoposide, JNK inhibition increased cell survival and decreased apoptosis significantly. In transfected M28 cells, the effect of JNK inhibition was as great as that of the dominant-negative caspase 9 construct. We conclude that JNK contributes to the synergistic effect of TRAIL combined with DNA damage by mediating signals independent of p53 leading to apoptosis.

Defects in normal apoptotic programs contribute to the formation of tumors (1Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21872) Google Scholar) and interfere with the tumor response to conventional therapy (2Schmitt C.A. Lowe S.W. J. Mol.

Abnormal apoptotic responses may arise from defective apoptotic machinery, as by mutation in p53 or up-regulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma-2), which provide both a survival advantage and resistance to therapy (4Johnstone R.W. Ruefli A.A. Lowe S.W. Cell. 2002; 108: 153-164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1974) Google Scholar). Among strategies to bypass sites of apoptotic resistance are the use of death receptor ligands that can directly engage the apoptotic caspases of the cell. Indeed, one death receptor ligand, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL/Apo2L), 1The abbreviations used are: TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; MKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; SAPK, stress-activated protein kinase; MKK, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; X-gal, 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. appears to have selective activity toward transformed or malignant cells (5Ashkenazi A.

Invest. 1999; 104: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar). In some cases, the action of TRAIL and other death ligands can be enhanced significantly by concomitant DNA damage resulting in a synergistic apoptotic response. Although this synergistic apoptosis has been described in many tumor cells (6Bonavida B. Ng C.P. Jazirehi A. Schiller G. Mizutani Y. Int. J. Oncol. 1999; 15: 793-802PubMed Google Scholar), the mechanism is not yet understood. Understanding the mechanism of synergy between two different apoptotic stimuli that effectively bypass sites of apoptotic resistance may provide insights into more effective anti-tumor approaches.Death receptor ligands and DNA damage are considered to activate two separate pathways of apoptosis, each potentially leading to caspase activation and disassembly of the cell (7Scaffidi C.

Death receptor ligands, such as Fas ligand and TRAIL, trimerize their receptors and thereby recruit and activate an initiator caspase, caspase 8. DNA damaging agents engage apoptosis in a parallel fashion by altering mitochondrial function, thereby releasing pro-apoptotic molecules such as cytochrome c from the intermembranous space, resulting in part in an activation of another initiator caspase, caspase 9. These initiator caspases can then activate downstream caspases such as caspase 3 leading to a cleavage of key cellular components as the terminal and irreversible phase of apoptotic death. Simultaneous activation of the two alternate pathways, also referred to as the extrinsic (death receptor) and intrinsic (damage) pathways, may induce common signaling pathways that mediate cross-talk and amplification of the resultant apoptosis.One potential apoptotic signaling pathway known to be engaged by both death receptors and by DNA damage is the c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase (JNK/SAPK) pathway (9Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3591) Google Scholar). Although the pathway is strongly activated by a variety of apoptotic stimuli, the role of JNK in apoptosis is unclear, because it has been shown to be pro-apoptotic, neutral, or anti-apoptotic in different settings (9Davis R.J. Cell. 2000; 103: 239-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3591) Google Scholar, 10Herr I. Debatin K.M. Blood. 2001; 98: 2603-2614Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). In many circumstances, single agents, such as chemotherapeutics alone or death receptor ligands alone, induce JNK signaling but do not depend on JNK signals for apoptotic responses. For example, a lack of dependence on JNK signals has been shown for apoptosis because of chemotherapeutic agents such as etoposide (11Jarvis W.D. Johnson C.R. Fornari F.A. Park J.S. Dent P. Grant S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 1384-1392PubMed Google Scholar) or doxorubicin (12Herr I. Wilhelm D. Bohler T. Angel P. Debatin K.M. Int. J. Cancer. 1999; 80: 417-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) or to death receptor activation via TRAIL (13Muhlenbeck F. Haas E. Schwenzer R. Schubert G. Grell M. Smith C. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33091-33098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 14Hu W.H. Johnson H. Shu H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30603-30610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, when different stimuli given simultaneously produce amplified responses, the amplification of these two pathways may involve cross-talk utilizing such stress signals. Indeed, in the case of proliferative stimuli, JNK signaling may be involved in synergistic responses (15Levings M.K. Bessette D.C. Schrader J.W. Blood. 1999; 93: 3694-3702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of apoptotic stimuli, induction of JNK signaling has been proposed to enhance apoptotic responses to tumor necrosis factor (16Widmann C. Johnson N.L. Gardner A.M. Smith R.J. Johnson G.L. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2439-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and to Fas (17Curtin J.F. Cotter T.G. Brit. J. Cancer. 2002; 87: 1188-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Costa-Pereira A.P. McKenna S.L. Cotter T.G. Br. J. Cancer. 2000; 82: 1827-1834Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). JNK signals could thus be important for synergistic apoptotic responses and, if so, could potentially be manipulated to potentiate cancer therapies.We have previously described synergistic apoptotic responses in chemoresistant mesothelioma cell lines to the combination of TRAIL and DNA damaging agents (e.g. chemotherapy or γ irradiation) that were not due to up-regulation of TRAIL receptors, DR4 and DR5 (19Liu W. Bodle E. Chen J.Y. Gao M. Rosen G.D. Broaddus V.C. Am. J. Resp. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In part because mesothelioma is reported to express wild-type p53 (20Mor O. Yaron P. Huszar M. Yellin A. Jakobovitz O. Brok-Simoni F. Rechavi G. Reichert N. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1997; 16: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), we investigated whether p53 was involved in either synergy or in a p53-dependent JNK activation. We found that these cells had nonfunctional p53. Therefore, we asked whether JNK signals played a p53-independent role in the synergistic apoptotic responses. We describe a significant role for JNK signals in the synergistic apoptosis induced by TRAIL and the topoisomerase inhibitor, etoposide.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Human recombinant TRAIL (375-TL, histidine-tagged extracellular domain; Thr95–Gly281) was purchased from R & D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). The chemotherapeutic agent, etoposide, was purchased from Bedford Laboratories (Bedford, OH). Inhibitor of caspases zVAD-fmk (a pan-caspase inhibitor) was purchased from R & D Systems, Inc. and prepared as a stock in Me2SO (Sigma) at 60 ng/ml. SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, was a gift of the Signal Research Division of the Celgene Corporation (San Diego, CA). SP600125 was stored as stock in Me2SO at 20 mm and diluted in warm medium immediately prior to use. LipofectAMINE and LipofectAMINE PLUS reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. X-gal reagent was purchased from Sigma.Plasmids containing dominant-negative or wild-type constructs (empty-pcDNA3, pcDNA3-caspase 9 dominant-negative, pcDNA3-JNK1 wild-type, pcDNA3-JNK1 dominant-negative, pcDNA3-JNK2 wild-type, and pcDNA3-JNK2 dominant-negative) were gifts from Dr. Roger Davis (University of Massachusetts, Boston, MA) (21Gupta S. Campbell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 389-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (1336) Google Scholar).Antibodies against total SAPK/JNK and phosphorylated mitogenactivated protein kinase signaling proteins (phospho-SAPK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185) and phospho-c-Jun (Ser63)II) were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA). Anti-FLAG antibody (M2) was purchased from Sigma. Antibodies against p53 (DO-1) and p21 (F-5) and secondary antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA).Cell Lines and Culture—The human mesothelioma line, M28, was obtained from Dr. Brenda Gerwin (NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), and the human mesothelioma line REN was obtained from Dr. Steven Albelda (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). Primary human mesothelial cells were obtained from benign pleural effusions as described (22Boylan A.M. Sanan D.A. Sheppard D. Broaddus V.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1987-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) under approval of the Committee on Human Research and used as controls.Tumor cell lines and primary cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/RPMI 1640 (1:1), 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), l-glutamine (2 mm; Invitrogen), penicillin (100 units/ml; Invitrogen), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml; Invitrogen).General Experimental Conditions—TRAIL and etoposide were used at concentrations found to induce a synergistic apoptosis (4–20 ng/ml TRAIL and 3–15 μg/ml etoposide). For apoptosis studies, the cells were plated at 50,000 cells/well of 12-well plates the day before and exposed to treatments for described times. Ultraviolet irradiation was used as a positive control for JNK signaling; irradiation by UV-C was performed in a Stratalinker UV cross-linker model 1800 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) at a dose of 40–120 J/m2.Western Blotting Analysis—Protein analysis was performed on whole cell lysates prepared on ice from 15-cm plates of M28 cells at 70% confluence after the appropriate treatment. The lysis buffer consisted of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 137 mm NaCl, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate, pH 8, and protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA). The protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay.The samples (40 μg/lane) were boiled for 5 min with sample buffer (0.2 m Tris, pH 6.8, 5% SDS, 3% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue), separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P; Millipore, Bedford, MA). The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk (in PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody in 5% bovine serum albumin (in PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20). The membranes were washed six times for 5 min each in PBS and incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature in 5% nonfat milk (in PBS plus 0.05% Tween 20). After washing, the blots were developed using ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and autoradiography film (Kodak). The molecular weights were determined by comparison with Bio-Rad Kaleidoscope markers.Annexin V Assay for Apoptosis—Apoptosis was detected by the binding of fluorescent protein annexin V-Cy3 or annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate to the phosphatidylserine residues on the outer leaflet of the apoptotic membrane, as previously described (19Liu W. Bodle E. Chen J.Y. Gao M. Rosen G.D. Broaddus V.C. Am. J. Resp. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because fewer than 5% of cells in any condition stained with propidium iodide, necrosis was considered minimal, and all annexin-V positive cells were considered apoptotic.The cells were trypsinized and stained according to the annexin V-Cy3 or annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate kit (Medical & Biological Laboratories, Naka-ku Nagoya, Japan). The cells were analyzed using a FAC-Sort flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ), with acquisition of a total of 10,000 events/sample to ensure adequate mean data. Data analysis was performed with the CellQuest software, version 3-1 f (Becton Dickinson).Cell Transfection—Dominant-negative caspase 9, JNK1 and JNK2 plasmids, wild-type JNK1 and JNK2 plasmids, and empty pcDNA3 plasmid were transiently transfected in M28 cells along with a pCMV-β galactosidase vector. The cells were plated in 6-well plates at 0.25 × 106 cells/well. The next day, a total of 1.5 μg of DNA was used at a 5:1 ratio (pcDNA:pCMV-β-galactosidase). The cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE and LipofectAMINE PLUS reagents following the manufacturer's instructions. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were exposed to TRAIL (4 ng/ml) plus etoposide (3 μg/ml) for 6 h. The cells were washed and fixed in 0.05% glutaraldehyde for 1 min. To identify β-galactosidase enzyme activity, the fixed cells were washed three times with PBS and stained in buffer containing X-gal (1 mg/ml X-gal in 10 mm Na3PO4, pH 7, 5 mm K3Fe(CN)6, 5 mm K4Fe(CN)6·3H2O, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.02% Nonidet P-40, and 0.01% SDS) overnight at 37 °C. Blue cells were counted as a ratio of total cells (blue/total) as a measure of survival in a blinded fashion and compared among the different experimental conditions. For each plasmid, the relative survival of transfected cells was calculated as the survival (blue/total cells) of cells exposed to TRAIL plus etoposide divided by the survival (blue/total cells) of cells not exposed.Statistics—One-way analysis of variance with Tukey's posthoc test was performed using GraphPad Prism version 3.02 for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Synergy was assessed by isobolographic analysis (23Tallarida R.J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 298: 865-872PubMed Google Scholar) and by showing that the apoptosis to the combination of agents was significantly greater than additive (e.g. apoptosis to TRAIL plus etoposide was significantly greater than the sum of apoptosis to TRAIL plus apoptosis to etoposide). A p < 0.05 was considered significant.RESULTSTRAIL plus DNA Damage Induces Synergistic Apoptosis in Mesothelioma Cells—As previously shown (19Liu W. Bodle E. Chen J.Y. Gao M. Rosen G.D. Broaddus V.C. Am. J. Resp. Cell Mol. Biol. 2001; 25: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the M28 and REN mesothelioma cell lines are not sensitive to TRAIL or etoposide when given separately but show a synergistic apoptotic response to the combination of the two treatments. At 16 h, M28 and REN cells show little apoptosis to TRAIL (20 ng/ml) or etoposide (15 μg/ml) but significantly increased apoptosis to the combination (TRAIL + etoposide) (Fig. 1).p53 Is Inactive in M28 and REN Mesothelioma Cells—To determine whether p53 could mediate this synergy, we studied the functional role of p53 in these cells. We exposed M28, REN, and primary mesothelial cells, as a positive control, to a range of UV irradiation shown to induce p53 in many cell lines (24Goukassian D.A. Eller M.S. Yaar M. Gilchrest B.A. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 112: 25-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and harvested the cells 16 h after UV exposure for determining expression of p53. As expected, p53 protein increased in primary human mesothelial cells, but no p53 protein was detected in M28 and REN cells (Fig. 2). As confirmation for nonfunctional p53, we demonstrated p21 up-regulation in response to UV irradiation in primary cells but not in M28 and REN cells (data not shown).Fig. 2p53 function in M28 and REN mesothelioma cells. p53 protein expression increased in primary human mesothelial cells 16 h after UV irradiation but failed to show expression in M28 and REN mesothelioma cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)JNK Is Activated in Mesothelioma Cells by TRAIL, Etoposide, and the Combination—To confirm that JNK can be activated in M28 and REN cell lines, we exposed the cells to UV light (40 J/m2) as a well characterized stimulus for JNK signaling and harvested them 30 min later to measure the phosphorylation of JNK and total JNK expression. We found that JNK was phosphorylated without a change in total JNK protein expression (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3JNK activation induced by UV irradiation, as a positive control, and by TRAIL, etoposide, and TRAIL plus etoposide in M28 and REN cells. A, JNK phosphorylation was confirmed in M28 and REN cells exposed to UV irradiation, a well characterized stimulus for JNK signaling. In cells harvested 30 min after exposure to UV (40 J/m2), phospho-JNK increased without a change in total JNK protein. B, JNK phosphorylation increased 2–16 h after exposure to TRAIL (10 ng/ml) or to etoposide (15 μg/ml) but was enhanced after exposure to the combination of TRAIL plus etoposide. Total JNK was not different at any time. C, JNK phosphorylation was not dependent on caspases. In cells exposed to TRAIL (20 ng/ml) plus etoposide (15 μg/ml) for 2–16 h, JNK phosphorylation was not inhibited by z-VAD (100 μm), at a concentration that inhibited apoptosis, showing that JNK activation is proximal to the apoptotic process.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We then studied the effect of TRAIL, etoposide, or both. When given alone, TRAIL (20 ng/ml) and etoposide (15 μg/ml) each induced JNK phosphorylation; when given together, these agents induced enhanced JNK phosphorylation (Fig. 3B).JNK Activation Precedes Apoptosis and Is Not Secondary to Caspase Activation—In some settings, JNK signaling by TRAIL or by etoposide may be secondary to the apoptotic process itself (11Jarvis W.D. Johnson C.R. Fornari F.A. Park J.S. Dent P. Grant S. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 1384-1392PubMed Google Scholar, 13Muhlenbeck F. Haas E. Schwenzer R. Schubert G. Grell M. Smith C. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33091-33098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). To address whether activation of JNK by TRAIL plus etoposide in our studies was secondary to apoptosis, we inhibited apoptosis using the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk. M28 cells were exposed to the combination of TRAIL and etoposide for different times (2–16 h) with or without pretreatment with zVAD-fmk (100 μm), which inhibited apoptosis. JNK phosphorylation was not inhibited by zVAD-fmk and, in fact, may have been greater after caspase inhibition, as has been described previously (Fig. 3C) (13Muhlenbeck F. Haas E. Schwenzer R. Schubert G. Grell M. Smith C. Scheurich P. Wajant H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33091-33098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus, the JNK signals associated with synergistic apoptosis are proximal to the apoptosis itself.Inhibition of JNK1, JNK2, and Caspase 9 by Dominant-negative Constructs Increases Survival of M28 Cells after Exposure to TRAIL plus Etoposide—To know whether JNK contributes to the cooperative effect of TRAIL plus chemotherapy in mesothelioma cells, we inhibited JNK by transiently transfected dominant-negative JNK1 and JNK2 plasmids and the combination of the two plasmids. We also transfected a caspase 9 dominant-negative plasmid as a control for blockade of the post-mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Because of toxicity to REN cells, we were able only to transfect M28 successfully.First, to confirm successful transfection, we investigated protein expression of FLAG, the peptide tag used for the pcDNA dominant-negative constructs. As a negative control, we used an empty pcDNA plasmid without a FLAG tag. FLAG expression was detected for caspase 9, JNK1, and JNK2 dominant-negative transfected cells at the expected sizes of the tagged construct; no FLAG expression was detected in the cells transfected with the empty plasmid (Fig. 4A).Fig. 4Inhibition of JNK by dominant-negative constructs in M28 cells. A, FLAG expression in M28 cells transiently transfected with pcDNA (empty plasmid) or dominant-negative constructs (caspase 9, JNK1, or JNK2) demonstrated successful transfection of constructs. The arrowheads show FLAG detection at bands corresponding to the transfected protein. (The blot is representative of several performed on cells studied in parallel with those in C.) B, c-Jun phosphorylation was inhibited by dominant-negative JNK1 and JNK2. M28 cells were transiently transfected with empty plasmid, dominant-negative constructs (caspase 9, JNK1, or JNK2) or wild-type constructs (JNK1 or JNK2). 24 h later, the cells were exposed to UV (40 J/m2) as a standard JNK stimulus and harvested 30 min later for detection of P-c-Jun. Total JNK protein expression did not change. C, relative survival after TRAIL plus etoposide was higher in cells transfected with dominant-negative constructs compared with empty plasmid. M28 cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA3 (empty plasmid) or with various dominant-negative constructs (caspase 9, JNK1, JNK2, and JNK1 + JNK2) at a 5:1 ratio with a β-galactosidase vector. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were exposed to TRAIL (4 ng/ml) plus etoposide (3 μg/ml) for 6 h, washed, fixed, and stained for β-galactosidase activity. The blue cells were counted as a ratio of the total. Relative survival was the survival (blue cells/total cells) of transfected cells exposed to TRAIL plus etoposide divided by the survival (blue cells/total cells) of those not exposed (n = 3; mean ± S.E.; *, p < 0.05 different from relative survival of cells with empty plasmid). D, relative survival after exposure to TRAIL plus etoposide was higher in M28 cells transfected with dominant-negative JNK1 and JNK2 compared with wild-type JNK1 and JNK2 (n = 3; mean ± S.E.; *, p < 0.05 different from relative survival of cells with wild-type plasmid). WT, wild-type; DN, dominant-negative.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Second, to confirm an inhibitory effect of dominant-negative JNK on phosphorylation of its substrate c-Jun, the cells were transiently transfected with several plasmids: pcDNA empty plasmid, dominant-negative caspase 9, JNK1 and JNK2 constructs, and, as controls, JNK1 and JNK2 wild-type constructs and exposed to UV light. At 24 h after transfection, the cells were exposed to UV light (40 J/m2) and harvested 30 min after exposure. A decrease of phospho-c-Jun was shown in the cells transfected with JNK1 and JNK2 dominant-negative constructs compared with those transfected with empty pcDNA, caspase 9 dominant-negative, and JNK1 and JNK2 wild-type constructs (Fig. 4B).Knowing that the dominant-negative constructs were expressed and inhibited c-Jun phosphorylation, we investigated the effect of the inhibition of JNK on the survival of M28 cells exposed to TRAIL plus etoposide. The cells were co-transfected with various plasmids and pCMV-β-galactosidase at a 5:1 ratio and, after 24 h, exposed to TRAIL plus etoposide for 6 h, fixed, and stained for β-galactosidase activity. The blue cells were counted as a ratio of total cells and compared among the different experimental conditions. In cells exposed to TRAIL plus etoposide, inhibition of JNK led to a significant increase of 2–3-fold in relative survival of the dominant-negative transfected cells compared with the empty plasmid transfected cells (Fig. 4C).We confirmed this increase in survival in further experiments using JNK1 and JNK2 wild-type constructs as additional controls for transfection. Compared with transfection with wild-type plasmids, the dominant-negative plasmids increased survival by at least 2-fold in cells exposed to TRAIL plus etoposide (Fig. 4D).Inhibition of the JNK Pathway by Chemical Inhibitor SP600125 Decreases Apoptosis of M28 and REN Cells after Exposure to TRAIL plus Etoposide—To confirm our results using transient transfection and to extend the study to REN cells, we used the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, to investigate its effect on the apoptotic synergistic response of TRAIL plus etoposide in M28 and REN cells (25Han Z.

First, to confirm the effect of the inhibitor, we treated M28 cells with or without SP600125 (20 μm) for 1 h before exposing the cells to UV (40 J/m2) and 30 min later harvested the cells for detection of phospho-c-Jun. We found that UV induction of phospho-c-Jun was inhibited by SP600125. There was no effect on total JNK protein expression (Fig. 5A).Fig. 5Inhibition of JNK by inhibitor SP600125 in M28 and REN cells. A, c-Jun phosphorylation was inhibited by SP600125. M28 cells were pretreated for 1 h with SP600125 (20 μm) or with Me2SO, exposed to UV (40 J/m2) as a standard JNK stimulus, and harvested 30 min later. Total JNK expression did not differ. B, apoptosis to TRAIL plus etoposide was decreased by SP600125 in M28 cells. M28 cells pretreated for 1 h with SP600125 (10, 20, or 50 μm) or the Me2SO control were exposed to TRAIL or TRAIL plus etoposide for 16 h and analyzed by flow cytometry for annexin V binding (n = 3; mean ± S.E.; *, p < 0.05 different from Me2SO).

Crystallographic studies of the tyrosine kinase domain and proximal juxtamembrane region reveal that Tyr-984 interacts with several other conserved residues in the N-terminal lobe of the kinase domain, stabilizing a catalytically nonproductive position of α-helix C. Steady-state kinetics measurements on the soluble kinase domain demonstrate that replacement of Tyr-984 with phenylalanine results in a 4-fold increase in k cat in the unphosphorylated (basal state) enzyme. Moreover, mutation of Tyr-984 in the full-length insulin receptor results in significantly elevated receptor phosphorylation levels in cells, both in the absence of insulin and following insulin stimulation. These data demonstrate that Tyr-984 plays an important structural role in maintaining the quiescent, basal state of the insulin receptor. In addition, the structural studies suggest a possible target site for small molecule activators of the insulin receptor, with potential use in the treatment of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.

The insulin receptor is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) 1The abbreviations used are: RTK, receptor tyrosine kinase; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; IGF1, insulin-like growth factor-1; IRR, insulin receptor-related receptor; IRK, tyrosine kinase domain of the insulin receptor; HEK, human embryonic kidney. family of cell surface receptors. Unlike the majority of RTKs, which are monomeric in the absence of ligand, the insulin receptor is a disulfide-linked heterotetramer comprising two extracellular α subunits and two membrane-spanning β subunits (1Ullrich A.

Upon insulin binding to the α subunits, the insulin receptor undergoes a poorly characterized structural rearrangement that facilitates autophosphorylation of specific tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic portion of the β subunits. Tyrosine autophosphorylation stimulates receptor catalytic (tyrosine kinase) activity (3Rosen O.M. Herrera R. Olowe Y. Petruzzelli L.M. Cobb M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Three tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic juxtamembrane region of the insulin receptor, Tyr-965, Tyr-972, and Tyr-984, are conserved to various extents in the insulin receptor subfamily of RTKs (Fig. 1). This subfamily includes the insulin receptor, the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) receptor, the insulin receptor-related receptor (IRR), and insulin receptor-like proteins in invertebrates such as Daf-2 in Caenorhabditis elegans and DIR in Drosophila melanogaster. Tyr-965, an autophosphorylation site that is not conserved in the invertebrate receptors, appears to be involved in receptor endocytosis (6Rajagopalan M. Neidigh J.L. McClain D.A. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2500-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), and Stat-5b (9Chen J. Sadowski H.B. Kohanski R.A. Wang L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2295-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) via a phosphotyrosinebinding domain in these adapter proteins. Tyr-984 is also invariant in this subfamily, yet its role in insulin receptor signaling has not been determined. Biochemical studies indicate that Tyr-984 is not, to any appreciable extent, a site of autophosphorylation (10Kohanski R.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5773-5780Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 11Favelyukis S. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Miller W.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Previous crystallographic studies on the tyrosine kinase domain of the insulin receptor (IRK) have elucidated the mechanism by which trans-autophosphorylation of tyrosines in the kinase activation loop stimulates catalytic activity (12Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar, 13Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). These studies were performed using a cytoplasmic domain construct comprising the core tyrosine kinase domain (residues 989–1283) and the juxtamembrane region proximal to the kinase domain (residues 978–988). This original construct included two amino acid substitutions in the kinase-proximal juxtamembrane region, Cys-981 → Ser and Tyr-984 → Phe. Cys-981, which is not conserved even among mammalian insulin receptors, was substituted with serine to prevent formation of disulfide-linked dimers in vitro. At the time of the initial structural studies, it was unclear whether Tyr-984 was an autophosphorylation site, and to avoid potential autophosphorylation heterogeneity, this tyrosine was substituted with phenylalanine. Use of the Tyr-984 → Phe IRK protein (IRKY984F) in past structural studies, and the disordered state of Phe-984 therein, has left obscure the function of this conserved tyrosine. To elucidate the role of Tyr-984 in insulin receptor function, we have determined a crystal structure of unphosphorylated IRK containing wild-type Tyr-984. Although crystals of wild-type IRK were obtained, the N-terminal kinase lobe in this crystal form is poorly ordered, and the position of Tyr-984 could not be ascertained. Crystals of a mutant IRK in which conserved Asp-1132 in the catalytic loop was substituted with asparagine (IRKD1132N) diffract to high resolution, and a structure of this protein has been determined at 1.9 Å resolution. In this crystal structure, Tyr-984 is involved in several hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions with residues in α-helix C (αC) and in the five-stranded β sheet in the N-terminal lobe of the kinase. These interactions suggest that Tyr-984 serves a structural role in the kinase activation mechanism. Comparison of the in vitro steady-state kinetics properties of wild-type IRK and IRKY984F shows that the wild-type enzyme has a 4-fold lower k cat than IRKY984F. Moreover, full-length insulin receptors bearing a Tyr-984 → Ala mutation are hyperphosphorylated in transiently transfected mammalian cells, either in the basal (without insulin) state or upon insulin stimulation, consistent with an autoinhibitory role for Tyr-984. These data, together with previous structural studies of activated IRK (13Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar), suggest a novel strategy for designing small molecule activators of the insulin receptor with potential application to noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. IRK Protein Production—Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange system (Stratagene). Mutant IRK cDNAs were subcloned into the baculovirus vector pFastBac (Invitrogen). All of the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Wild-type and mutant IRK proteins (residues 978–1283) were purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells as described by Hubbard et al. (12Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar). Tris-phosphorylated IRK proteins were produced as described by Hubbard (13Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). Crystallographic Studies—Crystals of IRKD1132N were grown at 4 °C by vapor diffusion in hanging drops containing 1.5 μl of protein stock solution (15 mg/ml IRKD1132N, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 170 mm NaCl) plus 1.5 μl of reservoir buffer (20% polyethylene glycol 8000, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 30 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol). The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P212121 with unit cell dimensions a = 57.47 Å, b = 69.48 Å, and c = 88.81 Å when frozen. There is one molecule in the asymmetric unit, and the solvent content is 51%. The crystals were transferred stepwise (in ethylene glycol content) into a cryo-solvent consisting of 20% polyethylene glycol 8000, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 15% ethylene glycol. Data from a single crystal were collected at Beamline X12C at the National Synchrotron Light Source (Brookhaven National Laboratory) and were processed using DENZO and SCALEPACK (14Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). Because the unit cell of the IRKD1132N crystals was very similar to the unit cell of crystals of an Asp-1161 → Ala mutant IRK (15Till J.H. Ablooglu A.J. Frankel M. Bishop S.M. Kohanski R.A.

Chem. 2001; 276: 10049-10055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1I44), 1I44 was used as the starting model for building and refinement of the IRKD1132N structure. Rigid body, positional/B-factor refinement and simulated annealing were carried out with CNS (16Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J.

A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Steady-state Kinetics Measurements—Steady-state kinetics values for wild-type IRK and IRKY984F, both the unphosphorylated (0P) and tris-phosphorylated (3P) forms, were derived using a continuous spectrophotometric assay (18Barker S.C.

Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 650-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). All of the experiments were carried out at 30 °C in 75 μl of buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.2 mg/ml NADH, 111 units/ml pyruvate kinase, and 156 units/ml lactate dehydrogenase (Sigma). For determinations of K m,peptide, reactions contained either 500 nm (0P) or 20 nm (3P) enzyme, 5 mm (0P) or 1 mm (3P) ATP, and 0–12 mg/ml poly-Glu-Tyr peptide (Sigma-Aldrich). For determinations of K m,ATP, reactions contained either 500 nm (0P) or 20 nm (3P) enzyme, 12 mg/ml poly-Glu-Tyr peptide, and 0–5 mm (0P) or 0–1 mm (3P) ATP. Kinetic parameters were determined by fitting data to the Michaelis-Menten equation. The conditions of the continuous assay, initial rate measurements and no buildup of ADP, limit ADP-dependent autodephosphorylation of the enzyme (20Gruppuso P.A. Boylan J.M. Levine B.A. Ellis L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1457-1463Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Rates of ATP consumption for enzyme alone (<10% of rates with peptide) were subtracted before data fitting. Transient Transfection of Wild-type and Tyr-984 → Ala Insulin Receptors in HEK 293T Cells—A mammalian expression vector encoding the full-length insulin receptor (pEF-IR) was kindly provided by Dr. R. Kohanski. Mutations in the insulin receptor were first introduced into the vector pX-CKD, which encodes the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor (21Cann A.D. Kohanski R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7681-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), using the QuikChange system (Stratagene). The mutated pX-CKD insert was cloned into pEF-IR as a 1.6-kb BglI-XbaI fragment as described by Frankel et al. (22Frankel M. Ablooglu A.J. Leone J.W. Rusinova E. Alexander Ross J.B. Heinrikson R.L. Kohanski R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4197-4207Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutant pEF-IR were purified using the Endofree Maxi Kit (Qiagen). HEK 293T cells were seeded in 10-cm tissue culture dishes and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum, reaching ∼60% confluence on the day of transfection. 60 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) and 10 μg of DNA were used to transfect each 10-cm dish according to the protocol supplied by the manufacturer. The cells were split into two 6-well plates 24 h post-transfection and grown for another 24 h in complete medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics). The cells were then serum-starved for 3 h at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (RIA grade, Sigma) prior to insulin stimulation. Bovine insulin (Sigma) was diluted with 10 mm HCl to various concentrations and applied to the cells for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were then placed immediately on ice and washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were lysed by the addition to each well of 200 μl of RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The cell lysates were collected and then clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Proteins in the lysate were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Lysates containing wild-type and mutant insulin receptors were run on the same gel to ensure accurate comparison. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (NitroBond, Osmonics) that were blocked overnight in 5% bovine serum albumin in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Tween 20). Polyclonal rabbit antibodies against phosphotyrosine (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and against the kinase domain of the insulin receptor (provided by Dr. R. Kohanski) were used to detect insulin receptor phosphorylation and protein levels, respectively. Goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as the secondary antibody. Enhanced chemiluminescence (Lightening; Perkin Elmer) was used for signal detection. The phosphorylation content of insulin receptors was determined by scanning the developed films on a Personal Densitometer (Amersham Biosciences), using ImageQuant (version 1.2, Amersham Biosciences) for quantification. Crystal Structure of Unphosphorylated IRKD1132N—The crystal structure of IRKD1132N in its unphosphorylated state was determined by molecular replacement and refined at 1.9 Å resolution. A 2F o – F c electron density map in the vicinity of Tyr-984 is shown in Fig. 2A, and a ribbon diagram of the structure appears in Fig. 2B.

Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar), the activation loop traverses the cleft between the N- and C-terminal lobes of the kinase, and Tyr-1162 in the activation loop functions as a pseudosubstrate inhibitor, hydrogen-bonded to conserved Asp-1132 and Arg-1136 in the catalytic loop. This activation loop conformation, which occludes the active site, is representative of a “gate-closed” conformation (22Frankel M. Ablooglu A.J. Leone J.W. Rusinova E. Alexander Ross J.B. Heinrikson R.L. Kohanski R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4197-4207Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). In the IRKD1132N structure, the substitution of asparagine for Asp-1132 in the catalytic loop disrupts hydrogen bonding between Asp-1132 and Tyr-1162, leading to a “gate-open” conformation in which the activation loop is disengaged from the active site and mostly disordered (Fig. 2B). IRKD1132N has negligible catalytic activity, however, because of the critical role of Asp-1132 in the phosphoryl transfer mechanism (23Ablooglu A.J. Frankel M. Rusinova E. Ross J.B. Kohanski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46933-46940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The overall structure of IRKD1132N is similar to the structure of another IRK mutant, Asp-1161 → Ala, in which loss of four hydrogen bonds mediated by Asp-1161 in the activation loop is responsible for switching the activation loop conformation from gate-closed to gate-open (15Till J.H. Ablooglu A.J. Frankel M. Bishop S.M. Kohanski R.A. Hubbard S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 10049-10055Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The gate-open conformation observed in the IRKD1132N crystal structure is in agreement with solution studies that monitored the accessibility of the active site in this and other IRK mutants (23Ablooglu A.J. Frankel M. Rusinova E. Ross J.B. Kohanski R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 46933-46940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The conformation of the juxtamembrane region proximal to the kinase domain (residues 978–988) in the IRKD1132N structure differs appreciably from those in IRK structures reported previously. In the IRKD1132N structure, this segment lies along αC in the N-terminal kinase lobe (Figs. 2B and 3A). Tyr-984 is partially buried in a hydrophobic pocket formed at the junction between the five-stranded anti-parallel β sheet and αC in the N-terminal lobe (Fig. 3A). In addition to hydrophobic contacts between Tyr-984 and Leu-1045 and Val-1065, the hydroxyl group of Tyr-984 is hydrogen-bonded to Glu-990, another invariant residue in the insulin receptor subfamily. Glu-990 is also hydrogen-bonded to invariant Ser-1067. In fact, a cluster of conserved residues in the insulin receptor subfamily is located in the junction between the juxtamembrane region and the kinase domain: Tyr-984, Asp-987, Trp-989, Glu-990, Ala-1048, Lys-1052, and Ser-1067 (Fig. 3C). In the IRKD1132N structure, Lys-1052 (αC) participates in three hydrogen bonds with juxtamembrane residues, two with the side chain of Asp-987 and one with the main chain of Val-985 (Fig. 3, A and C). This conformation of the juxtamembrane region is further stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the side chain of Asn-1046 (αC) and main chain atoms of Ser-981 (Cys-981 in wild-type IRK) and Val-983 in the juxtamembrane region. Asn-1046 is conserved in insulin and IGF1 receptors and is a lysine in IRR. In the recent crystal structures of the IGF1 receptor kinase domain in its unphosphorylated (24Munshi S. Kornienko M. Hall D.L. Reid J.C. Waxman L. Stirdivant S.M. Darke P.L. Kuo L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38797-38802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or bis-phosphorylated state (25Pautsch A. Zoephel A. Ahorn H. Spevak W. Hauptmann R. Nar H. Structure. 2001; 9: 955-965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the tyrosine equivalent to Tyr-984, Tyr-957, is situated in the same hydrophobic pocket as observed for Tyr-984 in the IRKD1132N structure. Of note, Tyr-957 is hydrogen-bonded to conserved Lys-1025 (Lys-1052 in IRK) in the IGF1 receptor kinase structures, whereas in the IRKD1132N structure, Tyr-984 is hydrogen-bonded to conserved Glu-990. This subtle difference in the positioning of Tyr-984/957 in the insulin/IGF1 receptor kinase structures could be a manifestation of the five-residue insertion in the insulin receptor versus the IGF1 receptor just prior to Tyr-984 (Fig. 1). In the unphosphorylated IRKY984F structure (12Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar), the proximal juxtamembrane region is disposed along αC in approximately the same manner as in the IRKD1132N structure, but the side chain of Phe-984 is exposed to solvent and disordered, and the hydrophobic pocket between αC and the β sheet is instead filled with Val-985. In this juxtamembrane configuration, conserved Trp-989 and Lys-1052 are poorly ordered, and hydrogen bonding between Lys-1052 and conserved Asp-987 is not observed. The conformation of the proximal juxtamembrane region in the tris-phosphorylated, activated IRK structure (13Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar) is markedly different from the conformations in the unphosphorylated IRKD1132N and IRKY984F structures. In the activated kinase, the juxtamembrane segment is disengaged from the β sheet-αC cleft (Fig. 3B). This juxtamembrane conformation is similar to that observed in the structure of the tris-phosphorylated form of the IGF1 receptor kinase domain (11Favelyukis S. Till J.H. Hubbard S.R. Miller W.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar), which contained wild-type tyrosine at residue 957 (Tyr-984 equivalent) and crystallized in a different space group. These structural observations indicate that the phosphorylation state of the activation loop dictates the conformation of the proximal juxtamembrane segment. Steady-state Kinetics Measurements of IRKWT Versus IRKY984F—To determine whether the observed interactions between the proximal juxtamembrane region, specifically Tyr-984, and residues in the N-terminal kinase lobe affect catalytic activity, the steady-state kinetics parameters (k cat, K m,ATP, and K m,peptide) were determined for the purified soluble kinase domains, wild-type IRK (IRKWT), and IRKY984F. Kinetics measurements were performed using a continuous spectrophotometric assay (18Barker S.C. Kassel D.B. Weigl D. Huang X. Luther M.A. Knight W.B.

The data presented in Table II demonstrate that IRKWT is less active than IRKY984F in the basal state. The k cat value for IRKWT is ∼4-fold lower than for IRKY984F, with minor differences in the K m values for ATP and substrate peptide. For tris-phosphorylated IRKWT and IRKY984F, the k cat and K m values are essentially equivalent. The increases in k cat upon phosphorylation of IRKWT and IRKY984F are 15- and 4-fold, respectively, accompanied by a 6-fold decrease in K m,ATP.Table IISteady-state kinetics valuesEnzymeKm ,ATPKm ,peptidekcatmMmg/mlmin-1IRKWT-0P0.80 ± 0.123.96 ± 0.322.25 ± 0.10IRKY984F-0P1.29 ± 0.113.51 ± 0.469.19 ± 0.62IRKWT-3P0.13 ± 0.010.62 ± 0.235.4 ± 0.7IRKY984F-3P0.14 ± 0.010.66 ± 0.238.2 ± 1.6Enzyme abbreviations are: IRKWT-0P, unphosphorylated wild-type IRK; IRKY984F-0P, unphosphorylated Tyr-984 → Phe IRK; IRKWT-3P, tris-phosphorylated wild-type IRK; and IRKY984F-3P, tris-phosphorylated Tyr-984 → Phe IRK.

Transient Transfection of Wild-type and Tyr-984 → Ala Insulin Receptors in Mammalian Cells—Having established from in vitro kinetics studies that Tyr-984 represses catalytic activity in the soluble kinase domain, we tested whether full-length insulin receptors bearing the substitution Tyr-984 → Ala are hyperphosphorylated in cells. HEK 293T cells were transiently transfected with either wild-type or Tyr-984 → Ala insulin receptors, and the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptors prior to and following stimulation with insulin was examined. Multiple independent transfection experiments were performed and gave consistent results. The data shown in Fig. 4 demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation levels in the Tyr-984 → Ala insulin receptors are considerably elevated over the levels in wild-type receptors, both in the basal state and upon insulin stimulation. The extent of phosphorylation in the mutant receptors is particularly striking in the absence of insulin, with an average (n = 5) fold increase over wild type of ∼30. The degree of hyperphosphorylation of mutant versus wild-type receptors diminished as the dose of insulin was increased, yet was still ∼2-fold at 100 nm insulin (Fig. 4B). At the time of the early structural studies of IRK (12Hubbard S.R. Wei L. Ellis L. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1994; 372: 746-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (962) Google Scholar), it was not apparent whether Tyr-984, an invariant tyrosine in the juxtamembrane region of insulin receptor subfamily members, was a site of autophosphorylation, and an expression construct was utilized in which Tyr-984 was replaced by phenylalanine. To elucidate the role of conserved Tyr-984 in insulin receptor function, we expressed and purified an IRK protein from baculovirus-infected insect cells containing tyrosine at residue 984. From initial in vitro experiments, it was evident that wild-type IRK underwent autophosphorylation at a slower rate than IRKY984F. To quantify the catalytic properties of wild-type IRK and IRKY984F, we measured for each enzyme the steady-state kinetics parameters, K m (ATP and substrate peptide) and k cat. The results of these experiments (Table II) indicate that k cat is 4-fold lower for wild-type IRK than for IRKY984F in the basal (unphosphorylated) state. To determine the mechanism by which wild-type IRK is catalytically repressed in the basal state relative to IRKY984F, we determined the crystal structure of unphosphorylated IRK containing Tyr-984. In this structure, the juxtamembrane region proximal to the kinase domain (residues 979–988) lies along αC in the N-terminal kinase lobe, with Tyr-984 situated in a hydrophobic pocket between αC and the β sheet in the N-terminal lobe (Fig. 3A). The interactions of Tyr-984 in the β sheet-αC cleft and a comparison of the αC positions in the unphosphorylated and tris-phosphorylated IRK structures suggest the structural mechanism by which Tyr-984 represses catalytic activity in the basal state. One of the consequences of IRK activation loop autophosphorylation and reconfiguration is the unrestrained rotation of the N-terminal lobe toward the C-terminal lobe (lobe closure) to bind ATP productively (13Hubbard S.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). In additi"
https://openalex.org/W1990788833,"Cells must increase their mass in coordination with cell cycle progression to ensure that their size and macromolecular composition remain constant for any given proliferation rate. To this end, growth factors activate early signaling cascades that simultaneously promote cell mass increase and induce cell cycle entry. Nonetheless, the mechanism that controls the concerted regulation of cell growth and cell cycle entry in mammals remains unknown. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B pathway regulates cell cycle entry by inactivating forkhead transcription factors and promoting cyclin D synthesis. PI3K/protein kinase B-derived signals also affect activation of p70 S6 kinase and the mammalian target of rapamycin, enzymes involved in cell growth control. We previously showed that enhancement of PI3K activation accelerates cell cycle entry, whereas reduction of PI3K activation retarded this process. Here we examined whether expression of different PI3K mutants affects cell growth during cell division. We show that diminishing or enhancing the magnitude of PI3K activation in a transient manner reduces or increases, respectively, the protein synthesis rate. Alteration of cell growth and cell cycle entry by PI3K forms appears to be concerted, because it results in lengthening or shortening of cell division time without altering cell size. In support of a central role for PI3K in growth control, expression of a deregulated, constitutive active PI3K mutant affects p70 S6 kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin activities and increases cell size. Together, the results show that transient PI3K activation regulates cell growth and cell cycle in a coordinated manner, which in turn controls cell division time. Cells must increase their mass in coordination with cell cycle progression to ensure that their size and macromolecular composition remain constant for any given proliferation rate.

We previously showed that enhancement of PI3K activation accelerates cell cycle entry, whereas reduction of PI3K activation retarded this process. Here we examined whether expression of different PI3K mutants affects cell growth during cell division. We show that diminishing or enhancing the magnitude of PI3K activation in a transient manner reduces or increases, respectively, the protein synthesis rate. Alteration of cell growth and cell cycle entry by PI3K forms appears to be concerted, because it results in lengthening or shortening of cell division time without altering cell size. In support of a central role for PI3K in growth control, expression of a deregulated, constitutive active PI3K mutant affects p70 S6 kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin activities and increases cell size. Together, the results show that transient PI3K activation regulates cell growth and cell cycle in a coordinated manner, which in turn controls cell division time. Cell division is the process by which a cell duplicates its DNA content and cell mass to produce two daughter cells. In mammals, cell division is essential during development and in the adult for tissue regeneration. Most cell division is a symmetrical process that gives rise to two virtually identical daughter cells (1Polymenis M. Schmidt E.V. Curr. Opin. Genet.

To initiate symmetrical cell division, mitogens trigger a number of early signals that culminate in the activation of G1 cyclin/CDKs (required for the G1-S transition) and induce an increase in cell mass. This increase is required to ensure that macromolecular composition and cell size are conserved in daughter cells (1Polymenis M. Schmidt E.V. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Signaling pathways that control the cell mass increase, referred to as cell growth, have recently been elucidated and include proteins such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), 1The abbreviations used are: PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PKB, protein kinase B; mTOR, mammalian target of rapamycin; p70 S6K, p70 S6 kinase; TSC, tuberous sclerosis complex; 4EBP1, initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; GFP, green fluorescence protein; CS, calf serum; TOP, terminal oligopyrimidine tract. p70 S6 kinase (p70 S6K), the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC1/2) (4Tapon N.

Dev. 2002; 12: 565-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These proteins regulate synthesis of ribosomal components and activation of the translational machinery (4Tapon N. Moberg K.H.

It is nonetheless unknown how the two independent processes of cell cycle entry and cell growth are coordinated during cell division, particularly in mammals. Studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae show that whereas blockage of cell division by inactivation of most cell division cycle (cdc) genes allows cell growth to continue, inhibition of cell growth impairs cell cycle progression (6Johnston G.C. Pringle J.R. Hartwell L.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1977; 105: 79-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). The cell cycle thus appears to be linked to cell growth.

The PI3Ks are divided into three subclasses based on their primary structure and substrate specificity, but only class I enzymes generate phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate products in vivo. Basal levels of these lipids are very low in quiescent cells but increase rapidly and transiently following growth factor receptor stimulation, regulating a variety of cell responses including survival and division (11Vanhaesebroeck B.

Nonetheless, subsequent inactivation of PI3K is also important for completion of the cell cycle, because expression of constitutive active PI3K mutants inhibits forkhead activity in G2, which is required for mitotic progression (27Alvarez B.

S6 phosphorylation facilitates recruitment of a specific mRNA subset containing a polypyrimidine tract at the 5′ transcriptional start site (5′ TOP) to translating polysomes. 5′ TOP transcripts include those encoding ribosomal proteins (S3, S6, S14, and S24) and translation elongation factors (eEF1A and eEF2) (44Pullen N.

In addition to the biochemical studies mentioned, genetic experiments in Drosophila support PI3K/PKB, p70 S6K, and mTOR involvement in cell growth control (7Stocker H. Hafen E. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Nonetheless, despite the well demonstrated function of PI3K/PKB, p70 S6K, and mTOR in cell growth control, little is known of how cell growth induction is linked to cell cycle progression. Based on the capacity of PI3K to regulate pathways that control cell growth and cell cycle entry, we hypothesized that PI3K activation may contribute to the concerted regulation of these processes during cell division in mammals. We previously described the consequences on cell cycle progression of interfering with physiological PI3K regulation in NIH 3T3 cells by expressing different p85/p110 PI3K forms (27Alvarez B. Martinez A.C. Burgering B.M. Carrera A.C. Nature. 2001; 413: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). These studies indicated that enhancement of PI3K activation in a transient manner accelerates cell cycle progression, whereas reduction of PI3K activation decreases this process (27Alvarez B. Martinez A.C. Burgering B.M. Carrera A.C. Nature. 2001; 413: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Here we show that expression of p65PI3K, a mutant that enhances transient PI3K activation, augmented the protein synthesis rate of cycling cells. This increase was concerted with the cell cycle progression rate, because p65PI3K expression shortened division time without altering cell size. Accordingly, expression of the recombinant p85α regulatory subunit, which reduces the magnitude of transient PI3K activation, increased cell division time without altering cell size. These observations illustrate the concerted regulation of cell growth and cell cycle progression rates by PI3K, thereby controlling cell division time. The key role of PI3K in growth control is supported by the observation that expression of a deregulated, constitutive active PI3K form altered p70 S6K and mTOR activation kinetics, giving rise to larger cells. cDNA Constructs, Antibodies, and Materials—pcDNA3-TSC1 and pcDNA3-TSC2 cDNA and anti-TSC2 antibodies were kindly provided by Mark Nellist (54van Slegtenhorst M.

We have identified a gene, TbNBT1, from Trypanosoma brucei brucei that encodes a 435-residue protein of the equilibrative nucleoside transporter superfamily. The gene was expressed in both the procyclic and bloodstream forms of the organism. Expression of TbNBT1 in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain lacking an endogenous purine transporter allowed growth on adenine as sole purine source and introduced a high affinity transport activity for adenine and hypoxanthine, with Km values of 2.1 ± 0.6 and 0.66 ± 0.22 μm, respectively, as well as high affinity for xanthine, guanine, guanosine, and allopurinol and moderate affinity for inosine.

In the last few years, major progress has been made in the identification of the genes encoding nucleoside and nucleobase transporters. In particular, nucleoside transporters from a large number of species, ranging from bacteria to humans, have been cloned and characterized (1Hyde R.J. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Mol. Membr.

Kaminsky R. Science. 1999; 285: 242-244Google Scholar) is exceptional in that it has a high affinity for adenine (Km = 0.38 μm), slightly higher than for adenosine (0.59 μm) (9Carter N.S. Fairlamb A.H. Nature. 1993; 361: 173-175Google Scholar). However, transport of adenine by TbAT1 has not been demonstrated.Nucleobase-selective transport activities have also been identified in many species, but sequence information for the encoding genes is available only for bacteria, yeast, fungi, and the plant Arabidopsis thaliana (10De Koning H.P. Diallinas G. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2000; 75: 75-94Google Scholar). On the basis of gene alignments and identifiable motifs, three families of nucleobase transporters have been identified to date: nucleobase-ascorbate transporters, purine-related transporters, and Arabidopsis purine permeases (10De Koning H.P. Diallinas G. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2000; 75: 75-94Google Scholar). The only mammalian members in these families are the human and rat ascorbate transporters (11Tsukaguchi H. Tokui T. Mackenzie B.

Jarvis S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 245-258Google Scholar, 26De Koning H.P. Jarvis S.M. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 853-858Google Scholar, 27De Koning H.P. Jarvis S.M. Eur. J.

Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 814-820Google Scholar) and Toxoplasma gondii (28De Koning H.P. Al-Salabi M.I. Cohen A.M Coombs G.H. Wastling J.M. Int. J. Parasitol. 2003; (in press)Google Scholar). However, the substantially completed T. brucei genome sequence reveals the existence of a considerable number of ENT family members. A locus with six similar genes (the TbNT family) has recently been described (23Sanchez M.A. Tryon R. Green J. Boor J. Landfear S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21499-21504Google Scholar), with members that encode purine nucleoside transporters. One member of this family (TbNT5) transports the nucleobase hypoxanthine with a Km of ∼50 μm, in addition to transport of the nucleosides adenosine and inosine with high affinity (Km <5 μm).Here, we report the identification and cloning of a novel member of the ENT gene family, with substantial homology to both the TbNT family and TbAT1. This transporter was expressed in a nucleobase transporter-deficient yeast mutant (29Gillissen B. Bürkle L. André B. Kühn C. Rentsch D. Brandl B. Frommer W.F. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 291-300Google Scholar) to screen for any nucleoside or nucleobase transport activity. By this approach, we identified a high affinity nucleobase transporter, TbNBT1, which has identical substrate specificity to a high affinity nucleobase transport activity that we have characterized in parallel in T. brucei. We thus propose that the multiple ENT family members that are encoded by trypanosomes are responsible for high affinity transport of both nucleosides and nucleobases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of TbNBT1—An ENT homologue was identified from TBLASTN searches of Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute T. brucei sequence data bases (www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/T_brucei/). Multiple overlapping GSS sequences were identified and assembled using ContigExpress (VectorNTI Suite, Informax) to generate an open reading frame (ORF) that encoded a putative protein with ∼30% amino acid identity to TbAT1 or to the TbNT family. Oligonucleotide primers, designed from regions flanking the ORF, were employed in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the proofreading DNA polymerase Pfu to amplify a DNA fragment of the expected size from T. brucei 927 gDNA. Products from two independent PCR reactions were cloned into the PCR cloning vector pGEMTeasy (Promega) and completely sequenced on both strands (MBSU sequencing service, Glasgow, Scotland, UK).Southern and Northern Blotting—Performed by standard techniques, using the complete TbNBT1 ORF as probe.RNA Interference (RNAi)—A fragment (∼600 bp) of the TbNBT1 ORF was amplified by PCR and cloned into the BamHI and HindIII restriction sites of the double-stranded RNAi vector p2T7 (30LaCount D.J. Bruse S. Hill K.L. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 67-76Google Scholar). The resulting construct, p2T7TbNBT1, was integrated into T. brucei procyclic strain 29–13, as described previously (30LaCount D.J. Bruse S. Hill K.L. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 67-76Google Scholar). Double-stranded RNAi transcription was induced by growth of stable transfectants in media with 1 μg/ml tetracycline. The phenotype of induced and uninduced cells was compared by Northern blot and assayed for [3H]hypoxanthine transport.Expression in Yeast—The complete TbNBT1 ORF was excised from pGEMTeasy using NotI and subcloned into the NotI site of the yeast expression vector pDR195 (31Rentsch D. Laloi M. Rouhara I. Schmeltzer E. Delrot S. Frommer W.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 264-268Google Scholar). A uracil auxotrophic fcy2 mutant MG887-1 (29Gillissen B. Bürkle L. André B. Kühn C. Rentsch D. Brandl B. Frommer W.F. Plant Cell. 2000; 12: 291-300Google Scholar) was transformed with the resultant construct (TbNBT1: pDR195) and selected on uracil-free medium. Transformed yeast were plated onto yeast nitrogen base without ammonium salts and amino acids, supplemented with 4 mm hypoxanthine as the sole nitrogen source.Nucleobase and Nucleoside Transport Assays—Transport assays for trypanosomes were performed as described previously (32Wallace L.J.M. Candlish D. De Koning H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26149-26156Google Scholar). Yeast were grown at 30 °C in complete minimal medium lacking uracil, to a density of 1–2 OD units at 600 nm. Yeast transport assays were performed as described for T. brucei transport assays.Expression in Xenopus Oocytes and Transport Assays—The complete TbNBT1 ORF was excised from pGEMTeasy as a EcoRI fragment and subcloned into the corresponding sites of the Xenopus expression vector pGEMHE (33Liman E.R. Tytgat J. Hess P. Neuron. 1992; 9: 861-871Google Scholar). The resulting constructs were linearized by digestion with NheI and then transcribed with T7 polymerase in the presence of m7GpppG cap using the mMESSAGE MACHINE™ (Ambion) transcription system. Preparation of Xenopus laevis oocytes, injection (with 10-ng samples of RNA transcripts or with water alone), subsequent incubations and assays of the transport of radiolabeled nucleosides and nucleobases were essentially as described by Huang et al. (34Huang Q.Q. Harvey C.M. Paterson A.R. Cass C.E. Young J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20613-20619Google Scholar). Transport assays were performed at 20 °C over a period of 30 min using a permeant concentration of 100 μm, and each transport value shown represents the mean ± S.E. of 10–12 oocytes.RESULTSTbNBT1 Sequence and Homology—ENT family members were identified by searches of the T. brucei genome data base with the amino acid sequence of the characterized TbAT1 adenosine transporter (8Mäser P. Sutterlin C. Kralli A. Kaminsky R. Science. 1999; 285: 242-244Google Scholar). In addition to the recently described TbNT family (22Sanchez M.A. Ullman B. Landfear S.M. Carter N.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30244-30249Google Scholar, 23Sanchez M.A. Tryon R. Green J. Boor J. Landfear S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21499-21504Google Scholar), encoding six closely related ENT homologues, a number of other ENT family members were identified in the incomplete genome data base. An open reading frame (Fig. 1) with 32% identity and 52% similarity to TbAT1 was selected for functional characterization and was cloned by PCR amplification from T. brucei 927 and 427 genomic DNA. DNA sequencing confirmed that the cloned ORFs were identical and encoded an ENT homologue. Hydropathy profile analysis suggested a protein with 11 putative hydrophobic membrane-spanning α helices, consistent with a membrane transport function. Based on functional characterization (see below) this open reading frame was designated T. bruceinucleobase transporter 1 (TbNBT1)Gene Arrangement and Developmental Expression—Three almost identical homologues of TbNBT1 are described in the incomplete T. brucei genome project. TbNBT1 is most similar to a single predicted ORF that is assigned to chromosome 10 and that differs from TbNBT1 at two amino acids. Two other ORFs, both encoding putative ENT family members that are greater than 95% identical to TbNBT1, are assigned to chromosome 11. One of these ORFs has been submitted to GenBank™ by other workers (TbNT8.1, GenBank™ accession number AF516605). 2Submitted to GenBank™ by C. Henriques, M. A. Sanchez, R. Tryon, and S. M. Landfear as a Trypanosoma brucei nucleobase/nucleoside transporter. However, the incomplete sequence information for both these regions does not preclude the possibility that other related ORFs are encoded at these loci, and indeed, arrays of tandemly repeated ORFs are common in the trypanosome genome. To investigate the possibility that TbNBT1 is a member of a multigene family, Southern blots of T. brucei 927 genomic DNA were hybridized with the TbNBT1 open reading frame (Fig. 2A). High stringency hybridization conditions revealed three bands in several restriction digests, a pattern that is consistent with two or more similar genes. However, partial restriction digests did not indicate the presence of an extensive tandem repeat. Southern blot data did not support the possibility that TbNBT1 homologues are encoded on separate chromosomes, although Southern blots hybridized with TbNBT1 under lower stringency conditions (not shown) revealed additional bands that may represent more divergent ENT family members. Northern blotting of total RNA isolated from procyclic and bloodstream form trypanosomes revealed a single transcript at ∼2.5 kb and indicated that similar levels of TbNBT1 mRNA accumulate in these stages (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2High stringency hybridization with TbNBT1 ORF. Genomic DNA of T. b. brucei strain 927, digested with the indicated restriction enzymes (A), total T. b. brucei strain 427 RNA (B), or total RNA from T. b. brucei strain 29–13, transformed with p2T7TbNBT1 (C), was isolated and hybridized with the TbNT1 ORF.

However, MG887-1 expressing TbNBT1:pDR195 acquired the ability to accumulate these purines (Fig. 3). In particular, [3H]adenine and [3H]hypoxanthine were accumulated rapidly and in a saturable manner, as transport in the presence of 1 mm unlabeled permeant was not significantly different from zero (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, transport of [3H]inosine and [3H]adenosine was not fully inhibited by 1 mm or even 2.5 mm unlabeled permeant (Fig. 3, C and D), indicating that the affinity of TbNBT1 for nucleosides was considerably less than for nucleobases. The transport in the presence of unlabeled nucleoside could not be explained by diffusion or endogenous transport of the yeast, since no uptake of nucleosides was observed in transformants with empty vector pDR195.Fig. 3Transport of [3H]purines by TbNBT1 in S. cerevisiae strain MG887-1. Transport of [3H]permeant by transformants with TbNBT1:pDR195 was monitored in the presence (▪) or absence (□) of unlabeled permeant. Transport by control transformants with pDR195 was similarly measured in the presence (•) or absence (○) of unlabeled permeant. A, 0.1 μm [3H]adenine ± 1mm adenine.

As expected from the results in Fig. 3, C and D, inosine and, particularly, adenosine displayed much lower affinity (Table I). Even the surprisingly high affinity for guanosine is some 4-fold lower than for the corresponding nucleobase, guanine. A similar trend of relatively high affinity for guanosine on a purine nucleobase transporter was earlier reported for the T. b. brucei H2 (25De Koning H.P. Jarvis S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 245-258Google Scholar) and Leishmania major LmNBT1 (21Al-Salabi M.I. Wallace L.J.M. De Koning H.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 814-820Google Scholar) carriers. This may be related to the formation of an internal hydrogen bond between the two-amine group on the purine ring and the 5′-hydroxyl group of the ribose moiety, stabilizing the molecule in a favorable configuration (21Al-Salabi M.I. Wallace L.J.M. De Koning H.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 814-820Google Scholar).Fig. 4Transport of [3H]hypoxanthine by S. cerevisiae strain MG887-1 transformed with TbNBT1:pDR195.

Open table in a new tab Expression of TbNBT1 in Xenopus Oocytes—To further validate the results of heterologous expression in yeast, we also performed a limited expression study in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Four groups of oocytes were injected in parallel with either water or cRNA encoding TbNBT1 or the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter hENT1 (35Griffiths M. Beaumont N. Yao S.Y.M. Sundaram M. Boumah C.E. Davies A. Kwong F.Y.P. Coe I. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 89-93Google Scholar). Consistent with previously reported findings (4Ward J.L. Sherali A. Mo Z.-P. Tse C.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8375-8381Google Scholar, 35Griffiths M. Beaumont N. Yao S.Y.M. Sundaram M. Boumah C.E. Davies A. Kwong F.Y.P. Coe I. Cass C.E. Young J.D. Baldwin S.A. Nat.

Transport of [3H]uridine, [3H]adenosine, [3H]adenine, and [3H]uracil by RNA transcript-injected oocytes was measured at pH 7.5, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Oocytes were injected with RNA transcripts encoding TbNBT1 (dotted bars) or hENT1 (filled bars). Transport is expressed as a percentage of the rates of uptake in control oocytes injected with water alone, which were 1.2 ± 0.1 (uridine), 3.7 ± 0.9 (adenosine), 14.5 ± 2.4 (adenine), and 5.7 ± 0.2 (uracil) pmol(oocyte)–1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Oocytes expressing TbNBT1 rapidly accumulated [3H]adenine and, to a lesser extent, [3H]uracil, but no significant mediated transport of [3H]adenosine or [3H]uridine was observed at pH 7.5 (Fig. 5). However, at pH 6.0, the rate of uptake of adenosine in oocytes injected with TbNBT1 transcripts was significantly (3.4-fold) greater than in water-injected control oocytes (p < 0.01; data not shown), possibly indicating a more efficient transport as a result of the increased proton gradient over the oocyte plasma membrane.Characterization of Two Hypoxanthine Transporters in Procyclic T. b. brucei—Transport assays using very low concentrations of [3H]hypoxanthine revealed the presence of two distinct hypoxanthine transporters in T. b. brucei procyclic cells (Fig. 6). A previously reported lower affinity transporter, H1 (27De Koning H.P. Jarvis S.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1102-1110Google Scholar), was observed alongside a higher affinity hypoxanthine transport activity, which we designated H4. In the current set of experiments, conducted at 30 nm [3H]hypoxanthine, H1 and H4 activities were separated by fitting inhibition plots to an equation for two-site competition and to Eadie-Hofstee plots, which produced kinetic constants in good in agreement with each other. Under these conditions, the kinetic constants for H1 were very similar to those previously reported (27De Koning H.P. Jarvis S.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1102-1110Google Scholar) (Km = 15.2 ± 2.3 μm; Vmax = 2.4 ± 0.7 pmol(107 cells)–1 s–1 (n = 7)). Although the H4 transporter has a lower Vmax (0.27 ± 0.08 pmol (107 cells)–1 s–1 (n = 7)), it was generally responsible for >85% of [3H]hypoxanthine transport at 30 nm of label, due to its much higher affinity for hypoxanthine (Km = 0.55 ± 0.07 μm (n = 7)). The presence of the two transporters was further illustrated with the aid of selective inhibitors of H4. Uracil and guanosine do not inhibit H1-mediated [3H]hypoxanthine transport up to 1 mm (27De Koning H.P. Jarvis S.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1102-1110Google Scholar), but dose-dependently inhibited H4 activity (Fig. 6). However, affinities for adenine, guanine, xanthine, and allopurinol were similar for H1 and H4 (Table I and Ref. 27De Koning H.P. Jarvis S.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 247: 1102-1110Google Scholar). The Km value of H4 was also significantly higher than previously reported for the T. b. brucei H2 transporter characterized in bloodstream forms (25De Koning H.P. Jarvis S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 245-258Google Scholar) (0.55 ± 0.07 μmversus 0.12 ± 0.01 μm; p < 0.01, unpaired Student's t test). In addition, affinity for guanine was lower and for inosine higher for H4 than for H2 (p < 0.05). Most significantly, however, substitutions of N3 or N7 in guanine for CH (3-deaza- and 7-deazaguanine) have been shown to reduce affinity for H2 28- and 150-fold, respectively (32Wallace L.J.M. Candlish D. De Koning H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26149-26156Google Scholar), but had little or no effect on affinity for H4 (Table I). These results establish that H4 is a previously unknown transporter, distinct from either H1 and H2, and indeed from H3, which is a relatively low affinity hypoxanthine transporter in T. b. brucei bloodstream forms (25De Koning H.P. Jarvis S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 89: 245-258Google Scholar).Fig. 6Hypoxanthine transport in T. b. brucei procyclics. Procyclic cells of strain 427 were exposed to 30 nm [3H]hypoxanthine for 30 s, in the presence or absence of various concentrations of unlabeled hypoxanthine (▪), uracil (•), or guanosine (□). Only the plot with hypoxanthine fitted a two-component inhibition model significantly better than a model for a single transporter (p = 0.02, F test). Inset shows the data with unlabeled hypoxanthine converted to an Eadie-Hofstee plot, showing two transporter activities with Km values of 0.64 and 18.8 μm, respectively, and Vmax values of 0.22 and 2.7 pmol(107 cells)–1 s–1, respectively. v, rate of [3H]hypoxanthine transport; [s], permeant concentration.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Table I also shows the kinetic parameters for TbNBT1, determined by expression in S. cerevisiae, alongside those for the H4 transporter in procyclics. For none of the inhibitors was a significant difference in Ki or Km value observed (p > 0.05), providing strong evidence that the NBT1 gene encodes the H4 transporter activity. It also validates the S. cerevisiae expression system used in our study as appropriate for this protozoan transporter, producing accurate and reproducible results.Further evidence that TbNBT1 encodes the H4 transport activity derives from experiments with RNAi. T. b. brucei procyclics were transformed with the vector p2T7 (30LaCount D.J. Bruse S. Hill K.L. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 67-76Google Scholar), containing a 0.6-kb fragment of the TbNBT1 ORF under the control of the tetracycline-inducible promotor. Northern blots revealed that TbNBT1 mRNA levels in these cells were ∼80% reduced after 5 days incubation with 1 μg/ml tetracycline (Fig. 2C). Incubation with tetracycline also greatly reduced the transport rate of the high affinity hypoxanthine transporter, and while the Km did not significantly differ between tetracycline exposed and control cells (0.24 ± 0.06 versus 0.17 ± 0.04 μm), the Vmax was reduced from 3.2 ± 0.2 to 0.20 ± 0.04 pmol (107 cells)–1 s–1 (Fig. 7).Fig. 7Effect of TbNBT1 RNAi on H4 transport activity. Expression of a double-stranded RNAi fragment of TbNBT1 in T. b. brucei procyclics was induced by tetracycline. Transport of 0.1 μm [3H]hypoxanthine in the induced (○) and uninduced control (▪) cells was measured over 30 s in the presence of 0–1000 μm of unlabeled hypoxanthine. Inset shows the conversion to a Michaelis-Menten plot. Km and Vmax values were 0.34 ± 0.14 μm and 0.090 ± 0.011 pmol(107 cells)–1 s–1 for the induced cells and 0.25 ± 0.07 μm and 1.07 ± 0.08 pmol(107 cells)–1 s–1 for the uninduced control cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT"
https://openalex.org/W2120023357,"Tryparedoxin (TryX) is a member of the thioredoxin (TrX) fold family involved in the regulation of oxidative stress in parasitic trypanosomatids. Like TrX, TryX carries a characteristic Trp-Cys-Xaa-Xaa-Cys motif, which positions a redox-active disulfide underneath a tryptophan lid. We report the structure of a Crithidia fasciculata tryparedoxin isoform (CfTryX2) in two crystal forms and compare them with structures determined previously. Efforts to chemically generate crystals of reduced TryX1 were unsuccessful, and we carried out a novel experiment to break the redox-active disulfide, formed between Cys-40 and Cys-43, utilizing the intense x-radiation from a third generation synchrotron undulator beamline. A time course study of the S–S bond cleavage is reported with the structure of a TryX1 C43A mutant as the control. When freed from the constraints of a disulfide link to Cys-43, Cys-40 pivots to become slightly more solvent-accessible. In addition, we have determined the structure of Trypanosoma brucei TryX, which, influenced by the molecular packing in the crystal lattice, displays a significantly different orientation of the active site tryptophan lid. This structural change may be of functional significance when TryX interacts with tryparedoxin peroxidase, the final protein in the trypanothione-dependent peroxidase pathway. Comparisons with chloroplast TrX and its substrate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate phosphatase suggest that this movement may represent a general feature of redox regulation in the trypanothione and thioredoxin peroxidase pathways.

The principal biological function of TryX is to regulate oxidative stress as a component of the trypanothione peroxidase pathway (Fig. 1). This pathway, unique to trypanosomatids, starts with the NADPH-dependent trypanothione reductase (TryR) (1Fairlamb A.H. Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 695-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar), which maintains high levels of the polyamine-peptide conjugate trypanothione (N 1, N 8-bis(glutathionyl)spermidine) in the reduced form (T[SH]2), which in turn is able to reduce TryX (2Alphey M.S. Bond C.S. Tetaud E. Fairlamb A.H. Hunter W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 300: 903-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 3Hofmann B. Hecht H.-J. Flohé L. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). The reduced TryX interacts with and passes on a reducing equivalent to tryparedoxin peroxidase (TryP), allowing it to catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide and organic hydroperoxides to water or alcohols, respectively. A feature of the trypanothione peroxidase pathway is that the shuttling of reducing power from TryR through to TryP utilizes the redox properties of disulfide linkages (4Raina S. Missiakas D. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1997; 51: 179-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) in the enzymes and their peptide substrates. The first crystal structure of tryparedoxin, the protein from Crithidia fasciculata (CfTryX1), revealed a compact globular molecule classed in the same fold family as the functional homologue thioredoxin (TrX, see Fig. 2a) (5Alphey M.S.

The TrX fold is based on a twisted five-stranded central β-sheet with two helices on either side (6Katti S.K. LeMaster D.M. Eklund H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 212: 167-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 7Holmgren A. Bjornstedt M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 252: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), but although classed in the same family, TryX is distinct from TrX in several respects (5Alphey M.S. Leonard G.A. Gourley D.G. Tetaud E. Fairlamb A.H. Hunter W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25613-25622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The parasite protein is significantly larger, ∼16 kDa as compared with 12 kDa for TrX, and carries additional elements of secondary structure, in particular a β-hairpin at the N terminus. The relationship of secondary structure with the amino acid sequence is so different for TryX and TrX that it is meaningless to compare the overall sequences. A noteworthy similarity is, however, the presence of a redox-active disulfide at the N terminus of an α-helix. In TrX, this disulfide is contained in the motif Trp-Cys-Gly/Ala-Pro-Cys, whereas in TryX, the motif is Trp-Cys-Pro-Pro-Cys. A least-squares fit of the central β-strands of TrX and TryX align these motifs on top of each other (5Alphey M.S. Leonard G.A. Gourley D.G. Tetaud E. Fairlamb A.H. Hunter W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25613-25622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In CfTryX1, the vicinal cysteine residues (Cys-40 and Cys-43) form a right-handed redox-active disulfide near the surface of the molecule, positioned beneath an overhanging Trp-39. Chemical modification and mass spectrometry studies indicate that the amino-proximal Cys-40 is the more reactive of the two cysteines (8Gommel D.U. Nogoceke E. Morr M. Kiess M. Kalisz H.M. Flohe L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Cys-40 is more solvent-accessible than the partner Cys-43 and actually forms a hydrogen bond with a water molecule (5Alphey M.S. Leonard G.A. Gourley D.G. Tetaud E. Fairlamb A.H. Hunter W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25613-25622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the position of which suggests where T[SH]2 or TryP bind when reacting with CfTryX1. We now report structures for a second isoform of C. fasciculata TryX (CfTryX2) and provide brief comparisons with CfTryX1 and structures of the disulfide form and chemically reduced CfTryX2 recently published (9Hofmann B. Budde H. Bruns K. Guerrero S.A. Kalisz H.M. Menge U. Montemartini M. Nogoceke E. Steinert P. Wissing J.B. Flohé L. Hecht H.-J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Unable to crystallize TryX as a homogeneous free dithiol form, we sought to generate this structure by photoreduction of the redox-active disulfide of CfTryX1 using the intense x-ray beam available from an undulator beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). As a control for this novel experiment and to study the effect of removing the disulfide linkage, Cys-43 was mutated to alanine, and the structure (CfTryX-C43A) was determined to 1.30-Å resolution. We also determined the structure of Trypanosoma brucei tryparedoxin (TbTryX) at 2.3-Å resolution, which presents an active site significantly different from any other TryX structure. Analysis of the interactions between TbTryX and a symmetry-related molecule suggests structural alterations that may be relevant to the interaction between TryX and the partner peroxidase, TryP. Based on crystal structures of a chloroplast TrX (10Capitani G. Markovic-Housley Z. DelVal G. Morris M. Jansonius J.N. Schurmann P. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 302: 135-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), one of its redox partners, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate phosphatase (11Chiadmi M. Navaza J. Miginiac-Maslow M. Jacquot J.-P. Cherfils J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6809-6815Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), and our own sequence analyses, we propose that the conformational lability of the tryptophan lid may contribute to specific redox events. Cloning, Expression, and Purification of Recombinant Tryparedoxins—The gene coding for CfTryX2 was obtained by PCR amplification of genomic DNA of the C. fasciculata HS6 TryXII open reading frame (GenBank™ accession number: AF055986) using the oligonucleotides 5′-CAT CAT ATG TAT CAC ACC CTT CTC TAC-3′ for the sense strand and 5′-CAT GGA TCC TTA CTT CTT GGC CTC CAC GTT GGG-3′ for the antisense strand. The sense strand oligonucleotide contains an NdeI cloning site (underlined) incorporating an initiation codon (bold), whereas the antisense oligonucleotide contains a BamHI restriction site (underlined) downstream of the antisense stop codon (bold). The PCR products were blunt-end ligated into the SmaI site of pUC18 (Sure-Clone, Amersham Biosciences), and then the inserts were excised by restriction enzyme digest and ligated into the pET-15b vector (Novagen), creating plasmids pET-TbTryX and pET-CfTryXII. The mutagenesis of cysteine to alanine at residue 43 in C. fasciculata tryparedoxin-I (CfTryX-C43A) was performed using the method described by Deng and Nickoloff (12Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar) with the Chameleon kit (Stratagene). The plasmid pET-CfTryX1 (13Alphey M.S. Tetaud E. Gourley D.G. Fairlamb A.H. Hunter W.N. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 126: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) provided the matrix, and the oligonucleotide was 5′-TGG TGC CCG CCG GCC CGC GGC TTC ACG-3′. The gene coding for TbTryX was obtained by PCR amplification of genomic DNA of the T. brucei 427 TryX open reading frame (GenBank™ accession number: AJ006403) using the oligonucleotides 5′-TTG CAT ATG TCT GGC CTC GCC AAG TAT-3′ for the sense strand and 5′-CAT CAT ATG TCA GTT GGG CCA CGG AAA GTT GGC-3′ for the antisense strand. The sense strand oligonucleotide carried an NdeI cloning site (underlined) incorporating an initiation codon (bold), whereas the antisense strand oligonucleotide carried an NdeI restriction site (underlined) just downstream of the antisense stop codon (bold). The integrity of the cloned genes was confirmed by sequencing. All recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). Expression and purification protocols followed those published by Alphey et al. (13Alphey M.S. Tetaud E. Gourley D.G. Fairlamb A.H. Hunter W.N. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 126: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and involved the use of metal ion affinity chromatography to exploit the presence of the N-terminal histidine tag, which was introduced by using the pET-15b vector and which was subsequently removed by cleavage with thrombin (Amersham Biosciences). Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm using a theoretical extinction coefficient of 38030 m–1 cm–1 (14Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar), and purity was evaluated using SDS-PAGE and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Data Processing—Crystals were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion setup, and diffraction data were processed, reduced, and scaled using the HKL (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38243) Google Scholar) and CCP4 suite of programs (see Table I) (16Collaborative Computational Project Number 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19665) Google Scholar). Crystals of CfTryX1 and CfTryX-C43A were obtained using the published conditions (13Alphey M.S. Tetaud E. Gourley D.G. Fairlamb A.H. Hunter W.N. J. Struct. Biol. 1999; 126: 76-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Two tetragonal crystal forms (A and B) of CfTryX2 were obtained. Form A presented as rods and appeared in drops containing ∼10 mg ml–1 protein, 15% w/v polyethylene glycol 8000, 30 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 60 mm ammonium sulfate. These crystals display space group P42212 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 111.7, c = 56.5 Å and are isomorphous to samples studied by Hofmann et al. (9Hofmann B. Budde H. Bruns K. Guerrero S.A. Kalisz H.M. Menge U. Montemartini M. Nogoceke E. Steinert P. Wissing J.B. Flohé L. Hecht H.-J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Form B crystals displayed a bipyramidal morphology and grew from solutions of ∼10 mg ml–1 protein, 500 mm sodium citrate, 30 mm sodium HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm dithiothreitol. They are in space group P41212 with unit cell dimensions of a = b = 114.3, c = 102.0 Å. Single crystals of both forms were cryo-protected by soaking in crystallization mother liquor containing either 15% (form A) or 10% (form B) of glycerol prior to transfer in a nitrogen gas stream at –170 °C. A single crystal of form A was used on the ESRF bending magnet beamline BM14, and data collection was carried out at λ = 0.977 Å to d min = 1.5 Å with an MarCCD133 detector in a single sweep totaling 90o of oscillation in 0.5o steps. For form B, a single crystal was mounted on the ESRF undulator beamline ID14-EH2, and data were collected at λ = 0.933 Å using an ADSC QUANTUM4 detector. Despite the relatively large size of the crystal used for data collection (∼250 × 150 × 150 μm3), diffraction maxima were only visible to ∼2.2-Å resolution, and these were only apparent after a relatively long exposure time of 45 s/0.5o oscillation. Radiation damage was evident after 75 images, and the crystal was translated such that a fresh section was exposed to the x-ray beam and a further 44 0.5o images were collected. Both batches of data were processed and scaled together yielding a data set complete to 2.35 Å.Table IData collection, refinement, and model geometry statistics Values in parentheses refer to the highest resolution bin.StructureTbTryXCfTryX2ACfTryX2BCfTryX-ACfTryX-BCfTryX-CCfTryX-C43AUpper resolution limit (Å)2.31.502.351.501.501.701.30No. of measurements/unique37965/4699469429/57687136117/28025167903/22718167593/22753116000/15786261452/35022Redundancy/completeness (%)8.1/98.7 (94.7)8.1/99.7 (95.5)4.9/97.5 (99.9)7.4/90.0 (46.7)7.4/94.5 (76.3)7.4/96.2 (93.6)7.5/96.6 (88.9)I/σ(I)19.6 (6.5)37.6 (2.1)29.8 (9.6)14.7 (1.2)16.8 (1.5)15.5 (1.4)18.6 (1.8)R merge (%)7.3 (21.7)4.5 (35.4)5.3 (24.9)5.2 (53.8)4.6 (39.5)6.1 (60.5)4.5 (43.9)Protein residues (total)144151aDenotes the two molecules per asymmetric unit./145aDenotes the two molecules per asymmetric unit.150aDenotes the two molecules per asymmetric unit./147aDenotes the two molecules per asymmetric unit.143143143143Water molecules/sulphates63/0312/113313312661210R-work/R-free (%)19.9/24.720.7/23.519.6/21.320.4/26.320.3/26.621.0/27.617.8/22.8Average isotropic thermal parameters (Å2)Wilson B-value37.519.052.217.418.222.214.4Overall20.623.148.721.422.526.520.3Main chain/side chains20.1/21.018.944.119.2/21.620.0/22.724.7/28.316.4/19.6Water molecules22.134.150.430.532.427.732.7r.m.s.d.bRoot mean square deviation. bond lengths (Å)/bond angles (°)0.007/1.450.022/1.860.021/1.650.014/1.50.013/1.40.016/1.70.012/1.6Ramachandran analysis (%)Favored regions88.387.186.894.393.491.892.6Additionally, generously allowed regions11.712.513.25.76.68.27.4Disallowed regions00.400000Protein Data Bank accession code1O731OC81OC91O7U1O851O8W1O8Xa Denotes the two molecules per asymmetric unit.b Root mean square deviation. Open table in a new tab For the time course experiment on CfTryX1 and the analysis of CfTryX-C43A, crystals were cryo-protected with 40% polyethylene glycol monomethyl ether 2000 and then flash-cooled at –170 °C. Data were collected on ID14-EH2 (λ = 0.933 Å) using the STRATEGY program (17Ravelli R.B. Sweet R.M. Skinner J.M. Duisenberg A.J.M. Kroon J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1997; 30: 551-554Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) to determine the angular range for collection. For the time course experiment, a series of data sets were measured over the same oscillation range. Data sets A and B were consecutive and measured to a resolution of 1.5 Å. An intermediate exposure of 780 s, which corresponds to the total exposure time for measurement of a data set, was made while rotating the crystal, although no data were actually recorded. Data set C was then measured, and it was noted that the sample now only diffracted to 1.7-Å resolution. The radiation damage to the crystal after data set CfTryX-C was judged too great to warrant further useful data collection. The three data sets and the models derived from each are labeled CfTryX-A, -B, and -C, respectively. Clumps of small monoclinic plate-like crystals of TbTryX grew over a period of weeks in drops made by mixing a solution of 10 mg ml–1 protein, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, with the reservoir solution of 30% polyethylene glycol 4000, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 4.6, 200 mm ammonium acetate. The crystals display space group P21 with unit cell dimensions of a = 30.6, b = 31.5, c = 56.9 Å, b = 93.4°. The asymmetric unit comprises a monomer with ∼30% solvent content and V m of 1.8 Å3 Da–1. A small fragment (∼200 × 50 × 10 μm3) was removed from a clump of crystals and passed through a cryo-protectant consisting of reservoir solution adjusted to include 20% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, and then transferred into a stream of nitrogen gas at –170 °C. Data were measured to 2.3-Å resolution on a Rigaku rotating anode (copper Kα λ = 1.5418 Å)-Raxis IV image plate system. Structure Solution and Refinement—The initial phases for both CfTryX2 structures were obtained using the molecular replacement (MR) technique as implemented in the CNS software package (18Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16915) Google Scholar) with data in the resolution ranges 15–3 Å for form A and 20–4 Å for form B. The structure of CfTryX1 (Protein Data Bank code 1QK8) (5Alphey M.S. Leonard G.A. Gourley D.G. Tetaud E. Fairlamb A.H. Hunter W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25613-25622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) stripped of all solvent molecules was used as the search model. After this procedure, it was clear that both crystal forms contain two molecules/asymmetric unit, which results in calculated Matthews coefficients (V m) (19Matthews B.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 33: 491-497Crossref Scopus (7893) Google Scholar) of 2.3 and 4.4 Å3 Da–1 for forms A and B, respectively. The unit cell of form A has a much lower bulk solvent volume, 46%, than the 72% observed for form B, and this helps to explain the different diffraction limits of the two forms. For crystal form A, the initial MR phases obtained were extended to the resolution limit of the data set, 1.5 Å, using a combination of non-crystallographic symmetry averaging, solvent flattening, and histogram matching as implemented in the program DM (20Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACBM Newsletter on Protein Crystallography, 31. SERC Daresbury Laboratory, Warrington, United Kingdom1994: 34-38Google Scholar) after first calculating reliable σA-weighted figures-of-merit (FOM) (21Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2035) Google Scholar) for the MR phase set. The resulting electron density map (Fobs, αDM, FOMDM) was of excellent quality, and a model was constructed using the program ARP/wARP (22Perrakis A. Sixma T.K. Wilson K.S. Lamzin V.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Refinement was then carried out using CNS interspersed with rounds of rebuilding in QUANTA (Accelrys) during which solvent molecules were included. To complete the refinement, a final round was performed using the program REFMAC (23Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13710) Google Scholar) in which the two sulfur atoms in the active site were refined with anisotropic temperature factors. For crystal form B, a similar protocol to that described for form A was used to extend the MR phases to the diffraction limit of the data set. A model was built manually with QUANTA, and refinement carried out in a similar manner to that for form A. The CfTryX-A, -B, and -C structures are isomorphous with the disulfide form of CfTryX1 (5Alphey M.S. Leonard G.A. Gourley D.G. Tetaud E. Fairlamb A.H. Hunter W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25613-25622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which provided the starting model for refinements using REFMAC. Following rigid body refinement, additional rounds of positional and B-factor refinement combined with graphics fitting (O) (24Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (12999) Google Scholar) were carried out. Water molecules were added using ARP/wARP. Once the R-factor and R-free had dropped from about 40 to 25%, anisotropic B-factor refinement was introduced. The structure of TbTryX was solved by MR (AMoRe) (25Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5026) Google Scholar) using a poly-Ala structure of CfTryX1 as the search model. A clear solution was obtained that, after rigid body refinement, gave an R-factor of 48% and a correlation coefficient of 0.56 for data in the range of 30–2.3-Å resolution. Density modification (DM) improved the electron density map that was then used for model building. Simulated annealing molecular dynamics (to reduce model bias), least-squares refinement with CNS, together with the placement of water molecules completed the analysis. Approximately 5% of each data set was set aside to provide an R-free to monitor the progress of all refinements (26Brünger A.T. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 24-36Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas PROCHECK (27Laskowski R.A. MacArthur R.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) and OOPS (28Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 829-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) were used to assess model geometry. Further experimental details are provided (see Table I) and in the Protein Data Bank depositions. Overall Structures—The tryparedoxin structure is constructed around a seven-stranded twisted β-sheet with parallel and antiparallel alignments. This sheet starts with a β-hairpin formed by β1 and β2, and thereafter a β3-α1-β4-α2-β5 combination. A final β-hairpin between β6 and β7 completes the structure. The active site Trp-Cys-Pro-Pro-Cys motif is located between strand β3 and the N terminus of helix α1 (Fig. 2a). A structure-based sequence alignment of the three highly conserved tryparedoxins used in this study is shown in Fig. 2b. The Second Tryparedoxin Isoform of C. fasciculata (CfTryX2)—The structure of CfTryX2 was determined independently in two crystal forms, each of which presents two molecules/asymmetric unit. A pairwise least-squares superposition of all Cα atoms for the four molecules gave root mean square deviation values that ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 Å, and the results are similar whether we used a MR protocol or the anomalous dispersion from sulfur atoms (29Micossi E. Hunter W.N. Leonard G.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 21-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) to provide the initial phase information. When comparing our MR-derived structures with those of CfTryX2 determined by Hofmann et al. (9Hofmann B. Budde H. Bruns K. Guerrero S.A. Kalisz H.M. Menge U. Montemartini M. Nogoceke E. Steinert P. Wissing J.B. Flohé L. Hecht H.-J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), least-squares superposition values of between 0.2 and 0.6 Å were observed. These values indicate close agreement of the second isoform structures irrespective of how or where they were determined or the redox state of the protein (see below). The structures reported here confirm that, when compared with the structure of CfTryX1, the helices α1 and α2 are closer to each other in the structure of CfTryX2, allowing the formation of a hydrogen bonding network around the less solvent-exposed sulfur atom in the active site S–S bridge (9Hofmann B. Budde H. Bruns K. Guerrero S.A. Kalisz H.M. Menge U. Montemartini M. Nogoceke E. Steinert P. Wissing J.B. Flohé L. Hecht H.-J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 382: 459-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Both crystal forms of CfTryX2 were grown from solutions containing dithiothreitol. The electron and difference density maps were suggestive of a time and space average of S–S bridge oxidized and reduced states. The refined S–S distances are 2.9 and 2.8 Å for the two molecules in form A and 3.2 and 3.0 Å for the two molecules in form B. Radiation-induced Cleavage of the Redox-active Disulfide— The exposure of protein crystals to an intense x-ray source changes the properties of the sample (30Burmeister W.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 328-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 31Ravelli R.B. McSweeney S.M.

Ravelli R.B. J. Synchrotron. Rad. 2002; 9: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These changes, which include an increase in unit cell volume, a decreased resolution to which diffraction data can be observed, increased mosaicity, and an increased Wilson B-factor, are indicative of general radiation damage. It has also been noted that although atomic B-factor values increase for successive data sets, the change is not equally distributed for all atoms but rather occurs at glutamate, aspartate, and cysteine residues. In the latter case, it appears that disulfide breakage contributes significantly to this increase in B-factors. In general, only one cysteine in a disulfide actually moves during bond breakage, whereas its partner remains well fixed (31Ravelli R.B. McSweeney S.M. Structure. 2000; 8: 315-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Weik et al. (32Weik M. Ravelli R.B. Kryger G. McSweeney S. Raves M.L. Harel M. Gros P. Silman I. Kroon J. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), in a study of x-ray-induced damage to Torpedo californica acetyl-cholinesterase observed that active site residues are among the most radiation-sensitive of residues and suggested, in a similar fashion to disulfide bonds, that these groups constituted “weak links” in protein structures. Our study on CfTryX1 targeted a redox-active disulfide, which should constitute an even weaker link than a structural disulfide. This is indeed the case since the radiation dose required to break this S–S bond is much less than that reported for structural S–S links in lysozyme for example (31Ravelli R.B. McSweeney S.M. Structure. 2000; 8: 315-318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). During the time course experiment, from CfTryX-A to CfTryX-C (Table I), we noted general symptoms of radiation damage to the sample; resolution decreased, the B factors for consecutive data sets increased, the unit cell volumes increased from 136,800 to 136,930 to 137,340 Å3, and the mean fractional isomorphous differences also increased from 0.08 (A and B) to 0.12 (A and C). In the disulfide form of CfTryX1, the Cys-40–Cys-43 Sγ–Sγ distance is 2.2 Å. In CfTryX-A, the distance between the two Sγ atoms has increased to 2.5 Å. This is most likely due t"

We cloned the gene and produced the encoded protein in Escherichia coli cells. The isolated recombinant protein showed peroxidase activity in vitro and used the thioredoxin system of A. pernix as an electron donor. These results indicate that the recombinant protein is in fact thioredoxin peroxidase (ApTPx) of A. pernix. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the expression of ApTPx was induced as a cellular adaptation in response to the addition of exogenous H2O2 and may exert an antioxidant activity in vivo. An analysis of the ApTPx oligomers by high pressure liquid chromatography and electron microscopic studies showed that ApTPx exhibited the hexadecameric protein forming 2-fold toroid-shaped structure with outer and inner diameters of 14 and 6 nm, respectively. These results indicated that ApTPx is a novel hexadecameric protein composed of two identical octamers. Although oligomerization of individual subunits does not take place through an intersubunit-disulfide linkage involving Cys50 and Cys213, Cys50 is essential for the formation of the hexadecamer. Mutagenesis studies suggest that the sulfhydryl group of Cys50 is the site of oxidation by peroxide and that oxidized Cys50 reacts with the sulfhydryl group of Cys213 of another subunit to form an intermolecular disulfide bond. The resulting disulfide can then be reduced by thioredoxin. In support of this hypothesis, ApTPx mutants lacking either Cys50 or Cys213 showed no TPx activity, whereas the mutant lacking Cys207 had a TPx activity.

Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 215: 213-219Google Scholar, 2Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989: 299-415Google Scholar). Increased levels of ROS referred to as oxidative stress can lead to damage to all of the major classes of biological macromolecules including lipids, proteins, and DNA (2Halliwell B. Gutteridge J.M.C. Free Radicals in Biology and Medicine. 2nd Ed. Clarendon Press, Oxford1989: 299-415Google Scholar, 3Storz G. Christman M.F. Sies H. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8917-8921Google Scholar) in all aerobic organisms. Therefore, all aerobic organisms have evolved protection mechanisms against oxidative damage. As a result, most cells have developed anti-oxidative enzymes and also produce antioxidant molecules such as superoxide dismutases, catalases, peroxidases, thioredoxin, and glutathione to protect themselves against ROS. Peroxiredoxin (Prx) forms a large family of newly discovered antioxidant enzymes that act as peroxidases, which reduce hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides to water or the corresponding alcohol, respectively (4Schröder E. Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2465-2468Google Scholar). The family can be divided into two subgroups, 1-Cys and 2-Cys Prxs, based on the presence of one or two conserved cysteine residues. Recently, an atypical 2-Cys Prxs, which contains only the N-terminal conserved Cys and requires an additional Cys for their peroxidase activity, has been classified into the third group (5Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Chang T.S. Jeong W. Kim K. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 35-41Google Scholar). The 2-Cys Prxs contain a strictly conserved Cys residue in the N-terminal region, which forms the site of oxidation by peroxides, and an additional conserved Cys residue in the C-terminal region, which forms an intermolecular disulfide bond along with the N-terminal Cys residue of another subunit (6Ellis H.R. Poole L.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13349-13356Google Scholar, 7Schröder E. Littlechild J.A. Lebedev A.A. Errington N. Vagin A.A. Isupov M.N. Struc. Fold Des. 2000; 8: 605-615Google Scholar). The disulfide bond in 2-Cys Prxs is reduced by thioredoxin (Trx), and these are referred to as thioredoxin peroxidases (TPx). Oxidized Trx, in turn, is reduced by thioredoxin reductase (TR), a NADPH-dependent flavoenzyme. TPx that is able to reduce H2O2 using electrons provided by Trx was first reported in yeast (8Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Google Scholar). In a variety of organisms from bacteria, eukarya, and archaea (9Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S.G.

A. pernix is a strict aerobic hyperthermophilic archaea (15Sako Y. Nomura N. Uchida A. Ishida A. Morii H. Koga Y. Hoaki T. Maruyama T. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1996; 46: 1070-1077Google Scholar). Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanism by which it protects itself against ROS would be of interest. A themostable superoxide dismutase was found in the genomic sequence of A. pernix and characterized (16Yamano S. Sako Y. Nomura N. Maruyama T. J. Biochem. 1999; 126: 218-225Google Scholar). However, additional enzymes related to oxidative damage have not been reported. The A. pernix genome contains an open reading frame (ORF, APE2278) that codes for a protein that is homologous to yeast Prx1p (17Pedrajas J.R. Miranda-Vizuete A. Javanmardy N. Gustafsson J.A. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16296-16301Google Scholar). The Thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase system in A. pernix has been characterized previously (18Jeon S.-J. Ishikawa K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5423-5430Google Scholar). In this paper, we report on the cloning of the gene (APE2278) and the characterization of the product to clarify the role of the protein and its catalytic mechanism. Construction and Expression of the Recombinant Protein—Chromosomal DNA of A. pernix K1 was prepared as described by Sako et al. (15Sako Y. Nomura N. Uchida A. Ishida A. Morii H. Koga Y. Hoaki T. Maruyama T. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1996; 46: 1070-1077Google Scholar). The gene (APE2278) of A. pernix was amplified by PCR using the chromosomal DNA as template and two primers (TP1, 5′-CCGGGCAGCATTCCGCTGATCGGA-3′ (forward), and TP2, 5′-ACTAGATCTTTAGTGTAGGTGTGTTCGGGC-3′ (reverse)), which were designed based on an open reading frame coding for a protein of 250 amino acids. Amplification by PCR was carried out at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °Cfor2s,and 74 °C for 30 s for 30 cycles using KOD DNA polymerase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan). The plasmid pET-3d was then digested with NcoI, treated with T4 DNA polymerase to fill in the cohesive ends, and finally, digested with BamHI again. The amplified PCR products were digested with BglII (the BglII site in primer TP2 is underlined) and inserted into the pET-3d vector. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by an overlap extension method using PCR (19Mullis K. Faloona F. Scharf S. Saiki R. Horn G. Erlich H. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1986; 51: 263-273Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences of the inserted genes were confirmed using an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The transformant Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)-pLysS cells harboring the expression plasmid were grown to a A600 of ∼0.4, and the recombinant protein was then expressed with the induction of 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C. Purification of the Recombinant Proteins—E. coli cells containing the expressed recombinant enzyme were centrifuged and frozen at –70 °C. After thawing, the cells were then disrupted by sonication in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm EDTA). The suspension of disrupted cells was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant fraction was heat-treated at 85 °C for 30 min followed by recentrifugation. The supernatant was loaded on a HiTrap Q column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated in buffer A, and the bound protein was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0–1.0 m in the same buffer). The protein solution was concentrated using a Centricon 10 filter from Amicon (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and dialyzed against buffer B (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mm NaCl). The dialyzed solution was loaded on a HiPrep Sephacryl S-200 HR 26/60 column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with buffer B. The preparation of thioredoxin (ApTrx) and thioredoxin reductase (ApTR) from A. pernix were carried out as described previously (18Jeon S.-J. Ishikawa K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5423-5430Google Scholar). The purity of the recombinant protein was determined by means of 0.1–12% SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined using a Bio-Rad protein assay system with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Assay of Peroxidase Activity—The peroxidase reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.2 mm H2O2 into 0.6 ml of a reaction mixture containing 0.25 mm NADPH, 0.12 μmApTR, 0.45 μmApTrx, 2 μmApTPx, and 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.0, and then incubated at 80 °C. At appropriate reaction times, 50 μl of the reaction mixture was added to 0.95 ml of trichloroacetic acid solution (10%, w/v) to stop the reaction. The precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation, and the peroxidase activity was determined from the amount of peroxide remaining. The peroxide content was determined by measurement of the purple-colored ferrithiocyanate complex (0.2 ml of 10 mm Fe(NH4)2(SO4)2 and 0.1 ml of 2.5 n KSCN were added to a 1-ml aliquot of supernatant) using H2O2 as a standard (20Thurman R.G. Ley H.G. Scholz R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 25: 420-430Google Scholar). The amount of the ferrithiocyanate complex present was determined by measurement of the absorbance at 480 nm. Glutamine Synthetase Protection Assay—TPx antioxidant activity was assayed by monitoring its ability to inhibit the thiol/Fe3+/O2-mediated inactivation of E. coli glutamine synthetase (GS) as described by Kim et al. (21Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Google Scholar). Protection assays were performed in 25-μl reaction mixtures containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, 5 μg of GS, 3 μm FeCl3, 10 mm DTT, and various concentrations of ApTPx. After 10 min at 37 °C, the remaining GS activity was measured by the addition of 2 ml of γ-glutamyltransferase assay mixture as described previously (21Kim K. Kim I.H. Lee K.Y. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4704-4711Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of stop mixture, and the absorbance resulting from the γ-glutamylhydroxamate-Fe3+ complex was measured at 540 nm. Analysis of the Molecular Weight with HPLC—The molecular weight of wild type and mutant ApTPx was determined by HPLC analysis. Purified wild type and mutant ApTPx were applied to a gel filtration column (G3000SW, Tosoh Co., Tokyo, Japan) on a Tosoh HPLC system (Tosoh Co.). The column was equilibrated and eluted at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min with 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, and the elution was monitored at 280 nm. Electron Microscopy—The purified wild type and mutant ApTPx were diluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, to final protein concentrations of 50 μg/ml. A drop of sample (10 μl) was applied onto a carbon-coated grid glow discharged just before sample addition. The samples were negatively stained with 1% (w/v) sodium phosphotungstic acid (Nanoprobes) for 1 min, and then excess liquid was removed with blotting paper. The grids were examined with a Hitachi H-9000 transmission electron microscope operating at 100 kV. Sedimentation Equilibrium—Sedimentation equilibrium measurements of ApTPx were performed using a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuging system. The protein solution was dialyzed extensively against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Two different concentrations (0.3 and 0.6 mg/ml) of sample (100 μl) were loaded into the sample channels of double sector 12-mm centerpieces and 100 μl of buffer into the corresponding reference channels. The centrifugation was conducted in an AnTi-60 rotor at 10,000 rpm for 25 h at 20 °C. Radial absorbance scans were collected in the continuous scan mode at either 280 or 250 nm at 4-min intervals with two replicates and a step size of 0.005 cm. Apparent point-average weight-average molecular weight values (Mr,app) were calculated from plots of ln[c(r)] versus r2 plots (22Teller D.C. Methods Enzymol. 1973; 27: 346-441Google Scholar), where c(r) is the concentration of protein (g/liter) at radial position r. Immunoblot Analysis—BALB/c mice were immunized with 50 μg of ApTPx in complete Freund adjuvant (Wako, Tokyo, Japan) and then at weekly intervals with incomplete Freund adjuvant until anti-ApTPx antibodies were detected in the sera. The antisera were examined for specificity by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed that anti-ApTPx detected ApTPx. The cells from 10-h (exponential phase) cell cultures of A. pernix were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% Triton X-100) and disrupted by sonication for 1 min at 4 °C. The suspension of disrupted cells was centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 0.1% SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels and electroblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Blots were blocked using 5% semi-skimmed milk and incubated with the mouse anti-ApTPx serum at 1:1000 dilution and with anti-mouse polyvalent immunoglobulins conjugated to alkaline phosphatase diluted 1:3000 (Sigma) with intermediate washes in phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20. The bands were visualized by adding nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Bio-Rad). Identification of APE2278 Gene—In the A. pernix K1 genome data base (www.bio.nite.go.jp:8080/dogan/Top), we identified an ORF (GenBank™ accession number APE2278) encoding thioredoxin peroxidase homologue. The ORF APE2278 encodes a protein of 250 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 28702 Da and a pI of 6.79 that has been classified as member of the one-conserved cysteine peroxiredoxin family (1-Cys Prx) (4Schröder E. Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2465-2468Google Scholar, 9Chae H.Z. Robison K. Poole L.B. Church G. Storz G. Rhee S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6303-6311Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). The deduced amino acid sequence shows a 38% identity with the yeast Prx1p, a 35% identity with the human 1-Cys Prx, and a 31% identity with the yeast Tsa2p (2-Cys Prx). The consensus sequence surrounding the conserved cysteine (Cys50) of APE2278 protein, which corresponds to Cys47 of human 1-Cys Prx, is PVCTTE and differs from the corresponding consensus sequence, FVCPTE and PGCSKT, of 2-Cys Prx (5Rhee S.G. Kang S.W. Chang T.S. Jeong W. Kim K. IUBMB Life. 2001; 52: 35-41Google Scholar) and mammalian Prx V (24Seo M.S. Kang S.W. Kim K. Baines I.C. Lee T.H. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20346-20354Google Scholar), respectively. Its C-terminal region is larger than that of Prx enzymes and contains two Cys residues at positions 207 and 213 in addition to the conserved Cys50 (Fig. 1). The homology sequences surrounding Cys207 and Cys213 were not observed in that of yeast Tsa2p (Fig. 1). Thioredoxin Peroxidase Activity of APE2278 Protein—This ORF (APE2278) was amplified by PCR from a A. pernix genomic DNA, cloned, and sequenced to confirm the sequences in the data base. The gene was expressed in E. coli cells, and the recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The question of whether the reducing equivalents required for the presumed peroxidase activity of APE2278 protein could be provided by the Trx system (Trx, TR, and NADPH) was examined. The TPx activity of the recombinant APE2278 protein was examined by time-dependent removal of H2O2 in the presence of the Trx system identified previously in A. pernix (18Jeon S.-J. Ishikawa K. Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 5423-5430Google Scholar). The rate of H2O2 consumption at 80 °C was measured by monitoring the decrease in A480. The APE2278 protein showed peroxide reductase activity in the presence of the Trx system (Fig. 2). All four components (APE2278 protein, Trx, TR, and NADPH) were required for the reduction of H2O2, which was negligible in the absence of any of one of them. This protein linked to the Trx system displays peroxidase activity with a temperature optimum of 85–95 °C, which is in the temperature range for the growth of A. pernix (15Sako Y. Nomura N. Uchida A. Ishida A. Morii H. Koga Y. Hoaki T. Maruyama T. Int. J. Syst. Bacteriol. 1996; 46: 1070-1077Google Scholar). These results indicate that the APE2278 protein is a functional ApTPx of A. pernix. Structure and Role of Cysteine Residues in ApTPx—ApTPx contains three cysteines at positions 50, 207, and 213. To examine the catalytic role of the Cys residues, we constructed three C50S, C207S, and C213S mutant enzymes in which cysteines at positions 50, 207, and 213, respectively, were replaced by serine. For the combinations of all of the three cysteines, C50S/C207S, C50S/C213S, and C207S/C213S mutants were also constructed. The wild type and mutant ApTPx proteins were expressed in E. coli cells and purified from the soluble fraction of the bacterial cells with the method described under “Experimental Procedures.” A recent study (17Pedrajas J.R. Miranda-Vizuete A. Javanmardy N. Gustafsson J.A. Spyrou G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16296-16301Google Scholar, 25Choi H.J. Kang S.W. Yang C.H. Rhee S.G. Ryu S.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 400-406Google Scholar) reported that yeast Prx1p and human 1-Cys Prx form a dimeric structure. To elucidate the oligomeric structure of ApTPx, we examine the molecular weight of ApTPx proteins by SDS-PAGE using a DTT-free gel (PhastGel, Amersham Biosciences) after heating at 95 °C for 5 min in the presence or absence of 5 mm DTT. Under reducing conditions, protein with a molecular size (29 kDa) corresponding to the monomeric form (Fig. 3A) was detected for the wild type as well as the other mutant proteins. Under nonreducing conditions, however, the wild type and C207S mutant showed two bands corresponding to a monomeric and a dimeric form, whereas the other mutants appeared as one band corresponding to the monomeric form (Fig. 3B). Similar patterns of distribution between monomeric and dimeric forms were also observed by SDS-PAGE after treatment with H2O2 (data not shown). These results indicate that the wild type and C207S mutant is present as a mixture of monomers and dimers, which are linked by an intersubunit-disulfide linkage (Cys50-Cys213). The molecular weight of wild type and mutant ApTPxs was determined using gel filtration on a TSK-GEL G3000SW column. The wild type ApTPx showed three peaks (approximately 490, 240, and 30 kDa), one of which corresponded to the hexadecameric form of ApTPx along with the others corresponding to the octameric and monomeric forms, unlike the dimeric homologues from eukaryotes (Fig. 4A). To analyze the oligomer assembly of ApTPx, we examined wild type and mutant proteins with electron microscopy. Micrographs of negatively stained wild type ApTPx showed that this protein exhibited toroid-shaped particles with an outer diameter of 14 nm, an inside diameter of 6 nm, and a thickness of 5 nm (Fig. 5, A and C). The majority of the particles have approximately the same diameter. In the side views appears as single (Fig. 5D) or paired (Fig. 5E) toroid-shaped particle corresponding to octameric or hexadecameric form, respectively. These observations imply that the three-dimensional structure of ApTPx consists of toroid-shaped octameric form and its 2-fold toroid-shaped form. The octameric form of the quaternary structure was dissociated into monomers in the presence of 10 mm DTT (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the octameric form is sensitive to DTT and that the intersubunit-disulfide linkage is responsible for the octameric form in the protein. The Cys50-mutated proteins (C50S and C50S/C207S) were fully converted into an octameric form, and the C50S/C213S mutant showed only a peak corresponding to the monomeric form (Fig. 4, C and E). These data indicate that the Cys50 residue is critical for the production of the hexadecameric form of ApTPx and that mutations at both Cys50 and Cys213 have a profound effect on the dissociation of the octameric form. The C207S and C213S mutants showed a peak corresponding to the hexadecameric form, whereas the C207/213S mutant was converted to an octameric form (Fig. 4, C and D). The C207S/C213S mutant also forms a toroid-shaped structure (Fig. 5B). The size and shapes of the top view are similar to those of the wild type. However, the side view has only one toroid-shaped particle, which reflects the octameric subunit arrangement. These results were consistent with the data from gel filtration experiments. In the case of the C50S, C207S, C213S, and C50S/C207S mutants, DTT treatment had no effect on their quaternary structure, whereas the octameric form of C207S/C213S mutant dissociated into monomer in the presence of 10 mm DTT. These results indicate that the hexadecameric form is insensitive to DTT, but a Cys50-Cys50 intersubunitdisulfide linkage appears to be reduced by DTT. No toroid-shaped particles were observed in micrographs of the C50S and C50S/C207S mutants, suggesting that Cys50 plays an essential role to form the toroid-shaped structure in the oligomerization of ApTPx. The molecular weight of the C50S mutant was also confirmed by sedimentation equilibrium data from the analytical ultracentrifuging system. Plots of apparent weight-average molecular weight, Mr,app, versus concentration of protein, c(r), for two different loading concentrations of protein indicate that the C50S mutant exists as an octamer in its native state (Mr,app = 242947) (Fig. 6).Fig. 5Electron micrographs of the wild type and mutant ApTPx.A, wild type. B, C207S/C213S mutant. C, the toroid structure in the top views. Single (D) and paired (E) toroid structures are shown in the side views.

Apparent weight average molecular weight values (Mr,app) were calculated from absorbance values measured from the equilibrium distribution of the protein in the ultracentrifuging cells. Data were obtained at two separate concentrations, 0.3 (○) and 0.6 mg/ml (□).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Peroxidase Activity of Cys Mutants of ApTPx—In the presence of an electron donor such as DTT, Fe3+ catalyzes the reduction of O2 to H2O2, which is further converted to hydroxyl radicals (OH•) by the Fenton reaction (26Kim K. Rhee S.G. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15394-15397Google Scholar). The DTT-mediated metal-catalyzed oxidation system therefore inflicts damage to various enzymes including glutamine synthetase, and this damage can be prevented by an enzyme that catalyzes the elimination of H2O2. Yeast and mammalian TPx enzymes protect glutamine synthetase from inactivation induced by the metal-catalyzed oxidation system. Oxidized TPx can be reduced by DTT (8Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Google Scholar). ApTPx can also protect glutamine synthetase against damage by the metal-catalyzed oxidation system. To evaluate the peroxidase activity of ApTPx mutants, we used this glutamine synthetase protection assay. The C207S mutant showed protection activity, although it was less effective than the wild type, whereas the mutants lacking Cys50 (C50S, C50S/C207S, and C50S/C213S) failed to show any activity (Fig. 7A). Similarly, the C213S mutant was also inactive. Interestingly, the C207S/C213S mutant retained a protection activity similar to the wild type, thus acting as a revertant of the C213S mutation. These results indicate that Cys50 and Cys213 are required for the enzymatic reaction to proceed, that an efficient reaction involves all of the three cysteines, and that Cys50-SOH can be converted back to Cys-SH by DTT. We also compared the peroxidase activities of the wild type and mutants by directly monitoring the decrease in H2O2 concentration in the presence of the Trx system (Fig. 7B). Consistent with the results of the glutamine synthetase protection assay, C207S was found to be partially active in the Trx-dependent assay and no activity was detected for the other mutants. However, in contrast to the results obtained with the glutamine synthetase protection assay, C207S/C213S was inactive. These data suggest that Cys50 is essential for both Trx- and DTT-dependent peroxidase activities of ApTPx and that Cys213 is essential for Trx-dependent activity but not for DTT-dependent activity. The kinetic parameters for the wild type and C207S mutant were determined by measuring the initial rates of NADPH oxidation in the presence of various concentrations of H2O2 (8Chae H.Z. Chung S.J. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27670-27678Google Scholar). Lineweaver-Burk plots (data not shown) revealed that the Km values for H2O2 of wild type and C207S mutant"
https://openalex.org/W2079078295,"Conditional lethal YidC mutants have been isolated to decipher the role of YidC in the assembly of Sec-dependent and Sec-independent membrane proteins. We now show that the membrane insertion of the Sec-independent M13 procoat-lep protein is inhibited in a short time in a temperature-sensitive mutant when shifted to the nonpermissive temperature. This provides an additional line of evidence that YidC plays a direct role in the insertion of the Sec-independent M13 procoat protein. However, in the temperature-sensitive mutant, the insertion of the Sec-independent Pf3 phage coat protein and the Sec-dependent leader peptidase were not strongly inhibited at the restricted temperatures. Conversely, using a cold-sensitive YidC strain, we find that the membrane insertion of the Sec-independent Pf3 coat protein is blocked, and the Sec-dependent leader peptidase is inhibited at the nonpermissive temperature, whereas the insertion of the M13 procoat protein is nearly normal. These data show that the YidC function for procoat and its function for Pf3 coat and possibly leader peptidase are genetically separable and suggest that the YidC structural requirements are different for the Sec-independent M13 procoat and Pf3 coat phage proteins that insert by different mechanisms. Conditional lethal YidC mutants have been isolated to decipher the role of YidC in the assembly of Sec-dependent and Sec-independent membrane proteins.

These data show that the YidC function for procoat and its function for Pf3 coat and possibly leader peptidase are genetically separable and suggest that the YidC structural requirements are different for the Sec-independent M13 procoat and Pf3 coat phage proteins that insert by different mechanisms. In prokaryotes, membrane proteins can insert into the membrane by a Sec-dependent and Sec-independent pathway. The best studied Sec-independent proteins are the M13 phage procoat and Pf3 phage coat proteins. Up until recently, it was widely believed that these proteins inserted into the membrane by a spontaneous mechanism. In the year 2000, it was found that the membrane insertion of the M13 phage protein requires a newly identified membrane protein called YidC (1Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Google Scholar). YidC was found also to be critical for Pf3 coat membrane insertion and is in close proximity with the Pf3 coat protein during its insertion into the membrane (2Chen M. Samuelson J.C. Jiang F. Muller M. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7670-7675Google Scholar). YidC was suggested to function as a membrane chaperone to help in the folding and integration into the membrane (2Chen M. Samuelson J.C. Jiang F. Muller M. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7670-7675Google Scholar, 3Chen M. Xie K. Jiang F. Yi L. Dalbey R.E. Biol. Chem. 2002; 383: 1565-1572Google Scholar). YidC was implicated also in the membrane insertion of Sec-dependent proteins (1Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Google Scholar, 4Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Google Scholar). YidC was found to be associated with the Sec translocase (4Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 542-549Google Scholar) and can be cross-linked to membrane proteins that are in the process of inserting into the membrane (1Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Google Scholar, 4Scotti P.A. Urbanus M.L. Brunner J. de Gier J.W. von Heijne G. van der Does C. Driessen A.J. Oudega B. Luirink J.

Froderberg L. Saaf A. de Gier J.W. Brunner J. Samuelson J.C. Dalbey R.E. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 524-529Google Scholar). The function of YidC is not fully understood, but it may constitute an assembly factor for folding of hydrophobic domains of polytopic membrane proteins (7Beck K. Eisner G. Trescher D. Dalbey R.E. Brunner J. Muller M. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 709-714Google Scholar) or assist in the transfer of the hydrophobic segments from the Sec channel into the hydrophobic phase of the lipid bilayer (8Luirink J. Samuelsson T. de Gier J.W. FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 1-5Google Scholar). All current evidence showing that YidC plays a role in protein membrane insertion is based on in vitro cross-linking data showing physical interaction between YidC and the protein being inserted into the membrane, as well as in vivo studies examining membrane protein assembly where YidC is depleted in the cell (1Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Google Scholar, 9Samuelson J.C. Jiang F. Yi L. Chen M. de Gier J.-W. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34847-34852Google Scholar). Because the depletion of YidC takes 2–3 h, it has been argued that the role proposed for YidC in membrane protein insertion may not be correct because the effects observed (1Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Google Scholar) may be indirect because of YidC depletion. YidC depletion through several generations of cell growth may cause the depletion of other translocase components, which may result in impaired membrane insertion. Therefore, it is necessary to find a more straightforward approach to examine whether YidC plays a direct role in membrane protein assembly. In this study, we have isolated temperature-sensitive (ts) 1The abbreviations used are: ts, temperature-sensitive; cs, cold-sensitive; Lep, leader peptidase; PClep, procoat-lep; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; wt, wild-type. 1The abbreviations used are: ts, temperature-sensitive; cs, cold-sensitive; Lep, leader peptidase; PClep, procoat-lep; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; wt, wild-type. and cold-sensitive (cs) YidC mutants to examine membrane protein insertion. We show that the insertion of the Sec-independent M13 procoat protein is quickly inhibited in a temperature-sensitive strain when grown at the nonpermissive temperature. In contrast, the membrane insertion of the Sec-independent Pf3 coat and Sec-dependent leader peptidase proteins was not strongly inhibited at the nonpermissive temperature in the ts YidC mutant. These results support the idea that YidC plays a direct role in procoat insertion, and the ts YidC mutation has distinct effects even on the membrane biogenesis of two Sec-independent membrane proteins. Similarly, a discrimination of substrates was also observed with the cs mutant strain. Whereas the insertion of the Sec-independent M13 procoat protein was very efficient, the insertion of the Sec-independent Pf3 protein was blocked, and the Sec-dependent leader peptidase was inhibited. Strains and Plasmids—The genes of leader peptidase (Lep), M13 procoat, procoat-lep (PClep), and Pf3 coat are under the control of the IPTG-inducible tac promoter in the vector pMS119, which contains the lacIq gene. pMAK705, the vector for gene replacement, was kindly obtained from Dr. Sidney R. Kushner. Escherichia coli strain MC1060, which contains wild-type yidC gene, was used as the parental strain to construct the ts or cs YidC strains. JS7131, a YidC depletion strain, is from our lab collection. pINGYidC, in which YidC is under control of araBAD promoter, is also from our lab. Construction of YidC ts and cs Strains by Homology Recombination—yidC mutant genes, flanked by upstream and downstream E. coli chromosome sequences were cloned into pMAK705 (chloramphenicol resistant), which has a temperature-sensitive replication origin. The construct was introduced into the MC1060 strain, and grown at 42 °C on chloramphenicol plates to select for integrants. The integrants were then grown at 30 °C, the temperature at which the plasmid can leave the chromosome and autonomously replicate. This allows an exchange between the wt yidC gene in the chromosome and the yidC mutant gene in the plasmid. Screening of the clones for a successful gene exchange was done by sequencing their yidC gene on the pMAK705 vector or by restriction enzyme digestions of the plasmid DNA. The positive clones carry pMAK705 with a wt yidC gene, instead of a yidC mutant gene. These bacterial strains were cured to remove pMAK705 by growing the cells in LB medium with increasing amounts of coumermycin from 1 to 10 μg/ml. The growing culture with the highest concentration of coumermycin was picked up and screened for the colonies sensitive to chloramphenicol. Those chloramphenicol-sensitive clones were the cells in which the yidC ts or cs genes have replaced the wt chromosomal yidC gene. The ts or cs phenotypes and gene sequences were confirmed. Assay for Membrane Insertion by in Vivo Protease Mapping and Signal Peptide Processing—The cells were grown in LB medium to A600 0.4 at the permissive temperatures, then pelleted, and resuspended in M9 minimal medium (10Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 431Google Scholar). The cells in M9 medium were incubated at the permissive temperature for 30 min. Half of each culture was shifted to the nonpermissive temperature. Prior to labeling, 1 mm IPTG was added to the cultures for 5 min to induce the expression of the plasmid-encoded membrane protein substrates. The cells were then labeled with [35S]trans-methionine (100 μCi/ml cells) for 20 s and quickly chilled on ice. To analyze M13 procoat or PClep, the labeled cells were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. For analysis of Pf3 coat and Lep, and, in certain cases, PClep, radiolabeled cultures were converted to spheroplasts and incubated in the presence or absence of proteinase K (final concentration, 0.5 mg/ml) for 60 min at 0 °C, as described previously (2Chen M. Samuelson J.C. Jiang F. Muller M. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7670-7675Google Scholar). The samples were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Immunoprecipitation with specific antisera as well as analysis by SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging was carried out as previously described (2Chen M. Samuelson J.C. Jiang F. Muller M. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7670-7675Google Scholar). Introduction of Site-specific Protease Sites into YidC Results in Conditional Lethal Mutants—To elucidate the function of YidC in membrane protein insertion, we have isolated conditional lethal (cold- and temperature-sensitive) mutants of YidC. Incorporation of site-specific protease sites into YidC can result in ts and cs mutants. In these studies, Factor Xa, PreScission Protease (Amersham Biosciences), Thrombin, TEV Protease, and Genenase (New England Biolabs) cleavage sites were incorporated into the cytoplasmic and periplasmic loops of YidC. Panels A and B in Fig. 1 show the positions of the protease sites in YidC and flanking amino acid sequences of the protease sites, respectively. The YidC mutants, which were under the control of the YidC natural promoter, were cloned into a low copy number plasmid, pACYC184. These plasmids were transformed into the YidC depletion strain, JS7131, to test whether the YidC mutants can complement the growth defect of YidC depletion when JS7131 is grown in glucose medium at 30, 37, and 42 °C. When Factor Xa and PreScission Protease sites are introduced into the N- and C-terminal region of the first periplasmic loop of YidC (Fig. 1), respectively, this YidC mutant (termed FP) becomes cold-sensitive, i.e. it cannot complement the growth defect of YidC depletion in JS7131 at 30 °C or below (Fig. 2). Incorporation of a thrombin site into the second cytoplasmic loop and a TEV protease site into the last periplasmic loop (mutant termed TTe) results in a YidC temperature-sensitive phenotype, i.e. these mutants cannot function at 42 °C (Fig. 2). The YidC mutants (TF and TG) also show temperature-sensitive phenotypes (data not shown) when the thrombin site in the second cytoplasmic loop is introduced in combination with Genenase site (mutant termed TG) in the last periplasmic loop or with Factor Xa site (mutant termed TF) in the second periplasmic loop of YidC (Fig. 1). All of the cs and ts YidC mutants can complement YidC depletion at 37 °C.Fig. 2Temperature-sensitive and cold-sensitive phenotypes of the YidC mutants. The wt and mutant yidC genes (FP and TTe), under control of yidC natural promoter, were cloned into a low copy number plasmid, pACYC184, and were introduced into the YidC depletion strain, JS7131. The JS7131 cells harboring the constructs were streaked on LB plates containing either 0.2% arabinose (Ara) or glucose (Glc) and incubated at 30 °C for 2 days or at 37 or 42 °C overnight. Each half plate contains three streaks from three individual colonies bearing the same construct.

Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babitzke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Google Scholar). The yidC ts and cs mutant genes (TTe, TF, TG, and FP), described in Fig. 1, were cloned into the integration vector pMAK705, in which the yidC mutant genes were flanked by the upstream natural yidC promoter sequence and the thdf gene, located downstream of the yidC gene in the chromosome. The replication origin of pMAK705 is temperature-sensitive, which makes it suitable for gene replacement. The wt yidC gene in E. coli strain, MC1060, was replaced by either the yidC cs (FP) or ts genes (TTe, TG, and TF). The resulting E. coli strains, in which the yidC FP, TTe, TG, or TF gene has replaced the wt yidC gene, are named the MYC-cs, MYC-Te, MYC-TG, and MYC-TF strains. MYC-cs is the YidC cs strain, whereas MYC-Te, MYC-TG, and MYC-TF are YidC ts strains. The expression of the wt YidC from the pING vector complements the YidC cs and ts strains at their nonpermissive temperatures (data not shown), confirming that the yidC cs or ts mutant genes successfully replaced the chromosomal yidC gene, and the cs or ts phenotype of the strains is based on the mutation in the chromosomal yidC gene. YidC ts and cs Mutant Proteins Show Different Stability Patterns at the Permissive and Nonpermissive Temperatures—We tested the stability of the YidC cs and ts mutant proteins in vivo by determining the protein level of YidC by immunoblotting using a YidC antiserum. As a control, we first examined the stability of wt YidC. Fig. 3 shows wt YidC in the parental strain, MC1060, is stable at 25, 30, and 37 °C but less stable at 42 °C, where there is a slight reduction in the full-length YidC levels (see degradation fragments). The YidC ts mutant in MYC-Te is stable at the permissive temperature (30 °C), whereas it is unstable and degraded at the nonpermissive temperature (42 °C). Note that in the Western blot there is a band above YidC that is recognized nonspecifically by the YidC antiserum. The other ts mutants (TG and TF) were also unstable at the nonpermissive temperature (data not shown). A comparison of the stabilities of wt and ts YidC, suggests that introduction of the protease sites alters the conformation of the YidC protein and makes it sensitive to temperature changes. Such a conformational change in the ts YidC mutant at 42 °C could lead to degradation of the protein by endogenous proteases in the cells. These proteases most likely cleave the ts YidC mutants at sites distinct from the introduced site-specific protease sites. This is supported by the observation that the introduction of one of the protease sites (Thn, Gase, or Fxa2 in Fig. 1) into the YidC mutant was insufficient to generate the ts phenotype (data not shown). The YidC mutant containing a single TEV protease site in last periplasmic loop (Tev in Fig. 1) is one exception. This mutant was found to be temperature-sensitive. Our explanation for this mutant phenotype is that the incorporation of the TEV protease site in the last periplasmic loop is enough to make the conformational change of YidC. In contrast, the YidC cs mutant is more stable at the nonpermissive temperature (25 °C) than at the permissive temperature (37 °C) (Fig. 3). We noticed that even at 25 °C, FP, the YidC cs mutant, is expressed at a lower level as compared with the wild type (Fig. 3). This lower YidC level is not the reason for the cs phenotype because increasing the YidC cs mutant level by the introduction a multicopy plasmid overexpressing this YidC mutant still results in a cs phenotype. In addition, the combination of the protease sites is necessary for the cs phenotype. YidC mutants with a single mutation site (Fxa1 or PS in Fig. 1) incorporated do not display a cs phenotype (data not shown). All of these results suggest that there is a structural change during the temperature switch from 37 to 25 °C. Notably, at the permissive temperature (37 °C), the YidC cs mutant is even less expressed. Nevertheless, even with a reduced level of the cs YidC, there is no growth defect of the cell, and membrane insertion of M13 procoat is unaffected (see the sections below). Procoat Membrane Insertion in the YidC ts Strain Can Be Blocked in a Short Time Period at the Nonpermissive Temperature—Because the ts or cs mutant proteins will be denatured quickly without affecting other translocase components, the use of the conditional lethal strains allows us to discriminate whether the observed membrane protein insertion defects in the YidC depletion strain are due to a defective YidC function or caused by secondary effects of the depletion. Therefore, we tested how quickly membrane protein insertion can be blocked in the YidC ts strains when YidC is inactivated. The membrane insertion of the M13 procoat protein, tagged at the C terminus with the P2 domain of Lep (PClep), was tested in the YidC ts strain, MYC-Te, when the cells were treated at 42 °C for 20, 40, 80, and 120 min. The cells were pulse-labeled for 20 s, and the samples were analyzed for membrane insertion by examining the amount of PClep processed to the mature form by signal peptidase I cleavage. Processing suggests that PClep has successfully inserted across the membrane, because the signal peptidase I active site is on the periplasmic side of the membrane. Fig. 4A shows that the membrane insertion of PClep can be blocked even after only a 20-min treatment at 42 °C, and the protein can insert into membrane efficiently at the permissive temperature (30 °C). As a control, we confirmed that PClep inserts efficiently in the wild-type MC1060 strain at 42 °C (Fig. 4A) despite some degradation of YidC in the cells (Fig. 3, MC1060, 42 °C). To rule out the possibility that the block of PClep insertion is due to a possible effect on signal peptidase I (leader peptidase, Lep) by the YidC ts mutation, we performed the protease accessibility assay to show that the insertion of PClep is inhibited at the nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 4A, right panel). The ts YidC strain, MYC-Te, was pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 20 s after growth for 2 h at the permissive (30 °C) or nonpermissive (42 °C) temperature. As can be seen, the precursor of PClep that accumulates at 42 °C is protected by externally added protease, and very little proteinase K-digested fragment (designated as d in Fig. 4A) was produced. This indicates that the precursor of PClep that accumulates at 42 °C in MYC-Te does not insert into the membrane. We also tested the insertion of the wild-type procoat in MYC-Te cells, and the results are similar to PClep. Procoat is almost completely blocked in MYC-Te after 30 min at 42 °C (Fig. 4B). Taken together, the data provide the most direct evidence yet proving YidC plays a direct role in the insertion of a Sec-independent membrane protein in vivo. The Sec-independent Pf3 Coat and Sec-dependent Leader Peptidase Are Not Strongly Inhibited at the Restricted Temperature in the ts YidC Strain—Next we tested whether the ts mutation had a uniform effect on other membrane proteins. We examined the Sec-independent Pf3 coat protein and Sec-dependent leader peptidase because previous studies showed that the YidC stimulated their insertion (1Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Google Scholar, 2Chen M. Samuelson J.C. Jiang F. Muller M. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7670-7675Google Scholar). MYC-Te, the ts YidC strain, was radiolabeled with [35S]methionine for 20 s after growth for 2 h at the permissive (30 °C) or nonpermissive (42 °C) temperature, converted to spheroplasts, and analyzed by proteinase accessibility as before. Surprisingly, there was an inhibition in the membrane insertion of the Pf3 coat protein at both the nonpermissive temperature (39% Pf3 coat not digested) and the permissive temperature (52% Pf3 coat not digested) (Fig. 4C). This shows that the inhibition of Pf3 coat is not as strong as procoat at the nonpermissive temperature in the ts YidC strain. In addition, there was inhibition in Pf3 coat membrane insertion at the permissive temperature in the ts YidC strain, in contrast to procoat insertion. We then analyzed the Sec-dependent leader peptidase as to its behavior in the MYC-Te strain. There was little inhibition in the membrane insertion of the large C-terminal P2 domain of leader peptidase at the nonpermissive temperature, because almost all of the leader peptidase was digested by the externally added protease (Fig. 4D). A small amount of leader peptidase is resistant to proteinase K digestion at the permissive temperature, indicating a slight inhibition in membrane insertion. These studies, combined with the procoat data in the above section, show that the effect of the ts mutation is different for the membrane proteins examined. Procoat, but Not Pf3 Coat, Can Insert into the Membrane in the YidC cs Strain at the Nonpermissive Temperature—Because the membrane insertion of procoat was blocked in the YidC ts mutant, we expected that procoat would also be blocked in the cs YidC strain. Surprisingly, we found that procoat tagged with P2 Lep domain (PClep) could insert quite efficiently in the YidC cs strain, MYC-cs, at the nonpermissive temperature. Fig. 5A shows that processing of procoat is quite efficient at the nonpermissive temperature for 1, 2, or 3 h (25 °C). PClep inserts into the membrane very efficiently at 37 °C despite a reduction of the level of the cs YidC protein at this temperature (Fig. 3). As a control, we show that PClep was almost completely blocked when YidC was depleted in the arabinose-regulated YidC depletion strain, JS7131, at 25 °C. Additionally, we used the proteinase K assay to confirm that most of PClep truly inserted into the membrane at both 25 and 37 °C (Fig. 5A, right panel). The mature form of PClep gets digested by proteinase K to a smaller protected form (arrow d). We conclude that PClep can insert very efficiently with only a minor inhibition in the cold-sensitive strain at 25 °C. In contrast, the membrane insertion of the Pf3 coat is almost 100% blocked at the nonpermissive temperature, whereas it inserts efficiently at the permissive temperature. Fig. 5B shows that all of the Pf3 coat protein was resistant to protease digestion at the nonpermissive temperature (25 °C), whereas mature OmpA was digested with protease. At the permissive temperature (37 °C) and in the wild-type strain MC1060, Pf3 coat efficiently inserts across the membrane and is digested by externally added protease (Fig. 5B). The data demonstrate that the YidC cold-sensitive mutant can promote the efficient membrane insertion of the Sec-independent procoat, but not Pf3 coat, at its nonpermissive temperature The Sec-dependent Leader Peptidase (Lep) Membrane Insertion Is Impaired at the Nonpermissive Temperature in the YidC cs Strain—As seen with the Pf3 coat protein, the insertion of leader peptidase was also inhibited at the nonpermissive temperature (25 °C) but was not inhibited at the permissive temperature (37 °C) (Fig. 5C) or in the parent strain (MC1060) containing a wild-type YidC grown at 37 or 25 °C (data not shown). The YidC cs strain bearing the plasmid-encoded Lep was pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 20 s after growth for 1 or 2 h at the permissive (37 °C) or nonpermissive (25 °C) temperature. The cells were then converted to spheroplasts and assayed by protease mapping. At the permissive temperature (37 °C), all of the Lep was accessible to protease digestion (Fig. 5C), demonstrating the C-terminal P2 domain inserts across the membrane. In contrast, at the nonpermissive temperature, some of Lep is resistant to proteinase K degradation, showing that insertion is inhibited. Inhibition occurs even after 1 h of growth at the nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 5C). Specifically, we observe that the amounts of Lep blocked at 1 and 2 h at the restrictive temperature (25 °C) are ∼20 and ∼15% (Fig. 5C), respectively. We score this inhibition as rather strong because previous studies showed the membrane insertion of Sec-dependent proteins such as Lep and FtsQ is only partially inhibited (varying from 15 to 30% for Lep and ∼15% for FtsQ) when YidC is depleted (1Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Google Scholar, 6Urbanus M.L. Scotti P.A. Froderberg L. Saaf A. de Gier J.W. Brunner J. Samuelson J.C. Dalbey R.E. Oudega B. Luirink J. EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 524-529Google Scholar, 12Jiang F. Yi L. Moore M. Chen M. Rohl T. Van Wijk K.J. De Gier J.W. Henry R. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19281-19288Google Scholar), and the inhibition observed in MYC-cs is very similar to those effects. In all cases, there is also a block in the export of the outer membrane protein A (OmpA) precursor. We observed that proOmpA accumulation is due mainly to the overexpression of Lep causing the proOmpA block in the cs YidC mutant, because we see ∼90% of proOmpA accumulate when the plasmid-encoded Lep is overexpressed by IPTG induction for 5 min, whereas only ∼45% accumulate when IPTG is not added (compare 25 °C, MYC-cs, + and – lanes in Fig. 5D). This type of observation has been seen before when YidC is depleted and a Sec-dependent protein is overexpressed (9Samuelson J.C. Jiang F. Yi L. Chen M. de Gier J.-W. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34847-34852Google Scholar). The accumulation of OmpA precursors when IPTG is added is likely due to the presence of overexpressed Lep that stalls in the Sec channel when the YidC function is impaired, thereby interfering with protein export by the Sec translocase. There is an effect on OmpA export in the cs YidC at the 25 °C even when IPTG is not added, suggesting that YidC is needed to stimulate export when the temperature is low or that it is required to prevent jamming of endogenous membrane proteins that are expressed within the cell. In this report, we describe the isolation of temperature- and cold-sensitive YidC mutants to study membrane protein insertion in E. coli. We found using a temperature-sensitive mutant that after only 20 min at the nonpermissive temperature, the insertion of PClep was inhibited (Fig. 4A). The YidC ts mutant is inactivated quickly and does not have the problem that the depletion strain JS7131 has where it takes several hours to deplete the cell of YidC (1Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M. Kuhn A. Phillips G.J. Dalbey R.E. Nature. 2000; 406: 637-641Google Scholar). Therefore, the result provides more evidence that YidC plays a direct role in membrane protein insertion. However, we cannot rule out for certain that secondary effects could occur by the structural perturbations and the enhanced proteolysis of the YidC ts mutant at the nonpermissive temperature, which could as a result influence the insertion of membrane proteins. A direct role of YidC in membrane insertion of proteins was recently shown with the Pf3 coat protein. In this study, ribosome-bound Pf3 coat protein was trapped in the membrane insertion process and shown to interact with YidC using a photocross-linking approach (2Chen M. Samuelson J.C. Jiang F. Muller M. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 7670-7675Google Scholar). Although the YidC function for the Sec-independent M13 procoat is strongly inhibited at the nonpermissive temperature (42 °C) in the ts mutant, the function for Sec-independent Pf3 coat protein and Sec-independent leader peptidase is only marginally inhibited (Fig. 4, C and D). Even more surprising was that the membrane insertion of these proteins (Pf3 coat and leader peptidase) is inhibited more strongly at the permissive temperature (30 °C). Notably, procoat inserts into the membrane efficiently at the permissive temperature (30 °C). Therefore, the mutation in the ts mutant has distinct effects depending on the membrane protein being analyzed. Remarkably, the YidC function for the Sec-independent Pf3 coat protein (Fig. 5B) and the Sec-dependent leader peptidase (Fig. 5C) is substantially inhibited in the cs mutant at the nonpermissive temperature, whereas the Sec-independent PClep protein inserts very efficiently (Fig. 5A). At the nonpermissive temperature, there was a complete block in Pf3 coat membrane insertion and a significant inhibition in Lep insertion as well as an inhibition in the export of proOmpA, a secretory protein. This block in insertion at 25 °C takes place in a short time period (1 h) in a cell where the cell doubling time is greater than 2 h (in the M9 minimal media). Nevertheless, procoat can efficiently insert into the membrane and be processed by signal peptidase I (Fig. 5A). The contrasting effects of the cs or ts YidC mutant on the membrane insertion of the Sec-independent M13 procoat and Pf3 coat protein may have to due with the facts that these YidC-dependent proteins insert across the membrane differently, and the structural requirements of YidC may be different for these different insertion mechanisms. For example, procoat inserts across the membrane with two hydrophobic domains (13Kuhn A. Kreil G. Wickner W. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3681-3685Google Scholar), whereas Pf3 coat inserts with only one hydrophobic domain (14Rohrer J. Kuhn A. Science. 1990; 250: 1418-1421Google Scholar). Both of the proteins require the proton motive force for insertion (14Rohrer J. Kuhn A. Science. 1990; 250: 1418-1421Google Scholar, 15Cao G. Kuhn A. Dalbey R.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 866-875Google Scholar, 16Zimmermann R. Watts C. Wickner W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6529-6536Google Scholar). The YidC cs mutant may be perturbed in a region such that it can no longer perform its function to promote Pf3 coat into the membrane, but it can with procoat. The YidC cs mutant is also perturbed in its ability to promote the membrane insertion of the Sec-dependent leader peptidase at the cold temperature (Fig. 5). Therefore, this mutant does not discriminate between the Sec-independent and Sec-dependent pathways. The ts and cs mutants described here are a result of protein engineering and not due to spontaneous mutations or selection pressure, as is the case for the most frequently studied conditional lethal mutants. Both the ts and cs mutants have enhanced proteolysis at the higher temperature (Fig. 3). Therefore, it is not surprising that the MYC-Te mutant cannot complement the YidC depletion strain at 42 °C, because its proteolysis is so significant at this temperature. In contrast, it is surprising that the MYC-cs mutant is functional for membrane protein insertion at the 37 °C, the permissive temperature, where the level of the protein is reduced. In the future it will be important to determine which structural regions of YidC are perturbed in the ts and cs mutant proteins. Additionally, these ts and cs mutants can be utilized to isolate extragenic suppressors that might shed light on additional components that interact with YidC, which may constitute part of the translocase or another complex in which YidC functions.

https://openalex.org/W1997650416,"There is some evidence that the potent cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is able to induce tolerance after repeated stimulation of cells. To investigate the molecular mechanisms mediating this phenomenon, the expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8), which is regulated by transcription factors NF-κB and C/EBPβ, was monitored under TNF tolerance conditions. Pretreatment of monocytic cells for 72 h with low TNF doses inhibited TNF-induced (restimulation with a high dose) IL-8 promoter-dependent transcription as well as IL-8 production. Under these conditions neither activation of NF-κB nor IκB proteolysis was affected after TNF re-stimulation, albeit a slightly reduced IκB-α level was found in the TNF pretreated but not re-stimulated sample. Remarkably, in tolerant cells an increased binding of C/EBPβ to its IL-8 promoter-specific DNA motif as well as an elevated association of C/EBPβ protein with p65-containing NF-κB complexes was observed. Finally, overexpression of C/EBPβ, but not p65 or Oct-1, markedly prevented TNF-induced IL-8 promoter-dependent transcription. Taken together, these data indicate that the expression of IL-8 is inhibited at the transcriptional level in TNF-tolerant cells and C/EBPβ is involved under these conditions in mediating the negative-regulatory effects, a mechanism that may play a role in inflammatory processes such as sepsis.

The phenomenon that pre-exposure to a certain substance induces reduced sensitivity to subsequent challenge with the same stimulus is termed tolerance (1Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. J.

Physiol. 1996; 270: R749-R754Google Scholar, 4Socher S.H. Friedman A. Martinez D. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1957-1962Google Scholar, 5Fraker D.L. Stovroff M.C. Merino M.J. Norton J.A. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 95-105Google Scholar) and partially affects gastrointestinal toxicity (6Patton J.S. Peters P.M. McCabe J. Crase D. Hansen S. Chen A.B. Liggitt D. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 1587-1596Google Scholar). Cyclooxygenase inhibitors prevent the induction of tolerance to the toxic effect of TNF (7Takahashi N. Brouckaert P. Fiers W. J. Immunotherapy. 1993; 14: 16-21Google Scholar). In addition, some form of cross-tolerance has been described, e.g. pre-exposure to TNF also modulates certain effects of lipopolysaccharide including fever, hypophagia, and lethality (3Goldbach J.-M. Roth J. Störr B. Zeisberger E. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: R749-R754Google Scholar, 5Fraker D.L. Stovroff M.C. Merino M.J. Norton J.A. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 95-105Google Scholar, 8Porter M.H. Arnold M. Langhans W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: R741-R745Google Scholar). The molecular mechanisms underlying TNF tolerance are only poorly understood (4Socher S.H. Friedman A. Martinez D. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1957-1962Google Scholar, 9Takahashi N. Brouckaert P. Fiers W. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: R398-R405Google Scholar, 10Takahashi N. Brouckaert P. Bemelmans M.H.A. Buurman W.A. Fiers W. Cytokine. 1994; 6: 235-242Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been described that long term (11Laegreid A. Thommesen L. Gullstein Jahr T. Sundan A. Espevik T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25418-25425Google Scholar) as well as short term (12Ferlito M. Romanenko O.G. Ashton S. Squadrito F. Halushka P.V. Cook J.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 821-829Google Scholar, 13Poppers D.M. Schwenger P. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29587-29593Google Scholar) pretreatment with TNF reduced subsequent TNF-induced activation of transcription factor NF-κB and/or proteolysis of its inhibitor IκB-α. TNF is a potent activator of NF-κB, which is a dimeric complex most frequently assembled from the subunits RelA (p65) and p50 (14Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Google Scholar, 15Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Google Scholar, 16Wulczyn F.G. Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 749-769Google Scholar). Activation of this transcription factor by TNF is initiated mainly by binding to cell surface TNF receptor 1 (17Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Google Scholar). Subsequent signaling occurs through the recruitment of cytosolic signaling proteins including TNF receptor-associated death domain protein, receptor-interacting protein, and TNF receptor-associated factor 2, eventually leading to the activation of the IκB kinase complex (17Baud V. Karin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: 372-377Google Scholar, 18Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Google Scholar, 19Wallach D. Varfolomeev E.E. Malinin N.L. Goltsev Y.V. Kovalenko A.V. Boldin M.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 331-367Google Scholar). This high molecular weight assembly kinase phosphorylates the IκB inhibitor proteins (18Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Google Scholar, 20Israel A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 129-133Google Scholar), which trap the NF-κB dimer in the cytosol in a non-activated state (14Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Google Scholar, 16Wulczyn F.G. Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 749-769Google Scholar). IκB is subsequently degraded in an ubiquitin-dependent step by the proteasome, thereby allowing the liberated NF-κB dimer to translocate to the nuclear compartment (14Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Google Scholar, 15Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Google Scholar, 16Wulczyn F.G. Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 749-769Google Scholar). Within the nucleus, NF-κB is involved in the coordinated expression of numerous target genes, including the potent cytokine and chemokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) (14Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Google Scholar, 15Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Google Scholar, 16Wulczyn F.G. Krappmann D. Scheidereit C. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 749-769Google Scholar, 21Matsushima K. Morishita K. Yoshimura T. Lavu S. Kobayashi Y. Lew W. Appella E. Kung H.F. Leonard E.J. Oppenheim J.J. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1883-1893Google Scholar, 22Roebuck K.A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 429-438Google Scholar). IL-8, a member of the CXC family of chemokines, has been implicated in a variety of inflammatory diseases (21Matsushima K. Morishita K. Yoshimura T. Lavu S. Kobayashi Y. Lew W. Appella E. Kung H.F. Leonard E.J. Oppenheim J.J. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1883-1893Google Scholar, 22Roebuck K.A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 429-438Google Scholar). Gene transcription is one major point of control at which expression of IL-8 is regulated (22Roebuck K.A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 429-438Google Scholar, 23Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21128-21133Google Scholar). Functional studies indicate that IL-8 transcriptional responses to mediators such as TNF are rapid and require only 100 nucleotides of 5′-flanking DNA upstream of the TATA box (22Roebuck K.A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 429-438Google Scholar, 23Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21128-21133Google Scholar). Within this region DNA binding sites for the inducible transcription factors NF-κB and C/EBPβ (24Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. Adashi E.Y. Graves B.J. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 786-800Google Scholar, 25Wedel A. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Immunobiol. 1995; 193: 171-185Google Scholar) were found located next to each other (see Fig. 1; Ref. 23Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21128-21133Google Scholar). Transcription factors from these families bind the IL-8 promoter as dimers, and several distinct subunit combinations have been identified (23Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21128-21133Google Scholar, 26Kunsch C. Rosen C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6137-6146Google Scholar). C/EBPβ physically interacts with NF-κB, and functional cooperativity among the factors appears to be critical for optimal IL-8 promoter activity in different cell types (27Stein B. Cogswell P.C. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3964-3974Google Scholar, 28Stein B. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7191-7198Google Scholar). IL-8 transcription appears to be activated by a promoter recruitment mechanism where inducible transcription factors are required for binding of TATA box proteins and formation of a stable preinitiation complex (22Roebuck K.A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 429-438Google Scholar). In addition, the POU-homeodomain transcription factor Oct-1, which binds to an overlapping sequence within the C/EBPβ site, appears to be involved in regulation of basal transcriptional activity of the IL-8 promoter (29Wu G.D. Lai E.J. Huang N. Wen X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2396-2403Google Scholar). The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying TNF tolerance. To initiate tolerance-like conditions, monocytic cells were pretreated with low TNF concentrations for 72 h and then re-stimulated with a high TNF dose. Under these conditions the expression of the IL-8 gene was monitored as a read-out, and the roles of NF-κB, C/EBPβ, and Oct-1 were examined. Cell Culture Conditions and Reagents—THP-1 human monocytic cells (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) were maintained in suspension in RPMI 1640 (Glutamax-1, low endotoxin) containing 7% fetal calf serum (low endotoxin), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) (30Fischer C. Page S. Weber M. Eisele T. Neumeier D. Brand K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24625-24632Google Scholar). For the experiments, the cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106 per well in 6-well culture dishes. Human recombinant TNF was obtained from Sigma (Deisenhofen, Germany). HeLa cells (DSMZ) were cultured in Dulbecco's minimum Eagle's medium (Biochrom) (10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin). Endotoxin contamination was screened by the limulus amoebocyte lysate assay (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD). A potential toxicity of the cell culture conditions applied was monitored by cell morphology/count, trypan blue dye exclusion, and the WST-1 test (Roche Diagnostics). Transfection of THP-1 Cells—In transfection studies pGL2-IL-8 (420 bp of the IL-8 promoter region), a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid, was utilized (30Fischer C. Page S. Weber M. Eisele T. Neumeier D. Brand K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24625-24632Google Scholar, 31Page S. Fischer C. Baumgartner B. Haas M. Kreusel U. Loidl G. Hayn M. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Neumeier D. Brand K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11611-11618Google Scholar). This plasmid (1 μg) was transiently co-transfected with 0.2 μg of a constitutively active Renilla luciferase control plasmid, pRLtk (Promega, Mannheim, Germany), into THP-1 cells using a DEAE-dextran-based protocol (30Fischer C. Page S. Weber M. Eisele T. Neumeier D. Brand K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24625-24632Google Scholar, 31Page S. Fischer C. Baumgartner B. Haas M. Kreusel U. Loidl G. Hayn M. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Neumeier D. Brand K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11611-11618Google Scholar). After transfection, cells were plated at a density of 2 × 106/3 ml of RPMI with 7% fetal calf serum in a 6-well plate and incubated for 72 h (without or with TNF pretreatment). After this time, the cells were left untreated or stimulated for 5 h with TNF at 0.1–100 ng/ml. Subsequent to stimulation the cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was determined using the Dual Luciferase Reporter assay system (Promega). Results are expressed as relative luciferase activity, which means that firefly relative light units were divided by Renilla relative light units. Determination of IL-8—The supernatant concentration of IL-8 protein was measured by sandwich type immunoassay (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden-Nordenstadt, Germany). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—Nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed as described (31Page S. Fischer C. Baumgartner B. Haas M. Kreusel U. Loidl G. Hayn M. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Neumeier D. Brand K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11611-11618Google Scholar, 32Brand K. Page S. Rogler G. Bartsch A. Brandl R. Knuechel R. Page M. Kaltschmidt C. Baeuerle P.A. Neumeier D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1715-1722Google Scholar). The sense strand sequences of the IL-8 oligonucleotides C/EBP-β (IL-8) as well as NF-κB (IL-8) are listed in Fig. 1 (28Stein B. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7191-7198Google Scholar, 29Wu G.D. Lai E.J. Huang N. Wen X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2396-2403Google Scholar). These oligonucleotides were applied as a probe and labeled with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Roche Diagnostics) using [α-32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Brussels, Belgium). In some experiments the 35-mer (IL-8) oligonucleotide was used, which contains the sequence of both C/EBPβ (IL-8) and NF-κB (IL-8). Oct-1 and Sp-1 binding was analyzed using consensus oligonucleotides (Promega) labeled with [γ32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). Nuclear proteins were incubated with the radiolabeled probes for 30 min at room temperature in 20 μl of binding buffer (12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 4 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.6 mm EDTA, 12% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 ng/μl poly(dI-dC)) as described (28Stein B. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7191-7198Google Scholar). Samples were run in 0.25× TBE (10× TBE: 890 mm Tris, 890 mm boric acid, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) on non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. Supershift and Competition Studies—The nuclear extracts were incubated with 2 μl of appropriate TransCruz gel supershift antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg, Germany) per 20 μl of reaction volume in binding buffer at 4 °C for 1 h before EMSA. The following antibodies were used: anti-p65, anti-C/EBPβ, and anti-Oct-1. In competition studies, samples were incubated with a 100× excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide: NF-κB (IL-8), C/EBPβ (IL-8), and Oct-1 (Fig. 1) as well as Sp-1 (Promega). PAGE and Western Blot Analysis—Cytosolic and nuclear extracts were isolated as described (30Fischer C. Page S. Weber M. Eisele T. Neumeier D. Brand K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24625-24632Google Scholar), and electrophoresis was performed with 12.5% polyacrylamide gels. The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes using the wet blot technique. After transfer, the membranes were incubated with antibodies against TNF receptor-associated factors 1 and 2, receptor-interacting protein, IκB kinase-α, IκB-α, p65, p50, cyclin B1, Sp-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or actin (Sigma). This was followed by the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). The proteins were visualized on x-ray film using the Chemiluminescent Reagent Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Immunoprecipitation (IP)—Nuclear extracts were subjected to IP (30Fischer C. Page S. Weber M. Eisele T. Neumeier D. Brand K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24625-24632Google Scholar) in TN buffer (200 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 μm 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin, antipain, aprotinin, pepstatin A, chymostatin 0.75 μg/ml each; Sigma). IP was carried out at 4 °C overnight with 2 μg of anti-C/EBPβ, anti-p65, anti-cyclin B1 or anti-Sp-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and 70 μl of 6% protein A agarose (Roche Diagnostics). After washing five times with TN buffer the precipitated proteins were analyzed by PAGE and Western blot analysis. Overexpression Experiments—The plasmids used included C/EBPβ, Oct-1 (wild type, mutated), and p65 (14Baeuerle P.A. Baltimore D. Cell. 1996; 87: 13-20Google Scholar, 33Pope R. Mungre S. Liu H. Thimmapaya B. Cytokine. 2000; 8: 1171-1181Google Scholar, 34Shah P.C. Bertolino E. Singh H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7105-7117Google Scholar). RcCMV (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands) containing no insert was used as a negative control. These plasmids (10 μg) were transiently co-transfected with 0.2 μg of pRLtk and 1 μg of pGL2-IL-8 into HeLa cells using Superfect (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). After overnight culture, cells were left untreated or stimulated for 5 h with TNF at 20 ng/ml followed by lysis, and relative luciferase activity was determined. Long Term Pretreatment with Low TNF Doses Inhibits TNF-induced IL-8 Promoter-dependent Transcription as Well as IL-8 Production—For the present study we decided to pretreat with a low dose of TNF for 72 h to induce a tolerance-like condition as described (11Laegreid A. Thommesen L. Gullstein Jahr T. Sundan A. Espevik T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25418-25425Google Scholar) and then re-stimulate with a significantly higher dose and monitor for IL-8 promoter-dependent transcription as well as IL-8 expression. Please note that in the following the low dose TNF-pretreated cells are designated as “tolerant cells.” Initially, dose response experiments were performed with THP-1 monocytic cells to establish a window in which TNF exerts its effect on IL-8 promoter-dependent transcription measured by luciferase reporter assays (Fig. 2A). In these studies we observed a dose-dependent increase in transcriptional activity in a range from 0.1 to 100 ng/ml TNF. The following protocol was selected for most of the experiments: preincubation with 1 ng/ml TNF or medium for 72 h (indicated as TNF pre in the Figs. 2, 3, 4, and 6) followed by re-stimulation with a 20-fold higher concentration (20 ng/ml) for 5 h (depicted as TNF re in Figs. 2, 3, 4, and 6). Pretreatment with TNF led to a significant reduction in IL-8 promoter-dependent transcriptional activity when cells were re-stimulated with the higher TNF dose compared with cells that were preincubated with medium alone (Fig. 2B). Consistent with the results above we found a 70% inhibition of the production of the IL-8 protein measured by immunoassay in tolerant cells (Fig. 2C). Similar effects were observed when HeLa cells were treated under the same conditions (data not shown).Fig. 3NF-κB activation as well as IκB proteolysis are not affected. Monocytic cells were incubated with medium alone or medium containing 1 ng/ml TNF (TNF pre) for 72 h followed by stimulation with TNF (20 ng/ml, TNF re) for 15 min. A, nuclear extracts were subjected to EMSA using an oligonucleotide containing the NF-κB site of the IL-8 promoter. Brackets indicate NF-κB binding. The asterisk marks a control reaction in which a 100-fold concentration of unlabeled oligonucleotide was added to the EMSA. Supershift experiments were performed with the extract of the pretreated, re-stimulated cells (TNF pre, TNF re) using antibodies (Ab) against p65 and Oct-1 as well as C/EBPβ, and the arrow marks the complexes remaining in the loading slot by preincubation with an antibody against p65. N.S., nonspecific band. Cytosolic (B) as well as nuclear (C) extracts were examined by Western blot for the presence of the indicated proteins (arrows). Representative experiments are shown for each condition, which were repeated at least five times. RIP, receptor-interacting protein; IKK, IκB kinase.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 4DNA binding activity of C/EBPβ as well as association of C/EBPβ protein with p65 are increased in TNF-tolerant cells. THP-1 monocytic cells were preincubated with medium alone or medium with 1 ng/ml TNF for 72 h (TNF pre) and then left untreated or stimulated with TNF (20 ng/ml, TNF re) for 15 min. A, nuclear extracts were examined by EMSA using a radiolabeled C/EBPβ (IL-8) or Sp-1 consensus oligonucleotide. Specific binding to these oligonucleotides is indicated by brackets for C/EBPβ (IL-8) or an arrow (Sp-1). Supershift experiments were performed on nuclear extracts of the pretreated, re-stimulated cells (TNF pre, TNF re) using antibodies (Ab) against C/EBPβ, Oct-1, and p65. The arrow shows the position of the bands shifted by preincubation with antibodies against C/EBPβ (intense signal) or Oct-1 (very faint band), respectively. N.S., nonspecific band. The same sample was examined in competition studies (Comp.) with a 100-fold excess of oligonucleotide (Unlabeled oligo: C/EBPβ (IL-8), C/EBP cons., Sp-1, or Oct-1 cons.). B, nuclear extracts were isolated and subjected to IP with anti-C/EBPβ (upper panel) or anti-p65 (middle panel). The precipitated proteins were then analyzed by Western blot for the presence of p65 (upper panel) or C/EBPβ (middle panel). The asterisk marks an IP reaction without extract. Furthermore, a control IP was performed under the same conditions, and the protein (cyclin B1) was detected by Western blot. At least five independent experiments were performed for each condition.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 6Effect of Oct-1 on TNF-induced IL-8 promoter-dependent transcription.A, THP-1 monocytic cells were preincubated with medium alone or medium with 1 ng/ml TNF for 72 h (TNF pre) and then left untreated or stimulated with TNF (20 ng/ml, TNF re) for 15 min. Nuclear extracts were analyzed by EMSA as well as competition analysis (Comp.) using a radiolabeled Oct-1 cons. sequence as probe. Brackets indicate Oct-1 binding. A 100-fold excess of oligonucleotide (Unlabeled oligo) was used for competition studies using nuclear extracts of the pretreated, re-stimulated cells (TNF pre, TNF re). B, HeLa cells were co-transfected with pGL2-IL-8, pRLtk, and an overexpression plasmid for Oct-1 (wt, wild type; mut, mutated) or CMV. After overnight culture the cells were left untreated (white bars) or stimulated with TNF (20 ng/ml) for 5 h (black bars). After lysis, firefly as well as Renilla relative light units were measured. Data are expressed as relative luciferase activity (RLA; mean ± S.D.) of three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Activation of NF-κB as Well as IκB Proteolysis Are Not Affected—Because the IL-8 gene is transcriptionally regulated by NF-κB (22Roebuck K.A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 429-438Google Scholar, 23Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21128-21133Google Scholar), it was next tested to determine whether low dose TNF pretreatment can affect the activation of NF-κB. After preincubation, monocytic cells were re-stimulated with TNF for 15 min, and EMSAs were performed using an oligonucleotide comprising the κB motif of the human IL-8 promoter (NF-κB (IL-8), see Fig. 1). Re-stimulation with TNF induced a significant NF-κB binding activity in non-pretreated cells or a slightly further increased NF-κB binding activity in low dose TNF pretreated cells (Fig. 3A). NF-κB binding was confirmed using supershift analysis as well as oligonucleotide competition (Fig. 3A). Under the same conditions, TNF-induced IκB-α proteolysis was not affected after re-stimulation, determined by Western blot analysis, albeit a slightly reduced IκB-α level was found in the TNF-pretreated but not re-stimulated sample (Fig. 3B). As expected, stimulation with TNF was accompanied by an increase in the nuclear levels of p65 and p50 (Fig. 3C). The amount of several upstream signaling molecules involved in TNF-induced NF-κB activation such as TNF receptor-associated factor 1 and 2, receptor-interacting protein, and IκB kinase-α as well as actin were not changed (Fig. 3B). The expression of TNF receptor 1 (p55) as well as TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (p75) were not affected under these conditions as shown by flow cytometry (data not shown). C/EBPβ DNA Binding Activity as Well as Association of C/EBPβ Protein with p65 Are Increased under TNF Tolerance Conditions—Several other transcription factors besides NF-κB are involved in the regulation of the IL-8 gene, including C/EBPβ (28Stein B. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7191-7198Google Scholar). To evaluate if this transcription factor is involved in TNF tolerance, EMSAs were performed using an oligonucleotide solely encompassing the C/EBPβ binding site of the IL-8 promoter (C/EBPβ (IL-8), see Fig. 1) in cells that were pretreated with TNF (1 ng/ml) (TNF preincubation) or medium for 72 h and then re-stimulated with a 20-fold higher dose (TNF re-stimulation) for 15 min. Under these conditions an elevated binding of nuclear proteins to the C/EBPβ site was observed in TNF-tolerant cells (Fig. 4A). Supershift analysis as well as oligonucleotide competition demonstrated the presence of C/EBPβ but also a small amount of Oct-1 in these complexes. In the same nuclear extracts we also examined the binding of nuclear proteins to oligonucleotides comprising the Sp-1 consensus sequence (Sp-1) to monitor quality and equal loading, which was not changed under these conditions (Fig. 4A). Previous studies demonstrate a functional and physical association between NF-κB and C/EBP family proteins (27Stein B. Cogswell P.C. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3964-3974Google Scholar, 28Stein B. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7191-7198Google Scholar, 35Prösch S. Heine A.-K. Volk H.-D. Krüger D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40712-40720Google Scholar). Therefore, in the following we attempted to determine by co-immunoprecipitation studies whether C/EBPβ associates with NF-κB complexes in cells that were first pretreated with TNF and then re-stimulated with this cytokine as described above. C/EBPβ was immunoprecipitated in nuclear extracts, and p65 was detected in the precipitate by Western blot analysis or vice versa. Remarkably, these experiments demonstrated an increased association of C/EBPβ protein with p65-containing NF-κB complexes in TNF-tolerant cells (TNF pre), which was most intensive after TNF re-stimulation (TNF re) (Fig. 4B). To show the specificity of the bands the IP was carried out without any extract (marked by an asterisk). In addition, control IP reactions were performed using antibodies against cyclin B1 (Fig. 4B) or Sp-1 (data not shown), demonstrating comparable levels of these precipitated proteins in the nuclear extracts regardless of TNF treatment. Furthermore, no specific signal was detected when IP was performed with an unspecific IgG antibody (data not shown). Overexpression of C/EBPβ Prevents TNF-induced IL-8 Promoter-dependent Transcription—To further determine if C/EBPβ is involved in the negative regulation of TNF-induced IL-8 promoter-dependent transcription we performed transfection studies. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with the CMV control vector or expression plasmids coding for C/EBPβ wild type or a mutated form, respectively. Most importantly, these experiments showed that the presence of C/EBPβ significantly inhibited TNF-induced IL-8 promoter-dependent transcription, whereas no effect was found when the mutated protein was expressed (Fig. 5A). When we performed control experiments with cells expressing C/EBPβ, we observed an elevated DNA binding of this transcription factor (Fig. 5B) using the C/EBPβ (IL-8) as well as the 35-mer (IL-8) oligonucleotide (see “Experimental Procedures”). After TNF stimulation of these transfected cells, we detected a broadened band using the 35-mer (IL-8) oligonucleotide, which enables binding of both C/EBPβ and NF-κB (Fig. 5B, right; data not shown). Furthermore, p65 overexpression experiments demonstrated a direct effect of p65 on IL-8 promoter-dependent transcription, but in contrast to the studies with C/EBPβ, no inhibitory effect on TNF-induced transcriptional activity was found (Fig. 5C). The presence of the expressed proteins was also monitored by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Effect of Oct-1 on TNF-induced IL-8 Promoter-dependent Transcription—The transcription factor Oct-1 has been suggested to be negatively involved in the regulation of the IL-8 gene (29Wu G.D. Lai E.J. Huang N. Wen X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2396-2403Google Scholar). Therefore, DNA binding activity was examined using an oligonucleotide solely encompassing an Oct-1 consensus sequence. In these experiments we also observed an increased binding of nuclear proteins to the Oct-1 oligonucleotide in TNF-tolerant cells (Fig. 6A). Specificity of the bands was confirmed by oligonucleotide competition experiments and supershift analysis (Fig. 6A, data not shown). However, when Oct-1 was expressed in transfection experiments no inhibitory effect on TNF-induced activation of IL-8 promoter-dependent transcription was observed (Fig. 6B). Several studies describe the existence of TNF tolerance in vivo and suggest that this phenomenon may play an important role in disease states such as inflammation and sepsis (4Socher S.H. Friedman A. Martinez D. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 167: 1957-1962Google Scholar, 5Fraker D.L. Stovroff M.C. Merino M.J. Norton J.A. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 95-105Google Scholar, 8Porter M.H. Arnold M. Langhans W. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: R741-R745Google Scholar, 9Takahashi N. Brouckaert P. Fiers W. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: R398-R405Google Scholar). However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms have not been very well established. The present study demonstrates that long term preincubation with low TNF doses induced a tolerant state in monocytic cells. Under these conditions, when cells were re-stimulated with a subsequent high dose of TNF, we observed a significant inhibition of IL-8 promoter-dependent transcription as well as protein production of IL-8, which is regulated by NF-κB transcription factors (Refs. 22Roebuck K.A. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1999; 19: 429-438Google Scholar and 23Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21128-21133Google Scholar; Fig. 1). The observation that in TNF-tolerant cells neither the activation of NF-κB nor IκB proteolysis was affected after TNF restimulation suggests transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. It should also be mentioned that in TNF-pretreated, but not restimulated samples, a slightly reduced IκB-α level was found that may be due to a low level of ongoing signaling associated with IκB-α degradation under the conditions of TNF pretreatment, as similarly described (13Poppers D.M. Schwenger P. Vilcek J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29587-29593Google Scholar). In an earlier study, contrasting results were reported in which long term TNF pretreatment inhibited TNF-induced NF-κB activation determined by EMSAs in a human adenocarcinoma cell line (11Laegreid A. Thommesen L. Gullstein Jahr T. Sundan A. Espevik T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25418-25425Google Scholar), indicating cell type-specific differences. Interestingly, in a recent study it was suggested that TNF and ceramide preconditioning differentially modulates NF-κB-mediated transactivation in astrocyte cultures by a p300-dependent mechanism (36Ginis I. Jaiswal R. Klimanis D. Liu J. Greenspon J. Hallenbeck J.M. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2002; 22: 142-152Google Scholar). It is of note that short term pretreatment of THP-1 cells appears to lead to a different form of TNF tolerance since under these conditions an inhibition of NF-κB activation as well as IκB degradation was found (12Ferlito M. Romanenko O.G. Ashton S. Squadrito F. Halushka P.V. Cook J.A. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2001; 70: 821-829Google Scholar) that in our hands goes along with reduced expression of TNF receptors (data not shown). Interestingly, several mechanisms have also been found in lipopolysaccharide-tolerant cells in which transcriptional mechanisms (e.g. increase of inhibiting p50/p50 homodimers) (37Ziegler-Heitbrock L. J. Endotoxin Res. 2001; 7: 219-222Google Scholar, 38Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W.L. Wedel A. Schraut W. Ströbel M. Wendelgass P. Sternsdorf T. Baeuerle P.A. Haas J.G. Riethmüller G. J. Biol.

Invest. 1998; 102: 1645-1652Google Scholar) as well as impaired translocation of NF-κB (11Laegreid A. Thommesen L. Gullstein Jahr T. Sundan A. Espevik T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25418-25425Google Scholar, 40Adib-Conquy M. Cavaillon J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27927-27934Google Scholar) are responsible for this condition. Remarkably, under TNF tolerance conditions (long term, low dose preincubation) we observed an increased DNA binding of C/EBPβ to its IL-8 promoter-specific motif using EMSAs. C/EBPβ is a transcriptional protein that is involved in negative and positive regulation of a variety of genes including IL-8 (23Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21128-21133Google Scholar, 24Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. Adashi E.Y. Graves B.J. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 786-800Google Scholar, 25Wedel A. Ziegler-Heitbrock H.W. Immunobiol. 1995; 193: 171-185Google Scholar,28Stein B. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7191-7198Google Scholar). It was also suggested earlier (35Prösch S. Heine A.-K. Volk H.-D. Krüger D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40712-40720Google Scholar) that simultaneous binding of C/EBP proteins and NF-κB to DNA may strengthen the inhibitory effect of C/EBP possibly by forming a more stable protein-protein-DNA complex. In addition, in coimmunoprecipitation studies we observed an increased association of C/EBPβ protein with p65-containing NF-κB complexes in the nucleus of tolerant cells, which was most intensive after TNF re-stimulation. In this context, it should be noted that functional and physical associations between NF-κB subunits (p65, p50) and C/EBP family members as well as other ATF bZIP proteins have been reported (27Stein B. Cogswell P.C. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3964-3974Google Scholar, 28Stein B. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7191-7198Google Scholar, 41LeClair K.P. Blanar M.A. Sharp P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8145-8149Google Scholar, 42Du W. Thanos D. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 74: 887-898Google Scholar) that are mediated by a Rel domain-bZIP interaction. Most importantly, the present study was able to show functional consequences using transfection experiments, demonstrating that overexpression of C/EBPβ, but not p65, inhibited TNF-induced IL-8 promoter-dependent transcription. Similar results were obtained in a previous report, which shows that C/EBPβ overexpression inhibits p65-directed transcriptional activity dependent on an IL-8 promoter fragment (28Stein B. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7191-7198Google Scholar). Taken together our findings imply C/EBPβ as a key molecule in mediating the inhibitory effects on IL-8 expression in TNF-tolerant cells. We also found an increased binding activity of the transcription factor Oct-1 in TNF-pretreated cells. It has been shown that Oct-1 represses basal transcriptional activity of the IL-8 promoter by binding independently to an element overlapping that of C/EBPβ (29Wu G.D. Lai E.J. Huang N. Wen X. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2396-2403Google Scholar) and acts as a transcriptional repressor for a number of other regulatory regions (43Mack D.H. Laimins L.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9102-9106Google Scholar, 44Sibbet G.J. Cuthill S. Campo M.S. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4006-4011Google Scholar, 45Tanaka M. Herr W. Cell. 1990; 60: 375-386Google Scholar). However, overexpression of Oct-1 had no effect on TNF-induced IL-8 promoter-dependent transcription, suggesting that Oct-1 is not involved in negative regulation under TNF tolerance conditions. The role of C/EBPβ in regulating promoters with NF-κB and C/EBP binding sites appears to be complex. In general, NF-κB and C/EBP synergistically activate promoters with C/EBP binding sites but inhibit promoters with κB binding sites (27Stein B. Cogswell P.C. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3964-3974Google Scholar). As an example for the latter, C/EBP family proteins have been shown to negatively influence NF-κB-mediated activation of the angiotensinogen gene acute-phase response element (46Brasier A.R. Ron D. Tate J.E. Habener J.F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3933-3944Google Scholar) and p65-dependent cytomegalovirus IE1/2 enhancer/promoter activity (35Prösch S. Heine A.-K. Volk H.-D. Krüger D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40712-40720Google Scholar) as well as expression of the NF-κB target gene c-myc (47Johansen L.M. Iwama A. Lodie T.A. Sasaki K. Felsher D.W. Golub T.R. Tenen D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3789-3806Google Scholar). In the case of the IL-8 promoter, in which the C/EBP binding site is adjacent to the NF-κB site (23Mukaida N. Mahe Y. Matsushima K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21128-21133Google Scholar), similar to the IE1/2 enhancer/promoter (35Prösch S. Heine A.-K. Volk H.-D. Krüger D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40712-40720Google Scholar), a subtle interaction between NF-κB and C/EBP appears to determine whether the IL-8 promoter is activated or inhibited (28Stein B. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7191-7198Google Scholar). As discussed above, in TNF-tolerant cells we find an increased binding of C/EBPβ to its IL-8 promoter motif as well as association of this protein with p65. The physical interaction found between these transcription proteins may be responsible for the observed inhibitory effects of C/EBPβ on NF-κB. Indeed, it has been suggested earlier (27Stein B. Cogswell P.C. Baldwin A.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3964-3974Google Scholar) that C/EBP blocks the ability of NF-κB to interact with a critical co-activator of the basal transcriptional machinery and/or that C/EBPβ and NF-κB form a higher order transcription factor complex with reduced transcriptional activity at κB enhancers. In summary, the present study describes a new molecular mechanism modulating IL-8 gene expression in TNF-tolerant cells. Induction of tolerance to control deleterious effects of TNF may play a role in preventing excessive influx of IL-8-responsive granulocytes in infection and inflammation and may potentially improve survival and outcome in processes such as septic shock.

To address this issue we have determined the solution structure of the C-terminal or BC domain of CNTFR and studied the interactions of CNTFR with LIFR and gp130.

This family also includes leukemia inhibitory factor, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-11, oncostatin M, cardiotrophin-1, and the newly identified cardiotrophin-like cytokine (1Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev.

Acta Helv. 2000; 74: 265-272Google Scholar) and has been investigated as a therapeutic agent for motor neuron disease (5The ALS CNTF Treatment Study Phase I–II Study Group Arch. Neurol. 1996; 53: 141-147Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown to have a promising role in the treatment of obesity and diabetes (6Lambert P.D. Anderson K.D. Sleeman M.W. Wong V. Tan J. Hijarunguru A. Corcoran T.L. Murray J.D. Thabet K.E. Yancopoulos G.D. Wiegand S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rieckmann P. Lassmann H. Toyka K.V. Sendtner M. Gold R. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 620-624Google Scholar). To exert its biological functions, CNTF first binds its non-signaling, specific receptor, CNTFR, which has been shown to be required for motor neuron development (8DeChiara T.M. Vejsada R. Poueymirou W.T. Acheson A. Suri C. Conover J.C. Friedman B. McClain J. Pan L. Stahl N. Yanconpoulos G.D. Cell. 1995; 83: 313-322Google Scholar). Signaling through the JAK/signal transducers and activators of transcription pathway follows the recruitment of gp130 and the leukemia inhibitory factor receptor (LIFR) (9Heinrich P.C. Behrmann I. Müller-Newen G. Schaper F. Graeve L. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 297-314Google Scholar, 10Rane S.G. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5662-5679Google Scholar). These receptors are members of the class I hematopoietin receptor family, which is characterized by a cytokine binding domain (CBD) formed from two fibronectin type III (FnIII) modules linked by a proline-rich sequence (11Bazan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Google Scholar). Class I hematopoietin receptors contain four conserved cysteine residues that form inter-strand disulfide bonds in the N-terminal FnIII (BN) module of the CBD and a conserved WSXWS sequence in the C-terminal FnIII (BC) module. CNTFR, gp130, and LIFR have a related modular structure in their extracellular regions (Fig. 1). CNTFR contains an N-terminal immunoglobulin (Ig)-like module and a CBD; gp130 has the same structure but with three membrane-proximal FnIII modules, and LIFR is the same as gp130 but with an additional N-terminal CBD. Of these receptors, only the tertiary structures of the gp130 BC module, the gp130 CBD and the gp130 Ig-CBD domains, have been determined (12Kernebeck T. Pflanz S. Müller-Newen G. Kurapkat G.

The BN and BC modules of the CBD each consist of seven anti-parallel β-strands, which form two β-sheets. Recently, the complete NMR assignments of the BC module of CNTFR have been reported (15Man D. Xia Y. Sze K.H. Smith D.K. He W. Ip N.Y. Zhu G. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 22: 95-96Google Scholar). In vitro, CNTF has been shown to form a hexameric receptor complex composed of two molecules each of CNTF and CNTFR and one molecule each of gp130 and LIFR (16De Serio A. Graziani R. Laufer R. Ciliberto G. Paonessa G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 795-800Google Scholar). The hexameric nature of the related IL-6 signaling complex (17Ward L.D. Howlett G.J. Discolo G. Yasukawa K. Hammacher A.

Simpson R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22701-22707Google Scholar), have been verified recently by crystallographic and biochemical studies (14Chow D. He X. Snow A.L. Rose-John S. Garcia K.C. Science. 2001; 291: 2150-2155Google Scholar, 21Chow D. Ho J. Nguyen Pham T.L. Rose-John S. Garcia K.C. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 7593-7603Google Scholar). Although the crystal structure of CNTF has been solved, revealing a four helix bundle and giving the location of the three sites, which are responsible for the binding of CNTFR, gp130, and LIFR (22McDonald N.Q. Panayotatos N. Hendrickson W.A EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2689-2699Google Scholar, 23Panayotatos N. Radziejewska E. Acheson A. Somogyi R. Thadani A. Hendrickson W.A. McDonald N.Q. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14007-14014Google Scholar), the precise nature of the protein-protein interactions in the CNTF receptor complex remains elusive. In particular, little is known about which domains of the receptors are involved in the interactions in the complex and the nature of the receptor-receptor interactions in the hexameric complex. As the CNTF receptor complex is asymmetric, containing one molecule each of gp130 and LIFR instead of two gp130 molecules as in the IL-6 receptor complex, a tetrameric, rather than hexameric, signaling complex for CNTF is still supported (24Kallen K.J. Grotzinger J. Lelievre E. Vollmer P. Aasland D. Renne C. Mullberg J. Myer zum Buschenfelde K.H. Gascan H. Rose-John S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11859-118670Google Scholar, 25Grotzinger J. Kernebeck T. Kallen K.J. Rose-John S. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 803-813Google Scholar). Here we determine the solution structure of the CNTFR BC domain, the module likely to be involved in receptor-receptor interactions, and we investigate some of the receptor-receptor interactions in the CNTF complex and examine the possibility of ligand free association of receptor molecules. We reported recently (26He W. Gong K. Zhu G. Smith D.K. Ip N.Y. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 214-218Google Scholar) that the LIFR CBD1 could interact with soluble CNTFR in vitro in the absence of CNTF. It was found here that the gp130 CBD could also bind to soluble CNTFR in vitro in the absence of CNTF and compete with the LIFR CBD1 for binding to CNTFR. Residues in the B strand of the BC module of the gp130 CBD and in the putatively similar region of the LIFR CBD1 were shown to be important for the ligand free interaction of gp130 and LIFR with CNTFR. A mutation study of the BC domain of CNTFR also revealed residues important for the interaction with gp130, and NMR methods were used to further map these surfaces. Expression Vectors for the Polyhistidine-tagged and Glutathione S-transferase Fusion Peptides—cDNA templates coding for full-length human CNTFR and rat CNTF were reverse transcriptase-PCR-amplified from mRNAs of NT-2 human embryonal carcinoma cells (Stratagene) and rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, respectively. Human gp130 and LIFR cDNA templates were reverse transcriptase-PCR-amplified from mRNA of SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. DNA sequencing was performed using an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer autosequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). DNA sequences were confirmed with the sequences in the GenBank™ data base. For NMR studies the BC domains of CNTFR (residues 202–305) and of gp130 (residues 219–325) were also amplified by PCR. The bacterial expression vector for His tag proteins was based on a modified pET-14b plasmid (Novagen) as described previously (26He W. Gong K. Zhu G. Smith D.K. Ip N.Y. FEBS Lett. 2002; 514: 214-218Google Scholar). The His-tagged sCNTFR construct was also labeled with a C-terminal c-Myc epitope. The bacterial expression vector for GST fusion proteins was pGEX 6-p-1 (Amersham Biosciences). For the expression of GST fusion proteins, a BamHI site was introduced in the 5′ sense primers, and a NotIor EcoRI (for peptides for NMR studies) site was introduced in the 3′ antisense primers. After amplification, the PCR products were digested with BamHI and NotI or EcoRI restriction enzymes and ligated into the pGEX 6-p-1 vector. Protein Expression, Purification, and Refolding—Escherichia coli bacteria (strain BL21-DE3) were transformed with expression vectors pET-14b and pGEX-6-p-1 containing cDNAs for various peptides. Transformed bacteria were grown to an A600 of ∼0.2 at 37 °C and induced by 1 mm IPTG (isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside) for 4 h. Uniformly, 15N and 15N/13C-labeled CNTFR BC domain peptides were prepared by growing the bacteria in M9 minimal medium using 15NH4Cl (1 g/liter) as the sole nitrogen source or 15NH4Cl (1 g/liter) and 13C6-labeled glucose (1 g/liter) as the sole nitrogen and carbon source, respectively. For the purification of His-tagged proteins, inclusion bodies were denatured in 8 m urea, pH 8.0. After binding to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen), His-tagged peptides were eluted by 8 m urea, pH 4.5. Refolding of sCNTFR was as described previously (27Panayotatos N. Everdeen D. Liten A. Somogyi R. Acheson A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5813-5818Google Scholar), and refolding of other proteins was achieved by dialysis against refolding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm reduced glutathione, 0.1 mm oxidized glutathione, 36 h). Refolded proteins were loaded on a Q-Sepharose High Performance column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a salt gradient using an Akta explorer 100 fast protein liquid chromatography purification system (Amersham Biosciences). For the purification of GST fusion proteins, supernatant of bacterial lysate after sonication was loaded on a glutathione-conjugated Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Biosciences). Bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Eluted proteins were concentrated and further purified using a Q-Sepharose high performance column. For the GST-CNTFR_BC and GST-gp130_BC peptides, the GST tag was cleaved using PreScission protease (Amersham Biosciences), and the peptides were further purified using a GST-Sepharose 4B affinity column and a gel filtration column. The peptides were concentrated by ultrafiltration, and their concentrations were determined by a Coomassie plus protein assay (Pierce) and SDS-PAGE. NMR Spectroscopy—Four NMR samples, with an approximate concentration of 1.0 mm, were prepared for the structure determination of the CNTFR BC domain. These were the unlabeled BC domain in 90% H2O, 10% D2O, 15N-labeled BC domain in 90% H2O, 10% D2O, two 15N/13C-labeled samples, one in 99.9% D2O and one in 90% H2O, 10% D2O. All NMR experiments were performed at 25 °C on Varian Inova 500- and 750-MHz NMR spectrometers equipped with 5-mm inverse z-shielded triple resonance 1H/13C/15N PFG probes. NMR spectra were processed with the nmrPipe software package (28Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Google Scholar) and analyzed with PIPP 2D. S. Garrett, spin.niddk.nih.gov/clore/. and SPARKY. 3T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, www.cgl.ucsf.edu/home/sparky/. Complete 1H, 13C, and 15N resonance assignments were obtained as described earlier (15Man D. Xia Y. Sze K.H. Smith D.K. He W. Ip N.Y. Zhu G. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 22: 95-96Google Scholar). NOE restraints were derived from a three-dimensional 15N-NOESY-HSQC experiment (mixing time 200 ms) recorded in H2O and a three-dimensional 13C-NOESY-HSQC experiment (mixing time 150 ms) recorded in D2O. Amide protons in slow exchange with solvent were identified by a series of 1H-15N HSQC experiments on a lyophilized 15N-labeled sample of the CNTFR BC domain redissolved in D2O buffer. 15N longitudinal relaxation times (T1), 15N spin-lattice relaxation times (T2) and 1H-15N NOE measurements (29Farrow N.A. Muhandiram R. Singer A.U. Pascal S.M. Kay C.M. Gish G. Shoelson S.E. Pawson T. Forman-Kay J.D. Kay L.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5984-6003Google Scholar) were performed at 25 °C on the Varian Inova 500 MHz spectrometer. The relaxation delays, T, for the T1 experiments are as follows: T = 0.011, 0.128, 0.267, 0.533, 0.800, 1.120, 1.440, and 1.867 s; and for the T2 experiments are as follows: T = 14.1, 28.2, 42.3, 56.4, 70.5, 84.6, 98.7, and 112.8 ms. The recycle delays for the T1 and T2 measurements were 2 s. 1H-15N steady-state NOE values were obtained by recording spectra with and without a 3-s 1H saturation period prior to the start of the experiment. The total recycle delays for the NOE measurements, with and without 1H saturation, were 4 and 7 s, respectively. A total of 16 transients was recorded in 15N T1 and T2 experiments and 32 in NOE measurements. All spectra were acquired as 512 × 128 complex data matrices and processed using the nmrPipe software package (28Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Google Scholar) with peak intensities determined as volumes. The 15N relaxation rates and uncertainties were determined from nonlinear least squares fitting of the experimental peak intensities to a monoexponential equation with an offset parameter using the program SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Steady-state NOE values (η) for each of the amide nitrogens were calculated from the peak height in the experiment with saturation (I) and that in the reference experiment without saturation (I0), according to the equation: η = (I – I0)/I0. The T1, T2 relaxation times and NOEs can be expressed in terms of the spectral density function J, which can be modeled using the”model-free“formalism (30Lipari G. Szabo A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 4546-4559Google Scholar, 31Clore M.G. Szabo A. Bax A. Kay L.E. Driscol P.C. Gronenborn A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 4989-4991Google Scholar). Non-linear least squares fitting and Monte Carlo error analysis were performed using the program Modelfree 4.0 (32Palmer A.G. Rance M. Wright P.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 4371-4380Google Scholar, 33Mandel A.M. Akke M. Palmer A.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 246: 144-163Google Scholar). Unlabeled and 15N-labeled samples of the gp130 BC domain at a concentration of 0.8 mm and a pH of 6.5 were prepared for NMR studies. Sequential assignment for the gp130 BC domain was performed using 1H-15N HSQC, 15N-NOESY-HSQC, and 15N-TOCSY-HSQC experiments and with reference to the published assignments (12Kernebeck T. Pflanz S. Müller-Newen G. Kurapkat G. Scheek R.M. Dijkstra K. Heinrich P.C. Wollmer A. Grzesiek S. Grötzinger J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 5-12Google Scholar). Structure Determination—Distance restraints were calibrated directly from NOESY cross-peak intensities by utilizing the weakest and strongest NOESY cross-peaks (calibrated to 5.0 and 1.8 Å, respectively) to calculate intensity-dependent proportionality factors (34Xu R.X. Word J.M Davis D.G. Rink M.J. Willard D.H. Gampe R.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2107-2121Google Scholar). All lower bound restraints were set to 1.8 Å. Raw ambiguous distance restraint lists were generated from NOESY peak lists by interrogating the chemical shift assignments using windows of 0.03 ppm for proton dimensions and 0.3 ppm for 13C and 15N dimensions in the three-dimensional 15N-NOESY-HSQC and three-dimensional 13C-NOESY-HSQC experiments. Ambiguous restraint lists were iteratively filtered against current coordinate ensembles using the ARIA method (35Nilges M. Macias M.M. O'Donoghue S.I. Oschkinat H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 408-422Google Scholar) to generate unambiguous and ambiguous distance restraint lists. The final restraint statistics are listed in Table I. Hydrogen bond distance restraints were included where amide protons were still visible 12 h after the sample was dissolved in D2O. The hydrogen-acceptor distance was restrained between 1.5 and 2.4 Å, and the donor-acceptor distance was restrained between 2.5 and 3.4 Å. Values for 3JNα were estimated from HNHA (36Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Google Scholar) and nJ-HMQC (37Xia Y. Kong X. Ip N. Zhu G. J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 146: 228-231Google Scholar) experiments. Torsion angle restraints for Φ angles of –120° (±50) were imposed for 3JNα ≥ 8 Hz and –60° (±30) for 3JNα ≤ 6 Hz. Structures were calculated using the simulated annealing protocol included in the ARIA package compiled with the CNS program (38Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). An ensemble of the lowest 20 energy structures was retained.Table IStructural statisticsA.

Nonspecific binding was blocked with PBS containing 0.25% BSA. For the binding partner test, 10 μg of the supernatants of IPTG-induced bacterial lysates after sonication were added to the wells. To test the binding capability of different mutants of the gp130 CBD and LIFR CBD1, purified peptides with serial dilutions in PBS, 0.2 μg/μl BSA were applied. After incubation and washing, bound proteins were detected using a goat anti-gp130 or anti-LIFR antibody (R & D Systems) at 1:2000 dilutions followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies with the same dilutions. To assess the ability of the CNTFR BC domain and its mutants to interact with the gp130 BC domain, equal amounts of the purified GST-BC domain of gp130 (100 μg/ml) in PBS were applied. After incubation and washing, bound proteins were detected with GST antibodies at 1:10,000 dilutions followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies at 1:4000 dilutions. Peroxidase activity was detected by o-phenylenediamine substrate, and the orange colored product was read at 490 nm using an MR5000 microplate reader (Dynatech). Immunoprecipitation, GST Pull-down Assay, and Western Blotting— Two hundred ng of purified gp130 CBD was incubated with 200 ng of purified His-sCNTFR-myc, 1 μg of anti-Myc antibody, and 10 μg of BSA in 200 μl of PBS overnight at 4 °C. Ten μl of κ-lock (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) beads were then added and incubated for 2 h. Purified GST fusion peptides were incubated with purified His-sCNTFR-myc with serial dilutions in 200 μl of PBS with 20 μg of BSA and 10 μl of glutathione-conjugated Sepharose 4B beads overnight at 4 °C. In both cases, beads were washed with PBS, and 20 μl of 2× sample buffer for SDS-PAGE was added. The boiled supernatants were collected, separated by SDS-PAGE, and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking in TBST containing 5% milk powder, membranes were incubated with antibodies (1:1000) specific for CNTFR, gp130, or LIFR at 4 °C overnight. Membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies with 1:2000 dilutions for 1 h at room temperature after washing with TBST. Proteins were detected by chemiluminescence using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's instructions. Alanine Scanning and Site-directed Mutagenesis—Standard PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis procedures were performed for the alanine scanning of the AB loop and B strand in the BC module of the gp130 CBD and the LIFR CBD1 and the mutagenesis of the CNTFR BC domain. gp130 is numbered from the mature peptide, although LIFR and CNTFR are numbered from the signal peptide. The gp130 CBD mutants with amino acids substituted by alanine are as follows: S211A/E212A, E213A/L214A, S215A/S216A, I217A/L218A, K219A/L220A, T221A/W222A, K219A, and L220A. The LIFR CBD1 mutants with alanine substitutions are as follows: D147A/F148A, S149A/T150A, S151A/T152A, L153A/Y154A, and L155A/K156A. CNTFR mutants with alanine substitution of Glu223, Thr225, His256, Glu258, Thr263, Thr266, Thr268, Thr269, Glu286, and Thr268/Asp269 were constructed. Other CNTFR mutants were E223K, H256E, H256E/E258A, D284K, E286H, E286K, and D284K/E286K. The DNA sequences of all the mutant constructs were verified using an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer. All mutants were subsequently expressed as His tag or GST fusion proteins and purified as described above when necessary. Structure Determination and Backbone Dynamics—The three-dimensional structure of the BC domain of the CNTF α-receptor in aqueous solution at pH 6.5 and 25 °C was determined by NMR methods. Data were recorded on unlabeled, 15N-labeled, and 15N/13C-labeled samples, and the chemical shift assignments of the CNTFR BC domain are described elsewhere (15Man D. Xia Y. Sze K.H. Smith D.K. He W. Ip N.Y. Zhu G. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 22: 95-96Google Scholar). Following identification of the global-fold from manual inspection of the nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) data, ambiguous NOE restraints were resolved using the iterative ARIA method (35Nilges M. Macias M.M. O'Donoghue S.I. Oschkinat H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 408-422Google Scholar), and the structure was determined by simulated annealing using the CNS package (38Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). The final ensemble of the lowest 20 energy structures of the CNTFR BC domain is shown in Fig. 2A, and in Fig. 2B a ribbon diagram representation of the average structure, in the same orientation, shows the fibronectin type III domain-like topology of seven β-strands in two anti-parallel β-sheets formed by these domains. The first β-sheet consists of three strands: A (Glu208–Pro214), B (Leu222–Gln227), and E (Ala264–Ile267), and the second β-sheet is composed of four strands: C (Lys241–Pro248), C′ (Val257–Leu259), F (Tyr276–Lys283), and G (Val295–Ala299). The WSXWS sequence that is characteristic of the class I cytokine receptors (11Bazan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6934-6938Google Scholar) is located in the C-terminal part of the FG loop (Trp290–Ser294 in the CNTFR BC domain) and runs roughly antiparallel to the F strand (Fig. 2B). In many of the class 1 cytokine receptors a third tryptophan (Trp254 in CNTFR) extends the WSXWS motif, forming a ladder of parallel tryptophan side chains. Charged or polar residues from the F and C strands are inserted between the tryptophan residues, forming a charged band on the surface of the domain. In the majority of these receptors a highly conserved arginine residue occupies the space between the side chains of the tryptophans of the WSXWS motif. In the cases of CNTFR and IL-11R, this arginine residue is replaced by alanine (Ala281) and serine, respectively. As a consequence the side chain of Trp290 in CNTFR is not parallel to the other tryptophan residues but roughly perpendicular to them, occupying the space where the arginine side chain is found in other receptors and interacting with Phe243. The number of restraints used in the structure determination and the structural statistics are summarized in Table I. The ensemble of structures (Fig. 2A) were superimposed using the residues in the β-sheet elements (except the C′ strand), and the r.m.s.d. of the ensemble N, Cα, and C′ atoms of the residues from the mean coordinates are given in Fig. 3A. For the well defined residues (those with r.m.s.d. values within 2σ of the mean value in the global superposition of the ensemble) the r.m.s.d. of the N, Cα, and C′ atoms from those of the average structure was 0.37 ± 0.04 Å. Fig. 3B shows the numbers of inter-residue NOEs per residue that were used in the structure calculation. Of the 20 low energy structures in the ensemble, 7 had no residues in the generously allowed or disallowed regions (39Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar) of the Ramachandran plot, and the maximum number of residues in these regions in any one structure was 3. The backbone dynamics of the BC domain of CNTFR were studied by measuring the 15N, T1, and T2 relaxation times and the 1H-15N steady-state NOE values at 25 °C on the Varian Inova 500 MHz spectrometer.

https://openalex.org/W2010757014,"The endogenous ligand of guanylyl cyclase C, guanylin, is produced as the 94-amino-acid prohormone proguanylin, with the hormone guanylin located at the COOH terminus of the prohormone. The solution structure of proguanylin adopts a new protein fold and consists of a three-helix bundle, a small three-stranded β-sheet of two NH2-terminal strands and one COOH-terminal strand, and an unstructured linker region. The sequence corresponding to guanylin is fixed in its bioactive topology and is involved in interactions with the NH2-terminal β-hairpin: the hormone region (residues 80–94) partly wraps around the first 4 NH2-terminal residues that thereby shield parts of the hormone surface. These interactions provide an explanation for the negligible bioactivity of the prohormone as well as the important role of the NH2-terminal residues in the disulfide-coupled folding of proguanylin. Since the ligand binding region of guanylyl cyclase C is predicted to be located around an exposed β-strand, the intramolecular interactions observed between guanylin and its prosequence may be comparable with the guanylin/receptor interaction.

Activation of intestinal guanylyl cyclase C (GC-C) 1The abbreviations used are: GC-C, guanylyl cyclase C; GC-CECD, extracellular ligand binding domain of GC-C; PDB, Protein Data Bank; TOCSY, total correlation spectroscopy; NOE, nuclear Overhauser effect, also used for NOESY cross peak; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser spectroscopy; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; HMQC, heteronuclear multiple quantum correlation spectroscopy; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. results in an increased level of intracellular cGMP. Subsequent activation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator leads to increased secretion of fluid and electrolytes into the intestinal lumen. The first identified intestinal peptide hormone regulating GC-C activity and thus electrolyte and fluid secretion in the intestine is termed guanylin (1Currie M.G. Fok K.F. Kato J. Moore R.J. Hamra F.K. Duffin K.L. Smith C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 947-951Google Scholar, 2Forte L.R. Regul. Pept. 1999; 81: 25-39Google Scholar). In circulation, unlike other regulatory peptides, guanylin predominantly occurs as the corresponding 94-amino-acid prohormone, with the hormone located at its very COOH terminus (3Kuhn M. Raida M. Adermann K. Schulz-Knappe P. Gerzer R. Heim J.M. Forssmann W.G. FEBS Lett. 1993; 318: 205-209Google Scholar). Human proguanylin exhibits only negligible GC-C-activating potency (4Schulz A. Marx U.C. Hidaka Y. Shimonishi Y. Rösch P. Forssmann W.G. Adermann K. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1850-1859Google Scholar), and the in vivo active hormone is thought to be the 15-residue fragment proguanylin (residues 80–94) as originally isolated. This fragment would be released from the prohormone by cleavage of the Asp-79–Pro-80 bond (4Schulz A. Marx U.C. Hidaka Y. Shimonishi Y. Rösch P. Forssmann W.G. Adermann K. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1850-1859Google Scholar). This cleavage, however, also occurs under conditions applied during the original isolation procedure (1Currie M.G. Fok K.F. Kato J. Moore R.J. Hamra F.K. Duffin K.L. Smith C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 947-951Google Scholar, 4Schulz A. Marx U.C. Hidaka Y. Shimonishi Y. Rösch P. Forssmann W.G. Adermann K. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1850-1859Google Scholar), and it is thus still unclear whether Asp-79–Pro-80 is the relevant in vivo processing site. For its biological activity, i.e. GC-C binding and activation, the hormone requires its two disulfide bonds to be connected in a 1–3/2–4 pattern (5Klodt J. Kuhn M. Marx U.C. Martin S. Rosch P. Forssmann W.G. Adermann K. J. Pept. Res. 1997; 50: 222-230Google Scholar). This unique cysteine connectivity, however, allows formation of two interconvertable topological stereoisomers (6Skelton N.J. Garcia K.C. Goeddel D.V. Quan C. Burnier J.P. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13581-13592Google Scholar), with only one of them (A-form) showing biological activity (7Schulz A. Escher S. Marx U.C. Meyer M. Rösch P. Forssmann W.G. Adermann K. J. Pept. Res. 1998; 52: 518-525Google Scholar). It has been shown that the prohormone sequence is essential for the disulfide-coupled folding of the hormone (4Schulz A. Marx U.C. Hidaka Y. Shimonishi Y. Rösch P. Forssmann W.G. Adermann K. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1850-1859Google Scholar) since oxidative folding of reduced fragment proguanylin (residues 80–94) almost completely results in the formation of two inactive disulfide isomers. This crucial role of the hormone prosequence for proper folding was also demonstrated for the closely related uroguanylin prohormone (8Hidaka Y. Ohno M. Hemmasi B. Hill O. Forssmann W.G. Shimonishi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 8498-8507Google Scholar, 9Hidaka Y. Shimono C. Ohno M. Okumura N. Adermann K. Forssmann W.G. Shimonishi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25155-25162Google Scholar). Unfortunately, only little structural information on prohormones in general is available, and apart from different miniproinsulin mutants, no three-dimensional structure of any prohormone has been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) yet. Thus, the crucial questions are still open: What is the overall topology of the prohormone? Does the hormone part of proguanylin (residues 80–94) show structural features comparable with those of the active hormone, i.e. is its topological isomerism already present in proguanylin? How can the negligible GC-C-activating potency of the prohormone be explained? Why are the NH2-terminal residues important for disulfide-coupled folding? Also, is the proposed processing site to release the hormone exposed to allow attack of a putative proteinase? In this study, we report the solution structure of proguanylin. In addition, by comparison of the intramolecular interactions found within the proguanylin structure with the proposed ligand binding region of the extracellular domain of the guanylin receptor GC-C, we suggest a mechanism of the guanylin/GC-C interaction. Sample Preparation—Recombinant proguanylin was expressed as thioredoxin fusion protein in Escherichia coli AD494 (DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI) and purified as described (10Lauber T. Nourse A. Schulz A. Marx U.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14602-14612Google Scholar). For uniform (>95%) 15N and 13C/15N labeling, recombinant proguanylin was isolated and purified from E. coli cultures grown in M9 minimal medium enriched with 15NH4Cl or 15NH4Cl/13C-glucose using the same purification protocol. As the expression strain lacks the capability to synthesize leucine, 15N-labeled leucine was added to the medium according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen). For NMR sample preparation, freeze-dried protein was dissolved to final concentrations of 0.8–1.1 mm in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer containing 10% D2O (v/v), pH 6.0, or phosphate-buffered D2O (99.994%), pH 6.0. NMR Spectroscopy—All NMR experiments were performed at either 293 or 298 K on Bruker Avance400 or DRX600 NMR spectrometers (Bruker, Karlsrue, Germany) equipped with inverse 1H/13C/15N(/31P) triple or quadruple resonance probes with pulsed-field gradient capabilities except for the 13C-NOESY-HSQC, which was recorded on a Bruker Avance800 NMR spectrometer (Bruker, Zürich, Switzerland) equipped with an inverse 1H/13C/15N triple resonance cryoprobe with pulsed-field gradient capabilities. In addition to the homonuclear 1H two-dimensional COSY, TOCSY, and NOESY spectra of 2.4 mm natural proguanylin in 0.5 ml of H2O/D2O (9:1, v/v, pH 4.0) or D2O recorded previously (4Schulz A. Marx U.C.

Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1850-1859Google Scholar), another two-dimensional NOESY spectrum (150-ms mixing time) of natural proguanylin was recorded at 293 K in 0.5 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate (containing 10% D2O, v/v, pH 6.0), the buffer conditions that were also used for the following heteronuclear two-dimensional and three-dimensional NMR experiments performed on samples of uniformly 15N- or 13C/15N-labeled recombinant proguanylin: 15N-HSQC (11Mori S.

Reson., Series B. 1996; 112: 200-205Google Scholar) (120-ms mixing time), 13C-NOESY-HSQC (25Ikura M. Kay L.E. Tschudin R. Bax A. J. Magn.

Reson. 1990; 90: 420-425Google Scholar, 27Ikura M. Bax A. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1990; 112: 9020-9022Google Scholar) (150-ms mixing time). Side chain 1H resonance assignments of the 8 leucine residues were obtained exclusively from the 15N-edited spectra; a 13C/15N F2-filtered two-dimensional NOESY spectrum (28Zwahlen C. Legault P. Vincent S.J.F. Greenblatt J. Konrat R. Kay L.E. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1997; 119: 6711-6721Google Scholar) (150-ms mixing time) provided additional NOESY data for these residues. Slowly exchanging amide protons were identified from a series of 15N-HSQC spectra every 30 min after dissolving freeze-dried uniformly 15N-labeled proguanylin in D2O. Amide protons still detectable after 150 min were assumed to be involved in hydrogen bonding. DNH residual dipolar couplings were obtained from the observed doublet splitting of uniformly 15N-labeled proguanylin weakly aligned by addition of 21 mg/ml Pf1 filamentous phages (29Hansen M.R. Mueller L. Pardi A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1065-1074Google Scholar) in in-phase/antiphase spectra (30Ottiger M. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 131: 373-378Google Scholar) by subtracting the 1JNH scalar coupling contribution as observed in reference spectra of the unaligned sample. {1H}15N NOE values were measured using the pulse sequence of Dayie and Wagner (31Dayie K.T. Wagner G. J. Magn. Reson., Series A. 1994; 111: 121-126Google Scholar) with a relaxation delay of 6 s; the evolution time increments in the indirect dimension of the spectra with and without proton saturation by applying a train of 120° high power pulses for the final 3 s of the relaxation delay were recorded alternately in a single combined experiment. Both DNH residual dipolar couplings and {1H}15N NOE values were averaged over two independent data sets. The H2O resonance was suppressed with excitation sculpting (32Hwang T.L. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Reson., Series A. 1995; 112: 275-279Google Scholar), a binomial 3-9-19 WATERGATE sequence (33Sklenar V. Piotto M. Leppik R. Saudek V. J. Magn.

Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Google Scholar), and gradient coherence selection (35Schleucher J. Schwendinger M.G. Sattler M. Schmidt P. Schedletzky O. Glaser S.J. Sørensen O.W. Griesinger C. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 301-306Google Scholar) in the homonuclear 1H experiments, the amide-detected experiments except for the 15N-TOCSY-HSQC, and the remaining experiments, respectively. Quadrature detection in the indirectly detected dimensions was obtained by the States-TPPI method (36States D.J. Haberkorn R.A. Ruben D.J. J. Magn. Reson. 1982; 48: 286-292Google Scholar, 37Marion D. Ikura M. Tschudin R. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1989; 85: 393-399Google Scholar) or by the echo-antiecho method (38Kay L.E. Keifer P. Saarinen T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 10663-10665Google Scholar) if coherence selection with gradients was employed (35Schleucher J. Schwendinger M.G. Sattler M. Schmidt P. Schedletzky O. Glaser S.J. Sørensen O.W. Griesinger C. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 301-306Google Scholar, 39Sattler M. Schwendinger M.G. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 11-22Google Scholar). Carbon pulses were typically applied as band-selective rectangular, BURP (40Geen H. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 93: 93-141Google Scholar), or Gaussian cascade (41Emsley L. Bodenhausen G. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1990; 165: 469-476Google Scholar) pulses for discriminating aliphatic and carbonyl resonances (42Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1999; 34: 93-158Google Scholar). WALTZ-16 (43Shaka A.J. Keeler J. Frenkiel T. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 52: 335-338Google Scholar), GARP (44Shaka A. Barker P.B. Freeman R. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 64: 547-552Google Scholar), and MLEV-4 expanded off-resonant Gaussian pulse cascades (45Eggenberger U. Schmidt P. Sattler M. Glaser S.J. Griesinger C. J. Magn. Reson. 1992; 100: 604-610Google Scholar) were employed for broadband 1H, broadband 13C or 15N, and band-selective 13C heteronuclear decoupling, respectively. Multidimensional NMR data were extrapolated to up to twice the acquisition time by linear prediction in one of the 13C or 15N indirect dimensions, apodized by multiplication with squared sine bells shifted by 60–90°, and extended to at least twice the length by zero-filling in all dimensions prior to Fourier transformation. The baseline in the direct dimension was corrected using a model-free algorithm (46Friedrich M.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 5: 147-153Google Scholar). The NMR data were processed using in-house written software (47.Schweimer, K. (2000) Mehrdimensionale NMR Spektoskopie zur Bestimmung der Strukturen des Birkenpollenallergens Bet v 1, des Guillardia theta Rubredoxins und des [2Fe-2S] Ferredoxins aus Halobakterium salinarium. Doctoral Dissertation, University of Bayreuth, Bayreuth, GermanyGoogle Scholar) and analyzed with the program packages NMR-View (48Johnson B.A. Blevins R.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Google Scholar) and NDEE (SpinUp Inc., Dortmund, Germany). 1H chemical shifts were referenced with respect to external 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid in D2O, and 13C and 15N chemical shifts were referenced indirectly (49Markley J.L. Bax A. Arata Y. Hilbers C.W. Kaptein R. Sykes B.D. Wright P.E. Wüthrich K. Pure Appl. Chem. 1998; 70: 117-142Google Scholar). Structure Calculation—Distance restraints for structure calculation were taken from the 15N-NOESY-HSQC spectrum for NOEs involving amide protons and from the 13C-NOESY-HSQC spectrum and homonuclear NOESY spectra for NOEs between aliphatic and aromatic protons. 3J(HN,Hα) coupling constants were calculated from cross-peak to diagonal peak intensity ratios in the HNHA spectrum and corrected by a factor of 1.05 to account for the different relaxation rates of the in-phase and the antiphase component (12Vuister G.W. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 7772-7777Google Scholar), as well as from line-shape analysis of the antiphase cross-signal splitting in a high digital resolution double quantum filtered (DQF)-COSY spectrum using a Lorentzian function for peak fitting. The non-trivial unambiguous NOESY cross-peaks used for structure calculation were classified manually according to the relative intensities and converted into upper distance constraints: strong, 2.7 Å; medium, 3.5 Å; and weak, 5.0 Å. 3J(HN,Hα) coupling constants were converted into ϕ-angles according to the Karplus equation as described (50Neudecker P. Schweimer K. Nerkamp J. Scheurer S. Vieths S. Sticht H. Rösch P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22756-22763Google Scholar). All 11 proline residues were considered to have trans conformation as evidenced by characteristic Cβ and Cγ chemical shifts (51Hill J.M. Alewood P.F. Craik D.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8824-8835Google Scholar), unambiguous Hα(i) Pro-Hδ(i+1) NOE signals in the 13C-NOESY-HSQC, and two-dimensional NOESY spectra and the fact that Hα(i) Pro-Hα(i+1) and HN(i) Pro-Hα(i+1) connectivities were absent (52Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 122-125Google Scholar). Disulfide bonds were taken into account by one NOE distance restraint dSS = 2.02 ± 0.10 Å) for each disulfide bond. Hydrogen bonds were selected as described (50Neudecker P. Schweimer K. Nerkamp J. Scheurer S. Vieths S. Sticht H. Rösch P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22756-22763Google Scholar, 53Schweimer K. Hoffmann S. Bauer F. Friedrich U. Kardinal C. Feller S.M. Biesinger B. Sticht H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5120-5130Google Scholar) and introduced into the calculation by two distance restraints each (54Kraulis J. Clore G.M. Nilges M. Jones T.A. Pettersson G. Knowles J. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7241-7257Google Scholar). Structures were calculated with X-PLOR 3.851 (50Neudecker P. Schweimer K. Nerkamp J. Scheurer S. Vieths S. Sticht H. Rösch P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22756-22763Google Scholar, 55Brünger A.T. X-PLOR, Version 3.1, a system for X-ray crystallography and NMR. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar) using a three-stage simulated annealing protocol (56Nilges M. Proteins. 1993; 17: 297-309Google Scholar) with floating assignment of prochiral groups (57Folmer R.H. Hilbers C.W. Konings R.N. Nilges M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 245-258Google Scholar). To improve the stereochemical quality of the structures, a modified conformational data base potential for backbone and side chain dihedral angles was used (58Kuszewski J. Clore G.M. J. Magn. Reson. 2000; 146: 249-254Google Scholar, 59Neudecker P. Sticht H. Rösch P. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 21: 373-375Google Scholar). The simulated annealing was followed by 1200 steps of energy minimization, with the final 1000 steps without conformational data base potential. Ambiguities in the NOE cross-peak assignments were solved in an iterative approach using several rounds of structure calculations with subsequent distance analysis. Dihedral angle and hydrogen bond constraints were introduced in later rounds of the structure calculation. Of the 120 structures resulting from the final round of structure calculation, the 40 structures with the lowest overall energies and experimental restraint violations were selected for refinement using additional restraints from residual dipolar couplings: a previously described grid search procedure (53Schweimer K. Hoffmann S. Bauer F. Friedrich U. Kardinal C. Feller S.M. Biesinger B. Sticht H. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 5120-5130Google Scholar) was applied to obtain the axial component and rhombicity of the alignment tensor using the tensor components of the structures calculated without residual dipolar couplings as starting values. The selected structures were refined using the value of the alignment tensor with the best agreement between measured and calculated residual dipolar couplings. Refinement comprised simulated annealing with a harmonic X-PLOR potential energy term for the dipolar couplings included in the target function of the simulated annealing protocol during the cooling stages. The force constant of the alignment tensor was increased gradually from 0.01 to 1.0 kcal mol–1 Hz–2. After refinement, the 30 structures with the lowest overall energies and restraint violations were used for further characterization. The geometry of the structures as well as elements of secondary structure were analyzed using PROCHECK (60Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar) and MOLMOL (61Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 29-32Google Scholar). MOLMOL (61Koradi R. Billeter M. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 29-32Google Scholar) was used for visualization of the structure data. Data Bank Accession Numbers—The coordinates and NMR restraints have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB accession number: 1o8r), and chemical shift values and coupling constants have been deposited in the BioMagResBank (accession number: 5603). Structure Determination—Based on an almost complete sequence-specific assignment of the backbone (Fig. 1) as well as the side chain resonances of recombinant proguanylin (only the spin system of Leu-47 could not be assigned due to severe spectral overlap), a total of 700 experimental restraints were derived from the NMR spectra. All distance restraints are intramolecular, as natural (i.e. proguanylin isolated from human blood ultrafiltrate) as well as recombinant proguanylin are monomeric in solution at concentrations used for the NMR experiments (10Lauber T. Nourse A. Schulz A. Marx U.C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14602-14612Google Scholar). The experimental restraints consist of 591 distance constraints that were derived from the NOE data in an iterative manner, 30 dihedral angle constraints, 24 hydrogen bonds, and 55 residual dipolar couplings (Table I). 457 NOEs detected in the 15N-NOESY-HSQC could be used as distance restraints, and 65 distance restraints could be obtained from the 13C-NOESY-HSQC spectrum. Additional experimental restraints were derived from the two-dimensional NOESY and COSY spectra of natural proguanylin, providing 69 non-redundant NOEs and 11 3J(HN,Hα) coupling constants. These restraints were particularly valuable, as they mainly involved long range interactions between aromatic and/or aliphatic side chains that form a hydrophobic core. From the family of 120 structures of the final round of calculations, the 40 structures with the lowest overall energies were chosen for refinement using 55 additional restraints from residual dipolar couplings. Inclusion of these additional restraints increased the precision of the 30 lowest energy structures: the r.m.s.d. of the backbone heavy atoms of elements with regular secondary structure decreased from 0.43 to 0.40 Å. The r.m.s.d. between the average structures of both calculations is 0.59 Å, showing that the orientation of the N-H vectors agree with the overall backbone topology derived from conventional NMR data. From the 40 structures used for refinement, the 30 lowest energy structures were chosen to represent the solution conformation of proguanylin (Fig. 2). These structures show only small deviations in overall energies and r.m.s.d. values from ideal geometry (Table I). This is also confirmed by the PROCHECK analysis (60Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar), showing favorable backbone conformations for almost all residues of the 30 structures with 80.5% of the non-glycine and non-proline residues in the most favored regions and 18.5% in additional allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The structures show no distance violations greater than 0.13 Å and no dihedral angle restraint violations greater than 5°.Table ISummary of structure calculationExperimental restraints for final structure calculationInterresidual NOEs547Sequential (|i — j| = 1)257Medium range (|i — j| ≤ 5)154Long range (|i — j| > 5)136Intraresidual NOEs44Dihedral angle restraints From 3J(αH,NH)30Hydrogen bonds24Restraints from dipolar couplings55Molecular dynamics statisticsAverage energy (kcal/mol)Etot183.69 (± 5.98)Ebond5.32 (± 0.23)Eangles141.46 (± 2.22)Eimproper14.05 (± 0.56)Erepel12.49 (± 2.67)ENOE4.39 (± 1.19)Ecdih0.14 (± 0.097)Edipo5.84 (± 1.31)r.m.s.d. from ideal distances (Å)NOE0.012 (± 0.0015)Bonds0.0048 (± 0.00039)r.m.s.d. from ideal angles (deg)Bond angles1.20 (± 0.22)Improper angles0.45 (± 0.0057)r.m.s.d. from dipolar couplings (Hz)H-N couplings0.65 (± 0.31)Atomic r.m.s.d. differences from the average structureBackboneHeavy atomsÅÅOverallaCalculated for the final set of 30 structures (residues 1-94).-1.271.89Residues 1-21, 46-940.691.14Regular secondary structurebCalculated for the final set of 30 structures (residues 2-4, 9-10, 12-17, 54-62, 66-78, 91-92).0.400.90SARDCvs. SAnoRDCcSARDC, average structure of the final 30 structures calculated with dipolar couplings; SAnoRDC, average structure of 30 structures calculated without dipolar couplings (calculated for residues 1-21, 46-94).

Open table in a new tab The best fit backbone superposition of the 30 lowest overall energy structures of proguanylin (Fig. 2) shows a globularly folded protein with well defined elements of regular secondary structure. The r.m.s.d. of the converging structures is 1.27 Å for the backbone heavy atoms and 1.89 Å for all heavy atoms. Omission of the unstructured central linker sequence (residues 22–45) results in lower r.m.s.d. values of 0.69 and 1.14 Å, and elements of regular secondary structure show r.m.s.d. values of 0.40 and 0.90 Å, respectively (Table I). Description of the Proguanylin Structure—The solution structure of proguanylin consists of a three-helix bundle and a small triple-stranded antiparallel β-sheet of two strands at the NH2 terminus (Thr-2 to Gln-4, Ser-9 to Phe-10) and one strand at the very COOH terminus (Cys-91 to Thr-92; Figs. 2 and 5A). The relative orientation of these structural elements is fixed by a hydrophobic core (Phe-10, Val-15, Leu-18, Phe-53, Leu-57, Leu-60, and Leu-73) whose rigidity is reflected by a high number of long range NOEs (Figs. 2 and 3B). Three regular α-helices (Leu-12 to Lys-17, Leu-57 to Lys-62, Ala-66 to Glu-78) are evidenced by several αN(i, i+4) NOEs with helix 2 preceded by a short 310-helix turn from Pro-54 to Glu-56.Fig. 3Atomic r.m.s.d. from the average structure (A), distribution of NOEs (B), and {1H}15N NOE values (C). The r.m.s.d. values for the backbone and all heavy atoms are displayed as filled and open circles, respectively. The average structure of proguanylin was calculated for elements of regular secondary structure (residues 2–4, 9–10, 12–17, 54–62, 66–78, 91–92). Intraresidual (black), sequential (medium gray), medium range (dark gray), and long range (light gray) NOEs are displayed as vertical stacked bars.{1H}15N NOE values at 600 MHz are displayed as vertical bars with error bars on top.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The linker region (Gln-22 to Pro-45) connecting the first two helices is less well defined (Fig. 2), as evidenced by high local r.m.s.d. values (Fig. 3A), a relatively low number of detectable NOEs (Fig. 3B), and a rapid solvent exchange of the amide protons. The values of the {1H}15N heteronuclear NOEs for the amide protons of Gln-22 to Val-44 are all smaller than 0.6 with the lowest value of 0.08 for Ile-38, clearly indicating a significantly increased inherent flexibility of the N-H vectors on a picoto nanosecond time scale (Fig. 3C) (62Kay L.E. Torchia D.A. Bax A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 8972-8979Google Scholar). The roles of the prosequences for the disulfide-coupled folding and biological activity of the related peptide hormones guanylin and uroguanylin have been investigated previously (4Schulz A.

https://openalex.org/W2071434293,"In vitro formation of Hydrogenobacter thermophilus cytochrome c552 has previously been demonstrated (Daltrop, O., Allen, J. W. A., Willis, A. C., and Ferguson, S. J. (2002) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 99, 7872–7876). Now we report that the single cysteine variants of H. thermophilus c552, which bind heme via a single thioether bond, also form in vitro. Furthermore, reaction of the apocytochromes containing either AXXCH or CXXAH in the binding motif with 2-vinyldeuteroheme and 4-vinyldeuteroheme resulted predominantly in covalent attachment between Cys-11 and the 2-vinyl moiety and Cys-14 and the 4-vinyl functionality. This observation shows that the covalent attachment of heme to apocytochrome is stereoselective, indicating that the initial non-covalent complexes between apoprotein and heme have to be in the correct stereochemical orientation for preferential promotion of thioether bond formation. Additionally, the heme derivatives 2-vinyldeuteroheme and 4-vinyldeuteroheme were reacted with wild-type H. thermophilus c552 to yield another modification of cytochromes containing only one thioether bond. These results show that the formation of the two thioether bonds in typical c-type cytochromes can occur independently from one another. Aspects of rotational isomerism of heme in heme-proteins are discussed. In vitro formation of Hydrogenobacter thermophilus cytochrome c552 has previously been demonstrated (Daltrop, O., Allen, J. W.

Aspects of rotational isomerism of heme in heme-proteins are discussed. c-type cytochromes are found in almost all organisms and are mainly involved in electron transport. They contain at least one characteristic CXXCH motif, whereby the conserved cysteine residues are involved in forming a covalent thioether bond between the thiol functionalities and the vinyl groups of the prosthetic heme group (1Daltrop O.

The structure of heme and its derivatives mesoheme and deuteroheme are given in Fig. 1. Cytochrome c maturation in cells is a catalyzed process and involves complex protein systems in bacteria (6Page M.D. Sambongi Y. Ferguson S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 103-108Google Scholar), but a single heme lyase protein in mitochondria from some cells (7Kranz R. Lill R. Goldman B. Bonnard G. Merchant S. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 29: 383-396Google Scholar). In our previous work (1Daltrop O. Allen J.W. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7872-7876Google Scholar), we reported the first in vitro formation of a c-type cytochrome containing two thioether bonds. Cytochromes containing only one thioether bond are rare (5Barker P.D. Ferguson S.J. Structure. 1999; 7: R281-R290Google Scholar). However, engineered variants of the CXXCH binding motif, replacing one cysteine with an alanine residue by site-directed mutagenesis, for a bacterial cytochrome c (8Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32530-32534Google Scholar) and for mitochondrial yeast iso-1-cytochrome c (9Rosell F.I. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7811-7818Google Scholar) have aided the understanding of this class of proteins and the requirement for covalent attachment of the prosthetic group to the polypeptide. In this work we report the in vitro formation of heme-attached AXXCH and CXXAH variants of Hydrogenobacter thermophilus c552 from the corresponding apocytochrome and heme. Furthermore, we study the reaction of the apocytochromes with the heme derivatives 2-vinyldeuteroheme (2-VDH) 1The abbreviations used are: 2-VDH, 2-vinyldeuteroheme; 4-VDH, 4-vinyldeuteroheme. and 4-vinyldeuteroheme (4-VDH). The latter two molecules are thus hybrids between heme and deuteroheme (Fig. 1). Wild-type, C11A, and C14A variants of H. thermophilus c552 were expressed and purified as previously described (8Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32530-32534Google Scholar, 10Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5156-5160Google Scholar). Apocytochromes c were prepared analogously to the method of Fisher et al. (11Fisher W.R. Taniuchi H. Anfinsen C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 3188-3195Google Scholar). After the removal of the Ag+ by addition of dithiothreitol, the proteins were dialyzed extensively in sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0, 20 mm). SDS-PAGE analysis was carried out using the buffer system described by Laemmli (12Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar); heme activity staining was achieved by the method of Goodhew et al. (13Goodhew C.F. Brown K.R. Pettigrew G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 852: 288-294Google Scholar). The concentration of apocytochrome was determined using the extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 15.2 mm–1 cm–1 (calculated using the protein sequence) for wild-type and both single cysteine mutants (C11A and C14A) of H. thermophilus c552. Heme derivatives were synthesized as described previously (14Smith K.M. Fujinari E.M. Langry K.C. Parish D.W. Tabba H.D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 6638-6646Google Scholar). For the heme nomenclature the Fischer system of nomenclature is used. H. thermophilus apocytochrome c552 wild-type, C11A, and C14A variants (5 μm) were incubated with heme and derivatives thereof (5 μm) in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 25 °C. Samples were reduced by the addition of both disodium dithionite and dithiothreitol to a final concentration of 5 mm. Solutions were thoroughly sparged with humidified argon, and reactions were carried out in the dark. Apocytochrome Production and Characterization—C11A and C14A variants of H. thermophilus cytochrome c552 were shown to be pure by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2, lanes a). The apocytochromes were shown to be devoid of heme as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis using heme staining procedures (Fig. 2, lanes b), whereas the presence of protein was shown by staining the gels with Coomassie Blue after the heme staining had been carried out. The absence of characteristics of cytochrome in the visible spectra and the disappearance of the cytochrome c fold as shown by CD analysis (data not shown) were also indicative of the removal of the covalently bound heme from the protein. In Vitro Thioether Bond Formation with Heme—Mixing either C11A or C14A variants of H. thermophilus apocytochrome c552 with ferrous (Fe(II)) heme in the presence of dithionite at pH 7.0 resulted in an increase in absorption around 424 nm relative to that of heme alone; the same trend was observed around 528 and 559 nm, bands characteristic of the presence of a reduced cytochrome (Fig. 3 for the C11A variant). The pyridine hemochrome spectrum of this mixture had its α-band at 556 nm, indicating that the heme contained two unreacted vinyl groups. These results show that the apoprotein and heme initially form a b-type cytochrome, in which the heme is not covalently attached to the peptide but in which its iron atom is coordinated by two amino acid side chains from the protein. This intermediate formed quantitatively to yield a 1:1 heme-protein complex for the C11A protein. In the case of the C14A protein, a fraction of the apoprotein (up to 40%) was unable to bind heme for unknown reasons. These results are consistent with previous observations on the wild-type protein and the AXXAH mutant, which were both shown to form a b-type cytochrome initially (1Daltrop O. Allen J.W. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7872-7876Google Scholar, 10Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5156-5160Google Scholar). Following formation of the b-type cytochrome from the mixture of C11A or C14A variants of H. thermophilus cytochrome c552 with heme in reducing conditions, the maximum at 560 nm in the protein absorption spectrum progressively shifted to either 556 or 557 nm, respectively (Fig. 3 shows the spectrum for the C11A variant). After 15 h, the pyridine hemochrome spectrum of the purified reduced protein had a resolved band at 553 nm, characteristic of a reaction with one vinyl group of the heme (3Moore G.R. Pettigrew G.W. Cytochromes c: Evolutionary, Structural, and Physicochemical Aspects. Springer-Verlag, New York1990Google Scholar, 8Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32530-32534Google Scholar). These observations decisively indicate the formation of a thioether bond between heme and polypeptide, an interpretation that was further substantiated by heme staining of the proteins on SDS-PAGE gels (Fig. 2, lanes d), including first treating the heme-containing protein with acidified acetone. In the latter procedure, non-covalently bound heme dissociates from protein but covalently bound heme does not. The visible absorption spectra of the ferrous forms of the in vitro-synthesized cytochromes c, together with their reduced pyridine hemochrome spectra (Table I), were almost identical to those of the holoproteins produced in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli (Table I and Fig. 3 for the C11A variant). The data show that these two forms, in vivo and in vitro, of the cytochromes c are almost identical with respect to both the environment of the heme and the heme modification.Table IAbsorption maxima of various species derived from Hydrogenobacter thermophilus cytochrome c552Wavelength/nmProtein speciesReduced proteinPyridine hemochrome (α band)AXXCH mutantHeme b-type complex424.5528.5559.5556Mesoheme complex415520549546Holo produced in vitro421.5524.5557553Holo produced in vivoaThese currently obtained values differ slightly from those obtained in Ref. 8.421.5525557.55532-VDH b-type complex4195225545502-VDH c-type complexbNo covalent product; pyridine hemochrome reflects unmodified heme derivatives.549.54-VDH b-type complex417522552.55504-VDH c-type complex414519.5549547.5CXXAH mutantHeme b-type complex424528559556Mesoheme complex415519.5549.5546Holo produced in vitro421525.5556553Holo produced in vivoaThese currently obtained values differ slightly from those obtained in Ref. 8.420525555.55532-VDH b-type complex418.55235545502-VDH c-type complex416519.5552.55484-VDH b-type complex416.5522552.55504-VDH c-type complexbNo covalent product; pyridine hemochrome reflects unmodified heme derivatives.550Wild-type CXXCH2-VDH b-type complex418.55235545502-VDH c-type complex415519552547.54-VDH b-type complex418522552.55504-VDH c-type complex414519.5548.5547a These currently obtained values differ slightly from those obtained in Ref. 8Tomlinson E.J.

Open table in a new tab The initial rate of thioether bond formation was very similar to that observed for the reaction of heme with wild-type H. thermophilus cytochrome c552 containing a CXXCH motif (1Daltrop O. Allen J.W. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7872-7876Google Scholar). However, because of the smaller difference between the visible spectra of non-covalently and covalently bound heme-protein complex, it was not possible to elucidate unambiguously whether a biphasic kinetic behavior is observed. For the wild-type protein the biphasic kinetic profile was attributed to the heme inversion relative to its α,γ mesoaxis within the heme-binding pocket of the protein. An analogue of the b-type cytochrome intermediate formed quantitatively on the addition of reduced Fe-mesoporphyrin to reduced apocytochrome variants. The product had visible absorption maxima around 549, 519, and 416 nm (Table I) and did not heme stain on an SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 2, lanes c for the C11A and C14A variant). Mesoporphyrin has ethyl groups in the positions of the vinyl groups of protoporphyrin and therefore cannot form thioether bonds with the polypeptide. There was no evidence for any other type of covalent attachment of mesoporphyrin to apoprotein. In Vitro Thioether Bond Formation with 2-VDH and 4-VDH—To elucidate whether the reaction of the vinyl groups of heme with the cysteine residues of the apoproteins is selective with respect to the α,γ mesoaxis of heme, thioether bond formation was studied with mono-vinyl heme derivatives in combination with single cysteine mutants of H. thermophilus cytochrome c552. When either heme derivative (2-VDH and 4-VDH) was added to the C11A mutant of H. thermophilus apocytochrome c552 in the presence of dithiothreitol and dithionite, stoichiometric formation of a b-type cytochrome could first be observed (Table I and Fig. 4, a and b for addition of 2-VDH and 4-VDH, respectively). Very similar spectra have been obtained for synthetic cytochromes obtained from addition of mono-vinyl heme derivatives to peptides known to form cytochrome b maquettes (15Kalsbeck W.A. Robertson D.E. Pandey R.K. Smith K.M. Dutton P.L. Bocian D.F. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3429-3438Google Scholar). Following addition of the C11A mutant from H. thermophilus cytochrome to 2-VDH, the visible spectrum obtained remained unchanged for 15 h, as did the pyridine hemochrome spectrum, which had an α-band around 550 nm, which is the average of the pyridine hemochrome maximum of the α-bands of heme (containing two vinyl groups in the 2- and 4-position) and deuteroheme (containing two hydrogens at the 2- and 4-position). Both these observations suggested that no reaction had occurred between the Cys-14 and the 2-vinyl moiety of the heme derivative. The SDS-PAGE analysis, including heme staining methodology to test for covalently bound heme, suggested that very little attachment of 2-VDH to the apoprotein had occurred (Fig. 5, lane 4). The spectrum of the mixture of the C11A mutant of H. thermophilus apocytochrome c552 and 4-VDH, however, had changed after 15 h (Table I and Fig. 4b). The pyridine hemochrome spectrum had an α-band around 547.5 nm. These experimental data suggested that a reaction between the 4-vinyl group of 4-VDH and the Cys-14 of the apocytochrome had taken place, which was confirmed by heme staining in conjunction with SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 5, lane 5) showing that heme was attached to the protein. Approximately 80% of b-type cytochrome intermediate reacted to form covalently attached heme-protein as judged by pyridine hemochrome analysis. It is unclear why the reaction was not stoichiometric as it was with heme itself. The reason for the slightly lower yield of covalent complex between the C11A protein and 4-VDH on the one hand and heme on the other is not known. Possible reasons include precipitation of the incorrect rotational isomer b-type cytochrome, which then did not equilibrate with its reactive rotational isomer, or underestimation of the yield because of the problem of estimating the extinction coefficient for the novel cytochromes with single thioether bonds.Fig. 5SDS/15% PAGE of in vitro-formed cytochrome variants of H. thermophilus c552 following incubation with mono-vinyl heme derivatives.A, activity staining for covalently bound heme followed by (B) Coomassie Blue staining.

All reactions were carried out with 5 μm protein and an equimolar amount of heme or heme derivative, and the reaction time was 15 h.

As noted in the legend to Fig. 2 the relative staining by Coomassie Blue in different lanes is affected by stain retained from the first step of heme staining. Heme stain intensities are not sufficiently quantitative to be used to assess reaction stoichiometries.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) When the C14A mutant of H. thermophilus apocytochrome c552 was used in the reaction with these two heme derivatives, the reactivity was reversed. Again, a b-type cytochrome intermediate was observed on addition of either 2- or 4-VDH (Table I) as was a pyridine hemochrome spectrum with an α-band of 550 nm. For the 4-VDH no spectral change could be observed within 15 h (data not shown), nor was covalent heme attachment detected by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5, lane 7). However, for the 2-VDH derivative, a spectral change occurred over a period of 15 h (Table I). The resultant pyridine hemochrome spectrum had an α-band of 548 nm. SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed that a reaction had occurred to yield a protein with covalently bound heme (Fig. 5, lane 6). As mentioned earlier, not all the C14A protein bound heme non-covalently. The same was true for binding of mono-vinyl hemes, but in the case of the 2-VDH we estimate, in common with C11A protein and 4-VDH, around 80% of the bound VDH became covalently attached. Overall these data show that the reaction of the cysteine residues with heme vinyl groups is selective to the respective vinyl group and cysteine residue for H. thermophilus cytochrome c552. In the C11A and C14A variants of H. thermophilus cytochrome c552, Cys-11 reacts with the 2-vinyl group of heme and Cys-14 with the 4-vinyl moiety. However, a minor side reaction (up to 10%) leading to non-selective thioether bond formation cannot be excluded as shown by the slight heme staining of the reaction of the C11A mutant with 2-VDH (Fig. 5, lane 4). The kinetics of the reactions of the single cysteine variants of H. thermophilus cytochrome c552 with mono-vinyl heme derivatives were difficult to determine because of the broad absorption bands of the intermediate b-type cytochrome (Fig. 4b for the C11A variant). The broadness of the spectral features of these intermediates might reflect the less rigid heme binding pocket. The lack of the steric hindrance induced by an additional vinyl group of heme might lead to lower constraints on the heme orientations within the protein. Finally, it was shown that wild-type H. thermophilus apocytochrome c552 was able to bind both 2-VDH and 4-VDH covalently (Fig. 5, lanes 2 and 3, respectively), reacting via a b-type cytochrome intermediate (Table I and Fig. 6 show the reaction intermediate and product of wild-type apoprotein with 4-VDH). The apocytochrome was shown to be devoid of covalently bound heme (Fig. 5, lane 1). The kinetics of the monovinyl heme derivatives with wild-type protein containing two cysteine residues were similar to the reaction of heme with apoprotein (1Daltrop O. Allen J.W. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7872-7876Google Scholar). However, it again remained unclear whether a biphasic kinetic behavior is observed. C11A and C14A variants of H. thermophilus apocytochrome c552 were shown to attach heme covalently in vitro via thioether bonds. This observation is evidence that the unusual in vivo formation of these cytochrome variants in the cytoplasm of E. coli (8Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32530-32534Google Scholar) arises from spontaneous thioether bond formation between heme and apocytochrome. Apoforms of H. thermophilus cytochrome c552 have been shown previously to be relatively compact and to be able to recognize heme rapidly and adopt the characteristics of a b-type cytochrome (1Daltrop O. Allen J.W. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7872-7876Google Scholar, 10Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5156-5160Google Scholar, 16Wain R. Pertinhez T.A. Tomlinson E.J. Hong L. Dobson C.M. Ferguson S.J. Smith L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45813-45817Google Scholar). We have suggested (1Daltrop O. Allen J.W. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7872-7876Google Scholar), but not proved, for wild-type cytochrome c552 of H. thermophilus that the heme may initially bind in two orientations, related to a 180° rotation around the α,γ mesoaxis of heme as has been observed for some other heme proteins following addition in vitro of heme to polypeptide (17La Mar G.N. Toi H. Krishnamoorthi R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 6395-6401Google Scholar, 18McLachlan S.J. La Mar G.N. Burns P.D. Smith K.M. Langry K.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 874: 274-284Google Scholar, 19Yamamoto Y. La Mar G.N. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5288-5297Google Scholar, 20Wu J.Z. La Mar G.N. Yu L.P. Lee K.B. Walker F.A. Chiu M.L. Sligar S.G. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 2156-2165Google Scholar). The wild-type protein, carrying the CXXCH motif, goes on to form a c-type cytochrome under reducing condition in vitro (1Daltrop O. Allen J.W. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7872-7876Google Scholar). We argued that this product had the heme covalently attached in only one orientation. The present work provides strong confirmation of this proposal because each of the two mono-vinyl derivatives of heme is selective for the expected single cysteine variant of the cytochrome c, and hence stereoselective product formation is observed with respect to the rotational isomers of the b-type cytochrome complexes relative to the α,γ mesoaxis of heme. It is known that in all naturally formed c-type cytochromes the 2-vinyl group of heme becomes attached to the N-terminal cysteine of the CXXCH motif and the 4-vinyl moiety reacts with the cysteine adjacent to the histidine coordinating to the heme iron (5Barker P.D. Ferguson S.J. Structure. 1999; 7: R281-R290Google Scholar). In general, non-covalently bound heme is found in predominantly one orientation inside proteins such as globins and b-type cytochromes. However, mixtures of heme orientations that are related by a 180° rotation around the α,γ mesoaxis of heme can be seen following addition of heme to an apoprotein in vitro (17La Mar G.N. Toi H. Krishnamoorthi R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 6395-6401Google Scholar, 18McLachlan S.J. La Mar G.N. Burns P.D. Smith K.M. Langry K.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 874: 274-284Google Scholar, 19Yamamoto Y. La Mar G.N. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 5288-5297Google Scholar). In many cases the apoproteins are thought to present a nascent binding site that can be initially occupied by heme in either orientation. Such binding sites have asymmetric features, which result in one heme orientation being thermodynamically favored. In the case of c-type cytochromes it has not been thought that there is a nascent heme pocket in the apoproteins, but our recent work on both the H. thermophilus cytochrome c552 (1Daltrop O. Allen J.W. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7872-7876Google Scholar, 16Wain R. Pertinhez T.A. Tomlinson E.J. Hong L. Dobson C.M. Ferguson S.J. Smith L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45813-45817Google Scholar) and developing early studies of others (compare Ref. 21Daltrop O. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4404-4409Google Scholar) with mitochondrial cytochrome c (21Daltrop O. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4404-4409Google Scholar) challenges this view. The structural features of this putative nascent site are not known, and therefore it may in principle accommodate heme in either of the two rotational isomeric orientations. On the other hand, the heme binding pocket of the apoprotein may have sufficient of the asymmetric features seen in the holoprotein (22Hasegawa J. Yoshida T. Yamazaki T. Sambongi Y. Yu Y. Igarashi Y. Kodama T. Yamazaki K. Kyogoku Y. Kobayashi Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9641-9649Google Scholar) to ensure preferential binding of heme in one rotational isomeric position. In the former of the two alternatives our results imply that the stereochemical features of the site are such that only a 2- or 4-vinyl group in the same location as in the holoprotein can approach a cysteine thiol sufficiently closely to overcome kinetic constraints on in vitro thioether bond formation. The second alternative implies that the nascent heme binding site in the apoprotein is sufficiently structured so as to exclude its occupancy by heme to yield the “wrong” rotational isomer. In this case bond formation between a mono-vinyl heme and a wrong cysteine can be readily envisaged as not feasible. These considerations also imply that the single thioether bond variants of H. thermophilus cytochromes c formed in the cytoplasm of E. coli (8Tomlinson E.J. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32530-32534Google Scholar) have predominantly heme attached in one rotational orientation around the α,γ mesoaxis of heme. This strict stereospecific requirement for covalent attachment of heme to apocytochrome c552 contrasts with the situation seen for uncatalyzed Thermus thermophilus cytochrome c synthesis in the cytoplasm of E. coli, where an inversion of heme relative to its α,γ mesoaxis can be related to misattachment of heme (23McRee D.E. Williams P.A. Sridhar V. Pastuszyn A. Bren K.L. Patel K.M. Chen Y. Todaro T.R. Sanders D. Luna E. Fee J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 6537-6544Google Scholar). This contrast makes the acquisition of structural information about the H. thermophilus apoprotein (16Wain R. Pertinhez T.A. Tomlinson E.J. Hong L. Dobson C.M. Ferguson S.J. Smith L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45813-45817Google Scholar) an intriguing prospect. To the best of our knowledge, it is not known what advantage(s) arise from incorporating heme to yield only one rotational isomer in vivo in either c-type cytochromes or into other heme-containing proteins such as globins or b-type cytochromes in a non-covalent fashion. Evolutionary points have been discussed for c-type cytochromes (24Kojo S. Fukunishi K. Tsukamoto I. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1989; 28: 71-72Google Scholar). We suspect that rotational isomerism arises in vivo either because of stereoselective heme release after its biosynthesis or because hemecontaining proteins have evolved to form the heme pocket such that only one rotational heme-protein isomer yields optimal heme-protein interactions required for efficient functioning of the metalloprotein. Little is known about the chemistry that underpins thioether bond formation from cysteine thiols and vinyl groups of heme. The present observations show, at least for the in vitro studies, that the reaction of either vinyl group of heme to form the first thioether bond is independent of the presence of the second vinyl group. However, where both the second vinyl group and two cysteine residues are present, the formation of the second thioether bond is faster than the first, at least as evidenced by our failure to detect a significant concentration of single thioether bond product during reaction of heme with the CXXCH protein (1Daltrop O. Allen J.W. Willis A.C. Ferguson S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 7872-7876Google Scholar). The observation that heme lyase can attach heme covalently to apocytochromes with only one cysteine residue in the CXXCH motif (9Rosell F.I. Mauk A.G. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7811-7818Google Scholar, 25Tanaka Y. Kubota I. Amachi T. Yoshizumi H. Matsubara H. J. Biochem. 1990; 108: 7-8Google Scholar) suggests that heme lyase might accelerate the process studied here in vitro. Mechanistic implications for the catalytic functions of the heme lyase are discussed elsewhere (21Daltrop O. Ferguson S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4404-4409Google Scholar). Overall this work shows that spontaneous formation of a single thioether bond can occur in vitro and can be selective with respect to the heme orientation. It also illustrates that thioether bonds can form independently from one another, i.e. there is no requirement to form both thioether bonds in a concerted fashion in a typical c-type cytochrome. We thank Lin Hong for production of the C11A and C14A mutants of H. thermophilus cytochrome c552."

The largest effect was observed at position Ser-2, which occupies the S1′ pocket of the enzyme and donates a hydrogen bond to the carboxyl group of the catalytic Glu-177 of the proteinase. Substitution of Asp, Arg, or Trp at this position increased the dissociation constant K D by 35-, 180-, and 13-fold, respectively. Mutation at positions 3–5 of the trunk also resulted in a reduction in enzyme-inhibitor affinity, with the exception of an I4W mutant, which exhibited a 3-fold increase in affinity. Molecular dynamics simulation of the complex formation between the catalytic domain of APR and the S2D mutant showed that the carboxyl of Asp-2 interacts with the catalytic zinc, thereby partially neutralizing the negative charge that otherwise would clash with the carboxyl group of Glu-177 of APR. Simulation of the interaction between the alkaline proteinase and the I4W mutant revealed a major shift in the loop comprised of residues 189–200 of the enzyme that allowed formation of a stacking interaction between the aromatic rings of Ile-4 of the inhibitor and Tyr-158 of the proteinase. This new interaction could account for the observed increase in enzyme-inhibitor affinity. Alkaline proteinase inhibitor of Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a 11.5-kDa, high affinity inhibitor of the serralysin class of zinc-dependent proteinases secreted by several Gram-negative bacteria.

This new interaction could account for the observed increase in enzyme-inhibitor affinity. Bacteria of the genera Pseudomonas, Serratia, and Erwinia secrete homologous 50-kDa proteinases and also produce specific, high affinity inhibitors directed against these proteinases that belong to the serralysin branch of the metzincin metalloproteinase superfamily. The metzincin family also includes the mammalian matrix metalloproteinases, the reprolysins, and the adamalysins (1Stöcker W. Grams F. Baumann U. Reinemer P. Gomis-Rüth F.X McKay D.B. Bode W. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 823-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). In addition to a consensus zinc binding sequence consisting of an HEXXHXXGXXH motif, the metzincins are characterized by a conserved surface methionine residue located near the base of the zinc binding pocket.

Biol. 1994; 242: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) revealed that these metalloproteinases consist of two domains, an N-terminal catalytic domain of about 230 residues and a C-terminal domain of similar size that is required for secretion of the enzyme across the periplasm into the external medium (6Létoffé S. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1375-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The function of the serralysin inhibitors is probably to protect the bacterium from adventitious proteolysis during serralysin secretion (7Létoffé S. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. Mol. Microbiol. 1989; 3: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). They are produced as precursors of about 125 amino acids with an N-terminal signal sequence that is removed to form the mature inhibitor of 103–106 residues (8Duong F. Lazdunski A. Cami B. Murgier M. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 121: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The seven serralysin inhibitors known to date share ∼20% sequence identity and 40–50% sequence similarity (9Hege T. Feltzer R.E. Gray R.D. Baumann U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35087-35092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In particular, residue 2 is always Ser, whereas residue 3 is Leu in 6 of 7 known inhibitors and Phe in the seventh. Position 4 exhibits greater variation and can be either non-polar (Leu or Val) or polar (Arg or Lys). Crystal structures of the S. marcescens serralysin-Erwinia chrysanthemi inhibitor Inh and APR·APRin complex from P. aeruginosa have been determined (9Hege T. Feltzer R.E. Gray R.D. Baumann U. J.

Biol. 1995; 248: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). These structures show that both the Erwinia and the Pseudomonas inhibitors fold into disulfide-stabilized, eight-stranded β-barrels with an N-terminal trunk of 10 amino acids with the first five residues of the trunk occupying the extended substrate binding site of the enzyme (see Fig. 1). Ser-1I, 2The sequence numbering system of Hege et al. (9Hege T. Feltzer R.E. Gray R.D. Baumann U. J. Biol.

The hydroxyl proton forms a hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl oxygen of Tyr-216P and the hydroxyl group of Ser-2I donates a hydrogen bond to the carboxyl of the catalytic base, Glu-177P. The β-barrel, which makes several contacts with the enzyme near the Met turn, prevents the trunk from extending past the zinc and completely occupying the extended substrate binding site (10Baumann U. Bauer M. Létoffé S. Delepelaire P. Wandersman C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 248: 653-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Characterization of the interaction between APR and its inhibitor is of interest for at least three reasons. First, APR is one of several virulence factors of P. aeruginosa capable of inactivating proteins involved in host defense mechanisms (5Baumann U. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 242: 244-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 11Heck L.W. Morihara K. Abrahamson D.R. Infect. Immun. 1986; 54: 149-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Molla A. Yamamoto T. Akaike T. Miyoshi S. Maeda H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10589-10594Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); understanding inhibition of this enzyme could result in strategies for the amelioration of infections by this organism. Second, the activity of both APR and the structurally similar mammalian MMPs is regulated by the formation of high affinity complexes with specific protein inhibitors. Finally, the mechanism of interaction between serralysins and their inhibitors is similar to that of the MMPs and their cognate inhibitors, the TIMPs (9Hege T. Feltzer R.E. Gray R.D. Baumann U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35087-35092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), although the two classes of inhibitor bear no apparent sequence homology. In both the N-terminal residue of the inhibitor chelates the catalytic zinc; in addition, both inhibitors have a hydroxyl group in the penultimate position that hydrogen bonds to the catalytic Glu of the enzyme (9Hege T. Feltzer R.E. Gray R.D. Baumann U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35087-35092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 13Gomis-Rüth F.X. Maskos K. Betz M. Bergner A. Huber R.

Calvete J.J. Lichte A. Tschesche H. Maskos K. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5238-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to investigate the role of side chains in positions 2–5 in the interaction between APRin and APR. We found that single amino acid changes at these positions resulted in altered binding affinity, with conserved Ser-2I more sensitive to mutation than positions 3–5, in keeping with its specific interactions with the proteinase. Molecular dynamics simulations were used to rationalize these alterations in affinity in structural terms. Construction of APRin Expression Plasmids—APRin mutants were expressed as described previously (15Feltzer R.E. Gray R.D. Dean W.L. Pierce Jr., W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21002-21007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using the isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside-inducible pET22b+ expression system obtained from Novagen (Madison, WI). A cDNA encoding the mutant protein was generated by the polymerase chain reaction with primers containing the desired altered codon and restriction sites for cloning (shown in Table I). The template DNA was EcoRI-digested genomic DNA from P. aeruginosa (strain PA01). The resulting products were ligated into the pT7Blue vector using the “Perfectly Blunt” cloning kit of Novagen. The APRin-encoding fragment was then excised from pT7Blue with BamHI and either MscI or Ecl136II. The DNA was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated into the MscI/BamHI sites of the expression plasmid. The sequence of both strands of each coding insert was verified using a Beckman CEQ 2000 DNA sequencer.Table IPCR primers for construction of expression vectors for wt APRin and APRin mutantsPrimerSequenceRestriction sitewt-5′CTGGCCAGCAGTCTGATTCTTCTCAGCMscIwt-3′TATGGATCCTAGGGCGTCGCGCGGCGCABamHISIG-5′CCGCGAGTCTGATTCTTCTCANoneS2D-5′TGGCCAGCGACCTGATTCTTCTCAGCMscIS2R-5′TGGCCAGCCGTCTGATTCTTCTCAGCMscIS2W-5′TGGCCAGCTGGCTGATTCTTCTCAGCMscI14A-5′CCAGCAGTCTGGCTCTTCTCAGCNone14E-5′CCAGCAGTCTGGAACTTCTCAGCNone14P-5′CCAGCAGTCTGCCGCTTCTCAGCNone14R-5′CCAGCAGTCTGCGTCTTCTCAGCNone14W-5′TGGCCAGCAGTCTGTGGCTTCTCAGCMscIL5E-5′TGGCCAGCAGTCTGATTGAACTCAGCGCTTMscI Open table in a new tab Protein Expression and Purification—Recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) obtained from Novagen. The procedures of Feltzer et al. (15Feltzer R.E. Gray R.D. Dean W.L. Pierce Jr., W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21002-21007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) for culture, protein induction, osmotic shock, and inhibitor purification were followed except that a broad-spectrum proteinase inhibitor mixture designed for bacterial cell extracts (Sigma) was included in the crude osmotic lysate. The inhibitor proteins were purified by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography and subsequently characterized by SDS-PAGE, electrospray mass spectrometry, fluorescence emission, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. Each mutant gave a single band on SDS-PAGE and the expected molecular mass by mass spectrometry. For all inhibitors except those with an added Trp residue, protein concentrations were estimated from the absorbance at 280 nm using ϵ = 17.7 mm–1 cm–1 previously established for the wt protein (15Feltzer R.E. Gray R.D. Dean W.L. Pierce Jr., W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21002-21007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). An ϵ280 of 25.3 mm–1 cm-1 was estimated for the S2W and I4W mutants using the method of Gill and von Hipple (16Gill S.J. von Hipple P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5009) Google Scholar). Alkaline Proteinase—Crystalline APR was purchased from Nagase Biochemicals Ltd., Tokyo, Japan, and purified as described (15Feltzer R.E. Gray R.D. Dean W.L. Pierce Jr., W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21002-21007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). APR concentration was estimated by UV absorption using E1cm1&x0025;=16.0 at 280 nm, in conjunction with a molecular weight of 50,000 (2Morihara K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 73: 113-124Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Kinetic Assays—APR inhibition was assessed as previously described (15Feltzer R.E. Gray R.D. Dean W.L. Pierce Jr., W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21002-21007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using Ac-Pro-Leu-Gly-[2-mercapto-4-methyl-pentanoyl]-Leu-Gly ethyl ester as substrate (17Weingarten H. Feder J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 139: 1184-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The kinetics of substrate hydrolysis were determined by measuring the appearance of the product peptide HSCH2CH[CH2CH(CH3)2]-Gly-OEt spectrophotometrically using the thiol indicator 4,4′-dithiodipyridine (18Jocelyn P.C. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 143: 44-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar) at a concentration of 0.5 mm. Reactions were conducted in microtiter plates that had been pretreated with a siliconizing agent (Sigmacote) to minimize protein binding to the plastic. Buffer conditions were 50 mm MOPS, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.001% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.0, with either 0.1 or 2.4 m NaCl. The progress curves were determined with a Spectramax microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) set to 324 nm and maintained at 25 °C. In a typical set of assays, a total of 8 reactions at inhibitor concentrations ranging from 0 to ∼5 nm were monitored at 20-s intervals for a period of 4 h. The concentration of APR was usually 0.5 nm, except for an enzyme-free blank that was included to correct for spontaneous hydrolysis of the thioester substrate. Determination of Kinetic and Equilibrium Constants—Inhibition of APR by APRin in this assay system has been previously shown (15Feltzer R.E. Gray R.D. Dean W.L. Pierce Jr., W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21002-21007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) to be compatible with the reaction steps defined in Scheme 1. The dissociation constant Ks for the ES complex and k cat for ES were set to values determined previously (15Feltzer R.E. Gray R.D. Dean W.L. Pierce Jr., W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21002-21007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Values for rate constants for enzyme-inhibitor association and dissociation (k on and k off) and for the rate constant for spontaneous hydrolysis of the substrate (k h) were estimated by global fitting of a series of progress curves obtained at different E:I ratios to the kinetic equations of Scheme 1 using the computer program Dynafit (15Feltzer R.E. Gray R.D. Dean W.L. Pierce Jr., W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21002-21007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 19Kuzmic P. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 260-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). The kinetic constants reported are the mean of at least three independent sets of experiments, each of which covered a range of inhibitor concentrations. For some inhibitors, k off was too small to be reliably determined by this procedure. In these instances it was determined directly by dilution of the pre-formed enzyme-inhibitor complex into an assay mixture followed by recording the appearance of active enzyme accompanying relaxation to the new equilibrium state (15Feltzer R.E. Gray R.D. Dean W.L. Pierce Jr., W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21002-21007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Fluorescence and CD Spectroscopy—Fluorescence and CD spectroscopy were used to assess the effects of the mutations on gross protein structure. Fluorescence emission spectra were recorded at room temperature from 290 to 460 nm using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm, and the protein concentration was 0.5 μm in 20 mm Tris, 50 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, or 20 mm Tris, 6 m guanidine HCl, pH 7.6. CD spectra were measured at room temperature with a Jasco J-710 spectropolarimeter calibrated with d-10-camphor sulfonic acid. The path length was 0.02 cm, and the protein concentration was 20–40 μm in 20 mm Tris, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.4. Four ellipticity readings at 1-nm intervals between 240 and 187 nm were averaged and converted to Δϵ values based upon the mean residue weight of each protein. The program CDsstr (20Johnson W.C. Proteins. 1999; 35: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) was used to estimate secondary structure from the CD data. All fluorescence emission spectra and CD spectra were corrected by subtraction of a buffer blank. Modeling—Starting models were based on the APR·APRin x-ray crystal structure (9Hege T. Feltzer R.E. Gray R.D. Baumann U. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35087-35092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) with the inclusion of residues 26–251 catalytic domain of the enzyme. These residues encompass all those in contact with the inhibitor in the crystal structure (see Fig. 1). The inhibitor, zinc atom, and 58 water molecules in the interface between APR and APRin were included from the x-ray crystal structure. The S2D and I4W mutant inhibitors were created by replacing the corresponding inhibitor residues with mutated residues in standard conformations. Models were hydrated in a 10-Å box of TIP3P waters using standard AMBER (21Cornell W.D. Cieplak P Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11366) Google Scholar) rules; Na+ counterions were placed randomly for charge neutrality. Box sizes were adjusted to include 10,398 waters for each model. Simulations were performed in the isothermal isobaric ensemble (300 K, 1 atm) with the AMBER 7.0 program (21Cornell W.D. Cieplak P Bayly C.I. Gould I.R. Merz K.M. Ferguson D.M. Spellmeyer D.C. Fox T. Caldwell J.W. Kollman P.A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 5179-5197Crossref Scopus (11366) Google Scholar) and parameters from parm96.dat using periodic boundary conditions and the Particle-Mesh-Ewald algorithm. Molecular dynamics simulations used the MPI version of the Sander routine (1.5-fs time step) with SHAKE to freeze all bonds involving hydrogen. Initial equilibrium for 155 ps following the general protocol of Trent (22Trent J.O. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 340: 290-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was performed with gradual removal of positional restraints on the protein complex. The production runs were 1.5 ns in length, and average structures for each complex (taken from 50 snapshots accumulated in the last 75 ps) were obtained and subsequently minimized. The calculations were run on a 32 processor SGI Origin 2000. Spectroscopic Characterization of Recombinant Proteins— Fluorescence and CD spectra of the recombinant proteins were compared with the corresponding spectra for the wt protein to compare folding of the recombinant proteins with that of the wt protein. Fluorescence emission spectra of Trp-containing proteins is an indicator of tertiary structure because the emission maximum of the indole ring is sensitive to the polarity of the local environment (23Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 354-357Google Scholar). For the mutant proteins having the same number of Trp residues as the wt protein, the mean fluorescence emission maximum was at 335.1 ± 1.7 nm compared with the emission maximum for the wt protein of 335 nm. This indicates that the three Trp residues in the mutant proteins experience a microenvironment comparable with that of the same residues in the wt protein. The emission maxima for the S2W and I4W mutants were shifted to 340 and 341 nm, respectively, which is consistent with a structure in which the mutant Trp residues are exposed to water, as expected for the solvent-exposed trunk in the proteinase-free inhibitor. Under denaturing conditions, all of the mutants exhibited fluorescence maxima of 355 ± 1 nm, which is characteristic of Trp in aqueous environment (23Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 354-357Google Scholar). The CD spectra of the mutant proteins in the spectral range 190–240 nm was used to assess secondary structure. The spectra of all the mutants were virtually superimposable with the spectrum of the wt protein (data not shown), indicating similar secondary structures. In keeping with the spectral similarity, analysis using the CDsstr program (20Johnson W.C. Proteins. 1999; 35: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar) showed that the secondary structure of the mutants did not differ significantly from that of wt APRin. We conclude from the fluorescence and CD experiments that the mutant proteins fold into similar conformations that resemble that of the wt protein. Kinetic Studies—The development of inhibition of APR by wt APRin required 3–4 h to reach completion at the nm concentrations of the proteins used in the assays (15Feltzer R.E. Gray R.D. Dean W.L. Pierce Jr., W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21002-21007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Similar time-dependent inhibition kinetics was displayed by the mutants in this study (data not shown). As demonstrated in our previous work (15Feltzer R.E. Gray R.D. Dean W.L. Pierce Jr., W.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21002-21007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), the mechanism of inhibition is consistent with a competitive, single-step bimolecular reaction between enzyme and inhibitor as depicted in Scheme 1. The rate constants for formation and breakdown of the APR·APRin complex along with values for the apparent dissociation constant and change in Gibbs free energy of binding derived from these constants are summarized in Table II. Of the 11 APRin mutants, 10 exhibited decreased affinity for APR. One, the I4W mutant, showed an increased affinity for APR compared with the wt protein.Table IIKinetic and equilibrium constants for interaction of APR with wt APRin and APRin mutantsProteinkonkoffKD aCalculated from the ratio of k off to k on.

Alteration of Ser-2I to Asp, Arg, or Trp resulted in decreased enzyme-inhibitor affinity by 35-, 180-, and 14-fold, respectively. For each mutant in this series, the decrease in binding affinity resulted predominantly from an increase in the rate of dissociation, with elevations of ∼35-, 375-, and 60-fold in k off for the S2D, S2R, and S2W mutants, respectively. The Arg and Trp mutants exhibited an increased association rate of ∼2- and ∼5-fold, respectively, whereas the rate of association of the Asp mutant was about the same as that for the wt protein. Inhibitor positions 3, 4, and 5 were less sensitive than position 2 to alteration. A decrease in affinity of 10–15-fold was observed for these mutants except for I4W, which exhibited a 3-fold increase. For mutant L3E, the change in affinity was comparable with that for S2W (both ∼10-fold), whereas mutation at positions 4 or 5 resulted in smaller changes (<10-fold). As with position 2, the affinity changes resulted predominantly from an increase in rate of dissociation. The higher affinity observed for the I4W protein resulted completely from an increase in the rate of association. Ionic Strength Effects—Inhibition assays were routinely conducted in the presence of 2.4 m NaCl because the sensitivity of the assay is better under these conditions as a result of a 6.4-fold decrease in K s at higher the ionic strength (15Feltzer R.E.
