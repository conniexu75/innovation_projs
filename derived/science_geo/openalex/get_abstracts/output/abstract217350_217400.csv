https://openalex.org/W1971598620,"A general method of determining the relative magnitudes of different pathways of formation of a urinary metabolite from a single precursor substance is described. The method requires the administration of the precursor and an intermediate labeled with different isotopes, and the determination of the ratio of the isotopes in the metabolites. A preliminary application to epinephrine metabolism in man is presented."

https://openalex.org/W2078313527,The influence of the pituitary on the transport of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid-1-C(14) into the cells of isolated rat diaphragm was investigated. Hypophysectomy results in a lower-than-normal rate of alpha-aminoisobutyric acid-1-C(14) penetration into muscle. Adding either simian or bovine growth hormone preparations to the incubation medium in concentrations of 2.5 to 25 microg/ml of medium resulted in a doubling of the alpha-aminoisobutyric acid-l-C(14) penetration rate. The stimulatory effect was minimized when the hormone concentration was reduced to 0.25 microg/ml of medium.

https://openalex.org/W1999784007,"Accumulation of mutants in glucose-limited chemostats is proportional to growth rate, while in tryptophan-limited chemostats it is independent of growth rate. This behavior, which implies the failure of the error hypothesis, may be explainable on the basis of a unitary hypothesis: the results with glucose may be due to reversion or loss of latent mutants."
https://openalex.org/W1988251183,"THE ethereal sulphate of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenylglycol, a metabolite of epinephrine and norepinephrine, has recently been demonstrated in the urine of normal individuals and was noted to be markedly increased in the urine of patients having phæochromocytoma1. The free compound has not been previously demonstrated and the possibility that conjugated (nor)metanephrine gives rise to this compound could not be ruled out. We have now been able to demonstrate the presence of free 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol in phæochromocytoma tissue from four different patients, as well as metanephrine in three of these tumours."

https://openalex.org/W2093649414,Unilateral lesions in the visual and somesthetic cortex of rat brain cause a slight but significant increase inc the cortical cholinesterase activity in the contralateral hemisphere. There is some indication of strain differences in this effect. No change in cholinesterase activity is found in the subcortical brain. These findings may be helpful in understanding mechanisms of interdependence among brain areas.
https://openalex.org/W2013035731,"A study of polymorphism of the starch-gel electrophoretic pattern for one of the blood serum proteins in swine (tentatively designated protein B) reveals that it is controlled by a single pair of alleles exhibiting partial dominance. BB genotypes appear to have twice the amount of protein B that the Bb genotype has, while bb genotypes show no evidence of the protein. Present indications are that the Yorkshire and Landrace breeds differ in the frequency of these genes."
https://openalex.org/W2068489036,"SEVERAL attempts have been made in the past to correlate the amount of acetylcholine released during activity at nerve endings with the amount needed to produce activation of the effector cell1–3. It is clearly of crucial importance for the acetylcholine hypothesis that there should be quantitative agreement between these amounts. Until recently, a very substantial discrepancy has remained, supporting the suggestion that acetylcholine is merely a byproduct of transmission. One source of difficulty in making such correlations has been the paucity of results concerning the release of acetylcholine and the excitation produced by its application in the same preparation."

https://openalex.org/W2083454014,"Two hitherto unreported induced radionuclides, scandium-46 and cesium-134, have been detected in fallout material. Identification was made by chemical separation and gamma scintillation spectrometry. While the origin of these materials is not known, possible routes of formation from stable elements are suggested."

https://openalex.org/W2053736203,"WHILE investigating the physiological aspects of the distribution of two species of the marine gastropod Bullia, one of us (A.C.B.) discovered that these snails can crawl only between certain limits of salinity. As the salinity of the sea-water is decreased by the addition of distilled water, movements become more and more restricted, eventually resulting in the total loss of locomotory powers while the animal becomes distended due to the osmotic inflow of water. Providing that dilution is accomplished reasonably slowly (taking 60 min. or more) the foot is not retracted at any stage, while the excitability of the muscles is greatly reduced or disappears completely. The animal remains motionless with stiff, swollen tissues. For Bullia digitalis Meuschen, this critical salinity lies in the region of 1.8 per cent, while in the case of B. laevissima (Gmelin) it is about 2.35 per cent. Loss of locomotory powers due to decreased salinity has previously been noted for some rocky-shore gastropods by Broekhuysen1 and Brown2. The phenomenon resembles the loss of contractility in vertebrate skeletal muscle subjected to ‘water rigour’. However, in Bullia the process is completely reversible. The snails can be kept for some hours at these reduced salinities without apparent ill-effect ; when returned to fresh, undiluted sea-water they soon recover and behave normally."
https://openalex.org/W2056986744,"ADENYLIC acid, or adenosine-5′-phosphate, is a nucleotide of particular biochemical interest. It is not only a component of ribonucleic acid, but also forms a part of the structure of many coenzymes and, as the di- and tri-phosphate, it is frequently involved in metabolic processes. Spencer1 has reviewed the information at present available on the constituent components of the nucleotides from crystal structure analysis. In addition to the references cited by Spencer, one may also mention the brief note of Brown et al.
2 on a single projection of adenosine-3′-phosphate and the paper by Alver and Furberg3 on the structure of cytidine-3′-phosphate. No nucleoside-5′-phosphate has been solved previously."

https://openalex.org/W2092728720,"WORK on the influence of different chemical compounds on the reaction between blood group receptors of red cells and the corresponding antibodies has been published; but the action of antibiotics on this reaction, however, has not yet been fully examined except by Neter et al. 1, who described the effect of antibiotics on enterobacterial lipopolysaccharides utilizing hæmagglutination and hæmolysis reactions. Our chance discovery of the inhibiting effect of a streptomycin solution on the reaction between anti-D antibodies and D-positive erythrocytes led us to study the effect of different streptomycin concentrations on the antigen-antibody interaction in blood group systems. For our experiments we used streptomycin of Czechoslovak origin (‘Streptomycinum sulphuricum’, Penicillin Works, Prague). The different streptomycin concentrations were prepared by diluting 1 gm. of streptomycin in 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 80 and 100 ml. of saline. Agglutinating sera of the systems A 1 A 2 BO, MN and Rh/Hr were chosen for the reaction; the red blood cells of the corresponding blood groups were washed three times in saline before use."

https://openalex.org/W2009407142,"In vitro studies have shown that cells from polyoma-induced mouse tumours in mass culture can release virus, and that the release can vary in different tumours1,2. One of the factors responsible for this difference in release is the proportion of virus-releasing cells as measured by plating the tumour cells on mouse embryo monolayers, and determining the relationship between the number of tumour cells plated and the number of plaques2. The present communication is concerned with a study on single cells from mouse parotid tumours grown in micro-drops, in order to obtain information on: (a) the proportion of cells releasing virus by plating in microdrops, and (b) the virus release per cell."
