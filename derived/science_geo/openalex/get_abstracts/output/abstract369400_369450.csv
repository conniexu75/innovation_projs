https://openalex.org/W2064877960,"PCSK9 is a natural inhibitor of LDL receptor (LDLR) that binds the extracellular domain of LDLR and triggers its intracellular degradation. PCSK9 and LDLR are coordinately regulated at the transcriptional level by sterols through their promoter-imbedded sterol response elements (SRE) and co-induced by statins. Identification of regulatory networks modulating PCSK9 transcription is important for developing selective repressors of PCSK9 to improve statin efficacy by prolonging the up-regulation of LDLR. Interestingly, the plant-derived hypocholesterolemic compound berberine (BBR) up-regulates LDLR expression while down-regulating PCSK9. In our investigations to define mechanisms underlying the transcriptional suppression of PCSK9 by BBR in HepG2 cells, we have identified a highly conserved hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) binding site residing 28 bp upstream from SRE as a critical sequence motif for PCSK9 transcription and its regulation by BBR. Mutation of the HNF1 site reduced PCSK9 promoter activity >90%. A battery of functional assays identified HNF1alpha as the predominant trans-activator for PCSK9 gene working through this sequence motif. We further provide evidence suggesting that HNF1 site works cooperatively with SRE as HNF1 mutation significantly attenuated the activity of nuclear SREBP2 to transactivate PCSK9 promoter. Finally, we show that a coordinate modest reduction of HNF1alpha and nuclear SREBP2 by BBR led to a strong suppression of PCSK9 transcription through these two critical regulatory sequences. This is the first described example of SREBP pairing with HNF1 to control an important regulatory pathway in cholesterol homeostasis. This work also provides a mechanism for how BBR suppresses PCSK9 transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2014205072,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short single stranded noncoding RNAs that suppress gene expression through either translational repression or degradation of target mRNAs. The annealing between messenger RNAs and 5' seed region of miRNAs is believed to be essential for the specific suppression of target gene expression. One miRNA can have several hundred different targets in a cell. Rapidly accumulating evidence suggests that many miRNAs are involved in cell cycle regulation and consequentially play critical roles in carcinogenesis.Introduction of synthetic miR-107 or miR-185 suppressed growth of the human non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. Flow cytometry analysis revealed these miRNAs induce a G1 cell cycle arrest in H1299 cells and the suppression of cell cycle progression is stronger than that by Let-7 miRNA. By the gene expression analyses with oligonucleotide microarrays, we find hundreds of genes are affected by transfection of these miRNAs. Using miRNA-target prediction analyses and the array data, we listed up a set of likely targets of miR-107 and miR-185 for G1 cell cycle arrest and validate a subset of them using real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting for CDK6.We identified new cell cycle regulating miRNAs, miR-107 and miR-185, localized in frequently altered chromosomal regions in human lung cancers. Especially for miR-107, a large number of down-regulated genes are annotated with the gene ontology term 'cell cycle'. Our results suggest that these miRNAs may contribute to regulate cell cycle in human malignant tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2043638973,"The interplay of transcription factors, histone modifiers, and DNA modification can alter chromatin structure that epigenetically controls gene transcription. During severe systemic inflammatory (SSI), the generation of facultative heterochromatin from euchromatin reversibly silences transcription of a set of acute proinflammatory genes. This gene-specific silencing is a salient feature of the endotoxin tolerant phenotype that is found in blood leukocytes of SSI patients and in a human THP-1 cell model of SSI. We previously reported that de novo induction of the NF-κB transcription factor RelB by endotoxin activation is necessary and sufficient for silencing transcription of acute proinflammatory genes in the endotoxin tolerant SSI phenotype. Here, we examined how RelB silences gene expression and found that RelB induces facultative heterochromatin formation by directly interacting with the histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferase G9a. We found that heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) and G9a formed a complex at the interleukin-1β promoter that is dependent on the Rel homology domain (RHD) of RelB. RelB knockdown disassociated the complex and reversed transcription silencing. We also observed that whereas RelB chromatin binding was independent of G9a, RelB transcriptional silencing required G9a accumulation at the silenced promoter. Binding between RelB and G9a was confirmed by glutathione S-transferase pulldown in vitro and coimmunoprecipitation in vivo. These data provide novel insight into how RelB is required to initiate silencing in the phenotype associated with severe systemic inflammation in humans, a disease with major morbidity and mortality.

Inflammation is an evolutionarily conserved stereotypic stress response primarily orchestrated by temporal alterations in gene expression, with important contributions from complement, coagulation, and neurogenic processes (1Hotchkiss R.S. Karl I.E. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 138-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar, 2Riedemann N.C. Guo R.F. Ward P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 460-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). The genetic information encoded to generate inflammation regulates distinct functional sets of genes, including pro- and anti-inflammatory modifiers, directors of cell death, and mediators of cell respiration and metabolism (3McCall C.E. Yoza B.K. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2007; 175: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The initiating stage of virtually all inflammation depends on sensory receptors coupled to intracellular signals that activate the immunity master regulator NF-κB to generate p65 and p50 transactivating heterodimers at euchromatin promoters of a set of early response proinflammatory genes. When spread throughout the circulation, this early stage may precipitate the extreme stress response of severe systemic inflammation (SSI). 4The abbreviations used are: SSIsevere systemic inflammationHP1heterochromatin protein 1IPimmunoprecipitationChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationGSTglutathione S-transferaseH3K9histone H3 lysine 9HMGB1high mobility group box protein 1IL-1βinterleukin 1βLPSlipopolysaccharide endotoxinRHDRel homology domainTLR4Toll-like receptor 4TNFαtumor necrosis factor αHAhemagglutininsiRNAsmall interfering RNA. Later stages of inflammation reprogramming often require protein synthesis and induce expression of distinct sets of genes with anti-inflammatory, survival, and energy regulation (4Cobb J.P.

Chromatin exists in structural forms that provide access of DNA to transcription factors in responsive euchromatin and mask access to the transcriptional apparatus in compacted heterochromatin (12Kouzarides T. Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8087) Google Scholar). Facultative heterochromatin defines chromatin that can switch between open euchromatin and compacted heterochromatin (13Trojer P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The mechanisms that control compaction and de-compaction of facultative heterochromatin to influence phenotypes through epigenetic control of gene expression are poorly defined but involve the cooperative interplay of transcription factors and modifiers of nucleosomal histones and DNA (12Kouzarides T. Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8087) Google Scholar, 14Li B. Carey M. Workman J.L. Cell. 2007; 128: 707-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2684) Google Scholar). Regulation of chromatin structure through covalent and non-covalent histone modifications is critical for epigenetically regulating gene expression across the genome (15Ko M. Sohn D.H. Chung H. Seong R.H. Mutat. Res. 2008; 647: 59-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Histone lysine methylation participates in various chromatin-associating functions, including transcriptional regulation, heterochromatin formation, DNA repair, and recombination (16Kim J.K. Samaranayake M. Pradhan S. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 66: 596-612Crossref Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 17Akbarian S. Huang H.S. Biol.

G9a is a major mammalian methyltransferase responsible for mono- and dimethylation of histone H3K9 at euchromatin regions (18Tachibana M. Ueda J. Fukuda M. Takeda N. Ohta T. Iwanari H. Sakihama T. Kodama T. Hamakubo T. Shinkai Y. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 815-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Dimethylated H3K9 contributes to binding of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) and transition of accessible (open) euchromatin to compacted (closed) and transcriptionally silenced facultative heterochromatin (13Trojer P. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). We and others reported that epigenetic alterations generate gene-specific control of SSI by Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) induces chromatin modifications in blood leukocytes and lung dendritic cells (6Chan C.

Hogaboam C.M. Kunkel S.L. Blood. 2008; 111: 1797-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). These chromatin modifications are associated with reversibly silencing one class of genes, which includes proinflammatory mediators, and sustaining or accentuating transcription activation of other classes of genes, including anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial mediators (3McCall C.E. Yoza B.K. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2007; 175: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The epigenetic transcription silencing of acute proinflammatory genes requires G9a-dependent dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9, recruitment of HP-1, CpG methylation of DNA, and assembly of H1 linker histone and high mobility group Box 1 (HMGB1) (7El Gazzar M. Yoza B.K. Hu J.Y. Cousart S.L. McCall C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 26857-26864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 8El Gazzar M. Yoza B.K. Chen X. Hu J. Hawkins G.A.

Biol. 2009; 29: 1959-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Information is limited on the nature of the molecular bridge between the transcription factors and epigenetic determinants. We discovered that de novo induction of NF-κB transcription factor RelB after TLR4 stimulation is necessary and sufficient for silencing transcription of TNFα and IL-1β in the SSI phenotype (8El Gazzar M. Yoza B.K. Chen X. Hu J. Hawkins G.A. McCall C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32198-32208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 19Yoza B.K. Hu J.Y. Cousart S.L. Forrest L.M. McCall C.E. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 4080-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We also found that RelB can function in the same cell type as a dual transcription regulator in the SSI phenotype to deactivate transcription of acute proinflammatory genes while activating transcription of the NF-κB regulator IκBα (20Chen X. Yoza B.K. El Gazzar M. Hu J.Y. Cousart S.L. McCall C.E. Clin. Vaccine Immunol. 2009; 16: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). RelB also participates in constitutive silencing of inflammatory genes in fibroblasts by a process that supports regional methylation of CpG DNA (21Kruys V. Thompson P. Beutler B. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 177: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and when normally silenced fibroblasts are rendered RelB−/−, they become responsive to LPS (22Xia Y. Chen S. Wang Y. Mackman N. Ku G. Lo D. Feng L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7688-7696Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we examined how RelB couples to epigenetically silence expression of acute proinflammatory genes and found that RelB initiates facultative heterochromatin formation by interacting with the histone H3 lysine methyltransferase G9a, which then mediates heterochromatin formation. THP-1 cells obtained from American Type Culture Collection were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 units/ml penicillin G, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. LPS-mediated tolerance that mimics the SSI phenotype in THP-1 cells was previously described (23LaRue K.E. McCall C.E. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 2269-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Briefly, LPS tolerance is generated by an initial stimulation with LPS (0111:B4; 1 μg/ml) for 16 h followed by re-stimulation with 1.0 μg/ml LPS for 3 h. This LPS acts exclusively through TLR4 receptor as determined in cells lacking TLR4. High concentrations of LPS are used to optimize the tolerant phenotype, although changes occur with doses as low as 10–100 ng/ml. Tolerance occurs within 3 h and sustains for at least 96 h (3McCall C.E. Yoza B.K. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 2007; 175: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Normal and LPS tolerant THP-1 cells (1 × 106 cells/sample) were washed once with RPMI 1640, re-suspended in fetal bovine serum supplemented RPMI 1640 medium at 1 × 106 cells/ml, and stimulated with LPS 1 μg/ml for 3 h. Low passage number and log-phase cells were used for all experiments. To assess p65, p50, RelB, G9a, HP1, and H3K9me2 binding to the IL-1β promoter in LPS tolerant and normal cells, ChIP assays (Upstate Biotechnology) were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions with the following modifications. Cells (5 × 106 cells/sample) were fixed by adding formaldehyde (from a 37% formaldehyde, 10% methanol stock (Calbiochem)) into the medium for a final formaldehyde concentration of 1% and incubated at room temperature for 10 min with gentle shaking. The chromatin was disrupted by sonication using a Diagenode Bioruptor (UCD-200TM-EX, Tosho Denk1 Co., Ltd). High power sonification (30 s on and 30 s off for 23 min) at this setting generated DNA fragments of ∼0.5–1.5 kilobases. Each sample was divided into two parts, providing an “input” sample that was not incubated with antibodies. The other portion was incubated overnight with antibodies specific for p65 (SC-372), p50 (SC-7178), RelB (SC-226), HP1 (SC-10215), and IgG (SC-2027) for the negative control (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and G9a (07–551) (Upstate Biotechnology). Purified DNA was re-suspended in 10 μl of distilled H2O. The method of co-IP ChIP was performed according to a previous report (24Li H. Rauch T. Chen Z.X. Szabó P.E. Riggs A.D. Pfeifer G.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19489-19500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were fixed and chromatin-sheared as above. Immunoprecipitation was conducted with IgG, anti-RelB, or anti-G9a and 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (50% slurry, Santa Cruz, SC-2003) with rotation overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were eluted by incubation with 10 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 30 min and diluted 1:50 in IP dilution buffer. Elutes were then re-immunoprecipitated with second antibodies. Purified DNA was resuspended in 10 μl of distilled H2O. The chromatin-immunoprecipitated DNA for each treatment was analyzed quantitatively for the amplification of the IL-1β promoter using specific primers (forward, 5′-cgtgggaaaatccagtattttaatg-3′, and reverse, 5′-caaatgtatcaccatgcaaatatgc-3′) and probe (5′-6-carboxyfluorescein-acatcaactgcacaacgattgtcaggaaaa-6-carboxytetramethylrhodamine-3′) (Applied Biosystems) as we used before. The real-time PCR reaction (total 25 μl) contained 3 μl of DNA, 12.5 μl of 2×TaqMan Universal Master Mix, 300 nm concentrations of each primer, and 100 nm dNTPs. The real-time PCR procedure was 2 min at 50 °C and 10 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles with 15 s at 95 °C and 1 min at 60 °C using the ABI Prism 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Data were normalized to the input DNA and are presented as -fold change relative to DNA from untreated cells. To measure IL-1β mRNA, total RNA was isolated at various times after LPS stimulation using RNA STAT-60, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). One microgram of RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA in a 20-μl volume containing 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dNTP, 2.5 μm oligo(dT), and 2.5 units/μl murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems). The PCR was performed using 4 μl of cDNA, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-pre-designed TaqMan primer/probe kits (Applied Biosystems) under the conditions described above. Data were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA and are presented as -fold change relative to mRNA from untreated cells. A standard PCR reaction (total 25 μl) containing 2 μl of ChIP DNA, 1 μm concentrations of each primer (as above), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.2 m dNTPs, and 0.03 units/μl AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) was performed to confirm the results of real-time PCR. The procedure was 1 cycle at 94 °C for 5 min, 35 cycles at 55 °C 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s each plus a final cycle at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were visualized on 1.5% agarose gels, and images were captured using Quantity One Imager (Bio-Rad). Total, nuclear, and cytoplasmic protein was assayed by Western blot. The methods for protein extraction are the same as we used before (19Yoza B.K. Hu J.Y. Cousart S.L. Forrest L.M. McCall C.E. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 4080-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). RelB, G9a, HP1, p65, p50, and HA antibodies (Santa Cruz) were used to visualize and quantify protein levels using ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). Pools of control (SC-37007), RelB-specific (SC-36402), G9a-specific (SC-43777), and HP1-specific (SC-37737) small interfering RNAs (siRNAs; Santa Cruz) were transfected by electroporation with 8 μl (0.5 μm) of siRNA in 100 μl of transfection medium (Nucleofector; Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD) as previously described (19Yoza B.K. Hu J.Y. Cousart S.L. Forrest L.M. McCall C.E. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 4080-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Each pool included three siRNA sequences that specifically target different sequence of the target gene to ensure specific knockdown. To check for off-target effects by siRNA, our previous experiments indicated that the expression of other inflammatory proteins, like IκBα and p65, is not affected by the introduction of these siRNA species into tolerant cells. In addition, Western blot data confirm that RelB or G9a knockdown by siRNA did not affect the expression of the reciprocal gene. Thus, no off-target effects have been identified. Immediately after transfection, cells were left unstimulated or treated with 1 μg/ml LPS to induce tolerance. After 48 h, cells were harvested, washed, and stimulated for 3 h with 1 μg/ml LPS. Cells were harvested, and RNA was isolated and used to determine the IL-1β mRNA expression levels. In vivo binding of G9a and RelB was assayed by IP. Cells (∼30 × 106) were harvested in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and washed with PBS. Then the cell pellet was suspended in EBS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 120 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitor) and incubated on ice for 30 min. After centrifugation of cell lysates (15 min, 14,000 × g, 4 °C), samples of supernatant termed “cell extract” were used for IP. Samples of total extract (1 mg of protein) plus 4 μg of G9a antibody (ab40542-100), RelB antibody (ab33907-100) (Abcam Biotechnology) or normal rabbit IgG (SC-2027) (Santa Cruz), and 40 μl of protein A/G beads (50% slurry, Santa Cruz, SC-2003) were incubated at 4 °C overnight with agitation. Beads were washed 6 times with NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 900 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) then washed once with NETN buffer with 100 mm NaCl before elution (95 °C, 5 min) of bound proteins in 100 μl of gel-loading buffer. Samples of eluted proteins were assayed Western blot and incubated with RelB or G9a antibody followed by appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and Super Signal Chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Procedures used for IP and Western blotting were identical in all experiments with quantities adjusted for scale of each. All observations were replicated at least three times. It has been shown that the C-terminal part of the Rel homology domain (between amino acids 264 and 379) is essential for effective RelB dimerization (25Ryseck R.P. Novotny J. Bravo R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3100-3109Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). RelB mutant (truncated RelB with amino acid 264–379 deleted) was generated by GenScript Corp. DNA fragments encoding N-terminal G9a (amino acids 1–500) and C-terminal G9a (amino acids 501–1000) were generated with the Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Applied Science) from human G9a pEGFP-C3 plasmid (kindly provided by Dr Yoichi Shinkai, Institute for Virus Research, Kyoto University). The primers used for amplifying the N-terminal G9a domain were 5′- aacagggatccagcatgagtgatgatgtccactcactgg-3′ (forward) and 5′-ctgtggaattcctcagttggctccagcctgcagcagcac-3′ (reverse). That for C-terminal G9a was 5′-aacagggatccagcatgataaatgcagtggacaaacagc-3′ (forward). Amplified DNA was cloned into the pGEX-4T-1 vector (GE Healthcare) and generated recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. The constructs were verified by automatic DNA sequencing, and their protein expression was confirmed by Western blotting. GST, GST N/C-terminal G9a plasmids were transformed into RosettaTM(DE3)pLysS Competent Cells from Novagen, and the protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside up to a concentration of 1 mm at 37 °C for 2.5 h. To generate [35S]Met-labeled proteins, RelB template generated with Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Applied Science) from pCDNA3-RelB (gift from Dr. G. Bren) was added to the TNT Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega). The primers used for producing RelB template were 5′-ggatcctaatacgactcactataggaacagccaccatgcttcggtctgggccagcctct-3′ (forward) and 5′-ctacgtggcttcaggccccggggataggaggcc-3′ (reverse). GST pulldown was performed using ProFound pulldown GST protein-protein interaction kit (Pierce). After pulldown, proteins were eluted out and analyzed by Western blot. Statistical analysis and graphic presentations were performed using Microsoft Excel XP. Results shown are the average of three experiments. Significance was taken at p < 0.05 (Student's t test). To test whether G9a and HP1 form a complex with RelB at the IL-1β promoter during transcription silencing, we employed the co-IP and ChIP assay that uses a sequel of primary and secondary antibodies to assess potential in vivo cooperation among promoter regulators. Using anti-RelB as the primary antibody and G9a and HP1 as secondary antibodies, we first demonstrated that a complex of the three proteins forms at the promoter of silenced cells (Fig. 1). Input DNA and IgG were used as controls. A similar paradigm occurred when we used G9a as the primary antibody and RelB and HP1 as secondary antibodies. Under these conditions, p65 did not accumulate at the promoter (not shown). Although these data suggest that a cooperative complex of the transcription factor and histone modifiers form at the silenced IL-1β promoter, they do not establish the functional relevance of this relationship nor do they establish whether the binding interactions of the three proteins are direct or indirect. To assess whether RelB might function as an initiating step in assembling facultative heterochromatin during transcription repression, we used RelB siRNA to determine the effect of removing RelB on the promoter binding of G9a and HP1. Immunoblotting confirmed the decreased expression of RelB protein after transfection with RelB siRNA without demonstrable changing the levels of G9a and HP1 proteins (Fig. 2A). After siRNA RelB knockdown, ChIP assays showed reduced enrichment of RelB, G9a, and HP1 at the IL-1β promoter compared with the results using control siRNA (Fig. 2B). The small insets show results using standard PCR, and the real-time PCR data are plotted as bar graphs. Three independent experiments were performed, and the observed changes were statistically significant. The disruption of the complex of transcription and chromatin mediators also correlated with reduced generation of the H3K9 dimethylation silencing mark and increased binding of p65 (not shown). Together, these results supported that the accumulation of G9a and HP1 at the IL-1β promoter is dependent on the presence of RelB and that together these chromatin modifiers may support a RelB-dependent shift in the histone code from activating to silencing through histone H3K9 dimethylation. We previously reported that transfection of wild type RelB represses transcription of IL-1β in LPS-responsive THP-1 cells (19Yoza B.K. Hu J.Y. Cousart S.L. Forrest L.M. McCall C.E. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 4080-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This approach was feasible as little RelB is expressed in LPS-responsive/normal cells, whereas de novo induction of RelB occurs in transcriptionally silenced THP-1 cells. To test whether we could induce interactions of RelB and G9a in vivo by increasing levels of RelB, we transfected a wild type (HA-RelB) plasmid or a plasmid containing a mutant of the RHD region of RelB to overexpress RelB in normal THP-1 cells. RelB protein expression increased in nuclear extracts from cells transfected with RelB wild type or RelB mutant (Fig. 3A); there was no effect of transfection on levels of G9a or HP1 proteins. Fig. 3B shows that transfection of RelB wild type, but not RelB RHD mutant, induced binding of both RelB and G9a to the IL-1β promoter. Fig. 3C depicts that reduced levels of IL-1β mRNA occurred after transfection of wild type RelB but not RelB RHD mutant. These data support that RelB initiates silencing by a process that requires the RHD domain and that nuclear levels of the protein may provide the rate-limiting step for silencing. Because RelB is both necessary and sufficient for transcription silencing (19Yoza B.K. Hu J.Y. Cousart S.L. Forrest L.M. McCall C.E. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 4080-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and because the data in this study thus far supported a RelB-dependent proximal process, we determined whether the transcription silencing activity of RelB is mediated by a link to G9a. To test this we used G9a-specific siRNA to deplete G9a protein, a process that did not substantially alter RelB or HP1 protein levels as assessed by immunoblotting (Fig. 4A). We then assessed whether depletion of G9a by siRNA would reverse silencing, as determined by mRNA analysis with control siRNA versus G9a siRNA. Fig. 4B shows that responsivity of the promoter to LPS stimulation of IL-1β mRNA is restored in the G9a knockdown. To determine the effect of the G9a knockdown on occupancy of the promoter by RelB and HP1 in the presence of reductions in G9a and reversal of transcription silencing, we used ChIP analysis. The results in Fig. 4C support that RelB remains bound to the IL-1β promoter (although at lower levels) after G9a knockdown, whereas HP1 and G9a are removed. This indicates that RelB silencing activity likely requires G9a-dependent modifications of chromatin. In the reverse experiment we knocked down HP1 by siRNA and measured RelB and G9a binding to the promoter. The results (Fig. 4D) showed no decrease both in RelB and G9a binding after HP1 depletion, suggesting that their assembly at the IL-1β promoter is proximal to HP1 binding. To test whether RelB and G9a proteins might directly interact, we used a series of co- immunoprecipitations. In vivo assessments included co-immunoprecipitations of native proteins in silenced cells and of normal cells transfected with the wild type HA-RelB. RelB and G9a were used as both primary and secondary antibodies in the in vivo assays. In vitro interactions of RelB and G9a were analyzed using GST pulldown assays. Both the N and C termini of G9a were linked to GST as fusion proteins. Fig. 5, A and B, show that RelB and G9a co-immunoprecipitate with primary or secondary antibodies after transfection of HA RelB and in silenced cells in the native state. This supports that RelB and G9a couple in vivo either directly or indirectly. Fig. 5B shows that in vitro translated RelB directly interacts with GST-linked G9a in vitro and that this interaction predominates at the N terminus (1–500 amino acids) of G9a. GST vector and resin alone controls were negative. The co-immunoprecipitation experiments were repeated three times under each condition. Togeth"
https://openalex.org/W1990705181,"The mqsR gene has been shown to be positively regulated by the quorum-sensing autoinducer AI-2, which in turn activates a two-component system, the qseB-qseC operon. This operon plays an important role in biofilm formation in Escherichia coli. However, its cellular function has remained unknown. Here, we found that 1 base downstream of mqsR there is a gene, ygiT, that is co-transcribed with mqsR. Induction of mqsR caused cell growth arrest, whereas ygiT co-induction recovered cell growth. We demonstrate that MqsR (98 amino acid residues), which has no homology to the well characterized mRNA interferase MazF, is a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis that functions by degrading cellular mRNAs. In vivo and in vitro primer extension experiments showed that MqsR is an mRNA interferase specifically cleaving mRNAs at GCU. The mRNA interferase activity of purified MqsR was inhibited by purified YgiT (131 residues). MqsR forms a stable 2:1 complex with YgiT, and the complex likely functions as a repressor for the mqsR-ygiT operon by specifically binding to two different palindromic sequences present in the 5'-untranslated region of this operon."
https://openalex.org/W2171616025,"An increasing body of empirical evidence suggests that cooperation among clone-mates is common in bacteria. Bacterial cooperation may take the form of the excretion of “public goods”: exoproducts such as virulence factors, exoenzymes or components of the matrix in biofilms, to yield significant benefit for individuals joining in the common effort of producing them. Supposedly in order to spare unnecessary costs when the population is too sparse to supply the sufficient exoproduct level, many bacteria have evolved a simple chemical communication system called quorum sensing (QS), to “measure” the population density of clone-mates in their close neighborhood. Cooperation genes are expressed only above a threshold rate of QS signal molecule re-capture, i.e., above the local quorum of cooperators. The cooperative population is exposed to exploitation by cheaters, i.e., mutants who contribute less or nil to the effort but fully enjoy the benefits of cooperation. The communication system is also vulnerable to a different type of cheaters (“Liars”) who may produce the QS signal but not the exoproduct, thus ruining the reliability of the signal. Since there is no reason to assume that such cheaters cannot evolve and invade the populations of honestly signaling cooperators, the empirical fact of the existence of both bacterial cooperation and the associated QS communication system seems puzzling. Using a stochastic cellular automaton approach and allowing mutations in an initially non-cooperating, non-communicating strain we show that both cooperation and the associated communication system can evolve, spread and remain persistent. The QS genes help cooperative behavior to invade the population, and vice versa; cooperation and communication might have evolved synergistically in bacteria. Moreover, in good agreement with the empirical data recently available, this synergism opens up a remarkably rich repertoire of social interactions in which cheating and exploitation are commonplace."

The yeast mutants lack detectable neutral lipids and cytoplasmic lipid droplets and are strikingly sensitive to unsaturated fatty acids. Expression of human diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 in the yeast mutants was sufficient to reverse these phenotypes. Similar to mammalian cells, fatty acid-mediated death in yeast is apoptotic and presaged by transcriptional induction of stress-response pathways, elevated oxidative stress, and activation of the unfolded protein response. To identify pathways that protect cells from lipid excess, we performed genetic interaction and transcriptional profiling screens with the yeast acyltransferase mutants. We thus identified diacylglycerol kinase-mediated phosphatidic acid biosynthesis and production of phosphatidylcholine via methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine as modifiers of lipotoxicity. Accordingly, the combined ablation of phospholipid and triglyceride biosynthesis increased sensitivity to saturated fatty acids. Similarly, normal sphingolipid biosynthesis and vesicular transport were required for optimal growth upon denudation of triglyceride biosynthesis and also mediated resistance to exogenous fatty acids. In metazoans, many of these processes are implicated in insulin secretion thus linking lipotoxicity with early aspects of pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome.

In metazoans, many of these processes are implicated in insulin secretion thus linking lipotoxicity with early aspects of pancreatic β-cell dysfunction, diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome. Lipotoxicity, the phenomenon of cell death due to lipid imbalance, is a common consequence of obesity and likely influences many of the morbidities associated with this syndrome, including diabetes and atherosclerosis. The mechanisms by which an imbalance in lipid metabolism culminates in cell death differ for each offending metabolite and surprisingly are poorly understood. For example, saturated and unsaturated fatty acids are pro-apoptotic in most cell types (1McGarry J.D. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar) but achieve this through different pathways (for review see Ref. 2Garbarino J. Sturley S.L. Curr. Opin. Clin. Nutr. Metab. Care. 2009; 12: 110-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The cytotoxicity of saturated fatty acids such as palmitate likely arises from elevated ceramide levels and/or reactive oxygen species (3Listenberger L.L. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 14890-14895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 4Holland W.L. Brozinick J.T. Wang L.P. Hawkins E.D. Sargent K.M. Liu Y. Narra K. Hoehn K.L.

By contrast, the accumulation of oleate, an unsaturated fatty acid, promotes apoptosis through activation of serine/threonine protein phosphatases such as PP2Cα/β (5Schwarz S. Hufnagel B. Dworak M. Klumpp S. Krieglstein J. Apoptosis. 2006; 11: 1111-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Similarly, subcellular cholesterol accumulation induces cellular stress responses such as the unfolded protein response pathway, apoptosis, and necrosis (6Feng B. Yao P.M. Li Y. Devlin C.M. Zhang D.

Any process that limits the accumulation of lipid alcohols (such as diacylglycerol and sterols) or fatty acids is likely to be cytoprotective. One such reaction is their mutual co-esterification to produce neutral lipids (e.g. triglyceride (TG) 8The abbreviations used are: TGtriacylglycerolACATacyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferaseCLDcytoplasmic lipid dropletDAGdiacylglycerolsDGATDiacylglycerol AcyltransferaseSEsteryl esterORFopen reading frameGFPgreen fluorescent proteinROSreactive oxygen speciesDHRdihydrorhodamineUPRunfolded protein responseERendoplasmic reticulumPIpropidium iodideeMAPEpistatic Mini Array ProfilingUFAunsaturated fatty acidSFAsaturated fatty acidNLneutral lipid. or steryl ester (SE)). Subsequently, these lipids are sequestered in cytoplasmic lipid droplets (CLDs), the preponderance of which correlates with lipotoxic states such as obesity and fatty liver disease (7Chang B.H. Chan L. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2007; 292: G1465-G1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To date, three acyltransferase gene families independently direct the terminal and committed steps of neutral lipid synthesis in eukaryotes (8Turkish A. Sturley S.L. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2007; 292: G953-G957Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In mammals, the esterification of sterol is accomplished by members of the acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) family or in serum by lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase. ACAT members carry out the reaction in an acyl-CoA-dependent fashion, whereas lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase uses phospholipids as an acyl donor. Diacylglycerol (DAG) esterification is primarily the activity of DGAT2 (a member of the diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) 2 gene family) or DGAT1 (a member of the ACAT family). triacylglycerol acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase cytoplasmic lipid droplet diacylglycerols Diacylglycerol Acyltransferase steryl ester open reading frame green fluorescent protein reactive oxygen species dihydrorhodamine unfolded protein response endoplasmic reticulum propidium iodide Epistatic Mini Array Profiling unsaturated fatty acid saturated fatty acid neutral lipid.

DAG esterification during the logarithmic phase of growth is mediated by Lro1p (a lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase ortholog that uses DAG and phospholipids as substrates (13Oelkers P.

Sturley S.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2005; 33: 1182-1185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We show here that elimination of neutral lipid biosynthesis results in contrasting effects of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids on cellular metabolism and viability and that this primarily reflects differential channeling of fatty acids into phospholipids. We describe the use of genetic interaction screens and transcriptional profiling to identify pathways that interact with the neutral lipid acyltransferases (see also Ref. 18Petschnigg J. Wolinski H.

Defects in several components of endoplasmic reticulum homeostasis impose limitations on growth of ARE1, ARE2, LRO1, or DGA1 mutants, implicating them as evolutionarily conserved components of lipid homeostasis that protect a cell from lipotoxicity.

Fatty acid growth studies were performed using YPD or SCD supplemented with 0.6% ethanol/tyloxapol (5:1, v/v) and the indicated amounts of fatty acids (Sigma or Nu-Check Prep Inc; 10% (w/v) stock in ethanol). For cell viability assays, aliquots from 2-ml YPD precultures were washed twice in distilled H2O and plated as serial dilutions or used to inoculate YPD or YPD oleate such that the starting optical density was 0.4 (A600 nm). Cultures were grown for 18 h, plated onto YPD, incubated for 2 days at 30 °C, and colonies counted. 30° growth curves were obtained using a Microbiology Workstation Bioscreen C (Thermo Electron Corp.) and Research Express Bioscreen C software (Transgalactic Ltd.). Cultures (three isolates per genotype) were normalized to an A600 of 0.1, and 10 μl of each strain was added to 290 μl of media per well.

Yeast cells were grown in appropriate media supplemented with 20× adenine to minimize autofluorescence of the vacuole associated with ade2 mutants. For CLD analysis, cells were stained with Nile Red (1 μg/ml) or envisaged for GFP reporters using a long pass GFP filter (excitation 440 nm). Cell viability using the FUN1 stain was determined using Yeast LIVE/DEAD viability kit (Molecular Probes).

Neutral lipids represent a safe harbor for cytotoxic lipids enabling cells to efficiently store lipid precursors in a biologically inert form.

Surprisingly, the sterol content of membranes, fluid phase endocytosis, and pH and the proteolytic capability of the vacuole in the mutants were equivalent to control strains as determined by staining with lipophilic dyes (Filipin, MDY-64, LysoSensor Green DND-189, carboxy-DCFDA, and CMAC-Arg, respectively; data not shown). By contrast, we discovered that the protein composition of the CLD organelle is responsive to changes in neutral lipids. 3-Keto sterol reductase (ERG27) fused to GFP (37Mo C. Milla P. Athenstaedt K.

However, loss of TG synthesis in the dga1Δ lro1Δ strains or complete loss of neutral lipids in the quadruple mutant resulted in Erg27-GFP retention at the ER (Fig. 1A). Another critical role of neutral lipid biosynthesis is to provide important membrane and energy reserves, most likely in response to nutrient limitation to the cell. Under such circumstances, diploid yeast differentiate (sporulate) to the haploid state and accumulate neutral lipids, both within and between daughter cells, the latter presumably of maternal origin (Fig. 1B) (38Esposito M.S.

Microbiol. 1976; 22: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 40Henry S.A. Halvorson H.O. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 114: 1158-1163Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We generated homozygous quadruple acyltransferase mutants (2n) that were completely deficient in neutral lipid accumulation and observed a severe block in spore formation (Fig. 1B). After 8 days in nitrogen-deficient media, 4.3% of quadruple mutant cells had sporulated versus 62.5% of control diploid cells (averaged over multiple fields of view). This suggests a requirement for neutral lipids and/or CLDs or alternatively an inhibitory effect of lipid substrate accumulation during early sporulation, perhaps at entry into meiosis. The viability of mutants in the neutral lipid biosynthetic pathway was surprising given the key role these enzymes play in metabolite storage and detoxification. We reasoned this is likely due to regulatory responses to an overabundance of the precursors to these reactions, i.e. alcohols (sterols or diacylglycerols) and fatty acids, as well as the utilization of alternate systems that bypass the toxic effects of free fatty acids. In mammalian systems this homeostasis initiates at the transcriptional level (41Ou J. Tu H. Shan B. Luk A. DeBose-Boyd R.A. Bashmakov Y. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 6027-6032Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar, 42Hannah V.C. Ou J. Luong A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

We therefore profiled the transcriptional status of are1Δ are2Δ (SE-deficient), lro1Δ dga1Δ (TG-deficient), and are1Δ are2Δ lro1Δ dga1Δ (lacking neutral lipids) strains using Affymetrix oligonucleotide microarrays (supplemental Tables S2–S5). The data, generated in triplicate, were analyzed using linear modeling (see “Experimental Procedures”). Yeast cells deficient in sterol esterification have reduced ergosterol biosynthetic rates and maintain free ergosterol at levels equivalent to control cells (9Yang H. Bard M. Bruner D.A. Gleeson A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 31190-31196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, there was no evidence of statistically significant transcriptional regulation of the sterol biosynthetic pathway in sterol esterification-defective strains. The major pathways influenced by loss of sterol esterification determine or respond to membrane status (e.g. down-regulation of vesicular transporters such as Uso1p, Cog7p, and Dsl1p). We also observed a statistically significant decrease in the expression of several components of iron metabolism such as the iron-responsive transcriptional regulator AFT1 and Aft1p target genes such as FET3. These results (supplemental Tables S2 and S3) were confirmed via Northern blotting (Fig. 2A). Many steps in ergosterol biosynthesis incorporate iron into their structure in various forms as follows: as a mono- or binuclear species, as a part of an Fe-S cluster, or as heme groups (44Andrews S.C. Robinson A.K. Rodríguez-Quiñones F. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 27: 215-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1832) Google Scholar). These observations indicate an unexpected feedback interaction between iron and sterol homeostasis that may confer an alternate avenue by which sterol biosynthesis is regulated. Triglyceride deficient dga1Δ lro1Δ mutants exhibited a statistically significant reduction in multiple key components of phospholipid homeostasis relative to control strains. The positive transcriptional regulator INO2 and its targets CHO1, CHO2, PSD1, OPI3, and EPT1 were down-regulated in the mutant cells (supplemental Tables S2 and S4 and Fig. 2B). There is an intimate relationship between triglycerides and phospholipids; both biosynthetic pathways converge through common intermediates (diacylglycerol and fatty acids); thus it is not surprising that they are coordinately regulated. Total ablation of neutral lipid biosynthesis led to many changes in gene expression (supplemental Tables S2 and S5), many of which were confirmed by Northern hybridizations or quantitative real time PCR (Fig. 2). Consistent with the are1Δ are2Δ or dga1Δ lro1Δ double mutants, the quadruple mutant strain also displayed decreased expression of genes involved in iron and phospholipid metabolism. Additionally, we observed statistically significant decreases in several genes responsible for ergosterol biosynthesis, namely ERG3, ERG4, and ERG5 (supplemental Table S6 and Fig. 2A). Thus it appears that loss of the CLD compartment, as arises when neutral lipids are absent, has a more significant impact on the lipid transcriptome than does loss of steryl ester or TG alone. To provoke a viability response to neutral lipid deficiency, we incubated yeast cells with increasing concentrations of saturated or unsaturated free fatty acids, reasoning that these were common substrates to all of the enzymes under study and would reach toxic levels in the deletion strains. All cells, regardless of genotype, absorbed equivalent levels of free fatty acids (∼5 pmol/mg cell dry weight, based on radiolabeled metabolic incorporation studies). The saturated fatty acids palmitate (C16:0) and stearate (C18:0, data not shown) had no detectable impact on the viability of these strains (Fig. 3A). By contrast, unsaturated fatty acids such as oleate (C18:1) were toxic to strains lacking normal levels of triglyceride synthesis (Fig. 3B). This was more striking in the quadruple deletion strains lacking neutral lipid biosynthesis, where severe growth inhibition was observed with concentrations as low as 0.1 mm (data not shown). The shortening of the chain length (e.g. palmitoleate, C16:1, see Fig. 3C) or increasing the degree of unsaturation (e.g. linoleate, 18:2, data not shown) further exacerbated this lipotoxicity. In the case of oleate treatment, a pronounced lag phase was followed by a virtually normal growth rate. Palmitoleate toxicity is more severe; the cells never enter log phase of growth. Interestingly, are1Δ are2Δ strains lacking sterol esterification were unaffected by exogenous fatty acids. The mechanism that underlies the death of UFA-treated neutral lipid-deficient yeast cells is likely multifactorial. To confirm that restoration of TG biosynthesis was sufficient to restore cell viability, we expressed a human DGAT2 cDNA in these mutants (Fig. 3, D and E), an approach used previously to characterize mammalian neutral lipid biosynthesis (25Turkish A.R. Henneberry A.L. Cromley D. Padamsee M. Oelkers P. Bazzi H. Christiano A.M. Billheimer J.T. Sturley S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 14755-14764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Expression of human DGAT2 in these yeast strains resulted in a marked elevation of TG synthesis (supplemental Fig. S1), complete rescue of the oleate-induced inviability of the quadruple deletion strain (Fig. 3D), and deposition of NL in cytoplasmic lipid droplets as observed by Nile red staining (Fig. 3E). This is a critical observation that suggests it is the accumulation of TG precursors or loss of the CLD compartment that limits the growth of the TG-deficient strains. To assess the primary cellular response to fatty acids in the context of neutral lipid deficiency, we assessed global gene expression changes between control and are1Δ are2Δ lro1Δ dga1Δ strains grown for 6 h in sub-lethal concentrations of oleate (0.01 mm, see supplemental Table S6). Differential gene expression between control and mutant cells was determined by p value (p ≤ 0.05) or by using the T-profiler algorithm, which correlates microarray expression data with DNA sequences immediately upstream of the ORFs (45Boorsma A. Foat B.C. Vis D. Klis F. Bussemaker H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W592-W595Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S2). Despite the absence of a growth phenotype at this concentration of UFA, expression of all genes classified under the GO category “stress response” were increased relative to control strains (supplemental Fig. S2A). Four consensus motifs associated with differential gene expression summarize the data (Table 1). This includes an overall higher expression of genes containing the stress response-related RLM1 (366 ORFs) and STRE (960 ORFs) consensus motifs compared with that of all other genes on the microarray (positive T-value). Concomitant with the increase in stress-responsive genes was a general decrease of genes involved in transcription, RNA, ribosome, and protein metabolism (supplemental Fig. S2B), including RNA polymerase III subunits RPC17 and RPC34. The rRPE and PAC consensus motifs found on genes associated with rRNA and ribosome biosynthesis (1297 and 248 ORFs, respectively) displayed a negative T-profiler value indicating an overall decrease in expression of genes within this category (Table 1). Thus, even at sub-lethal concentrations, it is"
https://openalex.org/W2075364726,"Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are currently investigated clinically as cellular therapy for a variety of diseases. Differentiation of MSC toward endodermal lineages, including hepatocytes and their therapeutic effect on fibrosis has been described but remains controversial. Recent evidence attributed a fibrotic potential to MSC. As differentiation potential might be dependent of donor age, we studied MSC derived from adult and pediatric human bone marrow and their potential to differentiate into hepatocytes or myofibroblasts in vitro and in vivo. Following characterization, expanded adult and pediatric MSC were co-cultured with a human hepatoma cell line, Huh-7, in a hepatogenic differentiation medium containing Hepatocyte growth factor, Fibroblast growth factor 4 and oncostatin M. In vivo, MSC were transplanted into spleen or liver of NOD/SCID mice undergoing partial hepatectomy and retrorsine treatment. Expression of mesenchymal and hepatic markers was analyzed by RT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. In vitro, adult and pediatric MSC expressed characteristic surface antigens of MSC. Expansion capacity of pediatric MSC was significantly higher when compared to adult MSC. In co-culture with Huh-7 cells in hepatogenic differentiation medium, albumin expression was more frequently detected in pediatric MSC (5/8 experiments) when compared to adult MSC (2/10 experiments). However, in such condition pediatric MSC expressed alpha smooth muscle more strongly than adult MSC. Stable engraftment in the liver was not achieved after intrasplenic injection of pediatric or adult MSC. After intrahepatic injection, MSC permanently remained in liver tissue, kept a mesenchymal morphology and expressed vimentin and alpha smooth muscle actin, but no hepatic markers. Further, MSC localization merges with collagen deposition in transplanted liver and no difference was observed using adult or pediatric MSC. In conclusion, when transplanted into an injured or regenerating liver, MSC differentiated into myofibroblasts with development of fibrous tissue, regardless of donor age. These results indicate that MSC in certain circumstances might be harmful due to their fibrogenic potential and this should be considered before potential use of MSC for cell therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2070938244,"Paneth cells are a secretory epithelial lineage that release dense core granules rich in host defense peptides and proteins from the base of small intestinal crypts. Enteric alpha-defensins, termed cryptdins (Crps) in mice, are highly abundant in Paneth cell secretions and inherently resistant to proteolysis. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that enteric alpha-defensins of Paneth cell origin persist in a functional state in the mouse large bowel lumen. To test this idea, putative Crps purified from mouse distal colonic lumen were characterized biochemically and assayed in vitro for bactericidal peptide activities. The peptides comigrated with cryptdin control peptides in acid-urea-PAGE and SDS-PAGE, providing identification as putative Crps. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry experiments showed that the molecular masses of the putative alpha-defensins matched those of the six most abundant known Crps, as well as N-terminally truncated forms of each, and that the peptides contain six Cys residues, consistent with identities as alpha-defensins. N-terminal sequencing definitively revealed peptides with N termini corresponding to full-length, (des-Leu)-truncated, and (des-Leu-Arg)-truncated N termini of Crps 1-4 and 6. Crps from mouse large bowel lumen were bactericidal in the low micromolar range. Thus, Paneth cell alpha-defensins secreted into the small intestinal lumen persist as intact and functional forms throughout the intestinal tract, suggesting that the peptides may mediate enteric innate immunity in the colonic lumen, far from their upstream point of secretion in small intestinal crypts."

In the study, we generated two transgenic pigs by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) that express green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by cytomegalovirus (CMV). Absolute quantitative real-time PCR and bisulfite sequencing were performed to determine transgene copy number and promoter methylation level. The correlation of transgene expression with copy number and promoter methylation was analyzed in individual development, fibroblast cells, various tissues, and offspring of the transgenic pigs. Our results demonstrate that transgene expression is associated with copy number and CMV promoter methylation in transgenic pigs."

However, lesions are often extensive and heterogeneous, thus making it difficult to establish precise functional anatomical correlates. Here, we provide a connective neural account in the aim of accommodating the main principles of the DRC framework and to make predictions on reading skill. We located prominent reading areas using fMRI and applied structural equation modeling to pinpoint distinct neural pathways. Functionality of regions together with neural network dissociations between words and pseudowords corroborate the existing neuroanatomical view on the DRC and provide a novel outlook on the sub-regions involved. In a similar vein, congruent (or incongruent) reliance of pathways, that is reliance on the word (or pseudoword) pathway during word reading and on the pseudoword (or word) pathway during pseudoword reading predicted good (or poor) reading performance as assessed by out-of-magnet reading tests. Finally, inter-individual analysis unraveled an efficient reading style mirroring pathway reliance as a function of the fingerprint of the stimulus to be read, suggesting an optimal pattern of cerebral information trafficking which leads to high reading performance."
https://openalex.org/W1984932018,"Salmonella enterica encodes two virulence-related type III secretion systems in Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 and 2, respectively. These systems mediate the translocation of protein effectors into the eukaryotic host cell, where they alter cell signaling and manipulate host cell functions. However, the precise role of most effectors remains unknown. Using a genetic screen, we identified the small, reduction/oxidation-regulatory protein thioredoxin as a mammalian binding partner of the Salmonella effector SlrP. The interaction was confirmed by affinity chromatography and coimmunoprecipitation. In vitro, SlrP was able to mediate ubiquitination of ubiquitin and thioredoxin. A Cys residue conserved in other effectors of the same family that also possess E3 ubiquitin ligase activity was essential for this catalytic function. Stable expression of SlrP in HeLa cells resulted in a significant decrease of thioredoxin activity and in an increase of cell death. The physiological significance of these results was strengthened by the finding that Salmonella was able to trigger cell death and inhibit thioredoxin activity in HeLa cells several hours post-infection.

Protein secretion is a basic function in all groups of bacteria. Many secretion systems have been found in Gram-negative bacteria, from the relatively simple type I secretion systems to the complex type III or type IV machines or the recently described type VI systems (reviewed in Refs. 1Filloux A.

The T3SS is a protein export pathway that spans the inner membrane, periplasmic space, outer membrane, and host cell membrane. These complex structures are related to flagella and consist of at least 20 different subunits that enable the bacteria to translocate substrates into the cytosol of the eukaryotic host cell (reviewed in Ref. 3Ghosh P. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2004; 68: 771-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). These systems have also been referred to as injectisomes or molecular needles (4Cornelis G.R. Nat. Rev.

Proteins secreted and translocated into eukaryotic cells through T3SS are called “effectors.” These effectors have the ability to suppress host defense signaling. Effectors of plant pathogens may target salicylic acid- and abscisic acid-dependent defenses, host vesicle trafficking, or interfere with host RNA metabolism. Effectors from animal pathogens modify the cytoskeleton to facilitate bacterial entry, modulate Rho GTPases and NF-κB, inhibit the host inflammatory response, elicit death of immune cells, and disrupt both adaptative and innate immune responses (reviewed in Ref. 5Stavrinides J. McCann H.C. Guttman D.S. Cell. Microbiol. 2008; 10: 285-292PubMed Google Scholar). Salmonella enterica produces two distinct T3SS essential for virulence that are encoded by genes located in Salmonella pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 (SPI-1 and SPI-2), respectively. The SPI-1 T3SS secretes at least 16 proteins: AvrA, GogB, SipA, SipB, SipC, SipD, SlrP, SopA, SopB/SigD, SopD, SopE, SopE2, SptP, SspH1, SteA, and SteB (6Coombes B.K. Wickham M.E. Brown N.F.

Six of them have been shown to regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics (reviewed in Ref. 9Ly K.T. Casanova J.E. Cell.

However, the biochemical functions of most of them remain unknown (reviewed in Ref. 10Ramsden A.E. Holden D.W. Mota L.J. Trends Microbiol. 2007; 15: 516-524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The conventional paradigm, supported by in vivo and in vitro studies, is that the SPI-1-encoded T3SS is required for the invasion of M cells and cultured epithelial cells (11Jones B.D. Ghori N. Falkow S. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar, 12Penheiter K.L. Mathur N. Giles D. Fahlen T. Jones B.D. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 24: 697-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) as well as for the inflammatory response of the intestinal cells, and that the SPI-2-encoded T3SS is essential for replication and survival within macrophages and the progression of a systemic infection (13Kuhle V. Hensel M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2812-2826Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that the boundaries between SPI-1 and SPI-2 function are not sharply defined: some SPI-1 effectors are detected hours or days after infection and SPI-2-encoded genes may be expressed before penetration of the intestinal epithelium. In addition, as can be noticed comparing the lists of effectors above, some effectors, including SlrP, can be secreted by both T3SS. SlrP (for Salmonella leucine-rich repeat protein) was identified as a S. enterica serovar Typhimurium host range factor by signature-tagged mutagenesis (14Tsolis R.M. Townsend S.M. Miao E.A. Miller S.I. Ficht T.A. Adams L.G. Bäumler A.J. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6385-6393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A mutant in this gene has no difference in virulence with the wild-type strain when infecting calves but is 6-fold attenuated for mouse virulence after oral infection. This gene is located in a 2.9-kb DNA region with features of horizontal acquisition and has similarity to yopM from Yersinia spp. and ipaH from Shigella flexneri. The predicted protein contains 10 copies of a leucine-rich repeat signature, a protein motif frequently involved in protein-protein interactions. Other members of the leucine-rich repeat family in Salmonella are the effectors SspH1 and SspH2, which share 39 and 38% amino acid identity with SlrP, respectively. Similarity in the amino-terminal region of these three proteins helped to define a translocation signal that was also found in four other T3SS effectors: SifA, SifB, SseI, and SseJ (15Miao E.A. Miller S.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 7539-7544Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Although SlrP can be delivered into mammalian cells by both T3SS, its expression seems to be induced by RtsA, one of the main regulators of SPI-1, independently of HilA or InvF (16Ellermeier C.D. Slauch J.M. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5096-5108Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Although the function of SlrP was completely unknown, the presence of leucine-rich repeats in this protein suggested that it may bind eukaryotic proteins during infection. In addition, recent reports have shown an enzymatic activity, E3 ubiquitin ligase, for effectors of the same family (17Quezada C.M. Hicks S.W. Galán J.E. Stebbins C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4864-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 18Rohde J.R. Breitkreutz A. Chenal A. Sansonetti P.J. Parsot C. Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 1: 77-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In this work we demonstrate that SlrP interacts with mammalian thioredoxin-1 (Trx). We also show that SlrP is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that can use Trx as a substrate. Our results support a model in which interaction of SlrP with Trx leads to a decrease in thioredoxin activity and triggers host cell death.

The final reaction volumes were 50 μl, and the final concentration of MgCl2 was 1.5 mm. Reagents were used at the following concentrations: dNTPs, 200 μm; primers, 1 μm; and Taq polymerase (ExpandTM High Fidelity PCR System, Roche Diagnostics SL), 1 unit per reaction. The thermal program included the following steps: (i) initial denaturation, 2 min at 94 °C; (ii) 25 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 30 s), annealing (55 °C, 30 s), and extension (72 °C, 1 to 3 min); and (iii) final incubation at 72 °C for 7 min, to complete extension. Primers are listed in Table 2. cDNA from positive clones obtained in the two-hybrid screen, PCR constructs, and mutations were sequenced with an automated DNA sequencer (Sistemas Genómicos, Valencia, Spain). Sequence analysis was performed with molecular biology algorithms from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI). The standard culture medium for S. enterica and Escherichia coli was LB broth. Solid LB contained a final concentration of 1.5% agar. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations for kanamycin (Km), 50 μg/ml, and ampicillin, 100 μg/ml. Plasmids were introduced into Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains using the lithium acetate procedure, as previously described (20Sherman F. Fink G.R. Hicks J.B. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). A human HeLa Matchmaker cDNA library (Clontech) pretransformed in S. cerevisiae strain Y187 was screened using yeast mating, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, S. cerevisiae strain AH109 transformed with pIZ1627 was grown at 30 °C overnight with shaking in yeast drop-out medium lacking tryptophan. The culture was concentrated, mixed with 1 ml of the library in 45 ml of 2× YPDA, containing 2% yeast extract, 4% peptone, 4% glucose, and 0.006% adenine hemisulfate, and incubated at 30 °C overnight with gentle swirling. The mating mixture was plated in SD medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine (Clontech). Plates were incubated at 30 °C for 8 days and then colonies were patched on the same medium and replica-plated on medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, histidine, and adenine and in medium lacking leucine and tryptophan and supplemented with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-α-d-galactopyranoside (X-α-gal), to check for the expression of the ADE2 and MEL1 reporters, respectively. Positive clones were rescued, tested for specificity using empty pGBT10, and sequenced with primer T7. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin were included in the culture media. All cells were maintained in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. For cell lysis, 2 × 107 to 108 cells/ml were incubated at 4 °C in Nonidet P-40 buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) or in Triton X-100 buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm EDTA, 1% aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 μg/ml leupeptin) for 20 min. The extract was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min and the supernatant was stored at −80 °C. For transient transfection assays, 2–5 × 106 HeLa cells/assay were resuspended in 200 μl of 15 mm HEPES-buffered serum-containing medium, mixed with 50 μl of 210 mm NaCl containing 5–10 μg of plasmid DNA, and electroporated using a BTX Electrocell Manipulator 600 set at 240 volts, 720 ohm, and 950 microfarads. Cells were processed 24 h after electroporation. For stable transfection, HeLa cells were electroporated with pcDNA3 or pcDNA3 derivatives and selection was started 24 h after electroporation in medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418. Expression of the GST fusion proteins was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside to bacteria containing pGEX-4T-1, pGEX-4T-3, or their derivatives and the fusion proteins were isolated from bacterial lysates by affinity chromatography with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma). For lysis, bacteria were sonicated in Nonidet P-40 buffer. For some binding experiments, lysates from S. enterica strain SV5193 were incubated for 2 h with fusion protein bound to glutathione-coupled agarose beads. The precipitates were washed six times in Nonidet P-40 buffer followed by SDS-PAGE. The gel was blotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies (1:10,000; Sigma). Goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies (Bio-Rad) were used as secondary antibodies. Detection was via chemiluminescence procedures (Pierce). For some binding experiments GST-Trx was treated with an oxidizing reagent according to a previous report (21Nishiyama A. Matsui M. Iwata S. Hirota K. Masutani H. Nakamura H. Takagi Y. Sono H. Gon Y. Yodoi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21645-21650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). Briefly, GST-Trx bound to glutathione-agarose beads was treated with 1 mm H2O2 in Nonidet P-40 buffer for 15 min and then washed 6 times with buffer before incubation with bacterial lysates. As a control to revert oxidation, a part of the H2O2-treated fusion protein was incubated with buffer containing 100 mm DTT for 15 min after washing and before incubation with lysate. Lysates from HeLa cells cotransfected with plasmids pIZ1720 and pIZ1721, expressing SlrP-3×FLAG and 3×HA-Trx, respectively, were incubated with protein A/G plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation the supernatants were incubated for 2 h with monoclonal anti-FLAG antibodies or preimmune serum, overnight with protein A/G plus-agarose beads, and then centrifuged. The beads were washed five times in Nonidet P-40 buffer. Proteins were eluted and dissolved into Laemmli sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.0005% bromphenol blue) containing 5% β-mercaptoethanol, incubated at 95 °C for 5 min, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter and probed with anti-FLAG (Sigma) and anti-HA-peroxidase (clone 3F10, Roche). Mutants Cys546 to Ala (C546A) in SlrP and double mutant Cys32 and Cys35 to Ser (C32S/C35S) in Trx were made in the pGEX or pcDNA3 vectors using the “QuikChange® II Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit” (Stratagene). Primers used are listed in Table 2. Ubiquitination reactions were performed in a 40-μl mixture containing buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm DTT), 2 μg of HA-tagged ubiquitin (Boston Biochem), 0.5 μg of human recombinant E1 (Boston Biochem), and 2 μg of E2 (human recombinant UbcH5b from Boston Biochem) in the presence or absence of 1 μg of GST-SlrP, GST-SlrP(C546A), or GST-Trx. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and stopped by the addition of an equal volume of Laemmli sample buffer containing 100 mm DTT. Reaction mixtures were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane, and probed with specific antibodies. Some reaction mixtures were immunoprecipitated with anti-Trx antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and then submitted to immunoblot analysis. Trx activity assay was performed in 96-well plates with an end point insulin assay (22Arnér E.S. Zhong L. Holmgren A. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 300: 226-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 23Luthman M. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 6628-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). For the reactions, cell lysates with 40 μg of total protein were mixed with 3.8 μl of 1.7 mm Trx reductase from rat liver (Sigma), 20 μl of a 1:12 mixture of solution N (40 mg/ml β-NADPH) and solution M (210 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 790 μm insulin, 20 mm EDTA) and TE (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 20 mm EDTA) to reach a total volume of 50 μl. The reaction solutions without Trx reductase were used as the control, which was subtracted. After the reaction was performed at 37 °C for 30 min, 200 μl of 1 mm 5,5′-dithiobis(nitrobenzoic acid) in 6 m guanidine hydrochloride solution was added to stop the reaction and the absorbance was read at 412 nm. The percentage of HeLa cell death was determined by measuring lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release in confluent cultures using the CytoTox 96 nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay kit (Promega), following instructions provided by the manufacturer. Percentage cytotoxicity was calculated as 100 × (experimental LDH release − spontaneous LDH release)/(maximum LDH release − spontaneous LDH release), where spontaneous LDH release was the level detected in a non-confluent HeLa cell culture. Two days before the infection, 250,000 HeLa cells/well were seeded in 6-well plates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) and grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in media without antibiotics. Bacteria were grown overnight in LB broth with 0.3 m NaCl at 37 °C without shaking, and were added to HeLa cells to reach a multiplicity of infection of 50 bacteria/eukaryotic cell. Sixty minutes after the infection, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in fresh Dulbecco's modified essential medium containing 100 μg/ml gentamicin. Sixty minutes later the concentration of gentamicin was lowered to 16 μg/ml and the incubation was continued for an additional 6 or 14 h. Each Trx activity or percent cell death is the mean of at least three independent experiments. Student's t test was used to compare different strains or conditions. p values of 0.05 or less are considered significant. The initial hypothesis for this work was that SlrP interacts with one or more host proteins after translocation by a T3SS. To identify potential mammalian partners, SlrP from S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain 14028 was fused to the DNA binding domain (DB) of the yeast Gal4 transcriptional activator and used as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system. This fusion was coexpressed in yeast with a HeLa cDNA library fused to the activation domain (AD) of Gal4. Plasmid pGBT10 (24Chardin P. Camonis J.H. Gale N.W. van Aelst L. Schlessinger J. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1993; 260: 1338-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) was used as a DB vector and 2 × 106 clones were screened. Fifteen colonies were able to grow in synthetic medium lacking histidine, used to select for the interactions. Most of these positive clones also expressed the additional reporter genes ADE2 and MEL1. The candidate AD plasmids were subsequently tested for reporter gene activation with another construct (pGBKT7-p53) and with the empty DB vector. Sequencing of the specific clones revealed that three of them, termed s3, s5, and s14, carried the complete coding sequence for human Trx, although in the wrong reading frame, which could be explained through the production of frameshifted polypeptides (25Fromont-Racine M. Rain J.C. Legrain P. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). To verify the interactions, the complete open reading frame present in clone s3 was cloned in-frame in pGADT7 and pGBT10 and tested for interaction with SlrP expressed in fusion with Gal4 DB from pGBT10 or with Gal4 AD from pGADT7, respectively. As seen in Fig. 1, the interaction detected with the original clones was confirmed with the in-frame construction, as well as the switched vectors. The result obtained with the two-hybrid system was confirmed by two independent approaches. For the first approach, DNA encoding a 3×FLAG epitope was introduced at the 3′ end of slrP in the chromosome of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain 14028 to generate strain SV5193. This strain was then transformed with plasmid pGEX4T-1, expressing GST alone, or with plasmid pIZ1712, a derivative of pGEX4T-1 coding for a GST-Trx fusion protein. GST and GST-Trx were purified from bacterial lysates using glutathione-agarose beads and analyzed by immunoblot with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies. As seen in Fig. 2A, SlrP-3×FLAG copurified with GST-Trx but not with GST, showing the specificity of the interaction. Because this interaction can only take place in vivo in the host cell, we decided to investigate if both proteins could coimmunoprecipitate from mammalian cell lysates. HeLa cells were cotransfected with two derivatives of plasmid pCS2, one expressing SlrP-3×FLAG and the other expressing 3×HA-Trx. Lysates were prepared, SlrP-3×FLAG was immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies, and the presence of 3×HA-Trx in the immunoprecipitation complex was investigated by immunoblot with anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 2B). Trx was clearly coimmunoprecipitated with SlrP. On the other hand Trx was not detected when using a preimmune serum instead of the anti-FLAG antibodies, showing again the relevance and specificity of this interaction. Trx contains a conserved active site with two cysteines that are essential for its redox activity. We decided to investigate if this site was necessary for interaction with SlrP as it is known for other Trx partners (26Junn E. Han S.H. Im J.Y. Yang Y. Cho E.W. Um H.D. Kim D.K. Lee K.W. Han P.L. Rhee S.G. Choi I. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6287-6295Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). GST, GST-Trx, and GST-Trx(C32S/C35S), a Cys32 and Cys35 mutant, were purified from E. coli BL21(DE3). GST proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with lysates of strain SV5193, expressing SlrP-3×FLAG. After washing, the complexes were analyzed by immunoblot with anti-FLAG antibodies. Fig. 3A shows that both the wild-type and the mutant forms of Trx are able to interact with SlrP, suggesting that the integrity of the active site is not necessary for this interaction. Next we investigated if the redox status of Trx could be relevant for the interaction. For this purpose, GST-Trx bound to glutathione-agarose beads was treated with H2O2 before the in vitro interaction assay. As seen in Fig. 3B, this oxidative treatment significantly reduced the interaction. Importantly, this effect was reverted by reduction with DTT. Recent reports demonstrated that IpaH9.8, a Shigella type III secretion effector, and the Salmonella effectors SspH1 and SspH2, are E3 ubiquitin ligases (17Quezada C.M. Hicks S.W. Galán J.E.

Cell Host Microbe. 2007; 1: 77-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) and that the isolated carboxyl-terminal domain of SlrP also has this activity (17Quezada C.M. Hicks S.W. Galán J.E. Stebbins C.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 4864-4869Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). We decided to test if the entire SlrP protein also had E3 ubiquitin ligase activity on Trx. In vitro reactions were performed in the presence of HA-ubiquitin, E1, the E2 enzyme UbcH5B, and GST-SlrP. Anti-HA immunoblot revealed the presence of several bands that appeared only when GST-SlrP was included in the reactions. These bands corresponded in size to oligomers of HA-ubiquitin (Fig. 4A, third lane), indicating that SlrP can direct the polyubiquitination of ubiquitin. Because Trx interacts with SlrP, we used GST-Trx as a possible substrate in ubiquitin reactions. The fourth lane in Fig. 4A shows additional bands detected with anti-HA. Importantly, the immunoblot with anti-Trx (Fig. 4B) revealed in addition to GST-Trx, some larger species that formed only in the presence of GST-SlrP, suggesting that SlrP is an E3 ubiquitin ligase for human Trx.

Both bile pigments have reducing properties, and bilirubin is now generally considered to be a potent antioxidant, yet it remains unclear how it protects cells against oxidative damage. A presently popular explanation for the antioxidant function of bilirubin is a redox cycle in which bilirubin is oxidized to biliverdin and then recycled by BVR. Here, we reexamined this putative BVR-mediated redox cycle. We observed that lipid peroxidation-mediated oxidation of bilirubin in chloroform, a model of cell membrane-bound bilirubin, did not yield biliverdin, a prerequisite for the putative redox cycle. Similarly, H2O2 did not oxidize albumin-bound bilirubin to biliverdin, and in vitro oxidation of albumin or ligandin-bound bilirubin by peroxyl radicals gave modest yields of biliverdin. In addition, decreasing cellular BVR protein and activity in HeLa cells using RNA interference did not alter H2O2-mediated cell death, just as BVR overexpression failed to enhance protection of these cells against H2O2-mediated damage, irrespective of whether bilirubin or biliverdin were added to the cells as substrate for the putative redox cycle. Similarly, transformation of human BVR into hmx1 (heme oxygenase) mutant yeast did not provide protection against H2O2 toxicity above that seen in hmx1 mutant yeast expressing human heme oxygenase-1. Together, these results argue against the BVR-mediated redox cycle playing a general or important role as cellular antioxidant defense mechanism.

Cycling the Wagons for Biliverdin ReductaseJournal of Biological ChemistryVol. 284Issue 46PreviewThis letter was prompted by our reading of the article by Maghzal et al. (1). Bilirubin (BR) is a major physiologic antioxidant cytoprotectant. Tissue levels are only in nanomolar concentrations, because high levels are neurotoxic, yet BR protects against micromolar levels of oxidants because of a cycle wherein biliverdin (BV) generated by BR antioxidant action is efficiently reconverted by biliverdin reductase (BVR) to BR (2). Additional evidence for the cycle includes the extraordinary antioxidant potency of BR and augmented levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid oxidation, and susceptibility to cell death in BVR-depleted tissues (2, 3).

This pathway is initiated by heme oxygenase, which converts heme to carbon monoxide, iron, and biliverdin, which in turn is reduced to bilirubin by BVR at the expense of NADPH. Because of its intramolecular hydrogen bonding, the bilirubin produced is sparingly soluble in water at physiological pH and ionic strength (1McDonagh A.F. The Porphyrins.in: Dolphin D. Academic Press, Inc., New York1979: 293-491Crossref Google Scholar). Hence, bilirubin is usually tightly bound to albumin in order to be transported within the blood circulation (2Brodersen R. CRC Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1980; 11: 305-399Crossref Scopus (210) Google Scholar), from which it is removed mainly through uptake by hepatocytes. Once bilirubin is transferred across the cell membrane of hepatocytes, it binds glutathione S-transferases before being transformed to water-soluble derivatives by conjugation of one or both of its propionyl groups before its excretion into bile and then the intestine (3Fevery J. Van de Vijver M. Michiels R. Heirwegh K.P. Biochem.

Under physiological conditions, plasma bilirubin concentrations in humans range from ∼5 to 20 μm, practically all of which is unconjugated pigment bound to albumin (1McDonagh A.F. The Porphyrins.in: Dolphin D. Academic Press, Inc., New York1979: 293-491Crossref Google Scholar). Abnormally high plasma concentrations are associated with the risk of developing neurologic dysfunction due to preferential deposition of bilirubin in brain and its toxic effects on cell functions. In fact for many years, biliverdin and bilirubin were generally regarded as waste products of heme metabolism in higher animals, although earlier work suggested that these bile pigments might play a role as natural antioxidants, since small quantities of the pigment stabilize vitamin A and β-carotene during intestinal uptake, and animals with low plasma bilirubin showed early signs of vitamin E deficiency (4Bernhard K. Ritzel G. Steiner K.U. Helv. Chim. Acta. 1954; 37: 306-313Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 5Kaufmann H.P. Garloff H. Fette Seifen Anstrichm. 1961; 63: 334-344Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In a series of in vitro studies, Stocker et al. (6Stocker R. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 8130-8134Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 7Stocker R. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N.

Science. 1987; 235: 1043-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (2921) Google Scholar) demonstrated that unconjugated bilirubin, at micromolar concentrations, efficiently scavenged peroxyl radicals in homogenous solution or multilamellar liposomes. At physiologically relevant oxygen tension, bilirubin surpassed α-tocopherol as an antioxidant in liposomes (8Stocker R. Yamamoto Y. McDonagh A.F. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Science. 1987; 235: 1043-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (2921) Google Scholar), and it is thought to protect plasma proteins and lipids from many but not all oxidants (9Stocker R. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 2004; 6: 841-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). However, it is less clear whether this antioxidant activity extends to in vivo situations or protection of cells from oxidative stress. Although produced in essentially all cells, the normal range of cellular bilirubin concentrations is unknown. However, it is probably in the low nanomolar range, well below that of established cellular antioxidants, such as glutathione and ascorbate, arguing against bilirubin being an important cellular antioxidant. Nonetheless, in vitro studies with rat neuronal cultures showed that the presence of 10 nm bilirubin in the culture medium protected cells against 10,000-fold higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (10Doré S. Takahashi M. Ferris C.D. Zakhary R. Hester L.D. Guastella D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 2445-2450Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Later, Barañano et al. (11Baranano D.E. Rao M. Ferris C.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16093-16098Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar) confirmed such observations in HeLa cells and demonstrated that BVR depletion increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell death. This led to the following proposal of the BVR-amplified redox cycle. While acting as an antioxidant, bilirubin is oxidized to biliverdin that is then reduced back to bilirubin by the ubiquitous and abundant BVR. An important underlying assumption of this amplification cycle is that ROS-mediated bilirubin oxidation in cells is specific and yields substantial if not stoichiometric amounts of biliverdin. Inconsistent with this assumption, however, earlier studies showed that high yields of biliverdin formation are limited to certain oxidants (i.e. peroxyl radicals) and albumin-bound bilirubin. In cells, bilirubin is probably present in membranes, bound to proteins other than albumin, or present in conjugated form. Therefore, we reexamined the putative redox amplification cycle. Our results show that reaction of these forms of bilirubin with 1e- or 2e-oxidants at best generates modest amounts of biliverdin. Furthermore, overexpression of BVR does not protect mammalian or yeast cells from hydrogen peroxide-mediated damage, thereby casting doubt on the importance of the putative BVR redox cycle for cellular antioxidant protection. HPLC grade methanol and glacial acetic acid were obtained from Scharlau (Barcelona, Spain). 2,2′-Azobis(2-amidinopropane)hydrochloride (AAPH) and 2,2′-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrite) (AMVN) were obtained from Wako Pure Chemical Industries (Japan). Biliverdin hydrochloride, bilirubin ditaurate, and bilirubin IXα were purchased from Frontier Scientific (Logan, UT). Equine serum albumin was obtained from U.S. Biological (Swampscott, MA). Penicillin/streptomycin, trypsin, Opti-MEM, l-glutamine, and 5(6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate were purchased from Invitrogen. Polyclonal rabbit anti-biliverdin reductase antibody was obtained from Stressgen Bioreagents (Ann Arbor, MI), and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). FuGENE® HD transfection reagent and protease inhibitor mixture tablet were obtained from Roche Applied Science. Nitrocellulose membranes were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Solutions of NaCl (0.9%) were obtained from Baxter (Munich, Germany), NaOH pellets were from Merck, and phosphate-buffered saline tablets (Dulbecco A) were from Oxoid (Cambridge, UK). Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) was purchased from SAFC Biosciences, and fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from JRH Biosciences. All other reagents and chemicals were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. The concentration of commercial H2O2 (30%; British Drug House, UK) was determined using ϵ240 nm = 43.6 m−1 cm−1 and then diluted appropriately to the concentrations indicated throughout. Bilirubin dissolved in 50 mm NaOH was added to either equine glutathione S-transferase (GST) or essentially fatty acid-free human serum albumin in 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.3). For human serum albumin, purified linoleic acid, dissolved in methanol, was added as an aqueous dispersion, and the solution was stirred gently at 4 °C until it became clear, as described previously (7Stocker R. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 5918-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). An aliquot of cold AAPH (500 mm) was then added. The final concentrations of reactants were as follows: 50 μm GST or 500 μm human serum albumin containing 2 mm linoleic acid, 20 μm bilirubin, and 50 mm AAPH. The oxidation was initiated by placing the reaction tube in a water bath set at 37 °C. For some oxidation by H2O2, we used glucose in the presence of glucose oxidase to generate H2O2 at a constant rate. Briefly, 1.5 units/ml glucose oxidase from Aspergillus niger (low catalase activity) dissolved in PBS and containing 50 μm diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) was added to GST (final concentration 50 μm) or a clear solution of bilirubin bound to human serum albumin containing purified linoleic acid and prepared as described above. Oxidation was initiated by adding 5 mm d-glucose and placing the reaction tube at 37 °C. Aliquots (100 μl) of the reaction mixture were removed at the time points indicated, and the pigments were extracted with 400 μl of ice-cold methanol. After centrifugation at 13,600 × g for 5 min, 100 μl of the supernatant was subjected to HPLC analysis. Cold AAPH (50 mm final concentration) was added to bilirubin (20 μm) dissolved in DMSO, and oxidation was carried out under air and at 37 °C. Alternatively, AMVN (50 mm) was added to bilirubin (100 μm) dissolved in chloroform, and the oxidation again started at 37 °C. For oxidation of conjugated bilirubin, AAPH (50 mm) or 5 mm d-glucose and 1.5 units/ml glucose oxidase in 50 μm DTPA was added to bilirubin ditaurate (100 μm) dissolved in PBS. Oxidation was initiated by placing the reaction tubes at 37 °C. At the time points indicated, aliquots (100 μl) of the reaction mixture were removed and subjected to HPLC. Separation of biliverdin and bilirubin was achieved using an analytical LC-18 column, 25 cm × 4.6 mm (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA), eluted with 0.1 m di-n-octylamine acetate in methanol and water (96:4, v/v) at 1 ml/min, as described previously (12Stocker R. McDonagh A.F. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, biliverdin and bilirubin eluted at 5 and 12 min, respectively. Biliverdin was detected at 380 or 665 nm, whereas bilirubin was detected at 460 nm. Bile pigments were quantified by their peak area comparison with standard curves constructed from authentic standards. For the separation of bilirubin and biliverdin conjugates, 0.1 m di-n-octylamine acetate in 80% methanol/20% water (v/v) was used as the mobile phase eluted at 1 ml/min. The retention time of bilirubin ditaurate was ∼22 min, and that of its putative biliverdin conjugate ∼15 min. Bilirubin ditaurate and biliverdin ditaurate were detected at 460 and 665 nm, respectively. To quantify biliverdin ditaurate, non-conjugated biliverdin was used as standard due to the unavailability of biliverdin ditaurate. HeLa cells were cultured in low glucose DMEM, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37 °C, and the medium was replaced every 3–4 days. At 90% confluence, cells were disrupted with 0.15% trypsin and 1 mm EDTA for 5 min, washed, and plated in new culture plates and flasks for experiments. Total RNA was extracted from HepG2 cells by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and converted to cDNA with a Superscript first strand synthesis kit (Invitrogen). BVRA was then amplified by PCR with Amplitaq (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), using the primer pair 5′-TTATAGGATCCAAGATGAATGCAGAGCCCG-3′ and 5′-CAGAAGGATCCATCTTGGAAGTGCTACATCA-3′. The thermocycle used was as follows: 1 cycle of 94 °C for 3 min; 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1 min; 1 cycle of 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR product was resolved on a 1.5% agarose gel and purified using a gel purification kit obtained from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). The purified cDNA was then cloned into pGEM-T easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI) and transformed into TOP10 chemically competent cells (Invitrogen). The pGEM-T easy-BVR construct was propagated, purified with the QIAPREP spin miniprep kit (Qiagen), and digested with BamHI (Fermentas, Glen Burnie, MD) to excise the BVR cDNA. pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) was also digested with BamHI and treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Invitrogen). Both the BVR cDNA and pcDNA3 vector were resolved and purified from a 1% agarose gel and then ligated with LigaFast quick DNA ligation kit (Promega). The pcDNA3-BVR plasmid was digested with NotI (Fermentas) to identify clones with correct insert orientation. The construct was also sequenced to ensure fidelity. A galactose-inducible multicopy plasmid containing human HO-1 was constructed in the yeast vector pESC-LEU (Stratagene). A pGEM-T easy-HO-1 construct was propagated, purified with QIAPREP Spin miniprep kit (Qiagen), and digested with EcoRI (Fermentas) to excise the HO-1 cDNA. pESC-LEU vector was also digested with EcoRI and treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Invitrogen). Both the HO-1 cDNA and pESC-LEU vector were resolved and purified from a 1% agarose gel and then ligated with LigaFast quick DNA ligation kit (Promega) to produce pESC-LEU-HO-1. A galactose-inducible multicopy plasmid containing BVRA was constructed in the yeast vector pESC-LEU-HO-1 described above. The pGEM-T easy-BVRA construct was propagated, purified with the QIAPREP spin miniprep kit (Qiagen), and digested with BamHI (Fermentas) to excise the BVRA cDNA. pESC-LEU-HO-1 vector (described above) was also digested with BamHI and treated with calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (Invitrogen). Both the BVRA cDNA and pESC-LEU-HO-1 vector were resolved and purified from a 1% agarose gel and then ligated with LigaFast quick DNA ligation kit (Promega), to produce pESC-LEU-HO-1-BVRA. Transient overexpression of BVR in HeLa cells was achieved using FuGENE® HD transfection reagent 24 h after cell seeding, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-BVR was diluted with Opti-MEM prior to the addition of transfection reagent. The FuGENE® HD/plasmid ratio was 3:1. After a 20-min incubation at room temperature, the FuGENE® HD-DNA complexes were added to the cells in DMEM, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were then grown for 16–24 h before being subjected to various assays. Endogenous BVR expression was decreased using small interfering RNA. Briefly, HeLa cells (∼3 × 105 cells/well) in 24-well plates were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS for 18 h. Cells were then transfected with an equal combination (60 pmol total) of three siRNAs targeted against human BVR (DNA sense sequences 5′-GCACGAGGAGCATGTTGAACTCTTG-3′, 5′-TCCTCAGCGTTCCTGAACCTG-3′, and 5′-AGAGGTGGAGGTCGCCTATATC-3′) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were then incubated for 48 h in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS before being subjected to assays. As a control, cells were transfected with 60 pmol scrambled siRNA (medium negative control stealth RNAi; Invitrogen; catalogue number 12935-300). The scrambled siRNA was not a match to any sequence in the human BLAST data base. Cell viability was determined by the trypan blue exclusion method or the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazl-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetraxolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cells were seeded at 3 × 105, 1 × 105, and 7.5 × 104 cells/well into a 6-well, 12-well, and 96-well plate, respectively, for cell viability measurement by the trypan blue exclusion method. Two vials of cells were collected for each time point, one containing the spent medium with floating dead cells and the other containing trypsinized live cells still attached to the plate after medium collection and one wash with PBS. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 720 × g for 5 min, and cells were resuspended in an adequate volume of culture medium. Aliquots of cell suspension (10 μl) were then stained with 10 μl of 0.4% trypan blue solution. Approximately 100 cells were counted, and cell viability was calculated as follows: percentage of cell viability = ((total cells − dead cells)/total cells) × 100. For the MTT assay, cells in DMEM plus 10% FBS were seeded in 24-well plates and treated as described. At the time points indicated, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed with PBS. Fresh medium (200 μl) and MTT (1 mm) were then added, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 before medium was removed. The dark blue crystals in the cells were then dissolved by adding 150 μl of DMSO, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. Finally, 20 μl of the resulting mixture were diluted in 100 μl of DMSO, and its absorbance at 570 nm was determined using a plate reader. Cell viability was calculated as percentage of cell viability = (A570 nm of treated cells/A570 nm of untreated cells) × 100. Cells were grown to exponential phase (A600 = 1) in synthetic-defined medium at 30 °C and then treated for 1 h with H2O2 (0–20 mm). Aliquots of cells were removed, diluted in fresh YEPD medium, and plated in triplicate on YEPD plates, and the number of viable colonies was counted after 3 days of growth. BVR activity was determined by the formation of bilirubin using ϵ450 nm = 53.0 mm−1 cm−1 (12Stocker R. McDonagh A.F. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells lysed with 200 μl of PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100 were scraped and collected into an Eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. An aliquot of the resulting supernatant corresponding to 200 μg of protein (determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay) was then added to an NADPH-generating system in a plastic cuvette at the following final concentrations: 200 μg of cellular protein, 5–50 μm biliverdin added as DMSO solution, 2 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 1 unit of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 1 mm NADPH in Buffer A (PBS containing 250 mm d-glucose, 20 mm Tris, and one protease inhibitor mixture tablet, pH 7.3). The final volume of the reaction mixture was 1 ml. The reaction was monitored in a spectrophotometer (Beckman DU 800) for 120 min at 37 °C. The bilirubin generated was detected by reading absorbance at 450 nm and quantified using ϵ450 nm = 53.0 mm−1 cm−1. ROS levels were determined using 5(6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate, as described previously (13Wang H. Joseph J.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 612-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1985) Google Scholar) with modifications. HeLa cells in 24-well plates were transfected for 18–24 h with empty vector or human BVR, as described above. On the day of the experiments, cells were washed with PBS and then incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with dichlorofluorescein diacetate (100 μm, dissolved in DMSO) in DMEM plus 1% FBS. Following incubation, cells were washed with Krebs buffer and treated with the indicated concentration of H2O2 in Krebs. Fluorescence of the cells in each well was then measured every 5 min for 30 min in a fluorescence plate reader maintained at 37 °C. Excitation was set at 485 nm, and emission was detected at 538 nm. ROS levels in H2O2-treated cells were determined as the change in fluorescence over 30 min compared with untreated cells. Mammalian cells were lysed in PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease inhibitors. Yeast cell lysates were prepared by breaking cells in 50 mm KPB, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA supplemented with protease inhibitors on a vortex in the presence of acid-washed glass beads for 45 s and then placed on ice for 30 s. Western blotting analysis was performed on lysates by loading equal amounts of protein (8–15 μg) onto 10% polyacrylamide gels (NU-PAGE, Invitrogen) using SeeBlue® Plus2 (Invitrogen) as molecular mass standards. Electrophoresis was performed at 200 V for 90 min using a MiniProtean II electrophoresis system (Invitrogen XCell Surelock system), and separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences) at 30 V for 90 min using a miniblot module (NOVEX, San Diego, CA). The blotted membranes were blocked in 5% (w/v) skim milk powder with 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline for 3–4 h at room temperature. Blocked membranes were probed overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies at 1:2000 dilutions in 5% (w/v) skim milk and Tween 20-containing Tris-buffered saline: rabbit polyclonal antibody against human BVR (StressGen); rabbit polyclonal antibody against human HO-1 (StressGen); mouse monoclonal antibody against human α-tubulin (Sigma). Membranes were then probed for 1 h at room temperature with sheep anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Bio-Rad) (1:5,000 dilution) in 1% skim milk and 0.1% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline. Proteins were detected by ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). For yeast cell lysates, HO-1 and BVR were detected essentially the same as above, but primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 3% bovine serum albumin and Tween 20-containing Tris-buffered saline. Yeast cells were grown to exponential phase (A600 = 1), cells were broken in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) on a vortex in the presence of acid-washed glass beads for 45 s followed by placement on ice for 30 s; and the RNA was then extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript III first strand synthesis system for reverse transcription-PCR. Statistical differences between treatments and controls for BVR activity were examined using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney rank sum test. Where appropriate, data were analyzed using a two-factor repeated measures analysis of variance with post hoc Bonferroni test. Significance was accepted at p < 0.05. An important underlying assumption of the BVR-catalyzed oxidation-reduction cycle proposed by Barañano et al. (11Baranano D.E. Rao M. Ferris C.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16093-16098Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar) is that oxidation of bilirubin is specific and yields substantial if not stoichiometric amounts of biliverdin. Since bilirubin is lipophilic and essentially insoluble in water, the pigment associates with either proteins or lipids. We therefore examined the yield of biliverdin formation using bilirubin bound to albumin or GST and aqueous peroxyl radicals derived from thermolabile AAPH as the oxidant. Albumin and GST are extra- and intracellular binding proteins of bilirubin, respectively (14Gollan J.L. Schmid R. Prog. Liver Dis. 1982; 7: 261-283PubMed Google Scholar), whereas peroxyl radicals were used as a model for hydroperoxyl radicals (i.e. the protonated superoxide radical). Albumin-bound bilirubin was oxidized rapidly by peroxyl radicals (Fig. 1A), as reported earlier (7Stocker R. Glazer A.N. Ames B.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1987; 84: 5918-5922Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Under the conditions used, peroxyl radicals were produced at ∼3 μmol/min, and bilirubin oxidation was complete in 20 min. This time point coincided with maximal accumulation of biliverdin to ∼30% of the initial bilirubin concentration (Fig. 1A). Subsequently, biliverdin became oxidized, as indicated by the time-dependent decrease in the concentration of that pigment (Fig. 1A). Peroxyl radicals also effectively oxidized GST-bound bilirubin, with complete consumption observed within 15 min. In contrast to the situation with albumin-bound bilirubin, there was only a modest accumulation of biliverdin, corresponding to <10% of the initial bilirubin concentration (Fig. 1B). Similarly, peroxyl radicals effectively oxidized bilirubin ditaurate, a model of the water-soluble, conjugated bilirubin, but the corresponding biliverdin ditaurate was a minor oxidation product only (Fig. 1C). We next investigated the oxidation of bilirubin by H2O2, since 10 nm bilirubin has been shown to protect cells from damage caused by a 10,000-fold molar excess of H2O2 (10Doré S. Takahashi M. Ferris C.D. Zakhary R. Hester L.D. Guastella D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1999; 96: 2445-2450Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 11Baranano D.E. Rao M. Ferris C.D. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 16093-16098Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). In sharp contrast to peroxyl radicals, albumin-bound bilirubin was essentially resistant to H2O2, a non-radical oxidant that was generated at constant rate using glucose oxidase plus glucose, with negligible biliverdin being detected (Fig. 1D). We chose conditions such that the rate of H2O2 generation was 5 μmol/min (i.e. similar to the rate at which we employed peroxyl radicals that readily oxidized bilirubin). Intere"

However, the structural basis for ion selectivity of paracellular pores is poorly understood. Here we applied cysteine scanning to map the paracellular pathway of ion permeation across claudin-2-transfected Madin-Darby canine kidney type I cells. Four potential pore-lining amino acid residues in the first extracellular loop were mutated to cysteine and screened for their accessibility to thiol-reactive reagents. All mutants were functional except D65C, which formed dimers by intermolecular disulfide bonding, leading to a loss of charge and size selectivity. This suggests that claudin-2 pores are multimeric and that Asp65 lies close to a protein-protein interface. Methanethiosulfonate reagents of different size and charge and the organic mercury derivate, p-(chloromercuri)benzenesulfonic acid, significantly decreased paracellular ion permeation across I66C-transfected cells by a mechanism that suggests steric blocking of the pore. The conductance of wild-type claudin-2 and the other cysteine mutants was only weakly affected. The rate of reaction with I66C decreased dramatically with increasing size of the reagent, suggesting that Ile66 is buried deep within a narrow segment of the pore with its side group facing into the lumen. Furthermore, labeling with N-biotinoylaminoethyl methanethiosulfonate showed that I66C was weakly reactive, whereas Y35C was strongly reactive, suggesting that Tyr35 is located at the protein surface outside of the pore.

Sheets of polarized epithelia constitute barriers that separate fluid compartments of different chemical composition and mediate exchange of solutes and ions via transcellular and paracellular pathways. A large body of evidence suggests that transport via the paracellular pathway occurs through pores in the tight junctions that are formed by tetraspan membrane proteins, known as claudins (1Furuse M.

Our current understanding of paracellular pores is that they are size- and charge-selective water-filled channels that, in contrast to channels for transmembrane transport, are oriented parallel instead of perpendicular to the lipid layer of the cell membrane. Size exclusion experiments suggest a pore diameter of 6.4–8 Å (4Van Itallie C.M. Holmes J. Bridges A. Gookin J.L. Coccaro M.R. Proctor W. Colegio O.R. Anderson J.M. J.

Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis and overexpression of claudins in epithelial cells identified the first extracellular domain as playing an important role in the charge selectivity of paracellular transport (6Colegio O.R.

The first extracellular domain of claudins contains various basic and acidic amino acids, some of which are conserved in different claudin isoforms, and these could be involved in the mechanism of ion permeation. Several studies have demonstrated homo- or heterotypic interaction of claudins, suggesting that paracellular pores are formed by oligomers of claudins (9Blasig I.E. Winkler L. Lassowski B.

Taken together, significant progress has been made in uncovering the nature of the paracellular pathway and mechanisms of selectivity of paracellular ion permeation. However, it is unknown how the extracellular domains of claudins fold to form paracellular pores and which amino acid residues line the pathway of ion diffusion. Epithelia in vivo and epithelial cell lines express characteristic sets of different claudin isoforms that determine paracellular permeability and permselectivity. Claudin-2 is expressed in epithelia with a high capacity for passive paracellular cation transport, such as the epithelium lining the proximal renal tubules (12Enck A.H. Berger U.V. Yu A.S. Am. J.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4969-4976Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar), suggesting a physiologic role of claudin-2 in creating paracellular Na+ channels. Because of the high signal/noise ratio of the claudin-2-induced permeability, this isoform provides an excellent model to study paracellular transport. We have recently generated a stable expression system of claudin-2 in MDCK I cells under the control of a TetOff promoter. This inducible system allows us to specifically determine the macroscopic conductance and permeability of claudin-2 pores by subtracting background measurements of uninduced cells. Using this expression system, we could recently demonstrate that the cation selectivity of claudin-2 cells is mediated by electrostatic interaction of partially dehydrated permeating cations with aspartate 65 (5Yu A.S.

The substituted cysteine accessibility method (SCAM), developed by the Karlin group, has proved to be a powerful tool in the mapping of the structures of membrane ion channels and transport proteins (15Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A. Science. 1992; 258: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 16Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). In SCAM, thiol-reactive reagents are used to covalently modify endogenous cysteines, or cysteines introduced into a protein by site-directed mutagenesis. SCAM can be used to study channel-lining amino acid side chains, the secondary structures of membrane-spanning segments, and the localization of selectivity filters, channel gates, and inhibitor binding sites. Here, we used SCAM to analyze the paracellular pathway of ion permeation across claudin-2 transfected MDCK I cells. Our data show that thiol-reactive reagents strongly block ion transport in at least one of the cysteine mutants that we have generated and, thus, provide a tool to map residues that line the paracellular pore. MDCK I TetOff cells expressing wild-type (WT) and mutant claudin-2 were generated by methods described previously (5Yu A.S. Cheng M.H. Angelow S. Günzel D. Kanzawa S.A. Schneeberger E.E. Fromm M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 17350-17359Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In brief, cysteine mutants of mouse claudin-2 were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). cDNA of WT mouse claudin-2 and cysteine mutants were ligated into the retroviral Tet response vector, pRevTREP, and lipofected into the viral packaging line, PT67. Stable transfected cells were selected with hygromycin. Retrovirus encoding mouse claudin-2 was produced and transduced into MDCK I Tet-Off cells, and stable clonal cell lines were selected in hygromycin using cloning cylinders. To induce claudin-2 expression, doxycycline was omitted from the culture medium starting from the day of plating (Dox−), whereas in control plates, 20 ng/ml doxycycline was added to the culture medium to suppress expression (Dox+). Electrophysiological studies were generally performed after 7 days. The expression and localization of claudin-2 was tested by immunofluorescence staining by methods described before (18Angelow S. El-Husseini R. Kanzawa S.A. Yu A.S. Am. J. Physiol. Renal. Physiol. 2007; 293: F166-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) using a 1:200 dilution of claudin-2 antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.). Double labeling with anti-ZO-1 (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) was used to confirm the correct localization of claudin-2 to the tight junction. Claudin-2 protein expression and oligomerization was tested by immunoblotting. Confluent cells, grown on tissue culture dishes, were homogenized in buffer (pH 7) containing 0.25 m sucrose, 30 mm histidine, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors (Complete Mini; Roche Applied Science). Cell lysates were mixed as indicated with non-reducing loading buffer (pH 6.8; containing 2% (w/v) SDS) or reducing loading buffer (1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol added to non-reducing buffer) and heated for 10 min at 80 °C. The samples were loaded on a 15% denaturing polyacrylamide gel in aliquots of 10 μg of protein and analyzed as described before (18Angelow S. El-Husseini R. Kanzawa S.A. Yu A.S. Am. J. Physiol. Renal. Physiol. 2007; 293: F166-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) using claudin-2 antibody (1:1000; Invitrogen). The effect of claudin-2 on the expression of endogenous claudins was assessed by immunoblotting with antibodies to claudin-1, -3, -4, and -7 (Invitrogen). The accessibility of WT and mutant claudin-2 to MTSEA-biotin was tested as follows. Cells were grown in 6-well plates (10 cm2) for 6 days. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated on the apical side with 0.5 mg/ml MTSEA-biotin (Toronto Research Chemicals) in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm CaCl2 and MgCl2 for 5 min at 4 °C. The reaction was stopped by washing the cells with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were harvested and homogenized in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (pH 8; 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) deoxycholic acid, 0.1% (w/v) SDS). Insoluble material was sedimented by brief centrifugation at 16,000 × g, and biotinylated protein was precipitated from the supernatant using streptavidin-coated agarose beads (Pierce) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and mixed with reducing loading buffer, and attached protein was released by heating the beads to 80 °C for 10 min. The samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above using claudin-2 antibody (Invitrogen). Ussing chamber diffusion potential measurements to determine ion permeabilities were performed as described recently (5Yu A.S. Cheng M.H. Angelow S. Günzel D. Kanzawa S.A. Schneeberger E.E. Fromm M. Coalson R.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2009; 133: 111-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at confluent density on Snapwell filters (Corning Glass) and cultured for 7 days, which is sufficient to achieve steady-state transepithelial resistance (19Angelow S. Kim K.J. Yu A.S. J. Physiol. 2006; 571: 15-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The filters were mounted in Ussing chambers and stirred with gas lifts in 100% O2 at 37 °C. A pair of voltage-sensing electrodes made of Ag/AgCl pellets and current-passing electrodes of Ag wire were immersed into the apical and basolateral medium via agar bridges containing 3 m KCl. The electrodes were connected via head stage amplifiers to a microcomputer-controlled voltage/current clamp (VCC-MC6) and data were acquired at 1-s intervals using Acquire and Analyze software (Physiologic Instruments, San Diego, CA). Data shown in time-independent experiments are usually averages of 3–6 data points. The standard Ringer solution used at base line contained 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm Tris-HEPES, at pH 7.4. For measurements of the NaCl dilution potential the medium of the basolateral chamber was replaced by Ringer solution containing 75 mm NaCl (osmolarity adjusted with mannitol). For alkali metal bi-ionic potentials, the basolateral medium was switched to a solution containing a 150 mm concentration of the alkali metal cation-chloride salt. For organic cation diffusion potentials, we used a solution containing 75 mm of the organic cation-chloride salt and 75 mm NaCl. Diffusion potentials were determined as the apical voltage with respect to the basolateral side. Liquid junction potentials at the tip of the agar bridges were estimated with blank filters in place and used to correct the data, as recently described (5Yu A.S. Cheng M.H. Angelow S. Günzel D. Kanzawa S.A. Schneeberger E.E. Fromm M. Coalson R.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2009; 133: 111-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Ion permeability ratios were calculated by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz voltage equation. In all calculations, activities rather than concentrations were used, assuming that the activity coefficient of each XCl salt is the same as that of NaCl. The absolute permeabilities, PNa and PCl, were derived by the method of Kimizuka and Koketsu (20Kimizuka H. Koketsu K. J. Theor. Biol. 1964; 6: 290-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) using the equation, PNa=RTF2•GMα(1+β)(Eq. 1) where GM represents the monolayer conductance per unit of surface area, α is the ratio of NaCl activity in the apical and the basolateral compartment (aNaCl,ap/aNaCl,bl), and β is the ratio of the permeability of Cl− and Na+ (PCl/PNa). Unless indicated differently, the conductance and permeability of uninduced (Dox+) were subtracted from measurements of induced (Dox−) cells to determine changes in the transepithelial conductance and permeability attributable to the introduction of claudin-2 and to obtain a quantitative measure of the macroscopic conductance and permeability of claudin-2 paracellular pores. For SCAM studies, methanethiosulfonate (MTS) and p-(chloromercuri)benzenesulfonic acid (pCMBS) solutions were prepared fresh as 100-fold concentrated stock solutions directly before starting the experiment to avoid hydrolysis (16Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Unless indicated differently, reagents were added simultaneously to the medium of the apical and basolateral compartment of the Ussing chamber and rapidly mixed by gas lifts. The concentrations of MTSEA and MTSET were adjusted to compensate for differences in their reactivity with thiols in free solution (21Stauffer D.A. Karlin A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6840-6849Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). All thiol-reactive reagents were applied in concentrations sufficient to obtain maximum effects on conductance, which were tested in initial experiments by consecutive readdition of reagents. The rate of reaction of MTS and pCMBS with cysteine was derived from the rate of the inhibition of the conductance of claudin-2 pores, assuming that the concentration of MTS remains nearly constant during the reaction so that we can determine a pseudo-first order rate constant by fitting conductance, G, to an exponential decay equation, G=G∞+(G0-G∞)•e-(k′t)(Eq. 2) with G0 representing the initial conductance and G∞ representing conductance at maximum inhibition. The second order rate constant, k, was determined by dividing the pseudo-first order rate constant k′ by the concentration of the applied reagent. The dimensions of thiol-reactive reagents were estimated by drawing the molecules in ChemSketch 11.0 (ACD Labs) and measuring molecular distances and radii with the three-dimensional viewer function. Ca2+ permeability was determined in unidirectional tracer flux experiments across cells grown on Transwell filters. 3 μCi of 45Ca2+ was added to the cis side, and after different time intervals, samples were taken from the basolateral (trans) compartment and analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. The initial rate of flux was used to determine the permeability of filters with cell monolayers (PC = flux/substrate concentration in cis compartment). This was then corrected for the permeability of blank filters, PB, to obtain the true transepithelial permeability (PT), using the following equation. PT=((1/PC)-(1/PB))-1(Eq. 3) The data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical significance was determined using the unpaired two-tailed Student's t test. Using site-directed mutagenesis, cysteines were introduced at four different positions of the first extracellular domain of claudin-2 (Table 1). These positions were chosen because mutation of the homologous residues in other claudin isoforms was found either to regulate charge selectivity or to cause familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis, a genetic disease that affects renal paracellular permeability (22Konrad M. Schaller A. Seelow D. Pandey A.V. Waldegger S. Lesslauer A. Vitzthum H. Suzuki Y. Luk J.M. Becker C. Schlingmann K.P. Schmid M. Rodriguez-Soriano J. Ariceta G. Cano F. Enriquez R. Juppner H.

Each cysteine mutant and WT claudin-2 was transfected into MDCK I TetOff cells, and stable transfected clones were selected. Protein expression and localization of WT and mutant claudin-2 were determined by immunofluorescence staining, together with the tight junction protein ZO-1, and studied by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1; see also supplemental Fig. S1 for magnified orthogonal sections). As reported previously (5Yu A.S. Cheng M.H. Angelow S. Günzel D. Kanzawa S.A. Schneeberger E.E. Fromm M. Coalson R.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2009; 133: 111-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), WT claudin-2 was mostly expressed at the tight junction, colocalizing with ZO-1, and also found in other cell compartments as an artifact of overexpression. The subcellular distribution of cysteine mutants of claudin-2 was indistinguishable from WT claudin-2, showing that the substitution of the selected amino acids with cysteine does not affect protein targeting and localization. The inducible expression of WT and mutant claudin-2 was verified by Western blots (Fig. 2A), which showed a characteristic band for claudin-2 in the absence of doxycycline (Dox−) at the expected size of about 22 kDa. Importantly, the induced expression of WT and mutant claudin-2 did not affect the expression of other claudin isoforms endogenously expressed by the host cell line (claudin-1, -3, -4, and -7; supplemental Fig. S2), so that changes in the paracellular transport of induced cells are most likely attributable to claudin-2. For subsequent electrophysiological studies, clones were selected that showed similar levels of claudin-2 expression.TABLE 1Amino acid residues of the first extracellular domain of claudin-2 that were selected for cysteine mutagenesisResidueRationale for selection (based on observations on homologous residues in other claudin isoforms)ReferenceTyr35R32D in claudin-10a decreases anion selectivityRef. 7Van Itallie C.M.

A, claudin-2 appears as a band at ∼22 kDa in induced cells (Dox−), whereas expression is suppressed in the presence of doxycycline (Dox+). An additional band at between 40 and 45 kDa was observed with cells induced to express the D65C mutant of claudin-2. (The band at ∼35 kDa present in all lanes represents nonspecific antibody binding.) All samples were prepared with reducing sample buffer, containing 1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. B, testing the identity of the high molecular mass band at 40–45 kDa. Lysates of D65C and WT cells without pretreatment were prepared for SDS-PAGE using non-reducing sample buffer (lane 1) or reducing sample buffer (lane 2). Alternatively, intact cell monolayers were pretreated with 10 mm dithiothreitol (lane 3) or 110 mm Cu(II)-phenanthroline (lane 4) for 5 min to reduce and oxidize cysteines, respectively. The reagents were vigorously washed off prior to cell lysis, and samples were prepared with non-reducing buffer. The blot shows that preparation of the sample under reducing conditions or pretreatment of the cells with reducing reagent decreases the high molecular mass band.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Interestingly, in addition to the 22 kDa band, a high molecular mass band between 40 and 45 kDa consistently appeared in Western blots of lysates isolated from the cysteine mutant D65C (Fig. 2A). This observation is specific for the substitution of aspartate with cysteine, since such a high molecular mass band was not reported for a recently generated mutant of claudin-2 in which this aspartate residue was replaced by asparagine (5Yu A.S. Cheng M.H. Angelow S. Günzel D. Kanzawa S.A. Schneeberger E.E. Fromm M. Coalson R.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 2009; 133: 111-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the identity of this band (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, the intensity of the high molecular mass band was increased, and the signal of the 22 kDa claudin-2 band decreased when cell lysates were prepared under non-reducing conditions (lane 1) compared with reducing conditions (lane 2). Similarly, the pretreatment of cells with 10 mm dithiothreitol led to a shift of claudin-2 from the high molecular mass band to the 22 kDa band (lane 3), whereas the opposite observation was made for cells pretreated with the oxidative reagent Cu(II)-phenanthroline (lane 4). As a control, lysates of WT claudin-2-expressing cells were prepared under the same conditions, and a high molecular mass band was never detected. The data indicate that the introduction of cysteine at position 65 enables individual claudin-2 units to form intermolecular disulfide bonds that could lead to the formation of claudin dimers. The effect of cysteine mutagenesis on the electrophysiological characteristics of claudin-2 was determined in Ussing chamber measurements of conductance and dilution potentials. Fig. 3 shows representative results of two clones of WT claudin-2 and each cysteine mutant, expressed in MDCK I TetOff cells. The expression of WT claudin-2 led to a ∼10-fold increase in conductance (Fig. 3A), which was due to an increase in Na+ permeability (PNa) (Fig. 3B), in agreement with previous observations (5Yu A.S.

Sawyers C.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 489-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (5150) Google Scholar) and therefore is considered as a potential intervention point for anticancer therapeutics. Activation of the pathway is frequently caused by mutations in PI3Kα that enhance its catalytic activity, leading to the generation of phosphatidyl 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) (2Zhao L. Vogt P.K.

When active, Akt phosphorylates several effector molecules including the Forkhead box O (FOXO) transcription factors (10Calnan D.R. Brunet A.

FOXO proteins are a family of conserved polypeptides that bind to DNA as a monomer and activate the transcription of genes that are involved in numerous biologically relevant processes such as metabolism, differentiation, proliferation, longevity, and apoptosis (12Accili D.

Akt phosphorylates FOXO proteins at three conserved consensus sites, which leads to conformational changes that facilitate CRM-1-mediated nuclear export (14Turner J.G. Sullivan D.M. Curr. Med.

Nuclear FOXO proteins function as regulators of transcription, whereas cytoplasmic FOXO proteins are considered inactive. It is well established that FOXO is negatively regulated by various proliferative and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways that activate the PI3K/Akt signaling cascade (11Burgering B.M. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2258-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Therefore, we chose to employ a high content imaging approach to monitor the nucleocytoplasmic translocation of a GFP-FOXO3a fusion protein in U2OS cells (U2foxRELOC) (16Zanella F. Rosado A. García B. Carnero A. Link W. Chembiochem. 2008; 9: 2229-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Zanella F. Rosado A. Garcia B. Carnero A. Link W. BMC Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) as the readout for biological inhibition of PI3K/Akt signaling. The rapid kinetics of the assay allowed us to reduce the incubation time and minimize possible toxic effects that might interfere with the analysis. Furthermore, this image-based high-throughput strategy provides a filter for adequate solubility, permeability, and stability in a cellular context and enables compounds that produce artifacts or cytotoxicity to be identified on a single cell basis. Often a key limitation of cell-based screening approaches is the identification of the molecular target of the compound. For this reason, the cell-based screen was followed by a focused screen of kinases thought to be involved in the regulation of the intracellular localization of FOXO proteins. This screen identified pyrazolopyrimidine derivatives as inhibitors of PI3Kα. Finally, a combination of computational and synthetic medicinal chemistry was used to optimize the chemical features required for activity. Here we report the discovery of a novel series of PI3K inhibitors discovered by cellular high content screening that are potent, selective, and demonstrate mechanism of action in vivo. Compounds were purchased from ChemDiv (San Diego, CA), BioFocus (Cambridge, UK), and Life Chemicals (Burlington, Canada). LY294002 was from Calbiochem. Leptomycin B was purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). Different but complementary criteria were considered for compound selection and purchase: (a) chemistry perspective: drug-like compounds and (b) biological point of view: structures focused on kinases (kinases libraries) as well as a diverse set of compounds exploring different chemical space with a potential biological activity. Compounds were purchased from ChemDiv and Life Chemicals. Their structure and purity (>90%) have been validated by NMR and/or LCMS. The compounds that have been synthesized in-house are at least 95% pure by LCMS and NMR (see supplemental information for details). The GFP-FOXO3a fusion protein was kindly provided by T. Finkel. The U2nesRELOC assay uses the reporter construct pRevMAPKKnesGFP, which has been described earlier (18Henderson B.R. Eleftheriou A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 19Zanella F. Rosado A. Blanco F. Henderson B.R. Carnero A. Link W. Assay Drug. Dev. Technol. 2007; 5: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). pRevMAPKKnesGFP carries the nuclear export signal from MAPKK cloned between the BamHI and AgeI sites of pRev(1.4)-GFP, sandwiched between the Rev and the GFP-coding sequences. Cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATTC). U2OS (human osteosarcoma) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. PC3 (human prostate carcinoma), MCF7 (human breast carcinoma), HCT116 (human colon carcinoma), 768-0 (human renal carcinoma), U251 (human glioblastoma) were grown in RPMI. All media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and antibiotics-antimycotics. Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and passaged when confluent using trypsin/EDTA. The U2nesRELOC assay and the U2foxRELOC assay have been described previously (16Zanella F. Rosado A. García B. Carnero A. Link W. Chembiochem. 2008; 9: 2229-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19Zanella F. Rosado A. Blanco F. Henderson B.R. Carnero A. Link W. Assay Drug. Dev. Technol. 2007; 5: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were seeded at a density of 1.0 × 105 cells/ml into black wall clear bottom 96-well microplates (BD Biosciences) after 12 h of incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2, 2 μl of each test compound were transferred from the mother plates to the assay plates. Cells were incubated in the presence of the compounds for 1 h. Then cells were fixed, and the nucleus stained with DAPI (Invitrogen). Finally the plates were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline twice and stored at 4 °C before analysis. Detailed methods are described in supplemental information. The Gold 3.1 program (21Knight Z.A. Gonzalez B. Feldman M.E. Zunder E.R. Goldenberg D.D. Williams O. Loewith R. Stokoe D. Balla A. Toth B. Balla T. Weiss W.A. Williams R.L. Shokat K.M.

The binding site was defined using the available experimental information; thus, the docking region used was a 15-Å sphere around the nitrogen NH of Val-882. The GoldScore scoring function was used to rank docking poses, and protein hydrogen bond constraints for binding to NH of Val-882 were imposed on the ligand. Per each ligand, the top five best docked structures out of 40 independent genetic algorithm runs were retrieved. For validation purposes, we compared the data for LY294002 and PI-103 docked to p110γ with the corresponding crystal structure of p110γ for LY294002 PDB entry 1e7v (20Walker E.H. Pacold M.E.

Besides qualitative assessment and key interactions properly identified, root mean-square deviation (r.m.s.d.) is utilized as a quantitative validation criteria for the docking algorithm set-up; thus, r.m.s.d. between experimentally reported LY294002 and the best predicted pose are 2.3 Å (1e8z, cross-docked structure) and 1.5 Å when the crystal for LY294002 (1e7v) is used. For PI-103, only docking using 1e8z yielded a reliable binding mode similar to the one described by Knight et al. (21Knight Z.A. Gonzalez B. Feldman M.E. Zunder E.R. Goldenberg D.D. Williams O.

By superimposing the 1e7v and 1e8z structures, we observed that the side chain of Lys-833 is more extended than in 1e8z, entering into the cavity occupied by the phenol group of PI-103 in the binding mode obtained with 1e8z. We have hypothesized that this extended conformation of the side chain of Lys-833 underlies the docking failure of PI-103 in 1e7v crystal. Based on these validation results, the 1e8z crystal was finally selected as the protein structure for docking of ETP-45658. The strategy used to identify biologically active inhibitors of PI3K/Akt signaling is outlined in Fig. 1A. As the primary filter, we used a cellular imaging assay that follows the intracellular location of FOXO proteins (16Zanella F. Rosado A. García B. Carnero A. Link W. Chembiochem. 2008; 9: 2229-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). U2OS osteosarcoma cells that stably express a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged version of FOXO3a were seeded in 96-well assay plates and treated with compounds at a final concentration of 10 μm for 1 h. A total of 33,992 compounds were screened for their ability to induce the translocation the GFP-FOXO3a reporter protein from the cytoplasm into the nucleus. The nuclear accumulation of fluorescence triggered by the pan-PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, was defined as 100% activity and used as a reference. Primary hits were defined as those compounds that have an activity greater than 60%. After retesting, 242 compounds were confirmed as positive yielding a hit rate of 0.71%. A sample image of an active compound is shown in Fig. 1B (upper right). To exclude compounds that could be general inhibitors of the nuclear export machinery rather than selective inducers of FOXO nuclear translocation, the ability of the compounds to influence the localization of a nuclear export signal (NES)-containing fluorescent reporter protein (19Zanella F. Rosado A. Blanco F. Henderson B.R. Carnero A. Link W. Assay Drug. Dev. Technol. 2007; 5: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) was determined. Briefly, the nuclear export assay uses U2OS cells that stably express a GFP-labeled Rev protein, which contains a strong heterologous NES sequence. The fluorescent signal of untreated cells localizes exclusively to the cytoplasm. Upon treatment with a nuclear export inhibitor such as leptomycin B, the GFP-labeled reporter protein accumulates rapidly in the cell nucleus (Fig. 1B, middle right). 14 of the original 242 confirmed hits induced the nuclear localization of Rev protein and were classified as nonspecific inhibitors as inhibitors of the Crml-dependent nuclear export, an example of a positive compound is shown in the lower right panel of Fig. 1B. The remaining 228 confirmed positive in the FOXO translocation assay and that were negative (Fig. 1B, lower left panel) in the nuclear export assay were classified as FOXO relocators. The FOXO relocators were then screened against protein kinases that are known to phosphorylate FOXO3a at sites involved in the regulation of its intracellular localization either directly, such as Akt1–3, Sgk 1–3, or indirectly by activating Akt, such as PI3Kα and PDK1 (10Calnan D.R. Brunet A. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2276-2288Crossref PubMed Scopus (923) Google Scholar, 22Huang H. Tindall D.J. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 2479-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). No inhibitors of PDK1, Akt1–3, or Sgk1–3 were identified. However, 54 compounds representing 24 distinct chemical classes, six of which had two or more representatives, were identified as biochemical inhibitors of PI3Kα. Of the remaining 174 FOXO relocators that were not inhibitors of PI3Kα, 155 were screened against an extended panel of protein kinases that have been implicated in signaling networks that regulate FOXO proteins (supplemental Fig. S1). Five compounds nonspecifically inhibited several receptor-tyrosine kinases (RTKs) whereas no other significant inhibitory activity was observed. In summary, a total of the 242 FOXO relocators identified, 6% were nonspecific inhibitors of nuclear export, 21% were inhibitors of PI3Kα, 2% were nonspecific inhibitors of RTKs, and 71% were classified as inhibitors of an unknown target(s). Pyrazolopyrimidine derivatives were the most potent biochemical inhibitors of PI3Kα identified from the primary screen (Fig. 2). The pyrazolopyrimidines had IC50 values for inhibition of PI3Kα ranging from 0.4 to 12 μm (Fig. 2A). In addition they induced clear nuclear FOXO translocation EC50 values of between 0.54 and 26.6 μm (Fig. 2A). As expected, the compounds inhibited Akt phosphorylation at serine 473 in treated cells (Fig. 2B). The pyrazolopyrimidine, ETP-7382, was the most potent biochemical inhibitor of PI3Kα and the most potent inducer of FOXO nuclear translocation obtained from the primary screen (Fig. 2A). Therefore, this compound was selected for further mechanism of action studies. Inhibition of signaling downstream of Akt was observed in cells treated with ETP-7382; both the Akt-dependent phosphorylation of FOXO3a on threonine 32 and mTOR-dependent phosphorylation of p70 S6K on threonine 389 was reduced (Fig. 2C). These observations confirmed the mechanism of action of ETP-7382 as an inhibitor of PI3Kα-dependent signaling. Based on these data, the pyrazolopyrimidines were selected for further investigation. To gain insights into the structural features of pyrazolopyrimidines required to inhibit the PI3Kα and maintain cellular activity, we pursued a combination of virtual screening and synthetic medicinal chemistry. In the first step, a Bayesian model (supplemental Materials and Methods) was built based on two-dimensional descriptors of structures of the confirmed positives and negatives using the data obtained from the primary FOXO relocation screen and from PI3Kα biochemical assay. Then, a virtual screen against our electronic, proprietary compound collection, data base of ∼1.5 million commercially available compounds was performed using the model. This was followed by additional substructural searches, using as references the chemotypes represented by the initial hits with PI3Kα inhibitory activity. These data lead to the acquisition of 216 pyrazolopyrimidines. 20 of these compounds were confirmed as inducers of FOXO relocation, and 18 of these also were biochemical inhibitors of PI3Kα yielding a hit rate of 8.33% (supplemental Table SI). Analysis of these data indicated that an aromatic ring played an important role as R1 or R4. Molecular docking studies supported the hypothesis that morpholine could play a key role in either the R1 or the R4 position. The crystal structure of PI3Kγ (23Walker E.H. Perisic O. Ried C. Stephens L. Williams R.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) in complex with the reference compounds LY294002 (20Walker E.H. Pacold M.E. Perisic O. Stephens L. Hawkins P.T. Wymann M.P. Williams R.L. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 909-919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar) and PI-103 (21Knight Z.A. Gonzalez B. Feldman M.E. Zunder E.R. Goldenberg D.D. Williams O. Loewith R. Stokoe D. Balla A. Toth B. Balla T. Weiss W.A. Williams R.L. Shokat K.M. Cell. 2006; 125: 733-747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A) indicates that the morpholine oxygen appears to act as a driving force to maintain a key interaction with Val-882 in the hinge region (21Knight Z.A. Gonzalez B. Feldman M.E. Zunder E.R. Goldenberg D.D. Williams O. Loewith R. Stokoe D. Balla A. Toth B. Balla T. Weiss W.A. Williams R.L. Shokat K.M.

Therefore, the synthetic chemistry plan used morpholine as one of the key substituents for the diversity points R1 and R4, as described in Table 1. The data presented in Table 1 suggested that an aryl ring with hydrogen bond donor/acceptor moieties in the meta positions were preferred, and in particular meta-phenol, as suggested by the structural similarity to the PI3K inhibitor PI-103 (Fig. 3A). This structure-activity relationship (SAR)-driven rational design was further confirmed by data from Folkes et al. (24Folkes A.J. Ahmadi K. Alderton W.K. Alix S. Baker S.J. Box G. Chuckowree I.S. Clarke P.A. Depledge P. Eccles S.A. Friedman L.S. Hayes A. Hancox T.C. Kugendradas A. Lensun L. Moore P. Olivero A.G. Pang J. Patel S. Pergl-Wilson G.H. Raynaud F.I. Robson A. Saghir N. Salphati L.

The compound was predicted to interact with PI3Kγ in a manner similar to LY294002 and PI-103 where the main driving forces for binding in the ATP pocket are interactions with Val-882 and Tyr-867 (Fig. 3A). The mutant PI3Kα proteins, H1047K and K545E, which are found in human tumors, showed similar sensitivity toward ETP-45658 as the wild-type PI3Kα protein (Fig. 3B). ETP-45658 was also tested for its ability to inhibit PI3Kβ, PI3Kδ, and PI3Kγ. ETP-45658 was essentially equipotent toward PI3Kδ, IC50 30 nm, and slightly less potent toward PI3Kβ, IC50 129 nm. However it had significantly less inhibitory activity toward PI3Kγ with an IC50 of 710 nm. ETP-45658 had modest, but significant activity toward the class IV PI3-related kinase mTOR and DNA PK with IC50 values of 152 nm and 70.6 nm, respectively (Fig. 3B). ETP-45658 was further profiled against a panel of 72 protein kinases (supplemental Table SII); of these kinases only focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and B-Raf were inhibited more than 35% at a concentration of 10 μm (supplemental Table SII). Thus it appears that ETP-45658 is relatively selective toward phosphoinositide 3-kinases. ETP-45658 was a potent inducer of GFP-FOXO nuclear translocation with an EC50 of 45 nm (Fig. 4A and supplemental Fig. S2A). The compound provoked a dose-dependent decrease of Akt phosphorylation on serine 473 after a 1-h treatment of U2OS cells (supplemental Fig. S2B). The ability of ETP-45658 to impact the phosphorylation of the Akt substrates FOXO3a and Gsk3-β was also examined. Consistent with the decrease in Akt phosphorylation observed above, ETP-45658 caused a 95% decrease in the phosphorylation of FOXO3a at threonine 32 and a 55% reduction on Gsk3-β at serine 9 (Fig. 4B), both Akt substrates. It is not clear why the inhibition of the phosphorylation of FOXO3a on threonine 32 was greater than of GSK3-β on serine 9 with both LY294002 and ETP-45658; perhaps the half-life of the phosphate on serine 9 of GSK3-β is longer and therefore longer incubation times with the inhibitor would be required to see complete inhibition. In addition, the phosphorylation of the mTOR substrate p70 S6K was similarly reduced (Fig. 4B). Whether this was due to the inhibition of PI3K by ETP-45658 or by ETP-45658 activity toward mTOR was not be determined. ETP-45658 treatment of cells did not alter the phosphorylation status of p42/45 ERK kinases (Fig. 4B) indicative of cellular selectivity for the PI3K pathway. ETP-45658 also decreased the expression of cyclin D1 after 1 h of treatment (supplemental Fig. S2C). Consistent with this observation, the cell cycle analysis of PC3 cells treated for 24 h with ETP-45658 revealed a clear G1 arrest with no significant evidence of apoptosis as indicated by the lack of a sub-G1 population of cells (supplemental Fig. S2D). These data confirm that ETP-45658 efficiently inhibits PI3K signaling in treated tumor cells. The anti-proliferative activity of ETP-45658 was examined using a small panel of human cancer cell lines with either activating mutations in PI3Kα or loss of function of the negative regulator of PI3K, PTEN. The cellular EC50 values for inhibition of proliferation were found to be between 0.4 and 5.5 μm (supplemental Table SIII). There was no obvious difference in potency toward cell lines with activating mutations in PI3K or inactivating mutations in PTEN. Because our ultimate aim is to explore the feasibility of PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitors as a cancer therapy, the pharmacological activity of ETP-45658 in vivo was examined. ETP-45658 was injected in MMTV-myr-p110α transgenic females. These transgenic lines express myristylated p110α under control of the MMTV promoter, which leads to strong PI3Kα activation in the mammary ducts of female mice (25Renner O. Blanco-Aparicio C. Grassow M. Cañamero M. Leal J.F. Carnero A. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 9643-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The female mice were injected with ETP-45658 or vehicle alone into transgenic littermates. As a positive control, a third cohort of mice was injected with the reference compound PI-103. Sixteen hours after treatment, the mice were sacrificed, and mammary glands were processed for immunohistochemistry. The epithelial-specific signal was quantified, and values of intensity of the immunohistochemical images of compound-treated mammary glands were compared with the values of the respective vehicle control images. As shown in Fig. 4C, the level of phosphorylated Akt on serine 473 was noticeably lower in the mammary ducts of transgenic mice injected with ETP-45658 as compared with the vehicle-treated mice. The phosphorylation of Akt was decreased to 50% of the control level (p = 0.001). The phosphorylation status of p70S6K on theonine 389 and eIF4G on serine 1108 were also examined. In all cases, a clear reduction of the levels of phosphorylation was observed (Fig. 4C). Treatment with ETP-45658 induced a significant reduction in the phosphorylation in the markers tested (Fig. 4C). These results confirm that ETP-45658 inhibits PI3K signaling in vivo. Because of the high frequency of genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt signaling cascade in many types of human cancer there is intense interest to discover inhibitors of this pathway to evaluate them as a therapeutic treatment. The research presented in this report describes the use of a combination of high content cell-based screening and focused biochemical profiling of selected protein kinases to identify the molecular target of compounds with the desired mechanism of action. This was followed by molecular modeling and traditional medicinal chemistry that led to the discovery of ETP-45658 a potent and selective inhibitor of PI3 kinases. The primary screen of 33,992 compounds followed the intracellular location of the Akt effector, FOXO3a, in tumor cells (16Zanella F. Rosado A. García B. Carnero A. Link W. Chembiochem. 2008; 9: 2229-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Compounds found that induced the nuclear translocation of GFP-FOXO yet did not affect general nuclear export were profiled against a small panel of protein kinases involved in the regulation of FOXO nuclear localization. This identified pyrazolopyrimidine derivatives as inhibitors of PI3Kα. To our surprise, we did not find any inhibitors of PDK1, Akt 1–3, or SGK1–3. This is perhaps due to an unintended bias of our compound collection against targeting the AGC family of protein kinases or the possibility that the inhibitors of AGC kinases that are present in our compound collection were unable to penetrate the cell membrane and therefore could not be selected as actives in the primary cell-based screen. As we have not performed any biochemical screens versus AGC kinase using our compound collection, we cannot be sure which explanation is more accurate. A total of 174 FOXO relocators were identified that apparently had no inhibitory activity toward protein kinases that directly phosphorylates FOXO or selected upstream kinases that regulate these kinases, suggesting that these compounds perhaps target proteins outside of the canonical PI3K/Akt phosphorylation cascade. Several compounds were found to be nonselective inhibitors of several receptor-tyrosine kinases, which could account for their activity in the FOXO assay. Kau et al. (26Kau T.R. Schroeder F. Ramaswamy S. Wojciechowski C.L. Zhao J.J. Roberts T.M. Clardy J. Sellers W.R. Silver P.A. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 463-476Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) reported results in a similar screen for inhibitors of FOXO1a nuclear export. No common compounds were obtained between the two screens; however, three common chemical classes were found (supplemental Fig. S3A), none of which were active toward PI3Kα. Chemotype 1 (C1) were phenothiazines, which have been reported as ligands for monoaminerergic GPCR, dopamine receptor antagonists (27Karobath M. Leitich H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1974; 71: 2915-2918Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The second chemotype (C2) is based on four fused rings and has been reported as reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase (MAO) type A (28Medvedev A.E. Veselovsky A.V. Shvedov V.I. Tikhonova O.V. Moskvitina T.A. Fedotova O.A. Axenova L.N. Kamyshanskaya N.S. Kirkel A.Z. Ivanov A.S. J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci. 1998; 38: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Chemotype 3, aminoquinazolines, has been reported as protein kinase inhibitors (29DiMauro E.F. Newcomb J. Nunes J.J. Bemis J.E. Boucher C. Buchanan J.L. Buckner W.H. Cee V.J. Chai L. Deak H.L.

Chem. 2006; 49: 5671-5686Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The most frequent chemotype, C1, was present in eleven of the FOXO relocators where key chemical and pharmacophoric features were clearly identified. An additional seven FOXO relocators were found to have the same pharmacophore yet were different chemotypes (C2 and C3). Using a high-throughput, cell-based assay to screen for modulators of the mTOR signaling network Yang et al. (30Yang J. Shamji A. Matchacheep S. Schreiber S.L. Chem. Biol. 2007; 14: 371-377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) identified quinostatin as an inhibitor of S6 phosphorylation, which they subsequently found to be a weak inhibitor of PI3Kα. Interestingly a derivative of quinostatin was identified in the image-based screen used in the present work and biochemically inhibited PI3Kα (supplemental Fig. S3B). A SAR was developed for the pyrazolopyrimidines using the FOXO nuclear localization data coupled with the PI3Kα biochemical inhibitory data. The SAR analysis indicates that morpholine and substituted aryls with donor/acceptor functionalities are the preferred substituents in positions R1 and R4 of the pyrazolopyrimidine scaffold. The most active analog synthesized, ETP-45658, combines morpholine in the R1 position and meta-phenol in the R4 position of the pyrazolopyrimidine scaffold. It is an ATP competitive inhibitor of PI3Kα with an IC50 of 22 nm. It is equally potent toward PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ as well as toward two mutant forms of PI3Kα that are commonly found in human tumors. The compound also inhibits PI3Kγ, mTOR, and DNA PK at submicromolar concentrations. Our docking studies predict that like the reference compound LY294002, ETP-45658 makes a key hydrogen bond between the oxygen in the morpholine ring and the backbone amide of Val-882 in p110γ, which mimics the interaction made by the adenine ring nitrogen (N1) of ATP (20Walker E.H.

BEZ235, another potent pan PI3K inhibitor, also keeps the interaction with Val-882 through the aromatic nitrogen born by the tricyclic central core that acts as hydrogen bond acceptor (31Kong D.

ETP-45658 elicits the expected mechanism of action in vitro and in vivo; there is a decrease in the phosphorylation of Akt at serine 473, of FOXO at theonine 32 and of p70S6K at threonine 389 in cells after treatment with the compound. The EC50 for induction of the nuclear translocation of GFP FOXO of 45 nm consistent with the IC50 of 22 nm obtained for biochemical inhibition of PI3Kα. ETP-45658 induces a G1 arrest concomitant with cyclin D1 decrease in treated cells. The compound has antiproliferative activity in a variety of tumor-derived cell lines, and this activity appears to be independent of PI3Kα and PTEN mutational status since we obtained similar results in cells with mutant PI3Kα and wild-type PTEN (MCF7 or HCT116) or cells with wild type PI3Kα and mutant PTEN (786-0, PC3, or U251). Similar observations have been reported for other PI3K inhibitors (34Garcia-Echeverria C. Sellers W.R. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 5511-5526Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). ETP-45658 is pharmacologically active in vivo. The treatment of mice that express a myristylated p110α PI3K subunit in mammary ductal cells with the compound caused the expected changes in selected molecular markers of pathway inhibition, including Akt, eIF4G, and p70 S6K.

https://openalex.org/W1971771552,"Malignant melanoma is resistant to almost all conventional forms of chemotherapy. Recent evidence suggests that anti-apoptotic proteins of the Bcl-2 family are overexpressed in melanoma and may contribute to melanoma's striking resistance to apoptosis. ABT-737, a small-molecule inhibitor of Bcl-2, Bcl-xl and Bcl-w, has demonstrated efficacy in several forms of leukemia, lymphoma as well as solid tumors. However, overexpression of Mcl-1, a frequent observance in melanoma, is known to confer ABT-737 resistance.Here we report that knockdown of Mcl-1 greatly reduces cell viability in combination with ABT-737 in six different melanoma cell lines. We demonstrate that the cytotoxic effect of this combination treatment is due to apoptotic cell death involving not only caspase-9 activation but also activation of caspase-8, caspase-10 and Bid, which are normally associated with the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Caspase-8 (and caspase-10) activation is abrogated by inhibition of caspase-9 but not by inhibitors of the death receptor pathways. Furthermore, while caspase-8/-10 activity is required for the full induction of cell death with treatment, the death receptor pathways are not. Finally, we demonstrate that basal levels of caspase-8 and Bid correlate with treatment sensitivity.Our findings suggest that the combination of ABT-737 and Mcl-1 knockdown represents a promising, new treatment strategy for malignant melanoma. We also report a death receptor-independent role for extrinsic pathway proteins in treatment response and suggest that caspase-8 and Bid may represent potential markers of treatment sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2040736178,"SMILE (small heterodimer partner interacting leucine zipper protein) has been identified as a corepressor of the glucocorticoid receptor, constitutive androstane receptor, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α. Here we show that SMILE also represses estrogen receptor-related receptor γ (ERRγ) transactivation. Knockdown of SMILE gene expression increases ERRγ activity. SMILE directly interacts with ERRγ in vitro and in vivo. Domain mapping analysis showed that SMILE binds to the AF2 domain of ERRγ. SMILE represses ERRγ transactivation partially through competition with coactivators PGC-1α, PGC-1β, and GRIP1. Interestingly, the repression of SMILE on ERRγ is released by SIRT1 inhibitors, a catalytically inactive SIRT1 mutant, and SIRT1 small interfering RNA but not by histone protein deacetylase inhibitor. In vivo glutathione S-transferase pulldown and coimmunoprecipitation assays validated that SMILE physically interacts with SIRT1. Furthermore, the ERRγ inverse agonist GSK5182 enhances the interaction of SMILE with ERRγ and SMILE-mediated repression. Knockdown of SMILE or SIRT1 blocks the repressive effect of GSK5182. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that GSK5182 augments the association of SMILE and SIRT1 on the promoter of the ERRγ target PDK4. GSK5182 and adenoviral overexpression of SMILE cooperate to repress ERRγ-induced PDK4 gene expression, and this repression is released by overexpression of a catalytically defective SIRT1 mutant. Finally, we demonstrated that ERRγ regulates SMILE gene expression, which in turn inhibits ERRγ. Overall, these findings implicate SMILE as a novel corepressor of ERRγ and recruitment of SIRT1 as a novel repressive mechanism for SMILE and ERRγ inverse agonist.

All the ERR family members bind either as a monomer or a homodimer or as heterodimeric complexes composed of two distinct ERR isoforms to the consensus sequence TCAAGGTCA, referred to as ERR-response element (ERRE), and as homodimers to the consensus estrogen-responsive element (1Giguère V.

SMILE (small heterodimer partner interacting leucine zipper protein), including two alternative translation-derived isoforms, SMILE-L (CREBZF; long form of SMILE) and SMILE-S (Zhangfei; short form of SMILE), has been classified as a member of the CREB/ATF family of basic region-leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors (15Lu R.

SMILE has been implicated in herpes simplex virus infection cycle and related cellular processes through its association with herpes simplex virus-related host-cell factor and CREB3 (17Akhova O.

SMILE has also been proposed as a coactivator of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4/CREB2) (19Hogan M.R. Cockram G.P. Lu R. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 58-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Recently, we have reported that SMILE functions as a coregulator of ER signaling and a corepressor of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) (16Xie Y.B.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 4100-4115Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). However, the detailed roles of SMILE on other NRs still need to be clarified. Silent information regulator 2 proteins (Sirtuins) are class III histone protein deacetylases (HDACs) and consist of seven members named SIRT1 to SIRT7 in mammals (21Blander G. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). Through deacetylating target proteins, Sirtuins play important roles in cellular processes such as gene expression, apoptosis, metabolism, and aging (21Blander G. Guarente L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 417-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar). Of the seven Sirtuins, SIRT1 has been extensively studied. It has been reported that SIRT1 deacetylates and thereby deactivates the p53 and PARP1 protein (poly(ADP ribose) polymerase-1), resulting in promoted cell survival (22Luo J. Nikolaev A.Y. Imai S.

In addition, SIRT1 regulates glucose or lipid metabolism through its deacetylation activity on over 24 known substrates, including FOXO transcriptional factors (24Brunet A. Sweeney L.B. Sturgill J.F.

It has also been demonstrated that SIRT1 regulates cholesterol metabolism through deacetylation and activation of liver X receptor proteins (29Li X. Zhang S. Blander G. Tse J.G. Krieger M. Guarente L. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 91-106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). In this study, we have shown that SMILE negatively regulates ERRγ through direct interaction. We have demonstrated that coactivator competition and recruitment of catalytically active SIRT1 are required for the repression of ERRγ by SMILE. Moreover, ERRγ-specific inverse agonist GSK5182 enhances the interaction of SMILE and ERRγ. siRNA SMILE and siRNA SIRT1 experiments have revealed that SMILE-SIRT association is required for the inhibition of ERRγ by GSK5182. In addition, we have observed that ERRγ induces SMILE gene expression in HepG2 cells by directly binding to the SMILE promoter and that SMILE inhibits ERRγ transactivation of its own promoter. Overall, our observations suggest that SMILE acts as a novel corepressor of ERRγ and that ERRγ belongs to a new autoregulatory loop that governs SMILE gene expression.

HEK293T (293T, human embryonic kidney), HepG2 (human hepatoma), and HeLa cells (cervical cancer) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transient transfection was performed using Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) in 293T cells and Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) in HepG2 cells. 293T and HepG2 cells were cotransfected with the reporter plasmids (HNF4)8-Luc, sft4-Luc, or PDK4-Luc coupled with various expression vectors. The plasmid of cytomegalovirus-β-galactosidase was cotransfected as an internal control, and the total DNA employed in each transfection was adjusted via the addition of an appropriate quantity of pcDNA3 vector. Approximately 36 h post-transfection, the cells were treated with or without chemicals as indicated in the figure legends for 12 h, and then cells were harvested, and the luciferase activity was measured and normalized against β-galactosidase activity as described previously (16Xie Y.B.

In Western blot analysis of immunoprecipitated proteins, conventional horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG was replaced with rabbit IgG TrueBlot (catalog number 18-8816, eBioscience) to eliminate signal interference by the immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. In vivo GST pulldown experiments were performed as described previously (20Xie Y.B. Nedumaran B. Choi H.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 4100-4115Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In brief, HepG2 cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. Forty eight hours after transfection, the whole-cell extracts were prepared with 200 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm EDTA, 0.1 m KCl, and 0.3 m NaCl) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors. Then equal amounts of total protein were used for in vivo GST pulldown assays followed by Western blot analysis. The confocal microscopy assays were carried out as described previously (20Xie Y.B. Nedumaran B. Choi H.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 4100-4115Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In brief, the HeLa cells grown on gelatin-coated coverslips were transfected with the indicated plasmids using Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Twenty four hours after transfection, the cells were fixed with 2% formaldehyde followed by immunostaining. To detect HA-tagged ERRγ and the nucleus, the cells were incubated with Alexa 594-conjugated anti-HA monoclonal antibody (1:500 dilution; Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature (25 °C), washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with 0.1 mg/ml 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen) solution for 10 min. After three times washing with phosphate-buffered saline, the cells were subjected to observation by confocal microscopy. The adenovirus encoding human SMILE or mouse ERRγ was described previously (10Park Y.Y. Ahn S.W. Kim H.J. Kim J.M. Lee I.K. Kang H. Choi H.S.

Total RNA was isolated using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The mRNAs of SMILE, SHP, PDK4, ERRγ, and SIRT1 were analyzed by RT-PCR or qPCR as indicated. DNA samples from total RNA reverse transcription or from chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays served as the templates for qPCR experiments, which were performed with QuantiTect SYBR GreenER PCR kit (Qiagen) and the Roter-Gene 6000 real time PCR system (Australia) in triplicate. Median cycle threshold values were determined and used for analysis. ChIP signals were presented as percentage of input signals. mRNA expression levels of the interested genes were normalized to those of β-actin. The RT-PCR and qPCR primers are provided in supplemental Table 1. ChIP assay was performed as described previously (20Xie Y.B. Nedumaran B. Choi H.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 4100-4115Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In brief, treated HepG2 cells in 60-mm culture dishes were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested, and solicited. The soluble chromatin was then subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-ERRγ, anti-SMILE (sc-49329, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-SIRT1, anti PGC-1α, acetyl-histone H3 (Lys-9), or anti-HA antibodies followed by using protein A-agarose/salmon sperm DNA (Upstate). Unrelated IgG was used a negative control for immunoprecipitation. Precipitated DNA was recovered via phenol/chloroform extraction and amplified by qPCR or RT-PCR for 35–40 cycles using specific primer sets for the indicated specific promoter regions of PDK4 and SMILE genes. The PCR primers for ChIP assays are provided in supplemental Table 2. Transcription start site was determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends using SMARTTM rapid amplification of cDNA ends kit (Clontech). Total RNA isolated from HepG2 cells was reverse-transcribed using SMART II A oligonucleotide and 5′-CDS primer A according to the manufacturer's recommendations. BD PowerScript RT exhibits terminal transferase activity by adding three to five residues of predominantly dC to the 3′ end of the first strand cDNA. BD PowerScript RT switches templates from RNA to BD SMART oligonucleotides, generating a complete cDNA copy of the original RNA with BD SMART sequences at the end. The dC-tailed cDNA was amplified by the BD Advantage 2 PCR system using a gene-specific primer (5′-TGGACCCCAGGCAACCGGACTGGCA-3′) corresponding to 332–356 bp of human SMILE cDNA and a nested gene-specific primer (5′-TGTTCGCTGCCCTCTGACCTGACC-3′) corresponding to 85–108 bp of human SMILE cDNA. The amplified PCR fragments were subcloned into pGEM T-easy vector (Promega) for DNA sequencing. Student's t test was performed using GraphPad Prism version 3.0 for Windows, and results were considered to be statistically significant at p < 0.05. Our previous work showed that SMILE interacted with many NRs in yeast two-hybrid interaction assays, including GR, TRα, CAR, SF-1, ERRα, ERRβ, ERRγ, HNF4α, and Nur77 (20Xie Y.B. Nedumaran B. Choi H.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 4100-4115Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To further confirm the interaction of SMILE with ERRα, ERRβ, and ERRγ, in vitro and in vivo GST pulldown experiments were performed. For the in vitro GST pulldown assays, bacteria-expressed GST only or GST-SMILE proteins were incubated with in vitro translated 35S-labeled ERRα, ERRβ, or ERRγ. As shown in Fig. 1A, 35S-labeled ERRγ was observed to bind to GST-fused full-length SMILE, but 35S-labeled ERRα and ERRβ was not. These results suggest that SMILE specifically interacts with ERRγ in vitro. For the in vivo GST pulldown assays, mammalian expression vectors encoding either pEBG (GST) alone or pEBG-SMILE (GST-SMILE) together with pcDNA3-FLAG-ERRα, pcDNA3-FLAG-ERRβ, or pSG5-HA-ERRγ were cotransfected into HepG2 cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, HA-ERRγ was coprecipitated with GST-SMILE but not with GST alone. The expression of GST, GST-SMILE, and HA-ERRγ proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B, middle and bottom panels, respectively). However, neither FLAG-ERRα nor FLAG-ERRβ was found to be coprecipitated with GST-SMILE (supplemental Fig. 1A). These results demonstrate that exogenous SMILE specifically interacts with ectopically expressed ERRγ. To further investigate whether endogenous ERRγ and SMILE can interact with each other in vivo, coimmunoprecipitation experiments were performed. Endogenous ERRγ proteins from HepG2 cells, mouse liver, kidney, and heart tissues were observed to be coprecipitated with SMILE (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results validate that SMILE can specifically interact with ERRγ both in vitro and in vivo. To investigate whether SMILE and ERRγ are colocalized to the"

One important consequence of this stress response is the increased expression of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), which causes extracellular protein degradation and thereby contributes to photoaging of human skin. In the present study we identify the proteasome as an integral part of the UVA-induced, intracellular signaling cascade in human dermal fibroblasts. UVA-induced singlet oxygen formation was accompanied by protein oxidation, the cross-linking of oxidized proteins, and an inhibition of the proteasomal system.

Increased transcription factor activation was also observed if the proteasome was inhibited by cross-linked proteins or lactacystin, indicating a general mechanism. Most importantly, inhibition of the proteasome was of functional relevance for UVA-induced MMP-1 expression, because overexpression of the proteasome or the protein repair enzyme methionine sulfoxide reductase prevented the UVA-induced induction of MMP-1.

In fact, UVA-induced MMP-1 expression and the resulting increased degradation of collagen fibers, which occurs primarily in the upper part of the dermis, is thought to be a major reason for wrinkle formation in photoaged human skin (4Fisher G.J.

The specific signaling steps involved in UVA radiation-induced MMP-1 expression have been extensively examined in recent years. These studies have identified UVA radiation-induced singlet oxygen formation as the initiating event (for review, see Ref. 7Klotz L.O. Holbrook N.J. Sies H. Curr. Probl. Dermatol. 2001; 29: 95-113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that triggers a cascade of downstream steps which critically involve the activation of the transcription factor complex AP-1 and the subsequent increase in expression of MMP-1. This signaling model, however, includes a black box, because the precise signaling steps linking singlet oxygen with AP-1 activation are largely unknown. In this regard it is of interest that skin fibroblasts in the upper part of the dermis, i.e. exactly the compartment where collagen degradation takes place, contain increased amounts of oxidized proteins (8Sander C.S. Chang H. Salzmann S. Müller C.S. Ekanayake-Mudiyanselage S. Elsner P. Thiele J.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2002; 118: 618-625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The functional relevance of protein oxidation in human skin is not known. Under normal conditions oxidized proteins are being degraded by the proteasome. The proteasome is located in the cytosol, nucleus, and attached to the endoplasmic reticulum and the cell membrane. The main body of this system is called 20 S “core” proteasome which is regulated by several peptides but also known to be able to degrade proteins without any regulator. It has been shown by many studies that proteasome activity decreases in aging tissues. A major reason for proteasome activity inhibition is protein aggregate formation which can occur as a consequence of protein oxidation. In the present study we show that UVA radiation, through a singlet oxygen-mediated mechanism, causes protein oxidation and attenuation of proteasome activity in human skin fibroblasts. This then leads to the decreased degradation of intracellular proteins including constituents of the transcription factor complex AP-1 and ultimately to increased MMP-1 transcription. Our studies identify the proteasome as an integral part of the UVA stress response and link intracellular and extracellular protein degradation. Human foreskin fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C. All experiments were performed with cells of passages 22–26. Cell viability was determined using MTT (3-(4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide) reduction by viable cells. The UVA irradiation source was a TL15W/05 lamp that emitted an energy spectrum in the UVA region (320–400 nm). The emitted dose was calculated using a UV-MAT dosimeter system. Before UVA irradiation, cells were washed twice with PBS to remove all medium, and during irradiation cells were held in PBS and maintained at 37 °C in a thermostatically controlled water bath. Control samples were subjected to the same conditions without irradiation. After irradiation, fresh medium was added, and the cells were incubated for a further 3 h before analysis. According to viability test results, 0–60 J/cm2 of UVA irradiation were chosen for the experiments. On average, 50 J/cm2 of UVA typically corresponds to one minimal erythemal dose in human skin (9Luy H. Frenk E. Applegate L.A. Photodermatol. Photoimmunol. Photomed. 1994; 10: 126-133PubMed Google Scholar). For lactacystin experiments cells were incubated with 20 μm lactacystin alone or with protein kinase inhibitors: 80 μm JNKi I (cell-permeable, Ref. 10Bonny C. Oberson A. Negri S. Sauser C.

Chemical generation of 1O2 was achieved by incubation of cells with disodium 3,3′-(1,4-naphthylidene) dipropionate-1,4-endoperoxide (NDPO2) in PBS. NDPO2 was synthesized from NDP (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) by oxidation with H2O2/molybdate. Control experiments were performed with solutions of predecomposed (heated) NDPO2 containing the decomposition product, NDP. Healthy volunteers were irradiated at a dose of 120 J/cm2 in the buttock area. Biopsies were taken 1 h after irradiation from the irradiated area and, for comparison, from the contralateral nonirradiated area. The studies were approved by the ethical committee of the Heinrich-Heine-University, Düsseldorf. Biopsies were split into half and snap-frozen and stored at −80 °C until analysis. One part was used for immunostaining, whereas the other part of the biopsy was used for biochemical analysis. Protein carbonyl content was taken as a measure for protein oxidation. Carbonyls were determined in cell lysates (1 mg/ml in lysis buffer with 1 mm butylated hydroxytoluene) by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as introduced by Buss et al. (12Buss H. Chan T.P. Sluis K.B. Domigan N.M. Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar). Primary anti-DNP-rabbit-IgG antiserum (Sigma) and a secondary monoclonal anti-rabbit-peroxidase-conjugated IgG (Sigma) were used as detection system. Development was performed with o-phenylene diamine and H2O2. Absorbance was measured at 492 nm using a microplate reader (BioTek Instruments EL 340). Cells were lysed in 1 mm dithiothreitol by vigorous shaking for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min to remove nonlysed cells, membranes, and nuclei. Supernatants were incubated in 225 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.8) containing 7.5 mm MgOAc, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 45 mm KCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The fluorogenic peptide succinyl-LLVY-methyl coumarin was used as substrate at a concentration of 200 μm to measure chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, methyl coumarin liberation was measured with fluorescence reader (360 nm excitation/485 nm emission) and calculated using free methyl coumarin as standards. To exclude other protease activities the selective proteasome inhibitor lactacystin with the final concentration of 20 μm was used in the reaction, and proteasome activity was calculated as the difference between the total activity and the remaining activity in the presence of lactacystin. For measurements in the isolated form of the proteasome, purification was made as described (13Reinheckel T. Sitte N. Ullrich O. Kuckelkorn U. Davies K.J. Grune T. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 14Hough R. Pratt G. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 8303-8313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunostaining was performed on 5-μm-thick sections. Fixation was done as previously described (15Jung T. Engels M. Kaiser B. Poppek D. Grune T. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2006; 40: 1303-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: rabbit polyclonal anti-DNP (Sigma, diluted 1:200) for protein carbonyls and rabbit polyclonal antibody to human 20 S proteasome (Biomol, diluted 1:100). For 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole staining, 1 mg/ml of solution was used. Observations were made by fluorescence microscopy using an Olympus BX-60 transmission fluorescence microscope running standard software. Cells were lysed, and total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit following the manufacturer's protocol. The amount and purity of the extracted RNA were determined via spectrophotometry in a Smartspec 3000 (Bio-Rad). An iScript cDNA synthesis kit and 1 μg of RNA were used for cDNA synthesis. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using a Bio-Rad iCycler 3.0 and the Bio-Rad IQ SYBR Green reaction mixture. The sequences of primers used in this work were as follows: human MMP-1 forward, CTGCTTACGAATTTGCCGAC; human MMP-1 reverse, GCAGCATCGATATGCTTCAC; human TIMP-1 forward, GATGGACTCTTGCACATCACT; human TIMP-1 reverse, TGGATAAACAGGGAAACACTG. As the housekeeping gene for relative mRNA quantification, 18 S rRNA was chosen; human 18 S rRNA forward, GGACATCTAAGGGCATCACA; human 18 S rRNA reverse, GGACATCTAAGGGCATCACA. Cells were lysed at 4 °C using 10 mm Tris HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 1 mm Pefabloc, 0.9% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS. The protein concentrations of the supernatants were determined according to Lowry (16Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 30 μg of total protein in reducing Laemmli buffer (0.25 M Tris (pH 6.8), 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 0.03% bromphenol blue) were denatured at 95 °C for 5 min and applied to SDS-PAGE of 12% (w/v) acrylamide followed by electrophoresis and blotting onto nitrocellulose membrane according to standard procedures. Immunodetections were performed with the following antibodies at dilutions recommended by the suppliers: rabbit polyclonal c-Jun antibody, mouse monoclonal anti-phospho- (Pi-) c-Jun antibody raised against amino acids 56–69 of human c-Jun (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Santa Cruz, CA), mouse monoclonal anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody (Novus Biologicals). After exposure to peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Calbiochem), membranes were developed using Lumi-Light Western blotting substrate (Cell Signaling). The modulation of JNK/AP1 pathway was observed using Cignal AP1 Reporter Assay kit GFP (Superarray) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After reverse transfection of the cells for 16 h, cells were treated with 30 J/cm2 UVA or 20 μm lactacystin. GFP expression was analyzed via fluorescent microscopy using standard fluorescein isothiocyanate filters (excitation of 470 ± 20 nm and an emission filter of 515 nm). Cells were incubated with [35S]methionine/cysteine at the end activity of 100 μCi/ml in methionine and cysteine-free minimal essential Eagle's medium at 37 °C for 16 h. After washing non-incorporated medium with PBS, cells were irradiated with 30J/cm2 and incubated for 3 h in medium. For proteolysis measurement at the end of incubation, the medium was mixed with the equal volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid. Scintillation counting was performed with the acid-soluble supernatant after centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The acid-soluble counts were calculated as (acid soluble sample counts/incorporated counts) × 100. For protein aggregate measurement, detergent solubility was taken as a measure. After collecting the medium for proteolysis measurement, cells were scraped, and pellets were resuspended in a detergent solution consisting of 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8) (17Demasi M. Davies K.J.A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 542: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). After cell lysis at 4 °C for 15 min, samples were centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were counted as detergent-soluble proteins, and pellets, counted as detergent-insoluble proteins, were dissolved in 1 n NaOH and subjected to scintillation counting. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism 4 (GraphPad) software. For determination of statistical significances of differences, Student's t test and one-way ANOVA were performed followed by multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. A p value of less than 0.05 was selected as the level of significance. As an indicator of oxidized proteins, the amount of protein-bound carbonyls were measured after UVA treatment according to Buss et al. (12Buss H. Chan T.P. Sluis K.B. Domigan N.M. Winterbourn C.C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) with modifications by Voss et al. (18Voss P. Horakova L. Jakstadt M. Kiekebusch D. Grune T. Free Radic. Res. 2006; 40: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The use of protein carbonyl groups as a biomarker of oxidative stress is widely accepted because of the relatively early formation and the stability of carbonylated proteins (19Levine R.L. Williams J.A. Stadtman E.R. Shacter E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar). The protein carbonyl content of cells was enhanced with increasing doses of UVA (Fig. 1A). Protein oxidation appears to be lower at higher doses of UVA (50 and 60 J/cm2). More specifically, the amount of soluble protein carbonyls is lower. We believe that this is because of a masking of carbonyl moieties from detection via DNP hydrazine by reaction of carbonyls with several other oxidized components of the cells and by an enhanced formation of aggregated proteins. It was shown in earlier studies (20Grune T. Reinheckel T. Joshi M. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2344-2351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 21Grune T. Reinheckel T. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15504-15509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) that the proteasome plays a major role in the degradation of oxidatively modified proteins. To test whether after UVA irradiation the proteasome is able to fulfill this task, we measured the proteasomal activity in fibroblast lysates after UVA treatment using the fluorogenic peptide succinyl-LLVY-methyl coumarin. Surprisingly, a clear decay of the proteasomal activity was detected, reaching a minimum at a dose of 30 J/cm2 (Fig. 1B). To further test whether this effect is because of an inhibition of the proteasome or due to a reduction of the presence of the proteasome, we determined the proteasome content by immunoblot. No change in the expression of the 20 S core proteasome subunits was observed (Fig. 1C). Therefore, we concluded that the reduction of proteasomal activity after UVA irradiation was because of inhibition of its catalytic activity. In this line we tested whether such effects also occur in vivo. Therefore, we next investigated protein carbonyls, proteasome activity, and proteasome content in sections of human skin biopsies exposed to UVA. Protein carbonyl content was increased, and proteasome activity was inhibited after UVA treatment (Fig. 2). Proteasome content and distribution was not changed because of UVA treatment (Fig. 2). 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining was used to show the nuclei of the cells. In summary, we could see a clear increase of protein carbonyl formation in UVA-exposed human skin and no decline in proteasome amount (Fig. 2). 1O2 is known to be formed as a consequence of UVA irradiation, and the effects on protein oxidation and extracellular matrix changes can be correlated to 1O2 formation (22Wlaschek M.

J. 1997; 324: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (1453) Google Scholar). To test the effect of 1O2 on proteasome inhibition after UVA, sodium azide (NaN3), a potent quencher of 1O2, was used in the model. NaN3 at 20 mm was shown to inhibit 1O2 formation caused by UVA irradiation (22Wlaschek M. Wenk J. Brenneisen P. Briviba K. Schwarz A. Sies H. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 25Klotz L.O. Briviba K. Sies H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 289-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Because NaN3 prevented the decline of the proteasome activity in our model (Fig. 3A), we concluded that 1O2 is the cause of the proteasomal inactivation. To confirm this we incubated fibroblasts with NDPO2 at millimolar concentrations, establishing pico-/low nanomolar steady-state concentrations of 1O2. As shown in Fig. 3B, proteasome activity was inhibited significantly by 1 mm NDPO2 in the cells (n = 3; p < 0.05). This was surprising because earlier studies by our group had demonstrated the resistance of the proteasome toward oxidative stress (13Reinheckel T. Sitte N. Ullrich O. Kuckelkorn U. Davies K.J. Grune T. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 637-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar, 26Grune T. Klotz L.O. Gieche J. Rudeck M. Sies H. Free Radic. Biol.

Therefore, we tested whether the isolated proteasome is also susceptible toward 1O2. However, this was not the case (Fig. 3C). Our conclusion was that either 1O2 generates an unknown intermediate product in cells, affecting the proteasomal activity, or that UVA has a 1O2-independent effect on proteasomal activity. Because the direct exposure of isolated proteasome to UVA even at much higher doses did not cause any loss of activity (Fig. 3D), it seems to be most likely that UVA affects cellular structures which in turn inhibit the proteasome. It was shown by us (20Grune T. Reinheckel T. Joshi M. Davies K.J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2344-2351Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 21Grune T. Reinheckel T.

Life Sci. 2007; 64: 2245-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) that protein aggregates are potential factors inhibiting the proteasome after oxidative stress. If indirect inhibition of proteasomal activity occurs as a result of UVA-induced generation of cellular protein aggregates, the proteasomal activity should be impaired along with the total rate of cellular proteolysis. Total proteolysis was measured by metabolic radiolabeling of the intracellular protein pool, and we could clearly demonstrate an inhibition in overall protein degradation in cells after UVA (n = 3; p < 0.05) (Fig. 3E). Our conclusion from this series of experiments was that UVA generates 1O2. We then hypothesized that 1O2 may cause oxidative formation of protein aggregates that in turn inhibit the proteasome. We, therefore, measured formation of protein aggregates. Because oxidatively modified proteins can form aggregates due to cross-linking and loss of solubility (34Grune T. Reinheckel T. Davies K.J. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 526-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 35McDuffee A.T. Senisterra G. Huntley S. Lepock J.R. Sekhar K.R. Meredith M.J. Borrelli M.J. Morrow J.D. Freeman M.L. J. Cell Physiol. 1997; 171: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), we determined the changes in protein detergent solubility to test for the formation of insoluble aggregates after UVA treatment. Cellular proteins were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine, and proteins which were soluble and insoluble in a detergent mixture were counted by liquid scintillation. In cells exposed to UVA at 30 J/cm2, the amount of detergent-soluble proteins was decreased by 35% (Fig. 4A) and detergent-insoluble proteins was increased 100% compared with nonirradiated cells (Fig. 4B) (n = 3; p < 0.05). Quenching singlet oxygen by the addition of azide ions completely abrogated UVA-induced loss of detergent-soluble protein (Fig. 4A) and UVA-induced increase in protein aggregate formation (Fig. 4B). This clearly indicates the formation of a fraction of highly cross-linked protein aggregates after a single exposure to UVA via singlet oxygen. To test whether the aggregate-induced inhibition of the proteasome is of any significance for cellular signaling and metabolism, we analyzed MMP-1 expression under these conditions. It is known that UVA changes MMP-1 and TIMP-1 expressions and that MMP-1 expression is elevated during skin aging. However, these changes of expression occur in a manner mechanistically not yet fully understood. Therefore, we tested whether the expression of MMP-1/TIMP-1 is changed in our fibroblast UVA exposure model. As demonstrated in Fig. 5, UVA irradiation led to significant increases in MMP-1 and decreases in TIMP-1 mRNA expressions (n = 3; p < 0.05). Therefore, we were able to mimic some of the in vivo effects of UVA. We next tested whether aggregate formation and the inhibition of the proteasome might play a role in the modulation of gene expression. To test the role of proteasomal inhibition on gene expression, we decided to use a model of proteasome inhibition by protein aggregates without UVA as described by us before (29Davies K.J. Shringarpure R. Neurology. 2006; 66: S93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 36Sommerburg O. Ullrich O. Sitte N. von Zglinicki D. Siems W. Grune T. Free Radic. Biol.

As a model for cross-linked, oxidized proteins, we chose lipofuscin, a fluorescent pigment of aggregated polymers derived from cross-linked oxidation products of proteins and lipids accumulating during aging (28Sitte N. Huber M. Grune T. Ladhoff A. Doecke W.D. Von Zglinicki T. Davies K.J. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1490-1498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Grune T. Jung T. Merker K. Davies K.J. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 2519-2530Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). We prepared lipofuscin from isolated erythrocyte membranes exposed to UV as described in detail previously (28Sitte N. Huber M. Grune T. Ladhoff A. Doecke W.D. Von Zglinicki T. Davies K.J. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1490-1498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and incubated dermal fibroblasts with this material. Because fibroblasts were described to readily incorporate such material (28Sitte N. Huber M. Grune T. Ladhoff A. Doecke W.D. Von Zglinicki T. Davies K.J. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 1490-1498Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we measured the uptake of lipofuscin into the cells by fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 6A). Quantitation of the results revealed a 5-fold increase in autofluorescence (Fig. 6B), accompanied by a decline in proteasomal activity similar to that detected after UVA treatment (Fig. 6C). Most importantly, proteasome inhibition by protein aggregates was also accompanied by an increased expression of MMP-1 (Fig. 6D) and a decrease in TIMP-1 expression (Fig. 6E). Immunochemical detection of MMP-1 and TIMP-1 was unsuccessful, probably because of the fact that both are secreted proteins, the detection of which is hampered by lipofuscin, which was present in the cell cult"
https://openalex.org/W2093101865,"Background The capabilities of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure structural and functional connectivity in the human brain have motivated growing interest in characterizing the relationship between these measures in the distributed neural networks of the brain. In this study, we attempted an integration of structural and functional analyses of the human language circuits, including Wernicke's (WA), Broca's (BA) and supplementary motor area (SMA), using a combination of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) and diffusion tensor MRI. Methodology/Principal Findings Functional connectivity was measured by low frequency inter-regional correlations of BOLD MRI signals acquired in a resting steady-state, and structural connectivity was measured by using adaptive fiber tracking with diffusion tensor MRI data. The results showed that different language pathways exhibited different structural and functional connectivity, indicating varying levels of inter-dependence in processing across regions. Along the path between BA and SMA, the fibers tracked generally formed a single bundle and the mean radius of the bundle was positively correlated with functional connectivity. However, fractional anisotropy was found not to be correlated with functional connectivity along paths connecting either BA and SMA or BA and WA. Conclusions/Significance These findings suggest that structure-function relations in the human language circuits may involve a number of confounding factors that need to be addressed. Nevertheless, the insights gained from this work offers a useful guidance for continued studies that may provide a non-invasive means to evaluate brain network integrity in vivo for use in diagnosing and determining disease progression and recovery."
https://openalex.org/W2046326345,"Anandamide (AEA) is an endogenous agonist of type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB1R) that, along with metabolic enzymes of AEA and congeners, compose the ""endocannabinoid system."" Here we report the biochemical, morphological, and functional characterization of the endocannabinoid system in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells that are an experimental model for neuronal cell damage and death, as well as for major human neurodegenerative disorders. We also show that AEA dose-dependently induced apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells. Through proteomic analysis, we further demonstrate that AEA-induced apoptosis was paralleled by an approximately 3 to approximately 5-fold up-regulation or down-regulation of five genes; IgG heavy chain-binding protein, stress-induced phosphoprotein-1, and triose-phosphate isomerase-1, which were up-regulated, are known to act as anti-apoptotic agents; actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 5 and peptidylprolyl isomerase-like protein 3 isoform PPIL3b were down-regulated, and the first is required for actin network formation whereas the second is still function-orphan. Interestingly, only the effect of AEA on BiP was reversed by the CB1R antagonist SR141716, in SH-SY5Y cells as well as in human neuroblastoma LAN-5 cells (that express a functional CB1R) but not in SK-NBE cells (which do not express CB1R). Silencing or overexpression of BiP increased or reduced, respectively, AEA-induced apoptosis of SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, the expression of BiP and of the BiP-related apoptotic markers p53 and PUMA was increased by AEA through a CB1R-dependent pathway that engages p38 and p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinases. Consistently, this effect of AEA was minimized by SR141716. In conclusion, we identified BiP as a key protein in neuronal apoptosis induced by AEA."
https://openalex.org/W2147549467,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is a ubiquitous cytokine with dual roles in tumor suppression and promotion, and these dichotomous functions have frustrated the development of therapies targeting oncogenic signaling by TGF-β. In comparison, Abl is well established as an initiator of hematopoietic cancers; however, a clear role for Abl in regulating solid tumor development remains elusive. Here, we investigated the role of Abl in TGF-β-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in normal and meta-static mammary epithelial cells (MECs). In doing so, we identified Abl as an essential regulator of MEC morphology and showed that Abl inactivation was sufficient to induce phenotypic and transcriptional EMT in normal MECs. Increasing Abl activity in metastatic MECs resulted in their complete morphological reversion, restored their cytostatic response to TGF-β, and blocked their secretion of matrix metalloproteinases induced by TGF-β. Constitutively active Abl expression blocked TGF-ß-responsive mammary tumor growth in mice, while Imatinib therapy afforded no clinical benefit in mice bearing mammary tumors. Collectively, this investigation establishes Abl as a potent mediator of MEC identity, and as a suppressor of oncogenic TGF-β signaling during mammary tumorigenesis. Notably, our findings strongly caution against the use of pharmacological Abl antagonists in the treatment of developing and progressing mammary tumors.— Allington, T. M., Galliher-Beckley, A.

https://openalex.org/W2008737373,"Background Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a plus-strand RNA virus that replicates by amplification of genomic RNA from minus strands leading to accumulation of almost one thousand copies per cell under in vitro cell culture conditions. In contrast, HCV RNA copy numbers in livers of infected patients appear to be much lower, estimated at a few copies per cell. Methodology/Principal Findings To gain insights into mechanisms that control HCV replication in vivo, we analyzed HCV RNA levels as well as expression of interferon beta (IFNβ) and several interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) from whole liver sections and micro-dissected subpopulations of hepatocytes in biopsy samples from 21 HCV-infected patients. The results showed that intrahepatic HCV RNA levels range form less than one copy per hepatocyte to a maximum of about eight. A correlation existed between viral RNA levels and IFNβ expression, but not between viral RNA and ISG levels. Also, IFNβ expression did not correlate with ISGs levels. Replication of HCV RNA occurred in focal areas in the liver in the presence of a general induction of ISGs. Conclusion/Significance The low average levels of HCV RNA in biopsy samples can be explained by focal distribution of infected hepatocytes. HCV replication directly induces IFNβ, which then activates ISGs. The apparent lack of a correlation between levels of IFNβ and ISG expression indicates that control of the innate immune response during HCV infections depends on multiple factors."
https://openalex.org/W2078764878,"Background Resistance Nodulation Division (RND) efflux pumps of Escherichia coli extrude antibiotics and toxic substances before they reach their intended targets. Whereas these pumps obtain their energy directly from the proton motive force (PMF), ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC) transporters, which can also extrude antibiotics, obtain energy from the hydrolysis of ATP. Because E. coli must pass through two pH distinct environments of the gastrointestinal system of the host, it must be able to extrude toxic agents at very acidic and at near neutral pH (bile salts in duodenum and colon for example). The herein described study examines the effect of pH on the extrusion of ethidium bromide (EB). Methodology/Principal Findings E. coli AG100 and its tetracycline induced progeny AG100TET that over-expresses the acrAB efflux pump were evaluated for their ability to extrude EB at pH 5 and 8, by our recently developed semi-automated fluorometric method. At pH 5 the organism extrudes EB without the need for metabolic energy (glucose), whereas at pH 8 extrusion of EB is dependent upon metabolic energy. Phe-Arg β-naphtylamide (PAβN), a commonly assumed inhibitor of RND efflux pumps has no effect on the extrusion of EB as others claim. However, it does cause accumulation of EB. Competition between EB and PAβN was demonstrated and suggested that PAβN was preferentially extruded. A Km representing competition between PAβN and EB has been calculated. Conclusions/Significance The results suggest that E. coli has two general efflux systems (not to be confused with a distinct efflux pump) that are activated at low and high pH, respectively, and that the one at high pH is probably a putative ABC transporter coded by msbA, which has significant homology to the ABC transporter coded by efrAB of Enterococcus faecalis, an organism that faces similar challenges as it makes its way through the toxic intestinal system of the host."
https://openalex.org/W2093364165,"Obesity and type 2 diabetes present partially overlapping phenotypes with systemic inflammation as a common feature, raising the hypothesis that elevated cytokine levels may contribute to peripheral insulin resistance as well as the decreased beta cell functional mass observed in type 2 diabetes. In healthy humans, TNF-alpha infusion induces skeletal muscle insulin resistance. We now explore the impact of TNF-alpha on primary beta cell function and the underlying signaling pathways. Human and rat primary beta cells were sorted by FACS and cultured for 24 h +/- 20 ng/ml TNF-alpha to explore the impact on apoptosis, proliferation, and short-term insulin secretion (1 h, 2.8 mm glucose followed by 1 h, 16.7 mm glucose at the end of the 24-h culture period) as well as key signaling protein phosphorylation and expression. Prior exposure to TNF-alpha for 24 h inhibits glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from primary beta cells. This is associated with a decrease in glucose-stimulated phosphorylation of key proteins in the insulin signaling pathway including Akt, AS160, and other Akt substrates, ERK as well as the insulin receptor. Strikingly, TNF-alpha treatment decreased IRS-2 protein level by 46 +/- 7% versus control, although mRNA expression was unchanged. While TNF-alpha treatment increased MAP4K4 mRNA expression by 33 +/- 5%, knockdown of MAP4K4 by siRNA-protected beta cells against the detrimental effects of TNF-alpha on both insulin secretion and signaling. We thus identify MAP4K4 as a key upstream mediator of TNF-alpha action on the beta cell, making it a potential therapeutic target for preservation of beta cell function in type 2 diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2108066317,"Cellular processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) has been extensively studied, but its precise function remains elusive. The intracellular domain of APP has been proposed to regulate expression of several genes by mechanisms that are largely unknown. We report that APP regulates expression of the aquaporin 1 (AQP1) gene in mouse embryonic fibroblasts and in transgenic mice. AQP1 mRNA and protein were down-regulated in fibroblasts lacking APP or presenilin 2 in which AQP1 expression was restored by stable expression of full-length APP or presenilin 2 but not by APP deleted from its carboxy-terminal domain. The transcriptional activity of the AQP1 gene promoter and the stability of AQP1 mRNA were identical in fibroblasts expressing or not expressing APP. Control of AQP1 expression by APP was sensitive to trichostatin A, an histone deacetylase inhibitor, and histone deacetylase activity coimmunoprecipitated with APP. Altogether, these data show that a presenilin-2- dependent γ-secretase activity releases the intracellular domain of APP involved in the epigenetic control of AQP1 expression. Since AQP1 is found in astrocytes surrounding senile plaques, this epigenetic control of AQP1 expression could have important implications in Alzheimer disease.—Huysseune, S., Kienlen-Campard, P., Hébert, S., Tasiaux, B., Leroy, K., Devuyst, O., Brion, J.-P., De Strooper, B., Octave, J.-N.

Cumulative evidences indicate that the deregulation of cyclin A2 is tightly linked to the chromosomal instability, neoplastic transformation and tumor proliferation. Here we report that treatment of chronic myelogenous leukaemia K562 cells with doxorubicin results in an accumulation of cyclin A2 and follows by induction of apoptotic cell death. To investigate the potential preclinical relevance, K562 cells were transiently transfected with the siRNA targeting cyclin A2 by functionalized single wall carbon nanotubes. Knocking down the expression of cyclin A2 in K562 cells suppressed doxorubicin-induced growth arrest and cell apoptosis. Upon administration with doxorubicin, K562 cells with reduced cyclin A2 showed a significant decrease in erythroid differentiation, and a small fraction of cells were differentiated along megakaryocytic and monocyte-macrophage pathways. The results demonstrate the pro-apoptotic role of cyclin A2 and suggest that cyclin A2 is a key regulator of cell differentiation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that knocking down expression of one gene switches differentiation pathways of human myeloid leukemia K562 cells."

Biochem. 2004; 92: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). More recently, the role of regucalcin or SMP30 was reported as a gluconolactonase (18Kondo Y. Inai Y. Sato Y. Handa S. Kubo S. Shimokado K. Goto S. Nishikimi M. Maruyama N. Ishigami A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 5723-5728Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Conversion of l-gulonate to l-gulonolactone is the penultimate step in the biosynthesis, the final step being oxidation to l-ascorbic acid by l-gulonolactone oxidase (19Linster C.L. Van Schaftingen E. FEBS J. 2007; 274: 1-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). It should be noted that it is the inactivity of the latter enzyme due to mutations that has led to the inability of humans, guinea pigs, and other species to synthesize vitamin C. In summary, regucalcin is thought to have a diverse role in proliferation, survival, and differentiation of cells (12Yamaguchi M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). human hepatocellular carcinoma reverse transcription chromatin immunoprecipitation small interfering RNA wild type knock-out fetal bovine serum immunohistochemistry deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling N-acetylcysteine partial hepatectomy glutamine synthetase Eagle's minimum essential medium T cell factor Our laboratory reported the characterization of the β-catenin conditional knock-out animals, which is an excellent resource for identification of novel targets of β-catenin in the liver (20Tan X. Behari J. Cieply B. Michalopoulos G.K. Monga S.P. Gastroenterology. 2006; 131: 1561-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Regucalcin was identified as one of the genes most affected by the loss of β-catenin. Here we report that regucalcin or SMP30 is indeed a downstream target of β-catenin signaling in the liver. The expression of SMP30 mirrored the activation of β-catenin during liver growth, regeneration, and in hepatocellular cancer. The promoter region of regucalcin was also characterized for β-catenin/TCF4 binding. Finally, we addressed the role of regucalcin as a target of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in the hepatocyte, which along with l-gulonolactone oxidase plays an important role in vitamin C biosynthesis and also regulates cell survival. Thus, regulation of SMP30 and l-gulonolactone oxidase expression by β-catenin contributes to a broader role of Wnt/β-catenin in liver homeostasis. Nineteen HCC from two different groups were used for this study. The first group (group 1, n = 9) had known activating β-catenin mutations (21Cieply B. Zeng G. Proverbs-Singh T. Geller D.A. Monga S.P. Hepatology. 2008; 49: 821-831Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar), and for the second group (group 2, n = 10), the β-catenin mutational status was unknown. Normal livers (from donor liver tissue) were available from four cases. Tissues from first group were processed for mRNA isolation and RT-PCR, whereas samples from the second group were processed for histology. Mouse models used in this study include a conditional β-catenin knock-out described previously (20Tan X. Behari J. Cieply B. Michalopoulos G.K. Monga S.P. Gastroenterology. 2006; 131: 1561-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar) and a stable β-catenin overexpressing transgenic mouse similar to one described previously (22Tan X. Apte U. Micsenyi A. Kotsagrelos E. Luo J.H. Ranganathan S. Monga D.K. Bell A. Michalopoulos G.K. Monga S.P. Gastroenterology. 2005; 129: 285-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). For the conditional knock-out, homozygous floxed β-catenin mice were bred to albumin-cre mice (both on a C57BL/6 background); the resulting mice, after another backcrossing to homozygous floxed β-catenin mice, resulted in conditional null mice with the genotype Ctnnb1loxp/loxp; Alb-Cre+/− (referred to in this paper as knock-out or KO mice) and controls with the genotype Ctnnb1loxp/loxp; Alb-Cre−/− or Ctnnb1loxp/Wt; and Alb-Cre−/− (referred to in this paper as wild-type or WT mice). The mice were sacrificed at 1-, 3-, and 6-month time points, and the livers were utilized for subsequent analysis. The β-catenin overexpressing transgenic mice (FVB strain) were generated similar to the albumin/β-catenin transgenic mice characterized previously (22Tan X. Apte U. Micsenyi A. Kotsagrelos E. Luo J.H. Ranganathan S. Monga D.K. Bell A. Michalopoulos G.K. Monga S.P. Gastroenterology. 2005; 129: 285-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), except in this strain, β-catenin carries a point mutation at serine 45 thus rendering it more stable overall. Rat liver tissue was obtained from partial hepatectomy studies, as described previously (20Tan X. Behari J. Cieply B. Michalopoulos G.K. Monga S.P. Gastroenterology. 2006; 131: 1561-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Frozen livers from partial hepatectomy studies were harvested for protein. For hydrodynamic delivery of naked DNA, 1 μg/g of body weight of Wnt-1 plasmid (Millipore, Billerica, MA) or pcDNA3 control plasmid (Invitrogen) was administered via hydrostatic tail vein injection to CD-1 mice weighing around 18 g, as described previously (23Apte U. Zeng G. Muller P. Tan X. Micsenyi A. Cieply B. Dai C. Liu Y. Kaestner K.H. Monga S.P. Hepatology. 2006; 44: 992-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 24Yang J. Chen S. Huang L. Michalopoulos G.K. Liu Y. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 848-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Eighteen hours after the injection, the mice were subjected to PHx. Mice were sacrificed at 30 h after PHx, and livers were processed for total and nuclear protein. Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared using the NE-PER nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagent kit as per the instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL). Hep3B and HepG2 human hepatoma cell lines described previously (25Majer B.J. Mersch-Sundermann V. Darroudi F. Laky B. de Wit K. Knasmüller S. Mutat. Res. 2004; 551: 153-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in EMEM (Cambrex, East Rutherford, NJ) with 10% FBS (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) in a humidity-saturated incubator with 5% CO2 maintained at 37 °C. mRNA was isolated and purified from 4- to 7-month-old WT and AFP/Alb/Ctnnb1 KO mice frozen livers using TRIzol (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed as described elsewhere (26Zeng G. Awan F. Otruba W. Muller P. Apte U. Tan X. Gandhi C. Demetris A.J. Monga S.P. Hepatology. 2007; 45: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The forward (F) and reverse (R) primers for mouse regucalcin and l-gulonolactone oxidase were selected using Primer Express software (PE Applied Biosystems) and produce a 413-bp product. Regucalcin F was 5′-GAT GCC CCA GTC AGT TCA GT-3′ and R was 5′-ATT CTG CGG TTG GAA ATC TG-3′; l-gulonolactone oxidase F was 5′-AAA ACT GGG CGA AGA CCT ATG-3′ and R was 5′-CCT TGT TGG TGT GAT CTT GGT-3′; β-actin primers were used as an internal control as F 5′-CAG CTG AGA GGG AAA TCG TG-3′ and R 5′-CGT TGC CAA TAG TGA TGA CC-3′ and produced a 150-bp product. PCR amplification was carried out as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 35 or 28 cycles (for semi-quantitative PCR) of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and 10 min of final extension at 72 °C. For real time PCR, following DNase treatment, mRNA was converted to cDNA (23Apte U. Zeng G. Muller P. Tan X. Micsenyi A. Cieply B. Dai C. Liu Y. Kaestner K.H. Monga S.P. Hepatology. 2006; 44: 992-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Real time PCR was performed as described previously (27Köhler C. Bell A.W. Bowen W.C. Monga S.P. Fleig W. Michalopoulos G.K. Hepatology. 2004; 39: 1056-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). TaqMan Gene Expression Assays for human regucalcin and β-actin were obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). The standard conditions used for real time PCR were as follows: 50 °C for 2 min and 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 15 s of denaturation at 95 °C and 1 min of annealing/elongation at 60 °C. TaqMan signal (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) was measured in each step. Changes in regucalcin mRNA were normalized to actin mRNA for each sample and presented as fold-change over the average from four normal livers. In hepatoma cell lines, the expression of regucalcin gene was expressed as the ΔΔCt method (28Fleige S. Walf V. Huch S. Prgomet C. Sehm J. Pfaffl M.W. Biotechnol. Lett. 2006; 28: 1601-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Each sample was run in triplicate. Whole-cell lysates from mouse livers, cell cultures, and human tumor tissues were prepared and assayed in RIPA buffer as described elsewhere (29Monga S.P. Pediaditakis P. Mule K. Stolz D.B. Michalopoulos G.K. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1098-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation studies with regucalcin/SMP30 antibody and β-catenin antibody were done using standard protocol discussed elsewhere (29Monga S.P. Pediaditakis P. Mule K. Stolz D.B. Michalopoulos G.K. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1098-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Proteins were electrophoresed and blotted as described previously (29Monga S.P. Pediaditakis P. Mule K. Stolz D.B. Michalopoulos G.K. Hepatology. 2001; 33: 1098-1109Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Membranes were stained with Ponceau-S solution to confirm transfer and equal loading. Primary antibodies used in this study were against regucalcin/SMP30 (K-18 used at 1:500; C-16 used at 1:150), β-catenin (used at 1:200), GS (used at 1:500) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and actin (used at 1:5000) (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies used in the study included goat anti-mouse (1:10,000), donkey anti-rabbit (1:10,000), and donkey anti-goat (1:2500) (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Proteins were detected by application of the Super-Signal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate to the membranes (Pierce). Blots were stripped with IgG elution buffer (Pierce) for re-probing. Densitometry analysis was performed using Image J version 1.38. All experiments were performed in triplicate, and representative results are shown. IHC on paraffin-embedded sections was performed on mouse livers and human tumors as described elsewhere (30Michalopoulos G.K. Bowen W.C. Mulè K. Stolz D.B. Am. J. Pathol. 2001; 159: 1877-1887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used were against β-catenin (1:200), SMP30/regucalcin (1:100), GS (1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and β-catenin (1:50) (BD Biosciences). Secondary antibodies were horse anti-mouse (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA), goat anti-rabbit, and donkey anti-goat (Chemicon, Temecula, CA), all used at a 1:500 dilution. IHC was performed using the Vectastain ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) and developed using either 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) or 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole substrate (Scytek Laboratories, Logan, UT). The slides were counterstained with aqueous Gill's hematoxylin and mounted with either crystal mount or cytoseal (Biomeda Corp., Foster City, CA). For β-catenin, GS, and regucalcin expression in HCC, each sample was allocated an arbitrary IHC score on the basis of the intensity of the expression of β-catenin, GS, and regucalcin in the nucleus and/or cytosol as compared with the normal liver samples. Each stain was scored as − (absent staining), + (positive, similar to normal), and ++ (strongly positive or greater than normal). For β-catenin IHC, even a subset of HCC cells showing nuclear and/or cytoplasmic localization was assigned + score. Coverslip-plated HepG2 or Hep3B hepatoma cells were processed for immunofluorescence as described previously (31Bell A.W. Michalopoulos G.K. Hepatology. 2006; 44: 186-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies against β-catenin (1:100) and SMP30 (also known as regucalcin) (1:100) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were utilized. Secondary antibodies included donkey anti-goat Alexa 488 and donkey anti-mouse Cy3 at either 1:500 or 1:1000 dilutions (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Hoechst stain was used as nuclear counter stain. All fluorescence labeling was imaged under Zeiss Axiovert 40 CFL microscope, and photographs were obtained by Zeiss Axiocam MRC5 digital camera. The reporter gene plasmids were generated by cloning restriction fragments, which were isolated from the 5′-flanking region of the human regucalcin gene. The DNA fragments have an average size of 900 bp and typically cover the sequence from 864 bp upstream to 102 bp downstream of the transcription start site (Homo sapiens regucalcin mRNA, NM_004683) in H. sapiens chromosome X (NC_000023). The genomic DNA was extracted for normal human liver tissues using DNAzol (Molecular Research Center Inc., Cincinnati, OH) as described previously (32Zeng G. Germinaro M. Micsenyi A. Monga N.K. Bell A. Sood A. Malhotra V. Sood N. Midda V. Monga D.K. Kokkinakis D.M. Monga S.P. Neoplasia. 2006; 8: 279-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was used as a template for PCR amplification, and primer pairs were used to obtain the following eight fragments: A fragment, −864/+102 (four TCF-4E-binding sites); B fragment, −864/−307 (three TCF-4E-binding sites); C fragment, −676/+102 (one TCF-4E-binding site); C1 fragment, the C fragment cut with SmaI, which removes 109 bp (from −180 to −71) (no TCF-4E-binding sites); D fragment, −306/+102 (one TCF4E-binding site); D1 fragment, the D fragment cut with SmaI, which removes 109 bp (from −180 to −71) (no TCF-4E-binding sites); E fragment, −103/+102 (no TCF-4E-binding sites); control, no DNA fragment (luciferase only). Primers for all the fragments are shown in Table 1. The sense primers were designed to contain a SacI restriction enzyme cutting site (GAGCTC) and the antisense primers to contain an XhoI restriction enzyme cutting site (CTCGAG). After PCR amplification and digestion with the restriction enzymes, the DNA fragments were purified and ligated into the pGL3-Basic vector containing the firefly luciferase gene. Further digestion with SmaI was used to create the C1 and D1 fragments.TABLE 1Primer pairs used in the construction of regucalcin promoter fragmentsForward primerReverse primerA fragment, −864/+1025′-GATCATGAGCTCGTAGAGACGGGGTTTCACCA-3′5′-TCTAGACTCGAGCAGTCGCCTTCTGGGAGAT-3′B fragment, −864/−3075′-GATCATGAGCTCGTAGAGACGGGGTTTCACCA-3′5′-TCTAGACTCGAGTTAAACCCAAACAGGTTAAAAAG-3′C fragment, −676/+1025′-GATCATGAGCTCTCACTTTGTTGCCAGGTTCA-3′5′-TCTAGACTCGAGCAGTCGCCTTCTGGGAGAT-3′D fragment, −306/+1025′-CATAGTGAGCTCCCGTCCCAGTCTCTCTCTGT-3′5′-TCTAGACTCGAGCAGTCGCCTTCTGGGAGAT-3′E fragment, −103/+1025′-CATAGTGAGCTCCATGCCATCCACCTGCCAAGC-3′5′-TCTAGACTCGAGCAGTCGCCTTCTGGGAGAT-3′ Open table in a new tab For the transfection experiments, human HepG2 cells were grown on 6-well plates to ∼70% confluence and transiently transfected. A total of 2 μg of the pGL3-Basic vector containing the DNA fragments was cotransfected with the internal control reporter Renilla reniformis luciferase into HepG2 cells using FuGENE HD reagent (Roche Applied Science) (33Behari J. Zeng G. Otruba W. Thompson M.D. Muller P. Micsenyi A. Sekhon S.S. Leoni L. Monga S.P. J. Hepatol. 2007; 46: 849-857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, luciferase activity was assayed using the Dual Luciferase assay system kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Madison, WI). Relative luciferase activity (arbitrary units) was reported as fold induction after normalization for transfection efficiency. ChIP assay was performed according to the chromatin immunoprecipitation kit manual (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Briefly, HepG2 and Hep3B cells (2 × l07 cells) were fixed with 1% formaldehyde and then neutralized by adding 0.125 m glycine. Cells were collected and lysed in Cell Lysis buffer and then sonicated to obtain soluble chromatin with an average length of 1000 bp. After a 1:10 dilution, chromatin solutions were precleared by protein G-agarose and then incubated with no antibody (control), anti-β-catenin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-TCF-4 antibody (Upstate) at 4 °C overnight on a rotating platform. The immune complexes were recovered with protein G-agarose. After extensive washing, the bound DNA fragments were eluted and subjected to PCRs using the following primer pairs located in the regucalcin promoter: 5′-CCG TCC CAG TCT CTC TCT GT-3′ (−306 to −287) and 5′-CCG CGG CTG GAA GAA TCC TG-3′ (−139 to −158). The products were separated by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel and visualized. Hepatocytes from β-catenin KO mice were isolated as described previously and seeded on chamber slides wet-coated with collagen at a density of 100,000 cells per ml in minimal essential media supplemented with 10% FBS (34Kaimori A. Potter J. Kaimori J.Y. Wang C. Mezey E. Koteish A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 22089-22101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). After 2 h, media were changed to a chemically defined minimal essential media-based growth medium containing insulin/transferrin/selenium (1 g/liter), dexamethasone (10−7 m), hepatocyte growth factor (40 ng/ml), and epidermal growth factor (25 ng/ml) as described elsewhere (35Block G.D.

The cells were cultured for 48 h in the presence or absence of ascorbic acid at 0.2 mm final concentration (36Barroso M.P. Gómez-Diaz C. Lopez-Lluch G. Malagón M.M. Crane F.L. Navas P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 343: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). TUNEL analysis is described below. Rat hepatocytes were isolated and plated as discussed elsewhere (35Block G.D. Locker J.

After 2 h, media were replaced with basal media and 5 ng/ml recombinant mouse Wnt3a (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) or phosphate-buffered saline. Plates were harvested for nuclear protein 24 h after treatment. Hep3B and HepG2 human hepatoma cell lines were seeded onto either 100-mm dishes or 6-well plates and maintained until the cells reached 50–60% confluence in EMEM (ATCC, Manassas, VA) with 10% FBS. Two independent siRNAs were utilized for transfection. Cells were transfected with siRNA purchased from either Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO) or Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). 100 nm control siRNA or siRNA against human regucalcin mRNA from Dharmacon was transfected into cells using Oligofectamine transfection reagent (Invitrogen) in the absence of serum for 4 h. After incubation with siRNA, EMEM with 10% FBS was added to the cells without removal of the siRNA mixture. Media were changed 24 h after transfection, and fresh EMEM with 10% FBS was added. Plates were harvested for protein 48 h after addition of siRNA. Cells were transfected with 5 nm of either control siRNA or siRNA against human regucalcin mRNA from Applied Biosystems using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) in the presence of serum. Media were changed 24 h after transfection, and fresh EMEM with 10% FBS was added. Plates were harvested for protein and RNA 48 h after addition of siRNA. Experiments were done in triplicate, and representative results are presented. A [3H]thymidine uptake assay was performed in Hep3B and HepG2 cells after siRNA treatments as described previously to measure cell proliferation (37Zeng G. Apte U. Cieply B. Singh S. Monga S.P. Neoplasia. 2007; 9: 951-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells cultured on chamber slides were dosed with either control or with human regucalcin siRNA in the presence or absence of ascorbic acid at 0.2 mm final concentration or of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) at 20 mm final concentration in 10× phosphate-buffered saline as reported elsewhere (36Barroso M.P.

Toxicol. Sci. 2004; 80: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). 48 h after treatment, slides were fixed in a 3:1 solution of methanol/glacial acetic acid for 5 min and allowed to air-dry. The detection of apoptotic nuclei was determined by terminal TUNEL staining using the ApopTag peroxidase kit (Intergen Co., Purchase, NY) as described previously (39Monga S.P. Monga H.K. Tan X. Mulé K. Pediaditakis P. Michalopoulos G.K. Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 202-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The numbers of positive cells per field were counted, for a total of five fields per condition. Assays were done in triplicates, and statistical assessment for significance was performed by the Student's t test, and a p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Sera from age- and sex-matched WT and β-catenin KO mice (n = 3) were utilized to determine ascorbate levels with the ascorbic acid assay kit II (Bio-Vision, Mountain View, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Livers from 1-, 3-, and 6-month-old WT controls and KO mice were used for isolation of mRNA, protein, and for IHC. Gene array analysis of β-catenin knock-out mice generated using three different Cre lines reveals a severalfold decrease in gene expression for regucalcin in β-catenin KOs as compared with their wild-type counterparts (Table 2) (20Tan X.

https://openalex.org/W1995099683,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is an inflammatory disorder associated with reduced alveolar-capillary barrier function, increased pulmonary vascular permeability, and infiltration of leukocytes into the alveolar space. Pulmonary function might be compromised, its most severe form being the acute respiratory distress syndrome. A protein central to physiological barrier properties is vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). Given the fact that VASP expression is reduced during periods of cellular hypoxia, we investigated the role of VASP during ALI. Initial studies revealed reduced VASP expressional levels through cyto-kines in vitro. Studies in the putative human VASP promoter identified NF-κB as a key regulator of VASP transcription. This VASP repression results in increased paracellular permeability and migration of neutrophils in vitro. In a model of LPS-induced ALI, VASP −/− mice demonstrated increased pulmonary damage compared with wild-type animals. These findings were confirmed in a second model of ventilator-induced lung injury. Studies employing bone marrow chimeric animals identified tissue-specific repression of VASP as the underlying cause of decreased barrier properties of the alveolar-capillary barrier during ALI. Taken together these studies identify tissue-specific VASP as a central protein in the control of the alveolar-capillary barrier properties during ALI.—Henes, J., Schmit, M. A., Morote-Garcia, J.

These records not only document a new scientific insight or new method developed, but they also carefully cite prior work upon which the innovation is built.We quantify the impact of information flow across fields using two large citation dataset: one spanning over a century of scholarly work in the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities, and second spanning a quarter century of United States patents.We find that a publication's citing across disciplines is tied to its subsequent impact. In the case of patents and natural science publications, those that are cited at least once are cited slightly more when they draw on research outside of their area. In contrast, in the social sciences, citing within one's own field tends to be positively correlated with impact."
https://openalex.org/W2007402386,"The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha1 (nAChRalpha1) was investigated as a potential fibrogenic molecule in the kidney, given reports that it may be an alternative urokinase (urokinase plasminogen activator; uPA) receptor in addition to the classical receptor uPAR. In a mouse obstructive uropathy model of chronic kidney disease, interstitial fibroblasts were identified as the primary cell type that bears nAChRalpha1 during fibrogenesis. Silencing of the nAChRalpha1 gene led to significantly fewer interstitial alphaSMA(+) myofibroblasts (2.8 times decreased), reduced interstitial cell proliferation (2.6 times decreased), better tubular cell preservation (E-cadherin 14 times increased), and reduced fibrosis severity (24% decrease in total collagen). The myofibroblast-inhibiting effect of nAChRalpha1 silencing in uPA-sufficient mice disappeared in uPA-null mice, suggesting that a uPA-dependent fibroblastic nAChRalpha1 pathway promotes renal fibrosis. To further establish this possible ligand-receptor relationship and to identify downstream signaling pathways, in vitro studies were performed using primary cultures of renal fibroblasts. (35)S-Labeled uPA bound to nAChRalpha1 with a K(d) of 1.6 x 10(-8) m, which was displaced by the specific nAChRalpha1 inhibitor d-tubocurarine in a dose-dependent manner. Pre-exposure of uPA to the fibroblasts inhibited [(3)H]nicotine binding. The uPA binding induced a cellular calcium influx and an inward membrane current that was entirely prevented by d-tubocurarine preincubation or nAChRalpha1 silencing. By mass spectrometry phosphoproteome analyses, uPA stimulation phosphorylated nAChRalpha1 and a complex of signaling proteins, including calcium-binding proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, and a nucleoprotein. This signaling pathway appears to regulate the expression of a group of genes that transform renal fibroblasts into more active myofibroblasts characterized by enhanced proliferation and contractility. This new fibrosis-promoting pathway may also be relevant to disorders that extend beyond chronic kidney disease."
https://openalex.org/W1991256799,"CCAAT/enhancer-binding Protein β (C/EBPβ) is a member of the bZIP transcription factor family that is expressed in various tissues, including cells of the hematopoietic system. C/EBPβ is involved in tissue-specific gene expression and thereby takes part in fundamental cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation. Here, we show that the activity of C/EBPβ is negatively regulated by the transcriptional co-repressor Daxx. C/EBPβ was found to directly interact with Daxx after overexpression as well as on the endogenous level. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays showed that Daxx binds via amino acids 190–400 to the C-terminal part of C/EBPβ. Co-expression of C/EBPβ changed the sub-nuclear Daxx distribution pattern from predominantly POD-localized to nucleoplasmic. Daxx suppressed basal and p300-enhanced transcriptional activity of C/EBPβ. Furthermore, Daxx decreased the C/EBPβ-dependent phosphorylation of p300, which in turn was associated with a diminished level of p300-mediated C/EBPβ acetylation. Co-expression of promyelocytic leukemia protein abrogated the repressive effect of Daxx on C/EBPβ as well as the direct interaction of Daxx and C/EBPβ, presumably by re-recruiting Daxx to PML-oncogenic domains. In acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells, C/EBPβ activity is known to be required for all-trans-retinoic acid-induced cell differentiation and disease remission. We show that all-trans-retinoic acid as well as arsenic trioxide treatment leads to a reduced C/EBPβ fraction associated with Daxx suggesting a relief of Daxx-dependent C/EBPβ repression as an important molecular event leading to APL cell differentiation. Overall, our data identify Daxx as a new negative regulator of C/EBPβ and provide first clues for a link between abrogation of Daxx-C/EBPβ complex formation and APL remission. CCAAT/enhancer-binding Protein β (C/EBPβ) is a member of the bZIP transcription factor family that is expressed in various tissues, including cells of the hematopoietic system. C/EBPβ is involved in tissue-specific gene expression and thereby takes part in fundamental cellular processes such as proliferation and differentiation. Here, we show that the activity of C/EBPβ is negatively regulated by the transcriptional co-repressor Daxx. C/EBPβ was found to directly interact with Daxx after overexpression as well as on the endogenous level. Glutathione S-transferase pulldown assays showed that Daxx binds via amino acids 190–400 to the C-terminal part of C/EBPβ. Co-expression of C/EBPβ changed the sub-nuclear Daxx distribution pattern from predominantly POD-localized to nucleoplasmic. Daxx suppressed basal and p300-enhanced transcriptional activity of C/EBPβ. Furthermore, Daxx decreased the C/EBPβ-dependent phosphorylation of p300, which in turn was associated with a diminished level of p300-mediated C/EBPβ acetylation.

Common to all C/EBP proteins is the highly conserved C-terminal basic region leucine zipper DNA binding domain, which also mediates a large number of protein-protein interactions (1Nerlov C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In addition, C/EBPβ contains an N-terminal transactivation domain and a central regulatory motif, which has an autoinhibitory function (2Kowenz-Leutz E. Twamley G. Ansieau S. Leutz A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2781-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ is expressed in various different cell types, including hepatic cells, fat cells, and cells of the hematopoietic system such as granulocytes and macrophages (1Nerlov C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Due to alternative translation initiation C/EBPβ is present in three isoforms referred to as LAP1 (full-length), LAP2 (residues 22–296), and the inhibitory LIP form (151–296) (3Calkhoven C.F. Müller C. Leutz A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1920-1932PubMed Google Scholar). By regulating tissue-specific gene expression C/EBPβ is implicated in essential cellular processes like differentiation and proliferation and also exerts crucial functions during tumorigenesis (4Sundfeldt K.

Smart R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002; 99: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In the latter context, Duprez et al. recently demonstrated that C/EBPβ activity is required during all-trans-retinoic acid- (ATRA)-induced differentiation of APL cells (6Duprez E. Wagner K. Koch H. Tenen D.G. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5806-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Transcriptional activity of C/EBPβ was shown to involve the recruitment of co-regulatory components leading to post-translational modifications of C/EBPβ such as phosphorylation, sumoylation, and acetylation (7Berberich-Siebelt F.

For instance, p300, CBP and GCN5 directly bind to C/EBPβ and via their intrinsic acetyltransferase activity trigger C/EBPβ acetylation leading to an increase in transcriptional C/EBPβ activity (12Kovács K.A.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2703-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Interestingly, C/EBPβ reciprocally enhances the co-activator capability of p300 by supporting the phosphorylation of p300 thus indicating a complex interdependent regulation of both proteins (15Schwartz C. Beck K. Mink S. Schmolke M. Budde B. Wenning D. Klempnauer K.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Deacetylation of C/EBPβ is controlled by the histone deacetylase HDAC1, which results in repression of transcriptional activity (9Ceseña T.I. Cui T.X. Subramanian L. Fulton C.T. Iñiguez-Lluhí J.A. Kwok R.P. Schwartz J. Mol. Cell Endocrinol. 2008; 289: 94-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Additional to the basic function of transcription factors to support RNA synthesis of a given gene, we previously showed that C/EBPβ is also involved in the very early steps of transcription initiation by triggering chromatin opening (16Plachetka A. Chayka O. Wilczek C. Melnik S. Bonifer C. Klempnauer K.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 28: 2102-2112Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Daxx was initially identified as a pro-apoptotic protein that binds to the death domain of the CD95 death receptor (17Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). By activating the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase-pathway Daxx was shown to enhance CD95-mediated as well as transforming growth factor-β-dependent apoptosis (17Yang X. Khosravi-Far R. Chang H.Y. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 89: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 18Perlman R. Schiemann W.P. Brooks M.W. Lodish H.F. Weinberg R.A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 708-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Daxx down-regulation by RNA interference is also associated with an increased level of apoptosis (19Chen L.Y. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 7108-7121Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Moreover, targeted disruption of the murine Daxx gene results in embryonic lethality due to extensive global apoptosis, suggesting Daxx acts in a rather anti-apoptotic manner (20Michaelson J.S. Bader D. Kuo F. Kozak C. Leder P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1918-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Besides its controversial role during apoptosis, Daxx is a well established regulator of transcription. Daxx binds to the transcriptional co-regulators CBP and HDAC as well as to numerous transcription factors, including members of the Pax and p53 families, ETS1, glucocorticoid, and androgen receptor (21Hollenbach A.D.

Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2177-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In most cases, Daxx serves as a transcriptional repressor presumably through recruitment of HDAC proteins as demonstrated for the repression of p53, the co-activator CBP, and the impact of Daxx on the expression of c-met (22Kim E.J. Park J.S. Um S.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5356-5367Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23Kuo H.Y. Chang C.C. Jeng J.C. Hu H.M. Lin D.Y. Maul G.G. Kwok R.P. Shih H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2177-2186Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, Daxx was also reported to act in an HDAC-independent manner and even to trigger the activity of certain transcription factors such as HSF1 and Pax5, thus indicating Daxx does not act exclusively as a transcriptional repressor (30Boellmann F. Guettouche T. Guo Y. Fenna M. Mnayer L. Voellmy R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 4100-4105Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 31Emelyanov A.V. Kovac C.R.

Jung Y. Byun B. Ahn J.K. Joe C.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Moreover, beyond affecting transcription by binding to transcription factors recent findings point toward a role of Daxx in modulation of chromatin remodeling and DNA methylation, which indicates that Daxx may control gene expression also via epigenetic mechanisms (33Hollenbach A.D. McPherson C.J. Mientjes E.J. Iyengar R. Grosveld G. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Puto L.A. Reed J.C.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 10635-10640Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Consistent with the involvement in transcriptional regulation Daxx is predominantly a nuclear protein. Here, it mainly localizes to sub-nuclear structures called PML-oncogenic domains (PODs) by binding to SUMO-modified PML (36Ishov A.M. Sotnikov A.G. Negorev D. Vladimirova O.V. Neff N. Kamitani T. Yeh E.T. Strauss 3rd, J.F. Maul G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). According to this, recently a SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) within the C-terminal tail of Daxx was identified that is responsible for the association with PML and several other transcription factors which also require sumoylation for Daxx binding (37Lin D.Y. Huang Y.S. Jeng J.C. Kuo H.Y. Chang C.C. Chao T.T. Ho C.C. Chen Y.C. Lin T.P. Fang H.I. Hung C.C. Suen C.S. Hwang M.J. Chang K.S. Maul G.G. Shih H.M. Mol. Cell. 2006; 24: 341-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that the repressor activity of Daxx is controlled by subnuclear compartmentalization. For instance, PML expression relieves the repressive effect of Daxx on Pax3 and glucocorticoid receptor-dependent transcription by sequestering Daxx to PODs (24Lehembre F. Müller S. Pandolfi P.P. Dejean A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 27Lin D.Y. Lai M.Z. Ann D.K. Shih H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15958-15965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In a similar way MSP58 and ASK1 were shown to inhibit the Daxx-mediated transcriptional repression by recruiting Daxx to the nucleolus and the cytoplasm, respectively (38Ko Y.G. Kang Y.S. Park H. Seol W. Kim J. Kim T. Park H.S. Choi E.J. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 39103-39106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 39Lin D.Y. Shih H.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25446-25456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore it might be reasonable to assume that nucleoplasmic Daxx resembles the active fraction of the protein while localization to other compartments could be regarded as “out of action Daxx,” at least with respect to transcriptional regulation. Consistent with this idea, the constitutive repressor activity of Daxx that was proposed to be involved in the formation of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) was shown to be related to its aberrant localization pattern (25Li H. Leo C. Zhu J. Wu X. O'Neil J. Park E.J. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1784-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 40Zhu J. Zhou J. Peres L. Riaucoux F. Honoré N. Kogan S. de Thé H. Cancer Cell. 2005; 7: 143-153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In APL cells POD formation is disrupted due to the expression of the oncogenic PML-RARα fusion protein leading to de-localization of POD-associated proteins such as Daxx (25Li H. Leo C. Zhu J. Wu X. O'Neil J. Park E.J. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1784-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 41de Thé H. Chomienne C. Lanotte M. Degos L. Dejean A.

Cell. 1991; 66: 663-674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). Interestingly, treatment with ATRA or As2O3 both of which induce differentiation and cause disease remission results in re-organization of POD structure and a PML-dependent recruitment of Daxx to PODs (25Li H. Leo C. Zhu J. Wu X. O'Neil J. Park E.J. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1784-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). This in turn is again associated with a relief of Daxx-dependent transcriptional repression suggesting that Daxx (like C/EBPβ, as mentioned above) is involved in the pathology of APL (25Li H. Leo C. Zhu J. Wu X. O'Neil J. Park E.J. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1784-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar).In the present study we report on the identification of Daxx as a new negative regulator of the transcription factor C/EBPβ. We show that Daxx binds to C/EBPβ and represses the p300 induced acetylation and transcriptional activity of C/EBPβ. The interaction of C/EBPβ and Daxx is accompanied by a localization change of Daxx leading to its release from PODs. Accordingly, the association of Daxx and C/EBPβ is inhibited by PML expression resulting in the de-repression of C/EBPβ-dependent transcription. Finally, we show that, upon differentiation of APL cells, the complex between C/EBPβ and Daxx is released. This in turn suggests that the relief of Daxx-dependent C/EBPβ repression is an important contribution to the C/EBPβ activation, which was recently shown to be required for terminal APL differentiation.DISCUSSIONThe transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β (C/EBPβ) is a member of the C/EBP family and is involved in the control of cell type-specific gene expression of various tissues, including hematopoietic cells (1Nerlov C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2008; 20: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). C/EBPβ activity is controlled by several co-stimulatory factors such as p300/CBP, G9a, or GCN5 leading to an increase in transcriptional activity (12Kovács K.A. Steinmann M. Magistretti P.J. Halfon O. Cardinaux J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 36959-36965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 13Mink S. Haenig B. Klempnauer K.H. Mol.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 2703-2708Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). By contrast, factors that negatively affect C/EBPβ activity have been poorly detected. Here, we have demonstrated that Daxx is a novel negative regulator of C/EBPβ. Daxx was found to interact with C/EBPβ in transfected cells as well as on the level of the endogenous proteins. In vitro interaction experiments have mapped the regions of both proteins responsible for their interaction to the C-terminal bZIP domain of C/EBPβ and a central region (amino acids 190–400) of Daxx. Daxx inhibited C/EBPβ and p300-stimulated C/EBPβ transcriptional activity as assayed by the activation of a C/EBPβ-dependent reporter gene and of a chromatin-embedded endogenous C/EBPβ-inducible gene. Taken together, these data identify Daxx as an inhibitor of C/EBPβ transcriptional activity. Previous work has established strong links between sumoylation and Daxx-mediated repression of the activity of several transcription factors, such as Smad4 (45Chang C.C. Lin D.Y. Fang H.I. Chen R.H.

The identification of an SIM at the C terminus of Daxx (37Lin D.Y. Huang Y.S. Jeng J.C. Kuo H.Y. Chang C.C. Chao T.T. Ho C.C. Chen Y.C. Lin T.P. Fang H.I. Hung C.C. Suen C.S. Hwang M.J. Chang K.S.

The binding of Daxx to C/EBPβ is not mediated by the C-terminal domain of Daxx, which harbors the SIM, but with the poorly characterized central region that encompasses a coiled-coil domain, as shown in Fig. 2C. Furthermore, the sumoylation site of C/EBPβ is located in the central negative regulatory domain of C/EBPβ around lysine 134 (of the rat homologue) and not within the C-terminal domain of the protein that binds to Daxx (7Berberich-Siebelt F.

Of note, the C-terminal domain of C/EBPβ is also required for the binding to Smad3, which is also associated with a transcriptional repression of C/EBPβ (56Choy L. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9609-9619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar).The interaction of Daxx and C/EBPβ resulted in obvious changes of the subnuclear localization of Daxx. In the absence of C/EBPβ, Daxx localized mainly to PODs, as also shown by others (25Li H. Leo C. Zhu J. Wu X. O'Neil J. Park E.J. Chen J.D. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 1784-1796Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 36Ishov A.M. Sotnikov A.G. Negorev D. Vladimirova O.V. Neff N. Kamitani T. Yeh E.T. Strauss 3rd, J.F. Maul G.G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 221-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). In the presence of C/EBPβ, Daxx was re-distributed and a significant fraction co-localized with C/EBPβ in the nucleoplasm. Our data indicate that the decrease in POD-associated Daxx induced by C/EBPβ was not due to a general disturbance of POD structures but rather might reflect a competition of POD-associated proteins (presumably PML) and C/EBPβ for recruitment of Daxx. This notion was also supported by the observation that increased expression of PML disrupts the C/EBPβ-Daxx interaction and additionally abrogates the repressive effect of Daxx on the C/EBPβ-dependent transcription.How does Daxx inhibit the activity of C/EBPβ? Although Daxx binds to the part of C/EBPβ that harbors its DNA-binding domain, Daxx appears not to interfere with DNA binding of C/EBPβ but rather with the cooperation of C/EBPβ and p300. We and others have shown previously that the activity of C/EBPβ is enhanced by the recruitment of the coactivator p300/CBP (13Mink S. Haenig B. Klempnauer K.H. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 6609-6617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 57Oelgeschläger M. Janknecht R. Krieg J. Schreek S. Lüscher B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2771-2780Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Moreover, we showed that the interaction of p300 with C/EBPβ triggers the phosphorylation of p300 by an as yet unknown protein kinase, thereby stimulating the activity of p300 as co-activator of C/EBPβ (15Schwartz C. Beck K. Mink S. Schmolke M. Budde B. Wenning D. Klempnauer K.H. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Our results clearly demonstrate that Daxx disrupts the cooperation of C/EBPβ and p300, as evidenced by inhibitory effects of Daxx on p300-stimulated transcriptional activity of C/EBPβ, on the C/EBPβ-induced phosphorylation of p300 and on the p300-dependent acetylation of C/EBPβ. How Daxx inhibits the C/EBPβ-induced phosphorylation of p300 and the acetylation of C/EBPβ and whether both inhibitory effects are linked is currently under investigation. Phosphorylation is known to increase the HAT activity of p300 (48Aikawa Y. Nguyen L.A. Isono K. Takakura N. Tagata Y. Schmitz M.L. Koseki H. Kitabayashi I. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 3955-3965Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar); it is therefore possible that the inhibitory effect of Daxx on C/EBPβ acetylation is a consequence of the diminished phosphorylation of p300. Because Daxx is known to bind to different HDACs (23Kuo H.Y. Chang C.C. Jeng J.C. Hu H.M. Lin D.Y. Maul G.G. Kwok R.P. Shih H.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3319-3330Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) the diminished acetylation of C/EBPβ might, in principle, also be due to the Daxx-mediated recruitment of HDACs to C/EBPβ. However, we found that inhibitory effect of Daxx on C/EBPβ acetylation was not abrogated by TSA, arguing for a HDAC-independent mechanism of Daxx-mediated repression. In any case, as acetylation is known to increase the transcriptional activity of C/EBPβ, the suppression of acetylation by Daxx probably accounts for the decreased activity of C/EBPβ as also demonstrated for Daxx-mediated inhibition of the NF-κB-dependent transcription (32Park J. Lee J.H. La M. Jang M.J. Chae G.W. Kim S.B. Tak H. Jung Y. Byun B. Ahn J.K. Joe C.O. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 368: 388-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which Daxx inhibits the C/EBPβ-induced phosphorylation of p300 is subject of ongoing studies. One obvious possibility is that Daxx interferes with the C/EBPβ-p300 interaction and thereby displaces p300 from C/EBPβ. Alternatively, Daxx could interfere with the protein kinase that phosphorylates p300.An important implication of our work concerns the role of the C/EBPβ-Daxx interaction in APL. In APL, the t(15;17) chromosomal translocation leads to the expression of the oncogenic PML-RARα fusion protein (41de Thé H. Chomienne C. Lanotte M. Degos L. Dejean A.

Data from Hes1 deficient mice suggested that Hes1, like Notch1, is necessary for the progression of early T cell progenitors. Constitutive activation of Notch is known to cause T cell leukemia or lymphoma but whether Hes1 has any oncogenic activity is not known.We generated mice carrying a Hes1 transgene under control of the proximal promote of the lck gene. Hes1 expression led to a reduction in numbers of total thymocytes, concomitant with the increased percentage and number of immature CD8+ (ISP) T cells and sustained CD25 expression in CD4+CD8+ double positive (DP) thymocytes. Hes1 transgenic mice develop thymic lymphomas at about 20 weeks of age with a low penetrance. However, expression of Hes1 significantly shortens the latency of T cell lymphoma developed in Id1 transgenic mice, where the function of bHLH E proteins is inhibited. Interestingly, Hes1 increased expression of a subset of Notch target genes in pre-malignant ISP and DP thymocytes, which include Notch1, Notch3 and c-myc, thus suggesting a possible mechanism for lymphomagenesis.We have demonstrated for the first time that Hes1 potentiates T cell lymphomagenesis, by up-regulating a subset of Notch target genes and by causing an accumulation of ISP thymocytes particularly vulnerable to oncogenic transformation."

https://openalex.org/W2110044559,"In the early stages of development of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, chemotaxis toward cAMP plays a pivotal role in organizing discrete cells into a multicellular structure. In this process, a series of signaling molecules, such as G-protein-coupled cell surface receptors for cAMP, phosphatidylinositol metabolites, and cyclic nucleotides, function as the signal transducers for controlling dynamics of cytoskeleton. Differentiation-inducing factor-1 and -2 (DIF-1 and DIF-2) were originally identified as the factors (chlorinated alkylphenones) that induce Dictyostelium stalk cell differentiation, but it remained unknown whether the DIFs had any other physiologic functions.To further elucidate the functions of DIFs, in the present study we investigated their effects on chemotaxis under various conditions. Quite interestingly, in shallow cAMP gradients, DIF-1 suppressed chemotaxis whereas DIF-2 promoted it greatly. Analyses with various mutants revealed that DIF-1 may inhibit chemotaxis, at least in part, via GbpB (a phosphodiesterase) and a decrease in the intracellular cGMP concentration ([cGMP](i)). DIF-2, by contrast, may enhance chemotaxis, at least in part, via RegA (another phosphodiesterase) and an increase in [cGMP](i). Using null mutants for DimA and DimB, the transcription factors that are required for DIF-dependent prestalk differentiation, we also showed that the mechanisms for the modulation of chemotaxis by DIFs differ from those for the induction of cell differentiation by DIFs, at least in part.Our findings indicate that DIF-1 and DIF-2 function as negative and positive modulators for Dictyostelium chemotaxis, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first report in any organism of physiologic modulators (small molecules) for chemotaxis having differentiation-inducing activity."

It was previously reported that CLIP-170 is a phosphoprotein and that overall phosphorylation of CLIP-170 affects its microtubule binding ability (14Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17597-17605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, metabolic labeling experiments indicated that CLIP-170 is phosphorylated at multiple sites (15Choi J.H. Bertram P.G. Drenan R. Carvalho J. Zhou H.H. Zheng X.F. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, individual phosphorylation sites have not been identified. Moreover, the FKBP12-rapamycin-associated protein (FRAP) is the only kinase identified to date for CLIP-170 (15Choi J.H. Bertram P.G. Drenan R. Carvalho J. Zhou H.H. Zheng X.F. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Therefore, to fully understand the regulation of CLIP-170, it is important to identify individual phosphorylation sites and the responsible kinases. In this communication, we describe a novel kinase/substrate partnership between Cdc2 and CLIP-170. We provide evidence that Cdc2 phosphorylates CLIP-170 at Thr287, and the Cdc2-mediated phosphorylation of CLIP-170 is essential for its localization at microtubule plus ends in the G2 phase and the G2/M transition. HEK293T and U2OS cells were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units ml−1 penicillin, and 100 units ml−1 streptomycin at 37 °C in 8% CO2. For synchronization, U2OS cells were treated with 2.5 mm thymidine for 16 h, released for 8 h, then blocked with 2.5 mm thymidine for another 16 h to arrest at the G1/S boundary. After release into fresh medium for different times, cells were stained with various antibodies. DNA transfection was performed using MegaTran 1.0 (ORIGENE) with the protocol as described by the manufacturer. U2OS cells transfected with rat GFP-CLIP-170 (WT, T287A, or T287D) by MegaTran 1.0 were selected with 400 μg ml−1 of G418 for 6 weeks. Positive transfectants were confirmed by anti-GFP immunoblotting. Various domains of CLIP-170 were subcloned into pGEX-KG vector and expressed in Escherichia coli. Expression was induced by 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C for 3 h after the cell density had reached 0.6 at 600 nm. Recombinant GST fusion proteins were affinity-purified by incubation with glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma, catalogue number G4510), followed by extensive washes with STE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl) and elution with glutathione elution buffer (40 mm glutathione, 50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 200 mm NaCl, pH 8.0). Purified recombinant CLIP-170 protein fragments prepared from bacteria were incubated with commercial Cdc2/cyclin B in TBMD buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate) supplemented with 125 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci mmol−1, PerkinElmer Life Sciences).

HEK293T cells were transfected with GFP-CLIP-170 (WT or T287A) and treated with 100 ng ml−1 of nocodazole for 10 h to arrest cells in mitosis. Cells were labeled for 3 h with [32P]orthophosphate (ICN) at 1 mCi ml−1 in phosphate-free DMEM in the absence or presence of roscovitine, followed by incubation with 1.0 μm okadaic acid for 30 min. Total cell lysates were prepared and incubated with an anti-GFP antibody overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with protein A PLUS-agarose beads for an additional 3 h. The beads were washed at least five times with TBSN buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, and at least 10 times with TBSN buffer containing 150 mm NaCl. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, followed by autoradiography. For phosphopeptide mapping, phosphoproteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibodies, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Labeled GFP-CLIP-170 was detected by autoradiography, excised, exhaustively digested with trypsin, and separated by 40% alkaline acrylamide gel (16Keshvara L.M. Isaacson C.C. Yankee T.M. Sarac R.

Total cell lysates were incubated with Cdc2 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalogue number sc-53) overnight at 4 °C, followed by 2 h of incubation with protein A PLUS-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunocomplexes were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore). Immunoblot analyses were performed using antibodies for GFP (Invitrogen, catalogue number A11122), CLIP-170 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalogue number sc-25613), Cdc2, Plk1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalogue number sc-17783), cyclin B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalogue number sc-245), and Mek1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalogue number sc-6250), followed by anti-mouse or anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies (Amersham Biosciences) and detection with ECL reagent (Amersham Biosciences). Cells grown on coverslips were incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PEM buffer (20 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA) for 1 min, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in PEM for 5 min, and subsequently permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PEM buffer for 30 min. After blocking in phosphate-buffered saline with 3% bovine serum albumin for 1 h, cells were incubated with various antibodies (phospho-H3, α-tubulin, and γ-tubulin) at room temperature overnight, followed by incubation with a secondary antibody for 2 h at room temperature. Finally, DNA was stained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Although CLIP-170 was reported to be a phosphoprotein almost 20 years ago (14Rickard J.E. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17597-17605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), kinases responsible for the multiple phosphorylations are largely unknown (15Choi J.H. Bertram P.G. Drenan R. Carvalho J. Zhou H.H. Zheng X.F. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that knockdown of CLIP-170 with RNAi results in an almost complete block of cells in mitosis (13Wieland G. Orthaus S. Ohndorf S. Diekmann S. Hemmerich P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6620-6630Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Considering the essential role of Cdc2 in mitosis, we explored the possibility of a potential direct connection between CLIP-170 and Cdc2. To test whether CLIP-170 is a binding partner of Cdc2, a co-immunoprecipitation experiment was performed. Briefly, HEK293T cells were transfected with GFP-CLIP-170, treated with or without nocodazole, harvested, and immunoprecipitated with a Cdc2 antibody, followed by anti-GFP Western blot. Nocodazole is a drug to block cells at mitosis through microtubule depolymerization (17Peterson J.R. Mitchison T.J. Chem Biol. 2002; 9: 1275-1285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, overexpressed GFP-CLIP-170 protein was specifically pulled down by the Cdc2 antibody, indicating an association between CLIP-170 and Cdc2. The increased level of GFP-CLIP-170 that co-immunoprecipitates with Cdc2 in nocodazole-treated cells suggests a substrate/kinase partnership in mitosis. Furthermore, we also examined the interaction between endogenous CLIP-170 and Cdc2. As shown in Fig. 1B, CLIP-170 co-immunoprecipitates with a Cdc2 antibody, confirming an interaction between these two proteins. Considering the in vivo association between CLIP-170 and Cdc2, we asked whether Cdc2 directly phosphorylates CLIP-170. Commercial Cdc2/cyclin B was incubated with four purified GST-CLIP-170 fragments (amino acids 1–365, 355–734, 716–1101, and 1089–1392) in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction mixtures were resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. As shown in Fig. 2A, only the fragment containing amino acids 1–365 was phosphorylated by Cdc2, indicating that this N-terminal region of CLIP-170 is a Cdc2 substrate in vitro. To map the potential phosphorylation site(s) for Cdc2, we generated a series of serine to alanine mutants in CLIP-170 spanning amino acids 1–365. Compared with the phosphorylation levels of wild-type CLIP-170 and other mutants, the phosphorylation level of the T287A mutant was completely abolished, indicating that Thr287 is the major phosphorylation site for Cdc2 in vitro (Fig. 2B). The consensus phosphorylation motif for Cdc2 is (S/T)PX(R/K), in which the Pro at +1 position is absolutely required, and a basic residue at the +3 position is preferred but not essential (18Songyang Z. Blechner S. Hoagland N. Hoekstra M.F. Piwnica-Worms H. Cantley L.C. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 973-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The sequence context of Thr287 (287TPAK) matches this consensus phosphorylation motif (Fig. 2F). To confirm specificity of the kinase assay, we repeated the experiment described above in the absence or presence of roscovitine, a Cdc2 inhibitor (19De Azevedo W.F. Leclerc S. Meijer L. Havlicek L. Strnad M. Kim S.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 518-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Addition of roscovitine strongly inhibited the phosphorylation of CLIP-170-WT by Cdc2, supporting the specificity of the kinase assay (Fig. 2C). To examine whether Cdc2-dependent phosphorylation of CLIP-170 at Thr287 also occurs in vivo, metabolic labeling experiments were performed. In brief, HEK293T cells were transfected with GFP-CLIP-170-WT (wild type) or T287A. At 16-h post-transfection, roscovitine was added to inhibit Cdc2 activity. After an additional overnight incubation, cells were treated with nocodazole for 10 h, and metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate for 3.5 h. To inhibit possible dephosphorylation of CLIP-170, cells were further treated with okadaic acid for 0.5 h before harvesting. GFP-CLIP-170 protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP antibody, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to autoradiography. As indicated in Fig. 2D, the total phosphorylation level of GFP-CLIP-170 was not significantly reduced in cells expressing the T287A mutant, suggesting that Thr287 is only one of multiple sites phosphorylated in vivo. Moreover, treatment of cells with roscovitine did not dramatically reduce the phosphorylation level of CLIP-170-WT, indicating that Cdc2 is only one of multiple enzymes responsible for phosphorylation of CLIP-170 in vivo (Fig. 2D). These results are consistent with previous analyses that suggest that CLIP-170 is phosphorylated at multiple sites by multiple kinases (15Choi J.H. Bertram P.G. Drenan R. Carvalho J. Zhou H.H. Zheng X.F. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To further analyze phosphorylation of CLIP-170-T287 in vivo, samples prepared as in Fig. 2D were excised from the filter, digested with trypsin, and resolved on a 40% alkaline gel. We observed disappearance of one specific band (indicated by the arrow, Fig. 2E) in the lanes loaded with the T287A mutant and with roscovitine-treated CLIP-170-WT, supporting the notion that Cdc2 does phosphorylate CLIP-170-Thr287 in vivo. Quantification of the relative 32P intensity of the peptide containing Thr287 further confirmed the conclusion. Finally, in a separate study using mass spectrometry to analyze CLIP-170 phosphorylation, Thr287 is also identified as one of multiple sites phosphorylated in vivo. A detailed description of additional phosphorylation sites and additional kinases using this approach will be reported later. 4H. Li, X. Yang, Y. Wang, and X. Liu, unpublished data. In sum, the data show that Cdc2 phosphorylates CLIP-170 at Thr287 in vivo. To explore the role of Cdc2-mediated phosphorylation of CLIP-170, U2OS cell lines were generated that stably express rat GFP-CLIP-170 (WT, T287A, or T287D). As shown in Fig. 3A, the expression levels of these GFP-CLIP-170 constructs are similar in the stably transfected cells. Because CLIP-170 is a plus end microtubule-binding protein and the Cdc2 phosphorylation site is located at the microtubule binding domain (Fig. 2F), we asked whether the Cdc2-mediated phosphorylation of CLIP-170 regulates its microtubule binding ability. To address this question, U2OS cells stably expressing GFP-CLIP-170 (WT, T287A, or T287D) were analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy using α-tubulin antibody. As indicated in Fig. 3, B and C, both GFP-CLIP-170-WT and the GFP-CLIP-T287D mutants localized to plus ends of microtubules. In striking contrast, 75% of cells expressing GFP-CLIP-170-T287A showed a diffuse pattern of GFP signal, rather than localization at microtubule plus ends (see the enlarged images of the far-right column in Fig. 3B). Because Cdc2 is critical for the later stages of the cell cycle, U2OS cells stably expressing GFP-CLIP-170-T287A were synchronized by the double thymidine block protocol in the G1/S boundary, released for different times, and stained with α-tubulin antibody (Fig. 3D). In late G1/early S phase (0 h of release) when Cdc2 activity is low, most GFP-CLIP-170-T287A was observed at plus ends of microtubules. In late S phase (6 h of release), G2 phase (8 h of release), and mitosis (10 h of release), most GFP-CLIP-T287A had lost its ability to localize at the plus ends of microtubules; instead, it localized throughout the cytoplasm. In the next G1 phase (12 h of release), a significant portion of GFP-CLIP-T287A relocalized back to plus ends of microtubules. All together, we conclude that Cdc2-associated phosphorylation of CLIP-170 is essential for its correct localization at the plus ends of microtubules at the later stages of the cell cycle. Neither the α-tubulin nor the γ-tubulin staining pattern was affected in cells expressing different forms of GFP-CLIP-170 (WT, T287A, or T287D) (Fig. 3, B and E). To further analyze the functional significance of Cdc2-associated phosphorylation of CLIP-170, we compared cell cycle progression of U2OS cells, stably expressing different forms of GFP-CLIP-170 (WT, T287A, or T287D) in the absence of endogenous protein. Vector-based RNAi was used to deplete CLIP-170. Specifically, U2OS cells were co-transfected with pBS/U6-CLIP-170 and pBabe-puro, a vector expressing a puromycin resistance gene. After puromycin selection, cells were harvested and analyzed by anti-CLIP-170 Western blots. As indicated in Fig. 4A, this approach can efficiently deplete CLIP-170. Next, U2OS cells stably expressing rat GFP-CLIP-170 (WT, T287A, or T287D) were depleted of endogenous CLIP-170 using vector-based RNAi as in Fig. 4A, treated with or without nocodazole, and harvested for Western blots using various antibodies as indicated (Fig. 4, B–D). Because of the high specificity of RNAi, rat GFP-CLIP-170 was not targeted by RNAi designed to deplete the human sequence. Compared with cells expressing CLIP-170-WT and -T287D, cells expressing CLIP-170-T287A showed significantly higher levels of Plk1 and cyclin B (compare lanes 1, 2, and 3 and Fig. 4B). Because the protein levels of both Plk1 and cyclin B are significantly elevated in the G2/M phase, these results suggest that overexpression of CLIP-170-T287A arrests cells in the G2 or M phase. Upon depletion of endogenous CLIP-170, the levels of Plk1 from the three cell lines became similar. However, the difference between the levels of cyclin B from the three cell lines remained significant (compare lanes 4, 5, and 6, Fig. 4B). Addition of nocodazole to the three cell lines in the absence of endogenous protein resulted in identical levels of cyclin B. Interestingly, in this case the Plk1 level in cells expressing CLIP-T287A was clearly lower than that of cells expressing CLIP-170-WT and -T287D (compare lanes 7, 8, and 9 in Fig. 4, B–D). We interpret these results to indicate that CLIP-170-T287A expression causes a G2 block under this condition, as the level of Plk1 continues to increase in mitosis, whereas the level of cyclin B remains the same after G2 (20Golsteyn R.M. Schultz S.J. Bartek J. Ziemiecki A. Ried T. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1509-1517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Next, control or CLIP-170-depleted U2OS cells were synchronized with the double thymidine block to arrest in the G1/S boundary, released for different times, and stained with phospho-H3 antibodies. We found that both control and CLIP-170-depleted cells started to enter mitosis at 10 h after release, reached a peak at 12 h after release, and exited mitosis at 16 h after release. Although CLIP-170 depletion did not affect mitotic entry and exit, CLIP-170-depleted cells had significantly higher levels of phospho-H3-positive staining at 10, 12, and 14 h postrelease, indicating that CLIP-170 is involved in mitotic progression (data not shown). This is consistent with the published CLIP-170 loss-of-function phenotypic analysis (12Tanenbaum M.E. Galjart N. van Vugt M.A. Medema R.H. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 45-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To assess the contribution of Cdc2 phosphorylation of CLIP-170 during mitosis, similar experiments were performed using U2OS cells stably expressing GFP-CLIP-170 (WT, T287A, or T287D) in the absence of endogenous CLIP-170 (Fig. 4E). Compared with cells expressing CLIP-170-WT and -T287D, a significant lower percentage of cells expressing CLIP-170-T287A could go through mitosis, indicating that Cdc2 phosphorylation of CLIP-170 is essential for its function during cell cycle progression. To further confirm the phenotypes we described above, U2OS cells stably expressing GFP-CLIP-170 (WT, T287A, or T287D) were grown on coverslips and stained with cyclin B or phosphohistone H3 antibodies. In agreement with the Western results in Fig. 4B, cells expressing CLIP-170-T287A show significantly higher levels of cyclin B (50%) than those of cells expressing CLIP-170-WT (19%) or -T287D (23%). In striking contrast, the levels of phosphohistone H3, a mitotic marker, of these cells are the same (Fig. 4F), arguing that cells expressing CLIP-170-T287A tend to arrest in G2, but not M phase. Next, a series of FACS analysis was performed with U2OS cells stably expressing GFP-CLIP-170 (WT, T287A, or T287D). In randomly growing cultures, cells expressing CLIP-170-T287A show a dramatic increase in population with 4N DNA content even before the gating. After gating the GFP-positive cells, we detected only the population with 4N DNA content in cells expressing CLIP-T287A. This enrichment was not observed in cells expressing GFP-CLIP-170-WT and -T287D (Fig. 4G). We also tried to follow the cell cycle progression after synchronization of these cells. Toward that end, cells were blocked at the G2/M boundary with roscovitine and released for different times. Both cells expressing GFP-CLIP-170-WT and -T287D were able to go through mitosis, as indicated by a gradual decrease of 4N DNA population and an increase of 2N DNA population at the same time. As expected, no obvious cell cycle progression was detected in cells expressing GFP-CLIP-170-T287A even after 8 h of release from the G2 block (Fig. 4H). During the G2/M transition, centrosome separation is one essential step to ensure subsequent bipolar spindle formation in metaphase. We thus monitored centrosome separation in synchronized U2OS cells by staining with anti-γ-tubulin, a centrosome marker (Fig. 4I). As expected, U2OS cells stably expressing both rat GFP-CLIP-170-WT and GFP-CLIP-170-T287D showed gradual increases of centrosome separation as cells went through the G2/M transition. In striking contrast, centrosome separation was strongly inhibited in cells stably expressing CLIP-170-T287A (Fig. 4J). As CLIP-170 is a centrosomal protein (Fig. 3E), we continued to analyze its loss-of-function phenotypes using γ-tubulin staining. Strikingly, depletion of CLIP-170 in U2OS cells leads to formation of supernumerary γ-tubulin dots (compare Fig. 5, A versus B). Similar experiments were performed in U2OS cells stably expressing GFP-CLIP-170 (WT, T287A, or T287D) to assess the contribution of Cdk-mediated phosphorylation of CLIP-170 in the process. While both cells expressing GFP-CLIP-170-WT and -T287D still have normal centrosomal numbers in the absence of endogenous protein, cells expressing GFLP-CLIP-170-T287A failed to reverse the phenotype (Fig. 5, C and D). It has been reported that CLIP-170 is phosphorylated at multiple sites, most likely by multiple kinases (15Choi J.H. Bertram P.G. Drenan R. Carvalho J. Zhou H.H. Zheng X.F. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 988-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To date, specific phosphorylation sites have not been determined, and information about the upstream kinases is very limited. In this communication, we provide evidence that Cdc2/cyclin B is responsible for phosphorylation of Thr287 of CLIP-170, and that Cdc2-mediated phosphorylation of CLIP-170 is required for its plus end microtubule localization. More significantly, we show that the Cdc2-mediated phosphorylation of CLIP-170 is essential in the G2/M transition. Specifically, cells expressing the Cdc2 unphosphorylatable mutant of CLIP-170 accumulate Plk1 and cyclin B and fail to separate the centrosomes in late G2. As the critical role of CLIP-170 in mitosis was established using both dominant negative and RNAi approaches, we have shown that CLIP-170 function during the G2/M transition is also regulated by Cdc2/cyclin B, the master kinase that controls cell division. The mechanism by which the Cdc2-mediated phosphorylation of CLIP-170-Thr287 regulates the G2/M transition is currently unknown. Different possibilities are currently under investigation. Centrosomes duplicate once and only once per cell cycle, although how this process is controlled is still elusive. To our knowledge, nucleophosmin is the only protein that has been identified as yet to prevent centrosome duplication (21Okuda M. Horn H.F. Tarapore P. Tokuyama Y. Smulian A.G. Chan P.K. Knudsen E.S. Hofmann I.A. Snyder J.D. Bove K.E. Fukasawa K. Cell. 2000; 103: 127-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 22Wang W. Budhu A. Forgues M. Wang X.W. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). It was shown that nucleophosmin dissociates from the centrosomes upon Cdk2/cyclin E-mediated phosphorylation in late G1, thus allowing centrosome duplication in the S phase (21Okuda M. Horn H.F. Tarapore P. Tokuyama Y. Smulian A.G. Chan P.K. Knudsen E.S. Hofmann I.A. Snyder J.D. Bove K.E. Fukasawa K. Cell. 2000; 103: 127-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Based on its subcellular locations during different phases of the cell cycle and its inhibitory role of centrosome duplication, it was further proposed that nucleophosmin acts as a licensing factor to ensure that the centrosome duplicates once and only once per cell cycle (21Okuda M. Horn H.F. Tarapore P. Tokuyama Y. Smulian A.G. Chan P.K. Knudsen E.S. Hofmann I.A. Snyder J.D. Bove K.E. Fukasawa K.

Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 823-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). However, nucleophosmin does not bind to centrosomes during S and G2 phases, only re-associating with centrosomes in mitosis (21Okuda M. Horn H.F. Tarapore P. Tokuyama Y. Smulian A.G. Chan P.K. Knudsen E.S. Hofmann I.A. Snyder J.D. Bove K.E. Fukasawa K. Cell. 2000; 103: 127-140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), suggesting that additional factors rather than nucleophosmin must act to inhibit centrosome reduplication during the G2 phase. CLIP-170 clearly localizes at the centrosomes throughout the entire cell cycle, including S and G2 phases (Fig. 3E), and its depletion leads to centrosome reduplication, indicating that CLP-170 might be a factor that prevents centrosome reduplication after the S phase. Consistent with the cell cycle regulation of the levels of cyclin B, the essential role of CLIP-170 to inhibit centrosome reduplication during G2 is Cdc2/cyclin B phosphorylation-dependent. Our data provide a novel mechanism of the centrosome cycle. We thank Dr. O. Andrisani and E. Erikson for critical reading of this manuscript. We thank Dr. G. Borisy for various CLIP-170 expression constructs."

The contribution of heme-iron acquisition to staphylococcal pneumonia has not yet been elucidated. In addition, the use of computed tomography (CT) for the evaluation of staphylococcal pneumonia and its correlation to pathologic examination of infected lung tissue has not been performed to date. We have applied CT-based imaging to a murine model of staphylococcal pneumonia to determine the virulence contribution of heme-iron acquisition through the Hts and Isd systems.Mice were intranasally inoculated with approximately 1.0 x 10(8) colony forming units (CFU) of S. aureus. Lungs from mice infected with wild type S. aureus or strains deficient in isdB and isdH (DeltaisdBH) or htsA and isdE (DeltahtsADeltaisdE) were harvested at 24 hours. Histology, radiographic appearance by computed tomography (CT), percent mortality and bacterial burden were evaluated. Infection with S. aureus DeltaisdBH and DeltahtsADeltaisdE did not result in a statistically significant difference in mortality or bacterial burden as compared to controls. CT imaging of infected mice also did not reveal an appreciable difference between the various strains when compared to wild type, but did correlate with pathologic findings of pneumonia. However, a systemic model of infection using the DeltahtsADeltaisdE strain revealed a statistically significant decrease in bacterial burden in the lung, heart and kidneys.The development of staphylococcal pneumonia in this murine model is not dependent on hemoglobin binding or heme-iron uptake into S. aureus. However, this model does reveal that heme-iron acquisition contributes to the pathogenesis of systemic staphylococcal infections. In addition, CT imaging of murine lungs is an attractive adjunct to histologic analysis for the confirmation and staging of pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W2092859584,"Interferon-α (IFNα) has shown promise in the treatment of various cancers. However, the development of IFN resistance is a significant drawback. Using conditions that mimic in vivo selection of IFN-resistant cells, the RST2 IFN-resistant cell line was isolated from the highly IFN-sensitive Daudi human Burkitt lymphoma cell line. The RST2 cell line was resistant to the antiviral, antiproliferative, and gene-induction actions of IFNα. Although STAT2 mRNA was present, STAT2 protein expression was deficient in RST2 cells. A variant STAT2 mRNA, which resulted from alternative splicing within the intron between exon 19 and 20, was expressed in several human cell lines but at relatively high levels in RST2 cells.

Although IFN triggers the death of some tumor cells by inducing proapoptotic proteins (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, PKR, etc.), IFN also promotes cell survival through a nuclear factor κB-dependent pathway (2Du Z.

IFN binds to its cell surface receptor resulting in the activation of JAK1 and TYK2 nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinases, which phosphorylate STAT proteins (7Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 in a complex with IRF9 bind to a conserved IFN stimulus-response element (ISRE) present in the promoters of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) inducing their expression. Mutant cell lines with defined signaling defects have made significant contributions in elucidating the IFN-activated JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway (7Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R.

Such IFN-resistant mutants were isolated after multiple rounds of chemical mutagenesis and selection of IFN-resistant mutants. However, this procedure does not mimic in vivo what happens to patients who are subjected to long term IFN treatment. Moreover, these IFN-resistant cells have undergone multiple mutational events, because complementation of a single defect rescues aspects of IFN signaling but not sensitivity to all of the biological actions of IFN (8Stark G.R. Harvey Lect. 1997; 93: 1-16PubMed Google Scholar, 9Brierley M.M. Fish E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 13029-13036Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). As an alternative approach, our laboratory has resorted to long term IFN treatment of cells to isolate naturally arising IFN-resistant mutants, which more closely resemble what occurs in vivo (10Pfeffer L.M. Donner D.B. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 2654-2657PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yang C.H. Murti A. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 5568-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Using this strategy, we previously identified a STAT3-defective IFN-resistant cell line (11Yang C.H. Murti A. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 5568-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In this study, a mutant cell line (RST2) that was highly resistant to the antiviral, antiproliferative, and gene-inducing actions of IFN was isolated from the highly IFN-sensitive Daudi cell line by growth in the continuous presence of IFN. Sequencing of STAT2 mRNA identified an alternative splice site between exon 19 and 20 that is expressed in RST2 cells, causing translation termination at the beginning of the Src homology 2 domain of STAT2. Expression of STAT2 in RST2 cells rescued sensitivity to the antiviral, antiproliferative, and gene-inducing actions of IFN. Furthermore, although RST2 cells are intrinsically resistant to the induction of apoptosis by a variety of chemotherapeutic agents, reconstitution of STAT2 restored sensitivity to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Recombinant human IFNα (IFNCon1) was generously provided by Dr. L. Blatt of InterMune (Brisbane, CA). Antibodies against the following proteins were used: STAT1, phospho-STAT1, STAT2, IRF9, and actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA); STAT3 (BD Biosciences); phospho-STAT2 and phospho-STAT3 (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA); and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). Daudi and RST2 cells were maintained at ∼5 × 105 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% defined bovine calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT). Camptothecin, doxorubicin, and staurosporine were from Sigma. For antiproliferative assays, cells (1 × 105 cells/ml) were treated with the indicated IFNα concentrations. Cell numbers were determined after 72 h of IFNα treatment on a Beckman-Coulter counter (12Eisenkraft B.L. Nanus D.M. Albino A.P. Pfeffer L.M. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 5881-5887PubMed Google Scholar). For antiviral activity, cells (1 × 105 cells/ml) were treated with the indicated IFNα concentrations for 24 h, followed by infection with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) for 1.5 h at 0.1 plaque-forming unit per cell. The virus yield in the medium was assayed by plaque formation at 24 h post-infection on Vero cells (3Yang C.H. Murti A. Pfeffer S.R. Basu L. Kim J.G. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Nuclei were washed with lysis buffer, and nuclear proteins were extracted with buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 25% glycerol with 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1.75 μg/ml benzamidine (13Yang C.H.

Protein was determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Total cell lysates (25 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore), and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies, followed by anti-mouse or -rabbit IgG coupled with horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Blots were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Nuclear extracts (10 μg) were incubated with 32P-labeled probes for the highly conserved ISRE in the promoter region of ISG15 (5′-GATCCATGCCTCGGGAAAGGGAAACCGAAACTGAAGCC-3′) or the high affinity c-sis inducible element (SIE) in the c-fos gene (5′-AGCTTCATTTCCCGTAATCCCTAAAGCT-3′), respectively, and subjected to electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) (11Yang C.H. Murti A. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 5568-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). To define the presence of specific STAT proteins in DNA-protein complexes, nuclear extracts were preincubated with a 1:50 dilution of anti-STAT antibodies at 25 °C for 20 min before EMSA. Bands were quantified by phosphorimage autoradiography. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and qPCR was performed on an iCyclerIQ (Bio-Rad) using iScript One-Step RT-PCR kit with SYBR Green (Bio-Rad). Reaction parameters were as follows: cDNA synthesis at 50 °C for 20 min, transcriptase inactivation at 95 °C for 5 min, PCR cycling at 95 °C for 10 s, and 60 °C for 30 s for 40 cycles. The following primers were used for qPCR: β-actin, 5′-AGAAGGAGATCACTGCCCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CACATCTGCTGGAAGGTGGA-3′ (reverse); GBP1, 5′-AGGAGTTCCTTCAAAGATGTGGA-3′ (forward) and 5′-TTCTGAACAAAGAGACGATAGCC-3′ (reverse); ISG15, 5′-TCCTGGTGAGGAATAACAAGGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTCAGCCAGAACAGGTCGTC-3′ (reverse); IFIT1, 5′-TCAGGTCAAGGATAGTCTGGAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-AGGTTGTGTATTCCCACACTGTA-3′ (reverse); STAT2, 5′-TCGGGCAGAACTGTAGGACT-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACCTCCTTCGTGTACGGTTG-3′ (reverse); STAT2 splicing variant, 5′-TCGGGCAGAACTGTAGGACT-3′ (forward) and 5′-ACCTTCCGAGGGTTTGAAGT-3′ (reverse); and total STAT2, 5′-CACCAGCTTTACTCGCACAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGGAAGAATAGCATGGTAGCCT-3′ (reverse). Total cellular RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) (14Wei L. Sandbulte M.R. Thomas P.G. Webby R.J. Homayouni R. Pfeffer L.M. J. Biol.

(Memphis, TN) for labeling and hybridization to human U133A version 2.0 GeneChips (Affymetrix Inc.). Expression values were determined using Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 software. All data analysis was performed using GeneSpring software 7.0 (Silicon Genetics, Inc.), and expression values for each gene were normalized as described previously (14Wei L. Sandbulte M.R.

The average fold-change in gene expression from three independent sets of GeneChip data for Daudi and RST2 cells was subjected to nonparametric t testing. Cells were treated with the indicated drug for 24 h. The induction of apoptosis was monitored by immunoblotting whole cell extracts for the caspase-dependent PARP cleavage or DNA fragmentation using the cell death detection ELISAPLUS (Roche Applied Science). To determine the role of STAT2, RST2 cells were transfected with empty vector pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) or green fluorescent protein-tagged STAT2 expression vector pEGFP-STAT2 (generously provided by Dr. Nancy Reich, University of Stony Brook, NY) (15Banninger G. Reich N.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 39199-39206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Transfection was accomplished by electroporation (capacitance 300 microfarads, 250 V) with 50 μg of salmon sperm DNA and 20 μg of plasmid DNA for each sample (4Yang C.H. Murti A. Pfeffer S.R. Kim J.G. Donner D.B. Pfeffer L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13756-13761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Three rounds of cell sorting resulted in the isolation of stable green fluorescent protein-positive cells. To understand the mechanisms that underlie the clinical resistance of patients after prolonged IFN exposure, we employed the highly IFN-sensitive Daudi human lymphoblastoid cell line. As shown in Fig. 1, Daudi cell proliferation was inhibited by ∼70% at an IFN concentration of 100 IU/ml, and cell death was detected in IFN-treated cells by day 2 as determined by the appearance of the p85 product of cleaved PARP. To isolate IFN-resistant cells, Daudi cells were maintained in the continuous presence of IFN at a concentration of 100 IU/ml. During the first 2 weeks of IFN treatment, massive cell death was observed, and only a small fraction of IFN-treated Daudi cells survived. The surviving cells, maintained in the continuous presence of IFN (100 IU/ml) for another month, grew at the same rate as untreated parental Daudi cells. The cell culture was then treated sequentially for 1 month with IFN at 1000 IU/ml and an additional month at 5000 IU/ml, during which IFN-induced inhibition of cell proliferation and apoptosis were not detected. After culture in the absence of IFN for several months, the proliferation of these cells (denoted as RST2 cells) was unaffected by IFN at 1000 IU/ml, and no IFN-induced apoptosis was observed (Fig. 1, A and B). IFN inhibits the replication of a wide range of DNA and RNA viruses. However, cells resistant to the antiproliferative activity of IFN can retain sensitivity to the antiviral activity of IFN (16Pfeffer L.M. Wang C. Constantinescu S.N. Croze E. Blatt L.M. Albino A.P. Nanus D.M. J. Urol. 1996; 156: 1867-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We next examined the sensitivity of RST2 cells to the antiviral activity of IFN against VSV infection. As shown in Fig. 1C, treatment with as little as 10 IU/ml of IFN reduced VSV production by more than 10-fold, and 1000 IU/ml reduced viral titer by >3 logs in Daudi cells. In contrast, treatment with 1000 IU/ml IFN did not reduce the VSV production in RST2 cells. Taken together these results demonstrate that RST2 cells are resistant to IFN-induced antiproliferative, antiviral, and apoptotic activities. RST2 cells are highly IFN-resistant, suggesting that they may have a defective IFN-signaling pathway. IFN signals through the activation of the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) complex, composed of STAT1, STAT2, and IRF9 (17Schindler C. Fu X.Y. Improta T. Aebersold R. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 7836-7839Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar), as well as STAT1 and STAT3 dimers that bind to ISG promoter elements (11Yang C.H. Murti A. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 5568-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2A using the SIE probe, IFN induces distinctive formation of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT1/STAT3 dimer complexes in both Daudi and RST2 cells. The relative level of STAT1 dimers in Daudi cells is higher than in RST2 cells. In contrast, as shown in Fig. 2A using the ISRE probe there was barely detectable activation of ISGF3 in RST2 cells, although there was clear activation in Daudi cells, suggesting a defective ISGF3-signaling pathway in RST2 cells. To further characterize this defect, cell lysates were immunoblotted with STAT and IRF9 antibodies. Fig. 2B shows that STAT3 and IRF9 were expressed at similar levels in Daudi and RST2 cells. Although RST2 cells express somewhat lower STAT1 levels, STAT2 was undetectable in these cells as compared with Daudi cells. Moreover, IFN induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 in Daudi and RST2 cells at levels reflecting their protein expression. These results localize the defect in RST2 cells at the level of the STAT2 protein. Because STAT2 plays a critical role in regulating ISG expression, we examined the effect of IFN on several ISGs that are highly induced in Daudi cells (18Yang C.H. Wei L. Pfeffer S.R. Du Z. Murti A. Valentine W.J. Zheng Y. Pfeffer L.M. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 986-992Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, whereas IFIT1, ISG15, and GBP1 were well induced by IFN treatment in Daudi cells (50–120-fold), these ISGs were poorly induced in RST2 cells (<3-fold). Although STAT2 protein was not detected in RST2 cells, we found similar expression levels of STAT2 mRNA in Daudi and RST2 cells by microarray and qPCR analysis. We therefore examined whether there were mutations in the STAT2 gene that could affect STAT2 protein expression. The human STAT2 gene is located on human chromosome 12 and contains 23 exons. To test for STAT2 mutations, we carried out PCR using probes corresponding to nucleotides 1–770, 770–1448, and 1448–2556 of the STAT2 open reading frame. An extra ∼200-bp insertion was found in STAT2 mRNA isolated from RST2 cells between bases 1448 and 2556. Sequencing the open reading frame of STAT2 cDNA identified a 247-bp sequence inserted in the mRNA (Fig. 3A), resulting in the early termination of STAT2 protein at the beginning of the Src homology 2 domain. A search of the inserted 247-bp sequence shows that this sequence originates from the intron between exon 19 and 20. As depicted in Fig. 3A, the mutant STAT2 mRNA apparently results from the use of an alternative splice site. Sequencing the genomic DNA from RST2 cells between exon 19 and 20 showed that the DNA sequence was identical in DNA isolated from Daudi and RST2 cells, indicating that a genomic mutation was not responsible for the presence of the splice variant in RST2 cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, qPCR analysis of wild-type and mutant STAT2 transcripts showed that >90% of the STAT2 transcripts in Daudi cells were wild-type STAT2, although in RST2 cells ∼90% were mutant STAT2 transcripts. This splice variant of STAT2 was present in other human cells (Daudi, MCF7, and HUH7) as determined by qPCR, albeit at lower levels relative to RST2 cells (data not shown). Both wild-type STAT2 mRNA and the splicing variant were up-regulated by IFN treatment of Daudi cells (Fig. 3C). To gain insight into other alterations in RST2 cells, we performed genome-wide expression analysis using Affymetrix DNA microarray technology. RNA was isolated from Daudi or RST2 cells and processed for hybridization to human U133A version 2.0 GeneChips, which probe 14,500 human genes. We compared the gene expression levels between Daudi cells and RST2 cells. Statistical analysis using Wilcoxin 2 sample rank test revealed 168 annotated genes whose expression levels were significantly (p < 0.05) different in the RST2 cells as compared with Daudi cells. The expression of 78 genes was down-regulated from 2- to 39-fold, and the expression of 24 genes was up-regulated from 2- to 6-fold (supplemental Table). Consistent with our qPCR data, the level of the STAT2 transcript was similar in RST2 and Daudi cells. To further characterize the biological role of STAT2, we analyzed the differentially regulated genes in RST2 cells by using the Gene Ontology (GO) classification. As shown in Table 1, a number of genes involved in apoptosis was down-regulated in RST2 cells as compared with Daudi cells, such as PKR (EIF2AK2), STAT1, PML, MCL1, as well as genes that play a role in sterol/steroid metabolism (p < 0.004) and fatty acid β-oxidation (p < 0.01). Steroid metabolism is implicated in multidrug resistance especially against various chemotherapeutic agents (19Zelcer N. Reid G. Wielinga P. Kuil A. van der Heijden I. Schuetz J.D. Borst P. Biochem.

Daudi and RST2 cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of camptothecin (CPT), and apoptosis was monitored by immunoblotting for the 89-kDa caspase-3 cleavage product of PARP or DNA fragmentation by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. As shown in Fig. 4, A and B, both PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation were detected in Daudi cells treated with 0.01 μm CPT, reaching a maximal PARP cleavage at 1 μm CPT. In contrast, almost no PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation were detected in RST2 cells at 0.1 μm CPT, and the levels of PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation at 1 μm CPT in RST2 cells were similar to that induced at 0.01 μm CPT in Daudi cells. These results suggest that RST2 cells were ∼100-fold less sensitive to CPT-induced apoptosis than Daudi cells. Moreover, as shown in Fig. 4C, RST2 cells are more resistant to the induction of apoptosis by staurosporine and doxorubicin as compared with Daudi cells. Our results identified STAT2 as a major defect in the RST2 cells; however, other defects in the IFN-signaling pathway could be responsible for the altered phenotype of RST2 cells. We then determined whether STAT2 expression in RST2 cells restored sensitivity to the biological activities of IFN. Fig. 5A shows that stable STAT2 expression in RST2 cells (RST2+STAT2) rescues IFN-induced STAT2 tyrosine phosphorylation, as detected by blotting with anti-phospho-STAT2 antibody. IFN treatment does not induce the rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT2 in RST2 cells transfected with empty vector (RST2+EV) but does in the parental Daudi cell line as expected. Thus, transfection with wild-type STAT2 restored “normal” STAT2 expression in RST2 cells and IFN-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT2. To determine whether STAT2 rescues sensitivity to the antiproliferative action of IFN, RST2 cells stably expressing wild-type STAT2 or empty vector were treated with IFN, and antiproliferative assays were performed. RST2 cells transfected with empty vector were highly resistant to the antiproliferative action of IFN with little inhibition observed at IFN concentrations as high as 1,000 IU/ml (Fig. 5B). In contrast, IFN treatment inhibited the proliferation of STAT2-expressing RST2 cells at concentrations as low as 10 IU/ml, and near maximal inhibition of proliferation was observed at 100 IU/ml. Moreover, STAT2 expression in RST2 cells also rescued IFN-induced antiviral activity. Although IFN treatment did not reduce the viral titer in RST2 cells transfected with empty vector, IFN treatment of RST2 cells expressing wild-type STAT2 resulted in a 3 log reduction in viral titer at 100 IU/ml (Fig. 5B). In addition, STAT2 expression in RST2 cells also rescued ISG expression. RST+EV and RST2+STAT2 cells were treated with IFN; total RNA was extracted, and the expression of IFIT1, ISG15, and GBP1 was determined. As shown in Fig. 5C, IFN induced the expression of these ISGs in RTS2 cells expressing STAT2 but not in RST2 cells transfected with the empty vector. Moreover, the IFN-induced expression levels in RST2+STAT2 cells are comparable with what is observed in parental Daudi cells (Fig. 2C). Thus, STAT2 expression in RST2 cells rescues sensitivity to antiproliferative, antiviral, apoptotic, and gene-inducing actions of IFN, demonstrating that the defective IFN response in RST2 cells resides in STAT2. Finally, we examined the effect of STAT2 expression on the sensitivity of the RST2 cells to various chemotherapy-induced cell death. RST2 cells transfected with empty vector and RST2 cells expressing wild-type STAT2 were treated with camptothecin, staurosporine, or doxorubicin, and apoptosis was monitored by immunoblotting for the 89-kDa caspase-3 cleavage product of PARP. As shown in Fig. 6, expression of STAT2 in RST2 cells sensitized the cells to camptothecin-induced cell death. PARP cleavage was detected in RST2 cells expressing STAT2 at 0.01 μm CPT, reaching a maximal PARP cleavage at 1 μm CPT. In contrast, PARP cleavage was first detected in RST2 cells transfected with empty vector at 0.1 μm CPT, and the level of PARP cleavage at 10 μm CPT in RST2+EV cells was similar to that induced at 0.1 μm CPT in RST2+STAT2 cells. Thus, STAT2-expressing RST2 cells were ∼100-fold more sensitive to CPT-induced apoptosis when compared with EV-expressing cells. In addition, as shown in Fig. 6 RST2 cells expressing STAT2 are more sensitive to the induction of apoptosis by staurosporine and doxorubicin as compared with RST2 cells transfected with empty vector. IFNα is used to treat various cancers as well as viral infections. However, the development of resistance to IFN has been a significant drawback. In this study, we report the isolation of a STAT2-deficient IFN-resistant cell line by maintaining cells in the continuous presence of IFN. Our results suggest that the STAT2 protein could function not only as the classically defined IFN-activated transcription factor that regulates proliferation and antiviral functions of the cells but may also play a role in other cell functions such as apoptosis. The finding of an intrinsic drug resistance of these IFN-resistant cells adds a new dimension to our knowledge of the role of STAT2 in signaling pathways. STAT2 was previously shown to be required for the IFN-induced STAT1 activation (21Leung S. Qureshi S.A. Kerr I.M. Darnell Jr., J.E. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1312-1317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In STAT2 null U6A cells, STAT1 is not activated by IFN but can be activated upon STAT2 reconstitution. In contrast we found that although STAT2 protein was not detected in RST2 cells, STAT1 was activated by IFN. The discrepancy may due to cell type-specific differences in the cells studied. U6A cells were derived from a fibrosarcoma, while our RST2 cells were isolated from a B-cell lymphoma. Similarly, STAT1 is activated in macrophages but not in fibroblasts isolated from STAT2 knock-out mice (22Park C. Li S. Cha E. Schindler C. Immunity. 2000; 13: 795-804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the IFN-signaling pathway is cell type-dependent. Different splicing products have been reported for various STAT proteins (23Yan R. Qureshi S. Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 24Zhong Z. Wen Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1994; 91: 4806-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). These splicing isoforms are usually truncated at the C terminus of the proteins and function differently from their normal isoforms. For example, the STAT1β isoform functions as a dominant negative for IFNα signaling (25Caldenhoven E. van Dijk T.B. Solari R. Armstrong J. Raaijmakers J.A. Lammers J.W. Koenderman L. de Groot R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13221-13227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). However, we were unable to detect the presence of a STAT2 isoform. Previous studies identified a STAT2 splicing variant mRNA that uses an alternative splicing site present in the intron between exon 20 and 21 (26Sugiyama T. Nishio Y. Kishimoto T. Akira S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 191-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In contrast, we have identified an mRNA transcript resulting from alternative splicing in the intron between exon 19 and 20, which can be detected at low levels in B-lymphoblastoid, hepatoma, and breast cancer cells. In addition, we were unable to detect the STAT2 protein in RST2 cells using a number of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies directed against various epitopes located throughout the STAT2 protein, suggesting that the STAT2 protein in RST2 cells is rapidly degraded or not translated. Most importantly, we found that IFN-resistant RST2 cells were also resistant to the apoptotic action of various chemotherapeutic drugs. However, RST2 cells were as sensitive as parental Daudi cells to apoptosis induced by etoposide (data not shown), which differs from the other chemotherapeutic agents studied in that etoposide functions by binding topoisomerase II and forming a ternary complex with DNA (27Kingma P.S. Burden D.A. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3457-3461Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 28Binaschi M. Bigioni M. Cipollone A. Rossi C. Goso C. Maggi C.A. Capranico G. Animati F. Curr. Med. Chem. Anticancer Agents. 2001; 1: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Cancer-specific mutations in the components of the IFN-signaling pathway are believed to contribute to the failure of IFN as an effective antitumor agent (16Pfeffer L.M. Wang C. Constantinescu S.N. Croze E. Blatt L.M. Albino A.P. Nanus D.M. J. Urol. 1996; 156: 1867-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 29Xu B. Grandér D. Sangfelt O. Einhorn S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 28779-28785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). However, the relationship between IFN resistance and resistance to chemotherapeutic agents has not been well characterized. A previous study found that sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents is coupled to IFN sensitivity, such that selection for resistance to one leads to resistance to the other (31Khodarev N.N. Minn A.J. Efimova E.V. Darga T.E. Labay E. Beckett M. Mauceri H.J. Roizman B. Weichselbaum R.R. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 9214-9220Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). These results also have significant implications for IFN treatment of cancer patients, especially those who have developed IFN resistance during the course of treatment. The choice of alternative therapeutic agents in such patients should be carefully considered, because we found that RST2 cells are resistant to various chemotherapeutic agents. Although STAT2 expression restored the sensitivity of RST2 cells to chemotherapeutic drugs, the underlying mechanism is presently unknown. However, as shown in Table 1 and supplemental Table several genes involved in the apoptotic pathway are down-regulated in RST2 cells. For example, the promyelocytic leukemia (PML) gene is the most down-regulated gene in RST2 cells. The PML gene encodes a tumor suppressor, and PML appears to be involved in multiple apoptotic pathways (32Wang Z.G. Ruggero D. Ronchetti S. Zhong S. Gaboli M. Rivi R. Pandolfi P.P. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Therefore, low PML expression in RST2 cells would be consistent with their resistance to apoptosis induced by various chemotherapeutic agents. Moreover, STAT1, which is down-regulated in RST2 cells, has been shown to mediate apoptosis in fibrosarcoma cells through regulation of the caspase pathway (33Kumar A. Commane M. Flickinger T.W. Horvath C.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1997; 278: 1630-1632Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). However, the role of STAT2 in this pathway is unclear because STAT2 is necessary for STAT1 activation in fibrosarcoma cells. In addition, two important genes in the NF-κB pathway are affected in RST2 cells, i.e. Rel (c-Rel) is up-regulated and NFκB1A (IκBα) is down-regulated. The NF-κB pathway antagonizes the apoptotic actions of various chemotherapeutic agents (34Rayet B. Gélinas C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6938-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar, 35Wang C.Y. Cusack Jr., J.C. Liu R. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 412-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 36Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin Jr., A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar). Both c-Rel up-regulation and IκBα down-regulation would be expected to promote NF-κB activity in RST2 cells, and hence make these cells relatively resistant to chemotherapeutic agents, which is what we observed. In conclusion, our results expand upon the role that STAT2 plays in the classical IFN-signaling pathway, which leads to inhibition of cell proliferation and viral replication through ISG expression. We show that STAT2 also regulates a novel signaling pathway to regulate apoptosis by IFN and various chemotherapeutic agents. It is enticing to consider the possibility that this role of STAT2 is through regulation of gene expression in its well known role as a transcription factor. Consistent with this possibility, we observe the down-regulation of basal expression of a number of genes in RST2 cells that are known ISGs (PKR, STAT1, PML, and MCL1), as well as genes that play a role in sterol/steroid metabolism and fatty acid β-oxidation. STAT2 is the only member of the STAT family that is exclusively used by a single cytokine, IFNα/β. It is of particular interest that we previously showed that STAT2 was “activated” as evidenced by its nuclear translocation by epidermal growth factor in intestinal epithelial cells (37Johnson L.R. McCormack S.A. Yang C.H. Pfeffer S.R. Pfeffer L.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C419-C425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, no STAT2 target genes were examined in that study. STAT proteins are usually considered to function upon their tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent dimerization to regulate transcription. However, recent studies showed that STATs may play a broader role in gene regulation, as non-tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT proteins also appear to regulate gene transcription (38Yang J. Chatterjee-Kishore M. Staugaitis S.M. Nguyen H. Schlessinger K. Levy D.E. Stark G.R. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 939-947PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, STAT3 may act as an adapter for the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (39Pfeffer L.M. Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer S.R. Murti A. Shi W. Yang C.H. Science. 1997; 276: 1418-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar) and nuclear factor κB (11Yang C.H. Murti A. Pfeffer L.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 5568-5572Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Moreover, a recent study indicates that STAT3 is also present in the mitochondria and functions in cellular respiration (40Wegrzyn J. Potla R. Chwae Y.J. Sepuri N.B. Zhang Q. Koeck T. Derecka M.

Thus, in future studies it will be highly interesting to determine whether STAT2 functions in regulating the apoptotic response of cells via its role as a transcription factor and regulating the expression of apoptotic or anti-apoptotic genes, or is localized to another cellular compartment such as to the mitochondria and regulates apoptosis through other pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2072522851,"In the social amoeba Dictyostelium, a terminal step in development is regulated by environmental O(2). Prolyl 4-hydroxylase-1 (P4H1) was previously implicated in mediating the O(2) signal, and P4H1-null cells require elevated O(2) to culminate. The E3-ubiquitin ligase adaptor Skp1 is a P4H1 substrate, and here we investigate the function of PgtA, a dual function beta3-galactosyltransferase/alpha2-fucosyltransferase that contributes the 2nd and 3rd sugars of the pentasaccharide cap formed on Skp1 hydroxyproline. Although pgtA-null cells, whose Skp1 contains only a single sugar (N-acetylglucosamine or GlcNAc), show wild-type O(2) dependence of culmination, cells lacking AgtA, an alpha3-galactosyltransferase required to extend the trisaccharide, require elevated O(2) as for P4H1-null cells. Skp1 is the only detectable protein modified by purified PgtA added to pgtA-null extracts. The basis for specificity of PgtA was investigated using native Skp1 acceptor glycoforms and a novel synthetic peptide containing GlcNAcalpha1,4-hydroxy(trans)proline. Cysteine-alkylation of Skp1 strongly inhibited modification by the PgtA galactosyltransferase but not the fucosyltransferase. Furthermore, native and synthetic Skp1 glycopeptides were poorly galactosylated, not processively fucosylated, and negligibly inhibitory, whereas the fucosyltransferase was active toward small substrates. In addition, the galactosyltransferase exhibited an atypical concentration dependence on UDP-galactose. The results provide the first evidence that Skp1 is the functional target of P4H1 in O(2) regulation, indicate a gatekeeper function for the beta3-galactosyltransferase in the PgtA dual reaction, and identify an unexpected P4H1-dependent yet antagonistic function for PgtA that is reversed by AgtA."
https://openalex.org/W2142003789,"Protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) mediates thrombin signaling in human endothelial cells. As a G-protein-coupled receptor, PAR-1 transmits thrombin signal through activation of the heterotrimeric G proteins, Gi, Gq, and G12/13. In this study, we demonstrated that zyxin, a LIM-domain-containing protein, is involved in thrombin-mediated actin cytoskeleton remodeling and serum response element (SRE)-dependent gene transcription. We determined that zyxin binds to the C-terminal domain of PAR-1, providing a possible mechanism of involvement of zyxin as a signal transducer in PAR-1 signaling. Data showing that disruption of PAR-1-zyxin interaction inhibited thrombin-induced stress fiber formation and SRE activation supports this hypothesis. Similarly, depletion of zyxin using siRNA inhibited thrombin-induced actin stress fiber formation and SRE-dependent gene transcription. In addition, depletion of zyxin resulted in delay of endothelial barrier restoration after thrombin treatment. Notably, down-regulation of zyxin did not affect thrombin-induced activation of RhoA or Gi, Gq, and G12/13 heterotrimeric G proteins, implicating a novel signaling pathway regulated by PAR-1 that is not mediated by G-proteins. The observation that zyxin targets VASP, a partner of zyxin in regulation of actin assembly and dynamics, to focal adhesions and along stress fibers on thrombin stimulation suggests that zyxin may participate in thrombin-induced cytoskeletal remodeling through recruitment of VASP. In summary, this study establishes a crucial role of zyxin in thrombin signaling in endothelial cells and provides evidence for a novel PAR-1 signaling pathway mediated by zyxin."
https://openalex.org/W2037714882,"Background Calpain-10 was the first gene to be identified influencing the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) by positioning cloning. Studies in β-cell lines and rodent islets suggest that calpain-10 may act as a regulator of insulin secretion. However, its role in human pancreatic islets remains unclear. The aim of this study was to examine if calpain-10 expression is altered in islets from patients with T2D and if the transcript level correlates with insulin release. We also tested if polymorphisms in the CAPN10 gene are associated with gene expression and insulin secretion in vitro. Methodology/Principal Findings Calpain-10 mRNA expression was analysed in human pancreatic islets from 34 non-diabetic and 10 T2D multi-organ donors. CAPN10 SNP-43 and SNP-44 were genotyped and related to gene expression and insulin release in response to glucose, arginine and glibenclamide. The mRNA level of calpain-10 was elevated by 64% in pancreatic islets from patients with T2D compared with non-diabetic donors (P = 0.01). Moreover, the calpain-10 expression correlated positively with arginine-stimulated insulin release in islets from non-diabetic donors (r = 0.45, P = 0.015). However, this correlation was lost in islets from patients with T2D (r = 0.09; P = 0.8). The G/G variant of SNP-43 was associated with reduced insulin release in response to glucose (P≤0.04) in non-diabetic donors. Conclusions While calpain-10 expression correlates with insulin release in non-diabetic human islets, this correlation is lost in T2D suggesting that a stimulatory effect of calpain-10 could be lost in patients with T2D."
https://openalex.org/W2120504528,"The Beijing Declaration on food safety and security was signed by over fifty countries with the aim of developing comprehensive programs for monitoring food safety and security on behalf of their citizens. Currently, comprehensive systems for food safety and security are absent in many countries, and the systems that are in place have been developed on different principles allowing poor opportunities for integration.We have developed a user-friendly analytical tool based on network approaches for instant customized analysis of food alert patterns in the European dataset from the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed. Data taken from alert logs between January 2003-August 2008 were processed using network analysis to i) capture complexity, ii) analyze trends, and iii) predict possible effects of interventions by identifying patterns of reporting activities between countries. The detector and transgressor relationships are readily identifiable between countries which are ranked using i) Google's PageRank algorithm and ii) the HITS algorithm of Kleinberg. The program identifies Iran, China and Turkey as the transgressors with the largest number of alerts. However, when characterized by impact, counting the transgressor index and the number of countries involved, China predominates as a transgressor country.This study reports the first development of a network analysis approach to inform countries on their transgressor and detector profiles as a user-friendly aid for the adoption of the Beijing Declaration. The ability to instantly access the country-specific components of the several thousand annual reports will enable each country to identify the major transgressors and detectors within its trading network. Moreover, the tool can be used to monitor trading countries for improved detector/transgressor ratios."
https://openalex.org/W1972530339,"Background In skeletal muscle each muscle cell, commonly called myofiber, is actually a large syncytium containing numerous nuclei. Experiments in fixed myofibers show that mRNAs remain localized around the nuclei in which they are produced. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study we generated transgenic flies that allowed us to investigate the movement of mRNAs in body wall myofibers of living Drosophila embryos. We determined the dynamic properties of GFP-tagged mRNAs using in vivo confocal imaging and photobleaching techniques and found that the GFP-tagged mRNAs are not free to move throughout myofibers. The restricted movement indicated that body wall myofibers consist of three domains. The exchange of mRNAs between the domains is relatively slow, but the GFP-tagged mRNAs move rapidly within these domains. One domain is located at the centre of the cell and is surrounded by nuclei while the other two domains are located at either end of the fiber. To move between these domains mRNAs have to travel past centrally located nuclei. Conclusions/Significance These data suggest that the domains made visible in our experiments result from prolonged interactions with as yet undefined structures close to the nuclei that prevent GFP-tagged mRNAs from rapidly moving between the domains. This could be of significant importance for the treatment of myopathies using regenerative cell-based therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1974557957,"Interdomain interactions between intracellular N and C termini have been described for various K+ channels, including the voltage-gated Kv2.1, and suggested to affect channel gating. However, no channel regulatory protein directly affecting N/C interactions has been demonstrated. Most Kv2.1 channel interactions with regulatory factors occur at its C terminus. The vesicular SNARE that is also present at a high concentration in the neuronal plasma membrane, VAMP2, is the only protein documented to affect Kv2.1 gating by binding to its N terminus. As its binding target has been mapped near a site implicated in Kv2.1 N/C interactions, we hypothesized that VAMP2 binding to the N terminus requires concomitant conformational changes in the C terminus, which wraps around the N terminus from the outside, to give VAMP2 access. Here, we first determined that the Kv2.1 N terminus, although crucial, is not sufficient to convey functional interaction with VAMP2, and that, concomitant to its binding to the “docking loop” at the Kv2.1 N terminus, VAMP2 binds to the proximal part of the Kv2.1 C terminus, C1a. Next, using computational biology approaches (ab initio modeling, docking, and molecular dynamics simulations) supported by molecular biology, biochemical, electrophysiological, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analyses, we mapped the interaction sites on both VAMP2 and Kv2.1 and found that this interaction is accompanied by rearrangements in the relative orientation of Kv2.1 cytoplasmic domains.

These latter loops are responsible for the subfamily-specific association with β-subunits (Kvβ and KChIP, respectively). Further, the interaction between the N and C cytoplasmic termini (N/C interaction) of Kv2.1 has been shown to be dynamic and voltage-dependent and to involve structural rearrangements between these domains, which could affect both activation and inactivation gating of the channel (4Ju M.

For the Kv2.1 N terminus, on the other hand, there are only two examples of protein-protein interactions: a transient association with KChAP (21Wible B.A. Yang Q. Kuryshev Y.A. Accili E.A. Brown A.M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11745-11751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), which does not affect channel function; and an interaction with the vesicular SNARE partner VAMP2 (synaptobrevin 2), which is also present at a high concentration in the neuronal plasma membrane and enhances channel inactivation (8Lvov A. Chikvashvili D. Michaelevski I. Lotan I. Pflugers Arch. 2008; 456: 1121-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Specifically, VAMP2 has been shown to associate with the extension of a docking loop in the lateral part of the T1 domain (8Lvov A. Chikvashvili D. Michaelevski I. Lotan I. Pflugers Arch. 2008; 456: 1121-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) near the site of interaction with the C terminus (4Ju M. Stevens L. Leadbitter E. Wray D. J. Biol.

Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that interaction with VAMP2 will affect the N/C interaction, similar to proton-mediated Kir2.3 (1Qu Z. Yang Z. Cui N. Zhu G. Liu C. Xu H. Chanchevalap S. Shen W.

To date, no protein molecule that directly affects N/C interactions in a K+ channel has been demonstrated. Because VAMP2 was the first protein documented to affect Kv2.1 channel gating by binding to a specific N-terminal site, which is probably masked by the C terminus, we have put forward the idea that its interaction with the Kv2.1 N terminus requires conformational changes in the C terminus that will enable its access to the N terminus. Here we endeavored to gain a mechanistic and structural understanding of the Kv2.1-VAMP2 interaction. Based on our evidence, we propose that VAMP2 modulates Kv2.1 gating by interfering with the Kv2.1 cytoplasmic N/C interaction. The antibodies used were: polyclonal antibodies against Kv2.1 C terminus or Kv2.1 N terminus (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel) and polyclonal antibody against VAMP2 (Abcam, Cambridge, UK). Kv2.1 wild type (WT) (kindly provided by Prof. R. Joho, The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX) complementary DNA (cDNA) was cloned in pBluescript. Kv2.1N/Kv1.5 (kindly provided by Prof. David Fedida, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada) cDNAs were cloned in pCDNA3. Kv2.1ΔC1a (ΔC421–523) was created using two-step overlapping PCR with wild-type rat Kv2.1 cDNA as the template and subcloned into the EcoRI/XbaI sites of the pGEMHJ vector. ΔNK2.1 and ΔNVAMP2 were created by amplification of a desired parts of the wild-type rat Kv2.1 or VAMP2 cDNAs (amino acids 28–853 or 29–120, correspondingly) with oligonucleotide primers designed for introducing the EcoRI and NotI restriction sites. Subsequently, both were subcloned into EcoRI/NotI sites of a pGEMHJ vector. Preparation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) was as described (23Levin G. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Peretz T. Thornhill W.B.

His6-tagged VAMP2 (kindly provided by Dr. Michael Veit, Free University, Berlin, Germany) was cloned to pQE30 and purified as described (24Kammer B. Schmidt M.F. Veit M. Mol. Cell.

Typically, for the electrophysiological assays, oocytes were injected with the following concentrations of mRNA (further detailed in the legends to Figs. 2C and 6C): 0.025–0.1 ng/oocyte Kv2.1 and its deletion/truncation mutants; 2.5 ng/oocyte Kv2.1N/Kv1.5 and 1.5 ng/oocyte VAMP2. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings were performed as described (25Levin G. Keren T. Peretz T. Chikvashvili D. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14611-14618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To avoid possible errors introduced by series resistance, only current amplitudes up to 6 μA were recorded. Net current was obtained by subtracting the scaled leak current elicited by a voltage step from −80 to −90 mV. Oocytes with a leak current of more than 3 nA/1 mV were discarded. Experimental protocols and data analyses are described in the legends to Figs. 2C, 3A, and 4C and Fig. 6, D and E. In general, the voltage dependence of the channel inactivation was studied using 5- or 30-s depolarizing prepulses in the case of WT Kv2.1 or ΔNKv2.1 and Kv2.1ΔC1a (of which inactivation is attenuated), respectively.

Note the lighter blue shade in comparison with image c. c, confocal image of an oocyte expressing eCFP alone, excited with 405 nm. d and e, confocal images of an oocyte expressing eYFP alone, excited with 514 nm (d) and 405 nm (e). Note the very weak emission of eYFP caused by 405 nm excitation. C, normalized spectra of C-Kv-Y excited with 405 and 514 nm. Briefly, the standard eCFP emission spectrum (green line) was subtracted from the emission spectrum of a FRET oocyte expressing C-Kv-Y taken with 405 nm excitation laser (red line). The difference in the intensities in the eYFP region (after dichroic mirror) was then normalized to the total eYFP emission spectrum (taken with 514 nm excitation laser (yellow line)) and is denoted as ratio A. The ratio A component caused by the direct excitation of eYFP (denoted as ratio A0) was measured directly from control oocytes expressing eYFP only (see image B, e). The difference between ratio A and ratio A0 [ratio A − ratio A0], directly proportional to FRET efficiency, was determined as described (51Zhang Y. Garzon-Rodriguez W. Manning M.C. Anchordoquy T.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1614: 182-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). D and E, VAMP2 reduces ratio A concomitantly, causing a hyperpolarizing shift in the inactivation curve. In one representative experiment of seven, oocytes injected with C-Kv-Y mRNA alone or together with 1.5 ng/oocyte VAMP2 mRNA (17 oocytes/group) were tested (with 5-s prepulses) for the effect of VAMP2 on the voltage dependence of C-Kv-Y inactivation (D) prior to analysis of their FRET signals (E). VAMP2 reduced the ratio A of C-Kv-Y from 0.34 ± 0.02 to 0.28 ± 0.01 (E).

Oocytes were subjected to immunoprecipitation as described (25Levin G. Keren T. Peretz T. Chikvashvili D. Thornhill W.B. Lotan I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14611-14618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, immunoprecipitates from 1% CHAPS oocytes homogenates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12% polyacrylamide). Digitized scans were derived by PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare), and relative intensities were quantified using ImageQuant. The fusion proteins were synthesized and reacted with VAMP2 as described (26Fili O. Michaelevski I. Bledi Y. Chikvashvili D. Singer-Lahat D. Boshwitz H. Linial M. Lotan I. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 1964-1974Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, purified GST fusion proteins (100–200 pmol) immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads were usually incubated with either 200 pmol of His6-tagged VAMP2 or 35S-labeled VAMP2 (VAMP2 translated on the template of in vitro synthesized RNAs using a translation rabbit reticulocyte lysate kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instruction manual) in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing a protein detergent (0.1% Triton X-100). After washing, the GST fusion proteins were eluted with 20 mm reduced glutathione in 40 μl of elution buffer (120 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8) and separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. The immunoblot was visualized using the ECL detection system (Pierce); proteins were stained by Ponceau. Two types of structure prediction methods were exploited: homology-based prediction was used to create a model of Kv2.1 tetramerization (T1) domains, and ab initio was used for modeling of various protein domains including Kv2.1 proximal N-terminal (N-tail, residues 1–30) and C1a domain (residues 411–510), and the N terminus of VAMP2 (NTD, residues 1–30) of which templates are not available. Homology-based prediction of Kv2.1 T1 domain was performed via the SWISS-MODEL server. The first 186 amino acids of Kv2.1 were submitted to the template identification tool for best alignment template identification using the following parameters: InterPro domain scan performed against HMMPfam, HMMTigr, ProfileScan, SuperFamily, BlastProDom; PSI-BLAST profile generation: iteration = 10, E-value = 0.0001, protein substitution matrix = BLOSUM62 11(G) 1(E), SEG filter for low complexity subsequence = activated; PSI-BLAST profile search: search data base = ExPDB90, E-value = 0.00001, protein substitution matrix = BLOSUM62 11(G) 1(E), alignment = 50; HHSearch software was used to detect distantly related templates (supplemental Fig. 1A). A crystal structure-based model of the Kv3.1 T1 domain (PDB ID: 3KVT, chain A) was used as a template, since: score = 96.3 bits (238), E-value = 7e-21, identities = 46/107 (42%), positives = 65/107 (60%), gaps = 11/107 (10%). Swiss-PDB viewer was used to generate the project submitted to the SWISS-MODEL server. Energetic profile analysis of the predicted structure of Kv2.1 T1 was tested based on standard Anolea, GROMOS, and Verify3D parameters of the SWISS-MODEL outcome, which revealed significant stability with a very limited number of structures having unfavorable energy scores (supplemental Fig. 1B). The calculated energy for the derived model was −5982.097 kJ/mol. Ab initio prediction was based on the Protinfo ab initio structure prediction server. Prediction output sums up to the five most favorable structures. The obtained models were checked for Ramachandran plot. The best structures were selected and assigned with the CHARMM22 force field (Gasteiger method was used for charge assignment) with subsequent Newton-Raphson method (Truncated Newton algorithm 30,000 iterations in Vega ZZ software) (27Pedretti A.

Five structures predicted by the server were aligned structurally using SWISS-PDB viewer 3.7 SP5; Magic Fit was applied to the structure backbone atoms. Significant similarities revealed during the alignment were considered as adequateness of ab initio prediction (as shown for N-tail on supplemental Fig. 1C). Ramachandran plot-based analysis was used for choosing the most favorable structure. Files containing atomic coordinates tetramerization domain from Kv3.1 voltage-gated potassium channel (PDB ID: 3KVT) and complexin-SNARE complex (PDB ID: 1KIL) were obtained from the Protein Data Bank server. Three-dimensional models, prepared by cutting off unnecessary information from PDB files, were used for structure alignment and protein-protein interaction analysis (docking simulation), as described below. A Windows version of Hex docking software was used for simulation of protein-protein interaction (30Ritchie D.W. Kemp G.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1999; 20: 383-395Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The receptor-ligand choice was dependent on the simulation purpose. For Kv2.1T1-Kv2.1N1–30 docking model (model set 1): receptor = T1, ligand = N1–30; for Kv2.1 N terminus-VAMP2NTD (model set 2): receptor = Kv2.1 N terminus (approved model of Kv2.1T1-Kv2.1N1–30 interaction), ligand = VAMP2 NTD; for Kv2.1 N terminus-VAMP2 NTD wi"

Here we describe heterogeneity in the composition of the glycans of the two N-linked sites of vIL-6. The Asn-89 site of vIL-6, found to be required for optimal cytokine function, is composed of complex glycans. The Asn-78 site is composed of high mannose glycans, which are dispensable for cytokine function. N-Linked glycosylation at the Asn-89 site was required for intracellular production of functional vIL-6, but endoglycosidase-mediated removal of N-linked glycans from secreted vIL-6 did not impair protein function. With the use of a conformation-specific antibody and tryptic digestion assays, we showed that glycosylation at the Asn-89 site of vIL-6 affected protein conformation. Human IL-6, but not vIL-6, requires IL-6Rα for binding to gp130. We tested the hypothesis that the Asn-89 complex glycan of vIL-6 alone was sufficient to confer binding to gp130 independently of IL-6Rα. Two mutants of huIL-6, made to contain additional complex N-linked glycans in the region that interacts with IL-6Rα, did not confer binding to gp130 independently of IL-6Rα.

Large DNA viruses, such as KSHV, are notorious for their ability to evade the host immune response (2Alcami A. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2003; 3: 36-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). They have evolved to acquire and modify host-encoded cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors. Thus far, KSHV is the only virus known to encode a homologue of interleukin-6 (IL-6). The K2 open reading frame of KSHV encodes viral IL-6 (vIL-6), a structural and functional homologue of human IL-6 (huIL-6) (3Nicholas J. Ruvolo V.R. Burns W.H. Sandford G. Wan X. Ciufo D.

HuIL-6 exhibits a wide spectrum of biological activities, including mediation of fever and acute phase inflammatory response to trauma and pathogens, stimulation of osteoclast formation, and promotion of neuronal regeneration (5Papanicolaou D.A. Wilder R.L. Manolagas S.C. Chrousos G.P. Ann. Intern. Med. 1998; 128: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (985) Google Scholar). huIL-6 is an important growth factor for multiple myeloma and plasmacytoma cells. vIL-6 mimics a number of huIL-6 activities such as stimulating B cell growth and activating the Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK) 1 and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1/3 pathway (6Burger R. Neipel F. Fleckenstein B. Savino R. Ciliberto G. Kalden J.R. Gramatzki M. Blood. 1998; 91: 1858-1863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Molden J. Chang Y. You Y. Moore P.S. Goldsmith M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19625-19631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). vIL-6 is expressed in KSHV-infected B cells and endothelial cells. It induces proliferation, angiogenesis, and hematopoiesis in IL-6-dependent cell lineages (4Moore P.S. Boshoff C. Weiss R.A. Chang Y. Science. 1996; 274: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar, 8Hoischen S.H. Vollmer P. März P. Ozbek S. Götze K.S. Peschel C. Jostock T. Geib T. Müllberg J. Mechtersheimer S. Fischer M. Grötzinger J. Galle P.R. Rose-John S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 3604-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). vIL-6 can serve as an autocrine growth factor for primary effusion lymphoma cell lines and other IL-6-dependent tumor cell lines (9Jones K.D. Aoki Y. Chang Y. Moore P.S. Yarchoan R. Tosato G. Blood. 1999; 94: 2871-2879Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, vIL-6 is less potent than huIL-6, requiring 2 to 3 log higher levels more compared with its human counterpart (1Dela Cruz C.S. Lee Y. Viswanathan S.R. El-Guindy A.S. Gerlach J. Nikiforow S. Shedd D. Gradoville L. Miller G. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 503-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 6Burger R. Neipel F. Fleckenstein B. Savino R. Ciliberto G. Kalden J.R. Gramatzki M. Blood. 1998; 91: 1858-1863Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). KSHV-infected cells secrete vIL-6, but they also retain a proportion of the cytokine intracellularly, which can activate the STAT1/3 pathway (10Meads M.B. Medveczky P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51793-51803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Both autocrine and paracrine functions of vIL-6 may be involved in tumorigenesis. vIL-6 accelerates hematopoiesis in mice and induces expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, a factor implicated in primary effusion lymphoma, and Kaposi sarcoma pathogenesis (11Nicholas J. Front Biosci. 2007; 12: 265-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Cellular huIL-6 itself is also induced in KSHV-infected cells by the viral immediate-early lytic protein Rta (ORF50) (12Deng H. Chu J.T. Rettig M.B. Martinez-Maza O. Sun R. Blood. 2002; 100: 1919-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), a transcriptional activator that regulates lytic gene expression, and by vGPCR (ORF74) (13Pati S. Cavrois M. Guo H.G. Foulke Jr., J.S. Kim J. Feldman R.A. Reitz M. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 8660-8673Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), a viral G-protein-coupled receptor with significant homology to the high affinity IL-8 receptor, which functions as a CXC type chemokine receptor. Despite similarities in their function and domain, huIL-6 and vIL-6 differ in their mode of receptor usage (14Somers W. Stahl M. Seehra J.S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 989-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 15Chow D. He X. Snow A.L. Rose-John S. Garcia K.C. Science. 2001; 291: 2150-2155Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). vIL-6 and huIL-6 share with other cytokines, such as ciliary neurotrophic factor, leukemia inhibitory factor, oncostatin M, cardiotropin-1, and IL-11, the use of a gp130 receptor for signal transduction (16Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). Cytokine binding to gp130 causes JAKs to phosphorylate STATs, which dimerize and translocate to the nucleus, where they bind specific enhancer sequences to stimulate or repress transcription of target genes. Although both cellular IL-6 and vIL-6 bind gp130, the common signal transducing receptor subunit for the IL-6-type family of cytokines, huIL-6 requires a nonsignaling coreceptor, IL-6Rα (gp80), for assembly of a 2:2:2 hexameric signaling complex (16Taga T. Kishimoto T. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 797-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (1291) Google Scholar). In contrast, vIL-6 directly binds gp130 and does not require IL-6Rα for signal transduction (8Hoischen S.H. Vollmer P. März P. Ozbek S. Götze K.S. Peschel C. Jostock T. Geib T. Müllberg J.

Matthews J.M. Ward L.D. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 929-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Interaction of huIL-6 with IL-6Rα is mediated by a specific motif on huIL-6 known as site I. Site I on vIL-6 is not occupied when the viral cytokine binds gp130. The interaction of IL-6Rα with site I of huIL-6 is thought to alter the conformation of the cellular cytokine to enable it to bind to gp130 (18Boulanger M.J. Chow D.C Brevnova E. Martick M. Sandford G. Nicholas J. Garcia K.C. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 641-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). vIL-6 may act as an anti-apoptotic factor to promote survival of KSHV-infected cells and enhance the proliferation of KSHV-infected cells or potential host target cells (19Osborne J. Moore P.S. Chang Y. Hum. Immunol. 1999; 60: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 20Hideshima T. Chauhan D. Teoh G. Raje N. Treon S.P. Tai Y.T. Shima Y. Anderson K.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 1180-1189PubMed Google Scholar, 21Chatterjee M. Osborne J. Bestetti G. Chang Y. Moore P.S. Science. 2002; 298: 1432-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Interferon-α produced in response to KSHV infection in lymphoma cells specifically down-regulates IL-6Rα, making it difficult for huIL-6 to interact with its gp130 receptor (21Chatterjee M. Osborne J. Bestetti G. Chang Y. Moore P.S. Science. 2002; 298: 1432-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Because vIL-6 binds directly to the signaling gp130 receptor without first binding to IL-6Rα, vIL-6 may exert its proliferative effects on B cells without being affected by interferon-α. Moreover, vIL-6 independence from IL-6Rα allows it to interact with a broader group of target cells. We previously showed that the differences in biological activity and receptor usage of cellular IL-6 and vIL-6 could be influenced by differences in glycosylation of the two cytokines (1Dela Cruz C.S. Lee Y. Viswanathan S.R. El-Guindy A.S. Gerlach J. Nikiforow S. Shedd D. Gradoville L. Miller G. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 503-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). vIL-6 is glycosylated when expressed in primary effusion lymphoma cells in which the KSHV is lytically activated. vIL-6 contains two N-linked glycosylation sites, Asn-78 and Asn-89, both of which are located in site I. N-Linked glycosylation at Asn-89, but not Asn-78, of vIL-6 was critical for optimal gp130 receptor binding, JAK/STAT signaling, and stimulation of B cell proliferation. Neither O- nor N-linked glycosylation of cellular IL-6 was required for the full functional activity. We considered two hypotheses to account for the essential role of glycosylation of Asn-89 of vIL-6. One hypothesis was that N-linked glycosylation of vIL-6 was required for optimal binding to gp130, either via sugar-sugar or sugar-protein interactions. The second, but not mutually exclusive, hypothesis was that N-linked sugars on Asn-89 were required for proper protein folding. The current study highlights the heterogeneity of N-linked glycans in the vIL-6 protein and demonstrates that the Asn-89 glycan, consisting of complex sugars, plays a critical role in the initial folding and conformation of vIL-6. The Asn-89 glycan is dispensable once the protein has properly folded. Site mutants with similar N-linked complex glycans were generated in site I of huIL-6. These homologues of the Asn-89 glycan of vIL-6 did not alter the dependence of huIL-6 on IL-6Rα to interact with gp130. This finding indicated that the N-linked glycan itself did not mediate interaction with the gp130 receptor. Our results show that a virally encoded cytokine, such as vIL-6, distinguishes itself from its cellular homologue through the functional importance of N-linked sugars in modulating protein conformation.

Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 5% FCS at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Optimal transfection conditions were achieved using the DMRIE-C (Invitrogen).

B9.11, an IL-6-dependent mouse plasmacytoma cell line, was used to measure IL-6 activity. Plasmids encoding wild-type and glycosylation site mutants of vIL-6 were constructed using pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen) (1Dela Cruz C.S. Lee Y. Viswanathan S.R. El-Guindy A.S. Gerlach J. Nikiforow S.

Glycosylation site mutants of human IL-6 (E109T and F102N) were generated using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene). The vIL-6 and huIL-6 genes in all clones were sequenced in their entirety. Extracts were prepared from transfected HKB5/B5 cells grown in culture for 48 h. For detection of vIL-6 or huIL-6 protein in HKB5/B5 transfectant supernatants, ∼10 ng of protein was loaded. A 1:200 dilution of vIL-6 rabbit polyclonal antiserum for vIL-6 protein (1Dela Cruz C.S. Lee Y. Viswanathan S.R. El-Guindy A.S. Gerlach J. Nikiforow S. Shedd D. Gradoville L. Miller G. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 503-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) or 1 μg/ml huIL-6 polyclonal antibody (R&D Systems), followed by a 1:200 dilution of a rabbit anti-goat Ig bridge (Sigma-Aldrich) was used for vIL-6 or huIL-6 protein detection, respectively. Immunoreactive bands were detected with 125I-labeled protein A and autoradiography. To detect vIL-6 by ELISA, wells were coated with 2 μg/ml protein A-agarose-purified Ig fraction of rabbit antiserum to vIL-6 in coating buffer (0.1 m carbonate, pH 9.5) and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The wells were washed three times with PBS/0.05% Tween and blocked with PBS/10% FCS in PBS for 3 h at room temperature. Serially diluted culture supernatants were added. Purified Escherichia coli-derived vIL-6 was used to generate a standard curve. Samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. After further washes, 100 μl of biotinylated anti-KSHV IL-6 rabbit antiserum at 2 μg/ml was added for 1 h at room temperature. After PBS/Tween washes, streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) at a dilution of 1:3000 in FCS blocking buffer for 30 min was added. After 10 washes in PBS/Tween, peroxidase activity was detected by adding 50 μl/well tetramethylbenzidine substrate reagent (BD Biosciences). Reaction was stopped using 50 μl of 2 n H2SO4. Absorbances were read at 450 nm using a Coulter MR5000 ELISA reader (Dynatech). For the conformation-specific vIL-6 ELISA, 2 μg/ml protein-A-agarose-purified Ig fraction of rabbit antiserum to vIL-6 was used as capturing antibody, and 2 μg/ml protein-G-agarose purified-monoclonal M12 anti-KSHV IL-6 mouse antibody (kind gift of Y. Aoki and G. Tosato, National Institutes of Health) was used as the detecting antibody followed by secondary antibody donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) at a dilution of 1:3000. Signals obtained using the biotinylated anti-KSHV IL-6 rabbit antiserum for detection were normalized and used to standardize signals detected with the M12 anti-vIL-6 antibody. To detect huIL-6, 2 μg/ml polyclonal anti-huIL-6 goat antibody (R&D Systems) was used as the capturing antibody, and 0.5 μg/ml monoclonal anti-huIL-6 mouse antibody was used as the detecting antibody (R&D Systems) followed by the secondary antibody donkey anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Recombinant huIL-6 (R&D Systems) was used as standard. ELISA plates were coated with soluble gp130 (R&D Systems) at 625 ng/ml in carbonate buffer overnight. After washing with PBS/Tween and blocking with PBS/10% FCS for 3 h, wells were loaded with the vIL-6 supernatants and incubated at 4 °C. After washing, vIL-6 that bound to the sgp130 was detected using 100 μl of biotinylated anti-KSHV IL-6 rabbit antiserum at 2 μg/ml and the secondary reagent of streptavidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. For huIL-6, ELISA plates previously coated with sgp130 were washed and blocked with PBS/10% FCS before the addition of huIL-6 supernatants mixed with 625 ng/ml sIL6-Rα (R&D Systems). After overnight incubation at 4 °C and multiple washings, bound huIL-6 was detected with 2 μg/ml polyclonal anti-huIL-6 goat antibody and donkey anti-goat IgG horseradish peroxidase followed by chromogenic substrates. B9.11 cells were washed three times in RPMI 1640 medium without IL-6. Cells were plated at 4 × 104 cells per 100-μl well in the presence or absence of vIL-6 and huIL-6 preparations. Recombinant forms of both cytokines were expressed in HKB5/B5 cells. After 2 days of culturing B9.11 cells in the presence of serially diluted IL-6 samples, cells were pulsed with 1 μCi per well of (3H) tritiated thymidine for 12–16 h. Proliferation of cells was determined by thymidine incorporation using a 96-well cell harvester and a β-scintillation counter. B cell proliferative responses were expressed as mean [3H]thymidine incorporation (cpm) ± S.E. values of triplicate cultures. One-dimensional peptide separation was performed using porcine-modified trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) to digest recombinant vIL-6 at 30 °C; the digestion reaction was stopped after addition of HCl (final concentration 0.016 n). Digested products were separated in discontinuous polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel made of 30:0.8 acrylamide:bis (18.2% separating gel, 10% spacing gel, and 5% stacking gel). Separate cathode buffer (0.1 m Tris, pH 8.25, 0.1 m Tricine, 0.1% SDS) and anode buffer (0.2 m Tris, pH 8.9) were used. Peptides were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter, which was immunoblotted with rabbit polyclonal anti-KSHV IL-6 antisera (1:100), and detected using autoradiography. To perform two-dimensional peptide mapping, cells were grown first in methionine- and cysteine-depleted media. At 10 h post-transfection of HKB5/B5 cells with plasmids encoding wild-type or mutant forms of vIL-6, the cells were radiolabeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine. Supernatants were collected 24 h post transfection, and vIL-6 protein was immunoprecipitated using polyclonal rabbit anti-KSHV IL-6 antisera and protein-A-agarose beads. Beads containing bound vIL-6 were resuspended in bicarbonate buffer and digested with porcine-derived trypsin for 10 min. Agarose beads were boiled to release digested peptides, which were purified, spotted on a TLC plate, separated in two dimensions (electrophoresis and TLC), and visualized by autoradiography as previously described (23El-Guindy A.S. Heston L. Endo Y. Cho M.S. Miller G. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 11199-11208Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). ConA pulldown assays were performed at 4 °C using ConA-agarose beads (Sigma) mixed with either wild-type or mutant forms of vIL-6 protein. Bound protein and flow through were collected and analyzed in a polyacrylamide gel and immunoblotted for vIL-6 protein using a rabbit polyclonal antibody. Endoglycosidase treatment of IL-6 proteins was performed by incubating the proteins with the various enzymes for 2–4 h at 37 °C under denaturing conditions specified by the manufacturers. These enzymes included N-glycosidase F (PNGase F), endoglycosidase H F1 (Endo F1), endoglycosidase F2, and endoglycosidase F3 (all from Calbiochem). PNGase cleaves between the innermost GlcNAc and asparagine residues of high mannose, hybrid, and complex oligosaccharides from N-linked glycoproteins. Endo F1 removes high mannose (oligomannose) and hybrid structures but not complex, oligosaccharides. Endo F2 and F3 cleave biantennary complex and non-fucosylated biantennary and triantennary structures, respectively. To remove O-linked glycans, proteins were treated with sialidase and O-glycanase (Genyzme Corp.) To digest glycoproteins with O-glycanase, the proteins were first treated with sialidase. Sialidase removes terminal sialic acids, whereas O-glycanase hydrolyzes serine- or threonine-linked unsubstituted O-glycan. Enzymes and appropriate buffer were used according to the protocol provided by the manufacturers. To inhibit various stages of N-linked glycosylation when vIL-6 was being produced in cell culture, 10 μm TM or 100 μm castanospermine were used (Sigma-Aldrich). We previously showed that N-glycosylation at site Asn-89, but not at site Asn-78, of vIL-6 was required for the optimal function of the viral cytokine homolog (1Dela Cruz C.S. Lee Y. Viswanathan S.R. El-Guindy A.S. Gerlach J. Nikiforow S. Shedd D. Gradoville L. Miller G. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 503-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Secreted vIL-6 has been found to contain a large proportion of immature high mannose glycans (10Meads M.B. Medveczky P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 51793-51803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the nature of N-linked glycosylation at the two individual consensus N-linked glycosylation sites was not known. To study the types of glycosylation occurring on vIL-6, we first analyzed wild-type protein. Wild-type vIL-6, expressed in mammalian cells and concentrated from supernatant fluids, was secreted as a single hyperglycosylated product, detectable by a polyclonal antibody to vIL-6 as a single 27-kDa species (Fig. 1, lane 1). This protein was susceptible to digestion with PNGase (lane 2), confirming that it contained N-linked sugars. Digestion with endoglycosidase H F1 (Endo F1), which selectively removes high mannose sugars and some hybrid glycans, produced two distinct species, one of which appeared to be fully susceptible to the enzyme; the other species appeared to be partially resistant to Endo F1 digestion (lane 3). These results suggested that there could be heterogeneity in the nature of high mannose glycosylation at the two N-linked sites of vIL-6. Moreover, the product following PNGase digestion (Fig. 1, lane 2) migrated more slowly than the fully susceptible product observed following Endo F1 digestion. This result suggested that PNGase did not completely remove all the N-linked sugars from wild-type vIL-6. Wild-type vIL-6 was also susceptible to digestion with sialidase, which removes terminal sialic acids. Addition of O-glycanase to sialidase did not alter the electrophoretic mobility of the digestion product (Fig. 1, lanes 4 and 5). This result is consistent with the prediction that wild-type vIL-6 lacks O-linked glycosylation sites. KSHV IL-6 has two N-linked glycosylation consensus sites, represented by Asn-X-Ser/Thr, where X can be any amino acid; these sites are located at Asn-78 and Asn-89. To study the nature of N-linked glycosylation at each site, we generated site-directed mutants, N78K and N89K, and the double mutant N78K/N89K. Single mutant forms of vIL-6, N78K and N89K, both migrated faster than the wild-type protein at ∼25 kDa (Fig. 2A, compare lanes 1, 6, and 11). The double mutant N78K/N89K, which lacked both N-linked glycosylation sites, migrated fastest at ∼22 kDa (Fig. 2A, lane 16). When both sites were N-glycosylated, PNGase treatment produced partial digestion of wild-type vIL-6 (Fig. 2A, lane 2). However, PNGase treatment of either single mutant yielded a completely digested non-glycosylated form of the protein, which co-migrated with the double mutant N78K/N89K (Fig. 2A, lanes 7, 12, and 16). This result suggests that the enzyme PNGase works more efficiently when there is only one N-linked sugar chain on the vIL-6 protein. Endo F1 digestion of WT vIL-6 protein resulted in two species; one was susceptible to the enzyme and the other was partially resistant (Fig. 1, lane 3 and Fig. 2A, lane 3). The N78K single mutant was predominantly resistant to Endo F1 digestion (Fig. 2A, lane 8). In contrast, the N89K single mutant vIL-6 protein was sensitive to Endo F1 digestion (Fig. 2A, lane 13). This result indicated that high mannose type N-linked sugars are present on site Asn-78 of the vIL-6 protein, whereas most of the sugars in Asn-89 site are not of the high-mannose type (Fig. 2A, lanes 8 and 13). The results with Endo F1 digestion confirmed that there was heterogeneity in the nature of high mannose glycosylation at the two N-linked sites of vIL-6. Endoglycosidase F2 and F3 did not digest either wild type or the single mutants (Fig. 2A, lanes 4–5, 9–10, and 14–15). Asn to Gln mutants were also generated to produce single (N78Q and N89Q) and double vIL-6 mutants (N78Q/N89Q). This Asn to Gln change maintains the neutral amide content of the amino acid. The molecular weights of the protein products of the Asn to Gln substitution mutants and their sensitivity to Endo F1 digestion were similar to those seen with the Asn to Lys single and double mutant forms of vIL-6 (Fig. 2B). The single mutant form of vIL-6 N89Q was sensitive to Endo F1 digestion; the vIL-6 N78Q counterpart was resistant. These experiments with two different amino acid substitution mutants confirmed that the two N-glycosylation sites have different patterns of glycosylation. We examined the N-linked glycosylation state of the two sites on vIL-6 proteins expressed in insect cells, where high mannose glycosylation predominates (24Harrison R.L. Jarvis D.L. Adv. Virus Res. 2006; 68: 159-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Wild-type vIL-6 expressed in insect cells was relatively more sensitive to Endo F1 digestion than was WT vIL-6 produced in mammalian cells (Fig. 2C, lane 4 versus 2). Each of the single mutants was less heavily glycosylated in insect cells than in mammalian cells, because the untreated protein had faster electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 2C, lanes 5 versus 7, 9 versus 11). Both the Asn-89 site and the Asn-78 site were more sensitive to Endo F1 digestion in insect cells. All of these observations support the idea that insect cells produce proteins with simpler sugars containing mannose. However, there remained a significant difference between the two sites in their sensitivity to Endo F1 digestion. The Asn-89 site was partially resistant, and Asn-78 site was completely sensitive to Endo F1 digestion (Fig. 2C, lanes 6, 8, 10, and 12). This result supports the idea that the two N-linked sites of vIL-6 are differentially glycosylated, even in insect cells. N-Glycosylation of wild-type vIL-6 and both single mutants was inhibited by growth in the presence of TM (Fig. 2D). TM inhibits the first step of the N-glycosylation pathway, which involves the transfer of GlcNAc-1-P from UDP-GlcNAc to dolichol"
https://openalex.org/W2144625510,"A growing number of emerging HIV-1 recombinants classified as circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) have been identified in Southeast Asia in recent years, establishing a molecular diversity of increasing complexity in the region. Here, we constructed a replication-competent HIV-1 clone for CRF33_01B (designated p05MYKL045.1), a newly identified recombinant comprised of CRF01_AE and subtype B. p05MYKL045.1 was reconstituted by cloning of the near full-length HIV-1 sequence from a newly-diagnosed individual presumably infected heterosexually in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The chimeric clone, which contains the 5' LTR (long terminal repeat) region of p93JP-NH1 (a previously isolated CRF01_AE infectious clone), showed robust viral replication in the human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This clone demonstrated robust viral propagation and profound syncytium formation in CD4+, CXCR4-expressing human glioma NP-2 cells, indicating that p05MYKL045.1 is a CXCR4-using virus. Viral propagation, however, was not detected in various human T cell lines including MT-2, M8166, Sup-T1, H9, Jurkat, Molt-4 and PM1. p05MYKL045.1 appears to proliferate only in restricted host range, suggesting that unknown viral and/or cellular host factors may play a role in viral infectivity and replication in human T cell lines. Availability of a CRF33_01B molecular clone will be useful in facilitating the development of vaccine candidates that match the HIV-1 strains circulating in Southeast Asia."
https://openalex.org/W2024937147,"Background Limitations of the clinical efficacy of dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy, as well as difficulties in their industrial production, are largely related to the limited number of autologous DCs from each patient. We here established a possible breakthrough, a simple and cytokine-based culture method to realize a log-scale order of functional murine DCs (>1,000-fold), which cells were used as a model before moving to human studies. Methodology/Principal Findings Floating cultivation of lineage-negative hematopoietic progenitors from bone marrow in an optimized cytokine cocktail (FLT3-L, IL-3, IL-6, and SCF) led to a stable log-scale proliferation of these cells, and a subsequent differentiation study using IL-4/GM-CSF revealed that 3-weeks of expansion was optimal to produce CD11b+/CD11c+ DC-like cells. The expanded DCs had typical features of conventional myeloid DCs in vitro and in vivo, including identical efficacy as tumor vaccines. Conclusions/Significance The concept of DC expansion should make a significant contribution to the progress of DC-based immunotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2056563640,"Background The weekly proportion of laboratory tests that are positive for influenza is used in public health surveillance systems to identify periods of influenza activity. We aimed to estimate the sensitivity of influenza testing in Canada based on results of a national respiratory virus surveillance system. Methods and Findings The weekly number of influenza-negative tests from 1999 to 2006 was modelled as a function of laboratory-confirmed positive tests for influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus and parainfluenza viruses, seasonality, and trend using Poisson regression. Sensitivity was calculated as the number of influenza positive tests divided by the number of influenza positive tests plus the model-estimated number of false negative tests. The sensitivity of influenza testing was estimated to be 33% (95%CI 32–34%), varying from 30–40% depending on the season and region. Conclusions The estimated sensitivity of influenza tests reported to this national laboratory surveillance system is considerably less than reported test characteristics for most laboratory tests. A number of factors may explain this difference, including sample quality and specimen procurement issues as well as test characteristics. Improved diagnosis would permit better estimation of the burden of influenza."
https://openalex.org/W2095871810,"In primitive erythroid cells of human beta-globin locus transgenic mice (TgM), the locus control region (LCR)-proximal epsilon- and gamma-globin genes are transcribed, whereas the distal delta- and beta-globin genes are silent. It is generally accepted that the beta-globin gene is competitively suppressed by gamma-globin gene expression at this developmental stage. Previously, however, we observed that epsilon-globin gene expression was severely attenuated when its distance from the LCR was extended, implying that beta-globin gene might also be silenced because of its great distance from the LCR. Here, to clarify the beta-globin gene silencing mechanism, we established TgM lines carrying either gamma- or epsilon- plus gamma-globin promoter deletions, without significantly altering the distance between the beta-globin gene and the LCR. Precocious expression of delta- and beta-globin genes was observed in primitive erythroid cells of mutant, but not wild-type TgM, which was most evident when both the epsilon and gamma promoters were deleted. Thus, we clearly demonstrated that the repression of the delta- and beta-globin genes in primitive erythroid cells is dominated by competitive silencing by the epsilon- and gamma-globin gene promoters, and that epsilon- and the other beta-like globin genes might be activated by two distinct mechanisms by the LCR."
https://openalex.org/W1987869850,"The fundamental difference between classic and modern biology is that technological innovations allow to generate high-throughput data to get insights into molecular interactions on a genomic scale. These high-throughput data can be used to infer gene networks, e.g., the transcriptional regulatory or signaling network, representing a blue print of the current dynamical state of the cellular system. However, gene networks do not provide direct answers to biological questions, instead, they need to be analyzed to reveal functional information of molecular working mechanisms. In this paper we propose a new approach to analyze the transcriptional regulatory network of yeast to predict cell cycle regulated genes. The novelty of our approach is that, in contrast to all other approaches aiming to predict cell cycle regulated genes, we do not use time series data but base our analysis on the prior information of causal interactions among genes. The major purpose of the present paper is to predict cell cycle regulated genes in S. cerevisiae. Our analysis is based on the transcriptional regulatory network, representing causal interactions between genes, and a list of known periodic genes. No further data are used. Our approach utilizes the causal membership of genes and the hierarchical organization of the transcriptional regulatory network leading to two groups of periodic genes with a well defined direction of information flow. We predict genes as periodic if they appear on unique shortest paths connecting two periodic genes from different hierarchy levels. Our results demonstrate that a classical problem as the prediction of cell cycle regulated genes can be seen in a new light if the concept of a causal membership of a gene is applied consequently. This also shows that there is a wealth of information buried in the transcriptional regulatory network whose unraveling may require more elaborate concepts than it might seem at first."
https://openalex.org/W2060035374,"Background In this report we evaluate the use of Xenopus laevis oocytes as a matched germ cell system for characterizing the organization and transcriptional activity of a germ cell-specific X. laevis promoter. Principal Findings The promoter from the ALF transcription factor gene was cloned from X. laevis genomic DNA using a PCR-based genomic walking approach. The endogenous ALF gene was characterized by RACE and RT-PCR for transcription start site usage, and by sodium bisulfite sequencing to determine its methylation status in somatic and oocyte tissues. Homology between the X. laevis ALF promoter sequence and those from human, chimpanzee, macaque, mouse, rat, cow, pig, horse, dog, chicken and X. tropicalis was relatively low, making it difficult to use such comparisons to identify putative regulatory elements. However, microinjected promoter constructs were very active in oocytes and the minimal promoter could be narrowed by PCR-mediated deletion to a region as short as 63 base pairs. Additional experiments using a series of site-specific promoter mutants identified two cis-elements within the 63 base pair minimal promoter that were critical for activity. Both elements (A and B) were specifically recognized by proteins present in crude oocyte extracts based on oligonucleotide competition assays. The activity of promoter constructs in oocytes and in transfected somatic Xenopus XLK-WG kidney epithelial cells was quite different, indicating that the two cell types are not functionally equivalent and are not interchangeable as assay systems. Conclusions Overall the results provide the first detailed characterization of the organization of a germ cell-specific Xenopus promoter and demonstrate the feasibility of using immature frog oocytes as an assay system for dissecting the biochemistry of germ cell gene regulation."
