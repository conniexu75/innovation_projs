The fragments were prepared by successive treatments of specifically purified antiovalbumin or antibovine gamma globulin with pepsin and 0.01 M mercaptoethylamine at 37”. The sedimentation co- efficient after reoxidation was almost identical to that observed before reduction, suggesting that the reconstituted antibody is bivalent. Upon reduction of the recombined material, break- down to -3.5 S occurs once again. The amino acid composition of the 5 S protein formed by peptic digestion is consistent with previous evidence indicating that this fragment consists es- sentially of Porter’s fractions I and II. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17. 18. 19. 20.

The BALB/c strain had 1.34 microg of serotonin per gram of dissected brain, and the C57 bl/10 had 1.07 microg/g. This difference was statistically significant (P < 0.01). The levels of norepinephrine were not significantly different in the two strains (P > 0.25)."

The greatest reduction, 53 percent, was obtained with a warning interval of 1 second. Warning also reduces variance of the response over trials, a decrease of over 90 percent for the optimum 1-second interval."

The interactions between viral and cellular functions show that infection with a virus is not just a disrupting intrusion; it is an addition to the cellular endowment of genetic specificity. The outcome of this addition depends on the nature of the instructions carried by the viral genome, on the ability of the cellular machinery to carry out these instructions, and on the availability of control mechanisms to regulate the functions of the added element."

https://openalex.org/W2009772195,"When myo-inositol is present in a growing culture of Streptomyces griseus the yield of streptomycin is increased, and the amount of carbon-14-from uniformly labeled glucose-incorporated into the streptidine and streptobiosamine moieties of streptomycin is lowered by 41 percent and 21.7 percent, respectively. These results present strong indirect evidence for the participation of myo-inositol or its metabolic products in streptidine biosynthesis."

This effect became larger with increased target speed, with decreased illumination, and with longer exposure of the acuity object. The acuity object's orientation also influenced the results."

This method results from combining the techniques of column chromatography and the lysimetric determinations of soil analysis. Proteins are successively extracted by means of increasing concentrations of the same solvent in water or by a series of different solvents with an increasing ability to dissolve proteins."

https://openalex.org/W1990839996,"IN human population groups a primary dichotomy (so-called ‘non-taster’ and ‘taster’ classes with some overlap) in the distribution of thresholds of taste for phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) was established by the early work of Hartmann1 and others. Falconer2 noted the irregular nature of the distributions of ‘non-taster’ material; and Lugg and Whyte3, from the results (corrected for the effects of age and sex) of their investigations of southern Chinese, European, southern Indian and Malay ethnic groups, considered these distributions to be potentially (if not always actually) bimodal, a view which was supported by subsequent work4 on Negrito and Senoi subjects. They3 also questioned the presumption that ‘taster’ material is always unimodally distributed; but it was realized4 that the distribution irregularities might be due to sampling errors rather than to intrinsic causes. The question remained open, however, and it was hoped that clarification of the overall picture of threshold distributions might come with the accumulation of additional data from work on other ethnic groups."

https://openalex.org/W2051058294,"ASCORBIC acid has been utilized extensively in large doses in the therapy of industrial methæmoglobinæmia, although Halsted1 commented that at developments greater than 60 per cent methæmoglobinæmia, it is ineffective because of its lack of ability to bring on rapidly a reversion mechanism. But the rapidity of reversion is only the first problem. The second problem to be settled is whether, in chemical cyanosis, the effect of ascorbic acid may not be restricted only to bring about the reduction. It is known that ascorbic acid promotes the rate of hydroxylation of aniline to p-aminophenol2, which is a potent agent in the production of Heinz bodies not only in vivo but also in vitro3, and ascorbic acid is able to produce Heinz bodies in vitro without any toxic agents4. We have found that in rats poisoned with aniline the formation of Heinz bodies is promoted by treatment with ascorbic acid."

https://openalex.org/W2059168076,The stimulating effect of oxytetracycline is evident in the fraction beta -globulins plus fibrinogen in both irradiated and non-irradiated chickens and in the gamma -globulins of the irradiated chickens. ln the other fractions of the blood plasma proteins the administration of oxytetracycline did not manifest itself. The active share of oxytetracycline in the transformation of blood plasma proteins is an indirect one and the mechanism is not fully understood. (N.W.R.)
