https://openalex.org/W4293581901,"Abstract Aggregation of alpha-synuclein (α-Syn) drives Parkinson’s disease (PD), although the initial stages of self-assembly and structural conversion have not been directly observed inside neurons. In this study, we tracked the intracellular conformational states of α-Syn using a single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) biosensor, and we show here that α-Syn converts from a monomeric state into two distinct oligomeric states in neurons in a concentration-dependent and sequence-specific manner. Three-dimensional FRET-correlative light and electron microscopy (FRET-CLEM) revealed that intracellular seeding events occur preferentially on membrane surfaces, especially at mitochondrial membranes. The mitochondrial lipid cardiolipin triggers rapid oligomerization of A53T α-Syn, and cardiolipin is sequestered within aggregating lipid–protein complexes. Mitochondrial aggregates impair complex I activity and increase mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which accelerates the oligomerization of A53T α-Syn and causes permeabilization of mitochondrial membranes and cell death. These processes were also observed in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)–derived neurons harboring A53T mutations from patients with PD. Our study highlights a mechanism of de novo α-Syn oligomerization at mitochondrial membranes and subsequent neuronal toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W4293582084,"We show that the sex of human experimenters affects mouse behaviors and responses following administration of the rapid-acting antidepressant ketamine and its bioactive metabolite (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine. Mice showed aversion to the scent of male experimenters, preference for the scent of female experimenters and increased stress susceptibility when handled by male experimenters. This human-male-scent-induced aversion and stress susceptibility was mediated by the activation of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) neurons in the entorhinal cortex that project to hippocampal area CA1. Exposure to the scent of male experimenters before ketamine administration activated CA1-projecting entorhinal cortex CRF neurons, and activation of this CRF pathway modulated in vivo and in vitro antidepressant-like effects of ketamine. A better understanding of the specific and quantitative contributions of the sex of human experimenters to study outcomes in rodents may improve replicability between studies and, as we have shown, reveal biological and pharmacological mechanisms. Georgiou et al. found that the sex of the person performing experiments affects mouse behavior, including responses to stress and ketamine. This effect was mediated by corticotropin-releasing factor neurons in the entorhinal cortex that project to CA1."
https://openalex.org/W4293582130,"Fiber photometry enables recording of population neuronal calcium dynamics in awake mice. While the popularity of fiber photometry has grown in recent years, it remains unclear whether photometry reflects changes in action potential firing (that is, 'spiking') or other changes in neuronal calcium. In microscope-based calcium imaging, optical and analytical approaches can help differentiate somatic from neuropil calcium. However, these approaches cannot be readily applied to fiber photometry. As such, it remains unclear whether the fiber photometry signal reflects changes in somatic calcium, changes in nonsomatic calcium or a combination of the two. Here, using simultaneous in vivo extracellular electrophysiology and fiber photometry, along with in vivo endoscopic one-photon and two-photon calcium imaging, we determined that the striatal fiber photometry does not reflect spiking-related changes in calcium and instead primarily reflects nonsomatic changes in calcium."
https://openalex.org/W4293582032,"Astrocytes negatively impact neuronal development in many models of neurodevelopmental disorders (NDs); however, how they do this, and if mechanisms are shared across disorders, is not known. In this study, we developed a cell culture system to ask how astrocyte protein secretion and gene expression change in three mouse models of genetic NDs (Rett, Fragile X and Down syndromes). ND astrocytes increase release of Igfbp2, a secreted inhibitor of insulin-like growth factor (IGF). IGF rescues neuronal deficits in many NDs, and we found that blocking Igfbp2 partially rescues inhibitory effects of Rett syndrome astrocytes, suggesting that increased astrocyte Igfbp2 contributes to decreased IGF signaling in NDs. We identified that increased BMP signaling is upstream of protein secretion changes, including Igfbp2, and blocking BMP signaling in Fragile X and Rett syndrome astrocytes reverses inhibitory effects on neurite outgrowth. This work provides a resource of astrocyte-secreted proteins in health and ND models and identifies novel targets for intervention in diverse NDs. Caldwell et al. provide a resource of astrocyte-secreted proteins from models of neurodevelopmental disorders and use this to identify upregulated levels of the IGF inhibitor Igfbp2 as contributing to neural developmental deficits in Rett syndrome."
https://openalex.org/W4293581938,"Primary sensory cortex is thought to process incoming sensory information, while decision variables important for driving behavior are assumed to arise downstream in the processing hierarchy. Here, we used population two-photon calcium imaging and targeted two-photon optogenetic stimulation of neurons in layer 2/3 of mouse primary somatosensory cortex (S1) during a texture discrimination task to test for the presence of decision signals and probe their behavioral relevance. Small but distinct populations of neurons carried information about the stimulus irrespective of the behavioral outcome (stimulus neurons), or about the choice irrespective of the presented stimulus (decision neurons). Decision neurons show categorical coding that develops during learning, and lack a conclusive decision signal in Miss trials. All-optical photostimulation of decision neurons during behavior improves behavioral performance, establishing a causal role in driving behavior. The fact that stimulus and decision neurons are intermingled challenges the idea of S1 as a purely sensory area, and causal perturbation suggests a direct involvement of S1 decision neurons in the decision-making process. The authors identify neurons in primary somatosensory cortex that do not encode the stimulus, but rather the decision of the mouse, and show that this signal can drive behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4293785817,"COVID-19 had a huge mortality impact in the US in 2020 and accounted for most of the overall reduction in 2020 life expectancy at birth. There were also extensive racial/ethnic disparities in the mortality impact of COVID-19 in 2020, with the Black and Latino populations experiencing reductions in life expectancy at birth over twice as large as that of the White population. Despite continued vulnerability of these populations, the hope was that widespread distribution of effective vaccines would mitigate the overall mortality impact and reduce racial/ethnic disparities in 2021. In this study, we quantify the mortality impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 2021 US period life expectancy by race and ethnicity and compare these impacts to those estimated for 2020. Our estimates indicate that racial/ethnic disparities have persisted, and that the US population experienced a decline in life expectancy at birth in 2021 of 2.2 years from 2019, 0.6 years more than estimated for 2020. The corresponding reductions estimated for the Black and Latino populations are slightly below twice that for Whites, suggesting smaller disparities than those in 2020. However, all groups experienced additional reductions in life expectancy at birth relative to 2020, and this apparent narrowing of disparities is primarily the result of Whites experiencing proportionately greater increases in mortality in 2021 compared with the corresponding increases in mortality for the Black and Latino populations in 2021. Estimated declines in life expectancy at age 65 increased slightly for Whites between 2020 and 2021 but decreased for both the Black and Latino populations, resulting in the same overall reduction (0.8 years) estimated for 2020 and 2021."

https://openalex.org/W4293786358,"Existing evidence shows positive effects of being in nature on wellbeing, but we know little about the mental health benefits of spending time near canals and rivers specifically. This study investigates the association between visits to canals and rivers and mental wellbeing. We addressed the following questions: Are visits to canals and rivers associated with higher levels of mental wellbeing? Does this association depend on age and gender? Does this association vary between people with and without a diagnosis on mental illness? We used Urban Mind, a flexible smartphone application for examining the impact of different aspects of the built and social environment on mental wellbeing, a strong predictor of mental health. Participants were invited to complete an ecological momentary assessment three times a day for fourteen days. Each assessment included questions about their surrounding environment and mental wellbeing. A total of 7,975 assessments were completed by 299 participants including 87 with a diagnosis of mental illness. Multilevel regression models were used to analyse the data. We found positive associations between visits to canals and rivers and mental wellbeing (p &lt; .05) when compared to being anywhere else and when compared to being in green spaces. Increases in mental wellbeing were still evident after the visit had taken place. These effects remained significant after adjusting for age, gender, ethnicity and education, and were consistent in people with and without a diagnosis of mental illness. Spending time near canals and rivers is associated with better mental wellbeing. These findings have potential implications for mental health as well as urban planning and policy. Visits to canals and rivers could become part of social prescribing schemes, playing a role in preventing mental health difficulties and complementing more traditional interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3186778980,"Legalization of cannabis by U.S. states is likely increasing the use of cannabis as an alternative to conventional pharmaceutical drugs. We examined how cannabis legalization between 1996 and 2019 affected stock market returns for listed generic and brand pharmaceutical companies and found that returns were 1.5-2% lower at 10 days after legalization. Returns decreased in response to both medical and recreational legalization, for both generic and brand drugmakers. Investors anticipate a single legalization event to reduce drugmaker annual sales by $3B on average."

https://openalex.org/W4293786961,"Recent research in economics emphasizes the role of in utero conditions for the health endowment at birth and in early childhood and for social as well as economic outcomes in later life. This paper analyzes the relation between maternal mental health during pregnancy and birth outcomes of the child. In particular, we analyze the relationship between maternal mental health during pregnancy and the probability of giving birth preterm (PT), having a newborn at low birth weight (LBW) or being small for gestational age (SGA). Based on large population-representative data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) and cohort data from the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS), we present extensive descriptive evidence on the relationship between maternal mental health and preterm birth by carrying out OLS estimates controlling for a wide range of socioeconomic characteristics. In addition, we apply matching estimators and mother fixed effects models, which bring us closer toward a causal interpretation of estimates. In summary, the results uniformly provide evidence that poor maternal mental health is a risk factor for preterm birth and low birth weight in offspring. In contrast, we find no evidence for an relationship between maternal mental health and small for gestational age at birth."
https://openalex.org/W4293787810,"Objective To examine whether the pandemic in 2020 caused changes in psychiatric hospital cases, the percentage of patients exposed to coercive interventions, and aggressive incidents. Methods We used the case registry for coercive measures of the State of Baden-Wuerttemberg, comprising case-related data on mechanical restraint, seclusion, physical restraint, and forced medication in each of the State’s 31 licensed hospitals treating adults, to compare data from 2019 and 2020. Results The number of cases in adult psychiatry decreased by 7.6% from 105,782 to 97,761. The percentage of involuntary cases increased from 12.3 to 14.1%, and the absolute number of coercive measures increased by 4.7% from 26,269 to 27,514. The percentage of cases exposed to any kind of coercive measure increased by 24.6% from 6.5 to 8.1%, and the median cumulative duration per affected case increased by 13.1% from 12.2 to 13.8 hrs, where seclusion increased more than mechanical restraint. The percentage of patients with aggressive incidents, collected in 10 hospitals, remained unchanged. Conclusions While voluntary cases decreased considerably during the pandemic, involuntary cases increased slightly. However, the increased percentage of patients exposed to coercion is not only due to a decreased percentage of voluntary patients, as the duration of coercive measures per case also increased. The changes that indicate deterioration in treatment quality were probably caused by the multitude of measures to manage the pandemic. The focus of attention and internal rules as well have shifted from prevention of coercion to prevention of infection."
https://openalex.org/W4293788400,"Purpose Neutrophil serine proteases (NSPs) are implicated in numerous inflammatory diseases. Thus, a robust methodology to monitor and quantify NSPs is important to study disease progression and evaluate the effect of pharmacological interventions. A comparison of the various methods used to extract NSPs from neutrophil granulocytes has not been published, providing the impetus to conduct this method optimization and comparison study. Methods Two NSP recovery methodologies were evaluated on samples from five human donors: zymosan stimulation and cell pellet extraction. For the zymosan stimulation method, 1 mL donor blood was added to zymosan and samples were incubated at 37°C for 30 min while shaking. Samples were then centrifuged, and the plasma was collected for quantitation of NSP activity. For the cell pellet extraction procedure, 2 mL whole blood samples were centrifuged into white blood cell pellets following red blood cell lysis. To each pellet, three sequential lysis steps were performed using either 0.05% Nonidet P-40 Substitute (NP40) or 0.02% Triton X-100 lysis buffers under agitation followed by centrifugation. NSP activities were quantified using an exogenous peptide substrate specific to each of the three NSPs being analyzed: neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3. Results and discussion The zymosan stimulation method resulted in lower recovery of active NSPs and was unable to stimulate significant release of active cathepsin G. In contrast, the NP40 pellet extraction method showed consistent inter-donor NSP release with greater recoveries of active NSPs than the Triton method or the zymosan stimulation method. Overall, the pellet extraction procedure provided 13.3-fold greater recovery of active neutrophil elastase, 283-fold greater recovery of active cathepsin G, and 2.9-fold greater recovery of active proteinase 3 than the zymosan method. Conclusion The NP40 cell pellet extraction method resulted in greater extraction of active NSPs compared to the other methods investigated here, which may allow for a more accurate and complete biomarker profile when evaluating human clinical samples."
https://openalex.org/W4293785258,"To achieve optimal performance in sports, it is essential to have strong perceptual cognitive abilities. Evidence suggests that athletes have superior perceptual abilities compared to nonathletes. However, gender differences in athletes' perceptual cognitive abilities have not been previously reported. This project aims to evaluate perceptual cognitive abilities among male and female adolescents. To measure perceptual abilities, a 3-dimensional multiple-object tracking task was used. The findings confirm the superior perceptual cognitive abilities in young athletes relative to nonathletes. However, our results indicate differences in performance patterns between male and female athletes. These results demonstrate that sports engagement and perceptual cognitive abilities are strongly related during adolescence and that this relationship seems more prevalent in male athletes for this age group."
https://openalex.org/W4293787289,"This study identified the social determinants of health (SDoH) associated with psychological distress in adults with and without a self-reported history of traumatic brain injury (TBI), stratified by sex. Data from the 2014–2017 cycles of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health Monitor Survey, a representative survey of adults ≥18 years in Ontario, Canada, were analyzed (N = 7,214). The six-item version of the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale was used to determine moderate to severe psychological distress. Self-reported lifetime TBI was defined as a head injury resulting in a loss of consciousness for ≥5 minutes or at least one-night stay in the hospital (16.4%). Among individuals reporting a history of TBI, 30.2% of males and 40.1% of females reported psychological distress (p = 0.0109). Among individuals who did not report a history of TBI, 17.9% of males and 23.5% of females reported psychological distress (p&lt;0.0001). Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that the SDoH significantly associated with elevated psychological distress were similar between individuals with and without a history of TBI. This included unemployment, student, or ‘other’ employment status among both males and females; income below the provincial median and age 65+ among males; and rural residence among females. This study highlighted opportunities for targeted population-level interventions, namely accessible and affordable mental health supports for individuals with lower income. Notably, this study presented evidence suggesting adaptations to existing services to accommodate challenges associated with TBI should be explored, given the finite and competing demands for mental health care and resources."
https://openalex.org/W4293787290,"Child dental caries (i.e., cavities) are a major preventable health problem in most high-income countries. The aim of this study was to compare the extent of inequalities in child dental caries across four high-income countries alongside their child oral health policies. Coordinated analyses of data were conducted across four prospective population-based birth cohorts (Australia, n = 4085, born 2004; Québec, Canada, n = 1253, born 1997; Rotterdam, the Netherlands, n = 6690, born 2002; Southeast Sweden, n = 7445, born 1997), which enabled a high degree of harmonization. Risk ratios (adjusted) and slope indexes of inequality were estimated to quantify social gradients in child dental caries according to maternal education and household income. Children in the least advantaged quintile for income were at greater risk of caries, compared to the most advantaged quintile: Australia: AdjRR = 1.18, 95%CI = 1.04-1.34; Québec: AdjRR = 1.69, 95%CI = 1.36-2.10; Rotterdam: AdjRR = 1.67, 95%CI = 1.36-2.04; Southeast Sweden: AdjRR = 1.37, 95%CI = 1.10-1.71). There was a higher risk of caries for children of mothers with the lowest level of education, compared to the highest: Australia: AdjRR = 1.18, 95%CI = 1.01-1.38; Southeast Sweden: AdjRR = 2.31, 95%CI = 1.81-2.96; Rotterdam: AdjRR = 1.98, 95%CI = 1.71-2.30; Québec: AdjRR = 1.16, 95%CI = 0.98-1.37. The extent of inequalities varied in line with jurisdictional policies for provision of child oral health services and preventive public health measures. Clear gradients of social inequalities in child dental caries are evident in high-income countries. Policy related mechanisms may contribute to the differences in the extent of these inequalities. Lesser gradients in settings with combinations of universal dental coverage and/or fluoridation suggest these provisions may ameliorate inequalities through additional benefits for socio-economically disadvantaged groups of children."
https://openalex.org/W4293787702,"There is a strong body of evidence by several translational studies which demonstrate the potential of circulating miRNAs as a potential biomarker in oncology. However, recent reports documented varying stability of these small RNA molecules in serum samples. The aim of our pilot study was to evaluate the stability of miRNAs in serum in relation to food intake and sample storage. Serum miRNA expression levels of 16 different miRNAs from 8 healthy volunteers were quantified by real-time PCR. 4 samples from each donor were analysed—2 samples (fasting, in the morning and after food intake, at noon) were analysed within 24h and 2 samples (fasting and after food intake, at noon) were stored at -80°C for 14 days and subsequently analysed. Student´s t-test was used to determine significant differences. The detectability of the distinct miRNA as a surrogate for the stability of these small RNA molecules was slightly altered by the storage conditions, but only a miRNA 22-3p, out of the analysed 16 miRNAs, shows significant lower dCq expression (3.821 vs. 4.530; p&lt;0,01) by qPCR dependent on storage conditions (-80°C vs. 4°C). However, miRNA levels were not affected by food intake. The difference between samples taken in the morning (fasting) and at noon (after a normal meal) did not show any significant differences. MiRNAs can be considered to be a relatively stable tool in laboratory diagnostics, but clearly every new assay needs thorough evaluation. The stability of miRNAs documented here in healthy volunteers shows their potential in the search for innovative biomarkers in oncology."
https://openalex.org/W4293787813,"This paper’s aim is to propose a mediation framework and test whether lifestyle choices and social capital are pathways through which locus of control (LoC) affects subjective well-being. Using longitudinal data for Australia, we find that life satisfaction and mental health are explained by direct and indirect effects of LoC. The direct effect is positive, indicating that individuals with an internal LoC have higher levels of life satisfaction and mental health. We also show that physical activity and social interaction are two pathways linking an internal LoC to higher levels of well-being. Our findings provide new insights into the relationship between LoC and subjective well-being and suggest that, if the aim of policy is to improve well-being, the focus should be on enabling people to develop an internal LoC. This may lead to higher well-being both through the identified channels and, more importantly, through the direct channel of LoC."
https://openalex.org/W4293788208,"Burns can cause cell death and irreversible tissue damage. We examined the pathway of human dermis fibroblasts cell death caused by skin burns and the roles of chloroquine in human skin keratinocytes HaCaT wound healing. Western blot assays were performed to assess expression of proteins associated with autophagy, apoptosis, and endoplasmic reticulum stress in skin cells following burns. Changes in apoptosis-related proteins were assessed using flow cytometry, and wound cell migration was examined using wound healing assays. The burn animal model was used to test whether chloroquine would promote wound healing. In human burned fibroblasts, expression of LC3B-II and Cleave-caspase-7 was increased, whereas expression of Beclin-1, p62, and Grp78 was decreased. Severe burn induced ER stress and ERK phosphorylation, but PD98059 or necrostatin-1 treatment cells did not affect expression of autophagy LC3B-II protein and can induce apoptosis. Even though added with TGF-β and FGF did not repair autophagy caused by burns. Suggesting that autophagy and apoptosis were involved in heat-injured mechanism. Recombinant Wnt3a protein can help restore expression of β-catenin which reduced following burns in keratinocytes. Wnt3a protein can promote migration of keratinocytes after burns. Interesting, chloroquine increased expression of LC3B-II protein and restored cell migration activity after 24 h of burns. Consistently, surgical dressing containing chloroquine promoted wound healing in a burn animal mode. Autophagy and Wnt/β-catenin is two signalling pathways that participate in cell repair and wound healing in human fibroblasts, keratinocytes. Surgical dressing containing chloroquine can recover wound healing in burned rats."
https://openalex.org/W4293788985,"Phylogenetic analysis, homology modelling and biochemical methods have been employed to characterize a phytase from a Gram-negative soil bacterium. Acinetobacter sp. AC1-2 phytase belongs to clade 2 of the histidine (acid) phytases, to the Multiple Inositol Polyphosphate Phosphatase (MINPP) subclass. The enzyme was extraordinarily stable in solution both at room temperature and 4°C, retaining near 100% activity over 755 days. It showed a broad pH activity profile from 2-8.5 with maxima at 3, 4.5-5 and 6. The enzyme showed Michaelis-Menten kinetics and substrate inhibition (Vmax, Km, and Ki, 228 U/mg, 0.65 mM and 2.23 mM, respectively). Homology modelling using the crystal structure of a homologous MINPP from a human gut commensal bacterium indicated the presence of a potentially stabilising polypeptide loop (a U-loop) straddling the active site. By employ of the enantiospecificity of Arabidopsis inositol tris/tetrakisphosphate kinase 1 for inositol pentakisphosphates, we show AC1-2 MINPP to possess D6-phytase activity, which allowed modelling of active site specificity pockets for InsP6 substrate. While phytase gene transcription was unaltered in rich media, it was repressed in minimal media with phytic acid and orthophosphate as phosphate sources. The results of this study reveal AC1-2 MINPP to possess desirable attributes relevant to biotechnological use."
https://openalex.org/W4293785339,"Palm pressed fibre (PPF) is a lignocellulose biomass generated from palm oil mill that is rich in cellulose. The present work aimed to combine acid hydrolysis followed by high-pressure homogenisation (HPH) to produce nanocrystal cellulose (CNC) with enhanced physicochemical properties from PPF. PPF was alkaline treated, bleached, acid hydrolysed and homogenised under high pressure condition to prepare CNC. The effects of homogenisation pressure (10, 30, 50, 70 MPa) and cycles (1, 3, 5, 7) on the particle size, zeta potential and rheological properties of CNC produced were investigated. HPH was capable of producing CNC with better stability. Results revealed that utilizing 1 cycle of homogenisation at a pressure of 50 MPa resulted in CNC with the smallest dimension, highest aspect ratio, moderate viscosity and exceptionally high zeta potential. Subsequently, 0.15% (CNC 0.15 -PE) and 0.30% (CNC 0.30 -PE) of CNC was used to stabilise oil-in-water emulsions and their stability was evaluated against different pH, temperature and ionic strength. All the CNC-stabilised emulsions demonstrated good thermal stability. CNC 0.30 -PE exhibited larger droplets but higher stability than CNC 0.15 -PE. In short, CNC with gel like structure has a promising potential to serve as a natural Pickering emulsifier to stabilise oil-in-water emulsion in various food applications."
https://openalex.org/W4293785954,"In landscapes where people and lions coexist, conflicts are common due to livestock predation and threats to human safety. Retaliatory lion killing by humans is often a consequence and is one of the leading causes of lion population declines across Africa. We assessed the effects of retaliatory lion killing on male lion coalitions in the Tarangire-Manyara Ecosystem (TME) using a long-term dataset of lion monitoring for ten lion prides, spanning over a fourteen year-period from 2004-2018. We also interviewed 214 respondents about their attitudes and awareness of the effects of retaliatory killing on lions. We found that male lion coalitions were larger and lasted for a longer tenure period in locations with low risk of retaliatory killing, as well as far away from active hunting blocks. Further, young people (18-35 years old) had a more positive attitude towards lion existence and conservation compared to older age classes. Surprisingly, people with primary or secondary level of education were more likely to having lions killed if they attack livestock compared to people with no formal education, although the former supported lion presence for tourism in protected areas. We conclude that retaliatory killing has a large effect on long-term lion coalition dynamics and, thus, survival. Community awareness on retaliation effect varies widely, and we recommend implementing better education and policy strategies at TME to protect the declining carnivore populations."
https://openalex.org/W4293786496,"The average body size of human prey animals in archaeological sites is influenced by myriad environmental, physiological and anthropogenic variables. When combined with supporting evidence, body size has the potential to provide a proxy for several variables of fundamental interest to archaeologists including climatic change, food availability and hunting impacts, among other things. In the southern Levant changes in mountain gazelle ( Gazella gazella ) body size in the Late Pleistocene were initially interpreted as evidence for a climatic downturn, but the picture has become increasingly murky as data has grown. Here we reconsider trends in gazelle body size using an updated dataset from the Mediterranean zone that spans the Early Epipaleolithic to the Middle Pre-Pottery Neolithic B period (ca. 24,000–9,500 cal BP). Our results reveal that gazelle were smallest in the Early and Middle Epipaleolithic (Kebaran and Geometric Kebaran), reached their largest size in the early Late Epipaleolithic (Early Natufian) and then shrunk slightly before stabilizing in size through the Middle Pre-Pottery Neolithic. We see no evidence that sex ratio, or climatic factors influenced this trend. Instead, we explore the role of human impacts on gazelle populations and their habitats as they grew in earnest at the beginning of the Late Epipaleolithic when people first began to settle into more permanent communities. Initially, in the Early and Late Natufian, anthropogenic impacts related to more intensive hunting and the increased footprint of more permanent settlements on the landscape. This may have pushed gazelle numbers below what could be supported by the environment, thus increasing the amount of food available for each animal and hence average body size. Later, as humans began to cultivate plants, manage animals and establish permanent villages, avoidance of humans and livestock by gazelle, and greater stability in food and water availability provided by agriculture, may have similarly reduced gazelle population size and intraspecific competition, thus allowing individual animals to grow larger on average."
https://openalex.org/W4293788781,"Hypothermia (HT) is a standard of care in the management of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HI). However, therapeutic mechanisms of HT are not well understood. We found that at the temperature of 32°C, isolated brain mitochondria exhibited significantly greater resistance to an opening of calcium-induced permeability transition pore (mPTP), compared to 37°C. Mitochondrial calcium buffering capacity (mCBC) was linearly and inversely dependent upon temperature (25°C-37°C). Importantly, at 37°C cyclosporine A did not increase mCBC, but significantly increased mCBC at lower temperature. Because mPTP contributes to reperfusion injury, we hypothesized that HT protects brain by improvement of mitochondrial tolerance to mPTP activation. Immediately after HI-insult, isolated brain mitochondria demonstrated very poor mCBC. At 30 minutes of reperfusion, in mice recovered under normothermia (NT) or HT, mCBC significantly improved. However, at four hours of reperfusion, only NT mice exhibited secondary decline of mCBC. HT-mice maintained their recovered mCBC and this was associated with significant neuroprotection. Direct inverted dependence of mCBC upon temperature in vitro and significantly increased mitochondrial resistance to mPTP activation after therapeutic HT ex vivo suggest that hypothermia-driven inhibition of calcium-induced mitochondrial mPTP activation mechanistically contributes to the neuroprotection associated with hypothermia."
https://openalex.org/W4293788821,"Previous studies have shown that spontaneously active cultured networks of cortical neuron grown planar microelectrode arrays are sensitive to radiofrequency (RF) fields and exhibit an inhibitory response more pronounced as the exposure time and power increase. To better understand the mechanism behind the observed effects, we aimed at identifying similarities and differences between the inhibitory effect of RF fields (continuous wave, 1800 MHz) to the γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA A ) receptor agonist muscimol (MU). Inhibition of the network bursting activity in response to RF exposure became apparent at an SAR level of 28.6 W/kg and co-occurred with an elevation of the culture medium temperature of ~1°C. Exposure to RF fields preferentially inhibits bursting over spiking activity and exerts fewer constraints on neural network bursting synchrony, differentiating it from a pharmacological inhibition with MU. Network rebound excitation, a phenomenon relying on the intrinsic properties of cortical neurons, was observed following the removal of tonic hyperpolarization after washout of MU but not in response to cessation of RF exposure. This implies that hyperpolarization is not the main driving force mediating the inhibitory effects of RF fields. At the level of single neurons, network inhibition induced by MU and RF fields occurred with reduced action potential (AP) half-width. As changes in AP waveform strongly influence efficacy of synaptic transmission, the narrowing effect on AP seen under RF exposure might contribute to reducing network bursting activity. By pointing only to a partial overlap between the inhibitory hallmarks of these two forms of inhibition, our data suggest that the inhibitory mechanisms of the action of RF fields differ from the ones mediated by the activation of GABA A receptors."
https://openalex.org/W4293784394,"High-resolution sediment analysis allowed us to identify two Middle Bronze Age (MBA 1, 1650–1550 cal a BCE) byre-houses at the waterlogged site of Oppeano “4D”, south of Verona (Veneto region, NE Italy). The site lies in a low-lying valley incised by the Adige River in its LGM alluvial fan. In this fluvio-palustrine environment burial and taphonomic conditions were such that the archaeological record was extremely well preserved. The wooden elements making up basal parts of nine ‘huts’ were in fact exposed at Oppeano, and so were their internal accretion deposits. These featured finely laminated dung units deriving from the stalling of small herbivores, possibly ovicaprids, intercalated with repeated accumulations of wood ash. This was produced in large and multi-stratified hearths that were exposed within each hut. Organic petrology provided evidence of the production of wood tar inside one of the studied structures. At Oppeano 4D it was thus demonstrated that these structures were not just byres or stables, but spaces that housed humans together with animals at least during some periods of the year, hence byre-houses. The identification of byre-houses in a Middle Bronze Age settlement is key for the reconstruction of socio-economic aspects of Bronze Age economy and production systems."

Research in this field contributes to the growing international literature on health-related quality-of-life instruments, but little is known about the links between the related variables. Thus, the scoping review this protocol refers to plans to examine the socio-economic consequences of older people's poor health on their economic conditions and their families. In particular, the main aims are: a) to map the main concepts that characterize the body of the reference literature; b) to identify conceptual gaps or unexplored research areas to be addressed; c) to illuminate the difficulties that affect a large number of families with older members to care for, with particular attention to the concept of socio-economic deprivation, which includes material living conditions as well as social aspects (e.g. in the form of loneliness experienced as a consequence of health disorders). This protocol paper fulfils the purpose of clarifying the planned methodological phases, including the sub-phases, and listing the techniques used. A three-step approach is being applied, consisting of: pre-planning phase, protocol phase, and conduction and reporting phase. The preliminary stages of the protocol design are part of a dedicated project within the Open Science Framework platform and included in a Research Square preprint. This proposed project will contribute to multidisciplinary research on the connections between ill health and poverty, and could support critical reflections on the current evidence and guide future policies to alleviate this double burden."
https://openalex.org/W4293785267,"Objectives Inter-arm blood pressure difference (IABPD) can lead to underdiagnosis and poor management of hypertension, when not recognized and are associated with increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. However, the prevalence and associated risk factors of IABPD in sub-Saharan Africa are unknown. This study aims to determine the prevalence and associated risk factors of IABPD among Tanve Health Study (TAHES) participants, a cohort about cardiovascular diseases in a rural area in Benin. Methods The cohort was conducted since 2015 among adults aged 25 years and over in Tanve village. Data were collected from February to March, 2020. Brachial blood pressure were recorded at rest on both arm with an electronic device. Systolic IABPD (sIABPD) was defined as the absolute value of the difference in systolic blood pressure between left and right arms ≥ 10 mmHg. A multivariate logistic regression models identified factors associated with sIABPD. Results A total of 1,505 participants (women 59%) were included. The mean age was 45.08 ±15.65 years. The prevalence of sIABPD ≥ 10 mmHg was 19% (95%CI: 17–21). It was 19% (95%CI: 16–22) in men and 20% (95%CI: 17–22) in women. In final multivariable model, the probability of sIABPD ≥ 10 mmHg increased significantly with age (adjusted OR (aOR) = 1.1; 95%CI: 1.02–1.20 per 10-years), hypertension (aOR = 2.33; 95%CI: 1.77–3.07) and diabetes (aOR = 1.96; 95%CI: 1.09–3.53). Conclusion Almost quarter of sample have a sIABPD ≥ 10 mmHg, with an increased risk with older age and hypertension and diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W4293785810,"Coastal ecosystems such as sand dunes, mangrove forests, and salt marshes provide natural storm protection for vulnerable shorelines. At the same time, storms erode and redistribute biological materials among coastal systems via wrack. Yet how such cross-ecosystem subsidies affect post-storm recovery is not well understood. Here, we report an experimental investigation into the effect of storm wrack on eco-geomorphological recovery of a coastal embryo dune in north-eastern Florida, USA, following hurricane Irma. We contrasted replicated 100-m 2 wrack-removal and unmanipulated (control) plots, measuring vegetation and geomorphological responses over 21 months. Relative to controls, grass cover was reduced 4-fold where diverse storm wrack, including seagrass rhizomes, seaweed, and wood, was removed. Wrack removal was also associated with a reduction in mean elevation, which persisted until the end of the experiment when removal plots had a 14% lower mean elevation than control plots. These results suggest that subsides of wrack re-distributed from other ecosystem types (e.g. seagrasses, macroalgae, uplands): i) enhances the growth of certain dune-building grasses; and ii) boosts the geomorphological recovery of coastal dunes. Our study also indicates that the practice of post-storm beach cleaning to remove wrack–a practice widespread outside of protected areas–may undermine the resilience of coastal dunes and their services."
https://openalex.org/W4293785812,"Background Prescribing cascades, where a medication is used to treat the side effect of another medication, contribute to polypharmacy and related morbidity. Little is known about clinicians’ and patients’ experiences with prescribing cascades. In this study, we explored why and how prescribing cascades occur across a variety of care settings and how they are managed. Methods and findings This descriptive qualitative study employed semi-structured interviews with older adults who may have experienced a prescribing cascade(s), their caregivers, and healthcare providers. Interviewees were recruited through physician referral from a Geriatric Day Hospital, two long-term care homes in Ottawa, Ontario, and through self-referral across Ontario, Canada. An inductive approach was used to code data and determine themes. Thirty-one interviews were conducted for ten unique patient cases. Some interviewees were involved in more than one case, resulting in 22 unique interviewees. Three themes were identified. First, recognition of prescribing cascades is linked to awareness of medication side effects. Second, investigation and management of prescribing cascades is simultaneous and iterative (rather than linear and sequential). Third, prevention of prescribing cascades requires intentional strategies to help people anticipate and recognize medication side effects. Difficulty with recruitment from both long-term care homes and through self-referral was the central limitation. This exemplifies challenges associated with studying a poorly recognized and underexplored phenomenon. Conclusions In order to better recognize, investigate and manage prescribing cascades, clinicians and patients need to know more about medication side effects; they need to ask ‘can this be caused by a drug?’ when signs and symptoms arise or worsen; and they need access to information about medication experiences to have benefit-risk discussions and make decisions about deprescribing. Approaches for raising public awareness of prescribing cascades should be trialed to raise the profile of this issue and facilitate continued exploration of the phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W4293787816,"Extreme rainfall causes transient ponding on roads, which increases the risk of vehicle accidents due to hydroplaning (HP), a phenomenon characterized by reduced friction between the pavement surface and the tires of moving vehicles. Before mitigation plans are drawn, it is important to first assess the spatio-temporal patterns of hydroplaning risk (HpR). This study quantifies HpR over the entire continental USA considering the coupled role of precipitation characteristics and pavement properties. Results show the southern United States to be a primary hotspot of HpR. About 22% of road sections experiencing HpR exhibit an increasing trend in the annual occurrence of HP events with time, indicating a riskier future ahead. Alarmingly, road sections that either experience higher HpR or increasing trend in annual occurrences of HP events are the ones with sizeable traffic. These results emphasize the need to prioritize HP-aware road design, traffic management, and signage in regions with high or fast-evolving risks."
https://openalex.org/W4293787833,"Background COVID-19 is spreading rapidly worldwide, and the population is generally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, especially those with cancer. Hence, our study aims to design a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis of the clinical characteristics and prognoses of lung cancer patients with COVID-19. Methods The protocol is prepared following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The literature will be searched in Embase, Pubmed, the Cochrane Library, LitCovid, and CNKI for potentially eligible articles. The quality of the articles will be used in the Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale (NOS) and Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Statistical analysis will be performed through RevMan 5 software. This review protocol has been registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022306866). Discussion To clarify whether COVID-19 affects the clinical symptoms and prognoses of lung cancer patients. Further study is needed to establish the best evidence-based for the management of lung cancer patients with COVID-19. Conclusion The definitive conclusion will be important to physicians effectively manage lung cancer patients with COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4293788017,"The racing industry is supported by a predominance of female stablehands and work riders, but few become professional jockeys. Female jockeys have recently had notable race success. No study has assessed whether the sex of the rider may subtly influence racehorse physiology to affect performance. Here, using a validated exercise tracking system (the ‘Equimetre’™) that records many physiological parameters simultaneously, this study characterised racehorse cardiovascular (heart rate, heart rate recovery) and biomechanical (stride length and frequency) parameters at various exercise intensities (slow canter to hard gallop) to address the question whether any parameter varied according to sex of the rider. A total of 530 Thoroughbreds, varying in age (2–7 years old) and sex (including geldings), from one racing yard in Australia, completed a total of 3,568 exercise sessions, monitored by a single trainer, on varying track surfaces (sand, turf, or fibre). Different work riders,103 in total (male, n = 66; female, n = 37) of which n = 43 were current or past registered professional jockeys, participated in the study. Data were analysed using analysis of variation (ANOVA) or mixed-effect models, as appropriate. Sex of the rider did not influence ( P &gt; 0.05) racehorse speed nor stride length at any training intensity. Racehorse heart rate and peak heart rate increased with training intensity (P &lt; .001), with no difference according to sex of rider ( P &gt; 0.05). Racehorse heart rate recovery was influenced by sex of the rider, but only at the extremes of the reversed, usual training intensity on each surface (e.g. heart rate after galloping on sand was significantly lower with male riders, P = 0.03). Finally, analysis of 52,464 race results indicated a similar chance of a top-three placing for male and female jockeys. In conclusion, this study, using objectively obtained data, demonstrates for the first time no overt effect of the rider’s sex on racehorse physiology in training and performance in racing. Such data could encourage greater female participation in racing and improve access of female jockeys to better quality mounts in racing events."
https://openalex.org/W4293788028,"African savannas are experiencing anthropogenically-induced stressors that are accelerating the increase of woody vegetation cover. To combat this, land managers frequently implement large-scale clearing of trees, which can have a cascading influence on mammalian herbivores. Studies rarely focus on how differences in woody cover influence the herbivore assemblage, making it difficult to assess how aggressive measures, or the lack of management, to counteract increasing woody cover affect the local composition and biodiversity of herbivores. We address this knowledge gap by applying a model-based clustering approach to field observations from MalaMala Game Reserve, South Africa to identify multiple herbivore–vegetation ‘configurations,’ defined as unique sets of herbivore assemblages (i.e., groups of herbivores) associated with differing woody plant covers. Our approach delineated how tree-clearing influences the distribution and abundance of the herbivore community in relation to surrounding savanna areas, which represent a natural mosaic of varying woody cover. Regardless of season, both intensively managed areas cleared of trees and unmanaged areas with high tree cover contained configurations that had depauperate assemblages of herbivores (low species richness, low abundance). By contrast, habitats with intermediate cover of woody vegetation had much higher richness and abundance. These results have substantial implications for managing African savannas in a rapidly changing climate."
https://openalex.org/W4293788283,"Many diseases and conditions can alter an ability to maintain body balance. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether thoracic surgery may elicit diaphragm dysfunction thereby impairing postural stability. 40 patients qualified to video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) lobectomy or lobectomy via thoracotomy due to pulmonary carcinoma were examined two times: a day before lung resection and 3–5 days after surgical procedure. Diaphragm assessment was performed using ultrasonography, while postural sways were evaluated by Zebris FDM-S stabilometric platform. Thoracic surgery was associated with decrease of diaphragm thickness and movement, as well as, with deterioration of static body balance maintenance. Upper lobe resection was linked with greater diaphragm excursion restriction and worse body sway parameters than middle and lower lobe resection. VATS lobectomy was associated with better postoperative diaphragm function and better postural sway parameters than lobectomy via thoracotomy. Patients after lobectomy via thoracotomy had significantly more load on lower limb on the operated side than patients after VATS lobectomy. Impairment of diaphragm function is closely associated with equilibrium impairment after pulmonary resection. VATS lobectomy was less invasive than lobectomy via thoracotomy in terms of primary respiratory muscle function and body balance maintenance parameters."
https://openalex.org/W4293788332,"Visual tracking is a fundamental research task in vision computer. It has broad application prospects, such as military defense and civil security. Visual tracking encounters many challenges in practical application, such as occlusion, fast motion and background clutter. Siamese based trackers achieve superior tracking performance in balanced accuracy and tracking speed. The deep feature extraction with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is an essential component in Siamese tracking framework. Although existing trackers take full advantage of deep feature information, the spatial structure and semantic information are not adequately exploited, which are helpful for enhancing target representations. The lack of these spatial and semantic information may lead to tracking drift. In this paper, we design a CNN feature extraction subnetwork based on a Depthwise Over-parameterized Convolutional layer (DO-Conv). A joint convolution method is introduced, namely the conventional and depthwise convolution. The depthwise convolution kernel explores independent channel information, which effectively extracts shallow spatial information and deep semantic information, and discards background information. Based on DO-Conv, we propose a novel tracking algorithm in Siamese framework (named DOSiam). Extensive experiments conducted on five benchmarks including OTB2015, VOT2016, VOT2018, GOT-10k and VOT2019-RGBT(TIR) show that the proposed DOSiam achieves leading tracking performance with real-time tracking speed at 60 FPS against state-of-the-art trackers."
https://openalex.org/W4293788561,"Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women have lower participation in Australia’s National Cervical Screening Program than other Australian women. Under-screened (including never screened) women’s voices are rarely heard in research evidence, despite being a priority group for interventions to increase cervical screening participation. This study aimed to describe under-screened Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women’s perspectives on cervical screening. Participants were 29 under-screened (women who had either never screened, had not screened in the previous five years or had recently screened in the past three months after more than five years) Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women from five communities across three states/territories. Female Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander researchers Yarned with women about why they did not participate in screening and how to improve screening. Yarning is an Indigenous qualitative research method in which relationships and trust facilitate culturally safe conversation. Transcripts were analysed thematically. The proportion of eligible women who screened within 30 days after the Yarn was calculated. We identified four themes describing how the harms outweighed the benefits of cervical screening for under-screened women. These were: 1) distress, discomfort, and trauma; 2) lack of privacy and control; 3) complicated relationships with health care providers (HCPs); and 4) pressured, insensitive, and/or culturally unsafe communication from HCPs. Under-screened women who had recently screened had maintained privacy and control through self-collection and had experienced trauma-informed and empathetic care from their HCPs. While we cannot unequivocally attribute women’s subsequent participation in screening to their involvement in this study, it is notable that one third of eligible under-screened women were screened within 30 days after the Yarn. Enhancing privacy, implementing trauma-informed approaches to care and sensitivity to the clinician-client relationship dynamics could enhance women’s sense of comfort in, and control over, the screening procedure. The opportunity to Yarn about cervical screening and self-collection may address these issues and support progress toward cervical cancer elimination in Australia."
https://openalex.org/W4293788649,"Background Genuine Chinese medicine is produced from medicinal plant cultivated in a specific region and is of better quality and efficacy, more consistently qualified and famous than that from the same medicinal plant cultivated in other regions. The cultivating region of genuine medicinal plant is known as the genuine producing area. Yangchun City, which is in Guangdong Province of China, is a genuine producing area for the famous Chinese medicine Amomi Fructus (also called Sharen). Amomi Fructus is the ripe and dry fruit of the Zingiberaceae plant A . villosum Lour.. A . villosum was introduced from the Persian Gulf region and has been cultivated in China for over 1000 years. Until now there are no reports on screening for good germplasm of A . villosum . Methods The contents of volatile oil and bornyl acetate of Amomi Fructus from 14 populations were determined with GC method, and the relative contents of the main chemical components in the volatile oils were determined with GC-MS method. Evaluation and variance analysis of the comprehensive quality of the 14 samples were conducted by means of a multi-indicator entropy-weight TOPSIS model (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution) combined with OPLS-DA (Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discrimination Analysis) and HCA (Hierarchical Clustering Analysis). The ISSR (Inter-Simple Sequence Repeat) molecular marker technique and the UPGMA (unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic means) were employed to analyze the genetic relationship among A . villosum populations. Results The contents of volatile oil and bornyl acetate differed significantly among the different populations, but the main chemical component in the volatile oil was the same in all the samples, which was bornyl acetate. OPLS-DA results showed that 9 indicators were the main factors influencing the quality differences among the 14 populations. The entropy-weight TOPSIS results showed that there were significant differences in the comprehensive qualities of the 12 populations from the genuine producing area. The best quality of fruit was found in the genuine producing area of Chunwan Town; the qualities of 33% of genuine fruits were lower than that of non-genuine fruits. Twenty-three DNA fragments were obtained by ISSR-PCR amplification using four ISSR primers, eleven of which were polymorphic loci, which accounted for 47.8%. The similarity coefficients (GS) of different populations of A . villosum ranged from 0.6087 to 0.9565. Conclusion There are significant differences among different populations of A . villosum in terms of the kinds of major chemical components and their contents, comprehensive quality and genetic diversity. The germplasm resources of A . villosum are rich in the genuine producing area. It means superior germplasm could be selected in the area. The comprehensive quality of the fruit of A . villosum from the non-genuine producing area is better than some of that from genuine producing area, proving that the non-genuine producing area can also produce Amomi Fructus with excellent quality."
https://openalex.org/W4293783717,"Background The burden of non-communicable diseases like diabetes and hypertension is increasing worldwide including low-and middle-income countries. Good knowledge of such diseases among young people will make them adopt a healthy lifestyle from an early age, which will, in turn, prevent them from developing such non-communicable diseases. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of rural and urban school students regarding diabetes and hypertension. We also aimed to see the differences in the knowledge, attitude, and practice of students from rural vs. urban communities. Methods A school-based cross-sectional study was conducted from May 1 2021 to June 30, 2021, in four schools in Nepal (1 from a metropolitan city, 2 from an urban municipality, and 1 from a rural municipality). The study was conducted among the secondary-level students of classes 9 and 10 in each school. The data were collected from the participants via pre-tested questionnaires and analyzed in the Statistical Packages for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20.0. Logistic regression analysis was carried out to determine the determinants of knowledge and attitude regarding diabetes and hypertension. Results Of 380 respondents, 35.5% were residents of metropolitan city, 37.4% were from the urban municipality and 27.1% were from the rural municipality. The mean age of respondents was 15.61±0.99 years and 51.1% were male. Respondents having a family history of diabetes and hypertension were 21.1% and 37.9% respectively. Respondents from the metropolitan city had significantly higher mean knowledge scores than the respondents from the urban and rural municipality (p&lt;0.001) while there was no significant difference in mean attitude scores. There was significantly higher daily consumption of fruits and vegetables among the participants from rural municipality (p&lt;0.01) while no significant difference was seen in salt consumption and time spent on physical activity. In univariate regression analysis, place of residence, family occupation, parental education, and family history of diabetes and hypertension were significantly associated with good knowledge level. In multivariate analysis, only a higher grade of study (grade 10 in comparison to grade 9) was an independent predictor of a student’s good attitude level. Conclusion In general, there was a good attitude towards diabetes and hypertension despite poor knowledge. The mean knowledge scores were lower in urban municipality and rural municipality compared to metropolitan city. Low knowledge scores on diabetes and hypertension among the students show an urgent need for school-based interventional programs focusing on non-communicable diseases and lifestyle modification with more emphasis on rural communities."
https://openalex.org/W4293784372,"Nonverbal communication with people who have physical disabilities is difficult. Eye-tracking technologies have recently been developed and applied to help people with physical disabilities in their communication. However, the eye-gaze patterns of people with severe motor dysfunction (SMD) have not been analyzed in detail. To clarify characterization of people with SMD, we aimed to develop gaze position-based evaluation metrics and analyze detailed eye-gaze patterns of people with SMD. We developed two new scoring metrics: (1) saliency score based on three saliency maps—spectral residual (SR), fine grained (FG), and motion (Mo); and (2) the distance score, which represents to what extent people can chase an object in a video. The evaluation was performed on 102 participants, consisting of 35 subjects with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities (PIMD; SMD with IQ &lt; 20), 19 with severe physical disabilities (SPD; SMD with IQ ≥ 20), and 48 healthy individuals. We observed that two saliency scores (SR and FG) and the distance score showed significant differences between the PIMD/SPD and healthy groups for the entire video, whereas Mo scores did not. Moreover, the distance score was analyzed separately for each scene, where scenes were categorized into three patterns—running, explanation, and hiding—according to the behavior of the moving objects. In the SPD and healthy groups, the explanation scenes accounted for the highest percentage of all scenes with the best distance score (63.6% and 61.9%, respectively), whereas in the PIMD group, the running scenes accounted for the highest percentage (54.5%). In conclusion, the new metrics were successful in quantitatively assessing the gaze responsiveness of people with SMD, which could not be assessed using a conventional metric, gaze-acquisition time. This study is expected to expand the possibilities of nonverbal communication using eye-tracking devices for people with SMD."
https://openalex.org/W4293785792,"Genotype-to-phenotype prediction is a central problem of human genetics. In recent years, it has become possible to construct complex predictive models for phenotypes, thanks to the availability of large genome data sets as well as efficient and scalable machine learning tools. In this paper, we make a threefold contribution to this problem. First, we ask if state-of-the-art nonlinear predictive models, such as boosted decision trees, can be more efficient for phenotype prediction than conventional linear models. We find that this is indeed the case if model features include a sufficiently rich set of covariates, but probably not otherwise. Second, we ask if the conventional selection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by genome wide association studies (GWAS) can be replaced by a more efficient procedure, taking into account information in previously selected SNPs. We propose such a procedure, based on a sequential feature importance estimation with decision trees, and show that this approach indeed produced informative SNP sets that are much more compact than when selected with GWAS. Finally, we show that the highest prediction accuracy can ultimately be achieved by ensembling individual linear and nonlinear models. To the best of our knowledge, for some of the phenotypes that we consider (asthma, hypothyroidism), our results are a new state-of-the-art."
https://openalex.org/W4293786834,"A generous welfare state decommodifies social relations and frees citizens from relying excessively on markets. We argue that decommodification is associated with population health in two ways: directly, as it provides better social protection to households and indirectly, as it mitigates health-damaging labour market polarization and reduces the incidence of labour market risks. Using time-series cross-sectional quantitative analysis for 21 OECD countries from 1971 to 2010, we observe a negative relationship between decommodification and the age-standardized death rate. We then analyze three correlates of decommodification—income redistribution, labour market polarization and the reduction of labour market risk incidence—and find that only the latter two are associated with population health. Higher labour market polarization, measured by the share of market income allocated to the richest decile relative to the share of the poorest decile, is associated with a higher death rate. A new measure of risk reduction, the degree to which the welfare state reduces the prevalence of large income losses, is also associated with lower death rates, especially for men. Welfare state decommodification thus contributes to population health directly, and indirectly, via the attenuation of labour market polarization and the mitigation of labour market risks."
https://openalex.org/W4293787091,"The use of social networking sites (SNS or social media) often comes with strong self-centered behaviors to promote self-appearance. The relationship between narcissism and social media use has intensively occupied scholars in the last decade, yet not much research has focused on, first, how the intensity of social media use (SNS use) is associated with narcissism through a self-centered appearance focused use of these SNS; and second, whether these associations are moderated or not by cultural differences of the country of origin in such a critical age of personality formation and (global) culturalization as the transition from pre-adolescence to adolescence. We performed a correlation and mediation analysis on a cross-sectional survey among Austrian, Belgian, Spanish, and South Korean adolescents ( n = 1,983; M age 14.41, 50.3% boys) examining the adolescents’ daily usage of social media, their self-centered appearance focused behavior, and the reported narcissism. Findings show that a self-centered appearance focused use of SNS (SCA) moderates the association between SNS use and narcissism, especially for males from the three European countries. We have also particularly found that the years of use, number of friends and time spent in FB are associated with narcissism. Since SCA is defined in the study as narcissistic behavior in SNS, we argue that social media are part of the socialization process as both reinforcers and catalyzers of narcissism."
https://openalex.org/W4293787836,"Coral reefs are rare in the Galapagos and there is concern that, like in many areas around the world, they may be degrading due to increasing anthropogenic pressure, which can cause changes and reorganizations of structure and function with associated phase shifts. Algae of the genus Caulerpa J.V. Lamouroux, 1809 are known as widespread and persistent marine invaders. They grow rapidly, particularly in disturbed areas where they can opportunistically monopolize substratum and compete with native species, thus reducing biodiversity. Caulerpa chemnitzia increased in abundance and overgrew corals on the reef since 2012, ultimately raising fears that a phase-shift from coral to algae might be imminent. However, from 2019 onwards algae populations strongly contracted and while not having returned to baseline level, there is currently low risk of corals being displaced. Visual censuses were conducted on a yearly basis since 2004 using sample quadrats (0.5 x 0.5m) every 5 m along a 50-m-long transects at a depth of 6–15 m at 5 permanent subtidal ecological monitoring sites around Darwin. In addition, 10 m photo-transects were taken using a graduated meter-long measuring stick in the centre of the frame in 2012, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2021 at a depth of 15m at Wellington reef. The authors hypothesize that this species could have expanded its distribution over Wellington Reef because of its known morphological plasticity due to a response to change in the environment, in this case high temperature and low nutrients. As ENSO events are predicted to increase in intensity and frequency due to the impact of climate change it is important to develop and implement a functional alert system. Early Detection Rapid Response (EDRR) protocols are recommended to avoid climate driven Non-Indigenous Species (NIS) entering the GMR or for native species becoming invasive due to warming-related phase shifts."
https://openalex.org/W4293788033,"In Jordan, cancer is the second leading cause of death after cardiac disease. The impact of cancer on sexual relationships is a taboo subject and hence, such issues are underreported research among Jordanian people examining unmet needs.To examine the experiences and preferences of Jordanian cancer survivors related to communication regarding their sexual needs.Qualitative study conducted between May and June 2020 using semi-structured face-to-face interviews using the snow-balling approach for recruitment. Participants were recruited until data saturation was obtained and data were analyzed using qualitative thematic analysis.Analysis of participants' interview data identified three main categories: 1) The psychological impact of cancer of sexual relationships; 2) Physician support; 3) Variations in sexual life and sexual experiences.The study revealed that there is a substantial psychological impact of cancer on sexual relationships among Arab Jordanian cancer survivors. Feeling powerless, being labelled as 'sexually disabled', and lack of communication with physicians were emphasized by participants as a barrier to discuss sexual needs with their physicians. Lack of physicians support negatively impact Jordanian cancer survivors sexual experience and led to increased their sense of powerlessness and loss of control over sexual relationships.Overall, the study indicated a crucial need for physicians to encourage patients to disclose their sexual experience to help them maintain their sexual and mental health while in the fight against cancer. The physicians, nurses and allied health professionals should be engaged in the conversation with patients by taking an active role in the discussion. Additionally, the family and partners of the patients should also be approached and engaged by health professionals in the discussion to address their needs or sexual issues."
https://openalex.org/W4293788209,"Flu disease, with high mortality and morbidity, is caused by the influenza virus. Influenza infections are most effectively prevented through vaccination, but it requires annual reformulation due to the antigenic shift or drift of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins. Increasing resistance to available anti-influenza drugs was also recently reported. The M2 surface protein of the influenza virus is an attractive target for universal vaccine development as it is highly conserved and multifunctional throughout the viral life cycle. This study aimed to discover a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) targeting the M2 protein of influenza A H1N1/PR8, showing neutralizing activity through plaque inhibition in virus replication. Several candidates were isolated using bio-panning, including scFv and single-domain V L target M2 protein, which was displayed on the yeast surface. The scFv/V L proteins were obtained with high yield and high purity through soluble expression in E . coli BL21 (DE3) pLysE strains. A single-domain V L -M2-specific antibody, NVLM10, exhibited the highest binding affinity to influenza virions and was engineered into a bivalent format (NVL2M10) to improve antigen binding. Both antibodies inhibited virus replication in a dose-dependent manner, determined using plaque reduction- and immunocytochemistry assays. Furthermore, bivalent anti-M2 single-domain V L antibodies significantly reduced the plaque number and viral HA protein intensity as well as viral genome ( HA and NP ) compared to the monovalent single-domain V L antibodies. This suggests that mono- or bivalent single-domain V L antibodies can exhibit neutralizing activity against influenza virus A, as determined through binding to virus particle activity."

Here we demonstrate that TMPRSS6 isoforms 3 and 4 reduce the proteolytic activity of isoform 2 and uncover the ability of isoforms to interact. Moreover, we identified 49 potential protein partners common to TMPRSS6 isoforms, including TfR1, known to be involved in iron regulation. By co-expressing TMPRSS6 and TfR1, we show that TfR1 is cleaved and shed from the cell surface. Further, we demonstrate that TMPRSS6 isoforms 3 and 4 behave as dominant negative."
https://openalex.org/W4293788406,"Posttraumatic Stress Disorder continues to be a highly stigmatized disease for the veteran population and stigma, experienced as a mark of discredit or shame, continues to be identified as the main deterrent in treatment seeking. Little attention has been paid to how the process of obtaining service-connected disability status can amplify veterans’ perceptions of being stigmatized. The following ethnographic study identified how combat veterans experienced stigma in processing through Veterans Affairs care and the effects of linking a Posttraumatic Stress Disorder diagnosis with disability compensation. Stigma was identified in two inter-related areas: 1) the structural level in the Veterans Affairs disability claims process and 2) the individual level in interactions with Veterans Affairs service providers. Findings based on veterans’ narratives suggest that the disability claims process, requiring multiple repetitions of personal trauma, coupled with perceptions of institutional stigmas of malingering, created bureaugenic effects : a worsening of symptoms caused by bureaucratic protocols intended to help veterans. This process influenced first time treatment users of the Veterans Affairs by deterring treatment-seeking behavior but was not found to affect veterans who had already initiated treatment. Despite the experience of stigma and commodification of their suffering through disability and diagnostic screening, veterans still sought disability compensation. Veterans viewed this compensation as acknowledgment of their loss and validation of their sacrifice."

We derived five profiles of individuals using cognitive, behavioral, and familial factors relating to suicidal ideation risk factors. Participants (n = 1,142) were assessed at age 8 using the Laboratory Temperament Assessment Battery and mother-reported parenting measures and at age 14 using interviews about clinical symptoms and suicidal ideation. The best-fitting model included five profiles: typical, elevated adolescent symptomology, mildly elevated typical, low childhood persistence, and very low childhood persistence/mixed symptoms. Participants in the elevated adolescent symptomology and very low childhood persistence/mixed symptoms profiles were 2.6 and 5.3 times more likely to report suicidal ideation compared with the typical profile. Overall, our results underscore how using a person-centered pattern recognition approach and incorporating facets of childhood behavior may enhance conceptualizations of adolescent suicidal ideation risk."

In this paper, the effects of various environmental factors on the growth and development of H . marmoreus were investigated by measuring the enzyme activities of H . marmoreus at different growth stages under different microenvironment conditions in the mushroom room, so as to confirm the influence mechanism of environmental factors on the growth of H . marmoreus . The results showed that at budding stage xylanase and laccase were found significantly positively correlated with CO 2 concentration and light intensity, and dramatically negatively correlated with humidity while carboxymethyl cellulose and manganese peroxidase were markedly positively correlated with humidity, and significantly negatively correlated with CO 2 concentration and light intensity. On the other hand, in mature fruit bodies xylanase activity was found significantly positively correlated with CO 2 concentration and light intensity, and dramatically negatively correlated with humidity while manganese peroxidase activities were found significantly positively correlated with humidity, and dramatically negatively correlated with light intensity. The activity of β-glucosidase in budding and mature fruiting bodies was markedly negatively correlated with CO 2 concentration and significantly positively correlated with humidity."
