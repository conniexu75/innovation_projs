https://openalex.org/W2077365895,"The two-pore (2P) domain K+channels TREK-1 and TRAAK are opened by membrane stretch as well as arachidonic acid (AA) (Patel, A.

We demonstrate that lysophospholipids (LPs) and platelet-activating factor also produce large specific and reversible activations of TREK-1 and TRAAK. LPs activation is a function of the size of the polar head and length of the acyl chain but is independent of the charge of the molecule. Bath application of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) immediately opens TREK-1 and TRAAK in the cell-attached patch configuration. In excised patches, LPC activation is lost, whereas AA still produces maximal opening. The carboxyl-terminal region of TREK-1, but not the amino terminus and the extracellular loop M1P1, is critically required for LPC activation. LPC activation is indirect and may possibly involve a cytosolic factor, whereas AA directly interacts with either the channel proteins or the bilayer and mimics stretch. Opening of TREK-1 and TRAAK by fatty acids and LPs may be an important switch in the regulation of synaptic function and may also play a protective role during ischemia and inflammation.

Although these subunits share the same structural motif with four transmembrane segments, 2P domains, an extended M1P1 external loop (60–70 residues), and both amino and carboxyl termini intracellularly, they only share 25–50% identity. TWIK-1 and TWIK-2 encode weak inward rectifiers that are inhibited by internal acidosis but stimulated by protein kinase C activation (7.Lesage F. Guillemare E. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M.

The second pore region P2 of the nonexpressing mouse KCNK6 is characterized by a GLG motif identical to that found in TWIK channels and different from the GFG sequence found in other 2P domain K+ channels (8.Salinas M.

TASK-1 and TASK-2 encode background outward rectifiers that are constitutively active at all voltages and inhibited by mild external acidosis near the physiological pH (5.Duprat F. Lesage F. Fink M.

Finally, TREK-1 and TRAAK are outward rectifier K+channels opened by membrane stretch, cell swelling, and shear stress (1.Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M.

At atmospheric pressure, basal activity is negligible, and channels are opened by convex curvature of the plasma membrane (3.Maingret F. Fosset M. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honoré E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1381-1387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Mechano-gating does not require the integrity of the cytoskeleton, and the activating force is apparently directly coming from the bilayer (3.Maingret F. Fosset M. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honoré E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1381-1387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Mechanical activation of TREK-1 and TRAAK is mimicked by polyunsaturated fatty acids such as arachidonic acid (AA) and by the anionic amphipath trinitrophenol (1.Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3297-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that TREK-1, but not TRAAK, is also opened by inhalational anesthetics including chloroform, ether, halothane, and isoflurane as well as by mild intracellular acidosis (2.Maingret F.

Romey G. Lazdunski M. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). In mouse tissues, TREK-1 is ubiquitous, with strong expression in brain and heart, whereas mouse TRAAK is restricted to the central nervous system, the spinal cord, and the retina (4.Fink M.

Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6854-6862Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). In human tissues, TREK-1 is at low level or even absent from heart, whereas TRAAK is also detected in the placenta, testis, prostate, and small intestine (13.Patel A.J. Honoré E. Lesage F. Fink M. Romey G. Lazdunski M. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). In the present report, we demonstrate that extracellular LPs as well as PAF mimic the effect of stretch and are potent openers of the neuronal 2P domain K+channels TREK-1 and TRAAK. COS cell culture, transfection, site-directed mutagenesis and electrophysiology procedures have been extensively described elsewhere (1.Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F.

The 2P domain K+ channel cDNAs were subcloned into the pIRES-CD8 vector and transfected using the DEAE-dextran procedure. Cells were visualized 48 h after transfection using the anti-CD8 antibody-coated bead method. For whole-cell experiments, bath solution (EXT) contained 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4 with NaOH, and pipette solution (INT) contained 150 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA and 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2 with KOH. For cell attached and inside-out experiments, the bath solution was INT, and the pipette contained EXT solution (5 mm KCl). All chemicals were obtained from Sigma except ginkolide B, trans-1,3-dioxolane, lyso-PAF, methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate, 7,7-dimethyleicosadienoic acid, and RHC-80267 were obtained from Biomol. Stock solutions were kept at −20 °C and renewed weekly. AA and arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone were dissolved in ethanol at the concentration of 100 mm. Saturated fatty acids, PAF, lyso-PAF, and PAF receptor antagonists ginkolide B and trans-1,3-dioxolane were dissolved at the concentration of 10 mm in ethanol. LPCs, LPA, LPI, choline, and Gd3+ were dissolved in water at the concentration of 10 mm. LPS and LPE were either dissolved at the concentration of 10 mm in 75% methanol or in a mixture of 70% chloroform, 27% methanol, 3% water. PC was dissolved at a concentration of 30 mm in ethanol. Chlorpromazine was dissolved at the concentration of 10 mm in 10% ethanol. Amiloride was dissolved at the concentration of 1 mm in saline. Phospholipase A2 antagonists 7,7-dimethyleicosadienoic acid, methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate, bromophenacylbromide, and diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor RHC-80267 were dissolved in Me2SO at concentrations of 100 mm. GTPγs was dissolved in saline at the concentration of 100 μm. Cytochalasin D was dissolved at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in Me2SO. Colchicine was dissolved in saline at the concentration of 0.5 mm. Polymerase chain reaction was used to generate amino-terminal deletions in TREK-1 by introducing a methionine just before Val-47. A carboxyl terminus deletion was generated by introducing a stop codon at Gly-308. The external loop M1P1 of mouse TREK-1 (amino acids 68–135) was substituted with the loop of human TASK-1 (amino acids 30–85). For whole-cell recordings, values of control currents were subtracted from the currents recorded in the presence of the various lipids. Results are presented as means of density current associated with their standard errors (S.E.). Cell capacitance was determined by hyperpolarization pulses of 10 mV from a holding potential of −80 mV. The number of experiments are indicated on each graph. The biophysical and pharmacological properties of TREK-1 were investigated in transiently transfected COS cells. Cells expressing TREK-1 were voltage-clamped at 0 mV in the whole-cell patch clamp configuration, and lipids were applied in the bath as illustrated in Fig. 1 A. As previously reported, TREK-1 was activated by polyunsaturated fatty acids including AA (10 μm) (Fig. 1 A) (1.Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Similarly, 3 μm LPC (C14:0) opened TREK-1 and induced a strong outward current (Fig. 1 A). Onset and offset kinetics for LPC activation were fast compared with AA (Fig. 1 B). In physiological K+ conditions, the LPC-induced current displayed an outward-going rectification and reversed at −81 ± 3 mV (n = 6) (Fig. 1 C). In symmetrical K+ conditions, the reversal potential was shifted to 0 mV, as expected for a K+-selective channel, and rectification was maintained (Fig. 1 D). Activation of TREK-1 was dose-dependent, with a threshold concentration of 30 nm (Fig. 1 E). Concentrations higher than 10 μm could not be tested since they produce irreversible cell leakage. Current stimulation was stable during continuous application of LPC up to 15 min (not shown). 10 μmLPC had no significant effect on mock-transfected or TASK-1- or TASK-2-expressing cells (Fig. 1 F). LPC (C18:1), lyso-PAF (C16:0), and PAF (C16:0) at the concentration of 10 μm induced a comparable stimulation of both TREK-1 and TRAAK (Fig. 2). The phospholipid PC, which contains two acyl chains (C18:0 or C18:1), and LPA, (C18:1), which lacks the head group, were ineffective on both channels at 10 μm (Fig. 2). Choline (100 μm;n = 7) as well as saturated fatty acids (10 μm) including myristate (C14:0), palmitate (C16:0), stearate (C18:0), and arachidate (C20:0) had no effect on TREK-1 and TRAAK (n = 6; data not shown). The PAF (C16:0) dose-effect curve was similar to that of LPC (C14:0), and the threshold concentration was 30 nm (Fig. 2 C,inset). In Fig. 3,A–B, we examined the effect of four LPs with different polar heads (ethanolamine, serine, choline, and inositol) and comparable acyl chains (C16:0-C18:0). LPI and LPS are negatively charged, whereas LPC and LPE are neutral. LPE and LPS only weakly activated TREK-1 and TRAAK, whereas LPC and LPI produced strong activations (Fig. 3 B). The activation of TREK-1 and TRAAK by LPC was also critically dependent on the length of the acyl chain (Fig.3, C–D). C6:0 and C10:0 LPC were only weakly effective, whereas C14:0 and C18:0 LPC were strong openers of TREK-1 and TRAAK (Fig. 3 D). Both saturated and unsaturated LPC long acyl chains (C18:0 and C18:1) were equally effective (Fig. 3 D). Simultaneous application of LPC and AA produced reversible and additive opening of TREK-1 (Fig. 4).Figure 3LPs with large polar heads and long hydrophobic acyl chains open TREK-1 and TRAAK.

Interestingly, chlorpromazine had no effect on TRAAK (n = 6) (not shown). Blockers of stretch-sensitive channels such as amiloride (2 mm) and Gd3+ (10 μm) (14.Hamill O.P. McBride Jr., D. Pharmacol. Rev. 1996; 48: 231-252PubMed Google Scholar) similarly reduced LPC stimulation of TREK-1 and TRAAK (Fig. 5,B–C) (n = 6). Basal TREK-1 activity, unlike TRAAK, was inhibited by protein kinase A and protein kinase C stimulation (1.Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M.

Similarly, activation of TREK-1 by LPC was rapidly reversed by 500 μm 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP (n = 5) and 400 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate addition (n = 3) (Fig.6). Protein kinase A-mediated inhibition was slowly reversible over a 30-min wash, whereas protein kinase C inhibition was completely irreversible (Fig. 6).Figure 6Protein kinase A and protein kinase C activation reverse LPC activation of TREK-1.

The time between applications is indicated between recordings. B, 400 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) inhibited the opening of TREK-1 by 3 μm LPC. The holding potential was 0 mV, and LPC, PMA, as well as cAMP applications are indicated by horizontal lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Fig. 7 A shows that LPC added to the bath rapidly activated TREK-1 channels in the cell-attached patch configuration. In comparison, AA in the same configuration was weakly active and required several minutes of application to open the channels isolated by the patch pipette (Fig. 7 A). In the excised inside-out patch configuration, LPC decreased basal activity, whereas AA reversibly and strongly opened TREK-1 (Fig. 7 B). Moreover, intracellular LPC application reversed the opening induced by internal AA in the inside-out patch configuration (Fig. 7 C). In the outside-out patch configuration, LPC was only very weakly effective, whereas AA fully activated TREK-1 (Fig. 7 D). Similar results were obtained with TRAAK (not shown). LPC activation of TREK-1 and TRAAK in the whole cell configuration was insensitive to the PAF receptor antagonists ginkolide B (10 μm; n = 4) and trans-1,3-dioxolane (10 μm; n = 4), to the phospholipase A2 inhibitors arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (30 μm; n = 5), bromophenacylbromide (100 μm; n = 5), 7,7-dimethyleicosadienoic acid (15 μm; n = 5), and methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate (15 μm; n = 5), and to the diacylglycerol lipase inhibitor RHC-80267 (30 μm; n = 12). In the outside-out patch configurations, intracellular ATP (5 mm; n= 3) and GTP (1 mm; n = 7) did not affect LPC activation. In the inside-out patch configuration, the addition of intracellular GTPγs (100 μm; n = 3) or intracellular calcium (3 μm free calcium;n = 7) did not open channels. Cells treated for 8 h with the cytoskeleton-disrupting agents colchicine (500 μm) and cytochalasine D (3 μg/ml) displayed a similar sensitivity to LPC compared with control cells (n = 6). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to investigate the respective role of amino and carboxyl termini as well as the external M1P1 loop in TREK-1 channel activation by LPC as well as AA (Fig.8). Deletion of the amino terminus and exchange of external loops between TREK-1 and TASK-1 had no effect on AA and LPC activation (Fig. 8 B). However, partial deletion of the TREK-1 carboxyl terminus strongly reduced both AA and LPC activation (Fig. 8 B). TREK-1 and TRAAK were opened by various lipids including polyunsaturated FAs, LPs, and PAF. Previous reports have suggested that lipids, independently of their metabolic conversion, may directly modulate stretch-sensitive ion channel function by either interacting with the channel protein or by partitioning into the bilayer (1.Patel A.J.

Micromolar concentrations of AA open TREK-1 and TRAAK with onset and offset kinetics that are in the order of minutes (Refs. 1.Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F.

The relatively low affinity of AA for channel activation as well as the slow kinetics suggest that the accessibility to the “AA site” is limited. Insertion of FAs in the membrane may be required to directly reach the active site of the channel protein or may alter fluidity, tension, curvature, or phospholipid-channel interaction, which in turn may open the mechano-gated ion channels (1.Patel A.J.

We have previously demonstrated that the anionic amphipath trinitrophenol mimics the effect of AA and opens TREK-1 and TRAAK channels (1.Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F.

These results were interpreted qualitatively on the basis of the bilayer couple hypothesis, assuming that the mechanosensitivity derives entirely from interactions within the bilayer and is independent of the cytoskeleton (1.Patel A.J.

Anionic amphipaths would preferentially insert in the outer leaflet (because of the natural asymmetric distribution of negative charges in the inner leaflet) and generate a convex curvature of the membrane that would open TREK-1 and TRAAK (1.Patel A.J. Honoré E. Maingret F. Lesage F. Fink M. Duprat F. Lazdunski M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4283-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar, 3.Maingret F. Fosset M. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honoré E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1381-1387Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Both TREK-1 and TRAAK are also opened by neutral amphipaths such as LPC, lyso-PAF, and PAF. The interpretation based on the bilayer couple model may thus be challenged as neutral amphipaths (such as LPC), which may distribute evenly at equilibrium in both leaflets, also mimic the effect of negatively charged compounds and open TREK-1 and TRAAK. An alternative hypothesis is to consider the shape rather than the charge of the molecule (15.Andersen O.S. Nielsen C. Maer A.M. Lundbaek J.A. Goulian M. Koeppe R.N. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 208-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 16.Casado M. Ascher P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 513: 317-330Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 21.Lundbaek J.A. Andersen O.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 645-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). LPC has a large polar head with a diameter of about 5.2 nm and a thin hydrophobic acyl chain tail with a cross-section estimated to be 1.8–2.0 nm and can be pictured as a cone with its base at the polar interface (29.Pascher I. Lundmark M. Nyholm P.G. Sundell S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1113: 339-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 30.Cullis P.R. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1977; 470: 185-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). Hydration of the polar head will also contribute to increase the conic shape of the molecule. Compounds with a small polar head and a large hydrophobic tail such as AA are considered as inverted cones with the base of the cone at its hydrophobic tail (30.Cullis P.R. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 559: 399-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar, 31.Chernomordik L.V. Melikyan G.B. Chizmadzhev Y.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1977; 470: 185-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). The cone shape hypothesis assumes that amphipaths distribute mainly in a single layer that is deformed in opposite directions by cone (LPC)- and inverted-cone (AA)-shaped lipids (16.Casado M. Ascher P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 513: 317-330Crossref Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 21.Lundbaek J.A. Andersen O.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 104: 645-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 30.Cullis P.R. de Kruijff B. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 1977; 470: 185-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar). This hypothesis also implies that the potency of cones is proportional to the size of the polar head rather than their charge. LPI and LPC (large head groups) are much more potent openers of TREK-1 and TRAAK than LPE and LPS (small head groups). LPC is neutral, whereas LPI is negatively charged, demonstrating that the effect of LPs is independent of the charge of the molecule. Therefore, the structural requirements for effective activations seem to be the presence of a large head group independently of its charge and a sufficiently hydrophobic domain. The data are apparently in favor of the cone shape hypothesis for LPs, but this hypothesis does not account for activation of TREK-1 and TRAAK by inverted cones such as AA. In the cell-attached patch configuration, channel opening is induced within seconds when LPC is added to the bath outside of the patch pipette. However, patch excision produces a loss of channel activation by LPC, whereas AA is still able to maximally open channels. The loss of LPC activation after excision suggests the existence of a cytosolic factor, which may be involved in channel regulation. Channel activation by LPs is insensitive to PAF receptor antagonists and is not mimicked by LPA application, ruling out the eventual role of PAF and LPA receptors. External application of large size polar head cone-shaped LPs may release a cytosolic factor by either directly activating putative LPs membrane receptor(s) or may indirectly affect membrane properties, thus activating a membrane-bound mechano-sensitive effector. Inhibition of AA releasing enzymes phospholipase A2 and diacylglycerol lipase has no effect on LPC activation. The identity and the mechanism of release of the possible cytosolic factor, which may, similarly to AA, directly interact with the channels or affect membrane curvature, remain to be determined. Deletional analysis indicates that the carboxyl terminus, but not the amino terminus and the external loop of TREK-1, is critical for LPC and AA activation. The same region was previously found to be important for stretch activation (2.Maingret F. Patel A.J. Lesage F. Lazdunski M. Honoré E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26691-26696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). The present data indicate that LPC activation requires the entire carboxyl terminus of TREK-1 and, thus, may involve the mechanosensitivity of the channel. During brain (and heart) ischemia two distinct phospholipase A2 enzymes are at work. First, cytosolic phospholipase A2 enzymes release FAs from phospholipids and, thus, generate massive amounts of intracellular LPs (for review, see Refs.33.Bonventre J.V. J. Lipid Med. Cell Signal. 1997; 16: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 34.Bazan N.G. Allan G. J. Lipid Med. Cell Signal. 1996; 14: 321-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Second, secretory phospholipase A2-type II expression is rapidly induced, as it is also in endotoxic shock (35.Lauritzen I. Heurteaux C. Lazdunski M. Brain Res. 1994; 651: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The action of secretory phospholipase A2 enzymes would produce external LPC, which would open TREK-1 and TRAAK channels, whereas activation of the cytosolic phospholipase A2 would produce internal LPC, which would close the channels and reverse AA activation. These results suggest that secretory (external LPs) and cytosolic phospholipase A2 (internal LPs) might differentially regulate TREK-1 and TRAAK opening. Cell swelling (opener of TREK-1 and TRAAK) and intracellular acidosis (opener of TREK-1) occurring during ischemia will produce further opening of TREK 1 and TRAAK. Hyperpolarization via TREK-1 and TRAAK activation would tend to reduce Ca2+ influx via voltage-gated Ca2+channels by setting the membrane potential to values below the voltage threshold for activation. Similarly, hyperpolarization is expected to reduce Ca2+ influx via theN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor-associated Ca2+-permeable channel by promoting blockade by Mg2+. Opening of the mechano-gated FAs/LPs/PAF-sensitive TREK-1 and TRAAK K+ channels during ischemia may thus have an important neuro-protective effect. We thank M. Jodar and V. Lopez for excellent technical assistance."

While numerous members of the FGF family have been discovered, the IL-1 family has remained small and outnumbered by IL-1 receptor homologues. From expressed sequence tag data base searches, we have now identified four additional IL-1 homologues, IL-1H1, IL-1H2, IL-1H3, and IL-1H4. Like most other IL-1/FGFs, these proteins do not contain a hydrophobic leader sequence. IL-1H4 has a propeptide sequence, while IL-1H1, IL-1H2, and IL-1H3 encode only the mature protein. Circular dichroism spectra and thermal stability analysis suggest that IL-1H1 folds similarly to IL-1ra. The novel homologues are not widely expressed in mammals. IL-1H1 is constitutively expressed only in placenta and the squamous epithelium of the esophagus. However, IL-1H1 could be inducedin vitro in keratinocytes by interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α and in vivo via a contact hypersensitivity reaction or herpes simplex virus infection. This suggests that IL-1H1 may be involved in pathogenesis of immune mediated disease processes.

With a few exceptions, most IL-1/FGFs are synthesized as intracellular proteins without a characteristic hydrophobic leader peptide but nevertheless are released from cells and act on target cells by binding and signaling through cell surface receptors. In some cases, such as IL-1β and IL-18, proteolytic cleavage of a precursor form of the protein is required for elaboration of the active form of the ligand (10.Hazuda D. Webb R.L. Simon P. Young P.

The IL-1 and FGF receptors also share structural homology in their extracellular ligand binding domain, since they both consist of multiple immunoglobulin-like repeats (3.Vigers G.P.A. Anderson L.J.

Gene (Amst.). 1999; 230: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and this appears to lead to a similar mode of ligand recognition (15.Plotnikov A.N. Schlessinger J. Hubbard S.R. Mohammadi M. Cell. 1999; 98: 641-650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). While the overall folds of the ligands and receptor extracellular domains have been maintained evolutionarily, the family has evolved into two distinct arms, the IL-1s and the FGFs, which show no significant sequence homology and have distinct biological properties. The limited sequence homology is also seen between IL-1 family members and results from the small number of internal residues required to maintain the β-barrel structure and the extensive use of backbone elements in receptor recognition (3.Vigers G.P.A. Anderson L.J. Caffes P. Brandhuber B.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 4.Schreuder H. Tardif C. Trump-Kallmeyer S. Soffientini A., E., S. Akeson A. Bowlin T. Yanofsky S. Barrett R.W. Nature. 1997; 386: 194-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The distinction in biological activities reflects differences in the intracellular regions of their cognate receptors. The FGF receptors encode a tyrosine kinase within the intracellular domain that is stimulated upon ligand binding and initiates a signaling cascade that results in cell proliferation. This contributes to their role in stimulating tissue growth during development and repair. In contrast, the IL-1 receptors do not encode any enzymatic activity in their intracellular domains, but upon ligand binding, they recruit two serine/threonine protein kinases, the interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases, through motifs shared with the highly evolutionarily conserved toll receptor family (16.Rock F.L. Hardiman G. Timans J.C. Kastelein R.A. Bazan J.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 588-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). These stimulate intracellular signaling pathways, leading to the activation of NF-κB and AP-1 transcription factors (17.O'Neill L.A. Greene C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 18.Auron P.E. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1998; 9: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) that in turn induce genes involved in the initiation of immune and inflammatory responses. Thus, IL-1α and -β stimulate the production of chemokines, cytokines, and adhesion molecules that serve to recruit leukocytes to sites of infection or injury and initiate an inflammatory response. IL-18 stimulates the production of TH1 helper T cells resulting in a cell-mediated immune response that can lead to cancer immunity and delayed type hypersensitivity responses (19.Okamura H. Tsutsui H. Komatsu T. Yutsudo M. Hakura A. Tanimoto T. Torigoe K. Okura T. Nukuda Y. Hattori K. Akita K. Namba M. Tanabe F. Konishi K. Fukuda S. Kurimoto M. Nature. 1995; 378: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar). IL-1s activate their target receptors by bringing together two different receptor subunits. IL-1α and IL-1β bind with subnanomolar affinity to the cell surface type I IL-1R and recruit IL-1R accessory protein in order to stimulate target cells (17.O'Neill L.A. Greene C. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1998; 63: 650-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Similarly, IL-18 binds to the IL-18 receptor (IL1rrp) with 20 nm affinity and recruits the IL-18R accessory protein (20.Torigoe K. Ushio S. Okura T. Kobayashi S. Taniai M. Kunikata T. Murakami T.

The activity of both IL-1 and IL-18 is modulated by the soluble or membrane-bound decoy receptors, IL-1R type II and IL-18BP, respectively (22.McMahan C.J. Slack J.L. Mosley B. Cosman D. Lupton S.D.

IL-1 activity is also moderated by the presence of a natural receptor antagonist, IL-1ra, which binds to the type I IL-1R but does not recruit IL-1RAcP. However, there are some IL-1R-like receptors that have yet to be paired with ligands, such as ST2/T1 and IL-1rrp2 (24.Tominaga S.

In this paper, we describe the discovery of four novel members of the IL-1 family and the initial biological and biochemical characterization of IL-1H1. Human keratinocytes were obtained from Clonetics (Walkersville, MD) and cultured in growth medium supplied by the vendor. A431 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. IL-1β and TNFα were produced at SmithKline Beecham, and INFγ was purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Potential full-length cDNAs corresponding to two new members of the IL-1 family (IL-1H1 and IL-1H3) were initially identified through a search of an assembled version of the public and commercial EST data bases, respectively, using BLAST or FASTA and known members of the IL-1 family. Two additional members (IL-1H2 and IL-1H4) were subsequently found by searching with complete sequences of IL-1H1 and IL-1H3, respectively. The cDNAs corresponding to these ESTs were obtained from Human Genome Sciences (Gaithersburg, MD) (IL-1H1 and IL-1H2) or the IMAGE consortium (mouse IL-1H3: accession no. W08205, IMAGE clone no. 332733; IL-1H4: accession nos. AI014548 and AI343258, IMAGE clone no. 1628761). Complete sequencing of these cDNAs showed that they contained an entire coding region for each homologue. A portion of the sequence of IL-1H1 matched with human STS CHLC.GAAT11C03.P3330 clone GAAT11C03 (accession no. G942011), which has been mapped to chromosome 2q approximately 142 centimorgans from the end of the chromosome. A partial, aberrantly spliced mouse homologue of IL-1H1 (accession no. AA030324) was identified in an assembled mouse EST data base in a search with human IL-1H1. A correctly spliced mouse IL-1H1 cDNA homologue was obtained via reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction from RNA isolated from TNFα/IFNγ-stimulated murine keratinocyte PAM 212 cells. The full-length cDNA encoding IL-1H1 was subcloned into pET16B (Novagen Inc., Madison, WI) vector at the NdeI site. To ensure an authentic N terminus following factor Xa cleavage, removal of the NdeI site was performed using the QuickChange System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Human IL-1 H1 was then expressed as an N terminus His6-factor Xa-tagged protein in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 25 °C for 16 h according to the vendor's recommendations. E. coli cells expressing human and murine IL-1H1 were suspended at a 10:1 ratio in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 300 mmNaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cells were lysed and purified using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). The His tag was cleaved off by incubating IL-1H1 overnight at room temperature with factor Xa at a factor Xa/IL-1H1 ratio of 1:100. The mixture of cleaved and uncleaved proteins was passed over a Superdex 75 sizing column in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for final purification and to remove any endotoxin. Purified proteins were used to immunize rabbits to generate polyclonal antisera according to standard protocols. Circular dichroism data were measured on a Jasco J-710 CD Spectropolarimeter at 0.3 mg/ml cytokine in a 0.1-cm path length water-jacketed cuvette at 22 °C in 10 mmsodium phosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 0.3 mm EDTA, pH 7.0. Wavelength scans were taken at 50 nm/min, and eight spectra were averaged in each case. Concentrations of cytokines were determined by absorbance at 280 nm using extinction coefficients calculated from sequence (28.Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3472) Google Scholar). Thermal stability curves were measured by monitoring at a single wavelength while raising scanning temperature at about 1 degree/min. Total RNA was isolated from various cells and tissues using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies Inc., Rockville, MD) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. RNA was fractionated by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gels, transferred to GeneScreen Plus membranes, and cross-linked using a UV Stratalinker-180 (Stratagene). The blots were probed with 32P-labeled IL-1Hs or IL-4 cDNA and the housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) according to standard procedures. A commercial human and murine multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from various tissues, was processed according to the manufacturer's instructions. For immunoblot analysis, cell lysates and conditioned media were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBST (PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20), and probed with anti-IL-1H1 antibody or anti-HSV glycoprotein C R46 (generous gift of R. Eisenberg and G. Cohen) (29.Eisenberg R.J. Ponce de Leon M. Friedman H.M. Fries L.F. Frank M.M. Hasting J.C. Cohen G.H. Microb. Pathog. 1987; 3: 423-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The membrane was then washed and developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoprecipitation, cells were metabolically labeled by incubating exponentially growing cells for 4 h in methionine- and cysteine-free medium containing 5% dialyzed FBS with 100–150 μCi/ml of Tran35S-label (∼1000 Ci/mmol, ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA). Cells were lysed in PBSTDS (PBS containing 10% Triton X-100, 0.5% deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS). Five μl of preimmune or anti-IL-1H1 immune serum was then mixed with precleared35S-labeled cell lysate or conditioned medium and 20 μl of protein A-agarose (Life Technologies) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer. The beads were solubilized in sample buffer and resolved through SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, fixed, dried, and processed for autoradiography. BALB/c mice (n = 6) were treated with oxazolone as described previously (30.Webb E.F. Tzimas M.N. Newsholme S.J. Griswold D.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1998; 111: 86-92Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were sensitized on day 0 by a single application of 10 μl of a 1.6% solution of oxazolone (Sigma) in ethanol on the left ear. To characterize the early response to oxazolone, the animals were challenged on day 7 with 10 μl of 0.8% solution of oxazolone on the left ear. Ear thickness was measured with a dial micrometer (L. S. Starrett Co., Athol, MA), and tissue samples were collected at various time points after challenge over a 24-h period. In the experiment of repeated oxazolone challenges, the mice were challenged with 10 μl of a 0.8% solution of oxazolone on the left ear three times per week for 4 weeks postsensitization (on days 7, 9, 11, 14, 16, 18, 21, 23, 25, 28, 30, and 32). Ear thickness was measured, and tissue samples were collected 24 h after each challenge. In addition, the established chronic lesion at 4 weeks was examined at various time points up to 24 h after the last challenge. Mouse ears were exposed to UVB radiation for 30 min as described previously (31.Griswold D.E. Connor J.E. Dalton B.J. Lee J.C. Simon P. Hillegass L. Sieg D.J. Hanna N. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 1019-1023Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For herpes simple virus (HSV) infection, 6-week-old female BALB/c mice (Charles River, Raleigh, NC) (n = 4) were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (40 mg/kg; Fort Dodge Laboratories, Fort Dodge, IA) and xylazine (5 mg/kg; Miles, Shawnee Mission, KS) and then inoculated, after ear pinna scarification, with 105 plaque-forming units of HSV-1 SC16 (32.Hill T.J. Field H.J. Blyth W.A. J. Gen. Virol. 1975; 28: 341-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) diluted in PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum. Animals were observed daily for signs of infection. At various times postinfection, mice were euthanized using CO2 followed by exsanguination and removal of ear pinnae. Samples for protein and RNA analysis were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was prepared using the Trizol method (Life Technologies). Protein extracts were prepared by homogenization in radioimmune precipitation buffer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) as described by the manufacturer. Ears were also processed for histological analysis. All experiments involving animals were in accordance with SmithKline Beecham's animal care and use committee recommendations. Mouse ears were immersion-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at 4 °C overnight, cryoprotected in 15% sucrose in PBS overnight, and frozen-embedded in OCT compound (TissueTek, Miles Inc., Elkhart, IN). Tissues were sectioned at 10 μm, deproteinated in 0.2 m HCl for 10 min, acetylated in 0.1 m triethanolamine with 0.25% acetic anhydride for 15 min, and dehydrated through a graded series of ethanols. Polymerase chain reaction-generated murine IL-1H1 cDNA templates containing T7 and SP6 promoter sites were used for riboprobe generation, and in situ hybridization was performed as described previously (33.Lu L. Gillet N.A. Cell Vis. 1994; 1: 169-176Google Scholar). Following hybridization, the tissues were dehydrated through a series of graded ethanols, air-dried, and developed by emulsion autoradiography. Tissue sections were then stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histological analysis. A search of public and private EST data bases for sequence homologues of the IL-1 family revealed four new members, which we have designated IL-1H1, IL-1H2, IL-1H3, and IL-1H4. Complete predicted sequences of the four proteins and their alignment with known IL-1 family members is shown in Fig.1 A. The percentage amino acid similarity of the IL-1Hs to known members of the family including IL-18 varies between 12 and 54%, which can be compared with the 28–36% similarity seen among IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-1ra, all of which bind to the same receptor (Table I). Murine paralogues of the known IL-1s are typically >60% identical, whereas murine IL-1H1 is 53.2% identical and 63% similar to human IL-1H1. The closest homologues of murine IL-1H3 are murine IL-1ra (59.1% similarity, 52.5% identity) and human IL-1ra (54.1% similarity, 47.9% identity). Based on homology, IL-1H3 is a relatively recent duplication of IL-1ra and is not a paralogue of IL-1H2 or IL-1H4. Indeed, the likely human orthologue of IL-1H3 (IL-1HY1) was recently published while this manuscript was in preparation (34.Mulero J.J. Pace A.M. Nelkin S.T. Loeb D.B. Correa T.R. Drmanac R. Ford J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Human IL-1HY1 and murine IL-1H3 are ∼90% identical and differ in only few amino acids in the central and C-terminal regions (34.Mulero J.J. Pace A.M. Nelkin S.T. Loeb D.B. Correa T.R. Drmanac R. Ford J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). IL-1H4 seems to be the most distantly related protein to known IL-1s.Table IPercentage of amino acid similarity between various IL-1 family membersIL-1αIL-1βIL-1raIL-1H1IL-1H2IL-1H3IL-1H4IL-18IL-1α10028.429.125.022.824.515.716.3IL-1β10035.727.034.037.818.828.6IL-1ra10031.129.154.124.525.0IL-1H110032.130.630.618.9IL-1H210029.117.919.9IL-1H310026.030.6IL-1H410012.2IL-18100Values were calculated using Lasergene, the alignment in Fig.1 A, and the PAM250 distance matrix. Open table in a new tab Values were calculated using Lasergene, the alignment in Fig.1 A, and the PAM250 distance matrix. IL-1H1 was mapped to chromosome 2q12–21, which is close to the region where IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-1ra have been localized, further supporting an evolutionary relationship within the IL-1 family. Interestingly, human IL-1H3 (IL-1HY1) was also mapped to chromosome 2q14 in close proximity to IL-1ra (34.Mulero J.J. Pace A.M. Nelkin S.T. Loeb D.B. Correa T.R. Drmanac R. Ford J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The chromosomal localization of the remaining IL-1 homologues has not yet been determined. A schematic representation of all IL-1 members is shown in Fig.1 B. Like all but one of the known IL-1 family members, IL-1ra, the four IL-1Hs do not encode a hydrophobic leader peptide found in most secreted proteins, and hence we would expect these proteins to be released from cells undergoing necrosis or apoptosis. Similar to the intracellular form of IL-1ra, IL-1H1, IL-1H2, and IL-1H3 lack a propeptide sequence, but their entire coding regions align with the mature regions of IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-1ra (Fig. 1), suggesting that they most likely retain a similar tertiary structure. In contrast, IL-1H4 has a significant propeptide region that, like IL-1β and IL-18, contains a potential proteolytic processing site for caspase 1 (Fig. 1 B) that could be necessary for its biological activity. Preliminary data indicate that IL-1H4 is cleaved by caspase 1 at this site. 2S. Kumar, unpublished data. To further characterize and compare the properties of these new IL-1 homologues with the known IL-1 members, we initially focused on IL-1H1. Upon expression of an amino-terminal His6-tagged fusion inE. coli, IL-1H1 was found to be soluble, and it could be purified through Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography. Cleavage at the engineered factor Xa site yielded mature IL-1H1 (data not shown). To obtain additional evidence that IL-1H1 was structurally similar to other IL-1s, we compared its CD spectrum with that of IL-1ra and IL-1β (Fig. 2 A). The shape and amplitude of IL-1ra and IL-1β spectra agree well with previous reports (35.Chang B.S. Beauvais R.M. Arakawa T. Narhi L.O. Dong A.C. Aparisio D.I. Carpenter J.F. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 3399-3406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 36.Meyers C.A. Johanson K.O. Miles L.M. McDevitt P.J. Simon P.L. Webb R.L. Chen M.-J. Holskin B.P. Lillquist J.S. Young P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11176-11181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CD spectrum of IL-1H1 is similar to IL-1ra and consistent with a substantial contribution from β-strands. TheT m for thermal denaturation of IL-1H1 was 61 °C, which is also similar to that for IL-1ra and indicates that the two proteins have a comparable folding energy (Fig. 2 B). Interestingly, the spectrum of IL-1β is somewhat distinct, although it also has a similar structure. These data suggest that IL-1H1 is likely to adopt the characteristic β-barrel structure of the IL-1s. The position of 12 β-strands in the IL-1H1 sequence can be predicted from the alignment with IL-1α, IL-1β, and IL-1ra, whose structures are known (see Fig. 1 A). Because it is similar in structure and site of synthesis to other IL-1s, we expected that IL-1H1 might bind to a receptor in the IL-1R family. However, we were unable to demonstrate any binding to the type I IL-1R, IL-18R, or ST2/T1, suggesting that it binds to an as yet unidentified receptor (data not shown). No expression of any of the novel homologues was detected in normal tissues represented on commercially available multiple tissue blots, suggesting that the IL-1 homologues are either expressed at low levels or require suitable stimulation. This is reflected by the rare occurrence of ESTs for the homologues in public or commercial data bases. Thus, human IL-1H1 ESTs were identified only in TNFα- and IFNγ-stimulated keratinocyte and epithelial cell cDNA libraries, while the murine orthologue was found in a placenta library. Similarly, a human IL-1H2 EST was found only in an osteoclastoma cell library; a mouse IL-1H3 EST was found in a 19.5-day embryo library; and human IL-1H4 ESTs were found in a mixed fetal lung, testes, B cell, and colon library. Although we did not detect any expression of murine IL-1H3 in commercially available murine multiple tissue Northern blots, its human orthologue, IL-1HY1, was reported to be expressed in fetal skin and spleen cDNA libraries by polymerase chain reaction analysis (34.Mulero J.J. Pace A.M. Nelkin S.T. Loeb D.B. Correa T.R. Drmanac R. Ford J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization of the mouse IL-1H1 cDNA to a panel of normal mouse tissue sections revealed expression in only the esophageal squamous mucosa. Low levels of IL-1H1 expression (∼100–200 copies/ng of mRNA) were also detected in normal human lung and macrophages by Taqman analysis (data not shown). These data support the lack of widespread expression seen in the human multiple tissue Northern blots. In contrast, IL-1H1 mRNA was found to be induced in TNFα- and IFNγ-treated human keratinocytes with maximal expression when both cytokines were added together (Fig.3 A, lanes 1–4). A similar induction was seen in the epithelial cell line, A431 (Fig.3 A, lanes 5 and 6). Similar to IL-1H1 and consistent with stimulus-dependent expression of these genes, human IL-1H3 (IL-1HY1) was shown to be induced in response to phorbol esters and bacterial lipopolysaccharide (34.Mulero J.J. Pace A.M. Nelkin S.T. Loeb D.B. Correa T.R. Drmanac R. Ford J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 263: 702-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). To evaluate changes in IL-1H1 protein levels, polyclonal antibodies were raised to both human and murine IL-1H1. Both immunoprecipitation and Western blot demonstrate that IL-1H1 protein was induced in human keratinocytes by TNFα and IFNγ (Fig. 3 B), as seen in the mRNA experiments. However, the protein was only detected in the cell lysates and not in the conditioned media. Intracellular expression of IL-1H1 protein was also detected in bacterial lipopolysaccharide-stimulated human monocytes (data not shown). Keratinocytes have been shown to contain IL-1ra and precursor forms of IL-1α and"

Identification of two HER4 isoforms, HER4 JM-a and JM-b, which differ in their extracellular juxtamembrane region and in their susceptibility to cleavage after phorbol ester stimulation, showed that the juxtamembrane region of the receptor is critical for proteolysis. We now demonstrate that phorbol ester and pervanadate are effective stimuli for HER4 JM-a processing and that the HER4 JM-b isoform does not undergo cleavage in response to any of the stimuli studied. We also show that HER4 JM-a is not cleaved in cells lacking the metalloprotease tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE) and that reexpression of TACE in these cells restores constitutive and regulated processing of HER4 JM-a. Moreover, we show that the sequence specific to the HER4 JM-a juxtamembrane region is sufficient to confer susceptibility to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate-induced cleavage of the HER2 receptor. In conclusion, we provide evidence that TACE is essential for the regulated shedding of the HER4 JM-a receptor.

Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2841-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), members of the EGF family which, unlike the NRGs, are also ligands for the EGF receptor. HER4 mRNA is expressed in several tissues such as heart, brain, kidney, and skeletal muscle (2.Plowman G.D. Culouscou J.M. Whitney G.S. Green J.M. Carlton G.W. Foy L. Neubauer M.G. Shoyab M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1746-1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar), suggesting that this receptor is involved in the development and maintenance of a variety of organs and cell types. In fact, HER4 is essential for heart development: HER4-deficient mice die as embryos due to the lack of myocardial trabeculae (18.Gassmann M. Casagranda F. Orioli D. Simon H. Lai C. Klein R. Lemke G. Nature. 1995; 378: 390-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (946) Google Scholar). HER4 knockout mice also manifest neural defects, indicating that its function is critical for nervous system development as well. HER4 has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of different types of cancer (2.Plowman G.D. Culouscou J.M. Whitney G.S. Green J.M. Carlton G.W. Foy L. Neubauer M.G. Shoyab M. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Cancer. 1999; 84: 24-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thus, it is likely that the control of expression and function of HER4 is important in normal development as well as in disease. In an earlier study, we reported the identification of a novel isoform of HER4 (HER4 JM-b) that differs from the original receptor (HER4 JM-a) in the juxtamembrane portion of the extracellular domain of the receptor. The juxtamembrane region of HER4 JM-b contains a stretch of 13 amino acids that replaces a stretch of 23 amino acids present in HER4 JM-a. The two receptor isoforms differ in their tissue distribution. The two isoforms also vary in their response to phorbol ester stimulation, which leads to a rapid down-regulation of surface expression of HER4 JM-a but not of HER4 JM-b. From this study, it was concluded that the JM-a isoform represents a cleavable form of HER4, whereas the JM-b form is uncleavable, and the differences in receptor processing as well as tissue distribution may reflect differences in their biological activities (21.Elenius K.

It has been shown by other investigators that the down-regulation of surface HER4 in response to phorbol ester stimulation results from the shedding of the ectodomain of HER4 (22.Vecchi M. Baulida J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18989-18995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and that a metalloprotease appears to be responsible for the cleavage (23.Vecchi M. Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, these studies did not identify the protease responsible for the cleavage of HER4 or the region of the receptor required for receptor shedding. Members of the metalloprotease-disintegrin family (also known as ADAMs) have been shown to participate in protein ectodomain shedding (reviewed in Refs.24.Blobel C.P.

Among them, tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE or ADAM 17) is the metalloprotease whose catalytic function is best characterized.

In the present study, we demonstrate that TACE is involved in the processing of the HER4 JM-a receptor in response to phorbol ester and pervanadate. Moreover, we show that the sequence of the juxtamembrane domain of HER4 JM-a is sufficient to make another HER family member, the HER2 receptor, susceptible to constitutive as well as regulated cleavage. AC2/G3 is a clone of NIH 3T3 cells expressing HER4 JM-a, and BC15/H12 is a clone of NIH 3T3 cells expressing the HER4 JM-b isoform. Both clones were cultured as described previously (21.Elenius K.

Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts were established from E14 fetuses obtained from TACE+/− × TACE+/− crosses (C57BL6 × 129)F2 (29.Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W.

Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1363) Google Scholar). These cells were immortalized by infecting them with a retrovirus containing the SV40 large T-antigen. TACE+/+ and TACE−/− (MEF-Tag) cells were selected by repeated passage and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mm sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.), 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 100 μm β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). The cDNA encoding mouse TACE was obtained byKpnI/NotI digestion from a pcDNA3-based construct and ligated into PCGN1 using the same restriction sites. The 1.3-kb cDNA encoding the dominant-negative mouse kuzbanian (MKUZDN) was obtained by a BamHI/EcoRV restriction digestion of a pBluescript SK-based plasmid (32.Pan D. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 271-280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and cloned into the PCGN1 vector using the same restriction sites. The PCGN1 bicistronic vector is a pcDNA3 (Invitrogen)-based plasmid with a multiple cloning site down stream of the cytomegalovirus enhancer-promoter. The bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal and transcription termination sequence are located 3′ of a multiple cloning site. This plasmid leads to expression of myrEGFP and the neomycin resistance fusion gene under the control of the mini-elongation factor promoter. This vector was generated by Michael Lin (Children's Hospital Boston). All enzymes were from New England Biolabs. All clones were confirmed by sequencing. A plasmid expressing full-length HER2 under the control of the long terminal repeat promoter was provided by S. W. Lee (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA). To generate the chimeric receptor, we first generated a 108-bp HER4 JM-a fragment with HER2 flanking sequences by polymerase chain reaction using HER4 cDNA as a template and the following HER2/HER4 hybrid primers: F2 (5′-TCAACTGCACCCACTCCTGTAACGGTCCCACTAGTCA-3′), and R1 (5′-ACGATGGACGTCAGAGGGCTAGCATGTTGTGGTAAAGT-3′), which contains an AatII site. We also amplified a 119-bp fragment of the HER2 5′ juxtamembrane region containing a SphI site, using full-length HER2 cDNA as a template. The following primers were used for this reaction: HER2 primer F1 (5′-CCCAGCGGTGTGAAACCTGA-3′), and HER2/HER4 hybrid primer R2 (5′-TGACTAGTGGGACCGTTACAGGAGTGGGTGCAGTTGA-3′). Both 108- and 119-bp polymerase chain reaction products were isolated, pooled, and used as template for an additional polymerase chain reaction with the above-mentioned F1 and R1 primers. This reaction generated a 190-bp fragment that was then digested with SphI andAatII. This fragment was ligated on the 2.2-kbEcoRV-SacII fragment of HER2 that had been previously subcloned into the multiple cloning site of pBluescript SK+ and cut with SphI and AatII. The 2.2-kb HER2 JM-a fragment was then cut with SacII and BstBI, and the 2041-bp fragment generated was ligated to the same sites of long terminal repeat-HER2 to generate long terminal repeat-HER2 JM-a. All amplifications were carried out in a Robocycler Gradient 96 (Stratagene) using the following program: 1) 96 °C for 2 min, 2) 95 °C for 45 s, 3) 60 °C for 1 min, 4) 72 °C for 45 s (steps 2–4 were repeated 30 times), and 5) a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. For the generation of stable mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF-Tag) expressing HER4 JM-a, cells were transfected with a mixture of pCDM8-HER4 JM-a (21.Elenius K. Corfas G. Paul S. Choi C.J. Rio C. Plowman G.D. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26761-26768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and pBabe Puro vector (10:1) using pFxTM-5 (Invitrogen) in serum-free medium (Opti-MEM® I; Life Technologies, Inc.). Clones were selected with puromycin (10 μg/ml for the TACE−/− fibroblasts and 2 μg/ml for the TACE+/+ fibroblasts), isolated by limiting dilutions in 96-well plates, and then screened for high expression of HER4 by immunofluorescence. In the case of transient transfections, NIH 3T3 AC2/G3 and MEF TACE−/− B7/G2 (stably expressing HER4 JM-a) were cultured in 6-well plates (Costar) and transfected with 10 μg of the MKUZDN-PCGN1 and mTACE-PCGN1 constructs, respectively, using pFxTM-5 in Opti-MEM® I. COS-7 cells were transfected with approximately 30 μg of HER4 JM-a, HER2, or HER2 JM-a plasmids in 100-mm dishes with LipofectAMINETM reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) in Opti-MEM® I. IC-3 was supplied by Immunex Corp., 1,10-phenanthroline (PNT) was bought from Sigma, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), calyculin A, okadaic acid, thapsigargin, and forskolin were purchased from Calbiochem. Pervanadate was freshly prepared for each experiment by mixing 1m sodium orthovanadate (Sigma) and 1 m H2O2(Sigma) to give a 0.5 m solution. Cells were plated in 96-well plates and cultured to confluence. After the different treatments in serum-free medium, the cells were fixed with an equal volume of 8% paraformaldehyde solution (4% final concentration) for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS and then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin-PBS for 1 h at room temperature. The mouse anti-human HER4 primary antibody (H4.77.16; NeoMarkers), which recognizes the extracellular region of HER4, was added to the wells at a 1:300 dilution in the same blocking solution and incubated overnight at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The cells were then washed three times (10 min each) with PBS and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of a biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (Vector Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were again washed with PBS, and the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC Elite; Vector Laboratories) was used as directed for an additional hour at room temperature. After washing the plate with PBS, the coloring reaction was started by adding 100 μl/well of the TMB peroxidase EIA substrate (Bio-Rad). The reaction was allowed to proceed for 5–10 min, and then 80 μl of the supernatant of each well were transferred to 96 flat-bottomed flexible assay plates (Falcon), and the reaction was stopped with 40 μl/well of 2n sulfuric acid. The resulting color intensity was measured in a Titertek Multiskan Plus reader at 450 nm. Each treatment point is the average of the computation of at least six wells. All experiments were repeated at least three times. Transfected and untransfected cells in culture were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 20 min. Cells were washed with PBS and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in PBS (blocking solution) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the primary antibody (mouse anti-human HER4 (H4.77.16; NeoMarkers) or mouse anti-human HER2 (c-neu Ab-5; Oncogene Research Products)) diluted in blocking solution overnight at 4 °C. The cells were washed with PBS, and the detection procedure was carried out using a Cy3 anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories). Fields were counted first for GFP-positive cells (green fluorescence), and then the number of GFP-positive cells that were Cy3-positive (red fluorescence) was calculated. Photographs from cells were obtained with a Nikon eclipse TE300 inverted microscope. Transfected COS-7 cells were cultured in 100-mm dishes for 3 days, and after treatments, the cells were washed with cold PBS and scratched off the plate with a “cell lifter” (Costar). The pelleted cells were resuspended in 1 ml of membrane buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8, 10% sucrose, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and homogenized with pestle A of a Dounce homogenizer in ice. The homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min at 14,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge 5415C at 4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in radioimmune precipitation buffer (50 mmTris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and spun down again under the same conditions, and the supernatant was retained. In some cases, to separate membrane from cytosol, the supernatants of the membrane buffer spin were ultracentrifuged at 200,000 × g in a TLA120.1 rotor for 15 min at 4 °C, and the pellets of this centrifugation were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mmTris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein content was measured using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay. For COS-7 cell membrane extracts, aliquots containing the same amount of protein were diluted 1:1 in 2× dithiothreitol sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol, 6% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml bromphenol blue, and 100 mmdithiothreitol), resolved in SDS-polyacrylamide minigels, and transferred to Immobilon-P (polyvinylidene difluoride) membranes (Millipore) with a Mini Trans-Blot® cell (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked, and the transferred proteins were probed with a mouse anti-HER2 (c-neu Ab-3; Oncogene Research Products) that recognizes an intracellular epitope of the receptor, a rabbit anti-c-insulin receptor β (D. Vicent and C. R. Kahn; Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA), or a mouse anti-APP (clone 22C11). For NIH 3T3 or immortalized embryonic fibroblasts expressing HER4, whole cells lysates in 2× dithiothreitol sample buffer (starting from the same number of cells in each treatment) were prepared. Lysates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon-P. The membranes were blocked and incubated with a rabbit polyclonal anti-HER4 antibody that recognizes the intracellular region of the receptor (RB-284-P; NeoMarkers). All blots were incubated with the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), developed with Renaissance®(NEN Life Science Products), and exposed to autoradiography film (X-OMATTM Blue XB-1; Kodak). Cells were grown to 80% confluence in 60-mm dishes and then labeled with 200 μCi/ml Tran35S-label in methionine- and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 5% dialyzed FBS for 24 h. After a rinse with methionine and cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 5% dialyzed FBS, the cells were treated with 1 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with or without PMA. The supernatants were precleared by incubation with 25 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. The supernatants were recovered and incubated with 40 μl of protein A/G-Sepharose containing 1 μg of anti-HER4 antibody (H4.77.16; NeoMarkers) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Beads were then spun down, washed three times with cold PBS, resuspended in 2× dithiothreitol sample buffer, and heated to 65 °C for 10 min, and the supernatant was loaded onto a 5.5% polyacrylamide gel. The gel was dried and exposed to autoradiography film. Unpaired t tests were performed using StatView software. Previous studies showed that the HER4 receptor is endocytosis-impaired (33.Baulida J. Kraus M.H. Alimandi M. Di Fiore P.P. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5251-5257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar) but that the level of receptor surface expression can be regulated by receptor shedding, which can be induced by phorbol ester (22.Vecchi M. Baulida J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18989-18995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and pervanadate (44.Vecchi M. Rudolph-Owen L.A. Brown C.L. Dempsey P.J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20589-20595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). With the identification of different juxtamembrane isoforms of HER4, we demonstrated that PMA, a potent activator of protein kinase C (PKC), led to a reduction of radioactive NRGβ1 binding in cells expressing the JM-a but not the JM-b isoform (21.Elenius K. Corfas G. Paul S. Choi C.J. Rio C. Plowman G.D. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26761-26768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Thus, these results suggested that HER4 JM-b is not cleaved in response to PMA stimulation. We have now developed an ELISA to measure the relative amount of receptor present in the cell surface, using a monoclonal antibody against the extracellular domain of the HER4 receptor. We first used this assay to confirm our observation on the differences between the response of the two HER4 isoforms to PMA stimulation, using NIH 3T3 cell lines that express similar levels of the HER4 isoforms (Ref. 21.Elenius K. Corfas G. Paul S. Choi C.J. Rio C. Plowman G.D. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26761-26768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar; see Fig.1 B). When cells expressing HER4 JM-a were treated with PMA (100 ng/ml for 45 min), the ELISA showed a >50% reduction in the HER4 surface immunoreactivity. In contrast, when cells expressing HER4 JM-b were treated the same way, there was no change in HER4 surface immunoreactivity (Fig.1 A). These results replicate our previous finding that surface expression of the JM-a isoform but not the JM-b isoform is reduced in response to PMA stimulation. To confirm that the decreased cell surface expression of HER4 JM-a after phorbol ester treatment is due to receptor cleavage, we analyzed the effects of PMA on HER4 by Western blot and metabolic labeling. NIH 3T3 cells expressing either HER4 JM-a or JM-b were treated with vehicle or PMA, and the levels of HER4 were monitored by Western blot using an antibody directed against the intracellular domain of the receptor. Whereas PMA treatment resulted in a small increase in the intensity of the band corresponding to the full-length receptor in HER4 JM-b-expressing cells, this band was dramatically reduced by PMA treatment in the HER4 JM-a-expressing cells (180 kDa; Fig.1 B; see also Ref. 21.Elenius K. Corfas G. Paul S. Choi C.J. Rio C. Plowman G.D. Klagsbrun M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26761-26768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Concomitant with the reduction in full-length receptor, lysates of PMA-treated HER4 JM-a-expressing cells displayed an 80-kDa band, which most probably corresponds to the intracellular domain of the receptor (see Ref. 22.Vecchi M. Baulida J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18989-18995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). This band was absent from the PMA-treated HER4 JM-b-expressing cells. Cleavage of cell surface receptors is expected to result in the release of their extracellular domain into the medium. This possibility was tested by metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation. Cells expressing either HER4 JM-a or JM-b were metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine and treated with vehicle or PMA, and the culture medium was subjected to immunoprecipitation with an antibody directed against the extracellular domain of HER4. When immunoprecipitates from PMA-treated HER4 JM-a-expressing cells were analyzed by gel electrophoresis, only a 120-kDa band was observed (Fig. 1 C). This band was absent from untreated HER4 JM-a-expressing cells and from the untreated or treated HER4 JM-b-expressing cells. Thus, these results show that in response to PMA treatment, HER4 JM-a is cleaved, resulting in an 80-kDa intracellular fragment and the release to the medium of a 120-kDa extracellular domain fragment. It has been reported that HER4 shedding (most probably the JM-a form) is induced not only by PMA but also by pervanadate, an inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases (44.Vecchi M. Rudolph-Owen L.A. Brown C.L. Dempsey P.J. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20589-20595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, it is apparent that more than one signaling pathway regulates surface HER4 expression. We tested whether other signaling pathways can induce HER4 shedding, and whether the difference between the JM-a and JM-b isoforms extends to pervanadate and other stimuli. Cells were incubated in the absence or presence of thapsigargin (1 μm), a blocker of the endoplasmic reticulum ATPase that leads to increased cytoplasmic calcium, forskolin (10 μm), an activator of adenylate cyclase that leads to activation of protein kinase A, okadaic acid (10 nm) and calyculin A (10 nm), inhibitors of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, or pervanadate (1 mm). The effects of these drugs on surface HER4 expression were tested by ELISA. Only pervanadate induced HER4 JM-a shedding similar to that induced by PMA (Fig.1 D). Calyculin A had a small effect on surface HER4 JM-a expression. The results indicate that shedding of the HER4 JM-a is predominantly regulated by PKC and tyrosine phosphorylation and that the JM-b isoform is consistently resistant to cleavage. Metalloproteases have been shown to participate in shedding of the ectodomain of transmembrane proteins (34.Hooper N.M. Karran E.H. Turner A"
https://openalex.org/W2070632817,"Recent evidence indicates that arrest of mammalian cells at the G2/M checkpoint involves inactivation and translocation of Cdc25C, which is mediated by phosphorylation of Cdc25C on serine 216. Data obtained with a phospho-specific antibody against serine 216 suggest that activation of the DNA damage checkpoint is accompanied by an increase in serine 216 phosphorylated Cdc25C in the nucleus after exposure of cells to γ-radiation. Prior treatment of cells with 2 mm caffeine inhibits such a change and markedly reduces radiation-induced ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)-dependent Chk2/Cds1 activation and phosphorylation. Chk2/Cds1 is known to localize in the nucleus and to phosphorylate Cdc25C at serine 216 in vitro. Caffeine does not inhibit Chk2/Cds1 activity directly, but rather, blocks the activation of Chk2/Cds1 by inhibiting ATM kinase activity.In vitro, ATM phosphorylates Chk2/Cds1 at threonine 68 close to the N terminus, and caffeine inhibits this phosphorylation with an IC50 of approximately 200 μm. Using a phospho-specific antibody against threonine 68, we demonstrate that radiation-induced, ATM-dependent phosphorylation of Chk2/Cds1 at this site is caffeine-sensitive. From these results, we propose a model wherein caffeine abrogates the G2/M checkpoint by targeting the ATM-Chk2/Cds1 pathway; by inhibiting ATM, it prevents the serine 216 phosphorylation of Cdc25C in the nucleus. Inhibition of ATM provides a molecular explanation for the increased radiosensitivity of caffeine-treated cells.

In addition to apoptosis, DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation (IR)1 or other insults triggers cell cycle checkpoint activation and subsequent cell cycle arrest, augmenting the ability of cells to repair damaged DNA (1.O'Connor P.M. Cancer Surv. 1997; 29: 151-182PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1761) Google Scholar). The checkpoint could contribute to the development of drug resistance, a formidable limitation in current cancer treatment, and consequently agents that override cell cycle checkpoints could be used to sensitize cells to killing by genotoxic drugs (3.Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B. Science. 1994; 266: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2309) Google Scholar). Proof of this concept has arisen from studies with caffeine, which causes the disruption of DNA damage checkpoints (including the G2/M checkpoint), and sensitizes tumor cells to ionizing radiation and other genotoxic agents (4.Lau C.C. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2942-2946Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 5.Schlegel R. Pardee A.B. Science. 1986; 232: 1264-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism of action of caffeine and its molecular targets remain unclear. One possible target is phosphodiesterase, but a more potent phosphodiesterase inhibitor, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, is unable to abrogate checkpoint function in many systems (5.Schlegel R. Pardee A.B. Science. 1986; 232: 1264-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar), suggesting that alternative targets exist for caffeine.

Cell. 1997; 91: 865-867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylation of Cdc2 at these sites is catalyzed by the dual specificity phosphatase Cdc25 (7.Dunphy W.G. Kumagai A.

Recent evidence indicates that the G2/M DNA checkpoint involves inactivation and possibly translocation of Cdc25C into the cytoplasm akin to what has been demonstrated for fission yeast Cdc25 (10.Lopez-Girona A.

During the normal progression through the cell cycle, serine 216 phosphorylation may also contribute to the negative regulation of Cdc25C because Cdc25C is phosphorylated at this site in interphase but not during mitosis when Cdc25 is active (13.Peng C.Y.

However, it is still unclear how DNA damage affects Cdc25C serine 216 phosphorylation, nor do we know if inhibition of the Chk1 or Chk2/Cds1 pathways alters this phosphorylation. Accumulating data suggest that ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase is a proximal component of DNA damage-induced cell cycle checkpoint pathway (22.Lavin M.F. Khanna K.K. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1999; 75: 1201-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). ATM must play an important role in the G2/M checkpoint because ATM-deficient cells fail to arrest in the G2 phase of cell cycle prior to mitosis after DNA damage (23.Beamish H. Williams R. Chen P. Lavin M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20486-20493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that radiation-induced Chk2/Cds1 activation is ATM-dependent (18.Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J.

It remains to be shown that ATM directly phosphorylates Chk2/Cds1. To study how caffeine abrogates the G2/M checkpoint, it will be necessary to examine how caffeine affects the known G2/M checkpoint signal transduction pathway involving the phosphorylation of serine 216 on Cdc25C. We present evidence here showing that caffeine inhibits ATM-dependent activation of Chk2/Cds1 in vivo. In vitro, caffeine did not inhibit Chk2/Cds1 directly but instead inhibited ATM at an IC50 of approximately 200 μm. During the preparation of this manuscript, similar findings that caffeine can inhibit ATM kinase activity were reported (24.Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibbetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Blasina A. Price B.D. Turenne G.A. McGowan C.H. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1135-1138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Our study provides further mechanistic details of how this inhibition can lead to the abrogation of the G2/M checkpoint. Using a recently generated phospho-specific antibody against serine 216, we demonstrate that activation of the DNA damage checkpoint is correlated with an increase in serine 216-phosphorylated Cdc25C in the nucleus and further, that prior treatment of cells with caffeine inhibits such a change. In addition, we provide evidence showing that ATM phosphorylates Chk2/Cds1 at threonine 68 in the N terminus, also in a caffeine-sensitive manner. Finally, caffeine is shown to inhibit ATM-dependent Chk2/Cds1 phosphorylationin vivo. Using a phospho-specific antibody against threonine 68, we found that Chk2/Cds1 is phosphorylated at this site in vivo in cells after IR exposure, and this phosphorylation is inhibited by prior treatment of cells with caffeine. These results are consistent with a model in which caffeine abrogates the G2/M checkpoint by targeting the ATM-Chk2/Cds1 pathway by inhibiting ATM. To make a kinase-dead Chk2, aspartic acid 347 was converted to alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. Full-length wild type and kinase-dead (KD) Chk2 (D347A) were subcloned into pFASTBAC as GST fusion protein (Invitrogen) for baculovirus expression. Recombinant Chk2-GST proteins were purified by a glutathione-Sepharose affinity step followed by a gel filtration column. Full-length kinase-dead (KD) Chk2 and threonine 68 to alanine mutant, N terminus (amino acids 1–222), and C terminus of Chk2 (amino acids 206–543, with D347A mutation) were also subcloned into pGEX-5X for expression in bacteria and subsequently purified as GST fusion proteins as described above. Phosphopeptides of the following sequence were synthesized: phospho-S216, GLYRSP-pS-MPENLNR; phospho-T68, SSLETVS-pT-QELYS, and coupled to KLH. Phosphospecific antibodies to the KLH-coupled peptides were obtained and purified. Anti-Chk2 was described in Chaturvedi et al. (21.Chaturvedi P. Eng W.-K. Zhu Y. Mattern M.R. Mishra R. Hurle M.R. Zhang X. Annan R.S. Lu Q. Faucette L.F. Scott G.F. Li X. Carr S.A. Johnson R.K., D., W.J. Zhou B.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4047-4054Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Anti-ATM was purchased from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA), anti-Cdc25C (C-20) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA), and anti-phospho-S15 of p53 from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). MRC-5 cells were plated in microchamber slides overnight and irradiated the next day with 20 Gy of IR and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before fixing and staining. Untreated cells and cells processed with secondary antibody alone were included as controls. The cells were fixed for 10 min in PBS-buffered paraformaldehyde, 2% sucrose solution, followed by permeabilization for 10 min in cold buffer containing 0.5% Triton X-100 in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 3 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, and 300 mm sucrose (26.Scully R.

They were then blocked in 3% bovine serum (BSA) in PBS-Tween 20 and incubated in primary antibody at 1:3000 dilution in PBS-BSA for 1 h at 4 °C before washing three times with PBS-BSA. The slides were incubated in fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody in PBS-BSA for 1 h, washed three times with PBS-BSA, twice with PBS alone, and then dry-mounted. The slides were seen under an inverted florescence microscope (OLYMPUS BX-60). Whole cell extracts were prepared as described (21.Chaturvedi P. Eng W.-K. Zhu Y. Mattern M.R. Mishra R. Hurle M.R.

Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared using a kit from Pierce. Cells were grown in 100-ml flasks and treated with caffeine (2 mm) overnight and irradiated with 20 Gy. They were then removed by scraping and collected by centrifugation, and the pellets were lysed in extraction buffer to obtain the cytoplasmic fractions in the supernatant. The remaining pellets containing the nuclear fraction were then washed thoroughly three times with PBS and lysed in extraction buffer to obtain the nuclear extract. Chk2 kinase assays (21.Chaturvedi P. Eng W.-K. Zhu Y. Mattern M.R. Mishra R. Hurle M.R. Zhang X. Annan R.S. Lu Q. Faucette L.F. Scott G.F. Li X. Carr S.A. Johnson R.K., D., W.J. Zhou B.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4047-4054Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) and ATM kinase assays (27.Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281 (1179): 1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1704) Google Scholar) were performed as described. ATM was immunoprecipitated by adding anti-ATM antibody to total cell lysates and incubating with protein G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. Kinase assays were performed on the beads by incubating the resulting complexes in kinase buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [32P]ATP, and 1 μg of substrate for 30 min at 30 °C, and products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. It has been established that the G2/M DNA checkpoint is at least partially mediated by phosphorylation of serine 216 in Cdc25C (13.Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar, 14.Dalal S.N. Schweitzer C.M. Gan J. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4465-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). To study the role of serine 216 in this checkpoint, we raised an antibody to a phosphopeptide surrounding the serine 216 phosphorylation site. To test the specificity of the antibody, we performed an in vitroassay using GST-Chk2 as the active kinase and GST-Cdc25C as the substrate. A kinase-dead Chk2 fusion protein (D347A) was included as a negative control. The assay mixture was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted with anti phospho-S216 antibody. As shown in the Western blot (Fig. 1 A, lane 3), the phospho-S216 antibody recognized Cdc25C that was incubated with a wild type Chk2 in the in vitro kinase assay but failed to recognize unphosphorylated Cdc25C, incubated with a kinase-dead mutant (D347A) (Fig. 1 A, lane 2). Moreover, a peptide surrounding serine 216 blocked the antibody recognition (data not shown). These findings indicate that the anti-phospho-S216 antibody recognizes Cdc25C specifically when it is phosphorylated at serine 216 and confirms that Chk2/Cds1 phosphorylates Cdc25C at serine 216in vitro. To determine the intracellular localization of serine 216-phosphorylated Cdc25C and the effect of DNA damage checkpoint activation on serine 216 phosphorylation, biochemical fractionation experiments were performed using asynchronously growing MRC-5 cells before and immediately after IR with or without prior treatment of cells with caffeine. Whole-cell, cytoplasmic, or nuclear extracts were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Equal amounts of protein in each sample were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred to membranes, and blotted with anti-phospho-S216 and anti-Cdc25c antibody, respectively. Serine 216-phosphorylated Cdc25C was detected predominantly in the cytoplasmic extracts and to a lesser extent in the nuclear fraction (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1and 5). As a control for biochemical fractionation, nuclear protein nucleolin was found to be localized in the nuclear fractions (data not shown). Immediately after IR, an increase in serine 216-phosphorylated Cdc25C was observed in the nuclear fraction (Fig.1 B, lane 2), and prior treatment of cells with caffeine inhibited this increase (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). On the other hand, there was no appreciable increase in serine 216 phosphorylation in whole cell lysates (data not shown), consistent with the observation that the majority of serine 216-phosphorylated Cdc25C is in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 B, lane 5). Caffeine alone did not alter serine 216 phosphorylation in the absence of IR (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). Cdc25C was partitioned between nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions similarly to serine 216-phosphorylated Cdc25C. No gross relocation of Cdc25C was observed immediately after IR (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and6). Our data support a model that an increase in serine 216 phosphorylation in the nucleus is caused by the activation of serine 216 kinase but cannot totally rule out the possibility of nuclear relocation of Cdc25C as an alternative mechanism. This finding implies that caffeine could inhibit the activation of the serine 216 kinase in the nucleus after IR at a concentration at which it can abrogate the G2/M checkpoint. To confirm the cellular localization of phosphorylated Cdc25C after IR, indirect immunofluoresence analysis of normal diploid human fibroblasts (MRC-5) was performed. Actively proliferating cells were γ-irradiated and allowed to recover for 30 min at 37 °C before immunostaining. As a negative control, cells were left untreated or unirradiated. As shown in Fig. 2, punctate staining for serine 216 was obtained; in contrast to the results of biochemical fractionation experiments (Fig. 1 B), serine 216 staining was found to be enriched in the nucleus of both irradiated and unirradiated samples. Cytoplasmic staining was diminished in all the samples. This can be explained by the fact that phosphorylated serine 216 epitope is perhaps not exposed in the cytoplasm due to interaction with 14-3-3 proteins as has been reported previously (13.Peng C.Y. Graves P.R. Thoma R.S. Wu Z. Shaw A.S. Piwnica-Worms H. Science. 1997; 277: 1501-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1187) Google Scholar, 14.Dalal S.N. Schweitzer C.M. Gan J. DeCaprio J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4465-4479Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). We observed a possible increase in nuclear serine 216 reactivity after IR treatment of cells as these cells stained brighter than the unirradiated cells (Fig. 2). To determine whether the increase in serine 216 phosphorylation observed after radiation is ATM-dependent, we repeated the biochemical fractionation experiment using the A-T cell line AGO4405. No change in anti-phospho-S216 staining was observed in AGO4405 cells after IR exposure (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1 and2), and caffeine had no effect in the A-T cells (Fig.1 C, lanes 3 and 4). These results demonstrate that radiation-induced phosphorylation of Cdc25C on serine 216 in the nucleus is dependent on ATM and is inhibited by caffeine. Which serine 216 kinase does caffeine affect in the nucleus? Both Chk1 and Chk2/Cds1 have been shown to localize to the nucleus and to phosphorylate serine 216 of Cdc25Cin vitro (13.Peng C.Y.

Although the phosphorylation state of Chk1 is altered in response to DNA damage (15.Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H. Elledge S.J. Science. 1997; 277: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (1123) Google Scholar), it does not correspond to an increase in its kinase activity toward Cdc25C. 2K. K. Khanna, S. Kozlov, and B. Gabrielli, unpublished results. It is still unclear whether Cdc25C is a substrate for Chk1 in vivo. On the other hand, Chk2/Cds1 kinase activity toward Cdc25C increases substantially after IR in an ATM-dependent manner (18.Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J.

To test the possibility that Chk2/Cds1 is a target for caffeine in abrogating the G2/M checkpoint, we determined whether ATM-dependent Chk2/Cds1 activation is inhibited by caffeine. Immunoprecipitate kinase assays were performed using total lysates prepared from normal (MRC-5) and A-T (AGO4405) cells treated with caffeine and then irradiated with 20 Gy of radiation using GST-Cdc25C as a substrate (21.Chaturvedi P. Eng W.-K. Zhu Y. Mattern M.R. Mishra R. Hurle M.R. Zhang X. Annan R.S. Lu Q. Faucette L.F. Scott G.F. Li X. Carr S.A. Johnson R.K., D., W.J. Zhou B.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4047-4054Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Lysates from cells that were untreated, treated with caffeine alone, and γ-irradiated alone were included in the assay as controls. As shown in Fig.3 A in normal cells, IR causes activation of Chk2/Cds1 (lane 2), and this activation is inhibited by prior treatment of cells with caffeine (lane 4). However, no such activation was found in A-T cells indicating that caffeine inhibited the ATM-dependent Chk2/Cds1 activation (Fig. 3 A, lanes 6 and 8). The Chk2 activity was also measured by an immunoassay using anti-phospho-S216 antibody (Fig. 3 B). Reaction mixtures identical to those used in the radioactive kinase assay were analyzed on 10% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and blotted with anti-phospho-S216. Serine 216 phosphorylation activity of Chk2 was clearly increased in response to DNA damage (Fig. 3 B,lane 2), and the increase was prevented by prior treatment of cells with caffeine (Fig. 3 B, lane 4). Again no effect of caffeine was found in A-T cells (Fig. 3 B,lane 8). To examine whether Chk2/Cds1 is a direct target of caffeine, an in vitro kinase assay was performed with recombinant Chk2 using GST-Cdc25C as a substrate in the presence or absence of increasing concentrations of caffeine. A kinase-dead mutant of Chk2 (D347A) was included as a negative control in the assay. Caffeine did not inhibit the kinase activity of Chk2 even at a concentration of 2 mm (Fig. 3 C) suggesting that Chk2 is not a direct target; instead, caffeine might inhibit either ATM kinase activity or the pathway leading to Chk2/Cds1 activation. Chk2/Cds1 activation after IR has been shown to depend on ATM kinase activity (18.Matsuoka S. Huang M. Elledge S.J.

To test the possibility that ATM can phosphorylate Chk2/Cds1 directly, active ATM was immunoprecipitated from normal human lymphoblastoid C3ABR cells that had been either γ-irradiated or mock-treated. ATM nonexpressing human A-T lymphoblast (L3) cells were used as a negative control. Because wild type Chk2 has a high level of autophosphorylation activity (data not shown), kinase-dead Chk2 mutant (D347A) was used as the substrate in the ATM kinase assay. As shown in Fig.4 A, ATM immunoprecipitated from C3ABR phosphorylated Chk2/Cds1 directly, and ATM activity increased by approximately 4-fold after radiation. In negative control A-T cells (L3), there is only background phosphorylation of Chk2. To analyze the location of phosphorylation, we expressed Chk2 as two separate domains: the N-terminal domain, containing amino acids 1–222; and the C-terminal domain (with D347A mutation to inactivate kinase activity), containing amino acids 206–543. As shown in Fig.4 A, most of the phosphorylation was in the N-terminal domain; there was very little in the C-terminal domain (D347A). Similarly constructed wild type C-terminal domain is kinase-active (data not shown), indicating that misfolding is not a cause of the lack of phosphorylation. Analysis of the Chk2/Cds1 sequence within this region revealed a cluster of serines (S) and threonines (T) followed by glutamine (Q) (SQ or"
https://openalex.org/W2082078624,"We have isolated a novel cell-cell adhesion system localized at cadherin-based adherens junctions (AJs). This system consists of at least nectin, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent immunoglobulin-like adhesion molecule, and afadin, an actin filament-binding protein, that connects nectin to the actin cytoskeleton. Nectin constitutes a family consisting of two members, nectin-1 and -2. We have isolated here a third member of the nectin family and named it nectin-3. Nectin-3 has three splicing variants, nectin-3α (biggest), -3β (middle), and -3γ (smallest). Like nectin-1 and -2, nectin-3α consists of three extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, a transmembrane segment, and a cytoplasmic region with the C-terminal consensus motif for binding to the PDZ domain. Nectin-3α formed a <i>cis</i>-homo-dimer and showed Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent <i>trans</i>-homo-interaction to cause homophilic cell-cell adhesion. Nectin-3α furthermore showed<i>trans</i>-hetero-interaction with nectin-1 or -2 but did not form a <i>cis-</i>hetero-dimer with nectin-1 or -2. Nectin-1 did not show <i>trans-</i>hetero-interaction with nectin-2. The affinity of <i>trans-</i>hetero-interaction of nectin-3α with nectin-1 or -2 was higher than that of<i>trans-</i>homo-interaction of nectin-1, -2, or -3α. Nectin-2 and -3 were ubiquitously expressed, whereas nectin-1 was abundantly expressed in brain. Nectin-3α was colocalized with nectin-2 at cadherin-based AJs and interacted with afadin. These results indicate that the nectin family consists of at least three members, nectin-1, -2, and -3, all of which show homophilic and heterophilic cell-cell adhesion activities and are localized at cadherin-based AJs."

Protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI) was up-regulated not only by hypoxia in glia in vitro, but also by transient forebrain ischemia in rats in vivo. To determine whether newly synthesized PDI is involved in tolerance to ischemic stress, we carried out two procedures to induce PDI gene expression in human neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cells, as well as intrahippocampal injection following electroporation of an expression vector capable of overexpressing PDI in rats. Overexpression of this gene resulted in attenuation of the loss of cell viability induced by hypoxia in neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cells and a reduction in the number of DNA-fragmented cells in the CA1 area of the hippocampus in brain ischemic rats, respectively. These findings suggest that up-regulated PDI may play a critical role in resistance to ischemic damage, and that the elevation of levels of this protein in the brain may have beneficial effects against brain stroke.

Brain Res. 1982; 239: 57-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (2524) Google Scholar). Neurons are thus thought to be fragile and very sensitive to such stress, and, as a consequence, apoptotic cell death occurs (2.Ferrer I. Tortoise A. Macaya A. Sierra A. Moreno D. Munell F. Blanco R.

Transgenic mice expressing dominant-negative mutants of caspase-1 and caspase-1-deficient mice show a reduced neuronal cell death induced by ischemic brain injury (4.Friedlander R.M. Gagliardini V.

Caspase inhibitors such as Z-VAD-fmk,1 YVAD-fmk, and DEVD-fmk also significantly reduce the neuronal cell death induced by ischemia (7.Loddick S.A. MacKenzie A. Rothwell N.J.

Furthermore, overexpression of Bcl-2 in transgenic mice as well as of neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, by injection of adenovirus expression vectors has a protective effect against the neuronal cell death induced by focal cerebral or transient forebrain ischemia (10.Martinou J.-C.

These results suggest that caspases are involved in ischemia-induced neuronal death in an anti-apoptotic protein-dependent manner. On the other hand, glial cells show tolerance to ischemic stress, and their numbers are increased in areas originally containing neurons. Due to their abundance and ability to sustain environmental perturbations, glia play a critical role in maintaining neuronal function under both physiological and pathological conditions (12.Swanson R.A. Choi D.W. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1993; 13: 162-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Glial cells subjected to hypoxia express stress proteins such as a 70-kDa heat shock protein (HSP70), a 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), a 150-kDa oxygen-regulated protein (ORP150), a 36-kDa putative RNA-binding protein (RA301), and a 70-kDa putative vesicle transport-related protein (RA410) (13.Hori O.

Indeed, the inhibition of ORP150 using antisense results in reduced cell viability in hypoxia-treated cells, suggesting that ORP150 has a protective effect against hypoxia-stimulated cellular stress (18.Ozawa K.

These observations indicate the possibility that the expression of several stress proteins in glial cells is partly implicated in the acquisition of tolerance against hypoxic or ischemic stress. In the present study, we attempted to isolate important molecules as protective factors against hypoxia in rat primary astrocytes. We found that protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI, EC 5.3.4.1) is up-regulated by hypoxia in rat primary astrocytes. Therefore, we assessed the protective potential of PDI by determining whether overexpression of this gene in vitro and in vivo renders neuronal cells more resistant to the damaging effects of hypoxic treatment and transient forebrain ischemia, respectively. Moreover, we attempted to characterize the possible critical sites in each thioredoxin-like domain. Primary astrocytes were prepared from the whole brain of neonatal Wistar rats as described previously (19.Simons M.L. Murphy S. J. Neurochem. 1992; 59: 897-905Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) with some modifications (20.Uehara T. Kaneko M. Tanaka S. Okuma Y. Nomura Y. Brain Res. 1999; 823: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were allowed to grow to confluence (12 days) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal calf serum, 50 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cultured cells were grown at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air. Subsequently, the cells were shaken at 120 rpm for 1 h at room temperature, and the adherent cells were cultured again for 6 days. The cells were then shaken to separate the astrocytes from the remaining microglia and oligodendrocytes, and they were then identified by immunohistochemical analysis with anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). The cell cultures were 95% positive for GFAP. Human neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum at 37 °C in humidified 5% CO2, 95% air. When the cells (astrocytes or SK-N-MC) became subconfluent, they were cultured in a mixture of 5% CO2 and the balance N2 in a humidified incubator (ANX-1, Hirasawa, Tokyo, Japan) at 37 °C within a sealed, anaerobic, gloved cabinet containing a catalyst to scavenge free oxygen as described previously (20.Uehara T. Kaneko M. Tanaka S. Okuma Y. Nomura Y. Brain Res. 1999; 823: 226-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21.Araya R. Uehara T. Nomura Y. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 168-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The oxygen levels in the cabinet were measured with a monitor sensitive to oxygen concentrations of <10 ppm. Two-dimensional separation of proteins on small format gels was carried out as described (22.Young D.A. Voris B.P. Maytin E.V. Colbert R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 91: 190-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 23.Voris B.P. Young D.A. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 104: 478-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, cytosolic proteins (10 μg) were first separated by isoelectric focusing in 1.5-mm × 7-cm rod gels containing 1.6% (w/v) ampholytes, pH 5–8 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 0.4% ampholytes, pH 3.5–10. First-dimension gels were attached to the top of 8 × 7 × 0.015-cm, 12% polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the gels were stained with silver. Cytosolic proteins from cells exposed to hypoxia were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The protein bands on the membranes were stained in a solution of 0.25% Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 in 7.5% methanol, 5% acetic acid in water and then rinsed in water. The ∼55-kDa protein was then cut out. The protein band was combined with its counterpart from three gels, transferred to 1.5-ml tubes, and then analyzed by Edman degradation using an automated protein sequencer (model 492, Applied Biosystems, CA). The sequences obtained were compared with those in the GenBank™ data base. Full-length PDI cDNA was isolated from rat astrocyte RNA by RT-PCR (24.Uehara T. Matsuno J. Kaneko M. Nishiya T. Fujimuro M. Yokosawa H. Nomura J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15875-15882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The primers used were: rat PDI (upstream), 5′-CGA CGT CCG ACA TGC TGA GCC-3′; rat PDI (downstream), 5′-GGC TTC TGC ACT ACA GTT CAT-3′. The three mutants of PDI were generated by the overlapping PCR method. Adult male Wistar rats (250–300 g; Charles River Laboratories) were used for all of the experiments. All animal procedures conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals of the Medical Research Council of Japan. Transient forebrain ischemia was produced by the four-vessel occlusion (4VO) method. Animals that showed convulsions during 4VO for 15 min, and after reperfusion, along with those that did not fully develop loss of righting reflex during ischemia, were omitted from the study. In the case of sham-treated animals, the carotid arteries were exposed but not occluded. Cell viability was estimated by two methods. Initially, viability was measured by the counting of stained viable cells for β-galactosidase activity derived from transfection of that gene. Briefly, 0.3 μg of lacZplus 1.25 μg of each PDI gene were co-transfected into SK-N-MC cells using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) and incubated for 24 h. After hypoxic challenge, cells were fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde for 10 min, rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and stained in 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) buffer (0.5 mg/ml X-gal, 4 mmK4[Fe(CN)6], 4 mmK3[Fe(CN)6], 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5) at 37 °C for 2 h. The number of stained blue cells in cultures challenged by hypoxiaversus that in normoxic cultures was counted by two investigators blind to the experimental treatments, and the results are expressed as the percentage of hypoxia/normoxia. As another strategy, the viability was estimated by the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage method using a Cytotoxicity Detection Kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. LDH activity was measured as the optimal density at 492 nm, and LDH leakage (%) was defined as the ratio of LDH activity in the culture medium to the total activity (% = (extracellular activity)/(extracellular activity + remaining cellular activity)). Rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg, intraperitoneal). For intrahippocampal injection, 2 μg of plasmid DNA (pcDNA3-PDI) was dissolved in 0.2 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5). The head of the rat was then fixed onto a stereotaxic operating table. The head skin was cut and retracted, and a burr hole was opened. The DNA was injected into the right hippocampal CA1 region (anterior: −3.2 mm, lateral: 1.5 mm, height: 2.4 mm from bregma) in a final volume of 0.2 μl (2 μg) using a cannula (27-gauge needle) connected by polyethylene tubing to a 1-μl Hamilton syringe. The injection rate was 0.1 μl/2 min, and the cannula was kept in place for an additional 10 min after injection. Subsequently, a pair of stainless steel electrodes (1.0 mm gap), 10 mm in length and 0.5 mm in diameter, was inserted into the CA1 region through the burr hole. Electric pulses were generated with a Square Electro Porator (CUY21, TR Tech, Tokyo, Japan) and were administered at 10 pulses/s (10 Hz). Electric pulses were 2 ms in duration at 45 V and less than 10 mA, and the electric field strength was 450 V/cm. PDI and GFAP were detected using a monoclonal antibody (RL90, Affinity Bioreagents) and a polyclonal antibody (Dako), respectively. Immunohistochemical analyses of PDI (dilution 1:500) and GFAP (dilution 1:50) were performed on free-floating cryostat sections (10 μm thick). The apoptotic cells were detected by TUNEL of nucleosomal fragments generated by endonuclease cleavage using a MEBSTAIN Apoptosis Kit II (MBL). All images were taken on a laser-scanning confocal microscope (LSM510; Carl Zeiss). We performed SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 staining to detect proteins newly synthesized or up-regulated in response to hypoxia (2% O2, 48 h) and subsequent reoxygenation (20% O2, ∼48 h) in rat primary astrocytes. During treatment with hypoxia/reoxygenation, the levels of several proteins were significantly enhanced after hypoxia (48 h)/reoxygenation (6 h) (data not shown). Therefore, we further carried out two-dimensional electrophoresis and amino acid sequencing methods using these samples. On silver-stained two-dimensional polyacrylamide gels of total cell lysates from astrocytes treated with hypoxia/reoxygenation, the densities of protein bands with molecular masses of ∼150, 95, 75, 60, and 55 kDa were increased in stress-treated cells (Fig.1 A). Since no protein of ∼55 kDa has been reported to be up-regulated in response to hypoxia/reoxygenation in astrocytes to date, we determined its N-terminal amino acid sequence using the automated Edman sequencing technique. The sequence of the N-terminal 20 amino acids of the ∼55-kDa protein was completely identical to N-terminal residues 20–39 of rat PDI (Fig. 1 B). Since PDI is specifically localized in the ER, it has a signal sequence from N-terminal residues 1–19. Hence, we believe that the coincidence between these sequences is sufficient to identify the ∼55-kDa protein as PDI. Northern blot analysis of RNA from cultured astrocytes using a 32P-labeled PDI cDNA probe showed that the PDI mRNA levels increased 24 h after hypoxic treatment; the levels of PDI mRNA reached a plateau at 48 h after hypoxia and 6 h after reoxygenation, decreasing gradually thereafter (Fig.2 A). Western blot analysis using anti-PDI monoclonal antibody (RL90) revealed a significant enhancement of PDI protein expression 24 h after hypoxia, which reached a maximum by 12–48 h after reoxygenation (Fig. 2 B). We next investigated whether other stresses can induce PDI. The levels of PDI were slightly enhanced by treatment with deferoxamine, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), or tunicamycin (Fig.2 C). Treatment with cobalt chloride (CoCl2) and heat shock, which increased levels of HSP70, had little effect on the expression of PDI. On the other hand, calnexin and calreticulin, which are closely related to PDI and are localized in the ER, were also up-regulated by treatment with hypoxia/reoxygenation (Fig.2 D). We next investigated the changes in PDI levels following transient forebrain ischemia in rats using the 4VO model. Initially, we investigated whether PDI mRNA levels are increased by 15-min brain ischemia in rats and characterized the localization of this increase in vivo. Fig. 3 A shows the results of the PDI mRNA induction in each area of the ischemic brain by the RT-PCR method. Under these analysis conditions (20 cycles of PCR), PDI mRNA was detected in the cerebral cortex, but not in the hippocampus, cerebellum, or other areas. Kinetic analysis indicated that PDI mRNA expression begins to increase 1 day after ischemic treatment (15-min occlusion followed by reperfusion), peaks 3 days after ischemia, and returns to basal levels 5 days after ischemia. To ascertain whether the up-regulation of PDI protein expression induced by brain ischemia in vivo correlates with the induction of its mRNA, we subsequently performed immunohistochemical analysis in brain slices using anti-PDI antibody. PDI antigen was weakly expressed in all areas of the non-ischemic brain (Fig. 3 B,left panel). In contrast, the immunoreactivity was markedly enhanced in the cerebral cortex of the ischemic brain, as shown in Fig. 3 A (Fig. 3 B, right panel). Moreover, double staining with anti-PDI and anti-GFAP antibodies showed that the PDI antigen induced by brain ischemia is primarily localized in GFAP-positive cells (Fig.3 C). In addition, PDI-positive cells overlap slightly with those positive for Ricinus communis agglutinin 1 (RCA1). 2T. Uehara, S. Tanaka, and Y. Nomura, unpublished data. To confirm the roles of PDI in neuronal cell death in vitro andin vivo, we investigated the effects of this molecule on hypoxia-induced cell death in human neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cells. Because PDI contains two thioredoxin-like domains (one near the N terminus and another near the C terminus), we constructed mutants with cysteine-to-serine mutations in both of the CGHC active site sequences to determine the domain critical to the cytoprotective effect. To address the ability of wild-type or mutated PDI to protect against hypoxia-induced cell death, we carried out two independent experiments, one involving the counting of β-galactosidase-positive cells and the other a LDH leakage assay on cell viability. In both assays, the transient expression of wild-type PDI resulted in a significant recovery of cell viability by hypoxia compared with mock transfectants (Fig. 4, B and C). However, none of the mutants (N-terminal, C-terminal, both N- and C-terminal double mutants) showed alterations in the loss of viability. As another strategy, we performed an intrahippocampal injection of a PDI expression vector followed by electroporation to overexpress this molecule in specific areas of the rat brain in vivo. To ascertain the efficiency of in vivo transfection, we initially transfected green fluorescent protein (GFP) or β-galactosidase gene into the CA1 area. A number of GFP- or β-galactosidase-expressing cells were seen in this area (data not shown). Subsequently, we carried out in vivo overexpression of the PDI gene in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. Transient forebrain ischemia (4VO) is known to induce delayed neuronal apoptotic death in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. We initially confirmed whether apoptotic neuronal death occurs after brain ischemia. TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells were clearly detected 7 days after ischemia (Fig.5 A). There were no significant differences in the TUNEL-positive cells between rats with or without mock transfection (Fig. 5, A (right panel) and B (c)). We next investigated whether the overexpression of PDI can attenuate DNA fragmentation in hippocampal neurons by 4VO. Twenty-four hours after transfection of the vector alone (mock) or the PDI gene expression vector into the hippocampus by electroporation, 4VO was performed for 15 min. To avoid the possibility of the observed effects being due to electroporation itself, we first examined the effects of transfection with the mock vector (pcDNA3.1). There were no differences in the number of living cells in this area between the non-transfected and mock-transfected rats (data not shown). In the mock-transfected rats, a significant number of TUNEL-positive cells in the CA1 area were detected 3 days after 4VO, with these numbers increasing dramatically thereafter (Fig. 5 B, a–c). In contrast, the numbers of DNA-fragmented (TUNEL-positive) cells in this area were remarkably reduced in the PDI-transfected rats (Fig. 5 B,d–f). Cell counts revealed that few TUNEL-positive cells were present 3 days after 4VO in PDI-transfected rats (Fig.5 C). Although apoptotic cells were detected at 5 and 7 days after 4VO in the PDI-transfected rats, the number of these cells was attenuated by approximately 50% compared with those of the mock-transfected rats (Fig. 5 C). The aim of this study was to isolate and identify proteins capable of protecting cells against ischemic stress using rat primary astrocytes. We found some candidates in the hypoxia-treated astrocytes by two-dimensional electrophoresis and amino acid sequencing. Several of these molecules have already been reported, including a 94-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP94). Since the protein of approximately ∼55-kDa had not been reported previously, we analyzed this protein further. The sequence of the N-terminal 20 amino acids of the ∼55-kDa protein was completely homologous to the N-terminal residues 20–39 of rat PDI (Fig. 1 B). PDI, a major protein present within the lumen of the ER, is known to catalyze the isomerization of both intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bonds, yielding apparently native structures (25.Freedman R.B. Brockway B.E. Lambert N. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1984; 12: 929-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 26.Roth R.A. Koshland M.E. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6594-6599Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and has a signal sequence comprising its N-terminal residues 1–19 (27.Edman J.C. Ellis L. Blacher R.W. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J. Nature. 1985; 317: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The ∼55-kDa protein identified here lacked this sequence, and we therefore believe that this sequence identity is sufficient to identify the 55-kDa protein as PDI. In the quiescent state, PDI is slightly expressed in primary astrocytes. However, exposure to hypoxia results in a significant enhancement of PDI mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 2,A and B). Deferoxamine and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) also caused the up-regulation of PDI in the present study, whereas the levels were very low compared with those induced by hypoxia. Neither cobalt chloride (CoCl2) nor heat shock, which can induce 70-kDa heat shock protein (HSP70) expression, altered PDI levels. These results suggest that the induction mechanisms of PDI and HSP70 are essentially different. In contrast, tunicamycin, which is known to be an ER stressor, enhances the levels of PDI and GRP78. GRP78, GRP94, and ORP150 induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation are localized specifically in the ER (13.Hori O. Matsumoto M. Maeda M. Kuwabara K. Ueda H. Ohtsuki T. Kinoshita T. Ogawa S. Stern D.M. Kamada T. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 973-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 14.Kuwabara K. Matsumoto M. Ikeda J. Hori O. Ogawa S. Maeda Y. Kitagawa K. Imuta N. Kinoshita T. Stern D.M.

Kamada T. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 1489-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), suggesting that several proteins localized in the ER may be up-regulated in response to hypoxia in astrocytes. In agreement with this hypothesis, both calnexin and calreticulin, which are localized in the ER and act as chaperones, were up-regulated by hypoxia (Fig.2 B). Based on these observations, we speculated that hypoxic stress induces the up-regulation of several proteins localized in the ER such as PDI, calnexin, and calreticulin. We examined whether PDI expression is enhanced in response to brain ischemia in vivo. Surprisingly, transient forebrain ischemia markedly elevated PDI mRNA levels in the cerebral cortex, but not in the hippocampus, cerebellum, or other areas (Fig.3 A). PDI was detected in the ischemic cortex from 1 to 3 days after 15 min of 4VO. Consistent with these RT-PCR results, PDI-like immunoreactivity was observed only in the cerebral cortex following brain ischemia. To address the localization of PDI-like immunoreactivity, we performed double staining of brain slices with anti-PDI and anti-GFAP antibodies. Most PDI-reactive cells were detected in GFAP-positive cells (Fig. 3 C). However, a small proportion of cells were double-positive for PDI and RCA1 (data not shown), suggesting that PDI expression is enhanced primarily in astrocytes and only slightly in microglia. Transient forebrain ischemia results in damage to neurons in the cerebral cortex, the CA1 area of the hippocampus, the reticular thalamus, and the striatum. At present, it is still unclear why PDI is up-regulated by ischemic stress in the cerebral cortex, but not the hippocampus and other areas. PDI up-regulation in the ischemic cortex may be involved at least partially in the acquisition of tolerance against ischemic stress by an as yet unidentified mechanism. To determine whether PDI plays a critical role in tolerance against ischemic stress, we investigated its effects on hypoxia-induced cell death and its possible active site. PDI is a modular protein that consists of domains a, b, b′, a′, and c (Fig.4 A; Refs. 27.Edman J.C. Ellis L. Blacher R.W. Roth R.A. Rutter W.J.

Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2587-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The a and a′ domains are similar to thioredoxin, and both contain the sequence -CGHC-, representing two independently acting catalytic sites for PDI activity (30.Hawkins H.C. Freedman R.B. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11725-11735Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To determine the protective roles of these catalytic active sites in cell death, constructs were made with cysteine-to-serine mutations in both the CGHC active site sequences. Transfection of the wild-type PDI (WT) gene into human neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cells significantly reversed the loss of cell viability triggered by hypoxia (Fig. 4, B andC). In contrast, none of the mutants reversed the loss of cell viability on hypoxic challenge. These results indicated that overexpressed PDI has a neuroprotective effect against hypoxia in neuronal cells, and that both thioredoxin-like domains are critical for this protective function against hypoxic stress. Finally, the overexpression of PDI in vivo was used to determine whether increased levels of this protein could reduce the damaging effects in the CA1 region of the hippocampus by transient brain ischemia. As a control, mock transfection with an empty vector was performed followed by 4VO, since electroporation itself may have been responsible for the observed neuroprotective effect against ischemic stress. However, the numbers of DNA-fragmented cells in the CA1 region after 4VO in rats were almost same between untransfected and mock-transfected brains, suggesting that in vivoelectroporation had no neuroprotective effect. On the other hand, the numbers of TUNEL-positive CA1 neurons were significantly reduced in the PDI-overexpressing ischemic brain, but not in mock transfectants (Fig.5). These observations suggest that overexpression of the PDI gene significantly suppresses ischemia-induced apoptosis in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. In summary, we have demonstrated here that PDI is up-regulated in response to hypoxia or transient forebrain ischemia in astrocytes. Furthermore, the overexpression of PDI in vitro and in vivo could confer resistance to hypoxic or ischemic injury. Because there have been some reports that PDI may act as a chaperone (36.Puig A.

Chem. 1996; 271: 33664-33669Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), this neuroprotective effect may be partly based on its chaperone activity. Ischemic stress results in the denaturation or unfolding of many proteins and also simultaneously induces several chaperones such as GRPs. Furthermore, ORP150 localized in the ER is induced by hypoxia and ischemia in astrocytes (14.Kuwabara K. Matsumoto M. Ikeda J. Hori O. Ogawa S. Maeda Y. Kitagawa K. Imuta N. Kinoshita T. Stern D.M.

These findings suggest that hypoxia or brain ischemia induces the expression of several stress proteins or chaperones localized in the ER, which may result in an acquisition of tolerance against these stresses. Hence, agents that up-regulate PDI expression in neurons may be therapeutically useful in brain ischemia. Finally, we constructed a new technique that enables researchers to efficiently transfect a particular gene in vivo using a square electroporator apparatus. This method has led us to the hypothesis that the overexpression of the PDI gene in the CA1 area could protect against the apoptotic cell death induced by brain ischemia. Therefore, the PDI possibly located in the ER may play a critical role in the protection against stresses."

The molecular basis of this lateral growth control is poorly understood. Collagen II subjected to fibril formation in vitro produced short and tapered tactoids with strong D-periodic banding. The maximal width of these tactoids varied over a broad range. By contrast, authentic mixtures of collagens II, IX, and XI yielded long and weakly banded fibrils, which, strikingly, had a uniform width of about 20 nm. The same was true for mixtures of collagens II and XI lacking collagen IX as long as the molar excess of collagen II was less than 8-fold. At higher ratios, the proteins assembled into tactoids coexisting with cartilage-like fibrils. Therefore, diameter control is an inherent property of appropriate mixtures of collagens II and XI. Collagen IX is not essential for this feature but strongly increases the efficiency of fibril formation. Therefore, this protein may be an important stabilizing factor of cartilage fibrils.

Therefore, this protein may be an important stabilizing factor of cartilage fibrils. polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis In vertebrates, hyaline cartilage occurs in specialized regions of the skeleton and comprises the structural tissue of other organs (e.g. the cartilaginous rings of the trachea or the avian sclera). In the skeleton, cartilaginous regions either are permanent (e.g. in articular joints) or form a transient tissue template during bone development. The main functions of hyaline cartilage are biomechanical in nature and, essentially, are performed by its extracellular matrix, which occupies the major fraction of the tissue volume. Two matrix suprastructures can easily be distinguished in cartilage by electron microscopy. First are the collagen-containing fibrils with a periodic banding pattern of D = 67 nm. The other component is the electron-lucent extrafibrillar matrix, which is rich in immobilized anionic charges. Despite a high degree of molecular organization of its major components, aggrecan and hyaluronan, the extrafibrillar cartilage matrix has no conspicuous morphological features. However, the anionic charges cause extensive binding of water, which results in the generation of substantial osmotic pressure. The fibrils serve as the essential tensile elements of the tissue and contain the swelling pressure exerted by the extrafibrillar matrix. Cartilage fibrils vary in their molecular organization, their width, and their orientation in the tissue in order to resist forces generated by external load. In adult articular cartilage, for example, thin fibrils near the joint cavity preferentially run parallel to the surface, since lateral forces predominate in this region. In the interterritorial regions of the deep zones, in contrast, wider fibrils are arranged perpendicularly to the surface to strengthen the tissue in the direction along the axis of the bones. A prominent feature of the fibrils in developing and in immature cartilage is their strictly uniform diameter of about 20 nm and their more random orientation. Cartilage fibrils are often referred to as collagen II fibrils, since this protein primarily occurs in cartilage, where it is an abundant structural component. The biochemical composition of cartilage fibrils, however, is not only far more complex but also is nonuniform. Molecular heterogeneity correlates well with morphological and functional diversity. Thinner fibrils, such as those of fetal hyaline cartilage, contain not only collagen II but also collagen XI (1.Mendler M. Eich-Bender S.G. Vaughan L. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. J.

Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 991-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), which can occur in proteoglycan form carrying a single dermatan sulfate chain. In adult articular cartilage, wider fibrils arise in which collagen IX-proteoglycan is less abundant or even lacking. Instead, this type of cartilage fibril is coated with decorin, another proteoglycan, which is substituted by a single glycosaminoglycan chain in mammals but in chickens can carry two dermatan sulfate chains (6.Blaschke U.K. Hedbom E. Bruckner P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30347-30353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, cartilage fibrils have a highly anionic surface, albeit more stably so if they contain covalently cross-linked collagen IX (7.Eyre D.R. Apone S. Wu J.-J. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 220: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 8.van der Rest M. Mayne R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1615-1618Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Decorin, in contrast, is easily removed from the fibril surface by treatment with chaotropic agents at moderate concentrations (9.Hagg R. Bruckner P. Hedbom E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), suggesting that decorin may be subject to greater turnover in the tissue than collagen IX. The biogenesis of the molecular, suprastructural, and functional complexity in cartilage fibrils is incompletely understood. Collagen IX and the cartilage version of collagen XI, a heterotrimer composed of α1(XI)-, α2(XI)-, and α3(XI)-chains, are almost specific for cartilage. Other molecules, such as decorin, are far more ubiquitous. The role of each constituent has been tracked by several approaches. Skeletal development was severely compromised by overexpression of normal collagen II in mice. In young animals with this genotype, growth cartilage was highly disorganized and, notably, contained abnormally wide fibrils with a strong banding pattern. This pointed toward a crucial importance of the correct molar proportions of cartilage collagens in fibrillogenesis (10.Garofalo S. Metsäranta M. Ellard J. Smith C. Horton W. Vuorio E. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3825-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A similar disorganization of cartilage matrix with uncharacteristically thick fibrils was seen in the cho/cho strain of mice (11.Seegmiller R.E. Fraser F.C. Sheldon H. J. Cell Biol. 1971; 48: 580-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 12.Li Y.F. Lacerda D.A. Warman M.L. Beier D.R. Yoshioka H. Ninomiya Y. Oxford J.T. Morris N.P. Andrikopoulos K. Ramirez F.

These animals are deficient in the expression of α1(XI)-polypeptides and their cartilage contained abnormal fibrils with impaired diameter control. Comparable cartilage abnormalities were caused by point mutations in the human genesCOL11A1 and COL11A2 in several families with Stickler syndrome, a severe form of chondrodysplasia (13.Rimoin D.L. Francomano C.A. Giedion A. Hall C. Kaitila I. Cohn D. Gorlin R. Hall J. Horton W. Krakow D. LeMerrer M. Lachman R. Mundlos S. Poznanski A.K. Sillence D. Spranger J. Warman M. Superti-Furga A. Wilcox W. Am. J. Med. Genet. 1998; 79: 376-382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The mutations resulted in amino acid substitutions for glycine residues in the α1(XI)- or α2(XI)-chains, respectively, that, in turn, led to an absence or a functional incompetence of collagen XI. An exon-skipping mutation in the COL11A2 gene, presumably causing production of shortened α2(XI)-chains, had similar consequences (14.Richards A.J. Yates J.R.W. Williams R. Payne S.J. Pope F.M.

Cell. 1995; 80: 431-438Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The exclusive association of collagen XI with thin cartilage fibrils was observed by immunoelectron microscopy (2.Keene D.R. Oxford J.T. Morris N.P. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1995; 43: 967-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, several lines of circumstantial evidence suggest that collagen XI is essential for the regulation of the lateral fibril growth (12.Li Y.F. Lacerda D.A. Warman M.L. Beier D.R. Yoshioka H. Ninomiya Y. Oxford J.T. Morris N.P. Andrikopoulos K. Ramirez F. Wardell B.B. Lifferth G.D. Teuscher C. Woodward S.R. Taylor B.A. Seegmiller R.E. Olsen B.R. Cell. 1995; 80: 423-430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Direct evidence for this concept came from studies of in vitro fibrillogenesis by mixtures of soluble cartilage collagens (16.Eikenberry E.F. Mendler M. Bürgin R. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. Kuettner K.E. Schleyerbach R. Peyron J.G. Hascall V.C. Articular Cartilage and Osteoarthritis. Raven Press, New York1992: 133-149Google Scholar). It was found that collagen XI was essential in restricting lateral growth to a uniform width of about 20 nm typical for fibrils of embryonic or immature cartilage. However, it remained open whether collagen XI is sufficient for this limitation. Here, we have answered this question. We have purified collagens II and XI from chick embryo chondrocyte cultures in their native and fibril competent state and have demonstrated that uniform 20-nm fibrils can be reconstitutedin vitro from solutions containing appropriate mixtures of the two collagens alone. In addition, we have gained further insight into how lateral growth beyond 20 nm may be controlled by collagen XI. Sternal chondrocytes from 17-day-old chick embryos were isolated and cultured as described (17.Mayne R. van der Rest M. Bruckner P. Schmid T.M. Haralson M.A. Hassell J.R. Extracellular matrix: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 73-97Google Scholar). Briefly, sterna from 17-day-old chick embryos were digested overnight with bacterial collagenase. Matrix-free chondrocytes were collected by centrifugation and embedded at a density of 2–3 × 106 cells/ml into gels containing 0.5% low melting agarose and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The medium was supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm pyruvate, 1 mm cysteine, 50 μg/ml sodium ascorbate and was changed every 2–3 days. 60 μg/ml β-aminopropionitrile was added to the medium to prevent lysyl oxidase-derived cross-linking. After 14 days, medium was removed, and the cultures were stored at −20 °C until use. An overview of the procedures used for collagen purification is shown in Fig. 1. After thawing, noncollagenous material was extracted from the agarose cultures at 18 °C with 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl (phosphate-buffered saline) and a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 100 mm aminocaproic acid, 10 mm benzamidine HCl, 50 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). Agarose pellets containing the collagens were recovered by centrifugation, and the supernatants were discarded. All of the following steps were performed at 4 °C. Collagens were solubilized subsequently with buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl. Collagens II, IX, and XI were precipitated by adding solid NaCl to give a final concentration of 4.5 m and were recovered by centrifugation (18,480 × g, 30 min). For experiments with authentic collagen mixtures, collagens II, IX, and XI prepared from the salt-precipitated proteins were dissolved in a minimal amount of 100 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.4m NaCl (storage buffer); were dialyzed against the same buffer; and were clarified by centrifugation before use. For chromatographic separation, the crude collagen pellets were dissolved in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 2 m urea and 100 mm NaCl, and were passed over a DEAE-cellulose column (3.5 × 11 cm, 100 ml, DE52; Whatman Ltd.) equilibrated with the same buffer. Most collagen IX was bound to the column, while collagens II and XI and residual collagen IX were recovered from the breakthrough fractions (fraction A in Fig. 1). After dialysis against 10 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, containing 2 m urea and 50 mm NaCl, fraction A proteins were applied to a carboxymethyl-cellulose column (3.5 × 11 cm, 100 ml, CM52; Whatman, Ltd.). Collagen II was recovered from the breakthrough fractions (fraction C), and collagen XI was eluted by a stepwise increase of NaCl to 0.5 m (fraction D). Collagen XI was further purified by dialyzing fraction D against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 2 m urea and 5 mm NaCl, followed by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose (1 × 7 cm). Collagen XI bound to the columns under these conditions and was eluted in pure form by buffer containing 0.2m NaCl (fraction F). Final purification of collagen II in fraction C was achieved by DEAE-cellulose chromatography in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 2 m urea and 5 mm NaCl. The pure protein was recovered from the breakthrough fractions (fraction E). Purified proteins in fractions E and F were dialyzed extensively against 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 m NaCl, and then precipitated by the addition of solid NaCl to a final concentration of 4.5 m. Following centrifugation, pellets were redissolved in storage buffer at appropriate concentrations and clarified by centrifugation. Solutions of pure collagen II or XI at appropriate concentrations or defined mixtures thereof were prepared in storage buffer. Samples (100 μl) were degassed under vacuum and then transferred to microcuvettes (Multi-microcell; light path, 1 cm; Beckman, Palo Alto, CA) and mixed with 100 μl of water at 4 °C. The cuvettes were sealed and placed into a spectrophotometer (Beckman UV 640, equipped with multicell holder Micro Auto 12), connected to a water bath at 37 °C. Turbidity was recorded at 313 nm. At various time points, aliquots of the samples were spotted onto Formvar/carbon-coated 400-mesh copper electron microscopy grids. Samples were allowed to adsorb for 2 min, and the grids were washed with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.2 m NaCl followed by distilled water. Negative staining with 2% uranyl acetate was for 2 min, and stained aggregates were examined by transmission electron microscopy (Philips EM 410) at 60 kV. Fibril dimensions were determined from electron micrographs, and magnifications were calibrated using the fibril banding pattern with a periodicity of D = 67 nm as an internal standard. Aliquots containing 1–3 μg of mixed collagens were diluted with 50 μl of 0.1 m HCl and digested with 0.1 μg of pepsin at 4 °C for 24 h. Samples were neutralized with 1 m NaOH, and concentrated SDS-PAGE1 sample buffer was added to give a final concentration of 2% SDS. Collagens were separated by SDS-PAGE in 4.5–15% polyacrylamide gradient gels. After electrophoretic separation, the gels were stained with Coomassie Blue, and a densitometric quantification was performed on an Omni Media XRS scanner (MWG-Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany) and the Whole Band Analyser image software (Bio ImageTM version 3.2; MWG-Biotech). Collagen concentrations were calibrated on each gel by running in parallel standard samples of pepsin-digested, purified chicken collagen II with known concentrations as determined by circular dichroism at 221 nm (8,500 degrees·cm2/dmol (18.Bächinger H.P. Bruckner P. Timpl R. Prockop D.J. Engel J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 106: 619-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar)). The quantities of collagens II and XI in the samples applied to the gels were estimated by the relative intensities of the α1(II)- and the α1(XI)-band, respectively, assuming similar staining intensity for all collagen chains. Within the accuracy of the procedures used, relative mass and molar concentrations are equivalent for collagens II and XI. Collagen IX was purified from an authentic mixture of cartilage collagens by ion exchange chromatography on DEAE-cellulose (Fig. 1). The protein (fraction B) still contained small amounts of α1(II)-chains as judged by SDS-PAGE after staining with Coomassie Blue (Fig. 1 B,lanes 3 and 4). Pure collagen II does not bind to DEAE-cellulose under the conditions applied. Therefore, the contaminant α1(II)-chains could be derived from triple helical collagen II-molecules in which at least one chain is covalently bound to collagen IX (7.Eyre D.R. Apone S. Wu J.-J. Ericsson L.H. Walsh K.A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 220: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 8.van der Rest M. Mayne R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 23007-23014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), thereby liberating free α1(II) chains after denaturation in the presence of SDS. β-Components,i.e. dimers of covalently cross-linked collagen polypeptides, were apparent in SDS-PAGE after reduction of the disulfide bonds of collagen IX (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). Thus, covalent cross-linking was a likely explanation for our inability to eliminate the residual collagen II under conditions preserving the native and fibril-competent structure of the proteins. The chemistry of the cross-linking is not easily explained, since lysyl oxidase activity should have been effectively inhibited by 60 μg/ml of the lathyrogen β-aminopropionitrile in the culture medium. However, substantially more collagen could be extracted from cultures treated with the lathyrogen. Further, the quantity of β-components in crude collagen preparations was drastically reduced when β-aminopropionitrile was added to the culture medium. Increasing this supplement up to 100 μg/ml was tolerated by the chondrocytes but did not further reduce cross-linking. Thus the single experiment described below that involved collagen IX was performed with the partially purified preparation (fraction B). The other cartilage collagens, i.e. types II and XI, were purified to essential homogeneity by subjecting crude collagen mixtures to a scheme of consecutive steps of ion exchange chromatography as outlined in Fig. 1 A. This led to preparations of native collagens II and XI that were not only free of other collagen types (Fig. 1 B, lanes 2 and 5) but also retained their competence to undergo fibrillogenesis in vitro (see below). Even at concentrations above 4 mg/ml, the proteins did not contain proteoglycans or glycosaminoglycans detectable by standard procedures using dimethylene blue. In this way, contamination by glycosaminoglycans at levels of 1 part per 1000 would have been detected (20.Farndale R.W. Buttle D.J. Barrett A.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 883: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2907) Google Scholar). Collagen XI appeared as several bands on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 B,lane 5). However, this electrophoretic pattern was converted to a single heterotrimer of α1(XI)-, α2(XI)-, and α3(XI)-polypeptides upon treatment with pepsin (Fig. 1 B,lane 7), which results in the removal of the entire amino-terminal propeptide domain. During and after incorporation into cartilage fibrils in situ, collagen XI undergoes several successive steps of proteolytic processing within the amino-terminal propeptide domain (21.Morris N.P. Bächinger H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11345-11350Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Thom J.R. Morris N.P. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 9478-9485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26.Zhidkova N.I. Justice S.K. Mayne R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9486-9493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), resulting in several matrix forms of the protein. Interestingly, the α3(XI)-polypeptide of our purified collagen XI preparation was distinctly less mobile in SDS-PAGE than the α1(II)-chain (Fig. 1 B, comparelanes 2 and 5), although the two polypeptides are products of the same gene (27.Sheffield V.C. Upholt W.B. Collagen Relat. Res. 1985; 5: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This suggested that the amino-terminal propeptide domain was retained in α3(XI)-chains but not in α1(II)-chains. As expected, therefore, most of the difference in electrophoretic mobility between α1(II)- and α3(XI)-chains was eliminated by pepsin-treatment. The small remaining difference presumably is due to the more extensive post-translational modification of collagen XI. Therefore, the material was suitable for fibril reconstitution experiments in vitro, since it included several, if not all, states of processing as they occur in the newly deposited matrix in chondrocyte cultures in agarose. Native collagens IX or XI were soluble at concentrations adequate for fibrillogenesis experiments neither in dilute acids nor in neutral buffers with a quasiphysiological composition. However, the proteins were well solubilized in 100 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.4, containing 400 mm NaCl (storage buffer). Their final concentrations were 1–2 mg/ml as determined by densitometric analysis of SDS-PAGE patterns after pepsin digestion. Samples of pepsin-treated collagen II, at concentrations determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy (18.Bächinger H.P. Bruckner P. Timpl R. Prockop D.J. Engel J. Eur. J.

The solutions in storage buffer did not contain aggregated collagens observable by electron microscopy after negative staining (not shown). In vitro fibrillogenesis was initiated by diluting appropriate mixtures of collagen solutions in storage buffer with equal volumes of distilled water and by warming the reaction mixtures to 37 °C. Aggregation was followed by monitoring turbity at 313 nm. At given intervals, the newly formed fibrillar aggregates were examined by electron microscopy after negative staining.

In our hands (Fig.2), collagen II solutions gave rise to turbidity development at concentrations above 100 μg/ml, but the final values of turbidity were not easily determined, since the aggregates tended to precipitate from the solutions rather than to yield uniform gels. Characteristically, however, a prominent lag phase of about 2 h occurred in which neither light-scattering gels nor aggregate structures recognizable in the electron microscope were formed. The morphology of the aggregates emerging after the lag period was profoundly different from that of chick embryo cartilage fibrils. Instead of the unbanded, cylindrical objects found in tissues with a uniform width of about 20 nm and indefinite length, tactoids were seen that had tapering ends (Fig.3 A) and maximal diameters of up to 2 μm. No diameter control was apparent. The tactoids also displayed a strong D-periodic banding with a pattern characteristic for fibrils of collagen (32.Hodge A.J. Petruska J.A. Ramachandran G.N. Aspects of Protein Structure. Academic Press, Inc., New York1963: 289-300Google Scholar). The fine structure in the banding pattern persisted throughout the tactoids, indicating that the polarity of the collagen II molecules within the tactoids was uniform.Figure 3Electron micrographs showing fibrils formedin vitro by self-assembly of different mixtures of cartilage collagens after completion of turbidity development.

Eich-Bender S.G. Vaughan L. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), and fibrils in the newly formed extracellular matrix of our chondrocyte cultures are closely similar in appearance and collagen composition (33.Bruckner P.

Therefore, the unfractionated mixture of cartilage collagens II, IX, and XI extracted from the cultures was subjected to in vitro fibrillogenesis. In such mixtures, turbidity developed without a lag period and reached half-maximal values after t 12 = 10–14 min, regardless of total collagen concentrations (Fig.4 A). The amplitude of the plateau levels, however, depended linearly on total collagen concentrations (Fig. 4 B). As reported earlier (16.Eikenberry E.F. Mendler M. Bürgin R. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. Kuettner K.E. Schleyerbach R. Peyron J.G. Hascall V.C. Articular Cartilage and Osteoarthritis. Raven Press, New York1992: 133-149Google Scholar), thin and faintly banded fibrils were apparent in the electron microscope that strikingly resembled authentic cartilage fibrils (Fig. 3 B). Lateral growth appeared to be tightly regulated, which resulted in uniform fibrils of 21.3 ± 0.6 nm (n = 225) width. This value agrees with our previous results (19.7 ± 4.7 nm (16.Eikenberry E.F. Mendler M. Bürgin R. Winterhalter K.H. Bruckner P. Kuettner K.E. Schleyerbach R. Peyron J.G. Hascall V.C. Articular Cartilage and Osteoarthritis. Raven Press, New York1992: 133-149Google Scholar)) and is only slightly larger than the value seen in authentic cartilage fibrils (16.7 ± 1.1 nm (5.Vaughan L. Mendler M. Huber S. Bruckner P. Winterhalter K.H. Irwin M.I. Mayne R. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 991-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar)). Thus, either collagen IX or collagen XI, or both, seemed to be essential for the stringent diameter control. Solutions of collagen IX alone generated neither turbidity increases nor aggregate structures discernible in the electron microscope (not shown). Collagen XI alone, like native collagen mixtures, produced turbidity curves without lag periods at all concentrations investigated (Fig. 4 C). Half-maximal turbidity was reached at t 12 = 10 min. Plateau levels of turbidity were linearly dependent on collagen XI concentration (not shown). However, up to the maximal value of 350 μg/ml investigated,t 12 and the overall shape of the turbidity curves were concentration-independent. In striking contrast to collagen II, collagen XI precipitated from solution immediately after reduction of the salinity. This took place already at low temperatures and without a threshold concentration and resulted in the formation of flexible filaments (not shown). This readily explained the initial, kinetically unresolved onset of turbidity, whi"

The use of conditionally expressed viral oncogenes led to the definition of two separate mechanisms regulating this phenomenon (3.Wright W.E. Pereira-Smith O.M. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3088-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Mortality stage 1 (M1)1occurs when the functional activation of pathways requiring both p53 and pRB causes the growth arrest associated with cellular senescence (4.Shay J.W. Pereira-Smith O.M. Wright W.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 196: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 5.Hara E. Tsurui H. Shinozaki A. Nakada S. Oda K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 528-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Viral oncogenes that bind and inactivate p53 and pRB block M1 and permit continued cell division for an additional 20–40 doublings until an independent blockade to cell proliferation, the M2 mechanism, occurs. The balance of cell division and cell death at M2 (crisis) eventually tips in favor of cell death, so that the culture deteriorates and is generally lost. In human fibroblast cultures, some clones can spontaneously escape M2 and become immortal at a frequency of approximately 10−7 (6.Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 184: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar).DNA polymerase α cannot replicate the very end of a linear chromosome (7.Olovnikov A.M. J. Theor.

Nature. 1972; 239: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and consequently the compensatory action of telomerase is required to maintain telomere length. Because telomerase is turned off in most human tissues during development (9.Wright W.E. Piatyszek M.A. Rainey W.E. Byrd W. Shay J.W. Dev. Genet. 1996; 18: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar) and cultured human fibroblasts lack telomerase activity (10.Counter C.M. Avilion A.A. LeFeuvre C.E. Stewart N.G. Greider C.W.

Weinrich S.L. Shay J.W. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (6496) Google Scholar), telomeres shorten progressively with ongoing cell divisions. A causal relationship between telomere shortening and proliferative limits was firmly established by the demonstration that telomere shortening controlled M2 (12.Wright W.E. Brasiskyte D. Piatyszek M.A. Shay J.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1734-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Telomerase was repressed in hybrids between normal young fibroblasts with long telomeres and SV40 T-antigen immortalized fibroblasts whose telomeres had been experimentally manipulated to an average size of either 2.5 or 5 kb. The 20 extra population doublings obtained in the hybrids with the 5-kb starting telomere length established that telomere length was the limiting factor (12.Wright W.E. Brasiskyte D. Piatyszek M.A. Shay J.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1734-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Since T-antigen would have blocked the M1 mechanism in these hybrids, these results showed that telomere shortening controlled the onset of the M2 mechanism. The demonstration that inhibiting telomerase activity by antisense inhibition of the integral RNA component of telomerase caused proliferative failure in HeLa cells also suggested a causal relationship between telomere shortening and M2 (13.Feng J. Funk W.D. Wang S.S. Weinrich S.L. Avilion A.A. Chiu C.P. Adams R.R. Chang E. Allsopp R.C., Yu, J. Le S. West M.D. Harley C.B. Andrews W.H. Greider C.W. Villeponteau B. Science. 1995; 269: 1236-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar). These conclusions were recently further extended by the observation that expressing an exogenous telomerase in cells infected with the viral oncoproteins that inactivate p53 and pRB prevented the occurrence of the M2 mechanism (14.Zhu J.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1864-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).The ability of an exogenous telomerase to extend the lifespan of normal human diploid cells (17.Vaziri H. Benchimol S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 279-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 18.Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chui C.-P. Morin G.B. Harley C.B. Shay J.W. Lichsteiner S. Wright W.E. Science. 1998; 279: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4067) Google Scholar) established that telomere shortening also controlled the onset of the M1 mechanism of cellular senescence. The current synthesis of the relationship of telomere shortening to M1 and M2 is that the repression of telomerase results in telomere shortening until the M1 mechanism occurs. There are two current hypotheses for the induction of M1. 1) One or a few of the 92 telomeres in a normal cell have shortened sufficiently so that their ends are no longer masked and they generate a DNA damage signal (19.Harley C.B. Mutat. Res. 1991; 256: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar), and 2) there might be regulatory loci in subtelomeric regions that are silenced when telomeres are long but which are able to be expressed upon sufficient telomere shortening (20.Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 193-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). If the consequent growth arrest is circumvented by blocking the actions of p53 and pRB/p16, cells can continue to proliferate and telomeres continue to shorten until they become so short that they are no longer hidden from the DNA repair apparatus and end-to-end fusions result in the M2 mechanism in which apoptosis balances cell division. Cells then escape the M2 mechanism only if they develop a method for maintaining telomeres, either through the derepression of telomerase (10.Counter C.M. Avilion A.A. LeFeuvre C.E. Stewart N.G. Greider C.W. Harley C.B. Bacchetti S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1921-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar) or by the activation of an alternative pathway that probably involves recombination (21.Pluta A.F. Zakian V.A. Nature. 1989; 337: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 22.Lundblad V. Blackburn E.H. Cell. 1993; 73: 347-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 23.Bryan T.M. Englezou A. Gupta J. Bacchetti S. Reddel R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4240-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar).In this report, we describe the long term behavior of some of the human fibroblasts originally described as showing an extended lifespan following the introduction of an exogenous hTERT (18.Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chui C.-P. Morin G.B. Harley C.B. Shay J.W. Lichsteiner S. Wright W.E. Science. 1998; 279: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4067) Google Scholar). Our results suggest there may be cis-acting mechanisms to preferentially recruit telomerase to maintain the shortest telomeres under conditions of limiting telomerase activity. The consequent reduction of average telomere length to sizes less than that observed in senescent cells argues against a role for telomere positional effects controlling subtelomeric loci that cause the growth arrest observed at M1. Additional observations suggest that telomerase does not have a capping function on very short telomeres that is independent of its catalytic activity.DISCUSSIONThese results show that normal human fibroblasts expressing a transfected hTERT cDNA gradually showed reduced telomerase activity and decreasing telomere lengths. After 150–300 population doublings, the telomeres stabilized at subsenescent lengths and in some cases have remained at that size for over 150 additional doublings, and thus the cells are still functionally immortal. Analysis of these cells suggests several important interpretations. 1) The observed change in the distribution of telomere sizes implies the presence of cis-acting factors that preferentially recruit telomerase to act on the shortest telomeres; 2) the ability of cells with subsenescent telomere length to proliferate for 20 doublings following the abolition of telomerase activity argues against telomerase having a “capping” function independent of catalytic activity; and 3) the proliferation of normal cells with subsenescent telomere lengths provides evidence against the induction of growth arrest by subtelomeric regulatory loci silenced by long telomeres.The cells used in the present study had been transfected with a plasmid-based hTERT expression vector and showed a progressive decrease in telomerase activity over time. Although the resumption of telomere shortening was thus expected, the stabilization of telomeres at lengths approximately 2–4 kb shorter than that normally observed in senescent cells was surprising. The size of the shortest telomeres was maintained in multiple different clones over many months during which the longest telomeres continued to shorten. Despite the fact that all of the telomeres were sufficiently short to be expected to provide cis-acting signals, under conditions of limiting telomerase activity the shortest telomeres were preferentially maintained. Possible explanations include a more efficient recruitment of telomerase to the shortest telomeres, and loss of cells with the shortest telomeres and selection of the survivors.A very large number of proteins have been found to influence telomere length in yeast (reviewed in Ref. 36.Muniyappa K. Kironmai K.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 297-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and many of them are telomere-binding proteins. The most compelling evidence for cis-regulation of telomere length is for Rap1, where it has been shown that length is controlled by the number of Rap1 binding sites (37.Ray A. Runge K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 38.Marcand S. Gilson E. Shore D. Science. 1997; 275: 986-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Preferential action of telomerase on the shortest telomeres has recently been demonstrated in yeast (39.Marcand S. Brevet V. Gilson E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Results using hTRF1, the human orthologue of Rap1, have also implicated it as a cis-acting factor influencing human telomere length control (40.van Steensel B. de Lange T. Nature. 1997; 385: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the cis-acting telomere-binding proteins present in normal human cells are not only able to cause telomerase to act on the telomeres, but do so in a quantitative fashion that preferentially recruits it to the shortest telomeres despite the presumed presence of signals from other very short but nonetheless longer telomeres.An alternate interpretation is that telomerase is randomly acting on all telomeres, and that selection is producing the observed result. Cells in which telomerase acted on long but not short telomeres would become senescent and be lost from the population, while cells in which telomerase acted on short telomeres would continue to divide. When analyzing the entire population, the effect of this selection would be the apparent preservation of short telomere lengths while long telomeres shortened. Experiments in which chromosomes are broken by insertion of a plasmid with telomeric repeats on one end have shown that the telomere on the “healed chromosome” elongates while the length of the endogenous telomeres remain unaffected (41.Sprung C.N. Sabatier L. Murnane J.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Under conditions in which telomerase is not limiting, this shows that in human cells telomerase can preferentially be recruited to act on a telomere that is too short. We believe that it is likely that the same mechanisms that recruit telomerase to act on these “too short” healing chromosomes would act to preferentially recruit limiting amounts of telomerase to the shortest chromosomes, and thus prefer recruitment rather than selection as an explanation for these observations.Telomerase has been proposed to perform a capping function on short telomeres that requires catalytic activity (14.Zhu J. Wang H. Bishop J.M. Blackburn E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3723-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Telomerase activity became undetectable in two clones following the introduction of the D869A hTERT mutant in B14 cells. These cells with very short telomeres divided for 20 additional doublings in the presence of the mutant hTERT before undergoing a growth arrest. The telomere shortening that occurred during these 20 doublings demonstrates that catalytically active telomerase was not present for a significant fraction of time on most of the telomeres. The replacement of wild-type telomerase with the dominant-negative mutant argues against a “capping” role for the telomerase protein on short telomeres that requires catalytic activity but is independent of the actual addition of TTAGGG repeats to the ends of the chromosomes. The ability of limiting amounts of catalytically active telomerase to preferentially maintain the shortest telomeres, so that average size decreases while minimum size does not, provides a sufficient explanation for the presence of subsenescent (this report) or subcrisis (14.Zhu J. Wang H. Bishop J.M. Blackburn E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3723-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) telomere lengths.We have previously proposed that genes regulating cellular senescence might be located in subtelomeric regions, and that their expression might be controlled by changes in telomere positional effects as telomeres shortened (20.Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 193-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The present result demonstrates that these cultures continue to proliferate vigorously even though telomere sizes decreased to well below their normal lengths at senescence. This provides evidence against the re-expression of previously silenced genes that induce a growth arrest when telomeres become sufficiently short, and favors the hypothesis that it is the generation of a DNA damage signal from an insufficiently long telomere(s) that causes M1 (19.Harley C.B. Mutat. Res. 1991; 256: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Several previous reports have failed to find evidence of telomere positional effects in vertebrate cells (42.Bayne R.A. Broccoli D. Taggart M.H. Thomson E.J. Farr C.J. Cooke H.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 43.Sprung C.N. Sabatier L. Murnane J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4336-4340Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although we now think it unlikely that telomere positional effects regulate the onset of M1, we continue to entertain the possibility that telomere shortening might regulate gene expression in ways that permit the counting of cell divisions to be used as a mechanism for timing decades-long processes during the human life span (44.Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 293-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).The concept that short telomeres increase the efficiency with which they recruit telomerase leads to the speculation that very efficient inhibition of telomerase might be required for anti-telomerase cancer therapy to be successful. It also raises the possibility that a combination of interventions inhibiting both the catalytic activity of telomerase as well as its ability to be recruited to telomeres might be much more successful than either alone. It is important to remember that (in contrast to germline cells) adult human somatic cells are not biologically programmed to maintain telomere length, and that the expression and function of an unknown number of accessory factors may have been altered in different somatic cells that have repressed telomerase. We anticipate that the factors that modify telomerase, recruit it to the telomeres, cause it to catalyze the addition of telomeric repeats, and regulate the number of repeats added at one time will show significant variability in levels and efficiencies between different normal cell types, and that this variability will be compounded in cancer cells. The consequences of expressing telomerase in an “inappropriate” biological context, either via an exogenous cDNA or through the mutational inactivation of repressive pathways, are thus likely to be diverse as well. Disentangling these multiple mechanisms should increase our ability to alter telomere length regulation for modifying the time course of replicative aging and in the treatment of cancer. Normal human fibroblasts have a limited ability to proliferate in culture (1.Hayflick L. Exp. Cell Res. 1965; 37: 614-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (4229) Google Scholar, 2.Hayflick L. Moorhead P.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1961; 25: 585-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (5381) Google Scholar). The use of conditionally expressed viral oncogenes led to the definition of two separate mechanisms regulating this phenomenon (3.Wright W.E. Pereira-Smith O.M. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 3088-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Mortality stage 1 (M1)1occurs when the functional activation of pathways requiring both p53 and pRB causes the growth arrest associated with cellular senescence (4.Shay J.W. Pereira-Smith O.M. Wright W.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 196: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 5.Hara E. Tsurui H. Shinozaki A. Nakada S. Oda K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 528-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Viral oncogenes that bind and inactivate p53 and pRB block M1 and permit continued cell division for an additional 20–40 doublings until an independent blockade to cell proliferation, the M2 mechanism, occurs. The balance of cell division and cell death at M2 (crisis) eventually tips in favor of cell death, so that the culture deteriorates and is generally lost. In human fibroblast cultures, some clones can spontaneously escape M2 and become immortal at a frequency of approximately 10−7 (6.Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 184: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). DNA polymerase α cannot replicate the very end of a linear chromosome (7.Olovnikov A.M. J. Theor.

Nature. 1972; 239: 197-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and consequently the compensatory action of telomerase is required to maintain telomere length. Because telomerase is turned off in most human tissues during development (9.Wright W.E. Piatyszek M.A. Rainey W.E. Byrd W. Shay J.W. Dev. Genet. 1996; 18: 173-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1130) Google Scholar) and cultured human fibroblasts lack telomerase activity (10.Counter C.M. Avilion A.A. LeFeuvre C.E. Stewart N.G. Greider C.W.

Weinrich S.L. Shay J.W. Science. 1994; 266: 2011-2015Crossref PubMed Scopus (6496) Google Scholar), telomeres shorten progressively with ongoing cell divisions. A causal relationship between telomere shortening and proliferative limits was firmly established by the demonstration that telomere shortening controlled M2 (12.Wright W.E. Brasiskyte D. Piatyszek M.A. Shay J.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1734-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Telomerase was repressed in hybrids between normal young fibroblasts with long telomeres and SV40 T-antigen immortalized fibroblasts whose telomeres had been experimentally manipulated to an average size of either 2.5 or 5 kb. The 20 extra population doublings obtained in the hybrids with the 5-kb starting telomere length established that telomere length was the limiting factor (12.Wright W.E. Brasiskyte D. Piatyszek M.A. Shay J.W. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1734-1741Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Since T-antigen would have blocked the M1 mechanism in these hybrids, these results showed that telomere shortening controlled the onset of the M2 mechanism. The demonstration that inhibiting telomerase activity by antisense inhibition of the integral RNA component of telomerase caused proliferative failure in HeLa cells also suggested a causal relationship between telomere shortening and M2 (13.Feng J. Funk W.D. Wang S.S. Weinrich S.L. Avilion A.A. Chiu C.P. Adams R.R. Chang E. Allsopp R.C., Yu, J. Le S. West M.D. Harley C.B. Andrews W.H. Greider C.W. Villeponteau B. Science. 1995; 269: 1236-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2060) Google Scholar). These conclusions were recently further extended by the observation that expressing an exogenous telomerase in cells infected with the viral oncoproteins that inactivate p53 and pRB prevented the occurrence of the M2 mechanism (14.Zhu J.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1864-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The ability of an exogenous telomerase to extend the lifespan of normal human diploid cells (17.Vaziri H. Benchimol S. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 279-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar, 18.Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chui C.-P. Morin G.B. Harley C.B. Shay J.W. Lichsteiner S. Wright W.E. Science. 1998; 279: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4067) Google Scholar) established that telomere shortening also controlled the onset of the M1 mechanism of cellular senescence. The current synthesis of the relationship of telomere shortening to M1 and M2 is that the repression of telomerase results in telomere shortening until the M1 mechanism occurs. There are two current hypotheses for the induction of M1. 1) One or a few of the 92 telomeres in a normal cell have shortened sufficiently so that their ends are no longer masked and they generate a DNA damage signal (19.Harley C.B. Mutat. Res. 1991; 256: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar), and 2) there might be regulatory loci in subtelomeric regions that are silenced when telomeres are long but which are able to be expressed upon sufficient telomere shortening (20.Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 193-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). If the consequent growth arrest is circumvented by blocking the actions of p53 and pRB/p16, cells can continue to proliferate and telomeres continue to shorten until they become so short that they are no longer hidden from the DNA repair apparatus and end-to-end fusions result in the M2 mechanism in which apoptosis balances cell division. Cells then escape the M2 mechanism only if they develop a method for maintaining telomeres, either through the derepression of telomerase (10.Counter C.M. Avilion A.A. LeFeuvre C.E. Stewart N.G. Greider C.W. Harley C.B. Bacchetti S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1921-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (1921) Google Scholar) or by the activation of an alternative pathway that probably involves recombination (21.Pluta A.F. Zakian V.A. Nature. 1989; 337: 429-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 22.Lundblad V. Blackburn E.H. Cell. 1993; 73: 347-360Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar, 23.Bryan T.M. Englezou A. Gupta J. Bacchetti S. Reddel R.R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4240-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (1094) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the long term behavior of some of the human fibroblasts originally described as showing an extended lifespan following the introduction of an exogenous hTERT (18.Bodnar A.G. Ouellette M. Frolkis M. Holt S.E. Chui C.-P. Morin G.B. Harley C.B. Shay J.W. Lichsteiner S. Wright W.E. Science. 1998; 279: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (4067) Google Scholar). Our results suggest there may be cis-acting mechanisms to preferentially recruit telomerase to maintain the shortest telomeres under conditions of limiting telomerase activity. The consequent reduction of average telomere length to sizes less than that observed in senescent cells argues against a role for telomere positional effects controlling subtelomeric loci that cause the growth arrest observed at M1. Additional observations suggest that telomerase does not have a capping function on very short telomeres that is independent of its catalytic activity. DISCUSSIONThese results show that normal human fibroblasts expressing a transfected hTERT cDNA gradually showed reduced telomerase activity and decreasing telomere lengths. After 150–300 population doublings, the telomeres stabilized at subsenescent lengths and in some cases have remained at that size for over 150 additional doublings, and thus the cells are still functionally immortal. Analysis of these cells suggests several important interpretations. 1) The observed change in the distribution of telomere sizes implies the presence of cis-acting factors that preferentially recruit telomerase to act on the shortest telomeres; 2) the ability of cells with subsenescent telomere length to proliferate for 20 doublings following the abolition of telomerase activity argues against telomerase having a “capping” function independent of catalytic activity; and 3) the proliferation of normal cells with subsenescent telomere lengths provides evidence against the induction of growth arrest by subtelomeric regulatory loci silenced by long telomeres.The cells used in the present study had been transfected with a plasmid-based hTERT expression vector and showed a progressive decrease in telomerase activity over time. Although the resumption of telomere shortening was thus expected, the stabilization of telomeres at lengths approximately 2–4 kb shorter than that normally observed in senescent cells was surprising. The size of the shortest telomeres was maintained in multiple different clones over many months during which the longest telomeres continued to shorten. Despite the fact that all of the telomeres were sufficiently short to be expected to provide cis-acting signals, under conditions of limiting telomerase activity the shortest telomeres were preferentially maintained. Possible explanations include a more efficient recruitment of telomerase to the shortest telomeres, and loss of cells with the shortest telomeres and selection of the survivors.A very large number of proteins have been found to influence telomere length in yeast (reviewed in Ref. 36.Muniyappa K. Kironmai K.M. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1998; 33: 297-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and many of them are telomere-binding proteins. The most compelling evidence for cis-regulation of telomere length is for Rap1, where it has been shown that length is controlled by the number of Rap1 binding sites (37.Ray A. Runge K.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 38.Marcand S. Gilson E. Shore D. Science. 1997; 275: 986-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Preferential action of telomerase on the shortest telomeres has recently been demonstrated in yeast (39.Marcand S. Brevet V. Gilson E. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3509-3519Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Results using hTRF1, the human orthologue of Rap1, have also implicated it as a cis-acting factor influencing human telomere length control (40.van Steensel B. de Lange T. Nature. 1997; 385: 740-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the cis-acting telomere-binding proteins present in normal human cells are not only able to cause telomerase to act on the telomeres, but do so in a quantitative fashion that preferentially recruits it to the shortest telomeres despite the presumed presence of signals from other very short but nonetheless longer telomeres.An alternate interpretation is that telomerase is randomly acting on all telomeres, and that selection is producing the observed result. Cells in which telomerase acted on long but not short telomeres would become senescent and be lost from the population, while cells in which telomerase acted on short telomeres would continue to divide. When analyzing the entire population, the effect of this selection would be the apparent preservation of short telomere lengths while long telomeres shortened. Experiments in which chromosomes are broken by insertion of a plasmid with telomeric repeats on one end have shown that the telomere on the “healed chromosome” elongates while the length of the endogenous telomeres remain unaffected (41.Sprung C.N. Sabatier L. Murnane J.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 247: 29-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Under conditions in which telomerase is not limiting, this shows that in human cells telomerase can preferentially be recruited to act on a telomere that is too short. We believe that it is likely that the same mechanisms that recruit telomerase to act on these “too short” healing chromosomes would act to preferentially recruit limiting amounts of telomerase to the shortest chromosomes, and thus prefer recruitment rather than selection as an explanation for these observations.Telomerase has been proposed to perform a capping function on short telomeres that requires catalytic activity (14.Zhu J. Wang H. Bishop J.M. Blackburn E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3723-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Telomerase activity became undetectable in two clones following the introduction of the D869A hTERT mutant in B14 cells. These cells with very short telomeres divided for 20 additional doublings in the presence of the mutant hTERT before undergoing a growth arrest. The telomere shortening that occurred during these 20 doublings demonstrates that catalytically active telomerase was not present for a significant fraction of time on most of the telomeres. The replacement of wild-type telomerase with the dominant-negative mutant argues against a “capping” role for the telomerase protein on short telomeres that requires catalytic activity but is independent of the actual addition of TTAGGG repeats to the ends of the chromosomes. The ability of limiting amounts of catalytically active telomerase to preferentially maintain the shortest telomeres, so that average size decreases while minimum size does not, provides a sufficient explanation for the presence of subsenescent (this report) or subcrisis (14.Zhu J. Wang H. Bishop J.M. Blackburn E.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3723-3728Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar) telomere lengths.We have previously proposed that genes regulating cellular senescence might be located in subtelomeric regions, and that their expression might be controlled by changes in telomere positional effects as telomeres shortened (20.Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 193-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The present result demonstrates that these cultures continue to proliferate vigorously even though telomere sizes decreased to well below their normal lengths at senescence. This provides evidence against the re-expression of previously silenced genes that induce a growth arrest when telomeres become sufficiently short, and favors the hypothesis that it is the generation of a DNA damage signal from an insufficiently long telomere(s) that causes M1 (19.Harley C.B. Mutat. Res. 1991; 256: 271-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). Several previous reports have failed to find evidence of telomere positional effects in vertebrate cells (42.Bayne R.A. Broccoli D. Taggart M.H. Thomson E.J. Farr C.J. Cooke H.J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 539-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 43.Sprung C.N. Sabatier L. Murnane J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4336-4340Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although we now think it unlikely that telomere positional effects regulate the onset of M1, we continue to entertain the possibility that telomere shortening might regulate gene expression in ways that permit the counting of cell divisions to be used as a mechanism for timing decades-long processes during the human life span (44.Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Trends Cell Biol. 1995; 5: 293-296Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar).The concept that short telomeres increase the efficiency with which they recruit telomerase leads to the speculation that very efficient inhibition of telomerase might be required for anti-telomerase cancer therapy to be successful. It also raises the possibility that a combination of interventions inhibiting both the catalytic activity of telomerase as well as its ability to be recruited to telomeres might be much more successful than either alone. It is important to remember that (in contrast to germline cells) adult human somatic cells are not biologically programmed to maintain telomere length, and that the expression and function of an unknown number of accessory factors may have been altered in different somatic cells that have repressed telomerase. We anticipate that the factors that modify telomerase, recruit it to the telomeres, cause it to catalyze the addition of telomeric repeats, and regulate the number of repeats added at one time will show significant variability in levels and efficiencies between different normal cell types, and that this variability will be compounded in cancer cells. The consequences of expressing telomerase in an “inappropriate” biological context, either via an exogenous cDNA or through the mutational inactivation of repressive pathways, are thus likely to be diverse as well. Disentangling these multiple mechanisms should increase our ability to alter telomere length regulation for modifying the time course of replicative aging and in the treatment of cancer. These results show that normal human fibroblasts expressing a transfected hTERT cDNA gradually showed reduced telomerase activity and decreasing telomere lengths. After 150–300 population doublings, the telomeres stabilized at subsenescent lengths and in some cases have remained at that size for over 150 additional doublings, and thus the cells are still functionally immortal.

Whereas Vav expression is restricted to cells of hematopoietic origin, Vav2 is widely expressed. Although Vav and Vav2 share highly related structural similarities and high sequence identity in their Dbl homology domains, it has been reported that they are active GEFs with distinct substrate specificities toward Rho family members. Whereas Vav displayed GEF activity for Rac1, Cdc42, RhoA, and RhoG, Vav2 was reported to exhibit GEF activity for RhoA, RhoB, and RhoG but not for Rac1 or Cdc42. Consistent with their distinct substrate targets, it was found that constitutively activated versions of Vav and Vav2 caused distinct transformed phenotypes when expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. In contrast to the previous findings, we found that Vav2 can act as a potent GEF for Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA in vitro. Furthermore, we found that NH2-terminally truncated and activated Vav and Vav2 caused indistinguishable transforming actions in NIH 3T3 cells that required Cdc42, Rac1, and RhoA function. In addition, like Vav and Rac1, we found that Vav2 activated the Jun NH2-terminal kinase cascade and also caused the formation of lamellipodia and membrane ruffles in NIH 3T3 cells. Finally, Vav2-transformed NIH 3T3 cells showed up-regulated levels of Rac-GTP. We conclude that Vav2 and Vav share overlapping downstream targets and are activators of multiple Rho family proteins. Therefore, Vav2 may mediate the same cellular consequences in nonhematopoietic cells as Vav does in hematopoietic cells.

For example, RhoA promotes the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions, whereas Rac1 promotes the formation of lamellipodia and membrane ruffling, and Cdc42 causes actin microspike formation and filopodia development. Rho family proteins are also activators of signaling pathways that regulate gene expression and cell growth (3.Narumiya S. Ishizaki T. Watanabe N. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 68-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 4.Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar, 5.Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). For example, Rac1 and Cdc42 but not RhoA activate the Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade, and JNK in turn phosphorylates and activates the Jun, ATF-2 and Elk-1 transcription factors (6.Minden A. Lin A. Claret F.-X. Abo A. Karin M. Cell. 1995; 81: 1147-1157Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1446) Google Scholar, 7.Coso O.A. Chiariello M., Yu, J.-C. Teramoto H. Crespo P. Xu N. Miki T. Gutkind J.S. Cell. 1995; 81: 1137-1146Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1567) Google Scholar). RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 are also activators of the NF-κB and serum response factor transcription factors (8.Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. Sánchez-Pérez I. Bravo R. Lacal J.C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (536) Google Scholar, 9.Hill C.S. Wynne J. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1159-1170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1207) Google Scholar). These transcription factors in turn regulate genes that promote cell growth. Rho family proteins are also required for progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle, in part, by up-regulating the expression of cyclin D1 (10.Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar, 11.Westwick J.K. Lee R.J. Lambert Q.T. Symons M. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Whitehead I.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16739-16747Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Thus, it is not surprising that the aberrant activation of Rho family proteins can promote cellular transformation, and the proteins are required for the transforming actions of Ras and other oncoproteins. To date, over 30 mammalian Dbl family members have been identified. All Dbl family proteins share a tandem Dbl homology (DH) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domain structure (reviewed in Refs. 1.Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar and 2.Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The DH domain serves as the GTPase binding and GEF catalytic domain. Whereas some Dbl proteins show very specific substrate specificity, others show broad substrate specificity. For example, the Dbl family proteins Lsc, Fdg1, and Tiam1 are specific for RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1, respectively (12.Whitehead I.P. Khosravi-Far R. Kirk H. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Der C.J. Kay R. J. Biol.

Nature. 1995; 375: 338-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). In contrast, Vav has been found to activate multiple Rho family proteins (Rac1, RhoA, RhoB, RhoG, and Cdc42) (15.Han J. Das B. Wei W. Van Aelst L. Mosteller R.D. Khosravi-Far R. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Broek D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1346-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 16.Crespo P. Schuebel K.E.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6608-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Although the structural basis for substrate specificity of DH domains remains to be delineated, we have observed that the overall sequence identities of DH domains does broadly correlate with their GTPase targets (2.Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Although PH domains are found in other signaling proteins, a PH domain is invariantly positioned just COOH-terminal to the DH domain within Dbl family proteins (1.Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 2.Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Thus, the tandem DH/PH association suggests that these domains may be functionally interdependent. Presently, it is believed that the PH domain facilitates the membrane localization of Dbl family proteins, where their GTPase substrates reside (19.Whitehead I.P. Kirk H. Tognon C. Trigo-Gonzalez G. Kay R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18388-18395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 20.Whitehead I.P. Lambert Q.T. Glaven J.A. Abe K. Rossman K.L. Mahon G.M. Trzaskos J.M. Kay R. Campbell S.L. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 18: 4689-4697Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A second function involves the positive or negative regulation of the catalytic function of the DH domain (21.Han J. Luby-Phelps K. Das B. Shu X. Xia Y. Mosteller R.D. Krishna U.M. Falck J.R. White M.A. Broek D. Science. 1998; 279: 558-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar, 22.Nimnual A.S. Yatsula B.A. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1998; 279: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 23.Liu X. Wang H. Eberstadt M. Schnuchel A. Olejniczak E.T. Meadows R.P. Schkeryantz J.M. Janowick D.A. Harlan J.E. Harris E.A. Staunton D.E. Fesik S.W. Cell. 1998; 95: 269-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Outside the DH domains, Dbl family members generally share little sequence similarity. Because NH2-terminal deletion of sequences upstream of the DH domain creates transforming versions of various Dbl family proteins (e.g. Vav, Dbl, and Tiam1), the NH2-terminal sequences may serve a negative regulatory role for these proteins. A majority of Dbl family proteins have been shown to exhibit transforming potential in NIH 3T3 focus formation assays: Dbl, Vav, Dbs, Ost, Ect2, Net1, Tim, Lbc, Lsc, Lfc, Tiam1, Trio, and Fgd1 (1.Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 2.Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that Dbl family transformation is the result of their deregulation of Rho GTPase activity. First, where it has been analyzed, mutation of the DH domain causes a loss of transforming activity. Second, Dbl family proteins cause the same changes in actin cytoskeletal organization as their small GTPase substrates. Third, constitutively activated Rho GTPases and Dbl family proteins cause very similar transformed phenotypes when assayed in rodent fibroblasts and other cell types. Fourth, Dbl family members can activate similar signaling pathways as their Rho GTPase substrates. Thus, the activation of Rho GTPases plays an important role in Dbl transformation. Vav and Vav2 are members of the Dbl family of proteins. These two proteins are highly related showing 63% sequence similarity and 55% identity (24.Henske E.P. Short M.P. Jozwiak S. Bovey C.M. Ramlakhan S. Haines J.L. Kwiatkowski D.J. Ann. Hum. Genet. 1995; 59: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 25.Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Nielsen D.A. Song B.-J. Barbacid M. Goldman D. Lee I.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 363-371PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, among all Dbl family proteins, the DH domain of Vav2 shares the strongest sequence identity with that of Vav. The transforming activity of both Vav and Vav2 can be activated by NH2-terminal truncation (25.Schuebel K.E. Bustelo X.R. Nielsen D.A. Song B.-J. Barbacid M. Goldman D. Lee I.J. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 363-371PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Katzav S. Cleveland J.L. Heslop H.E. Pulido D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 1912-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Both proteins also contain the same spectrum of COOH-terminal protein-protein or protein-lipid interaction motifs. Following the PH domain is a cysteine-rich domain and tandem Src homology 3 (SH3) domains split by an intervening SH2 domain. However, Vav and Vav2 are also distinct in several ways. First, whereas Vav expression is restricted to hematopoietic cells, Vav2 is expressed ubiquitously. Second, although Vav has shown GEF activity on RhoA, RhoG, Rac1, and Cdc42 in vitro (15.Han J. Das B. Wei W. Van Aelst L. Mosteller R.D. Khosravi-Far R. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Broek D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1346-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 16.Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, 18.Schuebel K.E. Movilla N. Rosa J.L. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6608-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), Vav2 has recently been reported to have GEF activity on RhoA, RhoB, and RhoG but not on Rac1 and Cdc42 in vitro (18.Schuebel K.E. Movilla N. Rosa J.L. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6608-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Vav and Vav2 were also demonstrated to have distinct consequences on cell morphology and actin organization and caused distinct transformed phenotypes that correlated with their different substrate specificity. Thus, it has been proposed that Vav and Vav2 may be activated by similar upstream stimuli but then stimulate distinct downstream signaling events and biological outcomes. We have evaluated the biochemical and biological properties of Vav2. In contrast to previous observations, we found that Vav2 is an activator of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. Similar to Vav, Vav2 (a DH or DH/PH/CRD fragment) exhibited potent guanine nucleotide exchange activity on RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 in vitro. Consistent with this exchange activity, Vav2 caused a similar transformed phenotype as Vav when expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. Furthermore, like Vav, Vav2 transforming activity was impaired by inhibition of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 function. Like Rac1, Vav2 also induced the formation of lamellipodia and membrane ruffles in NIH 3T3 cells. Vav2 also stimulated the activity of the c-Jun transcription factor, a signaling pathway activated by Rac or Cdc42. Finally, Vav2-transformed NIH 3T3 cells showed a significant increase in the levels of Rac-GTP. Thus, when taken together, our data suggest that Vav2 can activate multiple Rho GTPases similar to its related family member Vav. The pAX142 mammalian expression plasmid (20.Whitehead I.P. Lambert Q.T. Glaven J.A. Abe K. Rossman K.L. Mahon G.M. Trzaskos J.M. Kay R. Campbell S.L. Der C.J. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1999; 274: 30410-30418Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The ΔN-191 Vav2 mutant was generated by polymerase chain reaction using wild-type full-length Vav2 (pCMV5-vav2; a generous gift from Dan Broek) as a template. A 5′ primer (CA GGT ACC GGC ATG ACT GAA GAT GAC AAG) containing a KpnI site and seven Vav2 NH2-terminal residues corresponding to residues 192–198 was used in conjunction with a 3′ primer (CA GGT ACC GGC GTC CAG ATC TGC AGG AGA) containing a KpnI and aBglII site (the BglII site corresponds to residue 578 in Vav2) to generate a 1.7-kilobase fragment. This fragment was digested with KpnI and ligated into aKpnI-digested pCMV5-vav2 plasmid. This plasmid containing the polymerase chain reaction-generated fragment was then sequenced. The pCMV5-vav2 + insert fragment was digested with BglII, and the larger vector fragment was recovered and religated together (pCMV5 ΔN-191vav2). To compare ΔN-186 Vav and ΔN-191 Vav2 transforming activities, pCMV5 Δ-191vav2 was digested with KpnI andHindIII, converted to blunt ends using T4 DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, Inc.), and ligated into the SmaI site in pAX142. pZIP-NeoSV(x)1 retrovirus mammalian expression constructs encoding wild-type or dominant negative mutants of RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42, and Rho GAP p190 have been described and characterized previously (28.Khosravi-Far R. White M.A. Westwick J.K. Solski P.A. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Van Aelst L. Wigler M.H. Der C.J. Mol. Cell.

Settleman, respectively. pyDF30 WASP-GBD encodes the NH2-terminal sequences of WASP that contains the Cdc42-GBD and WASP-GBD has been shown to function as an inhibitor of Cdc42 function (provided by M.

Transfections were performed using calcium phosphate co-precipitation in conjunction with glycerol shock as described previously (32.Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). For each assay, cognate empty vector was used as a control. For focus formation analyses, transfected NIH 3T3 cells were maintained in growth medium for 12–14 days. The cultures were then stained with crystal violet (0.5%), and the number of foci of transformed cells was then quantitated. To select for NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing constitutively activated Vav2, pAX142 ΔN191-Vav2 (1 μg) were co-transfected with the pZIP-NeoSV(x)1 empty plasmid (neomycin resistant) and maintained in growth medium supplemented with G418 (400 μg/μl). NIH 3T3 cells stably expressing constitutively activated Vav by transfection of pCTV3 ΔN-186 Vav and selection of stably transfected cells were established by isolating drug-resistant colonies after growth in medium supplemented with hygromycin. Multiple drug resistant colonies (>100) were pooled together to establish the stable cell lines for use in the various assays described. Anchorage-independent growth assays were performed as described previously (32.Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence analyses, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were transfected with 2 μg of cognate mammalian expression vector pAX142, pAX142 ΔN-186 Vav, or pAX142 ΔN-191 Vav2 using the LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) reagent according to manufacturer's instructions. 24 h after transfection, cells were trypsinized and plated on 10 μg/ml fibronectin-coated glass coverslips (Carolina Biologicals) and allowed to attach and spread for 2 h. NIH 3T3 cells were transfected by calcium phosphate co-precipitation as described previously (32.Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). 48 h after transfection, cells were starved for 15 h with Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 0.5% bovine calf serum to reduce the level of serum activation of c-Jun. Analyses of the cell lysates of the transiently transfected NIH 3T3 cells were performed using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents and a Monolight 2010 luminometer (Analytical Luminescence) as described previously (33.Hauser C.A. Der C.J. Cox A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 238: 271-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 34.Hauser C.A. Westwick J.K. Quilliam L.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 412-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The reporter constructs utilized were previously described; Gal4-Jun encodes the Gal4 DNA-binding domain fused to the NH2-terminal transactivation domain of c-Jun (35.Su B. Jacinto E. Hibi M. Kallunki T. Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Cell. 1994; 77: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar), and 5xGal4-Luc contains the luciferase gene under control of tandem copies of the Gal4 DNA-binding sequences and the minimal promoter of c-fos. cDNA fragments encoding either the human Vav2 DH domain (residues 191–402) or the tandem DH/PH/CRD (residues 191–573) were generated by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into the NcoI/XhoI sites of the bacterial expression vector pET-28a (Novagen). The bacterial expression constructs were transformed into the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3), and protein expression was induced with 1 mm IPTG at 25 °C. The recombinant proteins were His6-tagged at its COOH terminus and were purified from bacterial lysate on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose column (Qiagen). The Vav2 DH protein was further purified on a S-200 size exclusion column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and a source-Q anion exchange column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A similar bacterial expression vector encoding the isolated DH domain of Dbs has been previously described (20.Whitehead I.P. Lambert Q.T. Glaven J.A. Abe K. Rossman K.L. Mahon G.M. Trzaskos J.M. Kay R. Campbell S.L. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 18: 4689-4697Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed Tiam1 DH/PH protein was kindly provided by J. Sondek. Bacterially expressed GST-RhoA(F25N), GST-Rac1(WT), and GST-Cdc42(WT) were expressed and purified essentially as described (36.Self A.J. Hall A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed Ha-Ras (1–166) was purified as described previously (37.Campbell-Burk S.L. Carpenter J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 3-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The GDP dissociation assays were carried out by the filter binding method that was described previously (38.Hart M.J. Eva A. Evans T. Aaronson S.A. Cerione R.A. Nature. 1991; 354: 311-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). To prepare [3H]GDP-loaded GST-Rho, GST-Rac, or GST-Cdc42, solutions containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 7.5 mm EDTA, 15 μm GDP, 5.5 μm[3H]GDP, and 12.5 μm of the GTPase were incubated for 25 min at 20 °C. The [3H]GDP-bound GTPases were then stabilized by supplementing the solution with 20 mm MgCl2. Nucleotide exchange reactions were performed at 20 °C by diluting the [3H]GDP-loaded GST-RhoA, GST-Rac1, or GST-Cdc42 to 4 μm in reaction mixtures containing either 4 μm GEF (Vav2 DH, Dbs DH, Tiam1 DH/PH) or no GEF, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 100 μm GTP (final concentrations). 30 μl of each reaction mixture were sampled at 0, 5, 10, and 20 min and quenched in 1 ml of ice-cold dilution buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 20 mm MgCl2. The amount of [3H]GDP remaining bound to the GTPases was measured by filtering the quenched samples over nitrocellulose followed by scintillation counting. The percentage of [3H]GDP remaining bound at each time point for the GEF catalyzed and uncatalyzed reactions were evaluated relative to time 0 of the uncatalyzed reaction. Dbs DH and Tiam1 DH/PH were included as positive controls for GST-Cdc42 and GST-Rac1, respectively. Results are the average of two independent assays. Fluorescence spectroscopic analysis of N-methylanthraniloyl (mant)-GDP incorporation into GDP-preloaded GST-Rac1, GST-Cdc42, GST-RhoA, or Ha-Ras was carried out using a Perkin-Elmer LS 50 B Spectrometer at 20 °C similar to as described previously (39.Leonard D.A. Evans T. Hart M. Cerione R.A. Manor D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12323-12328Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Exchange reaction assay mixtures containing 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/μl bovine serum albumin, 1% glycerol, 400 nm mant-GDP (Biomol), and 2 μmof GTPase were prepared and allowed to equilibrate with continuous stirring. After equilibration, the Vav2 DH/PH/CRD polypeptide was added to 50 nm, and the relative mant fluorescence (λex = 360 ηm, λem = 440 ηm) was monitored. Experiments were performed in duplicate. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were essentially processed for immunofluorescence as described previously (40.Liu B.P. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Burridge K. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1998; 5: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, rinsed in Tris-buffered saline at pH 7.6 for 3 min, and permeabilized for 6 min in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Triton X-100. Expression of the DNA constructs was determined by staining with mouse anti-Vav1 antibody (Upstate Technology, Lake Placid, NY) or rabbit anti-Vav2 antibody generated against the COOH-terminal of Vav2 2K.

Actin was visualized with Texas Red-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Images were acquired through a Micromax 5 MHz cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instrument) on an Axiophot (Zeiss) microscope. The Vav and Vav2 DH domains share strong sequence identity (51%) (24.Henske E.P. Short M.P. Jozwiak S. Bovey C.M. Ramlakhan S. Haines J.L. Kwiatkowski D.J. Ann. Hum.

Oncogene. 1996; 13: 363-371PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Furthermore, our sequence alignment and dendrogram analyses of DH domains showed that related DH domains shared similar substrate specificity (2.Whitehead I.P. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1332: F1-F23Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Therefore, the recent report that Vav2 showed distinct GEF activities from Vav was unexpected (18.Schuebel K.E. Movilla N. Rosa J.L. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6608-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To further evaluate the activity of the DH domain of Vav2, we constructed, expressed, and purified a bacterially expressed hexahistidine-tagged DH domain fragment of Vav2 (residues 191–401) and analyzed the effect of this protein on the incorporation of cold GTP into [3H]GDP-loaded RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 (Fig.2). RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 alone did not exhibit significant intrinsic GDP dissociation. However, the Vav2 DH domain stimulated rapid and complete GDP dissociation from RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 within ∼20 min. In fact, the reaction went to completion in 5 min with both Rac1 and Cdc42, whereas only 25% of the [3H]GDP was released from RhoA after the same time period. These assays were performed at both stoichiometric and substoichiometric conditions (data not shown). Furthermore, as controls, we examined the in vitro GEF exchange activities of Dbl family members Dbs (DH domain) and Tiam-1 (DH/PH domain) on their respective GTPases, Cdc42 and Rac1 (14.Michiels F.

Using a transgenic mouse (line 3445) harboring a gelatinase B promoter/lacZ fusion gene, we demonstrate FGF-2 stimulation of reporter gene expression in endothelial cells of invading neocapillaries in the corneal micropocket assay. Using cultured corneal cells, we show that FGF-2 stimulates DNA binding activity of transcription factor AP-1 but not NF-κB and that AP-1 stimulation is inhibited by curcuminoids. We further show that induction of gelatinase B transcriptional promoter activity in response to FGF-2 is dependent on AP-1 but not NF-κB response elements and that promoter activity is also inhibited by curcuminoids. In rabbit corneas, the angiogenic response induced by implantation of an FGF-2 pellet is inhibited by the co-implantation of a curcuminoid pellet, and this correlates with inhibition of endogenous gelatinase B expression induced by FGF-2. Angiostatic efficacy in the cornea is also observed when curcuminoids are provided to mice in the diet. Our findings provide evidence that curcuminoids target the FGF-2 angiogenic signaling pathway and inhibit expression of gelatinase B in the angiogenic process.

Accumulating evidence implicates members of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)1 family in this process, in particular, gelatinase A (MMP-2) and gelatinase B (MMP-9) (3.Mignatti P. Rifkin D.B. Enzyme Protein. 1996; 49: 117-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). These enzymes may contribute to growth of new capillaries in several ways including activation of growth factors that stimulate endothelial cell migration and tube formation and dissolution of endothelial basement membranes at the sprouting capillary tips (4.Nguyen M.

Roughley P.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 595-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). When required, progelatinase A is proteolytically activated to a 62-kDa form by cleavage of the N terminus by membrane-type MMPs (8.Strongin A.Y. Collier I. Bannikov G. Marmer B.L. Grant G.A. Goldberg G.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5331-5338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1432) Google Scholar); in endothelial cells, this occurs through ligation to the integrin receptor αvβ3 (9.Brooks P.C. Stromblad S. Sanders L.C. von Schalscha T.L. Aimes R.T. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Quigley J.P. Cheresh D.A. Cell. 1996; 85: 683-693Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). In contrast, gelatinase B (92-kDa MMP-9), like most other MMPs, is expressed only upon demand, and regulation occurs at the level of gene transcription (10.Fini M.E. Cook J.R. Mohan R. Brinckerhoff C.E. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, New York1998: 300-356Google Scholar). Mice made genetically deficient in gelatinase A, although revealing no developmental abnormalities, display impeded angiogenic response to tumor stimulus (11.Itoh T. Tanioka M. Yoshida H. Yoshioka T. Nishimoto H. Itohara S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 1048-1051PubMed Google Scholar). Targeted inactivation of gelatinase B causes a transient delay in bone development because of defective vascular invasion (12.Vu T.H. Shipley J.M. Bergers G. Berger J.E. Helms J.A. Hanahan D. Shapiro S.D. Senior R.M. Werb Z. Cell. 1998; 93: 411-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1474) Google Scholar). These gene knockout studies provide the most definitive evidence to date for the importance of the gelatinolytic MMPs in angiogenesis. Much attention is currently focused on development of synthetic agents that block MMP enzymatic activity as a means to pharmacologically manage diseases involving these enzymes (13.Brown P.D. Giavazzi R. Ann. Oncol. 1995; 6: 967-974Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). However, considering that most MMPs are expressed only on demand, an alternative approach might target mechanisms for MMP transcriptional activation (10.Fini M.E. Cook J.R. Mohan R. Brinckerhoff C.E. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, New York1998: 300-356Google Scholar, 14.Yamamoto H. Flannery M.L. Kupriyanov S. Pearce J. McKercher S.R. Henkel G.W. Maki R.A.

A highly conserved AP-1 transcription factor DNA-binding site is found in many MMP gene promoters and is thought to be a common thread to their co-ordinate induction in response to diverse stress stimuli (10.Fini M.E. Cook J.R. Mohan R. Brinckerhoff C.E. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, New York1998: 300-356Google Scholar). AP-1 is activated in response to hypoxia (15.Rupec R.A. Baeuerle P.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 632-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), a physiological stimulator of angiogenesis (16.Yao K.S. Xanthoudakis S. Curran T. O'Dwyer P.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5997-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2) is another important angiogenic stimulator (17.Gualandris A. Rusnati M. Belleri M.

A response element for a second transcription factor activated by stress stimuli, NF-κB, has been found only in the gelatinase B promoter thus far and is one factor determining the unique expression pattern of this gene (10.Fini M.E. Cook J.R. Mohan R. Brinckerhoff C.E. Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, New York1998: 300-356Google Scholar). NF-κB, an oxidative-response transcription factor, also triggers gene expression associated with the angiogenic response (22.Shono T. Ono M. Izumi H. Jimi S.I. Matsushima K. Okamoto T. Kohno K. Kuwano M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4231-4239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by engaging inflammatory cytokine signaling (23.Schreck R. Albermann K. Baeuerle P.A. Free Radical Res. Commun. 1992; 17: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar). Therefore, targeted inhibition of AP-1 or NF-κB might be a logical step in attempting to modulate the angiogenic response. Curcuminoids, natural products of the Indian spice turmeric, are potent antioxidant and antiinflammatory agents that have been entered into Phase I clinical trials for chemo-preventation by the National Cancer Institute (24.Kelloff G.J. Crowell J.A. Hawk E.T. Steele V.E. Lubet R.A. Boone C.W. Covey J.M. Doody L.A. Omenn G.S. Greenwald P. Hong W.K. Parkinson D.R. Bagheri D. Baxter G.T. Blunden M. Doeltz M.K. Eisenhauer K.M.

At least part of their biological activity can be attributed to their capacity to inhibit activation of AP-1 and NF-κB transcription factors. Thus, curcuminoids have been shown to inhibit activation of these transcription factors in response to phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), tumor necrosis factor-α, and hydrogen peroxide (25.Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24995-25000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar, 26.Huang T.S. Kuo M.L. Lin J.K. Hsieh J.S. Cancer Lett. 1995; 96: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In vascular endothelial cells, curcuminoids reduce the activation of tissue factor gene expression induced by tumor necrosis factor-α, lipopolysaccharide, PMA, and thrombin resulting from the coordinate inhibition of AP-1 DNA binding activity and nuclear translocation of NF-κB (27.Bierhaus A. Zhang Y. Quehenberger P. Luther T. Haase M. Muller M. Mackman N. Ziegler R. Nawroth P.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 772-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 28.Pendurthi U.R. Williams J.T. Rao L.V. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 3406-3413Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigate curcuminoid effects on FGF-2 activation of the gelatinase B transcriptional promoter and on angiogenesis in a corneal micropocket assay. We report that curcuminoids inhibit FGF-2-induced angiogenesis when delivered locally or in the diet in coordination with their down-regulation of transcription factor AP-1 DNA binding activity and of gelatinase B promoter activity. Stromal cells were isolated from rabbit cornea and subcultured as described previously (29.Fini M.E. Girard M.T. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 373-383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For an experiment, cells were plated, then changed the next day to serum-free medium, and incubated for 24–36 h to reduce basal activity of the transcription factors under investigation. Cells were then pretreated with 20 μm curcuminoids for 30 min, followed by stimulation with either PMA (1 μm) or FGF-2 (50 ng/ml) plus heparin (30 ng/ml). For electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), treatments were performed for 2–4 h in serum-free medium. For transfection analysis, treatments were performed for 24 h. Nuclear lysates were prepared as described previously (30.Mohan R. Rinehart W.B. Bargagna-Mohan P. Fini M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25903-25914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of the nuclear extracts were determined using the Bio-Rad reagent, and aliquots of equal protein were frozen at −70 °C. Double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the consensus DNA-binding sites for transcription factors AP-1 (5′-CGCTTGATGAGTCAGCCGGAA-3′) and NF-κB (5′- AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGG-3′) served as probes for EMSA (Promega Co., Madison, WI). An oligonucleotide containing a mutated and nonfunctional AP-1-binding site (AP-1*; 5′-CGCTTGATGAGTTGGCCGGAA-3′) was employed in competion controls. The oligonucleotides were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP, diluted, and used as probes in EMSA, according to standard methods (30.Mohan R. Rinehart W.B. Bargagna-Mohan P. Fini M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25903-25914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Antibodies to NF-κB family members p50, p65, and c-Rel were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). For supershift EMSA, 1 μg of one of these antibodies was added to the nuclear lysate containing the radiolabeled probe and incubated for 40 min before electrophoresis. Antibodies to the unrelated transcription factor AP-2 served as a negative control. Rabbit corneal fibroblasts plated in 6-well dishes were transfected with 1 μg of a specific gelatinase B promoter-CAT plasmid, the contruction of which was previously described (31.Fini M.E. Bartlett J.D. Matsubara M. Rinehart W.B. Mody M.K. Girard M.T. Rainville M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28620-28628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To normalize transfection efficiencies, cultures were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of a cytomegalovirus promoter/β-gal reporter construct (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). An exception was the experiments involving curcuminoid treatment; these were not normalized to β-gal, because the curcuminoids inhibited cytomegalovirus promoter activity (data not shown). One day after transfection, cell cultures were placed in serum-free medium, and treatments were added as appropriate to the experiment. Cultures were then harvested, and CAT and β-gal activities were assayed from triplicate samples (31.Fini M.E. Bartlett J.D. Matsubara M. Rinehart W.B. Mody M.K. Girard M.T. Rainville M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28620-28628Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pellets of curcuminoids (2 mg, 1.5 mm in diameter) were made using a pellet press (Parr Instrument Co., Moline, IL). Slow release (sucralfate)-FGF-2 (80 ng) pellets were prepared as described (32.Kenyon B.M. Voest E.E. Chen C.C. Flynn E. Folkman J. D'Amato R.J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1996; 37: 1625-1632PubMed Google Scholar) and implanted into the right eye of rabbits. New Zealand rabbits were purchased from Charles River labs (Cambridge, MA). All ocular surgical procedures were performed with the aid of a dissecting microscope after total anesthesia with xylazine and ketamine and topical application of 0.5% proparacaine (Ophthatetic, Alcon, TX). For the co-implantation of a curcuminoid pellet with the FGF-2 pellet, the surgical procedure was modified; a second micropocket was created 3 mm from the one containing FGF-2 pellet, and a single curcuminoid pellet was placed in the second micropocket 5 mm from the limbus. Animals were monitored daily for for signs of eye irritation, inflammation, or infection. On day 12 after surgery, rabbits eyes were photographed and then sacrificed by an intracardiac injection of phenobarbitol. Corneas were immediately removed and frozen at −70 °C for later use in zymographic analyses. A circular disc of tissue 5 mm in diameter from pellet-implanted rabbit corneas was isolated with the aid of a trephine; any slow release pellets were then removed. The corneal discs were minced into small fragments and pulverized with a homogenization plunger in 1.5-ml microfuge tubes containing extraction buffer (2% SDS, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm CaCl2). Protein concentrations were determined from trichloroacetic acid-precipitated material. Equal amounts of protein from each rabbit cornea was mixed with Laemeli gel loading buffer (without added reducing agents) and subjected to electrophoresis on an 7.5% polyacrylamide gel containing 2.5% gelatin. Gels were processed according to standard zymographic procedures (29.Fini M.E. Girard M.T. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 373-383Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, SDS was extracted from the gels by washes in 2.5% Triton X-100 for 1 h, and subsequently the gel was incubated in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 1 mmCaCl2 for 16 h at 37 °C to permit in-gel refolding and autoactivation of the metalloproteinases. Coomassie Blue staining revealed the presence of the gelatinolytic enzymes as clear bands against the blue background. Gelatinase B proenzyme (MMP-9), gelatinase A proenzyme (MMP-2), and the proteolytically cleaved, activated form of gelatinase A (62 kDa) were identified by their co-migration with rabbit gelatinase standards prepared from conditioned media of phorbol ester-stimulated rabbit corneal fibroblasts as described (33.Girard M.T. Matsubara M. Fini M.E. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1991; 32: 2441-2454PubMed Google Scholar). Curcuminoids purchased from Sigma, sold under the name curcumin, contain approximately 77% curcumin, 17% demethoxycurcumin, and 3% bisdemethoxycurcumin (34.Huang M.T. Lou Y.R. Ma W. Newmark H.L. Reuhl K.R. Conney A.H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 5841-5847PubMed Google Scholar). The curcuminoid-supplemented diet was prepared by mixing 1 g (experiment 1) or 2 g (experiment 2) of curcuminoids/kg of standard rodent chow. In brief, the rodent chow was pulverized into a powder and thoroughly blended with the curcuminoid mixture. The chow mix was wetted with sterilized distilled water, recompressed into nugget size pieces, and immediately frozen at −20 °C. Adequate amounts of the curcuminoid-supplemented chow were brought to room temperature and provided fresh each day to the mice. Any remaining chow that was not consumed was discarded and replaced with a fresh batch the next day. An 80-ng slow release (sucralfate)-FGF-2 pellet was surgically implanted in one cornea in each of ten CD-1 female mice (Charles River Labs, MA) according to the well established procedure of J. Folkman and co-workers (32.Kenyon B.M. Voest E.E. Chen C.C. Flynn E. Folkman J. D'Amato R.J. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1996; 37: 1625-1632PubMed Google Scholar). One group of five mice harboring the FGF-2 pellets was allowed to feed ad libitum on 1 g curcuminoids/kg chow for a period of 10 days starting on the day of the surgery. The control group of five mice harboring the FGF-2 pellets was allowed to feed on regular rodent chow ad libitum. On days 6 and 10, mice were anesthetized, and their eyes were photographed under a dissecting stereo microscope. In a second experiment, six CD-1 female mice were allowed to feed ad libitum on 2 g curcuminoids/kg chow for 7 days prior to surgical implantation of the 80-ng FGF-2 pellets and continued on the curcuminoid chow for an additional 6 days post-surgery. The control group of six mice was allowed to feed ad libitum on regular chow over the entire period, prior to, and post-surgical implantation of FGF-2. The eyes of the control and curcuminoid-treated mice were photographed on day 6 post-surgery. In a separate angiogenesis experiment, transgenic mice (line 3445; CD-1 background) that contain the DNA sequences between −522 and +19 of the rabbit gelatinase B gene promoter fused transcriptionally to the coding sequences of the bacterial LacZ gene were used. The generation of these mice and the embryonic developmental and wound-induced stimulation of reporter gene expression has been reported (30.Mohan R. Rinehart W.B. Bargagna-Mohan P. Fini M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25903-25914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Line 3445 transgenic mice were implanted with 80-ng FGF-2 corneal pellets. Developing new blood vessels were followed by examination between days 3 and 7, when some mice were sacrificed during this time period and enucleated eyes were stained for β-gal expression. In some cases, neovascularizing eyes were also photographed before sacrifice. Mouse eyes were enucleated, fixed in cold 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and washed three times for 10 min each at 4 °C in phosphate buffered saline. The eyes were stained in 2% X-gal staining solution for 12 h at 30 °C and photographed. X-gal-stained eyes were also embedded in paraffin and sectioned at 6 μm, and the sections were counter-stained with eosin. We attempted to quantitate corneal blood vessel density by the computer-assisted method of J. Folkman and co-workers (35.Chen C. Parangi S. Tolentino M.J. Folkman J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4230-4233PubMed Google Scholar); however, because CD-1 mice lack a pigmented iris, we could not obtain high contrast photographic images for direct quantitation of blood vessels from photographic prints. Therefore, 35-mm color slide images of neovascularized eyes of each mouse were obtained, and the total number of blood vessels in each cornea was quantified by analyzing traced images of blood vessels. In brief, using a slide projector the slide of each neovascularized cornea was projected at a fixed distance to produce an enlarged picture that fit within a piece of 8.5 × 11-inch white paper. Using a black ink fine-tip ball point pen, each corneal blood vessel from the enlarged image was traced by hand onto the sheet of paper. The slides were coded to allow a masked analysis by the investigator, and the tracings were repeated by a second investigator blinded to the study. The traced image of blood vessels of each mouse cornea was scanned using a laser scanner (ScanJet 4C) into a Macintosh computer using the Deskscan and Photoshop software programs in grayscale format at 8-bits/pixel resolution. The imported images from Photoshop were directly transferred without any alterations into the NIH Image analysis software, and the sum of all vessels in a cornea were quantified as pixels. The data in the control and curcuminoid-treated groups were decoded, and results of the analysis performed by the two researchers were averaged. Student's ttest was applied to the data to obtain significance values. We have recently reported our development of a transgenic mouse line (3445) harboring a lacZ reporter gene driven by −522 to +19 of the rabbit gelatinase B transcriptional promoter (30.Mohan R. Rinehart W.B. Bargagna-Mohan P. Fini M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25903-25914Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We showed that this promoter fragment is sufficient to drive embryonic and injury-induced reporter gene expression in a manner that mimics the pattern of the endogenous gelatinase B gene. In this study, we used line 3445 mice to investigate activation of the gelatinase B promoter to an FGF-2 angiogenic stimulus using the corneal micropocket assay. Implantation of slow release pellets containing 80 ng of FGF-2 into the mouse cornea stimulated growth of corneal capillaries from the limbal vasculature located at the transitional zone between the cornea and sclera. These new blood vessels were abundant by 7 days post-surgery when observed under a dissecting microscope (Fig. 1 A,small arrows). The neovascularized eyes were analyzed by whole mount histochemical staining for reporter gene expression. β-Gal activity was observed around the FGF-2 pellets and in a punctate pattern paralleling the capillary network growing toward the pellets (Fig. 1 B, small arrows). Finally, staining was seen within the area of the pre-existing limbal vessels (Fig. 1 B, large arrow); however, dissection of the tissue revealed that most of this staining occurred in underlying structures in the angle of the anterior chamber (such as the ciliary body), which also stained in eyes without implanted pellets (data not shown). In thin tissue sections of the X-gal-stained neovascularized portions of the cornea, β-gal activity was revealed to occur in cells composing the vessel lumen and cells that had accumulated around the new capillaries (Fig. 1 C). A time course study revealed that gelatinase B promoter activity was transient within the vascularizing tissues; migratory endothelial cells stained by day 2 and outlined newly formed blood vessels till day 7, becoming sporadic after this time point (data not shown). The fellow eye of the same mouse that lacked FGF-2 pellet or eyes of transgenic mouse line 3445 implanted with pellets lacking growth factor did not develop corneal blood vessels and failed to show corneal β-gal staining at 7 days post-surgery (data not shown). Together, these results indicate that activity of the gelatinase B transcriptional promoter is spatially and temporally regulated during the process of angiogenesis that occurs in response to FGF-2 stimulus. The effect of curcuminoids on the FGF-2-mediated activation of two transcription factors known to contribute to gelatinase B promoter activity, AP-1 or NF-κB, was investigated by EMSA. As a positive control, we confirmed the known activity of curcuminoids against transcription factors activated in response to PMA (25.Singh S. Aggarwal B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24995-25000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1254) Google Scholar, 26.Huang T.S. Kuo M.L. Lin J.K. Hsieh J.S. Cancer Lett. 1995; 96: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Cells were serum-starved for 24–36 h to reduce transcription factor activities to basal levels prior to initiating an experiment. When radiolabeled consensus oligonucleotide probes for AP-1 or NF-κB were incubated with nuclear lysates prepared from untreated serum-free cells, a single major DNA-protein complex formed in each case (arrowheads), as revealed by the presence of a band with retarded electrophoretic mobility in comparison to the free probe (Fig.2, A and B,SF lanes). The specificity of the complex that formed on the radiolabeled AP-1 oligo was revealed by its abrogation when competed with a 50-fold excess of cold AP-1 oligo, but not by a 50-fold excess of the mutant AP-1 oligo (AP-1*) containing two nucleotide changes in the consensus DNA sequence (Fig. 2 A, 50 × oligo lanes). The specificity of the major complex that formed on the radiolabeled NF-κB oligo was similarly revealed by competition with a 50-fold excess of cold probe (Fig. 2 A, 1:50 lane), but not by a nonspecific binding control, cold AP-1 probe (Fig. 2 A, NSB lane). Furthermore, antibodies to the NF-κB subunits, p50 and p65, each supershifted a subcomponent of the major complex, but antibodies either to NF-κB subunit c-Rel or to the unrelated transcription factor AP-2 had no effect (Fig.2 A). The nonspecific nature of the faster migrating minor complex (Fig. 2 A, asterisk) in NF-κB EMSA is indicated by its unresponsiveness to competition or antibody supershift.

Cancer Lett. 1995; 96: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, FGF-2 treatment stimulated AP-1 DNA binding activity, but NF-κB DNA binding activity was not altered (Fig. 2 B). Curcuminoid treatment of otherwise untreated cells for 30 min did not alter the basal DNA binding activity to the two probes under examination (Fig. 2, A and B, compareSF and Cur lanes). However, curcuminoid treatment inhibited the PMA stimulation of DNA binding activities for AP-1 and NF-κB, as previously reported (Fig. 2 A). The new finding of this study was that curcuminoid treatment had a similar effect on transcription factor activation by FGF-2. Thus, activation of AP-1 DNA binding activity stimulated by FGF-2 was inhibited, but basal DNA binding activity was unaffected (Fig. 2 B). These findings indicate that curcuminoids distinguish basal and PMA- or FGF-2-stimulated signaling pathways. Furthermore, although FGF-2 activates different signaling pathways than PMA in corneal stromal cells, curcuminoids are as effective in blocking the FGF-2 pathway as they are in blocking the PMA-stimulated signaling pathway. To determine the role of NF-κB and AP-1 response elements for gelatinase B promoter activity, we performed transfection experiments with a series of gelatinase B promoter-reporter gene fusion constructs (Fig. 3 A). The first construct, −519 CAT (encompasing promoter sequences between −519 and +19) lacks a functional NF-κB site since the 5′ trucation removes four of the ten consensus nucleotides required for NF-κB-mediated transcription (31.Fini M.E.

Integrins are heterodimeric proteins composed of an α- and β-subunit, each with a 950–1100-amino acid extracellular domain and short (ranging from 15 to 77 amino acids) cytoplasmic tail (2.Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 506-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The adhesion of integrins to their ligands is not constitutive, but it is dynamically regulated by conformational changes in integrin extracellular domains, by intracellular signal transduction pathways that reorganize intracytoplasmic (especially cytoskeletal) connections, and by up-regulation and/or redistribution of integrins on the cell surface (2.Diamond M.S.

Our recent studies have focused on the regulation of integrin function by uPAR.Several different lines of evidence indicate that integrins interact with uPAR both physically and functionally. In monocytes, uPAR co-purifies with Mac-1 and Src family kinases under mild denaturing conditions (10.Bohuslav J. Horejsi V. Hansmann C. Stockl J. Weilde U.H. Majdic O. Bartke I. Knapp W. Stockinger H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1381-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Immunolocalization studies show uPAR and Mac-1 to co-cluster in the presence of antibodies to either receptor and to dissociate as cells polarize in vitro in response to chemoattractants, uPAR moving to the lamellipodium and Mac-1 to the uropod (11.Kindzelskii A.L. Laska Z.O. Todd R.F.I. Petty H.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 297-309PubMed Google Scholar). Resonance energy transfer microscopy also indicates that uPAR dynamically associates with β1- and β3-integrins and suggests that this association is favored by integrin binding to extracellular matrices (12.Xue W. Kindzelski A.L. Todd R.F. Petty H.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4630-4640PubMed Google Scholar). Migration of tumor cells on vitronectin using αvβ5 is reported to require uPAR (13.Yebra M. Parry G.C.N.

Our own studies using co-immunoprecipitation and purified recombinant proteins indicate that uPAR forms complexes with a subset of β1- and β2-integrins (14.Wei Y. Lukasev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) and modulates the signaling capacity of these integrins (8.Wei Y. Yang X. Wilkins J. Chapman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar).Although uPAR appears to interact with numerous integrins, the functional consequences of integrin interactions with uPAR have been most extensively studied with β2-integrins. Human monocytic cells rendered deficient in uPAR by treatment with antisense oligonucleotides have defective Mac-1-dependent adhesion to fibrinogen and migration on plastic (15.Sitrin R.G. Todd R.F.R. Albrecht E. Gyetko M.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1942-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A recent study of uPAR-deficient mice reported defective β2- integrin-dependent migration of neutrophils into the peritoneal cavity of mice injected with thioglycollate (16.May A.E. Kanse S.M. Lund L.R. Gisler R.H. Imhof B.A. Preissner K.T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Mac-1 and uPAR appear to form a bidirectional functional unit on monocytic cells. Induction of Mac-1 and uPAR expression on monocytic cell lines by cytokine stimulation conferred urokinase and uPAR-dependent adhesion to vitronectin, which was further promoted by engagement of Mac-1 (17.Simon D.I. Rao N.K. Xu H. Wei Y. Majdic O. Ronne E. Kobzik L. Chapman H.A. Blood. 1996; 88: 3185-3194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, saturation of uPAR by exogenous urokinase inhibited Mac-1 function, implying uPAR can inhibit as well as promote integrin function. A molecular explanation for this finding as well as the site(s) of interaction between Mac-1 and uPAR remain obscure. In this study, we have used cells stably transfected with uPAR and chimeric CD18 integrins and purified, recombinant forms of these receptors to define the interaction site between uPAR and Mac-1. We identify a sequence corresponding to amino acids 424–440 in the region between the I-domain and highly conserved divalent cation binding repeats of CD11b as a critical Mac-1 binding site for uPAR. By virtue of its uPAR binding properties, a peptide composed of this sequence (M25) disrupts the association of uPAR with a subset of β1- and β2-integrins and, thereby, blocks postreceptor integrin function.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have identified a non-I-domain peptide sequence, M25, within the α-chain of Mac-1 (αM424–440) that critically regulates the interaction of Mac-1 to the non-integrin receptor uPAR. On the basis of homology with G protein-coupled receptors, Springer (27.Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) has proposed that the N-terminal region (∼450 amino acids) of integrin α-subunits folds into a β-propeller. In this model (see Fig. 1 B), repeating units (W1–W7) of anti-parallel β-sheets connected by surface loops (∼60 amino acids/unit) arrange into a torus around a small central cavity. The upper surface loops are thought to contain the major ligand-binding sites that synergize with the RGD-binding site on the β-chain to define the specificity and affinity of interactions of integrins with their ligands. The disc-like propeller is connected to and spans the plasma membrane via a C-terminal stalk. In β2-integrins, a 200-amino acid I-domain, also directly implicated in ligand binding, is inserted between repeats 2 and 3 (19.Diamond M. Garcia-Aguiliar J. Bickford J. Corbi A. Springer T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 28.Michishita M. Videm V. Arnaout M.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). In the β-propeller model, M25 comprises the entire upper loop sequence of W4 and extends into the third β-strand of this repeat. Since the upper W4 loops of other integrin α-chains have been directly implicated in integrin ligand binding (29.Irie A. Kamata T. Takada Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 7198-7203Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), our results indicate that uPAR, which does not contain an RGD sequence, may now be considered as an atypical integrin ligand. As a non-I-domain binding ligand influencing the function of Mac-1, uPAR resembles factor X (30.Zhou L. Lee D.H. Plescia J. Lau C.Y. Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17075-17079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Mesri M. Plescia J. Altieri D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 744-748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The precise region(s) within Mac-1 mediating factor X binding is, however, unknown. Preliminary experiments indicate that factor X fails to compete with suPAR binding to immobilized M25 (data not shown).Identification of a uPAR-binding sequence in αM and the recognition that uPAR is a cis-acting integrin ligand may explain several previously obscure features of the interaction between Mac-1 and uPAR: the strong promoting effect of the “active” state of Mac-1 on uPAR/Mac-1 binding (14.Wei Y. Lukasev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar), the ability of suPAR to block the binding of known ligands such as factor X and FGN to Mac-1 (17.Simon D.I. Rao N.K. Xu H. Wei Y. Majdic O. Ronne E. Kobzik L. Chapman H.A. Blood. 1996; 88: 3185-3194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the co-localization of uPAR and Mac-1 on leukocytes expressing these receptors (10.Bohuslav J. Horejsi V. Hansmann C. Stockl J. Weilde U.H. Majdic O. Bartke I. Knapp W. Stockinger H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1381-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 12.Xue W. Kindzelski A.L. Todd R.F. Petty H.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4630-4640PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the positioning of M25 on Mac-1 may also explain our observation that disruption of uPAR/Mac-1 association on PMA-stimulated THP-1 cells by M25 promotes FGN binding to these cells (Fig. 5 B). The I-domain binding site for FGN and the W4 binding site for uPAR may be in close proximity in the folded Mac-1. If so, the additional finding that the urokinase promotes the binding of uPAR to Mac-1, as reflected in M25 binding (Fig. 2 B), may explain why saturation of uPAR with urokinase inhibits FGN binding/turnover by Mac-1 (17.Simon D.I. Rao N.K. Xu H. Wei Y. Majdic O. Ronne E. Kobzik L. Chapman H.A. Blood. 1996; 88: 3185-3194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Table I). Finally, our observations may also explain the suggestion of other investigators that uPAR may “activate” integrins (16.May A.E. Kanse S.M. Lund L.R. Gisler R.H. Imhof B.A. Preissner K.T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Ligand binding to integrins is a recognized mechanism for integrin activation (2.Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 506-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The intriguing possibility that uPAR may activate Mac-1 via trans-type intercellular interactions as well as through the cis-type interactions identified here remains to be explored.The specificity of the interaction between M25 and uPAR was established using peptides corresponding to analogous sequences from LFA-1 (L25) or p150,95 (P25). Biotinylated suPAR bound immobilized M25, and this binding was blocked efficiently by soluble M25 but not by scM25, L25, or P25. These results indicate that among β2-integrins uPAR appears to react preferentially with Mac-1 in this otherwise homologous (>80%) α-subunit region between the I-domain and highly conserved divalent cation repeats. However, transient physical linkage between uPAR and p150,95 has been reported in activated neutrophils using resonance energy transfer microscopy (32.Kindzelski A.L. Eszes M.M. Todd III, R.F. Petty H.R. Biophys. J. 1997; 73: 1777-1784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This is consistent with data reported in Table I that uPAR has a weak effect on p150,95 function in CHO cell co-transfectants. A recent study of uPAR-deficient mice reported defective LFA-1-dependent migration of neutrophils into the peritoneal cavity of mice injected with thioglycollate (16.May A.E. Kanse S.M. Lund L.R. Gisler R.H. Imhof B.A. Preissner K.T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Although the M25 site on Mac-1 appears to be the most robust interaction site for uPAR among β2-integrins, we cannot exclude additional interaction site(s) between uPAR and Mac-1 or other β2-integrins.Our recent studies and that of other investigators indicate that uPAR interacts not only with Mac-1 but with a class of β1-integrins. Although the binding site(s) for uPAR on these integrins is currently uncertain, the rules of physical interaction between uPAR and β1 integrins appear to be similar to those observed for Mac-1: binding of suPAR to α5/β1 is promoted by activating TS2/16 antibodies, 2Y. Wei and D. I. Simon, unpublished observation. and matrix engagement (33.Xue W. Mizukami I. Todd R.F.I. Petty H.R. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 1682-1689PubMed Google Scholar), and suPAR blocks fibronectin binding to activated α5/β1 (14.Wei Y. Lukasev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). The fact that M25 blocks the co-precipitation of uPAR with β1-integrins (Fig.4 A) suggests a similar mode of physical interaction, and elucidation of analogous sequences in α-chains associated with β1-integrins is under active investigation. Whether uPAR and other nonintegrin membrane proteins, which are reported to bind β1- and/or β2-integrins (4.Berditchevski F. Zutter M.M. Hemler M.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 193-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 5.Maecker H.T. Todd S.C. Levy S. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 429-442Crossref Scopus (804) Google Scholar) (e.g. tetraspan-4 superfamily members), share a common site of interaction with uPAR also remains to be defined.Although binding of uPAR to Mac-1 and other integrins inhibits additional ligand binding to this integrin, as reflected by dramatically altered adhesion in Fig. 3 B, numerous studies document that uPAR promotes normal β1- and β2-integrin functions, including Mac-1-dependent adhesion to FGN and endothelial cellsin vitro (15.Sitrin R.G. Todd R.F.R. Albrecht E. Gyetko M.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1942-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 17.Simon D.I. Rao N.K. Xu H. Wei Y. Majdic O. Ronne E. Kobzik L. Chapman H.A. Blood. 1996; 88: 3185-3194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and vascular emigration in vivo(16.May A.E. Kanse S.M. Lund L.R. Gisler R.H. Imhof B.A. Preissner K.T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The findings reported here that M25 impairs Mac-1 dependent adhesion to FGN and stimulated endothelial cells (Fig. 5) and β1-dependent migration of SMC on fibronectin and collagen (Fig. 7) are consistent with these prior reports. How can this occur? Two observations reported here appear to be instructive. First, M25 impairs Mac-1-dependent adhesion of THP-1 cells to FGN, while at the same time promoting binding of soluble FGN to Mac-1 on these cells (Fig. 5). Second, disruption of uPAR·integrin complexes by uPAR-binding peptides removes uPAR not only from integrin complexes but also from Src family kinases (Fig. 4; Ref. 8.Wei Y. Yang X. Wilkins J. Chapman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Whereas soluble ligands can bind to surface integrins at 4 °C, adhesion of cells to immobilized ligands requires both integrin clustering and cell signaling, events collectively termed “post-receptor binding events” (3.Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref Scopus (1460) Google Scholar). Because uPAR promotes the association of signaling molecules with integrins, we favor the view that its primary role in integrin clusters is to promote the post-receptor binding events important to β1- and β2-integrin function. This hypothesis implies that uPAR is present within integrin clusters in far fewer numbers than the integrin molecules themselves. Viewed in this perspective, the ligand-like binding of uPAR to Mac-1 is a mechanism to enrich and localize integrin clusters with important signaling molecules necessary for efficient integrin signaling, although this may be at the expense of decreasing the total number of ligand binding sites available. For example, the number of FGN binding sites on THP-1 cells is lower when uPAR is associated with Mac-1, and yet THP-1 cells only adhere well to FGN when uPAR is Mac-1-associated (Fig. 5). Available data are consistent with a similar role for uPAR in regulating post-receptor binding events important to β1integrin function (Fig. 7; Refs. 8.Wei Y. Yang X. Wilkins J. Chapman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar and 34.Ghiso J.A. Kovalski K. Ossowski L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 89-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). In contrast to β1-integrin·uPAR complexes, however, important signaling molecules interacting with Mac-1 as a consequence of uPAR association remain undefined.Currently, strategies to inhibit integrin function in settings of deleterious inflammation and tumor progression are based on direct inhibition of integrin ligand binding to matrix proteins (such as fibronectin) or cellular counterreceptors (such as the Ig family of adhesion receptors). To our knowledge, the M25 sequence described in this report is the first sequence in the extracellular domain of an integrin that broadly impairs integrin adhesion and migration to matrix proteins without directly inhibiting overall ligand binding. This observation raises the possibility that inhibition of integrin/uPAR interactions could complement existing strategies for therapeutic regulation of integrin function. A particularly attractive feature of this strategy is that uPAR is not constitutively expressed on most cells or is expressed only at low levels. Instead, uPAR is strongly up-regulated on migrating inflammatory cells and on tumor cells, where uPAR expression strongly correlates with tumor progression (34.Ghiso J.A. Kovalski K. Ossowski L. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 89-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar, 35.Hofmann R. Lehmer A. Buresh M. Hartung R. Ulm K. Cancer. 1996; 78: 487-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, reagents such as M25 may have the benefit that they should only impair integrin function of the cells most desirable to target. The integrin family of adhesion receptors is involved in inflammation, immunity, hemostasis, and tumor metastasis (1.Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar). Integrins are heterodimeric proteins composed of an α- and β-subunit, each with a 950–1100-amino acid extracellular domain and short (ranging from 15 to 77 amino acids) cytoplasmic tail (2.Diamond M.S. Springer T.A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 506-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The adhesion of integrins to their ligands is not constitutive, but it is dynamically regulated by conformational changes in integrin extracellular domains, by intracellular signal transduction pathways that reorganize intracytoplasmic (especially cytoskeletal) connections, and by up-regulation and/or redistribution of integrins on the cell surface (2.Diamond M.S.

Wilkins J. Chapman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Our recent studies have focused on the regulation of integrin function by uPAR. Several different lines of evidence indicate that integrins interact with uPAR both physically and functionally. In monocytes, uPAR co-purifies with Mac-1 and Src family kinases under mild denaturing conditions (10.Bohuslav J. Horejsi V. Hansmann C. Stockl J. Weilde U.H. Majdic O. Bartke I. Knapp W. Stockinger H. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1381-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Immunolocalization studies show uPAR and Mac-1 to co-cluster in the presence of antibodies to either receptor and to dissociate as cells polarize in vitro in response to chemoattractants, uPAR moving to the lamellipodium and Mac-1 to the uropod (11.Kindzelskii A.L. Laska Z.O. Todd R.F.I. Petty H.R. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 297-309PubMed Google Scholar). Resonance energy transfer microscopy also indicates that uPAR dynamically associates with β1- and β3-integrins and suggests that this association is favored by integrin binding to extracellular matrices (12.Xue W. Kindzelski A.L. Todd R.F. Petty H.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4630-4640PubMed Google Scholar). Migration of tumor cells on vitronectin using αvβ5 is reported to require uPAR (13.Yebra M. Parry G.C.N.

Our own studies using co-immunoprecipitation and purified recombinant proteins indicate that uPAR forms complexes with a subset of β1- and β2-integrins (14.Wei Y. Lukasev M. Simon D.I. Bodary S.C. Rosenberg S. Doyle M.V. Chapman H.A. Science. 1996; 273: 1551-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar) and modulates the signaling capacity of these integrins (8.Wei Y. Yang X. Wilkins J. Chapman H.A. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Although uPAR appears to interact with numerous integrins, the functional consequences of integrin interactions with uPAR have been most extensively studied with β2-integrins. Human monocytic cells rendered deficient in uPAR by treatment with antisense oligonucleotides have defective Mac-1-dependent adhesion to fibrinogen and migration on plastic (15.Sitrin R.G. Todd R.F.R. Albrecht E. Gyetko M.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1942-1951Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). A recent study of uPAR-deficient mice reported defective β2- integrin-dependent migration of neutrophils into the peritoneal cavity of mice injected with thioglycollate (16.May A.E. Kanse S.M. Lund L.R. Gisler R.H. Imhof B.A. Preissner K.T. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1029-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Mac-1 and uPAR appear to form a bidirectional functional unit on monocytic cells. Induction of Mac-1 and uPAR expression on monocytic cell lines by cytokine stimulation conferred urokinase and uPAR-dependent adhesion to vitronectin, which was further promoted by engagement of Mac-1 (17.Simon D.I. Rao N.K. Xu H. Wei Y. Majdic O. Ronne E. Kobzik L. Chapman H.A. Blood. 1996; 88: 3185-3194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, saturation of uPAR by exogenous urokinase inhibited Mac-1 function, implying uPAR can inhibit as well as promote integrin function. A molecular explanation for this finding as well as the site(s) of interaction between Mac-1 and uPAR remain obscure. In this study, we have used cells stably transfected with uPAR and chimeric CD18 integrins and purified, recombinant forms of these receptors to define the interaction site between uPAR and Mac-1. We identify a sequence corresponding to amino acids 424–440 in the region between the I-domain and highly conserved divalent cation binding repeats of CD11b as a critical Mac-1 binding site for uPAR. By virtue of its uPAR binding properties, a peptide composed of this sequence (M25) disrupts the association of uPAR with a subset of β1- and β2-integrins and, thereby, blocks postreceptor integrin function. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we have identified a non-I-domain peptide sequence, M25, within the α-chain of Mac-1 (αM424–440) that critically regulates the interaction of Mac-1 to the non-integrin receptor uPAR. On the basis of homology with G protein-coupled receptors, Springer (27.Springer T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) has proposed that the N-terminal region (∼450 amino acids) of integrin α-subunits folds into a β-propeller. In this model (see Fig. 1 B), repeating units (W1–W7) of anti-parallel β-sheets connected by surface loops (∼60 amino acids/unit) arrange into a torus around a small central cavity. The upper surface loops are thought to contain the major ligand-binding sites that synergize with the RGD-binding site on the β-chain to define the specificity and affinity of interactions of integrins with their ligands. The disc-like propeller is connected to and spans the plasma membrane via a C-terminal stalk. In β2-integrins, a 200-amino acid I-domain, also directly implicated in ligand binding, is inserted between repeats 2 and 3 (19.Diamond M. Garcia-Aguiliar J. Bickford J. Corbi A. Springer T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1031-1043Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar, 28.Michishita M. Videm V. Arnaout M.A. Cell. 1993; 72: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar).

The interaction of CTIP1 with ARP1 was studied in detail, and CTIP1 was found to harbor two independent ARP1 interaction domains, ID1 and ID2, whereas the putative AF-2 of ARP1 was required for interaction with CTIP1. CTIP1, which exhibited a punctate staining pattern within the nucleus of transfected cells, recruited cotransfected ARP1 to these foci and potentiated ARP1-mediated transcriptional repression of a reporter construct. However, transcriptional repression mediated by ARP1 acting through CTIP1 did not appear to involve recruitment of a trichostatin A-sensitive histone deacetylase(s) to the template, suggesting that this repression pathway may be distinct from that utilized by several other nuclear receptors.

Deletion of the COUP-TFI gene in the mouse results in defects in axonal guidance and aberrant neuronal arborization (18.Qiu Y. Pereira F.A. DeMayo F.J. Lydon J.P. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1925-1937Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Such defects involving the glossopharyngeal ganglion and IXth cranial nerve appear to be causally associated with perinatal lethality in COUP-TFI null animals (18.Qiu Y. Pereira F.A. DeMayo F.J.

However, Ear2 heterodimerizes with both COUP-TFI and ARP1 in solution and on various, directly repeated DNA response elements (21.Avram D. Ishmael J.E. Nevrivy D.J. Peterson V.J. Lee S.H. Dowell P.

COUP-TF family members are generally considered to be repressors of transcription, and several mechanisms have been proposed to underlie this activity (22.Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.-J. Endocr. Rev. 1997; 18: 229-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Among these, active transcriptional repression mediated by COUP-TFs may involve recruitment of nuclear receptor co-repressor (NCoR) and/or silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptor (SMRT) to the template (23.Shibata H.

Toward the goal of elucidating potential mechanisms of COUP-TF signaling, we employed a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins expressed in brain that interact with and may be implicated in transcriptional repression mediated by ARP1. Here we show that CTIP1, a member of a novel family of C2H2 zinc finger proteins that was isolated as an ARP1 interaction partner, harbors autonomous transcriptional repression domains and potentiates ARP1-mediated transcriptional repression independently of trichostatin A-sensitive histone deacetylation. Both CTIP1 and the related CTIP2 are highly expressed in the brain, a tissue also known to express COUP-TF family members abundantly (3.Jonk L.J.C. de Jonge E.J. Pals C.E.G.M. Wissink S.

Fragments corresponding to CTIP1 and CTIP2 (see Fig. 1 A) were used to screen mouse cDNA libraries obtained from CLONTECH and from Dr. René Hen (Columbia University), yielding several overlapping clones. These overlapping clones were then used to prepare a full-length CTIP1 construct that was inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector, pCDNA3+ (Invitrogen).

CATH.a cell RNA was isolated using TRI-REAGENT (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH) and poly(A)+ RNA was purified on oligo(dT)-cellulose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Brain poly(A)+ RNA was obtained from Ambion. Northern blot analyses were performed following standard procedures, using probes corresponding to the yeast two-hybrid clones of CTIP1 and CTIP2. Forty-eight hours following transfection, HEK293 cells growing on coverslips were fixed and permeabilized in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Tween. Antibody incubations were performed using standard techniques with the anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (Invitrogen) or anti-HA rabbit polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Myc-ARP1 immune complexes were detected using tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc.). HA-CTIP1 immune complexes were detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibodies (Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc.).

The protein fragments encoded by these novel clones share 88% identity over a 110-amino acid region located at the carboxyl terminus of both proteins (Fig.1 A). CTIP1 (Fig. 1 B) and CTIP2 (Fig.1 C) interacted strongly in yeast with all members of the COUP-TF family, COUP-TF1, ARP1, and Ear2 (4.Escriva H. Safi R. Hanni C. Langlois M.-C. Saumitou-Laprade P. Stehelin D. Capron A. Pierce R. Laudet V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6803-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). However, neither CTIP1 nor CTIP2 interacted with other nuclear receptors examined, including retinoic acid receptor γ (RARγ), retinoid X receptor α (RXRα), and PPARα, all of which were tested in the presence and absence of activating ligands (Fig. 1, B and C; data not shown). In addition, CTIP1 and CTIP2 did not interact with an unrelated bait corresponding to the carboxyl tail (amino acids 835–938) of the NR1 subunit of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (36.Moriyoshi K. Masu M. Ishii T. Shigemoto R. Mizuno N. Nakanishi S. Nature. 1991; 354: 31-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1632) Google Scholar). In vitro protein-protein interaction studies confirmed the results of experiments carried out in yeast in that both CTIPs were observed to interact directly and specifically with all COUP-TF family members (Fig. 1 D). The CTIP1 and CTIP2 fragments isolated from the yeast two-hybrid library were used as probes to obtain full-length cDNAs from mouse brain cDNA libraries. A 2.7-kb CTIP1 fragment (GenBankTM accession number AF186018), which was constructed from several overlapping clones (data not shown), contains an open reading frame encoding a protein comprised of 776 amino acids with a predicted mass of 84,116 Da (Fig.2 A). Several overlapping fragments totaling nearly 3.0 kb of CTIP2 coding sequence (GenBankTM accession number AF186019) have been isolated (Fig. 2 B); however, the reading frame of this clone remains open at the 5′-end (data not shown). CTIP1 and CTIP2 are highly related over much of the amino acid sequence of each (Fig. 2 C). The predicted amino acid sequences of both proteins are characterized by two centrally located C2H2 zinc fingers that share extensive homology (95% identity; see Fig. 2 C). CTIP2 harbors three additional C2H2 zinc fingers at the carboxyl terminus of the protein, two of which are related to the central zinc fingers of both CTIP1 and CTIP2 (71% identity). The amino termini of CTIP1 and CTIP2 are also related over large blocks of amino acid residues, including a conserved C2HC putative zinc finger motif (Fig. 2, A-C), suggesting a commonality of function. A CTIP1 probe corresponding to the yeast two-hybrid clone hybridized to transcripts of approximately 1.2 and 2.7 kb on Northern blots of mRNA isolated from mouse brain and from CATH.a cells (33.Suri C. Fung B.P. Tischler A.S. Chikaraishi D.M. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 1280-1291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a catecholaminergic cell line of neuronal origin (Fig. 2 D). The ∼1.2-kb CTIP1 transcript corresponds to a splice variant that encodes a form of CTIP1 lacking the central core of the protein. 2D. Avram, A. Fields, K. Pretty On Top, D. J. Nevrivy, J. E. Ishmael, and M. Leid, unpublished data. The function of this short form of CTIP1 is presently unknown. In contrast, a CTIP2 probe corresponding to the yeast two-hybrid clone hybridized to a single transcript of 5.7 kb (Fig. 2 D). CTIP1 expression was detected at high levels in brain and at lower levels in embryo (10–12.5 days postcoitum), heart, and liver (Fig.2 E). Note, however, that the CTIP1 PCR primers and Southern probe used in these analyses only detect the long form of CTIP1. In addition to embryo and brain, CTIP2 transcripts were detected in lung but not in liver or heart (Fig. 2 E), indicating that the tissue expression patterns of the two CTIP genes are only partially overlapping. GST pull-down experiments, employing full-length proteins and truncation mutants thereof, were conducted to verify observations made in yeast and to map the respective interaction domains of ARP1 and CTIP1. Full-length ARP1 (residues 1–414) interacted with full-length CTIP1 (residues 1–776) in vitro(Fig. 3 A), and this interaction did not require the ARP1 DNA binding domain or the amino-terminal (A/B) or hinge (D) regions (Fig. 3 A). However, the putative ARP1 AF-2 core, amino acids 395–399 (37.Achatz G. Holzi B. Speckmayer R. Hauser C. Sandhofer F. Paulweber B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4914-4932Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), was required for this interaction inasmuch as deletion of this region completely abolished in vitro interaction with CTIP1 (ARP1-(1–394); Fig. 3 A). Full-length CTIP1 interacted with full-length ARP1 in vitro (Fig.3 B; see also Fig. 3 A). Surprisingly, in the context of the full-length protein, deletion of the carboxyl terminus of CTIP1, which is sufficient to mediate interaction with ARP1 in vitro (Fig. 1 D) and harbors the CTIP2 homology domain (see Fig. 2 C), did not appear to disrupt interaction with full-length ARP1 (Fig. 3 B). This unexpected finding suggests that CTIP1 may contain an additional ARP1 interaction domain(s), and, to address this possibility, additional CTIP1 truncation mutants were prepared and tested for interaction with full-length ARP1. Deletion of the CTIP1 carboxyl terminus up to but not including zinc finger 4 did not alter interaction with ARP1 (data not shown), and further deletion of zinc fingers 3 and 4 similarly did not affect the ability of the protein to interact with full-length ARP1 in vitro(CTIP1-(1–378); Fig. 3 B). However, deletion of an additional 115 amino acids abolished interaction of CTIP1 with ARP1 (CTIP1-(1–263); Fig. 3 B). These findings suggest that a second ARP1 interaction interface, hereafter referred to as ID2, is localized, at least in part, between CTIP1 amino acids 264 and 378. Therefore, the carboxyl-terminal ARP1 interaction domain, which is localized between CTIP1 amino acids 602 and 776 (Fig. 3 B) and contains the CTIP2 homology region, is hereafter referred to as ID1. Deletion of the amino-terminal region of CTIP1, which includes ID2, did not disrupt interaction with full-length ARP1 (CTIP1-(407–776); Fig. 3 B), presumably because this mutant utilizes CTIP1 ID1 in a manner similar to that of CTIP1-(602–776). Thus, the mechanistic basis of the interaction between ARP1 and CTIP1 is reasonably complex in that at least two CTIP1 interaction interfaces are implicated, ID2 (amino acids 264–378) and ID1 (amino acids 602–776). The bipartite ARP1 interaction domain of CTIP1 is reminiscent of NCoR, which also harbors two nuclear receptor interaction domains (38.Seol W. Mahon M.J. Lee Y.K. Moore D.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1646-1655PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that full-length ARP1 and CTIP1 interact in vitro. This interaction requires the putative AF-2 core of ARP1 and one of two regions of CTIP1, ID1 or ID2. Cotransfection experiments were conducted in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells to determine the functional significance of the interaction observed between CTIP1 and ARP1 in yeast and in vitro. ARP1 is known to bind strongly as a homodimeric complex to a direct repeat of the hexanucleotide, AGGTCA, spaced by 1 base pair (DR1; Refs. 8.Cooney A.J. Tsai S.Y. O'Malley B.W. Tsai M.-J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4153-4163Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar and 21.Avram D. Ishmael J.E. Nevrivy D.J. Peterson V.J. Lee S.H. Dowell P. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14331-14336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, cotransfection of ARP1 with a reporter gene driven by a DR1-containing promoter had only a negligible effect on expression of the reporter gene in HEK293 cells (Fig. 4 A,lanes 1 and 2). Cotransfection with increasing amounts of full-length CTIP1 resulted in a strong repression of this reporter in the presence (Fig. 4 A, lanes 3–5) but not in the absence (Fig. 4 B, lanes 3–5) of ARP1, indicating that recruitment of CTIP1 to the DR1-bound ARP1 complex resulted in transcriptional repression. CTIP1-(1–601), which lacks the CTIP1 ID1, only weakly potentiated ARP1-mediated repression of the reporter (Fig. 4 A, compare lanes 3–5 and 6–8). This finding suggested that ID1 and/or additional residues localized within or around the CTIP1 carboxyl terminus may play an important role(s) in transcriptional repression mediated by ARP1·CTIP1 complexes in cells. CTIP1-(407–776), which contains ID1 but not ID2 and interacted with ARP1 in vitro (Fig. 2 B), did not potentiate ARP1-mediated transcriptional repression (Fig. 4 A,lanes 9–11). However, this mutant also lacks the major CTIP1 repression domain contained within the amino terminus of the protein (see below). CTIP1-(1–378), which contains ID2, but not ID1, did not potentiate the transcriptional repression activity of ARP1 (Fig. 4 A, lanes 12–14), nor did the amino-terminal mutant, CTIP1-(1–263), which lacks both ARP1 interaction domains (Fig. 4 A, lanes 15–17). Transcriptional repression mediated by ARP1·CTIP1 complexes was only minimally sensitive to reversal by the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA, Ref. 39.Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar; Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 9 and 10), whereas this compound nearly completely reversed NCoR-mediated repression of PPARα·RXRα complexes (Ref.28.Dowell P. Ishmael J.E. Avram D. Peterson V.J. Nevrivy D.J. Leid M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15901-15907Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar; Fig. 4 C, lanes 3–6). These findings suggest that CTIP1-mediated transcriptional repression probably does not involve recruitment of a TSA-sensitive histone deacetylase(s) to the template and, therefore, appears to be mechanistically distinct from that mediated by NCoR (or SMRT) acting through the histone deacetylase complex (29.Heinzel T. Lavinsky R.M. Mullen T.M. Soderstrom M. Laherty C.D. Torchia J. Yang W.M. Brard G. Ngo S.D. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G.

Cell. 1997; 89: 373-380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). To confirm the association of CTIP1 and ARP1 within the nucleus, cotransfected cells were examined by indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. HA-CTIP1 presented a distinct punctate distribution in interphase nuclei in approximately 80% of transfected cells examined, with the remaining 20% being composed of a combination of focal and diffuse staining (Fig.5 A, see also Fig.6 A and TableI). In contrast, Myc-ARP1 exhibited a diffuse nuclear staining pattern in 100% of 120 transfected cells examined when transfected independently (Fig. 5 C). However, when cotransfected with HA-CTIP1, Myc-ARP1 was recruited to the punctate structures defined by HA-CTIP1 staining (Fig. 6 B). Overlaying the corresponding images revealed that the nuclear localization of the two proteins was entirely coincident in all transfected cells examined (Fig. 6 C). This finding strongly suggests that HA-CTIP1 and Myc-ARP1 interact directly within the nuclei of cotransfected HEK293 cells as evidenced by the ability of the former protein to disrupt the nuclear localization of the latter protein. HA-CTIP1-(1–601), a mutant that interacts in vitro with (Fig. 3 B) and weakly potentiates the transcriptional activity of ARP1 in cotransfected cells (Fig. 4 A), formed less well defined punctate structures and appeared to be localized in larger blocks within interphase nuclei (Fig. 6 E). These blocks appeared to be a mixture of foci superimposed upon a partially diffuse staining pattern that was clearly distinct from the highly punctate bodies in which HA-CTIP1 was found (Fig. 6 A; see also Table I). However, HA-CTIP1 1–601, which contains ID2 but not ID1, interacted with and recruited Myc-ARP1 to these loci (Fig. 6,F and G), albeit less efficiently than full-length CTIP1 (see Fig. 6, B and C). The carboxyl-terminal mutant, HA-CTIP1-(407–776), which interactedin vitro with ARP1 (Fig. 3 B) but did not potentiate ARP1-mediated repression in cells (Fig. 4 A), was found to exhibit a completely diffuse nuclear staining in all cells examined (Fig. 6 I; see also Table I). Although the staining pattern observed for HA-CTIP1-(407–776), which contains ID1 but not ID2, and Myc-ARP1 appeared coincident within the nucleus, this amino-terminal truncation mutant was clearly incapable of localizing in or redistributing Myc-ARP1 to punctate bodies (Fig. 6, J andK). Two amino-terminal CTIP1 fragments (HA-CTIP1-(1–378) and HA-CTIP1-(1–263)) also did not localize in (Fig. 6, Mand Q, respectively) or recruit Myc-ARP1 to (Fig. 6,panels N and O and panels R and S, respectively) punctate bodies. These mutants also exhibited extensive cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 6,M and Q, respectively), suggesting that the putative CTIP1 NLS located at codons 569–572, and not those present at codons 186–189 and 631–637 (data not shown), is critical for proper nuclear localization of CTIP1.Figure 6ARP1 is redistributed in the nucleus when cotransfected with CTIP1. HEK293 cells were transiently cotransfected with expression vectors encoding Myc-ARP1 and either HA-CTIP1 or HA-CTIP1 mutants as indicated. The corresponding proteins were localized 48 h after transfection by indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. Cells were stained for HA-CTIP1 (first column) and Myc-ARP1 (second column) as described in the legend of Fig. 5. An overlay of the images presented in the first two columns is shown in the third column, and the fourth columnrepresents counterstaining of the cells with Hoechst"

The CAG codon is translated into glutamine, and the polyglutamine domain is the only region of homology among the eight disease proteins. The length of the repeat is the critical determinant of age-of-disease onset, with repeat length greater than 40 glutamines producing neurodegeneration in seven of the eight diseases (1.Koshy B.T.

Proteins with expanded polyglutamine domains also aggregate, and aggregation is a pathologic hallmark of the polyglutamine repeat diseases (13.Hackam A.S. Singaraja R. Wellington C.L. Metzler M.

These polyglutamine length-dependent properties may arise from the ability of long polyglutamine domains to adopt unique three-dimensional conformations and serve to confer the disease proteins with a pathologic gain of function (15.Perutz M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 58-63Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 16.Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3342-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Lansbury proposed that during the initial stages of folding of expanded polyglutamine proteins, misfolded intermediates interact with themselves (homologous interactions) or other proteins (heterologous interactions), leading to critical cell injury (16.Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3342-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Supporting this hypothesis of length-dependent alteration in tertiary structure, Trottier et al. (17.Trottier Y. Lutz Y. Stevanin G. Imbert G. Devys D. Cancel G. Saudou F. Weber C. David G. Tora L. Nature. 1995; 378: 403-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) identified a monoclonal antibody (1C2) that preferentially recognizes proteins with long, but not short, polyglutamine domains. Since monoclonal antibody 1C2 recognizes the unique conformation of long polyglutamine domains, we reasoned that peptides with similar polyglutamine-binding properties could be identified by screening peptide libraries. Peptides that selectively bind pathologic-length polyglutamine domains may inhibit interaction with other proteins, thereby slowing, or preventing, disease pathology. In this paper, we identify several polyglutamine-binding peptides and demonstrate the ability of one of these peptides to inhibit polyglutamine aggregation both in a novelin vitro assay and in cultured cells. We further demonstrate that expression of a tandem repeat of a polyglutamine-binding peptide in cell culture inhibits polyglutamine-induced cell death. Phage display library construction and screening were performed as described (18.Adey N.B. Sparks A.B. Beasley J. Kay B.K. Kay B.K. Winter J. McCafferty J. Phage Display of Peptides and Proteins. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 66-78Google Scholar, 19.Sparks A.B. Adey N.B. Cwirla S. Kay B.K. Kay B.K. Winter J. McCafferty J. Phage Display of Peptides and Proteins. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 227-254Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, 33-mer nucleotides were ligated to the 5′ terminus of the pIII gene of phage M13 to generate a peptide library with 11 amino acids added to the amino terminus of the pIII protein. Individual phage libraries were screened for binding to a polyglutamine-glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein with 62 glutamines (Q62-GST).1Construction of the polyglutamine-GST vectors was described previously (20.Onodera O. Roses A.D. Tsuji S. Vance J.M. Strittmatter W.J. Burke J.R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Q62-GST was immobilized on 96-well plates at a concentration of 2.5 μg/ml in 100 mm NaHCO3, pH 8.5. The wells were then blocked with 0.1% bovine serum albumin to decrease nonspecific binding. After blocking, the plates were washed with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, and phage were incubated for 7 h at room temperature. Unbound phage were removed by extensive washing with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20. Bound phage were eluted sequentially with 50 mm glycine, pH 2.0, and 100 mm ethanolamine prewarmed to 50 °C. Selected phage were isolated, and DNA were sequenced. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed to quantify bound phage using horseradish peroxidase anti-phage antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The CAG repeat of polyglutamine-GST vectors was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and ligated into theNcoI and EcoRI site of the pThio-His B vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) (20.Onodera O. Roses A.D. Tsuji S. Vance J.M. Strittmatter W.J. Burke J.R. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The sequence of the clones and the length of the CAG repeats were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Thioredoxin-polyglutamine fusion protein was produced in transformedEscherichia coli DH5α and purified using BPER lysis buffer (Pierce) and Pro-Bond columns (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Purified thioredoxin-polyglutamine fusion protein was dialyzed against PBS, pH 7.4, and concentration was determined by a modified Lowry reaction (Pierce). Turbidity assays were performed in 200-μl reactions consisting of thioredoxin-polyglutamine in phosphate-buffered saline in 96-well, low protein binding plates. Plates were incubated at 4 °C, and turbidity was measured at 405 nm on a Thermo Max plate reader (Molecular Devices). Peptides were synthesized at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute peptide sequencing facility at Duke University with an acetylated amino terminus and protection of tryptophan witht-butoxycarbonyl during synthesis. Identical results were obtained with peptides obtained from Bio-Synthesis Inc. (Lewisville, TX). Stock solutions of peptides were prepared fresh daily by dissolving in dimethyl sulfoxide at 2.5 mm and incubated with thioredoxin-polyglutamine protein at 0.25–25 μm. The CAG repeats of the Qn-green fluorescent protein vector (7.Onodera O. Burke J.R. Miller S.E. Hester S. Tsuji S. Roses A.D. Strittmatter W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) were inserted into the XhoI and EcoRI sites of the pEYFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) to construct the polyglutamine-YFP (Qn-YFP) vectors. The polyglutamine-binding peptide and control constructs were prepared by ligating synthetic oligonucleotides into the XhoI andBamHI sites of the pECFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH) to obtain glutamine-binding peptide 1-CFP (QBP1-CFP), scrambled QBP1-CFP (SCR-CFP), and a computer-generated random peptide-CFP (RAN)-CFP. The insert of QBP1-CFP was duplicated by polymerase chain reaction to obtain a tandem repeat of QBP1-CFP ((QBP1)2-CFP). The sequence of all constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The first methionine of YFP or CFP was changed to isoleucine by polymerase chain reaction-site-directed mutagenesis to eliminate translation of the fluorescent protein without the polyglutamine domain. The sizes of the fluorescent fusion proteins were confirmed by Western blotting. COS-7 cells were grown and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were transfected with Effectene according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Cells were examined 48 h after transfection using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope equipped with YFP/CFP filter sets (Omega Optical Inc., Brattleboro, VT). The percentage of cells with aggregates was calculated by dividing the number of cells with aggregates by the total number of fluorescent cells, multiplied by 100. Cell viability was examined 48 h after transfection using ethidium homodimer (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Cells were incubated with 5 μm ethidium homodimer for 30 min (37 °C) and then examined under a fluorescence microscope equipped with a rhodamine filter set. Cells with nuclear fluorescence were counted as dead. In each experiment, at least 200 transfected cells were counted. Cells expressing RAN-CFP and Qn-YFP were used as a control to calculate the relative difference in aggregate formation and cell death. Experiments were repeated at least four times. We screened a peptide phage display library to identify peptides that interact with proteins containing a pathologic-length polyglutamine domain. The M13 phage display library was constructed to contain a random 11-amino acid peptide inserted at the amino terminus of the pIII capsid protein (18.Adey N.B. Sparks A.B. Beasley J. Kay B.K. Kay B.K. Winter J. McCafferty J. Phage Display of Peptides and Proteins. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1996: 66-78Google Scholar). The 11-mer peptide was not completely random, since a fixed amino acid was inserted in the sixth position of the peptide (X 5-fixed-X 5) to decrease the vast number of possible peptides (2011) and permit more thorough sampling. 2.5 × 1011 phage from each of the following fixed amino acid libraries were screened for binding to a polyglutamine-glutathione S-transferase fusion protein with 62 glutamines (Q62-GST): aspartate, phenylalanine, histidine, lysine, leucine, proline, and tryptophan (19.Sparks A.B.

Pakzaban P. Galpern W.R. Dinsmore J. Burns L.H. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 1189-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). After four rounds of successive screening, 350 polyglutamine-binding phage clones were isolated. The selected phage were then assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for binding to normal length (Q19) or pathologic-length (Q62) polyglutamine-GST. Six phage clones bound Q62-GST greater than Q19-GST (binding ratios of Q62-GST to Q19-GST: 1.23–1.66) and had their DNA sequenced to elucidate peptide sequence (Table I; QBP1–6).Table IPhage display peptides with preferential binding to Q62-GSTSequence (X 5-fixed-X 5)Q62/Q19binding ratioNameSNWKWWPGIFD1.66QBP1HWWRSWYSDSV1.31QBP2HEWHWWHQEAA1.30QBP3WGLEHFAGNKR1.27QBP4WWRWNWATPVD1.25QBP5WHNYFHWWQDT1.23QBP6WPIWSKGNDWFSCRLSLMEFGCRGARANSNWKWWPGIFDSNWKWWPGIFD(QBP1)2The 11-amino acid inserts in the pIII protein were designed with 5 random amino acids, 1 fixed amino acid (shown here underlined), and 5 random amino acids in aX 5-fixed-X 5 format.

None of these clones bound bovine serum albumin (used as a blocking agent during incubation) or GST alone. We then developed an in vitro aggregation assay to examine whether these polyglutamine-binding peptides inhibit polyglutamine aggregation. Polyglutamine-GST proteins are not ideal for studying polyglutamine aggregation, since the polyglutamine domain does not aggregate unless it is cleaved from the GST moiety (22.Scherzinger E. Lurz R.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4604-4609Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). To circumvent this limitation, we produced thioredoxin-polyglutamine fusion proteins (thio-Qn; where n = the number of consecutive glutamine residues. Thioredoxin is highly soluble, can be expressed at high concentrations in E. coli, and is easily purified (24.Yasukawa T. Kanei-Ishii C. Maekawa T. Fujimoto J. Yamamoto T. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25328-25331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The length of the expressed glutamine domains was chosen to survey a range of normal and pathologic repeat lengths (normal: 19 and 35 glutamines; pathologic: 62 and 81 glutamines) (Fig.1 A). To monitor thioredoxin-polyglutamine protein aggregation, we developed a turbidometric assay, similar to the assays commonly used to study microtubule assembly and β-amyloid aggregation (25.Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury P.T.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1745) Google Scholar, 26.Sloboda R.D. Dentler W.L. Rosenbaum J.L. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 4497-4505Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Solutions of thio-Q62 and thio-Q81 protein increased turbidity in a polyglutamine length-, time-, and concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 1, B andC; time dependence of aggregation of thioredoxin-polyglutamine with 81 glutamines not shown). To demonstrate that turbidity was produced by aggregated thioredoxin-polyglutamine protein containing 62 or 81 glutamines (thio-Q62 orthio-Q81), we pelleted the insoluble material by centrifugation or captured it on a 0.22-μm filter. The pelleted and retained material was confirmed as thioredoxin-polyglutamine fusion protein containing 62 or 81 glutamines on Western blots probed with anti-thioredoxin or anti-polyglutamine antibody (not shown). In contrast, thioredoxin-polyglutamine protein containing 19 or 35 glutamines (thio-Q19 or thio-Q35) was not pelleted by centrifugation and was not trapped by a 0.22-μm filter. In this turbidity assay, thio-Q81 aggregated faster (not shown) and at lower concentrations than thio-Q62 (Fig.1 B). Aggregation did not occur in solutions of thioredoxin-polyglutamine containing 62 glutamines at concentrations lower than 5 μm. As shown in Fig. 1 C, macroscopic aggregation started following a lag period, consistent with a reaction with two kinetic components, an initial slow phase (similar to nidus formation in crystal growth), and a second rapid polymerization phase (23.Scherzinger E. Sittler A. Schweiger K. Heiser V. Lurz R. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4604-4609Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). Turbidity of thioredoxin-polyglutamine fusion protein containing nonpathologic glutamine repeats (19 or 35 glutamines) at concentrations ranging up to 50 μm did not change after 3 weeks at 4 °C. We next examined the effect of these combinatorially generated polyglutamine binding peptides on polyglutamine aggregation in vitro. We synthesized the 11-mer peptide with the greatest differential binding to pathologic-length compared with normal length polyglutamine (Q62/Q19) (QBP1; Table I). We chose this peptide because it displays the greatest selective binding to expanded polyglutamine domain proteins and therefore might preferentially block pathologic protein interactions. The 11-mer peptide QBP1 potently inhibited aggregation of thioredoxin-polyglutamine protein with 62 glutamines (thio-Q62) in vitro (Fig.2). QBP1 completely inhibited thio-Q62 aggregation at a molar ratio of 3:1 (thio-Q62: QBP1) (Fig. 2). QBP1 was less potent at inhibiting aggregation of thio-Q81 and required a 10-fold molar excess (1:10, thio-Q81:QBP1) for complete inhibition (not shown). A scrambled sequence peptide of QBP1 (SCR; Table I) and a computer-generated random 11-amino acid peptide (RAN; Table I) did not inhibit aggregation (Fig. 2). The addition of QBP1 after aggregation did not reverse aggregation of thio-Q62 (not shown). QBP1, SCR, and RAN peptides had no effect on the turbidity of the nonpathologic thioredoxin-polyglutamine proteins with 19 or 35 glutamines (thio-Q19 or thio-Q35; thio-Q19 not shown). We next determined whether QBP1 also inhibits polyglutamine aggregation in transfected COS-7 cells. As we previously demonstrated, COS-7 cells expressing polyglutamine domain fusion proteins are a good cellular model of the polyglutamine repeat diseases because the polyglutamine-fusion proteins mimic the native disease proteins by forming aggregates and by killing cells in a polyglutamine length-dependent pattern (7.Onodera O. Burke J.R. Miller S.E. Hester S. Tsuji S. Roses A.D. Strittmatter W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To determine the intracellular distribution of both polyglutamine and QBP1, we designed fusion proteins of polyglutamine with yellow fluorescent protein (Qn-YFP, where n = 19, 45, 57, or 81 glutamines) and fused QBP1 with cyan fluorescent protein (QBP1-CFP) (Fig. 3 A). YFP and CFP are variants of green fluorescent protein with distinct emission spectra, which enable separate detection of each fluorescent protein in double labeled cells (27.Ellenberg J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Presley J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 52-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). QBP1 fused to cyan fluorescent protein (QBP1-CFP) expressed in COS-7 cells remained diffusely distributed (not shown). A polyglutamine-yellow fluorescent fusion protein with 19 glutamines (Q19-YFP) was also diffusely distributed, and its distribution was unaffected by co-expression with QBP1-CFP (Fig.3 B, a and b). Expression of a pathologic-length polyglutamine-YFP fusion protein with 81 glutamines (Q81-YFP) in transfected cells formed aggregate. Co-expression of Q81-YFP and QBP1-CFP produced co-localization of these two fluorescent proteins in the protein aggregates (Fig. 3 B, c and d). In contrast, random peptide or scrambled peptide fused to CFP (RAN-CFP and SCR-CFP) did not co-localize with the aggregate formed by Q81-YFP (Fig. 3 B, e–h). We next examined the effect of QBP1-CFP expression on Qn-YFP aggregate formation in co-transfected COS-7 cells. Diffuse fluorescence was easily distinguishable from aggregate using the fluorescence microscope (compare diffuse fluorescence of polyglutamine in Fig.3 B, a, with punctate fluorescence of aggregated protein in Fig. 3 B, c, e, andg). Co-expression of QBP1-CFP reduced the percentage of cells with polyglutamine aggregates (Fig.4). Inhibition of polyglutamine aggregation by QBP1-CFP was most pronounced with shorter pathologic-length glutamine fusion proteins (45 glutamines (Q45) > 57 glutamines (Q57) > 81 glutamines (Q81)). Compared with cells co-expressing RAN-CFP, QBP1-CFP reduced aggregation of Q45-YFP by 39% (Fig. 4; p < 0.01). QBP1 also reduced aggregation of Q57-YFP by 26% (p < 0.01). A trend toward decreasing aggregation was seen in cells transfected with QBP1 and Q81-YFP, but the difference did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.073). The decline in QBP1-CFP's ability to inhibit aggregation of proteins with increasingly long polyglutamine domains in cells is consistent with our in vitro data showing that QBP1 is less effective at inhibiting aggregation of thio-Q81 compared with thio-Q62. To determine if duplication of the sequence of QBP1 would affect its ability to inhibit polyglutamine aggregation, we prepared a tandem repeat of QBP1 fused to CFP. (QBP1)2-CFP is more effective at inhibiting all lengths of polyglutamine-YFP aggregation than monomer QBP1-CFP (Fig. 4, dotted bars). SCR-CFP did not alter aggregation of cells expressing polyglutamine-CFP with 45, 57, or 81 glutamines (Q45-, Q57-, or Q81-YFP) (Fig. 4, hatched bars). The relationship between polyglutamine protein aggregation and cell death is controversial. To determine whether QBP1 or tandem-QBP1 inhibit polyglutamine-induced cell death, we assayed cell membrane permeability to ethidium homodimer. The membranes of living cells are impermeable to ethidium homodimer, and permeability to ethidium homodimer is a well established measure of cell death (28.Pike C.J. Overman M.J. Cotman C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23895-23898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 29.Levesque A. Paquet A. Page M. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 178: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Ethidium homodimer undergoes a 30-fold increase in fluorescence upon binding to nucleic acid, allowing easy detection with a fluorescence microscope using a rhodamine filter. QBP1 and (QBP1)2 fused to CFP inhibit Q57-YFP-induced cell death (Fig.5). As with inhibition of aggregation, (QBP1)2 is more effective at inhibiting cell death than monomer QBP1. Similar results have also been observed with Q45- and Q81-YFP (not shown). Scrambled QBP1 fused to CFP (SCR) does not inhibit cell death (Fig. 5). No therapies modify the age-of-onset of symptoms or pathologic progression of the polyglutamine repeat diseases. In this paper, we identified a novel peptide that is a therapeutic prototype because it preferentially binds pathologic-length polyglutamine domains, inhibits polyglutamine aggregation both in vitro and in cultured cells, and reduces cell death. In addition, we described an in vitro, high throughput, polyglutamine aggregation assay that can be used to identify small molecules that inhibit aggregation. The combinatorially generated peptides identified by phage display screening that preferentially bind pathologic-length polyglutamine domains (QBP1–6) have a conserved motif; the peptides are tryptophan-rich (5 of 6) and most include a cluster of 3 tryptophans, including a pair of adjacent tryptophans. Peptides containing tandem tryptophans also contain an adjacent basic (positively charged) amino acid. QBP1 has no homology with other proteins that bind polyglutamine domain proteins, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, neurofilament, vimentin, Huntington-associated protein 1, SH3-GL3, or WW domain proteins (4.Li X.J.

Inhibition of in vitro and intracellular polyglutamine protein aggregation by QBP1 is sequence-specific, since a scrambled version of the QBP1 peptide had no effect on aggregation. Binding to proteins with expanded-length polyglutamine domains or inhibition of polyglutamine aggregation by QBP1 is robust and is observed whether the peptide is free or fused to the M13 pIII protein or to CFP. QBP1 binds to polyglutamine whether the polyglutamine domain is fused to GST, thioredoxin, or YFP, suggesting that polyglutamine-binding peptides would interact with the expanded polyglutamine domain in disease proteins, such as huntingtin. Our data further demonstrate that QBP1 inhibits polyglutamine-induced cell death. QBP1-CFP expression inhibited Q57-YFP-induced cell death by 19%, and tandem QBP1 inhibited cell death by 50%. Despite the almost universal presence of polyglutamine aggregates in the polyglutamine repeat diseases, the role of aggregation itself in pathogenesis is controversial. Polyglutamine protein aggregates may cause neurodegeneration or form as a response to cell injury. Igarashiet al. (32.Igarashi S. Koide R. Shimohata T. Yamada M. Hayashi Y. Takano H. Date H. Oyake M. Sato T. Sato A. Egawa S. Ikeuchi T. Tanaka H. Nakano R. Tanaka K. Hozumi I. Inuzuka T. Takahashi H. Tsuji S. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar) demonstrated that inhibition of aggregation by transglutaminase inhibitors partially blocked apoptotic cell death. Similarly, Chai et al. (33.Chai Y.H. Koppenhafer S.L. Bonini N.M. Paulson H.L. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10338-10347Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that overexpression of chaperone protein HDJ-1 in PC12 cells inhibited polyglutamine protein aggregation and toxicity. In contrast, others have found that aggregation and cell death are separate phenomena (34.Warrick J.M. Chan H.Y.E. Gray-Board G.L. Chai Y.H. Paulson H.L. Bonini N.M. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). Klementet al. (35.Klement I.A. Skinner P.J. Kaytor M.D. Yi H. Hersch S.M. Clark H.B. Zoghbi H.Y. Orr H.T. Cell. 1998; 95: 41-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar) found that deletion of the self-association of ataxin 1 blocked aggregation but not cell death. Similarly, Saudouet al. showed that cell death induced by mutant huntingtin was not directly correlated with intranuclear aggregate formation (36.Saudou F. Finkbeiner S. Devys D. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1998; 95: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1360) Google Scholar). Whatever the function of aggregates, interaction of pathologic-length polyglutamine proteins with themselves or other proteins may disrupt critical cellular processes and destroy homeostasis. In our experiments, decreased aggregation parallels the decline in toxicity, but this does not prove that decreased toxicity is mediated by decreased aggregation. QBP1 may be exerting its effect by inhibiting interactions of polyglutamine proteins with other molecules, and the decrease in aggregation may be an epiphenomenon. A limiting factor to identifying new therapeutic agents for these diseases is the lack of a high throughput screening assay. Aggregation of polyglutamine proteins in vitro has been previously described, but these assays either require proteolytic cleavage of polyglutamine fusion proteins or employ detection systems (such as dynamic light scattering) not readily adaptable for rapid screening (23.Scherzinger E. Sittler A. Schweiger K. Heiser V. Lurz R. Hasenbank R. Bates G.P. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In this paper, we describe a new, simple, in vitroassay of polyglutamine aggregation that facilitates the identification of compounds that inhibit aggregation. Aggregation of thio-Qnprotein in vitro faithfully recapitulates the behavior of polyglutamine proteins in human disease. As shown here, thio-Qnaggregation occurs in vitro only with repeats longer than 35; in Huntington's disease, the most common polyglutamine repeat disease, individuals develop disease only if they express a huntingtin protein with more than 36 sequential glutamines (38.Rubinsztein D.C. Leggo J. Coles R. Almqvist E. Biancalana V. Cassiman J.J. Chotai K. Connarty M. Crauford D. Curtis A. Curtis D. Davidson M.J. Differ A.M. Dode C. Dodge A. Frontali M. Ranen N.G. Stine O.C. Sherr M. Abbott M.H. Franz M.L. Graham C.A. Harper P.S. Hedreen J.C. Hayden M.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 59: 16-22PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro, thio-Qn protein with longer pathologic-length polyglutamine domains aggregates more rapidly and at lower concentration than with shorter pathologic-length glutamine domains; similarly, in Huntington's disease, polyglutamine domain length directly correlates with earlier age of onset, severity of clinical phenotype, and aggregate formation (39.Martindale D.

Genet. 1998; 18: 150-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The ability to identify compounds that selectively alter intracellular interactions and metabolism of pathologic-length polyglutamine domain proteins may be an effective therapeutic strategy in these diseases.

This was achieved by addressing residue 48 as a selectivity determining residue. By introducing a basic nitrogen in the core structure of the inhibitor, a salt bridge was formed to Asp-48 in PTP1B. In contrast, the basic nitrogen causes repulsion in other PTPs containing an asparagine in the equivalent position resulting in a remarkable selectivity for PTP1B.

The lack of PTP1B resulted both in increased insulin sensitivity and obesity resistance (13.Elchebly M. Payette P. Michaliszyn E. Cromlish W. Collins S. Loy A.L. Normandin D. Cheng A. Himms-Hagen J.

Thus, PTP1B might be an attractive therapeutic target in type 2 diabetes and obesity. A number of structural and enzyme kinetic studies on PTP1B have given unique insight into the structural requirements for substrate and inhibitor recognition and thus makes this enzyme an ideal target for structure based inhibitor design (14.Jia Z.C.

Biol. 1998; 2: 633-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). In addition, OBA shows a novel binding pattern, interacting with other residues surrounding the active site, which are not directly involved in substrate binding. Because of the unique potency of OBA, its low molecular weight and its enzyme kinetic behavior as classical, time-independent competitive inhibitor, this compound was used as a starting point for structure-based lead optimization with the aim of making potent and selective PTP1B inhibitors. cDNAs encoding the catalytic domains of PTP1B (23.Chernoff J.

The PTP-LAR expression vector was a kind gift from M. Streuli, Boston. The following PTP mutants were made by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction using appropriate restriction sites for cloning purposes (27.Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2614) Google Scholar):PTP1B to PTPα: (i) R47V, D48N; (ii) R47V; and (iii) D48N. PTPα to PTP1B (PTP1B numbering): (iv) V47R, N48D, L50S; (v) V47R; (vi) N48D. All constructs were inserted into pGEX expression vectors (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In addition, for x-ray protein crystallography the cDNA encoding the first 321 amino acids of PTP1B and the PTP1B (R47V,D48N) mutant were inserted in the pET11a expression vector. All coding sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) were transformed with the pET11a expression plasmids. An overnight culture was diluted 1:160 into a total volume of 2 liters of SOB medium (2% (w/v) Bacto-tryptone, 0.5% (w/v) Bacto-yeast extract, 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm MgSO4) and grown at 37 °C untilA 600 was 0.6. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and the incubation was continued at room temperature for 3 h. PTP1B and the PTP1B (R47V, D48N) mutant were purified essentially as described previously (28.Hoppe E. Berne P.F. Stock D. Rasmussen J.S. Moller N.P.H. Ullrich A. Huber R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 223: 1069-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Similar procedures were used for expression of the glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, with the exception that the overnight cultures were diluted 1:25 and grown for 3 h at 37 °C before the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins were purified according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The enzyme reactions were carried out using standard conditions essentially as described by Burke et al. (15.Burke T.R. Ye B. Yan X.J. Wang S.M. Jia Z.C. Chen L. Zhang Z.Y. Barford D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15989-15996Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The assay conditions were as follows. Appropriately diluted inhibitors (3 or 4 different concentrations: diluted 1-, 3-, 9-, and 27-fold, respectively) were added to the reaction mixtures containing 7 different concentrations of the substrate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate (usual range: 0.31–20 mm, final assay concentration). The buffers used were (total volume 100 μl): (a) 100 mm sodium acetate pH 5.5, 50 mm sodium chloride, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 5 mm glutathione, and 1 mm EDTA; (b) 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 100 mmsodium chloride, 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 5 mmglutathione, and 1 mm EDTA. The reaction was started by the addition of the enzyme and carried out in microtiter plates at 25 °C for 60 min. The reactions were stopped by the addition of NaOH. The enzyme activity was determined by measurement of the absorbance at 405 nm with appropriate corrections for absorbance of the compounds andp-nitrophenyl phosphate. The data were analyzed using nonlinear regression hyperbolic fit to classical Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetic models. Inhibition is expressed as K ivalues in μm. For each compound the inhibitor constant was given as a mean of the K i values calculated for the different inhibitor concentrations. Only K ivalues, which are in the range of 1/10 and 2 times the corresponding inhibitor concentration, are used for the calculation of the mean value. Experiments are repeated if all K i values are outside the range or if the correlation coefficient R2 of the hyperbolic fit is less than 0.98. Representative experiments are presented. The assay variability was monitored by measurement of theK m values. In 332 independent assays (representing a period of 2 years) the K m value for PTP1B with pNPP was found to be 0.75 ± 0.16 mm (mean ± S.D.) at pH 5.5. An approximately 10 mg/ml PTP1B or PTP1B(R47V, D48N) protein solution in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 3 mmdithiothreitol, was used for crystallizations. Crystals were grown by the sitting as well as the hanging drop vapor diffusion methods. A 1:10 (PTP1B:inhibitor) molar ratio mixture was prepared at least 1 h prior to crystallization. Two μl of PTP1B-inhibitor solution was mixed with 2 μl of reservoir solution consisting of: 0.1m HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, 0.2–0.4 m sodium acetate or magnesium acetate, 12–16% polyethylene glycol 8000 and/or 4% glycerol. The reservoir volume was 1 ml. Crystals grew to the size of 0.3–0.6 × 0.1–0.3 × 0.1–0.3 mm over 2–3 days. For all data sets, one crystal was used and all diffraction data were collected at 100 K. The following cryo conditions were used: 3 μl of 50% glycerol (containing 0.5 mmol inhibitor) were added to the hanging or sitting drop. The crystal was removed from the drop after 5–30 min and transferred to 50% glycerol (containing 0.5 mmol of inhibitor) and rapidly flash frozen. Data were collected using a Mar345 image plate detector either at the MAX-lab synchrotron facilities at Lund University (Sweden) or in house on a rotating anode (RU300, CuKα 50 kV/80 mA) equipped with Osmic multilayer mirror system. Typically, a 1° oscillation/image was used for 60 images. Data sets in the resolution range 2.3–1.8 Å were obtained. The space group was determined to be P3121 for all crystals used. Data processing was performed using Denzo, Scalepack, and the CCP4 program suite (29.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods Enzymol.276.

As P3121 contains a polar axis and thus possesses more than one indexing possibility, a molecular replacement solution using Amore (30.Collaborative Computational Project, N. 4Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

A high resolution PTP1B structure was used as a starting model, with ligand and water molecules omitted from the structure. All refinements were performed with Xplor. v. 3.851 (Molecular Simulations Inc.). Interchanging cycles of model building using X-build (Molecular Simulations Inc.) and refinement were performed. The 2F o -F c maps were inspected by the use of X-ligand (Molecular Simulations Inc.) at a 1.3 ς level for densities that could correspond to the structures of the inhibitors. In all cases, electron density maps well suited for the inhibitors were identified in the active site pocket. No other densities were identified to fit the inhibitors. Water molecules were inserted using the X-solvate program (Molecular Simulations Inc.). The graphical interface used was Quanta (Molecular Simulations Inc.).

Base hydrolysis of the ester groups gave after treatment with aqueous HCl the desired 2-(oxalylamino)-benzoic acid (Fig. 1, compound 1). Using the same procedure, 3-(oxalyl-amino)-thiophen-2-carboxylic acid (Fig. 1, compound 2) and 2-(oxalyl-amino)-thiophen-3-carboxylic acid (Fig. 1, compound 3) were prepared. The fused 2-amino-thiophenes (Fig. 1, compounds 4, 5, and6) were synthesized applying the same procedure as described for 1 using either 2-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-benzo[b]thiophen-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (Aldrich), 2-amino-4,7-dihydro-5H-thieno[2,3-c]pyridin-3-carboxylic acidtert-butyl ester, or 2-amino-4,7-dihydro-5H-thieno[2,3-c]pyran-3-carboxylic acid ethyl ester as starting material prepared via the Gewald 2-amino-thiophene synthesis (32.Gewald K.

The tert-butyl esters were cleaved using 25% trifluoroacetic acid in dichloromentane. Further details regarding synthesis and structure-activity relationship of this family of compounds will be published elsewhere. To identify unique residues or combinations of residues of PTP1B that could be utilized as points of interaction by selective inhibitors, we first aligned the primary sequences of the catalytic domains of 106 known vertebrate PTPs. 2J. N. Andersen, O. H. Mortensen, G. H. Peters, P. G. Drake, N. K. Tonks, and N. P. H. Møller, manuscript in preparation. Using the crystal structure of PTP1B (33.Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1994; 263: 1397-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar), we next identified unique combinations of residues in the active site pocket or in its vicinity, i.e.at a distance that would allow simultaneous binding to the active site and these residues, while still retaining a low molecular weight. In particular, a combination of four residues seems to be unique for the PTP1B family: Arg-47, Asp-48, Met-258, and Gly-259. Arg-47 and Asp-48 contribute significantly to the binding of peptide substrates in PTP1B (14.Jia Z.C. Barford D. Flint A.J. Tonks N.K. Science. 1995; 268: 1754-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). A comparison of these regions in representative members of 14 PTP families is shown in Table II. Residue 48 seems a particularly attractive binding element for selective PTP1B ligands because this is an Asp in PTP1B and an Asn in many other PTPs. Asp-48 is well defined, as judged by B-factors in the published PTP1B structures (16.Puius Y.A. Zhao Y. Sullivan M. Lawrence D.S. Almo S.C. Zhang Z.-Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In the course of analyzing this system, we have recently shown that the phenyl ring of OBA can be substituted by thiophene, resulting in compounds that are readily synthesized with little difference in potency between 3-(oxalyl-amino)-thiophene-2-carboxylic acid (Fig. 1, compound2) and 2-(oxalyl-amino)-thiophene-3-carboxylic acid (Fig. 1, compound 3) (Table III, (20.Andersen H.S.

Ye B. Yan X.J. Wang S.M. Jia Z.C. Chen L. Zhang Z.Y. Barford D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 15989-15996Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The enhanced potency of the naphthalene ring system is because of extensive hydrophobic interactions with the side chains of Tyr-46, Phe-182, Ala-217, and Ile-219. The hydrophobic role of the second aromatic ring might also be served by a saturated ring, which would allow the regioselective introduction of small substituents in this saturated ring to promote additional interactions with the side chains or backbone of these two residues. Consequently, compound 4 was synthesized and shown to be about 8-fold more potent against PTP1B than compounds 2 and3 and 3-fold more potent than OBA when tested at pH 5.5 (the pH optimum for PTP1B using pNPP as substrate)(Table III). Importantly, the inhibitory profile against this set of PTPs is almost the same as that of the naphthalene derivative of OBA (not shown). Thus, although compound 4 retains the features of a general PTP inhibitor, it shows some selectivity for PTP1B. As indicated above, the combination of Arg-47 and Asp-48 offers a rather unique, selective ligand binding region in PTP1B. The side chains of both residues are charged at neutral pH and could therefore be utilized for salt bridge formation. We decided to address Asp-48 for optimization purposes for the following reasons. First, because OBA and its derivatives already contain two negatively charged carboxy groups, we did not want to introduce additional negative charges. Second, the arginine side chain (Arg-47) has high B-factors in the known x-ray structures of PTP1B, indicating substantial flexibility. Thus, energy penalties could be expected when constraining the arginine side chain for ligand binding. Third, and probably most importantly, residue 48 offers a unique possibility for obtaining selectivity because many PTPs contain an uncharged asparagine at this position. By introducing a positive charge in compound 4 at the appropriate position, we expected the formation of a salt bridge with Asp-48, and in addition because of repulsive forces between the positive ligand charge and the asparagine side chain found in many other PTPs, a decrease in affinity for these PTPs (see below). Three side chain rotamer conformations are normally defined for an Asp residue (rotamer 1, 47.7%; rotamer 2, 33.6%; and rotamer 3, 15.9%, percentages according to Quanta rotamer library (Molecular Simulations Inc.). In the published x-ray structures of PTP1B, two rotamers for Asp-48 have been described, rotamer 1 and 3. The rotamer 3 conformation is stabilized by an internal hydrogen bond between the side chain of Asp-48 and the main chain amide with the side chain bending toward the active site pocket (as examples, see Figs. 4 B,5 A, and 6 below). This rotamer seems to be the preferred one for Asp-48. The rotamer 1 conformation has only been found in four of the 11 published x-ray structures, and in three of these cases the rotamer 1 position is required because of ligand occupancy forcing the side chain of Asp-48 to point away from the active site pocket. We have recently co-crystallized PTP1B with OBA, as well as three derivatives, and found Asp-48 also in the rotamer 3 position in all structures (20.Andersen H.S. Iversen L.F. Jeppesen C.B. Branner S. Norris K. Møller K.B. Møller N.P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275 (in press)Google Scholar). Based on these observations, it seemed likely that introduction of a basic nitrogen in the saturated ring in compound 4 would be sufficiently close to Asp-48 to allow the formation of a salt bridge and thus increase the affinity. A recent survey of 322 unrelated proteins has shown that Asp and Asn residues have a strong tendency to form hydrogen bonds with neighboring backbone amides and in both cases with a significant preference for internal hydrogen bonds (35.Vijayakumar M. Qian H. Zhou H. Proteins. 1999; 34: 497-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Assuming that the equivalent Asn-48 of other PTPs forms an internal hydrogen bond similar to that observed for Asp-48 in PTP1B, the side chain amide of the asparagine with its positive dipole would be in an unfavorable position relative to the proposed basic nitrogen and thus cause repulsion. Importantly, such internal hydrogen bonds can be demonstrated for Asn-48 (PTP1B numbering) in the published x-ray structures of PTPα (36.Bilwes A.M. Den Hertog J. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Nature. 1996; 382: 555-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), PTPμ (37.Hoffmann K.M.V. Tonks N.K. Barford D. J. Biol.

Further, this compound showed remarkable selectivity for PTP1B versus all other PTPs tested. This is in agreement with the hypothesis that repulsive forces between the basic nitrogen in compound 5 and the positive dipole of the asparagine side chain decrease the potency against other PTPs. CD45, which also contains an aspartic acid in position 48, is a noticeable exception showing only a minor decrease in affinity. We speculate that the preferred rotamer of Asp-48 in CD45 might be rotamer 1, which is too far away for salt bridge formation with compound 5. In addition, CD45 contains a valine in position 47, which may not have the same influence on Asp-48 as an arginine. Further studies will be needed to clarify the role and positioning of Asp-48 in CD45 and other PTPs with an asparagine in this position. In particular, PTPH1, which has a positively charged lysine in position 47, should be included. We have previously found the interaction between PTPs and OBA (as well as its derivatives) to be pH-dependent. For some inhibitor/PTP combinations, the K i value can be about 10-fold lower at pH 5.5 (the pH optimum for PTP1B) than at pH 7.0 (20.Andersen H.S. Iversen L.F. Jeppesen C.B. Branner S. Norris K.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7152-7159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) receptors are less sensitive to ATP (EC50 around 10 μm) and desensitize at slow to moderate rate; 3) P2X7 receptors (13.Surprenant A. Rassendren F. Kawashima E. North R.A. Buell G. Science. 1996; 272: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1487) Google Scholar) show low sensitivity to ATP (EC50 around 500 μm) and desensitize slowly. Modulation of the desensitization rate of neurotransmitter-gated channels is recognized as a potentially important mechanism for modulation of neuronal excitability (14.Smart T.G. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 358-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). P2X receptors are nonselective cation channels with high permeability to calcium ions (15.Rogers M. Dani J.A. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 501-506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 16.Ueno S. Koizumi S. Inoue K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 1484-1490Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), so the subtype-specific desensitization phenotype of ATP-mediated currents has a significant impact on the levels of intracellular calcium and subsequent activation of calcium-dependent effectors. Studies on the relationship between the slowly desensitization kinetics of P2X2receptor and its primary sequence have emphasized the requirement for several structural features including the transmembrane domains and their intracellular flanking regions (17.Werner P. Sewakdi E.P. Buell G.N. North R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Physiol. 1999; 520: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Chow and Wang (22.Chow Y.-W. Wang H.-L. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2606-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have reported that P2X2 receptor kinetics can also be modulated by protein kinase A (PKA)1-dependent phosphorylation of Ser431 located in the C-terminal domain of the subunit. However, no structural motif distinctive of the P2X family has been linked to a specific functional property of these ionotropic ATP receptors so far.Using site-directed mutagenesis and electrophysiological characterization of recombinant P2X receptors in Xenopusoocytes, we report here the identification of a phosphothreonine part of the highly conserved protein kinase C site located intracellularly in the N terminus of P2X subunits as a critical determinant for the expression of slowly desensitizing P2X2 ATP-gated channels.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONMembers of an unique class of ligand-gated channels by their protein topology, P2X ATP receptors are produced by the oligomeric assembly of two-transmembrane domain subunits with both their N and C termini located intracellularly (23.Torres G.E. Hegan T.M. Voigt M.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 425: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All known P2X ATP-gated channel subunits display a threonine residue that is part of the highly conserved protein kinase C consensus site TX(K/R) in the intracellular N-terminal domain of the protein (Fig.1 A). To test the role of this conserved domain in the function of P2X2 ATP-gated channels, we first substituted Thr18 for Ala in the sequence of rat P2X2 subunit to eliminate this protein kinase C site. Following expression of this mutant P2X2T18A receptor in Xenopus oocytes, we observed a dramatic change of phenotype in response to application of extracellular ATP. In contrast with wild-type P2X2 receptors that do not desensitize significantly over the time of application of agonist, mutant P2X2T18A subunits assembled in functional ATP-gated channels that displayed fast kinetics with complete desensitization in less than 5 s (Fig. 1 B).Despite a short time of recovery (Fig.2 A), the rate of desensitization of P2X2T18A was faster than the rate of P2X1 receptors expressed in oocytes (Fig. 2 B). We measured a time constant (50% of maximal response) of 0.36 s ± 0.11 for P2X2T18A and 0.80 s ± 0.11 for P2X1 receptors. Increase of desensitization rate could be linked to structural alterations that increase the agonist sensitivity of the mutant channels. Independently of the agonist concentration, an alteration in the structure of the subunits could also create an unexpected change of voltage sensitivity leading to abnormal kinetics at specific membrane potentials. So we tested the possible roles of the agonist concentration and of the membrane potential by recording the activity of P2X2T18A channels at increasing concentrations of ATP (from 1 μm to 1 mm) and at different voltages (from 0 mV to −100 mV) without detecting any significant changes in the desensitization rate (Fig. 2 A). Confirming that an increase of sensitivity to agonist was not the mechanism causing the change, the EC50 of ATP for P2X2T18A was found to be 62 ± 2 μm, compared with an EC50 of 8.43 ± 1.4 μmfor wild-type P2X2 receptors (Fig. 2 C). For technical reasons, the EC50 measured for P2X2T18A could be slightly underestimated because of the fast kinetics of desensitization of these mutant receptors. However, in the range of agonist concentration tested (1 μm to 1 mm), we did not observe a change of phenotype at high concentrations of ATP in the case of wild-type P2X2receptors seven to eight times more sensitive than P2X2T18A mutant receptors.Figure 2Characterization of mutant P2X2T18A receptor desensitization and recovery. A, ATP-induced currents in oocytes expressing P2X2T18A fully recovered after repeated applications at 2-min intervals. The rate of desensitization did not change significantly with increasing concentration of ATP or with the membrane potential. B, comparison of the rate of desensitization of P2X2 (filled squares), P2X2T18A (open circles), and P2X1 (filled circles) receptors. P2X2T18A currents evoked by a 10-s application of 100 μm ATP had a time constant of desensitization <1 s similar to the currents recorded in oocytes expressing P2X1 receptor. C, activation dose response curves of P2X2 wild-type (filled squares) and P2X2T18A mutants (open squares) for ATP. Mean peak currents were normalized to the maximal response (means ± S.E. from 8–10 oocytes). Holding membrane potential = −60 mV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We decided to eliminate the protein kinase C site by replacing the conserved Thr18 by Asp instead of Ala to check whether the observed effects on the kinetics could be due to a structural change unrelated to the presence of a phosphorylation site. The mutant receptor P2X2T18N had the same quickly desensitizing kinetics than P2X2T18A (Fig.3). It could happen also that this threonine residue plays an unique structural role independently of being a phosphate acceptor, so we eliminated the protein kinase C site by substituting the positively charged Lys20 that is a second critical part of the kinase recognition site by PKC while preserving the conserved Thr18. The mutant receptor P2X2K20T displayed the same fast phenotype than P2X2T18A and P2X2T18N receptors (Fig. 3). To test the importance of the structural integrity of the protein kinase C motif TPK in P2X2 kinetics, we replaced Pro19by Ala. P2X2P19A receptors generated slowly desensitizing currents in response to ATP, similar to those observed with wild-type channels (Fig. 3). The results of these experiments suggest strongly that the presence of the protein kinase C recognition motif TXK is a critical determinant of the kinetics of wild-type P2X2receptors, without excluding the possibility that Thr18plays also a structural role.Figure 3Mutation of the conserved N-terminal PKC consensus site dramatically increased the rate of desensitization.Representative currents evoked by application of 100 μmof ATP to oocytes expressing wild-type and several PKC site mutant receptors. Current amplitudes recorded in oocytes expressing different PKC site mutants were decreased in comparison with wild-type receptors. The mean current amplitudes were 16 ± 2.8 μA for P2X2, 4.53 ± 1.4 μA for P2X2 T18A, 1.3 ± 0.4 μA for P2X2T18N, 11.2 ± 1.95 μA for P2X2K20T, and 8.7 ± 1.39 μA for P2X2P19A. All mutant receptors lacking the PKC consensus site TXK showed fast and complete desensitization.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Full-length rat P2X2 subunits have a large intracellular C-terminal domain that contains two other potential protein kinase C sites on Thr372 and Thr464 and one protein kinase A site on Ser431 (22.Chow Y.-W. Wang H.-L. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2606-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Shorter splicing variants of P2X2 subunits display different sets of these protein kinase sites, and several studies have shown that the structure of the C-terminal domain in these variants plays a modulatory role on the desensitization kinetics of P2X2 channels (19.Koshimizu T. Tomic M. Koshimizu M. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12853-12857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 20.Koshimizu T. Koshimizu M. Stojilkovic S.S. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1999; 520: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). To eliminate these additional potential phosphorylation sites, we produced truncated (TR) forms of wild-type and mutant P2X2 subunits lacking the native C-terminal sequence from His375 to the Stop codon and mutated also on Thr372 to eliminate the remaining proximal protein kinase C site. Larger deletions of the C-terminal domain resulted in silent receptors (data not shown), confirming the critical importance of intracellular domains in the function of ATP-gated channels. As illustrated in Fig.4, truncated P2X2 receptors with intact N-terminal domains displayed two different kinetics: a hybrid biphasic phenotype (29–75% of the oocytes, three frogs) with a quickly desensitizing component followed by a slowly desensitizing phase or a slowly desensitizing phenotype (Fig. 4). On the contrary, truncated P2X2 receptors lacking the conserved PKC site consistently displayed a quickly desensitizing phenotype very similar to the one observed with full-length P2X2T18A mutant receptors (Figs. 1 and 2). Variations of the truncated P2X2phenotype suggest strongly the effects of cell-specific intracellular mechanisms that would be consistent with previous reports of variability in the levels of basal protein kinase activity in oocytes (24.Paradiso K. Brehm P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 9227-9237Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional importance of the C-terminal domain is also demonstrated by the differences of current amplitudes recorded between the full-length and the truncated versions of P2X2T18A and P2X2K20T mutant channels. The small amplitudes of peak currents (less than 500 nA at 100 μm ATP) obtained with truncated P2X2T18A or K20T mutants (Fig. 4) indicates that a specific intracellular protein-protein interaction could underlie the efficient assembly and surface expression of ATP-gated channels.Figure 4Functional expression of P2X2 channels with truncated C-terminal domain. A, schematic diagrams showing the primary structure and location of mutations on full-length P2X2 and C-terminal truncated P2X2 channel subunits. PKC and PKA consensus sites are indicated by closed circles and open circles, respectively. Hatched boxes represent epitope tags. B, deletion of the C-terminal domain of P2X2 wild-type and mutants led to functional channels as shown here by representative currents evoked by 100 μm of ATP. The truncated P2X2 channels exhibited two phenotypes when expressed in oocytes. ATP responses were either slowly desensitizing (s) or had a biphasic phenotype (b) with a quickly desensitizing current followed by a sustained phase. The quickly desensitization phenotype of P2X2T18A and K20T mutants was not altered by the C-terminal deletion.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)If the variable phenotype observed with truncated P2X2receptors is linked to variable basal PKC activities in oocytes by stimulating pharmacologically the PKC with phorbol esters, we should be able to observe a double effect on the mutant phenotype: a decrease of the desensitization rate and less variability in the kinetics of ATP-induced currents. To test this hypothesis, we preincubated the oocytes expressing wild-type P2X2, truncated P2X2, or P2X2K20T (Fig.5) with the phorbol ester PMA or with its inactive enantiomer 4αPMA. As expected if Thr18 is a phosphate acceptor in a protein kinase C site, all hybrid currents generated by truncated P2X2 channels were converted into slowly desensitizing currents of the same peak amplitude in presence of PMA but not in a presence of the control phorbol ester 4αPMA. Slowly desensitizing wild-type P2X2 receptors or mutant P2X2K20T devoid of N-terminal PKC site were found insensitive to phorbol esters (Fig. 5) and to inhibitors of PKC (10–50 μm staurosporine and 10–100 μmchelerythine; data not shown). Both the low variability of wild-type P2X2 phenotype and the lack of sensitivity to PKC stimulation or inhibition would be consistent with the early constitutive phosphorylation of Thr18 by PKC in oocytes as well as in transfected mammalian cells (21.Smith F.M. Humphrey P.P.A. Murrell-Lagnado R.D. J. Physiol. 1999; 520: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 22.Chow Y.-W. Wang H.-L. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2606-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The fact that wild-type P2X2 receptors do not display such a variability in their phenotype in heterologous systems confirms that the C-terminal domain plays an important role in the stabilization of the slowly desensitization kinetics. In our hypothesis C terminus domain would promote phosphorylation of the subunit and/or protect phosphorylated subunits from phosphatase activity. Indeed, in absence of the C terminus domain, the expression of a stable slowly desensitizing phenotype required the exogenous stimulation of PKC, likely to fully phosphorylate the P2X2 subunits.Figure 5Activation of protein kinase C by phorbol ester converts the quickly desensitization kinetics of truncated P2X2 into a slowly desensitization phenotype. A, C, and E show the typical currents recorded in oocytes expressing P2X2TR (A), wild-type P2X2 (C), and P2X2 K20T (E) recorded during two successive applications of 100 μm ATP before and after a 5-min pretreatment with 1 μm PMA. B, negative control: P2X2TR was treated in the same way with the inactive phorbol ester 4αPMA. D shows the rate of desensitization (ratio of the maximal amplitude over the amplitude at 5 s after the peak, mean ± S.E.) measured during the first ATP application (control) and after treatment with phorbol esters PMA and 4αPMA. n = 6 for P2X2;n = 7–9 for P2X2TR. Asterisks,p < 0.001.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To directly assess the phosphorylation status of Thr18 in Western blot from oocytes and transfected HEK293 cells expressing P2X2 receptors, we used specific monoclonal antibodies directed against the phosphothreonine-proline motif that would be present only if the conserved PKC site of the receptor subunit is active. After affinity purification of FLAG epitope-tagged P2X2 receptors, we detected a strong positive signal corresponding to wild-type P2X2 receptors, but no signal was observed in the case of mutant P2X2K20T receptors lacking the N-terminal PKC site in oocytes (data not shown) as well as in transfected HEK293 cells (Fig.6 A). We controlled for similar levels of receptor expression in the same samples with anti-FLAG epitope antibodies (Fig. 6 B). We chose the P2X2K20T mutant as negative control in this experiment because in previous recordings we noticed robust currents related to its high level of expression (Fig. 3). The detection of a single phosphothreonine convincingly demonstrate that the conserved PKC site present in the N-terminal domain of P2X2 channel subunit is active and that the subunits are constitutively phosphorylated on Thr18 in oocytes and transfected HEK293 cells heterologous systems. The absence of Thr(P)-Pro-positive signal in the mutant P2X2K20T indicates also that the putative PKC site369KVRTPK374 present in the C-terminal domain of the subunit is not constitutively used.Figure 6The highly conserved Thr18 in the intracellular domain of P2X2 channel subunit is phosphorylated. Membrane proteins from HEK-293A cells transiently transfected with wild-type and mutant FLAG epitope-tagged P2X2 constructs were purified on an anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel then loaded on gel. A, immunoblotting with anti-Thr(P)-Pro monoclonal antibody revealed the presence of Thr(P)18 in wild-type subunits (2.Buell G. Collo G. Rassendren F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) but not in mutant P2X2K20T subunits lacking the corresponding protein kinase C site (1.North R.A. Barnard E.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). B, control of expression of wild-type and mutant P2X2 subunits in the same samples, visualized with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody after stripping. Molecular mass markers are indicated in kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We conclude from these converging data that Thr(P)18located in the N-terminal PKC site of the P2X2 subunit is a critical determinant for the characteristic slow rate of desensitization of homomeric P2X2 ATP-gated channels (Fig.7). This intracellular post-translational modification appears to be constitutive in oocytes as well as in transfected HEK293A cells heterologous expression systems. The absence of Thr(P)18 in mutants devoid of the conserved PKC site consistently produces ATP receptors with fast kinetics of desensitization, suggesting that the expression of receptors with a slow rate of desensitization requires specific interactions between the intracellular phosphorylated domain and other channel region(s). Despite its modulatory role, a full-length C-terminal domain is not necessary for the expression of P2X2 slowly desensitizing currents. This domain seems, however, to play a stabilizing role on the phosphothreonine-dependent slow phenotype through an unidentified intracellular mechanism.Figure 7Schematic model of the impact of P2X2 receptor subunit phosphorylation on desensitization kinetics. a represents the slowly desensitizing wild-type P2X2 phosphorylated (filled circle) on the N-terminal Thr18. b, receptors truncated in their C-terminal domains (P2X2TR) exhibit quickly desensitization kinetics when the subunits are not phosphorylated by protein kinase C on Thr18 (open circle).c, complete phosphorylation of Thr18(filled circle) by phorbol esters-induced activation of protein kinase C converts the receptors from fast to slowly desensitizing. Protein kinase C site mutants (PKC), either full-length (d) or truncated (e), display a quickly desensitizing phenotype that is insensitive to phorbol esters.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)PKA and PKC seem to have opposite effects on the response of P2X2 receptors to ATP: Ser431 phosphorylation by PKA inhibits P2X2 currents by increasing the rate of desensitization of the channels (22.Chow Y.-W. Wang H.-L. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2606-2612Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), whereas Thr18phosphorylation by PKC favors a prolonged response by decreasing their rate of desensitization. PKC phosphorylation has previously been reported to increase neuronal excitability through the modulation of transmitter-gated channels activity, for example indirectly by inhibiting γ-aminobutyric acid-gated chloride channels (25.Kellenberger S. Malherbe P. Sigel E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25660-25663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Krishek B.J. Xie X. Blackstone C.D. Huganir R.L. Moss S.J. Smart T.G.

Nature. 1992; 356: 521-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). In a subpopulation of rodent small diameter primary sensory neurons, P2X2 subunits co-assemble with P2X3 subunits to produce a hybrid heteromeric ATP-gated channel endowed with the slowly desensitization kinetics of homomeric P2X2 receptors and the high sensitivity to ATP and αβ-methylene ATP of homomeric P2X3 receptors (5.Lewis C. Neidhart S. Holy C. North R.A. Buell G. Surprenant A. Nature. 1995; 377: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 28.Bean B.P. William C.A. Cellen P.W. J. Neurosci. 1990; 10: 11-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Application of ATP on peripheral sensory terminals induces pain in mammals (29.Burnstock G. Lancet. 1996; 347: 1604-1605Abstract PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), but the exact role of P2X receptors in sensory pathways is not fully understood. The presence of an active and critical PKC site on P2X2 subunits suggests that the desensitization kinetics of native sensory P2X currents could be subject to second messenger-mediated regulation. By increasing the levels of PKC activity, inflammatory metabotropic peptide (i.e. bradykinin and substance P), monoamine (i.e. serotonin and histamine) or eicosanoids receptors coupled to phospholipase C activation would sensitize the sensory neurons to extracellular ATP via the decrease of the desensitization rate of calcium-permeable P2X channels. The N-terminal PKC site TX(K/R) is conserved in all known P2X subunits, but whether all P2X subunits assembled in ATP receptors with slowly desensitizing or quickly desensitizing phenotypes are constitutively phosphorylated and subject to PKC-dependent heterologous functional regulation remains to be investigated. Fast ionotropic responses to extracellular ATP are mediated by the activation of ATP-gated channels or P2X receptors present on the surface of various cell types. A family of genes coding for seven P2X channel subunits has been identified in human and rodents (1.North R.A. Barnard E.A. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 346-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 2.Buell G. Collo G. Rassendren F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1996; 8: 2221-2228Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar).

We hypothesized that secretory phospholipase A2(sPLA2), an acute phase protein that has been found in association with HDL, promotes HDL catabolism. A series of HDL metabolic studies were performed in transgenic mice that specifically overexpress human sPLA2 but have no evidence of local or systemic inflammation. We found that HDL isolated from these mice have a significantly lower phospholipid and cholesteryl ester and significantly greater triglyceride content. The fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of 125I-HDL was significantly faster in sPLA2 transgenic mice (4.08 ± 0.01 pools/day) compared with control wild-type littermates (2.16 ± 0.48 pools/day). 125I-HDL isolated from sPLA2transgenic mice was catabolized significantly faster than131I-HDL isolated from wild-type mice after injection in wild-type mice (p < 0.001). Injection of125I-tyramine-cellobiose-HDL demonstrated significantly greater degradation of HDL apolipoproteins in the kidneys of sPLA2 transgenic mice compared with control mice (p < 0.05). The fractional catabolic rate of [3H]cholesteryl ether HDL was significantly faster in sPLA2-overexpressing mice (6.48 ± 0.24 pools/day) compared with controls (4.80 ± 0.72 pools/day). Uptake of [3H] cholesteryl ether into the livers and adrenals of sPLA2 transgenic mice was significantly enhanced compared with control mice. In summary, these data demonstrate that overexpression of sPLA2 alone in the absence of inflammation causes profound alterations of HDL metabolism in vivo and are consistent with the hypothesis that sPLA2 may promote HDL catabolism in acute and chronic inflammatory conditions.

Injection of125I-tyramine-cellobiose-HDL demonstrated significantly greater degradation of HDL apolipoproteins in the kidneys of sPLA2 transgenic mice compared with control mice (p < 0.05). The fractional catabolic rate of [3H]cholesteryl ether HDL was significantly faster in sPLA2-overexpressing mice (6.48 ± 0.24 pools/day) compared with controls (4.80 ± 0.72 pools/day). Uptake of [3H] cholesteryl ether into the livers and adrenals of sPLA2 transgenic mice was significantly enhanced compared with control mice. In summary, these data demonstrate that overexpression of sPLA2 alone in the absence of inflammation causes profound alterations of HDL metabolism in vivo and are consistent with the hypothesis that sPLA2 may promote HDL catabolism in acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. high density lipoprotein fast protein liquid chromatography secretory phospholipase A2 apolipoprotein phosphate-buffered saline fractional catabolic rate serum amyloid A tyramine-cellobiose Plasma concentrations of high density lipoprotein (HDL)1 cholesterol and its major apoprotein apoA-I are inversely associated with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (1.Gordon D.J.

The factors responsible for the substantial variation in HDL cholesterol and apoA-I levels in humans remain incompletely understood. Metabolic studies of HDL and apoA-I in humans have established that variation in their levels is due in substantial part to variation in the rate of apoA-I catabolism (3.Schaefer E.J. Zech L.A.

Lancet. 1993; 342: 1455-1458Abstract PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although the determinants of apoA-I catabolism have not been fully elucidated, the size and lipid composition of HDL have been recognized to substantially influence the catabolic rate of apoA-I (8.Breslow J.L. Eisenberg S. Brinton E.A. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 676: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 9.Rader D.J. Ikewaki K. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1996; 7: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). One clinical setting that is invariably associated with reduced HDL cholesterol and apoA-I levels is systemic inflammation. Acute inflammatory states such as sepsis are associated with profoundly reduced HDL cholesterol levels (10.Bausserman L. Vernier D. McAdam K. Herbert P. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 18: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, chronic inflammatory states such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus are also associated with reduced levels of HDL cholesterol (11.Rossner S. Atherosclerosis. 1978; 31: 93-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 12.Lakatos J. Harsagyi A. Clin.

Cardiol. 1982; 49: 478-484Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). One of the major factors thought to be implicated in the reduced levels of HDL cholesterol during inflammation is the serum amyloid A (SAA) protein, which increases markedly during acute infection and inflammation and is also elevated in chronic inflammatory states (10.Bausserman L. Vernier D. McAdam K. Herbert P. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 18: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21.Malle E. Steinmetz A. Raynes J.G.

Acta. 1997; 1339: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). However, expression of SAA has never been directly demonstrated to alter HDL metabolism in vivo in the absence of systemic inflammation. We recently demonstrated that marked overexpression of human SAA alone in the absence of a generalized acute phase response had no effect on HDL cholesterol and apoA-I levels in human apoA-I transgenic mice (23.Hosoai H. Webb N.R. Glick J.M. Tietge U.J.F. Purdom M.S. deBeer F.C. Rader D.J. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 648-653Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This observation raised the question as to whether other factors associated with systemic inflammation may modulate HDL metabolism. Group IIA secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) is an acute phase protein and plasma levels of sPLA2 are increased in the setting of both acute and chronic inflammation (24.Nevalainen T. Clin. Chem. 1993; 39: 228-238Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar,25.Lin M.K. Farewell V. Vadas P. Bookman A.A. Keystone E.C. Pruzanski W. J. Rheumatol. 1996; 23: 1162-1166PubMed Google Scholar). A variety of circumstantial evidence suggests that hydrolysis of HDL phospholipids by sPLA2 could play a role in modulating HDL metabolism and function. Snake venom sPLA2 hydrolyzes HDL phospholipids, alters HDL size and density, and results in increased HDL uptake by rat hepatocytes in vitro (26.Collet X. Perret B.P. Simard G. Vieu C. Douste-Blazy L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1043: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Snake bites are associated with reduction in HDL cholesterol levels in proportion to the severity of the snake bite (27.Winkler E. Chovers M. Almog S. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1993; 121: 774-778PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of the acute phase response in mice was shown to cause a significant decrease in the phospholipid content of HDL (28.Hoffman J. Benditt E. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10510-10517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasma from patients with sepsis contains large amounts of sPLA2 that is found almost entirely in association with HDL (29.Gijon M.A. Perez C. Mendez E. Crespo M.S. Biochem. J. 1995; 306: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that sPLA2 expression induced during inflammation has a physiologic effect in modulating HDL metabolism. In this study we utilized group II sPLA2transgenic mice to demonstrate that specific overexpression of sPLA2 in the absence of generalized inflammation markedly increased the rate of catabolism and altered sites of tissue uptake of both HDL cholesteryl ester and apoA-I. The generation of human group IIA sPLA2transgenic mice has been described previously (30.Grass D.S. Felkner R.H. Chiang M.Y. Wallace R.E. Nevalainen T.J. Bennett C.F. Swanson M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2233-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 31.Nevalainen T.J. Laine V.J.O. Grass D.S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1109-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These mice have elevated plasma levels of sPLA2 comparable to those seen in the acute phase response, but do not have any evidence of local or systemic inflammation (30.Grass D.S. Felkner R.H. Chiang M.Y. Wallace R.E. Nevalainen T.J. Bennett C.F. Swanson M.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2233-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 31.Nevalainen T.J. Laine V.J.O. Grass D.S. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1109-1119Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The sPLA2 transgenic line has been backcrossed to the C57BL/6 background for 6 backcrosses. For the studies described, non-transgenic littermates from further breeding of these sPLA2 transgenic mice with C57BL/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) were used as controls. The animals were caged in animal rooms with alternating 12-h periods of light (7 a.m. to 7 p.m.) and dark (7 p.m. to 7 a.m.) with ad libitum access to water and mouse chow diet. Mice transgenic for sPLA2 were identified by Western blot analysis. One μl of mouse plasma was electrophoresed under nonreducing conditions on a 15% polyacrylamide gel (UltraPure, Life Technologies, Inc.) and subsequently electroblotted to nitrocellulose (Protran, 0.45 μm, Schleicher & Schuell). Human group IIA sPLA2 was identified by blotting with a monoclonal mouse anti-human primary antibody at a concentration of 2 μg/ml (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and visualized with a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA ) using the ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Mice were bled from the retroorbital plexus after a 4 h fast using heparinized capillary tubes. Blood was drawn into tubes containing 2 mmEDTA, 0.2% NaN3, and 1 mm benzamidine. Aliquots of plasma were stored at −20 °C until analysis. All analyses were performed within 10 days of obtaining blood. Plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides, phospholipids, and HDL cholesterol levels were measured enzymatically on a Cobas Fara (Roche Diagnostics Systems Inc., Nutley, NJ) using Sigma Diagnostics reagents (Sigma Diagnostics). Pooled plasma samples from 4 mice (120 μl total volume) were subjected to fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) gel filtration using two Superose 6 columns (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Uppsala, Sweden) as described (32.Tsukamoto K. Smith P. Glick J.M. Rader D.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Samples were chromatographed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and lipoprotein fractions of 500 μl each were collected. Individual fractions were assayed for cholesterol concentrations using commercially available assay kits (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan). For the analysis of HDL composition, HDL was isolated from 100 μl of mouse plasma by tabletop sequential ultracentrifugation (1.063 <d < 1.21) (33.Brousseau T. Clavey V. Bard J.M. Fruchart J.C. Clin. Chem. 1993; 39: 960-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). After dialysis, concentrations of total and free cholesterol, triglycerides, and phospholipids were determined with commercially available assays modified for microtiter plates (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.). HDL3 was isolated from human donors by sequential ultracentrifugation (density: 1.125 < d <1.21). After dialysis against three changes of PBS with 0.01% EDTA, the isolated HDL3 fraction was passed two times over a heparin-Sepharose column (Heparin Sepharose CL-6B, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) for removal of apolipoprotein E containing HDL particles. After extensive dialysis against four changes of buffer containing sterile PBS with 0.01% EDTA, HDL was labeled with 125I (NEN Life Science Products) by a modification of the iodine monochloride method (34.Ikewaki K. Rader D.J. Schaefer J.R. Fairwell T. Zech L.A. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 2207-2215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The labeled HDL contained less than 0.1% non-trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts. For the HDL turnover study, 5 μCi of 125I-HDL were injected into the tail veins of fasted sPLA2 transgenic and control mice. Blood samples were drawn by retroorbital bleeding at 5 min, 30 min, 1 h, 3 h, 5 h, 8 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h (about 25 μl at each time point). This procedure was well tolerated by all experimental animals. An aliquot of 10 μl of plasma from each time point was counted using a Cobra II γ counter (Packard Instruments, Downers Grove, IL). Plasma decay curves were generated by dividing the plasma radioactivity at each time point by the plasma radioactivity determined at the initial 5-min time point after tracer injection. The fractional catabolic rates (FCR) were determined from the area under the plasma disappearance curves fitted to a bicompartmental model using the SAAM II program (35.Barrett P.H.R. Bradley M.B. Cobelli C. Golde H. Schumitzky A. Vicini P. Foster D.M. Metabolism. 1998; 47: 484-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). To assess radiotracer curves specific for apoA-I and apoA-II, 1 μl of plasma for each time point was mixed with 14 μl of PBS and 5 μl of 4× non-reducing sample buffer and run on a 15% polyacrylamide gel (UltraPure, Life Technologies, Inc.) with running buffer containing final concentrations of 25 mm Tris, 192 mmglycine, and 0.1% (w/v) SDS, pH 8.3 (34.Ikewaki K. Rader D.J. Schaefer J.R. Fairwell T. Zech L.A. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 2207-2215Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue for 1 h, destained with a solution containing 10% acetic acid and 20% methanol, and dried under vacuum (model 583, Bio-Rad). ApoA-I- and apoA-II-specific bands were identified, cut out of the gels, and counted in a γ counter. More than 90% of the total radioactivity applied to the gel migrated in the apoA-I and apoA-II positions. Relative proportions of apoA-I- and apoA-II-specific radioactivity were assessed for each of the time points. These proportions were applied to the total plasma counts for the respective time point and apoA-I- and apoA-II-specific values were generated. These apoA-I- and apoA-II-specific plasma disappearance curves were modeled using the SAAM II program. Apolipoprotein-specific fractional catabolic rates for each mouse were determined. In addition to these studies with human HDL, we performed a series of double-label kinetic experiments with autologous mouse HDL. 6 ml of mouse plasma from sPLA2 transgenic mice and wild-type littermates was used for HDL isolation by sequential ultracentrifugation (density: 1.063 < d < 1.21). The isolated mouse HDL was processed and labeled as described above. Wild-type mouse HDL was labeled with 125I, and HDL from sPLA2 transgenic mice was labeled with 131I. Both tracers were then injected simultaneously into wild-type and sPLA2 transgenic mice according to the experimental protocol described above. The synthesis of tyramine-cellobiose using cellobiose, tyramine, and sodium cyanoborohydride (Sigma) was carried out as described (36.Pittman R.C. Taylor C.A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 612-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The purity of the synthesis product was checked by TLC as described (36.Pittman R.C. Taylor C.A.J. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 129: 612-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For the production of125I-tyramine-cellobiose (TC)-labeled HDL3,1 mCi of carrier-free 125I (NEN Life Science Products) and 1 IODOBEAD (Pierce) were added to a glass tube and incubated for 5 min. Then 0.1 mmol of tyramine-cellobiose in 10 ml of 0.4 msodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) was added and the iodination allowed to proceed for 30 min at room temperature. To this solution of125I-tyramine-cellobiose, 0.1 mmol of cyanuric chloride (Sigma) in 20 μl of acetone was added to activate the125I-tyramine-cellobiose and the reaction allowed to proceed for less than 1 min. For the protein binding, 0.3 mmol of HDL3 at a concentration of 5 mg/ml in a total volume of 1.8 ml of 0.4 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, was added to the activated 125I-tyramine-cellobiose and the reaction allowed to proceed for 3 h at room temperature. The unbound iodine was then removed by passing the solution over a Sephadex G25 desalting column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Finally the HDL was reisolated by ultracentrifugation at density 1.125 < d <1.21, dialyzed against three changes of PBS containing 0.01% EDTA, filter-sterilized, and stored at 4 °C until use. In order to ensure that the TC labeling did not alter the in vivo metabolism of the HDL, the metabolism of 125I-tyramine-cellobiose-HDL was directly compared with 131I-HDL by co-injection in the same mice. No differences were observed between 131I-HDL and125I-TC-HDL in plasma decay curves. To measure the organ uptake of HDL apolipoproteins, 4 μCi of125I-TC-HDL were injected into sPLA2 transgenic and control mice, and plasma decay curves were assessed as described above. At 24 h after injection, the mice were anesthesized with an intraperitoneal injected ketamine/xylazine mixture and perfused with cold PBS by cardiac puncture; and liver, spleen, kidney and adrenals were harvested. Radioactivity uptake into the organs was determined by γ counting and uptake of the 125I-tracer into the respective organs expressed in relation to hepatic tracer uptake. HDL3particles for these studies were isolated as described above. The labeling with cholesteryl hexadecyl ether (cholesteryl-1,2-3H) was carried out as described previously (37.Foger B. Santamarina-Fojo S. Shamburek R.D. Parrot C.L. Talley G.D. Brewer H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27393-27400Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.0 mCi of cholesteryl hexadecyl ether (NEN Life Science Products) in toluene were dried down under a stream of nitrogen. 0.075 ml of ethanol were then added, and the solution was taken up in a microliter pipette (Hamilton Co., Reno, NV). This was added dropwise to the HDL solution (300 μl of dialyzed HDL containing 6 mg of protein was added to 700 μl of sterile PBS) over a period of 5 min while gently shaking with short interruptions for a brief vortex. Finally, the HDL from this solution was reisolated by ultracentrifugation at the original density and the [3H]HDL was dialyzed overnight against four changes of PBS containing 0.01% EDTA. Finally, the [3H]HDL was filter-sterilized using 0.45- and 0.2-μm disposable sterile filters (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY) and stored at 4 °C until injection. For the metabolic study, 1 million dpm of HDL labeled with [3H]cholesteryl hexadecyl ether were injected into the tail veins of fasted sPLA2 transgenic and control mice as described (38.Plump A.S. Axrolan N. Odaka H. Wu L. Jiang X. Tall A. Eisenberg S. Breslow J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1033-1047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Blood samples were drawn by retroorbital bleeding at 2 min, 30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 9 h, 24 h, and 48 h after injection. Aliquots of 6 μl of plasma were counted in duplicate for each time point by adding the plasma to 5 ml of scintillation fluid (Scintiverse BD, Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ) and counting for 10 min on a scintillation counter (Beckman LS6500, Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). After correction with blank values, plasma disappearance curves were generated by dividing the plasma counts at each time point by the plasma counts determined at the initial 2 min time point after tracer injection. The fractional catabolic rates (FCR) were determined using the SAAM II program. After the 48-h blood sample was collected, liver, spleen, kidney, and adrenals were harvested as described above. The organs were weighed, and then weighed sections were minced and incubated with Solvable (Packard, Meriden, CT) according to the manufacturer's instructions for 3 h at 50 °C. 100 μl of 30% hydrogen peroxide was added to each vial and the samples were incubated for another 1-h time period at 50 °C. The samples were cooled at room temperature, mixed with Scintiverse BD (Fisher Scientific), incubated overnight in the dark at room temperature, and counted the next day. To assess HDL-CE tissue uptake, the counts recovered in each of the organs were related to the injected dose. Initial plasma counts were multiplied by the estimated plasma volume (3.5% of total body weight) and counts recovered in organs expressed as a percentage of this value. To determine absolute rates of HDL-CE delivery to different tissues, first tissue-specific FCR values were calculated by multiplying plasma FCR and percentage of injected dose found in the respective organs. The delivery rate of HDL-CE to each tissue per hour was then calculated as the product of relative tissue FCR and HDL-CE pool. Values are presented as mean ± S.D. unless otherwise indicated. Comparisons between different experimental groups were carried out using Student's t test for independent samples (two-tailed). p values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Plasma lipid levels in sPLA2 transgenic mice and their nontransgenic littermates are summarized in Table I. Total plasma cholesterol levels were significantly lower in sPLA2 transgenic mice as compared with controls (67 ± 11 mg/dlversus 86 ± 20 mg/dl, respectively, p< 0.01). This was mainly due to a 28% decrease in the HDL cholesterol fraction in these mice (39 ± 6 mg/dl versus 54 ± 6 mg/dl in controls, p < 0.01). Plasma triglyceride levels were not different. Plasma phospholipids were significantly decreased in the sPLA2 transgenic mice compared with controls (143 ± 19 mg/dl versus 178 ± 32 mg/dl, respectively, p < 0.01). FPLC gel filtration of pooled plasma from sPLA2 transgenic mice and nontransgenic littermates was performed in order to separate lipoproteins based on size (Fig.1). For the non-HDL fractions there was no difference in cholesterol distribution detectable in the two groups of mice studied. In contrast, the HDL cholesterol peak in sPLA2 transgenic mice was smaller and shifted toward smaller HDL particles. Analysis of the lipid composition of HDL particles isolated by ultracentrifugation from plasma after a 4-h fast (Table II) revealed a significant decrease in cholesteryl ester (27 ± 1% versus 44 ± 2%, respectively, p < 0.001) and phospholipids (33 ± 4% versus 44 ± 3%, respectively,p < 0.001) in sPLA2 transgenic mice as compared with controls. On the other hand, the percentage of triglycerides in HDL particles of sPLA2 transgenic mice was markedly increased (33 ± 2% versus 6 ± 0.5%, respectively, p < 0.001), while the relative proportion of free cholesterol was not different between both groups. These differences in HDL lipid composition between both groups of mice were also obtained when the concentration values (mg/dl) for each HDL component were taken.Table IPlasma lipid and apolipoprotein concentrations (mg/dl) in sPLA2transgenic mice and nontransgenic littermatesControl (n = 15)sPLA2 (n = 15)Total cholesterol86 ± 2067 ± 11*HDL cholesterol54 ± 639 ± 6*Triglycerides67 ± 1362 ± 14Phospholipids178 ± 32143 ± 19*Values are given as mean ± S.D.

To further investigate the metabolic mechanism leading to decreased HDL cholesterol and apoA-I levels in sPLA2 transgenic mice, kinetic studies with human125I-HDL were performed. The labeled HDL was catabolized much faster in the sPLA2 transgenic mice than in their nontransgenic littermates (Fig.2 A). Fractional catabolic rates were 2.16 ± 0.48 pools/day in the controls and 4.08 ± 0.01 pools/day in the sPLA2 transgenic mice (p < 0.001, Table III).Table IIIHDL fractional catabolic rates (pool/day) in sPLA2 transgenic mice and nontransgenic littermates using human HDL as tracerControl (n = 5)sPLA2 (n = 5)125I-HDL2.16 ± 0.484.08 ± 0.01*125A-I1.92 ± 0.023.6 ± 0.02*125A-II4.08 ± 0.244.32 ± 0.22*[3H]Cholesteryl ether4.8 ± 0.726.48 ± 0.24*Values are given as mean ± S.D.

To determine the effect of sPLA2 expression on specific apolipoproteins, apoA-I and apoA-II were analyzed separately (Fig. 2,B and C). The fractional catabolic rate of apoA-I was significantly faster in the sPLA2 mice (3.60 ± 0.02 pools/day) compared with control mice (1.92 ± 0.02 pools/day, p < 0.001, Table III). In contrast, the FCR of apoA-II in the sPLA2 transgenic mice was not significantly different from that in non-transgenic littermates (4.32 ± 0.22 pools/day versus 4.08 ± 0.24 pools/day, respectively, Table III). These results demonstrate that sPLA2 expression leads to faster catabolism of apoA-I but not apoA-II. In addition, kinetic experiments using autologous mouse HDL as a tracer were performed (Fig. 3 A).131I-HDL isolated from sPLA2 transgenic mice was catabolized significantly faster in sPLA2 transgenic mice than was wild-type 125I-HDL in wild-type mice (5.18 ± 0.07 pools/day versus 2.18 ± 0.05 pools/day, respectively, p < 0.001, TableIV). The FCR values obtained were remarkably similar to those obtained using a human HDL tracer described above. Since this study was performed using a double-label design, we also directly compared the catabolism of the two mouse HDL tracers in both groups of mice (Fig. 3, B and C). Interestingly, HDL isolated from sPLA2 transgenic mice was catabolized significantly faster in wild-type mice than the autologous wild-type HDL (2.98 ± 0.15 pools/day versus 2.18 ± 0.05 pools/day, respectively, p < 0.001, Fig.3 B, Table IV), indicating that sPLA2-modified HDL is metabolically abnormal even in a normal environment.

UCR1 and UCR2 are located between the extreme amino-terminal region and the catalytic region of the PDE4 enzymes. The UCR1 of the PDE4D3 isoform was used as a “bait” in a two-hybrid screen, which identified a PDE4D cDNA clone containing UCR2 and the catalytic region but not UCR1. Two-hybrid and “pull down” analysis of constructs incorporating various regions of the PDE4D3 cDNA demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal region of UCR1 interacted specifically with the amino-terminal region of UCR2. The interaction was blocked by mutations of two positively charged amino acids (Arg-98 and Arg-101 to alanine) located within an otherwise largely hydrophobic region of UCR1. Mutation of three negatively charged amino acids in UCR2 (Glu-146, Glu-147, and Asp-149, all to alanine) also blocked the interaction. The phosphorylation of UCR1 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in vitro attenuated the ability of UCR1 to interact with UCR2. Mutation of the PKA substrate site in UCR1 (Ser-54) to aspartic acid, which mimics the activation of PDE4D3 by PKA, profoundly reduced the interaction between UCR1 and UCR2. Our data are consistent with a model in which UCR1 and UCR2 act as independent domains whose interaction is determined by electrostatic interactions and which may be disrupted by PKA phosphorylation.

UCR1 and UCR2 are located between the extreme amino-terminal regions of the proteins and their catalytic regions (Fig. 1).

However, a phosphorylation site for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) is located at the beginning of UCR1 (Ser-54 in PDE4D3, Fig. 1) and phosphorylation of the PDE4D3 isoform activates the enzyme and changes its ability to be inhibited by rolipram (7.Sette C.

This is demonstrated by our data in which UCR1 interacts with UCR2 when both are expressed as one of several different fusions (e.g. the LexA DNA-binding domain or MBP for UCR1, and the GAL4 activation domain or GST for UCR2). This behavior of UCR1 and UCR2 is reminiscent of SH2 and SH3 regions, which also form self-folding domains able to participate in protein-protein interactions (21.McPhee I. Pooley L. Lobban M.

Chem. 1996; 271: 16526-16534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of Ser-54 in PDE4D3 changes the enzymatic activity (relative V max) and shifts the dose-response curve for rolipram (7.Sette C. Iona S. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9245-9252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Sette C. Vicini E. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18271-18274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Sette C.

J. 1998; 333: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, analysis of PDE4D3 mutants in the region of the Ser-54 PKA phosphorylation site led us to propose a model that implied that Ser-54 and Glu-53 were involved in forming bonds that influenced the structure of the catalytic unit of the enzyme (10.Hoffmann R. Wilkinson I.R. McCallum J.F. Engels P. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In this model, Glu-53 was involved in forming an ion pair which kept the enzyme in a low activity state and whose disruption (e.g.the E53A mutant) changed the activity of the enzyme but did not alter the sensitivity of the enzyme to inhibition by the PDE4-selective inhibitor rolipram. The model also suggested that the side chain hydroxyl group of Ser-54 was involved in forming a hydrogen bond that did not alter enzyme activity but influenced the conformation of the enzyme catalytic region, as measured by an increase in susceptibility of the enzyme to inhibition by rolipram. Phosphorylation of Ser-54 (or the S54D mutation) disrupted both the Glu-53 and Ser-54 bonds, leading to enzyme activation and enhanced sensitivity to inhibition by rolipram. However, the S54A mutation blocked only the Ser-54 bond, producing a change only in rolipram inhibition. In the present paper, we demonstrate that the S54D and S54A mutants, but not the E53A or S54T mutants, block the UCR1-UCR2 interaction. Therefore, it is likely that the Ser-54 hydrogen bond, but not the Glu-53 ion pair, is essential for the UCR1-UCR2 interaction. In turn, this suggests that disruption of the UCR1-UCR2 interaction leads to an alteration in the conformation of the catalytic unit that is detected by altered rolipram inhibition but that is insufficient for enzyme activation.We present a model for the structure of the PDE4 enzyme, based on our data (Fig. 6). The model proposes that UCR1 and UCR2 each contain one or more self-folding domains that interact with other regions of the PDE4 enzymes. One important interaction, as demonstrated by our data, is between the carboxyl-terminal region of UCR1 and the amino-terminal region of UCR2. This interaction is mediated by electrostatic interactions between positively charged amino acids in UCR1 and negatively charged amino acids in UCR2, as demonstrated by our mutational analysis. The interaction may be modulated by PKA phosphorylation of a serine in the extreme amino-terminal region of UCR1 (i.e. a region not interacting directly with UCR2). This is compatible with the UCR1 amino-terminal domain affecting the UCR1 carboxyl-terminal region and preventing it from interacting with UCR2. UCR1 and UCR2 thus appear to form a regulatory module that in turn regulates the PDE4 catalytic unit. Structural analysis of the PDE4 enzyme will be needed for further insight into the molecular mechanisms of this regulation.Figure 6A model for the UCR1-UCR2 interaction.Various regions of the PDE4D3 isoform are shown, with the interactions between various domains depicted schematically. NT refers to the extreme amino-terminal region. UCR1 is divided into two domains, with the amino-terminal domain containing the PKA phosphorylation site, and the carboxyl-terminal domain interacting with UCR2. LR1and LR2 refer to linker regions 1 and 2, which connect UCR1 with UCR2, and UCR2 with the catalytic region, respectively. UCR2 is divided into several potential domains (2.Houslay M.D. Sullivan M.

Phosphorylation of Ser-54 in PDE4D3 changes the enzymatic activity (relative V max) and shifts the dose-response curve for rolipram (7.Sette C. Iona S. Conti M. J. Biol.

J. 1998; 333: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, analysis of PDE4D3 mutants in the region of the Ser-54 PKA phosphorylation site led us to propose a model that implied that Ser-54 and Glu-53 were involved in forming bonds that influenced the structure of the catalytic unit of the enzyme (10.Hoffmann R. Wilkinson I.R. McCallum J.F. Engels P. Houslay M.D. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In this model, Glu-53 was involved in forming an ion pair which kept the enzyme in a low activity state and whose disruption (e.g.the E53A mutant) changed the activity of the enzyme but did not alter the sensitivity of the enzyme to inhibition by the PDE4-selective inhibitor rolipram. The model also suggested that the side chain hydroxyl group of Ser-54 was involved in forming a hydrogen bond that did not alter enzyme activity but influenced the conformation of the enzyme catalytic region, as measured by an increase in susceptibility of the enzyme to inhibition by rolipram. Phosphorylation of Ser-54 (or the S54D mutation) disrupted both the Glu-53 and Ser-54 bonds, leading to enzyme activation and enhanced sensitivity to inhibition by rolipram. However, the S54A mutation blocked only the Ser-54 bond, producing a change only in rolipram inhibition. In the present paper, we demonstrate that the S54D and S54A mutants, but not the E53A or S54T mutants, block the UCR1-UCR2 interaction. Therefore, it is likely that the Ser-54 hydrogen bond, but not the Glu-53 ion pair, is essential for the UCR1-UCR2 interaction. In turn, this suggests that disruption of the UCR1-UCR2 interaction leads to an alteration in the conformation of the catalytic unit that is detected by altered rolipram inhibition but that is insufficient for enzyme activation.We present a model for the structure of the PDE4 enzyme, based on our data (Fig. 6). The model proposes that UCR1 and UCR2 each contain one or more self-folding domains that interact with other regions of the PDE4 enzymes. One important interaction, as demonstrated by our data, is between the carboxyl-terminal region of UCR1 and the amino-terminal region of UCR2. This interaction is mediated by electrostatic interactions between positively charged amino acids in UCR1 and negatively charged amino acids in UCR2, as demonstrated by our mutational analysis. The interaction may be modulated by PKA phosphorylation of a serine in the extreme amino-terminal region of UCR1 (i.e. a region not interacting directly with UCR2). This is compatible with the UCR1 amino-terminal domain affecting the UCR1 carboxyl-terminal region and preventing it from interacting with UCR2. UCR1 and UCR2 thus appear to form a regulatory module that in turn regulates the PDE4 catalytic unit. Structural analysis of the PDE4 enzyme will be needed for further insight into the molecular mechanisms of this regulation. UCR1 and UCR2 are regions of sequence that are unique “signatures” of the PDE4 cAMP-specific phosphodiesterase family. They are located in the amino-terminal regions of these enzymes and are clearly separate from their catalytic regions. They are highly conserved in evolution, as they are present in isoforms encoded by all four human and rat PDE4 genes and also in PDE genes in organisms as distantly related as D. melanogaster (4.Qiu Y.H. Chen C.N. Malone T. Richter L. Beckendorf S.K. Davis R.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 553-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) andC. elegans (6.The Caenorhabditis elegans Sequencing ConsortiumScience. 1998; 282: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Scopus (3570) Google Scholar). Studies of PDE4 deletion constructs have demonstrated that UCR1 and UCR2 have no direct role in catalysis (reviewed in Ref. 2.Houslay M.D. Sullivan M. Bolger G.B. Adv. Pharmacol. 1998; 44: 225-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). However, regions of amino acid sequence that are highly conserved in evolution are usually of functional significance. To determine more about the properties of UCR1, it was used in a two-hybrid screen. Intriguingly, the screen demonstrated that UCR1 interacted with UCR2. Additional two-hybrid tests demonstrated that the carboxyl-terminal region of UCR1 interacted with the amino-terminal end of UCR2 and that this interaction was dependent on specifically charged amino acids within these regions. The interaction was confirmed and further characterized by pull down assays using UCR1 and UCR2 expressed as fusion proteins. Our data are consistent with the concept that both UCR1 and UCR2 act as authentic protein domains. In other words, UCR1 and UCR2 can each fold into independent modules that appear to retain their structure in a variety of contexts. This is demonstrated by our data in which UCR1 interacts with UCR2 when both are expressed as one of several different fusions (e.g. the LexA DNA-binding domain or MBP for UCR1, and the GAL4 activation domain or GST for UCR2). This behavior of UCR1 and UCR2 is reminiscent of SH2 and SH3 regions, which also form self-folding domains able to participate in protein-protein interactions (21.McPhee I. Pooley L. Lobban M.

One such target is the Plasmodium spp. chitinase (EC. 3.2.1.14). Chitinases are found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (1.Flach J. Pilet P.-E. Jolles P. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 701-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar); their biologic roles include cell wall modification (e.g.fungi (2.Kuranda M.J. Robbins P.W. J. Biol.

Jolles P. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 701-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). One other protozoan pathogen of man, Leishmania donovani, the agent of human visceral leishmaniasis, is known to use a chitinase in its life cycle (9.Schlein Y. Jacobson R. Shlomai J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1991; 245: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 10.Shakarian A. Dwyer D. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 208: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The Leishmaniachitinase is thought to disrupt the sand fly cardiac valve, allowing amastigotes to be regurgitated from the midgut into the skin of the vertebrate host. The Leishmania chitinase is not thought to function in invasion of the arthropod vector per se (11.Schlein Y. Jacobson R. Messer G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9944-9948Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast, Plasmodium chitinase is thought to be required for the parasite to invade the mosquito midgut after being taken up in a blood meal (12.Shahabuddin M. Toyoshima T. Aikawa M. Kaslow D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4266-4270Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Because of its critical biological function in the life cycle of the malaria parasite, the Plasmodium chitinase is a potential target for blocking transmission from the vertebrate host to the mosquito vector (12.Shahabuddin M. Toyoshima T. Aikawa M. Kaslow D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4266-4270Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar).How the Plasmodium ookinete penetrates the chitin-containing peritrophic matrix to begin its invasion of the mosquito has been outlined. By using transmission electron microscopy, Sieber et al. (13.Sieber K. Huber M. Kaslow D. Banks S. Torii M. Aikawa M. Miller L. Exp. Parasitol. 1991; 72: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the motile ookinete, fully mature 20–25 h after zygote formation, actively penetrates the peritrophic matrix (PM)1 in the mosquito midgut en route to invading the midgut epithelium. Huberet al. (14.Huber M. Cabib E. Miller L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2807-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) showed that the Plasmodium gallinaceum ookinete secretes chitinolytic activity. Native activity gel electrophoresis of ookinete cell extracts and culture supernatants showed two predominant bands of chitinase activity, but the precise molecular masses of the two forms could not be determined because active enzyme could not be obtained after SDS-PAGE. Shahabuddinet al. (12.Shahabuddin M. Toyoshima T. Aikawa M. Kaslow D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4266-4270Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) showed that addition of an oligosaccharide chitinase antagonist, allosamidin, to a blood meal prevents oocyst formation in the mosquito, in both the Aedes aegypti-P. gallinaceum and the Anopheles freeborni Plasmodium falciparum model systems. This effect could be completely reversed by enzymatic degradation of the PM in vivo, by adding exogenous chitinase to the blood meal. These observations demonstrated that a chitinase is necessary for malaria parasites to invade the mosquito and initiate sporogonic development.Because of intrinsic biologic interest and the potential forPlasmodium chitinases to be targets of interfering with malaria transmission (for a review of malaria transmission-blocking vaccines and the potential of Plasmodium chitinases as targets, see Refs. 15.Kaslow D. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar and 16.Shahabuddin M. Kaslow D. Parasit. Today. 1993; 9: 252-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we sought to characterize the malaria parasite chitinase genes. We began our studies with the chitinase of the avian malaria parasite, P. gallinaceum; this parasite is thought to be closely related to the lethal human malaria parasite,P. falciparum (17.McCutchan T. Kissinger J. Touray M. Rogers M. Li J. Sullivan M. Braga E. Krettli A. Miller L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11889-11894Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 18.Waters A. Higgins D. McCutchan T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3140-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Conveniently, large numbers ofP. gallinaceum chitinase-producing ookinetes can be obtainedin vitro, allowing for the direct study of the protein. In addition, P. gallinaceum serves as a useful model system for studying malaria parasite transmission (19.Gwadz R.W. Science. 1976; 193: 1150-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 20.Carter R. Chen D. Nature. 1976; 263: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONWe report here the purification of a 60-kDa P. gallinaceum ookinete-secreted chitinase and characterize the gene,PgCHT1, encoding it. The experiments presented here identify at least two developmentally regulated chitinases expressed by P. gallinaceum ookinetes. Both are inhibited by allosamidin at concentrations far less than those used in in vivo studies for blocking ookinete penetration of the mosquito peritrophic membrane (12.Shahabuddin M. Toyoshima T. Aikawa M. Kaslow D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4266-4270Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Both are secreted and act as endochitinases, a property that would be expected of enzymes that allows the ookinete to penetrate and traverse the PM in the mosquito midgut.At least two chitinase activities are separable by HPLC. The first, encoded by the gene, PgCHT1, was identified from peak 1 as a 60-kDa doublet (Fig. 1), which is composed of two forms of the protein, NT1 and NT2, which differ in size by 14 amino acids (Fig. 3). The NT1 form of PgCHT1, expressed as a recombinant protein in E. coli, has chitinase activity that is increased 73-fold by treatment with Endo Lys-C. The Endo Lys-C cleavage site is between eight and nine amino acid residues downstream from the amino terminus of the NT2 form, strongly suggesting that the NT2 form is an active chitinase. It is not clear if the NT1 form is fully active or needs to be converted further by parasite-produced proteases to the NT2 form for full activity. Whereas activity of the recombinant fusion protein rPgCHT1-NT1 is enhanced by Endo Lys-C, we found that Endo Lys-C has no effect on the activity of crude native ookinete-produced chitinase. One explanation of this discrepancy is that the 105-amino acid fusion partner of the recombinant fusion protein could be acting as the pro-enzyme domain does in the native produced gene product to inhibit enzyme activity and that the four amino acids remaining amino-terminal to the NT1 site remaining after enterokinase treatment prevent full activity of the enzyme. It is also possible that Endo Lys-C could inactivate the activity of some chitinases in crude ookinete culture supernatants while increasing the activity of other chitinases, leading to the finding of no overall change of chitinase activity of ookinete culture supernatants when treated by Endo Lys-C. The essential point is that we have demonstrated that the ookinete itself is capable of processing a pro-chitinase to a fully active form, and mosquito midgut proteases are not required for fully active ookinete-produced chitinase activity. This interpretation stands in contrast to previous models that hypothesize that the late trypsins expressed by the mosquito midgut more than 10 h after blood meal ingestion activate ookinete-produced chitinase (to increase the activity as much as 13-fold) for the purpose of optimizing the timing of mosquito midgut invasion (12.Shahabuddin M. Toyoshima T. Aikawa M. Kaslow D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4266-4270Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 16.Shahabuddin M. Kaslow D. Parasit. Today. 1993; 9: 252-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 32.Shahabuddin M. Parasitology. 1998; 116 (suppl.): 83-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that the P. falciparum chitinase homolog, PfCHT1, has no proenzyme domain and is a chitinase that does not require proteolytic activation for its enzymatic activity (31.Vinetz J.M. Dave S.K. Specht C.S. Brameld K.A. Xu B. Hayward R.E. Fidock D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14061-14066Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The comparative activities of the NT1 and NT2 forms of PgCHT1 will be the focus of further study.Peak 2 chitinase hydrolyzes 4-MU derivatives in a pattern similar to that produced by peak 1 and rPgCHT1 (data not shown). However, peak 2 chitinase has a distinct pH activity profile and is about 30-fold more sensitive to allosamidin (Fig. 11 b) than rPgCHT1 and native peak 1 chitinase. Under reducing and denaturing conditions, a number of proteins, including a 35-kDa protein in peak 2, were identified by Western immunoblotting that increase in expression in parallel with an increased chitinase activity (Figs. 5 and 6). The 35-kDa protein reacts with antisera prepared from a peptide from the catalytic domain of PgCHT1, but not with antisera from a carboxyl-terminal peptide of PgCHT1. Collectively, the different enzymatic properties and immunological reactivity of the peak 2 chitinase support the hypothesis that this chitinase is the product of a different gene,PgCHT2. Under non-reducing conditions, peak 2 chitinase migrates as a ∼210-kDa protein. It is not clear whether the complex would be composed solely of PgCHT2 protein subunits.Other proteins (∼30-kDa in peak 1 and ∼160-kDa in peak 2) that cross-react with the active site antisera have not yet been further characterized, although these proteins also are stage-specifically expressed by ookinetes (Fig. 5). Additional chromatography of peak 2 suggests that the ∼160-kDa protein in fact does have chitinase activity, as determined with the 4-MU GlcNAc3 substrate (data not shown). This latter observation is consistent with the possibility that these unidentified cross-reactive proteins are also chitinases. Experiments to identify and characterize the other chitinase proteins in peaks 1 and 2 at the molecular level are underway.In the work presented here, we first identified a fragment of a putative P. falciparum chitinase. This fragment contains a catalytic domain but not a recognizable chitin binding domain; a stop codon appears at the end of the predicted catalytic domain. Work is in progress to characterize further the role of the P. falciparum chitinase gene, PfCHT1, in parasite invasion of the Anopheles midgut (31.Vinetz J.M. Dave S.K. Specht C.S. Brameld K.A. Xu B. Hayward R.E. Fidock D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14061-14066Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).An important goal of research on the malaria parasite chitinases is to develop novel ways to interrupt malaria transmission. With the cloning of a full-length P. gallinaceum chitinase gene, recombinant chitinase can be synthesized and tested as a transmission-blocking vaccine in an in vivo avian malaria transmission model. ThePlasmodium chitinases potentially share B cell epitopes with similar proteins in humans, particularly in the catalytic active site (Fig. 4 (38.Renkema G. Boot R. Au F. Donker-Koopman W.

Detailed structural analysis may provide insight into regions of the Plasmodium chitinases that could be safe and effective transmission-blocking vaccine candidates, avoiding potential autoimmune reactions. Determining three-dimensional structures of the Plasmodium chitinase domains may be possible and would provide the basis for rational design of a transmission-blocking drug. It may be possible to develop peptide chitinase inhibitors, the genes of which may be used for transforming mosquitoes (40.Coates C.J. Jasinskiene N. Miyashiro L. James A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

Finally, we have initiated experiments to knock out the P. falciparum chitinase gene to determine whether its gene product is necessary for mosquito invasion or whether, perhaps, P. falciparum too has additional chitinase genes. Defining molecular targets for drug or vaccine intervention remains a key strategy for developing new ways to prevent and treat malaria, a disease that exacts an enormous social and economic toll worldwide. One such target is the Plasmodium spp. chitinase (EC. 3.2.1.14). Chitinases are found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (1.Flach J. Pilet P.-E. Jolles P. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 701-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar); their biologic roles include cell wall modification (e.g.fungi (2.Kuranda M.J. Robbins P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19758-19767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), Entamoebae (3.Villagomez-Castro J. Calvo-Mendez C. Lopez-Romero E. Mol. Biochem.

Jolles P. Experientia (Basel). 1992; 48: 701-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). One other protozoan pathogen of man, Leishmania donovani, the agent of human visceral leishmaniasis, is known to use a chitinase in its life cycle (9.Schlein Y. Jacobson R. Shlomai J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1991; 245: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 10.Shakarian A. Dwyer D. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 208: 315-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The Leishmaniachitinase is thought to disrupt the sand fly cardiac valve, allowing amastigotes to be regurgitated from the midgut into the skin of the vertebrate host. The Leishmania chitinase is not thought to function in invasion of the arthropod vector per se (11.Schlein Y. Jacobson R. Messer G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9944-9948Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In contrast, Plasmodium chitinase is thought to be required for the parasite to invade the mosquito midgut after being taken up in a blood meal (12.Shahabuddin M. Toyoshima T. Aikawa M. Kaslow D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4266-4270Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Because of its critical biological function in the life cycle of the malaria parasite, the Plasmodium chitinase is a potential target for blocking transmission from the vertebrate host to the mosquito vector (12.Shahabuddin M. Toyoshima T. Aikawa M. Kaslow D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4266-4270Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). How the Plasmodium ookinete penetrates the chitin-containing peritrophic matrix to begin its invasion of the mosquito has been outlined. By using transmission electron microscopy, Sieber et al. (13.Sieber K. Huber M. Kaslow D. Banks S. Torii M. Aikawa M. Miller L. Exp. Parasitol. 1991; 72: 145-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the motile ookinete, fully mature 20–25 h after zygote formation, actively penetrates the peritrophic matrix (PM)1 in the mosquito midgut en route to invading the midgut epithelium. Huberet al. (14.Huber M. Cabib E. Miller L.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2807-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) showed that the Plasmodium gallinaceum ookinete secretes chitinolytic activity. Native activity gel electrophoresis of ookinete cell extracts and culture supernatants showed two predominant bands of chitinase activity, but the precise molecular masses of the two forms could not be determined because active enzyme could not be obtained after SDS-PAGE. Shahabuddinet al. (12.Shahabuddin M. Toyoshima T. Aikawa M. Kaslow D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4266-4270Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar) showed that addition of an oligosaccharide chitinase antagonist, allosamidin, to a blood meal prevents oocyst formation in the mosquito, in both the Aedes aegypti-P. gallinaceum and the Anopheles freeborni Plasmodium falciparum model systems. This effect could be completely reversed by enzymatic degradation of the PM in vivo, by adding exogenous chitinase to the blood meal. These observations demonstrated that a chitinase is necessary for malaria parasites to invade the mosquito and initiate sporogonic development. Because of intrinsic biologic interest and the potential forPlasmodium chitinases to be targets of interfering with malaria transmission (for a review of malaria transmission-blocking vaccines and the potential of Plasmodium chitinases as targets, see Refs. 15.Kaslow D. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 557-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar and 16.Shahabuddin M. Kaslow D. Parasit. Today. 1993; 9: 252-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), we sought to characterize the malaria parasite chitinase genes. We began our studies with the chitinase of the avian malaria parasite, P. gallinaceum; this parasite is thought to be closely related to the lethal human malaria parasite,P. falciparum (17.McCutchan T. Kissinger J. Touray M. Rogers M. Li J. Sullivan M. Braga E. Krettli A. Miller L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11889-11894Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 18.Waters A. Higgins D. McCutchan T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3140-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Conveniently, large numbers ofP. gallinaceum chitinase-producing ookinetes can be obtainedin vitro, allowing for the direct study of the protein. In addition, P. gallinaceum serves as a useful model system for studying malaria parasite transmission (19.Gwadz R.W. Science. 1976; 193: 1150-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 20.Carter R. Chen D. Nature. 1976; 263: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). DISCUSSIONWe report here the purification of a 60-kDa P. gallinaceum ookinete-secreted chitinase and characterize the gene,PgCHT1, encoding it. The experiments presented here identify at least two developmentally regulated chitinases expressed by P. gallinaceum ookinetes. Both are inhibited by allosamidin at concentrations far less than those used in in vivo studies for blocking ookinete penetration of the mosquito peritrophic membrane (12.Shahabuddin M. Toyoshima T. Aikawa M. Kaslow D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4266-4270Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Both are secreted and act as endochitinases, a property that would be expected of enzymes that allows the ookinete to penetrate and traverse the PM in the mosquito midgut.At least two chitinase activities are separable by HPLC. The first, encoded by the gene, PgCHT1, was identified from peak 1 as a 60-kDa doublet (Fig. 1), which is composed of two forms of the protein, NT1 and NT2, which differ in size by 14 amino acids (Fig. 3). The NT1 form of PgCHT1, expressed as a recombinant protein in E. coli, has chitinase activity that is increased 73-fold by treatment with Endo Lys-C. The Endo Lys-C cleavage site is between eight and nine amino acid residues downstream from the amino terminus of the NT2 form, strongly suggesting that the NT2 form is an active chitinase. It is not clear if the NT1 form is fully active or needs to be converted further by parasite-produced proteases to the NT2 form for full activity. Whereas activity of the recombinant fusion protein rPgCHT1-NT1 is enhanced by Endo Lys-C, we found that Endo Lys-C has no effect on the activity of crude native ookinete-produced chitinase. One explanation of this discrepancy is that the 105-amino acid fusion partner of the recombinant fusion protein could be acting as the pro-enzyme domain does in the native produced gene product to inhibit enzyme activity and that the four amino acids remaining amino-terminal to the NT1 site remaining after enterokinase treatment prevent full activity of the enzyme. It is also possible that Endo Lys-C could inactivate the activity of some chitinases in crude ookinete culture supernatants while increasing the activity of other chitinases, leading to the finding of no overall change of chitinase activity of ookinete culture supernatants when treated by Endo Lys-C. The essential point is that we have demonstrated that the ookinete itself is capable of processing a pro-chitinase to a fully active form, and mosquito midgut proteases are not required for fully active ookinete-produced chitinase activity. This interpretation stands in contrast to previous models that hypothesize that the late trypsins expressed by the mosquito midgut more than 10 h after blood meal ingestion activate ookinete-produced chitinase (to increase the activity as much as 13-fold) for the purpose of optimizing the timing of mosquito midgut invasion (12.Shahabuddin M. Toyoshima T. Aikawa M. Kaslow D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4266-4270Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 16.Shahabuddin M. Kaslow D. Parasit. Today. 1993; 9: 252-255Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 32.Shahabuddin M. Parasitology. 1998; 116 (suppl.): 83-93Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that the P. falciparum chitinase homolog, PfCHT1, has no proenzyme domain and is a chitinase that does not require proteolytic activation for its enzymatic activity (31.Vinetz J.M. Dave S.K. Specht C.S. Brameld K.A. Xu B. Hayward R.E. Fidock D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14061-14066Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The comparative activities of the NT1 and NT2 forms of PgCHT1 will be the focus of further study.Peak 2 chitinase hydrolyzes 4-MU derivatives in a pattern similar to that produced by peak 1 and rPgCHT1 (data not shown). However, peak 2 chitinase has a distinct pH activity profile and is about 30-fold more sensitive to allosamidin (Fig. 11 b) than rPgCHT1 and native peak 1 chitinase. Under reducing and denaturing conditions, a number of proteins, including a 35-kDa protein in peak 2, were identified by Western immunoblotting that increase in expression in parallel with an increased chitinase activity (Figs. 5 and 6). The 35-kDa protein reacts with antisera prepared from a peptide from the catalytic domain of PgCHT1, but not with antisera from a carboxyl-terminal peptide of PgCHT1. Collectively, the different enzymatic properties and immunological reactivity of the peak 2 chitinase support the hypothesis that this chitinase is the product of a different gene,PgCHT2. Under non-reducing conditions, peak 2 chitinase migrates as a ∼210-kDa protein. It is not clear whether the complex would be composed solely of PgCHT2 protein subunits.Other proteins (∼30-kDa in peak 1 and ∼160-kDa in peak 2) that cross-react with the active site antisera have not yet been further characterized, although these proteins also are stage-specifically expressed by ookinetes (Fig. 5). Additional chromatography of peak 2 suggests that the ∼160-kDa protein in fact does have chitinase activity, as determined with the 4-MU GlcNAc3 substrate (data not shown). This latter observation is consistent with the possibility that these unidentified cross-reactive proteins are also chitinases. Experiments to identify and characterize the other chitinase proteins in peaks 1 and 2 at the molecular level are underway.In the work presented here, we first identified a fragment of a putative P. falciparum chitinase. This fragment contains a catalytic domain but not a recognizable chitin binding domain; a stop codon appears at the end of the predicted catalytic domain. Work is in progress to characterize further the role of the P. falciparum chitinase gene, PfCHT1, in parasite invasion of the Anopheles midgut (31.Vinetz J.M. Dave S.K. Specht C.S. Brameld K.A. Xu B.

A. 1999; 96: 14061-14066Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar).An important goal of research on the malaria parasite chitinases is to develop novel ways to interrupt malaria transmission. With the cloning of a full-length P. gallinaceum chitinase gene, recombinant chitinase can be synthesized and tested as a transmission-blocking vaccine in an in vivo avian malaria transmission model. ThePlasmodium chitinases potentially share B cell epitopes with similar proteins in humans, particularly in the catalytic active site (Fig. 4 (38.Renkema G. Boot R. Au F. Donker-Koopman W.

Detailed structural analysis may provide insight into regions of the Plasmodium chitinases that could be safe and effective transmission-blocking vaccine candidates, avoiding potential autoimmune reactions. Determining three-dimensional structures of the Plasmodium chitinase domains may be possible and would provide the basis for rational design of a transmission-blocking drug. It may be possible to develop peptide chitinase inhibitors, the genes of which may be used for transforming mosquitoes (40.Coates C.J. Jasinskiene N. Miyashiro L. James A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

https://openalex.org/W1971113488,"Agonist-dependent regulation of G protein-coupled receptors is dependent on their phosphorylation by G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). GRK2 and GRK3 are selectively regulated in vitro by free Gβγ subunits and negatively charged membrane phospholipids through their pleckstrin homology (PH) domains. However, the molecular binding determinants and physiological role for these ligands remain unclear. To address these issues, we generated an array of site-directed mutants within the GRK2 PH domain and characterized their interaction with Gβγ and phospholipids in vitro. Mutation of several residues in the loop 1 region of the PH domain, including Lys-567, Trp-576, Arg-578, and Arg-579, resulted in a loss of receptor phosphorylation, likely via disruption of phospholipid binding, that was reversed by Gβγ. Alternatively, mutation of residues distal to the C-terminal amphipathic α-helix, including Lys-663, Lys-665, Lys-667, and Arg-669, resulted in decreased responsiveness to Gβγ. Interestingly, mutation of Arg-587 in β-sheet 3, a region not previously thought to interact with Gβγ, resulted in a specific and profound loss of Gβγ responsiveness. To further characterize these effects, two mutants (GRK2(K567E/R578E) and GRK2(R587Q)) were expressed in Sf9 cells and purified. Analysis of these mutants revealed that GRK2(K567E/R578E) was refractory to stimulation by negatively charged phospholipids but bound Gβγ similar to wild-type GRK2. In contrast, GRK2(R587Q) was stimulated by acidic phospholipids but failed to bind Gβγ. In order to examine the role of phospholipid and Gβγ interaction in cells, wild-type and mutant GRK2s were expressed with a β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) mutant that is responsive to GRK2 phosphorylation (β2AR(Y326A)). In these cells, GRK2(K567E/R578E) and GRK2(R587Q) were largely defective in promoting agonist-dependent phosphorylation and internalization of β2AR(Y326A). Similarly, wild-type GRK2 but not GRK2(K567E/R578E) or GRK2(R587Q) promoted morphinedependent phosphorylation of the μ-opioid receptor in cells. Thus, we have (i) identified several specific GRK2 binding determinants for Gβγ and phospholipids, and (ii) demonstrated that Gβγ binding is the limiting step for GRK2-dependent receptor phosphorylation in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2150172750,"The serine/threonine kinase Rho-kinase was recently identified as a downstream effector of the small GTPase Rho, mediating effects of Rho on the actin cytoskeleton. Also phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) has been implicated in the regulation of actin polymerization. As the synthesis of PI(4,5)P2 has been suggested to be affected by Rho proteins, we investigated whether Rho-kinase is involved in the control of PI(4,5)P2 levels. Overexpression of RhoA in HEK-293 cells increased phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P) 5-kinase activity and concomitantly enhanced cellular PI(4,5)P2 levels, whereas overexpression of the Rho-inactivating C3 transferase decreased both PI4P 5-kinase activity and PI(4,5)P2 levels. These effects of RhoA could be mimicked by overexpression of wild-type Rho-kinase and of the constitutively active catalytic domain of Rho-kinase, Rho-kinase-CAT. In contrast, a kinase-deficient mutant of Rho-kinase had no effect on PI4P 5-kinase activity. Importantly, the increase in PI4P 5-kinase activity and PI(4,5)P2 levels by wild-type Rho-kinase, but not by Rho-kinase-CAT, was completely prevented by coexpression of C3 transferase, indicating that the effect of Rho-kinase was under the control of endogenous Rho. In cell lysates, addition of recombinant RhoA and Rho-kinase-CAT stimulated PI4P 5-kinase activity. Finally, the increase in PI(4,5)P2 levels induced by both Rho-kinase-CAT and RhoA was reversed by the Rho-kinase inhibitor HA-1077. Our data suggest that Rho-kinase is involved in the Rho-controlled synthesis of PI(4,5)P2 by PI4P 5-kinase.

Importantly, the increase in PI4P 5-kinase activity and PI(4,5)P2 levels by wild-type Rho-kinase, but not by Rho-kinase-CAT, was completely prevented by coexpression of C3 transferase, indicating that the effect of Rho-kinase was under the control of endogenous Rho. In cell lysates, addition of recombinant RhoA and Rho-kinase-CAT stimulated PI4P 5-kinase activity. Finally, the increase in PI(4,5)P2 levels induced by both Rho-kinase-CAT and RhoA was reversed by the Rho-kinase inhibitor HA-1077. Our data suggest that Rho-kinase is involved in the Rho-controlled synthesis of PI(4,5)P2 by PI4P 5-kinase. 5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate phospholipase C phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase phospholipase D phosphatidylinositol phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase guanosine 5′-O-(3-thio)triphosphate high pressure liquid chromatography catalytic domain of Rho-kinase Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2)1 is a versatile phospholipid with pleiotropic cellular functions (1.Toker A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). PI(4,5)P2 is not only a substrate for phospholipase C (PLC) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI 3-kinases), it also serves as a membrane docking site for pleckstrin homology-containing proteins (2.Harlan J.E. Hajduk P.J. Yoon H.S. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PI(4,5)P2 has been reported to interact with several proteins/enzymes involved in vesicle trafficking, including phospholipase D (PLD) and ADP-ribosylation factor (3.Liscovitch M. Chalifa V. Pertile P. Chen C.S. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21403-21406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Randazzo P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7688-7692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The binding and displacement of various actin regulatory proteins from actin filaments by PI(4,5)P2 allows the polymerization of these filaments, indicating an important role for PI(4,5)P2 in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (5.Janmey P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 169-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). Also small GTPases of the Rho family have been implicated in the regulation of the cytoskeleton. Thus, Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 exert distinct effects on cytoskeletal arrangement, thereby controlling cell morphology and essential physiological functions as adhesion, cell division, cell motility, and cytokinesis (6.Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar, 7.Kaibuchi K. Kuroda S. Amano M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 459-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Evidence has been gathered that Rho family GTPases and PI(4,5)P2 may be connected in common signaling pathways, and that the major PI(4,5)P2-generating enzyme, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase (PI4P 5-kinase) is a downstream target of Rho proteins. In mouse fibroblast lysates, addition of recombinant RhoA stimulated PI4P 5-kinase activity (8.Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), and a physical association between RhoA and PI4P 5-kinase was observed (9.Ren X.-D. Bokoch G.M.

In permeabilized platelets, a constitutively actice Rac mutant was able to uncap actin filaments by a PI(4,5)P2-dependent mechanism and to induce PI(4,5)P2 synthesis (11.Hartwig J.H. Bokoch G.M.

Recently, we have shown that treatment of cells with toxin B from Clostridium difficile, that specifically inactivates Rho family GTPases (12.Just I. Selzer J. Wilm M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Mann M. Aktories K. Nature. 1995; 375: 500-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar), resulted in the reduction of cellular PI(4,5)P2 levels by 50–90%, accompanied by profound changes in cell morphology (13.Schmidt M.

Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase; also designated as ROKα and ROCK-II) was shown to mimic the effects of RhoA on the cytoskeleton by inducing the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesions (23.Amano M.

Rho-kinase activated myosin, and hence stimulated the assembly of myosin-actin filaments, both by directly phosphorylating the myosin light chain itself (25.Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y.

Also the NHE1 Na+/H+ exchanger, another downstream target of RhoA linked with cytoskeletal rearrangement, was phosphorylated and activated by Rho-kinase (27.Tominaga T. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Barber D.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4712-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Recently, we observed a role for Rho-kinase in phospholipid signaling, as Rho-kinase potentiated the stimulation of PLD by the m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor in HEK-293 cells (28.Schmidt M.

As Rho-kinase is mediating signals from Rho to the actin cytoskeleton and as the formation of the actin assembly inducing phospholipid PI(4,5)P2 has been shown to be regulated by Rho family proteins, we examined whether Rho-kinase can modulate the synthesis of PI(4,5)P2. Here we show that RhoA stimulated PI4P 5-kinase activity, resulting in enhanced cellular PI(4,5)P2 levels in HEK-293 cells. Furthermore, Rho-kinase was found to regulate PI4P 5-kinase in a Rho-dependent manner. These results implicate a role for Rho-kinase in the Rho-controlled synthesis of PI(4,5)P2 and identify a further contribution of Rho-kinase to phospholipid metabolism. myo-[3H]Inositol (10–25 Ci/mmol),d-myo-[3H]Ins(1,4,5)P3(15–30 Ci/mmol), and [γ-32P]ATP (>6000 Ci/mmol) were from NEN Life Science Products. Unlabeledd-myo-Ins(1,4,5)P3 was from BIOMOL (Hamburg, Germany).l-α-Phosphatidyl-d-myo-inositol-4-phosphate and GTPγS were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, andl-α-phosphatidyl-l-serine (dipalmitoyl) was from Sigma. HA-1077 was obtained from Calbiochem. HEK-293 cells were routinely passaged in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium with 10% fetal calf serum (29.Schmidt M. Hüwe S.M. Fasselt B. Homann D.

Oka, was cloned into the pCMV vector. Subconfluent monolayers in 145-mm culture dishes were transfected with the indicated amounts of DNA using the calcium phosphate method (32.Winstel R. Freund S. Krasel C. Hoppe E. Lohse M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2105-2109Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiency of the HEK-293 cells was determined by in situ screening of β-galactosidase-positive cells in monolayers co-transfected with constitutively active pSVβ-gal (Promega), and appeared to range between 50 and 80%. Assays were performed 48 or 72 h after transfection. The cDNA encoding human RhoA was cloned into pAcGHLT baculovirus transfer vector (Pharmingen), and the cDNA encoding the catalytic fragment of Rho-kinase was inserted into the pAcGLT vector (25.Amano M.

Sf9 cells were infected for 48 h at 25 °C. Thereafter, the cells were lysed by sonication in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 1 h at 20,000 × g, and the supernatants, containing GST-RhoA or GST-Rho-kinase-CAT, were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 min at 4 °C. After washing the beads three times, RhoA or Rho-kinase-CAT proteins were released from the bound glutathioneS-transferase fusion constructs by overnight incubation with thrombin (10 units) in 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The beads were removed by centrifugation, and thrombin was inactivated by treatment withp-aminobenzamidine beads. Protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford method. The recombinant protein preparations were analyzed for their homogeneity by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining, and were found to contain essentially only one band. For determination of phosphoinositide levels, cells were replated in poly-l-lysine-treated 60-mm culture dishes 24 h after transfection, and labeled withmyo-[3H]inositol (0.5 μCi/ml) in inositol-free medium for 24 h. The monolayers were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped in 1.5 ml of cold 2.4n HCl. Phase separation was performed by addition of 5 ml of chloroform/methanol/concentrated HCl (200:100:0.75, v/v) and centrifugation for 10 min at 2,000 × g. The lipid phase was vacuum dried, resuspended in chloroform, and spotted on Silica Gel 60 TLC plates (Merck), impregnated with 1.2% potassium oxalate. The plates were chromatographed for 2 h in chloroform, methanol, 2.5 n ammonium hydroxide (9:7:2, v/v). Authentic phosphoinositide standards were visualized by staining with iodine vapor, and the area corresponding to PI(4,5)P2 was scraped into vials, and the radioactivity measured by liquid scintillation counting. The amount of PI(4,5)P2 was normalized for protein content. Unlabeled cells were replated in poly-l-lysine-treated 35-mm culture dishes 24 h after transfection, and cultured for another 24 h. Monolayers were extracted with 0.5 m trichloroacetic acid to remove soluble inositol phosphates and the remaining membrane lipids were assayed for PI(4,5)P2 as described by Chilverset al. (33.Chilvers E.R. Batty I.H. Challiss R.A.J. Barnes P.J. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, lipids were extracted with acidified chloroform/methanol and hydrolyzed with 1 m KOH at 100 °C for 15 min. Samples were desalted and neutralized by filtration through Dowex-50 columns (Bio-Rad), and Ins(1,4,5)P3 in the eluate was measured by a radioreceptor assay, based on the bovine adrenal cortical Ins(1,4,5)P3-binding protein (33.Chilvers E.R. Batty I.H. Challiss R.A.J. Barnes P.J. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). PI4P 5-kinase activity was determined essentially according to Chong et al. (8.Chong L.D. Traynor-Kaplan A. Bokoch G.M. Schwartz M.A. Cell. 1994; 79: 507-513Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Cells were collected, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, and extracted in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol), supplemented with 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. The lysates were then diluted 1:10 with kinase buffer to reduce the Nonidet P-40 concentration to 0.1%. Typically, kinase assays were performed in a reaction volume of 50 μl containing 50 μg of protein. Samples were mixed with 5 μl of a sonicated solution of phospholipid (70 μm PI4P and 35 μmphosphatidylserine, final concentrations) and preincubated for 15 min at 25 °C with additional compounds as indicated. Reactions were started by the addition of 20 μm[γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi/assay). After 5 min (or the time indicated in the figure legend), the reactions were stopped by adding 0.3 ml of methanol, 1 n HCl (1:1, v/v) and extracted with 0.25 ml of chloroform. The organic layer was dried, resuspended in chloroform, and chromatographed on oxalate-pretreated Silica Gel 60 plates as described above. The reaction products were visualized by autoradiography and identified by comparison with unlabeled standards. The appropriate regions of the TLC plates were scraped, and the radioactivity quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Extracted lipid products of the PI4P kinase assay were deacylated as described (34.Gehrmann T. Gülkan H. Suer S. Herberg F.W. Balla A. Vereb G. Mayr G.W. Heilmeyer Jr., L.M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1437: 341-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), using monomethylamine instead of ethanolamine. The products were mixed with glycerophosphoinositol phosphate standards, and analyzed by HPLC on a Mini Q PC 3.2/3 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with on-line metal-dye-detection (MDD-HPLC) as described (35.Mayr G.W. Irvine R.F. Methods in Inositide Research. Raven Press, New York1990: 83-108Google Scholar). We previously demonstrated that intoxication of HEK-293 cells with toxin B from C. difficile resulted in a decrease of cellular PI(4,5)P2 levels, indicating that members of the Rho GTPase family are positively involved in the regulation of PI(4,5)P2 synthesis (13.Schmidt M. Bienek C. Rümenapp U. Zhang C. Lümmen G. Jakobs K.H. Just I. Aktories K. Moos M. von Eichel-Streiber C. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1996; 354: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 36.Rümenapp U. Schmidt M. Olesch S. Ott S. von Eichel-Streiber C. Jakobs K.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 625-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined whether Rho itself could mediate a change in PI(4,5)P2 levels. Transfection of HEK-293 cells with RhoA resulted in an increase in cellular PI(4,5)P2 levels (Fig.1 A). In cells transfected with 100 μg of RhoA DNA, the increase was about 50% compared with mock-transfected cells. On the other hand, transfection of cells with C3 transferase, that specifically ADP-ribosylates and thereby inactivates Rho, but not Rac or Cdc42, resulted in a decrease of cellular PI(4,5)P2 levels, by about 40% at 100 μg of C3 DNA (Fig. 1 B). No differences in total phosphoinositide labeling was observed in cells transfected with either RhoA or C3 transferase (data not shown). These data indicated that RhoA positively regulated the cellular pool of PI(4,5)P2. The major cellular pathway for the generation of PI(4,5)P2 is the phosphorylation of PI4P on the D-5 position of the inositol ring by PI4P 5-kinase (1.Toker A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). We next examined whether RhoA enhanced PI(4,5)P2 levels in HEK-293 cells by stimulating the activity of PI4P 5-kinase. Lysates of cells transfected with either RhoA or C3 transferase were assayed for in vitro PI4P 5-kinase activity, using PI4P and [γ-32P]ATP as substrates. PI4P 5-kinase activity was clearly elevated in lysates from RhoA-overexpressing cells (Fig.2 A). The stimulatory effect of RhoA was even more pronounced when the lysates were preincubated with GTPγS. In contrast, in lysates from C3 transferase-expressing cells, [32P]PI(4,5)P2 formation was reduced by about 50% (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, the stimulation of PI4P 5-kinase activity by GTPγS was abolished in lysates from C3-expressing cells. To substantiate the stimulating effect of RhoA on PI4P 5-kinase activity, we performed the in vitro kinase assay in the presence of purified recombinant RhoA. RhoA concentration dependence stimulated PI4P 5-kinase activity up to 2-fold (Fig.3 A). The formation of [32P]PI(4,5)P2 appeared to be linear for at least 20 min, both in the absence and presence of RhoA (Fig.3 B). The stimulatory effect of recombinant RhoA was judged to be specific, as a non-relevant protein produced and purified by identical procedures had no effect on PI4P 5-kinase activity.Figure 3Stimulation of PI4P 5-kinase by recombinant RhoA. A, cell lysates (50 μg) were preincubated with increasing amounts of purified recombinant RhoA in the presence of 100 μm GTPγS for 15 min before PI4P 5-kinase activity was measured for 5 min. Results are expressed as percent of control (buffer with GTPγS) and represent mean ± S.D. for three experiments. PI4P 5-kinase activity in the absence of RhoA amounted to 5.11 ± 0.64 pmol of PI(4,5)P2/min/mg of protein. The upper panel illustrates an original autoradiogram. B, after preincubation of the lysates with 100 μm GTPγS in the absence (●) or presence (○) of 12 μm recombinant RhoA for 15 min, PI4P phosphorylation was measured for increasing time intervals. Data are expressed as picomole of PI(4,5)P2/mg of protein and are mean ± S.D. for triplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) All in vitro phosphorylation reactions were performed in the presence of 0.1% Nonidet P-40 that completely prevented the generation of the interfering product PI(3,4)P2 by PI 3-kinases. Thus, using PI(4,5)P2 as a substrate, no PI 3-kinase activity could be detected under these assay conditions and the RhoA-stimulated production of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate from PI4P was insensitive to the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (data not shown). To obtain final proof, the phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate reaction product generated in the presence of RhoA was deacylated and identified by HPLC analysis with on-line metal dye-detection. The product proved to be exclusively PI(4,5)P2 based on comigration with a glycerophosphoinositol(4,5)P2 standard (Fig.4). The serine/threonine kinase Rho-kinase has been recognized as an important downstream effector of RhoA. Recently, we provided evidence for the implication of Rho-kinase in the Rho-controlled PLD stimulation by the m3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (28.Schmidt M. Voß M. Oude Weernink P.A. Wetzel J. Amano M. Kaibuchi K. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14648-14654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The newly identified involvement of Rho-kinase in phospholipid signaling prompted us to investigate whether Rho-kinase also takes part in the Rho-controlled stimulation of PI4P 5-kinase. Cells were transfected with different Rho-kinase constructs, and after 48 h the cells were lysed and assayed for PI4P 5-kinase activity. Overexpression of the wild-type Rho-kinase resulted in a clear increase in PI4P 5-kinase activity (Fig. 5). Overexpression of the constitutively active Rho-kinase-CAT was even more effective. Transfection of HEK-293 cells with 25 and 50 μg of Rho-kinase-CAT DNA increased the PI4P 5-kinase activity by 43 and 64%, respectively (Fig.5). No stimulating effect on PI4P 5-kinase activity was observed in lysates from cells that had been transfected with the kinase-deficient mutant, Rho-kinase-CAT-KD. To investigate whether the stimulatory effect of Rho-kinase on PI4P 5-kinase activity was under the control of Rho, cells were co-transfected with Rho-kinase constructs and C3 transferase. The stimulatory effect of wild-type Rho-kinase could be completely abolished by coexpression of C3 transferase, indicating that the transfected Rho-kinase was under the control of endogenous Rho (Fig.6 A, left panel). As Rho-kinase-CAT DNA encodes the constitutively active catalytic domain of Rho-kinase, it was anticipated that the stimulatory effect of this construct on PI4P 5-kinase was independent of endogenous Rho. Indeed, coexpression of C3 transferase did not prevent the increased [32P]PI(4,5)P2 production induced by Rho-kinase-CAT (Fig. 6 A, right panel). As commercial PI4P might be contaminated with minor amounts of PI5P, the Rho-kinase-driven generation of PI(4,5)P2 could theoretically be mediated by a 4-kinase rather than a 5-kinase. To exclude this possibility, cells were co-transfected with the recently cloned PI4P 5-kinase β (31.Ishihara H. Shibasaki Y. Kizuki N. Katagiri H. Yazaki Y. Asano T. Oka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23611-23614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In cells expressing the PI4P 5-kinase isoform, stimulation of PI(4,5)P2 generation by the Rho-kinases was dramatically (10–50-fold over basal) potentiated (Fig.6 B). Again, the stimulating effect of wild-type Rho-kinase, but not of Rho-kinase-CAT, was largely prevented by C3 transferase. These data consolidate the identification of PI4P 5-kinase as the responsible target of Rho-kinase. The stimulation of PI4P 5-kinase by Rho-kinase was further studied using recombinant Rho-kinase-CAT. The functionality of the purified kinase was confirmed by its ability to phosphorylate myosin light chain in a cell-free system (data not shown). Addition of purified Rho-kinase-CAT potently and concentration dependence increased the PI4P 5-kinase activity in cell lysates (Fig.7). The stimulation was up to 3-fold at the highest Rho-kinase-CAT concentration. The effect of Rho-kinase-CAT was not restricted to HEK-293 cell lysates, as stimulation of PI4P 5-kinase was also observed in bovine brain homogenates (data not shown). No phosphorylation of PI4P was observed in the absence of cell lysates, indicating that Rho-kinase-CAT had apparently no direct lipid kinase activity (data not shown). As Rho-kinase was shown to enhance the in vitro PI4P 5-kinase activity, we examined whether Rho-kinase affected the cellular level of PI(4,5)P2. Transfection of cells with Rho-kinase constructs indeed resulted in an increase in cellular PI(4,5)P2 (Fig.8). Wild-type Rho-kinase elevated the PI(4,5)P2 level by about 40% and Rho-kinase-CAT by about 60%. Very similar as shown above for the PI4P 5-kinase activity, co-transfection with C3 transferase prevented the increase in PI(4,5)P2 induced by wild-type Rho-kinase, but did not affect the increase by Rho-kinase-CAT. To substantiate the observed changes in PI(4,5)P2 levels in metabolically labeled cells, PI(4,5)P2 masses were additionally determined by a radioreceptor assay. In control, mock-transfected cells PI(4,5)P2 mass amounted to 103 ± 28 pmol/mg of protein (mean ± S.E. for four experiments). In cells transfected with Rho-kinase constructs, PI(4,5)P2 mass was increased to 248 ± 56 pmol/mg (100 μg of Rho-kinase DNA) and 292 ± 67 pmol/mg (50 μg of Rho-kinase-CAT DNA). Recently, the anti-vasospastic compound HA-1077 has been reported to be an ATP-competitive Rho-kinase inhibitor (37.Asano T. Ikegaki I. Satoh S.-i. Seto M. Sasaki Y. Cardiovasc.

Indeed, we found that Rho-kinase-CAT-induced protein phosphorylation in HEK-293 lysates was specifically and completely inhibited by HA-1077, without appreciably affecting the basal phosphorylation pattern (data not shown). The IC50 for this inhibition was determined to be about 0.6 μm, which fits well with the reportedK i for Rho-kinase of 0.33 μm (38.Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T.

We have previously cloned a cDNA encoding an organic anion transporter from mouse kidney (mOAT) (Lopez-Nieto, C. E., You, G., Bush, K. T., Barros, E. J. G., Beier, D. R., and Nigam, S. K. (1997)J.

In the present study, we assessed the potential for regulation of this transporter by heterologous expression of mOAT in the pig proximal tubule-like cell line, LLC-PK1. We report here that both protein phosphatase (PP1/PP2A) inhibitor, okadaic acid, and protein kinase C (PKC) activators down-regulate mOAT-mediated transport of para-aminohippuric acid (PAH), a prototypic organic anion, in a time- and concentrationdependent manner. However their mechanisms of action for this down-regulation are distinct. Okadaic acid modulated PAH transport, at least in part, through phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of mOAT; phosphoamino acid analysis indicated this phosphorylation occurs on serine. In contrast, PKC activation induced a decrease in the maximum transport velocity (V max) of PAH transport without direct phosphorylation of the transporter protein. Together these results provide the first demonstration that regulation of organic anion transport by mOAT is likely to be tightly controlled directly and indirectly by phosphatase PP1/PP2A and PKC. Our results also suggest that kinases other than PKC are involved in this process.

The transport mechanisms responsible for this elimination have been extensively studied (3.Pritchard J.B. Miller D.S. Phys.

Based on these studies, it has been suggested that the transport of organic anions is a complex process involving distinctly different proteins at the apical and basolateral membranes of the proximal tubule cells. Organic anions are transported across the basolateral membrane into the cell in exchange for intracellular dicarboxylates, which are subsequently returned into the cell via a sodium-dependent dicarboxylate transporter. Once inside the cell, organic anions are subject to intracellular binding and sequestration within vesicular structures. Finally, luminal exit is thought to occur by anion exchange and/or facilitated diffusion (3.Pritchard J.B. Miller D.S. Phys.

Using computer modeling based on hydropathy analysis, the predicted proteins share several common features, including 12 putative membrane-spanning segments, a cluster of potential glycosylation sites located in the first extracellular loop between transmembrane domains 1 and 2, and multiple presumptive phosphorylation sites. Recent progress from our laboratory on the study of structure/function relationships in mOAT1 using heterologous expression systems has shown that histidine residues are important for the transport function, and glycosylation is necessary for the targeting of mOAT to the plasma membrane (2.Kuze K. Graves P. Leahy A. Wilson P. Stuhlmann H. You G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1519-1524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The presence of potential phosphorylation sites on these proteins suggests that they may be subject to phosphorylation-induced functional regulation, and several studies have indicated that transport of organic anions is affected by PKC activators (9.Lu R. Chan B.S. Schuster V.L. Am J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F295-F303PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Hohage H. Lohr M. Querl U. Greven J. J. Pharmacol. Exp.

In this report we provide the first evidence that the phosphatase inhibitor, okadaic acid, and PKC activators both modulate mOAT-mediated transport function. However, their mechanisms of action are distinct. Okadaic acid regulates the transport, at least in part, through the phosphorylation of serine residue(s) of mOAT, whereas PKC modulates the transport function by changing the maximum transport velocity without direct phosphorylation of the tranporter protein. We also suggest that kinases other than PKC are involved in the regulation of organic anion transport. [32P]Orthophosphate was obtained from ICN. Protease inhibitor complex was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Protein A-agarose beads were from Life Technologies, Inc. Phosphoamino acid standards (Ser(P), Thr(P), and Tyr(P)) were from Sigma. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu), 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4α-PDD), 1-oleoyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol (OAG), and indolactam were also purchased from Sigma. Full-length cDNA encoding mOAT with the c-myc epitope tag, was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(−). The epitope-tagged constructs encoded a fusion protein consisting of full-length mOAT with 10 amino acids of the human c-Myc epitope (EQKLISEEDL, nucleotide sequence GAACAAAAGCTGATTTCTGAAGAAGACCTG) at the carboxyl terminus. Tagged mOAT cDNA was synthesized by polymerase chain reaction amplification. The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into the plasmid pcDNA3.1(−) at XbaI and HindIII sites. The nucleotide sequence was confirmed by the dideoxy chain-termination sequencing method (16.Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52610) Google Scholar). LLC-PK1 cells purchased from the American Type Culture Collection were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, in a 5% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. LLC-PK1 cells were seeded at 1 × 106/100-mm dish/10 ml of complete medium 24 h before transfection. For transfection a DNA-calcium phosphate precipitate (1 ml) formed with 20 μg in total of plasmid DNA was added and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h, washed, and incubated further. After 14–20 days of selection in medium containing 2 mg/ml Geneticin (G418; Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's instruction, resistant colonies were replated to 96 wells for cloning, expanded, and used for analyzing positive clones. LLC-PK1 cells expressing mOAT or mOAT-myc established above were maintained in complete medium consisting of DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Monolayers were grown under an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C, and were subcultured every 2–3 days using 0.02% EDTA and 0.05% trypsin. For the transport assay, confluent cell monolayers were cultured in Transwell chambers (0.4-μm pores) in 12-well plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA). The volume of medium inside and outside the chambers was 0.5 and 1.5 ml, respectively. Uptake of [14C]PAH was initiated by adding uptake solution (PBS, pH 7, containing 5 mm glucose and [14C]PAH) to either the basal or apical side of the monolayers. At times as indicated in the figure legends, the uptake was stopped by rapidly washing the cells with ice-cold PBS. The cells were then solubilized in 0.2 n NaOH and aliquoted for liquid scintillation counting. Uptake count was standardized by the amount of protein in each well. Values were mean ± S.E. (n = 3). Five μg of total RNA prepared from stable transfectant clones was electrophoresed on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membrane was hybridized at 42 °C overnight in hybridization solution with full-length mOAT cDNA labeled with [32P]dCTP by random primer labeling, followed by purification using a Sephadex G-50 spin-column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The filter was washed in 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C and subjected to autoradiography. Cells grown on a 100-mm dish were homogenized in isolation solution (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.6) containing complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Crude membranes were obtained by centrifuging at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, discarding the pellet, and centrifuging the supernatant at 17,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in isolation solution plus protease inhibitors. Protein samples were loaded (20 μg/lane) on 7.5% SDS-PAGE minigels and electrophoresed using a mini cell (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes in an electroelution cell (Bio-Rad). The blots were blocked for 1 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS-Tween (80 mmNa2HPO4, 20 mmNaH2PO4,100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.5), washed, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (1:400). The membranes were washed, incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:5000), and signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham). Cells were examined using a Leica TCS-SP (UV) confocal laser scanning microscope (Heidelberg, Germany) equipped with a 100 × 1.4 numeric aperture objective lens. The pinhole size was adjusted such that resultant “optical sections” were approximately 0.5 μm in thickness. Images were collected in the xy plane (from serial optical sections generated at 0.5-μm intervals from the top to the bottom of the cells) or in the xz plane. The sensitivity of the photomultiplier detectors was set such that the intensity levels of the output signal in the plane of maximum fluorescence intensity were distributed in a linear fashion (via a glow over/under lookup table) over 256 gray levels (with the dimmest pixel, black = 0 and the brightest pixel, white = 255). For control studies (in which the primary antibody was omitted), the detector settings were maintained at the values used in the studies in which primary antibody was present. Stably transfected LLC-PK1 cells were seeded on six-well plates. (approximately 2 × 106/well). The cells were washed once with phosphate-free DMEM without serum or antibiotics and incubated with 2 ml of this medium at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were labeled by addition of 25 μl of 2 mCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate (50 μCi/well/ml) and incubated for 3 h at 37 °C. Okadaic acid or PKC activators at various concentrations (see figure legends) were added to the medium, and the incubation was continued at 37 °C. The treated cells were washed once with ice-cold PBS. 400 μl of ice-cold RIPA buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors was added, and the cells were lysed. RIPA buffer consisted of 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, pH 7.4, with the protease inhibitor complex, and phosphatase inhibitors: 10 mm sodium fluoride and 1 μm okadaic acid. The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was precleaned with 100 μl of protein A-agarose beads for 1 h with shaking at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged at 200 ×g for 1 min, and the supernatant was incubated with 3 μl of anti-myc monoclonal antibody at 4 °C overnight, with end-over-end continuous mixing. Then, 20 μl of protein A-agarose beads were added and the lysate was agitated for 1 h at 4 °C. The lysate was centrifuged at 200 × g for 1 min, and the pellet was washed with 400 μl of ice-cold RIPA buffer several times. The pellet was suspended in 60 μl of Laemmli buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The samples were boiled for 5 min and loaded onto 7.5% SDS-PAGE mini gels. The gel was fixed with 10% acetic acid and 50% methanol for 40 min and dried with a vacuum gel drier at 70 °C for 3 h. The radiolabeled proteins were detected and quantified using a PhosphorImager. The conditions for acid hydrolysis and thin layer separation are taken from Boyle et al. (17.Boyle W.J. Van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). In vitro phosphorylation of mOAT was done as described above. The 32P-labeled protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF. The radiolabeled protein was located by autoradiography, the band excised, and acid hydrolysis in 6n HCl was done for 90 min at 120 °C. The PVDF was removed and the hydrolysate dried in vacuo. The sample was redissolved in 10 μl of pH 3.5 buffer containing unlabeled phosphoamino acid standards (Ser(P), Thr(P), and Tyr(P)), and 8 μl were spotted on a 20 × 20-cm cellulose thin layer plate. Phosphoamino acids were resolved by two-dimensional high voltage electrophoresis, for 35 min at 1.2 kV in pH 3.5 buffer, and after drying the plate, for 25 min at 1.0 kV in pH 1.9 buffer. The standards were visualized with ninhydrin (Pierce) and the [32P]phosphoamino acids by autoradiography with a PhosphorImager. To make stable mOAT-expressing clones in LLC-PK1 cells, we cloned the cDNAs, encoding mOAT and mOAT tagged with a carboxyl-terminal c-Myc epitope, behind the cytomegalovirus promoter in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1(−), which contains the neo gene for selection with G418. After 2 weeks of selection, 5 clones were obtained from cell populations transfected with the control plasmid (vector alone), 17 clones were obtained from populations transfected pcDNA3.1(−)-mOAT plasmid, and 23 clones were obtained from populations transfected with pcDNA3.1(−)-mOAT-myc plasmid. Preliminary studies measured [14C]PAH uptake in clones of mOAT-expressing and mOAT-myc-expressing cells (data not shown). Clones exhibiting high levels of uptake were chosen for further studies. Northern blot analysis (Fig. 1 a) using full-length mOAT cDNA as probe confirmed that clones exhibiting high levels of PAH uptake contained high level of mOAT transcript (lanes 2 and 3), whereas mOAT transcript was not detected in LLC-PK1 cells transfected with vector alone (lane 1). To confirm that these clones expressed high levels of mOAT protein, Western blot studies were performed using crude membrane preparations derived from vector-transfected (control) or mOAT-myc-transfected cells. As shown in Fig. 1 b, membrane proteins derived from vector-transfected cells exhibited no reactivity with the c-myc antibody (lane 1), as expected, but membrane proteins derived from cells transfected with mOAT-myc cDNA expressed a c-myc antibody-reactive protein at about 60 kDa (lane 2), consistent with the predicted molecular mass for mOAT (1.Lopez-Nieto C.E.

We next examined the localization of mOAT transporter in polarized LLC-PK1 cells. At confluence, LLC-PK1 cells form an epithelium with separate apical and basolateral membrane domains containing different complements of membrane proteins (30.Brown D. Stow J.L. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 245-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The mOAT transporter in vivo is expressed exclusively at the basolateral membrane (31.Sweet D.H. Miller D.S. Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F864-F873PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Tojo A. Sekine T. Nakajima N. Hosoyamada M. Kanai Y. Kimura K. Endou H. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 464-471Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The uptake of PAH from either the basal or the apical side was measured in confluent monolayers of cells transfected with vector alone, mOAT, mOAT-myc. Cells were grown on permeable membrane filter supports to provide independent access to either the apical or the basolateral membrane. As shown in Fig.2 a, 20-min uptake of14C-labeled PAH from the basal side was about 5-fold higher than that from apical side into cells transfected with mOAT or mOAT-myc, whereas little uptake was observed in vector alone-transfected cells. Therefore, mOAT and mOAT-myc were functionally expressed primarily on the basolateral membrane of polarized LLC-PK1 cells. The time course for [14C]PAH uptake at the basolateral surface was compared in vector-transfected and mOAT-myc-transfected cells (Fig. 2 b). As expected, uptake was markedly faster into mOAT-myc-expressing cells. In mOAT-myc-expressing cells, uptake increased linearly for approximately 2 min and reached a steady state between 5 and 10 min. Therefore, an uptake period of 1 min (initial rate) was chosen for future studies. To confirm the functional polarization of mOAT at the protein level, we examined the cellular distribution of mOAT protein by confocal microscopy, a procedure that is independent of transporter activity. Previous studies from our laboratory showed that the mOAT-myc protein retained the functional properties of the native (unmodified) structure (2.Kuze K. Graves P. Leahy A. Wilson P. Stuhlmann H. You G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1519-1524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Our current study (Figs. 1 and 2) confirmed these results. Therefore, the mOAT-myc-transfected cells were chosen for these studies. mOAT-myc-transfected and vector-transfected LLC-PK1 cells were grown to confluence, and mOAT protein was visualized by indirect immunolocalization using confocal laser scanning microscopy (Fig. 3). A top view of the epithelial cell layer showed a clear staining of the plasma membrane of the LLC-PK1-mOAT-myc cells with anti-myc antibody (Fig. 3 a), whereas the vector-transfected LLC-PK1 cells showed no detectable labeling (Fig.3 b). Examination of the mOAT-myc-tranfected cells at the plane parallel to the permeable filter revealed that the strongest immunostaining was confined to the lateral membrane (Fig.3 d) as compared with the basal membrane (Fig.3 e), whereas the apical membrane exhibited only a weak immunoreactivity (Fig. 3 c). Consistent with this result, thex-z analysis (Fig. 3 f) showed that, although the apical side was weakly stained, the majority of the immunostaining signal was localized to the basolateral sides. Since the basolateral membrane is the in vivo site of mOAT function, we have focused on the uptake studies at this surface. SDS-PAGE and autoradiography of immunoprecipitates after metabolic labeling with [32P]orthophosphate of LLC-PK1 cells expressing mOAT-myc (Fig.4) revealed that incubation with 1 μm okadaic acid for 3 h significantly increased the intensity of a band centered at ∼60 kDa (lane 2), the size expected from the estimated molecular mass for mOAT. The 60-kDa species is absent from immunoprecipitates of cells transfected with pcDNA vector (lane 1) and had received the same treatment in parallel. Together, these findings support the conclusion that mOAT protein is a target for direct phosphorylation by endogenous protein kinases and phosphatases in stably transfected LLC-PK1 cells. We determined the amount of [32P]phosphate incorporation into mOAT as a function of time. As shown in Fig. 5 (aand b), treatment of LLC-PK1 cells with 1 μm okadaic acid induced a time-dependent augmentation of mOAT phosphorylation. To determine the functional consequences of phosphorylation, basolateral PAH transport rate was measured in parallel. The elevation in mOAT phosphorylation induced by okadaic acid displays a similar time course to the okadaic acid-induced down-regulation of [14C]PAH transport (Fig.5 c). We then determined the amount of [32P]phosphate incorporation into mOAT as a function of dose. As shown in Fig.6 (a and b), the phosphorylation level of mOAT was elevated with the increase in okadaic acid concentration. Furthermore, the dose response of phosphorylation of mOAT correlated closely with the dose response of okadaic acid-induced down-regulation of [14C]PAH transport (Fig.6 c). To determine the nature of the phosphorylated residues, we performed phosphoamino acid analysis of mOAT metabolically labeled with32P in LLC-PK1 cells and immunoprecipitated with anti-myc antibody. Our results showed that phosphorylation of mOAT occurred on one (or more) serine residues, with little phosphothreonine and no phosphotyrosine detected (Fig.7). Previous studies have implicated that organic anion transport may be regulated by PKC (9.Lu R. Chan B.S. Schuster V.L. Am J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F295-F303PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Hohage H. Lohr M.

Physiol. 1998; 274: F156-F164PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether PKC modulates mOAT function, we treated the mOAT-myc-expressing LLC-PK1 cells with the PKC activator, PMA. Our results showed that, when cell monolayers were treated with 0.1 μm PMA for 3 h, the mOAT-mediated PAH transport was decreased by 50% of that of untreated monolayers (Fig.8 a). This PMA- induced inhibition was time- and concentration-dependent (Fig. 8,b and c). To clarify the involvement of PKC in the regulation of PAH transport, the effect of various PKC activators on the basolateral PAH transport was studied (Fig. 9). Like PMA, PDBu (the active phorbol ester) and OAG and indolactam (the non-phorbol ester PKC activators) inhibited the PAH uptake. In contrast, 4α-PDD (the inactive phorbol ester that has no effect on PKC) did not affect PAH uptake (Fig. 9 a). Staurosporine, a potent inhibitor of PKC, blocked the inhibitory effect by PMA (Fig. 9 b). We then ask whether PKC-dependent inhibition of PAH transport by PMA also occurs, like okadaic acid, via phosphorylation of mOAT. To answer this question, LLC-PK1 cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate using the same experimental conditions that we used for okadaic acid-induced phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 10(a and b), no phosphorylated mOAT was detected in the presence of various PKC activators. These results suggest that it is unlikely that phosphorylation of mOAT is responsible for PKC-dependent inhibition of PAH transport. To further examine the mechanism of the PMA-induced down-regulation of PAH transport, we determined [14C]PAH uptake at different substrate concentrations. An Eadie-Hofstee analysis of the derived data (Fig. 11) showed that pretreatment with PMA resulted in a decreased V max (2.0 ± 0.1 pmol/μg·min with untreated cells, and 1.1 ± 0.1 pmol/μg·min in the presence of PMA) with no significant change in the affinity for PAH (162 ± 25 μm with untreated cells, and 123 ± 19 μm in the presence of PMA). Determination of the protein concentrations in control wells confirmed that PMA treatment did not change the total protein content of the cultures (data not shown). To assess the potential involvement of reversible phosphorylation for regulation of PAH transport mediated by mOAT, we have studied the effects of okadaic acid and PKC activators in this process using a heterologous expression system, the pig proximal tubule-like cell line, LLC-PK1. LLC-PK1 cells offer several useful advantages for study of the cloned organic anion transporter. 1) They have many characteristics of proximal renal tubules and have been very useful in understanding other renal epithelial transport processes and cellular functions, including organic cation transport (18.Grundemann D. Babin-Ebell J. Martel F. Ording N. Schmidt A. Schomig E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10408-10413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). 2) This cell line does not express endogenous PAH transporter (19.Hori R. Okamura M. Takayama A. Hirozane K. Takano M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F975-F980PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, expression of mOAT in LLC-PK1 cells will allow us to dissect the transport characteristics of mOAT in a relevant mammalian system without the possibly confounding effects of other organic anion transporters. 3) They possess endogenous PKC and PKA signaling pathways and provide a good experimental model system for studying the regulatory mechanisms involving phosphorylation of many transport process (20.Katsura T. Verbavatz J-M. Farinas J. Ma T. Ausiello D.A. Verkman A.S. Brown D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7212-7216Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 21.Huff R.A. Vaughan R.A. Kuhar M.J. Uhl G.R. Neurochemistry. 1997; 68: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Evidence presented in this study indicated mOAT was predominantly routed to the basolateral membrane of polarized LLC-PK1 cells. In accordance with this localization, substantial mOAT-dependent PAH uptake was detected at the basolateral surface. This is in agreement with its physiological role as a basolateral organic anion transporter. Okadaic acid is a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 and protein phosphatase 2A, two of the four major serine/threonine protein phosphatases in the cytosol of mammalian cells (22.Cohen P. Holmes C.F. Tsukitani Y. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 98-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). Okadaic acid readily enters cells, and numerous studies have demonstrated that it enhances the phosphorylation of many cellular proteins (23.Baggio B. Bordin L. Clari G. Gambaro G. Moret V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1148: 157-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 24.Lawrence Jr., J.C. Hiken J.F. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19768-19776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), presumably by preventing dephosphorylation. In this report, we showed that okadaic acid significantly increased the phosphorylation level of mOAT and this phosphorylation paralleled in time and concentration the decrease of basolateral PAH transport activity. Phosphoamino acid analysis indicated that phosphorylation occurred primarily on serine residues. These results suggest that the increase in serine phosphorylation of mOAT by okadaic acid is, at least in part, responsible for the okadaic acid-induced decrease in basolateral PAH transport. Many studies indicated that phosphorylation by okadaic acid directly regulates the activity of proteins such as glucose transporter and antidepressant-sensitive serotonin transporter (24.Lawrence Jr., J.C. Hiken J.F. James D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19768-19776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Ramamoorthy S. Giovanetti E. Qian Y. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2458-2466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). In other cases, okadaic acid acts synergistically with the stimulation of protein kinases. For example, okadaic acid potentiates the phosphorylation of renal Na+,K+-ATPase by PKC (26.Li D. Cheng S.X.J. Fisone G. Caplan M.J. Ohtomo Y. Aperia A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: 863-869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Evidence has accumulated to indicate that PKC is involved in organic anion transport process (9.Lu R. Chan B.S. Schuster V.L. Am J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F295-F303PubMed Google Scholar, 12.Hohage H. Lohr M. Querl U. Greven J. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1994; 269: 659-664PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Takano M. Nagai J. Yasuhara M. Inui K. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: F469-F475Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14.Nagai J. Yano I. Hashimoto Y. Takano M. Inui K.-I. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F674-F679PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Miller D.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: F156-F164PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we showed that activation of PKC inhibited mOAT-mediated basolateral PAH transport, kinetically revealed as a change inV max. There are several mechanisms by which PKC could modulate PAH transport. PKC-induced direct phosphorylation has been reported (25.Ramamoorthy S. Giovanetti E. Qian Y. Blakely R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2458-2466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 26.Li D. Cheng S.X.J. Fisone G. Caplan M.J. Ohtomo Y. Aperia A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: 863-869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Vaughan R.A. Huff R.A. Uhl G.R. Kuhar M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15541-15546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether PKC activation, like okadaic acid, inhibited PAH transport through direct phosphorylation of mOAT, and if so, whether okadaic acid and PKC have synergistic effects. Our results showed that PMA and other PKC activators failed to elevate the phosphorylation level of mOAT under various experimental conditions (Fig. 10, a and b). This suggests that direct phosphorylation is unlikely to be the cause for PKC-induced inhibition of PAH transport. Alternatively, PKC activation may induce an internalization of membrane transporters and/or inhibit the recruitment of preformed transporters into membrane. Further studies are needed to clarify these possibilities. In conclusion, we have demonstrated for the first time that okadaic acid and PKC activators inhibited mOAT-mediated PAH transport likely through distinct mechanisms; okadaic acid reduced the transport function by inhibiting phosphoserine dephosphorylation of mOAT, whereas PKC activators inhibited PAH transport by decreasing the maximum transport velocity without direct phosphorylation of the transporter protein. Therefore, the activity of renal organic anion transport is partially determined by the balance between the activities of competing serine-threonine kinases, including PKC and at least one other serine-threonine kinase, and serine-threonine phosphatases, including PP1 and PP2A.

Src homology domain 2 formin-binding protein Yes-associated protein polymerase chain reaction gluathioneS-transferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis WW domain-binding protein(s) Many signaling events in eukaryotic cells involve the assembly of large protein-protein complexes. These diverse associations are mediated through interactions of a limited number of modular signaling domains such as the SH2,1SH3, PDZ, and PTB domains and their respective ligands (1.Kuriyan J. Cowburn D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1997; 26: 259-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 2.Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). Particular families of domains occasionally share affinity for related ligands. For example, both SH2 and PTB domains can bind phosphotyrosine-containing substrates, while FHA domains, 14-3-3 proteins, and certain WW domains bind phosphoserine/phosphothreonine-containing proteins (3.Yaffe M.B. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1999; 402: 30-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Recently, several unrelated signaling modules have been identified that specifically recognize proline-rich ligands. These include WW and EVH1 domains in addition to the canonical member of this group, the SH3 domain (4.Niebuhr K. Ebel F. Frank R. Reinhard M. Domann E. Carl U.D. Walter U. Gertler F.B. Wehland J.

WW domains are encoded as 38–40-amino acid long modules in single copy or tandem repeats in over 25 signaling proteins. WW domain-containing proteins include those implicated directly or indirectly in a variety of human diseases such as Liddle's syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, Huntington's disease, and Alzheimer's disease (6.Sudol M.

Named after two highly conserved tryptophan residues characteristically spaced either 22 or 23 residues apart, WW domains participate in a variety of cellular processes, including ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation (10.Staub O.

Recently another WW domain-containing protein, FBP30, was identified as one of the major genes up-regulated by p53 in thymocytes undergoing programmed cell death following γ-irradiation (21.Depraetere V. Golstein P. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Despite their general importance in normal and disease states, most of the molecular targets recognized by different WW domains in vivo remain unidentified. Sudol and colleagues (22.Espanel X. Sudol M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17284-17289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) have proposed a classification of WW domains based on their proline-based ligand specificity. In this scheme, Group I WW domains recognize and bind the motif PPXY, as typified by the prototype WW domain in Yes-associated protein (YAP), whereas Group II WW domains bind a PPLP motif, as observed for the WW domains in formin-binding protein (FBP)-11. A third class of WW domains bind sequences rich in Pro, Gly, and Met residues, although the exact amino acid sequence motif they recognize is not known. A fourth class of WW domain-containing proteins has recently been found that appears to bind Pro residues preceded by phosphoserine (23.Lu P.J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). In the present study we use oriented peptide library screening, phage-expression cloning, peptide binding studies, and protein affinity interactions in cell lysates to identify a new motif that defines and re-classifies a novel group of WW domains that specifically recognize and bind to proline-arginine-rich motifs. The prototype member of this group is the first of two WW domains present within the protein FBP30, the sequence of which is reported here. Other members of the Pro-Arg motif-binding class include the WW domains of FBP21 and FE65 and the second WW domain of FBP30. We present a structural model for WW domains that rationalizes Pro-Arg motif selection, and show that many ligands for this novel class of WW domains also bind to the Src- and phosphoinositol 3-kinase-like family of SH3 domains. A partial cDNA for FBP30 containing the first WW domain (FBP30 WW-A) was obtained by screening a mouse random-primed λ cDNA expression library for formin-binding proteins, as described previously (24.Chan D.C. Bedford M.T. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). To obtain additional FBP30 sequence, a mouse limb bud cDNA expression library (24.Chan D.C. Bedford M.T. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and a NIH3T3 cDNA library cloned into λZap (courtesy of Ari Elson) were screened with the partial cDNA insert of FBP30 obtained above. 5′ Rapid amplification of cDNA ends was employed to obtain a putative start codon using a mouse 11-day embryo library (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and the primers: 5′-gcagtcgaatctgcctcgggatccgg-3′ (first round of PCR) and 5′-cccggtggagagagctgcaggatagg- 3′ (nested PCR). Two expressed sequence tag clones (GenBank accession numbers AA240645 and AA175408) were sequenced to obtain the stop codon and the poly(A) tail. GST fusion proteins containing the isolated FBP30 WW-A, WW-B, or a fusion of the WW-A and -B domains were generated by PCR and subcloned into pGex-2TK. PCR primers for FBP30 WW-A were 5′-atgggatcccattatgacactcagtgttga-3′ and 5′-gctgaattcagcaaggtattggggtaactc-3′, flanked by BamHI andEcoRI sites. PCR primers for FBP30 WW-B were 5′- cttggatccaagcttcaggatgctgcagaa-3′ and 5′-tagggatccctacttcacggtcagcttaggcag-3′, flanked by BamHI sites. The resulting PCR fragment also contains an EcoRI and a HindIII site. The fusion of WW-A and -B domains used the PCR primers 5′-atgaagcttcattatgacactcagtgttga-3′ and 5′-gctaagcttagcaaggtattggggtaactc-3′ flanked by HindIII sites for FBP30 WW-A and the resulting PCR fragment was then cloned into the HindIII site of FBP30 WW-B. The amino acid sequence of FBP30 WW-B fused to GST is: KRKLQDAAEQLKQYEINATPKGWSCHWDRDHRRYFYVNEQSGESQWEFPDGEEEEESQTKEVRDESLPKLTVK. The amino acid sequence of FBP30 WW-A&B fused to GST is: KLHYDTQCSLAGVEIEMGDGDWQEVWDENTGCYYYWNTQTNEVTWELPQYLAKLQDAAEQ-LKQYEINATPKGWSCHWDRDHRRYFYVNEQSGESQWEFPDGEEEEESQTKEVRDESLPKLTVK. The construction of GST fusions containing the SH3 domains from the p85 subunit of phosphoinositol 3-kinase and Fyn has been described previously (24.Chan D.C. Bedford M.T. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 25.Kapeller R. Prasad K.V. Janssen O. Hou W. Schaffhausen B.S. Rudd C.E. Cantley L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1927-1933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids encoding GST fusion proteins of the YAP and FE65 WW domains were the kind gifts of Dr. Marius Sudol. GST fusions were expressed in bacteria and purified as described previously (26.Kaelin Jr., W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F. Fuchs C.S. Chittenden T. Li Y. Farnham P.J. Blanar M.A. Livingston D.M. Flemington E.K. Cell. 1992; 70: 351-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). For peptide binding experiments, fusion proteins were eluted from the beads by incubation with 20 mm glutathione in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, for 30 min at 4 °C. For blot overlay assays, the purified proteins were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using heart muscle kinase (26.Kaelin Jr., W.G. Krek W. Sellers W.R. DeCaprio J.A. Ajchenbaum F. Fuchs C.S. Chittenden T. Li Y. Farnham P.J. Blanar M.A. Livingston D.M. Flemington E.K. Cell. 1992; 70: 351-364Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). Unincorporated nucleotide was removed by chromatography on NICK columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). In most experiments, 10–50 μg of protein were labeled, with typical specific activities of 1 × 106 cpm/μg. Proline, tyrosine, and proline/arginine-oriented degenerate peptide libraries were synthesized using N α-Fmoc-protected amino acids and standard BOP/HOBt coupling chemistry. The following libraries were used: Pro, Met-Ala-X-X-X-X-Pro-X-X-X-X-Ala-Lys-Lys, theoretical degeneracy = 1.7 × 1010; SH3: Met-Ala-X-X-X-X-Pro-X-X-Pro-X-X-X-Ala-Lys-Lys-Lys, theoretical degeneracy = 2.0 × 1011; Pro-Arg, Met-Ala-X-X-X-X-Pro-Pro-Arg-X-X-X-X-Ala-Lys-Lys-Lys, theoretical degeneracy = 1.7 × 1010; and Tyr, Met-Ala-X-X-X-X-Tyr-X-X-X-X-Ala-Lys-Lys-Lys, theoretical degeneracy = 1.1 × 1010.X represents all amino acids except cysteine. In addition, Trp was omitted from the degenerate positions in the SH3 library, and Tyr was omitted from degenerate positions in the Tyr library. Specific individual peptides for use in fluorescence polarization-based binding assays were synthesized in an identical manner, and the final product purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography following deprotection. Peptide library screening was performed using 100 μl of glutathione beads containing saturating amounts of each WW domain-GST fusion protein (∼1–1.5 mg) as described previously (19.Yaffe M.B. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X.Z. Stukenberg P.T. Rahfeld J.U. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Fischer G. Cantley L.C. Lu K.P. Science. 1997; 278: 1957-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 27.Yaffe, M. B., and Cantley, L. C. (1999) Methods Enzymol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Briefly, beads were packed in small columns and incubated with 0.5 mg of the peptide library mixture for 10 min at room temperature in 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 5–10% glycerol, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Unbound peptides were removed by rapidly washing the columns twice with the same buffer followed by two washes with phosphate-buffered saline. Bound peptides were eluted with 30% acetic acid for 10 min at room temperature, dried overnight on a Speed-Vac apparatus, resuspended in H2O, and sequenced on an Applied Biosystems model 477A or Procise protein sequencer. Preference values for amino acid selection were determined by comparing the relative abundance of each amino acid at a particular cycle of Edman sequencing (i.e. mole percentage) in the recovered peptides to that of each amino acid in the original peptide library mixture at the same position. Expression screening was performed using a random-primed mouse limb cDNA library in λ phage, whose construction has been described previously (24.Chan D.C. Bedford M.T. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The expression library was infected into BL21(DE3)pLysE and plated at a density of 200,000 plaques/22-cm2 dish. When plaques reached 0.5–1 mm in diameter, the plates were overlaid with nitrocellulose filters previously saturated with 10 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and allowed to grow for another 6 h at 37 °C. Filters were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in TBS-T (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 1% non-fat dry milk. The filters were then incubated in TBS-T containing 1% milk and 0.5 × 106 cpm of32P-labeled probe/ml overnight at 4 °C, and then washed 4 times for 15 min each. Autoradiography gave strong signals after an overnight exposure with an intensifying screen. After plaque purification, positive phage were excised as plasmids by infecting into the Cre-carrying strain BM25.8, as recommended by the manufacturer (Novagen). The resulting cloned plasmids were then transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysE for fusion protein analysis. For measurements of peptide binding affinity, FBP30 WW-A and YAP WW-GST fusion proteins were exchanged into phosphate-buffered saline using NAP-10 Sephadex G-25 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay (Pierce) using BSA as standard. Fluorescence polarization anisotropy was measured using a Pan Vera Beacon 2000 Variable Temperature Fluorescence Polarization System. Low fluorescence buffers and reagents (Pan Vera Corp.) were used throughout. WW domain proteins were serially diluted (0–171 μm) to a final volume of 150 μl in phosphate-buffered saline in 6 × 50-mm borosilicate glass tubes. Fluorescein-labeled peptides were added (135 nm final concentration), mixed, and fluorescence polarization measured at 22 °C after a 120-s delay with a 16-s integration. A time course of binding showed peak saturation within 120 s. Background fluorescence was measured for each sample prior to peptide addition. At least three binding curves were measured for each of the WW domains to their optimal peptides. Binding data was analyzed by assuming that fluorescence polarization anisotropy was a linear function of ligand binding, and that each WW domain contained a single peptide-binding site as verified by Scatchard analysis. Curves were fit to the equation,L B/L tot =L f/(k D + L f), where L B is bound ligand,L tot is total ligand, L f is free ligand, and k D is the dissociation constant in closed form using nonlinear regression analysis (Kaleidograph). Control experiments showed negligible binding of GST alone to either peptide even at 100 μm protein concentration. PC12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% horse serum, 5% fetal calf serum, and antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin). For radiolabeling, 100-cm2 dishes of 70% confluent cells were switched to 3 ml/plate of 97.5% methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal calf serum and 100 μCi of Trans35S-label (NEN Life Science Products) for 6 h. Cells were lysed by the addition of 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 4 μg/ml each of AEBSF, leupeptin, and pepstatin-A, 8 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 mm sodium orthovanadate, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol for 15–30 min at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. Lysates were precleared by incubation with beads containing bound GST for ∼3 h at 4 °C, and the supernatants then incubated with beads containing equal amounts of immobilized GST WW domain fusion proteins or GST alone overnight at 4 °C with rocking, in the presence or absence of 100 μm competing peptides. A typical experiment involved 500 μl of lysate incubated with 25 μl of beads containing ∼70 μg of fusion protein. The beads were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline + 0.5% Nonidet P-40, resuspended in sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, and antibiotics (50 units/ml penicillin and 50 μg/ml streptomycin) for immunological studies. WW domain-binding proteins isolated by expression cloning were prepared for blot overlay assays by diluting overnight cultures of bacteria containing λExLox-WBP fusion protein plasmids 1:10 into 10 ml of fresh antibiotic-containing medium. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h, and protein expression induced by addition of 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and sonicated. Lysates (10 μl) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by semi-dry transfer onto Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). Blots were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in TBS-T containing 1% non-fat dry milk, then incubated TBS-T containing 1% milk containing 0.5 × 106 cpm of 32P-labeled probe/ml overnight at 4 °C. Filters were washed in TBS-T 4 times for 15 min each and exposed to film. A similar analysis was performed on proteins isolated from unlabeled PC12 cells by affinity purification on beads containing immobilized GST-FBP30 WW-A (above) except that the hybridization solution contained 1 × 106 cpm of32P-labeled probe/ml. Atomic coordinates for the NMR structure of the YAP WW domain (kindly provided by H. Oschkinat) and the high resolution x-ray structure of the Pin1 WW domain (PDB accession code1PIN (43.Ranganathan R. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar)) were used for modeling the FBP30 WW-A domain. Threading was optimized using SwissPdbViewer 3.1 (28.Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar). Modeling was performed using ProModII (28.Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9641) Google Scholar, 29.Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar) and energy minimized with Gromos96 using 200 cycles of steepest descent followed by 300 cycles of conjugate gradient minimization. The final structure demonstrated excellent backbone and side chain superpositions with the base model, and yielded nearly identical overall structures regardless of whether YAP or Pin1 was used as the starting model. All φ and ϕ angles fall within acceptable regions of the Ramachandran plot. Molecular surfaces were generated and displayed and electrostatic potentials calculated using GRASP (30.Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar). For display, structures were rendered using PovRay. A number of WW domain containing proteins have been identified based on their in vitro ability to interact with formin, a morphogenic protein involved in limb and kidney development. Collectively referred to as FBPs, this group consists of four members which contain multiple WW domains (FBP11, 21, 23/28, and 30) that were identified by screening a mouse limb expression library for proteins that interacted with the formin homology 1 domain (FH1 or proline-rich domain) (24.Chan D.C. Bedford M.T. Leder P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1045-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The initial FBP30 clone identified in the screen contained a single WW domain near its amino terminus, denoted FBP30 WW-A (Fig. 1A; accession number AAC52478). A fusion protein containing this WW domain linked to the COOH terminus of glutathione S-transferase (GST) was seen to interact with a wide variety of proteins in PC12 and 293 cell lysates (cf. Fig. 5).Figure 5Optimal peptides compete for binding of WW Domains to intracellular ligands. Lysates from35S-labeled PC12 cells were incubated with beads containing the WW domains of FBP30 WW-A, or YAP as GST fusion proteins, or with GST alone in the presence or absence of the PPR or PY peptides. Bound proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. The PPR peptide (lane 2), but not the PY peptide (lane 3) competed the binding of radiolabeled proteins to the FBP30 WW domain (lane 1). In contrast, the PY peptide (lane 6) but not the PPR peptide (lane 5) competed with protein binding to the YAP WW domain (lane 4), which predominantly binds to a single major band migrating at ∼46 kDa. The positions of molecular mass markers are indicated on theleft with sizes in kDa.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Northern blot analysis of poly(A) selected RNA revealed that the FBP30 transcript is ubiquitously expressed although it is most abundant in spleen and thymus (data not shown and Ref. 21.Depraetere V. Golstein P. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and that it co-migrates with the 28 S ribosomal RNA. Extension cloning was subsequently performed to obtain additional FBP30 coding sequence based on the initial WW-containing clone that had been identified by screening for formin-binding proteins. The sequence shown in Fig. 1 B was obtained by combining sequence data from mouse limb bud and NIH3T3 cDNA library screening, 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends to obtain a putative start site and two expressed sequence tag clones (GenBank accession numbers AA240645 and AA175408) to obtain the stop codon and the poly(A) tail. The resulting 4748-base cDNA codes for a protein of 1077 amino acids that contain a second WW domain, denoted FBP30 WW-B, 385 amino acids COOH-terminal to the previously identified WW domain as well as 3 proline-rich regions (Fig. 1, A andB). The size of the cDNA (4748 bases) corresponds well with the size of the FBP30 transcript seen by Northern blot analysis, the mouse 28 S ribosomal RNA is 4700 bases in size (21.Depraetere V. Golstein P. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 31.Kingston R.E. Asubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley and Sons, New York1994: 4.2.8Google Scholar). It is important to note that we have not yet independently confirmed that our cDNA contains the initiating methionine at the extreme 5′ end, although no additional sequence was obtained despite multiple attempts at 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Depraetere and Golstein (21.Depraetere V. Golstein P. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 883-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) recently published a partial sequence of FBP30 containing the first proline-rich region and WW-A domain based on their finding that FBP30 is a major p53-regulated protein in lethally irradiated thymocytes as detected by Representational Difference Analysis. A Pfam search (32.Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Finn R.D. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar) of the entire FBP30 sequence failed to reveal any additional protein-interaction domains other than the two WW domains. To investigate the amino acid sequence recognized by the FBP30 WW-A domain and compare this with the sequence motif that binds to the WW domain from YAP (33.Linn H. Ermekova K.S. Rentschler S. Sparks A.B. Kay B.K. Sudol M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 34.Chen H.I. Sudol M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7819-7823Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar), we screened GST fusions of each WW domain using a peptide library oriented on a fixed proline residue. As shown in Fig. 2 A, the FBP30 WW-A domain selected an additional Pro or an Arg residues in the Pro−1 position, and showed strong selection for Arg in the Pro+1 position. This finding suggests the new motif, (P/R)PR, as optimal for FBP30 WW-A domain recognition. In contrast, the YAP WW domain selected Leu or Pro in the Pro−1 position, weakly selected for Pro in the Pro+1 position, and showed strong selection for Tyr in the Pro+2 position. This (L/P)PPY motif deduced for the YAP WW domain by peptide library screening is in excellent agreement with the PPXY motif previously obtained for the YAP WW domain by alanine scanning mutagenesis and single peptide binding studies (33.Linn H.

Like the FBP30 WW-A domain, both the FBP21 and FE65 WW domains displayed strong selection for Arg in the Pro+1 position (TableI).

To investigate the potential of xylene monooxygenase to catalyze multistep oxidations of one methyl group, we tested recombinant Escherichia coli expressing the monooxygenase genes xylM and xylA under the control of thealk regulatory system of Pseudomonas oleovoransGpo1. Expression of xylene monooxygenase genes could efficiently be controlled by n-octane and dicyclopropylketone. Xylene monooxygenase was found to catalyze the oxygenation of toluene, pseudocumene, the corresponding alcohols, and the corresponding aldehydes. For all three transformations 18O incorporation provided stong evidence for a monooxygenation type of reaction, withgem-diols as the most likely reaction intermediates during the oxygenation of benzyl alcohols to benzaldehydes. To investigate the role of benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase (XylB) in the formation of benzaldehydes, xylB was cloned behind and expressed in concert with xylMA. In comparison to E. coliexpressing only xylMA, the presence of xylBlowered product formation rates and resulted in back formation of benzyl alcohol from benzaldehyde. In P. putida mt-2 XylB may prevent the formation of high concentrations of the particularly reactive benzaldehydes. In the case of high fluxes through the degradation pathways and low aldehyde concentrations, XylB may contribute to benzaldehyde formation via the energetically favorable dehydrogenation of benzyl alcohols.

XMO is a member of the alkyl-group hydroxylase family and hydroxylates the methyl side chain of the aromatic ring. This is the first step toward the production of a carboxylic acid (upper degradation pathway for xylenes) (Fig. 1), which is then transformed to substrates of the Krebs cycle through the meta cleavage pathway. The upper pathway enzymes are encoded by the upper operon (Fig. 1), whereas the meta cleavage pathway is encoded by the meta operon (1.Harayama S. Kok M. Neidle E.L. Annu. Rev.

Biochem. 1992; 209: 51-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). XylM, the hydroxylase component, is located in the membrane, and its activity depends on phospholipids and ferrous ion with a pH optimum of 7 (8.Wubbolts M.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12787-12794Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar). Based on studies of AlkB, the integral membrane enzymes of this family were proposed to contain diiron clusters as O2-activating sites, for which the 8-histidine motifs provide ligands (15.Shanklin J.

The second enzyme in the upper pathway is benzyl alcohol dehydrogenase (BADH), a homodimeric member of the zinc-containing long chain alcohol dehydrogenase family (16.Shaw J.P. Harayama S. Eur. J.

The third enzyme in the upper pathway, benzaldehyde dehydrogenase (BZDH), is also a homodimer and is encoded by the xylC gene (16.Shaw J.P. Harayama S. Eur. J.

Using Escherichia coli recombinants, XMO was shown to oxidize not only toluene and xylenes but also m- andp-ethyl-, methoxy-, nitro-, and chlorosubstituted toluenes, as well as m-bromosubstituted toluene to corresponding benzyl alcohol derivatives (19.Kunz D.A.

In addition, XMO was observed to catalyze the second step in the upper pathway, the oxidation of benzyl alcohols to corresponding aldehydesin vivo (2.Harayama S. Rekik M. Wubbolts M. Rose K. Leppik R.A. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5048-5055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Harayama S. Leppik R.A. Rekik M. Mermod N. Lehrbach P.R. Reineke W. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 455-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Even the conversion of benzaldehyde to benzoate, the third step in the upper pathway, could be observed, but was attributed to E. coli enzymes (2.Harayama S. Rekik M. Wubbolts M. Rose K. Leppik R.A. Timmis K.N. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 5048-5055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further studies performed in vitro with partially purified XylMA showed no activity toward benzyl alcohol (9.Shaw J.P. Harayama S. J. Ferm. Bioeng. 1995; 79: 195-199Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The reasons for this discrepancy remain unclear. To investigate the ability of E. coli recombinants expressing XylMA to catalyze the multistep oxidation of one methyl group of toluene and xylenes in more detail, we used a recently developed expression system, expressing XMO genes via thealk regulatory system of P. oleovorans GPo1 (21.Panke S. Meyer A. Huber C.M. Witholt B. Wubbolts M.G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 2324-2332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the first of the two previously mentioned alkgene clusters is under control of alkBp, the alkpromoter, and is initiated in the presence of the functional regulatory protein AlkS, which is encoded on the second alk gene cluster, and alkanes or other inducers such as dicyclopropylketone (DCPK) (8.Wubbolts M.

In the present study we show that XMO expressed via the alk regulatory system catalyzes the transformation of toluene and pseudocumene to the corresponding alcohols, aldehydes, and acids by consecutive monooxygenation reactions. Furthermore, we investigated the kinetics of these reactions in the absence and presence of BADH and show that the presence of BADH results in back formation of benzyl alcohol from benzaldehyde, thus lowering net product formation rates. The thermodynamics and the physiological role of the BADH-catalyzed reaction and the involvement of agem-diol intermediate in the XMO-catalyzed alcohol oxygenation are discussed. Strains and plasmids used are listed in Table I. To test the enzymatic activities of XylMA containing recombinants of E. coli JM101, an E. coli K-12 derivative, we used pBR322 derived expression vectors equipped with the alk regulatory system.Table IBacterial strains and plasmidsStrain or plasmidCharacteristicsSource or referenceStrains E. coliDH5asupE44 ΔlacU169 (∅80lacZ?M15) hsdR17 recA1 endA1 gyrA96 thi-1 relA1Ref. 42.Hanahan D.

Open table in a new tab Bacteria were grown either on Luria-Bertani broth (Difco, Detroit, MI) or on M9 minimal medium (25.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) containing a 3-fold concentration of phosphate salts (M9*) and 0.5% (w/v) glucose as single carbon source. When necessary, cultures were supplemented with kanamycin (final concentration, 50 mg/liter), ampicillin (100 mg/liter), chloramphenicol (30 mg/liter), thiamine (0.001% w/v), 1 mm indole, or 0.5 mmisopropyl-β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. Solid media contained 1.5% (w/v) agar. Liquid cultures were routinely incubated on horizontal shakers at 200 rpm and 30 or 37 °C. Restriction and DNA modification enzymes were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, New England Biolabs (Schwalbach, Germany), Life Technologies, Inc., Angewandte Gentechnologie Systeme (Heidelberg, Germany), or Promega (Zurich, Switzerland). The QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit of Qiagen (Basel, Switzerland) was used to obtain small scale plasmid DNA preparations following the supplier's protocol. Chemicals were obtained from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland) (toluene, >99.5%; benzyl alcohol, >99%; benzaldehyde, >99%; benzoic acid, >99.5%; pseudocumene, ∼99%; 3,4-dimethylbenzoic acid, ∼97%), Aldrich (Buchs, Switzerland) (3,4-dimethylbenzyl alcohol, 99%), and Lancaster (Muehlheim, Germany) (3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde, 97%). Standard techniques were used for restriction analysis, cloning, and agarose gel electrophoresis (25.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Construction of pSPZ3 (Fig. 2), a pBR322 derivative, is described elsewhere (21.Panke S. Meyer A. Huber C.M. Witholt B. Wubbolts M.G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 2324-2332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To insert the alcohol dehydrogenase gene xylB into the plasmid pSPZ3 directly downstream of the xylA gene, the 2.3-kilobaseXhoI/FspI fragment of pCKO4 (26.Panke S. Witholt B. Schmid A. Wubbolts M.G. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 2032-2043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) containingxylB was first introduced into the XhoI- andSmaI-digested vector pGEM-7Zf(+) (Promega) to yield pGEMAB. From this construct the 2.3-kilobase fragment was cut out withXhoI and BamHI and ligated into theXhoI- and BamHI-digested plasmid pSPZ3. The resulting plasmid was called pRMAB (Fig. 2). As a negative control pRS containing no xyl genes was constructed. pRMAB was digested with BamHI andSmaI and treated with Klenow enzyme. After isolation of the bigger fragment the vector was religated. Whole cell biotransformations were carried out withE. coli JM101 recombinants that were incubated in 40 or 100 ml of medium in the presence of kanamycin. AtA 450 of ∼0.3, cells were induced by the addition of 0.05% (v/v) DCPK or 0.1% (v/v) n-octane (10−5–1% (v/v) for induction tests), and the incubation was continued for 3–3.5 h, at which time A 450had typically increased to 0.8–0.9. The cells were harvested and resuspended to a cell dry weight (CDW) of 2.5 g/liter in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1% (w/v) glucose. Aliquots of 1 or 2 ml were distributed in stoppered Pyrex tubes and incubated horizontally on a rotary shaker at 250 rpm and 30 °C. After 5 min, substrate was added to a final concentration of 1.5 mm from a 20-fold stock solution in ethanol. For experiments in which the formation of 3,4-dimethylbenzoic acid was expected, CDW was reduced to 1 g/liter, and substrates were added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. The reaction was carried out for 5 min in the shaker and then stopped by placing the samples in ice and immediately adding 40 or 80 μl of a perchloric acid stock solution (10% v/v) to bring the suspension to pH 2. One unit is defined as the activity that produces 1 μmol of total products in 1 min. Specific activity was expressed as activity/g of CDW (unit g−1 CDW). Experiments were repeated at least three times independently. Cells were grown, induced, collected, resuspended, and incubated with substrate as described for the whole cell activity assays. To follow product formation over time cell aliquots were incubated with the same substrate for different time periods (5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 80 min). The reactions were stopped as described for the whole cell activity assays and analyzed. For high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis cells were removed by centrifugation (7800 × g for 8 min), and the supernatants were analyzed. For the separation of benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde, and benzoic acid, we used a Nucleosil C18 column (pore size, 100 Å; particle size, 5 μm; inner diameter, 25 cm × 4 mm) (Macherey-Nagel, Oensingen, Switzerland) with a mobile phase of 69.9% H2O, 30% acetonitrile, 0.1% H3PO4at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. For the separation of 3,4-dimethylbenzyl alcohol, 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde, and 3,4-dimethylbenzoic acid we used the same column at the same flow rate with a mobile phase of 64.9% H2O, 35% acetonitrile-0.1% H3PO4. Detection was done using UV light at 210 nm. For gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis an equal volume of ice-cold ether containing 0.1 mm dodecane as an internal standard was added to samples. After addition of saturating amounts of sodium chloride, the water phase was extracted by vigorous shaking for 5 min at 30 °C, and the phases were separated by centrifugation. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and analyzed. Gas chromatography was used to separate toluene/pseudocumene, the respective alcohols, aldehydes, and acids. GC analysis was done on a GC (Fisons Instruments) equipped with a fused silica capillary column OPTIMA-5 (25 m; inner diameter, 0.32 mm; film thickness, 0.25 μm) of Macherey-Nagel (Oensingen, Switzerland) with splitless injection and hydrogen as the carrier gas. The following temperature profile was applied: from 40 to 70 °C at 15 °C/min, from 70 to 105 °C at 5 °C/min, and from 105 to 240 °C at 20 °C/min. Compounds were detected with a flame ionization detector. GC-MS analysis was performed on a Fisons MD 800 mass spectrometer and a gas chromatograph (Fisons Instruments) equipped with a CP-Sil 5CB column (Chrompack) using split injection (20:1) and helium as the carrier gas. The temperature program was the same as described for GC analysis. Substances were identified by comparison of retention times with those of commercially available standards in both HPLC analysis and GC analysis and by GC-MS analysis. E. coli JM101 (pSPZ3) was grown, induced, harvested, and resuspended as described for the determination of enzyme activities in whole cell assays. 1 ml of cell suspension was transferred to a Pyrex tube with a total volume of 8.3 ml, which was then sealed by using a butyl rubber stopper and a screw-on hole cap. Throughout the following steps, the cell suspension was mixed with a magnetic stirrer. The air in the head space of the Pyrex tube was removed to a reduced pressure of 20 mbar and replaced with nitrogen three times. The headspace was once again evacuated and brought to 80% of ambient pressure with nitrogen; following that, the Pyrex tube was filled with pure oxygen enriched with18O2 (85 atom % 18O). Following the final gas exchange, the cell suspension was incubated horizontally on a rotary shaker at 250 rpm and 30 °C for 15 min to equilibrate the reaction medium. After equilibration, substrate was added by injection through the rubber stopper, and the suspension was again incubated at 250 rpm and 30 °C for different time periods depending on the substrate (toluene, 3 min; benzyl alcohol, 5 min; benzaldehyde, 90 min; pseudocumene, 5 min; 3,4-dimethylbenzyl alcohol, 20 min; and 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde, 20 min). Incubation time was chosen as to allow a maximal formation of the desired products. Identical experiments were done with air in the headspace. The reactions were stopped by placing the samples on ice and immediately adding 40 μl of a perchloric acid stock solution (10% v/v) immediately followed by GC-MS analysis as described above. XMO activities were investigated in E. coli JM101xylMA recombinants. The alk regulatory system, which can be induced by n-octane or DCPK, was chosen to control the expression of the XMO genes, xylMA, on the plasmid pSPZ3 (Fig. 2). XMO activity was followed after induction with 0.1% (v/v)n-octane (Fig. 3 A) or 0.05% (v/v) DCPK (results not shown). XMO activity was quickly induced by both compounds, reaching a constant level of around 115 and 105 units/g of CDW for n-octane and DCPK, respectively, after 3–3.5 h of induction time. The growth rates of the induced cells were clearly reduced when compared with that of noninduced cells. The dependence of XMO activity on inducer concentrations was determined by growing E. coli JM101 (pSPZ3) to 0.09 g of CDW/liter and inducing the cells with different amounts of n-octane and DCPK. After further growth for 3.5 h, cell dry weight and XMO activity were determined for each inducer concentration (Fig. 3,B and C). Very low monooxygenase activities (<6 units/g of CDW) were measured when less than 0.0001% (v/v) octane or 0.001% (v/v) DCPK was added to the culture medium. Maximal induction was observed at DCPK concentrations above 0.005% (v/v), whereas forn-octane this value was observed at octane volume fractions above 0.001% (v/v). The cell densities decreased in inducer concentration ranges where enzyme activities increased to a maximum. For higher concentrations ofn-octane they reached a constant value, whereas higher concentrations of DCPK provoked a further decrease of cell densities (Fig. 3, B and C). We therefore checked the direct influence of different inducer concentrations on the growth ofE. coli JM101 without plasmid. High volume fractions ofn-octane, up to 1% (v/v), had no influence on cell growth. In contrast, concentrations of DCPK above 0.01% (v/v) led to a decreased growth rate. At a DCPK concentration of 0.5% (v/v) the CDW decreased from 0.09 to 0.073 g/liter after 3.5 h of induction, indicating that high DCPK concentrations are toxic to E. coli host strains. E. coli JM101 xylMA recombinants were routinely induced by 0.1% (v/v) n-octane after growth to a cell density of 0.09 g CDW/liter. After incubation for another 3–3.5 h and concomitant growth to 0.23–0.27 g of CDW/liter, product formation rates were determined. XMO was shown to oxygenate toluene to benzyl alcohol, benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde, and benzaldehyde to benzoic acid (TableII). For the first two oxygenation reactions activities as high as 95–100 units/g of CDW were observed, whereas the oxygenation of benzaldehyde occurred at a lower rate of 10 units/g of CDW. For pseudocumene the results were similar: Pseudocumene was oxygenated to 3,4-dimethylbenzyl alcohol, 3,4-dimethylbenzyl alcohol to 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde, and 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde to 3,4-dimethylbenzoic acid. The hydroxylation of pseudocumene was also observed to take place at a rate of 100 units/g of CDW, whereas 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde was formed more slowly at a rate of 50 units/g of CDW and oxygenated to 3,4-dimethylbenzoic acid at a clearly higher rate (55 units/g of CDW) than the oxygenation of benzaldehyde to benzoic acid. When the acids were added as substrates, no reaction products and no depletion of acids were detected.Table IIOxidation of toluene and derivatives by xylene monooxygenaseSubstrateSpecific activityaThe activity assay was performed as described under “Materials and Methods.” One unit is defined as the activity that produces 1 μmol products in 1 min.

Open table in a new tab As negative controls the biotransformations were performed with uninduced E. coli JM101 carrying the plasmid pSPZ3 and with induced E. coli JM101 without plasmid. As an additional control to exclude any effect of the alk regulatory system on E. coli, we constructed plasmid pRS, still containing thealkS gene but lacking the xyl genes. No conversion products were detected in any of these control experiments when toluene, pseudocumene, or the corresponding alcohols were added as substrates (Table II). However, when aldehydes were added as substrates in these experiments, they were reduced to alcohols at a constant rate (Table III). The formation of 3,4-dimethylbenzoic acid could also be shown, but at a very low rate of 2–2.5 units/g of CDW (Table III). It can be concluded that at least 95% of acid formed by induced E. coli JM101 (pSPZ3) is due to the presence of XMO. No significant differences with respect to products formed and rates of formation between the routinely used inducer, 0.1% (v/v) n-octane, and the alternatively used 0.05% (v/v) DCPK were observed (results not shown).Table IIITransformations of aldehydes in control experimentsProduct formedSpecific activityaSee footnote a in Table II.Benzaldehyde as substrate3,4-Dimethylbenzaldehyde as substrateE. coli JM101 (pSPZ3) uninducedE. coliJM101 (pRS) inducedbSee footnote b in Table II.E. coli JM101 (pSPZ3) uninducedE. coli JM101 (pRS) inducedbSee footnote b in Table II.Alcohol19159.48.3Acid0.502.22.4a See footnote a in Table II.b See footnote b in Table II. Open table in a new tab These experiments were done to determine how in the above reactions alcohols, aldehydes, and acids are formed from toluene, pseudocumene, and possibly also other substituted toluenes. One possibility is the consecutive incorporation of single atoms from dioxygen into a methyl substituent of the aromatic ring via a monooxygenase reaction. A second possibility is that aldehydes and acids are formed from benzyl alcohol and 3,4-dimethylbenzyl alcohol via oxidation reactions catalyzed by dehydrogenases. Toluene, pseudocumene, and the corresponding alcohols and aldehydes were incubated with whole cells of E. coli JM101 (pSPZ3) with normal air or an 18O2-enriched atmosphere (85 atom % 18O) as described under “Materials and Methods.” Following incubation, reaction mixtures were extracted with diethyl ether and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Products showing mass spectra characteristic of benzyl alcohol, benzaldehyde, benzoic acid, 3,4-dimethylbenzyl alcohol, 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde, and 3,4-dimethylbenzoic acid have been detected. Fig. 4 (A andB) shows the mass spectra of 3,4-dimethylbenzyl alcohol formed from pseudocumene after incubation with air (A) and with an 18O2-enriched atmosphere (B). The fragmentation patterns of the two spectra clearly show that one atom of dioxygen was incorporated into pseudocumene during the course of the reaction. The ratio of the M+ +2 to M+ molecular ion peaks (Fig. 4 B) is 85:15 for both the m/z 136 (3,4-dimethylbenzyl alcohol) and the m/z 121 (methyl-benzyl alcohol species) peaks. We observed a rapid exchange of oxygen during incubation of benzaldehyde and 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde with H218O (60 atom % 18O), the exchange being faster for benzaldehyde than for 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde. After 5 and 20 min of incubation, 40 and 50%, respectively, of the oxygen in benzaldehyde was 18O. For 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde these values amounted to 11 and 25%. This rapid oxygen exchange in aldehydes precluded a quantitative measurement of 18O incorporation into the aldehydes during the oxidation of toluene, pseudocumene, and the corresponding alcohols by XMO. Nevertheless, the mass spectra of 3,4-dimethylbenzaldehyde formed from 3,4-dimethylbenzyl alcohol (Fig. 4, C and D) showed a minor e"
https://openalex.org/W2092945907,"Myomesin is a structural component of the M-band that is expressed in all types of striated muscle. Its primary function may be the maintenance of the thick filament lattice and its anchoring to the elastic filament system composed of titin. Different myomesin isoforms have been described in chicken and mice, but no particular function has been assigned to them. Here we investigate the spatio-temporal expression pattern of myomesin isoforms by means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and isoform-specific antibodies. We find that two alternative splicing events give rise to four myomesin isoforms in chicken contrary to only one splicing event with two possible isoforms in mice. A splicing event at the C terminus results in two splice variants termed H-myomesin and S-myomesin, which represent the major myomesin species in heart and skeletal muscle of avian species, respectively. In contrast, in mammalian heart and skeletal muscle only S-myomesin is expressed. In embryonic heart of birds and mammals, alternative splicing in the central part of the molecule gives rise to the isoform that we termed EH-myomesin. It represents the major myomesin isoform at early embryonic stages of heart but is rapidly down-regulated around birth. Thus, the strict developmental regulation of the EH-myomesin makes it an ideally suited marker for embryonic heart."
https://openalex.org/W2089914453,"The activity of transcription factors of the Stat family is controlled by phosphorylation of a conserved, carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residue. Tyrosine phosphorylation is essential for Stat dimerization, nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and transcriptional activation. Phosphorylation of Stats on specific serine residues has also been described. We have previously shown that in HC11 mammary epithelial cells Stat5a is phosphorylated on Tyr694 in a prolactin-sensitive manner, whereas serine phosphorylation is constitutive (Wartmann, M., Cella, N., Hofer, P., Groner, B., Xiuwen, L., Hennighausen, L., and Hynes, N. E. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 31863–31868). By using mass spectrometry and site-directed mutagenesis, we have now identified Ser779, located in a unique Stat5a SP motif, as the site of serine phosphorylation. By using phospho-Ser779-specific antiserum, we have determined that Ser779 is constitutively phosphorylated in mammary glands taken from different developmental stages. Stat5a isolated from spleen, heart, brain, and lung was also found to be phosphorylated on Ser779. Ser725 in Stat5a has also been identified as a phosphorylation site (Yamashita, H., Xu, J., Erwin, R. A., Farrar, W. L., Kirken, R. A., and Rui, H. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 30218–30224). Here we show that mutagenesis of Ser725, Ser779, or a combination of Ser725/779 to an Ala had no effect on prolactin-induced transcriptional activation of a β-casein reporter construct. However, following prolactin induction the Ser725 mutant displayed sustained DNA binding activity compared with that of wild type Stat5a. The results suggest that Ser725 phosphorylation has an impact on signal duration. The activity of transcription factors of the Stat family is controlled by phosphorylation of a conserved, carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residue. Tyrosine phosphorylation is essential for Stat dimerization, nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and transcriptional activation.

Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar). Ligand binding results in activation and autophosphorylation of the receptor-associated Janus kinases (Jaks) that phosphorylate specific tyrosine residues in the Jak-receptor complex. Stats and other Src homology 2 (SH2) domain containing proteins are recruited to these sites. Recruitment of Stats leads to their Jak-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation, dimerization, and translocation to the nucleus where they bind specific DNA sequences, affecting the expression of numerous target genes (2.Horvath C.M. Darnell J.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 3.Schindler C. Darnell Jr., J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 621-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (1657) Google Scholar). Stat family members, of which seven have been identified, show a high degree of similarity. Each Stat contains an SH2 domain, a DNA-binding domain, and a carboxyl-terminal transactivation domain, the latter being the least conserved region (4.Briscoe J. Kohlhuber F. Müller M. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 336-340Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation which regulates DNA binding, serine phosphorylation also influences the activity of individual Stats (5.Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E.

Previously we have performed two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping on Stat5a and Stat5b isolated from serum-starved and lactogenic hormone-treated HC11 mammary epithelial cells (8.Wartmann M. Cella N. Hofer P. Groner B. Xiuwen L. Henninghausen L. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31863-31868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Both Stat5 proteins were phosphorylated on tyrosine in a prolactin-sensitive fashion. Stat5a, however, yielded a single tryptic serine-containing phosphopeptide that was constitutively phosphorylated and present in both serum-starved and prolactin-treated cells. By using a combination of mass spectroscopy (MS) and site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrate that Ser779 is a major phosphorylation site on Stat5a. Ser779 is part of a unique SP motif located within the carboxyl terminus of Stat5a. Furthermore, by using phospho-Ser779-specific antiserum we show that Stat5a Ser779 is phosphorylated throughout mammary gland development and can be detected in a variety of other mouse organs. Another serine in Stat5a (Ser725) was also recently found to be constitutively phosphorylated (9.Yamashita H. Xu J. Erwin R.A. Farrar W.L. Kirken R.A. Rui H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30218-30224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Here we show that mutagenesis of Ser725, Ser779, or both Ser725/779 into alanine residues has no significant influence on the prolactin-induced transcriptional activation of a β-casein promoter-reporter construct. However, following prolactin induction, Stat5a S725A displayed sustained DNA binding activity compared with that of wild type Stat5a due to maintenance of Stat5a Tyr694 phosphorylation, whereas Stat5a S779A behaved like Stat5a wild type. These results suggest distinct biological roles for serine phosphorylation in the carboxyl terminus of Stat5a. Antiserum directed against the non-phosphorylated carboxyl-terminal Stat5a peptide (774LDARLSPPAGLFTSARSSLS793) has been described (8.Wartmann M. Cella N. Hofer P. Groner B. Xiuwen L.

Virol. 1985; 54: 186-193Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and used as an immunogen in rabbits to generate antiserum directed against phospho-Ser779. Antiserum was precleared by passing over a resin of immobilized, unphosphorylated peptide (12.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual.

For Western analyses, blots were incubated for 1 h with antiserum at a concentration of 1:500 in the presence of 1 μmunphosphorylated peptide. Expression vectors for the long form of the murine prolactin receptor (pXM-PR) and the (−344 to −1) β-casein gene promoter-luciferase reporter construct (p-344/-1-βc-Lux) have been described (8.Wartmann M.

Stat5a mutants were prepared using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with oligonucleotide primers designed to alter Ser725 and/or Ser779 into an alanine and Tyr694 into phenylalanine. The Stat5a WT and the mutants were cloned into pcDNA3.1, and the DNA sequences were verified before use. pGEX-2T/Stat5a was cloned as anSmaI/EcoRI fragment into pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST-Stat5a was purified according to manufacturer's instructions. Sf9 cells were grown in Grace's insect cell medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml gentamicin.

For [32Pi]orthophosphate labeling experiments, 2 μg of pXM-PR and 2 μg of pcDNA3.1 encoding Stat5a WT or the Stat5a mutant S779A were used in each transfection. For luciferase assays, 1 μg of pXM-PR, 1 μg of p-344/-1-βc-Lux, and either 1 μg of empty vector (pcDNA 3.1) or one of the Stat5a mutants (WT, S725A, S779A, S725A/S779A, and Y694F) were used. COS-7 cells were harvested after various times of prolactin treatment, and luciferase activity was determined on triplicate samples using the luciferase assay system (Promega) as described by the manufacturer. Total light emission was measured during the first 3 s of the reaction using a luminometer (Berthold Microlumat LB96). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were performed on extracts from COS-7 transfected with 1 μg of pXM-PR and 1 μg of the Stat5a mutants (WT, S725A, S779A, and S725A/S779A). One day after transfection the cells were stimulated with 5 μg/ml ovine prolactin for the indicated times. Cells on a 100-mm dish were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into 500 μl of lysis buffer containing 10 mmNa2HPO4/NaH2PO4 (pH 7.4), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 400 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 25 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 mm NaF, 2 mm Na2VO4, and 50 mm sodium glycerophosphate. After three cycles of freezing (dry ice) and thawing, extracts were centrifuged for 15 min at 15,000 rpm. Supernatants were recovered and kept at −70 °C. BALB/c mice were maintained and handled according to the Swiss laws for animal protection. Mammary glands from different stages of development as well as spleen, heart, muscle, brain, kidney, lung, and liver were taken from female BALB/c mice and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Whole cell extracts were prepared in the buffer described above, using a Polytron homogenizer. [32Pi]Orthophosphate was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. One 10-cm dish of HC11 cells was labeled as described previously (8.Wartmann M. Cella N. Hofer P. Groner B. Xiuwen L. Henninghausen L. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31863-31868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Infected Sf9 cells were grown as described above and labeled 24 h post-infection for 16 h in Grace's insect cell medium supplemented with 0.5 mCi/ml [32Pi]orthophosphate. Transfected COS-7 cells, on 100-mm dishes, were incubated for 12 h in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% phosphate-free calf serum followed by a 4-h incubation in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium complemented with 0.5 mCi/ml [32Pi]orthophosphate. At the end of the labeling period, the cells were treated with prolactin for 30 min. Phosphopeptide mapping and phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described previously (8.Wartmann M.

Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method. Stat5a was immunoprecipitated from 0.5 to 1 mg of whole cell extract with specific antiserum and captured by incubation with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). Immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE (7.5%), and Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (8.Wartmann M. Cella N. Hofer P. Groner B. Xiuwen L. Henninghausen L. Hynes N.E.

Groner B. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1783-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Specific binding was analyzed on a native 4% polyacrylamide gel that was prerun for 2 h at 200 V in 0.25× TBE buffer (22.5 mm Tris borate (pH 8.0), 0.5 mm EDTA). The samples were loaded and electrophoresed in the same buffer for 1 h at 200 V. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Sf9 cells were grown to 50% confluency on 100-mm tissue culture plates and infected with recombinant Stat5a baculovirus 2C. Beisenherz-Huss and B. Groner, manuscript in preparation. for 1 h at 27 °C. The virus-containing medium was replaced with fresh medium, and the cells were incubated for 48 h. Cells were pelleted, washed with PBS, and lysed with lysis buffer described above, with the addition of 1% Nonidet P-40. Lysates were clarified and incubated for 1 h with Stat5a antiserum cross-linked to protein A-Sepharose (14.Schneider C. Newman R.A. Sutherland D.R. Asser U. Greaves M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10766-10769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The beads were washed once with lysis buffer, once with 0.5m LiCl, 100 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 2 mmNa2VO4, 25 mm sodium glycerophosphate, and once with 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 2 mm Na2VO4, 25 mm sodium glycerophosphate, and eluted with 100 mm glycine (pH 2.5). Collected fractions were neutralized with 1 m Tris (pH 8.0) and concentrated using Centricon YM-30 (Millipore). 50 μg of Stat5a isolated from infected Sf9 cells was digested with sequencing grade modified porcine trypsin (Promega) at 37 °C for 16 h (enzyme:substrate = 1:50, w/w) in 80 mm Tris-HCl, 80 mm glycine, 2 mm CaCl2, 8% MeCN (pH 8.5). An aliquot of approximately 1 μg was desalted with 5% formic acid, 5% methanol in H2O on a 1-μl Poros 20 R2 column and concentrated to 2 μl with 5% formic acid, 50% methanol in H2O directly into the Nanoelectrospray ionization (Nano-ESI) needle. Nano-ESI mass spectrometry (MS) was performed as described (15.Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar), and phosphopeptides were detected by m/z 79 precursor-ion scanning (16.Carr S.A. Huddelstone M.J. Annan R.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 180-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The mass spectra were acquired on a API 300 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (PE Sciex, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) equipped with a Nano-ESI source (Protana, Odense, Denmark). Fractionation of the peptides by reverse phase liquid chromatography-ESIMS was performed as described (17.Krieg J. Hartmann S. Vicentini A. Gläsner W. Hess D. Hofsteenge J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The phosphopeptide was detected by extraction of the MS data for the ions with m/z 649 and 1296.5 (the [M + 2H]2+ and the [M + H]+ ions) and for the unphosphorylated form of the same peptide m/z 604 and 1216.5, respectively. Lactogenic hormone treatment of HC11 mammary epithelial cells leads to transcriptional induction of the milk protein gene β-casein (18.Ball R.K. Friis R.R. Schoenenberger C.A. Doppler W. Groner B.

Biol. 1990; 10: 4027-4034Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Prolactin-induced activation of Stat5a and Stat5b plays an important role in this process (13.Cella N. Groner B. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1783-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 20.Schmitt-Ney M. Happ B. Hofer P. Hynes N.E. Groner B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1988-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Prolactin-activated Jak2 phosphorylates Stat5 on conserved carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residues, Tyr694 for Stat5a and Tyr 699 for Stat5b. This tyrosine phosphorylation is necessary for Stat5 dimerization, nuclear translocation, and transcriptional activation (21.Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). In contrast to prolactin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation, we have previously shown that Stat5a is constitutively phosphorylated on serine (8.Wartmann M. Cella N. Hofer P. Groner B. Xiuwen L. Henninghausen L. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31863-31868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In order to identify the site of serine phosphorylation, we have employed two cellular systems in which high Stat5a expression levels could be achieved: Stat5a transiently expressed in COS-7 cells and Sf9 cells infected with a Stat5a-encoding baculovirus.2 HC11 cells endogenously expressing Stat5a and COS-7 and Sf9 cells ectopically expressing Stat5a were metabolically labeled with [32Pi]orthophosphate, and Stat5a was immunoprecipitated from cell extracts, resolved by SDS-PAGE, visualized, excised, and subjected to two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping. Stat5a from all three sources yielded essentially the same map, with one predominant phospho-containing peptide (Fig. 1 A, panels a–c) that was shown to contain phosphoserine by phosphoamino acid analysis. 3I. Beuvink, unpublished results. Since the cells were not treated with prolactin, the phosphotyrosine-containing peptide described previously (8.Wartmann M. Cella N. Hofer P. Groner B. Xiuwen L. Henninghausen L. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31863-31868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) was not evident. The phosphoserine-containing peptide from COS-7 cells was isolated and mixed with that derived from Sf9 cells (Fig. 1 B, panel a) and from HC11 cells (Fig. 1 B, panel b), and a second two-dimensional analysis was performed. Comigration of the mixed peptides confirmed that the phosphoserine-containing peptide was identical in each of the cell lines. Consequently, Stat5a from Sf9 cells or from COS-7 cells was used for further analyses. Stat5a isolated from baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells was digested with trypsin and examined by MS. Nano-ESIMS analysis in the positive ion full scan mode revealed multiple Stat5a tryptic peptides (Fig.2 A). In the negative ion precursor scan of m/z 79, which selectively detects phosphopeptides (16.Carr S.A. Huddelstone M.J. Annan R.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 239: 180-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar), three major ions were detected (Fig.2 B). Two ions, 647.3 [M − 2H]−2 and 1294.7 [M − H]− correspond to a potential phosphopeptide with a mass of 1296.2. In Stat5a there are two potential tryptic phosphopeptides of this mass, Thr77(778LSPPAGLFTSAR789) and Thr73(690AVDGYVKPQIK700), with calculated masses of 1216.4 and 1217.4, respectively. The third phosphopeptide, with a mass of 879.5, was identified by tandem Nano-ESIMS as a chymotryptic fragment of Thr77, resulting from cleavage at Phe785. Positive ion tandem Nano-ESIMS of the [M + 2H]2+ (m/z 649.5) identified Thr77, which has two serine residues, as the phosphopeptide (Fig.2 C). Since the y ion series from y4 to y10 left only the two amino-terminal amino acids of the peptide as the potential sites, Ser779 and not Ser787 is the site of phosphorylation. The estimated level of Ser779phosphorylation, determined from the tryptic digest by LC-ESIMS, was 40–60%. 4D. Hess, unpublished results. In order to confirm the MS results, plasmids encoding Stat5a WT or a S779A Stat5a mutant were transfected with a prolactin receptor expression vector into COS-7 cells. Cells were labeled with [32Pi]orthophosphate and treated for 30 min with prolactin, and Stat5aWT and the S779A mutant were isolated and subjected to two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide mapping. Stat5aWT, but not the S779A mutant, generated the expected serine-containing tryptic phosphopeptide (Fig. 3,panels a and b versus c andd). Both Stat5a WT and the S779A mutant generated the expected tyrosine-containing peptide when isolated from prolactin-treated cells (Fig. 3, panels b and d). These data indicate that Ser779 is the major site of serine phosphorylation in Stat5a, and importantly, mutation of this site to a non-phosphorylatable residue does not inhibit prolactin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. To establish whether Stat5a Ser779 is phosphorylated in the mammary gland, a site-specific antiserum was raised against a phospho-Ser779version of the carboxyl-terminal 20 amino acids of Stat5a. The corresponding non-phosphorylated peptide was previously used to produce Stat5a-specific antiserum (8.Wartmann M. Cella N. Hofer P. Groner B. Xiuwen L. Henninghausen L. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31863-31868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) (Fig.4 A). Phospho-Ser779-specific serum was generated by passing the total serum several times through a column cross-linked with the non-phosphorylated peptide. A Western analysis showed that the phospho-Ser779 antiserum reacted strongly with Ser779-phosphorylated Stat5a from HC11 cells and weakly with bacterially expressed, non-phosphorylated GST-Stat5a (Fig.4 B, top panel, lanes 1 and 2). Since reactivity with GST-Stat5a was eliminated by adding 1 μmof the non-phosphorylated peptide to the immunoblot, while reactivity with Stat5a from HC11 cells was maintained (Fig. 4 B, upper panel, lane 4 versus lane 3), these conditions were used in all experiments. Competition with the phosphopeptide resulted in a total loss of reactivity with both Stat5a and GST-Stat5a (Fig.4 B, upper panel, lanes 5 and 6). Membranes were stripped and reprobed with antiserum raised against the non-phosphopeptide in order to confirm equal loading (Fig. 4 B, lower panel). By using phospho-Ser779- and phospho-Tyr-specific antisera, we investigated Stat5a phosphorylation during mammary gland development and in lactogenic hormone-treated HC11 cells. Mammary glands were isolated from virgin Balb/c mice and from mice at different stages of pregnancy, lactation, and involution. Stat5a was immunoprecipitated from whole cell extracts, and Western blot analyses were performed. Stat5a was expressed throughout mammary gland development (22.Liu X. Robinson G.W. Gouilleux F. Groner B. Hennighausen L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8831-8835Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar), with the highest levels present in glands from 18-day pregnant mice and from mice in early lactation (Fig. 5 A, lower panel, lanes 4–6). Western analysis with phospho-Ser779 antiserum followed essentially the same pattern (Fig. 5 A, upper panel, lanes 1–9), suggesting that Stat5a Ser779 phosphorylation is constitutive in the mammary gland. As expected from our previous publication (8.Wartmann M. Cella N. Hofer P. Groner B. Xiuwen L. Henninghausen L. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31863-31868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) Ser779 phosphorylation is also constitutive in HC11 mammary cells (Fig. 5 A, upper panel, lanes 10 and11). In contrast, Stat5a tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in glands from late stages of pregnancy and early stages of lactation and not in earlier stages of development or involution (Fig.7 A, middle panel, lanes 4–6 versus 1–3 and 7–9) as previously observed (23.Liu X. Robinson G.W. Henninghausen L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1496-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Stat5a from lactogenic hormone-treated HC11 cells, but not untreated cells, displayed tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 5 A, lanes 10and 11), as previously shown (8.Wartmann M. Cella N. Hofer P. Groner B. Xiuwen L. Henninghausen L. Hynes N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31863-31868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).Figure 7Mutation of Ser725 of Stat5a to alanine results in sustained prolactin-stimulated DNA binding activity and Tyr694 phosphorylation. COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding the prolactin receptor, and either Stat5a WT or the mutants S725A, S779A, or S725A/S779A. Serum-starved cells were harvested at the indicated times (0–30 h) after 10 nm prolactin treatment. A, whole cell lysates were prepared, and 5 μg of protein was incubated with the Stat5 DNA-binding site from the β-casein promoter, and specific binding was analyzed by EMSA (upper panel). To control for Stat5a expression levels, 30 μg of each lysate was examined by a Western analysis with Stat5a-specific antiserum (lower panel). B, the EMSA was quantitated using Scion Image (Scion Corp.), and the binding activity of each mutant Stat5a protein was compared with WT Stat5a that was set to 100% for each time point. The right panel is the quantitation of A. C, Stat5a was immunoprecipitated from 500 μg of total cell extract and separated by SDS-PAGE, and a Western blot analysis was performed with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (pY,upper panel) and Stat5a-specific antiserum (Stat5a,lower panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In order to address the question of whether Ser779phosphorylation is widespread, Stat5a was immunoprecipitated from whole cells extracts prepared from a range of Balb/c tissues. Stat5a was detected in spleen, heart, brain, and lung, with the highest amount found in the spleen and heart (Fig. 5 B, lower panel, lanes 1, 2, 4, and 6). There was little or no detectable Stat5a in muscle, kidney, and liver (Fig. 5 B, lower panel, lanes 3,5, and 7). Reactivity with the phospho-Ser779 antiserum generally correlated with the level of Stat5a (Fig. 5 B, middle panel). Interestingly, Stat5a from heart reacted strongly with the phosphotyrosine-specific antiserum (Fig. 5 B, upper panel, lane 2), whereas there was little or no reactivity with Stat5a from the other tissues (Fig.5 B, upper panel). Tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat5a is seen as a doublet. Since the immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out in a manner that would preserve Stat5a/b heterodimers (13.Cella N. Groner B. Hynes N.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1783-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), it is likely that this doublet represents both Stat5a and Sta5b. These data suggest that Stat5a Ser779 is phosphorylated in multiple mouse organs. Tyrosine phosphorylation, however, is more restricted. It was recently shown that Stat5a is constitutively phosphorylated on Ser725 (9.Yamashita H. Xu J. Erwin R.A. Farrar W.L. Kirken R.A. Rui H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30218-30224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the Stat5a tryptic phosphopeptide maps that we have generated display only one major serine-containing phosphopeptide, that containing Ser779. The absence of the phospho-Ser725-containing peptide from our maps may be explained by the fact that the predicted tryptic peptide containing Ser725 is large, 61 amino acids. In our analyses, therefore, it may not have eluted from the gel after enzymatic digestion. In order to test the functional significance of Ser779 phosphorylation, as well as Ser725phosphorylation, plasmids encoding two additional Stat5a proteins were constructed as follows: the S725A mutant (Ser725 to alanine) and the double S725A/S779A mutant. Since phosphorylation on Tyr694 is required for prolactin-induced Stat5a DNA binding and transcriptional activation (21.Gouilleux F. Wakao H. Mundt M. Groner B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4361-4369Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar), a vector encoding the Y694F (Tyr694 to phenylalanine) mutant was also constructed, to serve as a negative control for the following experiments. In order to assess a potential role for Stat5a serine phosphorylation in transactivation, expression plasmids encoding Stat5aWT, S725A, S779A, S725/779A, Y694F or the empty vector we"

Activated death receptors recruit death domain adapter proteins like Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD), and this ultimately leads to proteolytic activation of the caspase cascade and cell death. Recently, FADD has also been implicated in the regulation of proliferation; functional inhibition of FADD results in p53-dependent impairment of proliferation in activated T-cells. In this study we have further analyzed T-cells derived from transgenic mice expressing a dominant negative FADD mutant (FADD DN) under control of the lck promoter in vitro so as to identify the signaling pathways that become engaged upon T-cell receptor stimulation and that are regulated by death receptors. FADD DN expression inhibits T-cell proliferation, both at the G0→ S transition and in the G1 phase of continuously proliferating cells. We observe a decrease in the release of calcium from intracellular stores after T-cell receptor stimulation, whereas influx of extracellular calcium seems to be unaffected. FADD DN-expressing fibroblasts show a similarly inhibited cell growth and impaired calcium mobilization indicating that the modulation of proliferation and calcium response by death receptors is not cell type-specific.

The ligands of these receptors comprise a corresponding family of structurally homologous proteins that exist both as homotrimeric soluble molecules and in the form of cell-bound type II transmembrane proteins and that induce activation by imposing receptor aggregation. Ligand-receptor interactions within the TNF-TNF receptor family induce pleiotropic cellular responses including activation, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (1.Wallach D. Boldin M.

A subgroup of the TNF receptor family, the death receptors, shares a homologous intracellular protein-protein interaction motif of about 80 amino acids length, the death domain (DD), that ensures downstream cell death signaling (4.Golstein P.

Originally identified in the CD95 (FAS/APO-1) and TNF-R1 (P55/CD120a) receptors, the death domain is also present in a growing number of family members that includes DR-3 (TRAMP/WSL/APO-3/LARD), TRAIL-R1 (DR-4), TRAIL-R2 (DR-5/TRICK-2/KILLER), p75 nerve growth factor receptor, and CAR-1 (7.Ashkenazi A.

The death domain transduces an apoptotic signal by recruiting death domain-containing adapter molecules such as the FAS-associated protein FADD/MORT-1 or the TNF-receptor-associated protein TRADD (8.Boldin M.P.

Whereas FADD binds directly to CD95, it is recruited to other death receptors like TNF-R1 and DR-3 via the intermediary adaptor TRADD (11.Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K., Yu, G.-L. Lyons R.H. Garg M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6578-6583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar)). FADD thereby recruits caspase 8 to the death receptor C-terminal cytoplasmic tail to form a death-inducing signaling complex (16.Kischkel F.C. Hellbardt S. Behrmann I. Germer M. Pawlita M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5579-5588Crossref PubMed Scopus (1787) Google Scholar); this in turn leads to oligomerization and activation of caspase 8 by self-cleavage (17.Muzio M.

Caspase 8 is then the apical caspase that proteolytically activates downstream effector caspases such as caspase 9 and caspase 3 (18.Muzio M. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2952-2956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), thus initiating the so-called caspase cascade which in certain cell types needs the involvement of mitochondrial changes including cytochrome c release (type II cells (19.Scaffidi C. Fulda S. Srinivasan A. Friesen C. Li F. Tomaselli K.J. Debatin K.M. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1675-1687Crossref PubMed Scopus (2631) Google Scholar)). Caspase activation is generally considered to be the “point of no return” during apoptosis as it results in the proteolytic cleavage of many cellular target proteins (20.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar). In certain instances, death receptors mediate alternative functions distinct from apoptosis (1.Wallach D. Boldin M. Goncharov T. Golstev Y. Mett I. Malinin N. Adar R. Kovalenko A. Varfolomeev E. Behring Inst. Mitt. 1996; 97: 144-155PubMed Google Scholar). For example, engagement of TNF-R1 by TNF rarely triggers apoptosis but rather activates the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1, leading to induction of proinflammatory and immunomodulatory genes in response to infections (21.Tartaglia L.A. Goeddel D.V. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 151-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Several recent studies have also indicated a role for death receptors in proliferation. Thus, the receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) stimulates naive T-cell proliferation following interaction with its ligand (22.Anderson D.M. Maraskovsky E. Billingsley W.L. Dougall W.C. Tometsko M.E. Roux E.R. Teepe M.C. DuBose R.F. Cosman D. Galibert L. Nature. 1997; 390: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1946) Google Scholar); TNF and CD95 antibody can both induce proliferation in human fibroblasts (23.Aggarwal B.B. Singh S. LaPushin R. Totpal K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 5-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and cross-linking of CD95 by specific monoclonal antibodies has been implicated in co-stimulation of CD3 ligation induced T-cell proliferation (24.Alderson M.R. Armitage R.J. Maraskovsky E. Tough T.W. Roux E. Schooley K. Ramsdell F. Lynch D.H. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 2231-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). In addition, CD95 activation stimulates lupus peripheral T-lymphocytes (25.Sakata K.M. Sakata A. Vela-Roch N. Espinosa R. Escalante A. Kong L. Nakabayashi T. Cheng J. Talal N. Dang H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2648-2660Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Recently, we established transgenic mouse lines that overexpress a dominant interfering deletion mutant of FADD (FADD DN) in both thymocytes and mature T-cells under control of the lckpromoter (lck FADD DN mice) (26.Zörnig M. Hueber A.O. Evan G.I.E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 467-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). FADD DN lacks the N-terminal death effector domain and thereby blocks those TNF receptor family members that use FADD as an adapter (13.Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Golstev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2111) Google Scholar). By using this approach we hoped to circumvent the potential problem of functional redundancy among the death receptor family that might limit any distinctive phenotype in single receptor knockout models (see e.g. Refs.27.Pfeffer K. Matsuyama T. Kündig T.M. Wakeham A. Kishihara K. Shahinian A. Wiegmann K. Ohashi P.S. Krönke M. Mak T.W. Cell. 1993; 73: 457-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1537) Google Scholar and 28.Rothe J. Lesslauer W. Lötscher H. Lang Y. Koebel P. Köntgen F. Althage A. Zinkernagel R. Steinmetz M. Bluethmann H. Nature. 1993; 364: 798-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). As expected, CD95-induced apoptosis was inhibited in FADD DN-expressing cells. However, to our surprise we also observed a p53-dependent inhibition of thymocyte proliferationin vivo, and analogous inhibition of activation induced proliferation of thymocytes and mature T-cells in vitro(26.Zörnig M. Hueber A.O. Evan G.I.E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 467-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The inhibition of proliferation was not caused by any increase in cell death. This unexpected result has been confirmed by other groups using similar transgenic mouse models (29.Newton K. Harris A.W. Bath M.L. Smith K.G.C. Strasser A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 706-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 30.Walsh C.M. Wen B.G. Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Dixit V.M. Hedrick S.M. Immunity. 1998; 8: 439-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In addition, theFADD gene knockout causes embryonic lethality (31.Zhang J. Cado D. Chen A. Kabra N.H. Winoto A. Nature. 1998; 392: 296-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar, 32.Yeh W.C. Pompa J.L. Mc Currach M.E. Shu H.B. Elia A.J. Shahinian A. Ng M. Wakemam A. Khoo W. Mitchell K. El-Deiry W.S. lowe S.W. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Science. 1998; 279: 1954-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar), and thymus reconstitution in RAG-1-deficient chimeric mice has confirmed a defect in activation-induced T-cell proliferation in the absence of FADD. These data confirm that the proliferation defect in lck FADD DN transgenic cells is due to functional inactivation of FADD, and they strongly support a growth-promoting function for one or more death domain-containing members of the TNF receptor family that associate with FADD. The aim of this study was to characterize in more detail the molecular mechanism responsible for the proliferation defect in FADD DN-expressing cells. To do this we have analyzed various signal transduction pathways known to be stimulated by TCR activation that lead to proliferation. We find no differences in activation of any tested TCR-activated pathways in the presence of FADD DN with the exception of calcium mobilization, which was severely depressed. FADD DN blocks both quiescent cells from entering the cell cycle (the G0 → S transition) and the proliferation of continuously cycling T-cells in G1. Furthermore, we observe that FADD DN exerts a similar growth-inhibitory effect on fibroblasts, indicating that this effect is not limited to T-cells and so is likely to act on more general, cell type-independent proliferation pathways. FADD DN expression also in fibroblasts results in impaired calcium mobilization upon growth factor stimulation. These data should help to identify the cellular components that constitute the molecular link between death receptors and the proliferative machinery. Generation of lck FADD DN transgenic mouse lines and their initial characterization have been reported (26.Zörnig M. Hueber A.O. Evan G.I.E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 467-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The mice have been maintained on a CBA × C57BL/6 background. S3T3 fibroblasts constitutively expressing a dominant interfering mutant of FADD (S3T3/FADD DN) were obtained by infection of S3T3 c-MycERTMcells with the plasmid pB Hygro NFD4 containing a cDNA encoding FADD residues 80–208, followed by hygromycin selection and cloning as described in Hueber et al. (33.Hueber A.O. Zörnig M. Lyon D. Suda T. Nagata S. Evan G.I. Science. 1997; 278: 1305-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). (In these studies c-MycERTM was not activated by addition of tamoxifen.) Mouse T-lymphocytes were purified from dispersed splenocytes using Mouse T-cell Enrichment Columns from R & D Systems (high affinity negative selection) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml). For activation, purified T-cells were cultured in 24-well plates (2 × 106 cells/well) coated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies (PharMingen). For the coating both antibodies were dissolved at 10 μg/ml antibody in PBS, left in wells overnight at 37 °C, and the wells were then washed three times with PBS. T-cells activated for 72 h and stained with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) were sorted by FACS. During the sort the cells were incubated with soluble anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies and recombinant IL-2 (Chiron UK; 20 ng/ml). The cells were re-plated for further 24 h on anti-CD3/anti-CD28-coated plates in the presence of IL-2-containing supernatant (recovered from the cells before sorting) and then analyzed again for their CFSE profiles by flow cytometry. To assay intracellular Ca2+concentration, 5 × 106 freshly isolated thymocytes or peripheral T-cells from lymph nodes were loaded with 3 μmIndo-1 acetoxymethyl ester (INDO1; Molecular Probes) in 1 ml of RPMI medium without serum. After an incubation of 30 min at 37 °C, 1 ml of RPMI, complemented with 5% fetal calf serum, was added to the cells, and another 30-min incubation at 37 °C was performed. Cells were then washed twice in medium containing serum and resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on a FACSvantage dual laser flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Indo-1 excitation was detected by a UV argon ion laser and its emission by using 500 (blue)/400 (violet) band passer filters. To determine the relative intracellular calcium concentration, cells were pre-warmed to 37 °C 5 min before the experiment, monitored after gating on live cells for 1 min to establish base-line calcium levels, and then stimulated by addition of either anti-CD3 antibody (145. 2c.11) or thapsigargin (Sigma; dissolved in ethanol at 1 mm) (34.Wiest D.L. Ashe J.M. Abe R. Bolen J.B. Singer A. Immunity. 1996; 4: 495-504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In some experiments, EGTA (0.7 mm) was used to chelate calcium present in the experimental medium, and extracellular calcium (CaCl2) was added back to a final concentration of 0.7 mm midway through the experiment. The mean fluorescence ratio and the percentage of responding cells were calculated using MultiTime software (Phoenix Flow Systems, Inc., San Diego, CA). For the calcium analysis in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts, the log phase growing cells were detached from the plates by using a non-enzymatic dissociation solution (Sigma). The single cell suspension was incubated for 45 min in culture medium containing Fluo-3 (3 μm) and Fura red (6 μm) acetoxymethyl esters (Molecular Probes), washed twice with medium, and resuspended in fresh medium at 1 × 106 cells/ml. Flow cytometric analysis and stimulation of the cells with bombesin (Sigma; dissolved in Me2SO and used at 2.5 μm) were performed as described by Novak and Rabinovitch (35.Novak E.J. Rabinovitch P.S. Cytometry. 1994; 17: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The CFSE staining was performed as described previously (Ref. 36.Wells A.D. Gudmundsdottir H. Turka L.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 3173-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar and references herein). Briefly, T-cells were washed once with PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin and resuspended in 1 ml of the same buffer at a maximum concentration of 107 cells/ml. CFSE (obtained from Molecular Probes under the name of CFDA and used from a 5 mm stock in PBS) was added to a final concentration of 10 μm, and the cells were incubated for 5 min at 37 °C, washed twice with PBS, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and plated on anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibody-coated 24-well plates (2 × 106 cells/well). The cells were analyzed by flow cytometry after indicated times (usually 72 h). A control of CFSE-stained T-cells incubated for the same time without activation helped to identify the population of cells in the CFSE profile which had not yet divided. To obtain a Hoechst 33342 cell cycle profile in parallel with the CFSE staining, T-cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 1 ml of PBS, and treated with Hoechst 33342 (Hoechst; 10 μg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C. To distinguish live from dead cells, propidium iodide (5 μg/ml) was added before flow cytometric analysis (UV laser excitation 351.1–363.8 nm, emitted Hoechst 33342 fluorescence at 390–480 nm; living cells were identified as propidium iodide-negative and on the basis of their forward and side light scattering properties). This flow cytometric analysis was performed on a FACSvantage dual laser flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Western blots were performed according to standard protocols as specified by the manufacturers of each commercially available antibody. For standard protein analysis, cells were lysed in 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 2.5% SDS, and 10% β-mercaptoethanol. To analyze the phosphorylation status of cellular proteins, T-cells were collected by brief centrifugation and resuspended in a small volume of 2× phosphatase inhibitor solution (60 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 4 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 500 μm leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin). An equal volume of 10% SDS was added, and the lysed cell pellet was immediately boiled for 5 min. After electrophoresis, proteins were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore), incubated sequentially with primary and horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies, and developed with a chemiluminescence reagent (ECL from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Antibodies were obtained from New England Biolabs (phospho-RB-(Ser-780) and phospho-RB-(Ser-807/Ser-811), phospho-p38 MAPK, phospho-AKT-(Ser-473)), Santa Cruz Biotechnology (p21, p27, phospho-JNK), Alexis (c-FLIP), and Promega (phospho-ERK1/2 (Anti-ActiveTM MAPK polyclonal antibody)). The anti-NFAT1 antibody (anti-67.1 antiserum) was a generous gift from Dr. Patrick Hogan, and the anti-Pan-MYC and anti-EGR-1 antibodies have been described earlier (32.Yeh W.C. Pompa J.L. Mc Currach M.E. Shu H.B. Elia A.J. Shahinian A. Ng M. Wakemam A. Khoo W. Mitchell K. El-Deiry W.S. lowe S.W. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W.

Murine BCL-2 expression was assayed using a rabbit antiserum raised against the murine Bcl-2 peptide GAAPTPGIFSFQPE. To quantify the amount of IL-2 secreted into the supernatant, an ELISA kit for quantification of mouse IL-2 was used according to the manufacturer's protocol (Genzyme). To analyze mRNA levels of mRNAs encoding various cytokines and apoptosis regulator molecules, the RiboQuant multi-probe RNase Protection Assay system from PharMingen was used following the manufacturer's protocol (template set was mCK-1). Total RNA was prepared from unstimulated and CD3/CD28 co-activated purified T-cells using TRIzol reagent from Life Technologies, Inc. Overexpression of FADD DN suppresses TCR-stimulated proliferation of mature T-cells, and this suppression is not due to increased cell death (26.Zörnig M. Hueber A.O. Evan G.I.E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 467-470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 30.Walsh C.M. Wen B.G. Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Dixit V.M. Hedrick S.M. Immunity. 1998; 8: 439-449Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). To investigate this proliferation block in greater detail, we used the fluorescent dye CFSE. In its diacetate form this non-toxic, non-fluorescent molecule passively diffuses into cells, whereupon cellular esterases cleave the acetyl groups to generate the active CFSE fluorophore (Ref. 36.Wells A.D. Gudmundsdottir H. Turka L.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 3173-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar and references therein). The highly amine-reactive succinimidyl ester then forms dye-protein adducts that are retained within or at the surface of the cell. As a consequence, CFSE segregates equally between daughter cells upon cell division, resulting in a sequential halving of cellular fluorescence intensity with each successive generation. When analyzed by flow cytometry, this sequential halving of fluorescence appears as distinct peaks or populations of cells, permitting the tracking of cell division in populations of proliferating cells. We isolated and labeled mature T-cells from the spleens of both wild type and lck-FADD DN transgenic mice with CSFE and analyzed their fluorescence after 72 h of CD3/CD28 co-stimulation (see Fig.1, A and B). As predicted the CFSE profiles, obtained by gating on the living cells in the forward/sideward scatter, showed that far fewer cell divisions had occurred in activated T-cells derived from FADD DNtransgenic mice than in cells from their wild type counterparts. Specifically, 54% of FADD DN expressing T-cells had not yet divided at all 72 h after co-stimulation as compared with only 19% of wild type cells. This shows that the G0 → G1 entry into the cell cycle upon activation is inhibited in FADD DNT-cells. To determine whether cell proliferation is similarly inhibited in continuously proliferating T-cells that have already passed the G0 → G1 transition, we sorted CFSE-labeled purified T-cells 72 h after CD3/CD28 co-stimulation to obtain homogeneous cell populations that had divided either only once (P1) or not at all (P0) (as shown for wild type cells in Fig. 1 C). Cell sorting was performed in the presence of recombinant IL-2 and soluble anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies to maintain the mitogenic stimulus. Sorted cells were then cultured on anti-CD3/anti-CD28-coated plates in the presence of IL-2 for a further 24 h, and their CFSE fluorescence profiles were compared again. As expected, many more cells from the wild type P0 population (which had not divided at all after the first 72 h) started proliferating during the following 24 h compared to FADD DN T-cells (data not shown). However, we also observed a similar inhibition of proliferation in FADD DN P1 T-cell populations that had already entered the cell cycle before sorting and replating (see Fig. 1 D). Only 1.5% of wild type cells had not divided again since replating compared with 41% of FADD DN cells. This result was confirmed by cell cycle analysis of cycling cells (see Fig. 1 E): 72-h CD3/CD28 co-stimulated and CFSE-stained T-cells from either FADD DN transgenic mice or their wild type littermates were incubated with the DNA intercalating dye Hoechst 33342, and both their CFSE and cell cycle profiles were obtained by flow cytometric analysis. CFSE staining demonstrated the characteristic inhibition of FADD DN T-cell proliferation compared with wild type cells. Cell cycle distribution analysis of cycling cells (gated on the CFSE profile) indicated that 51% of the wild type cells were in G1 phase (25% in S and 24% in G2/M) compared with 61% of FADD DN T-cells (31% in S and 7% in G2/M). This result was confirmed in several independent experiments. Together, these data demonstrate that FADD DN not only inhibits the entry of activated T-cells into the cell cycle but also blocks the cell cycle progression of already proliferating cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle. To search for molecules and signaling pathways that might be responsible for the proliferative defect in FADD DN overexpressing T-cells, we analyzed expression levels and activities of several key molecules implicated in activation-induced T-cell proliferation. The earliest characterized biochemical response elicited by the TCR is the activation of TCR-associated protein kinases (for review of TCR signal transduction pathways see Refs. 38.Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar and 39.Peterson E.J. Clements J.L. Fang N. Koretsky G.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). However, the overall crude pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins present after 5 min of co-stimulation by soluble anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies appeared the same in activated T-cells purified from both FADD DNtransgenic and wild type mice (data not shown). p21RAS couples the TCR to the MAPK pathway (38.Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar, 39.Peterson E.J. Clements J.L. Fang N. Koretsky G.A. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1998; 10: 337-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), a kinase cascade involving c-RAF activating MEK which activates the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2, both of which then phosphorylate additional target kinases (40.Mustelin T. Brockdorff J. Gjorloff-Wingren A. Tailor P. Han S. Wang X. Saxena M. Front. Biosci. 1998; 1: D1060-D1096Crossref Google Scholar). The cascade classically culminates in the phosphorylation of various transcription factors such as ELK-1, which participates in the transcriptional control of c-fos and other cell cycle regulators. We observed no inhibition of phosphorylation/activation of either ERK1 and ERK2 by FADD DN expression during CD3/CD28-mediated co-activation of T-cells (see Fig.2 A). We also investigated any effect FADD DN expression might exert on induction of the early growth response gene egr-1, a target of the MAPK pathway (41.Hipskind R.A. Buscher D. Nordheim A. Baccarini M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1803-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 42.Hipskind R.A. Baccarini M. Nordheim A. Mol. Cell.

We observed a severalfold induction of EGR-1 expression upon CD3/CD28 co-stimulation in purified T-cells that appeared the same in both wild type and FADD DN transgenic T-cells (see Fig.2 B).

The tether is proposed to involve the simultaneous binding of p115 to giantin on one membrane and to GM130 on another membrane. To explore this model, we tested for the presence of the putative giantin-p115-GM130 ternary complex. We first mapped p115-binding site in giantin to a 70-amino acid coiled-coil domain at the extreme N terminus, a position that may exist up to 400 nm away from the Golgi membrane. We then generated glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing either giantin's or GM130's p115 binding site and tested whether such proteins could bind p115 and GM130 or bind p115 and giantin, respectively. Unexpectedly, GST fusions containing either the giantin or the GM130 p115 binding site efficiently bound p115, but the p115 bound to GST-giantin did not bind GM130, and the p115 bound to GST-GM130 did not bind giantin. To explain this result, we mapped the giantin binding site in p115 and found that it is located at the C-terminal acidic domain, the same domain involved in binding GM130. The presence of a single binding site in p115 for giantin and GM130 was confirmed by demonstration that giantin and GM130 compete for binding to p115. These results question a simple tethering model involving a ternary giantin-p115-GM130 complex and suggest that p115-giantin and p115-GM130 interactions might mediate independent membrane tethering events.

Arguably, the importance of vesicle docking is reflected by the number and conservation of distinct protein complexes involved in this process (1.Ferro-Novick S. Jahn R.

Perrelet A. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2279-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), suggesting that vesicles might be tethered to the Golgi by interacting with fibrous membrane proteins. As vesicles form, tethers might anchor them to the site of vesicle formation, thus limiting their diffusion away from the Golgi stack and promoting their interaction with nearby cisternae. Alternatively, tethers could trap vesicles formed at distant sites once they have migrated to the Golgi region and anchor them to the site of vesicle docking and fusion. In both cases, tether formation would have important consequences for vesicle transport to or through the Golgi stack in either the anterograde or the retrograde direction (5.Orci L. Stamnes M.

The membrane transport factor p115 has been proposed to mediate tethering of COPI vesicles to the Golgi membrane (6.Sönnichsen B. Lowe M. Levine T. Jamsa E. Dirac-Svejstrup B. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). p115 is a peripheral Golgi membrane protein (7.Waters M.G. Clary D.O. Rothman J.E. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis indicates that p115 is homologous to Uso1p, a protein required for endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (15.Nakajima H. Hirata A. Ogawa Y.

During endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi transport in vitro, Uso1p mediates binding of endoplasmic reticulum-derived coat protein II vesicles to Golgi membranes (17.Cao X., N. Ballew Barlowe C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2156-2165Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Both p115 and Uso1p have an analogous three-domain structure: an N-terminal globular domain, a coiled-coil dimerization domain, and a C-terminal acidic domain (11.Barroso M. Nelson D.S. Sztul E.

Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). GM130 is a tightly associated cytoplasmically oriented peripheral component of the Golgi, predicted to form a segmented coiled-coil dimer (21.Nakamura N. Rabouille C. Watson R. Nilsson T. Hui N. Slusarewicz P. Kreis T.E. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1715-1726Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 22.Slusarewicz P. Nillson T. Hui N. Watson R. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 405-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Giantin is a C-terminally anchored dimeric integral component of the Golgi membrane with a large cytoplasmic domain also predicted to form a segmented coiled-coil (23.Linstedt A.D. Hauri H.-P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 679-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 24.Linstedt A.D. Foguet M. Renz M. Seelig H.P. Glick B.S. Hauri H.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1994; 14: 2564-2576Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Because giantin, but not GM130, is recovered in COPI vesicles generated from Golgi fractions in the presence of GTPγS, and p115 promotes binding of these COPI vesicles to Golgi membranes, it was proposed that p115 mediates vesicle tethering by simultaneously binding giantin in vesicles and GM130 on the Golgi (6.Sönnichsen B. Lowe M. Levine T. Jamsa E. Dirac-Svejstrup B. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Indeed, anti-giantin and anti-GM130 antibody treatments that reduce p115 membrane binding also block vesicle docking (6.Sönnichsen B. Lowe M. Levine T. Jamsa E. Dirac-Svejstrup B. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Similarly, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein-dependent cisternae formation as well as Golgi reassembly stacking protein (GRASP) 65-dependent cisternal stacking also require p115 and are inhibited by anti-giantin or anti-GM130 antibodies (14.Shorter J. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Together, the data suggest that multiple processes involving close apposition of Golgi membranes might utilize p115, giantin, and GM130 for tether formation. However, a key prediction of the proposed model, that membrane tethering is mediated by a simultaneous binding of p115 to giantin and GM130, has not been documented. Constructs used for the generation of glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins were in pGEX (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), a vector encoding the GST gene followed by a multiple cloning site followed by stop codons in all three frames. In each case, fragments of giantin, GM130, or p115 were cloned in frame at the multiple cloning site. For GST-giantin I-V, GST-giantin X, and GST-giantin I and II, the restriction fragments from the full-length giantin cDNA (24.Linstedt A.D. Foguet M. Renz M. Seelig H.P. Glick B.S. Hauri H.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5102-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) used were BamHI–XhoI (−28 to 2086), EcoRV–KpnI (4535–5630), andBamHI–HindIII (−28 to 778), respectively. For the nucleotide positions indicated here, 1 equals the A in giantin's start codon, and nucleotides upstream of the start codon were derived from the pBluescript-II-KS polylinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For GST-giantin I and GST-giantin II, the giantin fragments were generated with the polymerase chain reaction using the primer pairs 5′-CGGGATCCAATTTAATAATACTACA with 5′-CGGGATCCAGAACAGTCCCTCCTTG (122–367) and 5′-CGGGATCCAGTCAGAGGAGCAACTT with 5′-CGGGATCCGGGCATCTTTCTCTCG (379–675), respectively. For GST-p115, the restriction fragments used were EcoRI–NotI (for GST-p115-(710–959)) or EcoRI–XhoI (for GST-p115-(710–934)). Constructs used for generation of in vitro translated p115 protein fragments were in pBluescript-II-KS (Stratagene), a vector containing the T3 promoter site for transcription. In each case, a p115 fragment from the full-length cDNA (11.Barroso M. Nelson D.S. Sztul E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 527-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) was cloned into the plasmid multicloning site. Constructs used for production of p115 and GM130 in bacteria were previously described (9.Nelson D.S. Alvarez C. Gao Y.-s. Garcia-Mata R. Fialkowski E. Sztul E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 319-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). All constructs used were confirmed by restriction mapping. Individual colonies of DH5aF′ E. coli transformed with a fusion protein encoding the pGEX vector were grown to OD 0.6 in 1 liter of LB at 37 °C, induced with 0.5 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 5 h at 30 °C, and collected as a cell pellet. After washing with 150 mm NaCl, the cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A), incubated on ice for 30 min, adjusted to 0.5% Triton X-100, sonicated four times for 30 s each, and centrifuged at 100,000 rpm for 30 min in a TLA 100.3 rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). The cleared lysate was collected and incubated with 0.5 ml of glutathione-agarose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with 40 ml of PD buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 1 mm dithiothreitol) containing 0.1% Triton X-100, washed with 10 ml of PD buffer, and then eluted in PD buffer containing glutathione. The purity of the eluted fractions was monitored by Coomassie staining after SDS-PAGE. Following dialysis against phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C, the proteins were aliquoted and frozen. In some cases, the washed column beads were used directly in binding experiments. Preparation of bacterial lysates containing GM130 was as described previously (9.Nelson D.S. Alvarez C. Gao Y.-s. Garcia-Mata R. Fialkowski E. Sztul E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 319-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription and translation reactions for p115 were carried out using the TNT system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's specifications. The reactions were aliquoted and frozen at −80 °C before use. All frozen samples were thawed and centrifuged at 100,000 ×g immediately before use in binding assays. For the preparation of cell extracts, normal rat kidney (NRK) cells were rinsed three times and collected by scraping in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended with 3 volumes of 2× HKT (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 200 mm KCl, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml pepstatin A), passed through a 25-gauge needle, adjusted with 3 volumes of H2O, and centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g. For the preparation of membrane and cytosol extracts, rinsed NRK cells were homogenized by 10 passes through a 25-gauge needle in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Hepes, 1 mm EDTA containing the protease inhibitors. The postnuclear supernatant was collected after a 2-min spin at 1000 × g, underlayered with 10 μl of 50% sucrose, and centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g. The resulting supernatant was further centrifuged for 30 min at 100,000 × g to yield the cytosol fraction. The membrane pellet on its sucrose cushion was lysed with 5 volumes of 2× HKT containing the protease inhibitors, passed through a needle, adjusted to 1× HKT with H2O, and clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 100,000 × g. Unless otherwise indicated, each assay was carried out with a 10-μl volume of packed glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) coated with approximately 2 μg of GST fusion protein. The beads were prewashed three times with 0.5 ml of 1× HKT, rotated with the lysate (reticulocyte lysate, NRK lysate, or bacterial lysate) for 60 min at 4 °C at a final volume between 50 and 200 μl, washed four times with 0.5 ml of HKT for each wash, and eluted with either sample buffer or 0.5 ml of 0.6 m KCl. Fractions corresponding to total, unbound, each wash, and the salt eluate were concentrated by precipitation with trichloroacetic acid. The samples were analyzed on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The entire eluate was analyzed, whereas the amount of total analyzed varied and is indicated in the figure legends. The gels were processed for silver staining, fluorography, or immunoblotting. Antibodies and their dilutions used for immunoblotting were anti-p115 (9.Nelson D.S. Alvarez C. Gao Y.-s. Garcia-Mata R. Fialkowski E. Sztul E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 319-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) at 1:5000, anti-GM130 (9.Nelson D.S. Alvarez C. Gao Y.-s. Garcia-Mata R. Fialkowski E. Sztul E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 319-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) at 1:5000, and anti-giantin (23.Linstedt A.D. Hauri H.-P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 679-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar) at 1:200. For binding to antibody-coated beads, each assay was carried out with a 10-μl volume of packed protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) coated with anti-p115 (0.5 μl). The binding assays were otherwise carried out as described for the glutathione-agarose beads. For two-stage assays, the washed beads from the first stage, prior to elution, were carried through a second round of binding and washes exactly as described for the first stage. Ternary complex formation was not analyzed in previous reports, and the recovery of giantin and GM130 on beads containing attached p115 (6.Sönnichsen B. Lowe M. Levine T. Jamsa E. Dirac-Svejstrup B. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) could be explained by the recovery of distinct p115-giantin and p115-GM130 dimers. Our approach differed in that we tested directly the formation of a ternary giantin-p115-GM130 complex by incubating beads containing bound giantin or beads containing bound GM130 with cell extracts containing p115, GM130, and giantin. p115-dependent recovery of GM130 on giantin beads would illustrate that p115 can mediate the hypothesized bridge formation by linking giantin to GM130. Similarly, the bridge would also be illustrated by p115-dependent giantin recovery on GM130 beads. To test the model, we needed to generate GST fusion proteins containing the p115 binding site of giantin or GM130. To identify the p115 binding site in giantin, different fragments of giantin were fused in frame to the C terminus of GST (Fig.1 A). The constructs were expressed in bacteria, purified and immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads, and tested for their ability to bind radiolabeled full-length rat p115 generated by in vitro transcription/translation. The cytoplasmic domain (3238 amino acids) of giantin contains 13 discrete regions strongly predicted to form coiled-coil structures (coils I–XIII; Fig. 1 A). As shown in Fig. 1 B, an N-terminal fragment of giantin containing coils I–V bound p115 (lane 2), as did an N-terminal fragment containing coils I and II (lane 4) and an N-terminal fragment containing only coil I (lane 6). A fragment containing part of coil X (lane 3), a fragment containing coil II (lane 5), and GST alone (lane 1) did not bind p115. These results indicate that the most N-terminal piece of giantin tested, coil I (amino acids 47–117), was sufficient for p115 binding. Identical results were obtained when the GST-giantin fragments were tested for binding to cellular p115 (see below; Fig.2 A); i.e. all giantin fragments that contained coil I bound endogenous p115, and all fragments that lacked coil I did not bind. As shown in Fig.1 C, the concentration of GST-giantin for half-maximal p115 binding in vitro was ∼260 nm.Figure 2Giantin bound p115 does not bind GM130. A, indicated GST-giantin fusion proteins bound to glutathione-agarose beads were incubated with NRK detergent extracts. The amount of cellular GM130 and p115 recovered on the beads was determined by immunoblotting with anti-GM130 antibodies (GM130 panel) or anti-p115 antibodies (p115 panel). The total (T) represents 10% of the total GM130 and p115 present in the binding assays. Only giantin fragments containing coil I bound p115 (lanes 3, 4, and 6). Despite ample recovery of p115, GM130 was not recovered. B, GST-giantin I–V bound to glutathione-agarose beads (lanes 1 and2) or anti-p115 antibodies bound to protein A-Sepharose beads (lanes 3 and 4) were used in a two-stage incubation. In stage 1, the beads were incubated with NRK detergent lysates. After washing the beads, stage 2 reactions were carried out by incubating the beads with buffer alone (lanes 1 and 3) or with buffer containing bacterially produced full-length GM130 (lanes 2 and4). The amount of endogenous p115 and of endogenous and bacterially produced GM130 recovered on the beads was determined by immunoblotting with a mixture of anti-GM130 and anti-p115 antibodies. Equivalent amounts of endogenous p115 were recovered with GST-giantin and anti-p115 antibodies (lanes 1–4). However, endogenous GM130 was recovered only with immunoprecipitated p115 (lane 3) but not with GST-giantin precipitated p115 (lane 1). Similarly, exogenous GM130 bound to immunoprecipitated p115 (lane 4) but not to GST-giantin precipitated p115 (lane 2).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To test whether coil I was sufficient and necessary for the interaction between giantin and p115, we generated an expression construct to be used for transfection in COS-7 cells, in which the sequences corresponding to coil I were deleted and sequences corresponding to the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope were added at the N terminus. As a control, a construct corresponding to an HA-tagged version of full-length giantin was also generated. Extracts from transfected cells were incubated with beads containing p115, and after washing, the recovery of the HA-tagged protein on the beads was determined by immunoblotting with anti-HA antibodies. Fig. 1 D illustrates that only the full-length giantin bound to bead-attached p115 (lane 2), while the giantin fragment lacking coil I did not bind (lane 4). Both HA-tagged proteins were abundantly expressed (lanes 1 and 3) and localized to the Golgi in transfected cells (data not shown). Therefore, giantin's N-terminal coil I, a domain that may extend up to 400 nm away from the membrane, is necessary and sufficient to mediate giantin's interaction with p115. To test whether ternary complexes could form on GST-giantin, different GST-giantin fragments were immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads and incubated with detergent extracts of NRK cells. Bound proteins were eluted, and the presence of p115 and GM130 was analyzed by immunoblotting. As expected, cellular p115 bound to all GST-giantin constructs containing giantin's coil I (Fig. 2 A, p115 panel, lanes 3, 4, and6) but not to constructs lacking coil I (lanes 2 and 5). However, despite the abundant recovery of p115, GM130 was not recovered on the beads (GM130 panel). Therefore, endogenous p115 did not mediate the indirect association of endogenous GM130 with giantin. Because a significant proportion of cellular p115 is bound to GM130 (9.Nelson D.S. Alvarez C. Gao Y.-s. Garcia-Mata R. Fialkowski E. Sztul E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 319-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 20.Nakamura N. Lowe M. Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), this suggested that the p115-GM130 complex did not bind to giantin. Instead, only uncomplexed p115 bound giantin, and when this occurred the giantin-bound p115 no longer could interact with GM130. To ensure that p115 remained associated with GM130 in our NRK extracts, we performed parallel precipitations using either anti-p115 antibodies or GST-giantin. As shown in Fig. 2 B, p115 was recovered together with GM130 following immunoprecipitation (lane 3), indicating that stable p115-GM130 complexes were present in the cell lysate. However, such complexes were not recovered during precipitation with GST-giantin (lane 1). Only uncomplexed p115 bound to giantin. These results provide strong evidence that both free p115 and p115-GM130 complexes were present in the NRK extracts, that only the free p115 bound giantin, and that once bound to giantin p115 no longer could interact with GM130. We next tested whether p115 bound to GST-giantin was competent to bind exogenously added bacterially produced GM130. As a control, an analogous incubation was carried out with p115 isolated on anti-p115 antibodies bound to protein A-Sepharose. The exogenous GM130 did not bind to the GST-giantin-precipitated p115 (Fig. 2 B,lane 2). Under the conditions used in these experiments for binding of p115 to GST-giantin, the p115 was at saturating levels. Therefore, the lack of GM130 binding is unlikely to be due to GST-giantin occupying two sites (one of which might normally be available for GM130 binding) on a single molecule of p115. The results indicate that p115 bound to GST-giantin is unable to bind GM130. To confirm that our results were not due to some peculiarity in the GST-giantin proteins used, we also tested for ternary complex formation using beads containing GM130. GM130 is known to bind p115 via its N terminus, which contains a stretch of basic residues (20.Nakamura N. Lowe M. Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). To confirm that the GM130 N-terminal domain is sufficient for p115 binding, the N terminus of GM130 (amino acids 1–74) was fused in frame to the C terminus of GST (Fig.3 A). The resulting GST-GM130 fusion protein was expressed in bacteria, purified, and immobilized on glutathione agarose beads. This matrix was incubated with detergent-solubilized NRK membranes to determine whether the GM130 fragment was capable of isolating endogenous p115. GST-giantin was used as a positive control, and GST alone served as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 3 B, beads containing GST-GM130 specifically bound cellular p115 (p115 panel, lane 4). Therefore, the GM130 N terminus is sufficient for binding to p115. Nevertheless, similar to the result for GST-giantin, no evidence for formation of a ternary GM130-p115-giantin complex was obtained; i.e. despite abundant recovery of p115 on GST-GM130, no giantin was recovered (Fig. 3 B, Gtn panel). Together, the results indicate that, under the conditions tested, although p115 can bind either giantin or GM130, once it is bound to one it loses its capacity for binding the other. p115 binding to GM130 appears to be mediated by a charge interaction between the C-terminal acidic tail of p115 and a stretch of basic residues in the N terminus of GM130 (9.Nelson D.S. Alvarez C. Gao Y.-s. Garcia-Mata R. Fialkowski E. Sztul E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 319-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 20.Nakamura N. Lowe M. Levine T.P. Rabouille C. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Interestingly, giantin's coil I also has a marked cluster of basic residues. For comparison, the sequences of GM130 N terminus, giantin's N-terminal coil I, and p115 C-terminal acidic domain are shown in Fig. 4. A simple explanation for the lack of ternary complex formation would be that giantin and GM130 bind to the same site on p115. To test whether giantin binds to the same region of p115 that binds GM130, various fragments of p115 cDNA were generated (shown schematically in Fig.5 A), and the corresponding radiolabeled proteins were produced by in vitrotranscription/translation. Binding of these proteins to GST-giantin immobilized on beads was then determined. As shown in Fig.5 B, p115 constructs containing the C-terminal acidic domain (i.e. full-length p115-(1–959) (lanes 1 and 2) and p115-(283–959) (lanes 5 and 6)) bound giantin. Constructs lacking the acidic domain (i.e. p115-(1–324) (lanes 3 and 4), p115-(1–934) (lanes 7 and 8), and p115-(1–766) (lanes 9 and 10)) did not bind giantin. These results suggested that the acidic domain at the extreme C terminus of p115 is required for binding. To test whether the region containing the acidic domain is sufficient for binding giantin, the C terminus of p115 including amino acids 710–959 was fused in frame to the C terminus of GST. As a control, the same region but lacking the most C-terminal 25 amino acids (p115-(710–934)) was fused to GST. The resulting fusion proteins were expressed in bacteria and were purified and immobilized on glutathione-agarose beads. Each matrix was then incubated with NRK lysates to determine whether the p115 fragment is capable of isolating endogenous giantin. As shown in Fig. 5 C, GST-p115-(710–959) bound giantin (lane 1), whereas a fusion protein lacking the acidic tail, GST-p115-(710–934) did not bind giantin (lane 2). Similarly, GM130 was recovered with the GST-p115 containing the acidic C terminus but not when the acidic terminus was removed (Fig. 5, GM130 panel). These data are analogous to those showing endogenous giantin and GM130 recovery on beads containing full-length p115 (6.Sönnichsen B. Lowe M. Levine T. Jamsa E. Dirac-Svejstrup B. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). To test directly whether giantin and GM130 interactions with p115 are mutually exclusive, we measured the binding of GST-giantin to immobilized p115 in the presence of increasing concentrations of GST-GM130. The addition of increasing concentrations of GST was used as a control. As expected, GST-giantin bound to beads containing immunoprecipitated cytosolic p115 (Fig. 6, GST-Gtn panel, lanes 2 and 6) but not to control beads without p115 (lane 1). In contrast, GST-giantin binding was significantly blocked if the binding reaction was carried out in the presence of increasing concentrations of GST-GM130 (lanes 3–5). When GST was added in place of GST-GM130, GST-giantin binding to p115 was not altered (lanes 7–9). These findings suggest that giantin and GM130 compete for binding to p115. Indeed, the added GST-GM130 that prevented GST-giantin binding was recovered bound to p115 (Fig. 6,GST-GM130 panel, lanes 3–5). GST did not interact with the immunoprecipitated p115 (Fig. 6, GST panel). The differences in recovery of GST-giantin in the presence or absence of GST-GM130 were not due to differences in p115 levels in the immunoprecipitates (Fig. 6, p115 panel, lanes 2–9). Together, the data indicate that p115 independently, but not simultaneously, interacts with either giantin or GM130. Dissection of molecular events that mediate target recognition by vesicles is key to our understanding of trafficking and subcellular compartmentalization. One of the earliest events in the sequence of interactions that mediate vesicle docking is likely to involve stable tethering of vesicles to the target membrane. Fibrous material visualized by electron microscopy appears to attach COPI vesicles to Golgi cisternae (4.Orci L. Perrelet A. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2279-2283Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), suggesting that long extended proteins might mediate the tethering process. The transport factor p115, which binds to two extended Golgi proteins, giantin and GM130 (6.Sönnichsen B. Lowe M. Levine T. Jamsa E. Dirac-Svejstrup B. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 9.Nelson D.S. Alvarez C. Gao Y.-s. Garcia-Mata R. Fialkowski E. Sztul E. J.

Cell. 1997; 89: 445-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), was recently proposed to physically link COPI vesicles to the Golgi by simultaneously binding giantin present in the vesicles and GM130 present on the Golgi membranes (6.Sönnichsen B. Lowe M. Levine T. Jamsa E. Dirac-Svejstrup B. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The same mechanism was proposed to mediate cisternae formation and cisternal stacking (14.Shorter J. Warren G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To test this model, we asked whether giantin could bind GM130 in a p115-dependent manner and whether p115 could bind both giantin and GM130 simultaneously. To generate exogenous immobilized giantin capable of binding p115, we needed to map giantin's p115 binding site. Interestingly, a 70-amino acid giantin domain that is predicted to form a coiled-coil segment at the extreme N terminus of the protein was required and sufficient for p115 binding. The length of giantin's cytoplasmic domain is estimated to be 250 nm (calculated from measured sedimentation and diffusion coefficients (24.Linstedt A.D. Foguet M. Renz M. Seelig H.P. Glick B.S. Hauri H.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5102-5105Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar)) and could be as long as 430 nm if the entire protein were to form an extended coiled-coil. Because giantin is anchored to the membrane through a stretch of hydrophobic amino acids at its extreme C terminus, these estimates indicate that p115 binding to giantin may take place at a relatively great distance from the membrane. GM130 also has an N-terminal p115 binding site, and GM130 is predicted to form an elongated (up to 130-nm) coiled-coil anchored to the Golgi membrane via its C-terminal binding to the myristoylated membrane-anchored protein GRASP65 (26.Barr F.A. Puype M. Vandekerckhove J. Warren G. Cell. 1997; 91: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 27.Barr F.A. Nakamura N. Warren G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3258-3268Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). p115 itself is 50 nm long (16.Sapperstein S.K. Lupashin V.V. Schmitt H.D. Waters M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Therefore, end to end binding of giantin-p115-GM130-GRASP65 into a complex would generate an almost absurdly long membrane-membrane linkage. Of course, the actual length of such a tether would depend on the conformation of the complex. If the ∼100-nm filaments visualized connecting COPI vesicles to the Golgi were a giantin-p115-GM130-GRASP65 tether complex, then such complex would have to fold to form a shorter tether. However, under a variety of tested conditions p115 did not bind giantin and GM130 simultaneously. Specifically, giantin bound p115 but not complexes of p115-GM130, and preformed complexes of giantin-p115 did not bind GM130. Thus, although dimeric complexes of giantin-p115 and GM130-p115 formed, such complexes did not interact with the third possible binding partner. An explanation was provided by the observation that giantin competed with GM130 for binding to p115, suggesting that p115 contains a single site that binds either giantin or GM130. This was confirmed by mapping p115's giantin binding site to its acidic C terminus, the same site used by GM130 (9.Nelson D.S. Alvarez C. Gao Y.-s. Garcia-Mata R. Fialkowski E. Sztul E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 319-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). These observations are not consistent with a straightforward model in which p115 tethers COPI vesicles to Golgi cisternal elements by physically linking giantin in one membrane to GM130 in the other membrane. What, then, is the role of giantin, p115, and GM130 in vesicle transport, cisternae formation, and cisternal stacking? Our observations do not preclude the expected docking roles for each of these proteins. Vesicle transport, cisternae formation, and cisternal stacking each involve membrane docking and would be facilitated by long distance stable linkages. What could be the mechanism underlying the p115-mediated docking mechanism? A number of possibilities could be envisioned. p115 could act catalytically, perhaps to facilitate the bridging of giantin to GM130 by a yet to be identified protein. Alternatively, our results would not rule out a p115 bridge between giantin and GM130 if p115 existed as oligomers. Because the p115 dimer appears to contain a single binding site for either molecule, tetramers or higher order oligomers of p115 could theoretically bind both giantin and GM130 to form tethers. If this were the case, an activity not present in our extracts must be required to drive p115 oligomer formation. Finally, p115 may physically link membranes but in a manner distinct from the proposed model. One possibility consistent with a single p115 site for binding either GM130 or giantin is that the tethering reactions of p115, giantin, and GM130 are mediated by giantin-p115-X and GM130-p115-Y complexes, where X and Y are novel p115 receptors. In this regard, it is interesting that p115 binding to the intermediate compartment may be mediated by an unknown component, since it appears to be independent of giantin and GM130 (9.Nelson D.S. Alvarez C. Gao Y.-s. Garcia-Mata R. Fialkowski E. Sztul E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 319-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). This reasoning raises the intriguing possibility that p115-giantin and p115-GM130 interactions might mediate tethering in spatially or temporally distinct events."

The activity of ROMK is regulated by intracellular pH (pHi) with acidification causing channel closure (effective pK a ∼6.9). Recently, we and others reported that a direct interaction of the channels with phosphatidyl-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is critical for opening of the inwardly rectifying K+ channels. Here, we investigate the relationship between the mechanisms for regulation of ROMK by PIP2 and by pHi. We find that disruption of PIP2-ROMK1 interaction not only decreases single-channel open probability (P o) but gives rise to a ROMK1 subconductance state. This state has an increased sensitivity to intracellular protons (effective pK a shifted to pH ∼7.8), such that the subconductance channels are relatively quiescent at physiological pHi. Open probability for the subconductance channels can then be increased by intracellular alkalinization to supra-physiological pH. This increase in P o for the subconductance channels by alkalinization is not associated with an increase in PIP2-channel interaction. Thus, direct interaction with PIP2 is critical for ROMK1 to open at full conductance. Disruption of this interaction increases pHisensitivity for the channels via emergence of the subconductance state. The control of open probability of ROMK1 by pHi occurs via a mechanism distinct from the regulation by PIP2. ROMK channels are responsible for K+ secretion in kidney.

Recently, cDNAs for the renal K+ channels and splice isoforms, ROMK1, -2, and -3, have been isolated (2.Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V. Hebert S.C.

ROMKs belong to a large family of inward rectifier K+ channels, which also includes the strongly rectifying IRK1, the G protein-gated GIRK1, and the pancreatic β-cell inward rectifier (5.Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). These cDNAs encode polypeptides of ∼300–500 amino acids, which share ∼40% or more amino acid identity and have the common structure of a cytoplasmic N terminus, two hydrophobic segments that span the membrane as α-helices, one pore-forming partial membrane-spanning region, and a long cytoplasmic C terminus. Opening of the G protein-gated GIRK channels requires G protein βγ subunits. Other inward rectifier K+ channels, such as ROMK1 and IRK1, are constitutively open (5.Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar).

Chem. 1996; 271: 9313-9319Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Activation of ROMK channels by PKA underlies the regulation of renal potassium transport by arginine vasopressin (17.Cassola A.C. Giebisch G. Wang W. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: F502-F509PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Wang W. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F599-F605PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we found (19.Liou H.-H. Zhou S.-S. Huang C.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5820-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) that regulation of ROMK by PKA requires PIP2. Without PIP2 in the membrane, PKA phosphorylation is not sufficient to activate the channels. PKA phosphorylation of ROMK, however, enhances channel interaction with PIP2. This study further supports a critical role of direct PIP2 binding in channel function. However, it is not known how direct lipid-channel interaction contributes to channel activation. Recently it was reported that subconductance ROMK channels result from mutation of PKA sites or partial, Mg2+-induced run-down (20.MacGregor G.G. Xu J.Z. McNicholas C.M. Giebisch G. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F415-F422PubMed Google Scholar). Given that PIP2 can reactivate run-down channels and that PKA modulates PIP2-channel interaction, it is likely that interaction between PIP2 and ROMK1 is important for the channels to open at the full conductance. Another important physiological regulator for ROMK is intracellular pH (pHi). ROMK channels are unique among members of inward rectifier K+ channels in having a very high sensitivity to intracellular protons. Intracellular acidification reversibly reduces open probability (P o) of native K+channels in cortical collecting ducts as well as that of ROMK1 channels expressed in oocytes, with an effective pK a value of ∼6.9 (21.Wang W.

This reduction in K+ conductance by acidification plays a key role in K+ homeostasis during metabolic acidosis (1.Wang W. Sackin H. Giebisch G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 81-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The amino acid responsible for the steep pH dependence for ROMK has been identified as lysine 80 (24.Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U. Brändle U. Zenner H.P. Jan L.Y. Ruppersberg J.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 25.Choe H. Zhou H. Palmer L.G. Sackin H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F516-F529PubMed Google Scholar). Substitution of lysine 80 by methionine abolishes the sensitivity of ROMK1 to intracellular protons. It has been proposed that the ability of lysine (with an effective pK a value of 10.5 as a free amino acid) to function as a pH sensor in the physiological pH range requires an acid shift in effective pK a value induced by local chemical environment (24.Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U. Brändle U. Zenner H.P. Jan L.Y. Ruppersberg J.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Consistent with this idea, mutation of threonine 51 in ROMK2 (equivalent to threonine 70 of ROMK1) to either glutamate or lysine results in a shift in effective pK a toward the alkaline or the acid direction, respectively (25.Choe H. Zhou H. Palmer L.G. Sackin H. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F516-F529PubMed Google Scholar). Given the critical role for PIP2 in maintaining a stable open-channel conformation, it is conceivable that changes in PIP2-channel interaction may affect the local channel structure around lysine 80 and thereby alter pH sensitivity. In this study, we first tested the hypothesis that the disruption of PIP2-channel interaction contributes to the molecular basis for the subconductance state. Having found that PIP2 is critical for the stable open-channel conformation, we then examined whether and how PIP2-channel interaction affects the sensitivity of the channels to pHi. Wild type ROMK1 cDNA was in the pSPORT plasmid (2.Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 362: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (822) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of ROMK1 was performed using a commercial mutagenesis kit (Quickchange from Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and confirmed by nucleotide sequencing as described previously (8.Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 19.Liou H.-H. Zhou S.-S. Huang C.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Xenopus oocytes were injected with ∼5 ng of cRNA for the wild type or mutant ROMK1, and giant patch clamp recording was performed as described previously (8.Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar,19.Liou H.-H. Zhou S.-S. Huang C.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Bath (cytoplasmic) solution contained either 100 KCl, 5 Hepes (pH 7.4), 5 EGTA, and 1 MgCl2 (Mg2+ solution) or 100 KCl, 5 Hepes, 5 EDTA, 4 NaF, 3 Na3VO4, and 10 Na4P2O7 (FVPP solution, mixture of fluoride, vanadate, and pyrophosphate) as indicated for each experiment. Inward K+ currents (at −30 mV holding potential, at 23–25 °C) were recorded onto a chart recorder using an Axopatch 200B amplifier, pCLAMP software, and Digidata 1200A digitizer (Axon Instrument, Foster City, CA). Chart recording strips were digitally scanned and analyzed in a computer for presentation. Each vial of anti-PIP2 monoclonal antibody stock (Perspective Biosystems, Framingham, MA) was reconstituted in 0.5 ml of distilled water and diluted 40-fold into experimental solutions to yield a final concentration of 40 nm. PIP2(Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was diluted in water (1 mg/ml) and sonicated to form liposomes (8.Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Dinitrato-1,10-phenanthroline copper(II) (cupric phenanthroline) was from Aldrich. Dithiothreitol (DTT) was from Sigma. Patch clamp pipettes (pulled from borosilicate glass, Warner Institute Co., Hamden, CT) were filled with solutions containing (in mm): 100 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, 5 Hepes (pH 7.4 with KOH). Pipette tip resistance ranged from 3 to 5 MΩ. In some experiments, the pipette solution contained 100 KCl, 5 EDTA, and 5 Hepes (pH 7.4 with KOH). The Mg2+-free, Mg2+-containing, and FVPP bath solutions were the same as for the giant patch recording. Single-channel currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA), low pass-filtered at 1 kHz using an 8-pole Bessel filter, sampled every 0.1 ms (10 kHz) with Digidata-1200A interface, and stored directly onto computer hard disc (20 gigabytes) using pCLAMP7 software. Data were transferred to CD for long term storage. For analysis, event list files were generated using the Fetchan program and analyzed for open probability, amplitude, and dwell-time histograms using pCLAMP7 pSTAT (version 6.0.5, Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Open probability was analyzed on segments of continuous recording (at least 5 min) from patches that contained only one active channel during the lifetime (>20 min) of the recording. P o for full and subconductance opening in the same patch was determined using the criteria of threshold crossing of the current levels assigned for closed, sub-, and full states (i.e. base line for closed, current level 1 and current level 2 for sub- and full states, respectively). The current level for each state was assigned based on visual inspection of a long segment of recording for best fit and comparison with the current peaks in the amplitude histogram. For amplitude histogram analysis, only periods of recordings containing bursts of channel activity were used. Regulation of the ROMK1 inward rectifier K+ channels by PIP2 involves direct binding of PIP2 to a region of the C terminus which includes amino acid arginine 188 (Arg-188) (8.Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Depletion of membrane PIP2via activation of the Mg2+-dependent lipid phosphatases causes a progressive reduction in macroscopic ROMK currents (run-down) over ∼3–5 min in giant patch clamp recording (8.Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 A shows that wild type ROMK1 channels recorded on-cell from oocytes have a near-maximal single-channel open probability (P o = 0.91 ± 0.08, n = 5). The single-channel current-voltage relationship for channels recorded on-cell is weakly inward-rectifying with an inward slope conductance of 36 ± 2.3 pS (n = 5, 0 to −100 mV; not shown, but for similar I-V for channel in inside-out patch see Fig. 5 D). Fig.1 B shows a representative recording (from the same channel in Fig. 1 A) 5 min after excision of the on-cell membrane patch into Mg2+ solution to allow run-down. As described previously by others (20.MacGregor G.G. Xu J.Z. McNicholas C.M. Giebisch G. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F415-F422PubMed Google Scholar), we found that Mg2+-induced run-down caused channels to enter a subconductance state of 16 ± 1.1 pS (approximately 44% of the full, open state). In addition, Mg2+-induced run-down decreased P ofor the full conductance opening. After partial run-down, the subconductance state remained even when recordings were performed using Mg2+-free solution (in mm, 100 KCl, 5 EDTA, and 5 Hepes) in both the pipette and the bath (data not shown), indicating that Mg2+ or other non-permeant ions are not directly responsible for maintaining the subconductance state. Fig.1 D shows an amplitude histogram for a single channel recorded during partial Mg2+ run-down, demonstrating full (labeled O for full opening) and subconductance (labeledS for subconductance) channels with ∼36 and ∼16 pS unitary conductance, respectively. The subconductance state is only rarely observed in on-cell recordings of wild type channels (e.g. <10 ms total open time in a 3-min recording, not shown).Figure 5Intracellular alkalinization increases opening for the subconductance channels. A, single R188Q channel recorded in an inside-out patch (without run-down) with FVPP solution at pH 7.4 (top panel) or FVPP at pH 9.4 (bottom panel). B, mean P ofor the full conductance state (open column) and the subconductance state (shaded column) for single R188Q mutant channel at pH 7.4 or pH 9.4. P o for the sub- and full conductance states was analyzed using pSTAT program as described under “Materials and Methods” and under “Results” for Fig. 2. As shown in Fig. 7 C, P o determined as such correlates very well with the relative distribution of the two states revealed in the amplitude histogram. C, a single wild type ROMK1 recorded in an inside-out patch with FVPP pH 9.4 before run-down (top panel) or reactivated by FVPP pH 9.4 after run-down in Mg2+ solution (bottom panel).D, single channel I-V curves for full and subconductance states determined from records like those in C.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) After complete run-down in Mg2+ solution, application of exogenous PIP2 over ∼1–3 min to the cytoplasmic face of the excised patch restored the open probability for the full conductance state to the level of that recorded in the on-cell configuration (Fig. 1 C). As shown in Fig. 1 C, the subconductance state was frequently observed during this period of PIP2-mediated recovery from run-down. Similar to run-down in Mg2+ solution, application of anti-PIP2antibody (at a submaximal concentration) produced the subconductance state and decreased P o for the full conductance opening (not shown). These results suggest that both the subconductance state and the closed state are favored by disruption of PIP2-channel interaction. Similar to the earlier report by MacGregor et al. (20.MacGregor G.G. Xu J.Z. McNicholas C.M. Giebisch G. Hebert S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: F415-F422PubMed Google Scholar), we also observed a second subconductance state with unitary conductance ∼17% of the full conductance channels during Mg2+-induced run-down. Because of the low amplitude and the low opening frequency, the second subconductance state was not analyzed in this study. Mutation of arginine 188 of ROMK1 to glutamine (R188Q) reduces channel's affinity for PIP2 (8.Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W. Nature. 1998; 391: 803-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). In contrast to the wild type ROMK1 channel which has a high P o for full conductance state and only rarely shows subconductance state on-cell, R188Q mutant exhibited frequent subconductance openings as well as a low P o for the full conductance state in on-cell recording (Fig. 2 A, see below for discussion of the flickery opening). These results suggest that, due to the reduction in the affinity for PIP2, R188Q mutants cannot be fully activated (i.e. highP o for full conductance opening) by the endogenous PIP2 that prevails in the oocyte membrane on-cell. Consistent with this idea, raising PIP2concentration to a supra-physiological level by application of exogenous PIP2 to inside-out patches (in which the endogenous PIP2 was not depleted by run-down) overcame the effect of R188Q mutation (Fig. 2 B). We have previously shown that mutant channels with lysine substituted for arginine 188 (R188K) have normal PIP2-channel interaction, suggesting that the nature of this interaction is electrostatic (19.Liou H.-H. Zhou S.-S. Huang C.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5820-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Here, we also found that R188K, like wild type ROMK1, has a high P oand exists nearly exclusively in the full conductance state (Fig.2 C). The mean open and closed times for R188K were not different from those of wild type channels (τo = 19.3 ± 1.9 and τc = 1.32 ± 0.11 ms for R188K,n = 12, versus τo = 20.8 ± 1.9 ms and τc = 1.40 ± 0.16 ms for wild type,n = 8). The apparent open-channel noise (flickery opening) for R188Q mutants (Fig. 2 A) is higher as compared with that for the run-down channels and remained unchanged even though the low channel activity was reversed by application of exogenous PIP2 (Fig.2 B). Open-channel noise for R188K, however, was not qualitatively different from that for the wild type channels (Fig.2 C). Thus, charge neutralization by the R188Q mutation probably alters channel gating and/or the interaction of K+ion with the pore during permeation, besides disrupting ROMK-PIP2 interaction. The apparent reduction in the mean amplitude for the full conductance opening of R188Q (indicated by abroken line in the expanded-time trace in Fig.2 A) is likely due to incomplete resolution of these flickery opening events. Fig. 2 D is an amplitude histogram for R188Q, showing two distinct peaks corresponding to full- (labeledO) and subconductance (labeled S) states. As above, the current amplitude for the full conductance state appears reduced as compared with wild type ROMK1. The current amplitude for the R188Q substate, however, is similar to the amplitude for the wild type ROMK1 substate after partial run-down. This finding, taken together with the finding of elimination of this substate (but not of the flickery opening) by application of exogenous PIP2, suggests that the R188Q subconductance state is truly resulting from disruption of PIP2-channel interaction rather than an artifact of incomplete resolution of full opening events. Fig.2 E shows that mean P o (for full conductance opening) for R188Q is significantly reduced compared with that for wild type (WT), R188K, or R188Q after application of exogenous PIP2. Thus, the electrostatic interaction between PIP2 and the C-terminal region of ROMK1, which includes arginine 188, is critical for maintaining channel opening at highP o and full conductance. Intracellular acidification leads to channel closure. The critical role of PIP2 in maintaining ROMK activity raises the possibility that pHi regulation may also be modulated by PIP2-channel interaction. In the following experiments (Fig. 3), wild type or mutant channels were recorded in on-cell, giant patches and then excised into a Mg2+-free bath solution that also contained a mixture of the phosphatase inhibitors, fluoride, vanadate, and pyrophosphate (FVPP). This solution prevents run-down of ROMK current probably by inhibiting both Mg2+-dependent protein phosphatases as well as lipid phosphatases thus slowing channel dephosphorylation and membrane PIP2 depletion (6.Hilgemann D.W. Ball R. Science. 1996; 273: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 8.Huang C.L. Feng S. Hilgemann D.W.

As shown in Fig. 3 A, activity of wild type channels (measured as inward K+ currents at −30 mV holding potential) was near maximal on-cell (where the resting pHi is ∼7.32, see Ref. 29.Leipziger, J., Cooper, G. J., Xu, J., Hebert, S. C., and Giebisch, G. (2000) Am. J. Physiol., in pressGoogle Scholar) and was not significantly increased when the cytoplasmic face of the excised inside-out membrane patches was alkalinized to pH 9.4. Subsequent acidification inhibited current in a steep, pH-dependent manner. The effective pK a for inhibition of ROMK1 by intracellular protons was 6.84 ± 0.04 (mean ± S.E., n = 5; Fig.3 C). The PIP2-binding site mutant, R188Q, has low activity on-cell (Fig. 2, A and E) and in the excised inside-out membranes at pH 7.4 (Fig. 3 B). Activity of R188Q was, however, markedly increased when the excised membrane patch was alkalinized to pH 9.4 (Fig. 3 B). Subsequent acidification also caused a steep pH-dependent inhibition of the R188Q mutant channels. The effective pK a for inhibition of R188Q mutant by intracellular protons, however, was shifted to 7.9 ± 0.03 (n = 6; Fig. 3,B and C). As mentioned above, the PIP2 affinity for R188K is equivalent to that for wild type channels, and we have found that R188K displayed pH sensitivity identical to that of wild type channels (effective pK a for R188K: 6.94 ± 0.04, n= 4; Fig. 3 C). These results show that PIP2-channel interaction regulates pHi sensitivity of ROMK such that when PIP2 binding is reduced channels become more sensitive to cytoplasmic protons. The alkaline shift in effective pK a revealed by R188Q is opposite in direction to that expected if Arg-188 itself was acting as a pHi sensor (see Fig. 7 A, below).Figure 7Lysine 80 is the pH sensor for channels with reduced PIP2 interaction.

Zhou S.-S. Huang C.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5820-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Disruption of the PKA phosphorylation sites serine 219 or serine 313 by point mutation to alanine (S219A or S313A) decreases PIP2-channel interaction compared with wild type, although to a lesser extent than does the R188Q mutation (19.Liou H.-H. Zhou S.-S. Huang C.-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5820-5825Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In an analogous fashion, pHi sensitivity for S219A and S313A, like that for R188Q, is shifted in the alkaline direction although to a lesser extent (pK a, 7.3 ± 0.05, n = 3, and 7.28 ± 0.04,n = 3, for S219A and S313A, respectively). Similar shift in pK a by mutation of PKA sites has also been observed for ROMK2 (29.Leipziger, J., Cooper, G. J., Xu, J., Hebert, S. C., and Giebisch, G. (2000) Am. J. Physiol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Thus, disruption of PIP2-channel interaction through PKA site mutation also leads to an increased pHi sensitivity. Sensitivity to pHi is also increased after PIP2depletion by exposure to cytoplasmic Mg2+.

In addition, the PI3-kinase serine kinase autophosphorylates both the p85 regulatory subunit and the p110 catalytic subunit (9.Carpenter C.L. Auger K.R. Duckworth B.C. Hou W.M. Schaffhausen B.

However, it is not known whether insulin regulates this serine kinase activity. In addition to the association with IRS-1/2, p85 has also been detected in anti-insulin receptor (IR) immunoprecipitates from insulin-stimulated cells transfected with human insulin receptor cDNA (15.Staubs P.A.

Thus, the p85 subunit seems capable of binding directly to the phosphorylated insulin receptor although the potential role of this alternative mechanism is unknown. In the present study, using human fat cells, we investigated whether insulin activates PI3-kinase serine kinase. We present evidence that this kinase is activated by insulin through binding to insulin receptors and that PDE3B is a substrate. Bovine serum albumin (fraction V), collagenase, leupeptin, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, wortmannin, and LY 294002 were from Sigma. Radiochemicals were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech or NEN Life Science Products. Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibodies, anti-PKB, anti-IRS-1 polyclonal antibodies, anti-insulin receptor antibodies, and anti-PI3-kinase antibodies (p85 and p110) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) or Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Protein A/G-Sepharose was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride was from Calbiochem. Specimens of human subcutaneous adipose tissue were obtained from the abdominal region of nondiabetic subjects. The biopsies were placed in Medium 199 containing 25 mm Hepes, 4% bovine serum albumin, and 5.5 mm glucose at 37 °C. Adipose cells were prepared according to methods previously described (19.Smith U. Sjostrom L. Bjornstorp P. J. Lipid Res. 1972; 13: 822-824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, adipocytes were isolated by digesting ∼0.6 g of tissue for 50 min at 37 °C in Medium 199 containing 25 mmHepes, 4% bovine serum albumin, 5.5 mm glucose, and 0.8 mg/ml collagenase in a shaking water bath. The study was approved by the Ethical Committee of Goteborg University. Isolated human adipocytes were distributed in plastic vials (12–15% cell suspension) in a final incubation volume of 400 μl. Cells were preincubated with or without 6.9 nm insulin (Novo-Nordisk) for 10 min in the presence of 0.1 μm−N 6-(2-phenylisopropyl)-adenosine and 1 unit/ml adenosine deaminase; immediately separated by centrifugation through silicone oil; lysed in 0.4 ml of lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 25 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 0.2 mm leupeptin, 1 mm benzamidine, and 0.1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride; and rocked for 40 min at 4 °C. Detergent-insoluble material was sedimented by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell lysates (100 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated for 2 h with anti-IRS-1 C-terminal (4 μg/ml) or anti-IR (4 μg/ml) antibodies. Immune complexes were collected with Protein A/G-Sepharose, washed, solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer, and separated using 10 or 7.5% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred from the gel to nitrocellulose sheets and blocked in 5% fat-free milk. The blots were probed with the different primary antibodies (anti-IRS-1 C-terminal, anti-p85 (whole antiserum), anti-PY antibodies, anti-PKB/Akt C-terminal, anti-IR, and anti-p110 according to the recommendations of the manufacturer) or antiserum raised against PDE3B (peptide corresponding to amino acids 423–440 of rat PDE3B), and the proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence using horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The intensity of the bands was quantitated with a laser densitometer (Molecular Dynamics). Quantification was also verified using 125I-Protein A. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed as described by Kamps and Sefton (21.Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) by acid hydrolysis of phosphoproteins in 6 m HCl at 110 °C and separation on thin layer cellulose chromatography plates together with phosphoamino acid standards. For PI3-kinase lipid kinase assays, immunoprecipitates were washed extensively, and the PI3-kinase reaction was performed using phosphatidylinositol as a substrate as described (20.Rondinone C.M. Smith U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18148-18153Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). For protein kinase activity, the immunoprecipitates were first preincubated with or without 100 nm wortmannin, 1 μm LY 294002, or other inhibitors for 30 min as indicated under “Results and Discussion.” The immune complexes were then incubated in 20 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 3 mmMnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ATP, and [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/assay) for 20 min at 30 °C. The complexes were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the products of the kinase reactions were visualized by autoradiography. The degree of phosphorylation was quantified by laser densitometry (Molecular Dynamics). Immunoprecipitates and supernatants were assayed for PDE3B activity as described (22.Manganiello V.C. Murad F.

Samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in a total volume of 0.3 ml containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 8.3 mm MgCl2, and 0.5 μm[3H]cAMP (200–500 cpm/pmol). Human adipocytes were incubated in the presence or absence of 6.9 nm insulin for 10 min; cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-1 or anti-IR antibodies. Immunoblots were probed with antibodies to the p85 and p110 subunits of PI3-kinase (Fig. 1). Insulin stimulated the association of both the p85 (apparently both the α- and β-isoforms) and p110 subunits to both IRS-1 and IR, although the relative amount bound to IRS-1 was ∼3-fold greater than that bound to the insulin receptors. To investigate whether the association of PI3-kinase with the insulin receptor was due to a significant formation of ternary complexes where both p85 and the insulin receptor simultaneously bound to IRS-1, the same blots were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine, anti-IRS-1, and anti-IR antibodies. A small amount of IRS-1 was co-immunoprecipitated by anti-IR antibodies, and a similar small proportion of IR was co-immunoprecipitated with anti-IRS-1 antibodies (Fig. 1). Thus, in agreement with previous reports (16.Levy-Toledano R. Taouis M. Blaettler D.H. Gorden P. Taylor S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31178-31182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Sung C.K. Sanchez-Margalet V. Goldfine I.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12503-12507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), there is a small formation of these ternary complexes in response to insulin. PI3-kinase lipid kinase activity was measured next in the same IR and IRS-1 immunoprecipitates from human adipocytes preincubated in the absence or presence of insulin. As shown in Fig.2, insulin increased PI3-kinase lipid kinase activity associated with IRS-1 ∼20-fold, but no increase was found in the anti-IR immunoprecipitates, although insulin clearly increased the association of both the p85 and p110 subunits with the IR (Fig. 1). In fact, insulin tended to further decrease the already low basal lipid kinase activity associated with the insulin receptors (Fig.2). Because PI3-kinase is a dual specificity kinase, we next examined whether the protein kinase activity was associated with IRS-1 or IR. Fig. 3 A shows an autoradiogram of the cellular proteins in the IRS-1 and IR immunoprecipitates that became phosphorylated in response to insulin. When IRS-1 was immunoprecipitated from control and insulin-stimulated cells, no clearly phosphorylated proteins were visible, although p85 association was markedly increased (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, in the IR immunoprecipitates from cells preincubated with insulin, phosphorylation was increased in proteins with molecular masses of 85, 97, 110, and 135 kDa, respectively (Fig. 3 A). The 85-kDa phosphoprotein co-migrates with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3-kinase and was identified by immunoblotting with anti-p85 antibodies in the same membrane. In addition, the p110 subunit was also identified as the catalytic subunit of the PI3-kinase, and phosphoamino acid analysis showed that these proteins were phosphorylated on serine residues (not shown). Both p85 and p110 are known substrates of PI3-kinase serine kinase (9.Carpenter C.L. Auger K.R. Duckworth B.C. Hou W.M. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1657-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 10.Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Courtneidge S.A. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), so these results are consistent with the presence of this serine kinase in the IR immunoprecipitates. We next studied the effect of wortmannin, which inhibits both the PI3-kinase serine and lipid kinase activities (11.Ui M. Okada T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 12.Lam K. Carpenter C.L. Ruderman N.B. Friel J.C. Kelly K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20648-20652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to determine whether the protein kinase associated with the IR was indeed PI3-kinase itself. The IR immunoprecipitates were preincubated with or without 100 nm wortmannin for 30 min and then assayed for in vitro protein kinase activity (Fig. 3 C). Wortmannin inhibited the insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the 85-, 97-, 110-, and 135-kDa proteins in the IR immunoprecipitates, suggesting that the protein kinase associated with the insulin receptor was indeed the PI3-kinase with serine kinase activity. Similar results were obtained with 1 μm LY 294002 (data not shown). The identity of the phosphorylated p97 band is currently unclear. Although the insulin receptor is a likely candidate, this cannot be the only phosphorylated protein because control experiments showed that insulin receptor phosphorylation was not inhibited by either wortmannin or LY 294002 (data not shown). Several other previous studies have also reported that wortmannin at the concentration used has no effect on insulin receptor phosphorylation or tyrosine kinase activity (11.Ui M. Okada T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar, 12.Lam K. Carpenter C.L. Ruderman N.B. Friel J.C. Kelly K.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 3568-3573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Wortmannin inhibits the antilipolytic effect of insulin as well as the insulin-stimulated serine phosphorylation and activation of PDE3B (2.Degerman E. Smith C.J. Tornqvist H. Vasta V. Belfrage P. Manganiello V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar,4.Okada T. Sakuma L. Fukui Y. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6823-6826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), the key step in eliciting the antilipolytic action, supporting the involvement of PI3-kinase in this action. To examine whether the 135-kDa protein, which became phosphorylated by insulin and was recovered in the IR immunoprecipitates, could be PDE3B, we probed the membranes with anti-PDE3B antibodies. PDE3B co-migrated with the 135-kDa phosphoprotein, suggesting that PDE3B was indeed a possible substrate for the PI3-kinase serine kinase. Phosphoamino acid analysis also showed that a protein of this molecular weight was phosphorylated on serine residues (Fig. 4 A). In addition, sequential immunoprecipitations of cell lysates using anti-IR antibodies first and then anti-PDE3B antibodies were performed, and the proteins were immunoblotted with anti-PDE3B antibodies (Fig.4 B). PDE3B was mainly detected in the IR immunoprecipitate (∼70%), but ∼30% was found in the supernatant. This association did not appear to be regulated by insulin because PDE3B was recovered with the insulin receptor in both basal and insulin-stimulated cells. Consequently, IR and PI3-kinase (p85) were also co-immunoprecipitated with the PDE3B immunocomplexes (Fig. 4 C). To further verify that the 135-kDa 32P-polypeptide was PDE3B, we dissociated the IR immunoprecipitates with 100 mmglycine after in vitro phosphorylation, and the supernatants were re-immunoprecipitated with anti-PDE3B antibodies. The 135-kDa32P-peptide that was phosphorylated by insulin in the IR immunoprecipitates was re-immunoprecipitated by anti-PDE3B antibodies, thus verifying that the 135-kDa protein was indeed PDE3B (Fig.4 D). To further explore the role of PI3-kinase serine kinase for PDE3B phosphorylation, human adipocytes were preincubated with or without insulin for 15 min. IR immunoprecipitates as well as the supernatants were assayed for protein kinase activity in the presence or absence of 100 nm wortmannin using purified recombinant PDE3B as a substrate. Fig. 4 E shows that insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of recombinant PDE3B by a wortmannin-sensitive kinase associated with the IR, presumably PI3-kinase serine kinase. There was no remaining phosphorylating activity in the supernatants of the IR immunoprecipitates in the presence of wortmannin (data not shown). To further corroborate that the kinase involved was indeed PI3-kinase, IR and p110 (PI3-kinase) immunoprecipitates obtained from the same cells, preincubated with or without insulin, were assayed for protein kinase activity in the presence of different protein kinase inhibitors using recPDE3B as a substrate. Fig.5 A shows that insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of recPDE3B ∼2-fold by a wortmannin-sensitive kinase associated with the IR and with p110. This kinase was insensitive to other inhibitors like staurosporine, H-7, and olomoucine, providing further evidence that PI3-kinase was indeed the kinase responsible for the phosphorylation of PDE3B. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that another kinase, co-immunoprecipitated with PI3-kinase, was responsible for the phosphorylation of PDE3B. One such possibility is PKB, which is activated by PI3-kinase and was also recently found to be co-eluted with PDE3B following fractionation of proteins from rat fat cells (25.Wijkander J. Landström T.R. Manganiello V. Belfrage P. Degerman E. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). However, we did not find PKB in the IR immunoprecipitates (not shown). In addition, wortmannin fails to inhibit PKB in vitro (26.Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A. Morrison D.K. Kaplan D.R. Tsichlis P.N. Cell. 1995; 81: 727-736Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1829) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent data (27.Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Kuroda S. Hino Y. Ando M. Kotani K. Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Kikkawa U. Ogawa W. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6286-6296Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) have shown that although PKB can phosphorylate PDE3B, this phosphorylation occurs on serine 273 and not on serine 302, which is the site phosphorylated by insulin in intact cells (5.Degerman E. Belfrage P. Manganiello V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6823-6826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Taken together these data suggest that PKB is not the major kinase responsible for PDE3B activation in response to insulin. To examine whether phosphorylation of PDE3B by the insulin-stimulated PI3-kinase serine kinase in the IR immunoprecipitates was associated with an increase of the PDE3B phosphodiesterase activity, IR immunoprecipitates and their supernatants from cells preincubated with or without insulin were assayed for phosphodiesterase activity in the presence or absence of the specific PDE3B inhibitor OPC3911. Fig.5 B shows that phosphodiesterase activity was recovered in the IR immunoprecipitates as well as in the supernatants. However, preincubation with insulin mainly increased the activity in the IR immunoprecipitate. In the absence of insulin, approximately one-third of the total PDE3B activity was associated with the insulin receptor, and two-thirds remained in the supernatant. However, insulin exerted a major effect in activating the PDE3B associated with the insulin receptor (∼100% increase) whereas only a small increase (∼30%) was seen in the supernatant. These findings suggest that phosphorylation and activation of PDE3B associated with the insulin receptor may lead to the dissociation and translocation of the enzyme to different subcellular sites. Although PDE3B is mainly associated with the plasma membrane (2.Degerman E. Smith C.J. Tornqvist H. Vasta V. Belfrage P. Manganiello V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 533-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) the precise subcellular localization is still unclear. It also remains to be identified if there are other kinases and pathways for PDE3B phosphorylation and activation. For instance, the presently identified mechanism seems unlikely to account for the ability of cAMP protein kinase A to activate PDE3B. In conclusion, PDE3B is associated with the insulin receptor, but this association does not appear to be regulated by insulin. In contrast, insulin increases binding and activity of the PI3-kinase serine kinase associated with the insulin receptor, leading to an increased phosphorylation and activation of PDE3B and, thus, initiation of the antilipolytic effect of insulin. This mechanism is similar to that of a recent report showing that interferon increased the association of PI3-kinase serine kinase with the interferon receptor and that this elicited the phosphorylation of STAT3 (28.Pfeffer L.M. Mullersman J.E. Pfeffer S.R. Murti A. Shi W. Yang C.H. Science. 1997; 276: 1418-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Recently, the role of PI3-kinase lipid kinase and serine kinase activities on intracellular signaling pathways was examined in cells expressing catalytically inactive lipid kinase. Bondeva et al. (29.Bondeva T. Pirola L. Bulgarelli-Leva G. Rubio I. Wetzker R. Wymann M.P. Science. 1998; 282: 293-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) found PKB activation to be dependent on PI3-kinase lipid kinase, whereas MAPK activation was dependent on the protein kinase activity. Another salient finding in the present study is that PI3-kinase activity in human adipocytes is differentially expressed in two key docking proteins involved in insulin's signal transduction cascade: lipid kinase activity associated with IRS-1 and serine kinase activity associated with the insulin receptor. The inverse relationship between these activities is in agreement with previous findings with purified PI3-kinase (9.Carpenter C.L. Auger K.R. Duckworth B.C. Hou W.M. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1657-1665Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 10.Dhand R. Hiles I. Panayotou G. Roche S. Fry M.J. Gout I. Totty N.F. Truong O. Vicendo P. Yonezawa K. Kasuga M. Courtneidge S.A. Waterfield M.D. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) and probably reflects the binding conformation of the protein. Whether this inverse relationship is peculiar to human fat cells or is a general phenomenon remains to be established. Further studies are also in progress to elucidate the binding sites for PI3-kinase and PDE3B as well as to characterize other proteins that are phosphorylated on serine sites by this novel pathway of insulin action.

Recent evidence has indicated that BER in mammalian cells is mediated through at least two subpathways that are differentiated by the patch sizes and by the enzymes involved (5.Forsina G. Fortini P.

These subpathways are designated as “single nucleotide” BER and long patch BER (two to several nucleotide repair patches). The single nucleotide BER subpathway is a sequential multistep process, where β-pol is involved in two steps (9.Matsumoto Y. Kim K.

The overall scheme for the single nucleotide BER subpathway can be outlined as follows: (i) recognition and cleavage of an altered/damaged base by a specific monofunctional DNA glycosylase (a glycosylase lacking intrinsic apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) lyase activity) resulting in an AP site; (ii) class II AP endonuclease incision of the phosphodiester backbone 5′ to the AP site, resulting in 3′-hydroxyl and 5′-2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate (dRP) containing termini; (iii) replacement of the missing base; (iv) removal of the 5′-sugar phosphate to provide a 5′-phosphate for DNA ligation by β-pol; and (v) DNA ligase sealing of the nick (3.Singhal R.K.

These two domains appear to be packed together in β-pol in solution, as revealed by comparison of axial ratios of β-pol (5.0) and the isolated 8- and 31-kDa domains (2.3 and 5.5, respectively) (17.Kim S.-J. Lewis M.S. Knutson J.R. Porter D. Kumar A. Wilson S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 224-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Circular dichroism analysis has revealed that the 8-kDa domain is essentially α-helical in nature (16.Casas-Finet J.R. Kumar A. Morris G. Wilson S.H. Karpel R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19618-19625Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and NMR solution and crystal structures (18.Liu D.-J. DeRose E.F. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Mullen G.P.

The 8-kDa domain of β-pol (residues 1–87), originally characterized as a single-stranded DNA binding domain, is formed from four α-helices. These helices are packed as two antiparallel pairs with 60° crossing between the pairs. Connecting segments between helices 1 and 2 and between helices 3 and 4 each contribute to DNA binding. Helix 3-turn-helix 4, which forms a “helix-hairpin-helix” motif is similar to the helix-hairpin-helix motif that has been found in a number of DNA repair proteins (18.Liu D.-J. DeRose E.F. Prasad R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2488-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Residues of the helix-hairpin-helix motif have been proposed to contribute to recognition and excision of damaged nucleotides in DNA, as well as AP lyase chemistry (23.Liu D.-J. Prasad R. Wilson S.H.

Tetrahedron. 1997; 35: 12057-12066Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Alignment of the helix-hairpin-helix motifs from β-pol and endonuclease III suggested that Lys68 in β-pol may be important in lyase chemistry, because mutation of the analogous lysine residue in endonuclease III, Lys120, resulted in a dramatic reduction in AP lyase activity, and Lys120 has been proposed to be the Schiff base nucleophile in this enzyme (25.Thayer M.M. Ahern H. Xing D. Cunningham R.P. Tainer J.A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4108-4120Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar). In addition, the crystal structure of β-pol bound to a gapped DNA molecule representing a product of the dRP lyase reaction suggested that lysine residues 35 and 68 coordinate the 5′-phosphate that exists in the gapped DNA/enzyme crystal structure (Ref. 26.Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar and Fig. 1). Matsumoto and Kim (9.Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Science. 1995; 269: 699-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar) suggested that β-pol catalyzes removal of dRP from the AP endonuclease-incised AP site via β-elimination, as opposed to hydrolysis, and that this dRP lyase activity resides in the N-terminal 8-kDa domain of β-pol. In the β-elimination, the dRP excision reaction would proceed via an imine or Schiff base intermediate. Fisher et al. (27.Fisher E.H. Kent A.B. Snyder E.R. Krebs E.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1958; 80: 2906-2907Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar) demonstrated in 1958 that an imine intermediate formed between a substrate and enzymatic amino group can be trapped by reduction with sodium borohydride (NaBH4). Since then this chemical technique has been widely used to elucidate reaction mechanisms, e.g. acetate decarboxylase (28.Fridovich I. Westheimer F.H. J. Am. Chem.

In both cases, the ε-NH2 group of a lysine was found to be involved in the formation of the imine intermediate. More recently, NaBH4trapping was used for the identification of imine intermediates in several DNA enzymes: bacteriophage T4 endonuclease V-DNA (30.Dodson M.L. Schrock III, R.D. Lloyd R.S.

More direct evidence that the 8-kDa domain of β-pol catalyzes removal of the dRP group via β-elimination was also obtained by Piersen et al. (12.Piersen C.E. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17811-17815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). These investigators showed that a Schiff base intermediate is formed between the dRP-containing DNA substrate and the enzyme. The Schiff base nucleophile in the 8-kDa domain has been suggested to be Lys72 by site-directed mutagenesis (34.Prasad R. Beard W.A. Chyan J.Y. Maciejewski M.W. Mullen G.P. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11121-11126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 35.Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Katz D.S. Feng J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6456-6464Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). This residue is in close proximity to the 5′-phosphate product group in the gapped DNA/enzyme crystal structure (26.Sawaya M.R. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Kraut J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11205-11215Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar) and is part of the putative dRP lyase active site identified in NMR structures (23.Liu D.-J. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. DeRose E.F. Mullen G.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6188-6200Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) of the 8-kDa domain (Fig.1). Thus, based upon structural and site-directed mutagenesis data, it has been suggested that Lys72 is the preferred but not necessarily the obligatory residue in the dRP lyase active center of the 8-kDa domain of β-pol (24.Mullen G.P. Antuch W. Maciejewski M.W. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Tetrahedron. 1997; 35: 12057-12066Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 35.Matsumoto Y. Kim K. Katz D.S. Feng J.

To understand the precise mechanism of the lyase reaction catalyzed by β-pol and the lysine residue(s) involved in Schiff base chemistry, we utilized the NaBH4 trapping technique in combination with mass spectrometric (MS) analysis. The 8-kDa domain was first covalently cross-linked to a dRP-containing DNA substrate by NaBH4 reduction. We next identified the covalently modified lysine residue by MS sequencing. The approach included proteolysis of the covalently cross-linked protein-DNA complex with trypsin, followed by isolation, peptide mapping, and finally MS and MS/MS analyses of the adducted peptides. Our results, which unambiguously show that Lys72 in the 8-kDa domain of β-pol is the sole Schiff base nucleophile, are discussed in the context of structure of the dRP lyase active site. The acetonitrile and ammonium bicarbonate (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ), trifluoroacetic acid (Pierce), formic acid (Aldrich), and porcine trypsin (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) were used as delivered. All buffers were prepared using water with a conductivity of 18-MΩ (Hydro Service and Supplies, Research Triangle Park, NC). Synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides purified by high pressure liquid chromatography were obtained from Oligos Etc, Inc. (Wilsonville, OR). [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), Mono S and Mono Q (HR 5/5) columns were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The recombinant 8-kDa domain of β-pol was overexpressed and purified as described previously (37.Prasad R. Kumar A. Widen S.G. Casas-Finet J.R. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22746-22755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Human uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) with 84 amino acids deleted from the N terminus was purified as described (38.Slupphaug G. Eftedal I. Kavli B. Bharti S. Helle N.M. Haug T. Levine D.W. Krokan H.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 128-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Dephosphorylated 19-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide (5′-UGTACGGATCCCCGGGTAC-3′) containing a uracil residue at the 5′-end was phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. The 34-mer (5′-GTACCCGGGGATCCGTACGGCGCATCAGCTGCAG-3′) template was then annealed with 15-mer (5′-CTGCAGCTGATGCGC-3′) and 19-mer32P-labeled oligonucleotides by heating the solution at 90 °C for 3 min and allowing the solution to slowly cool to 25 °C. Unincorporated [γ-32P]ATP was removed using a Nensorb-20 column according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. The 32P-labeled duplex oligonucleotide, thus prepared, had a nick between positions 15 and 16. The radiolabeled oligonucleotide was lyophilized, resuspended in H2O, and stored at −30 °C. The 32P-labeled duplex oligonucleotide was treated with human UDG that resulted in the32P-labeled deoxyribose sugar phosphate at the nick. Typically, 50 nm DNA substrate was pretreated with 10 nm UDG in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm dithiothreitol. The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Due to the labile nature of the UDG-treated DNA, the DNA substrate was prepared just before performing the NaBH4 trapping experiment. To prepare the covalently cross-linked 8-kDa DNA complex, the NaBH4 trapping technique was used (12.Piersen C.E. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17811-17815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Briefly, the reaction mixture (1 ml) contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5 EDTA, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, 25 μm 8-kDa domain of β-pol, 5 μm duplex oligonucleotide substrate comprising 0.04 μm32P-labeled DNA to monitor the cross-linked complex, and 25 mm NaBH4. The reaction mixture was incubated for 30 min on ice and then 30 min at room temperature. After incubation, the reaction mixture was precipitated with ice-cold 10% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid. Under these conditions, the free protein and protein-DNA complex precipitate leaving the majority of the free DNA in the supernatant. The protein was then pelleted by centrifugation, washed twice with ice-cold 100% acetone, and air-dried. The pellet was solubilized in 8 murea and diluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, to give a final urea concentration of 1 m. Subsequently, the sample was loaded onto an FPLC Mono Q column (HR 5/5). The bound protein-DNA complex was eluted from the column using a NaCl gradient (0–1.0m), and all fractions were counted for radioactivity. Fractions with peak radioactivity were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. At this stage, the fractions containing the protein-DNA complex were then pooled and digested with micrococcal nuclease (10 μg/ml). The covalently linked protein-DNA complex was precipitated with ice-cold trichloroacetic acid (10%), washed twice with ice-cold acetone (100%), and air-dried. The pellet was solubilized in 8 m urea and diluted with 50 mm(NH4)2CO3 (pH 8.5) to a final urea concentration of 1 m. The protein-DNA complex was further purified using an FPLC Mono S column (HR 5/5). All fractions were counted for radioactivity and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Fractions containing DNA-adducted protein were pooled and concentrated by trichloroacetic acid precipitation. Finally, the protein pellet was dissolved in 8 m urea and diluted with 50 mm(NH4)2CO3 (pH 8.5) to a final urea concentration of 1 m. The high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) purification of the 8-kDa domain-DNA complex was performed by using a Hewlett-Packard Model 1100 HPLC system (Hewlett-Packard, Wilmington, DE) consisting of a Rheodyne 7125 sample injector (Rheodyne, Inc., Cotati, CA) with a 100-μl sample loop, a series 1100 binary pump, a series 1100 diode array detector, and a Bio-Rad Model 2110 fraction collector (Bio-Rad). The column used for the purification was a Vydac C4 reverse phase column (25 cm × 4.6 mm inner diameter). Separations were performed using a linear water:acetonitrile (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) gradient of 10–60% acetonitrile over 50 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions were collected at 1-min intervals and analyzed on a Beckman Model LS 6500 liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Fullerton, CA) to detect the 32P-containing fractions. The HPLC-purified 8-kDa domain protein-DNA complex was reconstituted in 10 μl of 90% acetonitrile and then diluted to 100 μl with 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8). Porcine trypsin (1 μg) (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI) was added to an aliquot of the complex and to a sample of native 8-kDa protein alone (0.3 μg/μl in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0). The reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 3 h. All tryptic fragment nomenclature refers to predicted fragments of the native 8-kDa domain protein. A Micromass Q-Tof (Altrincham, UK) hybrid tandem mass spectrometer was used for the acquisition of the electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra and tandem mass spectra (39.Borchers C. Parker C.E. Deterding L.J. Tomer K.B. J. Chromatogr. A. 1999; 854: 119-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The instrument is equipped with a nanoflow electrospray source and consists of a quadrupole mass filter and an orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The needle voltage was ∼2800 V, the cone voltage was 25 eV, and the collision energy was 4.0 eV for the MS analyses. For the MS/MS experiments, a parent ion is selected with the first mass analyzer and transmitted into a collision cell where fragmentation is induced by collision with argon atoms. The collision energy used for these experiments was 30 eV. The resulting fragment ions were detected with the second mass analyzer. In this type of experiment, only ions resulting from fragmentation of the selected parent ion are observed. Data analysis was accomplished with a MassLynx data system and MaxEnt software supplied by the manufacturer. Samples for flow injection analyses were infused into the mass spectrometer at ∼200 nl/min using a pressure injection vessel (40.Deterding L.J. Moseley M.A. Tomer K.B. Jorgenson J.W. Anal. Chem. 1989; 61: 2504-2511Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For the LC/MS and LC/MS/MS analyses, gradients were formed and delivered using a Gilson Gradient HPLC system and controller (Gilson, Inc., Middleton, WI). The HPLC system consisted of Gilson model 305 and 306 pumps, a model 811C manometric module, and a model 805 mixing chamber. Injections of 2.5 μl were made using a FAMOS automatic injector (LC Packings, San Francisco, CA). A 5–95% acetonitrile (0.1% formic acid) linear gradient over 30 min was used for the chromatographic separations. A flow rate of 0.35 ml/min was delivered from the Gilson HPLC system to an Acurate Splitter (LC Packings, San Francisco, CA), which reduced the flow rate through the column to approximately 200–300 nl/min. The column used was a 15 cm × 75 μm inner diameter Hypersil C18 (“pepmap”) column (LC Packings, San Francisco, CA). The MALDI analyses were performed using a Voyager RP (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA) time-of-flight dual-stage reflector mass spectrometer as has been previously described (41.Barr D.P. Gunther M.R. Deterding L.J. Tomer K.B. Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15498-15503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A saturated MALDI matrix solution (0.5 μl) of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 45:45:10 ethanol:water:formic acid and 0.5 μl of the sample solution were spotted onto the MALDI target. Co-crystallization of the sample and matrix was allowed to proceed at room temperature. To understand the mechanism of dRP lyase catalysis by the 8-kDa domain of β-pol and to identify the lysine residue(s) directly involved in Schiff base chemistry, NaBH4 trapping (12.Piersen C.E. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17811-17815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) was used to isolate the imino complex formed between a DNA substrate and the 8-kDa domain. A duplex DNA (34 base pairs) that contained a solitary uracil at position 16 and a nick between positions 15 and 16 was chosen as a matter of convenience; the uracil-containing oligonucleotide was 5′-end-labeled prior to annealing. Next, the duplex DNA was treated with uracil-DNA glycosylase to create a dRP-containing single nucleotide-gapped DNA substrate. The DNA substrate, thus prepared (12.Piersen C.E. Prasad R. Wilson S.H. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17811-17815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), contained a 32P-labeled dRP flap at the nick (Fig.2 A). For preparation of large amounts of the covalent 8-kDa DNA complex, conditions for trapping the imino complex by NaBH4reduction were evaluated. Results depicted in Fig. 2 B(lanes 1–3) show that when the 8-kDa and32P-labeled DNA were used in varying ratios and incubated with NaBH4 for 30 min at room temperature, little difference was detected in the amount of protein-DNA complex formed. Time course analysis of complex formation showed that a 30-min incubation of the 8-kDa protein and DNA with NaBH4 gave results similar to longer incubations (Fig. 2 B, lanes 4–6). For subsequent large scale preparations, isolation, and purification of the complex, 8-kDa protein and DNA were used in a 5:1 ratio (protein:DNA) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The 8-kDa domain of β-pol contains 15 lysine and 4 arginine residues and has an isoelectric point of 10.3. Hence at pH 8.8, below the isoelectric point, the protein should have a net positive charge, whereas, after cross-linking to the DNA substrate, it should have a net negative charge. This charge difference was used to separate the covalently linked protein from the free 8-kDa protein on an FPLC Mono Q column. Under the conditions used (pH 8.8), free protein does not bind to the Mono Q column and emerges in the flow-through, whereas the cross-linked protein-DNA complex remains bound to the column. The bound protein-DNA complex was eluted from the column using a NaCl gradient. A small portion of each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing radiolabeled protein-DNA complex were pooled (Fig.3, lane 1) and subjected to micrococcal nuclease digestion. Micrococcal nuclease digested the entire length of the DNA except for the covalently cross-linked nucleotide. Because most of the DNA was digested, the remaining protein-DNA complex should have a net positive charge and, hence, should bind to the Mono S column. FPLC Mono S column chromatography, therefore, was used to purify the protein-DNA complex after micrococcal nuclease digestion. Based upon SDS-PAGE analysis, the fractions that contained the protein-DNA complex were pooled (Fig. 3, lane 2) and used for subsequent MS and peptide mapping analyses. Following micrococcal nuclease digestion and purification of the 8-kDa protein-DNA complex by FPLC using the Mono S column, the positive ion MALDI mass spectrum of the complex was acquired and is shown in Fig. 4 A. The mass spectrum reveals ions corresponding to the protonated molecule of the protein-DNA complex at approximately 10,000 Da as well as ions that correspond in mass to protonated molecules of the micrococcal nuclease (ions labeled with an asterisk). Because the protein-DNA complex and the nuclease coelute from the Mono S column, the protein-DNA complex was further purified by reverse-phase HPLC using UV detection (Fig. 5 A). As the DNA contains a 32P label, the fractions containing the 8-kDa protein-DNA complex were easily identified (Fig. 5 B). The native 8-kDa domain protein, as well as the HPLC-purified protein-DNA complex, were then analyzed by both flow injection ESI/MS (Fig. 6) and MALDI/MS (Fig.4 B). The molecular mass of the 8-kDa protein-DNA covalent complex as determined by ESI/MS was 10,010 Da (Fig. 6 B) in comparison to 9467 Da for the native 8-kDa protein (Fig.6 A). The mass accuracy of this instrument with external calibration is 0.01%, therefore, for molecular masses at 10,000 Da, the accuracy is ± 1 Da. These data suggest a molecular mass for the protein-DNA complex of 543 Da (±1 Da) greater than that of the molecular mass of the protein (or less if the protein had become oxidized). Similar results were obtained from the MALD/MS analysis (Fig. 4 B).Figure 5Reverse phase HPLC purification of the 8-kDa protein-DNA complex with UV and radiometric detection. The separation was performed on a Vydac C4 column with a linear water:acetonitrile (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid) gradient as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The UV chromatogram from the separation is shown in A. Fractions were collected at 1-min intervals, and the plot of radioactivity versus fraction number is shown in B.

In order to analyze in more detail the nuclear import of RCC1, we created a fusion construct in which four IgG binding domains of protein A were fused to the amino terminus of human RCC1 (pA-RCC1). Surprisingly, we found that neither Xenopusovarian cytosol nor a mixture of recombinant import factors (karyopherin α2, karyopherin β1, Ran, and p10/NTF2) were able to support the import of pA-RCC1 into the nuclei of digitonin-permeabilized cells. Both, in contrast, were capable of supporting the import of a construct containing another classical nuclear localization sequence (NLS), glutathioneS-transferase-green fluorescent protein-NLS. Subsequently, we found that only one of the NLS receptors, karyopherin α3 (Kapα3/Qip), would support significant nuclear import of pA-RCC1 in permeabilized cells, while members of the other two main classes, Kapα1 and Kapα2, would not. Accordingly, in vitrobinding studies revealed that only Kapα3 showed significant binding to RCC1 (unlike Kapα1 and Kapα2) and that this binding was dependent on the basic amino acids present in the RCC1 NLS. In addition to Kapα3, we found that the nuclear import of pA-RCC1 also required both karyopherin β1 and Ran.

GTPase-stimulating protein nuclear localization sequence N-ethylmaleimide nuclear pore complex green fluorescent protein glutathione S-transferase wild type dithiothreitol RCC1 (regulator of chromosome condensation) plays a critical role in the eukaryotic cell, as it is the only known guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTPase Ran. Ran plays a key role in many diverse nuclear transport pathways (1.Moore M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22857-22860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and both Ran and RCC1 have also recently been implicated in mitotic spindle formation (2.Zhang C.

RCC1 is located inside the nucleus bound to chromatin, except at mitosis when RCC1 dissociates from the chromatin (7.Ohtsubo M. Okazaki H. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1389-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 8.Frasch M. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1225-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The majority of RCC1 consists of seven internal amino acid repeats, and its crystal structure has revealed that these repeats form a seven-bladed propeller (9.Renault L. Nassar N. Vetter I. Becker J. Klebe C. Roth M. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1998; 392: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). RCC1 catalyzes guanine nucleotide exchange on Ran, but unlike many guanine nucleotide exchange factors it shows no preference for catalyzing exchange on RanGDP versus RanGTP in vitro (10.Klebe C. Bischoff F.R. Ponstingl H. Wittinghofer A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 639-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The concentration of GTP in the cell is approximately 30 times higher than the GDP concentration, and this is thought to result in the preferential production of RanGTP inside the nucleus (1.Moore M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22857-22860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In contrast to the nuclear production of RanGTP, the only known Ran GTPase-stimulating protein (GAP)1 is located in the cytoplasm (11.Bischoff F.R. Klebe C. Kretschmer J. Wittinghofer A. Ponstingl H.

Thus, RanGAP1 (assisted by another cytoplasmic protein, RanBP1) will rapidly convert any RanGTP that enters the cytoplasm to RanGDP. RanGTP appears to be required inside the nucleus for the disassembly of import complexes, while export complexes need RanGTP to assemble, and disassemble upon the hydrolysis of GTP by Ran in the cytoplasm (14.Rexach M.

In combination with Ran, two other soluble factors are absolutely required to mediate the nuclear import of a protein containing a classical or basic nuclear localization sequence (NLS) into the nucleus. The first is karyopherin/importin α (Kapα), which binds a classical NLS and then forms a complex with karyopherin/importin β1 (Kapβ1) (17.Adam S.A. Gerace L.

Kapβ1 interacts with nuclear pore complex (NPC) proteins and appears to mediate movement of the import complex through the NPC via these interactions (14.Rexach M. Blobel G.

Another protein, p10/NTF2, has also been implicated in nuclear import, but its function may only be to take Ran into the nucleus, where it is subsequently needed to disassemble an incoming import complex (25.Moore M.S.

Although there is only one Kapα homologue in yeast (SRP1 or Kap60), vertebrate cells contain a number of proteins that can bind a classical NLS and share sequence homology (see Ref. 29.Nachury M.V.

These proteins have been given a variety of names but can be grouped into three major families. The Kapα1 family contains the human protein NPI-1/importin α1/karyopherin α1/Rch2/hSRP1 and a second related protein importin α6, in addition to the mouse S2 protein (19.Moroianu J. Blobel G. Radu A.

Each of these classes share about 50% homology with each other and to the yeast SRP1, and each of these mammalian proteins has been shown to be capable of mediating the import of one or more classical NLS-containing proteins (29.Nachury M.V.

It is believed that this diversity of receptors for a classical NLS in vertebrate cells indicates that an individual NLS-containing protein may preferentially use one or another NLS receptor for its nuclear import, but to date, very few NLS-containing proteins have been tested for a specific binding preference to a single Kapα. Sekimoto et al. (41.Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) however, showed that Kapα1, but not Kapα2, mediates the nuclear import of activated Stat1. Miyamoto et al. (40.Miyamoto Y. Imamoto N. Sekimoto T. Tachibana T. Seki T. Tada S. Enomoto T. Yoneda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26375-26381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) also showed that, to support the nuclear import of the helicase Q1, Kapα3 requires an additional sequence upstream of the Q1 NLS that is not required by the other two Kapαs. Although RCC1 has been shown to contain an NLS that appears similar in sequence to a classical bipartite NLS, many questions remain about its nuclear trafficking. For example, does RCC1 need Ran for its import and which, if any, of the known Kapαs mediate RCC1's nuclear import? Here we show that, when members of the three classes of NLS receptors were tested, RCC1 preferentially bound Kapα3 and was only imported into the nuclei of permeabilized cells when this protein was present. Kapα2 or Kapα1 were unable to substitute for Kapα3 in supporting nuclear import of RCC1, providing additional evidence that the different classes of nuclear localization sequence receptors may serve very different roles in vivo. The pCMVPA2-protein A fusion vector containing four IgG binding domains, as described in Ref.44.Uetz P. Zeller R. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 237: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, was obtained from R. Zeller. Human RCC1 was obtained by polymerase chain reaction from an RCC1 expression vector provided by T. Nishimoto (7.Ohtsubo M. Okazaki H. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1389-1397Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). XhoI and XbaI sites were added to enable direct in-frame ligation into pCMVPA2 vector. For bacterial expression the protein A-RCC1 DNA was cloned into the pRSETB Vector (Invitrogen). The QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to mutate all arginine and lysine residues to threonine (RCC1 mNLS) within the RCC1 NLS region. Briefly, large primers were generated with 14 base pairs of overlap on either side of the target region. Pfu polymerase was used in a polymerase chain reaction-based procedure to create unmethylated copies of the entire plasmid incorporating the mutant primers. The resulting DNA was cut with DpnI and transformed into DH5α. Selected clones were sequenced to ensure accuracy of mutagenesis. The wild type RCC1 was expressed and purified as described (45.Schwoebel E.D. Talcott B. Cushman I. Moore M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35170-35175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Recombinant RCC1 fusion proteins were produced by inoculating 4 × 500 ml of LB-Kan/Amp each with a single colony of pRSETB-RCC1 in BL21(DE3) Rep4 bacteria and incubating at 37 °C shaking overnight. 14 h later the temperature was lowered to 28 °C, and the cultures were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 4 h. Cultures were pelleted at 3000 × g for 10 min in GSA rotor (Beckman) and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.3, 500 mm NaCl, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 20 mm imidazole, and 20 mm 2-mercaptoethanol with 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were lysed with a French pressure cell, and then 200 μg of DNase (Sigma) was added. Cells were centrifuged for 1 h at 180,000 × g in a Ti70 rotor (Beckman). The supernatant was incubated with 1 ml of nickel-agarose (Qiagen) preequilibrated with lysis buffer for 3 h at 4 °C. The column was washed 5 × 20 ml of lysis buffer and eluted with 5 ml of lysis buffer containing 500 mmimidazole. The eluate was mixed with 1 ml of 50% glycerol and loaded onto a Sephacryl S-200 (2.5 × 115 cm) gel filtration column equilibrated with column buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.3, 300 mm potassium acetate, and 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol) and run at a flow rate of 30 ml/h. The eluate fractions containing pA-RCC1 were pooled and concentrated on a 1-ml nickel-agarose column as before. The nickel-agarose eluate was extensively dialyzed against 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.3, 300 mm potassium acetate, 1 mm DTT. After dialysis, the protein was microcentrifuged at 4 °C for 10 min and the supernatant removed and snap-frozen in single-use aliquots. Clones of NPI1, PTAC 58, and QIP1-GST fusions were kindly provided by Dr. Y. Yoneda (40.Miyamoto Y. Imamoto N. Sekimoto T. Tachibana T. Seki T. Tada S. Enomoto T. Yoneda Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26375-26381Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). PTAC 58 was expressed in DH5α cells, while NPI1 and QIP1 were expressed in JM109 cells. The expressed proteins were purified using a modified version of their published protocol. After induction with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 21 h at 24 °C, the cells were lysed in a French pressure cell in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 400 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and the Complete Protease Inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and centrifuged 60 min at 180,000 × g in a Ti70 rotor. After centrifugation the supernatant was incubated with 1 ml of glutathione-agarose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in lysis buffer for 3 h at 4 °C. The column was washed with 50 ml of lysis buffer, and the protein was eluted with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm glutathione (Sigma). Samples were dialyzed against transport buffer (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.3, 110 mm potassium acetate, 2 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm EGTA, 2 mm DTT). was performed exactly as described (45.Schwoebel E.D. Talcott B. Cushman I. Moore M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35170-35175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Inactivation of RCC1 by N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) was also performed as described (45.Schwoebel E.D. Talcott B. Cushman I. Moore M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35170-35175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, RCC1 was diluted in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.3, 100 mm potassium acetate, 5 mm MgCl2. NEM was added to a final concentration of 10 mm from a freshly prepared 1.0m stock in Me2SO. Incubation was for 15 min on ice followed by the addition of DTT (from a 1 m stock in H2O) to a final concentration of 20 mm. The binding of GST-αs to wt RCC1, pA-RCC1, or pA-RCC1 mNLS was performed on glutathione-agarose resin. 25 μg of each GST-α fusion protein was added to 50 μl of resin equilibrated in transport buffer in a total volume of 100 μl and incubated for 1 h on ice. Samples were then microcentrifuged and the supernatant removed. Beads were washed 2 × 900 μl with transport buffer. To the washed beads 150 μl of transport buffer containing 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 13 pmol of either wt RCC1 or pA-RCC1 were added and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Samples were then briefly microcentrifuged, the supernatant was removed and saved, samples were washed 2 × 500 μl of transport buffer, and the washes and flow-through were pooled. Bound proteins were eluted with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm glutathione. All samples were precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid, and an equal amount of the bound and unbound fractions was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and immunoblotted using an RCC1 antibody (45.Schwoebel E.D. Talcott B. Cushman I. Moore M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35170-35175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The nuclear import assay was performed as in Ref. 45.Schwoebel E.D. Talcott B. Cushman I. Moore M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35170-35175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar with the following modifications. GST-GFP-NLS was used as the import substrate and contained the NLS (PKKKRKKV) (46.Moore M.S. Schwoebel E.D. Bonifacino J.S. Dasso M. Harford J.B. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Yamada K.M. Nuclear Import in Digitonin-Permeabilized Cells: Current Protocols in Cell Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York2000Crossref Google Scholar). Samples were photographed and quantified using a Zeiss Axioskop microscope equipped with a MicroMAX CCD camera (Princeton Instruments, Inc.) and the MetaMorph version 4.01 software program (Universal Imaging) with a custom macro written by Scott Monroe of ASI (Chalmette, LA). The recombinant import mix contained 0.3 μm Kapβ1, 1.3–2.0 μm Ran, 0.2 μm p10, and 1 mm GTP in transport buffer. The import substrates were 1.0 μm GST-GFP-NLS or 10 nm NEM-treated pA-RCC1. The GST-Kapαs were used at 0.4 μm. Assays were also performed using Xenopus cytosol, prepared as in Ref. 47.Moore M.S. Blobel G. Cell. 1992; 69: 939-950Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, at 5 mg/ml with 1 mm GTP. All assays were performed for 15 min at room temperature, samples were rinsed three times in cold transport buffer, and fixed for 25 min on ice in 3% paraformaldehyde in TB. For localization of pA-RCC1 or pA-RCC1 mNLS after the import assay, rabbit Cy3-IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) was used after fixation. Because RCC1 catalyzes guanine nucleotide exchange on Ran, we questioned if the nuclear import of RCC1 would follow the standard classical NLS-mediated import pathway (i.e. using Ran) or if a unique pathway exists for the import of RCC1. One complication involved when studying the nuclear transport of RCC1 is its size. RCC1 is 45 kDa, which puts it at the borderline of the so-called diffusion limit of the NPC. Thus, a protein of this size can potentially enter (or exit) the nucleus by diffusion rather than active transport. Seinoet al. (48.Seino H. Hisamoto N. Uzawa S. Sekiguchi T. Nishimoto T. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 393-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) identified the region of RCC1 that appears to function as its NLS in vivo. They also showed, however, that a construct lacking this region is not totally excluded from the nucleus. This indicates that possibly some RCC1 (with its NLS deleted) can enter the nucleus by diffusion rather than NLS-mediated transport. To prevent unwanted diffusion, four of the IgG binding domains (30 kDa) of Staphylococcus aureus protein A were fused to the amino terminus of RCC1 (Fig. 1 A). The protein A tag raised the total size of the construct (pA-RCC1) to 75 kDa and also provided a way of distinguishing it from the endogenous cellular RCC1. To create a control construct that should not contain a functioning NLS (pA-RCC1 mNLS), we mutated all of the basic residues (arginine and lysine) within the RCC1 NLS region (amino acids 8–29) to threonines (Fig. 1 A). We found that the addition of the protein A tag did not interfere with RCC1's ability to catalyze GDP-GTP exchange on Ran (Fig. 1 B), and that the exchange activity of the pA-RCC1 mNLS was equivalent to that of the unmodified pA-RCC1 (Fig. lC). We then examined the ability of pA-RCC1 and pA-RCC1 mNLS to be imported into the nuclei of digitonin-permeabilized cells. We had found previously that RCC1 active for nucleotide exchange will inhibit import of an NLS-bovine serum albumin substrate in vitro when added to the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear envelope (45.Schwoebel E.D. Talcott B. Cushman I. Moore M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35170-35175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We believe this is due to the inappropriate production of Ran-GTP in the cytoplasm, the presence of which inhibits import by disrupting the Kapα-β1 complex and causing the release of Kapβ1 from the NPC (14.Rexach M. Blobel G. Cell. 1995; 83: 683-692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 15.Görlich D. Pante N. Kutay U. Aebi U. Bischoff F.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). We also found previously that the exchange activity of RCC1, and its inhibitory effects on nuclear import, could be abolished by pretreatment of RCC1 with the alkylating reagent NEM (45.Schwoebel E.D. Talcott B. Cushman I. Moore M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35170-35175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Consistent with their ability to stimulate nucleotide exchange on Ran in a filter assay, we found that both the pA-RCC1 and pA-RCC1 mNLS constructs would inhibit the in vitro nuclear import of GST-GFP-NLS that was supported with a complete import mix consisting of Kapα2, Kapβ1, Ran, p10, and GTP (Fig. 2). Therefore, in the subsequent experiments to examine the nuclear import of RCC1, we used NEM-treated RCC1 to avoid the possibility of the exchange activity of RCC1 inhibiting its own import. Surprisingly, when we tested the import of these RCC1 constructs usingXenopus ovarian cytosol as a source of transport factors, we found that, although GST-GFP-NLS (which contains the NLS PKKKRKKV) was imported very well, pA-RCC1 was not (Fig.3). Identical results were obtained when both GST-GFP-NLS and pA-RCC1 were included in the same reaction, with the GST-GFP-NLS being imported very well but the pA-RCC1 remaining excluded from the nuclei (data not shown). As we had already observed that microinjected pA-RCC1 was imported in HeLa cells very well (data not shown), these results indicated that either a factor was missing from the Xenopus cytosol needed for RCC1 nuclear import or possibly the human RCC1 NLS was poorly recognized by the availableXenopus transport factors. RCC1 has what appears to be a bipartite NLS (Fig. 1), and while the Xenopus and human versions of the RCC1 NLS are very similar, they are not identical (see Fig. 7 and “Discussion”) (49.Nishitani H. Kobayashi H. Ohtsubo M. Nishimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 107: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar).Figure 7The NLS region of different RCC1s.

We decided to test a member from each of the three known mammalian classes of Kapαs in the in vitro import assay (together with recombinant Kapβ1, Ran, and p10) to see if one of them was capable of supporting RCC1 import. Kapα1 (human NPI-1), Kapα2 (mouse PTAC 58), and Kapα3 (human Qip) were expressed and purified as GST fusions (36.Imamoto N. Shimamoto T. Takao T. Tachibana T. Kose S. Matsubae M. Sekimoto T.

We found that Kapα2 fused to GST was similar in import activity to untagged Kapα2, indicating that the GST tag was not interfering with a Kapα's ability to support import (data not shown). First, each of the three Kapαs was tested for its ability to support nuclear import of 1.0 μm GST-GFP-NLS when added with Kapβ1, Ran, p10, and GTP (Fig.4 A). We found that all three would support the import of GST-GFP-NLS, albeit with different efficiencies. When added at the same concentrations (0.4 μm), GST-Kapα2 was the best at supporting import of GST-GFP-NLS, while GST-Kapα3 was the worst. When 0.01 μm NEM-treated RCC1 was used as the import substrate, however, only GST-Kapα3 stimulated a significant amount of pA-RCC1 import (Fig. 4 B). The addition of GST-Kapα2 resulted in a small amount of import; however, the import was much less than that achieved with GST-Kapα3. While we found that NEM treatment abolishes most of the guanine nucleotide exchange activity toward Ran, at the same concentration (1.0 μm) we commonly use GST-GFP-NLS in the assay, NEM-treated pA-RCC1 still showed some inhibition of GST-GFP-NLS import. This indicates that a small proportion of the RCC1 was still active after the NEM treatment conditions used (10 mm NEM for 15 min on ice) (data not shown). Because the system we use to detect pA-RCC1 (Cy3-IgG) is very sensitive, we used the lowest concentration of pA-RCC1 as an import substrate that allowed for good detection in the assay (0.01 μm). To directly test their binding affinity for RCC1, the three GST-Kapαs were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with untreated wt RCC1 or the untreated pA-RCC1 (Fig.5). After washing, bound RCC1 was detected by Western blotting with an anti-RCC1 antibody. As shown in Fig. 5 A, Kapα3 bound significantly more wt RCC1 than either Kapα1 or Kapα2. That this binding is NLS-dependent is shown in Fig. 5 B. In this experiment, either untreated pA-RCC1 or untreated pA-RCC1 mNLS were tested for binding to either Kapα2 or Kapα3. As before, only Kapα3 bound a significant fraction of pA-RCC1 and this binding was abolished by substitution of the pA-RCC1 mNLS for the pA-RCC1. This indicated that the binding of Kapα3 to RCC1 is dependent on at least some of the basic amino acids in the NLS region of RCC1. Now that we were able to achieve import of pA-RCC1 in the permeabilized cells with a mixture of Kapα3, Kapβ1, Ran, p10, and GTP, we wanted to determine which components were absolutely essential for RCC1 import to occur. In particular, we were interested to see if the import of RCC1 was Ran-dependent. Shown in Fig.6 A (top panel) is the import of NEM-treated pA-RCC1 achieved with the complete mix. The quantitation of this experiment is shown in Fig.6 B. Leaving out the GTP resulted in bright nuclear envelope staining of the pA-RCC1 but no import. We found that the import of RCC1 was Ran-dependent, as omitting Ran from the mixture abolished import (Fig. 6, A and B). In thebottom panel, NEM-treated pA-RCC1 mNLS was added; as can be seen, no import or nuclear envelope binding was seen with this construct. This result is consistent with Kapα3's much lower binding affinity for RCC1 (Fig. 5) when the basic amino acids in RCC1's NLS region are mutated to threonines. We have shown here that the import of human RCC1 in vitro is mediated most effectively by a member of the Kapα3 class of NLS receptors (Fig. 4 B). We found that import of pA-RCC1 into the nuclei of digitonin-permeabilized HeLa cells was minimal when a member of either the Kapα1 or Kapα2 class was used instead. In column binding experiments, untreated wild type and pA-RCC1 were specifically bound by Kapα3 and this binding was dependant on the basic amino acids present in the known NLS region of RCC1 (Fig. 5,A and B). Our current understanding of the functional differences and substrate specificities between the various members of these three classes of Kapαs is still very limited. Each class of Kapα appears to have a different, tissue-specific expression pattern (29.Nachury M.V. Ryder U.W. Lamond A.I. Weis K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Our data confirm that each class of Kapα has a different capacity to mediate import of a T-antigen type NLS substrate (Fig. 4 A). In the case of RCC1 import, much larger differences were observed. Using pA-RCC1 as an import substrate, Kapα3 showed about 5 times more import activity than the second best Kapα, Kapα2 (Fig. 4 B). At the time this work was performed, this was the first time Kapα3 had been shown to preferentially mediate the import of an NLS-bearing protein. While this paper was under review, a separate study was published by Kohleret al. (53.Kohler M. Speck C. Christiansen M. Bischoff F.R. Prehn S. Haller H. Görlich D. Hartmann E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7782-7791Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which also found that RCC1 was preferentially bound by the Kapα3 class of nuclear import receptors. Additionally, our binding studies indicated that this specificity of binding is dependent on at least some of the basic amino acids present within the NLS region of RCC1 (Fig. 5-B). In a recent paper Sekimoto et al. (41.Sekimoto T. Imamoto N. Nakajima K. Hirano T. Yoneda Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7067-7077Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) showed that Stat-1 import is mediated by Kapα1/NPI-1 but not Kapα2/Rch1. However, activated Stat-1 appears to bind to a COOH-terminal region of Kapα1 that is distinct from the NLS binding Armadillo repeats. The differences in binding of the different Kapαs to RCC1 we have observed here appear to be due solely to the NLS on RCC1 and therefore probably due to the NLS binding region of Kapα3. Kamei et al. (52.Kamei Y. Yuba S. Nakayama T. Yoneda Y. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 47: 363-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) showed that, in mice, the Kapα3 homologue is expressed in many tissues and theorized that Kapα3 may play a role in importing “a limited number of unique karyophilic proteins, such as helicase Q1.” Our results suggest that RCC1 should be included in the group of proteins that use Kapα3 to mediate their nuclear import. We also found that the import of RCC1 is Ran-dependent. How then does newly synthesized RCC1 get imported if it is capable of generating RanGTP in the cytosol that in turn can inhibit its own import? We explored the possibility that the presence of the import factors might inhibit RCC1's exchange activity. However, after testing various combinations of Kapβ1, Kapα3, Ran, p10, and RanBP1, we were never able to demonstrate an inhibition of RCC1's ability to stimulate GDP-GTP exchange on Ran in the filter binding assay (data not shown).In vivo the amount of RCC1 which is synthesized at any one time is probably low enough that it does not create a significant amount of Ran-GTP in the cytoplasm before it is transported into the nucleus, and any that it does produce is probably quickly stimulated to hydrolyze its bound GTP by RanGAP1. Surprisingly, Xenopus cytosol was unable to mediate import of pA-RCC1 (Fig. 3) but was able to support the import of another substrate, GST-GFP-NLS, as were Kapαs of all three classes (Figs. 3and 4 A). Possibly, the human and Xenopus RCC1 s differ enough in their NLS region such that they are not imported efficiently by Kapαs from the other species. Possibly supporting this hypothesis was the demonstration by Nishimoto (49.Nishitani H. Kobayashi H. Ohtsubo M. Nishimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 107: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) that theXenopus RCC1 was not very effective at complementing the hamster RCC1 mutant in tsBN2 cells. The major area of sequence divergence between human and Xenopus RCC1 is at the amino terminus which includes the NLS region (Fig.7) (49.Nishitani H. Kobayashi H. Ohtsubo M. Nishimoto T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 107: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Because the crucial amino acids of the RCC1 NLS (human or Xenopus) have not yet been determined, we can only speculate as to which NLS receptor in vivo mediates the nuclear import of Xenopus RCC1, and no member of the Kapα3 family has been identified inXenopus to date. Further studies are required to answer these questions. We thank Dr. Yoshihiro Yoneda for the GST-Kapα clones, Dr. Ralph Zeller for the pCMVPA-protein A fusion vector, Dr. Manfred Lohka for the GST-GFP-NLS expression clone, Dr. Eric Schwoebel and Ian Cushman for editing and useful discussions, and Qiongshu Xie for excellent technical assistance."

However, signal transduction pathways leading to FGF-2-induced chemotaxis of endothelial cells are largely unknown. Previous studies have shown that the cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine kinase c-Fes is expressed in vascular endothelial cells and may influence angiogenesis in vivo. To investigate the contribution of c-Fes to FGF-2 signaling, we expressed wild-type or kinase-inactive human c-Fes in the murine brain capillary endothelial cell line, IBE (Immortomouse brainendothelial cells). Wild-type c-Fes was tyrosine-phosphorylated upon FGF-2-stimulation in transfected cells, whereas kinase-inactive c-Fes was not. Overexpression of wild-type c-Fes promoted FGF-2-independent tube formation of IBE cells. Tube formation was not observed with endothelial cells expressing kinase-inactive c-Fes, indicating a requirement for c-Fes kinase activity in this biological response. Expression of kinase-defective c-Fes suppressed endothelial cell migration following FGF-2 treatment, suggesting that activation of endogenous c-Fes may be required for the chemotactic response. Expression of either wild-type c-Fes or the kinase-inactive mutant did not affect the tyrosine phosphorylation FRS2, Shc, or phospholipase C-γ, nor did it influence the kinetics of mitogen-activated protein kinase activation. These results implicate c-Fes in FGF-2-induced chemotaxis of endothelial cells through signaling pathways not linked to mitogenesis.

Willoughby D.A. Mol. Med. Today. 1997; 3: 14-23Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In angiogenesis, activated endothelial cells produce proteases that digest the basement membrane of blood vessels, allowing them to migrate into interstitial tissue, proliferate, and finally form lumen-containing, tube-like structures (1.Folkman J. Shing Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10931-10934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Beck Jr., L. D'Amore P.A. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 365-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). These biological responses are tightly regulated by fibroblast growth factors (FGFs)1 and vascular endothelial growth factors, which mediate their effects by binding to specific receptor tyrosine kinases (5.Mustonen T Alitalo K. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 6.Hanahan D. Science. 1997; 277: 48-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (1048) Google Scholar, 7.Friesel R.E. Maciag T. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 919-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). These receptor tyrosine kinases are linked to a number of downstream effector molecules including components of the ubiquitous Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (Ras/MAPK) pathway and phospholipase C-γ. The FGF receptor (FGFR) subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases consists of four structurally related members, designated FGFR-1 through FGFR-4 (8.Partanen J. Vainikka S. Kohonen J. Armstrong E. Alitalo K. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1992; 4: 69-83Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 9.Klint P. Claesson-Welsh L. Front. Biosci. 1999; 4: D165-D177Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All members of the family are composed of an extracellular domain with two or three immunoglobulin-like loops, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular kinase domain, which is divided by an insert region. Seven tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic region of FGFR-1 have been identified as autophosphorylation sites (10.Mohammadi M. Dikic I. Sorokin A. Burgess W.H. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 977-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Of these, Tyr-766 in the C-terminal tail of FGFR-1 binds to the Src homology 2 domain of PLC-γ, leading to its tyrosine phosphorylation and activation (11.Mohammadi M. Dionne C.A. Li W. Li N. Spivak T. Honegger A.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1992; 358: 681-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 12.Peters K.G. Marie J. Wilson E. Ives H.E. Escobedo J. Del Rosario M. Mirda D. Williams L.T. Nature. 1992; 358: 678-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Substitution of Tyr-766 with Phe resulted in slower internalization of FGFR-1, suggesting a function in receptor turnover (13.Sorokin A. Mohammadi M. Huang J. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17056-17061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FGFR-1 is also linked to several small G-protein/kinase cascades. Activation of the Ras pathway has been implicated in both proliferation and tube formation of cultured endothelial cells (14.Klint P. Kanda S. Kloog Y. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3354-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The adaptor proteins Shc and FRS2 are tyrosine-phosphorylated by FGF-2 treatment, leading to recruitment of the Grb2·Sos guanine nucleotide exchange complex for Ras (14.Klint P. Kanda S. Kloog Y. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3354-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 15.Klint P. Kanda S. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol.

Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Activated Ras binds to Raf-1, leading to activation of the extracellular signal regulated kinases Erk-1 and Erk-2 through the intermediate kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase/Erk kinase-1. The farnesyl transferase inhibitor, manumycin, and the prenylated protein methyltransferase inhibitor, FTS, both attenuate tube formation, presumably by interfering with Ras function (14.Klint P. Kanda S. Kloog Y. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3354-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The mitogen-activated protein kinase/Erk kinase inhibitor PD98059 suppressed proliferation of endothelial cells without affecting tube formation (14.Klint P. Kanda S. Kloog Y. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3354-3364Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), suggesting that the differentiation signal diverges above the level of mitogen-activated protein kinase/Erk kinase activation. In addition to Shc, FRS2, and Grb2·Sos, the adaptor protein Crk also binds to the activated FGFR-1 through phosphotyrosine 463 in the juxtamembrane region. Crk in turn recruits C3G, a guanine nucleotide exchanger factor for Rap1 (17.Larsson H. Klint P. Landgren E. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25726-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Substitution of Tyr-463 with Phe disrupts FGF-2-induced DNA synthesis (17.Larsson H. Klint P. Landgren E. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25726-25734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), implicating the Crk·C3G interaction in the mitogenic response. The c-Fes protein-tyrosine kinase is structurally distinct from c-Src, c-Abl, and other nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (reviewed in Ref. 18.Smithgall T.E. Rogers J.A. Peters K.L. Li J. Briggs S.D. Lionberger J.M. Cheng H. Shibata A. Scholtz B. Schreiner S. Dunham N. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1998; 9: 43-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). c-Fes is expressed predominantly in hematopoietic cells, vascular endothelial cells, and some epithelial and neuronal cells (19.Haigh J. McVeigh J. Greer P. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 931-944PubMed Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that c-Fes may play a direct role in myeloid differentiation. Expression of c-Fes in the myeloid leukemia cell line K-562, an immature blast cell line devoid of c-Fes expression, results in growth suppression and terminal differentiation (20.Yu G. Smithgall T.E. Glazer R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10276-10281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21.Cheng H. Rogers J.A. Dunham N.A. Smithgall T.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8335-8343Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This result suggests that c-Fes expression is sufficient for differentiation in some cellular contexts. On the other hand, suppression of c-Fes expression with antisense oligonucleotides interferes with myeloid differentiation in HL-60 promyelocytes, and in some cases, it results in apoptosis instead (22.Manfredini R. Grande A. Tagliofico E. Barbieri D. Zucchini P. Citro G. Zupi G. Franceschi C. Torelli U. Ferrari S. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23.Manfredini R. Balestri R. Tagliofico E. Barbieri D. Zucchini P. Citro G. Zupi G. Franceschi C. Torelli U. Ferrari S. Blood. 1997; 89: 135-145Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, c-Fes may be required for differentiation to occur. c-Fes may regulate differentiation in extrahematopoietic sites as well. Expression of an activated form of c-Fes bearing the N-terminal myristylation signal sequence from v-Src produced a marked increase in vascularity and hemangioma formation in transgenic mice (24.Greer P. Haigh J. Mbamulu G. Khoo W. Bernstein A. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6755-6763Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). This result indicates that c-Fes is involved in vascular development in vivo. However, the precise roles of c-Fes in the regulation of cellular responses by endothelial cells are unknown. In this report, we examined the effect of c-Fes expression on FGF-2-induced proliferation, chemotaxis, and tube formation of IBE cells, a murine brain capillary endothelial cell line (25.Kanda S. Landgren E. Ljungström M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 383-395PubMed Google Scholar). Transfected c-Fes was autophosphorylated upon FGF-2 stimulation, suggesting that FGF-2 may regulate c-Fes kinase activity in vivo. Expression of a kinase-inactive c-Fes mutant interfered with FGF-2-induced chemotaxis of IBE cells, suggesting that endogenous c-Fes activation may be important for this response. In addition, tube formation by IBE cells was stimulated by overexpression of wild-type c-Fes in the absence of FGF-2 treatment. These results indicate that c-Fes is both necessary and sufficient for FGF-2-induced cellular responses by endothelial cells. Anti-c-Fes polyclonal antibody, anti-PLC-γ mixed monoclonal antibodies, and anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (4G10) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2) was purchased from Sigma. Anti-phosphorylated MAPK polyclonal antibodies were obtained from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA), and anti-MAPK polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Murine brain capillary endothelial cells (IBE cells) isolated from H-2Kb-tsA58 transgenic mice (Immortomice) were grown on fibronectin- and gelatin-coated culture dishes in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 75 μg/ml endothelial cell growth supplement (Sigma), 5 μg/ml bovine pancreas insulin (Sigma), and 10 ng/ml human recombinant epidermal growth factor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 33 °C as described previously (25.Kanda S. Landgren E. Ljungström M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 383-395PubMed Google Scholar). Liposomes, denoted TFL-3, -5, -6, and -8, were kindly provided by Dr. Hiroshi Kikuchi (Daiichi Pharmaceuticals, Tokyo, Japan). Empty pcDNA3 (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) or expression plasmids containing C-terminally FLAG-tagged wild-type c-Fes or kinase-inactive (K590E) c-Fes were used (26.Rogers J.A. Read R.D. Li J. Peters K.L. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17519-17525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Dried liposomes were resuspended in sterile Milli-Q water containing purified plasmid DNA (1 μg of DNA/10 μm cationic lipid) and left for 15 min at room temperature. IBE cells (2 × 106 cells/10-cm dish) were incubated with Ham's F-12 medium containing 1.5 μg/ml plasmid DNA for 7 h, and then the medium was changed to a fresh growth medium. On the third day, 0.4 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) was added, and the culture was continued for 10 days. After selection, G418-resistant clones were expanded for analysis of expression of the c-Fes-FLAG constructs by immunoblotting. The cell proliferation assay was performed as described previously, with some modifications (27.Kanda S. Hodgkin M.N. Woodfield R.J. Wakelam M.J.O. Thomas G. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23347-23353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected IBE cells were plated in human plasma fibronectin-coated 24-well culture plates at a density of 1.5 × 104 cells/cm2 (3 × 104cells/well) in Ham's F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and cultured at 33 °C. The next day, the medium was changed to Ham's F-12 medium containing 0.25% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) with or without FGF-2, and the culture was continued for 3 days. Cells were detached with trypsin, and the cells were counted using a hemocytometer. The number of cells in the untreated samples was set to 100%. Chemotaxis assay was performed using Transwell membrane filters (Corning Costar Japan, Tokyo, Japan). Membranes (polycarbonate, 8 μm pores) were coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin. Ham's F-12 medium containing 0.25% BSA with or without the indicated concentrations of FGF-2 was added into lower wells of 24-well plates. Transfected IBE cells were harvested with trypsin, incubated with soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), and washed. Cells were resuspended in Ham's F-12 medium containing 0.25% BSA at a density of 3 × 105 cells/ml, plated on the upper wells (100 μl/well), and incubated for 4 h at 33 °C. Cells were washed, fixed in 100% methanol for 10 min at room temperature, washed again, and stained with Giemsa solution. Cells on the upper surface of the membranes were removed with cotton swabs, and the cells attached to the lower surface of the membranes were counted microscopically. The number of cells counted in untreated samples was set to 100%. Zymographic assay for the determination of secreted PA activity was described previously (25.Kanda S. Landgren E. Ljungström M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 383-395PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, IBE cells were plated in fibronectin-coated 24-well plates and cultured in growth medium for 24 h at 33 °C. Once confluent, the cells were washed with Ham's F-12 medium three times and cultured in Ham's F-12 medium containing 0.25% BSA for 24 h. The medium was then replaced with fresh Ham's F-12 medium containing 0.25% BSA with or without indicated concentrations of FGF-2 and cultured for 24 h. The culture medium was collected and centrifuged to remove cell debris, and aliquots of the medium were electrophoresed in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (10% polyacrylamide) under nonreducing conditions. Gels were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2.5% Triton X-100 and put horizontally on top of a 1.1% agarose gel containing 1.6% nonfat milk (as a source of casein) and 0.12 units/ml plasminogen (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. PA activity was visualized as translucent areas in the white agarose gel. The gels were photographed, and quantitation was performed using the NIH Image program, version 1.52. The intensity of the band in lanes of untreated cells was set to 100%. Tube formation assay was performed as described elsewhere (25.Kanda S. Landgren E. Ljungström M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 383-395PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, IBE cells were cultured between two layers of type I collagen gels without serum or growth supplements in the presence or absence of 10 ng/ml FGF-2 at 33 °C for 18 h. Cultures were photographed under the phase-contrast microscope. IBE cells grown to confluence on fibronectin- and gelatin-coated dishes were growth supplement-starved with Ham's F12 containing 20 units/ml aprotinin and 0.25% BSA overnight, followed by treatment in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml FGF-2 for 8 min at 33 °C. Cells were washed once with Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.5, containing 100 μmorthovanadate on ice and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.02% SDS, 100 μmorthovanadate, and 100 units/ml aprotinin). Clarified cell lysates were incubated with either anti-FLAG M2 antibody, anti-PLC-γ antibody, or anti-Shc antibody followed by the adsorption to protein A-agarose beads. Alternatively, p13suc1-agarose beads (Upstate Biotechnologies, Inc.) were used to precipitate FRS-2. After washing, proteins were eluted from beads by heating in SDS-sample buffer and then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and probed with the indicated antibodies. Antibody incubation was followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG, and detection was through enhanced chemiluminescence reaction (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were stripped of antibodies by soaking in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS and 0.7% 2-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 30 min. For some blots, total cell lysates were prepared by heating the cells in SDS sample buffer, and 50 μg of the resulting proteins extracts were electrophoresed and analyzed. The model system for all studies was the IBE capillary endothelial cell line, which was established from the brains of transgenic mice expressing a temperature-sensitive mutant of SV40 large T antigen. At the permissive temperature (33 °C), IBE cells proliferate, migrate, secret urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), and form tube-like structures in response to FGF-2 treatment. IBE cells express mainly FGFR-1 with small amounts of FGFR-2 and -4, and the signals for FGF-2-induced biological responses require the intracellular region of the FGFR-1 (25.Kanda S. Landgren E. Ljungström M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 383-395PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have established marked c-Fes expression in vascular endothelial cells (19.Haigh J. McVeigh J. Greer P. Cell Growth & Differ. 1996; 7: 931-944PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the expression of endogenous c-Fes in IBE cells, total cell lysates were prepared from IBE cells and probed for expression of endogenous c-Fes by immunoblotting. As a positive control, equivalent protein extracts were prepared from human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells, which have been shown previously to express high levels of c-Fes (24.Greer P. Haigh J. Mbamulu G. Khoo W. Bernstein A. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6755-6763Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, endogenous c-Fes expression was readily detectable in both cells. To examine the role of c-Fes in FGF-2-induced cellular responses of IBE cells, FLAG-tagged wild-type or kinase-inactive c-Fes expression plasmids were introduced into IBE cells, and cell lines were obtained by G418 selection. To verify expression of c-Fes in the transfected cells, anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates were prepared from soluble cell lysates and probed with the FLAG antibody. Fig. 1 B shows the result with two clones expressing wild-type Fes (clones 6-1 and 6-8) and clones expressing kinase-inactive Fes (clones 5-8 and 5-15) that were selected for further examination. The expression of wild-type Fes was consistently lower than that of the kinase-defective mutant in all of the clones examined, although the reason for this observation is not apparent. To determine whether c-Fes tyrosine kinase activity is affected by FGF-2, the transfected IBE cells were treated with FGF-2 and c-Fes proteins were immunoprecipitated and analyzed for phosphotyrosine content by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. Fig. 1 Cshows that wild-type c-Fes was tyrosine-phosphorylated upon FGF-2 stimulation. In contrast, FGF-2 stimulation was unable to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the kinase-defective mutant of c-Fes. These results suggest that c-Fes is activated by FGF-2 treatment and may function to transmit signals for growth or differentiation. c-Src is activated by FGF-1 treatment and is implicated in FGF-1-induced migration of fibroblasts (28.Zhan X. Plourde C. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20221-20224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29.LaVallee T.M. Prudovsky I.A. McMahon G.A. Hu X. Maciag T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1647-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These results raised the possibility that Src family kinases may act as intermediates between the FGF receptor and activation of c-Fes downstream. To test this possibility in a defined system, we co-expressed the kinase-defective form of c-Fes with c-Src in Sf-9 insect cells and assessed c-Src-induced Fes phosphorylation on anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblots. As shown in Fig.2, immunoprecipitates from cells expressing the kinase-inactive c-Fes mutant alone showed no detectable phosphotyrosine. However, co-expression with wild-type c-Src and the related kinase Fyn resulted in potent tyrosine phosphorylation of kinase-inactive c-Fes, comparable to the level attained by autophosphorylated active c-Fes. These results raise the possibility that c-Fes activation by FGF-2 treatment may occur by both direct and indirect mechanisms. Although expression of c-Fes in transgenic animals leads to marked stimulation of angiogenesis, the impact of c-Fes activation at the level of endothelial cells has not been determined. c-Fes activation may affect cell proliferation, PA secretion, cellular migration and tube formation, which together make up the major components of the angiogenic response. We first examined the effect of FGF-2 on proliferation in IBE cells expressing wild-type and kinase-defective c-Fes. Fig. 3 shows that expression of wild-type c-Fes had little effect on the proliferation of IBE cells, whereas the kinase-defective mutant produced a modest but reproducible suppression of growth. We next investigated whether c-Fes influences FGF-2-mediated u-PA secretion by IBE cells. Cells were treated with FGF-2 at both 5 and 50 ng/ml, and u-PA activity in the culture supernatant was examined using a zymographic assay. As shown in Fig. 4, FGF-2-stimulated u-PA secretion was unaffected by the presence of either form c-Fes. This result suggests that signals for u-PA secretion in response to FGF-2 treatment do not involve c-Fes.Figure 4Overexpression of WT or kinase-inactive (K590E) c-Fes has no effect on FGF-2-induced u-PA secretion. Mock, K590E or WT c-Fes-transfected cells were plated in fibronectin-coated wells of 24-well plates in growth medium. The next day, the medium was replaced with Ham's F-12 medium containing 0.25% BSA, and cells were cultured for 24 h. The medium was changed again to Ham's F-12 medium containing 0.25% BSA with or without FGF-2, and the culture was continued for another 24 h. Culture supernatants were collected and centrifuged to remove cell debris, and aliquots of the supernatants were electrophoresed under nonreducing conditions. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2.5% Triton X-100 to remove SDS, the polyacrylamide gels were overlaid on casein- and plasminogen-containing agarose gels and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. PA activity was visualized as translucent areas. Gels were placed onto black paper and photographed. Quantitation of each band was performed using the NIH Image program, version 1.52, and the relative intensity values are shown below the photograph.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next assessed the role of c-Fes in the chemotaxic response of endothelial cells to FGF-2. As shown in Fig.5, FGF-2 stimulated marked chemotaxis of mock-transfected IBE cells in a dose-dependent manner, consistent with previous results (25.Kanda S. Landgren E. Ljungström M. Claesson-Welsh L. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 383-395PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of wild-type c-Fes did not affect the chemotaxic response toward FGF-2. In contrast, expression of the kinase-inactive mutant of c-Fes completely inhibited the chemotaxic response of IBE cells to FGF-2. Previous studies have shown that this kinase-inactive mutant of c-Fes suppresses wild-type c-Fes autophosphorylation in vitro (30.Read R.D. Lionberger J.M. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18498-18503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), suggesting that it may be capable of suppressing endogenous c-Fes activation by FGF-2 in IBE cells. These results implicate c-Fes in FGF-2-induced chemotaxis. In a final series of experiments, FGF-2-induced tube formation was examined using the transfected cell lines. As shown in Fig.6, expression of wild-type c-Fes alone was sufficient to induce tube formation in the absence of FGF-2. Interestingly, expression of the kinase-inactive form of c-Fes did not interfere with FGF-2-induced tube formation as observed above for chemotaxis. This result suggests that redundant pathways exist for tube formation stimulated by FGF-2. Previous studies have shown that c-Fes activates a variety of signal transduction pathways, including the Ras/MAPK pathway (18.Smithgall T.E. Rogers J.A. Peters K.L. Li J. Briggs S.D. Lionberger J.M. Cheng H. Shibata A. Scholtz B. Schreiner S. Dunham N. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1998; 9: 43-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). FGF-2 activates FGFR-1, leading to activation of Ras/MAPK pathway as well, by recruitment and phosphorylation of the adaptor proteins FRS2 and Shc (see Introduction). To determine whether wild-type or kinase-inactive c-Fes influences these FGFR-mediated signaling events, FRS2 and Shc were precipitated from the control and c-Fes-expressing IBE cell lines and analyzed for tyrosine phosphorylation by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 7, FGF-2 induced potent phosphorylation of both FRS-2 and Shc, and these phosphorylation events were unaffected by the presence of either form of c-Fes. We also investigated the kinetics of MAPK activation in each of the cell lines and found that both immediate (8 min) and sustained (120 min) activation of MAPK were not altered by either form of c-Fes (Fig. 7 C). We also examined the effects of c-Fes expression on the FGF-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ, another major substrate for the FGF receptor. Fig. 7 D shows that tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ was equally stimulated by FGF-2 in control cells and cells expressing the wild-type and kinase-inactive forms of c-Fes. In addition, both PI3K activity and Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation were unaffected by the presence of c-Fes in these cells (data not shown). These data indicate that the effects of c-Fes on IBE cell chemotaxis and tube formation involve a mechanism independent of the mitogenic pathways known to be activated by c-Fes in other systems (see under “Discussion”). In this report, we show for the first time that the nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase encoded by the c-fes proto-oncogene plays a role in FGF-2-induced angiogenic responses in cultured vascular endothelial cells. Overexpression of wild-type c-Fes in IBE capillary endothelial cells was sufficient to induce tube formation in the absence of FGF-2. On the other hand, expression of a kinase-defective mutant of c-Fes completely blocked FGF-2-induced chemotaxis, suggesting that activation of endogenous c-Fes may be required for this FGF-2 response. In contrast, neither wild-type nor kinase-defective c-Fes markedly influenced the proliferative response of IBE cells or expression of u-PA. These results suggest that c-Fes may be responsible for generating signals for cellular movement and differentiation and are consistent with previous data showing that expression of a membrane-targeted form of c-Fes results in hypervascularization in transgenic mice (24.Greer P. Haigh J. Mbamulu G. Khoo W. Bernstein A. Pawson T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6755-6763Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). At the molecular level, we observed that FGF-2 was able to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of c-Fes in the transfected IBE cells. One mechanism to explain these data involves recruitment of c-Fes to the activated receptor and stimulation of c-Fes autophosphorylation. Other studies have shown that autophosphorylation of c-Fes on Tyr-713 within its kinase domain activation loop is essential for full kinase activity and substrate phosphorylation (31.Hjermstad S.J. Briggs S.D. Smithgall T.E. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2283-2292PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, we also observed that Src kinases strongly phosphorylate a kinase-defective form of c-Fes in Sf-9 cells (Fig. 2). This result suggests that activation of c-Fes may occur downstream of FGF-2-induced Src family kinase activation. Other work from our laboratory has shown that the Src family kinase inhibitor PP1, as well as overexpression of kinase-inactive c-Src, inhibited chemotaxis toward FGF-2 by IBE cells. 2T. Shono, H. Kanetake, and S. Kanda, submitted for publication. Together with the strong phosphorylation of c-Fes by Src family kinases reported here, these results point to c-Fes as a downstream substrate and effector for Src family kinases in some FGF-2-intiated angiogenic signals. We also investigated whether signaling pathways known to be activated by FGF-2 are affected by overexpression of wild-type or kinase-inactive c-Fes in IBE cells. One major substrate for FGFR-1 is PLC-γ, which binds through its Src homology 2 domain to the activated receptor via Tyr(P)-766. Although substitution of FGFR-1 Tyr-766 with Phe blocks recruitment and activation of PLC-γ, this receptor mutant still retains the ability to transduce signals for chemotaxis (32.Landgren E. Klint P. Yokote K. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In this study, overexpression of both wild-type and kinase inactive c-Fes had no effect on tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ in response to FGF-2 treatment. This result also supports the idea that PLC-γ is not involved in FGF-2-induced cellular migration. Other studies have shown that both wortmannin and LY294002, which are potent inhibitors of PI3K, inhibit chemotaxis of porcine aortic endothelial cells (32.Landgren E. Klint P. Yokote K. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 283-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, we observed that LY294002 inhibited PDGF-BB-induced chemotaxis but not FGF-2-induced chemotaxis in both control and c-Fes-expressing IBE cells (data not shown). Although c-Fes has been shown to activate PI3K in other systems (33.Izuhara K. Feldman R.A. Greer P. Hanada N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18623-18629Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this result suggests that activation of PI3K is not required for FGF-2-induced chemotaxis of IBE cells. We also looked at signaling molecules that have been implicated in c-Fes signaling in fibroblast transformation systems, including the Ras/MAPK pathway and Stat3 activation (34.Li J. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13828-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 35.Nelson K. Rogers J.A. Bowman T.L. Jove R. Smithgall T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7072-7077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These pathways were unaffected under conditions in which wild-type or kinase-defective c-Fes produced biological effects on FGF-2-dependent responses in IBE cells. Taken together, these data suggest that c-Fes signals for angiogenesis in vascular endothelial cells are distinct from the mitogenic pathways known to be stimulated in fibroblasts transformed by activated forms of c-Fes (e.g. PI3K pathway, Stat3 activation, and small G protein/MAPK pathways). Similar findings have been made in macrophage cell lines overexpressing c-Fes. In these studies, phosphorylation of p130 Cas and other proteins related to cellular adhesion and cell-cell contact have been reported in the absence of phosphorylation of signaling molecules related to proliferation (36.Areces L.B. Sbarba P.D. Jucker M. Stanley E.R. Feldman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4606-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 37.Jucker M. McKenna K. Da Silva A.J. Rudd C.E. Feldman R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2104-2109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In conclusion, this study provides evidence that c-Fes is a novel downstream signaling molecule in FGF-2-regulated angiogenesis, affecting both chemotaxis and tube formation. Future studies will address the specific downstream signaling molecules activated by c-Fes in endothelial cells; identification of such molecules will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying FGF-2-induced angiogenic responses.

By using a micropipette method, we measured the kinetics of human Fcγ receptor III (CD16) interacting with IgG when the two molecules were bound to apposing cellular membranes. CD16 is one of only four eukaryotic receptors known to exist natively in both the transmembrane (TM, CD16a) and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI, CD16b) isoforms. The biological significance of this anchor isoform coexistence is not clear. Here we showed that the anchor influenced kinetic rates; compared with CD16a-TM, CD16a-GPI bound faster and with higher affinities to human and rabbit IgGs but slower and with lower affinity to murine IgG2a. The same differential affinity patterns were observed using soluble IgG ligands. A monoclonal antibody bound CD16a-GPI with higher affinity than CD16a-TM, whereas another monoclonal antibody reacted strongly with CD16a-TM but weakly with CD16a-GPI. No major differential glycosylation between the two CD16a isoforms was detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. We suggest a conformational difference as the mechanism underlying the observed anchor effect, as it cannot be explained by the differing diffusivity, flexibility, orientation, height, distribution, or clustering of the two molecules on the cell membrane.

The anchor can influence the function of a receptor. TM anchors of some receptors carry information for protein internalization and subunit association, whereas those of other receptors transduce signals (3.Klausner R.D. Sitia R.

The GPI moiety consists of a glycan core sandwiched between ethanolamine and a lipid tail. Ethanolamine is covalently attached to the carboxyl terminus of the protein by an amide bond, whereas the lipid tail directly inserts into the outer leaflet of the membrane but does not cross the bilayer (5.Ferguson M.A. Homans S.W.

The GPI anchor has been implicated in facilitating the lateral mobility of the protein on the cell surface (6.Zhang F. Crise B. Su B. Hou Y. Rose J.K. Bothwell A. Jacobson K. J.

Immunol. 1989; 143: 1274-1277PubMed Google Scholar). The physiological significance of this coexistence of two distinct membrane anchor isoforms for the same receptor is not clear.CD16 is a 50–80-kDa highly glycosylated cell surface receptor for monomeric IgG (see Ref. 22.$$$$$$ ref data missingGoogle Scholar and references cited therein). CD16b is polymorphic with the two alleles being termed neutrophil alloantigen 1 (NA1) and 2 (NA2). CD16a and CD16b are products of two highly homologous genes, and their 191 amino acid extracellular domains differ by only 6 amino acids (Fig. 1). CD16b lacks the 20-amino acid TM segment as well as the 25-amino acid cytoplasmic domain of CD16a. In addition, the surface expression of CD16a requires associated subunits, such as the γ chain of the Fc receptor or the ζ chain of the T cell receptor, which form a homo- (γ-γ or ζ-ζ) or hereto (γ-ζ)-dimer in complex with CD16a (Fig. 1). Binding of antigen-constrained IgGs brings about cross-linking of CD16, which can trigger a variety of immune functions, including immune complex clearance, phagocytosis, antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, release of inflammatory mediators, and enhancement of antigen presentation.Ligand binding of CD16 can be influenced by a number of factors. CD16a on NK cells binds monomeric human IgG (hIgG) with higher affinity than CD16b on neutrophils (23.Vance B.A. Huizinga T.W. Wardwell K. Guyre P.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6429-6439PubMed Google Scholar). It is not known, however, to what degree this differing affinity is due to the differences in the extracellular domain, in the membrane anchor, or in the cellular background of the two membrane isoforms. The two alleles of CD16b, which differ by four amino acids and two glycosylation sites in the ectodomain (Fig. 1), have the same affinity for hIgG1 complex but different affinities for hIgG3 complex (24.Nagarajan S. Chesla S. Cobern L. Anderson P. Zhu C. Selvaraj P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25762-25770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). NK cell CD16a has a higher affinity for hIgG than monocyte CD16a despite the fact that the two proteins have an identical polypeptide core, suggesting that glycosylation can influence CD16a's affinity for the ligand (25.Edberg J.C. Kimberly R.P. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3849-3857PubMed Google Scholar). Miller et al. (26.Miller K.L. Duchemin A.M. Anderson C.L. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2227-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) reported higher affinity for murine IgG2a (mIgG2a) of CD16a than of CD16a-GPI, a molecule created by replacing the TM and cytoplasmic domains of CD16a with a GPI anchor (27.Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1989; 342: 805-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). These authors suggested an affinity-enhancing role for the associated γ chain of CD16a.In the present work we quantified the kinetic rates and binding affinity of CD16-IgG interaction using a recently developed micropipette method. We asked whether the membrane anchor (including the associated subunits) itself had any influence on these intrinsic binding parameters. We further asked what mechanisms might cause such differences and what role the associated γ or ζ subunit might play.Our micropipette method determines reaction kinetics between CD16 and IgG when the two molecules are bound to apposing surfaces as in the case of cell-cell adhesion, i.e. two-dimensional or solid-state binding kinetic rates (28.Chesla S.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1553-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Only recently have such measurements become experimentally possible, and relatively little data exist in the literature (28.Chesla S.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1553-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar, 29.Kaplanski G. Farnarier C. Tissot O. Pierres A. Benoliel A. Alessi M.C. Kaplanski S. Bongrand P. Biophys.

Here we report the systematic measurements of forward and reverse rate constants of two human CD16 membrane isoforms interacting with human, rabbit, and murine IgGs.The micropipette method mechanically assays the chemistry of receptor-ligand binding at the level of a single pair of cells and, most frequently, at the level of a single pair of molecules. To determine whether the membrane anchor effect, if detected, was dependent on the two-dimensional nature of the experiment or on the specific technique used, we also measured binding affinities of the same CD16-expressing CHO cells for soluble IgGs from the same species,i.e. three-dimensional affinity, by a conventional competitive inhibition method.Our data show that, in comparison to CD16a-TM, CD16a-GPI bound with faster forward rates and higher affinities to hIgG and rabbit IgG (RbIgG) but with a slower forward rate and a lower affinity to mIgG2a. Thus, the membrane anchor of CD16 influenced its ligand binding kinetic rates and affinity, and the qualitative trend of such an effect was inverted when the ligand was changed. Furthermore, this effect exhibited the same pattern regardless whether binding was measured with membrane-bound ligands using the micropipette method or with fluid-phase ligands via competitive inhibition. The findings that the anchor effect flipped with different ligands and that the same results were observed in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional studies are important. They enabled us to rule out the following six possible mechanisms for the membrane anchor effect: differing lateral diffusivity, rotational flexibility, molecular orientation, binding site height, surface distribution, and functional clustering of the two molecules. Furthermore, no major differential glycosylation between the two CD16a isoforms was found by SDS-PAGE analysis. We hypothesize that there is a conformational difference between the two CD16a isoforms that causes the observed anchor effects. This proposed mechanism was supported by the finding that whereas an anti-CD16 monoclonal antibody (mAb) bound with higher affinity for CD16a-GPI than CD16a-TM, another mAb reacted strongly with CD16a-TM but only weakly with CD16a-GPI, suggesting that an antigenic epitope was down-regulated after the membrane anchor of CD16a had been changed from TM to GPI.DISCUSSIONA major goal of the present work was to compare the two-dimensional binding kinetics and affinities of two human CD16a membrane anchor isoforms for the Fc domain of IgG. Since adhesion of Fc receptor-expressing leukocytes to IgG-coated targets is an initiating step for many immune responses, the determination of CD16-IgG kinetic rate constants is important in both biological and clinical settings. Unlike typical hormone receptors that bind soluble ligands (i.e. three-dimensional binding kinetics), adhesion receptors bind membrane-bound ligands (i.e. two-dimensional adhesion kinetics). Clearly, it is the two-dimensional, rather than the three-dimensional, kinetic rate constants that are most relevant to physiological situations such as adhesion of a CD16a-expressing NK cell or macrophage to an antibody-coated target cell. Although two-dimensional adhesion kinetic rates are of obvious importance, their determination has not been possible experimentally until very recently due to a lack of methodology. Our micropipette method is one of only three existing approaches in the literature available to measure two-dimensional kinetic rates, compares favorably to the other two flow-based methods (29.Kaplanski G.

J. 1998; 75: 1553-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The results summarized in Table I expand our original data on the two-dimensional kinetic rates of CD16a-TM binding to hIgG and RbIgG (28.Chesla S.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1553-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar).By applying this newly developed method, we attempted to address the following biological questions. Did the membrane anchor (including the associated subunits) influence the kinetic rates? If so, what might be the mechanisms causing the observed changes? To address these questions, we isolated the effects of the extracellular domain and the membrane anchor using the lipid-anchored CD16a-GPI construct. CHO cell transfectants were used to obtain a uniform cellular background across the CD16 membrane isoforms expressed. Under these conditions, the membrane anchor effect was clearly revealed by the micropipette experiment (Fig. 5). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental demonstration of the membrane anchor effect on the kinetic rates.We also measured three-dimensional binding for the same interacting molecules (Fig. 7) in order to elucidate the mechanism underlying the observed anchor effect. Because much work is available in the literature on three-dimensional CD16-IgG interactions, comparison to those helps validate our two-dimensional measurements and strengthen our conclusions. Indeed, the same trends for affinities were seen in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional measurements, indicating that the micropipette method is adequate for measuring structure-function relationship of cell-bound receptors.Comparison to Published ResultsVance et al. (23.Vance B.A. Huizinga T.W. Wardwell K. Guyre P.M. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6429-6439PubMed Google Scholar) reported a higher three-dimensional binding affinity for monomeric hIgG of CD16a on NK cells (3–10 × 106m−1) than of CD16b on neutrophils (value not determined). The former is therefore referred to as an intermediate affinity receptor, whereas the latter is considered as a low affinity receptor. It was not demonstrated, however, to what degree this differing affinity was due to the differences in the extracellular domain, in the membrane anchor, or in the cellular background of the two membrane isoforms. On the other hand, Tamm et al. (37.Tamm A. Kister A. Nolte K.U. Gessner J.E. Schmidt R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3659-3666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) reported a similar three-dimensional avidity of CD16a-GPI and CD16bNA2, both expressed on a human embryonic kidney cell line 293, for heat-aggregated hIgG1 (∼20 × 106m−1). These authors suggested that the minor differences in the ectodomains of the two molecules (Fig. 1,a and b) would not affect their affinity, although their data showed an ∼2-fold higher avidity of CD16a-GPI than CD16b for dimeric hIgG1 (3.7 and 2.1 × 106m−1, respectively). We found that in our CHO cell system using hIgG and RbIgG, CD16a-GPI showed consistently higher affinity than CD16a-TM in both two-dimensional (Table I) and three-dimensional (Table II) binding studies. Furthermore, repeated side-by-side experiments reproducibly showed that the order of three-dimensional affinities for hIgG, hIgG1, and RbIgG was CD16a-GPI > CD16a-TM > CD16bNA1 ∼ CD16bNA2 (Table II and data not shown). The discrepancies in the absolute values of three-dimensional affinities measured by the different laboratories might be due to cell type-specific glycosylation of CD16 (25.Edberg J.C. Kimberly R.P. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 3849-3857PubMed Google Scholar). However, our data were obtained using the same CHO cells to express various CD16 membrane isoforms. Our results appeared to indicate that in comparison to CD16a, the variations in the extracellular domains of the two CD16b alleles (Fig. 1, aand b), although very small, did significantly reduce their affinities for hIgG and RbIgG (Table II) and for hIgG1 (data not shown). This is not surprising, as two independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (resulting in amino acid changes Leu-48 to Arg-48 or His-48 and Val-176 to Phe-176) in CD16a have been reported to alter the affinity of IgG binding (42.de Haas M. Koene H.R. Kleijer M. de Vries E. Simsek S. van Tol M.J. Roos D. von dem Borne A.E. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 3948-3955Google Scholar, 43.Wu J. Edberg J.C. Redecha P.B. Bansal V. Guyre P.M. Coleman K. Salmon J.E. Kimberly R.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1059-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). The CD16a-TM and CD16a-GPI molecules used in the present study do not have these polymorphic variations (27.Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1989; 342: 805-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), as confirmed by sequencing during subcloning of the CD16a-TM cDNA into the pcDNA3 vector.Possible Role of the Associated SubunitsMiller et al. (26.Miller K.L. Duchemin A.M. Anderson C.L. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2227-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) suggested that the associated γ chain could enhance the ligand binding affinity of FcγR. They reported at least an order of magnitude higher three-dimensional affinity of CD16a-TM than CD16a-GPI for mIgG2a. The affinity of CD16a-TM for mIgG2a obtained by these authors (12 × 106m−1) is much higher than our value, which may be due to the differences in the cells and/or the γ chain used. Miller et al. (26.Miller K.L. Duchemin A.M. Anderson C.L. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2227-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) used monkey kidney COS cells to express transiently human CD16a-TM in association with human γ chain. By comparison, we used stably transfected CHO cells to express human CD16a-TM in association with rat γ chain. Furthermore, Miller et al. (26.Miller K.L. Duchemin A.M. Anderson C.L. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2227-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) employed direct Scatchard analysis, whereas we used indirect competitive inhibition to measure affinity. Nevertheless, we found the same trend as Milleret al. (26.Miller K.L. Duchemin A.M. Anderson C.L. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 2227-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) that CD16a-TM had higher affinity than CD16a-GPI for mIgG2a (Fig. 7 c and Table II).However, we found that this effect was ligand-dependent. For CLBFcgran-1, hIgG, and RbIgG, the trend inverted, with CD16a-TM having lower affinity than CD16a-GPI (Figs. 6 and 7, a andb). These three-dimensional results were supported by those of the two-dimensional micropipette experiments (Fig. 5), which involved direct visualization of over 20,000 controlled single cell pair adhesion tests. In addition, affinity measurements showed that the chimeric molecules CD16a-γ and CD16a-ζ bound similarly to CD16a-TM but differently from CD16a-GPI for all ligands tested, including IgGs from three species and a mAb (Table II). Thus, our findings indicate that the role of the associated subunit, if it is indeed the cause of the anchor effect, is not limited to the γ chain but also includes the ζ chain. Moreover, their putative role is not to enhance, but rather to alter, the ligand binding affinity.The Difference in Ligand Binding Kinetic Rates and Affinity of CD16 Isoforms Cannot Be Explained by Their Differing DiffusivitiesThe GPI-anchored CD16 molecules (including both alleles of CD16b and the CD16a-GPI) exhibit a few folds faster translational diffusion on the CHO cell membrane than TM-anchored CD16a as determined by preliminary fluorescence recovery after photobleaching measurements (data not shown). In addition, the GPI anchor is likely to provide more flexibility to the ectodomain of the receptor, which increases its rotational diffusion coefficient, a parameter more relevant to enhancing two-dimensional binding than the translational diffusion coefficient. One should therefore consider whether the faster binding of CD16a-GPI than CD16a-TM to hIgG and RbIgG could be explained by the diffusional difference of the two membrane anchor isoforms. However, the following three lines of reasoning argue against this explanation and allow us to rule it out as the cause for the different kinetic rates of CD16 anchor isoforms.First, faster diffusion of CD16a-GPI cannot explain the observed effect of the GPI anchor on the forward, and the lack thereof on the reverse, rate constants (Fig. 5 and Table I). Existing theories have shown that diffusion influences k f and k rsimilarly but not K a =k f/k r, since the diffusion effects on the two rates cancel each other in the ratio (44.Bell G.I. Science. 1978; 200: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (3365) Google Scholar, 45.Lauffenburger D.A. Linderman J.J. Receptors: Models for Binding, Trafficking, and Signaling. Oxford University Press, New York1993Google Scholar). Second, the anchor effect was seen not only in the two-dimensional micropipette experiment, but also in the three-dimensional binding assays (Figs. 6 and 7 as well as Table II) where identical but soluble ligands and the same CD16-expressing CHO cells were examined. Diffusion should not affect the three-dimensional results not only because it was the ratio K a, not k f ork r separately, that was measured but also because diffusion is unlikely to be the rate-limiting step in the two-step binding process (the other step being intrinsic reaction). The diffusivity of proteins in fluid phase (>10 μm2/s) is usually orders of magnitude greater than cell surface proteins (45.Lauffenburger D.A. Linderman J.J. Receptors: Models for Binding, Trafficking, and Signaling. Oxford University Press, New York1993Google Scholar). Finally, the diffusion mechanism cannot explain the inversion of the anchor effect; the faster diffusing CD16a-GPI bound with slower forward rate and lower affinity to mIgG2a than CD16a-TM (Figs. 5 cand 7 c as well as Tables I and II). This negative correlation between diffusion coefficient and forward rate/binding affinity provides direct and definitive experimental proof for the inability of the differing diffusivities to account for the CD16a anchor effect on kinetic rates and affinity.We should point out that in the micropipette experiment accumulation of receptors in the contact area by lateral diffusion is unlikely. The diffusion coefficients for various CD16 isoforms on CHO cells are of the order of 0.01 μm2/s (data not shown). The longest contact time in the micropipette experiments was 20 s, which was far from sufficient for the receptors to accumulate in an apparent contact area of ∼3 μm2. Furthermore, only a few bonds were formed in an adhesion produced by the controlled contact in the micropipette experiments (28.Chesla S.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1553-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar), which is a negligibly small number comparing to the hundreds and thousands of receptors in the contact area. This will not generate any appreciable density gradient of free receptors to drive them to diffuse into the contact area.The Difference in Ligand Binding Kinetic Rates and Affinity of CD16 Isoforms Cannot Be Explained by Their Differing Orientations and LengthsThe lack of TM and cytoplasmic domains as well as the associated subunits of the CD16a-GPI may alter the orientation of its extracellular domain. Moreover, the GPI moiety may extend the Fc binding epitope further outward relative to the glycocalyx (Fig. 1). The length of a receptor has been demonstrated to influence its ability to support adhesion at 4 °C (but the effect diminished at higher temperatures) (46.Chan P.-Y. Springer T.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and under flow (but not static) conditions (47.Patel K.D. Nollert M.U. McEver R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1893-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). It is thought that a longer and more flexible molecule can explore larger space above the membrane and assume more spatial configurations. This lengthens the interaction range of the receptor, thereby facilitating its effort to find the ligand when it is surface-linked (48.Wong J.Y. Kuhl T.L. Israelachvili J.N. Mullah N. Zalipsky S. Science. 1997; 275: 820-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). However, although both orientation and length can influence ligand binding kinetic rates and affinity, this effect should be qualitatively monotonic for all ligands. Therefore, our observation that the GPI anchor increases affinity for human and rabbit IgGs but decreases affinity for murine IgG2a allow us to exclude orientation and length as possible causes for the anchor effect.The Difference in Ligand Binding Kinetic Rates and Affinity of CD16 Isoforms Cannot Be Explained by Their Differential Distribution and ClusteringSome GPI-anchored proteins have been suggested to be clustered in glycosphingolipid and cholesterol-enriched domains,e.g. caveolae (49.Anderson R.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1715) Google Scholar). CD16a-GPI might appear to bind better than CD16a-TM in the three-dimensional assay should the former isoform be functionally clustered, since binding of aggregated soluble ligands to receptor clusters might result in an apparently higher avidity.Similarly, being distributed in different membrane domains might potentially influence the two-dimensional binding properties of CD16a-GPI. The forward rate k f and binding affinityK a measured from the micropipette assay are lumped with the contact area A c. The true or functional contact area A c was not measured but should be proportional to the apparent contact area directly visible under the light microscope (Fig. 2 b) (28.Chesla S.E. Selvaraj P. Zhu C. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1553-1572Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). The CHO cell surface displays extensive roughness; thus only the “"

Some septins play an essential role in cytokinesis. In budding yeast, cell division involves assembly of a ring of four septin proteins encircling the junction between mother and bud, which acts like a scaffold for other proteins to complete cytokinesis (1.Longtine M.S. DeMarini D.J. Valencik M.L. Al-Awar O.S. Fares H. DeVirgilio C. Pringle J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 106-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 2.Chant J. Cell. 1996; 84: 187-190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The ring first appears at the cell cortex, where a bud will emerge and grow and to which the divided nuclei migrate and eventually separate. Cytokinesis does not necessarily occur by ring contraction, but at least one role of the septin ring is for the assembly of Myop and subsequently of actin at the ring (20.Bi E. Maddox P. Lew D.J. Salmon E.D. McMillan J.N. Yeh E. Pringle J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1301-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Mutation in any of the four yeast septin proteins Cdc3p, Cdc10p, Cdc11p, and Cdc12p results in cell cycle arrest and defective cytokinesis and gives rise to multinucleated cells (1.Longtine M.S. DeMarini D.J. Valencik M.L. Al-Awar O.S. Fares H. DeVirgilio C. Pringle J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 106-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 3.Hartwell L.H. Exp.

The septin ring is absent in these mutant strains (1.Longtine M.S. DeMarini D.J. Valencik M.L. Al-Awar O.S. Fares H. DeVirgilio C. Pringle J.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 106-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). In contrast to yeast, cytokinesis in insect and animal cells is achieved by a contractile mechanism in which a cleavage furrow of actin filaments forms at the cell cortex during anaphase and rapidly constricts to bisect the cell. Although there are mechanistic differences in division between yeast and flies, septins are also required for cytokinesis in flies. A mutation in Drosophila PNUT causes a lethal phenotype, consistent with a cytokinesis defect (7.Neufeld T.P. Rubin G.M. Cell. 1994; 77: 371-379Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Drosophila septins also encircle the cleavage furrow before and during cytokinesis, and the actomyosin contractile ring shrinks as the membrane pinches inwards. Mammalian NEDD5 localizes near the contractile ring during cytokinesis in HeLa cells, and microinjection of anti-NEDD5 antibodies into dividing cells results in binucleated cells, suggesting that NEDD5 plays an essential role during cytokinesis (14.Kinoshita M. Kumar S. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kinoshita A. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Noda M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1535-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Groups of different septins assemble as filaments in vitro, and this probably also occurs in vivo. This was first described in yeast, where mutation in any of the CDC3,CDC10, CDC11, and CDC12 genes results in loss of 10-nm filaments that normally localize at the septin ring (22.Haarer B.K. Pringle J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3678-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 23.Ford S.K. Pringle J.R. Dev.

Heterotrimeric septin complexes comprising PNUT, SEP1, and SEP2 from Drosophila also form filaments and exhibit GTP binding and GTPase activities in vitro (9.Field C.M. Al-Awar O. Rosenblatt J. Wong M.L. Alberts B. Mitchison T.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 605-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Septin complexes also occur in mammalian cells and contain CDC10, NEDD5, H5, DIFF6, and KIAA0128 (25.Hsu S.C. Hazuka C.D. Roth R. Foletti D.L. Heuser J. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1111-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Like the Drosophila septin complex, the mammalian complex assembles as 8-nm filaments assembling end-to-end in 25-nm unit lengths (25.Hsu S.C. Hazuka C.D. Roth R. Foletti D.L. Heuser J. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1111-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The mammalian septin filaments display thin, 10-nm long strands arising from their sides every 16 nm along the filament, a feature not detected in Drosophila (9.Field C.M. Al-Awar O. Rosenblatt J.

Septin GTPase activity may be required for mammalian septin filament formationin vivo since microinjection of GTPγS1 and transfection of GTP-binding mutants of mouse Nedd5 into HeLa cells disrupt formation of NEDD5-containing filaments (14.Kinoshita M. Kumar S. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kinoshita A. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Noda M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1535-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). A number of septins are found in post-mitotic neurons. High levels ofDrosophila SEP1 were found in central and peripheral nervous tissue (8.Fares H. Peifer M. Pringle J.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1843-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and PNUT was also observed in Drosophila neural tissue (22.Haarer B.K. Pringle J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3678-3687Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). However, the function of the septins in these cells is unknown. CDCrel-1 is brain-specific in rats; CDC10, H5, and NEDD5 are abundant in brain, whereas DIFF6 is not highly expressed there (26.Beites C.L. Xie H. Bowser R. Trimble W.S. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In humans, four septins, NEDD5, H5, DIFF6, and CDC10, were found in post-mortem brain tissues, the first three of which were identified in neurofibrillary tangles in brains affected by Alzheimer's disease (27.Kinoshita A. Kinoshita M. Akiyama H. Tomimoto H. Akiguchi I. Kumar S. Noda M. Kimura J. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 153: 1551-1560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Notably, CDC10 was not localized to the tangles. The three septins were also found in fine fibrillar deposits in neuronal soma, which are considered the earliest detectable stages of neurofibrillary tangle formation. These findings suggest that septins may have a function in the etiology of neuronal disease. Neuronal septins probably do not play roles in cytokinesis since neurons in adult brain generally do not divide. New roles for neuronal septins are emerging in synaptic transmission. Four septins have been identified in a protein complex that can interact with the SEC6-SEC8 complex in rat brain and that can assemble as filaments (25.Hsu S.C. Hazuka C.D. Roth R. Foletti D.L. Heuser J. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1111-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Since the SEC6-SEC8 complex is a cluster of molecules essential for exocytosis, septins may have a role that links the secretory machinery to the actin-based cytoskeleton beneath the plasma membrane (25.Hsu S.C. Hazuka C.D. Roth R. Foletti D.L. Heuser J. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1111-1122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). The brain-specific human CDCrel-1 and the more widely expressed NEDD5 proteins have been shown to be essential for exocytosis in neurons (26.Beites C.L. Xie H. Bowser R. Trimble W.S. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Both proteins immunoprecipitated with theN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) protein syntaxin, and transfection of wild-type or dominant-negative mutants of human CDCrel-1 inhibited or enhanced, respectively, exocytosis from cultured neuroendocrine cells. No septin is presently known to be regulated by phosphorylation or by cellular signal transduction cascades. This study was initiated as part of a program to identify neuronal proteins phosphorylated by type I cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG-I) (28.Wang X. Robinson P.J. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 29.Wang X. Robinson P.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68 (and references therein): 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 30.Lengyel I. Olesen L.E. Nichol K.A. Brain K.L. Wang X. Robinson P.J. Bennett M.R. Rostas J.A.P. Neuroscience. 1999; 90: 607-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 31.Wang X. Bruderer S. Rafi Z. Xue J. Krämer A. Robinson P.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4549-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A major signaling pathway common to many cells is mediated by the second messenger, cGMP. Intracellular levels of cGMP are responsive to hormones of the atrial natriuretic peptide family and to a variety of other hormones that activate or induce the synthesis of nitric-oxide synthase, leading to the production of nitric oxide (29.Wang X. Robinson P.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68 (and references therein): 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Cyclic GMP plays a role in a variety of physiological responses, from learning and memory to apoptosis. Major targets for cGMP signaling are the two Ser/Thr protein kinases PKG-I and PKG-II (29.Wang X. Robinson P.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68 (and references therein): 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). PKG has a relatively limited substrate specificity compared with the closely related PKA, and only a small number of substrates have been identified (29.Wang X. Robinson P.J. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68 (and references therein): 443-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). A previous study has identified a group of proteins in rat brain that were selectively phosphorylated by PKG in comparison with PKA (28.Wang X. Robinson P.J. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Here, a 40-kDa protein (P40) that was relatively specifically phosphorylated by PKG was purified and identified as a new member of the septin family of proteins. We named this protein G-septin as it is a relatively specific PKG substrate. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol), [α-32P]GTP, and [α-33P]dideoxy-NTP (1500 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Cyclic nucleotides were from Sigma. Leupeptin was from Calbiochem. The Walsh inhibitor of PKA (PKI-(5–24), TTYADFIASGRTGRRNAIHD) was from the Peptide Synthesis Group of Louisiana State University, and the peptide was purified by HPLC to >90% purity. All other reagents were of at least analytical reagent grade. P40 was partially purified from rat brain by extension of approaches previously described (28.Wang X. Robinson P.J. J. Neurochem. 1995; 65: 595-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). A fraction enriched in Ca2+-sensitive lipid-binding proteins was prepared from 40 rat brains. Proteins in this fraction were precipitated by (NH4)2SO4 to 80% saturation; dialyzed against buffer containing 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.7), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, and 0.1% Tween 80; and applied to a Q-Sepharose high performance anion-exchange column (10 × 1.6 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 2 ml/min. After washing the column with the same buffer, bound proteins were eluted with a 0–400 mm NaCl gradient, and 60 2-ml fractions were collected. Aliquots of every second or third fraction were phosphorylated (see below), and fractions containing P40 were pooled. The pool of P40 was diluted to adjust the NaCl concentration to <40 mm and the pH to 7.0 and applied to an S-Sepharose high performance cation-exchange column (10 × 1.6 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that was pre-equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Tween 80, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 1 ml/min. After extensive washing, bound proteins were eluted with a 0–400 mm NaCl gradient, and 60 1-ml fractions were collected. Aliquots of the column fractions were phosphorylated, and fractions containing P40 were pooled, concentrated, and desalted with an Ultrafree-4 centrifugal filter device (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and stored at −20 °C in the S-Sepharose column buffer (pH 7.0). The catalytic subunit of PKA and PKC (a mixture of PKCα, PKCβ, and PKCγ) were purified from bovine heart and rat brain as described previously (32.Robinson P.J. Sontag J.-M. Liu J.P. Fykse E.M. Slaughter C. McMahon H.T. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 365: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Bovine lung PKG-I was purified to homogeneity using DEAE-cellulose and cAMP affinity columns (33.Lincoln T.M. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 62-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), with additional steps as described (32.Robinson P.J. Sontag J.-M. Liu J.P. Fykse E.M. Slaughter C. McMahon H.T. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 365: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), and was stored at −70 °C in 10% glycerol with 0.05% Tween 80. The recombinant NEDD5 protein was expressed and purified as described previously (14.Kinoshita M. Kumar S. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kinoshita A. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Noda M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1535-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of brain fractions eluted from the ion-exchange columns was performed by incubation at 37 °C for 5 min with 0.125 μCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP. The incubation mixture (in a final volume of 80 μl) contained 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, 40 μm ATP, and 0.05% Tween 80 in the absence or presence of the activator of the appropriate protein kinase, such as 10 μm cGMP, as indicated in the figure legends. As a control, PKI (0.01 mg/ml) was routinely included in the conditions used to stimulate PKG to prevent potential cross-activation of endogenous PKA by cGMP. After prewarming tubes to 37 °C for 5 min, incubations were initiated by addition of ice-cold brain samples (usually 10 μl), followed immediately by the purified protein kinase (20–40 ng/tube). To define the relative specificity of PKG substrates, the fractions were also phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of PKA. Phosphorylation reactions were terminated after 5 min by addition of 50 μl of a 3× concentrated SDS sample buffer and rapid freezing on dry ice as described previously (34.Robinson P.J. Dunkley P.R. J. Neurochem. 1983; 41: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Half of each sample was used for SDS-PAGE, and phosphoproteins were detected by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography as described (34.Robinson P.J. Dunkley P.R. J. Neurochem. 1983; 41: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) using 7.5–15% linear gradients and 20-cm gels (Bio-Rad Protean II system). Protein kinase activity was determined using 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) 1 mm EGTA, 200 μm ATP, 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 mm MgSO4 in 40-μl incubations. Incubations were for 5 min at 30 °C, and the synthetic peptide phospholamban-(8–21) (TRSAIRRASTIEMP; at a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml) was the substrate (35.Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Incubations were initiated by addition of 40 ng of PKG or 20 ng of the catalytic subunit of PKA. These amounts of the protein kinases were determined in preliminary experiments to phosphorylate phospholamban-(8–21) to the same level since this substrate has the same V max for both protein kinases (35.Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Reactions were terminated by addition of phosphoric acid to 75 mm, and aliquots were spotted onto Whatman P-81 paper, washed three times for 10 min each in 75 mmphosphoric acid, dried, and counted by liquid scintillation techniques (36.Robinson P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21637-21644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For amino acid sequencing, P40 was excised from a dried, Coomassie Blue-stained polyacrylamide gel and digested with trypsin, and the resultant peptides were separated by HPLC. Five major peaks were sequenced with an Applied Biosystems Model 494-HT Procise Sequencer. The BLAST program was utilized to search the expressed sequence tag data base (NCBI, dbest) using the peptide amino acid sequences obtained from the amino acid sequencing (37.Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59920) Google Scholar). Five potential clones, AA002534, W64898, and AA003408(matching the second peptide) and AA036534, and W13793 (matching the first peptide), were obtained from the IMAGE Consortium (Genome System, St. Louis, MO), and their sequences were confirmed by manual DNA sequencing. A PCR product from clone AA003408, a 400-bp fragment encoding the second peptide, was used as a probe to screen a rat brain cDNA library (λZAP II library, Stratagene). The Gigaprime DNA labeling kit (Bresatec Ltd.) was used to label the probe, and the library was screened according to the manufacturer's instructions. Subcloned cDNA was characterized by manual DNA sequencing with a Thermo-Sequenase radiolabeling terminator cycle sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). G-septin-β was initially subcloned, but does not have a stop codon at the 3′-end of the sequence. Therefore, G-septin-β was used as a probe to screen the cDNA library, and another six positive clones were isolated. One of these was identified as full-length G-septin-α. All sequence, homology, and structural analyses were performed with the BLAST program at NCBI. An unrooted phylogenetic tree analysis was carried out using MultAlign (38.Corpet F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 10881-10890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4315) Google Scholar) with the Windows software TreeView (39.Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies were raised in sheep against two different synthetic peptides from regions common to both G-septin isoforms: G-septin-α-(97–112) (EKIPKTVEIKAIGHVI) and G-septin-α-(244–259) (DLEDKTENDKIRQESM). The peptides were individually conjugated by coupling, through C-terminal cysteines added to the sequences during their synthesis, to diphtheria toxoid as a carrier, and conjugates were then mixed together to immunize the same sheep (Chiron Technologies, Victoria, Australia). The production and characterization of the two anti-NEDD5 antibodies 6 and 11 were reported previously (14.Kinoshita M. Kumar S. Mizoguchi A. Ide C. Kinoshita A. Haraguchi T. Hiraoka Y. Noda M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1535-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). To confirm that the partially purified P40 preparation contained G-septin, we immunoprecipitated G-septin from the column fraction containing P40 with the anti-G-septin antibodies. Antibodies were incubated with partially purified P40 at 4 °C overnight and incubated with protein G-agarose beads (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 2 h. The protein G beads were sequentially washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), and aliquoted to 40-μl lots, each containing 0.02–0.04 μg of the 40-kDa protein. These samples were phosphorylated on the beads as described above. Phosphoproteins were heated at 95 °C for 2 min, centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at top speed for 1 min, and then separated by gel electrophoresis and autoradiographed using 7.5–15% linear gradient gels (34.Robinson P.J. Dunkley P.R. J. Neurochem. 1983; 41: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, samples were denatured in a reducing SDS stop buffer and resolved on 12% polyacrylamide minigels. The proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose transfer membrane (0.45 μm; Schleicher & Schüll, Dassel, Germany) as described previously (40.Towbin H. Staehlin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44923) Google Scholar). The membrane was blotted in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) with 5% skim milk overnight, washed in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST), and then incubated with the first antibody for 2 h and with the second antibody for 1 h in TBST containing 0.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone 40; and the membrane was washed with TBST. Immunoblotting was performed by chemiluminescent detection (Pierce SuperSignal). Wild-type G-septin-α cDNA was cloned into the pTrcHis vector (Invitrogen) and transfected into Escherichia coli. Recombinant G-septin-α was expressed using the XpressTM protein expression system (Invitrogen) and purified with a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin column (QIAGEN Inc.) according to the manufacturers' instructions. The GTP binding assay was performed in the well of a 96-well microtiter plate containing 50 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 1 mm EGTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 500 nCi of [α-32P]GTP. Partially purified P40 (purified as described above) from brain (5–10 μg of protein) and recombinant G-septin-α (2 μg) were used for photoaffinity labeling. The tubes were incubated in the dark at 4 °C for 3 h and then irradiated with a short wavelength ultraviolet lamp at 315 nm for 15 min at a distance of 8 cm. The specificity of the photolabeling was determined by comparing the labeling in the presence and absence of 1 mm unlabeled GTP. The reaction was stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer and heating at 95 °C for 2 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Crude synaptosomes (P2) were isolated (34.Robinson P.J. Dunkley P.R. J. Neurochem. 1983; 41: 909-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar); washed twice with Hepes-buffered Krebs solution containing 20 mmHepes, 118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.18 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm Ca2+, and 10 mmd-glucose (pH 7.4); and then labeled with 500 μCi/ml 32Pi for 1 h at 37 °C (31.Wang X. Bruderer S. Rafi Z. Xue J. Krämer A. Robinson P.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4549-4559Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 32.Robinson P.J. Sontag J.-M. Liu J.P. Fykse E.M. Slaughter C. McMahon H.T. Südhof T.C. Nature. 1993; 365: 163-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). After washing with warmed medium to remove free32Pi, aliquots of the synaptosomes were incubated without additions or with the membrane-permeable cyclic nucleotide analogue 8-p-chlorophenylthio-cGMP (8-pCPT-cGMP; 200 μm) or 8-p-chlorophenylthio-cAMP (8-pCPT-cAMP; 200 μm) for 15 min at 37 °C. Synaptosomes were sedimented for 1 min in a microcentrifuge and lysed with 50 mm Tris, 0.5% Triton X-100, 250 mmNaCl, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 μg/ml leupeptin (pH 7.4). G-septin was immunoprecipitated as described above with some mod"

TNK-t-PA is more fibrin-specific than t-PA for reasons that are poorly understood. Previously, we demonstrated that the fibrin specificity of t-PA is compromised because t-PA binds to (DD)E, the major degradation product of cross-linked fibrin, with an affinity similar to that for fibrin. To investigate the enhanced fibrin specificity of TNK-t-PA, we compared the kinetics of plasminogen activation for t-PA, TNK-, T-, K-, TK-, and NK-t-PA in the presence of fibrin, (DD)E or fibrinogen. Although the activators have similar catalytic efficiencies in the presence of fibrin, the catalytic efficiency of TNK-t-PA is 15-fold lower than that for t-PA in the presence of (DD)E or fibrinogen. The T and K mutations combine to produce this reduction via distinct mechanisms because T-containing variants have a higher K M, whereas K-containing variants have a lower k cat than t-PA. These results are supported by data indicating that T-containing variants bind (DD)E and fibrinogen with lower affinities than t-PA, whereas the K and N mutations have no effect on binding. Reduced efficiency of plasminogen activation in the presence of (DD)E and fibrinogen but equivalent efficiency in the presence of fibrin explain why TNK-t-PA is more fibrin-specific than t-PA.

Lijnen H.R. Haemostasis. 1986; 16 (Suppl. 3): 25-32PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmin then solubilizes fibrin, yielding fibrin degradation products. Through a positive feedback mechanism, fibrin enhances its own degradation by stimulating t-PA-mediated Pg activation (2.Hoylaerts M. Rijken D.C. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2912-2919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To enhance this reaction, fibrin binds t-PA and Pg, thereby increasing the catalytic efficiency of t-PA-mediated Pg activation 1000-fold over that in the absence of fibrin (2.Hoylaerts M. Rijken D.C.

In contrast to the potent stimulatory effect of fibrin, fibrinogen (Fg) produces only modest enhancement in the catalytic efficiency of Pg activation by t-PA (2.Hoylaerts M. Rijken D.C. Lijnen H.R.

Because it preferentially activates Pg in the presence of fibrin rather than Fg, t-PA is designated a fibrin-specific plasminogen activator. Despite its apparent fibrin specificity, t-PA causes systemic fibrinogenolysis and α2-antiplasmin consumption when given to patients (9.Collen D. Thromb.

These data suggest that the fibrin specificity of an activator not only depends on its relative stimulation by fibrin and Fg but also on the degree to which it is stimulated by (DD)E. Furthermore, activators that have reduced stimulation by (DD)E but retain activity in the presence of fibrin should be more fibrin-specific than t-PA. Whereas binding of t-PA to fibrin is predominantly mediated by its finger domain, high affinity t-PA binding to (DD)E is mediated solely by its second kringle domain (14.Stewart R.J. Fredenburgh J.C. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18292-18299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 16.Nesheim M.E. Fredenburgh J.C. Larsen G.R. J. Biol.

Supporting the concept that interaction with (DD)E limits the fibrin specificity of t-PA, we demonstrated that vampire bat plasminogen activator, an agent homologous to t-PA but lacking a second kringle domain, is more fibrin-specific than t-PA because it fails to bind to (DD)E yet retains its finger-mediated interaction with fibrin (14.Stewart R.J.

Recently, TNK-t-PA, a genetically engineered variant of t-PA, has been compared with t-PA for treatment of patients with acute myocardial infarction (18.Cannon C.P. McCabe C.H. Gibson C.M. Ghali M.

Although the two agents produce similar patency rates, TNK-t-PA is easier to administer because it has a half-life 8.5-fold longer than that of t-PA (21.Modi N.B. Eppler S. Breed J. Cannon C.P. Braunwald E. Love T.W. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Consequently, TNK-t-PA can be given as a single intravenous bolus, whereas t-PA must be given by bolus followed by an infusion (22.Stassen J.M. Lijnen H.R. Vanlinthout I. Collen D. Fibrinolysis. 1991; 5: 165-170Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 23.Werz W. Werner R.G. J. Bio/Technology. 1998; 61: 157-158PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Holden R.W.

The longer half-life of TNK-t-PA, relative to t-PA, is the result of two mutations introduced into the first kringle of t-PA: removal of the high mannose carbohydrate at position 117 by substitution of asparagine with glutamine (N117Q, abbreviated N) 2Mutations in t-PA are abbreviated as follows: T, T103N; N, N117Q; K, K296A/H297A/R298A/R299A. and creation of a new glycosylation site by replacement of the threonine residue at position 103 with an asparagine (T103N, abbreviated T) (26.Keyt B.A. Paoni N.F.

A third modification is introduced into the protease domain of TNK-t-PA. By replacing the amino acids at positions 296–299 with alanine residues (K296A/H297A/R298A/R299A, abbreviated K), TNK-t-PA is rendered relatively resistant to inactivation by type-1 plasminogen activator inhibitor (26.Keyt B.A. Paoni N.F.

In vivo studies indicate that despite producing equivalent thrombolysis, TNK-t-PA causes less Fg and α2-antiplasmin consumption than t-PA (18.Cannon C.P. McCabe C.H. Gibson C.M. Ghali M.

Circulation. 1998; 98: 2805-2814Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The current study was undertaken to explore the mechanism responsible for the greater fibrin specificity of TNK-t-PA relative to t-PA. The fibrin specificity of TNK-t-PA and variants with only one or two modifications (T-, K-, TK-, and NK-t-PA; Fig. 1) were compared by incubating them in plasma in the absence or presence of a plasma clot and measuring Bβ1–42 generation as a sensitive index of fibrinogenolysis. Based on our previous work demonstrating that (DD)E-mediated stimulation of systemic plasminogen activation compromises the fibrin specificity of t-PA (12.Weitz J.I. Leslie B. Ginsberg J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1082-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 14.Stewart R.J. Fredenburgh J.C. Weitz J.I. J. Biol.

Blood. 1996; 88 (abstr.): 521Google Scholar), we examined the possibility that differences in fibrin specificity of the activators reflect the extent to which they are stimulated by (DD)E or Fg. To accomplish this, we compared the kinetics of Pg activation by t-PA to that of the TNK variants in the presence of fibrin, (DD)E, or Fg and determined the affinities of the activators for these fibrin(ogen) derivatives. Wild-type recombinant t-PA (Activase), TNK-t-PA, and its variants were provided by Dr. B. Keyt (Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA). All were greater than or equal to 90% single chain when analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (30.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar) on 4–15% gels (Ready-Gel, Bio-Rad, Mississauga, Canada), as determined by laser densitometry (Ultroscan XL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The plasmin-directed substrate S-2251 was from Chromogenix (Helena, Mississauga, Canada). Active site blocked derivatives of t-PA or TNK variants were prepared by incubating the activator with a 5-fold molar excess ofd-phenyl-prolyl-arginine chloromethyl ketone (PPACK; Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) as described previously (14.Stewart R.J.

Biophys. 1986; 249: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Active site blocked fluorescently labeled derivatives of t-PA and TNK variants were prepared using the same procedure, except dansyl glutamyl-glycyl-arginine chloromethyl ketone (dEGR; Calbiochem) was substituted for PPACK, and absorbance at 335 nm was measured to distinguish dansyl group absorbance from light scattering (14.Stewart R.J.

The molecular weight and extinction coefficient used for t-PA, TNK-t-PA, and its variants were 65,000 and ε1%280 =20.0, respectively (32.Paoni N.F. Keyt B.A. Refino C.J. Chow A.M. Nguyen H.V.

Human Pg-depleted Fg, purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories Inc. (South Bend, IN), was rendered fibronectin-free by batch adsorption with gelatin-agarose (Sigma) for 30 min at 22 °C. After centrifugation at 3000 × gfor 10 min at 22 °C, factor XIII was removed by affinity chromatography using a sheep anti-factor XIII antibody (Affinity Biologicals, Hamilton, Canada) coupled to Affi-Gel (Bio-Rad), and the Fg was then precipitated with 25% ammonium sulfate. The pellet was then washed with 25% ammonium sulfate, redissolved, and dialyzed against 0.15 m NaCl, 0.02 m Tris-HCP, pH 7.4 (Tris-buffered saline). Fg concentration was calculated by measuring the absorbances at 280 and 320 nm and using ε1%280 = 16.0 (34.Dellenback R.J. Chien S. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1970; 134: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 35.Nesheim M.E. Prendergast F.G. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 996-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For clot lysis assays, Fg was trace labeled with125I using Iodo-beads (Pierce) to a specific activity of 100 ± 5 μCi/mg as described in detail elsewhere (12.Weitz J.I. Leslie B. Ginsberg J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1082-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 36.Ikeno L.C. Bowmen B.M. Der M. J. Radioanal. Chem. 1981; 65: 179-188Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar,37.McFarlane A.S. Biochem. J. 1965; 62: 135-143Crossref Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Native Glu-Pg was isolated from fresh-frozen plasma by lysine-Sepharose affinity chromatography as described previously (14.Stewart R.J. Fredenburgh J.C. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18292-18299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 38.Castellino F.J. Powell J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Glu-Pg isolated in this fashion was free of Lys-Pg as determined by urea/acetic acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (39.Fredenburgh J.C. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 26150-26156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and contained no plasmin chromogenic activity using S-2251. Glu-Pg concentrations were calculated by measuring the absorbances at 280 and 320 nm and using ε1%280 = 16.1 (38.Castellino F.J. Powell J.R. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). (DD)E was prepared by plasmin-mediated lysis of cross-linked fibrin clots as described previously (14.Stewart R.J. Fredenburgh J.C. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18292-18299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, Fg (100 mg) was clotted with 64 nm thrombin (Enzyme Research Laboratories) and 10 mm CaCl2 in the presence of 93 nm activated recombinant factor XIII (a generous gift from Dr. P. Bishop, Zymogenetics, Inc., Seattle, WA), 0.4 μm Glu-Pg and 4.3 nm t-PA. Fibrin degradation products were separated using a Biosep-Sec-S3000 size exclusion column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) fitted to a liquid chromatograph (System Gold; Beckman Instruments Inc., Palo Alto, CA). (DD)E-containing fractions were identified based on their apparent molecular weight and by immunoblot analysis using antibodies against D-dimer (DD) and fragment E (12.Weitz J.I. Leslie B. Ginsberg J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1082-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). (DD)E concentrations were calculated by measuring absorbances at 280 and 320 nm and using ε1%280 =16.0 (40.Olexa S.A. Budzynski A.Z. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). When subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions, (DD)E migrated as a single band. As expected, upon addition of 10 mm H-Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro-OH (GPRP, Novabiochem, San Diego, CA) prior to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, two lower molecular weight bands appeared, corresponding to DD and fragment E, respectively (41.Moskowitz K.A. Budzynski A.Z. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12937-12944Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Blood was collected from the antecubital veins of 10–15 healthy volunteers into110 volume of 3.8% sodium citrate. After sedimenting the red cells by centrifugation at 2000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C, harvested platelet-poor plasma was collected, pooled, and stored in aliquots at −70 °C until needed. Thawed plasma supplemented with 125I-labeled fibrinogen (approximately 60,000 cpm/ml) was clotted with Thromborel S (DADE International Inc, Miami, FL) to 0.1% v/v and calcium chloride to 15 mm and rapidly dispensed in 500-μl aliquots into 1.5-ml polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes, each of which contain a plastic inoculation loop (12.Weitz J.I. Leslie B. Ginsberg J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1082-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Clots formed around these loops were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C and subjected to three washes, each with 2 ml of Tris-buffered saline. Washed clots were then counted for radioactivity for 1 min using a Clinigamma counter (LKB Instruments, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Based on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, clots formed in this fashion are cross-linked because no free α- or γ-chains are detected (12.Weitz J.I. Leslie B. Ginsberg J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1082-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 42.Francis C.W. Marder V.J. Martin S.E. Blood. 1980; 56: 456-464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). t-PA, TNK-t-PA, or a TNK-t-PA variant in concentrations ranging from 0 to 60 nmwas incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in 500-μl aliquots of plasma in the absence or presence of a washed 125I-labeled plasma clot, and clot lysis and fibrinogenolysis were measured as follows. For clot lysis, at the end of the incubation period, clots were removed, washed once with 1 ml of Tris-buffered saline, and counted for residual radioactivity for 1 min. The extent of clot lysis was calculated by subtracting the residual radioactivity from the initial amount and expressing this value as a percentage of initial radioactivity. For fibrinogenolysis, the extent of fibrinogenolysis in the absence or presence of a clot was determined by measuring the levels of Bβ1–42 and Fg in the plasma after the 60-min incubation with the plasminogen activator. For Bβ1–42 analysis, 100 μl of plasma was removed, and unreacted Fg was precipitated by addition of 300 μl of ethanol. After a 30-min incubation on ice and centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 4 min, the ethanol supernatants were evaporated to dryness in a Speedvac concentrator (Savant Instruments Inc, Farmingdale, NY) and reconstituted to original volume with distilled water. Bβ1–42 levels were determined by radioimmunoassay using an antibody that does not cross-react with fibrinopeptide B or Bβ15–42 (12.Weitz J.I. Leslie B. Ginsberg J. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1082-1090Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 43.Weitz J.I. Koehn J.A. Canfield R.E. Landman S.L. Friedman R. Blood. 1986; 67: 1014-1022Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For Fg determination, an additional 100-μl aliquot of plasma was removed and 100 KIU/ml aprotinin (American Diagnostica Inc, Greenwich, CT) was added to inhibit plasmin activity. These samples were frozen at −70 °C and later assayed for Fg using the Clauss method (44.von Clauss A. Acta Haematol. 1957; 17: 237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2995) Google Scholar). The effect of fibrin, (DD)E or Fg on t-PA, TNK-, T-, K-, TK-, and NK-t-PA-mediated Pg activation was determined by comparing plasmin generation in the absence of these cofactors with that in their presence. 20-μl aliquots containing 2 mm S-2251 and plasminogen activator in concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 5 nm were added to wells of a 96-well microtiter plate containing Pg (0–50 μm) and (DD)E (0–0.75 μm) or Fg (0–7.5 μm) suspended in 80 μl of Tris-buffered saline. Plasmin generation was monitored by measuring absorbance at 405 nm at 30-s intervals for 20–30 min using a Spectramax microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). To measure Pg activation in the presence of fibrin, 5-μl aliquots of plasminogen activator and thrombin (final concentrations, 0.5 and 10 nm, respectively) were separately placed in wells prior to the addition of 90 μl of a solution of Pg (0–6.7 μm), fibrinogen (0–0.6 μm), 2 mm CaCl2, and 0.44 mm S-2251. The wells were monitored at 490 and 405 nm, and A 490values were then subtracted from those for A 405. In all cases, rates of plasmin formation were calculated by dividing the slope determined from the plot of A 405 versus time squared by the specific activity of plasmin (0.017 O.D./s/μm), which was determined in a separate experiment. Rates of plasminogen activation (ν) were then divided by the concentration of activator and subjected to nonlinear regression analysis (TableCurve; Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA) according to the Michaelis-Menten equation ν = ([S] ×k cat)/(K M + [S]), where [S] is the equilibrium concentration of free substrate, calculated for each input concentration of Pg and cofactor as described (3.Horrevoets A.J.G. Pannekoek H. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2183-2191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), using 13 and 5.4 μm for the K d values of Glu-Pg for fibrin and (DD)E, respectively (14.Stewart R.J. Fredenburgh J.C. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18292-18299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This analysis yielded the rate constant, k cat, and Michaelis constant,K M. The relative effects of fibrin, (DD)E, and Fg on plasminogen activation were determined by comparing the catalytic efficiencies (k cat/K M) calculated in the presence of saturating concentrations of each cofactor. Cofactor concentrations were considered saturating when the catalytic efficiency reached a maximum. All fluorescence and light scattering intensities were measured in a LS50B luminescence spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, Etobicoke, Canada) using a 3-ml quartz cuvette thermostated at 22 °C (14.Stewart R.J. Fredenburgh J.C. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18292-18299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Emission intensities were continuously monitored in time drive with the interval time set at 1 or 2 s and the response time set at 2 or 3 s. Scattering intensities were obtained from the time drive profile by averaging scattering intensities observed over a period of at least 100 s. Thus, each emission intensity value represents the mean of 50–100 individual readings. The binding of dEGR-labeled t-PA, TNK-t-PA, or its variants to fibrin was determined by clotting 1 μm Fg with 10 nmthrombin in the presence of 10 mm CaCl2 and increasing concentrations of fluorescently labeled activator as described previously (14.Stewart R.J. Fredenburgh J.C. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18292-18299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 16.Nesheim M.E. Fredenburgh J.C. Larsen G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21541-21548Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After compacting the fibrin by centrifugation, the concentration of unbound activator in the supernatant was determined by measuring the fluorescence. Interactions of t-PA, TNK-t-PA, or its variants with (DD)E or Fg were monitored using right angle light scattering spectroscopy where the solution was excited at a fixed wavelength (λ = 400 or 440 nm) and emission intensities were measured at the same wavelength. Excitation and emission slit widths were set to either 8 or 12 nm with a 1% attenuation emission filter (14.Stewart R.J. Fredenburgh J.C. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18292-18299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 5- or 10-μl aliquots of Fg or (DD)E (15 and 5 μm, respectively) were added to 2 ml of 0.1 μm active site blocked activator, and changes in scattering intensity were monitored. Control titrations were performed to determine the light scattering intensity of (DD)E or Fg alone. To compare the affinity of the activators for lysine, changes in intrinsic fluorescence were monitored as each plasminogen activator was titrated with l-lysine or EACA (14.Stewart R.J. Fredenburgh J.C. Weitz J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18292-18299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Additions of 10–20 μl of 20 mml-lysine or EACA were made to a 2-ml solution containing 0.1 μm active site blocked activator. Intrinsic fluorescence was monitored with λex = 280 nm, λem = 340 nm with a 290-nm cut-off filter and slit widths set to 5 nm. For analysis of fibrin binding, the concentration of unbound protein in the clot supernatants was determined by comparing the fluorescence intensity with those of known concentrations of protein. The concentration of bound protein was then determined by calculating the difference between total and unbound protein concentrations. These values were divided by the Fg concentration to determine the number of moles of dEGR-labeled activator bound/mol of fibrin (B). For each point in the titration, values were plotted against the concentration of unbound protein, and Scatchard plots were constructed. Scatchard plots for the binding of t-PA, TNK-t-PA, and its variants to fibrin are curved downward, and these data are best fit to a two-site model by nonlinear regression analysis (Table Curve, Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA) according to the following expression.B=n1·LKd1+L+n2·LKd2+LEquation 1 where L represents the concentration of unbound protein, n 1 and n 2 are the stoichiometries for each of the two sites, andK d1 andK d2 are their respective dissociation constants. For analysis of solution-phase binding of PPACK-labeled activator to (DD)E or Fg, the emission intensity (I) of the incident beam after each addition of ligand was corrected for changes because of ligand scattering and dilution. Corrected values were compared wi"

Through alternative mRNA splicing, four main WT1 protein isoforms are synthesized. All isoforms can bind to DNA via their zinc fingers, albeit with different affinities and specificities, and thereby modulate the transcriptional activity of their target genes. Several proteins bind to and alter the transcription regulatory properties of the WT1 proteins, including the product of the tumor suppressor gene p53. Interaction between WT1 and p53 was shown to modulate their ability to regulate the transcription of their respective target genes. Here, we report that all four isoforms of WT1 bind to p73, a recently cloned homologue of p53. p73 binds to the zinc finger region of WT1 and thereby inhibits DNA binding and transcription activation by WT1. Similarly, WT1 inhibits p73-induced transcription activation in reporter assays and counteracts p73-induced expression of endogenous Mdm2. This, taken together with our finding that WT1 also interacts with p63/KET, another p53 homologue, suggests that association between WT1 and the members of the p53 family of proteins may be an important determinant of their functions in cell growth and differentiation.

The clinical features of these three syndromes always include kidney and genital abnormalities. The essential role of WT1 in urogenital development was underscored by the finding thatWT1-null mice fail to develop kidney and gonads (9.Kreidberg J.A. Sariola H. Loring J.M. Maeda M. Pelletier J.

The WT1 gene contains 10 exons, two of which are alternatively spliced, giving rise to four different protein isoforms with molecular masses of 52–54 kDa. Inclusion of exon five inserts 17 amino acids just N-terminal of the four zinc fingers of WT1, and incorporation of a second splice insert alters the spacing between zinc finger three and four by insertion of the three amino acids lysine, threonine, and serine (KTS) (15.Haber D.A.

The four WT1 proteins are referred to as WT1(−/−) if the protein lacks both splice inserts, WT1(+/−) and WT1(−/+) if the protein contains the first or the second insert, respectively, and WT1(+/+) if the protein contains both splice inserts. At first, it was thought that all four WT1 protein isoforms function exclusively as transcription factors, but increasing evidence suggests that the WT1 isoforms containing the KTS splice insert may also be involved in post-transcriptional processing of RNA (16.Larsson S.H.

Protein-protein interactions also alter the transcription regulatory functions of WT1. Two proteins, Par-4 (29.Johnstone R.W. See R.H. Sells S.F. Wang J. Muthukkumar S. Englert C. Haber D.A.

Both proteins inhibit transcription activation by WT1, and Par-4 also augments WT1-mediated transcription repression. Physical association between WT1 and p53 may modulate their respective transcription regulatory properties (31.Maheswaran S. Park S. Bernard A. Morris J.F. Rauscher F.J. Hill D.E. Haber D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5100-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In a certain cellular setting, p53 can convert WT1 from an activator to a repressor of a given reporter construct, whereas WT1 exerts a cooperative effect on transcription activated by p53 (31.Maheswaran S. Park S. Bernard A. Morris J.F. Rauscher F.J. Hill D.E. Haber D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5100-5104Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). These results were later extended by the finding that WT1 can stabilize the p53 protein and that zinc finger one and two of WT1 are required for stabilization (32.Maheswaran S. Englert C. Bennett P. Heinrich G. Haber D.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2143-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Recently, two genes that share sequence homology with the transactivation, DNA binding, and tetramerization domains ofp53 were cloned and named p73 (33.Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L.

In this paper, we demonstrate that WT1 physically interacts with p73 and p63. Association with p73 is mediated via the zinc fingers of WT1 and, consequently, binding of p73 diminishes DNA binding and transcription activation by WT1. Likewise, WT1 inhibits p73-mediated transcription activation of reporter constructs and attenuates p73-induced expression of endogenous Mdm2. These results show that WT1 associates with all known members of the p53 family and suggests that this interaction modulates their respective functions in cell growth and differentiation. The CMV promoter-driven CB6+-WT1 expression constructs have been described previously (44.Morris J.F. Madden S.L. Tournay O.E. Cook D.M. Sukhatme V.P. Rauscher F.J.

KET was expressed from a pcDNA3 vector. pcDNA 3.1-lacZ was purchased from Invitrogen. The vector for expression of GST-p53 fusion proteins inEscherichia coli was made by digesting p53cDNA with SmaI and partially digesting it withNcoI. The 1322-base pair p53 cDNA fragment was cloned into NcoI/SmaI-digested pRP261, a pGEX (46.Smith D.B. Johnson K.S. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 31-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (5028) Google Scholar) derivative. To obtain a plasmid encoding GST-p73α, pcDNA3-p73α was digested with XbaI and the cleavage site blunted. Next, the linearized plasmid was cut withXhoI and the p73α cDNA retrieved. pRP259, a pGEX derivative, was linearized with EcoRI and the restriction site blunted. Then, pRP259 was cut with SalI and the p73α fragment ligated into pRP259. The generation of pcDNA3.1-WT1(−/−)-FL, pcDNA3.1-WT1(−/−)-Bsp, and pCR2.1WT1(−/−)-PM have been described elsewhere (24.Scharnhorst V. Dekker P. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23456-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). pcDNA3.1-WT1(−/−)-Bam was made by blunting aWT1(−/−) cDNA fragment that had been excised from CB6+-WT1(−/−) by digestion withBamHI and HincII and inserting it intoEcoRV-digested pcDNA3.1. The DNAs used in in vitro transcription/translation to generate C-terminally truncated WT1(−/−) proteins were produced by polymerase chain reaction on pcDNA3.1-WT1(−/−) as template. The upstream primer (5′-CTGGCTAACTAGAGAACC-3′) anneals upstream of the T7 promoter present in pcDNA3.1. Downstream primers anneal on the WT1(−/−) cDNA. Downstream primers used were 5′-GCAGCCTGGCTAAGCACACAT-3′ for WT1(−/−)-ΔZn2–4 and 5′-AGAAAACCTTCATTCACAGTC-3′ for WT1 (−/−)-ΔZn3–4. E2F1 was in vitro translated from a pRc/CMV vector. The pBL2–3xWTE-luciferase reporter containing three WTE consensus sites 5′ of the TATA box, the pGL2-Mdm2-luciferase, and the pGL3-Bax-luciferase reporter constructs have been described in Refs. 24.Scharnhorst V.

Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, respectively. All cells were cultured at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Saos-2, Hep3B, and U2OS cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 8% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. All cells were transfected by the calcium-phosphate transfection method (49.van der Eb A.J. Graham F.L. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 826-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) for 7 or 16 h. After transfection, cells were washed and incubated with fresh culture medium for 24–40 h. The polyclonal anti-WT1 antibody (C19), the polyclonal anti-HA antibody (Y-11), the polyclonal anti-KET antibody (R-20), the monoclonal anti-E2F1 antibody (KH95), the monoclonal anti-Mdm2 antibody (SMP14), and the polyclonal anti-Bax antibody (P19) were all purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The monoclonal anti-WT1 antibody H2 was from Dako and the monoclonal anti-HA antibody (16B12) from Babco. The monoclonal anti-LacZ antibody was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in IPB 0.7 buffer (20 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.8, 0.7 m NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.2% deoxycholate) supplemented with inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml NaF, β-glycerophosphate, Na3VO4, trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mg/ml Na4P2O7). After centrifugation of the lysates, protein concentrations were measured with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitation-Western analysis, the polyclonal anti-WT1 and anti-HA antibodies were pre-coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads before cell lysate was added to the antibody-coated beads. Immunoprecipitations were tumbled for 16 h at 4 °C. Protein samples were separated on SDS-PAA gels and subsequently transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell) in ice-cold blotting buffer containing 20% methanol, 20 mmTris, and 150 mm glycine at 300 mA for 3 h. The blots were blocked for 30 min in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 2% non-fat dry milk (Nutricia) and subsequently incubated for 1 h with the primary antibody, followed by a 30-min incubation with the secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories), diluted in the blocking buffer. All secondary antibodies had been pre-absorbed against immunoglobulins of other species by the manufacturer. Protein bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Three-cm dishes of U2OS cells were grown to 70–90% confluence and rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline. After a 30-min preincubation in methionine-free label medium, the cells were labeled for 3 h with 150 μCi of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Subsequently, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in IPB 0.7. Debris was removed by centrifugation, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-WT1, anti-KET, or anti-HA antibodies for 16 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were boiled in sample buffer and separated on a SDS-PAA gel. The gels were incubated in 2,5-diphenyloxazole-Me2SO, washed, and dried before being exposed to x-ray films at −80 °. 5-cm dishes of Saos-2 cells were transfected with 200 ng of CMV-HA-p73α, 20 ng of CMV-HA-p53, and 10 μg of CMV-WT1(−/−) or with 200 ng of CMV-HA-p73α/CMV-HA-p53together with 1, 2.5, and 5 μg of CMV-WT1(−/−). Co-transfected CMV-lacZ (1.5 μg) used to correct for transfection efficiencies and equal amount of CMV vector were present in every transfection. 40 h after transfection, cells were lysed and Western blots prepared. The pulse-chase experiment was performed as described under “Metabolic Cell Labeling and Immunoprecipitation,” except that U2OS cells, which had been transfected with 120 ng of CMV-HA-p73α alone or in combination with 3 μg of CMV-WT1(−/−), were labeled with [35S]methionine for 1.5 h prior to lysis in IPB 0.7 or the chase periods of 1, 2, or 4 h. Quantifications were done with the GDS8000 gel documentation and analysis system (Ultra-Violet Products). The different WT1(−/−) deletion mutants (see under “Plasmids and cDNAs”) were in vitro transcribed/translated with the TNT reticulocyte lysate kit (Promega). [35S]Methionine-labeled WT1 proteins were added to GST-p53 and GST-p73 bound to glutathione-agarose beads, and the proteins were tumbled in NETN buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) for at least 4 h at 4 °C to allow protein complexes to form. After washing, bound proteins were separated by electrophoresis through a SDS-PAA gel and visualized by incubation in 2,5-diphenyloxazole-Me2SO and exposure to x-ray films at −80 °. WT1(−/−), p73α, p53, and E2F1 proteins were in vitro transcribed/translated with the TNT Reticulocyte Lysate kit (Promega). The electrophoretic mobility shift assay was essentially performed as described previously (24.Scharnhorst V. Dekker P. van der Eb A.J. Jochemsen A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23456-23462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In short, an α-[32P]dATP-labeled synthetic duplex containing the WTE DNA sequence (20.Nakagama H. Heinrich G. Pelletier J. Housman D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) was used as a probe. Reactions were carried out with a 15-min preincubation of the in vitro translated proteins at room temperature in a 25-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 70 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 12% glycerol, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 1 μg of poly(dI·dC), and 0.1 mm ZnCl2. Subsequently, the labeled probe was added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for a further 30 min at room temperature. The DNA-protein complexes were resolved from the free probe by electrophoresis through a 6% native PAA gel (19:1 acrylamide:N,N′-methylene-bisacrylamide, ICN) in a 1× Tris glycine-buffered system. 3-cm dishes of Hep3B cells were transfected for luciferase reporter assays. Each precipitate was adjusted to equal amounts of CMV constructs by addition of empty CMV-driven expression plasmid. 1.5 μg of pBL2–3xWTE-TATA-luciferase, pGL3-Bax-luciferase, or pGL2-Mdm2-luciferase reporter were used per precipitate. As an internal standard for transfection efficiency 1.2 μg of CMV-lacZ was included in each precipitate. The total amount of DNA per precipitate was adjusted to 5 μg with salmon sperm DNA. For 3xWTE-TATA-luciferase reporter assay 1.2 μg of CB6+-WT1(−/−) and 150 ng of eitherp73α or p53 were used per 3-cm dish. For pGL3-Bax-luciferase reporter assay 60 ng of p73 orp53 and 1.2 μg of WT1 were used. For pGL2-Mdm2-luciferase reporter assay 6 ng of p73α orp53 and 600 ng or 1.8 μg of WT1(−/+) were used. All luciferase reporter assays were repeated at least three times, and the results shown for the different reporter constructs are derived from single representative experiments with the error bars indicating standard deviations. For induction of the endogenous Mdm2/Bax promoters, 5-cm dishes of Hep3B cells were transfected with 200 ng of p73α, 20 ng ofp53, 10 μg of WT1(−/+), and 1.5 μg oflacZ. Each transfection was adjusted to contain equal amounts of CMV plasmid by addition of empty CMV vector. It has been reported that WT1 associates with p53 (31.Maheswaran S. Park S. Bernard A.

Haber D.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2143-2156Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). To investigate whether WT1 also binds to the other members of the p53 family, U2OS cells were transfected with a CMV expression construct without a cDNA insert (Neo) or WT1(−/−) alone or withWT1(−/−) in combination with either p73α orp73β, two splice forms of the p73 gene (33.Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D. Cell. 1997; 90: 809-819Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1530) Google Scholar). As a positive control, U2OS cells were transfected withWT1(−/−) and p53 expression vectors. p53, p73α, and p73β all contain an N-terminal HA tag, enabling us to immunoprecipitate all three proteins with an anti-HA antibody. Fig.1 A shows Western blots of U2OS cell lysates from which either transfected WT1(−/−) (lanes WT1) or p53/p73α/p73β (lanes HA) had been immunoprecipitated. The lanes − contain one-tenth of the amount of whole cell extract used per immunoprecipitation. The blots were first incubated with an anti-HA antibody and subsequently with an anti-WT1 antibody. The upper panel of Fig.1 A shows co-immunoprecipitation of p73α and p73β with WT1 and vice versa. The lower panel demonstrates that p53 can be co-immunoprecipitated in an anti-WT1 precipitation, but the previously described binding of WT1 to p53 in an anti-p53 immunoprecipitation remains below detection level. Next, we wanted to establish whether all four splice forms of WT1 bind to p73. To that end, we transfected U2OS cells with an expression vector encoding HA-p73α in combination with vectors encoding the four WT1 isoforms and immunoprecipitated WT1 and HA-tagged proteins from cell extracts. A Western blot was prepared and cut in half at the height of the 62-kDa marker, the lower part incubated with an anti-WT1, and the upper part with an anti-HA antibody (Fig. 1 B, upper panel). The blot containing the whole cell extracts was incubated with a mixture of anti-WT1 and anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 1 B, lower panel). p73α clearly co-precipitates with all four isoforms of WT1, and all WT1 isoforms are bound to precipitated p73α. Fig. 1 A indicated that p53 co-precipitates less efficiently with WT1 than p73α or p73β (compare the individual signal intensities in lanes WT1 to the signals in thelanes −). To rule out the possibility that endogenous p53 molecules in U2OS cells compete with transfected p53 for WT1 binding and in that way diminish binding of exogenous p53, we transfected Saos-2 cells lacking endogenous p53 proteins with WT1 and the different p53 family members. WT1 was immunoprecipitated, and Western blots of the immunoprecipitates and whole cell lysates were prepared (Fig. 1 C). Although p73α, p73β, and p53 are expressed equally well (lower panel of Fig. 1 C) and the same amount of WT1 is precipitated from the co-transfected cells, less p53 is bound to WT1 (upper panelof Fig. 1 C). Thus, p53 and p73 are bound to WT1 in immunoprecipitation-Western analysis, but p73α and p73β co-precipitate more efficiently with WT1 than p53. Next, we transfected U2OS cells with expression constructs for WT1,p73α, p73β, and KET, the rat homologue of p6"
https://openalex.org/W2012528207,"Mad1 is a member of the Myc/Max/Mad network of transcriptional regulators that play a central role in the control of cellular behavior. Mad proteins are thought to antagonize Myc functions at least in part by repressing gene transcription. To systematically examine the function of Mad1 in growth control and during apoptosis, we have generated U2OS cell clones that express Mad1 under a tetracyline-regulatable promoter (UTA-Mad1). Mad1 was induced rapidly and efficiently, localized to the nucleus, and bound to DNA as a heterodimer with Max. The induction of Mad1 reduced cellular growth and, more profoundly, inhibited colony formation of UTA-Mad1 cells. Conditioned medium neutralized this inhibitory effect implying that Mad1 function is regulated by extracellular signals. In addition Mad1 interfered with Fas-, TRAIL-, and UV-induced apoptosis, which coincided with a reduced activation of caspase-8 during Fas-mediated apoptosis in response to Mad1 expression. Furthermore, microinjection of Mad1-expressing plasmids into fibroblasts inhibited apoptosis induced by the oncoproteins c-Myc and E1A. Thus, Mad1 not only interferes with cellular proliferation but also with apoptosis, which defines a novel aspect of Mad1 function.

The presence of the latter suggests that the Mad repressor complex functions at least in part by affecting chromatin structure. This complex can dominantly interfere with activator-induced transcription (22.Ayer D. Laherty C.D. Lawrence Q.A. Armstrong A.P. Eisenman R.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5772-5781Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 23.Kasten M.M. Ayer D.E. Stillman D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4215-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Together, these findings support the concept that the Myc/Max/Mad network affects cellular behavior through the regulation of specific target genes. Whether Myc and Mad proteins target the same genes or whether Myc-responsive genes exist which are not affected by Mad and vice versa is not resolved at present. Myc protein expression is tightly linked to cellular proliferation and the forced expression of Myc stimulates cell cycle progression and inhibits differentiation (for review, see Refs. 1.Henriksson M. Lüscher B. Adv. Cancer Res. 1996; 68: 109-182Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 33.Amati B. Alevizopoulos K. Vlach J. Frontiers Biosci. 1998; 3: 250-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In addition, deregulated expression of myc genes as a result of chromosomal aberrations is frequently found in human tumors and Myc cooperates with an activated form of Ras in the transformation of rat embryo fibroblasts (for review, see Ref. 34.Spencer C.A. Groudine M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1991; 56: 1-48Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The important function of Myc proteins in promoting proliferation is further supported by the findings that the homozygous deletion of either c-myc or N-myc is embryonically lethal in mice (35.Charron J. Malynn B.A. Fisher P. Stewart V. Jeannotte L. Goff S.P. Robertson E.J. Alt F.W. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 2248-2257Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 36.Stanton B.R. Perkins A.S. Tessarollo L.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 671-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Myc can also promote apoptosis under specific circumstances (for review, see Ref.38.Prendergast G.C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2967-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Thus, Myc proteins are critical components of a regulatory network underlying cell growth control and have been suggested to be part of a molecular switch that affects growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. In contrast to Myc proteins, Mad proteins are expressed in differentiating, terminally differentiated, and resting cells (5.Ayer D.E. Kretzner L. Eisenman R.N.

A role in tumor formation is also supported by the observation that mxi1−/− mice show hyperplastic alterations in different tissues and reveal an increased susceptibility to a carcinogen (48.Schreiber-Agus N. Meng Y. Hoang T. Hou H.J. Chen K. Greenberg R. Cordon-Cardo C. Lee H.W. DePinho R.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Recent findings indicate that Mad1 may modulate apoptosis of cells of the granulocytic lineage (49.Foley K.P. McArthur G.A. Queva C. Hurlin P.J. Soriano P. Eisenman R.N. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 774-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). As far as tested, all the biological effects ascribed to Mad1 are dependent on the bHLHZip and the mSin3-interaction domain (SID), implying that these effects are the result of Mad1-specific gene regulation. In summary, these findings support the view that Mad proteins are negative regulators of cell growth and thereby oppose Myc function. To study the role of Mad1 in cell growth control in more detail, we have generated cell lines that express mad1 under the control of a tetracycline-regulatable activator. We find that Mad1 reduces the growth rate of exponentially growing cells and inhibits efficiently the outgrowth of colonies, which can be overcome with conditioned medium. Furthermore, Mad1 interferes with apoptosis induced by several different stimuli. This appears to be mediated by a inhibition of the activation of caspase-8. Thus, Mad1 has broad biological activities affecting different fundamental processes involved in the control of cellular behavior. U2OS, UTA, UTA-Mad1, SAOS-2, and COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 3T3-L1 cells in modified Eagle's medium and Jurkat T cells in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 100 units penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). Tetracycline was added to 1000 ng/ml if not indicated otherwise. For proliferation assays cells were seeded in 96-well plates (1000 or 5000 cells/well) and the relative number of cells was measured using the crystal violet staining protocol as described (50.Kueng W. Silber E. Eppenberger U. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 16-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Control experiments revealed a linear relationship between the number of cells (1 × 103 to 1 × 106) analyzed and the measured absorbance at 590 nm (data not shown). For [3H]thymidine incorporation assays, the cells were incubated with 0.5 μCi of [3H]thymidine/well for 4 h, harvested onto glass fiber filters, and the incorporated radioactivity determined by scintillation counting.

Briefly, 5 × 105 cells/10-cm dish were seeded 20 h prior to transfection. 48 h after transfection, cells were replated and selected in puromycin (1 μg/ml). After 14–20 days, single colonies were isolated and propagated to clonal cell lines (UTA-Mad1 clones). For colony formation assays, the selected cells were stained with Giemsa and counted. Selection and propagation of stable clones was performed in the presence of 1 μg/ml tetracycline. For induction, cells were washed extensively in medium containing FCS and then cultivated in the absence of tetracycline or in the presence of the indicated amounts of tetracycline. For colony formation assays of UTA-Mad1 cells, between 200 and 1000 cells/10-cm dish were plated. Microinjections were performed as described previously (26.Sommer A. Hilfenhaus S. Menkel A. Kremmer E. Seiser C. Loidl P. Lüscher B. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 357-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In each experiment, 100–150 cells were injected and identified by staining for GFP. In independent experiments, coexpression of the different proteins was verified (data not shown). For the induction of apoptosis, UTA or UTA-Mad1 cells were seeded onto CELLocates (Eppendorf) and grown in the presence or absence of tetracycline overnight. Apoptosis was induced with 100 ng/ml Fas-specific antibodies (Kamya CH-11) or 100 ng/ml Flag-TRAIL (a kind gift of M. Thome) (58.Thome M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Fickenscher H. Meinl E. Neipel F.

At different time points after induction of apoptosis, viable cells were counted in designated fields on the CELLocates. Antibodies recognizing Mad1 (SC-C-19), Max (SC-C-17), c-Myc (N-262), E1A (13 S-5), cyclin E (SC-198), CDK4 (SC-260), and p53 (DO-1) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The monoclonal antibodies (mAb) 5F4 and 5C9 recognizing human Mad1 and mAb 6A10 specific for hu-c-Myc have been described previously (10.Sommer A. Bousset K. Kremmer E. Austen M. Lüscher B. J. Biol.

For immunoblot analysis, cells were lysed in modified F-buffer (10 mm Hepes pH7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 30 mmsodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 100 μmNa3VO4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mmphenylmethylsufonyl fluoride, 2.5 units/ml pepstatin A, 2.5 units/ml leupeptin, 0.15 mm benzamidine, 2.8 μg/ml aprotinin), the proteins separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted to nitrocellulose membranes, and manipulated as described previously (60.Oelgeschläger M. Krieg J. Lüscher-Firzlaff J.M. Lüscher B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5966-5974Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). UTA-Mad1 cells were seeded onto coverslips and cultivated with and without tetracycline for 42 h. Cells were then fixed in PBS containing 3.7% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 22 min, washed three times in PBS, and permeabilized in PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 8 min. The TUNEL assay was performed as recommended by the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The DNA was stained with Hoechst 33258 (1 μg/ml in PBS) and the coverslips mounted with Moviol (Merck) in PBS containing 2.5% N-propylgallate (Sigma). UTA and UTA-Mad1 cells were harvested in 300 μl of F-buffer, and EMSAs were performed using as probe a 32P-end-labeled CMD oligonucleotide (5′-TCA GAC CACGTG GTC GGG) as described previously (10.Sommer A. Bousset K. Kremmer E. Austen M. Lüscher B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6632-6642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). RNA was extracted with the RNeasy total RNA kit (Qiagen). 15 μg of RNA was separated on 1% formaldehyde agarose gels. The RNA was blotted onto GeneScreenTM membrane and hybridized with32P-random prime-labeled probes in 0.25 mNaPi, 7% SDS, 1 mm EDTA at 65 °C. The membranes were washed with 50 mm NaPi, 0.5% SDS. As probe the NotI/EcoRI fragment from pVZ1-hu-mad1 was used. For RNA protection assays, mRNA was prepared using the Oligotex direct mRNA kit (Quiagen). The expression of apoptosis relevant genes was measured using the multi-probe RNase protection assay systems (h-APO-1c and h-APO-2c; PharMingen) as suggested by the manufacturer. The expression of a set of genes relevant for proliferation and apoptosis was analyzed by using RiboScreenTM human-1 membranes (PharMingen). For kinase assays, 5 × 105cells from UTA-Mad1 cells were plated onto 10-cm dishes. The next day, the cells were washed and treated with or without tetracycline for the indicated times and harvested in 400 μl of F-buffer. Portions of the lysates containing equal amounts of proteins (50 μg; as determined with the Bradford protein assay) were incubated with 1 μg of cyclin E- or CDK4-specific antibodies and protein A-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. For controls COS-7 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing cyclin E/CDK2, cyclinD/CDK4, or empty vectors and lysates were prepared in F-buffer. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice in F-buffer and once in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Kinase assays were performed in 25 μl of kinase buffer containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and 100 μm ATP for 15 min at 30 °C. For cyclin E/CDK2 and cyclin D/CDK4 assays, 5 μg of histone H1 and 2 μg of GST-RbC, respectively, were used as substrates. The reactions were stopped by adding SDS-sample buffer, the proteins were separated on 15% SDS gels, and the dried gels analyzed by autoradiography. For caspase assays, 2 × 106 cells were treated with or without Fas-specific antibodies in the presence or absence of tetracycline for 48 h. Lysates were prepared in 800 μl of F-buffer supplemented with 100 mm NaCl and 10 mm dithiothreitol. Caspase 8 and caspase 3 activities were measured using 17 mm Ac-IETD-AFC (PharMingen) and 19 mm Z-DEVD-AMC (Alexis), respectively, as fluorogenic substrates. The reactions were performed in a spectrofluorometer with an excitation wave length of 400 nm and an emission wave length of 505 nm over 30 min at 37 °C. During this time window, the reaction was linear. The slopes of the reactions were calculated, and the values from parallel control samples were subtracted. The analysis of Mad1 function using transient expression studies revealed a role in cell growth inhibition (43.Cerni C. Bousset K. Seelos C. Burkhardt H. Henriksson M. Lüscher B. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 587-596PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Chen J. Willingham T. Margraf L.R. Schreiber-Agus N. DePinho R.A. Nisen P.D. Nat.

Biol. 1996; 16: 2796-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To further define this effect, we established UTA-Mad1 cell lines that express Mad1 under the control of a tetracycline-regulatable activator (tet-off; Ref. 51.Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar). We used founder cell lines that express the tet repressor-VP16-transactivation domain fusion protein (tet-R-VP16-TAD) and tested whether in these cell lines a Mad1-induced effect on colony formation could be observed. The osteosarcoma cell lines UTA and SAOS-2 and the fibroblastoid cell line 3T3-L1 stably expressing the tet-R-VP16-TAD were cotransfected with a plasmid coding for Mad1 under the control of a tet-R-responsive element/minimal CMV promoter and a puromycin resistance plasmid. The transfected cells were then seeded in the presence or absence of tetracycline, selected in puromycin, and the number of colonies analyzed 20 days later. Whereas the UTA cells showed a specific repression of the number of colonies in response to Mad1 expression, the corresponding SAOS-2 and 3T3-L1 cells were already fully inhibited in the presence of tetracycline (Fig. 1and data not shown). In addition, we tried to generate SAOS-2-Mad1 and 3T3-L1-Mad1, -Mad3, and -Mad4 cells. However, all the puromycin-resistant clones that were analyzed did not express either of the Mad proteins (data not shown). We concluded that low amounts of Mad1, as obtained in the off status of the tetracycline-regulatable system, were sufficient to inhibit growth in SAOS-2 and in 3T3-L1 cells. Therefore, we concentrated on the analysis of UTA-Mad1 cells, which are described below. We selected several UTA-Mad1 clones, which behaved similarly in all the assays performed. In the following experiments, we have used three representative clones (M19, M37, and M47). The induction of mad1 mRNA and of Mad1 protein was rapid, in the range of 25–30-fold, and reversible in all three clones (Fig.2 and data not shown). In M47 cells, a 20-fold induction of mad1 mRNA was observed after removing tetracycline by 4 h and maximal induction of 25-fold by 8 h (Fig. 2, A and B). Readdition of tetracycline resulted in a rapid decline of mad1 mRNA to basal levels within 4 h. In agreement with the RNA expression data, significant accumulation of Mad1 protein was observed after removing tetracycline by 4 h and thereafter (Fig. 2 C). The induction of both mad1 mRNA and protein was dose-dependent with maximal expression at concentrations of tetracycline of 0.1 ng/ml or less (data not shown). These findings demonstrate that the expression of Mad1 is efficiently regulated in several UTA-Mad1 clones. Mad1 proteins expressed in UTA-Mad1 cells were further characterized. Mad1-specific staining was exclusively nuclear upon removal of tetracycline (Fig. 3). Furthermore, we determined whether t"
https://openalex.org/W1981964231,"A signal peptide is required for entry of a preprotein into the secretory pathway, but how it functions in concert with the other transport components is unknown. In <i>Escherichia coli,</i> SecA is a key component of the translocation machinery found in the cytoplasm and at membrane translocation sites. Synthetic signal peptides corresponding to the wild type alkaline phosphatase signal sequence and three sets of model signal sequences varying in hydrophobicity and amino-terminal charge were generated. These were used to establish the requirements for interaction with SecA. Binding to SecA, modulation of SecA conformations sensitive to protease, and stimulation of SecA-lipid ATPase activity occur with functional signal sequences but not with transport-incompetent ones. The extent of SecA interaction is directly related to the hydrophobicity of the signal peptide core region. For signal peptides of moderate hydrophobicity, stimulation of the SecA-lipid ATPase activity is also dependent on amino-terminal charge. The results demonstrate unequivocally that the signal peptide, in the absence of the mature protein, interacts with SecA in aqueous solution and in a lipid bilayer. We show a clear parallel between the hierarchy of signal peptide characteristics that promote interaction with SecA <i>in vitro</i> and the hierarchy of those observed for function <i>in vivo</i>."

IL-4 also triggers phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate (IRS), leading to stimulation of cell growth. Moreover, IL-4 inhibits proliferation of a variety of cells, but the molecular mechanism of its growth inhibitory effect is not understood. In this study, we demonstrated that IL-4 inhibited cell growth of colon carcinoma cell lines (HT29 and WiDr) but promoted cell growth of Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines (BL30 and BL41) in a dose-dependent manner. The growth inhibition was not dependent on Stat6 activation, because Stat6 was activated at similar levels in all cell lines in response to IL-4. Strikingly, IL-4 activated Stat1 in colon carcinoma cell lines but not in Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. Therefore, these results suggest that IL-4 induced Stat1 activation, resulting in growth inhibition of colon carcinoma cell lines. Importantly, we present evidence that Stat1 is necessary for IL-4-mediated growth inhibition using Stat1-deficient and Stat1-reconstituted cells. The growth inhibitory effect of IL-4 was diminished in Stat1-deficient cells, whereas it was restored in Stat1-reconstituted cells. In addition, the expression of dominant-negative Stat1 in HT29 cells led to the loss of growth inhibition in response to IL-4. Taken together, our data suggest that IL-4 activates Stat1, leading to cell growth inhibition in colon cancer cells.

To understand the molecular mechanism of cell growth controlled by IL-4, we studied the effect of IL-4 on cell proliferation and STAT activation. We demonstrated that IL-4 induced differential Stat1 activation and growth inhibition in different cell lines. In addition, Stat6 was not essential for IL-4-induced cell growth inhibition. These results indicate that IL-4-mediated Stat1 activation plays a critical role in cell growth inhibition. Human and mouse IL-4 were kindly provided by Schering-Plow Research Institute (Kenilworth, NJ). Antibodies against Stat6 (S-20 and M-200) and Stat1 (N terminus, catalog no. G16930) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA) and Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), respectively. Anti-Stat3 antibody was kindly provided by Dr. Zhong and purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Human colon carcinoma cell lines HT29 and WiDr were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines BL30 and BL41 were kindly provided by Dr. I. George Miller (Yale University). HT29 cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium containing 10% FBS (Life Technologies, Inc). WiDr cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% FBS, and Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines were grown in RPM I1640 containing 10% FBS. To determine cell proliferation by [3H]thymidine incorporation assay, cells at 5 × 103 per well in a 96-well plate were treated with IL-4 at different concentrations for 3 days before pulsing with 1 mCi of [3H]thymidine for 4 h. Cells were then harvested onto glass filters using a microtiter plate cell harvester (Tomtec, CT), and incorporation of radiolabeled thymidine into DNA was determined by scintillation counting. All assays were done in triplicate, and the mean and standard deviations were calculated. EMSA was performed as described previously by Levy et al. (34.Levy D.E. Kessler D.S. Pine R.

Binding reactions were carried out at room temperature for 30 min in a 15-μl total volume containing 13 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 185 mm NaCl, 0.15 mm EDTA, 8% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC):poly(dI-dC), 1 μg of single-stranded DNA, whole cell extracts (15 μg of proteins), and 5′-end 32P-labeled double stranded oligonucleotide (0.1 ng; ∼1 × 104 cpm). Samples were then fractionated in a 5% polyacrylamide gel. For supershift experiments, antibodies (0.1 μg) were added to the reaction after 20-min incubation and the reaction was further incubated for 20 min at room temperature before electrophoresis. The nucleotide sequences of probes were 5′-GTGCATTTCCCGTAATCTTGTCTACAATTC-3′ for m67-SIE (36.Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z.

Biol. 1994; 14: 1500-1509Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 39.Pine R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4346-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The STAT binding core sequence is underlined in each nucleotide. HT29 cells (1 × 107) were transfected with 50 μg of linearized pEFneo, or pEFneo-Stat1Y701F (CYF) by electroporation. Cells were selected with G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 750 μg/ml for 7 days. Individual colonies were cloned, expanded, and analyzed by Western blot analysis and EMSA. To determine the effect of IL-4 on proliferation of HT29, WiDr (colon carcinoma), and BL41 and BL30 (Burkitt's lymphoma) cell lines, cells were treated with IL-4 at different concentrations for 3 days and cell proliferation was determined by [3H]thymidine incorporation assay. As shown in Fig. 1, IL-4 inhibited cell growth of HT29 and WiDr cells but promoted cell growth of BL30 and BL41 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In comparison with nontreated cells, [3H]thymidine incorporation was reduced to approximately 60% in HT29 and WiDr cells with treatment of IL-4 at 1 ng/ml. In contrast, [3H]thymidine incorporation was increased to 3- to 4-fold in BL30 and BL41 cells treated with 10–50 ng/ml of IL-4. Furthermore, the lack of growth inhibition of BL30 and BL40 cells in response to IL-4 was not due to the possibility that these cells were generally refractory to inhibition to cytokines, because IFN-γ was able to inhibit these cells effectively (data not shown). To elucidate whether the cell growth inhibition by IL-4 was caused by an impaired IL-4 signaling pathway in BL30 and BL41 cell lines, Stat6 DNA binding activity was examined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Cells were treated with IL-4 at 20 ng/ml for 30 min, and whole cell extracts were prepared. Using a probe containing a STAT binding site within the IRF-1 promoter (40.Sims S.H. Cha Y. Romine M.F. Gao P.Q. Gottlieb K. Deisseroth A.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 690-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), Stat6 DNA binding activity was present in BL30, BL41, HT29, and WiDr cell lines (Fig.2 A). The probe was used with over 10-fold excesses. The Stat6 activities were measured qualitatively but not quantitatively. In additional experiments, the Stat6 activity induced in WiDr cells (lane 4) was at the same level of other cell lines (Fig. 2 B). The Stat6 major complexes were confirmed by supershifting experiment using antibodies against Stat6 (Fig. 2 A, lane 9). The band just below the Stat6 complex was partially degraded Stat6 protein that could also be supershifted by anti-Stat6 (data not shown). Thus, these results indicated that the differential effects on cell growth in response to IL-4 in these cells were not caused by differential Stat6 activation. We then asked whether other STATs in addition to Stat6 were differentially activated in WiDr, HT29, BL30, and BL41 cell lines in response to IL-4. Whole cell extracts prepared from these cell lines after stimulation with IL-4 for 30 min were incubated with 32P-labeled m67-SIE oligonucleotide, which contains a high affinity DNA binding site for Stat1 and Stat3 (36.Sadowski H.B. Shuai K. Darnell Jr., J.E. Gilman M.Z. Science. 1993; 261: 1739-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar, 41.Wagner B.J. Hayes T.E. Hoban C.J. Cochran B.H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4477-4484Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, we found that IL-4 induced Stat1 DNA binding activities in WiDr and HT29 but not in BL30 and BL41 cells (Fig.3 A). A weak Stat3 activity was also observed. Stat1 and Stat3 complexes were confirmed by supershift analysis using anti-Stat1 or anti-Stat3 antibodies (Fig. 3 A,lanes 9 and 10). Because it was shown that Stat1 has growth inhibitory effect, the finding that IL-4 induced Stat1 activation might provide a mechanism of growth inhibition in HT29 and WiDr cells but not in BL30 and BL41 cells. To examine further whether Stat1 activation by IL-4 is only unique for colon cancer cells or a normal physiological response, mouse splenocytes were isolated and treated with IL-4, and the Stat1 activation was analyzed under the same conditions. Both Stat1 and Stat3 were activated in IL-4-treated splenocytes (Fig. 3 B), indicating that the activation of Stat1 and Stat3 by IL-4 was not an artifact of colon cancer cells. In the above experiments, our results indicated that Stat1 activation correlated with the growth inhibition in response to IL-4. To establish direct evidence demonstrating that Stat1 was involved in IL-4-mediated growth inhibition, we used the Stat1-deficient cell line U3A (42.McKendry R. John J. Flavell D. Muller M. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11455-11459Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and Stat1α-reconstituted U3A-Stat1α cells (35.Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Su W.C. You Z.H. Iwamoto Y. Fu X.Y. Science. 1996; 272: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar) for further analyses. In addition, 2fTGH cells (the parental cell line of U3A) were included. 2fTGH, U3A, and U3A-Stat1α cells were treated with IL-4 at different concentrations for 3 days, and cell proliferation was analyzed by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation. As shown in Fig.4 A, proliferation of 2fTGH was inhibited by IL-4 to 50% with a concentration of 5 ng/ml or greater. In contrast, no significant effect on proliferation of Stat1-deficient U3A cells was observed even at a concentration of 100 ng/ml of IL-4. If the lack of the growth inhibitory effect of IL-4 was caused by Stat1 deficiency, one would expect that the reintroduction of Stat1 to U3A cells should restore the IL-4-mediated growth inhibitory effect. Indeed, the growth inhibitory effect of IL-4 was restored in Stat1α-reconstituted U3A-Stat1α cells (Fig. 4 A), indicating that Stat1 played a critical role in IL-4-mediated growth inhibition. To confirm whether Stat1 was differentially activated in these cells in response to IL-4, 2fTGH, U3A, and U3A-Stat1α cell lines were treated with 20 ng/ml IL-4 for 30 min. As a control, these cells were also treated with 10 ng/ml IFN-γ. Whole cell extracts were prepared, and STAT protein DNA binding activity was analyzed by EMSA. As shown in Fig. 4 B, IL-4 induced Stat1 and Stat3 DNA binding activities in 2fTGH and U3A-Stat1α cells but not in Stat1-deficient U3A cells. The complexes were confirmed by supershifting experiments using antibodies against Stat1 and Stat3 specifically (data not shown). In contrast to differential Stat1/Stat3 DNA binding activities, Stat6 DNA binding activities induced by IL-4 were similar in all three cell lines (data not shown). As expected, IFN-γ induced Stat1 DNA binding activities in 2fTGH and U3A-Stat1α cells but not in U3A cells (Fig.4 B, lanes 7–12) (35.Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Su W.C. You Z.H. Iwamoto Y. Fu X.Y. Science. 1996; 272: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). To further study the function of Stat1 in IL-4-mediated cell growth inhibition in colon cancer cells, we established stable HT29 cells expressing a dominant negative Stat1 protein (Y701F), Stat1-CYF. As shown in Fig. 5 A, IL-4-mediated Stat1/Stat3 DNA binding activities were abolished in cells expressing Stat1-CYF. As expected, Stat1 DNA binding activity induced by IFN-γ was also diminished in Stat1-CYF cells (Fig.5 B). We then asked whether Stat1-mediated gene induction is affected by expression of dominant negative Stat1. Cells were treated with or without IL-4 at 20 ng/ml for 1 h. In addition, cells were also treated with IFN-γ as a control. Total RNA was prepared, andIRF-1 gene induction was analyzed by Northern blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 6 A,IRF-1 mRNA was induced by either IFN-γ or IL-4 in HT29 cells within a 1-h stimulation, whereas it was not induced in cells expressing Stat1-CYF. Moreover, IFN-γ is a stronger inducer forIRF-1 mRNA than IL-4 in HT29 cells (Fig. 6 A,lanes 2 and 3). Interestingly, we also found that IFN-γ had a greater growth inhibitory effect on HT29 cells than IL-4 (data not shown). To examine IL-4-mediated cell growth inhibition in cells expressing Stat1-CYF, cells were treated with IL-4 at different concentrations for 3 days and cell proliferation was analyzed by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation. Consistent with the hypothesis that Stat1 is required for growth inhibition, HT29 cells expressing Stat1-CYF were no longer inhibited by IL-4 treatment even at a concentration as high as to 100 ng/ml, whereas the growth of parental HT29 cells was significantly inhibited by IL-4 (Fig. 6 B). Taken together, these results indicated that Stat1 played a crucial role in cell growth inhibition in response to IL-4. A growth factor or cytokine can have dual effects on cell proliferation: It may stimulate cell growth of one type of cells but inhibit cell growth of another type of cells (43.Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Nature. 1988; 332: 217-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism of such differential effects on cell growth is not well defined. In the case of IL-4, it has been shown that activation of IRS is involved in promoting cell growth; however, little is known on how IL-4 inhibits cell growth. In this study, we have demonstrated that IL-4 induces Stat1 activation that is associated with growth inhibition in colon carcinoma cells. Activation of Stat1/Stat3 by IL-4 was observed not only in colon carcinoma cell lines but also in mouse splenocytes (Fig. 3 B) and other cells such as HeLa cells (data not shown), suggesting that Stat1/Stat3 activation is a common pathway in IL-4 signaling. Therefore, IL-4-mediated Stat1/Stat3 activation may serve as an additional route besides IRS (44.Keegan A.D. Nelms K. Wang L.M. Pierce J.H. Paul W.E. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and Stat6 pathways (Fig. 7). It has been shown that Stat1 activation leads to cell growth inhibition (35.Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Su W.C. You Z.H. Iwamoto Y. Fu X.Y. Science. 1996; 272: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 45.Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Wen Z. Schreiber R.D. Darnell Jr., J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7673-7678Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The first link between Stat1 activation and the growth inhibitory effect of IL-4 was observed by comparing colon carcinoma cells with lymphoma cells. We have further shown evidence that Stat1 is necessary for IL-4-mediated growth inhibition using Stat1-positive cells versus Stat1-deficient cells. In particular, in Stat1-deficient U3A cells, IL-4 could neither activate Stat1 nor induce cell growth inhibition. However, in U3A-Stat1α and the parental 2fTGH cells, IL-4 induced Stat1 activation and inhibited cell growth. Because Stat6 was activated in all these cell types, we conclude that Stat1, rather than Stat6, is involved in IL-4-mediated growth inhibition. We further confirmed that Stat1 is directly involved in IL-4-mediated cell growth inhibition in HT29 cells by introducing a dominant negative Stat1. Our results suggest that Stat1 alone plays a crucial role in growth inhibition by IL-4. Due to lack of Stat3-deficient cells, the exact function of Stat3 in IL-4-mediated growth inhibition is not yet clear. We have shown that IL-4 induces IRF-1 gene expression and growth inhibition of colon carcinoma cell lines but not in BL30 and BL41 cells (data not shown). It has been shown that IRF-1gene induction depends on Stat1 activation (Fig. 6 A) (46.Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5026) Google Scholar), and the IRF-1 gene may play a significant role in negatively controlling cell growth (47.Taniguchi T. Lamphier M.S. Tanaka N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: M9-M17Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). However, we do not know whetherIRF-1 gene induction is the only factor involved in observed growth inhibition. It has been shown that Stat1 regulates p21CIP/WAF1, leading to cell growth arrest (35.Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Su W.C. You Z.H. Iwamoto Y. Fu X.Y. Science. 1996; 272: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Our recent data indicate that IL-4 also induces p21CIP/WAF1 in 2fTGH cells but not in Stat1-deficient U3A cells (data not shown). Therefore, several downstream genes such as IRF-1 and CDK inhibitors may jointly play roles in IL-4-mediated cell growth inhibition. Furthermore, we have also examined whether apoptosis is a factor for reduced cell growth of these colon cancer cells. We have examined cells that were treated with IL-4 for 4 days and did not observe an apoptosis increase (data not shown). Thus, we believe that the observed 50% growth inhibition (Fig. 1) after IL-4 treatment was not due to apoptosis of these colon cancer cells. It remains unclear how IL-4 differentially activates Stat1 in different cell lines. It has been shown that HT29 and WiDr cells do not express IL-2R common γ chain (48.Murata T. Noguchi P.D. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30829-30836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). IL-4 induces phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK2, and Tyk2 but not JAK3, and only JAK2 is associated with the IL-4 receptor in these colon carcinoma cells (48.Murata T. Noguchi P.D. Puri R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30829-30836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 49.Murata T. Noguchi P.D. Puri R.K. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2972-2978PubMed Google Scholar). However, IL-4 induces JAK1 and JAK3 that are associated with IL-4 receptor and the common γ chain, respectively, in lymphocytes. Our preliminary results indicated that IRF-1 gene expression was induced by IL-4 in splenocytes from JAK3 (−/−) mice, suggesting that IL-4-mediatedIRF-1 gene induction did not require JAK3. Thus, determination of which Janus kinases activate Stat1 in immune cells and tumor cells may help to understand contrasting effects of IL-4 on cell proliferation. Based on our results presented here and previous findings, we propose a model for IL-4 signaling in regulation of cell growth and the immune system (Fig. 7). Binding of IL-4 to its receptor can trigger at least three signaling pathways mediated through IRS proteins, Stat6, and Stat1/Stat3. Activated IRS-1 and IRS-2 associate with proteins containing Src homology 2 domains, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2, and SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2, leading to cell proliferation (28.Keegan A.D.

Schindler U. Smiley S.T. Grusby M.J.

Our data indicate that IL-4 induces Stat1 activation and up-regulates additional gene expression (such asIRF-1), resulting in growth inhibition of colon carcinoma cells. This model provides an explanation for the differential effects of IL-4 on cell growth in BL30 and HT29 cell lines. Analysis of IRS-1 phosphorylation indicated that IRS-1 was activated in BL30 cells in response to IL-4 (data not shown). Thus, when a positive signal (IRS-1) is activated and no negative signal (Stat1) is present, IL-4 promotes cell growth. However, once a negative signal is present, which may override the positive signal, IL-4 inhibits cell growth. Taken together, this study provides a molecular basis for the inhibition of cell growth in response to IL-4. We are grateful to J. N. Ihle for providing Stat6 (−/−) mice, R. Pine for anti-IRF-1 antibodies, I. G. Miller for B-lymphoma cells, and Schering-Plow Research Institute (Kenilworth, NJ) for IL-4. We thank R. Pine, H. Asao, M. Kitagawa, W.-C. S. Su, T.

The deletion mutants gave distinct cross-linking patterns to the Toc and Tic components of the import machinery, consistent with the binding and import properties obtained in in vitro import assays. The cross-linking results revealed two separate properties of the transit peptide: first the presentation of specific binding domains for the initial interaction with outer membrane components, and second the presence of different domains for interaction with the outer and inner membrane components of the transport machinery for full envelope translocation. The N-terminal Δ6–14 deletion blocked import of the precursor at the Toc components, whereas the more internal deletion Δ15–25 blocked import at the Tic components. The information for association with the outer and inner membrane components therefore resides in two separate but partly overlapping domains in the first 25 amino acids of the transit sequence.

Perhaps the most complex organization is found in higher plants. In addition to the nucleus, peroxisomes, mitochondria, and the secretory machinery, plant cells also contain plastids. The predominant plastid in leaves is the chloroplast. The majority of chloroplastic proteins are nuclear-encoded and are translated on cytoplasmic ribosomes. These proteins are post-transitionally imported into the chloroplast, sorted within the chloroplast, and assembled into their functional native forms. Chloroplast biogenesis is therefore dependent upon a protein import apparatus that recognizes and translocates these proteins (for reviews see Refs. 1.Chen X. Schnell D.J. Trends. Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar and 2.Keegstra K. Cline K. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar).Recognition and translocation at the outer membrane are mediated by interactions of the transit sequence of the precursor with the Toc complex (translocon at the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts) (3.Schnell D.J. Blobel G. Keegstra K. Kessler F. Ko K. Soll J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 303-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The Toc complex consists of at least three proteins Toc34, Toc75, and Toc86 that mediate the initial interaction of the precursor with the chloroplast (4.Waegemann K. Soll J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1677-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that Toc86 is a proteolytic fragment of a larger 159-kDa protein, called Toc159 (10.Bolter B. May T.

The 86-kDa fragment of Toc159 is sufficient for all stages of precursor interaction with the chloroplast in vitro (11.Chen K. Chen X. Schnell D. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 813Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and Toc86 chloroplasts are fully import competent. The standard isolation protocol of chloroplasts, used in this study, results in the proteolysis of Toc159 into the 86-kDa fragment. Toc75 is a putative channel (5.Schnell D.J. Kessler F. Blobel G.

Deletion mutant Δ11–14 was selected as it can still be imported by the chloroplast although with a very low efficiency (∼20% compared with the wild type).

All five deletion mutants can be processed in in vitroprocessing assays. To test the importance of the different domains of the preferredoxin transit sequence, we wished to investigate the interactions of these five mutant precursors with components of the import apparatus. Hereto, the deletion mutants were covalently cross-linked with the import machinery during binding and import using a label transfer cross-linking strategy.The first domain, the N-terminal domain, was found to be necessary for outer membrane translocation, and the second domain, the middle region of the transit sequence, was required for inner membrane translocation, confirming the presence of functional domains within the transit sequence at the molecular level of the Toc and Tic components. The cross-linking data are consistent with the in vitro binding, import, and competition results, indicating that the competition of the deletion mutants with the wild-type transit sequence was indeed at the same components.DISCUSSIONIn vitro import experiments with deletion mutants in the ferredoxin transit sequence revealed a high information content of this targeting sequence (25.Pilon M.

Most deletions interfere with the overall efficiency of import but different deletions identified separate domains within the transit sequence. The first, N-terminal domain mediates the initial binding.

Weisbeek P. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this study a label transfer cross-linking strategy was used to study the interactions of the various deletion mutants in the transit sequence with components of the translocation machinery. The results of the cross-linking after the three different stages of import are summarized in Fig. 6 and compared with the previously obtained in vitro and in vivoimport data (25.Pilon M. Wienk H. Sips W. de Swaaf M. Talboom I. van't Hof R. de Korte-Kool G. Demel R. Weisbeek P.J. de Kruijff B. J. Biol.

Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The interactions observed between the full-length wild-type preferredoxin precursors and the import machinery were consistent with the results of similar cross-linking strategies using the precursor of the Rubisco small subunit (6.Perry S.E. Keegstra K. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 9.Kouranov A. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1677-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 14.Ma Y. Kouranov A. Lasala S.E. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).The most C-terminal deletion used, Δ43–45, resulted in a cross-linking pattern similar to the full-length transit sequence. This mutant is processed inefficiently, as significant amounts of precursor-sized protein could be detected in the stroma after import. This illustrates that import and processing are not strictly coupled, as was shown before in vivo (26.Rensink W.A. Pilon M. Weisbeek P. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The lower binding efficiency of deletion mutant Δ43–45 (25.Pilon M. Wienk H. Sips W. de Swaaf M. Talboom I. van't Hof R. de Korte-Kool G. Demel R. Weisbeek P.J. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3882-3893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) is reflected by the lower affinity for Toc86.A deletion in the central region of the transit sequence, represented by Δ15–25, resulted in under import conditions in a cross-linking pattern with the Toc components similar to the wild-type pattern, indicating normal interactions with the Toc components. Although Δ15–25 could not be imported, the precursor or part of it had crossed the outer membrane as judged from the labeling of Tic20, the 14-kDa protein, and a stromal protein. Therefore it can be concluded that the central region of the transit sequence is required for inner membrane translocation. These results also explain why deletion mutant Δ15–25 is a strong competitor for import although it cannot be imported. Different interactions, as compared with the wild-type, were observed under binding conditions in the absence or presence of ATP. The interaction with Toc86 is slightly decreased in the absence of ATP, whereas the labeling of Toc75 is much higher compared with the wild-type. One conclusion is that the affinity of Toc86 for Δ15–25 is lower than for the wild-type transit sequence and that under these conditions Δ15–25 is partially released from Toc86 to reach the next component of the import machinery such as Toc75. In the presence of ATP almost no cross-linked products could be detected. Apparently under these conditions no stable association with the import machinery could be established. After initial binding the deletion mutant Δ15–25 is pulled out of the import machinery instead of being transferred to the next stage of import. This result indicates that the central region of the transit sequence also contains motifs for recognition at the Toc components of the outer membrane.Cross-linking of the N-terminal deletion mutant Δ6–14 resulted in hardly any cross-linked products, only under binding conditions and after import could minimal labeling of Toc86 be observed. This decreased labeling of Toc86 indicates that this component plays an important role in the initial stages of the import process, consistent with its proposed function (1.Chen X. Schnell D.J. Trends. Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 2.Keegstra K. Cline K. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Δ6–14 interacts with Toc86 but not with Toc75, which indicates that it cannot be released properly from Toc86. The N-terminal region of the transit sequence has a tendency to form an amphipathic helix in the presence of lipids (35.Wienk H.L. Czisch M. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As this helix can not be formed in the deletion mutant Δ6–14, the formation of this helix may be important for the correct release of the precursor from Toc86. This is further supported by the finding that deletion mutant Δ6–14 cannot be inserted in monolayers mimicking the chloroplast outer membrane lipid composition (25.Pilon M. Wienk H. Sips W. de Swaaf M. Talboom I. van't Hof R. de Korte-Kool G. Demel R. Weisbeek P.J. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3882-3893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The cross-linking pattern of Δ11–14 was similar to the cross-linking pattern of deletion mutant Δ15–25. Thus for the same reason as with Δ15–25 the deletion mutant Δ11–14 is disturbed in the binding to Toc86 and the inner membrane interactions. In contrast to Δ15–25, Δ11–14 can be imported with a low efficiency. This suggests that the Δ11–14 deletion forms the overlap between the outer and inner membrane translocation domains having just enough information for full envelope translocation. The proposed functions of the different domains are indicated in the bottom panel of Fig. 6.The whole transit sequence is important for the overall efficiency of binding and import (25.Pilon M. Wienk H. Sips W. de Swaaf M. Talboom I. van't Hof R. de Korte-Kool G. Demel R. Weisbeek P.J. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3882-3893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 26.Rensink W.A. Pilon M. Weisbeek P. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This is the result of two separate aspects of the transit peptide: first the presentation of specific binding domains for the interaction with outer membrane components, as all deletion mutants had a different cross-linking pattern compared with the wild-type in the initial import reactions; and second the presence of different domains for interaction with the outer and inner membrane components of the transport machinery, as after import Δ6–14, Δ11–14, and Δ15–25 have distinct cross-linking patterns to inner and outer membrane components. In this study it is shown that region 6–14 of the transit sequence contains essential information for binding to the outer membrane component Toc86, as deletion mutant Δ6–14 almost completely fails to cross-link to Toc86. The region 15–25 also affects the interaction with toc86 but to a lesser extent and mainly under nonimport conditions. In addition, this region contains information for interaction with components of the inner membrane, as indicated by the cross-linking of deletion mutant Δ15–25 to Tic20 and the 14-kDa protein. As deletion mutant Δ6–14 never reaches the inner membrane, no conclusion can be drawn for the importance of amino acids 6–14 for inner membrane interaction.No region was found with specificity for interaction with Toc75. Deletion mutants Δ11–14 and Δ15–25 show increased binding to Toc75 under binding conditions, but we interpret this as the result of a decreased affinity for Toc86 rather than an increased affinity for Toc75. The information for association with the outer and inner membrane components therefore resides in two separate but partly overlapping domains in the first 25 amino acids of the transit sequence. One of the characteristic features of eukaryotic cells is their subcellular organization. Perhaps the most complex organization is found in higher plants. In addition to the nucleus, peroxisomes, mitochondria, and the secretory machinery, plant cells also contain plastids. The predominant plastid in leaves is the chloroplast. The majority of chloroplastic proteins are nuclear-encoded and are translated on cytoplasmic ribosomes. These proteins are post-transitionally imported into the chloroplast, sorted within the chloroplast, and assembled into their functional native forms. Chloroplast biogenesis is therefore dependent upon a protein import apparatus that recognizes and translocates these proteins (for reviews see Refs. 1.Chen X. Schnell D.J. Trends. Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar and 2.Keegstra K. Cline K. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Recognition and translocation at the outer membrane are mediated by interactions of the transit sequence of the precursor with the Toc complex (translocon at the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts) (3.Schnell D.J. Blobel G. Keegstra K. Kessler F. Ko K. Soll J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 303-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The Toc complex consists of at least three proteins Toc34, Toc75, and Toc86 that mediate the initial interaction of the precursor with the chloroplast (4.Waegemann K. Soll J. Plant J. 1991; 1: 149-158Crossref Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 5.Schnell D.J. Kessler F. Blobel G. Science. 1994; 266: 1007-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 6.Perry S.E. Keegstra K. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Toc34 and Toc86 are GTP-binding proteins (7.Hirsch S. Muckel E. Heemeyer F. Vonheijne G. Soll J. Science. 1994; 266: 1989-1992Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 8.Kessler F. Blobel G. Patel H.A. Schnell D.J. Science. 1994; 266: 1035-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) that interact directly with the precursor during recognition at the outer membrane (9.Kouranov A. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1677-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that Toc86 is a proteolytic fragment of a larger 159-kDa protein, called Toc159 (10.Bolter B. May T. Soll J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 11.Chen K. Chen X. Schnell D. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 813Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The 86-kDa fragment of Toc159 is sufficient for all stages of precursor interaction with the chloroplast in vitro (11.Chen K. Chen X. Schnell D. Plant Physiol. 2000; 122: 813Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and Toc86 chloroplasts are fully import competent. The standard isolation protocol of chloroplasts, used in this study, results in the proteolysis of Toc159 into the 86-kDa fragment. Toc75 is a putative channel (5.Schnell D.J. Kessler F. Blobel G.

Kouranov A. Lasala S.E. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Several components of the inner membrane translocon (Tics) have been identified: Tic20, Tic22, Tic55, and Tic110. (5.Schnell D.J. Kessler F. Blobel G.

Tic20 is a putative candidate for the inner membrane channel, whereas Tic110 may function as a stromal docking site for the hsp60 and ClpC molecular chaperone (19.Kessler F. Blobel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 7684-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The chaperones are proposed to participate in driving transport across the inner membrane or in folding of newly imported precursors (20.Nielsen E. Akita M. Davilaaponte J. Keegstra K. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 935-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The stromal processing peptidase involved in processing newly imported preproteins also has been identified (21.Oblong J.E.

The interactions observed between the full-length wild-type preferredoxin precursors and the import machinery were consistent with the results of similar cross-linking strategies using the precursor of the Rubisco small subunit (6.Perry S.E. Keegstra K. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 9.Kouranov A. Schnell D.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1677-1685Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 14.Ma Y.

Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 315-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).The most C-terminal deletion used, Δ43–45, resulted in a cross-linking pattern similar to the full-length transit sequence. This mutant is processed inefficiently, as significant amounts of precursor-sized protein could be detected in the stroma after import. This illustrates that import and processing are not strictly coupled, as was shown before in vivo (26.Rensink W.A. Pilon M. Weisbeek P. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The lower binding efficiency of deletion mutant Δ43–45 (25.Pilon M. Wienk H. Sips W. de Swaaf M. Talboom I. van't Hof R. de Korte-Kool G. Demel R. Weisbeek P.J. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3882-3893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) is reflected by the lower affinity for Toc86.A deletion in the central region of the transit sequence, represented by Δ15–25, resulted in under import conditions in a cross-linking pattern with the Toc components similar to the wild-type pattern, indicating normal interactions with the Toc components. Although Δ15–25 could not be imported, the precursor or part of it had crossed the outer membrane as judged from the labeling of Tic20, the 14-kDa protein, and a stromal protein. Therefore it can be concluded that the central region of the transit sequence is required for inner membrane translocation. These results also explain why deletion mutant Δ15–25 is a strong competitor for import although it cannot be imported. Different interactions, as compared with the wild-type, were observed under binding conditions in the absence or presence of ATP. The interaction with Toc86 is slightly decreased in the absence of ATP, whereas the labeling of Toc75 is much higher compared with the wild-type. One conclusion is that the affinity of Toc86 for Δ15–25 is lower than for the wild-type transit sequence and that under these conditions Δ15–25 is partially released from Toc86 to reach the next component of the import machinery such as Toc75. In the presence of ATP almost no cross-linked products could be detected. Apparently under these conditions no stable association with the import machinery could be established. After initial binding the deletion mutant Δ15–25 is pulled out of the import machinery instead of being transferred to the next stage of import. This result indicates that the central region of the transit sequence also contains motifs for recognition at the Toc components of the outer membrane.Cross-linking of the N-terminal deletion mutant Δ6–14 resulted in hardly any cross-linked products, only under binding conditions and after import could minimal labeling of Toc86 be observed. This decreased labeling of Toc86 indicates that this component plays an important role in the initial stages of the import process, consistent with its proposed function (1.Chen X. Schnell D.J. Trends. Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 2.Keegstra K. Cline K. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 557-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Δ6–14 interacts with Toc86 but not with Toc75, which indicates that it cannot be released properly from Toc86. The N-terminal region of the transit sequence has a tendency to form an amphipathic helix in the presence of lipids (35.Wienk H.L. Czisch M. de Kruijff B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 318-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As this helix can not be formed in the deletion mutant Δ6–14, the formation of this helix may be important for the correct release of the precursor from Toc86. This is further supported by the finding that deletion mutant Δ6–14 cannot be inserted in monolayers mimicking the chloroplast outer membrane lipid composition (25.Pilon M. Wienk H. Sips W. de Swaaf M. Talboom I. van't Hof R. de Korte-Kool G. Demel R. Weisbeek P.J. de Kruijff B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3882-3893Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The cross-linking pattern of Δ11–14 was similar to the cross-linking pattern of deletion mutant Δ15–25. Thus for the same reason as with Δ15–25 the deletion mutant Δ11–14 is disturbed in the binding to Toc86 and the inner membrane interactions. In contrast to Δ15–25, Δ11–14 can be imported with a low efficiency. This suggests that the Δ11–14 deletion forms the overlap between the outer and inner membrane translocation domains having just enough information for full envelope translocation. The proposed functions of the different domains are indicated in the bottom panel of Fig. 6.The whole transit sequence is important for the overall efficiency of binding and import (25.Pilon M. Wienk H. Sips W. de Swaaf M. Talboom I. van't Hof R. de Korte-Kool G. Demel R. Weisbeek P.J. de Kruijff B. J. Biol.

Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This is the result of two separate aspects of the transit peptide: first the presentation of specific binding domains for the interaction with outer membrane components, as all deletion mutants had a different cross-linking pattern compared with the wild-type in the initial import reactions; and second the presence of different domains for interaction with the outer and inner membrane components of the transport machinery, as after import Δ6–14, Δ11–14, and Δ15–25 have distinct cross-linking patterns to inner and outer membrane components. In this study it is shown that region 6–14 of the transit sequence contains essential information for binding to the outer membrane component Toc86, as deletion mutant Δ6–14 almost completely fails to cross-link to Toc86. The region 15–25 also affects the interaction with toc86 but to a lesser extent and mainly under nonimport conditions. In addition, this region contains information for interaction with components of the inner membrane, as indicated by the cross-linking of deletion mutant Δ15–25 to Tic20 and the 14-kDa protein. As deletion mutant Δ6–14 never reaches the inner membrane, no conclusion can be drawn for the importance of amino acids 6–14 for inner membrane interaction.No region was found with specificity for interaction with Toc75. Deletion mutants Δ11–14 and Δ15–25 show increased binding to Toc75 under binding conditions, but we interpret this as the result of a decreased affinity for Toc86 rather than an increased affinity for Toc75. The information for association with the outer and inner membrane components therefore resides in two separate but partly overlapping domains in the first 25 amino acids of the transit sequence. In vitro import experiments with deletion mutants in the ferredoxin transit sequence revealed a high information content of this targeting sequence (25.Pilon M. Wienk H. Sips W. de Swaaf M.

Most deletions interfere with the overall efficiency of import but different deletions identified separate domains within the transit sequence. The first, N-terminal domain mediates the initial binding. The second domain, the middle region of the transit sequence, is involved in envelope translocation after the initial recognition, and the third domain consisting of the C-terminal region is mainly involved in processing (25.Pilon M. Wienk H. Sips W. de Swaaf M. Talboom I. van't Hof R. de Korte-Kool G. Demel R. Weisbeek P.J. de Kruijff B. J. Biol.

Weisbeek P. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 691-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In this study a label transfer cross-linking strategy was used to study the interactions of the various deletion mutants in the transit sequence with components of the translocation machinery. The results of the cross-linking after the three different stages of import are summarized in Fig. 6 and compared with the previously obtained in vitro and in vivoimport data (25.Pilon M. Wienk H.

https://openalex.org/W2004537352,"The specific (i, i+5) hydrophobic staple interaction involving a helix residue and a second residue located in the turn preceding the helix is a recurrent motif at the N terminus of α-helices. This motif is strictly conserved in the core of all soluble glutathione transferases (GSTs) as well as in other protein structures. Human GSTP1-1 variants mutated in amino acid Ile149 and Tyr154 of the hydrophobic staple motif of the α6-helix were analyzed. In particular, a double mutant cycle analysis has been performed to evaluate the role of the hydrophobic staple motif in the refolding process. The results show that this local interaction, by restricting the number of conformations of the α6-helix relative to the α1-helix, favors the formation of essential interdomain interactions and thereby accelerates the folding process. Thus, for the first time it is shown that the hydrophobic staple interaction has a role in the folding process of an intact protein. In Pi class GSTs, Tyr154 appears to be of particular structural importance, since it interacts with conserved residues Leu21, Asp24, and Gln25 of the adjacent α1-helix which contributes to the active site. Human GSTP1-1 variants L21A and Y154F have also been analyzed in order to distinguish the role of interdomain interactions from that of the hydrophobic staple. The experimental results reported here suggest that the strict conservation of the hydrophobic staple motif reflects an evolutionary pressure for proteins to fold rapidly.

The experimental results reported here suggest that the strict conservation of the hydrophobic staple motif reflects an evolutionary pressure for proteins to fold rapidly. glutathioneS-transferase glutathione 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene It is known that the folded conformation adopted by a protein is governed by its amino acid sequence, suggesting an underlying stereochemical code for protein folding. Current protein folding models attribute a critical role to local interactions that reduce the conformational freedom at certain points of the polypeptide chain and thus define the folding pathways. Consequently, significant attention has recently been directed to identifying local motifs responsible for the formation of secondary structure element as well as of supersecondary regions including combination of such elements. At the N terminus of helices two local motifs have been described. The first one, named the N-capping box (1.Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Science. 1988; 240: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar, 2.Presta L.G. Rose G.D. Science. 1988; 240: 1632-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar), involves the reciprocal main chain-side chain hydrogen bonds between the N-cap (Ser/Thr) and the N-3 (Glu/Asp) residues of a helix. (We follow the nomenclature proposed by Richardson and Richardson (1.Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Science. 1988; 240: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar): N“-N′-Ncap-N1-N2-N3-N4; where N1-N4 belong to the helix and N-cap is the boundary residue.) The second one, termed the hydrophobic staple motif (3.Seale J.W. Srinivasan R. Rose D.G. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1741-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 4.Munoz V. Blanco F.L. Serrano L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 5.Munoz V. Serrano L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15301-15306Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), involves a specific hydrophobic interaction between residues located at the N′ and N-4 positions. A global survey of helix capping in proteins of known structure has recently been reported (6.Aurora R. Rose G.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 21-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). When present in combination with a capping box (expanded box (3.Seale J.W. Srinivasan R. Rose D.G. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1741-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar)), the hydrophobic staple motif gives a cooperative effect in defining the α-helix starting point. In a statistical analysis (4.Munoz V. Blanco F.L. Serrano L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) its presence in the absence of a capping box has also been shown, suggesting that it may represent an independent motif. Analysis of protein structures in data bases as well as studies involving short peptides have shown that residues at positions N′ and N-cap adopt dihedral angles characteristic of the β-region of Ramachandran plots (4.Munoz V. Blanco F.L. Serrano L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It has therefore been hypothesized that the hydrophobic staple motif may serve to determine the direction of a polypeptide chain as it forms the α-helix (4.Munoz V. Blanco F.L. Serrano L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 5.Munoz V. Serrano L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15301-15306Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, the function of the hydrophobic staple motif still remains to be clarified. Notably, its suggested contribution to folding and stability has never been studied experimentally in a protein, despite of its frequent occurrence at the N terminus of helices. Glutathione transferases (GSTs)1 are a superfamily of detoxication enzymes (7.Hayes J.D. Pulford D.J. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30 (600): 445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3267) Google Scholar) that catalyze the nucleophilic attack of glutathione (GSH) on the electrophilic groups of a wide range of hydrophobic toxic compounds (8.Mannervik B. Danielson U.H. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 23: 283-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1688) Google Scholar). GSTs are dimeric proteins in which each 25-kDa subunit is characterized by two distinct domains and an active site that acts independently of the other subunit. The smaller N-terminal domain (domain I) adopts an α/β topology and contributes most of the contacts to GSH. The C-terminal domain (domain II) is all α-helical and provides most of the amino acid residues of the hydrophobic substrate-binding site which lies adjacent to the GSH-binding site (9.Armstrong R.N. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1997; 10: 2-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar, 10.Reinemer P. Dirr H.W. Ladenstein R. Schaffer J. Gallay O. Huber R.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2133-2143Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that amino acid residues forming an N-capping box and a hydrophobic staple motif at the N terminus of the α6-helix in domain II, are strictly conserved in all known sequences of soluble GSTs (more than 50) (14.Aceto A. Dragani B. Melino S. Allocati N. Masulli M. Di Ilio C. Petruzzelli R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). While the N-capping box, being involved in the α6-helix formation, is essential to the folding of GSTs (15.Dragani B. Stenberg G. Melino S. Petruzzelli R. Mannervik B. Aceto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25518-25523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), the possible role of the hydrophobic staple motif in the refolding of GST is still unknown. It should be noted that it is located in the hydrophobic core of the GSTs and that, in a very similar structural environment, it is also conserved in other protein superfamilies (16.Koonin E.V. Mushegian A.R. Tatusov R.L. Altshul S.F. Bryant S.H. Bork P. Valencia A. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 2045-2054Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Thus, GSTs serve as good model proteins for investigations of the specific role played by this supersecondary interaction in protein folding. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to change the amino acid residues forming the hydrophobic staple motif in the human enzyme GSTP1-1. The results indicate that the interaction between the side chains of the loop residue N′ and the α6-helix residue N-4 favors the appropriate conformation of the α6-helix with respect to the preceding structural element thereby enhancing the rate of protein folding and defining the folding pathway. Wild-type human GSTP1-1 was obtained by expression of a cloned cDNA in Escherichia coli XL-1 Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described previously (17.Kolm R.H. Stenberg G. Widersten M. Mannervik B. Protein Exp. Purif. 1995; 6: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). GSH and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) were purchased from Sigma. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to generate the hydrophobic staple mutants. The following oligonucleotides were used for the mutations: I149A, 5′- GACCAGGCTTCCTTCGCTGACTACAACCTGCTG- 3′; I149G, 5′-GACCAGGGCTCCTTCGCTGACTACAACCTGCTG-3′; Y154A, 5′-GACCAGATCTCCTTCGCTGACGCTAACCTGCTG-3′; T154F, 5′-GACCAGATCTCCTTCGCTGACTTCAACCTGCTG-3′; I149A/Y154A, 5′-GACCAGGCTTCCTTCGCTGACGCTAACCTGCTG-3′; I149G/Y154A, 5′- GACCAGGGCTCCTTCGCTGACGCTAACCTGCTG-3′; I149G/Y154F, 5′-GACCAGGGCTCCTTCGCTGACTTCAACCTGCTG-3′. The reverse primer had the sequence: 5′-TCCCACAATGAAGGTCTTGCCTCCCTGGTTCTG-3′. For the L21A mutation the mutagenic primer was: 5′-CGTATGGCGCTGGCTGACCAGGGTCAG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CAGTGCAGCGCAACGACCACGAACTGG-3′. Altered nucleotides are underlined. Oligonucleotides were phosphorylated and then used in pairs of one mutagenic and the reverse primer in inverted polymerase chain reaction. The expression clone pKHP1 (17.Kolm R.H. Stenberg G. Widersten M. Mannervik B. Protein Exp. Purif. 1995; 6: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) was used as a template. The polymerase chain reaction mixture contained 0.8 μm of each primer, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 2.5 units ofPfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), the buffer supplied with the enzyme and various amounts of DNA template. The temperature program started at 94 °C for 10 min and was followed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 70 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 9 min. The program terminated with a reaction at 72 °C for 30 min. After electrophoresis the polymerase chain reaction product was recovered from the agarose gel. The DNA was ligated and used to transform E. coli XL-1 Blue cells. The cDNA encoding the isolated GSTP1-1 mutants was sequenced in its entirety to verify that no undesired mutations had been introduced in the polymerase chain reaction. Cultures of E. coliXL-1 Blue containing plasmids were grown in 500 ml of LB broth in a 2-liter Erlenmeyer flask at 37 °C. At an A 555of 0.35, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mm. From the time of addition the culture was grown for about 20 h at two different temperatures of incubation, i.e. 25 and 37 °C. The subsequent purification of wild-type and mutant proteins, expressed at different growth temperatures, was performed as described previously (18.Aceto A. Caccuri A.M. Sacchetta P. Bucciarelli T. Dragani B. Rosato N. Federici G. Di Ilio C. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 241-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) with the only modification that the enzymes were purified on a GSH-Sepharose affinity column. The intracellular protein yields of GST in bacteria were expressed as percentage of GST purified in relation to total cytosolic protein. The GST activity in the cytosol and the level of protein expression were also determined as a function of temperature. The kinetic parameters, k cat and K m, were determined at 25 °C as described previously (19.Aceto A. Di Ilio C. Lo Bello M. Bucciarelli T. Angelucci S. Federici G. Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 2267-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The saturating concentrations for GSH and CDNB were 2 and 1 mm, respectively. Spectroscopic properties of the mutants and the wild-type enzyme were also studied. A Jasco-600 spectropolarimeter was used for CD measurements in the far-ultraviolet region from 200 to 250 nm. Spectra were recorded at 0.3 mg/ml protein concentration with cuvettes of 0.1-cm path length in a thermostatic cell holder. Intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra were measured with a Spex (model Fluoromax) spectrofluorometer. The excitation wavelength was 280 nm and the λmax and the fluorescence intensity of emission spectra were analyzed at a protein concentration of 0.1 mg/ml. Enzyme was incubated at each temperature for 10 min at a protein concentration of 0.05 mg/ml in 0.1m potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) containing 1 mmEDTA and 5 mm dithiothreitol to prevent oxidative inactivation. The enzyme was heat inactivated in sealed Eppendorf tubes and the temperature was monitored with a Cryson telethermometer. The inactivation time courses were determined by withdrawing suitable aliquots at different time points from the denaturation mixture for assay of remaining activity. The activity was assayed in 0.1m potassium phosphate (pH 6.5) with 2 mm GSH and 1 mm CDNB at 25 °C. In no case could the thermal inactivation be reversed by lowering the temperature of incubation. When the refolding of human GSTP1-1 and its mutants was to be monitored, 10 μm enzyme was first denatured in 4 m guanidinium chloride (0.2m phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.0) at 25, 32, and 40 °C for 30 min and then diluted (defining time 0) 1:40 into renaturation buffer (0.2m phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.0) at the same temperature. The final guanidinium chloride concentration was 0.1 m during refolding. All refolding experiments were carried out by rapid addition of the denatured enzyme to the renaturation buffer. Recovered activity was monitored as a function of time by withdrawal of appropriate aliquots of the renaturation mixture and immediate assay for activity at 25 °C. Refolding rate constants were determined by nonlinear regression analysis of the experimental data by using the KaleidaGraph 3.0.5 program (Abelbek Software). The refolding rate of all variants were independent, in the range 5 to 50 μm, of the protein concentration. At even higher enzyme concentration all variants were characterized by a reduced refolding yield. The values reported in this paper represent the mean of at least three different experimental data sets. Under our conditions, an equation describing a single exponential process can be fitted to the data,F(t)=A[1−exp(−kft)]+BEquation 1 where F(t) is the activity at timet, A the amplitude, k f the rate constant, and B the reactivation value at time 0. The effect of mutation on the energy of the transition state of folding can be calculated using transition-state theory in a similar manner to that reported by Jackson et al. (20.Jackson S.E. elMasry N. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11270-11278Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The stability of the transition state of a mutant protein relative to that of wild-type is calculated from,ΔΔGf=−RTln(kf/kf′)Equation 2 where ΔΔG f is the difference in energy of the transition state of folding relative to the unfolded state between wild-type and mutant proteins; k f andk f′ are the respective rate constants of folding. Double mutant cycles have been used to calculate ΔΔG int, the interaction energy between two residues in a protein, under conditions in which they can also make additional interactions. ΔΔG int is obtained by subtraction of the ΔΔG f values of the corresponding single mutants from the ΔΔG f of the double mutant, calculated as above. The general theory of double mutant cycle analysis has been discussed extensively elsewhere (21.Horowitz A. Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 214: 613-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). It is assumed that the ΔΔG int is 0 in the unfolded state and this is taken as the reference state. The reactivation behavior of all GSTP1-1 variants can be described by a single exponential equation. Thus, we have assumed: (i) that the enzyme reactivation follows, kinetically, a two-state model without intermediates so that the refolding rate, measured under native-like conditions, can be used to characterize the transition state for folding; (ii) that none of the mutations have any significant effect on the folding pathway, at least not when analyzed at subphysiological temperatures. Coordinates of GST x-ray structures were derived from the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank via the Anonymous file-transfer protocol. The crystal structures were analyzed by using Hyperchem (22.Weiner S.J. Kollman P.A. Case D.A. Singh U.C. Ghio C. Alagona G. Profeta J.S. Weiner P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 765Crossref Scopus (4895) Google Scholar) (Autodesk, Sausalito, CA) and MolView 1.4.6 (Purdue University) programs. Figures were generated by using the RasMol (version 2.6) program. At the N terminus of the α6-helix in domain II, the sequence (Ser/Thr)XXAsp is conserved in the alpha, mu, Pi, theta, and sigma classes of GSTs. We have recently demonstrated that this motif corresponds to a “capping box” signal (1.Richardson J.S. Richardson D.C. Science. 1988; 240: 1648-1652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1299) Google Scholar, 2.Presta L.G. Rose G.D. Science. 1988; 240: 1632-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar, 6.Aurora R. Rose G.D. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 21-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar) which exerts a strong influence on the α6-helix nucleation (14.Aceto A. Dragani B. Melino S. Allocati N. Masulli M. Di Ilio C. Petruzzelli R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) as well as on GST folding (15.Dragani B. Stenberg G. Melino S. Petruzzelli R. Mannervik B. Aceto A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25518-25523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The sequence analysis has also revealed the presence of a second structural motif conserved at the N terminus of the α6-helix in GSTs of the same classes (14.Aceto A. Dragani B. Melino S. Allocati N. Masulli M. Di Ilio C. Petruzzelli R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). This motif seems to correspond to a specific (i, i+5) hydrophobic interaction, named the hydrophobic staple motif (3.Seale J.W. Srinivasan R. Rose D.G. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1741-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 4.Munoz V. Blanco F.L. Serrano L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 5.Munoz V. Serrano L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15301-15306Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), between the residue N′ located before the N-cap and the residue located at position N-4 within the helix (residues Ile149 and Tyr154 in GSTP1-1, respectively). It has been suggested (4.Munoz V. Blanco F.L. Serrano L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) that this motif, flanking the capping box, enhances the demarcation of the N terminus limit and serves to cause a reversal of the polypeptide chain direction as it forms the α-helix. Three-dimensional structure analysis of GSTs shows that the side chains of the hydrophobic residues at the N′ and N-4 positions are located within a distance of 4 Å from each other in all known GST structures and that the N′ and N-cap residues always adopt dihedral angles in the β-region of the Ramachandran plot. Thus, this supersecondary interaction possesses all structural characteristics of a hydrophobic staple motif and, despite the low overall sequence identity (in some cases less than 5%), is well conserved among GSTs and GST-related proteins (14.Aceto A. Dragani B. Melino S. Allocati N. Masulli M. Di Ilio C. Petruzzelli R. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, residue Tyr154, in addition to the hydrophobic staple interaction with Ile149, forms very favorable contacts with amino acid residues Leu21, Asp24, and Gln25all belonging to an important structural element (the α1-helix) which contributes to the active site. Moreover, the hydrogen bond as well as the hydrophobic interactions made by Tyr154 with Asp24 and Leu21, respectively, are conserved in class Pi GSTs. It is interesting to note that these polar and apolar interdomain interactions seem to be specific for Pi class GSTs, since they are maintained in the bovine, murine, porcine, and rat GSTP1-1 but not in GST structures from other classes (not shown). To determine the role of the hydrophobic staple motif in the folding process, site-directed mutagenesis was used to produce the two single mutations I149A and Y154A as well as the double mutation I149A/Y154A. However, considering that an alanine residue still potentially can form, during the folding process, a weak hydrophobic staple and a glycine cannot, the I149G variant and the corresponding I149G/Y154F and I149G/Y154A double mutants were also generated. Furthermore, in order to distinguish the contribution of the hydrophobic staple versus the other contributions of Tyr154 with the α1-helix, the variants Y154F and L21A were also analyzed. These two mutants make it possible to separate the contribution of the hydrogen bonds (Y154F mutant) from the hydrophobic interaction (L21A variant) made by Tyr154 with domain I. The mutants and the wild-type GSTP1–1 were expressed in E. coli and purified in a single chromatographic step using a GSH affinity matrix. No more than 2–3% of the total enzymatic activity remained unbound for any of the different GST variants. Apparently, the mutations do not affect the affinity for GSH-Sepharose. The purified proteins were homogeneous as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electophoresis (results not shown). The possibility that the mutations could have resulted in temperature-sensitive species was investigated by expressing the proteins at different growth temperatures of the host cells. As shown in Table I the intracellular yields of wild-type GSTP1-1 and mutants Y154A and I149A, expressed in bacteria grown at 25 °C, were essentially the same. With increasing temperature, the yields of these mutants slightly decreased, unlike the yield of the wild-type, L21A, Y154F, and I149G variants, which remained unchanged. A much lower intracellular yield, strongly dependent on the temperature of host cell growth, was found for the I149A/Y154A, I149G/Y154F, and I149G/Y154A double mutants. At 37 °C the protein expression levels of all double mutants were more than 15 times lower than those of the wild-type and single-point mutants. These results probably have the explanation that the double mutants fail to attain the native conformation at physiological temperatures. The activity in the crude bacterial lysate of all double mutants (not shown) and the specific activity of the purified I149A/Y154A and I149G/Y154A variants (Table I) were markedly lower when the growth temperature of the host cell was 37 °C.Table IEffects of bacterial host cell growth temperature on the specific activity and intracellular protein yield of heterologously expressed wild-type GSTP1–1 and hydrophobic staple motif mutants25 °C37 °CProtein yield25 °C37 °Cunits/mg%Wild-type33 ± 534 ± 56.07.5I149A34 ± 545 ± 78.25.9Y154A38 ± 641 ± 65.22.9I149A/Y154A52 ± 713 ± 20.80.1L21A40 ± 650 ± 76.417.4Y154F52 ± 727 ± 44.322.3I149G43 ± 656 ± 84.18.7I149G/Y154F53 ± 862 ± 93.30.5I149G/Y154A42 ± 623 ± 30.20.1Units/mg is the specific activity of the purified enzyme expressed at 25 or 37 °C.

Open table in a new tab Units/mg is the specific activity of the purified enzyme expressed at 25 or 37 °C. Protein yield represents the fraction of GST recovered after affinity chromatography given as percentage of total cytosolic proteins. The level of protein expression of some mutants was more or less dependent on the growth temperature of the bacterial host cells. Moreover, some mutants displayed a lower specific activity when expressed at 37 °C. Thus, kinetic and structural characterizations were performed using enzymes expressed at the more permissive temperature of 25 °C. Table II summarizes the kinetic parameters for the conjugation of CDNB with GSH catalyzed by wild-type GSTP1-1 and mutant variants. The k cat, KmGSH, andk cat/K m values of all mutants, although to various extents, were all higher than those of the wild-type enzyme. In particular, mutants I149A/Y154A, L21A, and I149G/Y154A displayed k cat values about 2-fold higher as compared with the parent enzyme. The K mvalues for CDNB were also higher than that of the wild-type enzyme for the Y154A, I149A/Y154A, L21A, and I149G/Y154A mutants.Table IIKinetic parameters of wild-type and hydrophobic staple motif mutants of GSTP1–1 heterologously expressed at 25 °C in E. colik catCDNBK mGSHK mk cat/K ms −1mms −1 mm −1Wild-type34 ± 20.15 ± 0.020.94 ± 0.1036I149A42 ± 40.16 ± 0.020.87 ± 0.1048Y154A45 ± 40.26 ± 0.041.18 ± 0.1838I149A/Y154A85 ± 60.17 ± 0.041.16 ± 0.1773L21A74 ± 50.60 ± 0.091.94 ± 0.1938Y154F57 ± 40.29 ± 0.030.90 ± 0.0963I149G63 ± 50.20 ± 0.010.97 ± 0.163I149G/Y154F49 ± 40.41 ± 0.020.64 ± 0.0677I149G/Y154A76 ± 50.26 ± 0.011.25 ± 0.1161 Open table in a new tab Expression at 25 °C yielded wild-type and mutant proteins with very similar structural properties. The similar far-UV CD spectra of all variants as well as the same gel filtration retention times (not shown) indicate that the secondary structure content and the dimeric arrangement of the proteins are essentially unaffected by the mutations. Fig. 2 shows the intrinsic fluorescence spectra of the proteins. The λmax values were the same, indicating that a similar polarity characterizes the environment of the tryptophan residues of all enzyme variants. However, the normalized intensities of fluorescence of most mutants were lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. This finding suggests that significant conformational changes distinguish the final structure of the mutants from that of the parent enzyme. These differences imply shorter distances between some fluorescence quenching groups and one or both tryptophanyl residues located in the GST domain I, far from the mutation site. The thermal stability of wild-type and hydrophobic staple motif mutant proteins, heterologously expressed at 25 °C, was investigated. Residual activity was monitored after 10 min of exposure to different temperatures. As shown in Fig. 3,A and B, all mutants were destabilized compared with the wild-type GSTP1-1. The I149A (Fig. 3 A) mutant was completely inactivated at 50 °C, whereas the wild-type enzyme, under the same conditions, was inactivated to less than 10%. Furthermore, mutants Y154A and I149A/Y154A were significantly more unstable than both wild-type GSTP1-1 and the I149A mutant, being almost completely inactivated by incubation at 40 °C for 10 min. For the Y154A and the I149A/Y154A mutants about 60% of the activity remained after the same time at 37 °C. The fact that the thermal inactivation curves for the single Y154A and the double I149A/Y154A mutants were essentially the same suggests that interactions made by the Tyr154 residue with other regions of the molecule play a major role in the global stability of the protein. At 40 °C, the L21A and Y154F mutants were 40 and 10% inactivated, respectively, suggesting that the hydrophobic interaction made by Tyr154 with the α1-helix is essential for enzyme stability (Fig. 3 B). The results also show that about 40% of the activity of mutant I149G is lost when this variant is incubated at 40 °C. Moreover, the I149G/Y154A variant, being inactivated to 70% at 37 °C (Fig. 3 B), is more unstable than the I149A/Y154A double mutant (Fig. 3 A). Thus, an Ala to Gly substitution at position 149 in GSTP1-1 clearly affects the overall stability of the enzyme. The proposed role of the hydrophobic staple motif involves determination of the direction of the polypeptide chain during folding. One consequence of substituting residues that contribute to this motif could be the generation of temperature-sensitive folding mutants. To test this possibility, reactivation yields of GSTP1-1 and its mutants at different temperatures were determined. Fig.4 shows that when the reactivation was performed at 25 °C the double mutant I149A/Y154A possessed a higher specific activity (35 units/mg) than that observed for the wild-t"

Entamoeba histolytica is a human intestinal parasite that causes amoebiasis. Its trophozoites contain high amounts of inositol polyphosphates (8.Martin J.-B. Bakker-Grunwald T. Klein G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). myo-Inositol is the major cyclitol building natural inositol polyphosphates, and other isomers are only rarely found and in very low concentrations. Consequently, the two major inositol phosphates of E. histolytica have been preliminarily identified as myo-inositol 2,4,6-triphosphate and 5-PP-myo-InsP5 (8.Martin J.-B. Bakker-Grunwald T. Klein G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, we subsequently noticed during comparative studies by high resolution anion exchange chromatography that the inositol polyphosphates from E. histolytica were not eluted exactly with the same retention time as the myo-inositols used as reference. This casted some doubt on the previous identification. Therefore, we have reinvestigated the structures of the inositol phosphates present in E. histolytica by two-dimensional 31P-1H NMR analysis after HPLC purification, and we show in the present study thatE. histolytica possesses high levels of severalneo-inositol polyphosphates.

Acquisition time was 2 s, and 32 scans were accumulated. The spectral width was set to 4032 Hz at a 8192 data size, which yields a digital resolution of 0.50 Hz/point. The1H H2O signal was suppressed by a selective 2-s presaturation pulse. 1H chemical shifts are given relative to external tetramethylsilane at 0 ppm. For 31P-decoupled spectra, a WALTZ-16 sequence is used. Other NMR spectra were recorded in a 10-mm X-(1H) probehead. 1H-decoupled 13C spectra were recorded with an excitation pulse of 60°. The spectral width was set to 25 kHz at a 32,768 data size, which yields a digital resolution of 0.76 Hz/point. Spectra were WALTZ-16 proton-decoupled with two levels of decoupling: 1.5 W for 0.65 s (acquisition time) and 0.5 W for 0.35 s (relaxation delay). Free induction decays (68,400 scans forneo-InsP6 and 25,200 scans for 2-PP-neo-InsP5) were processed with 1.5 Hz exponential line broadening. 13C chemical shifts are referenced to δ of external tetramethylsilane at 0 ppm. One-dimensional 31P spectra were recorded with an excitation pulse of 45°. The spectral width was set to 5880 Hz at a 16,384 data size, which yields a digital resolution of 0.35 Hz/point. For WALTZ-16 1H decoupling, two levels of decoupling were used: 2.5 W during the acquisition time (1.4 s) and 0.5 W during the relaxation delay (0.6 s). Free induction decays were processed with 1 Hz exponential line broadening. 31P chemical shifts are referenced to δ of external phosphoric acid at 0 ppm. Two-dimensional 31P-1H heteronuclear shift correlation spectroscopy correlation spectra were recorded with the following pulse sequence (16.Bax A. Morris G.A. J. Magn. Res. 1981; 42: 501-505Google Scholar): RD-90°(1H)-1/2t1-180°(31P)-1/2t1-Δ1-90°(1H)90°(31P)-Δ2-acquisition (31P) with polarization transfer from 1H to31P via JPOCH. The time intervals Δ1 and Δ2 were set to 56 and 37 ms, respectively. The π/2 pulse lengths were 23 μs (31P) and 24 μs (1H). Acquired spectra were WALTZ-161H-decoupled, and 31P acquisition time was 0.4 s with 0.6 s recycling delay. Spectral width was 2604 Hz in the F2 domain (2048 points) and 400 Hz in the F1 domain (32 points). Two-dimensional contour plot was calculated by Fourier transformation after zero filling to a 2048 × 128 data matrix and applying a sine-bell function in the F1 dimension and a Gaussian multiplication in the F2 dimension. The one-dimensional 1H and31P NMR spectra were the projections of the F1 and F2 dimensions. Two-dimensional 31P-1H TOCSY-DEPT correlation spectra were acquired with the following pulse sequence (17.Kessler H. Gemmecker G. Köck M. Osowski R. Schmieder P. Magn. Res.

The time interval Δ was set to 56 ms. The TOCSY mixing time consisted of a 104-ms MLEV-17 sequence. The Θ pulse of the DEPT transfer was 45°. Acquired spectra were WALTZ-16 proton-decoupled, and 31P acquisition time was 0.4 s with 0.6 recycling time. Specific conditions are detailed in the legends of Figs. 3 and 6.Figure 6Two-dimensional31P-1H TOCSY-DEPT spectrum of 2,5-bis-PP-neo-InsP4.HPLC-purified compound III was adjusted to pH 6.0. Acquisition conditions are detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” Spectral width was 2604 Hz in the F2 domain (2048 points) and 400 Hz in the F1 domain (64 points), and the number of scans for an increment was 1152. The two-dimensional contour plot was calculated by Fourier transformation after zero filling to a 2048 × 128 data matrix and applying an exponential multiplication in F1 and F2 dimensions.

Bakker-Grunwald T. Klein G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The standard compounds used for the comparative HPLC analysis of highly phosphorylated inositols were either isolated from D. discoideum(6-PP-myo-InsP5,myo-InsP6, myo-Ins (1,2,3,4,6)P5, myo-Ins (1,2,3,4,5)P5, and myo-Ins (1,2,4,5,6)P5) or obtained from Sigma (myo-Ins (1,3,4,5,6)P5). The analysis by HPLC-MDD of a perchloric extract from E. histolytica trophozoites showed three prominent peaks corresponding to two major compounds I and II and a minor compound III, with retention times corresponding to highly phosphorylated inositol phosphates (Fig.1, trace A). Although the retention time of compound I was close to that of the variousmyo-inositol pentakisphosphates, it did not coincide with any of them. Compound II eluted with the same retention time asmyo-InsP6, and compound III eluted slightly later than 6-PP-myo-InsP5 purified from D. discoideum (Fig. 1, trace B). This result suggested that the inositol phosphates present in E. histolytica might be different from the highly phosphorylated inositol phosphates presently known in D. discoideum. The intracellular amounts of the E. histolytica compounds I, II, and III were determined by 31P NMR to be about 0.11, 0.18, and 0.04 μmol/g wet cells, respectively. For further characterization, a perchloric acid extract was prepared from 18 g (wet weight) cells, and compounds I, II, and III were purified on an HPLC anion exchange column, with a 42–68% yield. The 6-PP-InsP5 5-kinase extracted from D. discoideumspecifically phosphorylates position 5 of 6-PP-myo-InsP5 leading to 5,6-bis-PP-myo-InsP4 (4.Laussmann T. Hansen A. Reddy K.M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Vogel G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This enzyme also phosphorylates more slowly position 5 ofmyo-InsP6 to form 5-PP-myo-InsP5. 2T. Laussmann and G. Vogel, unpublished results.Compound II, although co-eluting from the HPLC column withmyo-InsP6, was not phosphorylated by this enzyme (Fig. 2, trace A), whereas added myo-InsP6 was completely converted into 5-PP-myo-InsP5 (Fig. 2, trace B). Similarly, compound III, with an elution time from the HPLC column close to that of 6-PP-myo-InsP5, was not phosphorylated by the kinase (Fig. 2, trace C), whereas added 6-PP-myo-InsP5 was converted into 5,6-bis-PP-myo-InsP4 (Fig. 2, trace D). Compound I was no substrate for the kinase, either (data not shown). Taken together with the HPLC data, these results demonstrate that the highly phosphorylated inositol phosphates from E. histolytica were not identical to known myo-inositol phosphates. Compounds I, II, and III were further analyzed by NMR spectroscopy to solve their structures. The one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of compound I showed two resonance lines at about 4.4 and 4.9 ppm in an intensity ratio of 2:1, respectively. No other proton peak was detectable in this1H spectrum between 10 and 0 ppm, except for some residual water at 4.8 ppm (F1 dimension, Fig.3). Because the inositol ring has six −CH groups, this results indicates that compound I had just two groups of equivalent protons, one group consisting of four protons and the other group consisting of two protons. Similarly, in a 31P NMR spectrum, compound I gave also two resonance lines at 0.8 and 0.6 ppm with the same intensity ratio of 2:1 or 4:2 (F2dimension, Fig. 3), suggesting an inositol molecule with either three or six phosphorus atoms. Only a 3-phosphate molecule is compatible with the symmetry of the myo-inositol ring. Assuming thatmyo-inositol phosphates were indeed present in E. histolytica, compound I was previously identified asmyo-Ins (2,4,6)P3 (8.Martin J.-B. Bakker-Grunwald T. Klein G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The above data on its elution position from the HPLC column, the kinase assays, and the equivalence of the protons of the molecule suggested that this identification of compound I was wrong and that E. histolytica possessed an inositol isomer other thanmyo-inositol. To determine the structure of compound I, we recorded a two-dimensional31P-1H relayed, correlative NMR spectrum on the HPLC-purified compound I. The phosphate atoms at 0.8 ppm were correlated with the four protons at 4.42 ppm, whereas the phosphate atoms at 0.6 ppm were correlated with the two protons at 4.90 ppm. Relayed cross-peaks were also detected between the four phosphate atoms and the protons at 4.90 ppm and between the two phosphate atoms at 0.6 ppm and the protons at 4.42 ppm. Because all protons of the inositol ring are correlated with phosphates (F1 dimension, Fig. 3), the six hydroxyl groups must be phosphorylated. The peculiar31P and 1H NMR spectra of compound I with only two resonance groups in the ratio 4:2 were also found with13C NMR, with two lines (both of them broadened because of the multiple 13C-31P coupling constants) at 72.8 ppm (intensity 2) and 75.3 ppm (intensity 1) (data not shown). This unique order of symmetry is only compatible, among the nine isomeric inositols, with compound I beingneo-InsP6. Chemical shifts and coupling constants are summarized in Table I. Both equatorial protons H2 and H5 had a δ of 4.90 ppm and a JPOCH coupling constant of 10.4 Hz. The four axial protons H1, H3, H4, and H6 resonated at 4.42 ppm, and their JPOCHcoupling constant was 6.8 Hz.Table INMR chemicals shifts (δ) and coupling constants (J) of neo-inositol phosphatesCompoundδPJPOPJPOCHP1P2P3P4P5P6βP2βP5P1-H1P2-H2P3-H3P4-H4P5-H5P6-H6ppmHzHzneo-InsP60.80.60.80.80.60.8NANANA6.810.46.86.810.46.82-PP-neo-InsP5aδP1,3 and δP4,6 can be inversed.0.72−11.300.720.850.550.85−9.60NA16.27.110.77.18.110.08.12,5-bis-PP-neo-InsP40.8−11.350.80.8−11.350.8−9.65−9.6517.08.210.18.28.210.18.2CompoundδHδCH1H2H3H4H5H6C1C2C3C4C5C6ppmppmneo-Inositolb13C NMR data was from Ref. 38, and 1H NMR data was from Ref. 39.3.653.943.653.653.943.6570.372.670.370.372.670.3neo-InsP64.424.904.424.424.904.4272.875.372.872.875.372.82-PP-neo-InsP5cδC1,3 and δC4,6 can be inversed; δC2 and δC5 can be inversed.4.445.004.444.444.934.4472.776.072.772.575.272.52,5-bis-PP-neo-InsP44.455.004.454.455.004.45NDNDNDNDNDNDAll spectra were recorded at pH 6.0.

NA, not applicable; ND, not determined. Compound II co-eluted from the HPLC column with myo-InsP6, after compound I identified just above as neo-InsP6 (Fig. 3). Because the negative kinase assays eliminated the possibility of compound II being myo-InsP6 (Fig. 2), we had a closer look at the structure of this component as well. Compound II had a 31P-decoupled 1H NMR spectrum with three singlets at 5.00, 4.93, and 4.44 ppm in the ratio 1:1:4 (Fig.4 A). All protons were coupled to a phosphorus atom with JPOCH coupling constants around 10–11 Hz for the two downfield protons and 7–8 Hz for the four upfield protons (Fig. 4 B and Table I). Again, these values of chemical shifts and JPOCH coupling constants are an indication for the presence of the two equatorial and four axial protons characteristic of the neo-inositol isomer. The1H-decoupled 31P NMR spectrum of compound II exhibited three singlets at 0.85, 0.72, and 0.55 ppm and two doublets at −9.60 and −11.30 ppm in the ratio 2:2:1:1:1 (Fig. 4 Cand Table I), suggesting a molecule with seven phosphate atoms among which is a diphosphate group responsible for the peak splitting in the two upfield doublets (JPOP = 16.2 Hz). Its1H-coupled 31P NMR spectrum showed a splitting of each line into two, except for the doublet corresponding to the βP of the diphosphate group (Fig. 4 D). This is an indication that each of the phosphate groups, except the βP, is coupled with one proton only. The HPLC elution order, the symmetry of the protons, the number of phosphate atoms, and the two doublets at −9.60 and −11.30 ppm were suggestive of PP-neo-InsP5. The α-phosphate of the diphosphate group was correlated to an equatorial proton of the neo-inositol, which can be in position 2 or 5 (Fig. 5). Because these two positions are equivalent because of the symmetry of the molecule, compound II was named 2-PP-neo-InsP5, according to the “lowest locant rule” of the IUPAC-IUB (18.IUPAC Commission on the Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry and IUPAC-IUB Commission on Biochemical NomenclatureEur.

This would be compatible with a total of either four or eight phosphate groups. The fact that compound III was eluted from the HPLC column after compound II identified above as a 2-PP-neo-InsP5 indicates that it must contain eight phosphate groups, a number that can only be reached if two diphosphate groups are present in the molecule. In a31P-1H correlation map, the singlet and the doublet corresponding to the α-phosphate of the diphosphate groups are correlated to two groups of protons at 4.4 and 5.0 ppm in the ratio 2:1 (4:2). No other protons were detectable in a one-dimensional1H NMR spectrum between 10 and 0 ppm, except for the signal of residual water at 4.8 ppm (F1 dimension, Fig. 6). These results are an indication that the two positions carrying equatorial protons (positions 2 and 5) were bearing the diphosphate groups. Compound III was thus identified as 2,5-bis-PP-neo-InsP4. P. balamuthi is a free living amoeba that lacks mitochondria (20.Chavez L.A. Balamuth W. Gong T. J. Protozool. 1986; 33: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 21.Cavalier-Smith T. BioSystems. 1991; 25: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). It also contains unusual diphospho-inositol polyphosphates in large quantities (9.Martin J.-B. Bakker-Grunwald T. Klein G. J. Euk. Microbiol. 1995; 42: 183-191Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar). An HPLC-MDD analysis of the three inositol-containing compounds present in P. balamuthi indicated that they exactly co-eluted withneo-InsP6, 2-PP-neo-InsP5, and 2,5-bis-PP-neo-InsP4 purified from E. histolytica (data not shown). We conclude from this that P. balamuthi probably contains the same set ofneo-inositol metabolites. Our data show that E. histolytica trophozoites contain phosphate and diphosphate esters of neo-inositol:neo-InsP6, 2-PP-neo-InsP5, and 2,5-bis-PP-neo-InsP4 at cytosolic concentrations of 0.22, 0.36, and 0.08 mm, respectively. So far, the most abundant inositol isomer encountered in nature has beenmyo-inositol, whereas neo-inositol is only a relatively rare isomer. Neo-InsP6 has first been recognized as a soil constituent (22.Cosgrove D.J. Tate M.E. Nature. 1963; 200: 568-569Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Mixtures of myo-,scyllo-, chiro-, and neo-inositol are indeed present in soil as their pentakisphosphate and hexakisphosphate esters (23.Irving G.C.J. Cosgrove D.J. Commun. Soil Sci. Plant Anal. 1982; 13: 957-967Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). l-neo-Inositol 1-phosphate has been found in the brain, heart, testis, and spleen of rat in micromolar concentrations (24.Sherman W.R. Goodwin S.L. Gunnell K.D. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3491-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated neo-inositol has been identified besides polyphosphates on the cell surface of the freshwater carnivorous Amoeba discoides (25.Laird M.H. Allen H.J. Danielli J.F. Winzler R.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1976; 175: 384-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). In vitro experiments show that E. histolyticatrophozoites are sensitive to micromolar concentrations of exogenously added myo-inositol phosphates. E. histolyticapossesses specific and separate binding sites for myo-Ins (1,4,5)P3 and myo-Ins (1,3,4,5)P4, and independent calcium stores are releasable by each of thesemyo-inositol phosphates (26.Raha S. Giri B. Bhattacharyya B. Biswas B.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 362: 316-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 27.Giri B. Raha S. Bhattacharyya B. Biswas S. Biswas B.B. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The presence of high concentrations (∼100–400 μm) ofneo-inositol polyphosphate derivatives suggests thatneo-inositol metabolism may be regulated independently frommyo-inositol in this amoeba. Comparable cases are found in nature where the myo-isomer does not represent the major inositol in terms of concentration. High concentrations ofscyllo-inositol have been found in human brain, breast tumors, and the skate Raja erinacea (28.Sherman W.R. Simpson P.C. Goodwin S.L. Comp. Biochem. Physiol.

Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 161-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Two biosynthesis pathways by which neo-inositol might be formed have been proposed: 1) the cyclization of mannose 6-phosphate into neo-inositol 1-phosphate by l-myo-inositol 1-phosphate (d-myo-inositol 3-phosphate) synthase, the same enzyme that cyclizes glucose 6-phosphate into myo-inositol 1-phosphate (24.Sherman W.R. Goodwin S.L. Gunnell K.D. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 3491-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and 2) the epimerization of myo-inositol into neo-inositol at C-5 by a dehydrogenation to the 5-keto compound (myo-inosose-5) followed by reduction of the carbonyl group (33.Candy D.J. Biochem. J. 1967; 103: 666-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Both processes have been proven to proceed in bovine brain (24.Sherman W.R. Goodwin S.L. Gunnell K.D.

Commun. 1977; 77: 340-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In support of the first pathway, a gene encodingl-myo-inositol 1-phosphate synthase fromE. histolytica has been cloned, and the native enzyme from trophozoites has been purified and characterized (35.Lohia A. Hait N.C. Majumder A.L. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 98: 67-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Among theneo-inositol phosphates found in E. histolytica, two bear diphosphate groups. Diphospho-myo-inositol phosphates have been found recently in Dictyostelids and a number of mammalian cell types (4.Laussmann T. Hansen A. Reddy K.M. Reddy K.K. Falck J.R. Vogel G.

The wide phylogenetic spectrum of distribution of these diphosphate cyclitols is taken as an indication for a fundamental physiological function. Diphosphoinositol phosphates have been suggested to be a new form of phosphate donor (2.Stephens L. Radenberg T. Thiel U. Vogel G. Koo K.H. Dell A. Jackson T.R. Hawkins P.T. Mayr G.W. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 17826-17832Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A high turnover rate of diphospho-myo-inositol phosphates has been revealed, because treatment with fluoride, which inhibits the bisphosphatase involved in their breakdown, elevated their levels up to 10-fold at the expense of myo-inositol pentakisphosphate and myo-InsP6 (7.Glennon M.C. Shears S.B. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 10.Menniti F.S. Miller R.N. Putney Jr., J.W. Shears S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3850-3856Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, treatment of E. histolytica with 10 mmNaF, although drastically reducing the levels of nucleotide diphophates and triphosphates, had no significant effect on the levels ofneo-InsP6, 2-PP-neo-InsP5, and 2,5-bis-PP-neo-InsP4 (data not shown). This suggests that the diphospho-neo-inositols are stable end products that are not involved in serving as energy stores or in regulating vesicle traffic. Whatever their function, it is clear that the neo-inositol phosphates found in E. histolytica and strongly suspected to be present in P. balamuthi represent yet another class of inositol metabolites and that nature exploits the full versatility of the inositol moiety.

https://openalex.org/W2110902739,"A gene encoding a novel type of receptor protein-tyrosine kinase was identified in Hydra vulgaris. The extracellular portion of this receptor (which we have namedSweet Tooth) contains four C-type lectin-like domains (CTLDs). Comparison of the sequences of these domains with the sequences of the carbohydrate recognition domains of various vertebrate C-type lectins shows that Sweet Tooth CTLD1 and CTLD4 have amino acids in common with those shown to be involved in carbohydrate binding by the lectins. Comparison of sequences encoding CTLD1 from theSweet Tooth genes from different species ofHydra shows variation in some of the conserved residues that participate in carbohydrate binding in C-type lectins. TheSweet Tooth gene is expressed widely in theHydra polyp, and expression is particularly high in the endoderm of the tentacles. Treatment of polyps with peptides corresponding to sequences in the Sweet Tooth CTLDs results in the disintegration of the animal. These same peptides do not block adhesion or morphogenesis of Hydra cell aggregates. A gene encoding a novel type of receptor protein-tyrosine kinase was identified in Hydra vulgaris.

Comparison of the sequences of these domains with the sequences of the carbohydrate recognition domains of various vertebrate C-type lectins shows that Sweet Tooth CTLD1 and CTLD4 have amino acids in common with those shown to be involved in carbohydrate binding by the lectins. Comparison of sequences encoding CTLD1 from theSweet Tooth genes from different species ofHydra shows variation in some of the conserved residues that participate in carbohydrate binding in C-type lectins. TheSweet Tooth gene is expressed widely in theHydra polyp, and expression is particularly high in the endoderm of the tentacles. Treatment of polyps with peptides corresponding to sequences in the Sweet Tooth CTLDs results in the disintegration of the animal. These same peptides do not block adhesion or morphogenesis of Hydra cell aggregates. receptor protein-tyrosine kinase C-type lectin-like domain carbohydrate recognition domain trifluoroacetic acid high-pressure liquid chromatography mannose-binding protein A Receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (RTKs)1 are used to transduce the signals required for a variety of developmental and physiological processes in multicellular animals (1.van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). No RTKs have been identified in unicellular organisms, and the yeast genome lacks sequences encoding protein-tyrosine kinases (2.Hunter T. Plowman G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 18-22Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). It is likely, therefore, that the evolution of RTKs was a critical event in the formation of multicellular animals. Because the bulk of characterized RTKs are from a small number of triploblastic animal species, we have a relatively restricted view of the evolutionary history of these molecules. It is by no means clear that the classes of RTKs identified to date in higher animals contain examples of all of the types of RTKs that multicellular cellular animals have evolved. Sponges and cnidarians contain RTKs, indicating that such receptors existed in the common ancestor of all extant metazoans. A homologue of the vertebrate insulin receptor is present in the cnidarian Hydra vulgaris (3.Steele R.E. Lieu P. Mai N.H. Shenk M.A. Sarras Jr., M.P. Dev. Genes Evol. 1996; 206: 247-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and a gene encoding an RTK containing Ig-like domains in its extracellular portion has been identified in a sponge (4.Schacke H. Rinkevich B. Gamulin V. Müller I.M. Müller W.E. J. Mol. Recognit. 1994; 7: 273-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 5.Schacke H. Schroder H.C. Gamulin V. Rinkevich B. Müller I.M. Müller W.E. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1994; 11: 101-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These findings establish the continuity of two types of RTKs from the earliest stages of metazoan evolution through to vertebrates.We know even less about the evolution of ligands for RTKs than we know about the evolution of the receptors. Only a small number of RTK ligands from invertebrate phyla have been characterized. All of the RTK ligands that have been identified to date in both invertebrates and vertebrates are proteins, although in some cases RTKs have been shown to interact in a homophilic manner (6.Pulido D. Campuzano S. Koda T. Modolell J. Barbacid M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 391-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and thus appear to lack a separate ligand molecule. Notably lacking are examples of carbohydrates as RTK ligands. Given the diversity of carbohydrates displayed on the surfaces of animal cells, it is perhaps surprising that carbohydrates appear not to have been exploited as ligands for RTK-mediated signaling pathways. In searching for RTKs that play roles in developmental processes in Hydra, we have identified a gene (Sweet Tooth) encoding a novel RTK with an extracellular portion that contains four C-type lectin-like domains (CTLDs). If the CTLDs ofSweet Tooth bind carbohydrate, this receptor would be the first example of an RTK that is activated by carbohydrate ligands. Potential processes in which such a receptor could be involved include cell adhesion, morphogenesis, and recognition of foreign cells. Peptide blocking experiments with Hydra polyps suggest thatSweet Tooth is not required for cell adhesion or morphogenesis. The possibility that Sweet Tooth acts as a pattern recognition receptor for foreign cells and thus may be a component of an immune system in Hydra cannot be ruled out.DISCUSSIONAs a result of the identification of RTK genes in the earliest diverging animal phyla, we now know that the ancestor of all modern metazoans contained signaling pathways activated by RTKs, but that such receptors are likely absent from both plants and unicellular animals. Studies with various model animal systems have revealed that RTKs play critical roles in developmental processes and in the regulation of cell division and physiology. The known RTK ligands are polypeptides, which are either released into the intercellular mileu or anchored to the surface of the cell. No RTKs have been identified that recognize carbohydrates, despite the diversity of carbohydrate molecules displayed on cell surfaces. Our identification of an RTK inHydra that contains CTLDs in its extracellular region demonstrates that an RTK that potentially recognizes carbohydrates has appeared in at least one animal phylum. Cnidaria, the phylum of whichHydra is a member, diverged very early in the metazoan radiation. Thus RTKs containing CTLDs were potentially present in the last common ancestor of cnidarians and the rest of metazoans. If an RTK with CTLDs was present in this ancestor and conserved during subsequent stages of metazoan evolution, we would expect to find its progeny in most modern animals. So far this has not been the case. Although C-type lectins have been identified in a number of metazoan phyla, none has been found to be an RTK. In C. elegans, the one case in which we have a complete inventory of RTKs for an animal, no gene encoding an RTK with CTLDs is present (21.Ruvkun G. Hobert O. Science. 1998; 282: 2033-2041Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). However, C. elegans lacks several protein-tyrosine kinase genes that are present in Hydra and vertebrates (30.Steele R.E. Stover N.A. Sakaguchi M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 239: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), indicating that some genes have been lost in the lineage leading to C. elegans. Although C. elegans lacks RTKs with CTLDs, a data base search reveals that the nematode genome contains a number of genes encoding proteins with CTLDs. Before the cloning of the Sweet Tooth gene, no CTLD-containing protein had been identified in a diploblastic organism. Thus our data demonstrate that the CTLD arose before the divergence of triploblasts and diploblasts. Until more animal phyla are examined, we cannot say whether the linkage of CTLDs to an RTK occurred only in the phylum Cnidaria or whether it will turn out to be of more widespread occurrence.A key piece of information necessary to understand the role ofSweet Tooth in Hydra is the nature of the ligand(s) that it recognizes. Although we currently lack this information, the extracellular portion of Sweet Tooth has the potential for a variety of interactions. Each CTLD is potentially capable of binding to a distinct ligand. In addition, the A and B repeats may also recognize ligands. Thus Sweet Tooth is potentially capable of recognizing a number of different molecules. At least two of the CTLDs (CTLDs 1 and 4) of Sweet Tooth have features that suggest that they could bind carbohydrates. However, the presence of a CTLD is not, in and of itself, sufficient to allow one to conclude that the CTLD will bind carbohydrate. For example, CTLD-containing proteins serve as antifreeze proteins in the circulatory systems of some fish (31.Loewen M.C. Gronwald W. Sonnichsen F.D. Sykes B.D. Davies P.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17745-17753Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 32.Gronwald W. Loewen M.C. Lix B. Daugulis A.J. Sonnichsen F.D. Davies P.L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4712-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). One of the families of receptors on natural killer lymphocytes contains CTLDs, but it appears that at least some of these domains recognize protein ligands rather than carbohydrate ligands (33.Braud V.M. Allan D.S. O'Callaghan C.A. Soderstrom K. D'Andrea A. Ogg G.S. Lazetic S. Young N.T. Bell J.I. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. McMichael A.J. Nature. 1998; 391: 795-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (1716) Google Scholar, 34.Boyington J.C. Riaz A.N. Patamawenu A. Coligan J.E. Brooks A.G. Sun P.D. Immunity. 1999; 10: 75-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, in the cases of CTLDs that do not bind carbohydrates, the CTLD sequences are less conserved than is the case for the Sweet Tooth CTLDs. For example, the CTLDs of natural killer cell receptors lack calcium binding site 2 (35.Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Although we have not yet identified ligands for Sweet Tooth, we have demonstrated that its kinase domain is catalytically active. Thus it is very likely that Sweet Tooth responds to ligand binding by activating one or more signal transduction pathways in the manner of other RTKs.Given the possibility that Sweet Tooth is a receptor that is activated by binding to one or more carbohydrate ligands, what roles might it play in Hydra? Because of the simplicity of both the composition and organization of Hydra, the number of possible roles for Sweet Tooth is relatively limited. Two possibilities seem likely. First, Sweet Tooth may serve as an adhesion molecule, with adhesion being achieved by binding of the CTLDs to carbohydrates and/or proteins on adjacent cells. C-type lectins are known to act as adhesion molecules. The selectins mediate the binding of leukocytes to endothelial cells (36.Bevilacqua M.P. Nelson R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Lecticans, proteoglycans that contain a C-type lectin domain and bind sulfated glycolipids (37.Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar), appear to play a role in cell adhesion in the nervous system (38.Miura R. Aspberg A. Ethell I.M. Hagihara K. Schnaar R.L. Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11431-11438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Our attempts to block adhesion of Hydra cells with synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences in the Sweet Tooth CTLDs were unsuccessful. This result suggests thatSweet Tooth may not be involved in adherence ofHydra cells to each other. Alternatively, adhesion could be mediated by several different molecules, with any one molecule being dispensible. A example of such redundancy among adhesion molecules is seen in Drosophila, in which loss of function of fasciclin I, a neural cell adhesion molecule, has no effect on development of the nervous system (39.Elkins T. Zinn K. McAllister L. Hoffmann F.M. Goodman C.S. Cell. 1990; 60: 565-575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar).In addition to testing for a role in adhesion, we also tested whether the Sweet Tooth peptides could block regeneration of the head, a process that requires adhesion as well as other morphogenetic processes. The high level of Sweet Tooth gene expression in the tentacles and during tentacle formation suggests the possibility that it might be involved in morphogenetic processes associated with tentacle formation. In Hydra, tissue displacement occurs continuously in the adult (40.Campbell R.D. J. Cell Sci. 1973; 13: 651-661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Campbell R.D. J. Morphol. 1967; 121: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Cells from the body column are continuously moving into the tentacles. Thus the morphological changes associated with the conversion of body column tissue into tentacle tissue occur continuously. In addition to cell shape changes, this conversion almost certainly involves changes in cell adhesion.Sweet Tooth is thus a reasonable candidate for mediating such changes. To test this possibility, we carried out peptide treatment on animals that were regenerating heads. The peptides had no effect on the rate or course of regeneration. It has been demonstrated that head regeneration can be perturbed by treatment with both peptides and proteolytic fragments from extracellular matrix molecules (10.Sarras Jr., M.P. Yan L. Grens A. Zhang X. Agbas A. Huff J.K. St. John P.L. Abrahamson D.R. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 312-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 42.Zhang X. Hudson B.G. Sarras Jr., M.P. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 10-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), indicating that application of peptides to regenerating animals is an appropriate method for testing whether a protein has a role in morphogenesis.A third potential role for Sweet Tooth is in the recognition of foreign cells. Hydra has been shown to carry out xenorecognition. In heterografts of H. oligactis andH. vulgaris the cells of each species phagocytose the cells of the other species, with the ultimate outcome, over a period of several weeks, being the removal of all of the H. vulgariscells from the grafted animal (43.Bosch T.C.G. David C.N. J. Exp. Zool. 1986; 238: 225-234Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). C-type lectins have been shown to be used extensively for immune responses in both vertebrates and invertebrates (35.Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 44.Vasta G.R. Ahmed H. Quesenberry M.S. Söderhäll K. Iwanaga S. Vasta G.R. New Directions in Invertebrate Immunology. SOS Publications, Fair Haven, NJ1996: 189-227Google Scholar). Thus a lectin RTK is an attractive candidate for mediating xenorecognition in Hydra. We could envision, for example, that failure of Sweet Tooth to detect a species-specific carbohydrate on a cell with which it comes in contact could result in the registering of that cell as foreign and subsequent action against that cell. It is thus intriguing that treatment ofHydra with Sweet Tooth peptides results in the disintegration of the animal and that CTLD1 from H. vulgarisand H. oligactis shows sequence differences that suggest that they might recognize different carbohydrates. Receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (RTKs)1 are used to transduce the signals required for a variety of developmental and physiological processes in multicellular animals (1.van der Geer P. Hunter T. Lindberg R.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 251-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar).

At least two of the CTLDs (CTLDs 1 and 4) of Sweet Tooth have features that suggest that they could bind carbohydrates. However, the presence of a CTLD is not, in and of itself, sufficient to allow one to conclude that the CTLD will bind carbohydrate. For example, CTLD-containing proteins serve as antifreeze proteins in the circulatory systems of some fish (31.Loewen M.C. Gronwald W. Sonnichsen F.D. Sykes B.D. Davies P.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17745-17753Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 32.Gronwald W. Loewen M.C. Lix B. Daugulis A.J. Sonnichsen F.D. Davies P.L. Sykes B.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 4712-4721Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). One of the families of receptors on natural killer lymphocytes contains CTLDs, but it appears that at least some of these domains recognize protein ligands rather than carbohydrate ligands (33.Braud V.M. Allan D.S. O'Callaghan C.A. Soderstrom K. D'Andrea A. Ogg G.S. Lazetic S. Young N.T. Bell J.I. Phillips J.H. Lanier L.L. McMichael A.J.

Immunity. 1999; 10: 75-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, in the cases of CTLDs that do not bind carbohydrates, the CTLD sequences are less conserved than is the case for the Sweet Tooth CTLDs. For example, the CTLDs of natural killer cell receptors lack calcium binding site 2 (35.Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar). Although we have not yet identified ligands for Sweet Tooth, we have demonstrated that its kinase domain is catalytically active. Thus it is very likely that Sweet Tooth responds to ligand binding by activating one or more signal transduction pathways in the manner of other RTKs. Given the possibility that Sweet Tooth is a receptor that is activated by binding to one or more carbohydrate ligands, what roles might it play in Hydra? Because of the simplicity of both the composition and organization of Hydra, the number of possible roles for Sweet Tooth is relatively limited. Two possibilities seem likely. First, Sweet Tooth may serve as an adhesion molecule, with adhesion being achieved by binding of the CTLDs to carbohydrates and/or proteins on adjacent cells. C-type lectins are known to act as adhesion molecules. The selectins mediate the binding of leukocytes to endothelial cells (36.Bevilacqua M.P. Nelson R.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 91: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar). Lecticans, proteoglycans that contain a C-type lectin domain and bind sulfated glycolipids (37.Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar), appear to play a role in cell adhesion in the nervous system (38.Miura R. Aspberg A. Ethell I.M. Hagihara K. Schnaar R.L. Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11431-11438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Our attempts to block adhesion of Hydra cells with synthetic peptides corresponding to sequences in the Sweet Tooth CTLDs were unsuccessful. This result suggests thatSweet Tooth may not be involved in adherence ofHydra cells to each other. Alternatively, adhesion could be mediated by several different molecules, with any one molecule being dispensible. A example of such redundancy among adhesion molecules is seen in Drosophila, in which loss of function of fasciclin I, a neural cell adhesion molecule, has no effect on development of the nervous system (39.Elkins T. Zinn K. McAllister L. Hoffmann F.M. Goodman C.S. Cell. 1990; 60: 565-575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). In addition to testing for a role in adhesion, we also tested whether the Sweet Tooth peptides could block regeneration of the head, a process that requires adhesion as well as other morphogenetic processes. The high level of Sweet Tooth gene expression in the tentacles and during tentacle formation suggests the possibility that it might be involved in morphogenetic processes associated with tentacle formation. In Hydra, tissue displacement occurs continuously in the adult (40.Campbell R.D. J. Cell Sci. 1973; 13: 651-661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Campbell R.D. J. Morphol. 1967; 121: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Cells from the body column are continuously moving into the tentacles. Thus the morphological changes associated with the conversion of body column tissue into tentacle tissue occur continuously. In addition to cell shape changes, this conversion almost certainly involves changes in cell adhesion.Sweet Tooth is thus a reasonable candidate for mediating such changes. To test this possibility, we carried out peptide treatment on animals that were regenerating heads. The peptides had no effect on the rate or course of regeneration. It has been demonstrated that head regeneration can be perturbed by treatment with both peptides and proteolytic fragments from extracellular matrix molecules (10.Sarras Jr., M.P. Yan L. Grens A. Zhang X. Agbas A. Huff J.K. St. John P.L. Abrahamson D.R. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 312-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 42.Zhang X. Hudson B.G. Sarras Jr., M.P. Dev. Biol. 1994; 164: 10-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), indicating that application of peptides to regenerating animals is an appropriate method for testing whether a protein has a role in morphogenesis. A third potential role for Sweet Tooth is in the recognition of foreign cells. Hydra has been shown to carry out xenorecognition. In heterografts of H. oligactis andH. vulgaris the cells of each species phagocytose the cells of the other species, with the ultimate outcome, over a period of several weeks, being the removal of all of the H. vulgariscells from the grafted animal (43.Bosch T.C.G. David C.N. J. Exp. Zool. 1986; 238: 225-234Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). C-type lectins have been shown to be used extensively for immune responses in both vertebrates and invertebrates (35.Weis W.I. Taylor M.E. Drickamer K. Immunol. Rev. 1998; 163: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (873) Google Scholar, 44.Vasta G.R. Ahmed H. Quesenberry M.S. Söderhäll K. Iwanaga S. Vasta G.R. New Directions in Invertebrate Immunology. SOS Publications, Fair Haven, NJ1996: 189-227Google Scholar). Thus a lectin RTK is an attractive candidate for mediating xenorecognition in Hydra. We could envision, for example, that failure of Sweet Tooth to detect a species-specific carbohydrate on a cell with which it comes in contact could result in the registering of that cell as foreign and subsequent action against that cell. It is thus intriguing that treatment ofHydra with Sweet Tooth peptides results in the disintegration of the animal and that CTLD1 from H. vulgarisand H. oligactis shows sequence differences that suggest that they might recognize different carbohydrates.

The primary site of action, at least with respect to appetite, is the hypothalamus. Leptin also has significant effects on the function(s) of peripheral organs involved in maintaining body composition. Some of these effects are mediated through direct interaction of leptin with its receptor on the target tissue, and some effects are indirectly mediated through secondary hormonal and neural pathways. Few of the genes that are responsible for regulating body composition and the peripheral effects of leptin are known. We have used a new gene profiling technology to characterize gene expression changes that occur in the pituitary, hypothalamus, fat, muscle, and liver in response to both obesity and treatment with exogenous leptin. These differences were then overlaid to allow the identification of genes that are regulated by obesity and at least partially normalized by leptin treatment. By using this process we have identified five genes (POMC, PC2, prolactin, HSGP25L2G, and one novel) that are both abnormally expressed in the pituitaries of obese mice and are sensitive to the effects of leptin. We also show that adrenocorticotropic hormone appears to be involved in a regulatory loop involving leptin.

Nature. 1994; 372: 425-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (11807) Google Scholar) leading to hyperphagia and massive obesity demonstrates that leptin plays a central role in the regulation of food intake and body composition. Leptin actions include direct effects on central mediators of appetite control. Thus, acute ventricular administration of leptin activates the STAT1signaling pathway within relevant areas of the hypothalamus, induces expression of anorexigenic hormones, and suppresses food intake (for reviews on the central effects of leptin see Refs. 3.Elmquist J.K. Maratos-Flier E. Saper C.B. Flier J.S. Nat. Neurosci. 1998; 1: 445-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar and 4.Kalra S.P. Dube M.G. Pu S. Xu B. Horvath T.L. Kalra P.S. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 68-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). In addition to direct central effects, leptin has peripheral effects that appear to be independent of the reduction in food intake. One of the first indications of this came from the observation that weight loss in leptin-treated obese rodents was in excess of that seen in mice that ate the same amount of an identical diet as the leptin-treated group (5.Levin N. Nelson C. Gurney A. Vandlen R. de Sauvage F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1726-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The peripheral effects of leptin appear to include both indirect effects mediated through hypothalamic changes and direct actions on the target tissues. In addition to the widely appreciated metabolic effects of leptin, this hormone also appears to impact fertility, angiogenesis, and the immune response. For recent reviews on the peripheral effects of leptin see Refs. 6.Cawthorne M.A. Morton N.M. Pallett A.L. Liu Y.L. Emilsson V. Proc. Nutr.

Sci. 1998; 76: 1405-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar. The pituitary is clearly implicated in regulating whole body metabolism. Hypopituitary adults and children have decreased lean body mass and an increase in total body fat (8.Beshyah S.A. Freemantle C. Thomas E. Rutherford O. Page B. Murphy M. Johnston D.G. Clin. Endocrinol. 1995; 42: 179-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 9.Sartorio A. Narici M. Conti A. Giambona S. Ortolani S. Faglia G. J. Endocrinol. Invest. 1997; 20: 417-423Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although at least some of this effect of the pituitary appears to be the result of growth hormone deficiency, it may be that other pituitary-derived or -influenced hormones are relevant. For example, adrenalectomy in mice leads to resistance to the development of obesity (10.Saito M. Bray G.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1984; 246: R20-R25Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and patients with Cushing's disease have an increased body mass index (11.Rebuffe-Scrive M. Krotkiewski M. Elfverson J. Bjorntorp P. J. Clin. Endocrinol. & Metab. 1988; 67: 1122-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 12.Peeke P.M. Chrousos G.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1995; 771: 665-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). These data suggest that pituitary-derived factors such as ACTH could also be relevant to the increase in body mass index seen in hypopituitary patients. Prolactin has also been implicated in maintaining body composition (13.AvRuskin T.W. Pillai S. Kasi K. Juan C. Kleinberg D.L. J. Pediatr. 1985; 106: 373-378Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although there are several compelling candidates for pituitary-derived factors that could impact body composition, it may be that not all of these have been identified. Gene expression changes have been used widely in the last decade to identify genes that may be relevant to physiological processes. These have included differential display (14.Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar), representational difference analysis (15.Lisitsyn N. Lisitsyn N. Wigler M. Science. 1993; 259: 946-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (1168) Google Scholar), serial analysis of gene expression (16.Velculescu V.E. Zhang L. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Science. 1995; 270: 484-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (3613) Google Scholar), and more recently array-based technologies (17.Schena M. Shalon D. Davis R.W. Brown P.O. Science. 1995; 270: 467-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (7671) Google Scholar); for a recent review of these approaches see Carullie et al. (18.Carulli J.P. Artinger M. Swain P.M. Root C.D. Chee L. Tulig C. Guerin J. Osborne M. Stein G. Lian J. Lomedico P.T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 30/31 (suppl.): 286-296Crossref Google Scholar). All of these have proved useful but have limitations in terms of the ability to detect reproducibly small differences between samples, the number of different mRNA species that can be sampled, and the ability to make multiple independent comparisons. We report here on the use of quantitative expression analysis (QEA®) (19.Shimkets R.A. Lowe D.G. Tai J.T.-N. Sehl P. Jin H. Yang R. Prediki P.F. Rothberg B.E.G. Murtha M.T. Roth M.E. Shenoy S.G. Windemuth A. Simpson J.W. Simons J.F. Daley M.P. Gold S.A. McKenna M.P. Hillan K. Went G.T. Rothberg J.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 798-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) to identify genes that may be of relevance to obesity and the mechanisms by which leptin regulates body composition. QEA relies on digestion of the cDNA genome into multiple fragments with pairs of restriction enzymes prior to a minimal number of amplification cycles and computer-assisted mass comparisons on high resolution sequencing acrylamide gels. This process allows an analysis with high sensitivity and analytical depth. Furthermore as the data are captured, analyzed, and stored electronically, multiple independent comparisons can be made. We have used this technology to examine gene expression changes that are relevant to obesity in five different organs (pituitary, hypothalamus, liver, muscle, and fat). Specifically we have quantitated transcripts that are expressed in these tissues and are differentially expressed in a comparison between lean and obese mice. A further set of transcripts was identified as being differentially expressed in a comparison between mice (lean and obese) treated with leptin or vehicle. We have also identified transcripts that are common to these comparisons. We have further characterized a set of pituitary-expressed genes that are altered by obesity and are also at least partially normalized by leptin treatment. Mice (C57Bl/6 obese (ob/ob) and lean (ob/+, +/+ littermates; 8 weeks of age; females) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory. They were acclimated for 10 days prior to the beginning of the experiment. The mice were maintained on a 12-h (6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.) dark:light cycle, and food and water were provided ad libitum. Each mouse was weighed and dosed at 1 mg/kg with a leptin-IgG fusion protein that has been previously described (5.Levin N. Nelson C. Gurney A. Vandlen R. de Sauvage F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1726-1730Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). The mice were injected daily, and weights and food intake were measured. Weight gain over the 7 days was as follows: obese/PBS, 2.7 ± 0.3 g; obese/leptin, −3.5 +/0.2 g; lean/PBS 0.6 ± 0.1 g; lean/leptin, −0.4 ± 0.1 g. Food intake (per mouse over 7 days) was as follows: obese/PBS, 35 ± 0.8 g; obese/leptin, 20 ± 0.5 g; lean/PBS 23 ± 0.8 g; lean/leptin, 18.5 ± 0.5 g. After seven daily injections the mice were sacrificed, and muscle (gastrocnemius), liver, fat (pooled peri-renal and ovarian), pituitaries, and hypothalami were removed and snap-frozen on dry ice. RNA was extracted from the tissues as described below. A total of 240 mice (120 obese and 120 lean) in four groups were used. For each tissue three pools were prepared with each pool containing tissue from between 5 (liver) and 20 (pituitary and hypothalamus) mice. RNA was prepared from each pool of tissue and analyzed as described below. GeneCallingTM reactions were performed essentially as described (19.Shimkets R.A. Lowe D.G. Tai J.T.-N. Sehl P. Jin H. Yang R. Prediki P.F. Rothberg B.E.G. Murtha M.T. Roth M.E. Shenoy S.G. Windemuth A. Simpson J.W. Simons J.F. Daley M.P. Gold S.A. McKenna M.P. Hillan K. Went G.T. Rothberg J.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 798-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). In brief, total cellular RNA was isolated with Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.), and poly(A)+ RNA was prepared from 50 μg of total RNA using oligo(dT) magnetic beads (PerSeptive Diagnostics, Cambridge, MA), and first strand cDNA was prepared from 1.0 μg of poly(A)+ using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Subsequent to cDNA fragmentation, tagging and amplification samples were loaded onto 5% polyacrylamide, 6m urea, 0.5× TBE ultrathin gels and electrophoresed on a Niagara instrument. PCR products are visualized by virtue of the fluorescent label at the 5′ end of one of the PCR primers. The output of the electrophoresis instruments is processed using the Java-based, internet-ready, Open Genome Initiative (OGI®) software suite. Data, corresponding to FAM-labeled single-stranded DNA that is both sized and with 5′ and 3′ ends defined by the restriction pairs used to digest the cDNA, are submitted as point-by-point length versus amplitude addresses to an Oracle 8 data base. For each cDNA pool generated, from each of three tissue samples, three independent GeneCalling reactions were performed. Composite traces representing each sample for the OGI-generated trace data from the GeneCalling reactions were compared pairwise (i.e. ob/ob pituitary ± leptin) using software designed to detect the difference over certain threshold limits. Data base queries were performed using the information inherent to the sized fragments with ends defined by restriction digest fragmentation. Restriction fragments that map in end sequence and length to known mouse genes were used as templates for the design of unlabeled oligonucleotide primers. An unlabeled oligonucleotide designed against one end of the restriction fragment was added in excess to the original reaction and is re-amplified by PCR. This new reaction with the competing PCR primer was then electrophoresed and compared with a control reaction reamplified without the unlabeled oligonucleotide to evaluate the selective diminution of the peak of interest (19.Shimkets R.A. Lowe D.G. Tai J.T.-N. Sehl P. Jin H. Yang R. Prediki P.F. Rothberg B.E.G. Murtha M.T. Roth M.E. Shenoy S.G. Windemuth A. Simpson J.W. Simons J.F. Daley M.P. Gold S.A. McKenna M.P. Hillan K. Went G.T.

J. Biol. Chem. 1964; 239: 375-380Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fat pads were minced in Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer (pH 7.4, containing 200 nm adenosine, 5 mm glucose, 3% fraction V bovine serum albumin, 135 mm NaCl, 2.2 mm CaCl2, 1.25 mm MgSO4, 0.45 mmKH2PO4, 2.17 mmNa2HPO4, and 10 mm HEPES). Adipose tissue fragments were digested in the same buffer in the presence of type I collagenase (1 mg/ml; Worthington) at 37 °C with gentle shaking (100 rpm) for 30 min. Isolated adipocytes were separated from undigested tissue by filtration through a 250 μm polypropylene mesh and washed three times. For washing, cells were centrifuged at 500 rpm for 3 min. Each time the infranatant was discarded, and cells were resuspended in Krebs-Ringer HEPES buffer with the final wash being in 5.5 mm glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, with 5% bovine serum albumin, 20 mm HEPES, 1 unit/ml adenosine deaminase, and 10 pm(−)-N 6-(2-phenylisopropyladenosine). Adipocytes were cultured in 48-well plates, 5 × 105 cells per 500 μl per well. Cells were treated in quadruplicate with rat ACTH (100, 10, 1, and 0.1 nm; Sigma) or rat prolactin (100, 10, 1, and 0.1 nm; Accurate Chemical). Recombinant human insulin (1, 0.1 and 0.01 nm; Genentech) and isoproterenol (30, 10, 3 and 1 nm; Sigma) were added to separate wells as positive controls. Cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2. 50 μl was sampled at 4 h and again at 16 h. Media glucose were measured by a hexokinase colorimetric assay (Sigma); media glycerol were measured by a glycerol kinase/oxidase colorimetric assay (Sigma), and media leptin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Crystal Chem). RNA was prepared from the adipocytes using commercially available material and protocols (RNA-STAT; Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). Pituitary cell cultures were prepared from whole pituitaries of 8-week-old female C57Bl/6J mice. Pituitaries were finely minced and then digested by rapid agitation for 30 min at 37 °C in Hank's balanced salt solution containing 4 mg/ml collagenase (type 2, CLS 2, Worthington) and 400 μg/ml DNase. Digested pituitaries were washed twice in low glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and then plated 300,000 cells per well in laminin-coated 6-well plates. Cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 overnight before being treated with leptin. Murine leptin (Biomol) was added in quadruplicate (100, 10, and 1 nm). RNA was prepared from the pituitary using commercially available material and protocols (RNA- STAT). Total RNA from liver, pituitary, and muscle from lean C57BL/6 mice was prepared using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.), separated on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane. The filter was hybridized with a32P-labeled 36-base nucleotide probe corresponding to bases 551–586 of the i0 m0-307 sequence. The filter was washed at 0.1% SSC at 42 °C and exposed to film for 18 h. Gene expression profiling is becoming an increasingly important technique in biology, but currently used approaches are limited with respect to sensitivity, depth of analysis, or an inability to perform nested or multiple comparisons (for a recent review see Carulli et al. (18.Carulli J.P. Artinger M. Swain P.M. Root C.D. Chee L. Tulig C. Guerin J. Osborne M. Stein G. Lian J. Lomedico P.T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 30/31 (suppl.): 286-296Crossref Google Scholar)). At least some of these techniques have been utilized to approach questions relevant to diabetes (23.Arava Y. Adamsky K. Ezerzer C. Ablamunits V.

However, this binary comparison does not address whether these changes are causal components of the development of obesity in these mice or are correlates of increased adiposity. In this report we describe the use of a novel gene profiling technology that allows an analysis at high sensitivity and increased depth of analysis. We are also able to use the electronic data capture capabilities to search for differences that are common to different experimental manipulations. This ability to search for differences that are present in biologically independent comparisons increases our ability to focus on those gene expression changes that may be more relevant to the underlying biology. The effect of obesity and leptin administration on gene expression differences was examined using QEA. Five of the major tissues implicated in metabolic control (pituitary, hypothalamus, muscle, liver, and fat) were analyzed from each of four groups of female mice as follows: obese (ob/ob) treated with leptin; obese treated with vehicle (PBS); lean (ob/+ or +/+) treated with leptin, and lean treated with vehicle. For each tissue three pools were prepared with each pool containing tissue from between 5 (liver) and 20 (pituitary and hypothalamus) mice. RNA was prepared from each pool of tissue, and the cDNA derived from the RNA was analyzed using 96 pairs of restriction enzymes. Previous results indicate that this will allow the analysis of greater than 90% of the expressed genome with a sensitivity of detection greater than 1:100,000 (19.Shimkets R.A. Lowe D.G. Tai J.T.-N.

Three binary comparisons were initially made, obese versus lean mice (both vehicle-treated), lean mice, vehicle versusleptin-treated and obese mice leptin versus vehicle-treated. A difference was called if the peak heights differed by more than 2-fold (p < 0.05). The results of these comparisons are shown in Table II. As described under “Experimental Procedures” each gene fragment represents part of a gene and any one gene has the potential for generating multiple independent gene fragments; some genes will give rise to only one that is detectable, whereas others can give rise to 5–10. Results presented below, from Shimkets et al.(19.Shimkets R.A. Lowe D.G. Tai J.T.-N. Sehl P. Jin H. Yang R. Prediki P.F. Rothberg B.E.G. Murtha M.T. Roth M.E. Shenoy S.G. Windemuth A. Simpson J.W.

Levin, Q. Gu, R. A. Shimkets, D. A. Lewin, and T. A. Stewart, unpublished observations. indicate that there is an approximate three to one ratio between gene fragments and represented genes. That the differences in peak height reflect a difference in expression of the underlying mRNA has been previously validated (19.Shimkets R.A. Lowe D.G. Tai J.T.-N. Sehl P. Jin H. Yang R. Prediki P.F.

A secondary search was carried out to find those gene fragments that were altered by obesity and at least partially normalized by leptin. Note that for adipose tissue the number of approximately half the number of subsequence analyses was performed on the fat as compared with the other tissues leading to a proportional reduction in the number of gene fragments detected. Open table in a new tab The indicated comparisons were made for each of the tissues, and the numbers of gene fragments that are different (at least 2-fold;p < 0.05) in peak height between the two sets of cDNAs are reported. A secondary search was carried out to find those gene fragments that were altered by obesity and at least partially normalized by leptin. Note that for adipose tissue the number of approximately half the number of subsequence analyses was performed on the fat as compared with the other tissues leading to a proportional reduction in the number of gene fragments detected. RNA from each of the five tissues was analyzed by QEA, and the number of detectable gene fragments was determined (Table II). As described above, each gene fragment represents part of a particular cDNA, and so the number of gene fragments can be used as a measure of the number of genes expressed within the tissue. There is a large difference in the number of gene fragments detected in the fat as compared with the other tissue due to approximately half the number of QEA reactions having been performed for adipose compared with the other tissues. Given this, it is reasonable to expect a comparable number of gene fragments, and a corresponding increase in the number of differentially expressed bands to be observed for adipose in this experiment. By comparing peak heights for each gene fragment, it is also apparent that there are large differences in the number of genes that are responding to either obesity or leptin in the different tissues. Thus the liver is very sensitive to obesity with 587 gene fragments (2.3% of the total) changing more than 2-fold relative to the expression in lean liver. In contrast only 82 (0.3%) differences were detected in the hypothalamus. The other tissues are intermediate between these two, with 117 (0.5%) gene fragments changing in the pituitary, 158 (0.6%) in muscle, and 196 (1.6%) in fat. It should be noted that these assessments are drawn from the expression of the total tissue. As the liver is more homogenous than the hypothalamus in terms of cell type, the numbers of gene expression differences in the hypothalamus could be an underestimate. Fat and liver were the most responsive tissues to leptin treatment with approximately 0.6 and 0.4% of the genes changing more than 2-fold in response to a 1-week treatment. As described below this analysis does not address whether these are direct effects of leptin on the fat or liver as compared with leptin altering liver gene expression indirectly via, for example, alterations in proteins being delivered by the pituitary. There are more differences detected in response to leptin in the obese mice as compared with lean mice. This is comparable to what is seen with respect to the physiological responses (food intake and fat loss) in the same sets of mice (see “Experimental Procedures”). Our primary goal for this experiment was the identification of those genes that are relevant to the development of obesity. The simple two-way comparisons described above will identify not only these more relevant genes but also those that are altered as a compensatory response to obesity and those that are altered by leptin but may be related to the reproductive effects of leptin (28.Clarke I.J. Henry B.A. Rev. Reprod. 1999; 4: 48-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Thus we further analyzed the gene expression changes by searching for those genes for which expression was altered by obesity, and at the same time expression was returned toward the lean pattern of expression by a 1-week course of treatment with leptin. Only the obese mice treated with leptin were used for this comparison as they are more sensitive to the effect of leptin. Between 6 and 12% of the gene fragments that differ between obese and lean mice are at least partially normalized by leptin treatment (TableII). Because of uncertainties relating to cellular heterogeneity and the relationship between gene fragment number and gene number, it is unclear if the differences between the tissues are significant. The converse of this analysis indicates that approximately 90% of the obesity-related differences are not significantly normalized by a 1-week course of treatment with leptin and points to the dangers inherent in a simple binary comparison for the detection of leptin-responsive genes. Possible reasons for the failure of 90% of the differences to normalize would include the length of treatment and irreversible alterations established by 8 weeks of leptin deficiency. In this study we have further analyzed the gene expression differences detected in the pituitary. Subsequent experiments and reports will describe findings in the other tissues. Gene profiling allowed the identification of 117 gene fragments that were differentially expressed in the pituitaries of lean in comparison to obese mice. The minimum expression difference is 2-fold; the maximal differences cannot be accurately estimated owing to the low level of expression of some genes. Based on the ratio of gene fragments identified to genes represented (Table III and data not shown), it is estimated that the 117 gene fragments represent approximately 40 different genes. A comparable assessment indicates that we could detect the expression of approximately seven pituitary-expressed genes that are regulated by leptin (in obese mice). Fourteen of the 117 gene fragments altered by obesity were at least partially normalized by leptin. These 14 ge"

It exists as a highly phosphorylated protein with a pI of 3 in the dentin matrix and, in that state, might have an important role in the mineralization process. The spatio-temporal distribution during development indicates that the expression of this gene is tightly regulated in the odontoblasts. It is now known that DMP1 is not unique to dentin but is present in other mineralized tissues like long bone, calvaria, and ameloblasts. To study the transcriptional regulation and the function of DMP1 in these tissues, a genomic clone with a functional promoter, introns, and exons was isolated. Sequence analysis showed that the ratDMP1 gene is comprised of six exons and five introns and spans ∼13 kilobases (kb). Exon 1 contains the 5′-untranslated sequences. Exon 2 encodes a total of 18 amino acids including the 16 amino acids of the signal sequence. Exons 3–5 encode 16, 11, and 15 amino acids, respectively. Exon 6 contains 1.3 kb of the coding sequence with the RGD domain, stop codon, and the 3′-untranslated region (1.1 kb). We have mapped two transcription start sites within the DMP1 promoter that are 280 and 321 base pairs, respectively, from the ATG start codon. The location of functional elements within the 5′-upstream DMP1 DNA fragment was determined by cloning it into a luciferase reporter gene. Transient transfection and luciferase assays revealed that the 3 kb fragment has the ability to drive the luciferase gene. However, this promoter activity was restricted to MC3T3-E1 cells (an osteoblast cell lineage). The promoter was silent in Chinese hamster ovary cells (an epithelial cell lineage), indicating the necessity of tissue-specific factors to drive the transcription.

One type of cells resulting from this process is the odontoblasts, which are the principle cells that synthesize the dentin matrix. Mature odontoblasts are responsible not only for the secretion of the collagen-rich extracellular matrix but also for the secretion of noncollagenous proteins that are responsible for initiating the mineralization cascade. In dentinogenesis, a number of highly controlled extracellular and intracellular events are responsible for the formation of the well-defined mineralized tissue. The noncollagenous proteins produced by the single layer of odontoblasts may control these events (4.Butler W.T. Eur. J.

One of the noncollagenous proteins is dentin matrix protein 1 (DMP1)1 (7.George A. Sabsay B. Simonian P.A.L. Veis A. J. Biol.

Based on our initial data, DMP1 was thought to be dentin-specific, but later, its expression was seen in calvaria and long bone (9.George A. Gui J. Jenkins N.A. Gilbert D.J. Copeland N.G. Veis A. J.

DMP1 is an acidic protein, rich in aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and serine residues. Fifty-two percent of these serines can be phosphorylated by casein kinase I- and II-like kinases. Upon phosphorylation, DMP1 could be involved in the mineralization process along with other noncollagenous phosphorylated proteins. DMP1 also has a RGD site in its cDNA (7.George A. Sabsay B. Simonian P.A.L. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-12630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have recently reported that the RGD sequence in DMP1 functions as a cell attachment domain (12.Kulkarni, G. V., Chen, B., Malone, J. P., Narayanan, A. S., and George, A. (1999) Arch. Oral Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). Little is known about the mechanism regulating the ontogeny and restricted tissue-specific expression of DMP1 gene. The cDNA sequence for DMP1 has been determined in various species, implicating the evolutionary pathway of the DMP1 gene. Cloning of DMP1 in these species has revealed the conservation of the acidic residues and serines that are strategically positioned for phosphorylation (13.Toyosawa S. O'hUigin C. Klein J. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 160-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 14.Toyosawa S. O'hUigin C. Tichy H. Klein J.

Genomics. 1997; 15: 38-45Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To understand the tissue-specific mechanisms behind the DMP1transcription, we have attempted to characterize the promoter of theDMP1 gene. The regulatory factors that are necessary for the transcriptional control of the DMP1 gene may play a role in their tissue specificity. These factors may be cis-acting, such as promoters and enhancers, or trans-acting, such as various DNA binding factors. The differentiation of odontoblasts and secretion of the dentin matrix involve specific genes being expressed at the right time in a temporo-spatial manner (16.Bleicher F. Couble M.L. Farges J.C. Couble P. Magloire H. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To date, very little is known about the recognition elements and the DNA-binding proteins that regulate the transcription of this gene. To characterize the DMP1 gene and study the mechanisms of tissue-specific regulation, we have isolated a genomic clone containing all the introns as well as a ∼3-kb segment of the 5′-flanking region that includes a functional promoter. DMP1 promoter deletion constructs were also made, and their consequential effects on the expression of a reporter gene (luciferase) were analyzed. To address the question of tissue specificity, we have studied the promoter activity profile in transiently transfected MC3T3-E1, a murine calvaria-derived osteoblast cell line, and in an epithelial cell lineage, CHO. Our ultimate goal is to identify specific transcription factors within the odontoblasts/osteoblasts that are responsible for driving the expression of DMP1. Rat tail genomic DNA was isolated by following the procedure of Sambrook et al. (17.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). DNA (20 μg) was digested with different restriction enzymes, and the digested DNA fragments were separated on a 0.8% agarose gel and processed for Southern hybridization as described previously (18.George A. Srinivasan R. Thotakura S.R. Liu K. Veis A. Connect. Tissue Res. 1999; 40: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Full-length ratDMP1 cDNA was used as a probe. Rat DMP1promoter was isolated by using the Rat Genomewalker kit fromCLONTECH. PCR reactions were carried with a gene-specific primer and an adapter primer. Gene-specific primer was made complementary to nucleotides 51–75, upstream of the translation codon ATG (5′-TGGGTCAAAAGCTCCGTCAGGTTC-3′) of the DMP1cDNA. The PCR amplicons were cloned in to TA vector and sequenced by automated sequencing. More gene-specific primers were made, and PCR was carried until 3 kb of 5′-flanking sequences were obtained. A PCR reaction was also carried with the rat genomic DNA in the 3′ direction with primers (forward and reverse) at nucleotides 361–378 (5′-TCGGCAGACACCACACAG-3′ and 5′-CATGAGGTAACACTTCAATGGCA-3′) to check whether there were any introns downstream of the nucleotide at position 378. PCR amplicons were cloned into TA vector and sequenced by automated sequencing. A synthetic oligonucleotide of 21-mer (5′-GTCAGGTTCTCCCAGAGG-3′) with a sequence complementary to nucleotides 83–64 (upstream of the ATG start codon) of the DMP1 published cDNA (7.George A. Sabsay B. Simonian P.A.L. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-12630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was used for primer extension analysis to determine the transcriptional start site. Total RNA was isolated from MC3T3-E1 cells (which express DMP1) by using the Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Yeast tRNA was used as a negative control. Primer extension was carried according to Sambrook et al. (17.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Briefly, a γ-32P-end-labeled primer was annealed to 20 μg of total RNA at 55 °C for 18 h. The primer-RNA complex was precipitated and resuspended with diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Extension of the annealed primer was carried out using Superscript II (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 42 °C for 90 min. The cDNA was precipitated in the presence of sodium acetate and analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide/urea gel with a sequencing reaction as a ladder. The gel was dried onto a Whatman 3MM paper and exposed to Kodak x-ray film. A ∼3-kb fragment encompassing the upstream sequences of DMP1 was subcloned into a promoterless luciferase pGL3 luciferase basic vector (Promega). The pGL3-basic vector lacks eukaryotic promoter and enhancer sequences, and expression of luciferase activity in cells transfected with this plasmid depends solely on the putative regulatoryDMP1 sequences that were inserted upstream to the luciferase gene. Systematic nested deletions were made by PCR amplification using the primers listed in Table I. The PCR products were initially cloned into a TA vector (Invitrogen) and further subcloned into pGL3-basic vector (Promega).Table IList of primers used in experimentsName of the primerSequenceST1−2344GTTCCTGGGCTTGGA−2330ST2−1902GCATCTAGGGG−1891ST3−1408CGCAGTCAAACC−1397ST4−773CAAGCATCCTTACCC−759ST5−211CGCCTGGAAATAAGC−196ST0/BglIItctaga+228TCAAAAGCTCCG+217CP5′−288GAGATGAAATTCAAGGCC−271CP3′+38CAGAAGTGGGCCTTCTCT+21ST2-REV−1891CCCCATAGATGC−1902ST3-REV−1397AGGTTTGACTGCG−1408ST1 to ST5 primers were used in combination with ST0/BglIIfor the PCR-mediated deletions within the DMP1 promoter. ABg1II site was incorporated into theST0/BglII primer for easy cloning. CP5′ and CP3′ primers were used for the amplification of the core promoter. ST2-Rev and ST3-Rev were used in the amplification of enhancer fragments in combination with either ST1 or ST2, and denoted as K1, K2, and K3. Open table in a new tab ST1 to ST5 primers were used in combination with ST0/BglIIfor the PCR-mediated deletions within the DMP1 promoter. ABg1II site was incorporated into theST0/BglII primer for easy cloning. CP5′ and CP3′ primers were used for the amplification of the core promoter. ST2-Rev and ST3-Rev were used in the amplification of enhancer fragments in combination with either ST1 or ST2, and denoted as K1, K2, and K3. For the enhancer experiments, the PCR-amplified DNA fragments were cloned into TA vector as mentioned above and further subcloned into pGL3-promoter (SV40 promoter). PGL3-promoter vector has a SV40 promoter to drive the luciferase gene. When compared with the control, any effect on the luciferase activity will be due to the DNA fragment cloned upstream to the SV40 promoter. All the constructs were verified for orientation by partial sequencing or enzymatic digestion. CHO cells, an epithelial cell line, and MCT3T3 cells (mouse calvarial 3T3-like cells), an osteoblast cell line, were grown in F-12 and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, respectively (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For transcriptional analysis, the various chimeric constructs were transfected into subconfluent cells (60–70% confluence) using the Superfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer. The DNA-Superfectamine mixture was added to the cells, cells were incubated for 2 h, and the medium was replaced by regular medium. The cells were kept in culture for 24 h, and then the cells were lysed and clarified by centrifugation, and the luciferase assay was performed as described below. The amount of protein recovered after lysis was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The pRLSV-40 plasmid was co-transfected with all the transfections to normalize the variations in transfection efficiency. pRLSV-40 encodes Renilla luciferase, and its activity can be distinguished from that of the firefly luciferase encoded in pGL3 using the dual-luciferase assay system (Promega). All transfections were carried out in triplicates. Activities of the firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase in a single sample were measured using the dual-luciferase reporter assay (DLRTM) system (Promega) according to manufacturer's instructions. In short, 50 μg of protein was dispensed into a 96-well plate and placed in a luminometer equipped with two dispensers. The first dispenser added the firefly luciferase-activating reagent, Luciferase Assay Reagent II, and luminescence was recorded. The second dispenser then added the Renilla luciferase-activating reagent, Stop and Glo Reagent, which simultaneously quenched firefly luminescence and activated the Renilla luciferase. The light emission was recorded using a Dynex luminometer. Variations in transfection efficiency were normalized by dividing the measurement for the firefly luciferase activity by that for the Renilla luciferase activity. To determine the copy number for the ratDMP1 gene, Southern analysis of the rat genomic DNA was performed with various restriction enzymes, and a short cDNA probe was used. A single band was detected in each lane, indicating thatDMP1 is a single copy gene (data not shown). A promoter walking technique was used to isolate 3-kb 5′-upstream sequences. All the introns for DMP1were also isolated from the rat genomic DNA with the Genomewalker technique. The genomic structure for DMP1 consists of six exons and five introns (Fig. 1). The first exon is ∼95-bp long and encodes most of the 5′-untranslated region. The second exon codes 19 bp of the 5′-untranslated region, the signal peptide and the first two N-terminal amino acids of the secreted protein. The third, fourth, and fifth exons code for 16, 11, and 15 amino acids, respectively. The sixth and largest exon codes for the rest of the protein. The exon-intron boundaries were determined and belongs to the class 0 type. The sequences at the boundaries conformed closely to the classical GT/AG rule. There are five introns, and the sizes of the introns 1–5 are 3791, 465, 2047, 162, and 1375 bp, respectively. Primer extension analysis demonstrated that a major band was observed at 280 bp relative to the ATG initiation code; therefore, this would be the transcription initiation site, and it is denoted as +1 in Fig. 2. However, a minor extension product at 321 bp upstream of ATG is also observed (Fig.3).Figure 3Complete nucleotide sequence of the 5′-upstream region of the DMP1 gene showing the position of various transcription factor binding sites. The consensus sequences for the binding factors are shown initalics. An arrow (↓; stronger) and anasterisk (weaker) indicate the transcription start sites. The core promoter region identified was indicated between −288 (start) and +38 bp. The enhancer element identified was between −1902 and −1397 bp.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A 5′-upstream DNA fragment of ∼3 kb was isolated by promoter walk and cloned into the luciferase reporter vector to assay for transcriptional activity of this upstream fragment. Transient transfection assays reveal a severalfold increase in the luciferase activity compared with the pGL3-basic vector. Furthermore, in CHO cells, this construct failed in transcriptional activity (Fig. 4). Future reference of this 3-kb fragment will be as the DMP1 promoter. To determine whether the 5′-flanking region of the rat DMP1 region contains the regulatory elements utilized in a cell-type-specific manner, we made several chimeric DMP1-luciferase constructs. Serial deletions at the 5′-end were made in an attempt to identify various specific regions within the DMP1 promoter. Luciferase assays of these constructs (Fig. 5) revealed that an initial deletion of ∼500 bp (ST1) at the 5′-end of the DMP1 promoter increases its transcriptional activity to ∼11-fold when compared with the full-length DMP1 promoter (FL). Further deletion of another ∼500 bp (ST2) increases the transcriptional activity to ∼15-fold with respect to the full-length DMP1 promoter. With the deletion of ∼2 kb (ST4) at the 5′-end of the DMP1 promoter, a 2-fold transcriptional activity was still retained. Any further serial deletion (ST5) beyond this 2-kb region leads to the complete loss of promoter activity. Our initial serial deletions (a deletion of 500 bp at the 5′-end) revealed a sharp rise in the promoter activity. To identify the presence of any enhancer elements within this region, we have made PCR fragments between −2344 and −1902 bp (K1), −1902 and −1397 bp (K2), and −2344 bp and −1397 bp (K3). These DNA fragments were cloned into a pGL3-promoter vector (which had SV40 promoter). Any enhancer activity within these fragments will affect the luciferase activity through the SV40 promoter. Luciferase assay result of these constructs is shown in Fig.6. It is evident that the K1 construct has no enhancer activity, whereas K2 has increased luciferase activity (∼40-fold), indicating the presence of an enhancer element within this region. The K3 construct, on the other hand, has enhancer activity of about 20-fold with respect to the pGL3/SV40 transcriptional activity (Fig. 6). The enhancer activity of these fragments was restricted to MC3T3-E1 cells. Transfections in CHO cells did not have any significant enhancer activity. The minimal sequences within a promoter to drive the normal activity is called the core promoter. To identify the core promoter region, we have PCR-amplified a 300-bp fragment that spans +38 to −288 bp from the transcription start site. This fragment was cloned into the pGL3-basic vector to analyze its activity. Fig. 7 shows that the 300-bp fragment has complete promoter activity. In fact, this core promoter is almost 1-fold higher in activity than the full-length DMP1promoter. The core promoter identified was equally active in both MC3T3-E1 and CHO cell lines. DMP1, the first cloned dentin-related gene, has an overall composition between that of bone phosphoprotein and that of dentin phosphophoryn (7.George A. Sabsay B. Simonian P.A.L. Veis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12624-12630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of DMP1 was found to be completely restricted to polarized odontoblasts and differentiated osteoblasts. To study the mechanisms regulating cell type- and differentiation-specific expression of the DMP1 gene, we have isolated and characterized the DMP1 gene along with its exon-intron boundaries and the upstream promoter region. This is the first report describing the genomic sequence and organization of the rat DMP1 gene. DMP1 gene is a single copy gene comprised of six exons and five introns. The fifth exon is present in an isoform ofDMP1 as shown in Fig. 1 and was first reported by MacDougallet al. (8.MacDougall M. Gu T.T. Luan X. Simmons D. Chen J. J. Bone Mineral Res. 1998; 13: 422-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) in the mouse. This additional exon containing 15 amino acids was found to be spliced out from our original cDNA clone. The functional significance of this alternate splicing has not yet been determined. There are five introns of varying sizes, with the largest of them being the first intron. All of the introns are of the phase 0 type because they are flanked on either side by coding triplets. It is due to this type of arrangement that the presence of exon shuffling is noticed in one of the isoforms. The isolated rat DMP1 promoter is characterized by a TATA box and an inverted CCAAT box. In our experiments, we have shown that ratDMP1 is active in the correct orientation. An inverted CCAAT box is also seen in the promoter of bone sialoprotein and chicken osteopontin (19.Craig A.M. Denhardt D.T. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 100: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 20.Rafidi K. Simkina I. Johnson E. Moore M.A. Gerstenfeld L.C. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 140: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Analysis of the promoter sequences by the Matinspector program shows that DMP1 has binding sites for other transcription factors such as SP1, AP1, GATA, CREB, MSX 1, MYOD, AP4, c-MYC, ETS-1, and so forth and for serum-responsive elements such as ELK1, ISRE, and so forth. The most common binding sites are shown in Fig. 3. Primer extension studies using total RNA from the rat teeth/MC3T3-E1 cells have identified a major transcription start site at 280 bp upstream from the ATG site. An additional minor start site was also identified at 321 bp upstream of the ATG codon. The functional significance of the additional start site has yet to be analyzed. Similar patterns have been observed in other systems as well (20.Rafidi K. Simkina I. Johnson E. Moore M.A. Gerstenfeld L.C. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 140: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 21.Banine F. Gangneux C. Lebreton J.P. Frebourg T. Salier J.P. Biochim. Biophys.

To identify cell type-specific transcription of the DMP1gene, several deletions within the DMP1 promoter were made and analyzed for the ability to drive the luciferase gene. Luciferase assays demonstrated that the highest activity was found in the ST2 construct (with a deletion of 1 kb from the 5′-end of theDMP1 promoter). Construct ST4 (with a deletion of 2 kb from the 5′-end of the DMP1 promoter) showed a sharp drop in luciferase activity. However, the ST4 construct has a 1-fold higher activity than that of the full-length DMP1 promoter. Any further deletion of the ST4 construct showed a complete loss of promoter activity. In contrast, all the deletion constructs except ST4 showed no promoter activity in the CHO cell line. This indicates that the sequences upstream to ST4 in the DMP1 promoter construct probably contain tissue-specific elements that are necessary for the expression of DMP1 promoter in the cell lines tested. However, upon the deletion of these tissue-specific sequences, the ST4 construct was equally active in CHO cells. ST5 construct, on the other hand, failed to drive the luciferase gene in both MC3T3-E1 and CHO cell lines, possibly due to the loss of all transcription factor binding sites. Overall, these results suggest that there are tissue-specific regulatory elements within the 2 kb at the distal end of theDMP1 promoter. Furthermore, the above results also suggest that the 1-kb fragment at the 3′-end of the DMP1 promoter has the necessary sequences for a minimal promoter. Studies are being conducted to identify some of the tissue-specific factors that can control the DMP1 gene expression. The core/minimal promoter sequence resides between +38 and −288 bp with respect to transcription start site. The luciferase assay results show that this 300-bp fragment is sufficient to drive the reporter gene. This core promoter is equally active in CHO and MC3T3-E1 cells, indicating that the DMP1 promoter lost its tissue specificity. Data obtained from the serial deletions indicated the presence of an enhancer element within the DMP1 promoter. A 1-kb deletion at the 5′-end of the DMP1 promoter sharply increased its promoter activity by severalfold. This result prompted us to investigate the presence of any enhancer/repressor in and around this region. Luciferase assay showed the presence of an enhancer at −1902 to −1397 bp of the DMP1 promoter. Furthermore, transfection into CHO cells of the same constructs has no effect on the SV40 promoter activity. These results indicate that the enhancer is cell type-specific. In summary, our results have identified cell type-specific regions in the distal part of the DMP1 promoter. These findings will serve as a basis for future studies aimed at identifying the regulatory sequences and specific transcription factor(s) within odontoblasts or osteoblasts that are responsible for controlling the tissue-specific and developmental regulation of the DMP1 gene. We are also attempting to identify the tissue-specific enhancer binding factors responsible for the expression of DMP1 in mineralized matrix.

https://openalex.org/W1995930786,"TAFII250, a component of the general transcription factor, TFIID, is required for the transcription of a subset of genes, including those involved in regulating cell cycle progression. The tsBN462 cell line, with a temperature-sensitive mutation of TAFII250, grows normally at 32 °C, but when grown at 39.5 °C, it differentially arrests transcription of many, but not all, genes. The present studies examine the basis for the requirement for TAFII250. We show that the basal promoter of a major histocompatibility complex class I gene requires TAFII250. This dependence can be overcome by select upstream regulatory elements but not by basal promoter elements. Thus, the coactivator CIITA rescues the basal promoter from the requirement for TAFII250, whereas introduction of a canonical TATAA box does not. Similarly, the SV40 basal promoter is shown to require TAFII250, and the presence of the 72-base pair enhancer overcomes this requirement. Furthermore, the SV40 72-base pair enhancer when placed upstream of the basal class I promoter renders it independent of TAFII250. These data suggest that the assembly of transcription initiation complexes is dynamic and can be modulated by specific transcription factors.

AdML, adenovirus major late promoter Transcription of eukaryotic genes is initiated by the orderly assembly of a series of general transcription factors (1.Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). The general transcription factor, TFIID, nucleates the assembly through the binding of its component TBP to a TATAA box or other appropriate promoter element. Other components of TFIID, the TBP-associated factors (TAFs),1 recruit TFIIA and TFIIB, which serves as a bridge to the RNA polymerase II complex, and TFIIE, -F, and -H. As many as 12 distinct TAFs have been isolated and their functions are beginning to be characterized (1.Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Through their interactions with upstream transcription factors, the TAFs also function as coactivators. In Drosophila, the TAFs appear to play a role in promoter selectivity and are required to initiate at promoters that lack a TBP binding site (2.Verrijzer C. Chen J. Yokomori K. Tjian R. Cell. 1995; 81: 1115-1125Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Recent evidence in yeast and mammalian cells indicates that not all TAFs are essential for the transcription of all genes (3.Walker S. Reese J. Apone L. Green M. Nature. 1996; 383: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 4.Moqtaderi Z. Bai Y. Poo D. Weil P. Struhl K. Nature. 1996; 383: 188-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). For example, inactivation of yeast TAFII130, the homolog of TAFII250, affects only a subset of genes. Similarly, a point mutation of TAFII250 results in a temperature-sensitive cell line, tsBN462. At the restrictive temperature, cell cycle is arrested at G1, and transcription of a set of cyclin genes is terminated (5.Wang E. Tjian R. Science. 1994; 263: 811-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 6.Wang E. Zhou S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2658-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 7.Suzuki-Yagawa Guermah M. Roeder R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3284-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, other genes such as c-fos and c-myc continue to be transcribed at the restrictive temperature (5.Wang E. Tjian R. Science. 1994; 263: 811-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 6.Wang E. Zhou S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2658-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 7.Suzuki-Yagawa Guermah M. Roeder R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3284-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Given the disparity in the requirements of different promoters for TAFII250, it is of interest to determine whether the primary role of TAFII250 is to function as a coactivator of upstream transcription factors or as a general transcription factor component that is necessary for assembling a preinitiation complex. Various studies have suggested that promoter dependence on TAFII250 is determined by upstream elements (7.Suzuki-Yagawa Guermah M. Roeder R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3284-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, TAFII250-dependent transcription of the cyclin A gene was mapped to an ATF binding site in the extended cyclin A promoter (6.Wang E. Zhou S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2658-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Similarly, an analysis of the cyclin D1 promoter concluded that the TAFII250 mutation in the ts cells affects the function of upstream activators, not the basal promoter (7.Suzuki-Yagawa Guermah M. Roeder R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3284-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Together, these studies suggest that the primary role of TAFII250 is as a coactivator of upstream activators. However, at least for the cyclin D1 promoter, a function of TAFII250 at the core promoter has not been excluded. Furthermore, studies of both human cyclin A and several yeast promoters have shown that the requirement for TAFII250 is determined by the basal promoter; it has been suggested that TAFII250 is required for promoters that do not contain canonical TATAA boxes (7.Suzuki-Yagawa Guermah M. Roeder R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3284-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,8.Sekiguchi T. Nishimoto T. Hunter T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1797-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The present studies were designed to assess the role(s) of TAFII250 in regulating major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression. Unlike previously studied promoters, the promoters of genes encoding MHC class I are ubiquitously expressed and do not regulate cell cycle or growth. The MHC class I genes encode cell surface molecules that, as dimers with β2-microglobulin, serve as receptors for viral peptides, thereby triggering a cellular immune response. Expression of the class I genes and β2-microglobulin genes are coordinately regulatedin vivo. Consistent with their role in immune surveillance against intracellular pathogens, the class I and β2-microglobulin genes are expressed in nearly all somatic cells (9.Singer D.S. Maguire J. CRC Rev. Immunol. 1990; 10: 235-257Google Scholar). However, the level of expression displays tissue-specific variation, which is further affected by hormonal signals. Although a complex array of upstream DNA elements modulates class I expression, the basal promoter itself is constitutively active in the absence of any upstream activation (10.Maguire J. Frels W. Richardson J. Weissman J. Singer D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3078-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 11.Howcroft T.K. Palmer L. Brown J. Rellahan B. Kashanchi F. Brady J. Singer D.S. Immunity. 1995; 3: 127-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The upstream elements function primarily to modulate this basal level, resulting in either increases or decreases, depending on the tissue and hormonal milieu. We have previously reported that expression of the MHC class I gene, PD1, depends upon a functional TAFII250 (12.Weissman J. Brown J. Howcroft T.K. Hwang J. Chawla A. Roche P. Schiltz L. Nakatani Y. Singer D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11601-11606Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In particular, impairment of TAFII250 function, either through inactivation in the tsBN462 cell line or through inactivation of the intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity, prevented transcription from a PD1 promoter construct consisting of both the basal promoter and upstream sequences. We now report that the basal promoter of PD1, devoid of upstream regulatory elements, depends on a functional TAFII250 for transcription. This dependence is observed both in vivo in tsBN462 cells and in in vitrotranscription assays with extract derived from these cells. The requirement for TAFII250 is not overcome by introducing a canonical TATAA box into the basal promoter. Indeed, mutational analysis of the promoter indicates that TAFII250 does not target a specific element within the promoter; all active basal promoter constructs require TAFII250. The requirement for TAFII250 can be overcome by select transcription factors acting through upstream regulatory elements. In particular, the coactivator CIITA, which activates class I promoter activity, can effectively replace TAFII250 function. In contrast, USF1 and USF2, which also activate the class I promoter, do not overcome the TAFII250 requirement. We further show that the SV40 basal promoter is similarly dependent on TAFII250. This dependence is overcome by the intact viral 72-bp enhancer and by the isolated octamer and AP1 subelements of the enhancer. Interestingly, these viral enhancer elements can overcome the TAFII250 dependence of the class I promoter when introduced upstream. We conclude that TAFII250-independent transcription requires the presence of specific upstream regulatory elements capable of recruiting appropriate coactivators. Furthermore, this leads to the suggestion that an important activity of TAFII250, in support of basal class I expression, is as a coactivator. Taken together, the data suggest that the assembly of transcription initiation complexes is a dynamic process that can be modulated by specific transcription factors. The tsBN462 cells, containing a point mutation in the TAFII250/CCG1 gene and derived from BHK cells as described (13.Hayashida T. Sekiguchi T. Noguchi E. Sunamoto H. Ohba T. Nishimoto T. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 141: 267-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 14.Nakashima T. Sekiguchi T. Sunamoto H. Yura K. Tomoda S. Go M. Kere J. Schlessinger D. Nishimoto T. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 141: 193-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) were obtained from T. Sekiguchi, Salk Institute. The cells were maintained at 32 °C, 7.5% CO2in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Biofluids) with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections were done by CaPO4, as described previously, using 5 μg of DNA, unless otherwise indicated (12.Weissman J. Brown J. Howcroft T.K. Hwang J. Chawla A. Roche P. Schiltz L. Nakatani Y. Singer D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11601-11606Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Following transfection, cells were incubated at 32 °C for 24 h, after which time they were refed with fresh medium and either shifted to 39.5 °C or left at 32 °C. After an additional 24 h, cells were harvested and assayed for CAT activity, as described previously (11.Howcroft T.K. Palmer L. Brown J. Rellahan B. Kashanchi F. Brady J. Singer D.S. Immunity. 1995; 3: 127-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All activities were corrected for protein concentration. No internal control for transfection efficiency could be used because the activity of all of the viral promoters generally used to correct for transfection efficiency increased in response temperature shift; correcting to any of these would have artificially exaggerated the effect of temperature shift on the class I and β2-microglobulin promoters. TAFII250 expression plasmid was a gift of R. Tjian (University of California, Berkeley, CA). The HIVLTR was pBennCAT (15.Leonard J. Parrot C. Buckler-White A. Turner W. Ross E. Martin M. Rabson A. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 4919-4924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rous sarcoma virus, murine leukemia virus, and AdML promoter constructs were as described previously (12.Weissman J. Brown J. Howcroft T.K. Hwang J. Chawla A. Roche P. Schiltz L. Nakatani Y. Singer D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11601-11606Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 16.Howcroft T.K. Huber S. Singer D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4788-4797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PD1 deletion constructs and promoter mutations were described previously (11.Howcroft T.K. Palmer L. Brown J. Rellahan B. Kashanchi F. Brady J. Singer D.S. Immunity. 1995; 3: 127-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 17.Ehrlich R. Singer D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The β2-microglobulin promoter contained 209 bp of upstream sequence (18.Carroll I. Wang J. Howcroft T.K. Singer D.S. Mol. Immun. 1998; 35: 1171-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The HLA-E promoter construct contained 155 bp of upstream sequence and was derived from the HLA 6.2 genomic clone (19.Koller B. Geraghty D. Shimizu Y. DeMars R. Orr H. J. Immunol. 1988; 141: 897-907PubMed Google Scholar) by polymerase chain reaction and cloning into theHindIII/BamHI sites of the pSV3CAT vector. The enhancer/promoter SV40 constructs were as follows. pSV2, the enhancer/promoter, and pSV3, the basal promoter construct, were as described (20.Howcroft T.K. Richardson J. Singer D.S. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3163-3169Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 21.Gorman C. Moffat L. Howard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). The SV40 enhancer subelement constructs were generated by replacing SV40 sequences between the NdeI andSphI sites of pSV3CAT with synthetic oligonucleotides, as described previously (11.Howcroft T.K. Palmer L. Brown J. Rellahan B. Kashanchi F. Brady J. Singer D.S. Immunity. 1995; 3: 127-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The 72-bp enhancer of the SV40 enhancer/promoter was isolated by SphI digestion and introduced into the XbaI site of the class I −68 promoter construct (11.Howcroft T.K. Palmer L. Brown J. Rellahan B. Kashanchi F. Brady J. Singer D.S. Immunity. 1995; 3: 127-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Each of the promoters was ligated to the CAT reporter gene; the HIVLTR was also ligated to luciferase. The CIITA expression plasmid was provided by Dr. Jenny Ting, University of North Carolina (22.Martin B.K. Chin C.K. Olsen J.C. Skinner C.A. Dey A. Ozato K. Ting J.P. Immunity. 1997; 6: 591-600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts were prepared from tsBN462 cells and grown at either 32 °C or 39.5 °C, according to the protocol of Dignam et al. (23.Dignam J. Lebovitz R. Roeder R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). In vitrotranscription reactions contained 135 μg of nuclear extract, 2 μg of −313 DNA, or 1 μg of cytomegalovirus (Promega) DNA and were performed at 20 °C. Analysis of product was by primer extension (12.Weissman J. Brown J. Howcroft T.K. Hwang J. Chawla A. Roche P. Schiltz L. Nakatani Y. Singer D.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 11601-11606Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). A series of cellular and viral promoters was examined for their dependence on TAFII250. We tested three ubiquitously expressed and related cellular promoters whose products are involved in regulating immune responses: an MHC class Ia promoter, PD1, whose gene encodes a classical transplantation antigen; an MHC class Ib promoter, HLA-E, which governs expression of a nonclassical class I molecule; and the promoter of the β2-microglobulin gene, which encodes the light chain that associates with both of the class I heavy chains. All three promoter constructs consisted of their basal promoter and upstream regulatory elements. As shown in Table I, PD1 promoter activity in tsBN462 cells is markedly reduced at the restrictive temperature, indicating that it depends on functional TAFII250. The reduction in PD1 promoter activity is specific to the tsBN462 mutation; in the parental BHK cells, the PD1 promoter construct −313CAT is 1.8 ± 0.5 times more active at 39.5 °C than at 32 °C. As shown in Fig.1, cotransfection of wild type TAFII250 with the class I promoter construct restored promoter activity in tsBN462 cells at the restrictive temperature. From this, we conclude that the class I promoter depends upon TAFII250. Both the β2-microglobulin promoter and the HLA-E promoter are similarly dependent on TAFII250. Thus, among the three related promoters, all require TAFII250.Table IDifferential sensitivity to a TAFII250 mutation among different promotersPromoterRelative activity (39.5 °C/32 °C)Canonical TATAA boxMHC class Ia, PD10.24 ± 0.03NoMHC class Ib, HLA-E0.42 ± 0.02Yesβ2-microglobulin0.33 ± 0.02YesMurine leukemia virus0.99 ± 0.06SV401.7 ± 0.16Rous sarcoma virus3.9 ± 0.44HIV LTR3.8 ± 0.40AdML3.6 ± 0.1Each of the promoters was ligated to a CAT reporter and transfected into tsBN462 cells at the permissive temperature (32 °C).

It has been suggested that TAFII250 dependence correlates with the absence of a canonical TATAA box (7.Suzuki-Yagawa Guermah M. Roeder R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3284-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 8.Sekiguchi T. Nishimoto T. Hunter T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1797-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Consistent with this suggestion, the PD1 promoter does not contain a canonical TATAA box and depends on TAFII250. In contrast, the promoters of both the β2-microglobulin and HLA-E genes contain a canonical TATAA box but still require functional TAFII250 for activity (Table I). Thus, there is no direct correlation between the requirement for TAFII250 and the presence of a canonical TATAA box in these cellular promoters. Five viral promoter/enhancer constructs were also examined (murine leukemia virus, SV40, Rous sarcoma virus, AdML, and HIVLTR); all were as active, or more active, in the tsBN462 cells at the restrictive temperature as at the permissive temperature (Table I). The findings with the SV40 promoter are consistent with those previously reported by others (5.Wang E. Tjian R. Science. 1994; 263: 811-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). To ensure that these results were not because of the use of the common CAT reporter, the HIVLTR was tested with a luciferase reporter, with the same outcome (data not shown). Thus, the viral promoters do not require a functional TAFII250. The remaining studies were directed at characterizing the basis of the PD1 promoter dependence on TAFII250. One of the effects of shifting the tsBN462 cells to 39.5 °C, in addition to inactivating TAFII250, is to arrest cells at G1 in the cell cycle. Thus, in the above in vivo transfection experiments, it is not possible to distinguish whether the temperature shift directly affects the basal promoter requirement for TAFII250 or reduces transcription indirectly through cell cycle arrest. Indeed, previous studies have demonstrated that the rate of transcription of class I genes is cell cycle linked. 2J. D. Weissman and D. S. Singer, unpublished observations. To determine whether inactivation of TAFII250 directly affects transcription of class I, the ability of nuclear extracts from tsBN462 cells to directin vitro transcription of the promoter was tested. Extracts were derived from cells grown either at 32 °C or at 39.5 °C and were used to direct transcription from the −313CAT class I promoter construct. Extracts derived from cells grown at 32 °C were fully competent to direct transcription from the class I promoter (Fig.2, left). However, extracts derived from cells grown at 39.5 °C were defective in transcribing the same promoter (Fig. 2, left). In striking contrast,in vitro transcription of the cytomegalovirus promoter was increased in extracts prepared from cells grown at 39.5 °C, relative to that prepared from cells grown at 32 °C (Fig. 2,right). Because inhibition of class I promoter activity is observed in a cell-free system, it is not secondary to the arrest at G1 of cells following the shift to 39.5 °C. Because the cellular promoter constructs tested contained upstream activating sequences, the observed differential sensitivity among the promoters to the TAFII250 mutation in the tsBN462 cells could be either a reflection of differences in those upstream sequences or of differences in basal promoter architecture. To address this question, the dependence on TAFII250 of a series of nested 5′-truncations of the PD1 promoter was examined. The longest promoter construct, −1013, contains all of the upstream regulatory elements necessary to determine normal patterns of expression of the gene, as demonstrated in transgenic mice (10.Maguire J. Frels W. Richardson J. Weissman J. Singer D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3078-3086Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Deletion of upstream sequences between −1013 and −516 bp removes a series of silencer elements and a complex regulatory element that governs tissue-specific levels of expression (24.Weissman J. Singer D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4217-4227Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). Further truncations successively remove additional tissue-specific regulatory elements (−416), an E-box that is the target for USF activation (−313), enhancer A, the interferon-response element, and the cAMP-responsive element (CRE) (−68) (16.Howcroft T.K. Huber S. Singer D.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4788-4797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Murphy C. Nikodem D. Howcroft K. Weissman J.D. Singer D.S. J. Biol.

A. 1992; 89: 1944-1948Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The −68 promoter construct constitutes the basal promoter and contains only a CCAAT box, a noncanonical TATAA box, an Inr, and an S-box important for promoter function (11.Howcroft T.K. Palmer L. Brown J. Rellahan B. Kashanchi F. Brady J. Singer D.S. Immunity. 1995; 3: 127-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Successive truncations between −1013 and −416 increase promoter activity (Fig. 3). It is important to note that, unlike most basal promoters, the −68 promoter construct is constitutively active and does not require upstream enhancers (Fig.3). The full-length −1013-bp promoter construct is active in the tsBN462 cells at the permissive temperature but is inhibited at the restrictive temperature (Fig. 3). Each of the successive PD1 truncations from −1013 bp increases the promoter dependence on TAFII250 such that the −68-bp construct is approximately 3-fold more sensitive than the −1013-bp construct, despite the fact that at 32 °C, it is significantly more active than the −1013 bp construct (Fig. 3). Thus, although the extended −1013 promoter is still sensitive to partial inhibition at 39.5 °C, its upstream sequences confer a significant level of protection on the basal promoter. In the pattern of its requirement for TAFII250, the PD1 promoter differs from the cyclin A promoter or the cyclin D1 promoter (6.Wang E. Zhou S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2658-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 7.Suzuki-Yagawa Guermah M. Roeder R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3284-3294Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the former case, an upstream ATF/CREB binding site has been reported to function as a temperature-sensitive response element that confers a dependence on TAFII250 (6.Wang E. Zhou S. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2658-2669Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Like the cyclin A promoter, the PD1 promoter contains a functional CRE that has been demonstrated to bind and be activated by ATF/CREB family members (27.Saji M. Shong M. Napolitano G. Palmer L. Taniguchi S. Ohmori M. Ohta M. Suzuki K. Kirshner S. Giuliani C. Singer D.S. Kohn L.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20096-20107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However, unlike the cyclin A promoter, the presence of the CRE does not increase the PD1 promoter dependence on TAFII250 (compare −313-bp and −68-bp constructs). Thus, these findings also indicate that ATF/CREB is not a general determinant of TAFII250 dependence. The above studies map TAFII250 dependence to the PD1 basal promoter, raising the question of whether discrete basal promoter elements establish this requirement. A series of promoter mutations were introduced into the PD1 basal promoter. In one, the noncanonical TATAA box, TCTAA, was restored to a canonical TATAA box (TCT>TATAAA); in another, it was mutated further away from the canonical sequence (TATA M1). Both mutant promoters maintained the requirement for a functional TAFII250 (Fig.4). Thus, the presence of a TATAA box is not sufficient to overcome the requirement for TAFII250. Similarly, the complete absence of a TATAA box does not increase the dependence. A third mutant, in which the Inr was mutated (M3), also retained its dependence on TAFII250 (Fig. 4). Interestingly, a mutant construct in which both the TCTAA box and Inr were mutated was active and remained dependent on TAFII250 (Fig. 4) (11.Howcroft T.K. Palmer L. Brown J. Rellahan B. Kashanchi F. Brady J. Singer D.S. Immunity. 1995; 3: 127-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). All of these promoter mutants retained significant activity, both in the tsBN462 cells at the permissive temperature (Fig.4) and in HeLa cells (11.Howcroft T.K. Palmer L. Brown J. Rellahan B. Kashanchi F. Brady J. Singer D.S. Immunity. 1995; 3: 127-138Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). An extended mutation of the entire central region between the TCTAA and Inr renders the promoter inactive (8.Sekiguchi T. Nishimoto T. Hunter T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1797-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar); it is inactive at both the permissive and restrictive temperatures in tsBN462 cells. In summary, the class I TCTAA box and the Inr are neither necessary nor sufficient for transcription initiation. Further, no specific promoter element was identified that confers a dependence on TAFII250. The role of upstream enhancers in relieving the basal promoter of its dependence on TAFII250 was examined for the SV40 enhancer/promoter construct whose 72-bp repeat enhancer has been extensively characterized. Removal of the two 72-bp enhancer elements (leaving the 21-bp Sp1-binding GC repeats in place) significantly reduces SV40 promoter activity; further removal of the 21-bp repeats eliminates all promoter activity. In the absence of the 72-bp enhancers, the activity of the SV40 promoter dropped 2-fold in the tsBN462 cells at the restrictive temperature relative to the permissive temperature, unlike the SV40 enhancer/promoter construct which was activated by 2-fold (Fig. 5). Thus, removal of the 72-bp enhancer markedly alters the promoter sensitivity to functional TAFII250. These data are consistent with the interpretation that the SV40 basal promoter is inherently dependent upon TAFII250 but that the presence of the enhancer elements overcomes this dependence. The ability of the enhancers to alleviate TAFII250 dependence coul"

(1994)Nature 370, 621–628), the side chain oxygen of βThr163 interacts directly with Mg2+coordinated to 5′-adenylyl β,γ-imidodiphosphate or ADP bound to catalytic sites of β subunits present in closed conformations. In the unliganded β subunit present in an open conformation, the hydroxyl of βThr163 is hydrogen-bonded to the carboxylate of βGlu199. Substitution of βGlu201(equivalent to βGlu199 in MF1) in the α3β3γ subcomplex of the F1-ATPase from the thermophilic Bacillus PS3 with cysteine or valine increases the propensity to entrap inhibitory MgADP in a catalytic site during hydrolysis of 50 μm ATP. These substitutions lower K m3 (the Michaelis constant for trisite ATP hydrolysis) relative to that of the wild type by 25- and 10-fold, respectively. Fluorescence quenching of α3(βE201C/Y341W)3γ and α3(βY341W)3γ mutant subcomplexes showed that MgATP and MgADP bind to the third catalytic site of the double mutant with 8.4- and 4.4-fold higher affinity, respectively, than to the single mutant. These comparisons support the hypothesis that the hydrogen bond observed between the side chains of βThr163and βGlu199 in the unliganded catalytic site in the crystal structure of MF1 stabilizes the open conformation of the catalytic site during ATP hydrolysis.

These comparisons support the hypothesis that the hydrogen bond observed between the side chains of βThr163and βGlu199 in the unliganded catalytic site in the crystal structure of MF1 stabilizes the open conformation of the catalytic site during ATP hydrolysis.

They are composed of F0, an integral membrane protein complex that mediates ion conduction, and F1, a peripheral membrane protein complex containing the catalytic sites. When separated from F0 as a soluble complex, F1 is an ATPase composed of five different subunits with α3β3γδε stoichiometry (1.Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar, 2.Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). F1 contains six nucleotide-binding sites. Three of these participate directly in catalysis. The other three, called noncatalytic sites, do not have a well defined physiological role (2.Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). However, it is clear that saturation of these sites with MgATP in MF1 1 prevents entrapment of inhibitory MgADP when low concentrations of ATP are hydrolyzed (3.Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1558-1566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 2.8-Å resolution crystal structure of bovine MF1 determined by Abrahams et al. (4.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2753) Google Scholar) shows that the catalytic sites are at α/β interfaces, with most residues participating directly in catalysis located in β subunits. Noncatalytic sites are located at different α/β interfaces, with most residues contributing to the binding sites located in α subunits. In the crystal structure, the three noncatalytic sites are homogeneously liganded with MgAMP-PNP. In contrast, catalytic sites are heterogeneously liganded. One (designated βT) contains MgAMP-PNP; another (designated βD) contains MgADP; and the third catalytic site (designated βE) is empty. The α subunits contributing to βT, βD, and βE are designated αT, αD, and αE, respectively (4.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2753) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of the completely unliganded α3β3 subcomplex of TF1 determined at 3.2-Å resolution by Shirakihara et al. (5.Shirakihara Y. Leslie A.G.W. Abrahams J.P. Walker J.E. Ueda T. Sekimoto Y. Kambara M. Saika K. Kagawa Y. Yoshida M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 5: 825-836Scopus (223) Google Scholar), the α and β subunits are arranged symmetrically. The common open conformation of β subunits in the α3β3 subcomplex is essentially identical to that of βE in MF1, and the common conformation of the α subunits is essentially identical to that of the liganded α subunits in MF1. Although it is generally assumed that the three catalytic sites in F1-ATPases exist in tight, loose, and open conformations, scrutiny of the crystal structure of bovine MF1 reveals only two distinctly different conformations. These are the open, unliganded conformation of βE and the nearly identical, closed conformations in βT and βD liganded with MgAMP-PNP and MgADP, respectively (6.Allison W.S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 819-826Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In βT and βD, the hydroxyl oxygen of βThr163 is directly liganded with the Mg2+ ion that interacts with anionic oxygens of phosphates in bound AMP-PNP or ADP, respectively. In contrast, in βE, the hydroxyl of βThr163 is 2.9 Å from a carboxyl oxygen of βGlu199. These groups are 11.4 Å apart in βT and βD, suggesting that the open conformation of βE might be stabilized by the hydrogen bond between the side chains of βThr163 and βGlu199. It is interesting that the carboxyl group of βGlu199 in MF1 or the equivalent residue inEscherichia coli F1 and spinach chloroplast F1 is specifically derivatized on inactivation of ATPase activity with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. In contrast, when TF1 is inactivated with dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (7.Esch F.S. Bohlen P. Otsuka A.S. Yoshida M. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 9084-9089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Yoshida M. Allison W.S. Esch F.S. Futai M. J. Biol.

Chem. 1981; 256: 148-153Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic properties of site-directed mutants of the glutamates in TF1, E. coli F1, andRhodospirillum rubrum F1 that are equivalent to βGlu199 in MF1 also suggest a functional role for this side chain in ATP hydrolysis (11.Senior A.E.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) in TF1 or E. coli F1 or with glutamine, lysine, or glycine in R. rubrum F1 (13.Nathanson L. Gromet-Elhanan Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10933-10938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) significantly lowers ATP hydrolysis under saturating conditions, whereas ATPase activity is attenuated to a lesser extent when the equivalent residue is substituted with Asp (12.Amano T. Tozawa K. Yoshida M. Murakami H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of MF1, βThr163 is hydrogen-bonded to βGlu199 in the open catalytic site, whereas it is liganded with Mg2+ in the two closed, liganded catalytic sites as illustrated elsewhere (4.Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2753) Google Scholar, 6.Allison W.S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 819-826Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This suggests that the hydrogen bond between the side chains observed in the empty catalytic site of MF1 might function to stabilize the open conformation of the catalytic site during catalysis. If this is indeed the case, the affinity of catalytic sites for MgADP and MgATP should increase on substituting βGlu201 in the α3β3γ subcomplex of TF1 with amino acids containing side chains incapable of hydrogen bonding. To test this possibility, the steady-state kinetics of ATP hydrolysis by mutant α3β3γ subcomplexes of TF1 with the βE201C substitution with and without carboxymethylation and with the βE201V substitution have been examined in detail. In addition, the affinities of the βE201C/Y341W double mutant for nucleotides have been determined by assessing quenching of the introduced tryptophan by ATP and ADP in the presence of Mg2+. Enzymes and biochemicals used in assays and buffer components were purchased from Sigma. Iodoacetic acid free of iodine was obtained from Sigma. LDAO was purchased from Calbiochem. Iodo[3H]acetic acid was purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals. Primers for mutations were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Plasmid pKK, which carries the genes for the α, β, and γ subunits of TF1, was used for mutagenesis and gene expression (14.Matsui T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction was used to prepare mutant expression plasmids using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Wild-type pKK was used as the template for the βE201C and βE201V single mutants, and the βY341W mutant plasmid pKK (15.Dou C. Fortes P.A.G. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16757-16764Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was used as the template to generate the βE201C/Y341W double mutant. The primers 5′-GACTTGTACCATGTGATGAAAGATTCCG-3′ and 5′-GACTTGTACCATTGCATGAAAGATTCCG-3′ (with the changed bases underlined) and their corresponding complementary primers were used in polymerase chain reaction to generate the βE201C and βE201V mutants, respectively. The plasmids were purified with the WizardTM Plus Minipreps DNA purification system (Promega). The mutations were confirmed by sequence analysis. The resultant pKK mutant plasmids were expressed in JM103 (unc−). Purification of wild-type α3β3γ and all mutant subcomplexes was performed as described (14.Matsui T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). All enzymes were stored at 4 °C as precipitates in 70% saturated ammonium sulfate. Enzyme stock solutions were prepared by dissolving pelleted ammonium sulfate precipitates obtained by centrifugation in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm CDTA. After 1 h at room temperature, dissolved enzymes were passed through 1-ml centrifuge columns of Sephadex G-50 equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 mm EDTA. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (16.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar) using Coomassie Blue (Pierce). ATPase activity was determined spectrophotometrically using an ATP regeneration system at 30 °C and pH 8.0 (3.Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1558-1566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, the Mg2+ concentration in the assay medium was 1 mm in excess of the ATP concentration. The NADH used in the assays contained negligible ADP. Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting in Ecoscint (National Diagnostics, Inc.). Iodoacetate (100 mm) adjusted to pH 7.0 with NaOH was added to a final concentration of 2 mm to a 2 mg/ml solution of the βE201C mutant subcomplex in 50 mmTris-Cl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 mm EDTA. The reaction mixture was incubated for 16 h at room temperature, at which time excess iodoacetate was removed by passing it through a centrifuge column of Sephadex G-50 equilibrated with 50 mmTris-Cl. Preliminary experiments showed that treatment of the βE201C subcomplex with 2 mm iodo[3H]acetate leads to parallel activation of ATPase activity and incorporation of covalently bound [3H]acetate. The first 2 mol of [3H]acetate were incorporated within 7 h, whereas incorporation of a third mole was not complete after another 17 h when 2.7 mol of reagent were incorporated per mol of enzyme. After carboxymethylation for 24 h, the specific activity increased from 1.1 to 2.9 μmol of ATP hydrolyzed min−1mg−1. Although the wild-type α3β3γ subcomplex contains αCys193, only 0.2 mol of [3H]acetate were incorporated per mol of enzyme when it was treated with iodo[3H]acetate under the same conditions without altering ATPase activity. Therefore, modification of βCys201 is responsible for the increase in ATPase activity observed with the mutant subcomplex. Titrations of catalytic sites of the βY341W and βE201C/Y341W mutant subcomplexes with nucleotides were determined directly by monitoring quenching of tryptophan fluorescence with a Spex Fluoromax-2 spectrofluorometer according to Weber et al.(17.Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.-F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Titrations were performed with 50 nm solutions of the βY341W or βE201C/Y341W mutant enzyme in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, to which was added 50 nm to 1 mm ATP or ADP. In titrations with MgATP or MgADP, MgCl2 was present in 1 mm excess over ATP or ADP. Fluorescence measurements were recorded 30 s after addition of nucleotide. During titrations with MgATP, fresh enzyme solutions were prepared for each concentration of nucleotide examined. It has been shown that the wild-type subcomplex hydrolyzes 50 μm ATP in three kinetic phases (18.Jault J.-M. Matsui T. Jault F.M. Kaibara C. Muneyuki E. Yoshida M. Kagawa Y. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16412-16418Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A burst rapidly decelerates to an intermediate, slow phase that slowly accelerates to a final rate that approaches the initial rate. Transition from the burst phase to the intermediate phase is caused by turnover-dependent entrapment of MgADP in a catalytic site, and transition from the intermediate phase to the final rate reflects slow binding of ATP to noncatalytic sites that promotes dissociation of the inhibitory MgADP from the affected catalytic site. Earlier studies have shown that only a single, rapid kinetic phase is observed when the wild-type subcomplex hydrolyzes 50 μmATP in the presence of low concentrations of LDAO, indicating little or no entrapment of inhibitory MgADP during turnover. Entrapment of inhibitory MgADP is augmented when the wild-type subcomplex is assayed in the presence of azide (15.Dou C. Fortes P.A.G. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16757-16764Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To assess the propensity of mutant α3β3γ subcomplexes to entrap inhibitory MgADP during turnover, the characteristics of hydrolysis of 50 μm ATP by the wild-type and mutant subcomplexes in the presence or absence of 0.06% LDAO or 1 mm NaN3were compared. The results of this comparison are illustrated in Fig.1. The numbers associated with the traces in Fig. 1 are the approximate specific activities of the subcomplexes at the final 30-s interval recorded. Trace a in panel A-I illustrates the three kinetic phases exhibited when the wild-type α3β3γ subcomplex hydrolyzed 50 μm ATP. In contrast, in the presence of LDAO, the rate of ATP hydrolysis by the wild-type subcomplex was nearly linear (trace c). LDAO stimulated the ATPase activity of the wild-type subcomplex ∼3-fold. Trace b shows that hydrolysis of 50 μm ATP in the presence of 1 mm NaN3 proceeded with an initial burst that rapidly decelerated to a severely inhibited rate. It was previously shown that the α3(βY341W)3γ subcomplex is much less sensitive than the wild type to turnover-dependent inhibition induced by azide during hydrolysis of 2 mm ATP (15.Dou C. Fortes P.A.G. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16757-16764Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Comparison of traces b in panels A-I and A-II shows that hydrolysis of 50 μm ATP by the α3(βY341W)3γ subcomplex was less sensitive than that by the wild type to turnover-dependent inhibition by 1 mm NaN3. Comparison oftraces c in these panels shows that LDAO had a much smaller stimulatory effect on the α3(βY341W)3γ subcomplex than on the wild type. Fig. 1 (panel B-I) illustrates that the βE201C mutant subcomplex hydrolyzed 50 μm ATP in three kinetic phases both in the presence and absence of LDAO. Whereas a prolonged intermediate phase was observed in the absence of LDAO (trace a), a relatively brief intermediate phase was observed in the presence of the detergent (trace c). The characteristics of hydrolysis of 50 μm ATP by the βE201V mutant were similar to those of the βE201C mutant, except that the rates of hydrolysis were much slower under each condition. Panel B-IIillustrates the hydrolysis of 50 μm ATP by the carboxymethylated βE201C mutant. Carboxymethylation of the mutant subcomplex stimulated the rate of hydrolysis of 50 μm ATP ∼3.5-fold in the absence of LDAO (trace a). The rate of hydrolysis of 50 μm ATP by the carboxymethylated enzyme was stimulated ∼6-fold and was nearly linear in the presence of LDAO (trace c). Comparison of traces b inpanels A-I, B-I, and B-IIshows that the βE201C and carboxymethylated βE201C mutant subcomplexes were much more sensitive than the wild type to inhibition by azide and that carboxymethylation of the βE201C subcomplex slightly relieved inhibition by azide. Comparison of panels A-II and B-III illustrates that the α3(βE201C/Y341W)3γ double mutant was a much more sluggish enzyme in the presence and absence of LDAO and was much more sensitive than the α3(βY341W)3γ subcomplex to turnover-dependent inhibition by azide. Entrapment of inhibitory MgADP in a catalytic site when F1-ATPases hydrolyze ATP introduces an increase in slope in Lineweaver-Burk plots at high ATP concentration. This increased slope reflects ATP binding to noncatalytic sites rather than catalytic sites. Binding of ATP to noncatalytic sites promotes dissociation of inhibitory MgADP from the affected catalytic site, thus effectively increasing the concentration of active enzyme (3.Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1558-1566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The steady-state kinetic parameters obtained for the hydrolysis of 2–2000 μm ATP by the wild-type and mutant enzyme subcomplexes are summarized in Table I. TheK noncat values in Table I were determined from extrapolation of the linear segment of the Lineweaver-Burk plots with highest slope. In cases where plots with only two distinct slopes were obtained, K m3 was estimated from the intercept on the negative abscissa of the segment of lower slope. When plots with three distinct slopes were observed, the segment of least slope was extrapolated to estimate K m2, and the segment with intermediate slope was extrapolated to obtainK m3. To obtain reliableK noncat and k cat values for the α3(βY341W)3γ subcomplex, ATP hydrolysis was examined over the range of 2–5000 μm ATP rather than that of 2–2000 μm ATP examined with the other subcomplexes.Table IComparison of the steady-state kinetic parameters of the wild-type and mutant α3β3γ subcomplexesSubcomplexK m2K m3K noncatk catμmμmμms −1α3β3γ1.743180120α3β3γ + LDAOaCases in which a change in slope on Lineweaver-Burk plots was not exhibited in the presence of LDAO with the wild-type and α3(βE201C)3γ subcomplexes in the range of 2–50 μm ATP.43bCases in which, in the presence of LDAO, Lineweaver-Burk plots showed slight downward curvature at high ATP concentrations, but reliable K noncat values could not be obtained from extrapolations.260α3(βE201C)3γND1.62406α3(βE201 C)3γ + LDAOaCases in which a change in slope on Lineweaver-Burk plots was not exhibited in the presence of LDAO with the wild-type and α3(βE201C)3γ subcomplexes in the range of 2–50 μm ATP.33bCases in which, in the presence of LDAO, Lineweaver-Burk plots showed slight downward curvature at high ATP concentrations, but reliable K noncat values could not be obtained from extrapolations.11α3(βE201 V)3γNDcCases in which the K d2 value could not be detected in the concentration range of ATP examined.4.02002carboxymethylated α3(βF201 C)3γ∼17425016α3(βY341W)3γ371420160α3(βY341W)3γ + LDAO5100bCases in which, in the presence of LDAO, Lineweaver-Burk plots showed slight downward curvature at high ATP concentrations, but reliable K noncat values could not be obtained from extrapolations.180α3(βE201C/Y341W)3γND3.21707α3(βE201C/Y341W)3 γ + LDAOND73bCases in which, in the presence of LDAO, Lineweaver-Burk plots showed slight downward curvature at high ATP concentrations, but reliable K noncat values could not be obtained from extrapolations.15Enzyme assays were conducted as described previously (3.Jault J.-M.

Open table in a new tab Enzyme assays were conducted as described previously (3.Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. J. Biol.

The Lineweaver-Burk plot for the wild-type subcomplex revealed aK m2 value for bisite ATP hydrolysis of 1.7 μm and a K m3 value of 43 μm for trisite ATP hydrolysis. TheK noncat value for the wild-type enzyme is 180 μm. The K noncat values varied from 170 to 420 μm for the mutant subcomplexes. The very low rates of ATP hydrolysis observed when the α3(βE201C)3γ and α3(βE201V)3γ subcomplexes hydrolyzed low concentrations of ATP precluded estimation ofK m2 values. However, following carboxymethylation with iodoacetate, the ATPase activity of the α3(βE201C)3γ subcomplex increased significantly, thus allowing estimation of aK m2 value of ∼1 μm. The K m3 values obtained for the α3(βE201C)3γ, α3(βE201V)3γ, and α3(βE201C/Y341W)3γ mutants were 25-, 10-, and 13-fold lower than that of the wild type, respectively. Thek cat values tabulated were determined from extrapolation of the linear segment of the Lineweaver-Burk plots with highest slope. They represent maximal rates of ATP hydrolysis when catalytic and noncatalytic sites are saturated with ATP. By monitoring quenching of fluorescence of the introduced tryptophan in the βY331W mutant ofE. coli F1, Weber et al. (17.Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.-F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) clearly established that MgATP binds to the three catalytic sites with widely different affinities. Moreover, they established that maximal velocity is attained when three catalytic sites are saturated with ATP. Similar results have been obtained with the α3(βY341W)3γ subcomplex of TF1. Fig. 2 illustrates titration curves obtained from fluorescence measurements of 50 nm solutions of the α3(βY341W)3γ and α3(βE201C/Y341W)3γ subcomplexes with 50 nm to 1 mm ATP and in the presence of 1 mm excess Mg2+ with and without 0.06% LDAO. The curves illustrated were generated with the assumption that saturation of each catalytic site with MgATP quenched one-third of the total fluorescence of the introduced tryptophan. The titration curve for the α3(βY341W)3γ subcomplex in the absence of LDAO illustrated in Fig. 2 differs from that previously published (15.Dou C. Fortes P.A.G. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16757-16764Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) in that the concentration of free MgATP rather than total MgATP is plotted on the abscissa. Fig. 2 shows that in the presence of excess Mg2+, but in the absence of LDAO, one catalytic site saturated at the lowest concentration of ATP added to the α3(βY341W)3γ subcomplex. This corresponds to the high affinity catalytic site characterized in unisite experiments (19.Grubmeyer C. Cross R.L. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12092-12100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Cross R.L. Grubmeyer C. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12101-12105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Complex behavior was exhibited during titration of the second catalytic site with MgATP in the absence of LDAO. Under these conditions, a theoretical binding curve with a singleK d that fit the experimental data in this region of the titration curve could not be generated by computer using the equation described by Weber et al. (17.Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.-F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, when catalytic sites of the α3(βY341W)3γ subcomplex were titrated with MgATP in the presence of LDAO, a theoretical binding curve was generated from whichK d2 andK d3 values of 0.9 and 47 μm, respectively, were estimated. Fig. 2 illustrates that two catalytic sites of the α3(βE201C/Y341W)3γ double mutant were nearly saturated at the lowest concentration of ATP added to it in the presence of Mg2+, but in the absence of LDAO. However, when titrated with MgATP in the presence of 0.06% LDAO,K d2 andK d3 values of 0.02 of 6.9 μm, respectively, were estimated from a computer-generated theoretical binding curve. In all cases, theK d1 value was too low for reliable estimation. Fig. 3 compares titration of the α3(βY341W)3γ and α3(βE201C/Y341W)3γ subcomplexes with MgADP in the presence and absence of LDAO. These titration curves are very similar to those shown in Fig. 2 for titrations with MgATP. Again,K d2 values could not be estimated by curve fitting when titrations were carried out in the absence of LDAO. The K d2 andK d3 values estimated from curve fitting for titrations in the presence of 0.06% LDAO are given in TableII.Table IISummary of Kd values estimated from fluorescence quenching measurementsConditionsα3(β341W)3γα3(βE201C/Y341W)3γμmμmK d2, MgATPaIn the absence of LDAO K d2values could not be estimated from the complex patterns of fluorescence quenching obtained when the α3(βY341W)3γ and α3(βE201C/Y341W)3γ mutant subcomplexes were titrated with MgATP or MgADP.aIn the absence of LDAO K d2values could not be estimated from the complex patterns of fluorescence quenching obtained when the α3(βY341W)3γ and α3(βE201C/Y341W)3γ mutant subcomplexes were titrated with MgATP or MgADP.K d2, MgATP + LDAO0.90.02K d3, MgATP212.5K d3, MgATP + LDAO476.9K d2, MgADPaIn the absence of LDAO K d2values could not be estimated from the complex patterns of fluorescence quenching obtained when the α3(βY341W)3γ and α3(βE201C/Y341W)3γ mutant subcomplexes were titrated with MgATP or MgADP.aIn the absence of LDAO K d2values could not be estimated from the complex patterns of fluorescence quenching obtained when the α3(βY341W)3γ and α3(βE201C/Y341W)3γ mutant subcomplexes were titrated with MgATP or MgADP.K d2, MgADP + LDAO0.80.03K d3, MgADP143.2K d3, MgADP + LDAO437.4Fluorescence measurements were obtained as described under “Experimental Procedures” and in the legend to Fig. 2.

Interaction between hTAFII28 and the VDR and TR LBDs was ligand-reversible, whereas no interactions between hTAFII28 and the retinoid X receptors (RXRs) or other receptors were observed. TAFII28 interacted with two regions of the VDR, a 40-amino acid region spanning α-helices H3–H5 and α-helix H8. Interactions were also observed with the H3–H5 region of the TRα but not with the equivalent highly related region of the RXRγ. Fine mapping using RXR derivatives in which single amino acids of the RXRγ LBD have been replaced with their VDR counterparts shows that the determinants for interaction with hTAFII28 are located in α-helix H3 and are not identical to those previously identified for interactions with hTAFII55. We also describe a mutation in the H3–H5 region of the VDR LBD, which abolishes transactivation, and we show that interaction of hTAFII28 with this mutant is no longer ligand-reversible.

In yeast, a variable requirement for TAFIIs has been found. Temperature sensitive mutations in yeast TAFII145 (yTAFII145) result in cell cycle arrest and lethality, but the expression of only a small number of genes is affected (15.Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G.

In contrast, tight temperature-sensitive mutations in yTAFII17, yTAFII25, yTAFII60, yTAFII61/68, and the TFIID-specific yTAFII40 strongly affect the transcription of the majority of yeast genes (16.Apone L.M.

For example, distinct domains of hTAFII135 interact specifically with Sp1, cAMP response element-binding protein, and E1A, and coexpression of these hTAFII135 derivatives has a dominant negative effect on the activity of these activators (22.Tanese N.

Virol. 1997; 71: 7978-7983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas coexpression of hTAFII135 strongly potentiates transcriptional activation by several nuclear receptors (26.Mengus G. May M. Carré L. Chambon P. Davidson I. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1381-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Similarly, hTAFII105 interacts specifically with the p65 subunit of nuclear factor-κB, and TAFII105 expression potentiates activation by nuclear factor-κB in mammalian cells (27.Yamit-Hezi A. Dikstein R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5161-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar).The viral protein Tax interacts directly with hTAFII28, and coexpression of hTAFII28 strongly potentiates activation by Tax (28.Caron C.

Expression of hTAFII28 also potentiates activation by the ligand-dependent activation function-2 of the nuclear receptors (NRs) for vitamin D3 (VDR), 9-cis retinoic acid (RXR), and estrogen (29.May M. Mengus G. Lavigne A.C. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3093-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 30.Davidson I. Romier C. Lavigne A.C. Birck C. Mengus G. Poch O. Moras D. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Coexpression of TBP and hTAFII28 shows that they act synergistically to potentiate activation by the VDR or estrogen receptor. This synergism requires specific amino acids of the hTAFII28 histone fold domain located in the conserved C-terminal half of the protein and can also be abolished by a mutation in the H1′ helix of TBP (31.Birck C. Poch O. Romier C. Ruff M. Mengus G. Lavigne A.C. Davidson I. Moras D. Cell. 1998; 94: 239-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 32.Lavigne A.C. Gangloff Y.G.

Mengus G. Lavigne A.C. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3093-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that hTAFII28 does selectively interact with the VDR and thyroid hormone receptor (TRα) but does so in a ligand-reversible manner. Analysis of hTAFII interaction with VDR deletion mutants shows that hTAFII28 interacts with a 40-amino acid region spanning α-helices H3–H5 and containing the NR signature and previously shown also to interact with hTAFII55 (33.Lavigne A.C. Mengus G. Gangloff Y.G. Wurtz J.M. Davidson I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5486-5494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interaction was also seen with the H3–H5 region of the TRα but not with the analogous highly related region of the RXRγ. Substituting single amino acids of the RXRγ H3–H5 region with their counterparts from the VDR induced interactions with hTAFII28, but comparison with the results previously obtained with hTAFII55 indicates that the determinants for the interaction of these TAFIIs with this region are not identical. We also show that exchange of amino acids in the H3–H5 region between the VDR and RXR leads to a loss of activity in the case of the VDR and a gain of activity in the case of the RXR.

Temperature sensitive mutations in yeast TAFII145 (yTAFII145) result in cell cycle arrest and lethality, but the expression of only a small number of genes is affected (15.Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G.

In contrast, tight temperature-sensitive mutations in yTAFII17, yTAFII25, yTAFII60, yTAFII61/68, and the TFIID-specific yTAFII40 strongly affect the transcription of the majority of yeast genes (16.Apone L.M.

An increasing body of results also shows that human TAFII28 (hTAFII28), hTAFII135, and hTAFII105 can act as specific transcriptional coactivators in mammalian cells. For example, distinct domains of hTAFII135 interact specifically with Sp1, cAMP response element-binding protein, and E1A, and coexpression of these hTAFII135 derivatives has a dominant negative effect on the activity of these activators (22.Tanese N.

Virol. 1997; 71: 7978-7983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas coexpression of hTAFII135 strongly potentiates transcriptional activation by several nuclear receptors (26.Mengus G. May M. Carré L. Chambon P. Davidson I. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1381-1395Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Similarly, hTAFII105 interacts specifically with the p65 subunit of nuclear factor-κB, and TAFII105 expression potentiates activation by nuclear factor-κB in mammalian cells (27.Yamit-Hezi A. Dikstein R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5161-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The viral protein Tax interacts directly with hTAFII28, and coexpression of hTAFII28 strongly potentiates activation by Tax (28.Caron C. Mengus G. Dubrowskaya V. Roisin A. Davidson I. Jalinot P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3662-3667Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Expression of hTAFII28 also potentiates activation by the ligand-dependent activation function-2 of the nuclear receptors (NRs) for vitamin D3 (VDR), 9-cis retinoic acid (RXR), and estrogen (29.May M. Mengus G. Lavigne A.C. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3093-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 30.Davidson I. Romier C. Lavigne A.C. Birck C. Mengus G. Poch O. Moras D. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Coexpression of TBP and hTAFII28 shows that they act synergistically to potentiate activation by the VDR or estrogen receptor. This synergism requires specific amino acids of the hTAFII28 histone fold domain located in the conserved C-terminal half of the protein and can also be abolished by a mutation in the H1′ helix of TBP (31.Birck C. Poch O. Romier C. Ruff M. Mengus G. Lavigne A.C. Davidson I. Moras D. Cell. 1998; 94: 239-249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 32.Lavigne A.C. Gangloff Y.G. Carré L. Mengus G. Birck C. Poch O. Romier C. Moras D. Davidson I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5050-5060Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Despite its ability to act as a transcriptional coactivator for several NRs, we previously reported that no ligand-dependent interactions with the RXR could be observed (29.May M. Mengus G. Lavigne A.C. Chambon P. Davidson I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3093-3104Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that hTAFII28 does selectively interact with the VDR and thyroid hormone receptor (TRα) but does so in a ligand-reversible manner. Analysis of hTAFII interaction with VDR deletion mutants shows that hTAFII28 interacts with a 40-amino acid region spanning α-helices H3–H5 and containing the NR signature and previously shown also to interact with hTAFII55 (33.Lavigne A.C. Mengus G. Gangloff Y.G. Wurtz J.M. Davidson I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5486-5494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interaction was also seen with the H3–H5 region of the TRα but not with the analogous highly related region of the RXRγ. Substituting single amino acids of the RXRγ H3–H5 region with their counterparts from the VDR induced interactions with hTAFII28, but comparison with the results previously obtained with hTAFII55 indicates that the determinants for the interaction of these TAFIIs with this region are not identical. We also show that exchange of amino acids in the H3–H5 region between the VDR and RXR leads to a loss of activity in the case of the VDR and a gain of activity in the case of the RXR. We thank N. Rochel and J. M. Wurtz for access to the crystal structure of the VDR, S. Vicaire and D. Stephane for DNA sequencing, Y.

Res. 67, 98–104) demonstrated that spores from different fungal species differentially activate rat alveolar macrophages as detected by the measurement of superoxide anion and cytokine production (Shahan, T. A., Siegel, P. D., Sorenson, W. G., Kuschner, W. G., and Lewis, D. M. (1998) Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 18, 435–441). Spores from Aspergillus candidusstimulated production of the highest levels of superoxide anion (5.2 nmol/1.0 × 106 alveolar macrophages (AMs)/30 min), followed by those from Aspergillus niger (2.4 nmol/1.0 × 106 AMs/30 min) and Eurotium amstelodami (0.4 nmol/1.0 × 106 AMs/30 min). The mechanism of this differential activation was studied. Our data demonstrate that the tyrosine kinases p56Hck, p72Syk, p77Btk, p62Yes, p56Lck, and p59Fyn were specifically activated in response to spores from A. candidus, whereas spores from either A. niger or E. amstelodami activated p56Hck, p72Syk, and p77Btk. Kinetic analysis of specific tyrosine kinases demonstrated that p56Hck, p72Syk, and p77Btk were activated faster and to a greater extent by spores from A. candidus as compared with spores from E. amstelodami. These data suggest a relationship between reactive oxygen species and tyrosine kinase activation. Treatment of AMs with H2O2 (1 mm) caused the activation of p72Syk only, whereas treatment with superoxide dismutase and catalase before treatment with the spores had no effect on tyrosine kinase activation. Incubation with NADPH oxidase inhibitors inhibited both superoxide anion production and the activation of p56Hck, p72Syk, and p77Btk in response to fungal spores. These data indicate that endogenous reactive oxygen species are necessary for the activation of p56Hck, p72Syk, and p77Btk by spores; they also indicate that some species of spores are capable of activating tyrosine kinases independent of superoxide anion."
