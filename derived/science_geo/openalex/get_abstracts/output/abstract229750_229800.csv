https://openalex.org/W2041739600,"How tissues generate and maintain the correct number of cells is a fundamental problem in biology. In principle, tissue turnover can occur by the differentiation of stem cells, as is well documented for blood, skin and intestine, or by the duplication of existing differentiated cells. Recent work on adult stem cells has highlighted their potential contribution to organ maintenance and repair. However, the extent to which stem cells actually participate in these processes in vivo is not clear. Here we introduce a method for genetic lineage tracing to determine the contribution of stem cells to a tissue of interest. We focus on pancreatic beta-cells, whose postnatal origins remain controversial. Our analysis shows that pre-existing beta-cells, rather than pluripotent stem cells, are the major source of new beta-cells during adult life and after pancreatectomy in mice. These results suggest that terminally differentiated beta-cells retain a significant proliferative capacity in vivo and cast doubt on the idea that adult stem cells have a significant role in beta-cell replenishment."

https://openalex.org/W2003362321,"Caspases mediate essential key proteolytic events in inflammatory cascades and the apoptotic cell death pathway. Human caspases functionally segregate into two distinct subfamilies: those involved in cytokine maturation (caspase-1, -4 and -5) and those involved in cellular apoptosis (caspase-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, -9 and -10)1,2. Although caspase-12 is phylogenetically related to the cytokine maturation caspases, in mice it has been proposed as a mediator of apoptosis induced by endoplasmic reticulum stress including amyloid-β cytotoxicity, suggesting that it might contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease3. Here we show that a single nucleotide polymorphism in caspase-12 in humans results in the synthesis of either a truncated protein (Csp12-S) or a full-length caspase proenzyme (Csp12-L). The read-through single nucleotide polymorphism encoding Csp12-L is confined to populations of African descent and confers hypo-responsiveness to lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cytokine production in ex vivo whole blood, but has no significant effect on apoptotic sensitivity. In a preliminary study, we find that the frequency of the Csp12-L allele is increased in African American individuals with severe sepsis. Thus, Csp12-L attenuates the inflammatory and innate immune response to endotoxins and in doing so may constitute a risk factor for developing sepsis."

Several ROS-scavenging systems tightly control cellular redox balance; however, their role in hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress is unclear. A ubiquitous antioxidative mechanism for regulating cellular redox balance is thioredoxin, a highly conserved thiol reductase that interacts with an endogenous inhibitor, thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip). Here we show that hyperglycemia inhibits thioredoxin ROS-scavenging function through p38 MAPK-mediated induction of Txnip. Overexpression of Txnip increased oxidative stress, while Txnip gene silencing restored thioredoxin activity in hyperglycemia. Diabetic animals exhibited increased vascular expression of Txnip and reduced thioredoxin activity, which normalized with insulin treatment. These results provide evidence for the impairment of a major ROS-scavenging system in hyperglycemia.

Previously, oxidative stress in diabetes mellitus has been linked to enhanced production of superoxide anion by mitochondria (9Nishikawa T. Edelstein D. Du X.L. Yamagishi S. Matsumura T. Kaneda Y.

However, the intracellular redox balance is maintained by ROS-scavenging systems, and the two major intracellular thiol-reducing mechanisms are the interacting glutathione and thioredoxin systems (8Nordberg J. Arner E.S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2001; 31: 1287-1312Crossref PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar, 11Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Griendling K.K. Alexander R.W. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3264-3265PubMed Google Scholar). Thioredoxin reduces ROS through reversible oxidation of thioredoxin at two cysteine residues (Cys-32 and Cys-35); thioredoxin is then reduced by thioredoxin reductase and NAPDH (11Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip), the endogenous inhibitor of thioredoxin also known as vitamin D3 up-regulated protein-1 (VDUP-1) (13Wang Y. De Keulenaer G.W. Lee R.T. J. Biol.

In contrast to previous reports describing an increased formation of reactive oxygen species in hyperglycemia, our study demonstrates the functional inhibition of a major cytoplasmic antioxidant system in hyperglycemia. Moreover, the inhibition of thioredoxin function in hyperglycemia through increased interaction with its inhibitor Txnip forms the molecular basis of increased levels of the freely diffusible molecule hydrogen peroxide contributing to oxidative stress. This molecular interaction might play a central role in increasing levels of reactive oxygen species by reduced flow through the enzymatic pathways of ROS scavenging. Cell Culture—Human aortic smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were isolated from surgical specimens and cultured in Dulbecco's modified essential medium with 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were starved for 48 h in insulin-transferrin medium prior to experiments. Stimulation experiments were performed using glucose (Sigma), insulin (100 nm, Sigma), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) (100 ng/ml, Upstate Biotechnology), PDGF-BB (4 ng/ml, Upstate Biotechnology). The following inhibitors were used: wortmannin (100 nm, Sigma), PD169316 (100 nm, Calbiochem), U0126 (10 μm, Calbiochem), GF109203X (5 μm, Calbiochem), and pertussis toxin (500 ng/ml, Sigma). Northern and Western Analyses—For the detection of mRNA transcripts by Northern analysis, specific cDNA probes were synthesized using the following oligonucleotides: thioredoxin, 5′-AGCAGCCAAGATGGTGAAGCAGA-3′ and 5′-GCTCCAGAAAATTCACCCACC-3′; Txnip, 5′-TCTGCCAAAAAGGAGAAGAAAG-3′ and 5′-GGCGTACATAAAGATAGGGCTG-3′. Total RNA was isolated and loaded to a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel. After transfer, the membranes were incubated with radioactive labeled probes, and specific binding was visualized with autoradiography. Western analysis was performed using a specific monoclonal anti-Txnip antibody that was raised against full-length human Txnip. Thioredoxin was detected by a monoclonal anti-thioredoxin antibody (Medical Biological Laboratories International). After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, specific bands were visualized by enzymatic chemiluminescence reaction (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Total Akt, phospho-Akt, total p38 MAPK, and phospho-p38 MAPK were detected using specific antibodies (Cell Signaling). Real Time PCR—Txnip gene expression was analyzed by real time PCR (LightCycler, Roche Applied Science) using specific oligonucleotides: human Txnip, 5′-TGGTGGATGTCAATACCCCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATTGGCAAGGTAAGTGTGGC-3′ (antisense); human β-tubulin, 5′-TCTGTTCGCTCAGGTCCTTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTCATGATGCGATCAGGGTA-3′ (antisense); rat Txnip, 5′-CAAGTTCGGCTTTGAGCTTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCCATTGGCAAGGTAAGTGT-3′ (antisense); rat β-tubulin, 5′-CATCCAGGAGCTCTTCAAGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGCCTTAGGCCTCTTCTTCT-3′ (antisense); human thioredoxin, 5′-AGCAGCCAAGATGGTGAAGCAGA-3 (sense) and 5′-GCTCCAGAAAATTCACCCACC-3′ (antisense); rat thioredoxin, 5′-GCTGATCGAGAGCAAGGAAG-3 (sense) and 5′-TCAAGGAACACCACATTGGA-3′ (antisense). Adenoviral Vectors for Gene Transfer—Adenoviral vectors for overexpression of TRX (AdTRX) and Txnip (AdTxnip) were used as described elsewhere (14Schulze P.C. De Keulenaer G.W. Yoshioka J. Kassik K.A. Lee R.T. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Gene Silencing by Small Interfering RNA (RNAi)—Double-stranded RNAi (Qiagen) for selective silencing of Txnip (rACAGACUUCGGAGUACCUGdTT) was transfected into cells (FuGENE Reagent, Roche Applied Science). After transfection, cells were incubated with glucose for Txnip expression. Scrambled RNAi was used as control. Measurement of Oxidative Stress—Cells were incubated with 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorecein diacetate (DCFDA) for 45 min, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and fluorescence intensity measured using a fluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Science) at 595 nm. Tissue levels of ROS were detected on frozen sections by incubation with dihydroethidium bromide (DHE) for 30 min at 37 °C followed by fluorescence microscopy. Thioredoxin Activity Assay—Thioredoxin activity was measured using the insulin disulfide reduction assay as described elsewhere (11Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, 50 μg of cellular protein extracts were incubated at 37 °C for 15 min with activation buffer to reduce thioredoxin. After addition of reaction buffer, the reaction was started with 5 μl of bovine thioredoxin reductase (American Diagnostica Inc., Greenwich, CT) or 5 μl of water to controls and samples incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 250 μl of stopping buffer followed by absorption measurement at 412 nm. In Vivo Model of Diabetes Mellitus—Streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg) was injected intraperitoneally in adult Sprague-Dawley rats. The animals were either sacrificed 4 weeks after injection of STZ or treated with insulin (10 IU/kg/day, subcutaneously). Vehicle-injected animals served as controls. Vascular tissues were isolated from the aorta of the animals. All experimental procedures complied with the rules and regulations of the Committee on Ethics and Animal Research at the Joslin Diabetes Center. Histology—Thioredoxin and Txnip were immunohistochemically detected by incubation with primary antibody (1:200) followed by incubation with biotinylated secondary antibody (1:200). Specific binding was visualized by diaminobenzoate. Statistical Analysis—All in vitro experiments were performed at least three times and data are expressed as mean ± s.d. The data were analyzed by Student's t test. One-way analysis of variance with post hoc analysis was used for the analysis of data sets of more than two groups. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Induction of Txnip in Hyperglycemia Enhances Oxidative Stress—Since increased oxidative stress contributes to the development of vascular complications in diabetes, we investigated the regulation of thioredoxin antioxidative function in hyperglycemia. Human aortic SMCs incubated with increasing concentrations of glucose showed a concentration-dependent reduction of thioredoxin activity (25 mm glucose: –55 ± 19% versus base line, p < 0.01; Fig. 1A). Thioredoxin can be oxidized through interaction with hydrogen peroxide (11Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which can be measured by the cell-permeable and redox-sensitive compound DCFDA (6Sundaresan M. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2314) Google Scholar). Incubation of SMCs with glucose increased intracellular levels of ROS as assessed by DCFDA fluorescence in a concentration-dependent matter (10 mm glucose: +40.2 ± 8.5%; p < 0.01 versus 5.6 mm glucose and 25 mm glucose: +76.3 ± 2.7%; p < 0.001 versus 5.6 mm glucose). Glucose incubation did not change the expression of thioredoxin mRNA or protein levels (Fig. 1B). However, incubation with glucose markedly induced expression of Txnip (18.6 ± 6.4-fold versus base line; p < 0.05; Fig. 1B) both in cells stimulated with 25 mm glucose after being cultured for 48 h with 5.6 mm glucose (340 ± 64%) and cells cultured in glucose-free medium (440 ± 112% versus base line; p < 0.05). Co-incubation with insulin had no effect on the regulation of Txnip suggesting that glucose directly and independently regulates Txnip expression (Fig. 1C). Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that the hyperglycemia-induced increase in Txnip protein levels enhanced the thioredoxin/Txnip protein interaction (Fig. 1D). The induction of Txnip by glucose was also found in several primary and non-primary cells such as neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (17.0 ± 5.1-fold; p < 0.01), human endothelial cells (8.9 ± 2.3-fold; p < 0.01), HeLa cells (4.71 ± 2.6-fold; p < 0.05), SOL8 myoblasts (+24.0 ± 13.0-fold; p < 0.001) and NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (+9.6 ± 4.6-fold; p < 0.05; data not shown). Thus, glucose-mediated regulation of thioredoxin through Txnip appears to be a ubiquitous mechanism. Overexpression of Txnip using adenoviral gene transfer resulted in increased cellular levels of ROS at 10 mm glucose (+68.8 ± 32.9% versus AdGFP-infected cells; p < 0.01) and at 25 mm glucose (+95.8 ± 15.1% versus AdGFP-infected cells; p < 0.001). In contrast, overexpression of thioredoxin strongly inhibited the increase in ROS at both 10 and 25 mm glucose (Fig. 1E). These findings are consistent with previous reports showing the functional effects of adenoviral gene transfer of Txnip and thioredoxin (13Wang Y. De Keulenaer G.W. Lee R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26496-26500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 14Schulze P.C. De Keulenaer G.W. Yoshioka J. Kassik K.A. Lee R.T. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Txnip results in increased protein levels of Txnip (>30-fold) and functional inhibition of thioredoxin activity by 61 ± 23%. In turn, adenoviral gene transfer of thioredoxin increases thioredoxin protein levels (>20-fold) and thioredoxin activity by 270 ± 40% (14Schulze P.C. De Keulenaer G.W. Yoshioka J. Kassik K.A. Lee R.T. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Txnip gene knockdown induced through post-transcriptional interference of specifically designed Txnip RNAi (Fig. 1F) inhibited the hyperglycemia-induced reduction of thioredoxin activity (96.6 ± 15.3% of base-line activity in cell transfected with Txnip RNAi versus 58.4 ± 19.3% in cells transfected with scrambled RNAi under 25 mm glucose; p < 0.05; Fig. 1G). Furthermore, gene knockdown of Txnip reduced the glucose-induced increase in oxidative stress by 27.4 ± 1.1% under 10 mm glucose and by 35.8 ± 9.8% under 25 mm glucose compared with controls (both p < 0.05 versus scrambled RNAi) without significant differences at base line (Fig. 1H). These findings support the specific inhibition of the thioredoxin antioxidative system in hyperglycemia through induction of Txnip, the endogenous inhibitor of thioredoxin function. Induction of Txnip in Hyperglycemia Is Mediated by p38 MAPK—We next analyzed the underlying cellular signaling mechanisms that regulate glucose-induced expression of Txnip. Incubation of aortic SMCs with hyperglycemic concentrations of glucose (25 mm) resulted in a phosphorylation of p38 MAPK after 30 min that was prevented by preincubation with the p38 MAPK inhibitor PD169316 (Fig. 2A). In addition, inhibition of p38 MAPK abolished the glucose-induced expression of Txnip mRNA (Fig. 2B) and protein (Fig. 2C). Therefore, glucose-induced activation of p38 MAPK is required for the induction of Txnip expression. Activation of PI 3-Kinase Suppresses Txnip—Further experiments revealed enhanced glucose-induced expression of Txnip in the presence of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin (31.4 ± 19.9-fold versus 14.6 ± 5.6-fold in glucose-stimulated cells; p < 0.05). No effects were detectable after incubation with the ERK inhibitor U0126, Gi inhibition by pertussis toxin, or protein kinase C (PKC) inhibition by GF109203X (data not shown). PKC activation (phorbol myristate acetate, 100 nm), a central mediator of glucose-induced cellular signaling mechanisms (17Way K.J. Katai N. King G.L. Diabet. Med. 2001; 18: 945-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), did not affect the expression of Txnip. As shown previously (18Federici M. Menghini R. Mauriello A. Hribal M.L. Ferrelli F. Lauro D. Sbraccia P. Spagnoli L.G. Sesti G. Lauro R. Circulation. 2002; 106: 466-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), incubation of SMCs with hyperglycemic levels of glucose reduced the PI 3-kinase-dependent phosphorylation status of Akt in response to stimulation with PDGF-BB (4 ng/ml) (Fig. 2D). Activation of PI 3-kinase through stimulation with PDGF-BB reduced glucose-induced expression of Txnip mRNA by 45.4 ± 16.4% (p < 0.01 versus non-stimulated cells) (Fig. 2E). Taken together, these findings indicate that the PI 3-kinase pathway inhibits Txnip expression, and its inhibition in hyperglycemia promotes the expression of Txnip. Vascular Regulation of Txnip in Diabetes Mellitus in Vivo—We next investigated the functional regulation of the thioredoxin system in an animal model of diabetes mellitus in vivo. The diabetic state was induced in adult rats through intraperitoneal injection of STZ. First, we assessed increased formation of superoxide anion in vascular samples of animals with diabetes mellitus. Superoxide anion, an intermediate product of cellular redox scavenging pathways, can be detected on frozen tissue sections by the redox-sensitive compound DHE that is oxidized to a characteristic fluorescing and DNA-interacting product (19Zhao H. Kalivendi S. Zhang H. Joseph J. Nithipatikom K. Vasquez-Vivar J. Kalyanaraman B. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2003; 34: 1359-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 20Szöcs K. Lassegue B. Sorescu D. Hilenski L.L. Valppu L. Couse T.L. Wolcox J.N. Quinn M.T. Lambeth J.D. Griendling K.K. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 21-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 21Munzel T. Afanas'ev I.B. Kleschyov A.L. Harrison D.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1761-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Although superoxide is not directly scavenged by thioredoxin, which can efficiently scavenge hydrogen peroxide, increased vascular oxidative stress has been previously documented in diabetic animals with this method (21Munzel T. Afanas'ev I.B. Kleschyov A.L. Harrison D.G. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1761-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). DHE staining revealed increased levels of superoxide in vessels from diabetic animals compared with controls (Fig. 3A). Vascular thioredoxin activity was reduced in animals with diabetes mellitus compared with controls (26.7 ± 22.6 versus 79.0 ± 44.6 ng of thioredoxin per μg of total protein; p < 0.01 versus base line) but normalized under insulin treatment (59.3 ± 1.3 ng of thioredoxin per μg of total protein; p = 0.78 versus base line; Fig. 3B). Vascular expression of Txnip increased dramatically in diabetic animals (379.7 ± 123.5% of base-line expression; p < 0.001) without changes in the expression of thioredoxin (83.8 ± 41.9% of base-line expression; p = 0.83; Fig. 3C). Normalization of serum glucose by insulin treatment reduced Txnip expression to base-line levels (81.3 ± 13.9% of base line; p = 0.79). In addition, vascular Txnip protein levels increased in diabetes mellitus and normalized with insulin treatment (Fig. 3D). Immunohistochemical analysis of vascular sections showed strong immunoreactivity for Txnip in the media of aortas from diabetic animals with no changes in thioredoxin levels (Fig. 3E). The thioredoxin system regulates cellular redox balance through the reversible oxidization of its redox-active cysteine residues (-Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys-) to form a disulfide bond that in turn is reduced by thioredoxin reductase and NADPH (11Holmgren A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 237-271Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Targeted deletion of thioredoxin causes early embryonic lethality (22Matsui M. Oshima M. Oshima H. Takaku K. Maruyama T. Yodoi J. Taketo M.M. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 179-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). The thioredoxin system compensates for a lack of glutathione reductase in Drosophila melanogaster, emphasizing the role of this system as a central and highly conserved antioxidative cellular defense mechanism (23Kanzok S.M. Fechner A. Bauer H. Ulschmid J.K. Muller H.M. Botella-Munoz J. Schneuwly S. Schirmer R. Becker K. Science. 2001; 291: 643-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, S-nitrosylation at Cys-69 is required for the anti-apoptotic and redox regulatory function of thioredoxin (24Haendeler J. Hoffmann J. Tischler V. Berk B.C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In addition, thioredoxin functions as a crucial mediator of redox-mediated transcriptional activation (25Schenk H. Klein M. Erdbrügger W. Dröge W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar, 26Hirota K. Murata M. Sachi Y. Nakamura H. Takeuchi J. Mori K. Yodoi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27891-27897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). After nuclear translocation, thioredoxin can bind by reduction of its redox-active cysteine residues to the transcriptional activator Ref-1, which in turn increases the DNA binding activity of AP-1 and also activates ribonucleotide reductase, a key enzyme in DNA synthesis (25Schenk H. Klein M. Erdbrügger W. Dröge W. Schulze-Osthoff K. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1672-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). As part of the cellular stress response, cells express and release a truncated thioredoxin isoform (10 kDa) through a non-typical secretion pathway (27Pekkari K. Avila-Carino J. Gurunath R. Bengtsson A. Scheynius A. Holmgren A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 539: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The truncated isoform has growth-inducing abilities and can act as a chemokine (27Pekkari K. Avila-Carino J. Gurunath R. Bengtsson A. Scheynius A. Holmgren A. FEBS Lett. 2003; 539: 143-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, it lacks the reducing capacity of full-length thioredoxin and does not participate in the regulation of ROS (28Tanudji M. Hevi S. Chuck S.L. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2003; 284: C1272-C1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The endogenous thioredoxin inhibitor Txnip binds to the active site of thioredoxin and inhibits thioredoxin activity (15Nishiyama A. Matsui M. Iwata S. Hirota K. Masutani H. Nakamura H. Takagi Y. Sono H. Gon Y. Yodoi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21645-21650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Txnip competes with other thioredoxin-binding proteins such as apoptosis-signaling kinase-1 (ASK1) (16Junn E. Han S.H. Im J.Y. Yang Y. Cho E.W. Um H.D. Kim D.K. Lee K.W. Han P.L. Rhee S.G. Choi I. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 6287-6295Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and inhibits the thioredoxin-mediated degradation of ASK1 through ubiquitination (29Liu Y. Min W. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1259-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), thereby sensitizing cells to apoptotic stimuli (13Wang Y. De Keulenaer G.W. Lee R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26496-26500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In addition, Txnip prevents the nuclear translocation of thioredoxin (14Schulze P.C. De Keulenaer G.W. Yoshioka J. Kassik K.A. Lee R.T. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 689-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and regulates thioredoxin-dependent transcriptional mechanisms. Txnip has been described as an intracellular protein that interacts with thioredoxin at its redox-active cysteine residues (15Nishiyama A. Matsui M. Iwata S. Hirota K. Masutani H. Nakamura H. Takagi Y. Sono H. Gon Y. Yodoi J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21645-21650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Since the thioredoxin/Txnip interaction occurs in the cytoplasm, we assume that it interacts only with thioredoxin-1. However, thioredoxin-2, the mitochondrial isoform of thioredoxin, also has the typical cysteine-containing motif, which potentially would allow the interaction with Txnip (30Spyrou G. Enmark E. Miranda-Vizuete A. Gustafsson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2936-2941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Since no data are known regarding mitochondrial localization of Txnip, we can only speculate whether this interaction can occur in living cells. Our results demonstrate the inhibition of thioredoxin activity in hyperglycemia, which can be explained by the specific induction of Txnip, the endogenous inhibitor of thioredoxin. Hyperglycemia enhances the thioredoxin/Txnip interaction leading to a functional inhibition of antioxidative thioredoxin function. This specific interaction results in a shift of the cellular redox balance that promotes increased intracellular oxidative stress. While previous reports described an increased formation of ROS (9Nishikawa T. Edelstein D. Du X.L. Yamagishi S. Matsumura T. Kaneda Y. Yorek M.A. Beebe D. Oates P.J. Hammes H.P. Giardino I. Brownlee M. Nature. 2000; 404: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3672) Google Scholar, 10Inoguchi T. Li P. Umeda F. Yu H.Y. Kakimoto M. Imamura M. Aoki T. Etoh T. Hashimoto T. Naruse M. Sano H. Utsumi H. Nawata H. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1939-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar), our findings demonstrate the functional inhibition of a central ROS-reducing cellular system in diabetes mellitus. A pivotal mechanism leading to oxidative stress in hyperglycemia is the increased formation of superoxide anion by the mitochondria (9Nishikawa T. Edelstein D. Du X.L. Yamagishi S. Matsumura T. Kaneda Y. Yorek M.A. Beebe D. Oates P.J. Hammes H.P. Giardino I. Brownlee M. Nature. 2000; 404: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3672) Google Scholar). Superoxide anion activates several major pathways of cellular damage in hyperglycemia: the polyol pathway, increased flux through the hexosamine pathway, activation of PKC, and the formation of advanced glycation end products (3Brownlee M. Nature. 2001; 414: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (7065) Google Scholar, 9Nishikawa T. Edelstein D. Du X.L. Yamagishi S. Matsumura T. Kaneda Y. Yorek M.A. Beebe D. Oates P.J. Hammes H.P. Giardino I. Brownlee M. Nature. 2000; 404: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3672) Google Scholar). Increased mitochondrial formation of superoxide anion has been attributed to increased glycolytic production of pyruvate and NADH that in turn leads to an increase of the mitochondrial proton gradient with excess production of superoxide anion (3Brownlee M. Nature. 2001; 414: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (7065) Google Scholar). It can be prevented by overexpression of uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) leading to a breakdown of the proton gradient or overexpression of superoxide dismutase leading to increased degradation of superoxide anion (9Nishikawa T. Edelstein D. Du X.L. Yamagishi S. Matsumura T. Kaneda Y. Yorek M.A. Beebe D. Oates P.J. Hammes H.P. Giardino I. Brownlee M. Nature. 2000; 404: 787-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3672) Google Scholar). The activation of PKC plays a role in the activation of the membrane-bound NADPH oxidase resulting in further increase of superoxide production (10Inoguchi T. Li P. Umeda F. Yu H.Y. Kakimoto M. Imamura M. Aoki T. Etoh T. Hashimoto T. Naruse M. Sano H. Utsumi H. Nawata H. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1939-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1273) Google Scholar). Superoxide anion is also known to interact with nitric oxide (NO) producing the highly reactive metabolite peroxynitrate that in turn leads to uncoupling of endothelial NO synthase (31Zou M.H. Shi C. Cohen R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Furthermore, uncoupling of NO synthase also occurs when this enzyme is deprived of its critical co-factor tetrahydrobiopterin or the substrate l-arginine. Uncoupling of endothelial NO synthase results in the production of molecular oxygen at the prosthetic heme site rather than formation of NO (31Zou M.H. Shi C. Cohen R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 32Landmesser U. Dikalov S. Price S.R. McCann L. Fukai T. Holland S.M. Mitch W.E. Harrison D.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 1201-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar). Based on the experimental results of the present study, additional mechanisms might also contribute to increased levels of hydrogen peroxide in hyperglycemia. Gene silencing of Txnip prevented reduction of thioredoxin activity and reduces intracellular levels of ROS in hyperglycemia. Notably, adenoviral overexpression of thioredoxin reduces hyperglycemia-induced levels of ROS, while overexpression of Txnip enhances oxidative stress. Gene knockdown of Txnip reduced the hyperglycemia-induced increase in oxidative stress compared with controls without significant differences at base line. However, hyperglycemia still increases levels of hydrogen peroxide in cells transfected with Txnip RNAi as measured by the cell-permeable and redox-sensitive compound DCFDA that interacts rather specifically with hydrogen peroxide. This increase might reflect levels of reactive oxygen species that overwhelm the scavenging capacity of the thioredoxin system even in the absence of the endogenous inhibitor Txnip. Notably, superoxide dismustase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase, all central enzymes in the antioxidative defense mechanisms of the cell, are induced under hyperglycemic conditions, most probably reflecting a counter-regulatory mechanism of the cell (33Ceriello A. dello Russo P. Amstad P. Cerutti P. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 471-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, increased levels of hydrogen peroxide that result from impaired scavenging by thioredoxin are known to inhibit the Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase activity (34Hink H.U. Santanam N. Dikalov S. McCann L. Nguyen A.D. Parthasarathy S. Harrison D.G. Fukai T. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 1402-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) and activate NADPH oxidase (35Li W.G. Miller Jr., F.J. Zhang H.J. Spitz D.R. Oberley L.W. Weintraub N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 29251-29256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). These mechanisms could in turn lead to an ambient increase of superoxide anion. Therefore, the induction of Txnip in hyperglycemia represents a unique molecular switch mechanism that results in a reduced scavenging capacity of the antioxidative thioredoxin system leading to increased oxidative stress. The PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway negatively regulates the transcriptional activation of Txnip, while activation of p38 MAPK represents a necessary step in the increased expression of Txnip in hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia inhibits activation of Akt; however, we can only speculate about the potential mechanisms of reduced activity of the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway in hyperglycemia. One possible candidate for reduced Akt activity in hyperglycemia is the mammalian homolog of Drosophila tribbles, which functions as a negative modulator of Akt (36Du K. Herzig S. Kulkarni R.N. Montminy M. Science. 2003; 300: 1574-1577Crossref PubMed Scopus (714) Google Scholar). By directly binding to Akt, TRB3 blocks the activation of this kinase. The induction of Txnip in hyperglycemia is not restricted to vascular tissue. Through transcriptional screening of glucose-induced gene expression, Txnip has been identified as one of the genes with the highest induction in response to glucose incubation in fibroblasts (37Hirota T. Okano T. Kokame K. Shirotani-Ikejima H. Miyata T. Fukada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 44244-44251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), islet cells (38Shalev A. Pise-Masison C.A. Radonovich M. Hoffmann S.C. Hirshberg B. Brady J.N. Harlan D.M. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3695-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), and mesangial cells (39Kobayashi T. Uehara S. Ikeda T. Itadani H. Kotani H. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 1632-1642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Moreover, increased renal expression of Txnip was demonstrated recently in an animal model of STZ-induced diabetes mellitus (39Kobayashi T. Uehara S. Ikeda T. Itadani H. Kotani H. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 1632-1642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The induction of Txnip by glucose seems to be a sustained effect and can be detected up to 36 h after stimulation in mesangial cells (39Kobayashi T. Uehara S. Ikeda T. Itadani H. Kotani H. Kidney Int. 2003; 64: 1632-1642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Our experimental findings suggest a direct and concentration-dependent regulation of Txnip by glucose in hyperglycemia. In addition to its ROS promoting effects leading to oxidative stress, Txnip may also play a crucial role in reducing cellular viability in hyperglycemia by sensitizing cell toward apoptosis (13Wang Y. De Keulenaer G.W. Lee R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26496-26500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Therefore, this recently discovered gene product may have diverse effects with broad pathophysiological implications in the development of end-organ damage in diabetes mellitus."
https://openalex.org/W2004336032,"The present work investigates the occurrence and significance of aberrant DNA methylation patterns during early stages of atherosclerosis. To this end, we asked whether the genetically atherosclerosis-prone APOE-null mice show any changes in DNA methylation patterns before the appearance of histologically detectable vascular lesion. We exploited a combination of various techniques: DNA fingerprinting, in vitro methyl-accepting assay, 5-methylcytosine quantitation, histone post-translational modification analysis, Southern blotting, and PCR. Our results show that alterations in DNA methylation profiles, including both hyper- and hypomethylation, were present in aortas and PBMC of 4-week-old mutant mice with no detectable atherosclerotic lesion. Sequencing and expression analysis of 60 leukocytic polymorphisms revealed that epigenetic changes involve transcribed genic sequences, as well as repeated interspersed elements. Furthermore, we showed for the first time that atherogenic lipoproteins promote global DNA hypermethylation in a human monocyte cell line. Taken together, our results unequivocally show that alterations in DNA methylation profiles are early markers of atherosclerosis in a mouse model and may play a causative role in atherogenesis.

Atherosclerosis and its complications are a major cause of death and disability in the developed world. The disease is characterized by infiltration of lipid particles in the arterial wall, accompanied by the recruitment of inflammatory and immune cells, migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMC), 1The abbreviations used are: SMC, smooth muscle cells; mC, 5-methylcytosine; CG, CpG dinucleotide; DMP, DNA methylation polymorphism; HPCE, high performance capillary electrophoresis; MSAP, methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism; SAM, S-adenosyl methionine; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; WDMP, wild type DNA methylation polymorphism; MDMP, mutant DNA methylation polymorphism; UK, United Kingdom; EST, expressed sequence tag; WT, wild type; LDL, low density lipoprotein; VLDL, very low density lipoprotein; HDL, high density lipoprotein; HL, high VLDL + LDL mixture; WL, low VLDL + LDL mixture. and synthesis of extracellular matrix. These processes eventually result in the gradual development of an elevated lipid-rich, fibrocellular lesion (1Ross R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (19370) Google Scholar). In mammals, DNA methyltransferases use S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) as a methyl group donor to methylate the carbon in position 5 of cytosine residues in a CpG dinucleotide (CG) context (2Jeltsch A. Chem. Bio. Chem. 2002; 3: 274-293Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA methylation regulates fundamental biological phenomena such as gene expression, genome stability, mutation rate, genomic imprinting, and X chromosome inactivation (3Chen R.Z. Pettersson U. Beard C. Jackson-Grusby L. Jaenisch R. Nature. 1998; 395: 89-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar, 4Li E. Nat. Rev.

Bustin M. Cedar H. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Both global and gene-specific alterations in DNA methylation are associated with abnormal phenotypes in disease (7Issa J.-P. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 2388S-2392SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Feinberg A.P. Tycko B. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar). For example, cancer cells show global genomic hypomethylation and dense hypermethylation of CpG islands, which are normally unmethylated (9Esteller M. Herman J.G. J. Pathol. 2002; 196: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). The identification of cancer type- and stage-specific changes in DNA methylation has justified hopes for novel diagnostic and therapeutic avenues (10Laird P.W. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 253-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1283) Google Scholar). Two general observations suggest that alterations in DNA methylation patterns are involved in atherogenesis (11Newman P.E. Med. Hypotheses. 1999; 53: 421-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 12Dong C. Yoon W. Goldschmidt-Clermont P.J. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 2406S-2409SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hiltunen M.O. Ylä-Herttuala S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2003; 23: 1750-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). First, global hypomethylation and dense hypermethylation of certain CpG islands are associated with aging, a major risk factor for atherosclerosis (14Issa J.-P. Crit. Rev. Oncol. Hematol. 1999; 32: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Second, hyperhomocysteinemia and the subsequent decreased production or bioavailability of SAM is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (15Brattström L. Wilcken D.E.L. Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 2000; 72: 315-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Accordingly, mice with genetically reduced levels of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, a key enzyme in the pathway generating SAM, show hyperhomocysteinemia, DNA hypomethylation, and aortic lipid infiltrations (16Chen Z. Karaplis A.C. Ackerman S.L. Pogribny I.P. Melnyk S. Lussier-Cacan S. Chen M.F. Pai A. John S.W.M. Smith R.S. Bottiglieri T. Bagley P. Selhub J. Rudnicki M.A. James S.J. Rozen R. Hum. Mol. Gen. 2001; 10: 433-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a global DNA hypomethylation has been observed in vascular lesions and leukocytes of atherosclerosis patients and proliferating SMC in animal models (17Laukkanen M.O. Mannermaa S. Hiltunen M.O. Aittomäki S. Airenne K. Jänne J. Ylä-Herttuala S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 2171-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 18Hiltunen M.O. Turunen M.P.

One unresolved issue is whether DNA methylation patterns are altered at early stages of atherosclerosis and are associated with susceptibility to the disease. Answers to these questions may have important implications for prevention and therapy of atherosclerosis. We therefore asked whether changes in DNA methylation patterns occur prior to the appearance of any vascular lesions in PBMC and aorta of mice lacking APOE, compared with matched WT animals (20Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). Moreover, in an attempt to provide a mechanism for the changes in DNA methylation patterns observed in vivo, we asked whether atherogenic lipoprotein profiles could affect DNA methylation and histone post-translational modifications in the human monocyte-macrophage cell line THP-1 (21Auverx J. Experientia (Basel). 1991; 47: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). The present study is the first analysis of DNA methylation at early stages of atherosclerosis and the first description of genomic DNA sequences undergoing epigenetic changes in a mouse model. The implications of our findings for understanding human atherosclerosis are discussed. Animal Work and Tissue Manipulation—All procedures used in this study were approved by the local ethical committee (Malmö/Lunds Djurförsöksetiska Nämnd, license M89-01). Apoe nullizygous mice (Apoe–/–) of the strain created in the laboratory of N. Maeda (20Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar) were purchased from M&B (Ry, Denmark) and were at the 10th generation of breeding on to the C57BL/6 genetic background. Four-week- and 6-month-old Apoe–/– or C57BL/6 control mice were sacrificed and dissected following overnight fasting. Dissections were performed according to anatomic maps of the mouse (22Popesko P. Rajtova V. Horak J. A Colour Atlas of Anatomy of Small Laboratory Animals. 2. Wolfe Publishing, London, United Kingdom1992: 105-166Google Scholar). The aortic tissue used in this study included the thoracic portion from the middle of the aortic arch and the abdominal portion to the iliac bifurcation. The initial portion of the ascending aorta was used to assess the presence of fatty lesions as described (23Zaina S. Pettersson L. Ahrén B. Brånén L. Hassan A.B. Lindholm M. Mattsson R. Thyberg J. Nilsson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4505-4511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). PBMC were isolated by Ficoll-Paque PLUS gradient according to the instructions from the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom (UK)). Skeletal muscle tissue was dissected from the pelvic limb. Genomic DNA or total RNA were extracted by using the DNeasy or RNeasy system (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), respectively, according to manufacturer instructions. The levels of plasma cholesterol and triglycerides were measured as described (23Zaina S. Pettersson L. Ahrén B. Brånén L. Hassan A.B. Lindholm M. Mattsson R. Thyberg J. Nilsson J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 4505-4511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Methylation-sensitive Amplified Polymorphism (MSAP) Analysis— DNA methylation profiles were analyzed by the MSAP as reported (24Reina-Lopez G.E. Simpson J. Ruiz-Herrera J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 253: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Restriction Digest of Genomic DNA and Attachment of Adaptors—All enzymes used in the MSAP protocol were provided by New England Biolabs (Hertfordshire, UK). Five hundred nanograms of genomic DNA were digested for 1 h with 20 units of HpaII and EcoRI using NEB buffer 1 in a 30-μl reaction volume. Subsequently, the restriction digest and ligation reactions were carried out simultaneously for an additional 3 h in a final volume of 40 μl. The restriction-ligation mix contained 10 units of HpaII, 10 units of EcoRI, 10 units of T4 DNA ligase, 5 pmol EcoRI adaptor, 50 pmol HpaII adaptor and 1 mm ATP. The enzymes were inactivated for 15 min at 65 °C, and a second digest was performed for 1 h with 5 units of HpaII and EcoRI, again followed by heat inactivation. The adaptor sequences were as follows: EcoRI adaptor, 5′-CTCGTAGACTGCGTACC-3′ and 5′-AATTGGTACGCAGTCTAC-3; HpaII adaptor, 5′-GATCATGAGTCCTGCT-3′ and 5′-CGAGCAGGACTCATGA-3′. Preamplification—The preamplification reaction was performed with primers complementary to the core of the adaptor sequences and the target sequence of EcoRI and HpaII restriction enzymes. The sequences of the EcoRI preselective primer (EcoRI-00) and the HpaII preselective primers (HpaII-00) were 5′-AGACTGCGTACCAATTC-3′ and 5′-TCATGAGTCCTGCTCGG-3′, respectively. Two microliters of the digestion-ligation mix (diluted 1:3) were added to the pre-amplification mix consisting of 1× PCR Buffer, 0.1 mm dNTP, 50 ng of EcoRI-00 primer, 50 ng of HpaII-00 primer, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Roche Biochemicals). The PCR conditions were as follows: 72 °C for 2 min, 94 °C for 3 min, followed by 25 cycles as follows: 95 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min. A final extension was performed at 72 °C for 4 min. Selective Amplification—The sequence of the selective primers was identical to the preselective primers but included the addition of a number of nucleotides at the 3′ terminus. The selective nucleotides of the EcoRI-00 primer were as follows: EcoRI-01, AGT; EcoRI-02, ACA; EcoRI-03, AGA; and EcoRI-04, ACC. The HpaII selective primers were: HpaII-01, TCCA; HpaII-02, TAGC; HpaII-03, CGAA; HpaII-03A, CGTT; HpaII-04, AATT; and HpaII-04A, AACC. Selective PCR was conducted using 2 μl of pre-amplification mix (diluted 1:10) in a 10-μl reaction volume containing 1× PCR Buffer, 0.1 mm dNTP, 50 ng of EcoRI-00 primer, 50 ng of 33P-labeled HpaII-00 primer, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase. The HpaII primer was end-labeled by incubating 50 ng of primer with 50 μCi of [γ-33P]dATP, 10 units of polynucleotide kinase and 5 μl of 1× OPA buffer (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK). The reaction was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, followed by heat inactivation for 15 min at 65 °C. The PCR cycle employed was a standard amplified fragment length polymorphism touchdown protocol (25Vos P. Hogers R. Bleeker M. Reijans M. van de Lee T. Hornes M. Frijters A. Pot J. Peleman J. Kuiper M. Zabeau M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4407-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (10559) Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis—The PCR samples were mixed 1:1 (v/v) with denaturating buffer (98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 0.1% xylene cyanol) and separated on 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel (Bio-Rad) for 3 h at 90 watts. Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film (BioMax, Eastman Kodak Co.) for 1–4 days at –80 °C. For each experiment, two or three independent MSAP reactions, each corresponding to pooled samples from three or four mice, were performed. If the results were reproducible, one sample was used for further analysis. Quantitative analyses of band patterns were conducted on central portions of gels, where resolution was maximal. SssI Methyl-accepting Assay—The assay was performed as previously described (26Schmitt F. Oakeley E.J. Jost J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1534-1540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), with the exception that Nonidet P-40 was replaced with Triton and labeled DNA was blotted on a Nytran SuPerCharge membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany). Isolation and Sequencing of MSAP Bands—Bands were excised from acrylamide gels, suspended in 30 μlof0.5× TE buffer, and incubated for 10 min at 65 °C. One microliter of the solution was used in a standard PCR reaction with the appropriate primer combinations. The resulting fragments were cloned in the pCR®II-TOPO® vector (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), and three independent clones were sequenced. Homology searches were conducted using NIX software (www.hgmp.mrc.ac.uk). The CpG ratio was calculated by dividing the number of observed CG dinucleotides by their expected number, calculated with the formula (number of cytosines)(number of guanines)/(total number of nucleotides). Southern Blotting and Methylation-sensitive PCR Analysis of DMR— Fifteen micrograms of genomic DNA were digested overnight with the appropriate restriction enzyme, blotted, and probed with selected labeled MSAP fragments. Hybridization was conducted by using the ULTRAhyb™ system according to instructions from the manufacturer (Ambion, Huntingdon, UK). Selected fragments for which flanking sequences could be deduced from data base matches were analyzed by methylation-sensitive PCR (27Santourlidis S. Florl A. Ackermann R. Wirtz H.-C. Schulz W.A. The Prostate. 1999; 39: 166-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Two hundred nanograms of DNA was amplified with the following fragment-specific primers. Fragment sz44 consisted of internal primer, 5′-TAGCAGAGACCTAGAAGAGGG-3′ (forward); and flanking primer, 5′-TTCAAAAGTTGCCTCAAGTCC-3′ (reverse), corresponding to nucleotides 70314–70294 of sequence with accession no. AC103664. Fragment M54 consisted of internal primer, 5′-TGTGTTTTCCTCTCTTAGCCC-3′ (forward); and flanking primer, 5′-TTCTCAGCCATTCGGTATTCC-3′ (reverse), corresponding to nucleotides 86183–86163 of sequence with accession no. AC120437. Fragment M4 consisted of internal primer, 5′-AGTGCCTGTGATCCTTACCTG-3′ (forward); and flanking primer, 5′-AAAGCTCAGAGTAGAAAAGGG-3′ (reverse), corresponding to nucleotides 194754–194774 of sequence with accession no. AC132863. Conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 1 min; followed by 35 cycles at 94, 51, and 72 °C, each for 1 min; and a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. Predicted PCR fragments were sz44, 399 bp; M54, 327 bp; and M4, 282 bp. Expression Analysis by Reverse Transcription-PCR—Expression analysis of leukocytic MSAP polymorphic fragments showing homology to EST or genomic sequences (see “Results”) was conducted by using fragment-specific nested primers. Gapdh RNA was amplified as an internal control (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). Primer identity and PCR conditions are available upon request. Southern Blotting Analysis of LINE-1 Elements—A 548-bp probe spanning a conserved 5′ region sequence in mouse LINE-1 elements (28Furano A.V. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2000; 64: 255-294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was constructed by subjecting mouse tail genomic DNA to PCR with the primers 5′-ATCTTGGTTCGGGACCCGCCGAACTTAGG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GTTTACCTTTCGCCATCTGGTAATCTCTGG-3′ (reverse). Conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 1 min; followed by 35 cycles at 94, 60, and 72 °C, each for 1 min; and a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. The probe was sequenced and used in Southern blotting as indicated in the previous paragraph. Cell Culture and Lipoprotein Isolation—Human THP-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with fetal calf serum (10%), glutamine (4 mm), penicillin (20 IU/ml), and streptomycin (20 μg/ml). Cells were either used as monocytes or differentiated to macrophages by incubation with phorbol myristate acetate (50 ng/ml) for 4 days with change of medium every second day. For experiments, both monocytes and macrophages were incubated for 24 h in serum-free media with lipoprotein additions as indicated under “Results.” Lipoproteins were prepared by differential ultracentrifugation of fresh plasma from healthy donors (29Lindholm M. Sjoblom L. Nordborg C. Ostlund-Lindqvist A.M. Eklund A. Ann. Nutr. Metab. 1993; 37: 302-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Quantification of Total 5-Methylcytosine by High Performance Capillary Electrophoresis (HPCE)—Quantification of the degree of methylation was carried out as previously described (30Fraga M.F. Uriol E. Borja Diego L. Berdasco M. Esteller M. Canal M.J. Rodríguez R. Electrophoresis. 2002; 23: 1677-1681Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 31Ballestar E. Paz M.F. Valle L. Wei S. Fraga M.F. Espada J. Cigudosa J.C. Huang T.H. Esteller M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 6335-6345Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Briefly, genomic DNA (3–5 μg) was obtained by standard procedures and DNA hydrolysis was carried out with 1.25 μl (200 units/ml) of nuclease P1 for 16 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, alkaline phosphatase was added and mixtures were incubated for an additional 2 h at 37 °C. Hydrolyzed samples were injected under pressure (0.3 p.s.i.) for 3 s into an uncoated fused-silica capillary in a CE system (P/AC™ MDQ, Beckman-Coulter). Quantification of the relative methylation of each DNA sample was determined as the percentage of 5-methylcytosine (mC) of total cytosines: mC peak area × 100/(C peak area + mC peak area). All samples were analyzed in duplicate, and three analytical measurements were made per replicate. Quantification of Whole Histone H4 Acetylation and Methylation of Lysine 20 by HPCE—Quantification of acetylation and methylation at lysine 20 of histone H4 was done by a modification of the method previously described (32Lindner H. Helliger W. Dirschlmayer A. Talasz H. Wurm M. Sarg B. Jaquemar M. Puschendorf B. J. Chromatogr. 1992; 608: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Individual histone fractions were obtained from cell nuclei (33Goodwin G.H. Nicolas R.H. Johns E.W. Biochem. J. 1977; 167: 485-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), and further purified by reversed-phase HPLC (34Gurley L.R. Prentice D.A. Valdez J.G. Spall W.D. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 131: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The non-, mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-acetylated forms of histones H3 and H4 and trimethylated H4 at lysine 20 were resolved by HPCE, using an uncoated fused-silica capillary (Beckman-Coulter™) (60.2 cm × 75 mm, effective length 50 cm) in a CE system (P/ACE™ MDQ, Beckman-Coulter™). The running buffer was 100 mm phosphate buffer, pH 2.0, containing 0.02% (w/v) HPM-cellulose. Running conditions were 25 °C and operating voltages of 12 kV. On-column absorbance was monitored at 214 nm. Before each run, the capillary system was conditioned by washing with 0.1 m NaOH for 3 min, and with 0.5 m H2SO4 for 2 min, and equilibrated with running buffer for 3 min. Buffers and washing solutions were prepared with Milli-Q water and filtered throughout 0.45-μm filters. Samples were injected under pressure (0.3 p.s.i.) for 3 s. All samples were analyzed in duplicate, and three analytical measurements were made per replicate. Statistics—Comparisons were made by using nonparametric tests in the StatView (Abacus Concept, Berkeley, CA) or Statistica (StatSoft, Tulsa, OK) program for Macintosh. The counts of DNA methylation polymorphic bands were compared in samples paired by selective primer, using the Wilcoxon paired test. In all other cases, tests are specified under “Results.” Changes in PBMC and Aortic DNA Methylation Profiles Precede Fibrocellular Vascular Lesions in Apoe–/– Mice—To study DNA methylation patterns during the progression of atherosclerosis, 4-week-old and 6-month-old APOE-null (Apoe–/–) were used. Mice were fed normal rodent diet, to exclude any confounding contribution of dietary factors potentially affecting DNA methylation (35Friso S. Choi S.-W. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 2382S-2387SCrossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the age of 4 weeks, mutant mice were hypercholesterolemic but lacked any detectable fatty streak or fibrocellular lesions at the ascending aorta or at the aortic arch (Fig. 1, A and B). By contrast, lesions consisting of a fibrocellular intima and a lipid-rich core were detectable in the same portion of the aortic vessel in 6-month-old Apoe–/– mice as previously reported (Fig. 1, C and D) (20Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). Plasma total cholesterol was markedly elevated in Apoe–/– mice of both age groups, relative to WT controls (Fig. 1, compare A and C with B and D) (20Zhang S.H. Reddick R.L. Piedrahita J.A. Maeda N. Science. 1992; 258: 468-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1849) Google Scholar). To screen PBMC for DNA methylation polymorphisms (DMPs) between Apoe–/– mice and matched controls, we exploited the MSAP fingerprinting technique. This technique is a modification of amplified fragment length polymorphism, a procedure that is based on random amplification of restriction fragments typically generated by digestion of genomic DNA with the EcoRI and MseI restriction enzymes (25Vos P. Hogers R. Bleeker M. Reijans M. van de Lee T. Hornes M. Frijters A. Pot J. Peleman J. Kuiper M. Zabeau M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4407-4414Crossref PubMed Scopus (10559) Google Scholar). In MSAP, MseI is replaced by the methylation-sensitive enzyme HpaII, blocked by methylation at either cytosine residue in the recognition site 5′-CCGG-3′ (24Reina-Lopez G.E. Simpson J. Ruiz-Herrera J. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 253: 703-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Following digestion of genomic DNA, adaptors are attached to restriction sites that have been successfully digested. It follows that the products of the MSAP ligation reaction consist of DNA fragments that are flanked by hypomethylated HpaII and EcoRI sites. Thereafter, two consecutive PCR reactions, a preamplification and a selective amplification, are performed to enrich a subpopulation of the restriction fragments. The primers employed are complementary to the core sequence of adaptors and recognition sites of the restriction enzymes, and the number of nucleotides added to their 3′ terminus determines their selectivity. Typically the number of selective nucleotides is increased in the selective amplification, where one of the two primers is radioactively labeled. This enables the visualization of a subset of restriction fragments by autoradiography following acrylamide gel electrophoresis. PBMC DNA was screened by MSAP, using 23 different combinations of selective primers, corresponding to a total of ∼1,600 bands/genotype group. Parallel MSAP analyses were conducted with MspI, an isoschizomer of HpaII that is only sensitive to methylation at the external cytosine (methylation at CNG trinucleotide) on one or both strands (methylation on one strand only is referred to as hemimethylation). It follows that an HpaII polymorphism between WT and Apoe–/– samples can be attributed to differential CG methylation, if the corresponding MspI profile is monomorphic, i.e. either present or absent in both genotypes (Fig. 2A). In the latter case, the HpaII site is hemimethylated at the external cytosine in both genotypes (lower bands in Fig. 2A) (36McClelland M. Nelson M. Raschke E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3640-3659Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Alternatively, absence of MspI fragments may result from inefficient amplification of the more complex MspI amplicons, relative to HpaII products. Nonetheless, the stability of MspI profiles observed throughout our study argues against this hypothesis. A polymorphism detected with both HpaII and MspI digestion is indicative of CNG methylation or mutation at the targeted Apoe alleles or elsewhere (Fig. 2B). The analysis revealed that polymorphisms were present at both 4 weeks and 6 months of age (Fig. 3). Although DMPs may contain internal hypermethylated HpaII or EcoRI sites, previous analyses revealed that the vast majority of MSAP products represent HpaII-EcoRI fragments that lack any internal HpaII or EcoRI site (37Lauria M. Rupe M. Guo M. Kranz E. Pirona R. Viotti A. Lund G. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 510-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Accordingly, in the present study, only 5% of the sequenced MSAP fragments (see below) contained an internal HpaII site and none contained any EcoRI site. This implies that hypermethylation of internal fragment sites affects only marginally, if at all, the assessment of genome methylation status by MSAP band scoring. Two hundred and eight of the 206 polymorphisms observed at 4 weeks and 6 months (counting polymorphisms that are common to both ages only once) represented changes in CG methylation, e.g. genuine DMPs (Fig. 3, A and B), whereas only one band represented a difference in CNG methylation or a mutation (Fig. 3C). The total number of DMPs in 4-week-old PBMC was 48, or 3.2% of total bands. A similar analysis conducted on 6-month-old mice revealed that the total number of DMPs was increased by 3.8-fold to 185, or 11% of total bands, compared with the younger age group (p < 0.002). DMPs that were present in both age groups represented a substantial part of all DMPs at 4 weeks (27 of 48, or 56%), but were a minority at 6 months (15%). An identical MSAP analysis was conducted on aortic DNA, using 14 selective primer combinations, producing a total of ∼1,000 bands. Aortic DMPs showed a markedly different distribution, in comparison with PBMC DNA. The total number of DMPs showed little or no increase with age, being 76 and 83 (or 7.6% and 8.3% of total bands) at 4 weeks and 6 months, respectively. Furthermore, approximately one third of DMPs were conserved in both age groups. The comparison of PBMC and aortic MSAP analyses revealed that few DMPs were common to the PBMC and the aorta (2 of 137 total aortic DMPs at 4 weeks and 6 months, counting polymorphisms that are common to both ages only once). Further MSAP analysis was conducted on pericardial fat and liver of 6-month-old mice by using six primer combinations. In these tissues, the frequency of DMPs was severalfold lower than in matched PBMC and aorta (i.e. 0.5–1% of total bands; p < 0.03 in all comparisons). This indicates that the bulk of DMPs observed in Apoe–/– mice from the age of 4 weeks on represented genotype-related and tissue-specific, rather than reflecting inter- or intra-individual epigenetic variations that are unrelated to the Apoe genotype (see, for example, Ref. 38Yatabe Y. Tavaré S. Shibata D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10839-10844Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Hypo- and Hypermethylation in Apoe–/– Mice—A DMP that is characterized by a band specifically present in Apoe–/– mutant (MDMP) or WT (WDMP) mice, implies hypo- or hypermethylation at the flanking HpaII site, respectively, in Apoe–/– mice compared with WT. Previous comparisons of parallel results obtained with MSAP and direct quantitation of mC by HPCE, established tha"

Adherence to host constituents plays an important role in this process. Two members of the C. albicans Als protein family (Als1p and Als5p) have been found to mediate adherence; however, the functions of other members of this family are unknown. In this study, members of the ALS gene family were cloned and expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to characterize their individual functions. Distinct Als proteins conferred distinct adherence profiles to diverse host substrates. Using chimeric Als5p-Als6p constructs, the regions mediating substrate-specific adherence were localized to the N-terminal domains in Als proteins. Interestingly, a subset of Als proteins also mediated endothelial cell invasion, a previously unknown function of this family. Consistent with these results, homology modeling revealed that Als members contain anti-parallel β-sheet motifs interposed by extended regions, homologous to adhesins or invasins of the immunoglobulin superfamily. This finding was confirmed using circular dichroism and Fourier transform infrared spectrometric analysis of the N-terminal domain of Als1p. Specific regions of amino acid hypervariability were found among the N-terminal domains of Als proteins, and energy-based models predicted similarities and differences in the N-terminal domains that probably govern the diverse function of Als family members. Collectively, these results indicate that the structural and functional diversity within the Als family provides C. albicans with an array of cell wall proteins capable of recognizing and interacting with a wide range of host constituents during infection.

Collectively, these results indicate that the structural and functional diversity within the Als family provides C. albicans with an array of cell wall proteins capable of recognizing and interacting with a wide range of host constituents during infection. Candida albicans is the most common fungal pathogen in humans (1Edwards Jr., J.E. Mandell G.L. Bennett J.E. Dolin R. Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett's Principals and Practice of Infectious Diseases. 5th Ed. Chuchill Livingston, Philadelphia2000: 2656-2674Google Scholar, 2Edmond M.B. Wallace S.E. McClish D.K. Pfaller M.A. Jones R.N. Wenzel R.P. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1999; 29: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). While normally a harmless commensal, this organism can cause a variety of conditions ranging from superficial mucocutaneous infection to deep organ involvement in disseminated candidiasis (1Edwards Jr., J.E. Mandell G.L. Bennett J.E. Dolin R. Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett's Principals and Practice of Infectious Diseases. 5th Ed. Chuchill Livingston, Philadelphia2000: 2656-2674Google Scholar). Prior to causing disease, the fungus colonizes the gastrointestinal tract, and in some cases skin and mucous membranes. Adherence to host mucosal surfaces is a key prerequisite for this initial step (3Klotz S.A. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1992; 14: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). After colonization, C. albicans enters the bloodstream via infected intravascular devices or by transmigration through gastrointestinal mucosa compromised by chemotherapy or stress ulcerations (1Edwards Jr., J.E. Mandell G.L. Bennett J.E. Dolin R. Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett's Principals and Practice of Infectious Diseases. 5th Ed. Chuchill Livingston, Philadelphia2000: 2656-2674Google Scholar). Organisms then disseminate via the bloodstream, bind to and penetrate the vascular endothelium to egress from the vascular tree, and invade deep organs such as liver, spleen, and kidney (3Klotz S.A. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1992; 14: 340-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Thus, C. albicans must be capable of adhering to a variety of biological substrates at different stages of infection. There is abundant experimental evidence to support the role of adherence in candidal virulence. Initial observations noted a correlation between the degree of endothelial cell adherence and virulence of different yeast species (4Rotrosen D. Calderone R.A. Edwards Jr., J.E. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1986; 8: 73-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). More recently, several adhesins of C. albicans have been isolated and characterized (5Staab J.F. Bradway S.D. Fidel P.L. Sundstrom P.

Klotz S.A. Henderson R.L. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6040-6047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutants deficient in the genes encoding these adhesins not only exhibit decreased adherence to host substrates in vitro but also a corresponding reduction in virulence in several experimental models of C. albicans infection (6Tsuchimori N.

The extent of these reductions has been quite variable, probably due to the actions of other adhesins with redundant or overlapping function. Previously, we isolated and characterized the C. albicans ALS1 gene by heterologous complementation of nonadherent Saccharomyces cerevisiae (9Fu Y. Rieg G. Fonzi W.A. Belanger P.H. Edwards Jr., J.E. Filler S.G. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 1783-1786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ALS1 encodes a cell surface protein that mediates adherence to endothelial and epithelial cells. Disruption of both copies of this gene in C. albicans is associated with a 35% reduction in adherence to endothelial cells, and overexpression of ALS1 increases adherence by 125% (8Fu Y. Ibrahim A.S. Sheppard D.C. Chen Y.C. French S.W. Cutler J.E. Filler S.G. Edwards Jr., J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). ALS1 is a member of a large C. albicans gene family consisting of at least eight members originally described by Hoyer et al. (15Hoyer L.L. Trends Microbiol. 2001; 9: 176-180Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar, 16Zhao X. Pujol C. Soll D.R. Hoyer L.L. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 2947-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These genes encode cell surface proteins that are characterized by three domains. The N-terminal region contains a putative signal peptide and is relatively conserved among Als proteins. This region is predicted to be poorly glycosylated (16Zhao X. Pujol C. Soll D.R. Hoyer L.L. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 2947-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17Hoyer L.L. Fundyga R. Hecht J.E. Kapteyn J.C. Klis F.M. Arnold J. Genetics. 2001; 157: 1555-1567PubMed Google Scholar). The central portion of these proteins consists of a variable number of tandem repeats (∼36 amino acids in length) and is followed by a serine-threonine-rich C-terminal region that contains a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor sequence (16Zhao X. Pujol C. Soll D.R. Hoyer L.L. Microbiology. 2003; 149: 2947-2960Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 17Hoyer L.L. Fundyga R. Hecht J.E. Kapteyn J.C. Klis F.M. Arnold J. Genetics. 2001; 157: 1555-1567PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas the proteins encoded by this gene family are known to be expressed during infection (18Hoyer L.L. Clevenger J. Hecht J.E. Ehrhart E.J. Poulet F.M. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 4251-4255Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Zhang N. Harrex A.L. Holland B.R. Fenton L.E. Cannon R.D. Schmid J. Genome Res. 2003; 13: 2005-2017Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the function of the different Als proteins has not been investigated in detail. We therefore used heterologous expression of Als proteins in nonadherent S. cerevisiae to evaluate the function of Als proteins in isolation and to avoid the high background adherence mediated by the multiple other adhesins expressed by C. albicans. This heterologous expression system has been used extensively for the study of C. albicans genes, including the isolation and characterization of the adhesins ALS1, ALS5, and EAP1 (7Li F. Palecek S.P. Eukaryot. Cell. 2003; 2: 1266-1273Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 9Fu Y. Rieg G. Fonzi W.A. Belanger P.H. Edwards Jr., J.E. Filler S.G. Infect.

Using this model system, we demonstrated that Als proteins have diverse adhesive and invasive functions. Consistent with these results, homology modeling indicated that Als proteins are closely related in structure to adhesin and invasin members of the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins. Structural analyses using CD and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) 1The abbreviations used are: FTIR, Fourier transform infrared; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; CR, conserved region; HVR, hypervariable region.1The abbreviations used are: FTIR, Fourier transform infrared; HBSS, Hanks' balanced salt solution; CR, conserved region; HVR, hypervariable region. spectrometry confirmed that the N-terminal domain of Als1p is composed of anti-parallel β sheet, turn, α-helical, and unstructured domains consistent with the structures of other members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Finally, comparative energy-based models suggest differences in key physicochemical properties of the N-terminal domains among different Als proteins that may govern their distinct adherence and invasive biological functions. S. cerevisiae strain S150-2B (leu2 his3 trp1 ura3) was used for heterologous expression and has been described previously (20Fu Y. Filler S.G. Spellberg B.J. Fonzi W. Ibrahim A.S. Kanbe T. Ghannoum M.A. Edwards Jr., J.E. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2078-2084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). C. albicans strain SC5314 was used for genomic cloning. All strains were grown in minimal defined medium (1× yeast nitrogen base broth (Difco), 2% glucose, and 0.5% ammonium sulfate, supplemented with 100 μg/ml l-leucine, l-tryptophan, l-histidine, and adenine sulfate) solidified with 1.5% bacto-agar (Difco) as needed. Growth of ura-strains was supported by the addition of 80 μg/ml uridine (Sigma). Plasmids pGK103, containing ALS5, pYF5, containing ALS1, and pALSn, containing ALS9, have been described previously (9Fu Y. Rieg G. Fonzi W.A. Belanger P.H. Edwards Jr., J.E. Filler S.G. Infect.

The FaDu oral epithelial cell line, isolated from a pharyngeal carcinoma, was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained as per their recommended protocol. Endothelial cells were isolated from umbilical cord veins and maintained by our previously described modification of the method of Jaffe et al. (8Fu Y. Ibrahim A.S. Sheppard D.C. Chen Y.C.

Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (5968) Google Scholar). All cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified environment containing 5% CO2. The genomic sequences of members of the ALS family were identified by BLAST searching of the Stanford data base (available on the World Wide Web at www-sequence.stanford.edu/group/candida/search.html). PCR primers were generated to specifically amplify each of the open reading frames that incorporated a 5′ BglII and a 3′ XhoI restriction enzyme site (Table I). Each gene was cloned by PCR using the Expand® High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science). ALS3, ALS6, and ALS7 were amplified from C. albicans SC5314 genomic DNA, whereas ALS1, ALS5, and ALS9 were amplified from plasmids that had been previously retrieved from C. albicans genomic libraries (9Fu Y.

PCR products were ligated into pGEM-T-Easy (Promega) for sequencing. Sequence-verified ALS open reading frames were then released from pGEM-T-Easy by BglII-XhoI co-digestion and ligated into pADH1, such that the ALS gene of interest was under the control of the ADH1 promoter. S. cerevisiae strain S150-2B was transformed with each of the ALS overexpression constructs as well as the empty pADH1 construct using the lithium acetate method. Expression of each ALS gene in S. cerevisiae was verified by Northern blot analysis before phenotypic analyses were performed.Table IPCR primers used to amplify the coding regions of ALS genes for heterologous expression in S. cerevisiaeALS geneSense (5′–3′)Antisense (5′–3′)ALS1AGATCTCAGATGCTTCAACAATTTACATTGCTCGAGTCACTAAATGAACAAGGACAATAALS3GAAGATCTATGCTACAACAATATACATTGTTACTCCCGCTCGAGTTAAATAAACAAGGATAATAATGTGATCALS5AGATCTCAACTACCAACTGCTAACACTCGAGACCATATTATTTGGTACAATCALS6AGATCTCATTCACCGACAATGAAGACACTCGAGTTGGTACAATCCCGTTTGAALS7AGATCTTCAACAGTCTAATACCTATGACTCGAGACTTGATTGAATTATACCATATAALS9AGATCTCGAATGCTACCACAATTCCTACTCGAGTCTTAGCACCCTGACGTAGCT Open table in a new tab To confirm the cell surface expression of each of the Als constructs, we performed indirect immunofluorescence using two different polyclonal anti-Als antisera. Antiserum A consisted of anti-Als1p antibodies, generated by immunization of rabbits with a 417-amino acid N-terminal fragment of Als1p. Antiserum B was rabbit anti-C. albicans mannan factor 5 that recognizes C. albicans cell wall components but does not cross-react with S. cerevisiae (Iatron Laboratories). For each strain, 107 blastospores were isolated from overnight culture, blocked with 100 μl of goat serum, and then stained with either polyclonal antiserum A or B at a 1:25 dilution, followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG at 1:100. A FACSCaliber (Becton Dickinson) instrument equipped with an argon laser emitting at 488 nm was used for flow cytometric analyses. Fluorescence emission was detected with a 515/40-nm bandpass filter. Fluorescence data for 10,000 events were collected, and the distribution of cells with fluorescence above base line (i.e. S. cerevisiae transformed with the empty plasmid) was analyzed for each strain using CELLQUEST software (Becton Dickinson). To test the hypothesis that N-terminal sequences were responsible for mediating substrate-specific adherence, we constructed chimeric Als5/Als6 proteins by exchanging the N termini of each protein. Chimeric ALS5/6 genes were constructed as follows. A BglII-HpaI fragment of ALS5 encompassing the 5′ 2117 bp of the gene was isolated. pGEM-T-ALS6 was then digested with BglII and HpaI to release the corresponding 5′ 2126 bp of ALS6, and the fragment consisting of pGEM-T-Easy plus the 3′ sequences of ALS6 was isolated and ligated to the 5′ ALS5 fragment to generate plasmid pGEM-T-5N6C. An identical approach using the corresponding 5′ fragment of ALS6 and 3′ fragment of ALS5 was used to generate plasmid p-GEM-T-6N5C. After sequence confirmation, each chimeric ALS gene was released by BglII-XhoI digestion and subcloned into pADH1 as above. S. cerevisiae S150–2B was then transformed with these constructs, and expression was verified by Northern blot analysis before characterization of their adherence properties. Six-well Plate Assay—To determine the adherence properties of transformed S. cerevisiae strains, we used a modification of our previously described adherence assay (8Fu Y. Ibrahim A.S. Sheppard D.C. Chen Y.C. French S.W. Cutler J.E. Filler S.G. Edwards Jr., J.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly, adherence plates were coated by adding 1 ml of a 0.01 mg/ml solution of gelatin (Sigma), laminin (Sigma), or fibronectin (Becton Dickinson) to each well of a 6-well tissue culture plate (Costar) and incubating overnight at 37 °C. For endothelial cells, second passage cells were grown to confluence in 6-well tissue culture plates coated with a 0.2% gelatin matrix, and for epithelial cells, FaDU cells were grown to confluence (3 days) in 6-well tissue culture plates coated with a 0.1% fibronectin matrix. Before adherence testing, wells were washed twice with 1 ml of warm Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS). S. cerevisiae strains to be tested were grown overnight in minimal defined medium at 30 °C and then harvested by centrifugation, washed with HBSS (Irvine Scientific), and enumerated using a hemacytometer. Three hundred organisms were added to each well of a 6-well tissue culture plate coated with the substrate of interest and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C in CO2. Nonadherent organisms were removed by washing twice in a standardized manner with 10 ml of HBSS. The wells were overlaid with YPD agar (1% yeast extract (Difco), 2% bacto-peptone (Difco), 2% d-glucose, 1.5% agar), and the inoculum was confirmed by quantitative culture. Plates were incubated for 48 h at 30 °C, and the colonies were counted. Adherence was expressed as a percentage of the initial inoculum. Differences in adherence were compared using a single factor analysis of variance test, with p < 0.01 considered significant. Magnetic Bead Assay—Als5p was originally identified by virtue of the protein's ability to induce agglutination of fibronectin-coated beads when expressed on the surface of S. cerevisiae (10Gaur N.K. Klotz S.A. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 5289-5294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested S. cerevisiae strains transformed with ALS5, ALS6, 5N6C, and 6N5C for fibronectin bead adherence using this methodology (10Gaur N.K. Klotz S.A. Infect. Immun. 1997; 65: 5289-5294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Gaur N.K. Klotz S.A. Henderson R.L. Infect. Immun. 1999; 67: 6040-6047Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, tosylated magnetic beads (Dynal Biotech) were coated with fibronectin following the manufacturer's instructions. Next, 10 μl of coated beads (∼106 beads) were mixed with 1 × 108 transformed S. cerevisiae in 1 ml of 1× Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer, pH 7.0, and incubated with gentle mixing for 45 min. The tubes were placed in a magnet to separate beads and adherent S. cerevisiae from nonadherent organisms. The supernatant containing nonadherent organisms was removed by aspiration, and the remaining beads were washed three times by resuspending in 1 ml of TE buffer, followed by magnetic separation and aspiration of the supernatant. Finally, the washed beads and adherent organisms were resuspended in 100 μl of TE buffer and examined microscopically for co-agglutination. The ability of Als proteins to mediate endothelial cell invasion was determined using a modification of our previously described differential fluorescence assay (24Phan Q.T. Belanger P.H. Filler S.G. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 3485-3490Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, endothelial cells were grown to confluence on 12-mm diameter glass coverslips coated with fibronectin and placed in a 24-well tissue culture plate (Corning). Cells were then infected with 105 blastospores of each S. cerevisiae strain in RPMI 1640 medium (Irvine Scientific). As a positive control, cells were infected with a similar number of C. albicans blastospores. After incubation for 90 min, the cells were rinsed twice with 0.5 ml of HBSS in a standardized manner and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde. Organisms remaining adherent to the surface of the endothelial cells were stained for 1 h with the rabbit anti-C. albicans antiserum (Biodesign), which had been conjugated with Alexa 568 (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), which fluoresces red. This antiserum cross-reacts with S. cerevisiae at a 2-fold higher dilution. The endothelial cells were then permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min, after which the cell-associated organisms (the internalized plus adherent organisms) were again stained with the anti-C. albicans antiserum conjugated with Alexa 488, which fluoresces green. The coverslips were then observed under epifluorescence. The number of organisms that had been internalized by the endothelial cells was determined by subtracting the number of adherent organisms (fluorescing red) from the number of cell-associated organisms (fluorescing green). At least 100 organisms were counted on each coverslip, and all experiments were performed in triplicate on at least three separate occasions. Homology and energy-based modeling was conducted to compare overall physicochemical features of Als proteins. First, a knowledge-based method (SWISS-MODEL) (25Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2714-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (9399) Google Scholar, 26Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4376) Google Scholar) was used to analyze and compare combinatorial extension structural alignments of structures in the Swiss and Brookhaven protein data bases for proteins with homologous conformation (27Shindyalov I.N. Bourne P.E. Protein Eng. 1998; 11: 739-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1680) Google Scholar). This approach included the BLASTP2 algorithm (28Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68368) Google Scholar) to search for primary sequence similarities in the ExNRL-3D data base. In parallel, the dynamic sequence alignment algorithm SIM (29Huang X. Miller M. Adv. Appl. Math. 1991; 12: 337-367Crossref Scopus (828) Google Scholar) was used to select candidate templates with greatest sequence identity. Subsequently, ProModII was used to conduct primary and refined match analyses. Resulting proteins were used as templates for homology modeling of Als protein backbone trajectories. Robust models of the N-terminal domains of Als proteins (e.g. amino acids 1–480; preceding initial tandem repeats) were generated through complementary approaches. The N-terminal domains of Als proteins were converted to putative solution conformations by sequence homology (Composer (30Topham C.M. Thomas P. Overington J.P. Johnson M.S. Eisenmenger F. Blundell T.L. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1990; 57: 1-9PubMed Google Scholar)) and threading methods (Matchmaker (31Godzik A. Kolinski A. Skolnick J. J. Mol.

Des. 1993; 7: 397-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)) using SYBYL 6.9.1 software (Tripos Associates) operating on Silicon Graphics workstations (SGI, Inc.). Resulting conformers and amino acid side chains of target Als domains were refined by molecular dynamics, and strain energies were minimized using the AMBER95 force field method (36Duan Y. Wu C. Chowdhury S. Lee M.C. Xiong G. Zhang W. Yang R. Cieplak P. Luo R. Lee T. Caldwell J. Wang J. Kollman P. J Comput. Chem. 2003; 24: 1999-2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (3628) Google Scholar) and the Powell minimizer (37Powell M.J.D. Math. Program. 1977; 12: 241-254Crossref Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). These approaches optimize side chain interactions where positions of the peptide backbone atoms are fixed. Preferred conformations were determined from extended molecular dynamics in aqueous solvent. Next, the torsion angles of all peptide bonds were adjusted to 180 ± 15°, with minimal constraints. In some cases, molecular dynamics were executed, either with no constraints or with α-helical regions constrained by applying a 0.4-kJ penalty to the canonical Ramachandran ϕ and Ψ angles. Final global energy minimizations were performed for each model after the removal of all constraints and aggregates. Resulting Als N-terminal domain models were prioritized based on three criteria: (i) most favorable strain energy (molecular mechanics); (ii) empirical positional energy functions; and (iii) preservation of the spatial arrangement of potential disulfide bridging (31Godzik A. Kolinski A. Skolnick J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 227: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar, 38Bowie J.U. Luthy R. Eisenberg D.

Als models were assessed for validity in relationship to homology templates using standard measures (e-values (42Welch W. Sutko J.L. Mitchell K.E. Airey J. Ruest L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7165-7173Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 43Welch W. Ahmad S. Airey J.A. Gerzon K. Humerickhouse R.A. Besch Jr., H.R. Ruest L. Deslongchamps P. Sutko J.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6074-6085Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar)). Finally, the physicochemical properties of the Als models were visualized by MOLCAD (44Heiden W. Goetze T. Brickmann J. J. Comput. Chem. 1993; 14: 246-250Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar), as implemented in SYBYL and HINT platforms (45Kellogg G.E. Semus S.F. Abraham D.J. J. Comput. Aided Mol. Des. 1991; 5: 545-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar), such that the physical properties were projected onto the water-accessible surface of the Als N-terminal domains. To test the hypotheses generated by our homology modeling, we determined the structural features of the N-terminal domain of Als1p using the complementary approaches of CD and FTIR spectrometry. This protein, encompassing amino acids 17–432 of Als1p, was produced in S. cerevisiae and has been described previously (8Fu Y. Ibrahim A.S. Sheppard D.C. Chen Y.C. French S.W. Cutler J.E.

https://openalex.org/W2159026223,"Myocardial infarction (MI) has become one of the leading causes of death in the world. Its pathogenesis includes chronic formation of plaque inside the vessel wall of the coronary artery and acute rupture of the artery, implicating a number of inflammation-mediating molecules, such as the cytokine lymphotoxin-α (LTA)1. Functional variations in LTA are associated with susceptibility to MI2. Here we show that LTA protein binds to galectin-2, a member of the galactose-binding lectin family3. Our case–control association study in a Japanese population showed that a single nucleotide polymorphism in LGALS2 encoding galectin-2 is significantly associated with susceptibility to MI. This genetic substitution affects the transcriptional level of galectin-2 in vitro, potentially leading to altered secretion of LTA, which would then affect the degree of inflammation; however, its relevance to other populations remains to be clarified. Smooth muscle cells and macrophages in the human atherosclerotic lesions expressed both galectin-2 and LTA. Our findings thus suggest a link between the LTA cascade and the pathogenesis of MI."

https://openalex.org/W2156615522,"Mice with a fat-specific insulin receptor knock-out (FIRKO) exhibit a polarization of white adipose tissue into two populations of cells, one small (diameter <50 μm) and one large (diameter >100 μm), accompanied by changes in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, triglyceride synthesis, and lipolysis. To characterize these subclasses of adipocytes, we have used a proteomics approach in which isolated adipocytes from FIRKO and control (IR lox/lox) mice were separated by size, fractionated into cytosolic and membrane subfractions, and analyzed by sucrose gradient, SDS-PAGE, and mass spectrometry. A total of 27 alterations in protein expression at key steps in lipid and energy metabolism could be defined, which were coordinately regulated by adipocyte cell size, impaired insulin signaling, or both. Nine proteins, including vimentin, EH-domain-containing protein 2, elongation factor 2, glucose-regulated protein 78, transketolase, and succinyl-CoA transferase were primarily affected by presence or absence of insulin signaling, whereas 21 proteins, including myosin non-muscle form A, annexin 2, annexin A6, and Hsp47 were regulated in relation to adipocyte size. Of these 27 alterations in protein expression, 14 changes correlated with altered levels of mRNA, whereas the remaining 13 were the result of changes in protein translation or turnover. These data suggest an intrinsic heterogeneity in adipocytes with differences in protein expression patterns caused by transcriptional and post-transcriptional alterations related to insulin action and cellular lipid accumulation. Mice with a fat-specific insulin receptor knock-out (FIRKO) exhibit a polarization of white adipose tissue into two populations of cells, one small (diameter <50 μm) and one large (diameter >100 μm), accompanied by changes in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, triglyceride synthesis, and lipolysis.

These data suggest an intrinsic heterogeneity in adipocytes with differences in protein expression patterns caused by transcriptional and post-transcriptional alterations related to insulin action and cellular lipid accumulation. Adipose tissue plays a central role in the pathogenesis of diabetes and obesity. White adipose tissue provides the primary site of energy storage in the body and also serves as an important endocrine cell through secretion of hormones such as leptin, adiponectin (ACRP30), tumor necrosis factor α, resistin, and other cytokines (1Saltiel A.R. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 887-888Google Scholar). Brown adipose tissue is the major site of energy expenditure through expression of uncoupling protein 1 and its role in thermogenesis (2Lowell B.B. Spiegelman B.M. Nature. 2000; 404: 652-660Google Scholar). Insulin signaling plays an important role in lipid storage and the process of adipogenesis for both white and brown adipocytes. The loss of insulin action selectively in adipose tissue in mice with a fat-specific insulin receptor knock-out (FIRKO) 1The abbreviations used are: FIRKO, fat-specific insulin receptor knock-out; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-pro-panesulfonic acid; ESI, electrospray ion trap; GRP, glucose-regulated protein; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time- of-flight; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription. 1The abbreviations used are: FIRKO, fat-specific insulin receptor knock-out; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-pro-panesulfonic acid; ESI, electrospray ion trap; GRP, glucose-regulated protein; MALDI-TOF, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time- of-flight; STAT, signal transducers and activators of transcription. leads to profound changes in adipocyte function, including changes in glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and protein expression (3Blüher M. Michael M.D. Peroni O.D. Ueki K. Carter N. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 25-38Google Scholar). FIRKO mice have reduced fat mass and are protected against age- and diet-related obesity and its associated metabolic abnormalities, including glucose intolerance. In addition, these mice have increased longevity, despite normal or increased food intake (4Blüher M. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Science. 2003; 299: 572-574Google Scholar). Adipose tissue-specific insulin receptor knock-out in FIRKO mice also causes heterogeneity of white adipose tissue with polarization into small (diameter <50 μm) and large (diameter >150 μm) subclasses of adipocytes (3Blüher M. Michael M.D. Peroni O.D. Ueki K. Carter N. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 25-38Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of candidate molecules reveals changes in the expression of several key adipocyte proteins, such as ACRP30, fatty acid synthase, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBP-α), and GLUT1 glucose transporter (3Blüher M. Michael M.D. Peroni O.D. Ueki K. Carter N. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 25-38Google Scholar), suggesting that knock-out of the insulin receptor unmasks a intrinsic heterogeneity of cells in fat tissue. Analysis of gene expression using oligonucleotide microarrays has demonstrated that this is accompanied by changes in mRNA levels of 111 known cDNAs as well as many unknown expressed sequence tags, some of which are related in insulin signaling alterations and others to differences in adipocyte size (5Blüher M. Patti M.-E. Gesta S. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31891-31901Google Scholar). The recent development of unbiased proteomic analysis using gel electrophoresis and other separation techniques coupled with mass spectrometry, however, now allows the characterization of thousands of proteins from complex samples to reveal previously unrecognized connections between biochemical processes and protein expression patterns (6Aebersold R. Mann M. Nature. 2003; 422: 198-207Google Scholar). In the present study, we have used a multidimensional proteomics approach to test the hypothesis that insulin receptor knock-out in FIRKO mice unmasks a naturally occurring heterogeneity of adipocytes that causes differential lipid storage, resulting in subsets of small and large adipocytes. By comparing these findings with mRNA expression we can define unique and complementary levels of protein and mRNA regulation (7Ideker T. Thorsson V. Ranish J.A. Christmas R. Buhler J. Eng J.K. Bumgarner R. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Hood L. Science. 2001; 292: 929-934Google Scholar). Animals—IR (lox/lox) mice were derived as described previously (8Brüning J.C. Michael M.D. Winnay J.N. Hayashi T. Hörsch D. Accili D. Goodyear L.J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 559-569Google Scholar) and maintained on a mixed (C57BL/6 × 129/Sv) genetic background. Adipose tissue or FIRKO mice were derived by crossing IR lox/ox mice with mice that were heterozygous for the IR and were heterozygous of a transgene expressing the Cre recombinase under the control of the fatty acid-binding protein aP2 promoter/enhancer (aP2-Cre-IR(lox/+)) (3Blüher M. Michael M.D. Peroni O.D. Ueki K. Carter N. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 25-38Google Scholar). Animals were housed in virus-free facilities on a 12-h light/dark cycle (0700 on to 1900 off) and were fed a standard rodent chow (Mouse Diet 9F, PMI Nutrition International) and allowed water ad libitum. All protocols for animal use and euthanasia were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Joslin Diabetes Center and were in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. Genotyping was performed by PCR using genomic DNA isolated from the tail tip as described previously (3Blüher M. Michael M.D. Peroni O.D. Ueki K. Carter N. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 25-38Google Scholar). Histology—Tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and imbedded in paraffin. Multiple sections (separated by 70–80 μm each) were obtained from gonadal fat pads and analyzed systematically with respect to adipocyte size and number. Staining of the sections was performed with hematoxylin and eosin. For each genotype and gender at least 10 fields (representing ∼100 adipocytes)/slide were analyzed. Images were acquired using BX60 microscope (Olympus) and an HV-C20 television camera (Hitachi, Japan) and were analyzed using Image-Pro Plus 4.0 software. Isolation of Adipocytes and Separation into Small and Large Adipocytes—Animals were sacrificed, and epididymal fat pads were removed. Adipocytes were isolated by 1 mg/ml collagenase digestion. Separation of cells into small and large adipocytes was achieved by filtering the adipocyte suspension through a 75-μm pore size nylon mesh screen (see Fig. 1). Aliquots of adipocytes were fixed with osmic acid and counted in a Coulter counter (9Cushman S.W. Salans L.B. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 269-273Google Scholar). Adipocyte size was determined by dividing the lipid content of the cell suspension by the cell number (9Cushman S.W. Salans L.B. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 269-273Google Scholar). Cell Fractionation—Isolated small and large adipocytes were layered with 5 ml of dinonylphthalate and centrifuged for 5 min at 500 rpm in Beckman GPKR centrifuge. Adipocytes were removed and washed twice, once in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and once in cytosol buffer (cytosol buffer: 25 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 125 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 0.2 m sucrose, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.01 mg/ml tosyl-l-arginine methyl ester, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm phenanthrine). Buffer was removed and fresh cytosol buffer added to the cells at a volume half of the cell volume. Adipocytes were homogenized by 10 passes at 500 rpm using a motor-driven Teflon pestle homogenizer (Schuett, Germany). After a 5-min spin at 500 × g, the postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 72,000 rpm in a TLA 100.3 rotor (Beckman) for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed and saved as the cytosol fraction. The postnuclear pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of cytosol buffer and incubated with 2.5 m KCl to a final concentration of 0.5 m KCl on ice for 10 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 72,000 rpm in a TLA 100.3 rotor (Beckman) for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed as the KCl extract. The pellet was solubilized in cytosol buffer supplemented with CHAPS to a final concentration of 6 mm, vortexed, and cytosol buffer added to bring the final concentration of CHAPS to 3 mm. The suspension was vortexed continuously for 10 min, and protein determination was performed using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Equal concentrations of protein were layered on top of a 1.8-ml 10–30% sucrose gradient. The sucrose gradients were centrifuged at 35,000 rpm in a TLS55 rotor (Beckman) for 20 h at 4 °C. Each gradient was fractionated into 10 200-μl fractions from the top and then analyzed on 7.5–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Gels were stained with SYPRO Ruby protein stain (Molecular Probes) and photographed with a charge-coupled device camera after illumination with a 302 nm wavelength Ultra-Lum electronic UV transilluminator. Mass Spectrometry—Proteins bands were excised from the polyacrylamide gel and digested in-gel with trypsin (0.1 mg/ml trypsin (sequence grade, Promega) in 25 mm NH4HCO3, pH 8, for 12–16 h at 37 °C). The hydrolysates were then analyzed by either electrospray ion trap mass spectrometry (ESI) or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time- of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF). To analyze by ESI mass spectrometry, the digests were run out on a LC Packings Ultimate nano high performance liquid chromatography with a 100-μm C18PM column in a solvent A (0.1% formic acid, 3.5% acetonitrile) and solvent B (0.1% formic acid in 70/30 acetonitrile/water). Peptides were eluted with a linear gradient from 100% solvent A to 60% solvent B in 40 min at a flow of 500 nl/min. Peptides were eluted directly into the LCQ Deca ESI ion trap (liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry) mass spectrometer equipped with data-dependent acquisition and a high resolution scan performed. A higher energy tandem mass spectrometry scan was performed following the initial scan to verify peptide identifications. Peptides were searched using the Sequest software developed by John Yates and Jimmy Eng (University of Washington). To analyze by MALDI-TOF, the digested samples were concentrated further and desalted with Millipore Zip Tip C18 microtips. Peptide masses were determined using a Kratos Analytical Axima CFR MALDI-TOF spectrometer equipped with a curved field reflectron. Peptide masses were searched against the nonredundant protein data base using MS-Fit of the Protein Prospector program, a program available from the World Wide Web site of the Mass Spectrometry Facility of the University of California San Francisco. Fragmentation data from individual peptides via post source decay analysis were searched against the nonredundant protein data base using the Protein Prospector program MS-Tag. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis—Immunoprecipitations and Western blot analyses were performed on homogenates from isolated small and large adipocytes. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline containing 20% Tween, and incubated with the indicated primary antibodies. At least three blots of samples from four (controls) to eight animals (FIRKO) of each genotype were scanned using a Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphorImager and quantified using ImageQuant version 4.0 software. All values are expressed as mean ± S.E. unless otherwise indicated. Statistical analyses were carried out using two-tailed Student's unpaired t test and between more than two groups by analysis of variance. Significance was rejected at p ≥ 0.05. Microarray Analysis of mRNA Levels—This work is described in detail in the accompanying paper (5Blüher M. Patti M.-E. Gesta S. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31891-31901Google Scholar). In brief, total RNA was isolated from isolated pooled small and large adipocytes from at least eight FIRKO mice and at least four IR lox/lox mice. Double-stranded cDNA synthesis was reverse transcribed from 15 μg of isolated mRNA by using the SuperScript choice system (Invitrogen) in addition to using an oligo(dT) primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter site. Double-stranded cDNA was purified with Phase Lock Gel (Eppendorf). Biotin-labeled cRNA was transcribed by using a BioArray RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo). A hybridization mixture containing 15 μg of biotinylated cRNA, adjusted for possible carryover of residual total RNA, was prepared and hybridized to mouse Affymetrix MG-U74A-v2 chips. The chips were washed, scanned, and analyzed with GENECHIP MAS version 4.0. For each condition (FIRKO small and large, IR lox/lox small and large) five chips were analyzed. All chips were subjected to global scaling to a target intensity of 1,500 to take into account the inherent differences between the chips and their hybridization efficiencies. The background and the scaled noise of each of the chips were averaged. The data analysis was performed as described by Yechoor et al. (10Yechoor V.K. Patti M.E. Saccone R. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10587-10592Google Scholar). Adipocyte Heterogeneity in FIRKO Mice—Adipose tissue-specific insulin receptor knock-out causes heterogeneity of white adipose tissue with a polarization into small (diameter <50 μm) and large (diameter >100 μm) subclasses of adipocytes. Histological sections representative of white adipose tissue in FIRKO and IR lox/lox mice demonstrate a relatively uniform and normally distributed adipocyte size in white adipose tissue from IR lox/lox mice, whereas the fat pads from FIRKO mice contain a mixed population of large and small adipocytes (Fig. 1). We have previously shown that the polarization of adipocytes from FIRKO mice is accompanied by differences between small and large adipocytes in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, glucose metabolism, triglyceride synthesis, and lipolysis as well as in the expression of candidate proteins of adipocyte differentiation and metabolism (3Blüher M. Michael M.D. Peroni O.D. Ueki K. Carter N. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 25-38Google Scholar). Insulin receptor expression in both large and small adipocytes of FIRKO mice was reduced by 85–99% compared with the controls, indicating that the heterogeneity in adipocyte size in FIRKO mice was not caused by differences in efficiency of insulin receptor gene recombination in small and large adipocytes. The three littermate control groups: wild type, IR (lox/lox), and aP2-Cre mice were indistinguishable with regard to physiologic and metabolic parameters and possessed the same mixed genetic background as the FIRKO mice, including C57BL/6J, 129Sv, and FVB. Therefore, for all subsequent proteomics and genomics studies, IR lox/lox mice were used as controls. Proteomic Analysis—To characterize protein expression at the whole proteome level further, adipocytes were isolated from epididymal fat pads from 3-month-old male FIRKO and IR lox/lox mice and separated into small (<75 μm) and large (>75 μm) cells by filtration through nylon mesh screen. Each population of cells was fractionated further into membrane and cytosol fractions, and protein from each was loaded onto 10–30% sucrose gradients, centrifuged for 20 h, and then separate on 7–15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Resolved proteins were visualized by SYPRO Ruby protein stain, and differentially expressed proteins bands were excised from the gel, tryptically digested, and analyzed by either sequencing ESI mass spectrometry or peptide mass mapping fingerprinting (MALDI-TOF) as described under “Materials and Methods.” A total of three experiments were performed for each cell subfraction. Each experiment consisted of the comparison between FIRKO small and large, and IR lox/lox small and large adipocyte protein extracts in the KCl fraction of ionic bound membrane proteins, the CHAPS fraction of integrated membrane proteins, and the cytosol fraction (Fig. 1). Comparing the protein expression profiles of small and large adipocytes from FIRKO and IR lox/lox mice, 27 differentially expressed proteins were identified (Table I). For 14 of the proteins identified by proteomics, additional Western blot analysis was performed, and in each case this confirmed the protein expression pattern as detected by SDS-PAGE (Figs. 2, 3, 4).Table IComparison between proteomic and genomic analysis of large and small adipocytes of FIRKO and control mice Differences in protein and mRNA levels in large versus small adipocytes from FIRKO and IR lox/lox mice are shown.

Differential protein expression in isolated adipocytes depending on their diameter from 3 month-old male IR (lox/lox) and FIRKO mice is shown. Adipocytes from epididymal fat pads of four IR lox/lox and eight FIRKO mice were isolated by digestion with collagenase I, pooled, and separated into two different subsets of small (IR lox S, FIRKO S) and large (IR lox L, FIRKO L) adipocytes using a nylon mesh of 75-μm pore size. Three patterns of differential protein expression in small and large adipocytes from FIRKO and IR lox/lox mice were observed: decreased levels in small adipocytes of both FIRKO and IR lox/lox mice (carnitine palmitoyl transferase 2, aP2, clathrin heavy chain (HC), fatty acid synthase (FAS)) (A); decreased levels only in small FIRKO adipocytes, with indistinguishable protein levels between small and large IR lox/lox adipocytes (annexin A6, Hsp47, Hsp60) (B); decreased protein levels only in small IR lox/lox adipocytes, with indistinguishable protein expression in small and large FIRKO adipocytes (annexin 2) (C). For each of the three patterns a representative Western blot and quantitative analysis (mean ± S.E.) from at least three independent experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 4Differential protein expression in isolated adipocytes in 3-month-old male FIRKO and IR lox/lox mice independently from the adipocyte diameter. Adipocytes from epididymal fat pads of four IR lox/lox and eight FIRKO mice were isolated and fractionated as described in Fig. 3. Two patterns of different protein expression in small and large FIRKO and small and large IR lox/lox mice were observed: decreased protein expression in both small and large FIRKO adipocytes compared with small and large IR lox/lox adipocytes (EH domain-containing protein 2, CD36, elongation factor 2) (A); decreased protein expression in both small and large IR lox/lox adipocytes compared with FIRKO adipocytes in both cell size groups (vimentin, GRP78) (B). For each of the three patterns a representative Western blot and quantitation of the data (mean ± S.E.) from at least three independent experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Analysis revealed a regulation of protein expression both as a function of adipocyte size, i.e. different protein expression patterns in large and small adipocytes independent from the insulin receptor knock-out in adipocytes from FIRKO mice, as well as a function of impaired insulin signaling, i.e. in FIRKO adipocytes compared with adipocytes from IR lox/lox mice independent of size. A coordinated regulation of protein levels with decreased protein expression in small adipocytes compared with large adipocytes, as well as decreased protein expression in adipocytes from FIRKO mice compared with the controls could be identified for several proteins of lipid metabolism (fatty acid synthase, carnitine palmitoyl transferase 2, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, aP2, CD36, methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase), as well as for mitochondrial proteins (cytochrome c, succinyl-CoA transferase, citrate synthase, Hsp60) (Table I). Protein Expression in Function of the Adipocyte Size—Comparison of the gradient fractions from small and large FIRKO and IR lox/lox adipocytes by SDS-PAGE revealed major differences between small and large adipocytes both from FIRKO and IR lox/lox mice (Fig. 2). In three independent experiments analyzing “integral” membrane proteins (the CHAPS extract of membranes), myosin heavy chain, non-muscle form A, appeared only in large adipocytes from both FIRKO and IR lox/lox mice (Fig. 2). This differential expression, with no detectable myosin heavy chain, non-muscle form A protein expression in small adipocytes and easily detectable levels in extracts of large adipocytes in both FIKRO and control mice was confirmed by Western blotting with a specific antibody (Fig. 2). Within the limits of detection and this approach, this was the only protein exclusively detected in one cell type versus the other. Significantly decreased protein expression in small compared with large adipocytes from both FIRKO and IR lox/lox mice was detected for several other proteins and could be categorized into three different patterns (Fig. 3, A–C). The first pattern is characterized by decreased protein expression in small adipocytes of both FIRKO and IR lox/lox mice compared with large adipocytes. This was the case for the expression of the key enzyme in fatty acid synthesis, the fatty acid synthase, carnitine palmitoyl transferase 2 (CPT-2), the fatty acid binding protein aP2, clathrin heavy chain, carbonic anhydrase 3, and cyclophilin A (Fig. 3A). The second pattern represented proteins that were decreased only in small adipocytes of FIRKO mice, but not changed in small adipocytes from IR lox/lox mice. This pattern included annexin A6, Hsp47 and Hsp60, acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, acetyl-CoA dehydrogenase, xanthine dehydrogenase, cytochrome c, and the glucose-regulated protein (GRP) 58 (Fig. 3B). The third pattern of protein expression was characterized by proteins whose levels were decreased in small adipocytes of IR lox/lox mice but normally expressed in small adipocytes of the FIRKO mouse. This pattern was observed for annexin II and pyruvate dehydrogenase (Fig. 3C). Thus, proteomic analysis demonstrated that key enzymes and other molecules involved in lipid and fatty acid metabolism are commonly decreased in small adipocytes compared with large adipocytes. This could explain, at least in part, our observation that there are differences in triglyceride storage and triglyceride and fatty acid synthesis between large and small adipocytes (3Blüher M. Michael M.D. Peroni O.D. Ueki K. Carter N. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 25-38Google Scholar). Consequences of Impaired Insulin Signaling on Protein Expression Patterns—To futher elucidate the effect of impaired insulin signaling on different protein expression patterns, we analyzed proteins that might be regulated in response to the insulin receptor knock-out. This includes proteins with either decreased levels in both large and small FIRKO adipocytes (Fig. 4A) or increased expression in both large and small FIRKO adipocytes (Fig. 4B) compared with their respective controls. Decreased protein expression in both FIRKO large and small adipocytes was observed for the fatty acid translocase CD36, the EH domain-containing protein 2, elongation factor 2, succinyl-CoA transferase, and methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase (Fig. 4A). Conversely, an expression pattern with increased protein levels in both large and small FIRKO adipocytes was identified for vimentin, GRP78, aldehyde dehydrogenase 2, and transketolase (Fig. 4B). It is worth noting that the lack of insulin signaling resulting from knock-out of the insulin receptor in FIRKO adipocytes caused alterations in proteins involved in both adipocyte differentiation and adipocyte metabolism. Differentially regulated proteins that could be associated with the adipocyte differentiation process included proteins involved in cytoskeletal function (vimentin), protein processing (GRP78), and protein synthesis (elongation factor 2). Other proteins with differential expression were related to fatty acid metabolism (CD36, methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydrogenase), glycolysis (transketolase), and other metabolic pathways (aldehyde dehydrogenase 2, succinyl-CoA transferase). Thus, the changes in protein expression pattern suggest that the phenotype of the adipose tissue in FIRKO mice might be the result of both changes in the adipocyte differentiation program and adipocyte metabolism in response to the insulin receptor knock-out.

The major platelet adhesion receptor glycoprotein (GP) IIb–IIIa (integrin αIIbβ3) plays a central role in this process by promoting platelet aggregation and thrombus formation. We demonstrate here a novel mechanism down-regulating integrin αIIbβ3 adhesive function, involving platelet factor XIII (FXIII) and calpain, which serves to limit platelet aggregate formation and thrombus growth. This mechanism principally occurs in collagen-adherent platelets and is induced by prolonged elevations in cytosolic calcium, leading to dramatic changes in platelet morphology (membrane contraction, fragmentation, and microvesiculation) and a specific reduction in integrin αIIbβ3 adhesive function. Adhesion receptor signal transduction plays a major role in the process by sustaining cytosolic calcium flux necessary for calpain and FXIII activation. Analysis of thrombus formation on a type I fibrillar collagen substrate revealed an important role for FXIII and calpain in limiting platelet recruitment into developing aggregates, thereby leading to reduced thrombus formation. These studies define a previously unidentified role for platelet FXIII and calpain in regulating integrin αIIbβ3 adhesive function.

The ability of platelets to adhere to the injured vessel wall and recruit other platelets is critical for hemostatic plug formation and vascular repair. Dysregulated platelet-platelet interactions leading to exaggerated thrombus growth contribute to the development of various cardiovascular disorders, including the acute coronary syndromes, thrombotic stroke, and the acute complications of peripheral vascular disease. Primary platelet adhesion to the damaged vessel wall is initiated by subendothelial matrix proteins, including collagen and von Willebrand factor (VWF), 1The abbreviations used are: VWF, von Willebrand factor; MDC, monodansylcadaverine; SCIP, sustained calcium-induced platelet morphology; PS, phosphatidylserine; ALLN, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GP, glycoprotein; DIC, differential interference contrast.1The abbreviations used are: VWF, von Willebrand factor; MDC, monodansylcadaverine; SCIP, sustained calcium-induced platelet morphology; PS, phosphatidylserine; ALLN, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-Nle-CHO; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; GP, glycoprotein; DIC, differential interference contrast. which engage specific receptors on the platelet surface, including glycoprotein (GP) Ib/V/IX, GPVI, and integrins αIIbβ3 and α2β1 (1Ruggeri Z.M.

Firm adhesion of platelets is associated with granule secretion and extensive cytoskeletal remodeling, resulting in the development of a highly reactive surface for the recruitment of additional platelets. The reactivity of platelets is partly dependent on the surface immobilization of various adhesive ligands, including VWF, fibrinogen, and fibronectin, but is principally influenced by the activation status of integrin αIIbβ3 (1Ruggeri Z.M. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 1227-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar, 3McEver R.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 86: 746-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 4Jackson S.P. Nesbitt W.S.

The importance of this receptor in promoting hemostasis and thrombosis is well defined and therapeutic agents that target this receptor are important for the management of the acute coronary syndromes (5Ruggeri Z.M. Dent J.A. Saldivar E. Blood. 1999; 94: 172-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Savage B. Almus-Jacobs F. Ruggeri Z.M.

Given the central role played by integrin αIIbβ3 in supporting thrombus growth, considerable effort has been devoted to understanding the mechanism(s) regulating the adhesive function of this receptor. In particular, there has been intense interest in identifying the proximal signaling events regulating integrin αIIbβ3 activation. Central to this process is the mobilization of intracellular calcium, which is considered the principal initiator of integrin αIIbβ3 activation following platelet activation by a diverse range of stimuli (reviewed in Ref. 4Jackson S.P. Nesbitt W.S. Kulkarni S. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2003; 1: 1602-1612Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In fact, sustained calcium flux is not only important for initiating integrin αIIbβ3 activation (9Nesbitt W.S. Kulkarni S. Giuliano S. Goncalves I. Dopheide S.M. Yap C.L. Harper I.S. Salem H.H.

Cytosolic calcium flux in primary adherent and aggregating platelets can be maintained for long periods of time (up to 60 min), 2S. Kulkarni and S. P. Jackson, unpublished observations.2S. Kulkarni and S. P. Jackson, unpublished observations. however, the significance of such prolonged calcium flux in terms of platelet adhesive function has not been well defined. A major platelet enzyme that is preferentially activated by sustained levels of elevated calcium is the thiol protease, calpain. Activation of this protease is classically integrin αIIbβ3-dependent, occurs in the “late” phases of platelet stimulation and results in the limited proteolysis of a large number of platelet signaling and cytoskeletal proteins, many of which are physically or functionally linked to integrin αIIbβ3 (12Schoenwaelder S.M. Yuan Y. Jackson S.P. Platelets. 2000; 11: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Moreover, calpain has been demonstrated to directly cleave the cytoplasmic tail of the β3 subunit (13Du X. Saido T.C. Tsubuki S. Indig F.E. Williams M.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26146-26151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 14Pfaff M. Du X. Ginsberg M.H. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and based on studies in endothelial cells, such cleavage events may undermine the adhesive function of the receptor (15Meredith Jr., J. Mu Z. Saido T. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19525-19531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The importance of calpain in regulating integrin αIIbβ3 adhesive function remains controversial with evidence that the protease may have both positive and negative effects on receptor function (16Schoenwaelder S.M.

A second major platelet enzyme activated under conditions of sustained calcium flux is the cytosolic transglutaminase, factor XIII (FXIII). This enzyme is expressed at extremely high levels in platelets (at a concentration ∼100-fold higher than plasma FXIII) where it has been demonstrated to covalently cross-link a broad range of cytoskeletal proteins, including actin, myosin, vinculin, and the small heat-shock protein, hsp27 (19Muszbek L. Adany R. Mikkola H. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 1996; 33: 357-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The fact that these are all proteins important for cytoskeletal remodeling have raised the possibility that cellular FXIII may participate in cytoskeletal reorganization in activated platelets. In contrast to the plasma forms of FXIII, which have a well established role in hemostasis through cross-linking fibrin monomers, there is limited information regarding a role for the cellular form of FXIII in platelet function, although recent studies by Dale et al.

Nature. 2002; 415: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) suggest a role for this enzyme is serotonin-mediated localization of α-granular proteins on the activated platelet surface. The studies detailed in this report describe for the first time an important functional role for platelet FXIII and calpain in negatively regulating the adhesive function of integrin αIIbβ3. We demonstrate that platelets undergoing a high level of prolonged cytosolic calcium flux exhibit FXIII and calpain-dependent morphological changes that are associated with a selective down-regulation in the adhesive function of integrin αIIbβ3. This reduction in integrin αIIbβ3 adhesiveness is most apparent on highly reactive adhesive substrates, such as type I fibrillar collagen and is associated with reduced platelet aggregate formation and thrombus growth. These findings demonstrate an important role for FXIII and calpain in limiting the excessive accumulation of platelets on potent thrombogenic surfaces.

Preparation of Blood and Blood Cell Components—Blood and blood cell components were obtained from healthy donors or from an individual with FXIII deficiency (<1% plasma or platelet FXIIIa antigen), who had not taken any anti-platelet medication in the 2 weeks preceding the procedure. Blood was drawn into either 1:9 volume of trisodium citrate (15 mm) or hirudin (400 units/ml) for whole blood studies or theophyl-line containing acid/citrate/dextrose for platelet isolation. Washed platelets were prepared as described previously (22Yuan Y. Dopheide S.M. Ivanidis C. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21847-21854Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and finally resuspended in modified Tyrode's buffer (10 mm Hepes, 12 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 5 mm glucose) supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2/MgCl2 or 1 mm EGTA and 2 mm MgCl2 where indicated. Mouse platelets were isolated according to Goncalves et al. (24Goncalves I. Hughan S.C. Schoenwaelder S.M. Yap C.L. Yuan Y. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34812-34822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and human red blood cells were prepared as previously described (25Yap C.L. Hughan S.C. Cranmer S.L. Nesbitt W.S. Rooney M.M. Giuliano S. Kulkarni S. Dopheide S.M. Yuan Y. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol.

Static Adhesion Assays—Glass coverslips were left uncoated and unblocked (for adhesion to glass) or coated with 10 μg/ml VWF, 100 μg/ml or 2 mg/ml type I collagen, or 100 μg/ml fibrinogen overnight at 4 °C and then blocked with 5% human serum for 30 min. Washed platelets in Tyrode's buffer (1–3 × 107/ml) were allowed to adhere and spread for up to 60 min at 37 °C. Adherent platelets were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, or in 2% glutaraldehyde for scanning electron microscopy studies (23Kulkarni S. Dopheide S.M. Yap C.L. Ravanat C. Freund M. Mangin P. Heel K.A. Street A. Harper I.S. Lanza F. Jackson S.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In some experiments, platelets were pretreated with thapsigargin (10 nm) or thimerosal (1 μm) for 2 min prior to adhesion. In experiments examining the effect of calpain or FXIII inhibition on the rate of SCIP (sustained calcium-induced platelet morphology, see “Results”) formation, platelets (1 × 107/ml) in Tyrode's buffer were pretreated with vehicle (Me2SO), 50 μg/ml calpeptin, 50 μm ALLN, 50 μm E64-d, 25 μm p190–230, or the indicated concentrations of MDC for 30 min, prior to being applied to glass or collagen. In experiments examining the role of platelet adhesion receptors and soluble agonists in SCIP formation, human platelets preincubated with vehicle or 40 μg/ml c7E3 Fab for 10 min, or murine wild type or FcRγ-/-platelets, were allowed to adhere to VWF for 30 min or to collagen type I (100 μg/ml) for 15 min, respectively. Non-adherent platelets were aspirated and adherent platelets exposed to calcium-supplemented Tyrode's buffer alone, containing vehicle (Me2SO), 25 μm ADP, or 1 unit/ml thrombin, in the presence or absence of c7E3 Fab, for the indicated times. Adherent platelets were then fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde and visualized by differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy (×63 lens, Leica DMIRB, Leica, Germany), images were captured with MCID software (Imaging Research Inc.) and scored as SCIPs if exhibiting a central membrane structure surrounded by smaller membrane bodies as seen in Fig. 1. Indirect Immunofluorescence—Washed platelets (1 × 107/ml) in Tyrode's buffer were applied to fibrinogen or VWF for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of the appropriate primary antibody: anti-GPIbα (WM23, 2 μg/ml), anti-P-selectin (1 μg/ml), anti-fibrinogen (2 μg/ml), anti-VWF (5D2, 1 μg/ml), anti-intact integrin αIIbβ3 heterodimer (P2, 1 μg/ml), and anti-active integrin αIIbβ3 (PAC-1, 2 μg/ml). After 30 min, SCIP formation on fibrinogen was induced by adding 1 μm ionophore A23187 for 5 min. In experiments examining the effect of calpain or FXIII inhibitors on active integrin αIIbβ3 expression, platelets were pretreated with vehicle (Me2SO), ALLN (50 μm), MDC (25 μm), or MDC in conjunction with ALLN for 30 min prior to application to glass for 15 min. Adherent platelets were fixed, exposed to FITC-conjugated secondary antibody, and finally visualized using confocal-based DIC or fluorescence microscopy (×63 lens; Leica TCS-SP, Leica, Germany). To quantitate fluorescence associated with spread platelets or SCIPs, platelets were demarcated in DIC and the total fluorescence intensity and the surface area corresponding to those platelets quantitated using the Leica TCS-SP software quantitation module. In Vitro Flow Assays—In studies examining thrombus growth, platelets in hirudin-anticoagulated whole blood were labeled with DiOC6 (1 μm) then perfused over a concentrated collagen matrix for 5 min at 1800 s-1 at 37 °C. In some studies, whole blood was incubated with vehicle (Me2SO), z-VAD-fmk (100 μm), calpeptin (50 μg/ml), ALLN (50 μm), MDC (25 μm), or a combination of calpeptin and MDC for 30 min prior to perfusion. In dose-response studies we found that the increase in thrombus growth observed with the indicated concentrations of inhibitors was not enhanced when up to 10-fold higher concentrations were used. Platelet adhesion and thrombus growth was monitored by confocal fluorescence microscopy and the thrombi were reconstructed and quantitated as previously described (23Kulkarni S. Dopheide S.M. Yap C.L. Ravanat C. Freund M. Mangin P. Heel K.A. Street A. Harper I.S. Lanza F. Jackson S.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). In experiments correlating phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure (annexin V binding) with platelet aggregation, washed platelets (1.5 × 108/ml) loaded with 5 μm Fura Red-AM were reconstituted with packed red blood cells (50% hematocrit) and calcium-supplemented Tyrode's buffer containing 5 μg/ml FITC-annexin V. The platelet suspension was then perfused over collagen (2 mg/ml) at 1800 s-1 and the level of Fura Red and FITC-annexin V fluorescence was visualized by confocal microscopy (×63 lens; Leica TCS-SP). Under these conditions, non- or poorly activated platelets exhibited no annexin V but high Fura Red fluorescence (high intensity red), activated but non-SCIP platelets exhibited no annexin V but low-moderate Fura Red fluorescence (low intensity red), whereas SCIPs exhibited high annexin V but low Fura Red fluorescence (high intensity green). In vitro flow-based aggregation assays examining the interaction of platelets in whole blood with immobilized platelet monolayers were performed according to Kulkarni et al. (23Kulkarni S. Dopheide S.M. Yap C.L. Ravanat C. Freund M. Mangin P. Heel K.A. Street A. Harper I.S. Lanza F. Jackson S.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Briefly, monolayers were formed by allowing washed platelets (2.5 × 108/ml) in Tyrode's buffer to spread in glass microcapillary tubes for 30 min at 37 °C. Citrated whole blood labeled with 1 μm DiOC6 was then perfused over the preformed monolayers at a shear rate of 150 s-1. Platelet-monolayer interactions were visualized by epifluorescence microscopy (×40 lens, Leica DMIRB, Leica, Germany) and video-recorded for off-line analysis as previously described (23Kulkarni S. Dopheide S.M. Yap C.L. Ravanat C. Freund M. Mangin P. Heel K.A. Street A. Harper I.S. Lanza F. Jackson S.P. J. Clin. Investig. 2000; 105: 783-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Formation of SCIP Monolayers—Several independent approaches were investigated to achieve efficient (>95%) conversion of spread platelets to SCIPs in a preformed platelet monolayer. These include: 1) allowing platelets to form monolayers in the presence of extracellular calcium for prolonged periods of time (up to 120 min); 2) initially depleting platelet cytosolic calcium in a preformed monolayer with thapsigargin/EGTA for 15 min followed by exposure to thapsigargin/CaCl2 for a further 30 min; and 3) exposing preformed monolayers to 1 μm calcium ionophore A23187 in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 for 5–10 min. Of all these strategies, we found that exposing platelet monolayers to ionophore A23187 was the most efficient method of inducing SCIP formation in ∼100% of cells. The majority of the studies using a high percentage of SCIP monolayers were thus performed using ionophore A23187 as an inducer of SCIP formation. Calcium-induced Decrease in Platelet Surface Reactivity—We have previously established in vitro flow-based assays that enable real time analysis of cytosolic calcium flux during the development of platelet-platelet adhesion contacts (9Nesbitt W.S. Kulkarni S. Giuliano S. Goncalves I. Dopheide S.M. Yap C.L. Harper I.S. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 2965-2972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 25Yap C.L. Hughan S.C. Cranmer S.L. Nesbitt W.S. Rooney M.M. Giuliano S. Kulkarni S. Dopheide S.M. Yuan Y. Salem H.H. Jackson S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41377-41388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Using these experimental systems we have established a critical role for intercellular calcium communication in promoting platelet aggregate formation and thrombus growth (11Nesbitt W.S. Giuliano S. Kulkarni S. Dopheide S.M. Harper I.S. Jackson S.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 1151-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We demonstrate here that prolonged exposure (up to 30 min) of preformed platelet monolayers to extracellular calcium (1 mm) induced a paradoxical decrease in surface reactivity toward other platelets (Fig. 1A, 34 ± 3.2% decrease, n = 3, p < 0.05). The inhibitory effects of extracellular calcium on platelet reactivity were time-dependent, in that platelet monolayers initially exposed to calcium were highly reactive, however. With time there was a progressive decline in platelet adhesiveness (data not shown). Morphological examination of monolayers revealed that all platelets adhering under calcium-free conditions exhibited the classic spread morphology, whereas up to 50% of calcium-exposed platelets adopted a distinct morphological form (Fig. 1B, arrowheads). These cells were typically characterized by a round central membrane structure (2–5 μm) surrounded by numerous smaller membrane fragments. For ease of reference, we will refer to these distinct morphological forms as SCIPs throughout the remainder of this report. Real time analysis of platelet morphological changes revealed the temporal sequence of events leading to SCIP formation (Supplementary Materials Video 1). As shown in Fig. 1, C and D (upper panels), adherent platelets rapidly converted from discoid to spherical forms extending multiple filopodia followed rapidly by lamellipodial extension leading to a flattened, spread morphology within 2–5 min of adhesion. Platelets maintained this morphology for a variable period of time, ranging from 2 to 15 min. After this, fully spread platelets consistently underwent a specific sequence of morphological changes that was initiated by the marked contraction of lamellipodial membranes (Fig. 1, C and D, lower panels, and E), microvesiculation (Fig. 1C, arrows) and eventual fragmentation of the cell into a larger central membrane structure that was surrounded by smaller membrane bodies. Whereas the sequence of morphological changes from initial platelet adhesion to spreading typically took ∼5 min, the conversion of fully spread platelets to the fragmented and vesiculating morphology was more rapid, occurring within a 1–3-min time frame once membrane contraction was initiated (Supplementary Materials Video 1). SCIP Formation Occurs as a General Feature of Platelet Adhesion—To investigate the potential physiological significance of SCIP formation, platelet adhesion studies were performed on collagen, VWF, and fibrinogen matrices. We found that SCIP formation occurred on each of these adhesive matrices, although the proportion of platelets converting to SCIP morphology was much more prominent on a collagen surface relative to VWF (Fig. 2, A and B) and fibrinogen (data not shown). In fact, SCIP formation was a cardinal feature of platelet adhesion to fibrillar collagen, with ∼75% of cells forming SCIPs within 10 min of initial adhesion (data not shown). Significantly, co-stimulation of VWF- (Fig. 2A) or fibrinogen-adherent (data not shown) platelets with soluble agonists such as ADP or thrombin dramatically enhanced the proportion of platelets converting to SCIPs, suggesting a synergistic role for soluble agonists and adhesive stimuli in this process. Similar morphological changes to those described here for SCIPs have previously been reported with collagen-adherent platelets (26Heemskerk J.W. Vuist W.M. Feijge M.A. Reutelingsperger C.P. Lindhout T. Blood. 1997; 90: 2615-2625Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and have been demonstrated to be induced by sustained increases in cytosolic calcium. Consistent with this, we observed that ADP or thrombin stimulation of VWF-adherent platelets induced a high level of sustained cytosolic calcium flux in all platelets converting to SCIPs (data not shown). Similarly, co-stimulation of VWF-adherent platelets with reagents that directly potentiate cytosolic calcium flux, such as the sarcoendo-plasmic reticulum calcium ATPase inhibitor, thapsigargin, the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor reductase, thimerosal, or ionophore A23187, also potentiated SCIP formation (data not shown). High levels of cytosolic calcium flux induce PS expression on the surface of platelets leading to enhanced procoagulant function. Analysis of FITC-annexin V binding (a specific marker of PS expression) demonstrated a marked increase in PS exposure on the surface of SCIPs relative to resting and fully spread platelets (Fig. 2C). Pretreating platelets with EGTA, thereby preventing transmembrane calcium influx and sustained cytosolic calcium responses, eliminated PS exposure (data not shown) (27Walker J.H. Boustead C.M. Koster J.J. Bewley M. Waller D.A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1992; 20: 828-833Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and SCIP formation (Fig. 2B) on all adhesive surfaces examined. Taken together, the results in Figs. 1 and 2 raise the interesting possibility that high levels of sustained cytosolic calcium flux induce a phenotypic switch in platelets from a pro-adhesive to a procoagulant state. Contribution of Adhesion Receptor Ligation to the Process of SCIP Formation—It is well established that platelet stimulation with physiological agonists alone induces minimal microvesiculation and PS exposure. We have confirmed these findings with respect to thrombin and ADP and have found that these agonists only induce significant microvesiculation and annexin V binding to the surface of primary adherent platelets (data not shown). To investigate the requirement for adhesion receptor signaling for membrane fragmentation and microvesiculation, we performed studies using murine platelets deficient in the FcR γ-chain·GPVI receptor complex. These platelets are completely unresponsive to collagen stimulation, however, they respond normally to all other agonists (28Poole A. Gibbins J.M. Turner M. van Vugt M.J. van de Winkel J.G. Saito T. Tybulewicz V.L. Watson S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2333-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous reports, FcRγ-/- platelets adhered to immobilized collagen but did not exhibit a cytosolic calcium response or undergo shape change (data not shown). Co-stimulation of these platelets with either ADP or thrombin elicited a robust cytosolic calcium response (data not shown) and induced platelet spreading, presumably through integrin α2β1, however, there was minimal SCIP formation, even after prolonged periods of stimulation (Fig. 3A). This contrasted with wild type controls that exhibited similar morphological changes as observed in human platelets, with soluble agonist co-stimulation leading to an increase in the rate and extent of SCIP conversion (Fig. 3A). Similar to collagen, co-stimulation of VWF-adherent platelets with ADP or thrombin dramatically enhanced the rate of SCIP formation on human platelets (Fig. 3B). However, in the presence of the integrin αIIbβ3 blocking antibody, c7E3 Fab, neither agonist induced significant membrane fragmentation or microvesiculation (Fig. 3B). These studies suggest a major role for adhesion receptors in promoting SCIP formation in primary adherent platelets, presumably because of a requirement for adhesion receptor signal transduction in maintaining high levels of sustained cytosolic calcium flux."

White adipose tissue of FIRKO mice is also characterized by a polarization into two major populations of adipocytes, one small (<50 μm) and one large (>100 μm), which differ with regard to basal triglyceride synthesis and lipolysis, as well as in the expression of fatty acid synthase, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBP-α). Gene expression analysis using RNA isolated from large and small adipocytes of FIRKO and control (IR lox/lox) mice was performed on oligonucleotide microarrays. Of the 12,488 genes/expressed sequence tags represented, 111 genes were expressed differentially in the four populations of adipocytes at the p < 0.001 level. These alterations exhibited 10 defined patterns and occurred in response to two distinct regulatory effects. 63 genes were identified as changed in expression depending primarily upon adipocyte size, including C/EBP-α, C/EBP-δ, superoxide dismutase 3, and the platelet-derived growth factor receptor. 48 genes were regulated primarily by impairment of insulin signaling, including transforming growth factor β, interferon γ, insulin-like growth factor I receptor, activating transcription factor 3, aldehyde dehydrogenase 2, and protein kinase Cδ.

These data suggest an intrinsic heterogeneity of adipocytes with differences in gene expression related to adipocyte size and insulin signaling. Adipocytes play a central role in energy balance, both as a reservoir, storing and releasing fuel, and as endocrine cells, secreting factors that regulate whole body energy metabolism (1Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 2001; 104: 531-543Google Scholar).

Michael M.D. Peroni O.D. Ueki K. Carter N. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 25-38Google Scholar). We reported previously that FIRKO mice have markedly reduced fat mass and whole body triglyceride stores and are protected from gold thioglucose-induced and age-related obesity, as well as the associated glucose intolerance (2Blüher M. Michael M.D. Peroni O.D. Ueki K. Carter N. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 25-38Google Scholar). These changes are associated with increased longevity of these mice (3Blüher M. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Science. 2003; 299: 572-574Google Scholar). FIRKO mice also exhibit a heterogeneity in fat cell size with polarization into small (diameter <50 μm) and large (diameter >100 μm) subclasses of adipocytes (2Blüher M. Michael M.D. Peroni O.D. Ueki K. Carter N. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 25-38Google Scholar). This polarization by cell size of adipose tissue is not unique to the FIRKO model. Targeted disruption of the hormone-sensitive lipase also causes reduced body fat mass and heterogeneity of adipocytes in white adipose tissue (WAT) with a population of larger adipocytes, which is sensitive to lipid accumulation, and a population of small adipocytes, which is not (4Osuga J. Ishibashi S. Oka T. Yagyu H. Tozawa R. Fujimoto A. Shionoiri F. Yahagi N. Kraemer F.B. Tsutsumi O. Yamada N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 787-792Google Scholar, 5Wang S.P. Laurin N. Himms-Hagen J. Rudnicki M.A. Levy E. Robert M.F. Pan L. Oligny L. Mitchell G.A. Obes. Res. 2001; 9: 119-128Google Scholar). These results suggest that adipocytes, even within a single depot of WAT, may not be of a single lineage or type (6Spiegelman B.M. Choy L. Hotamisligil G.S. Graves R.A. Tontonoz P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6823-6826Google Scholar).Using a candidate gene/protein approach we found that the heterogeneity of WAT in FIRKO mice is accompanied by changes in the expression of several key adipocyte proteins, such as ACRP30, fatty acid synthase, SREBP-1 C/EBP-α, and GLUT-1 glucose transporter (2Blüher M. Michael M.D. Peroni O.D. Ueki K. Carter N. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 25-38Google Scholar). These results led to our hypothesis that insulin receptor knock-out unmasks a naturally occurring heterogeneity of adipocytes with differential roles in lipid storage and other functions. Recently, genomewide expression profiling has been used to investigate adipogenesis and adipocyte gene expression in vitro and in vivo (7Ross S.E. Erickson R.L. Gerin I. DeRose P.M. Bajnok L. Longo K.A. Misek D.E. Kuick R. Hanash S.M. Atkins K.B. Andresen S.M. Nebb H.I. Madsen L. Kristiansen K. MacDougald O.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 5989-5999Google Scholar, 8Soukas A. Socci N.D. Saatkamp B.D. Novelli S. Friedman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34167-34174Google Scholar). However, until now there has been no study attempting to define the full set of alterations in gene expression, which may contribute to heterogeneity in WAT.In the present study, we have used a genomewide expression profiling approach to test the hypothesis that the insulin receptor knock-out fat of the FIRKO mice unmasks a heterogeneity of adipocytes that can be defined by subsets of small and large adipocytes. We have further addressed the question as to which genes are primarily affected by the absence or presence of insulin signaling and which are regulated by the adipocyte size. In addition, because protein expression may uncover additional changes that result from post-transcriptional effects (9Ideker T. Thorsson V. Ranish J.A. Christmas R. Buhler J. Eng J.K. Bumgarner R. Goodlett D.R. Aebersold R. Hood L. Science. 2001; 292: 929-934Google Scholar), we further characterized the protein expression pattern in these large and small adipocytes from FIRKO and control mice using a global proteomics approach and compared that with the gene expression pattern (10, Blüher, M., Wilson-Fritch, L., Leszyk, J., Laustsen, P. G., Corvera, S., and Kahn, C. R. (2004) 279, 31902-31909Google Scholar).MATERIALS AND METHODSAnimals—IR (lox/lox) mice were derived as described previously (11Brüning J.C. Michael M.D. Winnay J.N. Hayashi T. Hörsch D. Accili D. Goodyear L.J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 559-569Google Scholar) and maintained on a mixed (C57BL/6 × 129/Sv) genetic background. Adipose tissue or FIRKO mice were derived by crossing double heterozygous IR (lox/+) with IR (lox/+) mice that also expressed Cre recombinase under the control of the fatty acid-binding protein aP2 promoter/enhancer (aP2-Cre-IR(lox/+)) as described previously (2Blüher M. Michael M.D. Peroni O.D. Ueki K. Carter N. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 25-38Google Scholar). Animals for this study were derived from the breedings of IR lox/lox with FIRKO mice. Animals were housed in virus-free facilities on a 12-h light/dark cycle (0700 on to 1900 off) and were fed a standard rodent chow (Mouse Diet 9F, PMI Nutrition International) and allowed water ad libitum. All protocols for animal use and euthanasia were reviewed and approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Joslin Diabetes Center and were in accordance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. Genotyping was performed by PCR using genomic DNA isolated from the tail tip as described previously (2Blüher M. Michael M.D. Peroni O.D. Ueki K. Carter N. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 25-38Google Scholar).Histology—Tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and imbedded in paraffin. Multiple sections (separated by 70–80 μm each) were obtained from gonadal fat pads and analyzed systematically with respect to adipocyte size and number. Staining of the sections was performed with hematoxylin and eosin. For each genotype and gender at least 10 fields (representing ∼100 adipocytes)/slide were analyzed. Images were acquired using BX60 microscope (Olympus) and a HV-C20 television camera (Hitachi, Japan) and were analyzed using Image-Pro Plus 4.0 software.Isolation of Adipocytes and Separation into Small and Large Adipocytes—At the age of 3 months, male animals were sacrificed, and epididymal fat pads were removed. Adipocytes were isolated by collagenase (1 mg/ml) digestion. Separation of cells into small and large diameter adipocytes was achieved by filtering the adipocyte suspension through a 75-μm pore size nylon mesh screen (see Fig. 1). Aliquots of adipocytes were fixed with osmic acid and counted in a Coulter counter (12Cushman S.W. Salans L.B. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 269-273Google Scholar). Adipocyte size was determined by dividing the lipid content of the cell suspension by the cell number (12Cushman S.W. Salans L.B. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 269-273Google Scholar) and in addition by a Multisizer (Beckman-Coulter) as described previously (13Tozzo E. Shepherd P.R. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E956-E964Google Scholar).Glucose Transport and Metabolism in Isolated Adipocytes—For the determination of glucose transport, isolated adipocytes of different diameter were stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 30 min and then incubated for 30 min with 3 μm U-[14C]glucose (14Tozzo E. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1604-1611Google Scholar). Immediately after the incubation adipocytes were fixed with osmic acid, incubated for 48 h at 37 °C (15Etherton T.D. Thompson E.H. Allen C.E. J. Lipid Res. 1977; 18: 552-557Google Scholar), and the radioactivity was quantified. Glucose metabolism into three different pathways was determined at 5 mm glucose (containing 3 μm U-[14C]glucose) using a 10% isolated fat cell suspension. Glucose incorporated into triglycerides and CO2 was measured after a 1-h incubation in the absence or presence of 80 nm insulin as described previously (13Tozzo E. Shepherd P.R. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: E956-E964Google Scholar). Glucose incorporated into lactate was measured after a 1-h incubation and after separation of lactate from glucose using anion exchange columns (AG 1-X8 Resin, Bio-Rad).Sample Preparation, Microarray, and Data Analysis—Equal quantities of total RNA were isolated from isolated pooled small and large adipocytes from at least 9–12 FIRKO mice and at least 8–10 IR lox/lox mice (see Fig. 1). Double-stranded cDNA synthesis was reverse transcribed from 15 μg of isolated mRNA by using the SuperScript choice system (Invitrogen) in addition to using an oligo(dT) primer containing a T7 RNA polymerase promoter site. Double-stranded cDNA was purified with Phase Lock Gel (Eppendorf). Biotin-labeled cRNA was transcribed by using a BioArray RNA transcript labeling kit (Enzo). A hybridization mixture containing 15 μg of biotinylated cRNA, adjusted for possible carryover of residual total RNA, was prepared and hybridized to mouse Affymetrix MG-U74A-v2 chips. The chips were washed, scanned, and analyzed with GENECHIP MAS V.4.0.For each condition (FIRKO small and large, IR lox/lox small and large), five chips, each representing a pool of RNA from fat cells of about 10 mice, were analyzed (Fig. 1). All chips were subjected to global scaling to a target intensity of 1,500 to take into account the inherent differences between the chips and their hybridization efficiencies. The background and the scaled noise of each of the chips were averaged. The data analysis was performed as described by Yechoor et al. (16Yechoor V.K. Patti M.E. Saccone R. Kahn C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10587-10592Google Scholar). After calculating the means ± S.D. of the expression intensities of genes for the five samples in each experimental group, three separate filters of significance were applied serially to obtain a list of those genes that had a significant change between the groups. The first filter excluded all genes that had a mean expression value that was below the sum of the average background and the average standard difference threshold (equal to 4 times the scaled noise) in all groups. Genes that passed this first filter were subjected to the second significance filter, which was to consider only those genes for which the difference between the means of the compared experimental groups was more than twice the sum of the standard differences of both groups. Finally, Student's t test was used as a third filter in each of the four two-way comparisons (FIRKO large versus small adipocytes, IR lox/lox large versus small adipocytes, large adipocytes; FIRKO versus IR lox/lox, small adipocytes; FIRKO versus IR lox/lox) to select only those genes that passed the significance level of p < 0.001. Genes that passed all three filters were then considered significantly changed between the experimental groups.Quantitative Reverse Transcription Real Time PCR—Total RNA from each of the same 20 pooled RNA samples, 5 from each of the 4 experimental groups that were hybridized to the microarrays, was used as a template in a fluorescence-based, quantitative one-step real time PCR, with specific primers for selected genes (n = 15) to confirm the microarray results.RESULTSWe have previously shown that adipose-specific insulin receptor knock-out causes a change in the morphology of WAT with a polarization into small (diameter <50 μm) and large (diameter >100 μm) subclasses of adipocytes (2Blüher M. Michael M.D. Peroni O.D. Ueki K. Carter N. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 25-38Google Scholar). Histological sections representative of WAT in FIRKO and IR lox/lox mice demonstrate a relatively uniform and normally distributed adipocyte size in WAT from IR lox/lox mice, whereas the fat pads from FIRKO mice contain a mixed population of the two cell sizes (2Blüher M. Michael M.D. Peroni O.D. Ueki K. Carter N. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 25-38Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of candidate molecules indicates near complete knock-out of the insulin receptor in both classes of adipocytes, but the polarization of adipocytes is accompanied by differences between small and large adipocytes in the expression of several key adipocyte proteins including ACRP30, fatty acid synthase, glucose transporter GLUT 1, SREBP 1c, and C/EBP-α (2Blüher M. Michael M.D. Peroni O.D. Ueki K. Carter N. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 25-38Google Scholar). In addition, as reported previously (2Blüher M. Michael M.D. Peroni O.D. Ueki K. Carter N. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 25-38Google Scholar), in control mice, insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was significantly higher in small adipocytes (about 5-fold stimulation) compared with large adipocytes (about 3-fold stimulation), consistent with a decrease in insulin responsiveness in larger adipocytes. In adipocytes from FIRKO mice, basal glucose uptake was unchanged compared with the controls, but insulin-stimulated glucose uptake was reduced by more than 90% in both large and small cells, confirming the efficiency of the IR knock-out. On the other hand, basal incorporation of glucose into triglycerides and basal rates of lipolysis in large FIRKO adipocytes were increased significantly compared with the other groups (p < 0.05) (2Blüher M. Michael M.D. Peroni O.D. Ueki K. Carter N. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 25-38Google Scholar), indicating increased lipid turnover in large adipocytes of FIRKO mice. As expected, insulin inhibited lipolysis in both large and small cells of control mice, but not in the FIRKO mice (2Blüher M. Michael M.D. Peroni O.D. Ueki K. Carter N. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 25-38Google Scholar).To further analyze the differences in adipocyte populations, the experimental protocol shown in Fig. 1 was applied. To assure uniformity of recombination of the insulin receptor allele in the FIRKO study groups, IR recombination was assessed in WAT of each mouse by a PCR technique described previously (2Blüher M. Michael M.D. Peroni O.D. Ueki K. Carter N. Kahn B.B. Kahn C.R. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 25-38Google Scholar), and only data from mice with an efficient IR recombination were included in the analysis. The three littermate control groups (wild type, IR (lox/lox), and aP2-Cre mice) were indistinguishable with regard to physiologic and metabolic parameters and possessed the same mixed genetic background as the FIRKO mice, including C57BL/6J, 129Sv, and FVB. To characterize the gene expression using the genomics approach, adipocytes were isolated from epididymal fat pads from 3-month-old male FIRKO and IR lox/lox mice and separated into small (diameter <75 μm) and large (diameter >75 μm) by filtration through nylon mesh screen as described in detail under “Materials and Methods” (Fig. 1). For all genomic and proteomic studies, IR lox/lox mice were used as controls.Microarray Analysis—Gene expression analysis was conducted using Affymetrix microarrays and subjected to three filters of significance. The first filter excluded all genes that had a mean expression value that was below the sum of the average background and the average standard difference threshold (equal to 4 times the scaled noise) in all groups. Genes that passed this first filter were subjected to the second significance filter, which was to consider only those genes for which the difference between the means of the compared experimental groups was more than twice the sum of the standard differences of both groups. Finally, Student's t test was used as a third filter in each of the four two-way comparisons (FIRKO large versus small adipocytes, IR lox/lox large versus small adipocytes, large adipocytes; FIRKO versus IR lox/lox, small adipocytes; FIRKO versus IR lox/lox) to select only those genes, which passed the significance level of p < 0.001. Genes that passed all three filters were then labeled as significantly changed between the experimental groups.Of the 12,488 genes and expressed sequence tags that are represented on the Affymetrix mouse MG-U74A v.2 oligonucleotide array, 7,389 genes passed the first significance filter (Fig. 2A), i.e. had a minimum expression value that was greater than the sum of the average background plus the average standard difference threshold (4 times the scaled noise). 2All raw data are available on the Diabetes Genome Anatomy Project Web site at www.diabetesgenome.org. 784 genes met the second significance filter, i.e. the difference of the means for each of the four comparisons (Fig. 2B) of greater than twice the sum of the standard differences (Fig. 2A). Of these genes, 221 also met the criteria of the third filter, i.e. a statistical significant difference in at least one comparison as determined by Student's t test with a significance level of p < 0.001 (Fig. 2A). These 221 genes that passed all three filters were then labeled as significantly changed between the experimental groups. Within the significantly changed genes, 110 were expressed sequence tags or represent different oligonucleotide probe sets of the same gene on the chip and were therefore disregarded in the further analysis. In all subsequent steps, only the 111 significantly changed, and annotated genes are analyzed and discussed.Fig. 2Data analysis. A, three separate independent filters of significance were applied serially to obtain a list that was significantly up- or down-regulated in at least one comparison. The first filter excluded all genes that had a mean expression value that was below the sum of the average background (BG) and the average standard difference threshold (equal to 4 times the scaled noise) in all groups. 7,389 genes that passed this first filter were subjected to the second significance filter, which was to consider only those genes for which the difference between the means of the compared experimental groups was >2 times the sum of the standard differences of both groups. Finally, Student's t test was used as a third filter in each of the four two-way comparisons (FIRKO large (L) versus small (S) adipocytes, IR lox/lox large versus small adipocytes, large adipocytes; FIRKO versus IR lox/lox, small adipocytes; FIRKO versus IR lox/lox). 221 genes that passed all three filters including the significance level of p < 0.0001 and were identified as significantly changed. B, comparisons performed to test for the consequences of the impaired insulin signaling or the adipocyte size.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Of the 111 significantly changed genes, two distinct patterns of regulation could be identified. 48 genes were changed primarily as a function of adipocyte size (Table I), whereas 63 genes were regulated primarily by the presence or absence of the insulin receptor signaling (Table II). A complete list of all data from the microarray analysis is available at the Web site of the Diabetes Genome Anatomy Project.2 Interestingly, many of the gene expression changes were relatively modest (25–50% increase or decrease); but based on the stringent statistical analysis used for defining these differences, the well defined groups of only one cell type (isolated adipocytes) and on the confirmation of at least part of the gene expression changes by real time PCR and proteomic data (10, Blüher, M., Wilson-Fritch, L., Leszyk, J., Laustsen, P. G., Corvera, S., and Kahn, C. R. (2004) 279, 31902-31909Google Scholar), these are relevant changes in this model.Table IChanges in gene expression in adipocytes of FIRKO mice depending on impaired insulin signaling Boldface numbers

https://openalex.org/W1986509703,"Substance P (SP) induces endocytosis and recycling of the neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) in endothelial cells and spinal neurons at sites of inflammation and pain, and it is thus important to understand the mechanism and function of receptor trafficking. We investigated how the SP concentration affects NK1R trafficking and determined the role of Rab GTPases in trafficking. NK1R trafficking was markedly influenced by the SP concentration. High SP (10 nm) induced translocation of the NK1R and β-arrestin 1 to perinuclear sorting endosomes containing Rab5a, where NK1R remained for >60 min. Low SP (1 nm) induced translocation of the NK1R to early endosomes located immediately beneath the plasma membrane that also contained Rab5a and β-arrestin 1, followed by rapid recycling of the NK1R. Overexpression of Rab5a promoted NK1R translocation to perinuclear sorting endosomes, whereas the GTP binding-deficient mutant Rab5aS34N caused retention of the NK1R in superficial early endosomes. NK1R translocated from superficial early endosomes to recycling endosomes containing Rab4a and Rab11a, and Rab11aS25N inhibited NK1R recycling. Rapid NK1R recycling coincided with resensitization of SP-induced Ca2+ mobilization and with the return of surface SP binding sites. Resensitization was minimally affected by inhibition of vacuolar H+-ATPase and phosphatases but was markedly suppressed by disruption of Rab4a and Rab11a. Thus, whereas β-arrestins mediate NK1R endocytosis, Rab5a regulates translocation between early and sorting endosomes, and Rab4a and Rab11a regulate trafficking through recycling endosomes. We have thus identified a new function of Rab5a as a control protein for directing concentration-dependent trafficking of the NK1R into different intracellular compartments and obtained evidence that Rab4a and Rab11a contribute to G-protein-coupled receptor recycling from early endosomes.

Activation the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR), angiotensin II type 1A receptor (AT1AR), and neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) stimulates translocation of G-protein receptor kinases (GRKs) from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, where they phosphorylate receptors (1Daaka Y.

This interaction disrupts association of GPCRs and heterotrimeric G-proteins and thereby mediates uncoupling and desensitization. β-Arrestins are also adapters for clathrin and AP-2 and thus recruit GPCRs to coated pits, where the GTPase dynamin mediates budding of vesicles (6McConalogue K.

In this manner, β-arrestins are required for agonist-induced endocytosis of the β2AR and NK1R (6McConalogue K. Dery O. Lovett M. Wong H. Walsh J.H. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W. J. Biol.

Many internalized GPCRs, including the β2AR and NK1R, recycle to the cell surface, which mediates resensitization (13von Zastrow M. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol.

However, in comparison with our understanding of endocytosis, less is known about the mechanisms of intracellular trafficking of GPCRs. Receptors translocate from coated pits to endocytic vesicles and then early endosomes, which serve as a transport node for either rapid recycling from endosomes located immediately beneath the plasma membrane (“short pathway”) or slow recycling from sorting endosomes in a perinuclear location (“long pathway”). The Rab GTPases control multiple steps of this trafficking (reviewed in Refs. 17Mohrmann K. van der Sluijs P. Mol. Membr.

Rab5a is present at the plasma membrane and in early endosomes and mediates endocytosis and transport or fusion of endocytic vesicles with early endosomes (19Christoforidis S. McBride H.M. Burgoyne R.D. Zerial M. Nature. 1999; 397: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Rab5a is required for endocytosis of the transferrin receptor, dopamine D2 receptor, β2AR, and m4 muscarinic receptor (20Bucci C. Parton R.G. Mather I.H. Stunnenberg H. Simons K. Hoflack B. Zerial M.

Rab5a is also required for trafficking of AT1AR and NK1R from endocytic vesicles to endosomes in a perinuclear location (25Seachrist J.L. Laporte S.A. Dale L.B. Babwah A.V. Caron M.G. Anborgh P.H.

Indeed, the AT1AR directly interacts with Rab5a, and this interaction may be required for trafficking (25Seachrist J.L. Laporte S.A. Dale L.B. Babwah A.V. Caron M.G. Anborgh P.H. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 679-685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Rab4a and Rab11a play an important role in receptor sorting and recycling. Rab4a is partially colocalized with Rab5a in sorting endosomes and mediates rapid recycling of the transferrin receptor (27Sonnichsen B. De Renzis S. Nielsen E. Rietdorf J. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 901-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Rab11a is present in recycling endosomes and is required for slow recycling of the transferrin receptor from perinuclear endosomes (27Sonnichsen B. De Renzis S. Nielsen E. Rietdorf J. Zerial M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 901-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). The AT1AR colocalizes with Rab4a and Rab11a during recycling, and Rab4a and Rab11a also mediate recycling of the β2AR (23Seachrist J.L. Anborgh P.H. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol.

However, the role of these Rabs in recycling and resensitization of GPCRs has not been fully investigated. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine the mechanisms of recycling of the NK1R. The NK1R belongs to the “class B” GPCRs that form stable and high affinity interactions with both β-arrestin 1 and 2 at the plasma membrane and in endosomes (30Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A. Holt J.A.

After exposure to high concentrations of agonists (>10 nm substance P (SP)), the NK1R is extensively phosphorylated and remains associated with β-arrestins for prolonged periods (hours) in endosomes (6McConalogue K.

Dephosphorylation of the NK1R and dissociation of its ligand SP, which occur in acidified vesicles, are required for slow recycling and resensitization by the long pathway (15Grady E.F. Garland A.M.

However, the NK1R undergoes minimal phosphorylation after exposure to low and probably more physiologically relevant concentrations of SP (<1 nm), and the mechanisms of NK1R recycling and the contributions of Rab4a and Rab11a remain to be determined (34Vigna S.R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1925-1932PubMed Google Scholar). Our aims were to (a) examine the effects of graded concentrations of SP on the kinetics and pathway of NK1R recycling and resensitization; (b) determine the contributions of Rab5a, Rab4a, and Rab11a to intracellular trafficking and recycling of the NK1R; and (c) investigate the role of these Rabs in resensitization of the NK1R.

To generate cell lines stably expressing Rab4a and Rab11a, KNRK-NK1R cells were incubated for 2 h with 5 μg/ml cDNA encoding Rab11a-GFP, Rab11aS25N-GFP, Rab4a-GFP, or Rab4aS24N-GFP and 20 μl/ml LipofectAMINE. Cells were selected for 2 weeks with hygromycin (150 μg/ml) and neomycin (400 μg/ml) and sorted for GFP by flow cytometry (6McConalogue K. Dery O. Lovett M. Wong H. Walsh J.H. Grady E.F. Bunnett N.W.

To express constructs transiently, KNRK-NK1R cells were incubated for 2 h with 5 μg/ml cDNA and 20 μl/ml LipofectAMINE, and cells were studied after 72 h. For controls, cells were transfected with empty vector without insert. Transiently transfected cells were used for microscopy, and stable cell lines were studied in all other experiments. Western Blotting—Cell lysates (25 μg of protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE (13% acrylamide gels). Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA) and blocked for 1 h at room temperature (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 2% BSA, 5% milk powder, 0.1% Tween 20). Blots were incubated with antibodies to Rab4a (1:2000), Rab5a (1:1000), Rab11a (1:5000), or GFP (1:10,000) overnight at 4 °C (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 5% milk powder, 2% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20). Membranes were washed for 30 min (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20) and were incubated with secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000, 1 h, room temperature). Membranes were washed for 30 min, and immunoreactive proteins were visualized by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate; Pierce). Microscopy and Immunofluorescence—Cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus 0.1% BSA with 1 or 10 nm SP for 60 min at 4 °C or 10 min at 37 °C, washed, and incubated for 0–60 min at 37 °C. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 100 mm phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, for 20 min at 4 °C. Cells were incubated for 30 min in HBSS, 5% normal goat serum, and 0.05% saponin. The NK1R was detected using mouse FLAG antibody M2 (10 μg/ml, overnight at 4 °C) and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200, 1 h, room temperature). β-arrestin 1 and Rab4a, -5a, and -11a were detected using GFP. In some experiments, cells were incubated with 100 nm SP labeled with Texas Red or 50 μg/ml Texas Red-conjugated transferrin for 10 min at 37 °C, washed, and fixed. Cells were observed by confocal microscopy (15Grady E.F. Garland A.M. Gamp P.D. Lovett M. Payan D.G. Bunnett N.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 509-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Measurement of [Ca2+]i—NK1R signaling was assessed by measuring SP-induced Ca2+ mobilization. KNRK cells were incubated with 2.5 μm fura-2 for 25 min at 37 °C and washed, and fluorescence was measured at 340- and 380-nm excitation and 510-nm emission in a F-2000 spectrophotometer (Hitachi Instruments, Irvine, CA). The ratio of the fluorescence at the two excitation wavelengths, which is proportional to [Ca2+]i, was calculated (37Vigna S.R. Bowden J.J. McDonald D.M. Fisher J. Okamoto A. McVey D.C. Payan D.G.

SP Binding—To determine the rate of uptake of SP, cells were incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/BSA containing 100,000 cpm of [propyl-2,4–3,4-3H]SP and 1 or 10 nm unlabeled SP for 0–10 min at 37 °C. Cells were placed on ice, washed with ice-cold HBSS, pH 7.4, and washed in acid to separate cell surface (acid-labile) from internalized (acid-resistant) label (38Garland A.M. Grady E.F. Payan D.G. Vigna S.R. Bunnett N.W. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 177-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold HBSS, pH 5.0, with acetic acid and lysed with 1 m NaOH, 0.1% SDS, and the lysate was counted. To assess the loss and recovery of binding sites for SP, cells were incubated with 1 or 10 nm SP in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/BSA for 10 min at 37 °C, washed, and incubated at 37 °C for 0–20 min. Cells were placed on ice, washed with ice-cold HBSS, pH 5.0, to remove surface SP, and incubated with 100,000 cpm of [3H]SP for 90 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed in acid to measure surface binding. The affinity of the NK1R and the number of surface binding sites for SP were determined by Scatchard analysis after stimulation with 1 or 10 nm SP for 10 min at 37 °C. To do so, cells were incubated in HBSS/BSA for 90 min at 4 °C with 0.001–100 nm SP and 100,000 cpm [3H]SP. Unbound SP was washed off with HBSS, and surface-bound [3H]SP was eluted with acid and counted. In all experiments, nonspecific binding was determined in cells treated with 1 μm SP.

However, the concentration dependence of SP-induced redistribution of the NK1R and β-arrestins has not been examined. We incubated KNRK-NK1R cells transiently expressing β-arrestin 1-GFP with graded concentrations of SP and localized the NK1R by immunofluorescence and β-arrestin 1 using GFP. In unstimulated cells, the NK1R was at the cell surface, and β-arrestin 1-GFP was in the cytosol (Fig. 1A). Incubation with 1 or 10 nm SP for 60 min at 4 °C induced membrane translocation of β-arrestin 1 to a similar degree (Fig. 1B). To examine NK1R trafficking, we stimulated the cells for 10 min at 37 °C with 1 or 10 nm SP, washed the cells, and incubated at 37 °C for various times. After 10 nm SP (10 min, 37 °C), both the NK1R and β-arrestin 1 were colocalized in endosomes mostly in a perinuclear location, where they remained colocalized for at least 60 min (Fig. 2A). This sequestration of β-arrestin 1 into endosomes was sufficient to deplete β-arrestin 1 from the cytosol until 60 min. After 1 nm SP (10 min, 37 °C), the NK1R and β-arrestin 1 were colocalized exclusively to endosomes located immediately beneath the plasma membrane (Fig. 2B). After washing, there was some translocation to a perinuclear compartment, but the NK1R and β-arrestin 1 were prominently colocalized in superficial vesicles. Within 5–30 min, the NK1R recycled to the cell surface, and β-arrestin 1 translocated to the cytosol. Thus, high concentrations of SP induce prolonged sequestration of NK1R and β-arrestin 1 into perinuclear endosomes, thereby depleting β-arrestins from the cytosol. In contrast, low concentrations of SP result in a brief association of NK1R and β-arrestin 1 in superficial endosomes, followed by rapid recycling of the NK1R to the cell surface and redistribution of β-arrestin 1 to the cytosol. We similarly examined trafficking of the NK1R in cells that were not transfected with β-arrestin 1-GFP and obtained the same results (not shown), suggesting that overexpression of β-arrestin 1 does not influence NK1R trafficking.Fig. 2SP-induced trafficking of β-arrestin 1-GFP. KNRK-NK1R cells were incubated with 10 nm SP (A) or 1 nm SP (B) for 10 min at 37 °C, washed, and incubated for 0–60 min at 37 °C. Cells were fixed, and the NK1R was localized by immunofluorescence using anti-FLAG and β-arrestin 1 (βARR1) by GFP. Stimulation with 10 nm SP induced endocytosis of β-arrestin 1 and the NK1R into superficial and perinuclear endosomes for at least 60 min. After 60 min, there was some return of β-arrestin 1 to the cytosol. Stimulation with 1 nm SP induced endocytosis of β-arrestin 1 and the NK1R into superficial endosomes that moved to a perinuclear location only at later time points. However, there was minimal depletion of β-arrestin 1 from the cytosol. Within 30 min of recovery, the NK1R was detected at the cell surface. Scale bar, 10 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Expression of Wild-type and Mutant Rab Proteins—To evaluate the contributions of Rab GTPases to SP-induced trafficking and signaling of the NK1R, we overexpressed wild-type Rab4a, -5a, and -11a or the GTP binding-deficient mutants Rab4aS24N, Rab5aS34N, and Rab11aS25N in KNRK-NK1R cells. Rab proteins were tagged with GFP for detection. We first examined the relative levels of expression of the Rab-GFP constructs by Western blotting using an antibody to GFP. Rab-GFP proteins of the anticipated apparent molecular mass (∼55 kDa; Rab (∼25 kDa) + GFP (∼30 kDa)) were detected in all cell lines (Fig. 3A, lanes 2–7). All constructs were expressed at comparable levels with the exception of Rab11aS25N-GFP, which was consistently expressed at lower levels. Specificity of the GFP antiserum was confirmed by analysis of KNRK-NK1R cells, where no GFP immunoreactivity was detected (Fig. 3A, lane 1). We then compared the relative levels of expression of endogenous Rabs with the transfected GFP-tagged Rabs by Western blotting using antibodies to Rab4a, Rab5a, and Rab11a. In KNRK-NK1R cells, antibodies to Rab5a (Fig. 3C, lane 1) and Rab11a (Fig. 3D, lane 1) detected single proteins of the anticipated apparent weight, although the antibody to Rab4a detected several additional unidentified proteins (Fig. 3B, lane 1). In the Rab-transfected cell lines, wild-type and mutant Rab4a-GFP and Rab5a-GFP constructs were expressed at levels that were markedly higher than those of endogenous Rab4a and -5a (Fig. 3, B and C). The relative levels of expression were compared by densitometry. Rab4a-GFP was expressed 8.5-fold higher, Rab4aS24N 6.4-fold higher, Rab5a 2.7-fold higher, and Rab5aS34N 3.5-fold higher than the endogenous Rabs. Although wild-type Rab11a-GFP was expressed at levels comparable with that of the endogenous Rab11a (0.7-fold), Rab11aS25N-GFP was expressed at consistently lower levels than endogenous Rab11a (0.3-fold) (Fig. 3D). However, these comparisons of the levels of expression of endogenous Rabs in rat-derived KNRK cells and the overexpressed canine Rabs may be complicated by differences in the interaction of the Rab antibodies with Rabs from different species. Together, these results confirm expression of wild-type and mutated Rabs in the transfected cell lines. Rab5a-mediated Trafficking of NK1R from Superficial Vesicles to Endosomes in a Perinuclear Location—We have shown that Alexa594-labeled SP (10–100 nm) colocalizes with Rab5a in early endosomes and that expression of the GTP binding-deficient mutant Rab5aS34N partially"
https://openalex.org/W2068060690,"PDE4 splice variants are classified into long and short forms depending on the presence or absence of two unique N-terminal domains termed upstream conserved regions 1 and 2 (UCR1 and -2). We have shown previously that the UCR module mediates dimerization of PDE4 long forms, whereas short forms, which lack UCR1, behave as monomers. In the present study, we demonstrate that dimerization is an essential structural element that determines the regulatory properties and inhibitor sensitivities of PDE4 enzymes. Comparing the properties of the dimeric wild type PDE4D3 with several monomeric mutant PDE4D3 constructs revealed that disruption of dimerization ablates the activation of PDE4 long forms by either protein kinase A phosphorylation or phosphatidic acid binding. Moreover, the analysis of heterodimers consisting of a catalytically active and a catalytically inactive PDE4D3 subunit indicates that protein kinase A phosphorylation of both subunits is essential to fully activate PDE4 enzymes. In addition to affecting enzyme regulation, disruption of dimerization reduces the sensitivity of the enzymes toward the prototypical PDE4 inhibitor rolipram. Parallel binding assays indicated that this shift in rolipram sensitivity is likely mediated by a decrease in the number of inhibitor binding sites in the high affinity rolipram binding state. Thus, although dimerization is not a requirement for high affinity rolipram binding, it functions to stabilize PDE4 long forms in their high affinity rolipram binding conformation. Taken together, our data indicate that dimerization defines the properties of PDE4 enzymes and suggest a common structural and functional organization for all PDEs."

The cAMP-dependent protein kinase A pathway governs the majority of these effects, but recent evidence also implicates the MAPK pathway. MC3T3-E1 subclone 4 cells (MC4) were treated with the MAPK inhibitor U0126 and PTHrP. In differentiated MC4 cells, osteocalcin and bone sialoprotein gene expression were both down-regulated by PTHrP and also by inhibition of the MAPK pathway. PTHrP-mediated down-regulation of PTH-1R mRNA and up-regulation of c-fos mRNA were MAPK-independent, whereas PTHrP stimulation of fra-2 and interleukin-6 (IL-6) mRNA was MAPK-dependent. Luciferase promoter assays revealed that regulation of IL-6 involved the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and MAPK pathways with a potential minor role of the protein kinase C pathway, and a promoter region containing an activator protein-1 site was necessary for PTHrP-induced IL-6 gene transcription. An alternative pathway, through cAMP/Epac/Rap1/MAPK, mediated ERK phosphorylation but was not sufficient for IL-6 promoter activation. Phosphorylation of the transcription factor CREB was also necessary but not sufficient for PTHrP-mediated IL-6 promoter activity. Most interesting, a bidirectional effect was found with PTHrP increasing phosphorylated ERK in undifferentiated MC4 cells but decreasing phosphorylated ERK in differentiated cells. These data indicate that inactivation of the MAPK pathway shows differential regulation of PTHrP-stimulated activator protein-1 members, blocks PTHrP-stimulated IL-6, and synergistically down-regulates certain osteoblastic markers associated with differentiation.

However, the dependence on these and other signaling pathways for the various skeletal effects of PTH and PTHrP is still unclear.At the cellular level, the PKA pathway governs the majority of the effects induced by PTH and PTHrP on osteoblasts, but recent evidence (3Chan G.K.

Taken together, these studies suggest that MAPK plays an important role in the actions of PTH and PTHrP in bone, but the precise pathways are still unclear. We have shown previously that PTHrP induces apoptosis in postconfluent osteoblastic cells but plays a protective role against apoptosis in less differentiated osteoblasts suggesting that actions of PTH and PTHrP may be cell context-dependent (17Chen H.

The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of MAPK on actions of PTHrP in normal osteoblasts.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—Human PTH-(1–34) and PTHrP-(1–34) were obtained from Bachem (Torrance, CA). U0126 and the dual luciferase assay system were obtained from Promega (Madison, WI). The Epac analogue 8CPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP was obtained from Axxora LLC (San Diego, CA).

Briefly, cells were cultured in minimum essential α-medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) and 100 units/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were passaged every 4–5 days and were not used beyond passage 15. For differentiation studies, MC4 cells were plated at 50,000 cells/cm2 and induced to differentiate with the addition of ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml). After 5–7 days, the cells displayed maximal expression of PTH-1 receptor as previously described (21McCauley L.K. Koh A.J. Beecher C.A. Cui Y. Rosol T.J. Franceschi R.T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 638-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Cells were then pretreated with U0126 (20 μm) for 2 h, GF109203X (1 μm) for 30 min, or H-89 (20 μm) for 30 min, and the pretreatment remained in the incubation medium for the duration of the PTHrP (0.1 μm) treatment as indicated.Transient Transfection and Luciferase Reporter Assays—MC4 cells were plated in 12-well plates at a density of 2.5 × 104 cells/cm2 with 10% fetal bovine serum minimum essential α-medium without penicillin and streptomycin. After 24 h of incubation, cells were transfected with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All cDNAs were transfected at a concentration of 0.9–1.0 μg per 1 × 105 cells. Each transfection contained a combination of 0.7 μgof the luciferase reporter plasmid and 0.2 μg of pRL-SV40 or a combination of 0.7 μg of investigating plasmid (Rap1GAP, CREB133 or CREB), 0.2 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid, and 0.1 μg of pRL-SV40. Following transfection, cells were allowed to recover in serum-containing media for 20 h. Cells were then treated as indicated and harvested, and luciferase levels were measured using a Monolight 3010 luminometer (BD Biosciences).Northern Blot Analysis—Cells were plated at 50,000 cells/cm2 in 60-mm dishes and induced to differentiate with the addition of ascorbic acid (50 μg/ml) for 5–7 days. Without differentiation, cells were plated at 25,000 cells/cm2 in 100-mm dishes. Cells were then treated with U0126 (20 μm) and PTHrP-(1–34) (0.1 μm) as indicated, and RNA isolation and Northern blot analysis were performed as described previously (22McCauley L.K. Beecher C.A.

Blots were stripped and probed with a complementary DNA for 18 S ribosomal RNA (28Renkawitz R. Gerbi S.A. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 173: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) to control for RNA loading.Western Blot Analysis—MC4 cells were plated at 50,000 cells/cm2 in 60-mm dishes and treated with 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid for 5–7 days for differentiation. Without differentiation, cells were plated at 25,000 cells/cm2 in 100-mm dishes. After being treated with PTHrP-(1–34) (0.1 μm) for various time points with or without U0126 (20 μm) pretreatment, proteins were isolated for Western blot analysis as described previously (29McCauley L.K.

The proteins were separated by 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.85% NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) with 5% non-fat dry milk for 1 h and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with diluted primary antibodies in TBST. The dilution factor was 1:1000 for p44/42 MAPK antibody and phosphorylated p44/42 MAPK antibody (Thr-202/Tyr-204). After three washes with TBST and incubation for 1 h with secondary antibody, membranes were washed five times with TBST and developed by ECL chemiluminescent detection according to protocols supplied by the manufacturer.Statistical Analysis—The results of experiments were analyzed using analysis of variance followed by a Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test or Student's t test, with the Instat 2.1 biostatistics program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). All experiments were performed in duplicate or triplicate and repeated 2–3 times with consistent results.RESULTSEffects of PTHrP and U0126 on Osteoblast-related Gene Expression—PTH and PTHrP are known to regulate various genes pertinent to osteoblast function. Three down-regulated genes (OCN, BSP, and the type I PTH/PTHrP receptor, PTH-1R) and three up-regulated genes (c-fos, fra-2, and interleukin-6) in response to PTH and PTHrP were selected for evaluation. To determine whether the MAPK pathway has an impact in the PTHrP regulation of these genes, a specific ERK1/2 phosphorylation inhibitor, U0126, was employed by pretreating cells before PTHrP administration. PTHrP significantly down-regulated OCN (90%), BSP (40%), and PTH-1R (40%) compared with vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 1). U0126 alone also decreased OCN and BSP but not PTH-1R suggesting that basal expression of OCN and BSP is partially dependent on the MAPK pathway. The addition of U0126 did not alter PTHrP-mediated decreases in OCN and PTH-1R but did further decrease BSP expression compared with PTHrP treatment alone suggesting that the MAPK pathway is in part responsible for the PTHrP regulation of BSP in osteoblasts. However, at the time point evaluated for these three genes down-regulated by PTHrP, there could be other indirect effects of inhibiting MAPK. Gene expression for IL-6 and the AP-1 transcription factors fra-2 and c-fos were significantly induced by PTHrP 5-, 11-, and 2.5-fold, respectively (Fig. 2). The PTHrP increase in IL-6 expression was significantly blocked by U0126. The PTHrP induction of fra-2 was partially blocked by U0126, but U0126 had no effect on PTHrP-induced c-fos gene expression. These data suggest that in differentiated osteoblasts, basal gene expression for OCN and BSP is partially dependent on the MAPK pathway. Furthermore, the actions of PTHrP on BSP, IL-6, and fra-2 gene expression are modified by blocking the MAPK pathway indicating that the MAPK pathway selectively impacts some PTH-responsive genes in osteoblastic cells.Fig. 2Effects of PTHrP and U0126 on c-fos, fra-2, and IL-6 mRNA gene expression. MC4 cells were induced to differentiate with ascorbic acid for 5 days, pretreated for 2 h with U0126 (20 μm), and treated for 2 (fra-2 and IL-6) or 1 h (c-fos) with PTHrP-(1–34) (0.1 μm).

Effects at the transcriptional level were examined by using full-length pGL2-IL6p-(–1200) luciferase reporter plasmids, which contain the proximal promoter of human IL-6 gene for transcription factor activity, and various truncated or mutant constructs derived from pGL2-IL6p-(–1200) (Fig. 3A). PTHrP concentrations from 0.1 nm to 1 μm significantly increased the full-length IL-6 promoter activity, with 10 and 100 nm having the maximal effect (Fig. 3B). PTHrP treatment at 4, 6, and 8 h increased full-length IL-6 promoter activity, and U0126 pretreatment significantly decreased PTHrP effects (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, to investigate how PTHrP regulates transcription factors important in IL-6 promoter activity, various IL-6 promoter constructs were used for analysis. Basal activity of truncated 225- and 160-bp IL-6 promoter fragments was increased 2-fold compared with the basal activity of the full-length promoter fragment. There was a 10-fold increase in IL-6 luciferase activity with PTHrP treatment of cells transfected with the 1200-bp promoter (Fig. 3D). PTHrP stimulation of the truncated 225- and 160-bp promoter fragments was reduced to a net 3.6-fold increase compared with the basal activity. Furthermore, losing the region between –225 and –160, which contains a cAMP-response element (CRE)-binding site, did not alter this effect. These results suggest that the region containing the activator protein-1 (AP-1) site is important for the PTHrP stimulation, and this same region is associated with repression of basal promoter activity. This result also suggests that the AP-1-binding site might have regulation priority over the CRE-binding site for IL-6 transcription activation. Furthermore, inhibition of MAPK with U0126 blocked 30% of the stimulatory effects of PTHrP on the truncated 225- and 160-bp promoter fragments. In contrast, promoter activity with the nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) mutant 225-bp promoter fragment was dramatically reduced. However, the basal level and PTHrP stimulation were both reduced (Fig. 3D, see inset with expanded scale). This suggests that NFκB is important for IL-6 basal expression but not for PTHrP stimulation. Taken together, these data suggest that the AP-1 site-containing region between –1200 and –225 is important for PTHrP-mediated activation of IL-6 promoter, and the NFκB site is important for basal IL-6 promoter activity. Because the AP-1 site of the IL-6 promoter was important for PTHrP-mediated stimulation of IL-6, the dependence of regulation of AP-1 on MAPK was evaluated. MC4 cells were transfected with pAP1(PMA)-TA-Luc luciferase vector containing AP-1 enhancer and minimal TA promoter. PTHrP up-regulated the AP-1-driven luciferase activity, but inhibition of MAPK by U0126 did not block this effect (Fig. 3E). Thus, PTHrP regulation of the IL-6 promoter is dependent on AP-1, but the MAPK pathway does not specifically target AP-1 at the level of transcription. The promoter analyses require transfection of nonconfluent cells, which are not differentiated. Because the luciferase assay revealed that IL-6 promoter activity was up-regulated by PTHrP in undifferentiated cells, whereas IL-6 mRNA was up-regulated by PTHrP in differentiated cells (Fig. 2), IL-6 gene expression of undifferentiated MC4 cells was examined. Northern blot analysis showed that IL-6 mRNA gene expression in undifferentiated MC4 cells was also significantly increased by PTHrP and repressed by U0126 (42%) (Fig. 3F), following a similar pattern as found in differentiated cells (Fig. 2A). This suggests that PTHrP increases IL-6 gene expression both in undifferentiated and differentiated cells in a partially MAPK-dependent manner.Fig. 3PTHrP activates the IL-6 promoter in a MAPK-dependent manner. A, diagram of IL-6 promoter constructs. The 5′-region of the IL-6 promoter was progressively deleted by selective restriction digests of pGL2-IL6p-(–1200) followed by religation. Several response elements are indicated. GRE, glucocorticoid receptor response element; AP-1, activator protein-1; CRE, cAMP-response element; C/EBP-β, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein β. B, PTHrP induction of IL-6 promoter activity is dose-dependent. MC4 cells were cotransfected with pGL2-IL6p-(–1200) and pRL-SV40 Renilla luciferase normalization plasmids. After 20 h, cells were treated with vehicle or PTHrP-(1–34) (1 pm to 1 μm) for 6 h. The cell extract was collected for measurement of luciferase activity.

MC4 cells were cotransfected with pGL2-IL6p-(–1200) and pRL-SV40 Renilla luciferase plasmids. After 20 h, cells were pretreated with U0126 (20 μm) for 2 h, followed by PTHrP-(1–34) (0.1 μm) treatment for the indicated times. The cell extract was collected for measurement of luciferase activity. *, p < 0.05 versus PTHrP-treated groups. D, PTHrP regulation of IL-6 promoter. MC4 cells were transfected with different IL-6 promoter constructs or pGL2 Basic luciferase vectors. Cells were then treated with U0126 (2 h) and PTHrP (6 h).

Inset shows NFκB mutant and plasmid controls on an expanded scale. Loss of the IL-6 promoter that contains an AP-1 site resulted in a significant but not total reduction of PTHrP activation of the IL-6 promoter. Inhibition of MAPK reduced PTHrP stimulation of IL-6 by nearly 50% regardless of the promoter length. E, impact of MAPK on PTH-stimulated AP-1. MC4 cells were transfected with AP-1 luciferase vectors, pretreated with U0126 (20 μm) or control for 2 h, and then treated with PTH-(1–34) (0.1 μm) for 6 h. The representative results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. n = 3/group. *, p < 0.01 versus control or U0126. PTHrP increased AP-1 activity, but inhibition of MAPK did not alter the PTHrP stimulation of AP-1. F, undifferentiated MC4 cells were pretreated with U0126 (20 μm) for 2 h and treated with PTHrP-(1–34) (0.1 μm) for another 2 h.

MC4 cells were transfected with either IL-6 promoter-driven luciferase reporter plasmids or promoterless pGL2-Basic and Renilla luciferase normalization plasmids. After 20 h of incubation, MC4 cells were pretreated with the selective inhibitor U0126 (MAPK), GF109203X (PKC), or H-89 (PKA) alone or with PTHrP. As shown in Fig. 4, inhibition of PKA by the addition of H-89 resulted in the most striking reduction in both basal and PTHrP-stimulated IL-6 promoter activity. GF109203X and U0126 resulted in less but still significant reductions. However, the 18% reduction by GF109203X could involve nonspecific effects of the inhibitor, because the PKC activator, PMA alone, did not activate the IL-6 promoter. These results suggest that PKC may only have a minor role in IL-6 promoter activity. This study with inhibitors suggests that PTHrP-induced IL-6 transcription requires PKA and MAPK pathways, and PKC activation alone cannot replicate the PTHrP activation of the IL-6 promoter.Fig. 4Stimulation of IL-6 promoter activity by PTHrP is PKA- and MAPK-dependent. MC4 cells were pretreated with the PKC inhibitor GF109203X (1 μm) for 30 min, MAPK inhibitor U0126 (20 μm) for 2 h, or PKA inhibitor H-89 (20 μm) for 30 min and then treated with PTHrP-(1–34) (0.1 μm), vehicle, or PMA alone (1 μm) for 6 h. Cell extracts were collected and measured for luciferase activity.

To investigate the effect of basic carboxypeptidases on fibrinolysis under conditions of constant carboxypeptidase activity, we employed pancreatic carboxypeptidase B (CPB), a homologous, stable basic carboxypeptidase, as a surrogate for TAFIa. Clots formed from TAFI-depleted plasma or from purified components were supplemented with tissue-type plasminogen activator and either CPB or TAFIa. The clot lysis data indicate that the down-regulation of fibrinolysis mediated by basic carboxypeptidases involves a threshold mechanism. At carboxypeptidase concentrations above the threshold, plasminogen activation is maintained in a fully down-regulated state; experiments in plasma showed that fibrinolysis is essentially halted by saturating concentrations of TAFIa and that fibrinolysis can be prolonged more than 45-fold by a stable carboxypeptidase. The threshold carboxypeptidase concentration was dependent on tissue-type plasminogen activator and antiplasmin concentrations, indicating that the threshold is determined by the steady-state plasmin concentration. Although obvious with CPB, the threshold was masked by the intrinsic instability of TAFIa and became apparent only when the effect of TAFIa was investigated over the picomolar concentration range. Because of the threshold effect and the instability of TAFIa, exponential increases in TAFIa concentration generate linear increases in lysis time. A model relating lysis time to TAFIa concentration, TAFIa half-life, and the threshold concentration of TAFIa is provided.

Given the central role that C-terminal basic amino acids play in the regulation of fibrinolysis, it is not surprising that their removal from the degraded fibrin surface is also enzymatically controlled.

Of particular importance, CPB is a stable enzyme, whereas TAFIa displays temperature-dependent instability; essentially stable at 4 °C, the half-life of TAFIa activity ranges from 1.4 to 15 min at 37 °C, depending on the particular isoform studied (23Boffa M.B.

Once activated, the chimera displayed a half-life of activity toward small substrates of ∼1.5 h. Unfortunately, the activated TAFI-CPB293–401 chimera lost its antifibrinolytic potential, most likely due to a loss of substrate specificity for plasmin degraded fibrin.

Activase, the recombinant tPA, was a kind gift from Dr. Gordon Vehar at Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Soluble thrombomodulin (Solulin) was the generous gift of Dr. John Morser at Berlex Biosciences (Richmond, CA). Pooled normal human plasma and protein C-deficient human plasma were obtained from Affinity Biologicals (Ancaster, ON, Canada). TAFI and TAFI-deficient human plasma (TdP) were simultaneously prepared from normal human plasma by immunodepletion as previously described (33Bajzar L. Nesheim M.E. Tracy P.B. Blood. 1996; 88: 2093-2100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Human plasminogen was purified from normal human plasma on lysine-Sepharose as previously described (34Walker J.B. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol.

Human antiplasmin was purified from plasminogen-depleted normal human plasma using affinity chromatography over plasminogen-derived kringle-Sepharose as previously described (35Wiman B. Biochem.

The purified plasminogen and antiplasmin preparations were depleted of contaminating TAFI by chromatography over anti-TAFI-Sepharose as per TdP. Ancrod, the thrombin-like enzyme from the venom of the malayan pit viper Agkistrodon rhodostoma was from Abbott Laboratories (Montreal, PQ, Canada) and was obtained from the Henderson General Hospital pharmacy (Hamilton, ON, Canada) as a 70 IU/ml isotonic saline solution (Viprinex®). l-α-Phosphatidylcholine (PC), l-α-phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and l-α-phosphatidylserine (PS) were obtained in chloroform from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). PC:PE:PS (60:20:20) phospholipid vesicles were made according to the procedure of Barenholz et al. (36Barenholz Y. Gibbes D. Litman B.J. Goll J. Thompson T.E. Carlson R.D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2806-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). Clot Lysis Experiments Using Either TAFI-deficient Plasma or Purified Components—Clots were formed in the wells of a microtiter plate from (13)-diluted TdP or from purified fibrinogen (3 μm), plasminogen (0.7 μm), and antiplasmin (0–1 μm) and were supplemented with tPA (0.1–0.56 nm) and either TAFIa (0–250 nm) or CPB (0–25 nm). CaCl2 was present in all clot lysis experiments at 10 mm. TAFIa was produced from TAFI by incubating 1 μm TAFI in an activating solution comprising 30 nm thrombin, 30–50 nm Solulin, and 5 mm CaCl2 in 0.02 m Hepes, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01% Tween 80, pH 7.4 (HBST) for 15 min at room temperature. Dilutions of TAFIa were made in the same activating solution. A working solution of CPB in HBST was made 30 nm in thrombin, and dilutions were made using 30 nm thrombin in HBST as the diluent. Clotting was initiated by the addition of TAFIa or CPB such that the final concentration of thrombin was either 6 nm (experiments where [TAFIa] ≤200 nm) or 7.5 nm (experiments where [TAFIa] >200 nm). Plates were sealed with clear tape, and the turbidity of each clot was monitored at 405 nm using a SpectraMax Plus Platereader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) thermostatted at 37 °C. The lysis time, the time at which the turbidity of the clot equals one-half of the full-scale value, was determined for each clot. The maximum time elapsed between TAFIa dilution and the start of any experiment was less than 20 min. In each case, clotting was essentially complete by the start of the experiment. Clot Lysis Experiments in Protein C-deficient Plasma—Clots were formed in the wells of a microtiter plate from (13)-diluted protein C-deficient human plasma supplemented with tPA (0.6 nm), PC:PE:PS vesicles (10 μm), and Solulin (50 nm) in the absence or presence of protein C (125 nm). Clotting was initiated by the addition of Ancrod (1 IU/ml) and CaCl2 (10 mm) in HBST. The turbidity of each clot was monitored at 37 °C as above. The concentrations for all components listed above are given as the final concentration in the clot. The CPB-mediated Prolongation of Plasma Clot Lysis Exhibits a Threshold Effect That Is Not Apparent with TAFIa—Fig. 1 shows a comparison of the effects of TAFIa and CPB on plasma clot lysis. Clots formed from (13)-diluted TdP were supplemented with various concentrations of either TAFIa or CPB. Lysis, initiated with tPA, was followed by turbidity. The figure shows that the addition of an unstable carboxypeptidase, TAFIa (A), yielded a markedly different effect on clot lysis time than did the addition of a stable carboxypeptidase, CPB (B). TAFIa achieved a 2-fold prolongation of lysis by 6.25 nm TAFIa, and this was extended to a 3-fold prolongation by 200 nm TAFIa. This stands in stark contrast to the effect seen with CPB; lysis was prolonged 2-fold by 3 nm CPB, 28-fold by 10 nm CPB, and by more than 45-fold (lysis time, >70 h) at 20 nm CPB. The dose-response curves of the two carboxypeptidases are shown in Fig. 2. As expected, the effect of TAFIa was saturable and displayed a maximal 3-fold prolongation of lysis. This was not the case with CPB. The figure shows that the prolongation of lysis mediated by CPB exhibited a threshold effect; the effect of CPB on lysis was modest up to ∼3 nm, after which the increase in clot lysis time became disproportional to the change in CPB concentration. This effect is highlighted in the inset, which also shows that TAFIa was the more effective down-regulator of fibrinolysis at lower concentrations.Fig. 2The dose-response curves of TAFIa and CPB in plasma clot lysis. The lysis time, the time at which the turbidity equals one-half of the full scale value, was determined for each profile in Fig. 1, and the values were plotted against the carboxypeptidase concentration. The figure shows the relative lysis time, the lysis time observed in the presence of carboxypeptidase divided by the lysis time observed in the absence of carboxypeptidase. The effect of TAFIa (triangles) appeared saturable and yielded a 3-fold prolongation. In contrast, the effect of CPB (circles) exhibited threshold behavior, i.e. a point was reached after which the effect of CPB became disproportional to the concentration. This is highlighted in the inset, which also shows that TAFIa was the more effective enzyme at the lower carboxypeptidase concentrations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The Effect of CPB on the Relative Clot Lysis Time Is Highly Dependent on tPA Concentration, Whereas the Effect of TAFIa Is Not—To further investigate the threshold effect observed with CPB, we varied the concentration of tPA in the lysis experiments. Fig. 3 shows the relative lysis times of clots formed in TdP with various concentrations of tPA in the absence and presence of various concentrations of TAFIa (A) or CPB (B). The figure shows that the threshold effect observed with CPB was dependent on the concentration of tPA. As the concentration of tPA decreased, the threshold concentration of CPB also decreased. The threshold concentrations of CPB were approximately >10, 10, 3, 1, and 0.75 nm at tPA concentrations of 0.40, 0.30 0.20, 0.15, and 0.10 nm, respectively. The lysis of clots formed in the presence of TAFIa did not display the threshold effect observed with CPB at any of the tPA concentrations tested. However, the magnitude of the apparent saturation in relative lysis time appeared to increase with increasing tPA concentration. The Effect of CPB on the Lysis of Clots Formed from Purified Components Is Highly Dependent on the Antiplasmin Concentration, Whereas the Effect of TAFIa Is Not—Because plasma is an extremely complex milieu, we continued our investigation of the effects of carboxypeptidase stability on clot lysis in a simpler system consisting of purified fibrinogen, plasminogen, antiplasmin, tPA, thrombin, and carboxypeptidase. To ensure minimal contamination from endogenous TAFI, the purified preparations of antiplasmin and plasminogen were immunodepleted of TAFI. The relationship between antiplasmin concentration, TAFIa/CPB concentration, and clot lysis time is shown in Fig. 4. The relationship between lysis time and carboxypeptidase concentration at the various antiplasmin concentrations is shown using linear (A and B) or logarithmic (C and D) scales for TAFIa (A and C) and CPB (B and D) concentrations. Interestingly, neither TAFIa nor CPB appreciably prolonged the lysis of clots in the absence of antiplasmin. The series of offset but essentially identical curves (A) shows that the effect of TAFIa was saturable at all antiplasmin concentrations. The CPB-mediated prolongation of lysis was also shown to be saturable (B), with the maximal prolongation dependent on the concentration of antiplasmin present in the clot. The semi-log plot showing the log-linear relationship between lysis time and TAFIa (C) demonstrates that an exponential increase in TAFIa concentration yields only a linear increase in lysis time, as was observed in plasma (Fig. 1). The semi-log plot in D illustrates the threshold behavior of the antifibrinolytic effect in the presence of a stable carboxypeptidase, CPB. Finally panels E and F show the absolute clot lysis times at various carboxypeptidase concentrations versus antiplasmin concentrations. In the absence of carboxypeptidase, clot lysis time was essentially linear with respect to antiplasmin concentration up to 1.0 μm antiplasmin. With TAFIa (E) the plot yields a series of essentially parallel lines, indicating that the prolongation mediated by a given concentration of TAFIa was the same regardless of the antiplasmin concentration. This was not the case with CPB (F), where the series of increasing curves indicates that the prolongation of lysis was highly dependent on the concentration of antiplasmin. The Effect of TAFIa on Fibrinolysis Displays Threshold Behavior over the Picomolar Concentration Range—The relationship between TAFIa concentration and lysis time in Fig. 4 was found to be log-linear from 0.27 to 200 nm TAFIa. However, whether or not the relationship holds true at very low TAFIa concentrations has not been determined. In other words the question remains, what is the minimum TAFIa concentration required to exhibit an effect on lysis? Although this question may seem trivial, it has bearing on the potential physiological relevance of TAFIa, particularly under conditions in which TAFI activation may be ongoing. To address this, we investigated the effect of TAFIa on clot lysis over the picomolar concentration range in the absence and presence of various concentrations of antiplasmin. Fig. 5 shows the lysis time (A) and the absolute prolongation of lysis time (B) versus log([TAFIa]) in the absence and presence of various concentrations of antiplasmin. The figure shows that the effect of TAFIa on fibrinolysis over the picomolar concentration range was biphasic; clot lysis time was essentially unaffected until some threshold concentration of TAFIa was reached, after which the prolongation of clot lysis became log-linear with respect to TAFIa. As with CPB (Fig. 4), the threshold concentration is shown to be inversely related to the antiplasmin concentration. TAFIa Essentially Halts the Progression of Fibrinolysis— Although it is apparent that TAFIa inhibits fibrinolysis, plasminogen activation still occurs in the presence of TAFIa (10Schneider M. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13333-13339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 37Wang W. Boffa M.B. Bajzar L. Walker J.B. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27176-27181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine the degree to which basic carboxypeptidases retard the fibrinolytic process, we devised an experiment in which TAFI activation was temporally displaced from clotting and the subsequent initiation of lysis. To this end, clots were formed in (13)-diluted protein C-deficient human plasma supplemented with thrombomodulin (Solulin), PC: PE:PS vesicles, tPA, and CaCl2 in the absence and presence of protein C. To prevent the activation of the intrinsic coagulation cascade that results from the addition of exogenous thrombin, clotting was initiated with Ancrod. The experimental conditions were chosen such that only the clot lacking protein C generated the burst of thrombin induced by recalcification, and thus, TAFIa was generated only in the clot lacking protein C (data not shown). In this manner, TAFI activation occurred during the steep lytic phase of clot lysis. As shown in Fig. 6, the generation of TAFIa essentially halts fibrinolysis in plasma, even under conditions where 50% of the clot has been solubilized and the rate of fibrinolysis before TAFI activation is maximal. Modeling the Threshold Effect of TAFIa—In general, thresholds are intrinsic properties of systems as a whole rather than a specific property of a single component in the system (38Lewis J. Slack J.M.

Therefore, the amount of DAT at the cell surface is a critical determinant of DAT function. In this study, we examined the role of the carboxyl terminus of DAT in trafficking of the transporter through the biosynthetic pathway to the plasma membrane. Live cell fluorescence microscopy and cell surface biotinylation were used to study the effects of systematic deletions and alanine substitutions in the carboxyl terminus on DAT localization. It was found that alanine substitutions of Lys-590 and Asp-600 significantly delayed the delivery of DAT to the plasma membrane because of retention of DAT in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Most surprising, mutation of Gly-585 to alanine completely blocked the exit of DAT from the ER and surface expression of the transporter. The effect of these three mutations on ER export of DAT was demonstrated in porcine aortic endothelial cells and the immortalized neuronal cell line 1RB3AN27. In primary cultures of rat embryonic midbrain neurons, DAT G585A, K590A, and D600A mutants were restricted to the cell soma and did not traffic to the dendrites or axonal processes. These data are consistent with the model whereby the local conformation and/or intramolecular interactions of the sequences of the DAT carboxyl terminus proximal to the last transmembrane domain are essential for the ER export of the transporter.

Dopaminergic neurotransmission plays a critical role in modulation of a variety of central nervous system functions, including locomotor activity, cognition, and reward (1Cohen J.D. Braver T.S. Brown J.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Dopamine signaling is initiated by release of dopamine from the presynaptic neuron cell, and its duration and intensity are regulated primarily by the reuptake of dopamine back into the dopaminergic neurons by the plasma membrane dopamine transporter (DAT). 1The abbreviations used are: DAT, dopamine transporter; hDAT, human DAT; YFP and CFP, yellow and cyan fluorescent protein; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; FRETC, corrected FRET; PAE, porcine aortic endothelial; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; NET, norepinephrine transporter; SERT, serotonin transporter; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CMF, Ca2+, Mg2+-free; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; NHS, N-hydroxysuccinimide.1The abbreviations used are: DAT, dopamine transporter; hDAT, human DAT; YFP and CFP, yellow and cyan fluorescent protein; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; FRETC, corrected FRET; PAE, porcine aortic endothelial; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; EGF, epidermal growth factor; EGFR, EGF receptor; GFP, green fluorescent protein; NET, norepinephrine transporter; SERT, serotonin transporter; FBS, fetal bovine serum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CMF, Ca2+, Mg2+-free; PDI, protein-disulfide isomerase; NHS, N-hydroxysuccinimide. DAT belongs to the family of Na+/Cl--dependent plasma membrane neurotransmitter transporters, which includes the norepinephrine, serotonin (SERT), glycine, and γ-aminobutyric acid transporters (2Giros B. Caron M.G. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 43-49Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). DAT is a 620-amino acid polypeptide embedded in the lipid bilayer by 12 hydrophobic segments. Both amino and carboxyl termini are predicted to be intracellular. The second extracellular loop contains at least three consensus N-glycosylation sites (3Shimada S. Kitayama S. Lin C.L. Patel A. Nanthakumar E. Gregor P. Kuhar M. Uhl G. Science. 1991; 254: 576-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 4Chen J.-G. Liu-Chen S. Rudnick G. J. Biol.

Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8370-8378Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the mammalian brain, DAT is found in all parts of dopamine neurons, including in cell bodies and dendrites in substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area and in axonal termini in striatum and cerebral cortex. The maximal surface expression of DAT is detected in synapses located along the axonal processes in striatum and in distal regions of dendrites in the ventral tegmental area (6Nirenberg M.J. Chan J.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 5255-5262Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This specific targeting and the normal activity of DAT in neurons require efficient export of newly synthesized transporters from the ER, sorting to transport carriers in the Golgi complex, and delivery and retention of the transporters at the presynaptic functional sites. The amount of DAT at the cell surface is also regulated by endocytosis. Although all these trafficking processes are currently being investigated, in this study we focused on the transport of DAT from the ER. The molecular mechanisms of the efficient sorting of membrane multispanning proteins into coatomer COPII vesicles in the ER are not understood. Two sequence motifs in the cytoplasmic domains of transmembrane proteins, the di-acidic ((D/E)X(E/D), where X is any amino acid) and di-phenylalanine motifs, have been shown to mediate ER export (8Nishimura N. Balch W.E. Science. 1997; 277: 556-558Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar, 9Bannykh S.I. Nishimura N. Balch W.E.

Cell. 2000; 11: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). These motifs, however, have been identified only in a limited number of transmembrane proteins, and it is likely that other sequence motifs exist that are capable of serving as ER export signals. Recent studies of DAT in model cell expression systems have revealed a number of requirements for the normal transporter trafficking to the plasma membrane. The carboxyl terminus of human DAT (hDAT) has been demonstrated to be important for cell surface expression of DAT (12Torres G.E. Yao W.D. Mohn A.R. Quan H. Kim K.M. Levey A.I. Staudinger J.

The interaction of the last three residues of human DAT (LKV620) with the PDZ domain of PICK1 (protein that interacts with Ckinase) increases the efficiency of ER-to-plasma membrane trafficking of the transporter (12Torres G.E.

In contrast, DAT lacking the amino terminus is efficiently delivered to the cell surface (13Torres G.E. Carneiro A. Seamans K. Fiorentini C. Sweeney A. Yao W.-D. Caron M.G. J. Biol.

The oligomerization of DAT in the ER has also been proposed to be essential for the efficient ER export of the transporter (13Torres G.E. Carneiro A. Seamans K. Fiorentini C. Sweeney A. Yao W.-D.

A number of mutations within the transmembrane domains of DAT also resulted in inefficient ER exit (15Lin Z. Wang W. Uhl G.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1581-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 16Lin Z. Wang W. Kopajtic T. Revay R.S. Uhl G.R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 434-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The ER retention of these mutants is probably a consequence of either incorrect folding and/or disruption of the normal membrane translocation of the mutant DAT molecules in the ER. In the present study we performed an extensive mutagenesis analysis of the carboxyl-terminal tail of hDAT. This analysis revealed that in addition to the most distal three residues, several residues in the carboxyl terminus region proximal to the membrane are essential for transport of DAT from the ER to the plasma membrane in three types of cells, including immortalized neuronal cells and primary cultures of embryonic midbrain neurons. Plasmids and Mutations—YFP-DAT, CFP-DAT, YFP-ΔN-DAT (deletion of the first 65 amino acid residues), and YFP-DAT-C′615 (truncation of the last 5 amino acid residues) were described previously (14Sorkina T. Doolen S. Galperin E. Zahniser N.R. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28274-28283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The full-length hDAT in pcDNA3.1 was kindly provided by Dr. G. W. Miller (Emory University). Single amino acid substitutions were made using the DAT/pEYFP-C1, ΔN-DAT/pEYFP-C1, or DAT/pcDNA3.1 as templates and a QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA). To generate DAT C′618, C′615, C′610, and C′576 truncation mutants, a stop codon was created at the positions corresponding to amino acid residues 619, 616, 611, and 577, respectively, in the DAT-pcDNA3.1 using a QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis. DAT mutants C′597-LKV and C′586-LKV were generated by replacing three residues following residue 597 (598–600) or 586 (587–589) by LKV, and by creating a stop codon at the positions corresponding to residues 601 and 590, respectively, using site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant Δ581–610 was generated by replacing residues 581–590 by residues 611–620 followed by a stop codon using Quick-change mutagenesis. To generate the EGF receptor (EGFR)-DAT chimera, the XhoI restriction site was introduced into wtEGFR-pEGFP-N1 (17Carter R.E. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35000-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) at the position corresponding to amino acid residues 644–645 of the EGFR by using site-directed mutagenesis. A DNA fragment encoding residues 578–620 of the human DAT followed by the stop codon, in which XhoI site was introduced into the 5′-end and HindIII site into the 3′-end, was obtained by PCR. The fragment of wtEGFR-pEGFP-N1(XhoI) corresponding to the receptor cytoplasmic domain was cut by using XhoI and HindIII and replaced with the DAT-(578–620) fragment. The resultant EGFR-DAT chimera consisted of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the EGF receptor (residues 1–643) followed by serine, arginine, and the cytoplasmic tail of DAT-(578–620). The EGFR-ΔC construct was generated by introducing a stop codon in residue 646 of the EGFR-DAT chimera. In both constructs GFP was not in a reading frame and was not translated. All mutations were confirmed by automated dideoxynucleotide sequencing. Antibodies—Monoclonal rat antibody against the amino terminus of hDAT was purchased from Chemicon International, Inc. (Temecula, CA); polyclonal rabbit antibody to GFP was from Abcam Ltd. (Cambridge, UK); monoclonal mouse antibodies to α-tau and α-PDI were from Transduction Laboratories. Mouse monoclonal antibody 528 to the extracellular domain of the EGF receptor was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Cell Culture and Transfections—Porcine aortic endothelial (PAE) cells were grown in F-12 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics. Human cervical carcinoma HeLa and HEK293T cells (referred to as HEK293) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS and antibiotics. Entactin-collagen IV-laminin coating (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) was applied to 35-mm dishes to increase HEK293 cell adherence. Cells were grown to 50–80% confluency and transfected with the appropriate plasmids using Effectene (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). For microscopy, the cells were split 1 day after transfection onto glass coverslips and were used for experiments on the 2nd or 3rd day. For stable expression, wild-type or mutant DATs were transfected into HeLa cells, and the single cell clones were selected by growing the cells in the presence of G418 (400 μg/ml). The immortalized neuronal cell line 1RB3AN27 was kindly provided by Dr. K. Prasad (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center) (18Clarkson E.D. Rosa F.G.L. Edwards-Prasad J. Weiland D.A.

These cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% FBS and antibiotics. To promote differentiation, the cells were grown to 30–50% confluency and then treated with 2 mm dibutyryl cAMP for 2 days. The cells were then transfected with the appropriate plasmids and maintained with 2 mm dibutyryl cAMP for the next 2 or 3 days. Primary cultures derived from E15 embryonic rat ventral mesencephalon were prepared as described (19Zawada W.M. Meintzer M.K. Rao P. Marotti J. Wang X. Esplen J.E. Clarkson E.D. Freed C.R.

Briefly, cultures were prepared in Ca2+/Mg2+-free Hanks' balanced salt solution by mechanically dispersing tissue pieces with a 1-ml pipette. Cells were then centrifuged at 1000 × g for 5 min and resuspended in F-12 medium containing 10% FBS, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin. Cells were plated on polyethylene imide-coated 18-mm coverslips in a 12-well plate, at 60,000 cells/cm2, and grown for 3 days. The cells were then transfected with the appropriate plasmids and used for experiments 2 or 3 days post-transfection. Surface Biotinylation and Immunoprecipitation—Cells expressing DAT proteins were grown in 35-mm dishes and biotinylated as described previously (14Sorkina T. Doolen S. Galperin E. Zahniser N.R. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28274-28283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (PBS) and incubated for 20 min on ice with 1 mg/ml sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (EZ-Link™ sulfo-NHS-biotin, Pierce) in PBS, followed by a second incubation with fresh sulfo-NHS-biotin. After biotinylation, the cells were washed twice with cold PBS, incubated on ice with 0.1 m glycine in PBS, and washed with PBS again. The cells were then solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm NaCl, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 544 μm iodoacetamide, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) at 4 °C. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 16,000 × g, and the biotinylated proteins were precipitated with NeutrAvidin™ beads (Pierce), washed five times with lysis buffer, and denatured by heating the beads in sample buffer at 95 °C for 5 min. In some experiments supernatants from the NeutrAvidin precipitation were further subjected to immunoprecipitation with polyclonal anti-GFP for 2 h at 4 °C. The precipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer supplemented with 100 mm NaCl, washed once without NaCl, and then denatured by heating in sample buffer. The NeutrAvidin beads and immunoprecipitates were analyzed by electrophoresis on 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Western blotting was performed with monoclonal rat antibodies to DAT followed by secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, and bands were detected by using the enhanced chemiluminescence kit from Pierce. Several x-ray films were analyzed to determine the linear range of the chemiluminescence signals, and the quantifications were performed using densitometry and NIH Image software. In co-immunoprecipitation experiments, the cells co-expressing wild-type DAT and YFP-ΔN-DAT-G585A mutant were lysed, and DAT was immunoprecipitated by using rat anti-DAT. The immunoprecipitates were blotted with DAT and GFP antibodies. Immunofluorescence Staining—The cells grown on glass coverslips were washed with Ca2+, Mg2+-free PBS (CMF-PBS), fixed with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Ft. Washington, PA) for 15 min at room temperature, and mildly permeabilized using a 3-min incubation in CMF-PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% bovine serum albumin at room temperature. The permeabilization step was omitted in experiments with EGFR-DAT chimeras. Cells were then incubated in CMF-PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin at room temperature for 1 h with primary antibodies, and subsequently incubated for 30 min with secondary antibodies labeled with CY3 or CY5 (The Jackson Laboratory, West Grove, PA). Both primary and secondary antibody solutions were precleared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min. After staining, the coverslips were mounted in Mowiol (Calbiochem). To obtain high resolution three-dimensional images of cells, the fluorescence imaging Mariannas work station (Intelligent Imaging Innovation, Denver, CO) was used, which consisted of a Zeiss inverted microscope equipped with a cooled CCD CoolSnap HQ (Roper, CA), z-step motor, dual filter wheels, and a xenon 175-watt light source, all controlled by SlideBook 4.0 software. Typically, 5–15 serial two-dimensional images were recorded at 200-nm intervals. A z-stack of images obtained was deconvoluted using a modification of the constrained iteration method. Final arrangement of all images was performed using Adobe Photoshop. Live Cell Microscopy and FRET Measurements—PAE cells transiently expressing various YFP-tagged DAT proteins were grown on 25-mm glass coverslips. The coverslips were mounted in a microscope chamber and placed on a microscope stage. To visualize CFP and YFP, consecutive images were acquired through corresponding filter channels. The method of sensitized FRET measurement used to examine the interaction between YFP- and CFP-DAT has been described previously (14Sorkina T. Doolen S. Galperin E. Zahniser N.R. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28274-28283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Briefly, YFP, CFP, and FRET images were acquired, background-subtracted, and the corrected FRET (FRETC) was calculated using CFP/FRET and YFP/FRET cross-bleed coefficients. FRETC images are presented as YFP intensity-modulated pseudocolor images. All calculations were performed using the Channel Math and FRET modules of the SlideBook software. EGF Binding Assay—125I-EGF was prepared as described previously (17Carter R.E. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35000-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). PAE cells transiently expressing EGFR-ΔC or EGFR-DAT chimeras were grown on 6-well dishes, and the amount of EGF binding sites on the cell surface was measured by incubating cells with 50 ng/ml 125I-EGF at 4 °C for 1 h as described previously (17Carter R.E. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35000-35007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). LKV Motif Is Not Sufficient for the Efficient Transport of DAT to the Cell Surface—Previous studies revealed the importance of the last three carboxyl-terminal amino acids of hDAT (618LKV620) for its transport to the cell surface (12Torres G.E. Yao W.D. Mohn A.R. Quan H. Kim K.M. Levey A.I. Staudinger J. Caron M.G. Neuron. 2001; 30: 121-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). However, in initial fluorescence microscopy analysis of DAT deletion mutants expressed in either HeLa or HEK293 cells, we noticed that truncation of the last 2, 5, or 10 amino acids (Fig. 1A) did not completely abrogate transport of DAT to the cell surface. Rather, these truncations substantially delayed expression at the cell surface (data not shown). On the other hand, removal of the entire carboxyl terminus (C′576 truncation mutant) blocked the delivery of DAT to the cell surface (data not shown). These results suggested that there are carboxyl-terminal residues other than LKV that are essential for DAT trafficking. To map these residues, DAT mutants, in which the last 23 and 34 residues were truncated and the LKV620 motif was attached, C′597-LKV and C′586-LKV, respectively (see Fig. 1A), were stably expressed in HeLa cells. In order to label surface DAT molecules, the cells were incubated with a membrane-impermeable NHS-biotin derivative, and the biotinylated proteins were precipitated using NeutrAvidin-agarose followed by the detection of DAT by Western blotting. Cell surface biotinylation experiments demonstrated that whereas the C′597-KLV mutant was partially expressed at the plasma membrane, the C′586-KLV mutant was undetectable (Fig. 1B). Both mutants were mainly expressed as the nonglycosylated form (∼50 kDa) inaccessible to biotinylation (13Torres G.E. Carneiro A. Seamans K. Fiorentini C. Sweeney A. Yao W.-D. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 2731-2739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 14Sorkina T. Doolen S. Galperin E. Zahniser N.R. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28274-28283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Moreover, attachment of the last 10 residues (611–620) to the DAT-C′577 truncation mutant (Δ578–610) did not restore DAT trafficking to the plasma membrane (data not shown). These results suggested that the PDZ-binding motif is not sufficient for ER export of the transporter and that sequences within the juxtamembrane portion of the carboxyl terminus are critical for efficient delivery of DAT to the plasma membrane. Analysis of DAT Alanine Substitution Mutants by Fluorescence Microscopy—In order to identify the specific amino acid residues important for DAT transport to the cell surface, the carboxyl-terminal tail (residues 575–620) was subjected to systematic alanine-scanning mutagenesis. The phenotypic screening of transiently expressed DAT mutants was performed by using single cell fluorescence microscopy analysis. To facilitate the visualization of DAT mutants in the cell, mutagenesis was performed using YFP-DAT as template, although several mutations were made in untagged full-length DAT. YFP-DAT has been shown previously to be fully functional (14Sorkina T. Doolen S. Galperin E. Zahniser N.R. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28274-28283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 20Daniels G.M. Amara S.G. J. Biol.

PAE cells were chosen as our preferred expression system for DAT structure-function studies because transiently expressed DAT is efficiently targeted to the cell surface and displays normal dopamine transport characteristics in these cells. On the contrary, wild-type DAT is expressed at very high levels and retained in the ER in a large population of HeLa, HEK293, and COS-1 cells. In addition, PAE cells are flattened and allow clear visualization of plasma membrane and other organelles in living cells by epifluorescence microscopy. The localization of YFP-DAT and its mutants in PAE cells was analyzed 2 days after transfection by live cell fluorescent microscopy. Wild-type YFP-DAT was located to the plasma membrane with enrichment in ruffles, phylopodia, and membrane protrusions in the majority (>80%) of transfected cells (Fig. 2). A pool of YFP-DAT was seen in the perinuclear region in a number of cells. These transporter molecules probably represent the Golgi- and ER-associated transporter on the way to the plasma membrane. Similar subcellular localization was observed for a number of mutants with single and multiple alanine substitutions of carboxyl-terminal residues. These data are summarized in Fig. 1A. The exceptions to this localization were the G585A, K590A, D600A, and K619A mutants. The K619A mutation was not further investigated because this lysine residue is a part of previously established PDZ domain binding motif (12Torres G.E. Yao W.D. Mohn A.R. Quan H. Kim K.M. Levey A.I. Staudinger J. Caron M.G. Neuron. 2001; 30: 121-134Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The G585A, K590A, and D600A DAT mutants were located almost exclusively in the intracellular tubular network throughout the cell and often seen associated with the nuclear envelope, a pattern of distribution consistent with ER localization (Fig. 2). When YFP-DAT localization was inspected 3 days after transfection, a clearly distinguishable plasma membrane localization of K590A and D600A was observed in 20–30% of transfected cells, suggesting that these mutations did not completely block, but rather slowed down, the delivery of DAT to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2). In contrast, the G585A mutant displayed the characteristic pattern of ER localization and was not detected in the plasma membrane by microscopic analysis under any conditions. Plasma Membrane Expression of DAT Mutants Analyzed by Cell Surface Biotinylation—Our fluorescence microscopy analysis had revealed the role of Gly-585, Lys-590, and Asp-600 in the transport of DAT to the plasma membrane. To analyze quantitatively the plasma membrane expression of YFP-DAT mutants, we performed cell surface biotinylation experiments after 2 days of expression. Nonbiotinylated YFP-DAT was immunoprecipitated from supernatants of NeutrAvidin beads with anti-GFP antibodies. As illustrated in Fig. 3, biotinylated wild-type YFP-DAT was readily detected, whereas the amounts of biotinylated K590A and D600A mutants were much smaller, indicative of the inefficient delivery of these mutants to the plasma membrane. A very small amount of biotinylated G585A was detected in some experiments (<0.5% of total cellular mutant proteins; Fig. 3), indicating that this mutant is located almost exclusively intracellularly, in agreement with the fluorescence microscopy shown in Fig. 2. In general, biotinylation assay was more sensitive in detecting surface DAT than the light microscopy because the latter technique does not allow clear detection of the very weak fluorescence of YFP-DAT diffusely distributed in the plane of the plasma membrane. Two main forms of wild-type YFP-DAT were detected in supernatants of the NeutrAvidin beads as described previously (14Sorkina T. Doolen S. Galperin E. Zahniser N.R. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28274-28283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A lower molecular weight form (∼75 kDa) corresponds to an immature, nonglycosylated form that is located in the ER, and a higher molecular weight form (∼105 kDa) corresponds to the mature YFP-DAT. The mature form represents plasma membrane YFP-DAT that was not biotinylated, as well as endosomal and trans-Golgi YFP-DAT. Although the amounts of the nonglycosylated form of wild-type and mutant YFP-DAT were comparable, the relative amounts of matured mutant proteins were significantly lower than that of the wild-type YFP-DAT.

This protein is preferentially expressed in peripheral blood leukocytes and adipocytes. We previously showed that galectin-12 is induced by cell cycle block at the G1 phase and causes G1 arrest when overexpressed (Yang, R.-Y., Hsu, D. K., Yu, L., Ni, J., and Liu, F.-T. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 20252-20260). Here, we show that the galectin-12 gene is expressed in mouse preadipocytes and is up-regulated when preadipocytes undergo cell cycle arrest, concomitant with acquisition of the competence to undergo differentiation in response to adipogenic hormone stimulation. Following a brief down-regulation 1 day after adipogenic treatment, its expression was once again markedly elevated when cells underwent terminal differentiation. Down-regulation of endogenous galectin-12 expression by RNA interference greatly reduced the expression of the adipogenic transcription factors CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β and -α and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ and severely suppressed adipocyte differentiation as a result of defective adipogenic signaling. We conclude that galectin-12 is required for signal transduction that conveys hormone stimulation to the induction of adipogenic factors essential for adipocyte differentiation. The findings suggest that galectin-12 is a major regulator of adipose tissue development.

We conclude that galectin-12 is required for signal transduction that conveys hormone stimulation to the induction of adipogenic factors essential for adipocyte differentiation. The findings suggest that galectin-12 is a major regulator of adipose tissue development. Adipose tissue is a major site of energy storage and expenditure. It also actively regulates food uptake and whole body metabolism by secreting a number of hormones and cytokines (1Havel P.J. Proc. Nutr. Soc. 2000; 59: 359-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 2Mohamed-Ali V. Pinkney J.H. Coppack S.W. Int. J. Obes. Relat. Metab.

However, excessively increased adipose tissue mass leads to obesity, which is a major risk factor for non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type II diabetes) and hypertension. It is also linked to some types of cancers and immune dysfunctions. Adipose tissue mass is determined by both the size and number of fat cells, or adipocytes. Increase in fat cell number is accomplished by the differentiation of preadipocytes to mature adipocytes, or adipogenesis (4Gregoire F.M. Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 783-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1862) Google Scholar). Much has been learned about the transcriptional regulation of adipocyte differentiation in the past 20 years (5Rosen E.D. Spiegelman B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2000; 16: 145-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar, 6Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) due to the availability of in vitro models of adipogenesis based on preadipocyte cell lines such as 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F422A (7Green H.

The major transcription factors in the transcription network of adipogenesis include CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins, which belong to the basic leucine zipper class of transcription factors (9Ramji D.P.

Confluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes can be differentiated into white adipocytes by treatment with a combination of an agent that elevates intracellular cAMP levels, a glucocorticoid, and insulin, commonly abbreviated as MDI for isobutylmethylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin. CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)-β and C/EBPδ are the first transcription factors induced after MDI treatment, which can be detected within 2 h. After a long lag of ∼2 days, they become competent to activate the expression of C/EBPα and PPARγ (11Tang Q.Q. Lane M.D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2231-2241Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), which positively regulate each other's expression and which mediate the transcription of a number of downstream genes that characterize the adipocyte phenotype (12Wu Z.

Galectins are a family of animal lectins with conserved carbohydrate recognition domains (CRDs) for β-galactoside (15Barondes S.H. Cooper D.N. Gitt M.A. Leffler H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20807-20810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They are present in most species of the animal kingdom, including lower organisms such as nematodes and higher organisms such as mammals. In mammals, 14 members have been identified to date (16Cooper D.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 209-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Some of the members, especially galectin-3 and galectin-1, have been extensively studied, and experimental results suggest that these lectins may have diverse functions, including regulation of pre-mRNA splicing, cell proliferation and differentiation, and apoptosis (17Dagher S.F.

Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Most galectins have wide tissue distribution. For example, galectin-3 is abundantly present in the epithelia of several organs (24Liu F.-T. Clin. Immunol. 2000; 97: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) as well as in various inflammatory cells, including monocytes/macrophages (25Liu F.-T. Hsu D.K. Zuberi R.I. Kuwabara I. Chi E.Y. Henderson W.R.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 1016-1028PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with the lack of a classical signal sequence, galectins are mainly intracellular proteins (26Liu F.-T. Patterson R.J. Wang J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). However, a number of studies have demonstrated the secretion of these proteins (27Mehul B. Hughes R.C. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1169-1178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with their spatial distribution, these proteins appear to function both intracellularly and extracellularly. The extracellular functions are likely to be due to carbohydrate binding properties and, in many cases, are inhibited by specific free carbohydrate, whereas the intracellular functions may not be related to carbohydrate binding (26Liu F.-T. Patterson R.J. Wang J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1572: 263-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Although all galectins contain at least one homologous CRD in their sequence, different members exhibit different localization and expression patterns, suggesting distinct functions for each member of the family (21Yang R.-Y.

Endocrinol. 2002; 147: 553-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), implying a role for galectin-12 in insulin signaling and the pathogenesis of type II diabetes. Like the differentiation of many other cell lines, adipocyte differentiation is interwoven with changes in cell cycle status, culminating in the permanent exit from the cell cycle (35Reichert M. Eick D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Cell cycle arrest before adipogenic hormone treatment is required for the initiation of subsequent differentiation events, and permanent cell cycle exit afterward is essential for the completion of the differentiation process (4Gregoire F.M. Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 783-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1862) Google Scholar). It is therefore not surprising that many proteins with cell cycle regulatory functions such as Rb (36Cowherd R.M. Lyle R.E. McGehee R.E.J. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 3-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar), c-Myc (37Freytag S.O. Geddes T.J. Science. 1992; 256: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar), and E2Fs (38Fajas L. Landsberg R.L. Huss-Garcia Y. Sardet C. Lees J.A. Auwerx J. Dev. Cell. 2002; 3: 39-49Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) also have potent effects on adipocyte differentiation. Reciprocally, the two master regulators of adipocyte differentiation, C/EBPα (39Umek R.M. Friedman A.D. McKnight S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (573) Google Scholar, 40Porse B.T. Pedersen T.A. Xu X. Lindberg B. Wewer U.M. Friis-Hansen L. Nerlov C. Cell. 2001; 107: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and PPARγ (41Altiok S. Xu M. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1987-1998Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), both possess the ability to cause G1 arrest. Because of the preferential expression of galectin-12 in adipocytes and its G1-arresting activity, we decided to investigate whether this protein is involved in adipocyte differentiation. Cell Culture and Antibodies—The mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocyte cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection. The cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum in a 37 °C incubator with 10% CO2. Rabbit antibodies against C/EBPβ, C/EBPα, PPARγ, and the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptor β-subunit (sc-713) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. and used at a 1:1000 dilution (0.2 μg/ml) for Western blotting. Rabbit antibodies against CREB, ERK, Akt, and their respective phosphorylated forms were from Cell Signaling Technology. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against phosphotyrosine (PY20), the insulin receptor β-subunit, and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) were from BD Biosciences. Rabbit anti-galectin-12 antibody was generated by immunizing rabbits with inclusion bodies of the C-terminal CRD of galectin-12 produced with expression vector pET-14b (Novagen) and Escherichia coli strain BL21-SI (Invitrogen). For affinity purification of the antibody, the C-terminal CRD of galectin-12 was expressed as a bacterial NusA fusion protein with vector pET-43.1 (Novagen). The fusion protein was purified with Talon affinity beads (Clontech) and conjugated to Sepharose 4B. These Sepharose affinity beads were then used to purify antibodies specific for galectin-12 from the antisera by affinity column chromatography. RNA Interference with Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—21-Nucleotide siRNA duplexes with 3′-UU overhangs on each strand targeting the American firefly luciferase and mouse galectin-3 and galectin-12 mRNAs were synthesized with the Silencer siRNA construction kit (Ambion Inc.). One control siRNA, siGL2, targets the sequence 5′-AACGUACGCGGAAUACUUCGA-3′ in the mRNA of the American firefly (Photinus pyralis) luciferase (42Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8160) Google Scholar). The other control siRNA, si3, targets the sequence 5′-AAACAGGAUUGUUCUAGAUUU-3′ in mouse galectin-3 mRNA. The three galectin-12 siRNAs (si12.1, si12.2, and si12.3) target the following distinct sequences in mouse galectin-12 mRNA: 5′-AAUUCCUGAACAUCAAUCCAU-3′, 5′-AACAUCAAUCCAUUUGUGGAG-3′, and 5′AAUCUGGUGACAUCUUGGUAA-3′, respectively. The transfection of 3T3-L1 cells with siRNA was performed using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) (43Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Weber K. Tuschl T. Methods. 2002; 26: 199-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 day prior to transfection, ∼2.5 × 104 cells were seeded in wells of 6-well plates so that they would be ∼50% confluent the following day. The siRNA stocks were made by diluting siRNA duplexes into annealing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 m NaCl, pH 8) to 1 μm. Cells on each well were transfected with 10 μl of Oligofectamine and 10 μl of 1 μm siRNA (final concentration of 5 nm). One day after transfection, the transfection mixture was removed, and 4 ml of fresh culture medium was added. Cells were induced to differentiate 3 days after transfection as described below. Induction of Adipocyte Differentiation—To induce differentiation, confluent cells were exposed to a pro-differentiative regimen consisting of 0.2 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 1 μm dexamethasone, and 10 μg/ml insulin (Sigma) (MDI) in culture medium for 2 days. The cells were subsequently cultured in medium with insulin only. Cell cycle distribution during adipocyte differentiation was determined by flow cytometry of propidium iodide-stained cells fixed with ethanol as described previously (31Yang R.-Y. Hsu D.K. Yu L. Ni J. Liu F.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20252-20260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Lipid droplets in adipocytes were stained with the lipophilic dye oil red O (Sigma) (44Koopman R. Schaart G. Hesselink M.K. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 116: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 45Catalano R.A. Lillie R.D. Stain Technol. 1975; 50: 297-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Cells were fixed for 1 h in 3.7% formaldehyde, rinsed in 60% isopropyl alcohol, and stained with 1.8 mg/ml oil red O in 60% isopropyl alcohol and 0.4% dextrin for 15 min. Excessive oil red O stain was then washed away with three changes of water (30 s each), with the last one containing 1:1000 SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes, Inc.) to stain the nuclei. Stained cells were visualized under a Zeiss confocal microscope equipped with argon (488 nm) and helium/neon (543 and 633 nm) lasers using a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter set and a rhodamine filter set for SYBR Green I and oil red O, respectively. Images were acquired and analyzed with Zeiss LSM 510 software. Quantification of oil red O staining was achieved by extracting lipid-associated dye with 100% isopropyl alcohol for 15 min before spectrophotometry to measure the absorbance at 510 nm (46Janderova L. McNeil M. Murrell A.N. Mynatt R.L. Smith S.R. Obes. Res. 2003; 11: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Results were then normalized to protein contents of the samples. Analysis of Gene Expression—RNA extraction and reverse transcription-PCR were performed as described (31Yang R.-Y. Hsu D.K. Yu L. Ni J. Liu F.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20252-20260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) with the following primers in the PCR steps after reverse transcription: 5′-CCTGCTCACGTGCTCTTCCTCG-3′ and 5′-TTGGAGCCCTTCTTAGCAGTGG-3′ for mouse galectin-12, 5′-CTACCCTTGCAATACGAGGACAAAGAAGTG-3′ and 5′-TCAGGATGTCATGTTACCATTTGTGATG-3′ for mouse adipsin, and 5′-TGCCTTTGCCACAAGGAAAGTGGCAGGC-3′ and 5′-TCCGACTGACTATTGTAGTGTTTGATGC-3′ for mouse aP2. Primers 5′-TGAAGGTCGGTGTGAACGGATTTGGC-3′ and 5′-CATGTAGGCCATGAGGTCCACCAC-3′ were used for mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a control. For Western blotting, cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min, and the lysates were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore Corp.), and probed with the indicated antibodies as described (31Yang R.-Y. Hsu D.K. Yu L. Ni J. Liu F.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20252-20260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Analysis of Adipogenic Signal Transduction—Cells were lysed at different time points of MDI stimulation in SDS sample buffer; boiled for 5 min; and subjected to Western blotting with antibody against Akt, ERK, CREB, or their respective phosphorylated forms. For detection of IGF-1 receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (31Yang R.-Y. Hsu D.K. Yu L. Ni J. Liu F.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20252-20260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) containing 1 mm sodium vanadate, and 200 μg of protein was incubated for 2 h with 2 μg of antibody PY20 and 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) to precipitate tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (47Worrall D.S. Olefsky J.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 378-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). After three washes with lysis buffer, the precipitated proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min in 10 μl of SDS sample buffer, resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blotting with anti-IGF-1 receptor β-subunit antibody. Expression of Galectin-12 during Adipocyte Differentiation—The mouse preadipocyte cell line 3T3-L1 is a continuous substrain of 3T3 (Swiss albino) developed through clonal isolation (8Green H. Meuth M. Cell. 1974; 3: 127-133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). These cells become competent to undergo a preadipose-to-adipose conversion as they progress from a rapidly dividing to a confluent and contact-inhibited state and are frequently used in an in vitro model of adipocyte differentiation that closely recapitulates the in vivo process (4Gregoire F.M. Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 783-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1862) Google Scholar). To determine the timing of galectin-12 expression in adipocyte differentiation, galectin-12 mRNA levels were determined by reverse transcription-PCR (Fig. 1a) during the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. Consistent with our previous observation that galectin-12 arrests the cell cycle at the G1 phase (31Yang R.-Y. Hsu D.K. Yu L. Ni J. Liu F.-T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20252-20260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), we found that its expression was low in rapidly dividing subconfluent 3T3-L1 cells, but significantly up-regulated when cells underwent growth arrest as the culture reached confluence (Fig. 1a). Treatment of confluent cultures with adipogenic hormones, which induce transient mitotic clonal expansion during the first day (48Tang Q.Q. Otto T.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar), down-regulated galectin-12 expression in just a few hours (Fig. 1a). Galectin-12 mRNA levels were again markedly elevated 2 days after adipogenic hormone stimulation (Fig. 1a), when cells enter the terminal stage of differentiation and permanently exit the cell cycle (35Reichert M. Eick D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A similar pattern of expression was observed when galectin-12 protein levels were monitored by Western blotting with an antibody (Fig. 1b). Galectin-12 Is Required for Adipocyte Differentiation—The correlation of galectin-12 expression with adipocyte differentiation suggests an important function of this protein in adipogenesis. We employed RNA interference to study the role of galectin-12 in adipocyte differentiation by knocking down the expression of endogenous galectin-12 with siRNAs specific for galectin-12 mRNA. It has been shown that siRNA with 2-nucleotide overhangs efficiently and specifically suppresses gene expression (42Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8160) Google Scholar, 49Semizarov D. Frost L. Sarthy A. Kroeger P. Halbert D.N. Fesik S.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6347-6352Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 50Chi J.T. Chang H.Y. Wang N.N. Chang D.S. Dunphy N. Brown P.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6343-6346Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Two control siRNAs for luciferase and galectin-3, respectively, and three siRNAs targeting distinct sequences in galectin-12 mRNA were used in our experiments. When 3T3-L1 cells were treated with siRNAs before being subjected to the pro-differentiative regimen, all three galectin-12 siRNAs significantly down-regulated galectin-12 expression, whereas the two control siRNAs did not affect the expression (Fig. 2a). After stimulation with adipogenic hormones, control siRNA-transfected cells accumulated large quantities of lipid droplets, a telltale sign of adipocyte differentiation. In contrast, cells transfected with galectin-12 siRNAs contained many fewer lipid droplets (Fig. 2b). Quantitation of oil red O staining indicated that cells transfected with galectin-12 siRNAs accumulated only one-third as much triglyceride seen in control cells (Fig. 2c), indicating a major defect in adipogenesis. Aside from serving as a depot for triglyceride, another important function for adipose tissue is to regulate glucose homeostasis in response to insulin stimulation. Insulin sensitivity is acquired during adipocyte differentiation as the insulin receptor and its substrates are up-regulated by C/EBPα (12Wu Z. Rosen E.D. Brun R. Hauser S. Adelmant G. Troy A.E. McKeon C. Darlington G.J. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 151-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Western blotting revealed high levels of insulin receptor expression in control cells 7 days after adipogenic treatments. In contrast, no insulin receptor expression was detectable after the same treatment of cells transfected with galectin-12 siRNAs (Fig. 2d). These cells also expressed less IRS-1 compared with control cells (Fig. 2d). Impaired Induction of Critical Adipogenic Transcription Factors and Adipocyte Differentiation Markers in Galectin-12-deficient Cells—Based on their temporal sequence of expression as well as gain- and loss-of-function studies both in vitro and in vivo, it is now well recognized that C/EBPβ and C/EBPδ are rapidly induced in response to adipogenic stimulation. They then activate the expression of two major adipogenic transcription factors, C/EBPα and PPARγ, which cross-regulate each other's expression (6Rosen E.D. Walkey C.J. Puigserver P. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1293-1307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PPARγ-activated gene expression is responsible for most of the mature adipocyte phenotype (13Rosen E.D. Hsu C.H. Wang X. Sakai S. Freeman M.W. Gonzalez F.J. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar), except insulin sensitivity, which is ascribed to the C/EBPα-induced expression of insulin receptor and IRS-1 genes (12Wu Z. Rosen E.D. Brun R. Hauser S. Adelmant G. Troy A.E. McKeon C. Darlington G.J. Spiegelman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 151-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Because adipogenic hormone-induced adipocyte differentiation and insulin receptor and IRS-1 expression are impaired in galectin-12-deficient cells (Fig. 2), we tested whether galectin-12 is required for the induction of these critical transcription factors. In control cells, adipogenic hormone treatment induced C/EBPβ expression in 2 h. C/EBPβ protein levels in these cells continued to rise and peaked after 1 day of treatment (Fig. 3a). In comparison, C/EBPβ induction in cells transfected with galectin-12 siRNA was dramatically impaired, and its protein levels in these cells remained low during 2 days of adipogenic hormone treatment (Fig. 3a). Consistent with this, these cells also contained greatly reduced levels of C/EBPα and PPARγ, the two downstream targets of C/EBPβ, during the 6 days of stimulation with adipogenic hormones (Fig. 3b). Adipsin (also called complement factor D, C3 convertase activator, and properdin factor D) is a serine protease secreted by mature adipocytes and is considered as a late marker of adipocyte differentiation (51Ailhaud G. Grimaldi P. Negrel R. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1992; 12: 207-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (601"
https://openalex.org/W2145652953,"The human PrP gene (PRNP) has two common alleles that encode either methionine or valine at codon 129. This polymorphism modulates disease susceptibility and phenotype of human transmissible spongiform encyphalopathies, but the molecular mechanism by which these effects are mediated remains unclear. Here, we compared the misfolding pathway that leads to the formation of beta-sheet-rich oligomeric isoforms of the methionine 129 variant of PrP to that of the valine 129 variant. We provide evidence for differences in the folding behavior between the two variants at the early stages of oligomer formation. We show that Met(129) has a higher propensity to form beta-sheet-rich oligomers, whereas Val(129) has a higher tendency to fold into alpha-helical-rich monomers. An equimolar mixture of both variants displayed an intermidate folding behavior. We show that the oligomers of both variants are initially a mixture of alpha- and beta-rich conformers that evolve with time to an increasingly homogeneous beta-rich form. This maturation process, which involves no further change in proteinase K resistance, occurs more rapidly in the Met(129) form than the Val(129) form. Although the involvement of such beta-rich oligomers in prion pathogenesis is speculative, the misfolding behavior could, in part, explain the higher susceptibility of individuals that are methionine homozygote to both sporadic and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease."

Among candidate molecules that are potentially involved in such a process, the poly-α 2-8 sialic acid (PSA) 1The abbreviations used are: PSA, poly-α 2-8 sialic acid; NCAM, neural cell adhesion molecule; PSA-NCAM, polysialylated NCAM isoforms; EndoN, endoneuraminidase; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; Ab, antibody; GFP, green fluorescent protein; DRG, dorsal root ganglion; SVZ, subventricular zone; En, embryonic day n. carbohydrate polymer is of particular interest. PSA is found as a capsular polysaccharide of bacteria causing menin-gitis (1Hayrinen J. Pelkonen S. Finne J. Vaccine. 1989; 7: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and in mammals (including humans), it is found attached to the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM). Polysialylated NCAM isoforms (PSA-NCAM) are associated with morphogenetic changes during developmental processes such as cell migration, synaptogenesis, axonal growth, and branching, whereas PSA-NCAM persists in the adult brain only in structures that display a high degree of functional plasticity (2Rougon G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 61: 197-207PubMed Google Scholar). Notably, PSA-NCAM is re-expressed during regeneration after damage to muscle (3Figarella-Branger D. Nedelec J. Pellissier J.F. Rougon G. J. Neurol. Sci. 1990; 98: 21-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and neural tissue (4Aubert I. Ridet J.L. Schachner M. Rougon G. Gage F.H. Comp.

Several observations based upon either enzymatic destruction of PSA by endoneuraminidase (EndoN) (6Theodosis D.T. Bonhomme R. Vitiello S. Rougon G. Poulain D.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10228-10236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or the use of mutant mice for the polysialyltransferase enzyme responsible for PSA synthesis (7Eckhardt M. Bukalo O. Chazal G. Wang L. Goridis C. Schachner M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Cremer H. Dityatev A. J.

For example, PSA is required in the adult brain for migration of developing neuroblasts in the rostral migratory stream (10Ono K. Tomasiewicz H. Magnuson T. Rutishauser U.

Kiss J.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4315-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). PSA also enhances the effect of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) on cell survival (13Vutskits L. Djebbara-Hannas Z. Zhang H. Paccaud J.P. Durbec P. Rougon G. Muller D. Kiss J.Z. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and regulates the directionality of migration of oligodendrocyte precursors in response to a gradient of platelet-derived growth factor (14Zhang H. Vutskits L. Calaora V. Durbec P. Kiss J.Z. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Thus, the PSA carbohydrate emerges as an important permissive factor underlying dynamic changes in cell-surface interactions and represents one of the potential targets for future therapeutic approaches to promote plasticity and functional recovery after brain damage. As different peptides can assume diverse conformations, a large peptide library expressing random sequences should contain peptides that can conformationally mimic many ligands. This idea has been shown to have practical application with the demonstration that peptide mimics of antigenic specificities (mimotopes) can be efficiently identified using peptide libraries (15Meloen R.H. Puijk W.C. Slootstra J.W. J. Mol. Recognit. 2000; 13: 352-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Peptides mimicking polysaccharides can be readily produced and used in various ways (see, for example, Refs. 16Pincus S.H. Smith M.J. Jennings H.J. Burritt J.B. Glee P.M. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 293-298PubMed Google Scholar, 17Beenhouwer D.O. May R.J. Valadon P. Scharff M.D. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 6992-6999Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 18Simon-Haldi M. Mantei N. Franke J. Voshol H. Schachner M. J. Neurochem. 2002; 83: 1380-1388Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Unlike the polysaccharides themselves, such peptide mimics should be easier to manufacture and modify. Thus, the mimotopes may be useful as potential therapeutic compounds. Here, by biopanning a phage library with an anti-PSA monoclonal antibody (Ab), we characterized cyclic peptide inserts, which are mimotopes for PSA. We tested their bioactivity in several in vitro and in vivo tests and demonstrated their ability to enhance PSA biological activity. Phage Library and Screening—Monoclonal anti-PSA Ab of the IgG 2a isotype directed to Neisseria meningitidis B capsular polysaccharide (19Coquillat D. Bruge J. Danve B. Latour M. Hurpin C. Schulz D. Durbec P. Rougon G. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 7130-7139Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) was immobilized on magnetic protein G beads (protein G Maga-beads; Europa Bioproducts, Ltd). A phagemid library, prepared as described by Felici et al. (20Felici F. Galfre G. Luzzago A. Monaci P. Nicosia A. Cortese R. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 267: 116-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was used. Briefly, the library comprises constrained random nonamer peptides presented on the surface of M13-like phage particles as fusion protein to the N terminus of pVIII major coat protein (100 copies/phage). The random sequences are linked by a cysteine residue at one end and cysteine and glycine residues on the other (20Felici F. Galfre G. Luzzago A. Monaci P. Nicosia A. Cortese R. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 267: 116-129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The library comprises ∼108 peptides with constant sequence length. Three rounds of panning were carried out as described in Ref. 21Luzzago A. Felici F. Tramontano A. Pessi A. Cortese R. Gene. 1993; 128: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar. Monoclonal phages from all three rounds of panning were tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for reactivity with the anti-PSA Ab. For each clone, three wells of an ELISA plate (NUNC) were coated with 1010 phage particles overnight at 4 °C. After blocking with Tris-buffered saline/2% nonfat dry milk, the wells were incubated with the anti-PSA monoclonal Ab (2 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline/1% nonfat dry milk). Reactions were developed with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. Monoclonal phages reacting positively with the anti-PSA Ab and negatively with a control monoclonal from the same isotype were selected, DNA-isolated, and sequenced. The sequences of the random peptide insert were obtained by BigDye Terminator cycle-sequencing with standard M13–40 primer on an Applied Biosystems 877/377 system using double-stranded, purified DNA (QIAprep). Peptide Synthesis—Peptides were synthesized in our peptide synthesis facility using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry in a solid-phase synthesizer. The peptides were purified by high performance liquid chromatography, and their sequence and structure were confirmed by mass spectrometry. Animals—Green fluorescent protein (GFP) (22Hadjantonakis A.K. Gertsenstein M. Ikawa M. Okabe M. Nagy A. Mech. Dev. 1998; 76: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) and NCAM-deficient (11Chazal G. Durbec P. Jankovski A. Rougon G. Cremer H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1446-1457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) mice have been described previously. Animal experimentation conformed to European Community guidelines. Immunohistochemistry—Fixed dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explants were incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with anti-neurofilament (mouse IgG, SMI-31, dilution 1:800, Sternberger Monoclonals). Brain sections were incubated at 4 °C overnight with MenB anti-PSA Ab (mouse IgM, dilution 1:200) (23Rougon G. Dubois C. Buckley N. Magnani J.L. Zollinger W. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2429-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) and 5 min at room temperature in Hoescht (Sigma, dilution 1:100). Revelation was performed by 1-h incubation with the corresponding fluorescent-labeled secondary Abs. SVZ Explant Culture—Cultures of subventricular zone (SVZ) explants were performed as described in Chazal et al. (11Chazal G. Durbec P. Jankovski A. Rougon G. Cremer H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1446-1457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1-day-old mice were killed by rapid decapitation. Brains were dissected and sectioned by Vibratome (Leica). The SVZ from the lateral wall of the anterior lateral ventricle horn was dissected in Hanks' balanced salt solution medium (Invitrogen) and cut into 200- to 300-μm diameter explants. The explants were mixed with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and cultured in four-well dishes. After polymerization, the gel was overlaid with 400 μl of serum-free medium containing B-27 supplement (Invitrogen) in the presence of 40 μm peptides (p1, p2, reverse p1) and/or 70 units of EndoN/ml. DRG Explant Cultures—DRGs were dissected from 13.5-day-old mouse embryos in Hanks' balanced salt solution medium and seeded on glass coverslips coated with polylysine. Explants were cultured in the presence or absence of the peptides (40 μm) in 2 ml of neurobasal medium supplemented as described in Chazal et al. (11Chazal G. Durbec P. Jankovski A. Rougon G. Cremer H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1446-1457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Migration, Neurite Outgrowth, and Fasciculation—After 48 h in culture, explants were examined directly (SVZ) or after overnight fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and immunostaining (DRGs). Observation was done using an Axiovert 35M (Zeiss, Germany). Images were collected with a video camera (Cool View, Photonic Science) and analyzed using image-processing software (Visiolab 1000, Biocom). Mean migration distance (calculated on five independent experiments, including at least five explants per condition) or mean length of the neurites (based on three independent experiments, including at least eight explants per condition) was the distance (in μm) between the explant edge and the border of the cell or axon migration front. Four measurements were performed for each explant. Fasciculation was estimated by drawing a circle at 1500 μm for p1 and 1150 μm for reverse p1 from the explant center and by counting for each explant (eight explants/condition examined) the total number of single axons and bundles crossing the circle. Fasciculation index was calculated as the ratio of the number of bundle/single axons for each explant analyzed. Intravitreal Injections and Retinal Whole Mount—Injections were performed as described in Monnier et al. (24Monnier P.P. Beck S.G. Bolz J. Henke-Fahle S. Dev. Biol. 2001; 229: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Briefly, a 2 × 2-cm window was cut into the shell over E3 embryos. p1 or reverse peptide (10 mm) was injected in 1 μl of Fast green into the right eye vitreous body using a capillary. After a 5-day incubation at 37 °C (embryonic day 8 (E8)), retinae were dissected, spread onto nitrocellulose filters (Millipore, 0.45 μm), and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Two small 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) crystals were applied dorsally to the optic fissure. Retinae were stored in the dark at 37 °C for 10 days until the dye reached the axonal growth cones in the fissure, mounted in glycerol/PBS (9:1), and analyzed using confocal microscopy. Three experiments were done, including at least three retinae per condition. Transplantation—100-μm diameter explants from 1-day-old GFP mice SVZ were incubated (15 min) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence or absence of p1 or reverse peptide (10 mm) and stereotaxically grafted (0.5 μl) into 6-week-old mice SVZ (as described in Lois and Alvarez-Buylla, Ref. 25Lois C. Alvarez-Buylla A. Science. 1994; 264: 1145-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar). Animals were perfused intracardially with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS 3 or 4 days after the graft. Brains were dissected, postfixed, cryoprotected, and frozen in isopentane. Sagittal serial sections (12 μm) were cut with a Leica microtome and immunostained as described above for PSA. GFP-positive and GFP/PSA-positive cells in the olfactory bulb were observed with a 40× objective (Axioscope Zeiss, Germany) and counted on all consecutive sections to get the total number of labeled cells/olfactory bulb in two independent experiments (four animals per condition). For all experiments, the significant differences between the control conditions and the experimental conditions were calculated using a Student's unpaired t test. Selection of Phage Clones and Analysis of Their Binding Properties—Biopanning of a phage library displaying constrained random nonamer cyclic peptides with 30H12 anti-PSA Ab-coated magnetic beads (see “Experimental Procedures”) readily enriched for Ab-specific phage clones. Thirty-four monoclones bound to the Ab after three cycles of biopanning, and they did not bind to an irrelevant Ab of the same isotype. DNA from 13 of these monoclones were prepared and sequenced (Fig. 1A). For MK8, the random insert is only eight amino acids long. Most likely, this results from a deletion, but the phage still represented a specific binder. MK3, -5, and -9 exhibited the same sequence, and the WP motif was found in 5 of 13 clones. Although the peptide inserts are most likely responsible for the binding of the phage particles to the Ab, it is possible that other parts of the phage protein may also be critical for binding. To directly investigate the role of the peptide inserts, the corresponding peptides were synthesized, coupled to bovine serum albumin (BSA), and tested for binding to the PSA Ab in ELISA. All 13 BSA-linked peptides bound to the 30H12 Ab. Peptides p1, which corresponds to phage MK6, and p2, which corresponds to phage MK11 (Fig. 1B), were chosen for further studies. These peptides are PSA mimotopes, as pre-incubation of the 30H12 Ab with 0.1 mm of either peptide prevented its binding to PSA-NCAM expressing cells (Fig. 1, E versus C), whereas pre-incubation with similar concentrations of the reverse peptides had no effect upon the antibody binding to cells (data not shown). PSA is a long polymer known to adopt a helical conformation (26Brisson J.R. Baumann H. Imberty A. Perez S. Jennings H.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4996-5004Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and to form filament bundles (27Toikka J. Aalto J. Hayrinen J. Pelliniemi L.J. Finne J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28557-28559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), thus exhibiting several epitopes. The binding specificity was examined in greater detail by testing peptide recognition by another anti-PSA Ab (MenB of the IgM class) (23Rougon G. Dubois C. Buckley N. Magnani J.L. Zollinger W. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2429-2437Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The peptides bound only to 30H12, which is the monoclonal Ab used for the selection, and pre-incubation of anti-MenB with the peptides did not prevent recognition of PSA-NCAM (Fig. 1D). Thus, the peptide mimotopes seem to be specific for a unique (idiotypic) determinant. PSA Mimotope Peptides Modulate Fasciculation and Axon Outgrowth—The two cyclic peptides, p1 and p2, were tested for their ability to modulate axonal growth and fasciculation, two events known to involve PSA (2Rougon G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 61: 197-207PubMed Google Scholar, 9Rutishauser U. Landmesser L. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 422-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Mouse DRG explants were cultured in the presence of the peptides added in soluble form to the culture medium. Reverse peptides were used as controls. The effects of the peptides on neurite outgrowth and fasciculation were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively (Fig. 2). Whereas their respective reverse peptides had no effect, both p1 and p2 induced striking defasciculation of axon bundles (Fig. 2, B versus A and D versus C) and stimulation of neurite outgrowth (Fig. 2, B versus A). Quantitative analysis showed that p1 and p2 increased neurite outgrowth by 34 and 21%, respectively, compared with the reverse peptide controls (Fig. 2, E and F), whereas they decreased the fasciculation index (0.51 for reverse p1 versus 0.24 for p1; p < 0.05) (Fig. 2G). These experiments demonstrated that the PSA mimotope peptides exhibit bioactivity in in vitro tests. To examine further whether p1 and p2 peptides were able to exert the same effects in vivo, we chose to test their action upon the guidance of ganglion cell axons toward the optic fissure in the chicken retina, an event shown to be dependent upon PSA expression (24Monnier P.P. Beck S.G. Bolz J. Henke-Fahle S. Dev. Biol. 2001; 229: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The mimetic peptides or the control reverse peptides were injected into chicken embryo eyes at E3, and the trajectory of retinal ganglion cell axons was observed at E9, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The presence of PSA mimotope peptides during retina development altered axon guidance and fasciculation (Fig. 3). Several fibers defasciculated from axon bundles, even running perpendicularly to them (Fig. 3, E and F). These guidance errors were never detected after injection of control peptides (Fig. 3, C and D). These experiments demonstrated that the PSA mimotope peptides exhibit bioactivity in vivo. PSA Mimotope Peptides Increase the Migration of PSA-positive Cells in a PSA-dependent Fashion—In a second set of experiments, we evaluated the ability of the PSA mimotope peptides to influence cell migration, another PSA-regulated event (Fig. 4). Neuronal precursor cell migration from the SVZ toward the olfactory bulb is severely impaired in PSA-NCAM-deficient mice (10Ono K. Tomasiewicz H. Magnuson T. Rutishauser U. Neuron. 1994; 13: 395-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 11Chazal G. Durbec P. Jankovski A. Rougon G. Cremer H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1446-1457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The role of PSA in migration was further evidenced when SVZ explants were cultured in the presence of EndoN, which prevented neuroblasts to exit from the explant and to migrate in a chain-like fashion (Fig. 4, B and E, and Ref. 11Chazal G. Durbec P. Jankovski A. Rougon G. Cremer H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1446-1457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test the effect of PSA mimotope peptides upon cell migration in vitro, we analyzed mouse SVZ explants cultured in Matrigel in the presence of p1 or p2 or the reverse peptides. We observed that addition of the mimotope peptides to the culture increased the distance of migration of neuronal precursors from the core explant (Fig. 4, C and F). This effect was not found with the reverse peptides (Fig. 4, A and D). The dose-response curve of p1 showed that a maximal effect upon cell migration was observed starting from and above concentrations of 0.4 μm peptide (Fig. 4I). Moreover, we showed that cyclization was a prerequisite for the promoting effect of p1 peptide because the corresponding amino acid sequence in a linear form, either N-acetylated or not, was unable to stimulate cell migration (Fig. 4J). When PSA was removed from the cultures by EndoN treatment, the peptides were no longer able to modulate cell migration, indicating that their bioactivity is PSA-dependent. Likewise, quantitative analysis (Fig. 4, G and H) demonstrated that p1 and p2 induced a significant increase in the distance the neuronal precursors migrated from the explant (+40 and +26%, respectively, at 40 μm, compared with the control), whereas EndoN decreased it both in the presence and absence of the peptide (-21% compared with the control). To ascertain the PSA-dependence of the peptide effect upon migration, we performed the same experiments using SVZ explants from PSA-NCAM-deficient mice (11Chazal G. Durbec P. Jankovski A. Rougon G. Cremer H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1446-1457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected (11Chazal G. Durbec P. Jankovski A. Rougon G. Cremer H. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1446-1457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a significant reduction of precursor cell migration was observed in the PSA-NCAM-/- explants by comparison to the control PSA-NCAM+/-. The presence of p1 did not restore migration of PSA-NCAM-deficient cells (Fig. 4K). Moreover, the data were similar in EndoN-treated PSA-NCAM+/- and PSA-NCAM-/- explants. Altogether, these experiments revealed a co-dependence between PSA expression and the stimulatory effect of the mimotope peptides. PSA Mimotope p1 Increases the Migration of Transplanted Neural Progenitors—Peptide p1 was taken forward for testing in in vivo models. We set up transplantation experiments (Fig. 5A) to test its ability to stimulate migration of PSA-expressing cells. We grafted calibrated pieces of SVZ tissue from 1-day-old GFP-expressing mice (22Hadjantonakis A.K. Gertsenstein M. Ikawa M. Okabe M. Nagy A. Mech. Dev. 1998; 76: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar) into the anterior SVZ area of adult mice and compared the migration of GFP-labeled progenitors toward the olfactory bulb in the presence of p1, reverse p1 (0.5 μl at 10 mm co-injected with the grafted tissues), or in the absence of peptide. After grafting, GFP-positive cells were observed along the rostral migratory stream, a pathway known to depend upon PSA. All of these cells were both GFP- and PSA- positive and integrated among host cells (Fig. 5B). No significant difference was found between experiments in the absence of peptide (data not shown) and with reverse p1. The number of migrating cells was dramatically increased by p1 (Fig. 5, F versus D). This effect was observed as early as 3 days after engraftment (Fig. 5, E versus C). Quantitative analyses were made by counting the total number of GFP-positive and GFP/PSA-positive cells (four animals examined for each condition) that reached the olfactory bulb 3 days after grafting. The number of GFP-positive cells in the bulb was ∼17-fold higher in the presence of p1 (Fig. 5, E and G), and no significant difference could be found between the numbers of GFP- and GFP/PSA- positive cells (Fig. 5G) at this stage in the bulb whatever the experimental condition. These data further confirm bioactivity of the PSA mimotope peptides and support its PSA-dependent enhancing effect upon migration. Until now, PSA function could be manipulated only by reducing its expression. This has been achieved by genetic engineering (7Eckhardt M. Bukalo O. Chazal G. Wang L. Goridis C. Schachner M. Gerardy-Schahn R. Cremer H. Dityatev A. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 5234-5244Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), EndoN enzymatic digestion (6Theodosis D.T. Bonhomme R. Vitiello S. Rougon G. Poulain D.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 10228-10236Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ono K. Tomasiewicz H. Magnuson T. Rutishauser U. Neuron. 1994; 13: 395-609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 28Decker L. Avellana-Adalid V. Nait-Oumesmar B. Durbec P. Baron Van Evercooren A. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2000; 16: 422-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), or by the use of a small molecule, N-butanoylmannosamine, which is able to reversibly inhibit PSA synthesis in vitro (29Mahal L.K. Charter N.W. Angata K. Fukuda M. Koshland Jr., D.E. Bertozzi C.R. Science. 2001; 294: 380-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 30Charter N.W. Mahal L.K. Koshland Jr., D.E. Bertozzi C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9255-9261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, the feasibility of enhancing PSA activity has not yet been demonstrated either in vitro or in vivo. Here, we characterized oligopeptide mimotopes of PSA and evaluated their bioactivity. The selected peptides do not seem to have the characteristics of polysialic acid such as negatively charged amino acids. Indeed, because of its polyanionic nature, PSA epitopes would be expected to employ marked electrostatic components in their binding events. A possibility is that the binding is based upon hydrogen bonding and Van der Waals interactions, none of which involves charged groups. Peptide p1 contains two S and three T amino acids, all with a hydroxyl group on their side chains which can be involved in hydrogen bonding (31Shin J.S. Yu J. Lin J. Zhong L. Bren K.L. Nahm M.H. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 6273-6278Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In a recent study, however, Hayrinen et al. (32Hayrinen J. Haseley S. Talaga P. Muhlenhoff M. Finne J. Vliegenthart J.F. Mol. Immunol. 2002; 39: 399-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) studied the effects of cations on antibody binding properties and affinities. Interestingly, their results show that the interaction is influenced by divalent cations (such as Ca2+ or Mn2+) and polyamines. One possible explanation for this could be that under physiological conditions, Ca2+ neutralizes the carboxyl groups and plays a significant role in the regulation of the PSA epitopes presentation in vivo. In culture, the peptides promoted axon growth and defasciculation and migration of neural progenitors. In vivo the peptides modified the trajectory of retinal ganglion cell axons and dramatically enhanced migration of grafted neuronal progenitors. So far, the prevailing idea is that PSA could be viewed as a steric regulator of membrane-membrane apposition, which serves to attenuate a variety of cell-cell interactions, thus allowing movement. Through selective elimination of PSA on NCAM by EndoN, it has been possible to demonstrate in many different systems that PSA-NCAM favors defasciculation, axon growth, branching, and synapse formation. In the neuromuscular system for example, removal of PSA results in numerous defects, such as innervation of inappropriate muscles and a reduction in nerve branching and the number of synapses (33Landmesser L. Dahm L. Tang J.C. Rutishauser U. Neuron. 1990; 4: 655-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar, 34Tang J. Landmesser L. Rutishauser U. Neuron. 1992; 8: 1031-1044Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 35Tang J. Rutishauser U. Landmesser L. Neuron. 1994; 13: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Similarly, removal of PSA on NCAM was found to be associated with aberrant mossy fiber innervation and ectopic synaptic boutons in the hippocampus (36Seki T. Rutishauser U. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3757-3766Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our selected mimotope peptides are able to stimulate neurite outgrowth in vitro and to dramatically increase axon defasciculation and cell migration both in vitro and in vivo. Therefore, our observations support a PSA mimetic function of the selected peptides. What are the mechanisms underlying misguidance of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons after p1 peptide injection? Both axon defasciculation and cell migration involve decreased adhesion between axons and between migrating cells and their substrates. If we consider that the peptides modulate the classical steric function of PSA, p1 on PSA-positive axon tracts would modify the balance of interactions, and its effect has to be explained by the nature of the environment. Indeed, the environment could exhibit powerful and stable adhesive attractants, functionally affected by the presence of the peptide. This in turn could induce axons to follow more independent, less fasciculated pathways. Alternatively, we can consider a non-steric function of PSA during axon outgrowth of the RGC. As suggested by Monnier et al. (24Monnier P.P. Beck S.G. Bolz J. Henke-Fahle S. Dev. Biol. 2001; 229: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), in the chick retinae, PSA could be involved in the recognition or could be part of the receptor complex for a soluble guidance cue playing a role in orienting the growth cones. PSA could bind to this secreted component, thus keeping it at a high concentration at the surface of RGC cells. Peptide p1 might interfere with the binding of this diffusible cue or titrate it, thus modifying signaling and inducing a misrouting of the PSA-positive axons. Among diffusible candidate molecules are FGF, netrin-1, and slit, which have been shown to play a role in the development of the RGC (37Stuermer C.A. Bastmeyer M. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 62: 197-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In support of this idea, additional mechanisms for PSA action have recently been proposed that suggest an instructive role for PSA in cell interactions (13Vutskits L. Djebbara-Hannas Z. Zhang H. Paccaud J.P. Durbec P. Rougon G. Muller D. Kiss J.Z. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Zhang H. Vutskits L. Calaora V. Durbec P. Kiss J.Z. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 38Marx M. Rutishauser U. Bastmeyer M. Development. 2001; 128: 4949-4958PubMed Google Scholar). For example, the BDNF neurotrophin receptor TrkB has been proposed as an interacting partner at synapses. The addition of BDNF rescued the deleterious effect of PSA removal on differentiation and survival of cultured cortical neuron (13Vutskits L. Djebbara-Hannas Z. Zhang H. Paccaud J.P. Durbec P. Rougon G. Muller D. Kiss J.Z. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the defect in hippocampus synaptic plasticity associated with elimination of PSA by EndoN (12Muller D. Djebbara-Hannas Z. Jourdain P. Vutskits L. Durbec P. Rougon G. Kiss J.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4315-4320Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In support of possible cross-talk between PSA and BDNF signaling, the level of TrkB phosphorylation was found to be decreased in NCAM-deficient mice and EndoN-treated cultures (13Vutskits L. Djebbara-Hannas Z. Zhang H. Paccaud J.P. Durbec P. Rougon G. Muller D. Kiss J.Z. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2001; 13: 1391-1402Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is tempting to propose that mimotope peptides influence BDNF signaling. Another possibility is that they influence glial-derived neurotrophic factor signaling as it has been shown recently that the PSA carrier NCAM can function as a signaling receptor for members of the GDNF ligand family and that migration of neuroblasts toward the bulb is influenced by glial-derived neurotrophic factor, although the effect of PSA has not yet been examined in this interaction (39Paratcha G. Ledda F. Ibanez C.F. Cell. 2003; 113: 867-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). Experiments using tissue either from NCAM-deficient mice or EndoN-treatment showed that the effect of the mimotope peptides depends upon the cellular expression of PSA. This intriguing observation invites further speculation on the mechanisms of peptide action. It is possible that the peptides are recognized as ligands by still unidentified PSA receptors. If this were the case, the peptides should have improved migration of PSA-NCAM-deficient neuroblasts, unless expression of putative PSA receptors is also perturbed in the deficient mice. Alternatively, the cyclic mimotope which forms a small molecular ring with little conformational freedom and can assume only a restricted set of conformations (31Shin J.S. Yu J. Lin J. Zhong L. Bren K.L. Nahm M.H. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 6273-6278Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) may bind to PSA chains themselves, and, by changing their conformation or binding properties, may potentiate PSA effects. More studies will be required to examine these possibilities. Whatever their mode of action, the characterized peptides might prove useful in central nervous system regenerative strategies. From a therapeutic perspective, these mimetic peptides exhibit many advantages. They act extracellularly, they are biocompatible, and their stability seems to be sufficient to detect observable effects after in vivo delivery. This happened to be true for injection in the developing eye, in which perturbations of axon guidance could be observed as late as 5 days after the injection, as well as for cell grafting, in which a dramatic effect was observed 4 days after the graft. After central nervous system injuries, one of the most important challenges is to design ways to promote the intrinsic capacity of the sprouting and growth of the lesioned axons. Such lesioned axons, at least in the central nervous system, very often re-express PSA-NCAM (4Aubert I. Ridet J.L. Schachner M. Rougon G. Gage F.H. Comp. Neurol. 1998; 399: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 5Muller D. Stoppini L. Wang C. Kiss J.Z. Neuroscience. 1994; 61: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Notably, the PSA-dependence of the mimetic peptides will be an asset, as their effect will be confined to the cells to be stimulated. In central nervous system neurodegenerative diseases, grafting neuronal precursors in the patient's brain to replace lost neurons is presently considered to be a promising medical advance (40Le Belle J.E. Svendsen C.N. BioDrugs. 2002; 16: 389-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). One important step in such an approach is to speed migration of the grafted precursors toward the damaged areas. In the context of this research, a clinically important feature relates to our observation that the mimotope peptides could be powerful adjuvants in cell therapy to increase migration of grafted PSA-positive cells. Here again, the PSA-mimotope peptide co-dependence might be considered to be an advantage, as most of the progenitors selected for grafting into patients should be PSA-positive. In addition to their therapeutic use, PSA mimetic peptides might also prove to be useful complementary tools to uncover mechanisms of action and unknown functions of PSA. We thank C. Giribone and S. Nicolas for excellent technical assistance and Drs. V. Castellani and C. Henderson for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W1983024844,"Methanococcus jannaschii MJ0936 is a hypothetical protein of unknown function with over 50 homologs found in many bacteria and Archaea. To help define the molecular (biochemical and biophysical) function of MJ0936, we determined its crystal structure at 2.4-Å resolution and performed a series of biochemical screens for catalytic activity. The overall fold of this single domain protein consists of a four-layered structure formed by two β-sheets flanked by α-helices on both sides. The crystal structure suggested its biochemical function to be a nuclease, phosphatase, or nucleotidase, with a requirement for some metal ions. Crystallization in the presence of Ni2+ or Mn2+ produced a protein containing a binuclear metal center in the putative active site formed by a cluster of conserved residues. Analysis of MJ0936 against a panel of general enzymatic assays revealed catalytic activity toward bis-p-nitrophenyl phosphate, an indicator substrate for phosphodiesterases and nucleases. Significant activity was also found with two other phosphodiesterase substrates, thymidine 5′-monophosphate p-nitrophenyl ester and p-nitrophenylphosphorylcholine, but no activity was found for cAMP or cGMP. Phosphodiesterase activity of MJ0936 had an absolute requirement for divalent metal ions with Ni2+ and Mn2+ being most effective. Thus, our structural and enzymatic studies have identified the biochemical function of MJ0936 as that of a novel phosphodiesterase.

Thus, our structural and enzymatic studies have identified the biochemical function of MJ0936 as that of a novel phosphodiesterase. Several hundred genomes have been sequenced so far, but no function can be inferred from the gene sequence of about half of the genes. Structural information may provide new clues as to the molecular (biochemical and biophysical) functions of the proteins coded by these genes of unknown functions. An open reading frame from Methanococcus jannaschii, MJ0936 (GI 1499771), is annotated as a conserved hypothetical protein in the PEDANT sequence data base (1Frishman D. Kosykh D. Kastenmuller G. Kolesov G. Zubrzycki I. Gruber C. Geier B. Kaps A. Albermann K. Volz A. Wagner C. Fellenberg M. Heumann K. Mewes H.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 207-211Google Scholar). A PSI-PHI BLAST search found 56 bacterial or archaeal homologs with E value less than 0.003. Some of the homologs are annotated, and they can be grouped into three categories: (i) (conserved) hypothetical protein; (ii) VPS29-like (human vacuolar protein-sorting protein) phosphoesterase-related protein; (iii) predicted/putative/probable phosphoesterase. Similarly, a Pfam (2Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Howe K.L. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 30: 276-280Google Scholar) search suggests that this gene may belong to a protein family of calcineurin-like phosphoesterase. This Pfam protein family contains a large range of phosphoesterases, including protein phosphoserine phosphatases, nucleotidases, sphingomyelin phosphodiesterases, 2′,3′-cyclic AMP phosphodiesterases, and nucleases such as bacterial SbcD or yeast MRE11, as well as the VPS29-like phosphoesterase-related proteins mentioned above. Presumed metal-chelating residues are found to be conserved for the proteins of this family. To determine the function of MJ0936 and its homologues, we have solved the crystal structure of this protein and performed a series of biochemical screenings for catalytic activity. Through a combination of structural and enzymatic analyses, we show that MJ0936 is a novel phosphodiesterase, and its three-dimensional structure disclosed key conserved residues involved in catalysis and metal binding. Cloning—Primers (Operon, Emeryville, CA) for PCR amplification contained an NdeI restriction site in the forward primer (5′-CATATGAAAATTGGGATAATGAGCG) and BamHI site in the reverse primer (5′-GGATCCTTACTCTAACACTATCTCCCTATACTCCTTCT). PCR was performed using Deep Vent Polymerase (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA) and M. jannaschii genomic DNA. The PCR product was cloned into pCR-BluntII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) and the MJ0936 gene insert was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The amplified TOPO vector was restricted with NdeI and BamHI and the gene insert was purified by agarose gel electrophoresis extraction. This insert was ligated into pSKB3 (gift from Steve Burley, Rockefeller University, New York), digested with NdeI and BamHI, and transformed into DH5α. A plasmid containing the gene insert was confirmed and then transformed into BL21(DE3)pSJS1244 (3Kim R. Sandler S.J. Goldman S. Yokota H. Clark A.J. Kim S.H. Biotechnol. Lett. 1998; 20: 207-210Google Scholar). Protein Expression and Purification—His-tagged protein MJ0936 was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)/pSJS1244 (3Kim R. Sandler S.J. Goldman S. Yokota H. Clark A.J. Kim S.H. Biotechnol. Lett. 1998; 20: 207-210Google Scholar) cells upon induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Selenomethionyl protein was prepared according to the method of Doublie (4Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-529Google Scholar). Bacteria were lysed by sonication in Buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml antipain, 1 μg/ml chymostatin, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin A) and cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 39,000 × g for 20 min in a Sorvall centrifuge. The lysate was then spun in a Beckman ultracentrifuge Ti45 rotor at 60,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to remove membrane proteins. The His-tagged MJ0936 protein was affinity purified from the soluble fraction using Talon metal affinity resin (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer, elution was achieved with 600 mm imidazole. The eluted sample was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA. The target protein was bound onto a 5-ml HiTrap Q column (Amersham Biosciences) and eluted with a 10-column volume linear gradient from 0.1 to 0.75 m NaCl in the same buffer. The purity of the expressed protein was determined by SDS-gel electrophoresis and the molecular weight was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry. The protein was concentrated in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl to 10 to 20 mg/ml. Enzymatic Assays—General enzymatic screens for various activities (phosphatase, phosphodiesterase, nuclease, esterase, protease, dehydrogenase, oxidase, and sulfatase) were performed in 96-well microplates at 70 °C as previously described (5Yang Z. Savchenko A. Yakunin A. Zhang R. Edwards A. Arrowsmith C. Tong L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8804-8808Google Scholar, 6Sanishvili R. Yakunin A.F. Laskowski R.A. Skarina T. Evdokimova E. Doherty-Kirby A. Lajoie G.A. Thornton J.M. Arrowsmith C.H. Savchenko A. Joachimiak A. Edwards A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26039-26045Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of single-stranded M13 DNA or double-stranded λ DNA or E. coli genomic DNA was assayed by analyzing reaction products by agarose gel electrophoresis. Hydrolysis of RNA (yeast RNA type III) was analyzed by following the change in absorbance at 260 nm after 30 min incubation with MJ0936. Hydrolysis of cyclic mononucleotides (2′,3′-cAMP, 2′,3′-cGMP, 3′,5′-cAMP, and 3′,5′-cGMP) was probed using Sigma 5′-nucleotidase and malachite green reagent to detect the released inorganic phosphate (7Vogel A. Schilling O. Niecke M. Bettmer J. Meyer-Klaucke W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 29078-29085Google Scholar). Phosphatase activity toward diverse physiological phosphatase substrates (pyrophosphate, nucleotides, phosphorylated carbohydrates, and amino acids) was investigated by detection of released phosphate using the malachite green reagent (8Baykov A.A. Evtushenko O.A. Avaeva S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 171: 266-270Google Scholar). Phospholipase C activity was analyzed using p-nitrophenylphosphoryl choline (pNPPC) 1The abbreviations used are: pNPPC, p-nitrophenylphosphoryl choline; pNPP, bis(p-nitrophenyl)phosphate; pNP, p-nitrophenyl phosphate; TMP-pNP, thymidine 5′-monophosphate p-nitrophenyl ester. (9Kurioka S. Matsuda M. Biochemistry. 1976; 75: 281-289Google Scholar). Phospholipase D activity against phosphatidylcholine was probed using choline oxidase (Sigma) and the peroxidase dianisidine-coupled assay as for oxidase testing (10Kelly R.L. Reddy C.A. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 161: 307-316Google Scholar). For phosphodiesterase kinetic studies, all phosphodiesterase assays were performed in a buffer containing 50 mm diethanolamine, pH 9.8, 40 mm NaCl, and MJ0936 (0.02 μg/ml) with different concentrations of substrates (bis-pNPP, pNP-TMP, and pNPPC) and metals (Ni2+ and Mn2+). The specific activity was determined as micromoles of product per min per mg of protein. The Lineweaver-Burk treatment of experimental data gave a linear plot of 1/V versus 1/[substrate]. According to the rearranged Michaelis-Menten equation, 1/V = 1/Vmax + Km/Vmax·1/[substrate], the Km and Vmax were determined from the Lineweaver-Burk plot using the GraphPad Prism program (version 4.00 for Windows, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), and kcat was determined by kcat = Vmax/[enzyme]. The optimum pH was examined in the presence of 50 mm glycine buffer, 40 mm NaCl, 7 mm Ni2+, 0.7 mm bis-pNPP, 0.1 μg of MJ0936, at pH values ranging from 8.6 to 10.4. Crystallization—Crystallization conditions were screened with a sparse matrix sampling method (11Jancarik J. Kim S.H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Google Scholar) using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique at room temperature with commercially prepared reagents (Hampton Research, Laguna Niguel, CA). Selenomethionyl crystals of protein in the absence of exogenous metal (native crystals) were grown by vapor diffusion at 20 °C in a solution containing 15 mg/ml protein, 0.7 m ammonium sulfate. Magnesium-soaked crystals were obtained by soaking the native crystal with 20 mm magnesium sulfate in the crystallization drops. Co-crystals with magnesium, nickel, or manganese were grown by vapor diffusion at 20 °C in a solution containing 15 mg/ml protein, 0.7 m ammonium sulfate, 20 mm magnesium sulfate, or 5 mm nickel sulfate or 5 mm manganese sulfate. All the crystals were flash-frozen in a solution containing 0.7 m ammonium sulfate, 30% ethylene glycol and mounted on loops at 100 K prior to data collection. Structure Solution and Refinement—For native (unsoaked; selenium-Met) crystals, selenium edge (0.9790 Å) single anomalous dispersion data set was collected to 3.0 Å at the Advance Light Source beam line 5.0.2 using the ADSC Quantum 210 CCD detector placed 250 mm from the sample. High resolution data set was also collected to 2.4 Å at the Advance Light Source beam line 5.0.1 using the ADSC Quantum 210 CCD detector at a wavelength of 1.0 Å. The data were processed using programs HKL2000 and SCALEPACK (12Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 276: 307-326Google Scholar). X-ray data statistics are shown in Table I. The 6 selenium sites were located using CNS (13Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). Phases were subject to 8 cycles of refinement and solvent flattening (14Wang B.-C. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 115: 90-112Google Scholar) followed by phase extension to 2.4 Å. The figure-of-merit after phase extension achieved 0.92 overall and 0.91 in the 2.4-Å resolution shell. The model building was performed using O (15Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Google Scholar). The initial model was traced in the 2.4-Å NCS averaged experimental map for a monomer. A model containing 330 residues was derived from progressive improvement of the electron density map using rounds of phase combination and manual building. The preliminary model was then refined to 2.4-Å resolution using CNS (13Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Google Scholar). The 2-fold NCS restraints were used during the refinement. Ten percent of the data were randomly selected for free R factor cross-validation. The refinement statistics are shown in Table II.

The initial phasing models were derived from the partially refined structure of native MJ0936 crystal by the molecular replacement method using AMORE (16Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

Ten percent of the data were randomly selected for free R factor cross-validation. The refinement statistics are shown in Table II. Atomic coordinates have been deposited at the Protein Data Bank with access codes 1S3M and 1S3N for manganese complex and nickel complex, respectively. The programs MOLSCRIPT (17Kraulis P. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Google Scholar) and GRASP (18Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honig B. Proteins. 1991; 11: 281-296Google Scholar) were used for preparation of the figures. Sequence Analysis—Over 50 full-length sequence homologs of this protein have sequence identity ranging from 100 to 24%. Selected homologs are aligned together and shown in Fig. 1. This sequence alignment reveals that there are six highly conversed regions in this protein family: (i) residues 7 to 11, a SDXHD motif; (ii) residues 33 to 36, a HXGD motif; (iii) residues 58 to 62, a GNNDG motif; (iv) residues 97 to 99, a HGX motif; (v) residues 119 to 122, a GHTH motif; and (vi) residues 136 to 139, a NPGE motif. These residues are not only conserved in the aligned 10 sequences shown in Fig. 1, but were also found to be highly conserved in the 49 full-length homologs in this protein family. There are five histidines among these motifs, suggesting that most of these sequence motifs may be involved in metal binding. Enzymatic Studies of MJ0936 —Purified MJ0936 protein was probed for enzymatic activity in the presence of 5 mm Mg2+ using several general enzymatic assays (see “Experimental Procedures”). No activity toward phosphatase, protease, esterase, dehydrogenase, or oxidase indicator substrates was detected, but the protein showed low but detectable phosphodiesterase activity with bis-pNPP in the presence of Mg2+. This substrate is cleaved into p-nitrophenol and pNPP. However, no activity toward pNPP was found in phosphatase screens (data not shown), suggesting that MJ0936 is a phosphodiesterase and does not act on phosphomonoesters. Significant activity was also found with TMP-pNP (phosphodiesterase/nuclease substrate) and pNPPC (phosphodiesterase/phospholipase substrate). However, MJ0936 did not demonstrate phosphodiesterase activity with cAMP or cGMP (2′,3′ or 3′,5′ forms), nuclease activity with various substrates (single-stranded ϕX174 DNA, double-stranded λ DNA or E. coli DNA, yeast RNA), nor phospholipase activity toward phosphatidylcholine. MJ0936 showed maximal activity at pH 9.4–9.8 and had an absolute requirement for a divalent metal ion with Ni2+ and Mn2+ being most effective (Fig. 2A). At a low concentration (1 mm) of bis-pNPP, Ni2+ supported higher phosphodiesterase activity (kcat = 114.2 ± 9.4 s-1; KNi = 0.28 ± 0.09 mm), which saturated quickly at an intermediate bis-pNPP concentration. On the other hand, Mn2+ had much higher affinity (kcat = 19.1 ± 0.5 s-1; KMn = 1.3 ± 0.1 μm) and its activity continued to increase at intermediate and high concentrations of bis-pNPP (Fig. 2, B and C). Very low phosphodiesterase activity was also observed with 0.5 mm Co2+ (Fig. 2A) or 20 mm Mg2+ (data not shown). To our knowledge, MJ0936 is the first Ni2+-dependent phosphodiesterase. We also measured the dependence of the velocity of the reaction on the substrate concentration for bis-pNPP, TMP-pNP, and pNPPC in the presence of 1 mm Ni2+ or 20 μm Mn2+ (Fig. 3, A–F). With pNPPC, MJ0936 showed classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with both metals, but with bis-pNPP or TMP-pNP a typical hyperbolic curve was observed only in the presence of Ni2+ (Fig. 3, A–F). With Mn2+, the curves for both substrates did not show hyperbolic behavior (Fig. 3, A–F), and for bis-pNPP no saturation was observed with substrate concentrations up to 20 mm (data not shown). With Ni2+, MJ0936 had the highest affinity to TMP-pNP (Km = 0.035 ± 0.003 mm), but the turnover number kcat and the catalytic efficiency kcat/Km for bis-pNPP was significantly higher than for the other substrates (Table III).Table IIISteady-state kinetic parameters for MJ0936 determined with Ni2+ or Mn2+Variable substrateKmkcatkcat/Kmmms-1m-1 s-1bis-pNPP (1 mm Ni2+)0.15 ± 0.01105.7 ± 2.87.1 × 105TMP-pNP (1 mm Ni2+)0.035 ± 0.0033.26 ± 0.0069.4 × 104pNPPC (1 mm Ni2+)3.33 ± 0.58.6 ± 0.50.26 × 104pNPPC (20 μm Mn2+)1.53 ± 0.152.9 ± 1.03.5 × 104bis-pNPPaDetermined with 1 mm Ni2+ (20 mm PO43−)0.66 ± 0.09125.9 ± 8.11.96 × 105bis-pNPPaDetermined with 1 mm Ni2+ (50 mm PO43−)1.01 ± 0.13130.2 ± 8.61.29 × 105a Determined with 1 mm Ni2+ Open table in a new tab Because inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry revealed the presence of phosphate in purified MJ0936, we checked the effect of free phosphate on the hydrolysis of bis-pNPP in the presence of 1 mm Ni2+. The enzyme is inhibited by phosphate with 50% inhibition being observed at 30 mm (PO43−). As presented in Fig. 3, G and H, the inhibition was competitive and resulted in a significant increase in Km for bis-pNPP (Table III). Overall Structure—The final model includes all residues of MJ0936, most of which are well defined in the electron density map. The model has been refined at 2.4-Å resolution to a crystallographic R factor of 22.5%. The root mean square deviations from ideal stereochemistry are 0.012 Å for bond lengths, 1.8 Å for bond angles, and 0.93° for improper angles. The mean positional error in atomic coordinates for the refined model is estimated to be 0.33 Å by a Luzzati plot (19Luzzati V. Acta Crystallogr. 1952; 5: 802-810Google Scholar). The Ramachandran plot produced with PROCHECK (20Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallog. 1993; 26: 283-291Google Scholar) shows that 99.3% of all residues lie in the allowed region. There are two molecules in an asymmetric unit related by non-crystallographic symmetry. Two non-crystallographic-related molecules are almost identical to each other. The ribbon representation of the MJ0936 monomer is shown in Fig. 4A. The monomer has approximate dimensions of 43 × 40 × 30 Å3. MJ0936 monomer is a single-domain sandwich-like α/β protein. The central core of the protein is a two-layer β-sheet cluster (β8, β9, β7, β6, β5 and β4, β3, β2, β1, β10–11) with three helices (α1–3) flanking on one side and another helix (α4) flanking on the other (Fig. 4, A and B). This protein is highly negatively charged on the surface (Fig. 4C). In all crystal forms, there are two monomers per asymmetric unit and the mode of monomer-monomer contact varies widely from one crystal form to the other. None of the contacts involves a large number of hydrophobic interactions or charge pairing. Furthermore, the interface surface areas resulting from these contacts are rather small (6–8% of total surface area). Thus, we think the biologically important form of the molecule is monomeric.

Biol. 1999; 6: 448-453Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1USH). All of these structural homologs have low similarity with MJ0936 at the sequence level and they were not detected using a BLAST (29Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Google Scholar) search against the sequence data base. Despite the low sequence homology, they all have similar structures and carry out molecular functions that are chemically similar (phosphodiesterase, nuclease, phosphatase, or nucleotidase). Putative Active Site—Based on the structural comparison with known structure homologs of MJ0936, we have determined that the presumed active site is formed by a cluster of turn/loop regions among β1/α1, β2/α2, β3/α3, β6/α4, β7/β8, and β9/β10 (Fig. 4A). All of these regions are highly conserved at the sequence level and form six sequence motifs (Fig. 1). Residues presumably involved in metal binding include Asp-8, His-10, Asp-36, Asn-59, Asn-60, His-97, His-120, Thr-121, and His-122. During the model building and refinement process, a putative ion was found in the active site. The electron density could be seen in the experimental single anomalous dispersionphased map (at 6σ level) and Fo - Fc Fourier difference map (at 9σ level). To identify the ion bound in the active site of the purified protein, the inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry method was used. The only metal found was sodium, and no magnesium, nickel, or manganese was detected. However, a high level of phosphorus element was detected (100 times above detection limit). The molar ratio of the phosphorus element over MJ0936 is ∼18.5:1. Current crystallographic data is not of high enough resolution to give us a clear answer as to the identity of the ion bound at the active site of the native crystal. At present, there are two possibilities for the electron density found in the active site to satisfy the hydrogen bonding potential of two histidines (His-120 and His-122) at the site: (i) an unknown hydrated metal ion X; (ii) phosphate ion (as detected in inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) or sulfate ion (used in the crystallization condition). Because the crystal structure suggested a few possible biochemical functions, all of which require divalent metal ions, we made several crystals of the protein complexed with divalent ions. Magnesium-soaked Crystals and Magnesium Co-crystals— We have obtained crystals soaked in 10 mm magnesium sulfate as well as co-crystals of native protein in the presence of 20 mm magnesium sulfate. Data were collected and structures were determined for these crystals (Tables I and II). The crystal structures of the protein in both the magnesium-soaked crystals and magnesium co-crystals are essentially identical to the native crystal structure produced in the absence of any exogenous magnesium. We believe the addition of magnesium in the crystallization environment did not change the structure of the native protein. Nickel and Manganese Complex Structures—Nickel and manganese complex structures were obtained by co-crystallization of MJ0936 and 5 mm nickel sulfate or manganese sulfate (Table I). For the nickel complex, single anomalous diffraction data were collected and metal sites were identified using anomalous Fourier map. Metal sites in the manganese complex were identified using a difference Fourier map. Nickel and manganese complexes refined well (Table II) and have very similar structures to each other. The most striking differences between the native crystal (as well as magnesium-soaked crystals and magnesium co-crystals) and the nickel or manganese complexes are: (i) cell dimensions and crystal packing are quite different; (ii) only one ion per molecule was observed in the native crystal, whereas a di-metal cluster (nickel or manganese) was found in complex crystals; (iii) despite the overall structural similarity between native and complex crystals, there are significant local structural differences as shown in Fig. 5A. The local structural differences are mainly located in two regions: (i) a turn between β7 and β8 (residue 119 to 124); and (ii) a turn between β6 and α4 (residue 98 to 102). The ion in the native crystal is shown in blue and those in complex structures are shown in red and green. As for the active sites, the most noticeable difference between native and complex crystals is found at residues His-120, His-122, and Thr-121. In the native crystal, these two histidine residues are flipped out away from the active site and an ion is found to bind to them (Fig. 5B). In complex crystals, a dramatic change in the local positioning of these two residues is observed as a result of a “flap-like” conformational change in the turn between β7 and β8 (residues 119 to 124). In the “closed flap” conformation both His-120 and His-122 are closed in toward the active site and interact with a binuclear metal cluster (Fig. 5B). Comparison to Other Structural Homologs—Fig. 6 shows the structural comparison with its closest structural homolog 1II7 as an example to demonstrate the similarities and differences between them. 1II7 is a P. furiosus mre11 nuclease responsible for the DNA double-strand break repair (23Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Craig L. Woo T.T. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 473-485Google Scholar). Although the overall sequence homology between MJ0936 and 1II7 is low (19% identity), the active site residues are well conserved in both proteins as shown in Fig. 6A. The six conserved sequence motifs (Fig. 1) in MJ0936 are also found in 1II7.Fig. 6A, structure-based sequence alignment between MJ0936 and its closest structure homolog mre11 nuclease (Protein Data Bank code 1II7). The six conserved sequence motifs found in MJ0936 (see also Fig. 1) are shown above the sequences. Identical residues between MJ0936 and mre11 nuclease are labeled in blue, similar residues in green. B, overall structure comparison of the manganese complex of MJ0936 and mre11 nuclease. MJ0936 is homologous to domain I of mre11 nuclease. Metal ions (manganese in both structures) are represented as red spheres. A water molecule bridging the manganese ions in MJ0936 is represented as a smaller sphere. A bound 2′-deoxyadenosine 3′-monophosphate molecule found in mer11 nuclease is also shown in the figure. C, active site comparison of MJ0936 (left panel, colored as green) and mer11 nuclease (right panel, color as brown). Metal and water molecules are represented as spheres and labeled as Mn and H2O.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) 1II7 is composed of two domains (23Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Craig L. Woo T.T. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 473-485Google Scholar) (Fig. 6B, right panel). The fold and overall structure of domain I are very similar to those of MJ0936, both of which belong to the phosphodiesterase/nuclease protein family. The active site in domain I of 1II7 is also similar to the active site in MJ0936: the corresponding residues at the active sites in the two structures (MJ0936:1II7) are Asp-8:Asp-8; His-10:His-10; Asp-36:Asp-49; Asn-59:Asn-84; His-97:His-173; His-120:His-206; His-122:His-208 (Fig. 6C). The only differences in MJ0936 and 1II7, respectively, are Gln-60:His-85 and Thr-121:Ile-207. The residues in the latter pair (Thr-121 in MJ0936 and Ile-207 in 1II7) are not directly involved in metal binding in the active form. These conserved active site residues have similar relative positions and orientations. This observation supports the idea that MJ0936 and Mre11 nuclease share a common chemical mechanism. Domain II is believed to play a role in DNA substrate specificity (23Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Craig L. Woo T.T. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 473-485Google Scholar). In nickel or manganese containing crystals, an electron density peak was found bridging two nickel or manganese metal ions in the complexes (Fig. 6, B and C). The relative location and orientation of this electron density to the two metal atoms (nickel or manganese) is very similar to the phosphorus atom of the phosphate in relation to two manganese atoms in the crystal structure of 1II7. However, the electron density is not high enough for a phosphate. At current crystallographic resolution, we model it as a water molecule (Fig. 6C). There are three main groups of phosphodiesterases: enzymes acting on cyclic nucleotides, nucleases, and phospholipases. In our studies, MJ0936 showed no catalytic activity toward cyclic nucleotides or phospholipase substrates. Thus, the molecular function of the protein is most likely a nuclease with a novel phosphodiesterase activity. This is consistent with the surface location of its active site being able to accommodate large substrates. However, we do not know the in vivo substrate. As to the metal ion requirement for the hydrolysis reaction, the metal ions are most likely playing a role of activating the attacking water molecule. However, the structure of lII7 suggests that they may have another role, that of stabilizing the product of the hydrolysis reaction by binding to the phosphate of the product. The balance of these two roles may be responsible for the dramatic difference in metal species dependence shown in Fig. 2A. The native protein is inactive and has what we interpret as a phosphate bound in the active site, whereas manganese- or nickel-bound protein is active and has a bi-metal cluster in the active site. Switching between active and inactive states may be mediated by two histidines, His-120 and His-122, flipping in and out of the active site, respectively, as shown in Fig. 5B, where the phosphate stabilizes the inactive state and the bimetal cluster stabilizes the active state.

The chemokine superfamily consists of small, heparin-binding cytokines that induce directed migration of various types of leukocytes through specific interactions with a group of seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (1Zlotnik A. Yoshie O. Immunity. 2000; 12: 121-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3245) Google Scholar). More than 40 chemokines have been identified and classified into four subfamilies, C, CC, CXC and CX3C, based on the motif formed by the conserved cysteine residues in the amino-terminal region. Chemokines have been considered to play important roles not only in the immune system but also in the development and remodeling of the body (2Strieter R.M. Polverini P.J. Arenberg D.A. Kunkel S.L.

(5Steinbrecher U.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1436: 279-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Currently, scavenger receptors are categorized into almost 10 classes on the basis of their structures, even though there are few structural and primary amino acid sequence similarities among the classes (5Steinbrecher U.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1436: 279-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). While scavenger receptors were primarily studied for their roles in foam cell formation and the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, they have been considered a kind of so-called pattern recognition receptor, since most of them were also shown to bind a broad range of negatively charged molecules including bacteria and dextran sulfate (5Steinbrecher U.P.

In addition to this activity, cells expressing membrane-anchored SR-PSOX/CXCL16 can uptake OxLDL and phagocytose bacteria as well as adhere to CXCR6-expressing cells. These scavenger receptor activities have been implicated in foam cell transformation leading to atherogenesis and in protection from bacterial infection (6Gough P.J. Gordon S.

Most of the antimicrobial chemokines were indicated to contain a positively charged COOH-terminal segment in addition to a chemokine domain (14Cole A.M. Ganz T. Liese A.M. Burdick M.D. Liu L.

However, it has not been clear whether chemokines generally can bind bacteria. In addition, the precise relationships among these binding activities have not been analyzed at a molecular level. Here, we have shown that chemokines generally exhibit scavenger receptor-like activity using a highly overlapping binding domain to their specific receptors.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Cells—Human LDL and OxLDL were prepared and labeled with 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′3′-tetrametyllindocarbocyanin perchlorate (DiI) (Molecular Probes) or 125I as described previously (8Shimaoka T.

SR-PSOX mutants (K42A, R57A, R59A, K60A, R67A, and R73A) had an alanine substitution at lysine 42, arginine 57, lysine 59, arginine 60, arginine 67, and arginine 73 of SR-PSOX, respectively.ELISA for SEAP-fused Chemokines Binding to OxLDL—OxLDL (10 μg/ml:50 μl/well) was loaded onto ELISA plates and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The plates were washed and treated with 4-fold diluted BlockAce (Dainippon Seiyaku, Osaka, Japan) for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, 10 nm of each chemokine fused at its COOH terminus with SEAP (100 μ/well) was loaded, and the plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, polyclonal anti-SEAP antibody (50 μl/well) was loaded, and the plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase (50 μl/well) was loaded, and plates were incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After three washes with PBS, tetramethylbenzidine substrate buffer (100 μl/well) (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) was added to each well. After incubation for 5–30 min at room temperature, stop solution (100 μl/well) was added to each well, and the optical density at 450 nm was determined using a Wallac 1420 ARVO Fluoroscan (Wallac, Turku, Finland).Phylogenic Tree—A phylogenic tree was constructed from the amino acid sequences of chemokines and chemokine domains using the Parallel prrp and phylp programs (17Gotoh O.

We selected 15 chemokines (as described in Table I) and prepared SEAP-tagged forms. We confirmed that the chemokines tagged with SEAP at their COOH terminus were chemotactic for cells expressing their receptors (data not shown). Then, we examined their binding to OxLDL immobilized to plate (Table I). Twelve chemokines (SR-PSOX/CXCL16, CXCL9, CXCL10, SDF/CXCL12, RANTES/CCL5, eotaxin/CCL11, TARC/CCL17, ELC/CCL19, LARC/CCL20, SLC/CCL21, CTACK/CCL27, and CCL28) clearly bound OxLDL (Table I) but not native LDL (data not shown). We refer to these 12 chemokines as group A chemokines. In contrast, the other three chemokines (fractalkine/CX3CL1, IL-8/CXCL8, and MCP-1/CCL2) failed to bind OxLDL. We call these chemokines as group B chemokines.Table IBinding activity of chemokines to various scavenger receptor ligandsChemokineRelative binding activity to scavenger receptor ligandsaThe binding of SEAP-fused chemokines to OxLDL-coated plates was quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The binding to E. coli or S. aureus (3 × 107 cells/well) was measured as described previously (7, 28).

Group A chemokines, except for CXCL9, CXCL12, and CCL5, were shown to bind to both Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, while CXCL9 could bind only to S. aureus and CXCL12, and CCL5 could bind only to E. coli (Table I). On the other hand, group B chemokines bound to neither of these bacteria at all (Table I). In addition, group A chemokines, except for CXCL12, were shown to efficiently adhere to dextran sulfate, while group B chemokines could not bind to dextran sulfate at all (data not shown). Collectively, most of the group A chemokines, which could bind to OxLDL, also efficiently bound to bacteria and dextran sulfate, while group B chemokines, which could not bind to OxLDL, did not bind to bacteria or dextran sulfate.Scavenger Receptor Ligands Block Chemokine Activity—We next examined whether scavenger receptor ligands are capable of inhibiting the binding of various chemokines to their receptors (Table I). We confirmed the specific binding of each SEAP-tagged chemokine to its receptor-expressing cells except for CCL11-SEAP, which showed high levels of nonspecific binding to L1.2 cells (data not shown). Jurkat cells, whose endogenous expression of CXCR4 was confirmed by flow cytometry (data not shown), were used as target cells for CXCL12.OxLDL blocks the specific binding of all examined group A chemokines to their receptors (Table I), while no such inhibitory effect was seen with native LDL (data not shown). On the other hand, OxLDL did not inhibit the specific binding of all group B chemokines to their receptors. Dextran sulfate showed the same inhibitory activity as OxLDL (data not shown).We further examined whether scavenger receptor ligands are capable of inhibiting the chemotactic activity of these chemokines (Table I). OxLDL inhibited the chemotactic activity of all group A chemokines except for CCL5, although the binding of CCL5 to its receptor was inhibited by OxLDL. In contrast, OxLDL did not inhibit the chemotactic activity of group B chemokines except for CXCL8. Although OxLDL inhibited the chemotactic activity of CXCL8 toward CXCR1-expressing Jurkat cells (J-CXCR1 cells), this effect could be nonspecific because 1) OxLDL did not block the binding of CXCL8 to J-CXCR1 cells and 2) OxLDL was reported to be toxic to Jurkat cells (18Alcouffe J. Caspar-Bauguil S. Garcia V. Salvayre R. Thomsen M. Benoist H. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1200-1210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dextran sulfate inhibited the chemotactic activity of all group A chemokines, while it did not inhibit the chemotactic activity of group B chemokines (data not shown). Collectively, both the receptor binding and chemotactic activities of most of the group A chemokines that recognized OxLDL were strongly inhibited by OxLDL and dextran sulfate.Mutational Analysis of SR-PSOX/CXCL16 —We then minutely examined the binding domain of SR-PSOX/CXCL16 to its chemokine receptor CXCR6 and various scavenger receptor ligands on the molecular level. SR-PSOX/CXCL16 is the first chemokine that has been identified as a scavenger receptor molecule (8Shimaoka T. Kume N. Minami M. Hayashida K. Kataoka H. Kita T. Yonehara S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40663-40666Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The extracellular part of SR-PSOX/CXCL16 is composed of two distinct domains, namely the chemokine domain and the mucin domain. We have confirmed that the chemokine domain of SR-PSOX without the mucin and transmembrane domains induces chemotaxis of CXCR6-expressing cells (data not shown). Furthermore, we have previously indicated that only the chemokine domain of SR-PSOX/CXCL16 is required for the recognition of bacteria, and bacterial phagocytosis via SR-PSOX is inhibited by OxLDL (7Shimaoka T. Nakayama T. Kume N. Takahashi S. Yamaguchi J. Minami M. Hayashida K. Kita T. Ohsumi J. Yoshie O. Yonehara S. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition, the chemokine domain of SR-PSOX/CXCL16 is solely responsible for binding OxLDL (data not shown).Both the chemotaxis and adhesion of CX3CR1-expressing cells, by CX3CL1 that is another transmembrane chemokine than SR-PSOX/CXCL16, were reported to be critically impaired by the replacement of basic amino acid residues in the chemokine domain of CX3CL1 with alanine (19Harrison J.K. Fong A.M. Swain P.A. Chen S. Yu Y.R. Salafranca M.N. Greenleaf W.B. Imai T. Patel D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21632-21641Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To examine the recognition sites of SR-PSOX for bacteria, OxLDL, and CXCR6, we prepared a series of mutants of human SR-PSOX/CXCL16 by replacing a single basic amino acid residue in the chemokine domain, which is conserved in human, mouse, and pig SR-PSOX (lysine 42, arginine 57, arginine 59, lysine 60, arginine 67, and arginine 73 in human SR-PSOX), with alanine (designated K42A, R57A, R59A, K60A, R67A, and R73A, respectively). We generated soluble forms of these mutant SR-PSOX proteins as a SEAP fusion protein and examined their chemotactic activity on L-CXCR6 cells (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, we prepared COS-7 cells expressing each mutant of SR-PSOX and examined the phagocytosis of bacteria (Fig. 1B) and binding and uptake of OxLDL (Fig. 1C). We confirmed the cell-surface expression of the mutant SR-PSOX proteins at similar levels on the transfected COS-7 cells by flow cytometry using anti-human SR-PSOX monoclonal antibody 28-12 which recognizes the mucin domain of SR-PSOX/CXCL16 (data not shown). R59A, R67A, and R73A showed strongly reduced activities in all of the assays compared with wild-type SR-PSOX. On the other hand, R42A and R57A showed similar or even increased levels of activity in all of the assays. K60A exhibited activities almost comparable with the wild-type SR-PSOX in the phagocytosis of bacteria but significantly reduced activities in other assays. These results clearly indicate that SR-PSOX/CXCL16 binds not only CXCR6 but also OxLDL and bacteria by using a highly overlapping set of basic amino acid residues.DISCUSSIONHere, we have demonstrated that 12 out of 15 chemokines examined are capable of binding scavenger receptor ligands such as OxLDL and bacteria (Table I). OxLDLs were also shown to be able to competitively inhibit the binding and chemotactic activity of these chemokines toward cells expressing their specific chemokine receptors (Table I). We also analyzed scavenger receptor activity in the 15 chemokines, which were fused at their COOH terminus with the mucin, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains of SR-PSOX/CXCL16, expressed on the surface of COS-7 cells. Most of group A chemokines could, whereas group B chemokines could not, mediate the uptake of bacteria and OxLDL (data not shown). All the results indicate that most of chemokines have potential scavenger receptor activity. In addition, SR-PSOX/CXCL16, which is the first chemokine identified as a scavenger receptor, was suggested to bind not noly its specific receptor CXCR6 but also OxLDL and bacteria by using an almost identical binding site (Fig. 1). All the results suggest that most of the chemokines examined, which bind to their chemokine receptors in a specific one to one manner, can also bind OxLDL and bacteria in a so-called pattern recognizing manner using almost the same chemokine receptor-binding domain.Among the 15 chemokines examined, CX3CL1, CXCL8 and CCL2 could not recognize OxLDL and bacteria. Interestingly, CX3CL1 and CCL2 were reported to be the most important chemokines in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (20Boring L. Gosling J. Cleary M. Charo I.F. Nature. 1998; 394: 894-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (1668) Google Scholar, 21Lesnik P. Haskell C.A. Charo I.F. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The lack of OxLDL binding activity in CX3CL1 and CCL2 may allow these chemokines to exhibit chemotactic activity toward targeted leukocytes in atherosclerotic lesions even in the presence of high local concentrations of OxLDL. Conversely, OxLDL may suppress various immune reactions by binding to various chemokines and blocking the interaction with their receptors.A phylogenic tree of chemokines is shown in Fig. 2. We could not identify specific amino acid residues in the primary amino acid sequence of the group B chemokines nor arrange those chemokines that lack activity to bind bacteria and OxLDL into one categorical group in this tree. Nevertheless, the primordial chemokine might have had both chemotactic and scavenger receptor activities and some chemokines such as group B chemokines might have lost the ability to bind bacteria or OxLDL during evolution. Given that 1) SR-PSOX/CXCL16 binds CXCR6, OxLDL, dextran sulfate, and bacteria by using highly overlapping binding sites, and 2) OxLDL and dextran sulfate block the binding of most of the chemokines examined to their specific receptors, the origin of these two distinct activities, chemokine and scavenger receptor activities, may be evolutionarily linked.Fig. 2Phylogenic tree of chemokines. A phylogenic tree of the chemokine family members was constructed from the amino acid sequences of chemokine domains using the Parallel prrp and phylp programs (17Gotoh O. Adv. Biophys. 1999; 36: 159-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). ZF-CXC, ZF-CC, and XCL indicate Zebrafish CXC chemokine, Zebrafish CC chemokine, and lymphotactin, respectively.

Interestingly, CCL27, which is reported to have less antimicrobial activity than CCL28, exhibits strong binding activity toward bacteria and OxLDL (Table I). Similarly, SR-PSOX/CXCL16 with bacterial binding and phagocytotic activities showed much less antimicrobial activity than previously reported antimicrobial chemokines. 2T. Shimaoka and S. Yonehara, unpublished results. The bacterial binding and phagocytotic activities of SR-PSOX/CXCL16 were indicated to require basic amino acid residues in the middle of its chemokine domain (Fig. 1), while the COOH-terminal cationic domains are likely to be involved in the antimicrobial activity of chemokines (16Yang D.

Immun. 2002; 70: 6515-6517Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Indeed, SR-PSOX/CXCL16 and CCL27 do not have such COOH-terminal cationic domains. Taken together, these findings suggest that the bacterial binding activity and antimicrobial activity are not the same. The COOH-terminal cationic domain of antimicrobial chemokines may not be necessary to bind bacteria and OxLDL but may play an important role in the actual killing of bacteria (16Yang D. Chen Q.

Chertov O. Bykovskaia S.N. Chen Q. Buffo M.J. Shogan J. Anderson M. Schroder J.M. Wang J.M. Howard O.M. Oppenheim J.J. Science. 1999; 286: 525-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar).

Here we report the structure of EF·CaM in complex with its reaction products, cAMP and PPi. Mutational analysis confirmed the interaction of EF with cAMP and PPi as depicted in the structural model. While both cAMP and PPi have access to solvent channels to exit independently, PPi is likely released first. EF can synthesize ATP from cAMP and PPi, and the estimated rate constants of this reaction at two physiologically relevant calcium concentrations were similar to those of adenylyl cyclase activity of EF. Comparison of the conformation of adenosine in the structures of EF·CaM·cAMP·PPi with EF·CaM·3·dATP revealed about 160° rotation in the torsion angle of N-glycosyl bond from the +anti conformation in 3·dATP to -syn in cAMP; such a rotation could serve to distinguish against substrates with the N-2 amino group of purine. The catalytic rate of EF for ITP was about 2 orders of magnitude better than that for GTP, supporting the potential role of this rotation in substrate selectivity of EF. The anomalous difference Fourier map revealed that two ytterbium ions (Yb3+) could bind the catalytic site of EF·CaM in the presence of cAMP and PPi, suggesting the presence of two magnesium ions at the catalytic site of EF. We hypothesize that EF could use a “histidine and two-metal ion” hybrid mechanism to facilitate the cyclization reaction.

Adenylyl cyclase can be categorized into five classes (1Linder J.U. Schultz J.E. Cell. Signal. 2003; 15: 1081-1089Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 2Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G.

Enzymes within a class share sequence similarity but have no homology with members from the other classes. Class II adenylyl cyclase consists of several bacterial toxins that are secreted by pathogenic bacteria and activated upon their entry into host cells (3Yahr T.L. Vallis A.J. Hancock M.K.

Class III is the largest group, which includes adenylyl cyclases from bacteria, yeasts, parasites, insects, and vertebrates. Class III includes enzymes responsive to a plethora of extracellular signals such as hormones, neurotransmitters, odorants, and chemokines. These enzymes control diverse physiological responses such as sugar and lipid metabolism, fight or flight responses, and learning and memory. The other three classes are found in various prokaryotes including Gram-negative bacteria (class I), Aeromonas hydrophila (class IV), and Prevotella ruminicola (class V). The molecular structures of the catalytic domain of EF (class II) and mammalian adenylyl cyclase (class III) reveal no structure similarity between these two members, suggesting the converging evolution of these two classes of enzymes (6Drum C.L.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6706-6713Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The C-terminal 58-kDa domain of EF is a calmodulin (CaM)-dependent adenylyl cyclase, and its activity is modulated by physiological calcium concentrations (5Shen Y. Lee Y.S. Soelaiman S. Bergson P.

The N-terminal 43-kDa portion of the adenylyl cyclase domain of EF forms the catalytic core that shares 34 and 29% sequence similarity to CyaA and ExoY, while the C-terminal 17-kDa helical domain has no catalytic activity but facilitates CaM activation of EF (11Drum C.L.

Structures of the 58-kDa domain of EF alone and in complex with CaM reveal that one of the catalytic loops of EF is disordered in the absence of CaM (6Drum C.L. Yan S.Z. Bard J. Shen Y. Lu D.

The triphosphate moiety is coordinated by several positively charged residues, including Arg-329, Lys-346, Lys-353, and Lys-372. His-351 is near the putative 3′-OH. The homologous residue in CyaA (His-63) is postulated to act as a catalytic base (17Munier H. Bouhss A. Krin E. Danchin A. Gilles A.M. Glaser P. Barzu O. J. Biol.

This is based on the observation that the mutation of His-63 to arginine shifted the pH dependence toward a more alkaline optimum. Thus, His-351 is proposed to serve as a catalytic base to generate 3′-oxy anion.

These analyses suggest a mechanism for the binding and releasing of reaction products in EF. The structure of EF·CaM in complex with cAMP and PPi also offers evidence suggesting a “histidine and two-metal ion” hybrid mechanism of catalysis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The QuikChange kit was purchased from Biocrest; Bradford reagent was from Bio-Rad.

The coordinates for EF3·CaM·cAMP·PPi are available from the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1SK6).Enzymatic Assays for the Forward Reaction of Adenylyl Cyclase—The activities were measured at 30 °C in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2, the indicated ATP concentrations, and a trace amount of [α-32P]ATP for 10 min (28Farndale R.W. Allan L.M. Martin B.R. Milligan G. Signal Transduction, a Practical Approach. Oxford Press, Oxford1992: 75-103Google Scholar). The reaction was buffered by 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, and free calcium concentration was controlled by 10 mm EGTA to 0.1 and 2 μm free Ca2+ based on calculations using the MAXC program. 2See www.stanford.edu/~cpatton/max.html. cAMP was separated from ATP by Dowex and alumina columns as described previously (28Farndale R.W. Allan L.M. Martin B.R. Milligan G. Signal Transduction, a Practical Approach. Oxford Press, Oxford1992: 75-103Google Scholar). Initial velocities were linear with time, and less than 10% of the ATP was consumed at the lowest substrate concentrations.Enzymatic Assays for the Reverse Reaction of Adenylyl Cyclase—Synthesis of ATP from cyclic AMP and PPi by EF3 was measured spectrophotometrically in the presence of glucose, hexokinase, NADP, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (14Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27787-27795Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Reaction velocities were calculated from the linear increase in A340 resulting from the reduction of NADP. Reactions contained 100 mm Na-Hepes (pH 7.2), 50 mm glucose, 0.8 mm NADP, 10 mm free MgCl2, 2.5 units of hexokinase, and 0.5 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in a volume of 500 μl. PPi was always added last to avoid precipitation. Reactions were typically started by the addition of adenylyl cyclase toxin to the reaction mixtures. The reaction was monitored based on the changes in A340 for 15-20 min at 30 °C in a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer with a temperature-controlled cuvette holder. The background for the change in A340 in the absence of adenylyl cyclase was subtracted, and optical densities of greater than 1.5 were excluded from analysis.Non-isotopic Adenylyl Cyclase Assays Using HPLC—Adenylyl cyclase assays of EF were carried out using 10 μm CaM, 10 mm MgCl2, 1.1 μm free CaCl2 as calculated using the MAXC program, and the indicated concentrations of EF and nucleotide triphosphate analog at pH 7.2. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C (unless stated otherwise) and was stopped with 50 mm EDTA. 0.4 mm GTP or cAMP was added as a tracer to monitor the recovery. Phenol extraction was used to separate the nucleotides from the proteins. The aqueous phase was then loaded on a reverse-phase C18 HPLC column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.1 m triethylammonium acetate and acetonitrile.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONStructure of EF3·CaM in Complex with cAMP and PPi—We have determined the structure of EF3 and CaM with and without the non-cyclizable ATP analogs (6Drum C.L.

Tang W.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 317: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To better understand the catalytic mechanism, we solved the structure of EF3·CaM in complex with its reaction products, cAMP and PPi. To do so, EF3·CaM crystals were soaked with cAMP and PPi (1 mm each), and the crystal was diffracted at best to 3.2-Å resolution (Table I). The structure model of EF and CaM in the EF3·CaM·cAMP·PPi structure is similar to those in EF3·CaM. EF3 consists of the catalytic core (CA and CB) and helical domains, and the extended conformation of CaM is inserted between these two domains of EF3 (Fig. 1A). There are three EF·CaM molecules in each asymmetric unit of I222 crystal lattice, and the cAMP and PPi molecules are clearly visible in the active site of all three EF molecules based on the simulated annealing omit map contoured at 3.5 σ (Fig. 1B). We also soaked EF3·CaM crystals with 1 mm cAMP. However, the simulated annealing omit map revealed no visible electronic density of cAMP in the catalytic site of EF, suggesting that PPi is required for the high occupancy of cAMP.Table IStatistics of the EF3·CaM·cAMP·PPi complex dataData collectionBeamlineAPS SBC ID 19aAdvanced Photon Source Structural Biology Center ID19.Space groupI222Unit cell (Å)a116.9b166.4c342.1Resolution (Å)15-3.2Completeness (%)98.4 (96.1)bThe outer resolution shell.RedundancycNobs/Nunique.5.5 (4.3)bThe outer resolution shell.Rsym (%)dRsym = ∑j|I - Ij|/∑I where Ij is the intensity of the jth reflection and I is the average intensity.11.2 (50.2)bThe outer resolution shell.I/σ16.6 (2.3)bThe outer resolution shell.RefinementRcryst (%)eRcryst = ∑hkl|Fobs - Fcalc|/∑hklFobs.0.250Rfree (%)fRfree, calculated the same as for Rcryst but on the 10% data excluded from the refinement calculation.0.307r.m.s.bond (Å)gr.m.s., root mean square.0.009r.m.s.angle (°)1.35a Advanced Photon Source Structural Biology Center ID19.b The outer resolution shell.c Nobs/Nunique.d Rsym = ∑j|I - Ij|/∑I where Ij is the intensity of the jth reflection and I is the average intensity.e Rcryst = ∑hkl|Fobs - Fcalc|/∑hklFobs.f Rfree, calculated the same as for Rcryst but on the 10% data excluded from the refinement calculation.g r.m.s., root mean square. Open table in a new tab The conformation of cAMP in all three EF3·CaM·cAMP·PPi models of the asymmetry unit is roughly similar. The ribose of cAMP is best fit to 2′-C-exo puckering with the torsion angle of N-glycosidic bond approximately -40° so that adenine is in the -syn conformation relative to ribose. The adenosine ring of cAMP forms van der Waals contacts with the main chains of Thr-548, Gly-578, Thr-579, Asp-582, and Asn-583. The N-6 atom of adenine is within hydrogen bonding distance from the main chain carbonyl of Thr-548. The O-4′ atom of ribose forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asn-583; such interaction is postulated to hold ribose in place during the catalysis (6Drum C.L. Yan S.Z. Bard J. Shen Y. Lu D. Soelaiman S. Grabarek Z. Bohm A. Tang W.-J. Nature. 2002; 415: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The 3′-O of cAMP is within hydrogen bonding distance (2.7 Å in model B) from the side chain of His-351, which is proposed to serve as a catalytic base (6Drum C.L. Yan S.Z. Bard J. Shen Y. Lu D. Soelaiman S. Grabarek Z. Bohm A. Tang W.-J. Nature. 2002; 415: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). PPi is about 4.3Å-5.1 Å away from cAMP and is coordinated by salt bridges with several positively charged residues including Lys-372 and Lys-346.Ytterbium ion is one of the additives that promotes the growth of the EF·CaM crystal. We have found that only one ytterbium ion occupies the catalytic site of EF in the structure of EF·CaM in complex with the non-cyclizable ATP analog 3′dATP (6Drum C.L. Yan S.Z. Bard J. Shen Y. Lu D. Soelaiman S. Grabarek Z. Bohm A. Tang W.-J. Nature. 2002; 415: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). This ion is coordinated by Asp-491 and Asp-493. Surprisingly the anomalous difference Fourier map revealed the presence of more than one ytterbium ion (see Supplemental Fig. 1) in the active site of EF·CaM·cAMP·PPi. In particular, the alternation of one Yb3+ ion and two Yb3+ ions in a ratio of 4 to 1 reduces the residual electron density (Fo - Fc) to less than 2.5 σ. This suggests that two metal binding states exist in the structure of EF·CaM·cAMP·PPi: one with a single Yb3+ ion and the other with two Yb3+ ions. In the single Yb3+ binding state, the metal ion is coordinated by Asp-491, Asp-493, and His-577. This coordination pattern is similar to that of the Yb3+ ion in the structures of EF·CaM·3′dATP and EF·CaM·2′d-3′ANT-ATP complexes (5Shen Y. Lee Y.S. Soelaiman S. Bergson P. Lu D. Chen A. Beckingham K. Grabarek Z. Mrksich M. Tang W.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6721-6732Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 6Drum C.L. Yan S.Z. Bard J. Shen Y. Lu D. Soelaiman S. Grabarek Z. Bohm A. Tang W.-J. Nature. 2002; 415: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In the state with two Yb3+ ions, the two ions are about 4 Å apart from each other. The first ion is coordinated by His-577 and Asp-493 and also interacts with 3′-O of cAMP (3.7 Å in model B). The second ion is coordinated by Asp-491 as well as the phosphate of both cAMP and PPi.Mutational Analysis of EF to Validate the Crucial Interactions of EF with Its Products—Mutational analysis was used to evaluate whether the EF3·CaM·cAMP·PPi model accurately depicts the interaction of EF with PPi and cAMP. Lys-372 forms a salt bridge with 3′dATP (6Drum C.L. Yan S.Z. Bard J. Shen Y. Lu D. Soelaiman S. Grabarek Z. Bohm A. Tang W.-J. Nature. 2002; 415: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar) and also appears to make a crucial contact with PPi in the structure of the reaction product. Thus, we made the EF3-K372A mutant in which Lys-372 is mutated to alanine. This mutation reduced the catalytic rate constant of EF3-K372A 30-fold and increased the Km value of ATP 3-fold (EF3, 6.0 ms-1, 0.6 mm; EF3-K372A, 0.2 ms-1, 2.0 mm) with minimal effect on the EC50 value for CaM activation (EF3, 12 nm; EF3-K372A, 6 nm). We then tested the ability of cAMP and PPi to inhibit EF3-K372A. Consistent with the structural model, EF3-K372A had at least a 20-fold increase in the IC50 value for the inhibition by PPi, while its ability to be inhibited by cAMP was not affected (Fig. 2, A and B).Fig. 2The inhibitions of EF3 mutants by cAMP and PPi. The activity was measured in the presence of 0.3 nm EF3, 10 μm CaM, 2 mm ATP, and 0.1 μm free Ca2+ with variable concentrations of cAMP and PPi. The specific activities of wild type EF3 (WT) and EF3 mutants EF3-K353A, EF3-K372A, EF3-N583A, EF3-E588A, and EF3-D590A were 1197, 2, 30, 8, 50, and 188 s-1, respectively. Mean ± S.E. values are representative of at least two experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Lys-353 forms a salt bridge with Glu-588. This salt bridge forms a “lid” over the catalytic site of EF. In addition, Lys-353 is in proximity to form a salt bridge with PPi and the phosphate of cAMP. We have reported previously that the mutation of Lys-353 to alanine resulted in 500-fold reduction in catalytic rate and 7-fold increase in Km value of ATP without affecting the interaction of EF with CaM (6Drum C.L. Yan S.Z. Bard J. Shen Y. Lu D. Soelaiman S. Grabarek Z. Bohm A. Tang W.-J. Nature. 2002; 415: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Our present kinetic analysis revealed that EF3-K353A also exhibits a 20-fold increase in IC50 value for the inhibition by PPi. In contrast, the propensity of this mutant to be inhibited by cAMP was unaltered (Fig. 2, A and B). Lys-346 also forms a salt bridge with PPi. The mutation of Lys-346 to alanine resulted in a reduction of catalytic rate greater than 4 orders of magnitude, making a more accurate kinetic analysis impractical.In the EF3·CaM·cAMP·PPi structure model, the adenosine moiety participates in numerous main chain interactions with EF. Here the most prominent interaction is the hydrogen bonding of its O-4′ atom with Asn-583. Our previous analysis has shown that the mutation of Asn-583 to alanine decreased the catalytic rate constant 150-fold. The same mutation has only a minimal effect on the Km value of ATP or the IC50 value for CaM activation (6Drum C.L. Yan S.Z. Bard J. Shen Y. Lu D. Soelaiman S. Grabarek Z. Bohm A. Tang W.-J. Nature. 2002; 415: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Consistent with our structural model, EF3-N583A increased the IC50 value for the inhibition by cAMP about 10-fold, while the sensitivity of this mutant to the inhibition by PPi was the same as that of the wild type enzyme (Fig. 2, C and D). Our structures show that Glu-588 and Asp-590 contribute to the organization of the catalytic site of EF (6Drum C.L. Yan S.Z. Bard J. Shen Y. Lu D. Soelaiman S. Grabarek Z. Bohm A. Tang W.-J. Nature. 2002; 415: 396-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), but they are not directly involved in the binding of cAMP and PPi. The mutation of these residues to alanine resulted in minimal alteration of the inhibition by cAMP or PPi (Fig. 2, C and D). Thus, our mutational data confirms the structural model of EF3·CaM·cAMP·PPi.Product Inhibition of the EF3·CaM Complex—Patterns of inhibition of enzymatic activity by products can be used to determine whether the release of product is an ordered or random event. To do so, we examined the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity of EF3 by cAMP and PPi (Fig. 3). As reported, calcium not only affects the binding of CaM to EF to facilitate activation but also binds directly to EF to inhibit catalysis (5Shen Y. Lee Y.S. Soelaiman S. Bergson P. Lu D. Chen A. Beckingham K. Grabarek Z. Mrksich M. Tang W.J. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6721-6732Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Thus, we performed our assays in the presence of two free Ca2+ concentrations, 0.1 μm and 2 μm (Fig. 3, A and B). With the large excess of 10 μm CaM, most of EF should be tightly associated with CaM in both calcium concentrations. However, the activity of EF·CaM was minimally affected by calcium ion at 0.1 μm free Ca2+, while its activity was significantly reduced at 2 μm free Ca2+. At 0.1 μm free Ca2+, kinetic data could be interpreted as an ordered product release with PPi being released first. This is because the kinetics of inhibition of EF activity by cAMP was competitive, while that by PPi was mixed. However, such ordered release became random at 2 μm free Ca2+ when the kinetics of inhibition of enzymatic activity by either cAMP or"

This inhibition is thought to be mediated by maintenance of the threshold levels of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p27Kip1 (p27) and inhibition of p70 s6 kinase (p70s6k). However, recent evidence suggests that cells still remain sensitive to rapamycin in the absence of functional p27 or p70s6k. Here, we show that rapamycin represses cyclin D3 levels in activated human T lymphocytes with no inhibitory effects on cyclin D2. Furthermore, rapamycin elicits similar cyclin D3 modulatory effects in B lymphocytes. The overall effect of rapamycin on cyclin D3 leads to impaired formation of active complexes with Cdk4 or Cdk6 and subsequent inhibition of cyclin D3/CDK kinase activity. Decrease in cyclin D3 protein levels is due to translational repression and not due to attenuated transcription of the cyclin D3 gene. Importantly, stable overexpression of cyclin D3 (2–2.5 fold) in Jurkat T cell transfectants renders them resistant to lower doses (1–10 ng/ml) of rapamycin. These results point to a critical role of cyclin D3 in rapamycin-mediated immunosuppressive effects in T cells and cell cycle regulation in lymphocytes in general.

In vivo, the excessive proliferation of antigen-activated T cells and peripheral negative selection after strong T cell receptor engagement are thought to be controlled by TCR antigen-induced cell death (3Lissy N.A.

In organ transplantation, three nonsteroidal drugs, cyclosporin A, FK-506, and rapamycin, have attracted much attention because of their ability to inhibit T cell functions (5Bierer B.E. Hollander G.

The main target of these drugs is thought to be either IL-2 production or its signaling. Cyclosporin A and FK-506 act by inhibiting calcineurin and thereby preventing nuclear translocation of the cytoplasmic component of the transcription factor, nuclear factor of activated T cells (7Shaw K.T.

This ultimately results in inhibition of cytokine production (including IL-2) and, consequently, growth arrest of T lymphocytes in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The molecular mechanisms underlying the immunosuppressive effects of rapamycin are still not well understood. Rapamycin binds to its cytosolic receptor FKBP12 (a receptor shared with FK506) and inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin, which normally activates the serine/threonine p70 s6 kinase (p70s6k) (11Brown E.J.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Google Scholar). Of these, p27Kip1 (p27) has been identified as a target of rapamycin (30Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S. Polyak K. Lee M.H. Massague J. Crabtree G.R. Roberts J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 570-573Google Scholar). p27 is maintained at high levels in quiescent cells but undergoes mitogen-mediated elimination in cycling cells. Rapamycin-induced growth arrest in G1 phase has been linked to its ability to prevent mitogen-mediated elimination of p27, resulting in inhibition of the CDK activity (30Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S. Polyak K. Lee M.H. Massague J. Crabtree G.R. Roberts J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 570-573Google Scholar, 36Luo Y. Marx S.O. Kiyokawa H. Koff A. Massague J. Marks A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6744-6751Google Scholar). However, recent results from p27 knockout mice suggest that defective regulation of p27 is not the only mechanism of rapamycin-mediated growth arrest, since T lymphocytes from these mice remain partially sensitive to the drug (36Luo Y. Marx S.O. Kiyokawa H. Koff A. Massague J. Marks A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6744-6751Google Scholar, 37Nakayama K. Ishida N. Shirane M. Inomata A. Inoue T. Shishido N. Horii I. Loh D.Y.

Cell. 1996; 85: 721-732Google Scholar). In the present study, we have utilized primary human T lymphocytes to investigate rapamycin-mediated growth arrest in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. The effect of rapamycin on phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)/ionomycin-activated T lymphocytes was investigated with a focus on identifying molecular targets other than p27 and their regulation by rapamycin. Our results argue that cyclin D3 is another important target of rapamycin and has a potential of being the key D-type cyclin involved in T cell proliferation. Cell Culture and Reagents—Normal B and T cells were isolated from tonsils. Jurkat T cells were routinely maintained in the laboratory. All cell culture experiments were performed in RPMI 1640 supplemented with l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (50 units/ml)/streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and 10% fetal calf serum (all from Invitrogen). B and T cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml and incubated at 37 °C under 5% CO2. PMA and ionomycin used in T cell activation were obtained from BioMol (Plymouth Meeting, PA) and Calbiochem, respectively. The following reagents were used in B cell activation: rabbit anti-human IgM specific for μ-chains (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) and anti-CD40 derived from hybridoma cells secreting anti-human CD40 Ab G28.5 (American Type Culture Collection). Anti-human CD40 Ab was further purified by passing the hybridoma-conditioned medium through a protein G-Sepharose column (Bio-Rad), and the purified Ab was evaluated for its ability to activate resting human B cells to respond to IL-4. These preliminary experiments suggested that a concentration of 1 μg/ml was capable of stimulating significant [3H]thymidine incorporation in the presence of IL-4 (40Wagner E.F. Hleb M. Hanna N. Sharma S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1123-1131Google Scholar). Recombinant human IL-4 was obtained from Genzyme (Cambridge, MA), and recombinant human IL-2 was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Rapamycin was purchased from BioMol. [γ-32P]ATP and [35S]methionine/cysteine amino acid mix were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, and [3H]thymidine was from ICN (Irvine, CA). Truncated Rb protein used in in vitro phosphorylation assays was obtained from QED Bioscience (San Diego, CA). The protease inhibitors E-64 and LLnL (also called ALLN) were purchased from Sigma, and calpastatin peptide, calpastatin peptide negative control, and clasto-lactacystin β-lactone were obtained from Calbiochem. Isolation of Tonsillar B and T Cells—Tonsils were obtained from a routine tonsillectomy and finely minced. B and T cells were separated from each other by rosetting the cell suspension with neuraminidase-treated sheep red blood cells and subsequent Ficoll-Hypaque (Amersham Biosciences) gradient centrifugation as discussed (40Wagner E.F. Hleb M. Hanna N. Sharma S. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 1123-1131Google Scholar). T cells were released from the T cell/sheep red blood cell pellet by lysing sheep red blood cells, and B cell subpopulations were separated using Percoll gradients. Non-B cells and non-T cells were removed from the respective populations through adherence to plastic for 2 h to overnight at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. B and T cell preparations were subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. The purity of lymphocyte subpopulations was routinely found to be >95% by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis of T cell-specific cell surface molecule CD3. Proliferation Assays—Purified T cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml and activated by incubating them in medium supplemented with 0.1 μm ionomycin plus 10 ng/ml PMA. Activated T cells (1.5 × 105) were seeded in 96-well, flat bottom microtiter plates (Falcon Labware, Oxford, CA) in a final volume of 200 μl in the presence or absence of 50 ng/ml rapamycin. Cells were pulsed for 2 h with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine (1 Ci/mmol) at different time points and harvested, and the radioactivity incorporated into DNA was measured. The bromodeoxyuridine incorporation to measure DNA synthesis was carried out using a Cell Proliferation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science). All assays were repeated at least three times with different tonsillar preparations, and all measurements were in triplicate. Immunoblot Analysis—Purified T cells were stimulated using PMA plus ionomycin as described above for various time periods. Cells were suspended in immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer, which contained 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 0.1 mm sodium orthovanadate (41Nagasawa M. Melamed I. Kupfer A. Gelfand E.W. Lucas J.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5146-5154Google Scholar). They were then disrupted by sonication for 20 s at 4 °C with maximum microtip strength (41Nagasawa M. Melamed I. Kupfer A. Gelfand E.W. Lucas J.J. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 5146-5154Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay and further normalized by the Coomassie Blue staining of protein extracts separated on 12% SDS-PAGE. For immunoblot analysis, the extracts (50 μg/lane) were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to Hybond-ECL nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and blocked in PBS-T (PBS, 0.2% Tween) containing 5% nonfat dry milk for 2 h at room temperature. Filters were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with either anti-p70s6k (clone C-18; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-Cdk4 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY), anti-Cdk6 (clone C-21; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-cyclin D2 (clone C-17; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-cyclin D3 (clone C-16; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-p27 (clone 57; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) at concentrations as recommended by the manufacturers. After the overnight incubation at 4 °C with primary antibodies, the membranes were washed and incubated for 1 h at room temperature using appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The proteins were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—Cell extracts were prepared as described above. Cell extracts (200 μg) in a volume of 500 μl of IP buffer were first precleared with 25 μl of a 50/50 slurry of protein G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4 °C. The protein G-Sepharose beads were removed by centrifugation, and the complexes of interest were immunoprecipitated by incubating for 1 h at4 °C with either anti-Cdk4, anti-Cdk6, or anti-cyclin D3 at concentrations as suggested by the manufacturer. After 1 h of incubation, 25 μl of a 50/50 slurry of protein G-Sepharose were added, and the extracts were incubated at 4 °C overnight. The immunoprecipitates were subsequently washed six times with 500 μl of IP buffer, boiled for 10 min in 50 μl of 2× SDS buffer, and run on 12% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were detected as described above. In Vitro Phosphorylation Assays—Cyclin D3 complexes were immunoprecipitated as described above. The complexes were subsequently washed three times with 500 μl of IP buffer and three times with 500 ml of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm magnesium chloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, and 1 mm sodium fluoride) and suspended in a total reaction volume of 50 μl. Phosphorylation of Rb protein was determined by incubating the beads for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence of 1 μm cold ATP (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 0.5 μg of truncated Rb protein. The reaction was terminated by boiling the samples in 2× SDS buffer for 10 min. The phosphorylated substrates were then identified by resolution on 12% SDS-PAGE followed by drying and autoradiography. [35S]Methionine Pulse Analysis—Primary T lymphocytes were isolated and activated in the presence or absence of rapamycin. After 24 h of activation, the cells were washed four times in l-methionine-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with l-glutamine (2 mm) and penicillin (50 units/ml)/streptomycin (50 μg/ml). The cells were then seeded at a density of 2 × 106 cells/ml in l-methionine-free RPMI 1640 supplemented with l-glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (50 units/ml)/streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum and pulsed with 0.1 mCi of [35S]methionine/cysteine amino acid mix for 2 h. After the pulse, 35S was washed off, and the protein extraction and immunoprecipitations with cyclin D3 Ab were performed as described above. The immunoprecipitates were separated on 12% SDS-PAGE, which was subsequently dried and exposed to photographic film for detection of 35S-labeled proteins. Northern Analysis—T lymphocytes (1 × 106 cells/ml) were activated and cultured for indicated periods of time in the presence or absence of rapamycin. RNA was isolated by TRI Reagent according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Total RNA (10 μg) was separated in urea running buffer on a 1% agarose-urea-based gel as previously described (42Materna T. Weber S. Kofler-Mongold V. Phares W. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 255: 161-163Google Scholar). RNA was transferred to a nylon membrane by capillary transfer, and cyclin D3 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase messages were detected by α-32P-labeled RNA and random primer labeled DNA probes, respectively. Cyclin D3 template and the MAXIscript T7 kit used to synthesize the cyclin D3 RNA probe were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). Cell Cycle Analysis—Immediately after isolation, T lymphocytes (2 × 106) were stained with propidium iodide (PI) by incubating cells in 1 ml of PI stain (1× PI, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.1% sodium citrate) for 30 min at 4 °C in the dark. The stained cells were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting within 1 h (43Arvanitakis L. Yaseen N. Sharma S. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 1047-1056Google Scholar). Other cell aliquots (2 × 106) were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/ml, activated with PMA plus ionomycin, and cultured in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml rapamycin for the indicated times. Cells were subsequently stained with PI and analyzed using the same method. Ectopic Expression of Cyclin D3 in Jurkat T Cells and Isolation of Stable Transfectants—Rapamycin has been shown to reduce the initiation rate of translation of a family of mRNAs containing a tract of polypyrimidine sequence immediately after their methylguanosine cap sequences (18Jefferies H.B. Reinhard C. Kozma S.C. Thomas G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4441-4445Google Scholar). A careful look at the 5′-untranslated region of the cyclin D3 gene suggests the presence of putative CAP and tract of polypyrimidine sequences (44Brooks A.R. Shiffman D. Chan C.S. Brooks E.E. Milner P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9090-9099Google Scholar). Thus, we next set out to investigate whether overexpression of cyclin D3 from a construct devoid of 5′ sequences responsible for rapamycin-mediated translation inhibition will impart resistance to growth-inhibitory effects. A human cyclin D3-overexpressing construct was generated by subcloning the human cyclin D3 gene sequence -17 to +896 (translation start site = +1) into pcDNA 3.1 (+) vector (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was carried out on Jurkat T cell total RNA followed by PCR using an NheI site (GCTAGC) sequence-containing forward primer (5′-TAA TGC TAG CTG TTC GCT GCC-3′) and an XbaI site (AGATCT) sequence-containing reverse primer (5′-AAA TTC TAG AGG GCC TCT CCA-3′). The PCR product was digested with NheI and XbaI before subcloning into pcDNA 3.1 (+). Positive clones were identified by restriction enzyme digestion and confirmed by sequence analysis. Control plasmid (pcDNA 3.1) and cyclin D3-containing plasmid construct (in both sense and antisense orientations) were electroporated into actively growing Jurkat T cells, and cultures continued for stable growth of neomycin-resistant cells. Initially, cells were treated with 1.7 mg/ml G418 for a period of 3 weeks. At this time, single clones were isolated by a limiting dilution approach of one cell/well using 700 μg/ml of G418. Single clones were further expanded for their use in rapamycin sensitivity assays, Western blotting, and cell cycle analysis. Several clones were isolated and characterized. Rapamycin Arrests PMA/Ionomycin-activated T Lymphocytes in the G1 Phase of the Cell Cycle—Previous studies have used IL-2-dependent T cell clones to assess the growth inhibition, p70s6k inactivation, G1 phase growth arrest, and p27 activation by rapamycin (13Kuo C.J. Chung J. Fiorentino D.F. Flanagan W.M. Blenis J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 358: 70-73Google Scholar, 30Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S. Polyak K. Lee M.H. Massague J. Crabtree G.R.

Bierer B.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7571-7575Google Scholar). Here, we have used primary human T lymphocytes activated with PMA and ionomycin. These pharmacological agents can replace TCR and co-stimulatory signals in inducing T cell activation, cytokine production, and cell cycle entry (46Takahama Y. Nakauchi H. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 1508-1513Google Scholar). Freshly isolated T lymphocytes were activated with 0.1 μm ionomycin plus 10 ng/ml PMA in the presence or absence of rapamycin and harvested at different time points postactivation. DNA synthesis was measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation. Active S-phase entry occurred between 24 and 36 h, and proliferation peaked around 60 h, which is indicative of at least two or three rounds of DNA synthesis (Fig. 1A). Rapamycin inhibited the growth as early as 12 h postactivation and exhibited significant inhibitory effects throughout the entire culture period. It has been previously demonstrated that activation and phosphorylation of p70s6k is inhibited by rapamycin during IL-2-dependent T cell growth (13Kuo C.J. Chung J. Fiorentino D.F. Flanagan W.M. Blenis J. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1992; 358: 70-73Google Scholar, 15Price D.J. Grove J.R. Calvo V. Avruch J. Bierer B.E. Science. 1992; 257: 973-977Google Scholar, 47Chou M.M. Blenis J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 806-814Google Scholar, 48Terada N. Lucas J.J. Szepesi A. Franklin R.A. Takase K. Gelfand E.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 1315-1321Google Scholar). It was therefore important to investigate whether rapamycin also prevented phosphorylation of p70s6k under PMA/ionomycin activation conditions. In the absence of stimulation (0 h), p70s6k was present in a dephosphorylated form, and after 12 h postactivation, p70s6k was phosphorylated, as indicated by a slower migrating band. Rapamycin treatment resulted in a faster migrating dephosphorylated protein band, which also appeared in untreated cells at the end of active growth at 72 h and beyond (Fig. 1B). Our results demonstrate that rapamycin is able to inhibit phosphorylation of p70s6k in PMA/ionomycin-activated T lymphocytes and induces these effects prior to active production of IL-2 (data not shown). To determine the stage of rapamycin-induced cell cycle arrest under these activation conditions, we evaluated cell cycle progression of freshly isolated tonsillar T cells and cells activated in the absence or presence of the drug at various time points postactivation by using fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. A representative experiment is shown in Table I. Resting T cells accumulated in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Upon activation, cells displayed a profile of actively growing cells with ∼25% present in S phase. The percentage of cells in S phase drastically decreased with rapamycin treatment (4%). This G1 growth arrest is in agreement with the known effects of rapamycin (31Sehgal S.N. Clin. Biochem. 1998; 31: 335-340Google Scholar, 49Bierer B.E. Proc. Assoc. Am. Physicians. 1995; 107: 28-40Google Scholar).Table ISummary of cell cycle analysis of primary human T lymphocytes 24 h postactivation Results are representative of four different tonsillar preparations.Resting T cellsActivated T cellsActivated T cells plus rapamycin%%%G0/G1976095S3244G2/M0161 Open table in a new tab Rapamycin Decreases Protein Levels of Cyclin D3 but Protects Cyclin D2 and p27—p27 is a known target of rapamycin, and the ability of rapamycin to prevent mitogen-induced elimination of p27 has been linked to its immunosuppressive properties (30Nourse J. Firpo E. Flanagan W.M. Coats S. Polyak K. Lee M.H. Massague J. Crabtree G.R. Roberts J.M. Nature. 1994; 372: 570-573Google Scholar, 50Kawamata S. Sakaida H. Hori T. Maeda M. Uchiyama T. Blood. 1998; 91: 561-569Google Scholar). It was therefore of interest to investigate the status of p27 protein levels in PMA/ionomycin-activated T cells. Fig. 2A presents a representative analysis of p27 protein levels. The levels of p27 were high in freshly isolated T cells (G0) but underwent rapid elimination upon the addition of PMA and ionomycin. Rapamycin treatment maintained elevated levels of p27. Next, we investigated the effects of rapamycin on other G1 phase proteins, specifically Cdk4, Cdk6, cyclin D1, cyclin D2, and cyclin D3. As evident from Fig. 2B and consistent with previously published observations in IL-2-dependent T cell clones, rapamycin did not significantly affect protein levels of either Cdk4 or Cdk6. On the other hand, the drug exhibited inhibitory effects on cyclin D3 (Fig. 2C). Cyclin D1 was not detected in activated human T lymphocytes, which is in agreement with the previously published observations (51Ajchenbaum F. Ando K. DeCaprio J.A. Griffin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 4113-4119Google Scholar). Rapamycin prevented activation-dependent up-regulation of cyclin D3. This decrease in cyclin D3 protein levels could be observed as early as 12 h postactivation, and it persisted throughout the 72-h experiment period. Surprisingly, the effect of rapamycin on cyclin D2 levels was opposite to that on cyclin D3 (Fig. 2C). Rapamycin did not affect the induction of cyclin D2. Rather, it prevented the gradual decrease of this G1 cyclin at later time points, which occurred as a part of normal cell cycle progression, suggesting that the effect of cyclin D3 is specific and not a consequence of aberrant activation. Down-regulation of Cyclin D3 by Rapamycin Is Not Limited to PMA/Ionomycin-mediated Activation of T Lymphocytes—To investigate whether rapamycin-mediated repression of cyclin D3 is a major event in lymphocytes and not limited to PMA/ionomycin-mediated activation, we extended these studies to B cells. Tonsillar B cells were activated with anti-IgM plus anti-CD40 antibodies and cultured in the presence of IL-4 for 20 h as discussed under “Experimental Procedures.” Fig. 3 shows that cyclin D3 was induced upon such treatment and that its induct"
https://openalex.org/W2055079484,"The interactions of microfibril-associated glycoprotein (MAGP)-2 have been investigated with fibrillins and fibrillin-containing microfibrils. Solid phase binding assays were conducted with recombinant fragments covering fibrillin-1 and most of fibrillin-2. MAGP-2, and its structure relative MAGP-1, were found to bind two fragments spanning the N-terminal half of fibrillin-1 and an N-terminal fragment of fibrillin-2. Blocking experiments indicated that MAGP-2 had a binding site(s) close to the N terminus of the fibrillin-1 molecule that was distinct from that for MAGP-1 and an additional, more central binding site(s) that may be shared by the two MAGPs. Immunogold labeling of developing nuchal ligament tissue showed that MAGP-2 had regular covalent and periodic (about 56 nm) association with fibrillin-containing microfibrils of elastic fibers in this tissue. Further analysis of isolated microfibrils indicated that MAGP-2 was attached at two points along the microfibril substructure, “site 1” on the “beads” and “site 2” at the “shoulder” of the interbead region close to where the two “arms” fuse. In contrast, MAGP-1 was located only on the beads. Comparison of the MAGP-2 binding data with known fibrillin epitope maps of the microfibrils showed that site 1 correlated with the N-terminal MAGP-2 binding region, and site 2 correlated with the second, more central, MAGP-2 binding region on the fibrillin-1 molecule. Of particular note, immunolabeling at site 2 was markedly decreased, relative to that at site 1, on extended microfibrils with bead-to-bead periods over 90 nm, suggesting that site 2 may move toward the beads when the microfibril is stretched. The study points to MAGP-2 being an integral component of some populations of fibrillin-containing microfibrils. Moreover, the identification of multiple MAGP-binding sequences on fibrillins supports the concept that MAGPs may function as molecular cross-linkers, stabilizing fibrillin monomers in folded conformation within or between the microfibrils, and thus MAGPs may be implicated in the modulation of the elasticity of these structures.

Fibrillin-1 and -2 have distinct but overlapping spatiotemporal tissue distributions with fibrillin-2 expression largely confined to fetal tissues and fibrillin-1 expression persisting in mature tissues (13Zhang H.

The fibrillin molecules appear to be arranged within the microfibrils as parallel bundles of 4–8 molecules joined in series in a head-to-tail manner. However, the precise organization of the fibrillin monomers remains to be elucidated, and several models for the molecular architecture of the microfibrils have been proposed (15Sakai L.Y. Keene D.R.

Recent evidence suggests that fibrillins 1 and 2 can form separate microfibrils but that the proteins can also occur within the same microfibril (14Charbonneau N.L. Dzamba B.J. Ono R.N. Keene D.R.

Mutations in the genes for fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 have been linked to the genetic disorders Marfan syndrome and congenital contractural arachnodactyly, respectively (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man numbers 154700 and 121050). Depletion of normal fibrillin-containing microfibrils in Marfan patients can cause progressive weakness in the aortic wall leading to aneurysms and premature death from rupture of the vessel. The condition is also characterized by skeletal, ocular, and lung defects. A recent study has shown that the microfibrils can act as tissue stores for latent TGF-β 1The abbreviations used are: TGF, transforming growth factor; MAGP, microfibril-associated glycoprotein; BSA, bovine serum albumin; GdnHCl, guanidine hydrochloride; TBS, Tris-buffered saline. complexed with latent TGF-β-binding proteins (19Isogai Z.

It is possible that some manifestations of Marfan syndrome such as lung abnormalities and long bone overgrowth may be linked to inappropriate TGF-β activation due to depletion of the microfibrils in these tissues (20Neptune E.R.

The evidence indicates that most of these molecules can be associated with the microfibrils in an intermittent manner, suggesting that they are not integral components of these structures. However, there is strong biochemical and immunoelectron microscopic evidence that MAGP-1 is covalently and periodically located in the “beads” of the beaded filament substructure of fibrillin-1-containing microfibrils in most if not all tissues, pointing to an integral structural role for the glycoprotein (35Gibson M.A. Kumaratilake J.S.

MAGP-1 has been shown to self-aggregate and bind in vitro to the N-terminal region of fibrillin-1 and to the elastin precursor, tropoelastin (38Brown-Augsburger P. Broekelmann T. Mecham L. Mercer R.

Thus it has been proposed that MAGP-1 may stabilize the head-to-tail interaction of fibrillin monomers within the beads (37Henderson M. Polewski R. Fanning J.C. Gibson M.A. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1996; 44: 1389-1397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and/or act as an elastin-binding protein on the surface of the microfibril (41Gibson M.A. Sandberg L.B. Grosso L.E. Cleary E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7596-7601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MAGP-1 also interacts with collagen VI, and thus it may function as a linker molecule between the fibrillin-containing microfibrils and adjacent collagen VI microfibrils (39Finnis M.L. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22817-22823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). MAGP-2 is the second member of the MAGP family and shares a characteristic central cysteine-rich motif with MAGP-1 that is considered to be important for binding to the fibrillin-containing microfibrils (1Gibson M.A. Hatzinikolas G.

MAGP-2 exhibits more restricted tissue and developmental patterns of distribution suggesting that it has a more specialized role in microfibril biology than MAGP-1 (36Gibson M.A. Finnis M.L. Kumaratilake J.S. Cleary E.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 871-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). MAGP-2 has been reported to bind the C-terminal regions of fibrillins 1 and 2 via the central cysteine-rich motif (43Penner A.S. Rock M.J. Kielty C.M. Shipley J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35044-35049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). MAGP-2 lacks the tropoelastin and collagen VI-binding sequences of MAGP-1, but in its place it contains an active RGD motif that interacts with several cell types via αvβ3 integrin (44Gibson M.A. Leavesley D.I. Ashman L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13060-13065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that MAGP-2 may function in microfibril and elastic fiber assembly and in the interaction of microfibrils with cell surfaces at specific stages of tissue development (43Penner A.S. Rock M.J. Kielty C.M. Shipley J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35044-35049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 44Gibson M.A. Leavesley D.I. Ashman L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13060-13065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Previously, it has been unclear if MAGP-2 occurs as a regular component of, or is associated intermittently with, the populations of microfibrils in the tissues where it is found. In the present study we show that MAGP-2 is covalently and periodically located along the fibrillin-containing microfibrils of the developing nuchal ligament, strongly suggesting that the protein is an integral component of most, if not all, of the microfibrils in this elastic fiber-rich tissue. In addition, we have identified MAGP-2 binding regions in the N-terminal part of the fibrillin-1 and -2 molecules. The evidence indicates that MAGP-2 is associated with the microfibrils at two points on its substructure, on the “bead” and at the “shoulder” of the interbead region. The findings suggest that MAGP-2 may be involved in the stabilization of folded fibrillin monomers within the microfibril by forming interdomain and/or inter-monomer connections. Purification of MAGPs and Recombinant Fibrillin Fragments— MAGP-1 and MAGP-2 were purified from nuchal ligament tissue as described previously (39Finnis M.L. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22817-22823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Full-length human cDNAs for fibrillin-1, corresponding to bases 122–8923 of the cDNA sequence (GenBank™ accession number NM_000138 (45Pereira L. D“Alessio M. Ramirez F. Lynch J.R. Sykes B. Pangilinan T. Bonadio J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 961-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar)), and fibrillin-2, corresponding to bases 135–8304 (GenBank™ accession number NM_001999.2), were obtained by reverse transcription of human placental RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) followed by PCR with Pfu turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using methods described previously (46Hanssen E. Reinboth B. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24334-24341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). For fibrillin-1 cDNA, the sense primer was 5′-CGGCTCGGCATCATGCGTCGAGGGC-3′, and the antisense primer was 5′-TGTACCTATGATATGATGATTCTGATT-3′. For fibrillin-2 cDNA, the sense primer was 5′-ACAGGTTCGGTCCGCTACA-3′, and the antisense primer was 5′-GAGTGCAAAATCAACGGC-3′. The cDNAs were “A”-tailed and cloned into pGEM T-easy (Promega, Madison, WI) as described previously (46Hanssen E. Reinboth B. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24334-24341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). An 18-nucleotide sequence encoding a His6 tag was introduced into the fibrillin-1 cDNA sequence using site-directed mutagenesis with the Quikchange kit (Stratagene) replacing bases 278–295 in fibrillin-1. The sequence encoding the fibrillin-1 signal (bases 122–280) was added to the 5′ end of the recombinant fibrillin-2 cDNA using the splicing by overlap extension technique (47Horton R.M. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Hunt H.D. Cai Z. Pease L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Further PCR was conducted to generate four partial fibrillin-1 cDNAs, Fib-1 (H)NT, Fib-1 N(H), Fib-1 C(H), and Fib-1 (H)CT, which together encoded the entire fibrillin-1 molecule, encompassing bases 122–2093, 1847–4468, 4466–6748, and 6749–8762, respectively. In addition, two partial fibrillin-2 cDNAs, Fib-2 NT(H) (bases 136–3468) and Fib-2 C(H) (bases 3469–7008), encoding the N-terminal and central regions of fibrillin-2, respectively, were also generated. Extended primers were used to encode C-terminal His6 tags in fragments Fib-1 N(H), Fib-1 C(H), Fib-2 NT(H), and Fib-2 C(H). The splicing by overlap extension technique was then used to attach a sequence encoding the fibrillin-1 signal sequence to fragments Fib-1 N(H), Fib-1 C(H), and Fib-2 C(H) and a sequence encoding the signal and N-terminal His6 tag to fragment Fib-1 (H)CT. Fragments Fib-1 (H)NT and Fib-2 NT(H) already contained the sequence encoding the signal peptide, and in addition, Fib-1 (H)NT encoded an N-terminal His6 tag, following their amplification from the recombinant full-length templates. Each fragment was cloned into pGEM T-easy, as above, and then subcloned into the NotI restriction site of the mammalian expression vector pCEP4 (Invitrogen). Individual clones were fully sequenced to check for errors. The selected constructs were stably transfected into 293-EBNA cells, and recombinant protein fragments were purified from the culture medium using nickel-affinity chromatography with methods described previously (46Hanssen E. Reinboth B. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24334-24341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Antibodies—Polyclonal antibodies to MAGP-1 (R18), MAGP-2 peptide SETFTEDPNLVNDPATDET (R49p), and monoclonal anti-MAGP-1 antibody (11B) have been described previously (36Gibson M.A. Finnis M.L.

Monoclonal anti-fibrillin-2 antibody, 16E12, was made following standard protocols by using as antigen a synthetic peptide with the sequence GGNGFAPSGNGNGYGPG specific for the glycine-rich region of fibrillin-2, coupled to diphtheria toxoid. The specificity of 16E12 was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blotting against the recombinant fragments of fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 (data not shown). Anti-fibrillin-1 monoclonal antibodies 26 and 11C1.3 were purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). Anti-His5 monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Solid Phase Binding Assays—Solid phase binding assays were conducted as described previously (39Finnis M.L. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22817-22823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, a test protein (MAGP or recombinant fibrillin fragment) was coated onto the wells of a microtiter plate (Nunc Maxisorb) in TBS and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Control wells were incubated with BSA. After rinsing and blocking with 3% skimmed milk, the wells were incubated with a second test protein in liquid phase for 3 h at 37 °C in TBS containing 5 mm CaCl2. After further rinsing, binding was detected with specific primary antibody followed by the appropriate peroxidase conjugate and 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Sigma). Anti-His5 monoclonal antibody was used to detect binding of His6-tagged recombinant fibrillin fragments in the liquid phase, except that antibodies 26 and 16E12 were used to detect binding of fragments Fib-1 (H)NT and Fib-2 NT(H), respectively. Polyclonal anti-MAGP-1 antibody R18 was used to detect MAGP-1 binding. Affinity Blotting—Ligand blotting was conducted using a method described previously (39Finnis M.L. Gibson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22817-22823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant fibrillin-1 fragments (1 μg/lane) were subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 6.5% gel under nonreducing conditions and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was rinsed in TBS containing 5 mm CaCl2 for 1 h and blocked with 10% skimmed milk in the same buffer for 1 h. Duplicate blots were then incubated with or without added MAGP-2 (5 μg/ml) for 2 h at room temperature in TBS containing 0.05% skimmed milk and 5 mm CaCl2. After rinsing, specific binding was detected using anti-MAGP-2 antibody (1:100 dilution in TBS plus 2% skimmed milk) followed by goat anti-rabbit alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Bio-Rad) as the secondary antibody and nitro blue tetrazolium and bromochloroindolyl phosphate as substrates. Isolation of Microfibrils—Fibrillin-containing microfibrils were purified using a method based on that of Kielty et al. (49Kielty C.M. Hanssen E. Shuttleworth C.A. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 255: 108-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, nuchal ligament tissue (6 g) from a 230-day-old fetal calf was finely diced with a razor blade, rinsed several times in TBS, and resuspended in 18 ml of collagenase digestion buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.4 m NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The suspension was incubated with 1.8 mg of highly purified type VII collagenase (specific activity, 1980 units/mg) (Sigma) for 8 h at 37 °C and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was chromatographed in three batches on a column of Sepharose CL-2B (1.6 × 60 cm) equilibrated in Tris/NaCl buffer (composition as above but lacking CaCl2). Flow rate was 30 ml/h, and 3-ml fractions were collected. Fractions containing fibrillin-containing microfibrils were identified by direct dot blotting on Zetaprobe-plus nylon membrane (Bio-Rad) with antibody 26. The fibrillin-containing fractions (void volume peaks) from the three runs were combined and treated with 5 units of hyaluronidase (Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan) for 24 h at 4 °C. Samples of this digest were then analyzed by CsCl density gradient centrifugation in Tris/NaCl buffer (native conditions) or in Tris/NaCl buffer containing 6 m GdnHCl (denaturing conditions). Each sample was adjusted to an initial density of 1.35 g/ml with CsCl and then ultracentrifuged in a 70.1 Ti head (Beckman) at 30,000 rpm (62,000 × g) at 15 °C for 72 h. Each gradient was divided into 24 fractions, and those containing fibrillin-1 were identified by dot blotting and combined. Dot blotting for MAGP-2 was also conducted. Immunoelectron Microscopy—For post-embedding immunolabeling, the nuchal ligament was dissected from a 230-day-old fetal calf and diced into 1-mm3 blocks. In some instances, tissue pieces were treated with 6 m GdnHCl buffered with 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, for 6 h, rinsed with TBS, and incubated with chondroitinase ABC for 18 h at 4 °C. The blocks were washed in TBS for 20 min, fixed in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.2, containing 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde for 2 h, extensively rinsed with 0.175 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.2, and serially dehydrated and embedded in LRWhite resin. Sections ∼75 nm thick were cut, recovered on 200 mesh collodion-coated nickel grids, and incubated with 0.01 m glycine for 30 min to block free aldehyde groups. After further blocking with TBS, 2% ovalbumin for 30 min, the sections were incubated at 4 °C for 18 h with antibody (20 μg/ml) in TBS/ovalbumin. The sections were then rinsed five times in TBS/ovalbumin and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated with 10-nm gold particles diluted according to the manufacturer's instructions (Aurion, Wageningen, The Netherlands). The sections were extensively washed with TBS/ovalbumin followed by deionized water and then stained with alcoholic uranyl acetate and lead citrate for examination at 80 kV in a Philips CM100 transmission electron microscope. For pre-embedding immunolabeling, the freshly diced nuchal ligament was washed four times in TBS over 2 h and then incubated with primary antibody (100 μg/ml) in TBS/ovalbumin for 4 h. The pieces were extensively washed with TBS/ovalbumin and incubated for 18 h with either gold-conjugated secondary antibody or goat anti-rabbit IgG antiserum in TBS/ovalbumin. Following extensive rinsing with TBS followed by 0.175 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, the tissue was fixed for 2 h in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.5% paraformaldehyde and 1% glutaraldehyde, rinsed, and post-fixed in 1% OsO4 for 1 h. The tissue was then dehydrated and embedded in epoxy resin, and sections were cut, stained, and examined as described for post-embedding labeling. For immunolabeling and negative staining, microfibrils isolated on density gradients under nondenaturing conditions were sprayed onto a 400-mesh Formvar-coated nickel grid, rinsed with water, and incubated for 20 min with affinity-purified antibo"
https://openalex.org/W2129630264,"The NAD(P)H cytochrome b5 oxidoreductase, Ncb5or (previously named b5+b5R), is widely expressed in human tissues and broadly distributed among the animal kingdom. NCB5OR is the first example of an animal flavohemoprotein containing cytochrome b5 and chrome b5 reductase cytodomains. We initially reported human NCB5OR to be a 487-residue soluble protein that reduces cytochrome c, methemoglobin, ferricyanide, and molecular oxygen in vitro. Bioinformatic analysis of genomic sequences suggested the presence of an upstream start codon. We confirm that endogenous NCB5OR indeed has additional NH2-terminal residues. By performing fractionation of subcellular organelles and confocal microscopy, we show that NCB5OR colocalizes with calreticulin, a marker for endoplasmic reticulum. Recombinant NCB5OR is soluble and has stoichiometric amounts of heme and flavin adenine dinucleotide. Resonance Raman spectroscopy of NCB5OR presents typical signatures of a six-coordinate low-spin heme similar to those found in other cytochrome b5 proteins. Kinetic measurements showed that full-length and truncated NCB5OR reduce cytochrome c actively in vitro. However, both full-length and truncated NCB5OR produce superoxide from oxygen with slow turnover rates: kcat = ∼0.05 and ∼1 s–1, respectively. The redox potential at the heme center of NCB5OR is –108 mV, as determined by potentiometric titrations. Taken together, these data suggest that endogenous NCB5OR is a soluble NAD(P)H reductase preferentially reducing substrate(s) rather than transferring electrons to molecular oxygen and therefore not an NAD(P)H oxidase for superoxide production. The subcellular localization and redox properties of NCB5OR provide important insights into the biology of NCB5OR and the phenotype of the Ncb5or-null mouse. The NAD(P)H cytochrome b5 oxidoreductase, Ncb5or (previously named b5+b5R), is widely expressed in human tissues and broadly distributed among the animal kingdom. NCB5OR is the first example of an animal flavohemoprotein containing cytochrome b5 and chrome b5 reductase cytodomains. We initially reported human NCB5OR to be a 487-residue soluble protein that reduces cytochrome c, methemoglobin, ferricyanide, and molecular oxygen in vitro. Bioinformatic analysis of genomic sequences suggested the presence of an upstream start codon. We confirm that endogenous NCB5OR indeed has additional NH2-terminal residues. By performing fractionation of subcellular organelles and confocal microscopy, we show that NCB5OR colocalizes with calreticulin, a marker for endoplasmic reticulum.

The subcellular localization and redox properties of NCB5OR provide important insights into the biology of NCB5OR and the phenotype of the Ncb5or-null mouse. The NAD(P)H cytochrome b5 oxidoreductase, Ncb5or (previously named b5+b5R), was first identified in human cell lines and tissues by mining the expressed sequence tag data base (1Zhu H. Qiu H. Yoon H. Huang S. Bunn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14742-14747Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This is the first example in animals of a flavohemoprotein containing a cytochrome b5-like domain at the NH2 terminus and a cytochrome b5 reductase (b5R) 1The abbreviations used are: b5R, cytochrome b5 reductase; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography.-like domain at the COOH terminus (1Zhu H. Qiu H. Yoon H. Huang S. Bunn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14742-14747Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). NCB5OR is encountered in a broad range of vertebrates and invertebrates and is expressed in a variety of cells and tissues. Similar to the classical single-domain cytochrome b5 and b5R counterparts, the cytochrome b5 domain in rat NCB5OR has a six-coordinate b-type heme (2Davis C.A. Dhawan I.K. Johnson M.K. Barber M.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2002; 400: 63-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), and the b5R domain binds flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and NAD(P)H prosthetic groups as found in all members of the ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase superfamily (3Karplus P.A. Daniels M.J. Herriott J.R. Science. 1991; 251: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). The classical cytochrome b5 and b5R proteins form a complex and reside on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes with Δ9 stearoyl-CoA desaturase to catalyze fatty acid desaturation. To anchor on ER membrane, both cytochrome b5 and b5R single-domain proteins use a stretch of hydrophobic residues at their COOH- and NH2-end, respectively, and b5R has additional N-myristoylation (4Borgese N. Aggujaro D. Carrera P. Pietrini G. Bassetti M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1501-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Two pairs of charged residues are responsible for the proper docking between these two proteins to allow electron flow from the b5R to cytochrome b5 protein (5Kawano M. Shirabe K. Nagai T. Takeshita M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 666-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In contrast, NCB5OR is a soluble flavohemoprotein, and its hinge apparently mediates the docking between the cytochrome b5 and b5R domains (1Zhu H. Qiu H. Yoon H. Huang S. Bunn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14742-14747Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Moreover, the hinge sequences show a well-conserved CHORD and SGT1 (CS) motif as found in p23/HSP20, SGT1, CHP, and melusin, where it functions as a mediator for protein-protein interaction (6Garcia-Ranea J.A. Mirey G. Camonis J. Valencia A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 529: 162-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). NCB5OR expressed in Escherichia coli reduces a variety of artificial substrates in vitro, including cytochrome c, ferricyanide, methemoglobin, and molecular oxygen (1Zhu H. Qiu H. Yoon H. Huang S. Bunn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14742-14747Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Because of its ubiquitous expression and capability for superoxide production, we speculated that NCB5OR might function as an oxygen sensor (7Zhu H. Bunn H.F. Respir. Physiol. 1999; 115: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Since our original publication on human Ncb5or, new sequence information has been generated from genome data bases suggesting the presence of an upstream start codon (8Curry B.J. Roman S.D. Wallace C.A. Scott R. Miriami E. Aitken R.J. Genomics. 2004; 83: 425-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This new start codon would result in a full-length transcript encoding 34 additional amino acid residues at the NH2 terminus of the truncated NCB5OR. There has been significant interest regarding whether NCB5OR could produce superoxide in vivo. To clarify these issues, we report in this article the identification of the Ncb5or gene family in animals by bioinformatic analysis. We also confirm by Western analysis that endogenous NCB5OR in mouse tissues is indeed the full-length protein. We show here by both confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation that endogenous NCB5OR colocalizes with calreticulin, an ER marker. Both full-length and truncated recombinant NCB5OR proteins have been generated in a bacterial system. Kinetic measurements have been performed to analyze their NAD(P)H oxidase activity in superoxide production, as well as their NAD(P)H reductase activity in cytochrome c reduction. These studies of cellular localization, enzymology, and redox properties have considerably enhanced our understanding of the biological function of NCB5OR and the phenotype of the Ncb5or-null mouse.2 Fractionation of Subcellular Organelles—Equal-sized livers from wild-type or Ncb5or-null mice (5-week-old females) 2Xie, J., Zhu, H., Larade, K., Ladoux, A., Seguritan, A., Chu, M., Ito, S., Bronson, R. T., Leiter, E. H., Zhang, C.-Y., Rosen, E. D., and Bunn, H. F. (2004) Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., in press. were rapidly excised, rinsed briefly with phosphate-buffered saline, and minced using a sterile razor blade. Tissue slices were transferred to a 50-ml tube, washed with ∼30 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, and allowed to settle to the bottom. This step was repeated once, and the tissue was then resuspended in 7.5 ml of homogenization medium (0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing Complete proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) at the recommended concentration. Cells were disrupted by Dounce homogenization (15 turns) and then centrifuged at 3000 × g for 15 min to obtain a post-nuclear supernatant. The post-nuclear supernatant for each sample was transferred to a polyallomer centrifuge tube (Seton Scientific) and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 40 min to pellet light organelles. This pellet was gently resuspended in homogenization buffer and made up to a volume of 0.6 ml with a density of 5% Nycodenz (5-(N-2,3-dihydroxypropylacetamido)-2,4,6-triiodo-N,N,-bis(2,3-dihydroxypropyl)-isophthalamide; Accurate Chemical). Each sample was loaded on top of a 9-ml continuous 10–30% Nycodenz gradient and then centrifuged for 18 h at 100,000 × g in an SW41Ti rotor on a Beckman L8-55M ultracentrifuge. Twelve 0.75-ml fractions were collected by tube puncture. Aliquots of each fraction (40 μl) were loaded onto a 10% denaturing gel for SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Western Blot Analysis—Primary antibodies were rabbit polyclonal antibodies against NCB5OR NH2-terminal sequence (NH2-LNVPSQAFPAPGSQQ-COOH; Genemed Synthesis Inc.), cytochrome c (H104; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or calreticulin (PA3-900; Affinity BioReagents), all at a 1:1000 dilution. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000; Pierce) was used as the secondary antibody, and enhanced chemiluminescence detection was performed with SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Pierce). Two-photon Confocal Microscopy of HepG2 Cells—HepG2 cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown to subconfluence on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips. They were fixed by ice-cold methanol/acetone (1:1) for 10 min (–20 °C) and then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. Primary antibodies were rabbit polyclonal antibody against human NCB5OR (1:200 dilution; Genemed Synthesis Inc.) and chicken polyclonal antibody against human calreticulin (1:100 dilution; Affinity BioReagents). Secondary antibodies were the Alexa-568-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:400 dilution; Molecular Probes) and the Cy2-conjugated rabbit anti-chicken IgG (1:200 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch). Visualization was performed with a Nikon E1000 microscope (Nikon, Düsseldorf, Germany), equipped with a charge-coupled digital camera (Optronics; Visitron Systems, Puchheim, Germany) and the image acquisition software EZ2000 (Coord, Utrecht, Netherlands). Two-photon images of single immunostained cells were captured by a converted Nikon TE300 microscope employing a Ti:sapphire laser that was tuned to 850 nm and delivered 110-fs pulses at a repetition rate of 76 MHz and a 590–650 nm (Alexa) and a 500–530 nm (Cy2) emission bandpass filter. Two different fluorescence channels were recorded simultaneously. Image stacks (512 × 512 × 64 pixels) were obtained by optical sectioning with a 60× water objective (Nikon, Plan Apochromat DIC H, 1.2 NA). The spatial data were three dimensionally reconstructed from image stacks with the Application Visualization System (Waltham, MA). To enable comparative analysis of the different fluorescent structures, the fluorescence emission was normalized. Areas of equal intensity of fluorescence emission were rendered as isosurfaces and encoded in false colors (red and blue). Confocal Microscopy of Transfected COS7 Cells—Subconfluent COS7 cells were transfected with expression constructs of human full-length or truncated NCB5OR (8 μg DNA/8 million cells on a 10-cm dish) with LipofectAMINE Plus reagents (Invitrogen) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum for 5 h. Cells were then grown in 10% fetal bovine serum medium overnight and split into 6-well plates to grow on glass cover slides. Subconfluent cells were treated as described previously before labeling with antibodies (1Zhu H. Qiu H. Yoon H. Huang S. Bunn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14742-14747Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies were rabbit polyclonal antibody against human calreticulin (1: 250 dilution; Affinity BioReagents) and mouse monoclonal antibody 9E10 against c-myc epitope (1:100 dilution; Sigma). Secondary antibodies were the fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200 dilution; Jackson ImmunoResearch) and the rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:200 dilution; Roche Applied Science). Confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM 510 system (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) at Harvard Center for Neurodegeneration and Repair. The confocal images of transfected COS7 cells were obtained on a Zeiss Axiope 2 microscope with a 560–615 nm (rhodamine) and a 505–530 nm (fluorescein isothiocyanate) emission bandpass filter. Two different fluorescence channels were recorded sequentially with a 63× oil objective (1.4 NA). Preparation of Recombinant NCB5OR—The full-length human and mouse NCB5OR, as well as truncated human NCB5OR, were prepared with a bacterial expression system (1Zhu H. Qiu H. Yoon H. Huang S. Bunn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14742-14747Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The coding sequence was cloned into NdeI and BamHI cloning sites of the pET19b vector (Novagen), and NCB5OR proteins were produced in BL21(DE3) host cells under isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction at 8 °C to ensure proper folding. The poly-His NCB5OR was purified to homogeneity with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chelation (Qiagen) plus ion-exchange Sepharose Q column chromatography (Amersham Biosciences), all performed at 4 °C. NCB5OR holo-proteins, with an A410/A274 of ∼1.0 (explained below), were eluted from Q column with a salt gradient starting with a low-salt buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl) and concentrated with YM10 centricon (Amicon). Small aliquots were made, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C. All NCB5OR samples used in biochemical assays are 90% pure on SDS-PAGE gel and contain ∼95% holo-protein with a > 85% NADH-reducible heme content (explained below). Pure cytochrome b5-core proteins with an A410/A274 of ∼2.5 were generated by using the same system. UV-visible Spectroscopy for Recombinant NCB5OR—Approximately 0.5–1.0 μm (heme) NCB5OR protein in 0.3 ml of low-salt buffer (see above) was analyzed as follows on a Hitachi dual-beam U-2000 spectrophotometer at room temperature. Spectrum 1, a wavelength scan from 650 to 250 nm, was recorded for the oxidized NCB5OR as purified under nonreducing conditions (see above). NCB5OR was reduced instantaneously upon mixing with 3 μl of 10 mm NADH (0.1 mm final concentration) within the sample cuvette, and spectrum 2 was recorded immediately. The difference spectrum [2–1] represents “NADH-reducible” heme. A few granules of solid dithionite powder were added to the above sample to generate spectrum 3. The difference spectrum [3–1] represents “total” heme including both NCB5OR and its degradation product, cytochrome b5. The concentration of heme can be calculated from its difference spectrum, either [2–1] or [3–1], with ϵ(424–410) = 185 mm–1 cm–1 (1Zhu H. Qiu H. Yoon H. Huang S. Bunn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14742-14747Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), or from spectrum 1 of 100% oxidized NCB5OR with ϵ410 = 138 mm–1 cm–1. All NCB5OR proteins were analyzed for NADH-reducible heme contents and for their heme/protein ratios. The percentage of NADH-reducible heme was calculated from [heme]reduced (2–1)/[heme]reduced (3–1). This value reflects the content of NCB5OR among the total hemoproteins (NCB5OR+b5), as well as the electron flow within NCB5OR, which is intrinsically determined by protein folding. Pure and fully native NCB5OR flavohemoprotein is expected to have 100% NADH-reducible heme. The heme/protein ratio, as calculated from their corresponding absorbance A410 and A274, was used to estimate the total heme content of proteins. Pure NCB5OR holo-protein has an A410/A274 ratio of ∼1.0, indicating one heme per protein. This value has been confirmed by our reverse phase HPLC analysis, which simultaneously quantifies prothestic groups and polypeptides of the same protein (see below). Reverse Phase HPLC—Approximately 500 pmol of (heme) recombinant human NCB5OR (truncated) were loaded onto a Discovery C8 column (15 cm × 4.6 mm; 5 μm; Supelco) connected to a Ranin Rabbit HP system (Varian). The FAD, heme, and polypeptides were eluted with a water and acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and monitored at 220 nm with Dynamax UV-C detector (Varian). The absolute amounts of FAD, heme, and polypeptides were determined from individual peak area against standard curves of 320–8400 pmol of FAD and hemin (Sigma) and 4–50 μg of bovine serum albumin (Pierce). Peak area from the chromatogram was integrated with Dynamax Method Manager 1.4.3 (Varian) and used to quantify FAD, heme, cytochrome b5, and NCB5OR fractions. All major peaks were collected, lyophilized, and identified by color and SDS-PAGE. The concentration of FAD standard solution was determined by its A375 or A450 with ϵ375 = 9.4 mm–1 cm–1 or ϵ450 = 11.3 mm–1 cm–1, respectively. Alkaline hematin D575 was used to determine the concentration of hemin standard solution (10Zander R. Lang W. Wolf H.U. J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem. 1989; 27: 185-189PubMed Google Scholar). Resonance Raman Spectroscopy—Resonance Raman spectra were acquired at ambient temperature using 413.1 nm excitation from Kr+ lasers (11Lukat-Rodgers G.S. Wengenack N.L. Rusnak F. Rodgers K.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9984-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The 10-mW laser beam was focused to a line on the sample, and UV-visible spectra were recorded before and after resonance Raman experiments to be certain that laser-induced degradation of neither the heme nor the flavin had occurred during Raman acquisition. Samples ranging in concentration from 0.05 to 0.30 μm were contained in 5-mm NMR tubes and spun at ∼20 Hz using a homemade NMR tube spinner. Spectra were recorded using f1 collection, holographic notch filters, a 0.64-m spectrograph fitted with a 110 × 110-mm, 2400-groove/mm holographic grating, and a 1100-pixel liquid N2-cooled charge-coupled device detection system. The spectrometer was calibrated with toluene, dimethylformamide, and CH2Br2 as frequency standards. Kinetics of Superoxide Production—The spectrophotometric-based steady-state kinetics apparatus is specifically designed for this experiment (see Fig. 6A). Oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2) gasses (BOC gases) were mixed to the desired concentration using a computerized gas mixer (Environics Series 200) before being delivered at 120 ml/min to the gas-tight reaction vessel (The Custom Glass Shop) with Viton tubing (Masterflex L/S 16; Cole-Parmer). Sample dissolved oxygen concentration and temperature were monitored using a temperature compensated oxygen and temperature electrode and meter (OM2000 from Cameron Instrument Company or inoLab Oxi DO WTW from Fisher Scientific). Before use, the electrode was zeroed by exposure to 100% N2 gas and spanned by exposure to 20% O2 gas or room air. The UV-visible spectrophotometer was interfaced via RS-232C to a Macintosh IIsi computer running FutureBasic II (STAZ Software, Inc.) to provide remote control, data acquisition, and data storage. All chemicals were from Sigma. Stock solutions of 10 mm NADH/1 mm NAD or 10 mm NADPH/1 mm NADP and 2000 units/15 μl superoxide dismutase in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, were freshly prepared and kept on ice under N2 and protected from ambient light until use. Each reaction mixture was prepared on ice immediately before individual kinetics runs. Samples included 10–40 nm (heme) for truncated NCB5OR or 0.5–1 μm (heme) for full-length NCB5OR plus 1000 units of superoxide dismutase in a final volume of 1.5 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8. The reaction mixture was equilibrated to the desired dissolved O2 concentration at 20 °C with gentle stirring before initiating the reaction with 15 μl of NADH/NAD or NADPH/NADP solution. The final reaction mixture was stirred for an additional5sand subsequently delivered under gas pressure to the flow cell (10-mm path length; Starna). A340 was measured as a function of time from 0 to 600 s in 6-s intervals. Data analysis was performed on a Mac G4 computer (Apple) running Excel (Microsoft) with Solver. dA340/dt was fit to a linear function, the slope of which was used to calculate the initial velocity of NAD(P)H consumption or superoxide production, vo, using ϵ340 = 6.22 mm–1 cm–1 for NAD(P)H and assuming the rate of [NAD(P)H] consumption is equal to twice the rate of superoxide production. vo versus [O2] was fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation to determine Km and Vmax and to calculate kcat and the enzyme efficiency kcat/Km. For all calculations, 100% O2 = 1.3 mm (20°C, 1 atm). Kinetic Measurement of Cytochrome c Reduction—The spectrophotometric-based steady-state kinetics apparatus, similar to that outlined in Fig. 6A, was used to monitor cytochrome c reduction. The reaction vessel and gas control devices were omitted in the NAD(P)H reductase assay for the following reason. When compared with the rate of cytochrome c reduction directly by NCB5OR, the rate as contributed from superoxide, a product from the NAD(P)H oxidase activity of NCB5OR, was negligible under ambient air. The measurement was initiated immediately after NADH or NADPH was added to a quartz cuvette and mixed thoroughly with 25 nm (heme) NCB5OR plus oxidized cytochrome c (Sigma) in a final volume of 0.3 ml of low-salt buffer (20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl). To measure the Km for cytochrome c, the substrate was mixed at a final concentration of 0–40 μm with 0.1 mm NADH or NADPH, and the absorbance change at 340 nm was recorded. To measure the Km for NADH or NADPH, the reductant was mixed at a final concentration of 0–10 μm with 20 μm cytochrome c, and the absorbance change at 550 nm was recorded. Data analysis was performed as described above. The vo versus [substrate] curve was fitted to the Michaelis-Menten equation to generate kinetics constants. vo is defined as the rate of electron transfer in all calculations.υo=dA550/(dt×ε)when [cytochrome c] is monitored (ε550=20mM−1cm−1)(Eq. 1) υo=−2×dA340/(dt×ε)when [NAD(P)H] is monitored (ε340=6.22mM−1cm−1)(Eq. 2) Measurement of Oxidation-Reduction Potentials—Potentiometric titrations were performed as described previously (12Cross A.R. Rae J. Curnutte J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17075-17077Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). 20–50 pmol (10–30 nm) of human NCB5OR (truncated) or cytochrome b5 core proteins in 1.8 ml of 100 mm KCl, 50 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, were used for each measurement. This buffer was supplemented with Complete proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) to prevent degradation of the sample during the analysis (3–4 h). Spectra were recorded between 600 and 520 nm at a series of electrode potentials, using a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 18 spectrophotometer. An Orion 720A meter (Orion Research Inc.) was used to measure the half-cell potential relative to a saturated calomel reference electrode. The potential was adjusted by the addition of <5 μl aliquots of solutions of sodium dithionite (reductive titrations) and potassium ferricyanide (oxidative titrations). The accuracy of the apparatus was checked by titration of a 5 μm solution of phenosafranin (E =–252 mV). The following mediators were used at 10 μm: phenazine methosulfate; phenazine ethosulfate; anthraquinone; anthraquinone 2-sulfonate; anthraquinone 2,6-disulfonate; 2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone; and 2,3,5,6-tetramethylphenylenediamine. Pyocyanine was added at 6 μm. The degree of reduction of NCB5OR or cytochrome b5 core was estimated from the height of the α absorbance band at 558 nm. The values of absorbance were plotted against electrode potential, and the best fit to the data points was calculated using the GraphPad Prism software package (San Diego, CA) using the Nernst equation. Ncb5or Gene Family—The Ncb5or gene, first cloned from human liver cells (1Zhu H. Qiu H. Yoon H. Huang S. Bunn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14742-14747Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), has now been identified in all animals tested, including mammals, chicken, Xenopus, fish, tunicate, Drosophila, nematodes, sea urchin, and algae. The amino acid sequences of all currently identified NCB5OR proteins are aligned in Supplementary Fig. 1. As reported previously by our group (1Zhu H. Qiu H. Yoon H. Huang S. Bunn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14742-14747Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), NCB5OR proteins contain a cytochrome b5-like domain at the NH2 terminus (∼130 residues), a b5R-like domain at the COOH terminus (∼300 residues), and a hinge (∼90 residues) linking the two domains. The primary sequence of the cytochrome b5 domain is very conserved in all NCB5OR proteins. Likewise, the b5R domains share conserved FAD- and NAD(P)H-binding sites. NCB5OR family members can be distinguished by their overall structural motifs, as well as their signature sequences, which are different from those of the closely related cytochrome b5 and b5R. Namely, NCB5OR is one residue shorter between the two axial histidines in the cytochrome b5 domain and fifteen residues shorter between FAD2 and NAD(P)H1 sites in the b5R domain (Fig. 1 in Ref. 1Zhu H. Qiu H. Yoon H. Huang S. Bunn H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14742-14747Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). NH2 Terminus of Endogenous NCB5OR—All Ncb5or genes currently identified in animals have an additional start codon upstream of the one previously assigned. This start codon was not detected during our initial cloning for 5′-untranslated region sequence by rapid amplification of cDNA ends-PCR. Moreover, our previous sequence alignment of 5′-untranslated region presented no consensus among all expressed sequence tag entries available at that time. Our bioinfomatic analysis supports the assignment of an upstream start codon. The Ncb5or genes of zebrafish-Singapore and algae have only the 5′ start codon. Their second putative start site is absent due to a single-base change resulting in an amino acid substitution from methionine to leucine in zebrafish-Singapore or from methionine to valine in algae (shown in Supplementary Fig. 1). In addition, the Kozak sequences in all vertebrate Ncb5or genes have a better match to the optimal sequences at the 5′ ATG site (Fig. 1) because, according to a survey of 699 vertebrate genes (13Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar), A/G is preferred over C/T at the –3 site. To confirm this NH2-terminal assignment, we have performed Western blot analysis to detect endogenous NCB5OR with a polyclonal antibody against the NH2 terminus of NCB5OR. We took advantage of the Ncb5or-null mice that have been recently generated by gene-specific targeting.2 By comparing equal amounts of protein samples from wild-type and Ncb5or-null mice, a protein band of the expected size was present in wild-type liver, but not in Ncb5or-null tissue (Fig. 2). The same pattern was observed in mouse pancreata with the same antibody (data not shown) or a polyclonal antibody against the whole mouse NCB5OR.2 Therefore, endogenous NCB5OR is translated from the upstream initiation site in these tissues. Subcellular Localization—Our initial studies of subcellular localization of NCB5OR were based on confocal microscopy on COS7 (monkey kidney) cells expressing exogenous human truncated NCB5OR with a c-myc epitope tag. To define the subcellular localization of endogenous NCB5OR in more detail, we have employed two different methods. As shown in Fig. 2, after the removal of nuclei and cytosol, fractionation of intact subcellular organelles of mouse liver on a continuous density gradient established that endogenous mouse NCB5OR is present in isolated fractions that are enriched with the ER marker calreticulin (lanes 4–8) but is not found in the fractions enriched with the mitochondrial marker cytochrome c (lanes 1–3). Because recombinant NCB5OR is soluble, endogenous NCB5OR is likely to reside in the lumen of isolated ER. In parallel, we have performed two-photon confocal microscopy on endogenous human NCB5OR in HepG2 cells (Fig. 3A), as well as confocal microscopy on exogenous human NCB5OR in COS7 cells (Fig. 3B), to study the colocalization of NCB5OR with ER.

Because CD28 is the major costimulatory receptor for the induction of T cell-mediated immunity, the mechanism(s) underlying CD28 loss is of paramount interest. Current models of replicative senescence involve protracted procedures to generate CD28null cells from CD28+ precursors; hence, a T-cell line model was used to examine the dynamics of CD28 expression. Here, we show the versatility of the JT and Jtag cell lines in tracking CD28null ↔ CD28hi phenotypic transitions. JT and Jtag cells were CD28null and CD28lo, respectively, but expressed high levels of CD28 when exposed to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. This was a result of the reconstitution of the CD28 gene transcriptional initiator (INR). Tumor necrosis factor-α reduced CD28 expression because of the inhibition of INR-driven transcription. Ligation of CD28 by an antibody or by CD80 also down-regulated CD28 transcription through the same mechanism, providing evidence that CD28 can generate a T cell receptor-independent signal with a unique biological outcome. Collectively, these data unequivocally demonstrate the critical role of the INR in the regulation of CD28 expression. T cell lines with transient expression of CD28 are invaluable in the dissection of the biochemical processes involved in the transactivation of the CD28 INR, the silencing of which is a key event in the ontogenesis of senescent T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2075719564,"Two distinct circularly permuted forms of chicken avidin were designed with the aim of constructing a fusion avidin containing two biotin-binding sites in one polypeptide. The old N and C termini of wild-type avidin were connected to each other via a glycine/serine-rich linker, and the new termini were introduced into two different loops. This enabled the creation of the desired fusion construct using a short linker peptide between the two different circularly permuted subunits. The circularly permuted avidins (circularly permuted avidin 5 → 4 and circularly permuted avidin 6 → 5) and their fusion, pseudotetrameric dual chain avidin, were biologically active, i.e. showed biotin binding, and also displayed structural characteristics similar to those of wild-type avidin. Dual chain avidin facilitates the development of dual affinity avidins by allowing adjustment of the ligand-binding properties in half of the binding sites independent of the other half. In addition, the subunit fusion strategy described in this study can be used, where applicable, to modify oligomeric proteins in general.

Avidin, a glycoprotein found in chicken egg white as well as its distant relative, streptavidin, from Streptomyces bacteria, are nanoscale devices that perform one particular task, the harvesting of free biotin, extremely well. The avidin-biotin interaction is so strong that even the harsh conditions in the digestive tract are insufficient to break the ingested avidin-biotin complexes (1Green N.M. Adv. Protein Chem. 1975; 29: 85-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1604) Google Scholar). It is understandable, therefore, that this highly stable interaction has been widely applied in numerous fields of the life sciences to probe, label, affinity separate, and target biomolecules. Collectively these applications are known as the (strept)avidin-biotin technology (2Wilchek M. Bayer E.A. Biomol. Eng. 1999; 16: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This technology has been facilitated by the ease with which biotin can be coupled to almost any other molecule without compromising the strong (strept)avidin-biotin interaction or the function of the target molecule. Both avidin and streptavidin are homotetramers encoded by a single gene (3Ahlroth M.K. Kola E.H. Ewald D. Masabanda J. Sazanov A. Fries R. Kulomaa M.S. Anim.

From the evolutionary point of view this also means that in both proteins all four binding sites co-evolve. The monomers of avidin and streptavidin are simple classical anti-parallel β-barrels. They have an identical topology of eight successive β-strands and their interconnecting loops. When the three-dimensional structures of these proteins are superimposed, it is evident that the termini and also the biotin-binding pocket are located in topologically analogous regions in both proteins. Two monomer pairs in each (strept)avidin tetramer share a large common interface and, hence, are known as the structural dimers. The complete tetramer is composed of two such structural dimers (6Pugliese L. Coda A. Malcovati M. Bolognesi M. J. Mol.

In some studies the focus has been on the adjustment of the physicochemical properties of (strept)avidin, whereas in other studies the target has been the fine-tuning of the biotin binding affinity of the protein. Nevertheless, because these mutant protein subunits are single gene products, the desired changes, produced by mutations, take effect simultaneously in all (strept)avidin subunits. In several cases, however, it would be of benefit to be able to alter, for example, the binding affinity in only some subunits of the tetramer while conserving the tight binding in the remaining binding sites. Chilkoti et al. (17Chilkoti A. Schwartz B.L. Smith R.D. Long C.J. Stayton P.S. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 1198-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) developed a partial solution to this problem by producing two separate streptavidin forms, one with natural high affinity biotin-binding capacity and the other with reduced affinity. They denatured and mixed these two forms, after which the mixture was renatured. Nevertheless, the refolding led to a wide variety of alternative forms: some contained four high affinity binding sites, whereas other forms had an ascending series of lower affinity binding sites, finally ending in the form that contained four lower affinity binding sites. It is arguable that genetic fusion of the subunits might be a more straightforward and effective strategy to create (strept)avidin molecules with divergent affinity properties. The N and C termini of the distinct (strept)avidin subunits are, however, located far away from each other in the quaternary structure; therefore, any simple fusion strategy would presumably fail. A common approach to the study of protein folding and the significance of secondary structure topology is the creation of circularly permuted forms of the proteins in question (26Uliel S. Fliess A. Unger R. Protein Eng. 2001; 14: 533-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Usually in this approach the original N and C termini are brought together with a linker peptide, whereas the new termini are typically introduced into a loop region. In most cases proteins withstand these modifications rather well, exhibiting no radical alterations in their structure or function. Chu et al. (23Chu V. Freitag S. Le Trong I. Stenkamp R.E. Stayton P.S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 848-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) have described a circularly permuted streptavidin that displayed a three-dimensional structure almost identical to that of the native protein. In their study, the circular permutation strategy was used as a tool to delete the loop between β-strands 3 and 4 in streptavidin. This loop is functionally important because it undergoes an open-to-closed conformational change upon biotin binding (7Hendrickson W.A. Pähler A. Smith J.L. Satow Y. Merritt E.A. Phizackerley R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 2190-2194Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 9Weber P.C. Ohlendorf D.H. Wendoloski J.J. Salemme F.R. Science. 1989; 243: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1047) Google Scholar). Consequently, when the new termini were introduced into this loop, the affinity of the resultant mutant for biotin collapsed by six orders of magnitude in comparison to that of wild-type (wt) 1The abbreviations used are: wt, wild-type; dcAvd, dual chain avidin; cpAvd, circularly permuted Avd.1The abbreviations used are: wt, wild-type; dcAvd, dual chain avidin; cpAvd, circularly permuted Avd. streptavidin. In the present study, our objective was to create an avidin with four binding sites that would consist of only two polypeptide chains. At first, we constructed two circularly permuted forms of avidin in which the new termini were in an ideal position to allow the building of the desired subunit fusion. We describe the construction of this dual chain avidin (dcAvd) through the fusing of the monomers of the structural dimer and show that it formed a wt-like pseudotetrameric quaternary structure and that its four biotin-binding sites exhibited high affinity biotin binding. This construct can be used in the future as a structural scaffold to change the affinity parameters in some subunits while preserving the high biotin binding affinity in the remaining binding sites. This study also sheds light on the factors that should be considered when other multisubunit proteins are engineered by combining separate subunits into genetically continuous units. Production and Purification of the Mutant Avidins—The circularly permuted avidins and dcAvd were produced in baculovirus-infected insect cells. They were purified from the cell extracts by 2-iminobiotin-agarose affinity chromatography essentially as described in detail elsewhere (11Laitinen O.H. Airenne K.J. Marttila A.T. Kulik T. Porkka E.

Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Biotin-Binding Assays—An IAsys biosensor was used to determine the affinity of the proteins toward 2-iminobiotin and the reversibility of biotin binding, essentially as previously described in detail (10Marttila A.T. Airenne K.J. Laitinen O.H. Kulik T. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the reversibility assay, the sample proteins were allowed to bind to a biotinylated cuvette surface in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 m NaCl. After equilibrium was reached, the cuvette was washed and filled with phosphate-buffered saline, 1 m NaCl containing biotin (423 μg/ml), and the dissociation of the proteins was monitored for 1 h. Colorimetric 2-(4′-hydroxyazobenzene)benzoic acid assay for the determination of the free biotin-binding sites was performed essentially as described by Green (28Green N.M. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 18: 418-424Crossref Scopus (315) Google Scholar) using a Beckman DU640 spectrophotometer. Gel Filtration Chromatography—Quaternary status of the avidin mutants was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) connected to a Shimadzu HPLC system with a SCL-10A VP system controller, RF-10A XL fluorescence detector, and SPD-M10A VP diode array detector. The data obtained were processed with the Class VP 5.03 program. As a running buffer we used 50 mm sodium phosphate, 650 mm NaCl, pH 7.2. All runs were performed with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The molecular mass markers were bovine serum albumin (68 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), and cytochrome c (12.4 kDa). Stability Analyses—Protein samples were acetylated and temperature-dependent dissociation of the subunits after heat treatment for 20 min at temperatures between 25 and 100 °C was monitored from Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gels essentially as described in detail by Bayer et al. (29Bayer E.A. Ehrlich-Rogozinski S. Wilchek M. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Proteinase K assay was performed essentially as described by Laitinen et al. (11Laitinen O.H. Airenne K.J. Marttila A.T. Kulik T. Porkka E. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Planning of the Constructs—The three-dimensional structure of the avidin tetramer (coordinates kindly given by Dr. Oded Livnah) was examined to identify the β-strands of the barrels, along which polypeptide transition from one subunit to the other would create as little structural disturbance as possible. The study revealed that in the quaternary structure β-strand 4 in one subunit and β-strand 6 in neighboring subunit of the structural dimer are juxtaposed. Moreover, when β-strand 4 goes up in one barrel, β-strand 6 goes down in the neighboring subunit. Therefore, we decided to use the loops 4 → 5 and 5 → 6 of the neighboring subunits as the monomer-monomer transition point in dcAvd (Fig. 1). Determination of the transition point automatically determined the positions of the termini of the two circularly permuted avidins, which were as follows: the N terminus of the first circularly permuted avidin (cpAvd5 → 4) is located before β-strand 5 in the wild-type sequence, and the new C terminus follows β-strand 4. Likewise, the second circularly permuted avidin (cpAvd6 → 5) started just before β-strand 6 and ended after β-strand 5 (Fig. 1A). In cpAvd5 → 4 and cpAvd6 → 5, the original N and C termini were brought together with an artificial hexapeptide loop (GGSGGS). Both constructs started with the normal signal peptide of avidin, followed by the first three N-terminal amino acid residues of wt avidin to ensure appropriate cleavage by signal peptidase. Finally, the desired subunit fusion was constructed by combining the two circularly permuted avidins described above (Fig. 1). A tripeptide linker (SGG) was used to connect the C terminus of cpAvd5 → 4 to the N terminus of cpAvd6 → 5, and the resultant subunit fusion protein (GenBank™ accession number AJ616762) was designated dual chain avidin (dcAvd). Protein Production and Purification—Production of the proteins was done in baculovirus-infected insect cells essentially as previously reported (27Airenne K.J. Oker-Blom C. Marjomäki V.S. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Kulomaa M.S. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 9: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). All constructs were soluble and were efficiently purified in a single step on 2-iminobiotin-agarose column (data not shown). Biotin Binding Experiments—Reversibility of biotin binding and affinity toward 2-iminobiotin were determined by surface plasmon resonance using an IAsys biosensor (Table I). CpAvd5 → 4 showed binding characteristics similar to those of wt avidin in both assays, whereas cpAvd6 → 5 was more reversible and exhibited reduced affinity when compared with that of wt avidin. Interestingly, dcAvd showed similar reversibility to that of wt avidin, and its affinity toward 2-iminobiotin showed only a negligible decrease. The number of functional biotin-binding sites per dcAvd pseudotetramer (“pseudo” because, in fact, it is a dimer with four binding sites) was determined by a colorimetric 2-(4′-hydroxyazobenzene)benzoic acid assay according to Green (28Green N.M. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 18: 418-424Crossref Scopus (315) Google Scholar). The results from two independent experiments gave an approximation of 3.3 free biotin-binding sites/molecule.Table IBiosensor analysesProteinkakdKd (equilibrium)Kd (relation)Reversibilitym-1s-1s-1mm%wt Avd(5.5 ± 0.5) × 105(1.9 ± 1.4) × 10-3(2.2 ± 1.0) × 10-8(3.4 ± 2.5) × 10-89cpAvd5 → 4(2.6 ± 0.3) × 105(1.6 ± 0.7) × 10-3(1.5 ± 0.5) × 10-8(5.9 ± 2.6) × 10-89cpAvd6 → 5(3.9 ± 1.2) × 104(3.9 ± 2.2) × 10-3(5.5 ± 2.3) × 10-7(9.9 ± 7.6) × 10-716dcAvd(9.8 ± 1.3) × 104(1.1 ± 0.5) × 10-3(4.1 ± 1.2) × 10-8(1.1 ± 0.5) × 10-78 Open table in a new tab Structure Analyses—According to gel filtration chromatography, the deduced molecular masses (Table II) indicated that all constructs had folded correctly and formed quaternary structures resembling that of wt avidin; circularly permuted forms were tetramers and dcAvd was a dimer (pseudotetramer). In the denaturing SDS-PAGE both circularly permuted avidins had apparent molecular masses corresponding to a monomeric form (Fig. 2), whereas dcAvd had a molecular mass of ∼32 kDa, which corresponds well to its theoretical molecular mass. Moreover, we also observed that cpAvd6 → 5 was more glycosylated than cpAvd5 → 4.Table IICharacterization of the proteinsProteinMWTrTr + btnkDa°C°Cwt Avd626095cpAvd5 → 4524575cpAvd6 → 5564070dcAvd564075 Open table in a new tab Stability Analyses—All the avidin proteins were subjected to a heat/SDS-PAGE stability analysis (29Bayer E.A. Ehrlich-Rogozinski S. Wilchek M. Electrophoresis. 1996; 17: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The results (Table II) revealed that the mutants were somewhat less stable than wt avidin. The durability of the avidins in the presence of proteinase K was also tested (Fig. 3), and the mutated avidin forms were found to be more prone to cleavage than wt avidin, both in the absence and presence of biotin. There are two main reasons for the plethora of studies describing different chemical modifications and genetically engineered forms of avidin and streptavidin. The first is naturally connected to the widespread utilization of these proteins across a multitude of applications. This has led to regulation of their physicochemical properties and biotin-binding properties both to broaden the spectrum of their potential applications and conditions of use and to overcome some of the drawbacks inherent in the (strept)avidin-biotin system. Secondly, the (strept)avidin-biotin pair serves as an interesting model system of an oligomeric protein that displays extremely high affinity toward a small ligand. In the present study, we used avidin as a model by engineering the topology of the multisubunit protein that has its N and C termini of the distinct subunits far away from each other. The aim was to modify avidin so that its four binding sites would be composed of only two polypeptide chains, instead of the four found in wt avidin. We accomplished this by joining together the two monomers that form the structural dimer (8Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5076-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) in wt avidin. Understandably, we wanted the resultant protein to retain as far as possible the structurally and functionally important properties of the wt protein. Sanders et al. (30Sanders K.E. Lo J. Sligar S.G. Blood. 2002; 100: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) succeeded in their modification of hemoglobin by first constructing a circularly permuted form of the α-chain and then fusing this novel subunit to the wt α-subunit. This fused pseudodimeric α-unit was able to oligomerize with the wt β-subunits, and the resultant chimera was functionally almost indistinguishable from the wt oligomer. Although elegant, this procedure differs somewhat from the dual chain avidin described in the present study: only two subunits of the heterotetrameric complex were joined to a single polypeptide chain and two others entered the complex as single units. To achieve our goal, we were forced to modulate the natural topology of wt avidin in order to bring the termini of the subunits closer to each other. Therefore, we first constructed two circularly permuted forms. In the first mutant the termini were at one end of the barrel, whereas in the second mutant they were at the opposite end (Fig. 1). Because biotin binds to one end of the avidin barrel, we expected that in cpAvd6 → 5, where the new termini were introduced to that end, it could affect the biotin binding. According to this assumption, in cpAvd6 → 5, where the new termini appeared on the loop between β-strands 5 and 6 that contains the biotin-binding residues Trp-70, Phe-72, Ser-73, and Ser-75 (numbering according to wt avidin; Ref. 8Livnah O. Bayer E.A. Wilchek M. Sussman J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5076-5080Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar), the biotin-binding affinity was slightly reduced. One reason for the lowered affinity might be that the new free termini, and therefore also these biotin-binding residues, have more freedom to move compared with the corresponding loop in wt avidin. However, when compared with the previously mentioned circularly permuted streptavidin (23Chu V. Freitag S. Le Trong I. Stenkamp R.E. Stayton P.S. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 848-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the affinity of cpAvd6 → 5 was relatively well preserved. Furthermore, in cpAvd5 → 4, where the new termini were introduced into the loop between β-strands 4 and 5, which is at the non-binding end of the barrel, no major changes were detected in its biotin-binding properties. Interestingly, dcAvd exhibited binding properties that were somewhere between the two circularly permuted avidins. One reason for this could be that the dcAvd pseudotetramer has two rather well preserved biotin-binding sites exhibiting strong affinity toward biotin originating from cpAvd5 → 4 and two biotin-binding sites with reduced affinity originating from cpAvd6 → 5. On the other hand, in dcAvd two of the new termini are fused with the SGG linker, which provides the transition from one monomer to the other, thereby possibly rescuing part of the structural rigidity of the wt loop (5 → 6) and therefore also retaining part of the binding affinity. The thermal stability and proteinase K durability of the circularly permuted avidins and dcAvd were somewhat lower than in the case of wt avidin. Proteinase K seemed to digest the new loops faster (not shown) than loop 3–4, which it is able to break in wt avidin (31Ellison D. Hinton J. Hubbard S.J. Beynon R.J. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 1337-1345Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). This indicates that the artificial hexapeptide loops that connect the old termini were probably not optimal in terms of protein stability. Furthermore, for some unknown reason cpAvd6 → 5 seemed to be more glycosylated than cpAvd5 → 4. However, this may explain why the molecular mass of the former mutant, according to high pressure liquid chromatography, was slightly higher than that of the latter one. There is an interesting uncertainty concerning the quaternary structure of dcAvd. Because of its structural symmetry, it may have two different quaternary structures. Depending on the outcome of this quaternary structure assembly, the termini of both dcAvd monomers may be orientated to the same or to the opposite face of the pseudotetramer. At present, we do not know what the precise orientation of the dcAvd subunits is. They may form a mixture of two different structural forms; alternatively, some unknown structural phenomenon may favor one over the other. However, it might be possible to introduce a non-symmetrical disulfide bridge between the dcAvd monomers in order to fix their quaternary structure to the desired assembly. Although in this study we utilized avidin as a model of a multisubunit protein whose topology was extensively transformed, dcAvd also provides a potential structural scaffold for avidins with mixed affinity properties. Such forthcoming dcAvd variants may have enormous value in avidin-biotin technology applications. The rationale for these high expectations derives from the fact that dcAvd is a genetically fused entity, which enables the avidin subunit properties to be engineered separately. It should be possible to maintain the high affinity toward biotin in two of the binding sites while modifying the affinity in the other two sites as desired. One option could be to make two of the binding sites reversible, which would enable bound materials to be mildly detached by free biotin (11Laitinen O.H. Airenne K.J. Marttila A.T. Kulik T. Porkka E.

Another procedure might be to modify half of the binding sites with smart polymer conjugates able to respond to changes in pH, light intensity, and temperature (34Ding Z. Fong R.B. Long C.J. Stayton P.S. Hoffman A.S. Nature. 2001; 411: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 35Shimoboji T. Ding Z. Stayton P.S. Hoffman A.S. Bioconjugate Chem. 2001; 12: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It might then be possible to alter the binding characteristics of the modified sites by adjusting these physical/chemical parameters. In theory, it is even possible to adjust the binding characteristics so that the resultant protein is able to bind something totally different from biotin with half of the binding sites."

As such, they are being used in clinical trials for the treatment and prevention of solid tumors and are used to treat cutaneous T cell lymphoma. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the anti-cancer effects of RXR agonists remain unclear. Here, we show that a novel pro-apoptotic pathway that is induced by RXR agonist is negatively regulated by casein kinase 1α (CK1α). CK1α associates with RXR in an agonist-dependent manner and phosphorylates RXR. The ability of an RXR agonist to recruit CK1α to a complex with RXR in cells correlates inversely with its ability to inhibit growth. Remarkably, depletion of CK1α in resistant cells renders them susceptible to RXR agonist-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis. Our study shows that CK1α can promote cell survival by interfering with RXR agonist-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of CK1α may enhance the anti-cancer effects of RXR agonists.

Retinoids (natural retinoic acids and their synthetic derivatives) exert biological effects by regulating gene transcription through two classes of nuclear receptors, the retinoic acid receptors (RAR 1The abbreviations used are: RAR, retinoic acid receptor; RXR, retinoid X receptor; NGF, nerve growth factor; siRNA, small interfering RNA; CK1α, casein kinase 1α; TTNPB, 4-(E-2-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-5,5,8,8-tetramethyl-2-naphthalenyl)-1-propenyl)benzoic acid; luc, luciferase.α,-β, and -γ) and the retinoid X receptors (RXRα, -β, and -γ) (1Mangelsdorf D.J.

However, despite the ubiquitous expression of RXRs, many malignant cells are insensitive to RXR agonists, and it is, therefore, important to identify cellular mechanisms that mediate this resistance. RXRs associate with various proteins that play important roles in regulating cell survival. Nerve growth factor (NGF) induces the phosphorylation of the orphan nuclear receptor NGFI-B (Nur77 or TR3), which is heterodimerized with RXR, leading to translocation of the NGFI-B·RXR complex out of the nucleus (15Katagiri Y. Takeda K. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Ozato K. Guroff G. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 435-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). In the presence of apoptotic stimuli, NGFI-B is translocated from the nucleus to mitochondria, causing cytochrome c release and apoptosis (16Li H. Kolluri S.K. Gu J. Dawson M.I. Cao X. Hobbs P.D.

RXRα binds insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 and is necessary for the induction of apoptosis by insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-3 or RXR agonists in cancer cells (18Liu B. Lee H.Y. Weinzimer S.A. Powell D.R. Clifford J.L. Kurie J.M. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33607-33613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). We have shown that RXR agonists affect the proliferation of cells by promoting interaction of RXRα with β-catenin and the degradation of both of these molecules (19Xiao J.H. Ghosn C. Hinchman C.

The variety of roles that RXRs can play in regulating cell survival leads to the possibility that tumor cells may circumvent RXR-driven apoptosis. Here we demonstrate the requirement of both RXR agonist and RXR protein for driving the pro-apoptotic and growth inhibitory effects in cells and identify a protective mechanism for the RXR action in which an RXR agonist-induced apoptotic pathway is negatively regulated by the protein kinase casein kinase 1α (CK1α). Retinoids and Other Materials—The following synthetic retinoids were synthesized at Allergan Inc. (Irvine, CA) and were dissolved in Me2SO: RXR agonist (AGN194204), RXR antagonist (AGN195393), and RAR agonist (TTNPB). Monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2) antibody was from Sigma. Monoclonal anti-V5 antibody was from Invitrogen. Polyclonal anti-RXRα (D20), anti-CK1α, and CK1ϵ antibodies were from Stressgen or Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Construction of Expression Vectors—Constructions of FLAG-RXR and its mutants (RXR-CDE, RXR-DE, RXR-E, RXR-ΔC, RXR-ΔAF2, RXR-CDEΔAF2, RXR-DEΔAF2, RXR-EΔAF2) (19Xiao J.H. Ghosn C. Hinchman C. Forbes C.

Full-length human cDNA clones of CK1α were found in the expressed sequence tag data base and purchased from Invitrogen. The coding regions were amplified by PCR and inserted into the expression vector pcDNA3.1. Cell Culture, Recombinant Protein Expression, and Transactivation Assay—Human embryonic kidney (HEK293), HeLa, CV-1, and Jurkat cells were from ATCC and grown according to ATCC instructions. DT40 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HircRXR cells, the rat fibroblasts that stably express the human insulin receptor and RXR, were kindly provided by Dr. Jyoti Kusari. The effects of AGN194204 on the growth of cell lines were measured by counting viable cells after treatment with various doses for 3–6 days. Data are presented as a percentage of control (without treatment). Transfection of the cells with expression vectors was performed using LipofectAMINE. The cells were lysed with lysis buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) plus 40 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), and lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 12,000 × g. To establish HEK293, DT40, Jurkat, and HeLa cells that stably express RXRα, the RXR insert was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (neomycin) or pcDNA3.1 (hygromycin). Individual colonies were selected and expanded from transfected cells in medium that contained 0.6–2 mg/ml Geneticin or 0.3 mg/ml hygromycin B. For the transactivation assay, CV-1 cells were seeded at a concentration of 1.5 × 105 cells per well in 6-well plates. After overnight culture, cells were transfected as described in the legend to Fig. 4. All transfections contained a β-galactosidase expression vector (Promega) to correct transfection efficiency. The pRXRE-Luc is the report plasmid that contains five tandem repeats of a 35-base pair sequence (DR-1) from the promoter of the mouse CRBP-II gene (21Mangelsdorf D.J. Umesono K. Kliewer S.A. Borgmeyer U. Ong E.S. Evans R.M. Cell. 1991; 66: 555-561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) inserted immediately upstream of thymidine kinase-luciferase. pRARE-Luc contains three copies of DR-5 (22Klein E.S. Pino M.E. Johnson A.T. Davies P.J. Nagpal S. Thacher S.M. Krasinski G. Chandraratna R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22692-22696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). 24 h after transfection, the cells were incubated for another 16 h in medium containing 0.5% charcoal-treated serum along with the ligand and then harvested for the measurement of β-galactosidase activity and luciferase activity using a system and protocol from Promega. Relative luciferase activity was normalized to the β-galactosidase activity to account for transfection efficiency. Triplicate wells were used for each experimental group. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA)—siRNA experiments were carried out as described previously (23Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8157) Google Scholar). The previously described siRNA oligonucleotides for CK1α and CK1ϵ together with plasmid DNAs were transfected into cells with LipofectAMINE (24Liu C. Li Y. Semenov M. Han C. Baeg G.H. Tan Y. Zhang Z. Lin X. He X. Cell. 2002; 108: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). To generate HEK293RXR and Jurkat cells with stable suppression of the expression of CK1α, the same sequences of double-strand DNA oligonucleotides were inserted into pSiren-RetroQ (BD Biosciences), and lines were created according to the manufacturer's protocols. Immunoprecipitation, Immunoblot Analysis, and Flow Cytometric Analysis—Immunoprecipitations were performed at 4 °C by incubating clarified cell extracts with the antibodies (2–5 μg/ml) and protein A/G-agarose beads for 4 h or overnight. Cell extracts or immunoprecipitates were subjected to separation on SDS-PAGE, transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and immunoblotted with specific antibodies. The targeted proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence immunodetection (Amersham Biosciences). DNA content analysis by fluorescence-activated cell sorter was performed on FACScan™ (BD Biosciences) as described (25Wang R. Shi Y.F. BioTechniques. 2002; 33: S88-S91Crossref Google Scholar). Protein Kinase Assay and Phosphoamino Acid Analysis—Kinase reactions were initiated by adding 2 μlof50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi) to the immunoprecipitated complexes that were suspended in 15 μl of kinase assay buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 10 mm MgCl2). Following incubation at 30 °C for 20 min, reactions were terminated by adding 6 μl of 4× SDS sample loading buffer, and mixtures were resolved onto SDS-PAGE. Incorporation of 32P into proteins was determined by autoradiography. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed on thin layer cellulose plates using the Hunter thin layer electrophoresis system as described (26Boyle W.J. van der Geer P. Hunter T. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 110-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). RXR Agonist Induces Growth Inhibition and Apoptosis in Cells that Overexpress RXRα—To examine the mechanism of action of RXR on cell growth and apoptosis, chicken B lymphoma DT40 and human T lymphoma Jurkat cells that stably overexpress the RXRα protein (DT40RXR and Jurkat RXR) were generated (Fig. 1a). These cells were dramatically more sensitive than parental cells to growth inhibition by the RXR agonist AGN194204 (Fig. 1b), and AGN194204 induced a significant level of apoptosis in these cells (Fig. 1c) but not in the parental cells (data not shown). Similarly, caspase-3 and -9 were activated by AGN194204 in a dose- and time-dependent manner in DT40RXR cells (Fig. 1d) and not in DT40 cells (data not shown). By contrast, H2O2 activated caspase-3 and -9 in both DT40RXR and DT40 cells (data not shown). Agonist-induced growth inhibition and caspase activation in DT40RXR cells both were blocked by the RXR antagonist AGN195393, and this agent had no effect by itself (Fig. 1e). These data show that both the RXR protein and its agonist are required for growth arrest and apoptosis in DT40 and Jurkat cells. RXRα Associates with a Protein Kinase in the Presence of RXR-specific Ligands—Studies using HEK293 cells revealed a protein kinase activity that co-immunoprecipitated with overexpressed FLAG-RXRα in an agonist-dependent manner and that phosphorylated RXRα and a 160-kDa protein in the same complex (Fig. 2a). Phosphorylation of RXRs in response to the activation of various pathways by extracellular stimuli has been described before (27Solomon C. White J.H. Kremer R. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 103: 1729-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 28Adam-Stitah S. Penna L. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol.

Kurie J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32193-32199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, the phosphorylation of RXR and the interaction between a protein kinase and RXR that is induced by RXR agonist have never been reported. Agonist treatment of cells recruited an activated kinase to the RXR complex rather than activating an already associated kinase, because RXR immunocomplexes from untreated HEK293 cells did not show kinase activity when treated subsequently with AGN194204 (data not shown). AGN194204 recruited the kinase in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, several other RXR agonists (but neither an RXR antagonist nor an RAR agonist (TTNPB)) recruited the kinase activity (data not shown). Also, cotransfection of HEK293 cells with RARα did not alter the specificity or efficacy of the AGN194204 response (Fig. 2c). Thus, the agonist-mediated recruitment of kinase activity is an RXR-driven response that is not mediated by classical RXR·RAR heterodimers. The RXR-associated Kinase Is Identified as CK1α—Phosphoamino acid analysis demonstrated that the co-immunoprecipitated kinase phosphorylates RXRα primarily on Ser residues (Fig. 3a). The kinase of interest appears to be constitutively active as inhibition or stimulation of several protein kinase cascades had no effect on the RXR-associated kinase activity (data not shown). The A/B domain of human RXRα contains 26 Ser residues, and analysis using a program from Protein Kinase Resources (University of California, San Diego) (30Smith C.M. Shindyalov I.N. Veretnik S. Gribskov M. Taylor S.S. Ten Eyck L.F. Bourne P.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 444-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) yielded many potential RXR kinases. CK1α was of particular interest because of its known constitutive activity (31Gross S.D. Anderson R.A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Indeed, immunoblot analysis demonstrated the presence of CK1α in the RXR immunoprecipitates from lysates of cells treated with AGN194204 but not in immunoprecipitates from untreated cells (Fig. 3b). By contrast, CK1ϵ, CK1δ, and CK2 were not detected in any of the immunoprecipitates, although they were clearly present in the cell lysates (data not shown). Several RXR deletion mutants were transfected into HEK293 cells, and the corresponding immunoprecipitates were examined for in vitro kinase activity and for the presence of CK1α (Fig. 3c). All of the immunoprecipitates that had kinase activity contained CK1α. Moreover, an intact ligand-binding region (E domain) is both essential and sufficient for interaction of RXR with CK1α, and only those RXR mutants with intact A/B domains were phosphorylated by the associated CK1α. To confirm that the RXR-associated kinase is CK1α, siRNA was used to significantly reduce the level of expression of CK1α in HEK293 cells without affecting levels of CK1ϵ and other proteins (RXRα and β-actin) (Fig. 3d). Reducing the level of CK1α dramatically reduced the RXR-associated kinase activity, whereas a reduction of the expression of CK1ϵ had no effect (Fig. 3d). Also, recombinant CK1 effectively phosphorylated RXRα in vitro even in the absence of AGN194204 (data not shown). These data indicate that the RXR agonist functions in vivo to recruit CK1α to the RXR complex. CK1α Is Not Required for Transcriptional Activities of RXR Homodimers or RXR·RAR Heterodimers—The transcriptional activity of certain hormone nuclear receptors and other transcription factors can be modulated by phosphorylation (32Rochette-Egly C.

We investigated whether changing the expression levels of CK1α affects the transcriptional activity of RXR. Increased or decreased expression of CK1α had no effect on either RXR agonist-induced transactivation of RXR homodimers or RAR agonist-induced transactivation of RXR·RAR heterodimers (Fig. 4). These data indicate that the direct transcriptional roles of RXR are independent of CK1α. Phosphorylation of RXR by activated c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases has also been reported to not affect the transcriptional functions of RXR (28Adam-Stitah S. Penna L. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18932-18941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Correlation of RXR Agonist-induced Growth Arrest and the Presence of CK1α Kinase Activity in RXR Immunoprecipitates—To provide insight into the biological consequence of RXR/CK1α interaction, we examined cell lines that had increased RXR expression. In some instances, these had enhanced sensitivity to RXR agonist-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis, whereas other RXR overexpressing cells were resistant (Fig. 5a). We investigated whether the association of RXR with CK1α governs RXR agonist-induced growth inhibition in these cell lines. RXR/CK1α interaction was measured using the in vitro kinase assay and by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 5c, RXR immunoprecipitates from the cells that were insensitive to inhibition of growth by RXR agonist (HEK293RXR and HeLaRXR) had kinase activity. Kinase activity was not immunoprecipitated with RXR in the AGN194204-sensitive cells (DT40RXR, JurkatRXR, and HircRXR) even though these cells expressed CK1α (Fig. 5b). These results imply that the RXR complex that mediates the growth inhibitory effects of RXR agonists is inactive in the presence of CK1α. Reducing the Level of CK1α in Cells Increases Efficacy of RXR Agonist-induced Cell Growth Inhibition and Apoptosis—We tested the possibility that RXR agonist-resistant cells may be rendered sensitive to growth inhibition by down-regulating the expression of CK1α. siRNA was used to reduce the expression of CK1α in HEK293RXR cells (Fig. 6a, left panel), and this led to a concomitant reduction in RXR-associated kinase activity (Fig. 6a, middle panel). Importantly, the cells with decreased levels of CK1α were then sensitive to growth inhibition by AGN194204 (Fig. 6a, right panel). Similarly, native Jurkat cells that do not overexpress RXR are insensitive to growth inhibition by AGN194204 and became sensitive when CK1α levels were decreased (Fig. 6b, first two panels). In addition, AGN194204 treatment of these CK1α-suppressed Jurkat cells resulted in the activation of caspases and the induction of apoptosis (Fig. 6b, last two panels). RXRs play key roles in regulation of gene transcription by forming heterodimers with many other ligand-activated nuclear receptors. There have also been suggestions that RXRs have novel physiological functions besides the regulation of gene transcription (15Katagiri Y. Takeda K. Yu Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Ozato K. Guroff G. Nat.

Casein kinase 1 was one of the first protein kinases discovered, yet its function and regulation remain poorly understood. CK1 represents a family of second messenger-independent Ser/Thr protein kinases. In mammals, CK1α, β, γ, δ, and ϵ have been identified and cloned, and each isoform appears to have different roles. CK1α is ubiquitously expressed, appears to be constitutively active (31Gross S.D. Anderson R.A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar), and has recently been identified as an essential component of the complex that controls β-catenin phosphorylation and degradation. Depletion of CK1α causes β-catenin protein accumulation in a manner similar to that caused by the lack of the functional tumor suppressor protein adenomotous polyposis coli (24Liu C. Li Y. Semenov M. Han C. Baeg G.H. Tan Y. Zhang Z. Lin X. He X. Cell. 2002; 108: 837-847Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1663) Google Scholar). We have clearly shown that RXR interacts in vivo with CK1α and that this interaction interferes with RXR agonist-driven inhibition of cell growth and induction of apoptosis. Interaction of CK1α with RXR does not affect the activity of RXR in regulation of gene transcription. Recently, Tanaka et al. (36Tanaka T. Dancheck B.L. Trifiletti L.C. Birnkrant R.E. Taylor B.J. Garfield S.H. Thorgeirsson U. De Luca L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 3972-3982Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) reported that in RXR agonist-unresponsive MDA-MB-231 cells, RXRα is located in interchromatin granule clusters and that forced nucleoplasmic expression of RXR renders these cells sensitive to induction of apoptosis by RXR agonist. These findings suggest that altered localization of RXRα coincides with loss of RXR agonist responsiveness. Interestingly, CK1α is also found in a multiprotein complex in interchromatin granule clusters (31Gross S.D. Anderson R.A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 699-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 37Gross S.D. Loijens J.C. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2647-2656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that RXR agonist-mediated apoptosis is regulated by a process of sequestration of phosphorylated RXR·CK1α into interchromatin granule clusters. It would be very interesting to investigate whether the phosphorylated RXR·CK1α complex is sequestered in interchromatin granule clusters. The exact molecular mechanisms by which RXR/CK1α interaction regulates cell growth and apoptosis are interesting subjects for future study. Importantly, our findings add new insights into the novel mechanisms of RXR action and are of significant therapeutic importance in that inhibiting CK1α function can enhance the anti-cancer activities of RXR agonists."

Knowledge of the detailed conformational states of gp120 is crucial to intervention, yet the unbound form is still resistant to structural characterization probably because of its flexibility. Toward this goal, we performed molecular dynamics simulations on the wild type gp120 core domain extracted from its ternary crystal structure and on a modeled mutant, S375W, that experimentally has a significantly different phenotype from the wild type. Although the mutant retained a bound-like conformation, the wild type drifted to a different conformational state. The wild type β strands 2 and 3 of the bridging sheet were very mobile and partially unfolded, and the organization among the inner and outer domains and β strands 20 and 21 of the bridging sheet, near the mutation site, was more open than in the bound form, although the overall structure was maintained. These differences were apparently a result of the strengthening of the hydrophobic core in the mutant. This stabilization further explains the experimentally significantly different thermodynamic properties between the wild type and the mutant. Taken together, our results suggest that the free form, although different from the bound state, shares many of the bound structural features. The observed loss of freedom near the binding site, rather than the previously hypothesized more dramatic conformational transition from the unbound to the bound state, appears to be the major contributor to the large entropy cost for the CD4 binding to the wild type. gp120 is key to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 viral cell entry.

The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 virus continues to be the main cause for AIDS infection affecting millions of people every year.

Analysis of the crystal structure revealed a peculiar three-dimensional organization within the core domain with a deeply recessed CD4 binding pocket shaped by the inner domain, the outer domain, and the bridging sheet. As Kwong et al. have argued (6Kwong P.D. Wyatt R. Robinson J. Sweet R.W. Sodroski J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 648-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (2492) Google Scholar), the hydrophobic core that holds together the three subdomains and sits at the bottom of the recessed pocket might be sensitive to a change in the environment because of the unique organization among the interacting residues. The flexibility of the association between the inner and outer domains is thought to be responsible for the low immunogenicity due to the spread of the epitope residues over separate regions (21Wyatt R. Kwong P.D. Desjardins E. Sweet R.W. Robinson J. Hendrickson W.A. Sodroski J.G. Nature. 1998; 393: 705-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). This highly flexible nature of the gp120 has necessarily made it difficult to characterize the detailed conformational features of the free form. Yet, such a characterization of the gp120 would be extremely valuable to the understanding of its biology and intervention, particularly the inhibition of the gp120-CD4 association, which is of primary interest yet has met only limited success (22McKnight A.

Of particular note is the thermodynamics data (see Table I) (25Myszka D.G. Sweet R.W. Hensley P. Brigham-Burke M. Kwong P.D. Hendrickson W.A. Wyatt R. Sodroski J. Doyle M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

This was further supported by the fact that the CD4 molecule shows little conformational change upon ligand binding (6Kwong P.D. Wyatt R. Robinson J. Sweet R.W. Sodroski J. Hendrickson W.A.

The similar thermodynamic behavior for both the full protein and the core domain of gp120 (see Table I) going from the free-form to the CD4-complexed state, confirms that it is the core domain that is largely responsible for the observed enthalpy and entropy changes. Accordingly, the unusual entropic cost has been interpreted to be the outcome of a large interdomain flexibility, including a loose contact between the inner and outer domains and the unfolded bridging sheet in the unbound state (6Kwong P.D.

Both the enthalpy change and the entropy penalty were significantly reduced for the CD4 binding (Table I). Furthermore, the S375W mutant binds CD4 tighter than the wild type, whereas the affinity to antibodies elicited against the CD4 binding site (CD4BS) 1The abbreviations used are: CD4BS, CD4 binding site; RMSD, root mean square distance.1The abbreviations used are: CD4BS, CD4 binding site; RMSD, root mean square distance. is almost totally abolished (7Xiang S.H.

Virol. 2002; 76: 9888-9899Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) rendering the possible changes in the organizations of the epitopes and the flexibility of the structure. The underlying factors that contribute to the different phenotypes are expected to reside in the structural and flexibility differences between the wild type and the mutant in free and bound forms. Prompted by the available crystal structure of the wild type core domain in complex with CD4 and an antibody (6Kwong P.D. Wyatt R. Robinson J. Sweet R.W. Sodroski J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 648-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (2492) Google Scholar), we aimed to characterize the conformations of the gp120 core domain in its free form. We are interested in its structural flexibility, the difference between the free and bound forms, and the effect of the mutation. Toward this goal, we performed molecular dynamics simulations on both the monomers and the CD4-bound complexes for the wild type and the S375W mutant. The detailed structural information from simulations allow us to address several important issues, such as whether there are multiple conformational states in the free form, what the conformational changes are, and how large they are, and how the constellation of the epitope residues changes upon mutation so as to significantly alter the neutralizing interactions. Answers to these questions can not only shed light on the structural biology of the gp120 but further assist in the identification of specific conformations for efficient drug design. Despite the extensive loop truncations in the crystal structure, its biological functions are largely intact, and we expect that information derived from such a reduced model should allow us to capture the structural properties of the core domain. Our results show that whereas the S375W mutant sampled a conformational space that is very close to the CD4-bound state, the wild type preferred a conformation with a very flexible bridging sheet and a relaxed association between the inner and outer domains. Although the findings here are in very good agreement with experimental data in general they further suggest that only the bridging sheet, particularly the β2 and β3 portion, is very mobile, whereas the flexibility between the inner and outer domains is relatively limited in the unbound state. All structural manipulations and molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the CHARMM program (37Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D. States D.J. Swaminathan S. Karplus M. J. Comput. Chem. 1983; 4: 187-217Crossref Scopus (13765) Google Scholar) with the CHARMM 22 force field (38MacKerell A Jr D. Bashford D. Bellott M. Dunbrack R. L. Jr. Evanseck J.D. Field M.J. Fischer S. Gao J.

The starting structures of the gp120 monomers and the gp120-CD4 complex were extracted from the ternary crystal structure (PDB 1g9m) (6Kwong P.D. Wyatt R. Robinson J. Sweet R.W. Sodroski J. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 648-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (2492) Google Scholar). Those with the S375W mutations were modeled from the wild type crystal structure using CHARMM. The missing loop 4 was also modeled in by first building the corresponding 14-residue peptide (the central 12 residues were missing) and subjecting it to molecular dynamics simulation at a temperature of 300 K in the gas phase with the distance between the Cα atoms of the terminal residues restrained to the desired target, which corresponds to 24.3 Å in the crystal structure. The resulting conformations with these matched distances were selected and integrated into the core domain by matching the terminal residues of the Cα of the peptide with the corresponding atoms in the protein. A structure with no van der Waals overlap between loop 4 and the core domain was selected and minimized for 500 steps of the steepest descent algorithm. For the monomer simulations, the gp120 core domain was first solvated in a TIP3P (39Jorgensen W.L. Chandrasekhar J. Madura J.D. Impey R.W. Klein M.L. J. Chem. Phys. 1983; 79: 926-935Crossref Scopus (28646) Google Scholar) water box with dimensions of ∼88 × 85 × 71 Å3, with a minimum distance of 10 Å from any edge of the box to any protein atom, resulting in a system size of ∼52,000 atoms. Minimizations were first performed for 500 steps with the steepest decent algorithm with the gp120 constrained and for additional 500 steps for the whole system. The systems were further pre-equilibrated for 20 ps with the NVT ensemble before the production simulations, which lasted for 3 ns each, with the NPT ensemble at 300 or 325 K. A time step of 2 fs and a force-switched nonbonded cutoff of 12 Å were used in the trajectory production, and structures were saved every 2 ps for analysis. For the complex simulations, the EEF1 implicit solvent model was used instead, and a total of 4-ns duration of the trajectories was generated with a time step of 1 fs and a group-based electrostatic calculation. Structural Deviation from the Bound State—The monomer core domain consists of the inner domain, outer domain, and the bridging sheet with its β-strands 20 and 21 folded against the inner-outer domain interface and β-strands 2 and 3 protruding out (Fig. 1). Such a unique monomer organization taken from the ternary complex structure was expected to undergo conformational changes to restore its unbound free form. Tables II and III summarize the core domain RMSD from all four simulations for the monomers. Over the 3-ns period at 300 K, the structural change was moderate with a Cα RMSD for the inner and the outer domains together (Table II) of 1.9 and 1.7 Å for the wild type and the mutant, respectively. When a portion of the bridging sheet, β20,21, was added, the RMSD was essentially unchanged (Table II). However, when the whole domain was included, the RMSD climbed to 2.6 Å for the wild type and only slightly changed for the mutant (Table II), indicating a larger movement of the β2,3 motif in the wild type than in the mutant. The RMSDs, however, did not show dramatic structural changes within each subdomain (inner and outer domains, β20,21 and β2,3). The results from the 325 K simulations were very similar to those from the 300 K simulations except that the difference between the wild type and the mutant was much smaller.Table IICα RMSD for structural motifs of the gp120 with each motif (by itself) aligned The three terminal residues and loop 4 were not included in the calculation, and averages were based on the last 2 ns of the trajectories.InnerOuterβ20,21β2,3Inner + outerInner + outer + β20,21Inner + outer + β2,3,20,21300KWT1.3 ± 0.11.8 ± 0.20.9 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.31.9 ± 0.12.0 ± 0.12.6 ± 0.3S375W1.1 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.11.8 ± 0.31.7 ± 0.11.7 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.1325KWT1.5 ± 0.11.6 ± 0.11.1 ± 0.22.0 ± 0.41.8 ± 0.21.9 ± 0.22.3 ± 0.3S375W1.6 ± 0.21.7 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.12.0 ± 0.41.9 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.12.3 ± 0.2 Open table in a new tab Table IIICα RMSD for structural motifs of gp120 with inner and outer domains aligned The three terminal residues and loop 4 were not included in the calculation, and averages were based on the last 2 ns of the trajectories.InnerOuterβ20,21β2,3300KWT1.8 ± 0.32.1 ± 0.23.0 ± 0.66.4 ± 1.4S375W1.4 ± 0.21.8 ± 0.11.9 ± 0.54.0 ± 0.9325KWT1.7 ± 0.21.8 ± 0.13.1 ± 0.95.8 ± 1.3S375W1.9 ± 0.21.9 ± 0.12.4 ± 0.44.8 ± 1.0 Open table in a new tab The difference in the structural deviations of the bridging sheet between the wild type and the mutant was further highlighted when the structures were aligned against the inner and outer domains (Table III). At both 300 and 325 K, the RMSD difference between the wild type and the mutant is much larger for the β2,3 and β20,21, whereas it is similar for the inner and the outer domains. These results indicate that the S375W mutation appears to stabilize the bridging sheet from drifting away from the inner and outer domains, which in turn shows that the bridging sheet is the most mobile region of the core domain for the wild type. Analysis of Interdomain Motions—Above, our results have indicated that the bridging sheet, especially the β2,3 motif, was the most mobile in the core domain of the wild type. To detect additional potential motions between the inner and outer domains, two selected distances between the inner and the outer domains were measured. One distance is between the Cαs of residue 231 and 360, and the other is between the Cα of residue 375 and the nearest heavy atom of residue 112 (Figs. 1B, and 2). Residues 231 and 360 are located at the centers of the well structured β sheets, and the distance between them was expected to be a good measure for the opening-closing motions between the inner and outer domains. Residues 112 and 375 were selected to monitor similar motions between the inner and outer domains. These residues are located at the narrower region of the heart-shaped inner domain-outer domain configuration (Fig. 1B). Because residue 375 was the mutation site in the S375W mutant, the mutational effect on the local conformations is also of interest. The distance between residues 231 and 360 fluctuated between 39.5 and 40.5 Å for the wild type at 300 K (Fig. 2A). Compared with that in the crystal structure (39.5 Å), the expansion was very mild considering the thermal effect on the structure. The mutant behaved similarly. To increase the sampled conformational space, simulations were also performed at elevated temperature (325 K). However, no significant difference was observed for either the wild type or the mutant (Fig. 2A). Thus, it seems that the motions between the domains were quite limited by this measure. The distance between residues 112 and 375 also increased for the wild type at 300 K (Fig. 2B). Starting from 9.4 Å in the bound state, it fluctuated between 10 and 12 Å after 1 ns of the simulation. Such a magnitude of fluctuation is more significant compared with the fluctuation for the distance between residues 231 and 360, indicating that this part of the structure might be more flexible and relatively more open in the free form. Interestingly, this distance for the mutant did not change as much and was consistently shorter than in the wild type (Fig. 2B). Such a difference between the wild type and the mutant was more significant when measured at 325 K (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that the effect of the S375W mutation was the stabilization of the bound-state association between the inner domain and the outer domain, consistent with the assertion based on the experimental observations (7Xiang S.H. Kwong P.D. Gupta R. Rizzuto C.D. Casper D.J. Wyatt R. Wang L. Hendrickson W.A. Doyle M.L. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 9888-9899Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). To examine the conformational changes of the gp120 observed by molecular dynamics from a different perspective, we performed a normal mode analysis on both the monomer and the gp120-CD4 dimer with a method developed by Keskin et al. (40Keskin O. Durell S.R. Bahar I. Jernigan R.L. Covell D.G. Biophys. J. 2002; 83: 663-680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This normal mode analysis method uses a coarse-grained model of the system and focuses on the lowest frequency modes. Results from the monomer analysis show that two of the three lowest frequency modes correspond to the β2,3 motif of the bridging sheet (Fig. 3, A and B), and the third lowest frequency mode involves the β4,5 motif (Fig. 3C). In addition, the magnitudes of two modes for β2,3 were significantly larger than the rest of the vibration modes. On the other hand, the magnitudes of these two motions were significantly reduced to a level that was comparable with the rest of the small amplitude motions in the gp120-CD4 dimer complex form (data not shown). This result agrees with our simulation, confirming that β2,3 is indeed the most flexible and might experience a large conformational change during the CD4 binding process. S375W Mutation Reduces the Flexibility of gp120—The S375W mutation was designed to fill the partially occupied CD4 binding pocket (7Xiang S.H. Kwong P.D. Gupta R. Rizzuto C.D. Casper D.J. Wyatt R.

Because the mutation site is at the bottom of the CD4 binding pocket, and the pocket is surrounded by several hydrophobic/aromatic residues, this mutation was likely to perturb these interactions in its vicinity. Fig. 4 shows the constellations of the hydrophobic and aromatic residues near the mutation site in the average structures from the 300 K simulations (Fig. 4, A and B) and snapshots fr"

However, when neutrophils degranulate, these proteinases are released and can cause irreparable damage by degrading host connective tissue proteins. Despite abundant endogenous inhibitors, these proteinases are protected from inhibition because of their ability to bind to anionic surfaces. Plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), which is not an inhibitor of these proteinases, possesses properties that could make it an effective inhibitor of neutrophil proteinases if its specificity could be redirected. PAI-1 efficiently inhibits surface-sequestered proteinases, and it efficiently mediates rapid cellular clearance of PAI-1-proteinase complexes. Therefore, we examined whether PAI-1 could be engineered to inhibit and clear neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G. By introducing specific mutations in the reactive center loop of wild-type PAI-1, we generated PAI-1 mutants that are effective inhibitors of both proteinases. Kinetic analysis shows that the inhibition of neutrophil proteinases by these PAI-1 mutants is not affected by the sequestration of neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G onto surfaces. In addition, complexes of these proteinases and PAI-1 mutants are endocytosed and degraded by lung epithelial cells more efficiently than either the neutrophil proteinases alone or in complex with their physiological inhibitors, α1-proteinase inhibitor and α -antichymotrypsin.

Neutrophils are the first defensive cells to extravasate from the circulation into infected areas where their primary role is to ingest foreign particles and eliminate them by using an arsenal of bactericidal, hydrolytic, and oxidative agents (1Linzmeier R. Michaelson D. Liu L. Ganz T. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 2Bullen J.J. Armstrong J.A. Immunology. 1979; 36: 781-791PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hampton M.B.

The direct action of neutrophils is temporary because they degranulate soon after reaching the affected area, but their intracellular proteinases can have a lasting effect. In many chronic inflammatory disorders where there is a persistent influx and degranulation of neutrophils, their proteinases can overwhelm endogenous proteinase inhibitors, cause tissue degradation, and augment the inflammatory response. The broad substrate specificities of neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G are similar to the digestive proteinases, pancreatic elastase and chymotrypsin, respectively. Like their pancreatic counterparts, the neutrophil proteinases can degrade most proteins, including cross-linked extracellular matrix proteins such as collagens and elastin. In addition to degrading extracellular matrix proteins, these neutrophil proteinases can also intensify the host inflammatory response by both proteolytic and non-proteolytic mechanisms (4Si-Tahar M.

Lancet. 1989; : 1179-1182Abstract PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). The activities of neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G are primarily regulated by the serine proteinase inhibitors (serpins), 1The abbreviations used are: α1PI, α-1 proteinase inhibitor; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1; α1ACT, α-1-antichymotrypsin; LRP, low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein; PAI-1AV, PAI-1V343A A346V; PAI-1F, PAI-1R346F; PAI-1A, PAI-1R346A; fMLF, formyl-Met-Leu-Phe; RAP, receptor-related protein; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl-fluoride; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; LDL, low density lipoprotein; NE, neutrophil elastase; serpin; RCL, reactive center loop. α1-proteinase inhibitor (α1PI, also called α1antitrypsin) and α1-antichymotrypsin (α1ACT), respectively. These inhibitors are abundant plasma proteins, present in the circulation at high concentrations (8Forsyth S. Horvath A. Coughlin P. Genomics. 2003; 81: 336-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The importance of these inhibitors in regulating neutrophil proteinase activity in extravascular tissues has been demonstrated in individuals with α1PI deficiency who are more likely to develop early onset emphysema because of degradation of lung elastin (9Birrer P. Respiration. 1995; 62: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 10Coakley R.J. Taggart C. O'Neill S. McElvaney N.G. Am. J. Med. Sci. 2001; 321: 33-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G are very basic proteins (pI ≥8.5) that bind negatively charged molecules like DNA and heparin with high affinity. Their binding to these anionic surfaces limits the accessibility of their active site to both small substrates and serpins. α1PI and α1ACT are very effective inhibitors of neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G in solution phase, but efficiency is greatly reduced in the presence of these surfaces. The reason for this is thought to be because of the phase separation of neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G from α1PI and α1ACT due to the inability of the inhibitors to bind these surfaces. Partitioning of these proteinases from their endogenous inhibitors could explain the tissue damage associated with many chronic inflammatory disorders because they are protected from inhibitors by anionic macromolecules present in cell debris (11Ermolieff J. Boudier C. Laine A. Meyer B. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29502-29508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Duranton J. Boudier C. Belorgey D. Mellet P. Bieth J.G. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Unlike α1PI and α1ACT, which are efficient inhibitors of proteinases in solution phase, other serpins are efficient inhibitors of their target proteinases when they are bound to a surface. A classic example is antithrombin-III, whose rate of inhibition is enhanced by heparin (14Jordan R.E. Oosta G.M. Gardner W.T. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 10081-10090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Another serpin that is able to inhibit proteinases bound to surfaces is plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1), which is the principal inhibitor of the plasminogen activators (PAs), urokinase-type plasminogen activator and tissue-type plasminogen activator in vivo (15Fay W.P.

Both PAs bind to a variety of surfaces, including cellular receptors, fibrin, and heparin. Surface binding, however, does not protect them from inhibition by PAI-1 (17Keijer J. Linders M. Wegman J.J.

Besides the ability of PAI-1 to inhibit PAs bound to receptors and surfaces, PAI-1 is able to mediate rapid cellular clearance of the target proteinase. Upon complex formation with a proteinase, PAI-1 undergoes a rapid conformational change that increases its affinity for the clearance receptors of the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family. These include the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP), the very low density lipoprotein receptor, and Megalin (21Stefansson S. Kounnas M.Z. Henkin J. Mallampalli R.K. Chappell D.A. Strickland D.K.

We previously showed that the high affinity binding of PAI-1-proteinase complexes to LRP was independent of the proteinase but was mediated through a cryptic site on PAI-1 that is exposed when it is in a covalent complex with a proteinase. Furthermore, this enhanced clearance was significantly more efficient compared with clearance of proteinases, such as thrombin, in complex with other serpins, including antithrombin-III, α1PI, and heparin cofactor-II (22Stefansson S. Muhammad S. Cheng X.F. Battey F.D. Strickland D.K. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6358-6366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, PAI-1 not only inhibits proteinases but also specifically promotes their clearance. In this study we have taken advantage of these innate properties of PAI-1, which normally is cleaved by these proteinases, and designed mutations in the reactive center loop (RCL) of PAI-1, which converts it to an efficient inhibitor of either pancreatic elastase or chymotrypsin or of the neutrophil proteinases, neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G. The efficiency of these PAI-1 mutants is not adversely affected by surfaces such as heparin or DNA, and they are markedly more efficient at promoting the cellular clearance and degradation of neutrophil proteinases compared with their natural serpin inhibitors. Together, these properties make the PAI-1 mutants more effective in vivo than their endogenous inhibitors at reducing the neutrophil proteinase concentrations in a model of lung inflammation. Proteins and Reagents—Active human neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and α1-antichymotrypsin were purchased from Athens Biochemicals (Athens, GA). Chromogenic substrates N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (for cathepsin G and chymotrypsin), N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-p-nitroanilide (for neutrophil elastase), N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-p-nitroanilide (for pancreatic elastase), bovine serum albumin, bovine chymotrypsin, hexadecyl-trimethyl ammonium bromide, endotoxin, formyl-Met-Leu-Phe (fMLF), and heparin were purchased from Sigma.

Heparin-Sepharose, phenyl-Sepharose, and PD-10 prepacked gel filtration columns were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Na125I and 125I Bolton-Hunter reagent were purchased from Amersham Biosciences and ICN (Irvine, CA), respectively. Preparation of PAI-1 Mutant Inhibitors of Neutrophil Proteinases—A preferred method for producing PAI-1 mutants utilizes the commercially available Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) (22Stefansson S.

This kit uses a mismatched primer form of mutagenesis and is compatible with double stranded plasmid DNA. Thus the mutants can be constructed directly onto existing expression plasmids. The PAI-1A346V-V343A and PAI-1R346F mutants were made using the oligonucleotides (5′-CATAGCCTCAGCCGTCATGGCCCCCGAG-3′ and 5′-CATAGTCTCAGCCTTCATGGCCCCCGAGGAG-3′, respectively). These PAI-1 mutants were expressed and purified as described (24Lawrence D. Strandberg L. Grundström T. Ny T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and isolated and purified as described by Kvassman and Shore (25Kvassman J.-O. Shore J.D. Fibrinolysis. 1995; 9: 215-221Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Preparations with significant endotoxin levels as determined by coagulase kit (Bio-Whittacker, Walkersville, MD) following the phenyl-Sepharose step were further purified by either additional passes through phenyl-Sepharose or Detoxi-Gel (Pierce) until endotoxin levels were at or below 10 units/mg. Biacore Analysis of the Binding of the Proteinases, Inhibitors, and Their Complexes to LRP—Affinities of pancreatic elastase, neutrophil elastase, chymotrypsin, and cathepsin G for LRP either in complex with α1PI, α1ACT, PMSF, or PAI-1 mutants were measured by surface plasmon resonance using a BIA 3000 optical biosensor (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Purified human LRP was immobilized at the level of 3000 response units. Remaining binding sites were blocked by 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5, and unbound proteins were washed out with 0.5% SDS. A flow cell with immobilized ovalbumin at the level of 500 response units was used as a control for nonspecific protein binding. All binding reactions were performed in standard HBS-P buffer, pH 7.4, containing 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.005% Tween 20. Binding of proteases, inhibitors, and their complexes to LRP was measured at 25 °C at a flow rate of 30 μl/min for 4 min, followed by 4 min of dissociation. Chip surfaces were regenerated with subsequent 1-min pulses of 1 m NaCl, pH 4.0, and 1 m NaCl containing 10 mm NaOH, followed by 2 min of washing with HBS-P. Binding of proteinases, inhibitors, and proteinase-inhibitor complexes was measured using a range of concentrations (10–0.15-nm). Collected data were analyzed with BIA evaluation 3.0 software (Biacore) using global analysis to fit a 1:1 Langmuire binding model with mass transfer limitation. Cellular Endocytosis and Degradation Assays of Proteinases—A rat pretype-II pneumocyte cell line (T-II) was a generous gift from Dr. R. K. Mallampalli (University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City, IA) (26Mallampalli R.K. Floerchinger C.S. Hunninghake G.W. In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. 1992; 28A: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT) containing penicillin and streptomycin. For endocytosis and degradation studies, T-II cells were seeded onto 12-well plates, (1–3 × 105 cells/well) coated with 0.1% gelatin and allowed to adhere for 18 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% bovine calf serum. Before addition of radiolabeled proteinases, cells were washed twice using serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated for 30 min in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin before addition of either preformed 125I-labeled proteinase-inhibitor complexes or 125I-labeled proteinases. Where indicated, RAP (1 μm) was added prior to the 125I proteinase-inhibitor complexes. Quantitation of the endocytosed and degraded ligand was done as described (27Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8215-8220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cellular degradation of the 125I-labeled proteinases was determined by removing the medium and precipitating it using 10% trichloroacetic acid and 5% phosphotungstic acid (final concentration). Acid-soluble radioactivity was taken to represent degraded ligands. For quantitation of endocytosis, cell layers were washed twice with serum-free medium and incubated in serum-free medium containing trypsin and proteinase K (0.5 mg/ml) and 0.5 mm EDTA for 2–5 min at 4 °C. The cells were then centrifuged at 6000 × g for 2 min, and the radioactivity in the cell pellet was taken to represent the amount of endocytosed ligand. To evaluate the effects of α1PI and PAI-1AV on the endocytosis and degradation of exogenously added 125I elastase, cells were grown in medium containing 10% serum as described above. Washed monolayers were then incubated with 125I elastase (10 nm) for 30 min, after which increasing concentrations of either α1PI or PAI-1AV were added and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C to determine endocytosis or 18 h for to determine degradation. Kinetics of Proteinase Inhibition by α1PI, α1ACT, and PAI-1 Mutants—Before measuring the second order rate constant for the inhibition of the neutrophil proteinases, the stoichiometry of the inhibitor as a proteinase substrate to a proteinase inhibitor (SI value) was determined. Briefly, a constant concentration of the neutrophil proteinases was incubated with an increasing concentration of the proteinase inhibitors in the presence or absence of heparin or DNA. After 30 min the appropriate chromogenic proteinase substrate was added to the reaction mixture, and the proteinase activity was measured. The results were plotted as activity of the proteinase versus the inhibitor concentration divided by the enzyme concentration. The intercept on the x-axis is therefore an indicator of whether the inhibitor inhibits in a 1:1 molar ratio or whether higher concentrations of the inhibitors are required. Two methods were used to obtain kinetic parameters for the inhibition of the proteinases. For slow reactions (ki < 105), the PAI-1 mutants will be assumed to inhibit target proteinases by the two-step inhibitory mechanism first described for irreversible inhibitors by Kitz and Wilson (28Kitz R. Wilson I.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1962; 237: 3245-3249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Hastings et al. (29Hastings G.A. Coleman T.A. Haudenschild C.C. Stefansson S. Smith E.P. Barthlow R. Cherry S. Sandkvist M. Lawrence D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33062-33067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). For fast reactions between the proteinases and the inhibitors (ki >105), the scheme described in Lawrence et al. (24Lawrence D. Strandberg L. Grundström T. Ny T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 186: 523-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) was used. The effects of heparin and DNA on the kinetics of inhibition were determined in the presence of either 0.1 mg/ml heparin or 0.1 mg/ml DNA. In Vivo Lung Inflammation Assay—In vivo lung inflammation assays were performed essentially as described (31Eyles J.E. Williamson E.D. Alpar H.O. Int. J. Pharm. 1999; 189: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), with some modifications. Briefly, male C57BL/6J mice (age 8–12 weeks) under anesthesia were intranasally instilled with either PBS or a mixture of endotoxin and fMLF, 100 and 50 μg, respectively, in a total volume of 150 μl in PBS. PAI-1AV and PAI-1F mutants, 50 μg/25 μg, respectively, or α1AP/α1ACT, 50 μg/25 μg, respectively, in a total volume of 150 μl in PBS were administered along with the endotoxin/fMLF instillation mixture. Additionally, PAI-1AV/PAI-1F, 100 μg/25 μg, respectively, or α1AP/α1ACT, 100 μg/25 μg, respectively, in a total volume of 150 μl or PBS were injected intraperitonally to both PBS- and endotoxin/fMLF-treated mice immediately following nasal instillation and again 16–17 h postinstillation. At 24–26 h postinstillation, animals were anesthetized and perfused with PBS. Lungs were then excised, washed briefly with 0.3% hexadecyl-trimethyl ammonium bromide in Tris-buffered saline, and stored on dry ice, followed by homogenization in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.3% hexadecyl-trimethyl ammonium bromide, followed by centrifugation to remove particulates. Neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G activities were measured in the lung homogenates using the chromogenic substrates described above. The effectiveness of the inhibitors as assessed by the neutrophil proteinase load in the lungs was determined by subtracting the activities of animals treated intranasally with PBS from the endotoxin/fMLF-treated animals, with or without added proteinase inhibitors.

Generation and Characterization of PAI-1 Mutants That Inhibit Pancreatic and Neutrophil Proteinases—Serpins act as “suicide inhibitors” because when a proteinase cleaves a serpin at a site within the RCL, termed the scissile bond (P1-P1′), it traps the proteinase in a non-reversible covalent complex (32Huntington J.A. Pannu N.S. Hazes B. Read R.J. Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 33Lawrence D.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 339-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In many cases the amino acid composition of the serpin scissile bond reflects the substrate specificity of the target proteinase. The scissile bond of wild-type PAI-1 is Arg-346-Met-347, which enables it to inhibit many serine proteinases with trypsin-like specificities, but kinetic analysis showed that it is the most effective inhibitor of both PAs (34Hekman C.M. Loskutoff D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 262: 199-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Because PAI-1 is an efficient inhibitor of its target proteinases both in solution and in solid phase (17Keijer J. Linders M. Wegman J.J. Ehrlich H.J. Mertens K. Pannekoek H. Blood. 1991; 78: 1254-1261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Cubellis M.V. Andreasen P. Ragno P. Mayer M. Dano K. Blasi F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1991; 266: 7488-7493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and because it is very efficient at promoting their cellular clearance, (27Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Argraves W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8215-8220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we wanted to determine whether we could redirect PAI-1 specificity toward neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G, which wt PAI-1 does not inhibit, (35Wu K. Urano T. Ihara H. Takada Y. Fujie M. Shikimori M. Hashimoto K. Takada A. Blood. 1995; 86: 1056-1061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Iacoviello L. Kolpakov V. Salvatore L. Amore C. Pintucci G. de Gaetano G. Donati M.B. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1995; 15: 2037-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and still retain these properties. Mutations in a serpin scissile bond have been shown to redirect it to target another proteinase (37Owen M.C. Brennan S.O. Lewis J.H. Carrell R.W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1983; 309: 694-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Therefore we tested whether a PAI-1 mutant with the P1 Arg-346 residue changed to an alanine (PAI-1R346A, referred herein as PAI-1A) (38Sherman P.M. Lawrence D.A. Yang A.Y. Vandenberg E.T. Paielli D. Olson S.T. Shore J.D. Ginsburg D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7588-7595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), could inhibit pancreatic elastase, which prefers Ala as the P1 residue. The PAI-1A has no inhibitory activity against urokinase-type plasminogen activator (data not shown) but retained the ability to bind vitronectin with affinity, equal to wild-type PAI-1 (39Stefansson S. Lawrence D.A. Nature. 1996; 383: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). The rate of inhibition (ki) of pancreatic elastase by PAIA is 4.6 × 105m–1 s–1, which is comparable with the rate obtained by Laurent and Bieth (40Laurent P. Bieth J.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 994: 285-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) for α1PI (4.7 × 105m–1 s–1). These results demonstrate that the specificity of PAI-1 can be redirected toward pancreatic elastase with a rate of inhibition similar to α1PI. To target serine proteinases with chymotrypsin-like specificities, a second PAI-1 mutant was generated with a phenylalanine at the P1 position (PAI-1R346F, referred herein as PAI-1F). This mutant was tested against chymotrypsin, and the rate of inhibition of PAI-1F was 6.1 × 104m–1 s–1 compared with 8.1 × 105m–1 s–1 for α1ACT reported by Rubin et al. (41Rubin H. Wang Z.M. Nickbarg E.B. McLarney S. Naidoo N. Schoenberger O.L. Johnson J.L. Cooperman B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results reported above demonstrate that the proteinase specificity of PAI-1 can be easily redirected by changing the amino acid composition of the P1 residue without a substantial loss in the rate of inhibition in solution phase. Therefore, these PAI-1 mutants were tested for their ability to inhibit other serine proteinases with similar specificity, specifically neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G. Kinetic analysis of PAI-1A inhibition of neutrophil elastase yielded a ki of 1.4 × 103m–1 s–1, which is about 300-fold less than the rate of inhibition of pancreatic elastase by PAI-1A (ki = 4.6 × 105m–1 s–1) and is ∼10,000 fold less than α1PI inhibition of neutrophil elastase (ki = 1.3 × 107m–1 s–1). The decrease in the ability of PAI-1A to inhibit neutrophil elastase was surprising because it efficiently inhibited pancreatic elastase with a rate equal to that of α1PI. This discrepancy could be because of the preference of neutrophil elastase for valine over alanine as the P1 residue or because the proteinase was cleaving the RCL at another site than the P1-P1′, rendering it inactive as was demonstrated for wtPAI-1 (35Wu K. Urano T. Ihara H. Takada Y. Fujie M. Shikimori M. Hashimoto K. Takada A. Blood. 1995; 86: 1056-1061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the reaction mixture of PAI-1A with neutrophil elastase showed that PAI-1A was being cleaved at both the Val-343-Ser-344 position (P3-P4) and at Ala-346-Met-347 (P1-P1′, data not shown), indicating that the inefficiency of PAI-1A might be due in part to this non-productive cleavage at Val-343-Ser-344, coupled with the P1 alanine being a suboptimal residue for neutrophil elastase. Therefore, to improve PAI-1A as an inhibitor of neutrophil elastase, the Val-343 residue was replaced with alanine and the Ala-346 was replaced with valine. The resulting mutant, PAI-1V343A A346V (referred herein as PAI-1AV), has the non-productive Val-343 cleavage site changed to alanine, which is a suboptimal cleavage site for neutrophil elastase, and the alanine at the P1 position changed to valine, which is preferred by neutrophil elastase as demonstrated by small peptide substrates (43Koehl C. Knight C.G. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12609-12612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Valine was also chosen as the P1 residue because studies by Shubeita et al. (44Shubeita H.E. Cottey T.L. Franke A.E. Gerard R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18379-18385Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that replacing the P1-P1′ residues of wt-PAI-1 with those of α1PI (Met-Ser) did not convert PAI-1 into an inhibitor of elastase or trypsin. Additionally, the PAI-1AV mutant does not alter the length of the PAI-1 RCL, whic"
https://openalex.org/W2097868969,"The Cdc14 family of protein phosphatases is conserved within eukaryotes and antagonizes the action of cyclin-dependent kinases, thereby promoting mitotic exit and cytokinesis. We performed a detailed kinetic and mechanistic study of the Cdc14 phosphatases with both small molecule aryl phosphates and a physiological protein substrate hCdh1. We found that Cdc14 displays a strong preference for two-ringed aryl phosphates over smaller one-ringed or larger, multi-ringed substrates, a finding that may have important implications for inhibitor design. Results from both leaving group and pH dependence of the Cdc14-catalyzed reaction are consistent with a general acid-independent mechanism for substrates with leaving group pKa < 7 and a general acid-dependent mechanism for substrates with leaving group pKa > 7. The use of both low and high leaving group pKa substrates, in combination with steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic techniques enabled the isolation and analysis of both the phosphoenzyme (E-P) formation and hydrolysis step. We established the requirement of general acid catalysis for E-P formation in reactions with high leaving group pKa substrates, and the presence of general base catalysis in E-P hydrolysis. Mutational study of invariant acidic residues in Cdc14 identified Asp253 as the general acid during E-P formation and the general base in E-P hydrolysis. We also identified several residues including Asp50, Asp129, Glu168, Glu171, and Asp177 in the Cdc14 active site cleft that are required for efficient dephosphorylation of hCdh1.

Cdc14 is a protein phosphatase conserved from yeast to man (1Taylor G.S. Liu Y. Baskerville C. Charbonneau H. J. Biol.

In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cdc14 is essential for cell cycle progression from late anaphase into G1 of the subsequent cell cycle, a process referred to as exit from mitosis (3Cerutti L. Simanis V. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 65-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 4Morgan D.O. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E47-E53Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 5Zachariae W.

For example, Cdc14 dephosphorylates and stabilizes the mitotic CDK inhibitor Sic1, up-regulates Sic1 expression by dephosphorylating the transcription factor Swi5, and induces degradation of mitotic cyclins by dephosphorylating and activating the anaphase promoting complex (APC) regulatory protein Cdh1/Hct1 (6Visintin R. Craig K. Hwang E.S. Prinz S. Tyers M. Amon A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 709-718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies also suggest that human Cdc14 homologs can dephosphorylate products of CDKs, such as hCdh1 (7Bembenek J. Yu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48237-48242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), cyclin E (8Furstenthal L. Kaiser B.K. Swanson C. Jackson P.K. J.

Chem. 2000; 275: 2410-2414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Despite their structural similarities, the biological function of Cdc14 phosphatases may vary between species. Thus, in S. cerevisiae, Cdc14 is absolutely required for mitotic exit. In contrast, the Cdc14 homolog Clp1/Flp1 is not required for mitotic exit in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, but rather is mainly involved in regulating cytokinesis and affects the timing of entry into mitosis (10Trautmann S. Wolfe B.A. Jorgensen P. Tyers M. Gould K.L. McCollum D. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 931-940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 11Cueille N. Salimova E. Esteban V. Blanco M. Moreno S. Bueno A. Simanis V. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2649-2664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, CeCdc14 phosphatase is required for cytokinesis in the Caenorhabditis elegans embryo (12Gruneberg U. Glotzer M. Gartner A. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 158: 901-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The functional roles for the two human Cdc14 homologs, hCdc14A and hCdc14B, have not been fully defined, though depletion of hCdc14A by RNAi causes a variety of mitotic defects, including cytokinesis failure (13Mailand N. Lukas C. Kaiser B.K. Jackson P.K. Bartek J. Lukas J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). It is possible that Cdc14 phosphatases may antagonize CDK activity by dephosphorylation of different substrates and regulate distinct cell-cycle transitions in different species, as CDK activity is important for many different cell cycle processes (14Trautmann S. McCollum D. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: R733-R735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although the role of the Cdc14 phosphatase in cell cycle has been studied extensively, relatively little is known about its catalytic mechanism. Given their critical roles in mitotic exit and cytokinesis, the Cdc14 phosphatases have been implicated as potential therapeutic targets for anticancer drug development. Thus it is important to define Cdc14 active site substrate specificity and identify residues that are essential for Cdc14 catalysis. Interestingly, the Cdc14 phosphatases contain the active site sequence CX5R, which is a hallmark for the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) superfamily. The PTPs are a diverse family of enzymes that includes tyrosine-specific, dual specificity, Cdc25, as well as low molecular weight phosphatases (15Wang W.-Q. Sun J.-P. Zhang Z.-Y. Curr. Topics Med. Chem. 2003; 3: 739-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Detailed enzymological studies suggest that the PTPs employ a conserved two-step mechanism (16Zhang Z.-Y. Prog. Nuc. Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 73: 171-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), shown in Scheme 1, in which E is the enzyme, ArOPO32−, the substrate, E⋅ArOPO32−, the enzyme-substrate Michaelis complex, E-P, the phosphoenzyme intermediate, and ArOH, the leaving group phenol. In this mechanism, the side chain of the active site Cys residue serves as a nucleophile to accept the phosphoryl group from the substrate to form E-P. The active site Arg makes bidentate hydrogen bonds with the phosphoryl group in the substrate through its guanidinium group and plays an important role in both substrate binding and transition state stabilization during catalysis. To facilitate substrate turnover, PTPs also utilize an Asp residue, which acts as a general acid by protonating the ester oxygen of the leaving group, thus greatly enhancing the rate of E-P formation. In the second step, E-P hydrolysis occurs by the attack of a nucleophilic water molecule assisted by the same Asp, functioning as a general base, with subsequent release of the free enzyme and inorganic phosphate. Aside from the conserved active site CX5R motif, there are little sequence similarities between Cdc14 and other members of the PTP superfamily. Consequently, it is not known whether other residues also participate in Cdc14 catalysis. This is in contrast to other PTPs for which a number of conserved, catalytically important residues have been identified and characterized (16Zhang Z.-Y. Prog. Nuc. Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 73: 171-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In the following, we describe a kinetic investigation of Cdc14 substrate specificity with both small molecule aryl phosphates and a physiological protein substrate hCdh1. We also describe results from site-directed mutagenesis experiments in combination with steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic analyses that lead to the identification of several catalytically important residues including the general acid/base in Cdc14 catalysis. Materials—p-Nitrophenyl phosphate (pNPP) was purchased from Fluka. Phenyl phosphate, 4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (MUP), β-naphthyl phosphate, and 3-O-methylfluorescein phosphate (OMFP) were obtained from Sigma. 6,8-Difluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (DiFMUP) was purchased from Molecular Probes. 2-Chloro-4-nitrophenyl phosphate, 4-cyanophenyl phosphate, 4-trifluoromethylphenyl phosphate, and 4-chlorophenyl phosphate were synthesized as described (17Zhang Z.-Y. Van Etten R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1516-1525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 8-Fluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (8-FMUP), 6-fluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (6-FMUP), and 5-fluoro-4-methylumbelliferyl phosphate (5-FMUP) were prepared as described (18Gee K.R.

Expression and Purification of Cdc14 and Mutant Proteins—The cDNA for budding yeast Cdc14 was subcloned into vector pET-15b. The Cdc14 mutants were obtained using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The sequences of the wild-type and mutant Cdc14s were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Wild-type and mutant Cdc14s were transformed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells and induced by 0.3 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at room temperature for 20 h. The His6-tagged proteins were purified by Ni-NTA resin based upon the procedure described by Qiagen. Proteins were judged to be at least 90% pure by SDS-PAGE. Steady-state Kinetics—All assays with small molecule substrates were performed at 30 °C. The following buffers were used: 50 mm succinate (pH 5.0 ∼6.0), 50 mm 3,3-dimethyl glutarate (pH 6.0 ∼7.2), and 100 mm Tricine (pH 7.2 ∼ 9.0). In addition, each buffer also contained 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol and was adjusted to an ionic strength of 150 mm with sodium chloride. To ensure initial rate conditions, the product versus time progress curves were routinely checked for linearity at different substrate and enzyme concentrations. In all cases, the enzyme concentration was at least 100-fold lower than that of the substrate, and the quantity of substrate consumed was less than 10% of the initial value, so that the steady-state assumption was fulfilled. There was no product inhibition under these conditions. For substrates 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl phosphate and pNPP, assay mixtures of 200 μl in total volume were set up in 1.1-ml polypropylene tubes from Marsh Biomedical. Reactions were started by the addition of an appropriate amount of Cdc14. The reaction mixtures were quenched with 50 μl of 5 m sodium hydroxide, and the absorbance at 405 nm was read using a plate reader. For substrates 5-FMUP, 8-FMUP, 6-FMUP, MUP, β-naphthyl phosphate, 4-cyanophenyl phosphate, 4-trifluoromethylphenyl phosphate, 4-chlorophenyl phosphate, phenyl phosphate, the reaction mixtures were quenched with 10% trichloroacetic acid, and the amount of inorganic phosphate released was quantitated based on the method of Black and Jones (19Black M.J. Jones M.E. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 135: 233-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). For the substrates 6,8-DiFMUP, 5-FMUP, 8-FMUP, 6-FMUP, MUP, continuous assays were performed. The reaction (1-ml total volume) was set up in a 1-ml quartz cuvette. The fluorescence of the product was monitored by a PerkinElmer Life Sciences 50B Luminescence spectrometer. When the substrate concentrations were well below the Km, the kcat/Km values were obtained from a linear least square fit of the plot of initial rate versus substrate concentration using Equation 1,υ=(kcat/Km)[E]o[S](Eq. 1) where v represents the initial rate and [E]o is the total enzyme concentration. In continuous assays, the kcat/Km values were obtained by nonlinear least square fit to Equation 2,[P]=[S]o(1−exp(−kcat/Km[E]ot))(Eq. 2) where [S]o represents the initial substrate concentration, whereas [P] is the product concentration at time t. When the substrate concentration encompassed the Km, the Michaelis-Menten equation (Equation 3) was used to determine both kcat and Km. The initial rate versus substrate concentration could be fit directly to the Equation 3,υ=kcat[E]o[S]/(Km+[S])(Eq. 3) where v represents the initial rate, [E]o is the total enzyme concentration, and [S] is the initial substrate concentration. pH Dependence Studies—The kcat and kcat/Km values for the Cdc14-catalyzed hydrolysis of pNPP and DiFMUP were determined as a function of pH at 30 °C. To fit the kcat/Km versus pH data for the hydrolysis of pNPP, Equation 4 was used,kcat/Km=(kcat/Km)max/(1+H/KS2)(1+H/KE1+KE2/H)(Eq. 4) where (kcat/Km)max is the pH-independent value of kcat/Km, H is the proton concentration, KS2 is the second ionization constant of the substrate, and KE1 and KE2 are the ionization constants of the enzyme (20Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11199-11204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To fit the kcat versus pH data, one of two equations (Equation 5 or 6) was used,kcat=(kcat)max/(1+H/KES1+KES2/H)(Eq. 5) kcat=(kcat)max/(1+H/KES1)(Eq. 6) where (kcat)max is the pH-independent value of kcat, H is the proton concentration, and KES1 and KES2 are the apparent ionization constants of the substrate-enzyme complex. Pre-Steady-state Kinetic Study—Pre-steady-state kinetic measurements of the wild-type Cdc14 and its D253A mutant-catalyzed hydrolysis of DiFMUP were conducted at pH 7.0 and 30 °C. Experiments were performed by mixing the enzyme and substrate in a temperature-controlled Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter. The excitation wavelength was 390 nm, and the emission wavelength was selected using a 420-nm cutoff filter. The reaction was monitored by the increase in fluorescence of the DiFMU product. A standard curve was generated by measuring the fluorescence of solutions of DiFMU that were reconstituted in the assay buffer. Data were collected and fit to Equation 7.y=At+B(1−e−bt)+C(Eq. 7) The burst amplitudes and rate constants were evaluated by the procedure described in Ref. 21Bender M.L. Kezdy F.J. Wedler F.C. J.

When [S] ≫ [E], values for KS and (k2 + k3) were obtained by plotting the first-order rate constant for the burst (kburst, that is b in Equation 7) versus substrate concentration and fitting the data to Equation 8.kburst=(k2+k3)[S]/(Ks+[S])(Eq. 8) The individual rate constants for the E-P formation (k2) and hydrolysis (k3) can be determined from the (k2 + k3) value and Equation 9.A=k2k3/(k2+k3)(Eq. 9) Preparation of Phosphorylated hCdh1 Protein—A procedure similar to that described previously (7Bembenek J.

Briefly, a recombinant baculovirus encoding hCdh1 with His6 tag fused to its N terminus was constructed using the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen). Sf9 cells were infected with the hCdh1 baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 for 50 h. The Sf9 cells were treated with 0.5 μm of okadaic acid for 4 h prior to harvesting. The cells were lysed with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.7), 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100. After centrifugation, the supernatant was incubated with Ni2+-NTA beads (Qiagen). After washing, hCdh1 was eluted with a step gradient of imidazole and dialyzed into the appropriate buffer for subsequent assays. Continuous Spectrophotometric Assay for Cdc14 and Its Mutants Using Phosphorylated hCdh1 as a Substrate—Kinetic parameters for the dephosphorylation of the phosphorylated hCdh1 protein were determined using a continuous spectrophotometric assay. This assay incorporates a coupled enzyme system, which uses purine nucleoside phosphorylase and its chromogenic substrate 7-methyl-6-thioguanosine for the quantification of inorganic phosphate produced in the phosphatase reaction (23Webb M.R.

Chem. 2002; 277: 31818-31825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The change in absorbance at 360 nm was due to the conversion of 7-methyl-6-thioguanosine to 7-methyl-6-thioguanine in the presence of inorganic phosphate. Quantitation of the inorganic phosphate produced in the phosphatase reaction was determined using the extinction coefficient of 11,200 m–1 cm–1 at 360 nm and pH 7.0. Experiments of wild-type Cdc14 were carried out at 25 °C in a 1.6-ml reaction mixture containing 100 mm Tris at pH 7.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase (Sigma), and 50 μm 7-methyl-6-thioguanosine. The spectrophotometric measurements were conducted using a PerkinElmer Lambda 14 spectrophotometer equipped with a magnetic stirrer in the cuvette holder. The kcat/Km values for the Cdc14 catalyzed dephosphorylation of hCdh1 were obtained by nonlinear least square fit to Equation 2. Experiments with Cdc14 mutants were carried out at 25 °C in a 200-μl reaction mixture under the same conditions in 96-well plates. The spectrophotometric measurements were obtained using a Molecular Devices Spectro MAX 340 plate reader. The kcat/Km values were obtained from a linear least square fit of the initial rate versus substrate concentration to Equation 1. In these measurements, the phosphorylated hCdh1 concentration was less than 4 μm, and the concentrations of the Cdc14 and its mutants ranged from 6.4 ∼ 64 nm. Active Site Substrate Specificity—The PTP active site binds and hydrolyzes phosphorylated amino acids such as Tyr(P). Consequently, although the physiological substrates of PTPs are phosphoproteins, members of the PTP superfamily are also capable of hydrolyzing small molecule aryl phosphates. An analysis of the active site substrate specificity of PTPs may furnish critical information with respect to the design of potent active site-directed inhibitors. For example, an investigation of PTP1B active site substrate specificity led to the identification of several potent small molecule aryl phosphate substrates (25Montserat J. Chen L. Lawrence D.S.

To begin to probe the active site properties of Cdc14, we explored the ability of Cdc14 to catalyze the hydrolysis of a panel of aromatic phosphates, including 1-, 2-, and multi-ringed substrates. The chemical structures for pNPP, DiFMUP, and OMFP are shown in Fig. 1. All of the experiments described in this study were performed with the full-length recombinant Cdc14 from the budding yeast with an N-terminal His6 tag to enable facile purification. Steady-state parameters for the Cdc14-catalyzed hydrolysis of aryl phosphates were determined at pH 7.0 and 30 °C. As shown in Table I, the kcat values are similar for all aryl phosphate substrates while the Km values differ in a dramatic fashion. Consequently, the kcat/Km value, which is a measure of substrate specificity, spans several orders of magnitude. A comparison of kcat/Km values reveals several important features of the active site substrate specificity for Cdc14. First, Cdc14 shows a remarkable (230-fold) preference for DiFMUP over OMFP, even though these two substrates have very similar leaving group pKa values. This is in stark contrast to the Cdc25A dual specificity phosphatase, which exhibits a strong (73-fold) preference for OMFP over DiFMUP (29McCain D.F. Catrina I.E. Hengge A.C. Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11190-11200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cdc14 also shows a preference for 2-ringed substrates over 1-ringed substrates. The kcat/Km values for 6-FMUP and 5-FMUP are 11- and 9-fold higher than that of pNPP although these substrates share comparable leaving group pKa values. Similarly the kcat/Km value for β-naphthyl phosphate is 5.3-fold higher than that for 4-chlorophenyl phosphate even though these substrates also have the same leaving group pKa value. Unlike other dual specific phosphatases, such as Cdc25 phosphatases, mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatases, and VH1-related (VHR), which display a striking preference (∼2–3 orders of magnitude) for bulky multi-ringed substrates like OMFP over pNPP (29McCain D.F.

Interestingly, the tyrosine-specific PTPs exhibit very limited preference for substrates with more than one aromatic ring (20Zhang Z.-Y. J. Biol.

Collectively, the unique affinity of Cdc14 for 2-ringed aryl phosphate substrates suggest that the active site properties of the Cdc14 phosphatases are distinct from those of other dual specific and tyrosine-specific PTPs. This information regarding the range of functionality that can be readily accommodated by the active site of Cdc14 phosphatases may be useful when designing active site-directed inhibitors for these enzymes.Table IKinetic parameters of Cdc14-catalyzed hydrolysis of small molecule aryl phosphate substratesSubstratepKakcatKmkcat/Kms-1mmm-1 s-1OMFP4.63.4 ± 0.31.0 ± 0.13,400 ± 340DiFMUP4.78.1 ± 0.20.0105 ± 0.0006771,000 ± 63,0008-FMUP6.49.0 ± 1.00.7 ± 0.215,000 ± 1,5006-FMUP7.07.9 ± 0.71.6 ± 0.34,600 ± 5005-FMUP7.06.8 ± 0.21.7 ± 0.13,720 ± 350MUP7.87.0 ± 0.42.1 ± 0.23,305 ± 200β-Naph9.384.2 ± 0.22.0 ± 0.22,000 ± 1502-Cl-4-NO25.453.09 ± 0.040.4 ± 0.017,725 ± 80pNPP7.144.5 ± 0.210.6 ± 0.9424 ± 74-CN7.953.35 ± 0.0210.8 ± 0.9311 ± 24-CF38.68NDaND, not determined.ND440 ± 54-Cl9.384.2 ± 0.211.1 ± 1.1376 ± 4PhP9.992.55 ± 0.2011.1 ± 0.8225 ± 3a ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Effects of Mutation on Invariant Acidic Residues in Cdc14 — With the exception of the active site C(X)5R motif, Cdc14 phosphatases display little sequence similarity with other members of the PTP superfamily but share a number of invariant residues with phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), phosphatase of regenerating liver (PRL), and kinase associated phosphatase (KAP) (Fig. 2). Although the importance of the cysteine and arginine residues in the CX5R motif to PTP activity is well established, it is not known whether other residues also participate in Cdc14 catalysis. This is in contrast to other PTPs for which a set of conserved, catalytically important residues has been defined, and functions have been determined for each of these residues (16Zhang Z.-Y. Prog. Nuc. Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2003; 73: 171-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). For example, a conserved acidic residue has been shown to play an important catalytic role as a general acid/base in almost all PTPs examined to date, including the Yersinia PTP (35Zhang Z.-Y.

The general acid facilitates catalysis by protonating the leaving group oxygen, thereby neutralizing the negative charge that develops as the phosphate ester bond is broken. This stabilizes the transition state and enhances the rate of catalysis by >1000-fold in the case of the Yersinia PTP (35Zhang Z.-Y. Wang Y. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W1995524794,"Previous work demonstrated that U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP), bound to a downstream 5′ splice site, can positively influence utilization of an upstream 3′ splice site via exon definition in both trans- and cis-splicing systems. Although exon definition results in the enhancement of splicing of an upstream intron, the nature of the factors involved has remained elusive. We assayed the interaction of U1 snRNP as well as the positive effect of a downstream 5′ splice site on trans-splicing in nematode extracts containing either inactive (early in development) or active (later in development) serine/arginine-rich splicing factors (SR proteins). We have determined that U1 snRNP interacts with the 5′ splice site in the downstream exon even in the absence of active SR proteins. In addition, we determined that U1 snRNP-directed loading of U2 snRNP onto the branch site as well as efficient trans-splicing in these inactive extracts could be rescued upon the addition of active SR proteins. Identical results were obtained when we examined the interaction of U1 snRNP as well as the requirement for SR proteins in communication across a cis-spliced intron. Weakening of the 3′ splice site uncovered distinct differences, however, in the ability of U1 snRNP to promote U2 addition, dependent upon its position relative to the branch site. These results demonstrate that SR proteins are required for communication between U1 and U2 snRNPs whether this interaction is across introns or exons."

Here, we investigated the activation mechanism of a serotonin-gated receptor (5-HT3A) by systematically introducing cysteine substitutions throughout the pore-lining M1-M2 loop and M2 transmembrane domain. We hypothesized that multiple cysteines in the narrowest region of the pore, which together can form a high affinity binding site for metal cations, would reveal changes in pore structure during gating. Using cadmium (Cd2+) as a probe, two cysteine substitutions in the cytoplasmic selectivity filter, S2′C and, to a lesser extent, G-2′C, showed high affinity inhibition with Cd2+ when applied extracellularly in the open state. Cd2+ inhibition in S2′C was attenuated if applied in the presence of an open-channel inhibitor and showed voltage-dependent recovery, indicating a direct effect of Cd2+ in the pore. When applied intracellularly, Cd2+ appeared to bind S2′C receptors in the closed state. The ability of cysteine side chains at the 2′ and –2′ positions to coordinate Cd2+ in both the native open and closed states of the channel suggests that the cytoplasmic selectivity filter of 5-HT3A receptors maintains a narrow pore during channel gating.

LGIC receptors that respond to acetylcholine, γ-aminobutyric acid, glycine, or serotonin (5-HT) possess a conserved pair of extracellular cysteines in the N-terminal domain (“Cys loop” receptors) and are composed of five subunits, each containing four putative transmembrane domains (5Hille B. Ion Channels of Excitable Membranes. Sinauer Associates, Inc., Sunderland, MA2001: 170-171Google Scholar). Of these four domains, the second transmembrane domain (M2) lines the majority of the water-filled pore (Fig. 1A). The rapid response of LGIC receptors is achieved by the energetic coupling of agonist binding in the extracellular N-terminal domain with a “gate” located 60 Å away in the receptor pore (M2 domain) (6Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar).

Because permeability of like-charged molecules in LGIC appears to be largely dependent on size, it is believed that the narrowest region of the open LGIC pore coincides with the channel selectivity filter, which is formed by a portion of the M1-M2 loop and the cytoplasmic side of the M2 helix (16Cohen B.N. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 373-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 24Lester H.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 267-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Consistent with this region being narrow, site-specific mutations in the filter alter conductivity in a manner that depends upon side-chain volume (8Unwin N. Nature. 1995; 373: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar, 24Lester H.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1992; 21: 267-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Thus, the pore of the open receptor can be envisaged as a funnel, with a wide extracellular vestibule that tapers to a constriction at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, where ion selectivity is determined (25Unwin N. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 2000; 355: 1813-1829Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). What is known about the extent of movement in the cytoplasmic selectivity filter? The 9-Å three-dimensional structures of open and closed Torpedo nAChRs derived from cryoelectron microscopy appear to indicate a large conformational change upon activation in the region of the cytoplasmic selectivity filter (6Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar, 8Unwin N. Nature. 1995; 373: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). The more recent 4-Å closed structure places the M2 helices closer (6Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar, 8Unwin N. Nature. 1995; 373: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar), although no comparable high resolution structure exists for the open state. Differences in the rates of methanethiosulfonate (MTS) modification of cysteine-substituted nAChRs in their open and closed states, on the other hand, suggest that the intracellular region of the pore at the level of the selectivity filter is narrow in both the open and closed states (13Wilson G.G. Karlin A. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1269-1281Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). To better understand the coupling of ligand binding to receptor activation, we sought to determine which regions move in the pore. We took advantage of the metal binding properties of multiple cysteines; a high affinity binding site for divalent metal cations is created when two or more cysteines are in close proximity (∼7 Å) and oriented appropriately (26Ueyama N.

Such Cd2+ binding sites have been introduced into other proteins, such as KATP channels, voltage-gated K+ channels, and glutamate transporters (30Holmgren M. Shin K.S. Yellen G.

Previously, we determined the structure of the M2 and the location of the gate using cysteine-substituted 5-HT3A receptors (9Panicker S. Cruz H. Arrabit C. Slesinger P.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1629-1639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using these cysteine-substituted receptors, we now demonstrate that the selectivity filter of the 5-HT3A receptor is sufficiently narrow to form high affinity Cd2+ binding sites. We then investigated changes in pore structure using Cd2+ as a probe in cysteine-substituted 5-HT3A receptors. Molecular Biology—Cysteine mutants of 5-HT3A were constructed previously (9Panicker S. Cruz H. Arrabit C. Slesinger P.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1629-1639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Four mutants (L8′C, G10′C, Y11′C, F14′C) were not tested because they yielded little or no currents when expressed alone (see Ref. 9Panicker S. Cruz H. Arrabit C. Slesinger P.A. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 1629-1639Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro methyl-capped cRNA was made from linearized cDNA by T3 or T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene). The quality of cRNA was estimated using an ethidium-stained formaldehyde gel, and the concentration was measured by UV spectrophotometry. Xenopus oocytes were isolated as described previously (34Slesinger P.A. Patil N. Liao Y.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Cox D.R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 321-331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Stage V/VI oocytes were injected with a 46-nl solution containing 0.1–10 ng of receptor cRNA. Oocytes were incubated in 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.6 with NaOH) for 1–7 days at 16 °C. For studies with HEK-293T cells, 5-HT3A receptor cDNAs were subcloned in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). HEK-293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10%), glutamine (2 mm), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 μg/ml; Invitrogen) in a humidified 37 °C incubator with 95% air, 5% CO2. For electrophysiological recordings, cells were plated onto 12-mm glass coverslips (Warner Instruments) coated with poly-d-lysine (20 μg/ml; Sigma) and collagen (100 μg/ml; BD Biosciences) in 24-well plates. HEK-293T cells were transiently transfected with cDNA using the calcium phosphate method. Briefly, cDNA was mixed in sterile deionized water with 2.5 m CaCl2 to a final concentration of 2 ng/μl cDNA and 0.25 m CaCl2. This was combined 1:1 with HEPES-buffered saline (280 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm Na2HPO4, 12 mm glucose, 50 mm HEPES, pH 6.9, with ∼1 n NaOH) and then added to each well. HEK-293T cells were cultured for 16–32 h. Electrophysiology—Macroscopic currents were recorded from oocytes with a two-electrode voltage clamp amplifier (Geneclamp 500, Axon Instruments), filtered at 0.05 kHz, digitized (0.1 kHz) with a Digidata 1200 A/D interface (Axon Instruments), and stored on a laboratory computer. Electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had resistances of 0.4–2 megaohms. Oocytes were perfused continuously with a solution containing 96 mm NaCl (Aldrich), 2 mm KCl, 4.69 mm MgCl2 (free Mg2+ = 3.3 mm), 0.5 mm EGTA, and 5 mm HEPES (pH 7.6 with NaOH) while was voltage clamped at –80 mV. EGTA was omitted in solutions containing Cd2+. Programmable pinch valves (Warner Instruments) were used to change the extracellular solution flowing through a small chamber (0.32-cm width). The extracellular solution was connected to ground via a 3 m KCl-agarose bridge. The whole-cell patch clamp technique (35Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflügers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15175) Google Scholar) was used to record macroscopic currents from HEK-293T cells voltage-clamped at –40 mV. Borosilicate glass (Warner; P6165T) electrodes had resistances of 1–3 megaohms and were coated with Sylgard to reduce capacitance. Membrane currents were recorded with an Axopatch 200 or 200B (Axon Instruments) amplifier adjusted electronically for cell capacitance and series resistance (80–100%) before every sweep (once every 60 s), filtered at 2 kHz with an 8-pole Bessel filter, digitized at 5 kHz with a Digidata 1200 series interface (Axon Instruments), and stored on a laboratory computer. Intracellular pipette solution contained 130 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 5 mm EGTA (pH 7.4 with 10 mm KOH), 2.56 mm K2ATP, 5.46 mm MgCl2 (MgATP = 2 mm), and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with ∼2 mm NaOH). EGTA was omitted when intracellular Cd2+ was added, and MgCl2 was reduced to 5.2 mm to keep free MgATP = 2 mm. The external bath solution contained 158 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EGTA (pH 7.4 with ∼2 mm KOH), 4.69 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4 with ∼2mm NaOH) to approximate two-electrode voltage clamp solutions but with higher NaCl outside. EGTA was omitted in extracellular Cd2+-containing solutions. The osmolarity of all solutions was 310–330 mosmol. Extracellular solutions were delivered through a perfusion manifold (Warner MM-6) that was positioned ∼50–100 μm away from the cell and regulated by computer-controlled pinch valves (Warner VC-8). Analysis—The effect of extracellular Cd2+ on 5-HT-induced currents was examined in oocytes using the following protocol: two 5–10-s pulses of 10 μm 5-HT (I1 and I2), 2–3 min of wash, 1 min of Cd2+ (200 μm) in the absence or presence of 10 μm 5-HT, 2–3 min of wash, and finally two 5–10-s pulses of 5-HT (I3 and I4) (see Fig. 1, B and C). Depending upon the mutant studied, times for 5-HT activation (5–10 s, to ensure peak activation) and wash (75–180 s, to allow for complete recovery from desensitization) varied. The percentage inhibition was calculated using the expression (1 – I4/I2) × 100. The effect of extracellular Cd2+ administration on receptors expressed in HEK-293T cells was studied by first establishing a base-line current response from receptors by exposure to a 2-s 5-HT pulse followed by a 58-s wash (1 sweep) to allow for recovery from desensitization. Receptors were then exposed to 2-s 5-HT + Cd2+ (200 μm). This was followed by repeated 5-HT sweeps. Data were normalized by dividing the Cd2+-modified current by the initial base-line current response (Fig. 3B). For diltiazem experiments (Fig. 5), 5-HT was applied for 2 s followed by 3 s 5-HT plus diltiazem (100 μm), 2 s 5-HT plus diltiazem plus Cd2+ (200 μm), 2 s 5-HT plus diltiazem, and finally 3 s 5-HT alone (followed by wash). This Cd2+ treatment was repeated 5 times. For 1 μm Cd2+ experiments (Fig. 4), 5-HT was applied initially for 0.75 s followed by 2 s of 5-HT and Cd2+ and a 58-s wash. This was repeated until maximal inhibition was achieved. The normalized 5-HT-induced current (In/I0) was plotted as a function of cumulative exposure time to Cd2+ plus 5-HT and fit with a single exponential, y0 + a × exp(–x/τ), where y0 is the current remaining, a is the extent of inhibition, and τ is the time constant for inhibition. The bimolecular rate constant equals 1/(τ × [Cd2+]). For voltage-dependent recovery experiments (Fig. 6), maximal Cd2+ inhibition was elicited by applying 2-s pulses of 5-HT plus Cd2+ (200 μm) in 5 successive sweeps. Recovery was induced by repeatedly alternating a 2-s 5-HT sweep at a pre-pulse voltage (–40, 0, +40, and +80 mV) and a 2-s 5-HT sweep at the test-pulse voltage (–40 mV). The time course of recovery at –40 mV was plotted as a function of 5-HT time at the pre-pulse voltage and fit with a single exponential, y0 +a × (1 – exp(–x/τ)), where y0 is the initial extent of Cd2+ inhibition, a = 1– y0 (for complete recovery), and τ is the time constant for recovery. For intracellular Cd2+ experiments (Fig. 7), receptors were stimulated with 2-s 5-HT pulses delivered every 60 s (Protocol 1). For Protocol 2, a 200-s wash time was inserted between the first and second pulse of 5-HT.Fig. 5Occlusion of the S2′C receptor pore with diltiazem retards Cd2+ inhibition. HEK-293T cells were transfected with S2′C cDNA. A, whole-cell patch clamp recording shows the effect of extracellular Cd2+ after inhibiting the 5-HT-induced current nearly 100% with 100 μm diltiazem. B, example of 5-HT-induced current in the presence of diltiazem and Cd2+ (indicated by the asterisk in A) is shown on an expanded time scale. The holding potential was –40 mV. C, using the same stimulation protocol, extracellular Cd2+ (arrow) in the absence of diltiazem inhibits S2′C receptors in the open state. D, example of 5-HT-induced current inhibited by Cd2+ alone (asterisk in C) is shown on expanded time scale. E, the 5-HT-induced current is normalized to control (Cd2+-free) and plotted as a function of the 5-HT pulse number. Inhibiting the current through S2′C with diltiazem clearly attenuates the inhibition produced by extracellular Cd2+ (n = 4–6).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 4S2′C receptors are inhibited by 1 μm extracellular Cd2+. HEK-293T cells were transfected with S2′C cDNA. A, whole-cell patch clamp recording shows the progressive reduction of 5-HT-induced current with repetitive pulses of 1 μm extracellular Cd2+ in the presence of 5-HT for 2 s. 5-HT was applied for 0.75 s before each Cd2+ application to monitor current reduction. Inset, sweep (indicated by asterisk) is shown on an expanded time scale. The scale bar is 0.5 nA and 2 s. The smooth curve shows a single-exponential fit to the open state, having a time constant τ = 15 s. Assuming a single-state model for inhibition, the rate of Cd2+ inhibition = 1.26 ± 0.29 × 105m–1 s–1. The holding potential was –40 mV. B, the 5-HT-induced current (peak at 0.75 s) is normalized to the pre-modified current level (second and third pulse of 5-HT) and plotted as a function of cumulative time exposed to 5-HT. For the control, S2′C receptors were repetitively pulsed with 5-HT alone (same protocol as in A but without Cd2+), and the current is plotted as a function of the cumulative time exposed to 5-HT. For S2′C receptors, the 5-HT-induced current decreases ∼20% over the time course of the experiments (∼15 min of recording).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 6Recovery from Cd2+ inhibition is enhanced at positive membrane potentials in the open but not the closed state. HEK-293T cells were transfected with S2′C cDNA. A, a whole-cell patch clamp recording shows the recovery from Cd2+ inhibition with a prepulse voltage of –40 mV and a test-pulse voltage of –40 mV. Cd2+ inhibition (not shown; gray bar) was produced by 5 repetitive 2-s pulse of 5-HT (10 μm) and Cd2+ (200 μm). The holding potential was –40 mV. B, current recording shows the recovery of S2′C receptors with a prepulse voltage of +80 mV and a test pulse voltage of –40 mV. Note that the recovery of 5-HT-induced current is faster at +80 mV than at –40 mV (A). The asterisk shows the inward current through S2′C receptors that occurs upon pulsing back to –40 mV immediately after 5-HT application at +80 mV. C, recovery from Cd2+ inhibition at positive potentials in the closed state with 5-HT. S2′C receptors were opened only at the holding potential of –40 mV. The average inhibition after the third pre-pulse at +80 mV in the closed state is 88 ± 3% (n = 3) compared with 9 ± 5% in the open state (n = 6). D, the 5-HT-induced current (at –40 mV) after Cd2+ treatment was normalized to the control (first 5-HT pulse) and plotted as a function of the cumulative open time at the pre-pulse voltage. Smooth curves show exponential fits having rate constants of 0.077 ± 0.016 s–1 (n = 4) for –40 mV, 0.158 ± 0.036 s–1 (n = 5) for 0 mV, 0.303 ± 0.068 s–1 (n = 7) for +40 mV, and 0.357 ± 0.098 s–1 (n = 6) for +80 mV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Fig. 7Intracellular Cd2+ inhibits S2′C and G-2′C receptors in the predominantly closed state.A, the schematic shows the administration of intracellular 200 μm Cd2+ via whole-cell patch pipette. B and C, whole-cell patch clamp recordings with 200 μm Cd2+ in the intracellular solution show little inhibition of wild-type (WT) 5-HT3A receptors (B) or E-1′C receptors (C) opened with 10 μm 5-HT (1.5 s). D and E, current traces show two different stimulation protocols for S2′C. In Protocol 1, 5-HT was applied once every 60 s (D). In Protocol 2, 5-HT was applied once, washed for 200 s, then followed by 5-HT pulses delivered every 60 s (E). Holding potential was –40 mV. F, the 5-HT-induced current was normalized to the first 5-HT pulse and plotted as a function of the total time of the recording for Protocol 1 (•) and Protocol 2 (○). Inset, the inhibition of current is plotted as a function of cumulative time exposed to 5-HT for both protocols. The smooth curve shows the exponential fit to the data. Note the superimposition when plotted as a function of total time, suggesting that S2′C and G-2C′ also coordinate intracellular Cd2+ in the closed state (S2′C, τ = ∼85 s with 97 ± 1% inhibition; G-2′C, τ = ∼90 s and 82 ± 2% inhibition; n = 4–7). E-1′C and wild-type receptors showed a 2 ± 13% (n = 7) and 11 ± 9% (n = 7) decrease in 5-HT-induced current, respectively, with 200 μm intracellular Cd2+ (not shown).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) All values are reported as the mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed for statistical significance (SigmaStat 2.0) using one-way analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni post hoc test with wild-type as control or two-tailed Student's t test. Values of p < 0.05 were considered significant. High Affinity Cd2+Binding Sites at the –2′ and 2′ Positions of M2—The Cd2+ sensitivity of cysteine-substituted 5-HT3A receptors was initially examined using the Xenopus oocyte expression system. To facilitate comparison among different LGIC receptors, we have used the X′ nomenclature system to refer to mutations in the M1-M2 loop and the M2 transmembrane domain (see Ref. 16Cohen B.N. Labarca C. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 373-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Twenty-three mutant receptors were made (D-4′C through V18′C; see Fig. 1A), of which 19 gave rise to 5-HT-induced current in oocytes (oocytes injected with cRNA encoding L8′C, G10′C, Y11′C, and F14′C gave rise to little or no 5-HT-induced current). To test the effect of Cd2+ on the open state of the receptor, we co-applied Cd2+ (200 μm) and 5-HT (10 μm) from the extracellular side of the mutant receptors. Cd2+ partially inhibited wild-type 5-HT3A receptors, but this reversed completely within ∼200 s of wash (the minimal time needed for full recovery from desensitization produced by 60-s stimulation with 5-HT; see Fig. 1B). Similar to wild-type, most cysteine mutants exhibited reversible inhibition by extracellular Cd2+ in the open state (not shown). However, two cysteine-substituted receptors, G-2′C and S2′C, appeared to “coordinate” Cd2+, which we define as the mechanism by which sulfhydryl groups trap Cd2+, resulting in the persistent inhibition of 5-HT-induced currents in the absence of applied Cd2+ (Fig. 1, C and E). Although S2′C receptors are inhibited nearly 100% during the co-application of 5-HT and Cd2+, the extent of persistent inhibition is only ∼80%. This observation suggests that there are two mechanisms of Cd2+ block, a rapidly reversible component that is relieved upon wash and a much slower component (coordination). There was no detectable increase in basal current after Cd2+ treatment, suggesting the receptors closed completely. A second exposure to 5-HT and Cd2+ did not result in additional inhibition of the 5-HT-induced current for S2′C receptors (Fig. 1C). The EC50 for G-2′C was 1.18 ± 0.01 μm (n = 5) before and 1.07 ± 0.03 μm (n = 4) after Cd2+ administration and for S2′C was 2.21 ± 0.03 μm (n = 10) before and 1.91 ± 0.07 μm (n = 4) after Cd2+. Thus, the smaller 5-HT-induced current could not be explained by a large shift in the EC50 for activation. Two native cysteines exist near the pore of 5-HT3A receptors, one in the M1 (C270) and one in the M3 transmembrane domains (C316). To examine whether these cysteines contributed to Cd2+ coordination, we studied the effect of extracellular Cd2+ on S2′C receptors containing a second mutation (C270A or C316A). Although the gating kinetics of the S2′C/C316A double mutant appeared to be somewhat slower than S2′C, both S2′C/C270A (80% ± 5%; n = 6) and S2′C/C316A (88% ± 1%; n = 6) mutants were significantly inhibited after exposure to Cd2+ in the open state. We also examined the possible contribution of the negatively charged glutamate at the –1′ position (Glu-1′) since it has been shown that acidic amino acids can participate in coordinating Cd2+ in metalloproteins (36Benning M.M. Shim H. Raushel F.M. Holden H.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 2712-2722Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Both S2′C/E-1′N (79 ± 3%; n = 6) and G-2′C/E-1′N (67 ± 1%; n = 6) appeared to bind Cd2+ equally well as S2′C and G-2′C, respectively. These results suggest that neither the receptor endogenous transmembrane cysteines nor the glutamate at the –1′ site contribute to persistent Cd2+ inhibition in S2′C and G-2′C receptors. We next investigated whether extracellularly applied Cd2+ modifies receptors in their closed state. We examined the closed state sensitivity of cysteine substitutions S-3′C through S2′C by exposing each mutant to extracellular Cd2+ in the absence of 5-HT. None of the receptors, including S2′C and G-2′C, exhibited any significant inhibition of 5-HT-induced current after the 60-s exposure to Cd2+ alone (Fig. 1, D and E). Thus, S2′C and G-2′C receptors are not readily accessible to extracellular Cd2+ in the closed state. Cd2+Coordination Occurs Primarily in the Open State— With prolonged agonist stimulation, LGIC receptors enter a non-conducting, desensitized state that may be structurally distinct from the open and closed states (37Wilson G. Karlin A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1241-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Although all recordings were performed in Ca2+-free solutions to slow the rate of desensitization (38Yakel J.L. Lagrutta A. Adelman J.P. North R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5030-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), significant desensitization remained during the 1-min stimulation of 5-HT3A receptors expressed in oocytes.

https://openalex.org/W2039900156,"There has been increasing interest in a potential role for fatty acids in adversely affecting organismal substrate utilization and contributing to the cardiovascular complications in insulin resistance. Fatty acids have already been implicated in regulating the expression of a number of genes in resident cells of the vessel wall. In the current studies, we evaluated a potential role for fatty acids in the regulation of macrophage apoE expression. Incubation in oleic acid increased the synthesis and secretion of apoE by human monocyte-derived macrophages. Part of this stimulation was mediated at a post-translational locus. Oleic acid increased the secretion of apoE from macrophages that constitutively expressed a human apoE3 cDNA. Incubation in palmitic acid decreased apoE secretion from these cells. The effect of oleic acid on apoE secretion could not be accounted for by the known effect of fatty acid on cellular sterol, because incubation in oleic acid did not suppress the degradation of nascent apoE. Incubation in oleic acid for at least 6 h was required to observe an effect on apoE secretion. Oleic acid altered the glycosylation pattern of cellular and secreted apoE, with a loss of the most heavily sialylated isoform. Oleic acid had no effect on the glycosylation of interleukin 6 secreted from macrophages. Elimination of apoE glycosylation, by substitution of threonine 194 with alanine, eliminated oleic acid-mediated stimulation of apoE secretion. These results indicate that oleic acid increases apoE secretion from macrophages at a locus involving post-translational glycosylation."
https://openalex.org/W2022621924,"Kruppel (Kr), a member of the gap class of Drosophila segmentation genes, encodes a DNA binding zinc finger-type transcription factor. In addition to its segmentation function at the blastoderm stage, Kruppel also plays a critical role in organ formation during later stages of embryogenesis. To systematically identify in vivo target genes of Kruppel, we isolated DNA fragments from the Kruppel-associated portion of chromatin and used them to find and map Kruppel-dependent cis-acting regulatory sites in the Drosophila genome. We show that Kruppel binding sites are not enriched in Kruppel-associated chromatin and that the clustering of Kruppel binding sites, as found in the cis-acting elements of Kruppel-dependent segmentation genes used for in silico searches of Kruppel target genes, is not a prerequisite for the in vivo binding of Kruppel to its regulatory elements. Results obtained with the newly identified target gene ken and barbie (ken) indicate that Kruppel represses transcription and thereby restricts the spatial expression pattern of ken during blastoderm and gastrulation."

We found a partially unfolded form (acid form) of ferric P450cam at pH 2.5, in which a Cys–-heme coordination bond in the native conformation was ruptured. When the pH was raised to pH 7.5, the acid form refolded to the native conformation through a distinctive intermediate. Formations of similar acid and intermediate forms were also observed for ferrous P450cam. Both the ferric and ferrous forms of the intermediate were found to have an unidentified axial ligand of the heme at the 6th coordination sphere, which is vacant in the high spin ferric and ferrous forms at the native conformation. For the ferrous form, it was also indicated that the 5th axial ligand is different from the native cysteinate. The folding intermediates identified in this study demonstrate occurrences of non-native coordination state of heme during the refolding processes of the large b-type heme protein, being akin to the well known folding intermediates of cytochromes c, in which c-type heme is covalently attached to a smaller protein.

Protein molecules populate not only their native state with correctly folded conformation but also all possible states with partially unfolded conformations. The conversion between the unfolded and folded states (folding/unfolding) can be described as thermodynamic processes (for reviews see Refs. 1Roder H.

The unfolded forms of proteins are normally minor species, which are difficult to identify under physiological conditions because of their higher free energy compared with the folded state. However, certain unfolded protein molecules are clearly found under some conditions, such as a high concentration of denaturants, high temperature, and high or low pH (1Roder H.

The refolding processes of protein are generally possible to be traced by appropriate time-resolved probes, if the refolding can be triggered by methods with a good time resolution. Rapid dilutions of denaturants, temperature jump, and pH jump are typical methods for this purpose (6Plaxo K.W. Dobson C.M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 630-636Google Scholar, 7Takahashi S.

Studies on the refolding processes of proteins have revealed that some protein molecules encounter low energy non-native conformations (folding intermediates), which are located at a local energetic minimum on the free energy surface of folding pathways (4Sosnick T.R.

Such incorrect configurations raise energy barriers between the local energetic minimum and the native state (4Sosnick T.R. Mayne L. Hiller R. Englander S.W. Nat. Struct.

A. 1995; 92: 9029-9033Google Scholar). Prosthetic groups of metalloproteins frequently present further variations in the folding processes, because they contribute to the conformation and the stability of protein molecules through coordination or covalent bonds with amino acid side chains (4Sosnick T.R. Mayne L. Hiller R. Englander S.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1993; 1: 149-156Google Scholar, 7Takahashi S. Yeh S.-R. Das T.K. Chan C.-K. Gottfried D.S. Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct.

The roles of prosthetic groups in the folding processes have been extensively studied for a class of cytochrome c (cyt-c) 1The abbreviations used are: cyt-c, cytochrome c; P450, cytochrome P450; P450cam, cytochrome P450cam; P420, cytochrome P420; P420cam, P420 form of cytochrome P450cam; BI, n-butyl isocyanide; RR, resonance Raman; chs, coordinate high spin; cls, coordinate low spin; cis, coordinate intermediate spin. proteins, which are small (∼100 amino acids) globular proteins containing a c-type heme (4Sosnick T.R. Mayne L. Hiller R. Englander S.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1993; 1: 149-156Google Scholar, 7Takahashi S. Yeh S.-R. Das T.K. Chan C.-K. Gottfried D.S. Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6925-6935Google Scholar). The heme of cyt-c plays a role in the formation of unique folding intermediates, in which its methionine axial ligand (Met-80 of horse heart cyt-c) in the native conformation is replaced by either an incorrect (non-native) histidine side chain (His-26 or His-33) or a water molecule (4Sosnick T.R. Mayne L. Hiller R. Englander S.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1993; 1: 149-156Google Scholar, 7Takahashi S. Yeh S.-R. Das T.K. Chan C.-K. Gottfried D.S. Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6925-6935Google Scholar). Dissociation steps of these non-native ligands are rate-limiting in the overall refolding processes. Therefore, the folding intermediates of cyt-c are responsible for the kinetic rate of recovery of the native conformation (4Sosnick T.R. Mayne L. Hiller R. Englander S.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1993; 1: 149-156Google Scholar, 7Takahashi S. Yeh S.-R. Das T.K. Chan C.-K. Gottfried D.S. Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 44-50Google Scholar, 8Yeh S.-R. Takahashi S. Fan B. Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 51-56Google Scholar, 13Elove G.A. Bhuyan A.K. Roder H. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6925-6935Google Scholar). In cyt-c, its c-type heme is attached to the protein through not only the two coordination bonds to amino acid ligands (Met-80 and His-18) but also the two covalent thioether bonds. Because of these covalent bonds, the heme is not detached from the protein of cyt-c in the unfolded states (4Sosnick T.R. Mayne L. Hiller R. Englander S.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1993; 1: 149-156Google Scholar, 7Takahashi S. Yeh S.-R. Das T.K. Chan C.-K. Gottfried D.S. Rousseau D.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 44-50Google Scholar, 8Yeh S.-R. Takahashi S. Fan B.

Partly because of this feature, cyt-c and other c-type heme proteins have served as convenient materials for folding studies with respect to the roles of heme. In contrast, protoheme (b-type heme) of most other heme proteins is generally attached to the protein moiety through only the coordination bonds and noncovalent interactions. Therefore, experimental methods for preparing unfolded states of the b-type heme proteins frequently result in the release of the heme from the protein (19Smith M.L. Paul J. Ohlsson P.I. Hjortsberg K. Paul K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 882-886Google Scholar, 20Wittung-Stafshede P. Lee J.C. Winkler J.R. Gray H.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6587-6590Google Scholar). This brings difficulties in investigating the changes of heme coordination states during the protein refolding processes. Accordingly, it is unclear whether the formation of folding intermediates with non-native heme coordination states is involved generally in the folding processes of heme proteins. In order to address this question, in this study we performed a series of refolding experiments on cytochrome P450cam (P450cam), which is one of the best characterized b-type heme proteins with respect to the protein structure. X-ray crystallographic studies have revealed that the structure of this relatively large (414 amino acids) heme protein is rich in α-helical and β-sheet segments (21Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C. Gunsalus I.C. Wagner G.C. Kraut J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16122-16130Google Scholar, 22Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C. Howard A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 687-700Google Scholar). P450cam, as well as other members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, has a b-type heme with a Cys– axial ligand (21Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C. Gunsalus I.C. Wagner G.C. Kraut J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16122-16130Google Scholar, 22Poulos T.L. Finzel B.C. Howard A.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 195: 687-700Google Scholar, 23Champion P.M. Stallard B.R. Wagner G.C. Gunsalus I.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 5469-5472Google Scholar). This Cys– ligand is responsible for several unique features of the heme of P450cam in either optical absorption (24Omura T. Sato R. J. Biol.

Gunsalus I.C. Wagner G.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1978; 100: 3743-3751Google Scholar) spectra, enabling us to investigate the ligand replacement reactions spectroscopically. Carefully adjusting the pH and other buffer conditions, we found the formation of an acid form of this heme protein in which the Cys–-heme coordination bond is ruptured, but the heme is still held in a partially unfolded protein structure. We used this unfolded protein as the starting material for our refolding experiments, which employed a pH jump method coupled with time-resolved optical absorption, fluorescence, CD, and RR techniques. The results of this study indicate formations of ferric and ferrous folding intermediates of P450cam, which retain the non-native coordination states of the heme. Materials—The ferric form of cytochrome P450cam (P450cam) was expressed in Escherichia coli strain JM109 and purified according to methods described elsewhere (30Imai M. Shimada H. Watanabe Y. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Makino R. Koga H. Horiuchi T. Ishimura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7823-7827Google Scholar). Sperm whale metmyoglobin (Sigma) was treated with potassium ferricyanide, to eliminate the reduced form of myoglobin remaining in the commercial product, and purified by CM-cellulose column chromatography as described previously (31Egawa T. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34858-34866Google Scholar). All other commercial chemicals were reagent grade or better and used without further purification. UV-visible Absorption Spectra—Absorption spectra were measured by a PerkinElmer Life Sciences spectrometer (lambda 18) equipped with a temperature control unit. For pH jump experiments, 2.5 μlof2.5 m Tris/water was added to 5 μm P450cam sample dissolved in 2.0 ml of buffer consisting of 8.7 mm citrate, 50 mm KCl, and 1 mmd-camphor, pH 2.5. The sample solution was stirred gently by a stirrer bar in an optical cubic cell while the Tris solution was added. The final pH after the addition of the Tris solution was pH 7.5. For measurements of ferrous and ferrous-carbon monoxide (CO) preparations, the air inside the optical cell was replaced by argon and CO, respectively, and the samples were reduced by small amounts of sodium dithionite. Samples of ferrous-n-butyl isocyanide (BI) adducts were prepared by introducing 1 mm BI to ferrous preparations. Fluorescence Spectra—Fluorescence spectra were measured at 20 °C by a Hitach fluorescence spectrometer (model F-3000). The excitation wavelength was fixed at 286 nm. Buffer conditions and pH jump method were the same as those employed for the absorption measurements. Circular Dichroism Spectra—Far-UV CD spectra were acquired at 20 °C on an AIVIV circular dichroism spectrophotometer model 125s calibrated with ammonium d-10 camphorsulfonic acid. The pH jump for the ferric acid form was carried out in a cuvette, and then the sample was transferred into a 1-mm path length CD cell. Spectral measurements for the refolding processes were started at 0.5 min after the pH jump and repeated every 6 min. The spectra are expressed as the mean residue ellipticity [θ]. The α-helix content (fH) was calculated from the ellipticity at 222 nm ([θ]222) according to Equation 1 established by Chen et al. (32Chen Y.-H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 22: 4120-4131Google Scholar). [Θ]222=−30,300 fH−2,340 (Eq. 1) Resonance Raman Spectra—RR spectra were measured at 20 °C by using a spinning cell system (1800 rpm). Refolding processes were investigated by employing a pH jump method essentially the same as that used for the UV-visible absorption experiments except for the protein concentration and total volume of samples; 6.3 μl of 2.5 m Tris/water was added to 30 μm acid form P450cam in 500 μl of buffer, pH 2.5 (8.7 mm citrate, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmd-camphor). The mixing of the Tris and sample solutions was done in a Raman cell by gently shaking the cell. Raman scattering was excited at 406.7 and 429 (± 0.5) nm by using a Kr+ laser (Spectra Physics, model 2016) and a diode laser (Hitachi Metals, model ICD-430), respectively. Scattered light was detected by a liquid N2-cooled charge-coupled device (Princeton Applied Research EG & G, CCD-1340/400-EB) attached to a single polychromator (Ritsu Oyo Kogaku, DG-1000). Kinetic and Thermodynamic Analyses—On the assumption of a simple sequential scheme (Scheme 1) for the refolding of the ferric acid form to the native state, rate constants (k1 and k2) were obtained by least squares analyses of UV-visible spectral changes. The analyses were carried out with the aid of the technique of singular value decomposition as described elsewhere (31Egawa T. Shimada H. Ishimura Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34858-34866Google Scholar). Temperature dependences of k1 and k2 were analyzed on the basis of the Eyring equation (Equation 2) as follows, lnkT=lnkBh+ΔS‡R−ΔH‡R1T (Eq. 2) where k is the rate constant; T is the temperature; kB is the Boltzmann constant; h is the Planck constant; R is the gas constant; ΔS‡ is the activation entropy; ΔH‡ is the activation enthalpy. Enzyme Assay—The catalytic activities of P450cam preparations were measured in a reconstituted system at 20 °C as described previously (30Imai M. Shimada H. Watanabe Y. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Makino R. Koga H. Horiuchi T. Ishimura Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7823-7827Google Scholar, 33Hishiki T. Shimada H. Nagano S. Egawa T. Kanamori Y. Makino R. Park S.-Y. Adachi S. Shiro Y. Ishimura Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2000; 128: 965-974Google Scholar). NADH oxidation and oxygen consumption by P450cam in the reconstituted system were measured simultaneously by monitoring changes in absorption at 360 nm and in the reading of an oxygen electrode. The buffer system used for the assays was 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, containing 50 mm KCl and 1 mmd-camphor. Absorption Spectral Changes of Ferric P450cam—UV-visible absorption spectra of ferric P450cam have been studied extensively at a pH range around pH 7.0 (for a review see Ref. 26Gunsalus I.C. Meeks J.R. Lipscomb J.D. Debrunner P. Münck E. Hayaishi O. Molecular Mechanisms of Oxygen Activation. Academic Press, New York1974: 559-613Google Scholar). Absorption peak positions were reported to be 391, 540, and 646 nm for the d-camphor bound form of ferric P450cam (26Gunsalus I.C. Meeks J.R. Lipscomb J.D. Debrunner P. Münck E. Hayaishi O. Molecular Mechanisms of Oxygen Activation. Academic Press, New York1974: 559-613Google Scholar). These spectral features are attributed to a 5-coordinate high spin (5chs) state, in which a cysteinate (Cys-357) coordinates to the ferric heme at the 5th (proximal) coordination sphere (Cys–-Fe3+) (26Gunsalus I.C. Meeks J.R. Lipscomb J.D. Debrunner P. Münck E. Hayaishi O. Molecular Mechanisms of Oxygen Activation. Academic Press, New York1974: 559-613Google Scholar). On the other hand, in absence of d-camphor, ferric P450cam carries a 6-coordinate low spin (6cls) heme with the cysteinate and a water molecule as the proximal and distal ligands, respectively (Cys–-Fe3+-H2O), giving absorption peaks at 417, 535, and 571 nm (26Gunsalus I.C. Meeks J.R. Lipscomb J.D. Debrunner P. Münck E. Hayaishi O. Molecular Mechanisms of Oxygen Activation. Academic Press, New York1974: 559-613Google Scholar). The present preparation of ferric P450cam in the presence of d-camphor in a citrate-Tris buffer, pH 7.5 (8.6 mm citrate, 31 mm Tris, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmd-camphor), showed a UV-visible absorption spectrum (Fig. 1A, broken line, and Table I) essentially the same as the known spectrum of the 5chs form.Table IAbsorption maxima of several forms of P450cam and other heme compoundsLigand(s)WavelengthnmP450cam, acid formaThis work.Ferric371518550652Ferrous385545573P450cam, folding intermediateaThis work.Ferric416538571Ferrous424531559Ferrous-BIbBI, n-butyl isocyanide.433542Ferric 5chs speciesFerric P450camaThis work.,cFerric P450cam with d-camphor.Cys-392509540645Cyt-c peroxidase, pH 7dCytochrome c peroxidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (60).His408505645HRP-C, pH 6.6eHorseradish peroxidase isozyme C.,fSee Ref. 61.His403498640CatalasegS. cerevisiae (62).Tyr406500530630MetMb, pH 3.75aThis work.,hSperm whale myoglobin.H2O370509545635HRP-C, pH 3.1eHorseradish peroxidase isozyme C.,iSee Ref. 34.H2O370519652Ferric 6chs speciesMetMb, pH 6.0hSperm whale myoglobin.,jSee Ref. 63.His/H2O410505635MetMb, F- adducthSperm whale myoglobin.,jSee Ref. 63.His/F-406490606Ferric 6cls speciesFerric P450camkFerric P450cam in the absence of d-camphor (26).Cys-/H2O417535571MetMb, CN- adducthSperm whale myoglobin.,jSee Ref. 63.His/CN-423540MetHb, CN- adductjSee Ref. 63.,lHuman hemoglobin.His/CN-419540MetHb, Im adductjSee Ref. 63.,lHuman hemoglobin., mIm, imidazole.His/Im411534560HRP-C, pH∼12eHorseradish peroxidase isozyme C.,nSee Ref. 64.His/OH-416542571633Ferrous 5chs speciesFerrous P450camaThis work.Cys-409544DeoxyMbhSperm whale myoglobin.,jSee Ref. 63.His434556Ferrous 6cls speciesP450cam, CO adductaThis work.Cys-/CO446550P450cam, BI adductbBI, n-butyl isocyanide.,oSee Ref. 27.Cys-/BI452548575P450cam, DMS adductoSee Ref. 27.,pDMS, dimethyl sulfide.Cys-/DMS446541568Cytochrome H450qRat liver cytoplasmic protein H450 (65).Cys-/His448540571Mb, CO adducthSperm whale myoglobin.,jSee Ref. 63.His/CO423542579Mb, BI adductbBI, n-butyl isocyanide.,hSperm whale myoglobin.,rSee Ref. 66.His/BI432542567Cytochrome coSee Ref. 27.,sHorse heart cytochrome c.His/Met416520550Cytochrome b5tRat hepatic cytochrome b5 expressed in E. coli (67).His/His423527555Ferrous 4cis speciesDeoxy-Mb, pH 3.98hSperm whale myoglobin.,uSee Ref. 35.None383a This work.b BI, n-butyl isocyanide.c Ferric P450cam with d-camphor.d Cytochrome c peroxidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (60Yonetani T.

Open table in a new tab When the above ferric preparation was placed at pH 2.5 (8.7 mm citrate, 50 mm KCl, 1 mmd-camphor), it exhibited a spectrum (Fig. 1A, thick solid line; λmax, 371, 518, 550, and 652 nm) distinct from the spectra of the native 5chs and 6cls forms. This finding indicates that the ferric P450cam converted to an unknown species, in which certain changes in the coordination and/or spin states of the heme took place under the present experimental conditions at pH 2.5. This new species is termed the acid form of ferric P450cam in this study. The Soret peak of the ferric acid form of P450cam (371 nm; Fig. 1A, thick solid line) is significantly blue-shifted, which is not typical of His-, Tyr-, or Cys–-ligated 5c and 6c ferric hemes (Table I). On the other hand, blue-shifted Soret bands at ∼370 nm are found for metmyoglobin at pH 3.75 (Fig. 1A, thin solid line; λmax, 370 nm) and horseradish peroxidase C at pH 3.0 (λmax, 370 nm) (34Smulevich G.

This spectral similarity strongly suggests that the acid form of ferric P450cam carries a Fe3+-H2O heme. Further details of the coordination and spin states of the heme were investigated by resonance Raman techniques as described later. By employing the pH jump method (see “Experimental Procedures”), we examined whether the acid form of ferric P450cam could recover the native state of the heme. Fig. 1, B and C, illustrates changes in UV-visible absorption at 20 °C after the pH of the acid form sample jumped to pH 7.5; arrows in Fig. 1, B and C, indicate directions of time-dependent absorption changes. In Fig. 1B, spectra are those recorded at 0, 2, and 4 min after the pH jump, and in Fig. 1C are those at 14–120 min. The absorption changes proceeded as a biphasic process. In the first phase (Fig. 1B), the spectrum of the acid form was changed to that characterized by new peaks at 416, 538, and 571 nm, indicating a temporary accumulation of an unknown intermediate species. The intermediate spectrum was then changed relatively slowly to a spectrum, which was very close to that of the native 5chs form of ferric P450cam (Fig. 1C). The absorption changes ended within 120 min, and no subsequent change in absorption was observed. The final spectrum at 120 min (Fig. 1C) showed a 5–6% decrease in the Soret intensity as compared with the native ferric P450cam. However, the absorption peaks of the final spectrum were located at wavelengths (392, 509, 540, and 645 nm) exactly the same as those of the native 5chs form. The set of the absorption peak positions of the intermediate (416, 538, and 571 nm) is typical of ferric 6cls hemes (Table I). Resonance Raman data (see below) also supported the formation of a 6cls heme. These findings indicate that the 6th coordination sphere of the ferric heme of the intermediate is occupied by an unknown ligand (ligand X) that does not exist in the native 5chs P450cam. The absorption changes from the acid to the native spectrum via the intermediate and the time scales of the changes were reproducible when pH jump experiments were performed at P450cam concentrations in the range 2.5–30 μm. At the end of the pH jump experiment, we took aliquots from the sample (recovered sample) to examine the enzymatic activity as well as the spectra of the ferrous and ferrous-CO forms. The recovered sample showed ∼94% activity relative to the authentic one (data not shown), whereas ferrous and ferrous-CO spectra of the recovered sample were as in Fig. 2, A and B, respectively (solid lines). For comparison, authentic ferrous and ferrous-CO spectra of P450cam are also shown (Fig. 2, broken lines). The ferrous spectrum of the recovered sample (Fig. 2A) exhibits shoulders at 426 and 558 nm, which are not found in the authentic one, whereas the ferrous-CO spectrum (Fig. 2B) shows a new peak at 422 nm and a shoulder at around 572 nm. Thus the present pH jump method resulted in the formation of a small amount of certain denatured product(s). However, the ferrous and ferrous-CO spectra of the recovered sample show peaks at positions exactly the same as those of the corresponding authentic spectra (ferrous, 409 and 544 nm; ferrous-CO, 446 and 550 nm).
