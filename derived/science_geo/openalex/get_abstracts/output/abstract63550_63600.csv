https://openalex.org/W2035756608,"Mammals mark frequently in any situation where they are both intolerant of and dominant to other members of the same species. In other words, they mark when they are likely to attack another member of the same species, and are likely to win if they do attack. Such a situation occurs, as Hediger (13) pointed out, in connection with territoriality but it also occurs in other kinds of social systems. Frequent, vigorous marking occurs at times when there is reason to infer that the animal is motivated to aggression. The effects of marks and marking upon other individuals are poorly understood. Many species mark with more than one source of scent in response to one stimulus or set of stimuli."
https://openalex.org/W2085302681,"The retinal cones of cynomolgus macaque monkeys show marked amounts of adaptation when the receptor potential is elicited by brief incremental stimuli presented against steady backgrounds of increasing intensity. The results can be accounted for by mechanisms of response compression, modified by the effects of photopigment bleaching, which together set the gain of the system at each background level, while also making the response nearly linear over a significant range of intensities above and below that of each adapting stimulus."
https://openalex.org/W2054391110,"Recordings have been obtained simultaneously from several, individually selected neurons in the motor cortex of unanesthetized monkey as the animal performed simple arm movements. With the use of comparatively simple quantitative procedures, the activity of small sets of cells was found to be adequate for rather accurate real-time prediction of the time course of various response measurements. In addition, the results suggest that hypotheses concerning the response variables ""controlled"" by cortical motor systems may well depend upon whether or not the temporal relations between simultaneously active neurons are taken into account."
https://openalex.org/W2147785018,"Abstract Bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase forms a highly complex with 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonamide (DNSA). The binding, studied either by enhancement of ligand fluorescence or by the quenching of protein ultraviolet fluorescence, shows that only 1 mole of DNSA is bound per mole of protein; the dissociation constant at pH 7.4 is 2.5 x 10-7 m. The fluorescence of free DNSA in water has peak emission at 580 mµ and a quantum yield of only 0.055, but bound DNSA has an emission maximum at 468 mµ and a yield of 0.84. Arguments are presented to explain the large emission blue shift on the basis that the binding site is extremely hydrophobic and that the —SO2NH2 group of the ligand loses a proton upon binding to the enzyme. The binding appears specifically to involve the sulfonamide site known to exist in carbonic anhydrase; several other fluorescent probe compounds showed no evidence of binding to the enzyme. Calculation of the energy transfer efficiency gave the surprising result that 85% of the photons absorbed by the 7 tryptophan residues are transferred to the single bound DNSA molecule. The transfer efficiency is much higher than hitherto observed for a protein having only one 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl group. Although the diameter of the protein is roughly 51 A, the bound DNSA group is probably within the critical transfer distance R0 (- 21.3 A) of all the tryptophans. The effective average distance between DNSA and tryptophan was found to be 16 A. The fluorescence properties of the complex were quite different from those of a conjugate prepared by reaction of 5-dimethylaminonaphthalene-1-sulfonyl chloride with carbonic anhydrase. Various considerations lead to the conclusion that the sulfonamide-binding site and the tryptophan residues are in the interior of the protein. The tryptophan fluorescence of the protein was 73% quenched by the binding of 1 DNSA molecule. Although large, this degree of quenching was less than the over-all efficiency of energy transfer of photons absorbed by the protein. This result indicates that the fluorescence efficiencies of the 7 tryptophans are different, and that DNSA is bound in such a way that energy transfer occurs with greater probability from those tryptophan residues which are relatively less fluorescent. DNSA inhibits the esterase activity of carbonic anhydrase as tested with the substrate, p-nitrophenyl acetate. Direct measurements of fluorescence decay times permitted calculation of the rotational relaxation time of carbonic anhydrase from depolarization of fluorescence data. The value of about 30 nsec for the relaxation time is consistent with a low degree of molecular asymmetry."
https://openalex.org/W2020715512,"Single cell responses were recorded from the superior colliculus of awake monkeys trained to move their eyes. A class of cells that discharged before eye movements was found in the intermediate and deep layers of the colliculus. The response of the cells was most vigorous before saccadic eye movements within a particular range of directions. These cells had no visual receptive fields, and visually guided eye movements were not necessary for their discharge, since they responded in total darkness before spontaneous eye movements and vestibular nystagmus."
https://openalex.org/W1608359251,"Abstract Salmon generally possess three forms of supernatant malate dehydrogenase whose subunit compositions are indicated by the formulas AA, AB, and BB. Each of the homodimers (AA and BB) has now been purified to homogeneity. The two enzymes are similar in molecular size and in catalytic properties to the supernatant malate dehydrogenases of higher vertebrates; both are catalytically distinct from the mitochondrial form of this enzyme in salmon as well as in higher vertebrates. The two enzymes differ significantly in amino acid composition. The compositional differences are small enough to suggest that the amino acid sequences of A and B subunits are related. Such a relationship is supported by immunological experiments conducted with rabbit antisera prepared against the purified enzymes. These findings suggest that the A and B subunits are the products of duplicate genes which have undergone limited evolutionary divergence. Salmon and trout populations were examined by electrophoresis for malate dehydrogenase variants. The B-type subunit was found to exist in two common forms, B and B'. Most king salmon were found to produce only the B form, whereas most rainbow trout possess the B' form. A few salmon and trout were observed to be heterozygotes producing both the B and B' subunits. By chromatographic and densitometric determination, most rainbow trout heterozygotes possessed a distinctly asymmetrical 1:6:9 ratio of the three enzymes, BB, BB', B'B'; in contrast, king salmon heterozygotes possessed a 9:6:1 ratio of BB, BB', and B'B'. The genetic basis of these peculiar ratios was investigated by matings of heterozygous and homozygous salmon. The offspring were grown for 4 months and tested electrophoretically for the presence and ratio of B and B' subunits. The results demonstrate that salmon possess not one but two genetic loci for the B-type subunit of supernatant malate dehydrogenase. Isoenzyme dosage studies with brown trout suggest that duplicate genes also exist for the A-type subunit. We conclude that two rounds of gene duplication for supernatant malate dehydrogenase have taken place before or during the evolution of salmonid fishes."
https://openalex.org/W1525060854,"Three parameters involved in the binding of substrate to linoleate isomerase of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens have been identified from studies of inhibition by fatty acid isomers and analogues. They are (a) the π system of the substrate double bond, (b) hydrophobic interaction, and (c) hydrogen bonding of the substrate carboxyl group. Almost every unsaturated fatty acid tested inhibited the enzyme, regardless of configuration or double bond position between carbons 3 and 12. Superimposed on this contribution of unsaturation was the correlation of inhibition with chain length and with the presence of an active hydrogen on a C-1 substituent. Inhibition by unsaturated fatty acids or their derivatives in all cases examined was competitive. More restrictive requirements for isomerization were revealed by incubation of the enzyme with positional and configurational isomers and carboxyl derivatives of the substrate. An absolute requirement for a cis-9, cis-12-diene system and a free C-1 carboxyl group was shown. Two chelators, o-phenanthroline and EDTA, were identified as reversible inhibitors of the enzyme. Inhibition by o-phenanthroline was noncompetitive. The isomerase was also inhibited by the sulfhydryl reagents, p-hydroxymercuribenzoate, iodoacetamide, and N-ethylmaleimide."
https://openalex.org/W1524061278,"Abstract A procedure is described for the purification of glutamine synthetase from Bacillus subtilis, grown under conditions of nitrogen limitation, to a nearly homogeneous state. Although the purified enzyme differs from the glutamine synthetase from Escherichia coli in catalytic properties and stability, the physical characteristics of these two enzymes are quite similar. The B. subtilis enzyme has a molecular weight of ∼600,000, a sedimentation coefficient at infinite dilution of 19.3 S, and is seen in electronmicrographs as a molecule composed of 12 subunits arranged in 2 superimposed hexagonal rings. Studies with the dissociated enzyme suggest that the subunit molecular weight is ∼50,000, in agreement with a dodecameric aggregate structure of the native enzyme which contains 12 subunits of similar size. Both Mn2+ and Mg2+ activate the enzyme in the biosynthesis of l-glutamine, but, unlike the E. coli system, the Mg2+-dependent activity is intrinsically less stable than the Mn2+-dependent activity. Differences between the B. subtilis and E. coli enzymes are apparent also in the amino acid compositions, in the susceptibility to digestion by carboxypeptidase A, in the C-terminal amino acid of the subunit polypeptide chains, in immunochemical properties, and in that the E. coli adenylylating enzyme system does not incorporate 5'-14C-adenylyl groups into the B. subtilis glutamine synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1573089231,"Abstract The glutamine synthetase of Bacillus subtilis has an absolute requirement for divalent cation. Either Mg2+ or Mn2+ will serve as an activator, but each affects various catalytic parameters differently. The concentration of either divalent cation required to produce half-maximal activity (the S0.5) is a function of the ATP concentration. Optimal activity with Mn2+ occurs when the ratio of ATP to Mn2+ is 1.0, and decreases sharply with any deviation from this ratio. With Mg2+, optimal activity is achieved when the concentration of Mg2+ is 4- to 5-fold in excess of the ATP concentration, and it is not substantially affected by large excess of this cation. The saturation functions for the substrates are generally complex and vary with the kind of divalent cation used to activate the enzyme. With Mn2+, the activity increases with increasing concentration of glutamate or ammonia, but reaches a maximum at relatively low levels of substrate and then decreases with higher substrate concentrations. In contrast, with Mg2+, the enzyme is not saturated even at high concentration (100 mm) of either substrate. In the Mg2+ system, double-reciprocal plots of reaction velocity versus substrate concentration are concave downward, suggesting that negative cooperativity might be involved in substrate binding. The enzyme is inhibited by end products of glutamine metabolism, AMP, CTP, histidine, tryptophan, alanine, and glycine. Both the kinetics and sensitivity to feedback inhibition by each of these products are dependent upon whether Mg2+ or Mn2+ is used as the activating cation. The capacity of B. subtilis glutamine synthetase to be activated by Mn2+ and by Mg2+ is apparently an intrinsic property of the enzyme; it is independent of growth conditions and is not determined by adenylylation of the enzyme as it is for the enzyme from Escherichia coli. Efforts to demonstrate adenylylated forms of the B. subtilis enzymes were unsuccessful. In contrast to the E. coli enzyme, the glutamine synthetase from B. subtilis is inhibited by glutamine and this inhibition varies with the divalent cation used to activate the enzyme; with Mn2+ activation, inhibition by glutamine is greatly potentiated by AMP. From the standpoint of cellular regulation, it seems that in both E. coli and B. subtilis, the intracellular level of glutamine is the most important single factor in determining glutamine synthetase activity; however, in B. subtilis, glutamine is a direct inhibitor of glutamine synthetase activity, whereas, in E. coli, it exerts its affect indirectly through activation and inhibition of the adenylylating and deadenylylating enzymes, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W1546005878,"Abstract A glutamine-dependent carbamyl phosphate synthetase, the occurrence of which was suggested by previous studies with intact cells, has been found in extracts of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma. The activity is detectable by measuring the incorporation of 14C-bicarbonate of high specific activity into citrulline when purified Streptococcus faecalis ornithine transcarbamylase and ornithine are added to the extract. The 14C-bicarbonate incorporation into citrulline requires (in addition to the tumor extract, ornithine transcarbamylase, and ornithine) magnesium, adenosine triphosphate, and glutamine or ammonia. The Km for glutamine is close to 10-5 m, whereas the Km for ammonium chloride is about 5 x 10-3 m. The incorporation is inhibited by glutamine analogues when either glutamine or ammonia is the substrate. A standard assay and a procedure to stabilize the enzyme are described. Other properties of the extracted enzyme are described. The enzyme is similar to the glutamine-dependent carbamyl phosphate synthetases from mushroom, Escherichia coli and yeast. The role of this enzyme in mammalian and avian pyrimidine synthesis is discussed."

The major product of this reaction (representing about 60% of the total mannolipids formed) is an alkali-stable, acid-labile mannolipid. This new lipid was isolated in a high state of purity from a preparative scale synthesis experiment with uniformly labeled GDP-d-mannose-14C as the substrate, mycobacterial crude phospholipid as the acceptor, and the particulate transmannosylase enzyme system from M. tuberculosis. The product was characterized and is 14C-mannosyl-1-phosphoryl-decaprenol."

https://openalex.org/W1636008369,"RNA synthesis, one of the early events in spore germination, is underway by the 2nd min. During the first 10 min of germination, RNA synthesis can proceed in the absence of exogenous nutrients at the expense of previously existing RNA. Salvage pathways for bases, nucleosides, and nucleotides are operative during this period and utilize enzymes which are previously formed in the dormant spore. Biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines de novo begins approximately 15 to 20 min after the onset of germination. The increase in nucleotide pools sustains an increase in the rate of RNA synthesis. Protein synthesis is necessary for the initiation of nucleotide biosynthesis de novo and one of the enzymes whose synthesis is required is aspartate transcarbamylase. Amino acids generated by the proteolysis during germination are sufficient for synthesis of proteins required for nucleotide biosynthesis de novo and provide the nitrogen source for nucleotide biosynthesis, but exogenous carbon and energy sources must be supplied."
https://openalex.org/W1548469072,"Abstract Isolation and purification of trypsin-like proteases from the pyloric caeca of the starfish Dermasterias imbricata resulted in the separation of two different proteins which possessed tryptic-like activity. Both enzymes were homogeneous as judged by polyacrylamide electrophoresis and both have molecular weights of 25,000 to 26,000 as determined by gel filtration. The enzymes were inhibited by diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate and Nα-tosyl-l-lysylchloromethane, but not by soybean trypsin inhibitor. Enzyme stability, as affected by temperature and pH, showed marked differences between the two enzymes. Hydrolysis of benzoyl-dl-arginine-p-nitroanilide hydrochloride by each enzyme was optimal at pH 8.0 to 8.5. The starfish enzymes hydrolyze this synthetic substrate at rates 3.2- and 1.2-fold faster than bovine pancreatic trypsin does. Proteolytic digestion of glucagon and amino acid analysis of the resulting peptides revealed a cleavage specificity for both starfish proteases similar to that of bovine pancreatic trypsin. The enzymes appear to exist as inactive precursors in the pyloric caeca, with spontaneous activation taking place on incubation at 20°. The activation was accelerated by addition of exogenous pancreatic trypsin and calcium. However, neither of the purified starfish enzymes showed dependence on calcium ion concentration for enzymatic activity or stability and were unaffected by ethylenediaminetetraacetate."
https://openalex.org/W1490971597,"The Micrococcus luteus DNA polymerase was purified over 1200-fold. The enzyme replicates, with varying efficiency, a wide variety of naturally occurring DNA's, including double stranded, single stranded, circular, and denatured DNA's. Also, a variety of DNA polymers containing defined repeating nucleotide sequences are replicated; many-fold synthesis is customarily observed. Replication is completely accurate as judged by nearest neighbor frequency analyses and analytical ultracentrifugal studies on the product DNA. When native Bacillus subtilis transforming DNA is replicated, however, the product DNA is not genetically active and is renaturable. The polymerase efficiently and faithfully repairs DNA's that contain partially single stranded regions."

https://openalex.org/W1514890056,"Abstract Kinetic studies of glutamic acid uptake in Streptococcus faecalis revealed the operation of two saturable transport components with widely different apparent Km values. While studying the properties of these systems, we investigated the possibility that one of these kinetic components was a metabolic system which led to the intracellular accumulation of substantial amounts of a glutamic acid metabolite. At either low or high extracellular glutamate concentrations in the operating range of either the high or low affinity components, between 81 and 86% of the accumulated isotope remained in glutamic acid during the first 2 min of uptake. The distribution of isotope among chromatographically separated intracellular glutamate metabolites was the same when glutamate was accumulated largely by either the high or the low affinity system indicating that neither kinetic component represents a metabolic system. This conclusion was supported by comparable findings using a mutant which lacks the high affinity transport component. Aspartic acid uptake also was characterized by curvilinear Lineweaver-Burk plots. Competition studies indicated that aspartic and glutamic acids are taken up by the same two kinetic components. The high affinity system showed an absolute dependence on glucose as judged by initial rate studies or equilibrium accumulation levels. Glucose dependence of the low affinity system could be demonstrated only after several minutes of uptake when a sizeable pool had been accumulated. In some cases glucose inhibited the initial rate of uptake by this component. No additional criteria for distinguishing the two dicarboxylic amino acid transport components were encountered other than a greater sensitivity to glutamine competition in the low affinity system. Kinetic studies of glutamine, α-aminoisobutyric acid, and cycloleucine transport revealed curvilinear Lineweaver-Burk plots in all cases. For glutamine and α-aminoisobutyrate, the observed kinetics could be accounted for by the operation of a saturable and a diffusion-controlled process. In contrast, cycloleucine transport appeared to involve two saturable components."
https://openalex.org/W1517896361,"Abstract Mutants of Bacillus subtilis deficient in urocanase or in imidazolonepropionate hydrolase were isolated. These mutants are unable to use l-histidine as source of carbon or nitrogen for growth. The enzymes are thus essential for the metabolism of histidine. The structural genes specifying these enzymes are closely linked to those specifying the other two enzymes essential for histidine degradation, histidase, and formiminoglutamate hydrolase. The response of these enzymes to induction and catabolite repression is specified by a region of the chromosome closely linked to one end of the cluster of structural genes. The gene cluster presumably constitutes an operon."
https://openalex.org/W1519535923,"Abstract A mutant of Bacillus megaterium lacking the aspartate β-semialdehyde-pyruvate-condensing enzyme and mesodiaminopimelic acid decarboxylase has been used in a study of mucopeptide metabolism during growth and sporulation. The absolute requirement for both diaminopimelic acid and lysine in this mutant guarantees that exogenous labeled diaminopimelic acid is incorporated specifically into mucopeptide greatly facilitating such studies. During the vegetative growth phase, no turnover of mucopeptide was observed. Upon glucose exhaustion and the initiation of sporulation, vegetative cell mucopeptide synthesis ceased. The mother cell wall remained quiescent throughout the sporulation sequence. Some 3 hours after the end of vegetative cell growth, spore-specific mucopeptide synthesis began and continued for approximately 6 hours. Sporulation was terminated by lysis of mother cell wall which released free spores into the medium."

https://openalex.org/W2157754721,"Abstract The oxidation of Fe(II) and aromatic diamines as catalyzed by human ferroxidase (ceruloplasmin, EC 1.12.3.1) exhibits nonlinear kinetics in typical v against v/s plots. The possibility of two enzymes or more has been excluded by experiments indicating the chemical and kinetic homogeneity of crystalline ferroxidase. The kinetics of Fe(II) oxidation can be accounted for by a mechanism based on substrate activation resulting in a rate expression of the form: [see PDF for equation] Curves calculated from this expression fit the experimental points within allowed error at several temperatures. The rate constant, kxiii, for the proposed rate-determining step, was 7 to 10 times greater for the Fe(II)-activated reaction than for the rate constant, k13, for the nonactivated route. The loss of absorption at 610 nm in the presence of low concentrations of Fe(II) and the activation observed with other divalent metal ions, which are not substrates of ferroxidase, are also consistent with this mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W1554570503,"Abstract Two enzymes in the pathway of l-histidine degradation were partially purified from extracts of Bacillus subtilis grown on l-histidine. Urocanase, the enzyme catalyzing the conversion of urocanate to 4-imidazolone-5-propionate, has a molecular weight of about 120,000 and is composed of at least two subunits. It is a highly unstable enzyme, partially stabilized by pyridoxal phosphate. It has a Km value of 7.7 x 10-5 m; imidazolepropionate acts as a competitive inhibitor with a Ki value of 3.1 x 10-4 m. Formiminoglutamate hydrolase, the enzyme catalyzing the conversion of N-formimino-l-glutamate to l-glutamate and formamide, has a molecular weight of about 220,000. The enzyme has a specific requirement for Mn++ at a concentration of 5 x 10-5 to 1 x 10-3 m. It also requires 2.5 x 10-3 m glutathione. The enzyme displays maximum activity at pH 8.70 and at this pH has a Km value of about 0.53 m. At pH 7.4 it has a Km value of 0.039 m.

https://openalex.org/W1579912134,"Abstract The capacity of cell-free preparations of rat small intestinal mucosa to synthesize and release lipoproteins was investigated. Palmitate-1-14C was administered intragastrically and 30 min later labeled cell-free fractions from homogenates of intestinal mucosa were prepared. The fractions (whole homogenate, mitochondria, and microsomes) were incubated in fortified media containing 3H-labeled amino acids, and lipoproteins of various densities were separated, after the addition of carrier rat plasma, by density centrifugation, by polyanion precipitation, and by immunoprecipitation. All fractions incorporated radioactivity into the lipid and protein moieties of the medium lipoproteins. The activity of the microsomal fraction accounted for most of the activity of the whole homogenate. Presence of postmicrosomal supernatant or pH 5 fraction, GTP, ATP, and ATP-generating system was essential for optimal activity of the microsomal fraction. The ratio of 14C:3H of microsomal (solubilized by LiCl) and medium low density lipoprotein (LDL) isolated by ultracentrifugation, by precipitation with polyanions, or by immunoprecipitation remained within reasonably narrow limits. The identity of microsomal and medium LDL with that of plasma LDL was demonstrated by immunoelectrophoresis, double immunodiffusion, and peptide mapping. The results indicate that the cellular equivalent of the microsomal fraction may be the major site of synthesis and association of the lipid and protein moieties of LDL. They further indicate that the intestinal mucosa may contribute significantly to the level of plasma LDL and that through the incorporation of LDL apoprotein into chylomicrons and very low density lipoprotein it can be of central importance in the transport of exogenous and endogenous lipid."

https://openalex.org/W2268498875,"Abstract Regulatory interactions which relate small molecules and enzymes that are located in different sequences of biochemical reactions have been termed metabolic interlock. One of the simplest examples of the phenomenon occurs in the branching biochemical pathway for the synthesis of aromatic amino acids in Bacillus subtilis. Although prephenate dehydratase is not a member enzyme of the tryptophan-specific biosynthetic pathway, tryptophan inhibits the activity of prephenate dehydratase as effectively as the feedback inhibition exerted by phenylalanine. The inhibitions by tryptophan and phenylalanine are competitive with respect to prephenic acid, the substrate for the enzyme. Tyrosine, the end product of the third branch of the pathway, reverses the inhibition of prephenate dehydratase by tryptophan although it does not exhibit a strong allosteric effect alone. Several experiments showed that the allosteric specificities of prephenate dehydratase for tryptophan and tyrosine function in vivo. It was possible to show physiological conditions under which wild type cells were susceptible to growth inhibition by tryptophan. These conditions were equated with lower levels of intracellular tyrosine. More striking effects were noted by using mutant strains having a partial requirement for tyrosine. Hence, a mechanism appears to operate which decreases intracellular phenylalanine levels whenever intracellular levels of tyrosine are limiting or depleted. Methionine and leucine, allosteric activators of prephenate dehydratase, were found to reverse growth inhibition caused by tryptophan. The enzyme properties of several classes of mutants selected for resistance to growth inhibition by tryptophan are described."
https://openalex.org/W1567823102,"Abstract The preparation, composition, and some properties of rabbit thyroglobulin labeled in vivo with 125I are described. Thyroglobulin was digested with Pronase under conditions which released most of the monoiodotyrosine and diiodotyrosine as the free amino acids but left most of the thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine in peptide linkage. A fraction of this digest containing most of its iodine as iodothyronine was further separated by gel diffusion into seven iodopeptide fractions, in which T4, glutamic acid, serine, aspartic acid, and alanine were consistently the most frequent amino acids. One fraction containing equimolar amounts of serine and T4 was shown to be a seryl-T4 dipeptide. Additional fractionation of the digest on Dowex 1-X2 yielded eight T4 peptide fractions, in which the same five amino acids were again the most prominent constituents. A total of two-thirds of the T4 of thyroglobulin was accounted for in the peptide fractions studied. These findings indicate that in rabbit thyroglobulin T4 formation occurs principally at tyrosine residues within specific amino acid sequences rather than at random. The question of whether T4 is restricted to a unique sequence was explored indirectly by comparing the amino acid compositions of all the T4 peptide fractions. The sequence -Ala-Ser-T4-Glx-Asx- was the only one which could not be excluded by this approach. Thus, our findings are compatible with the possibility of a unique sequence, but a final answer must await direct sequencing of peptides obtained by more specific means."
https://openalex.org/W1548300662,"Abstract Two major components of carbonic anhydrase were purified from porcine red cells by column chromatography and electrofocusing techniques. Both forms behaved as single components in sedimentation velocity experiments and during starch gel electrophoresis. The observed molecular weight of both forms was about 3 x 104. On the basis of their specific CO2 hydrase activities and amino acid compositions, these two carbonic anhydrase isozymes were designated as high activity (carbonic anhydrase C) or low activity (carbonic anhydrase B) forms which appear to be homologous to the high and low activity carbonic anhydrases, respectively, of other mammals. When these pig B and C isozymes were compared with the red cell carbonic anhydrases of other ungulates (cattle and horse), several interesting features were observed. In contrast to the electrophoretic gel patterns of the horse B and C isozymes in which the C form is markedly more basic than the B form, the high activity C form of pig was observed to be more acidic than the low activity B form. The tryptic peptide map of bovine carbonic anhydrase appears to be more similar to that of porcine carbonic anhydrase C than to B, indicating that they are probably homologous proteins. Neoprontosil binding by the pig and horse B isozymes give rise to essentially identical spectra in the 425- to 600-mµ region, whereas the C isozymes, from these two sources, generate quite different spectra."

Approximately 30 percent of the plaque-forming cells in the spleen yielded plaques with immunoglobulin M antibody possessing the allotype of the RNA donor. The allotype of the RNA donor was also found in the IgG immunoglobulin of lymphoid cell lysates as well as in the IgG isolated from the serum. These results suggest that the injected RNA has an informational role in the in vivo synthesis of immunoglobulins by host lymphoid cells.

As an aid to this study, a mutant with diminished peptidase activity was isolated with the use of the reduced ability to cleave trilysine as a screening procedure. In this simplified system, the remaining enzymatic capacity to cleave lysine homopeptides was then characterized. On the basis of substrate specificities and cofactor requirements as well as resolution of the enzymes by ion exchange and Sephadex chromatography; it was shown that the mutant contains the following lysine peptidases: (a) a Co++-dependent peptidase capable of splitting dilysine, (b) an EDTA-sensitive peptidase specific for trilysine, and (c) an endopeptidase that can cleave tetralysine but has no activity toward di- or trilysine. The parental K-12 strain contains, in addition to these three activities, a metal-independent peptidase capable of cleaving all three lysine peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1592915998,"Abstract A proactivator for both human and bovine plasminogen was fractionated from human plasma or euglobulin by gel filtration. The proactivator, which was free from plasminogen, was purified by three passages through Sephadex G-200, two passages through Bio-Gel A-150m, and stepwise elution through DEAE-cellulose. The ionic strength of medium containing purified proactivator was decreased by dialysis, resulting in precipitation of proteins with little proactivator activity. The supernatant, approximately 5 times as pure as before dialysis, was concentrated and was gel-filtered through Sephadex G-200. The fractions of highest proactivator activity were shown to be in the fractionation range of Sephadex G-200, smaller than the exclusion limit of the gel. There was no cross reactivity with a highly purified preparation of human plasminogen in immunodiffusion tests. A mixture of the proactivator with streptokinase could not digest casein or the methyl ester of tosylarginine in the absence of plasminogen. Activator prepared from the proactivator had a stronger activator activity for bovine plasminogen than did complexes of streptokinase with plasmin and plasminogen. Small amounts of streptokinase converted the proactivator into activator, which in turn converted human plasminogen into plasmin; but the same amounts of streptokinase could scarcely activate plasminogen in the absence of added proactivator. Very large amounts of streptokinase, however, activated plasminogen equally well in the presence or absence of proactivator. In sharp contrast to caseinolysis, esterolysis of tosylarginine with plasminogen was unaffected by the presence or absence of the proactivator, regardless of how much streptokinase was added. The proactivator lost 60% of its activity by heating at 85° for 10 min, and almost 100% by heating for 20 min. It lost 50% of its activity in 30 min at pH 2, but was relatively stable at pH 11."

With these techniques an investigator can with limited budget, space, and personnel perform research using tissue culture systems."

https://openalex.org/W96856705,"A mutant of Streptococcus faecalis has been isolated which has a 20-fold higher growth requirement for l -glutamic acid than the parent strain. The ability to utilize l -glutamine for growth is not affected. The mutant also has a greater dependence than the parent strain on an external supply of vitamin B6. The rate of glutamic acid transport at low extracellular concentrations (0.05 m m ) was greatly reduced in the mutant but was only moderately affected at higher concentrations (5 m m ). In contrast to the parent, in which kinetic studies revealed the operation of a high affinity and a low affinity system for glutamic acid transport, the mutant possessed a single catalytic component with kinetic constants equal to those of the low affinity system. These findings and the greatly elevated growth requirement for glutamic acid indicate that the high affinity system is inactive in the mutant. The transport of aspartic acid and d -glutamic acid by the mutant were similarly adversely affected, whereas essentially identical kinetic constants for glutamine, α-aminoisobutyric acid, and cycloleucine transport were obtained for the mutant and parent strains. The absence of a functional high affinity dicarboxylic amino acid transport system in the mutant allowed a study of the specific properties of the low affinity system. In contrast to the parent strain, the initial rate of uptake of isotopically labeled glutamate in the mutant was not stimulated by glucose at any concentration. However, the accumulation of large amounts of this amino acid on extended incubation was dependent on an energy source. Glutamine competitively inhibited glutamic acid uptake in the mutant. There was no evidence that the mutant produced an inhibitor of the high affinity transport component."
https://openalex.org/W1546079657,"Abstract l-Histidine induces the formation of the four enzymes constituting the histidine-degrading pathway in Bacillus subtilis. Studies of the kinetics of induction of histidase and of FGA hydrolase demonstrated that the two enzymes appear after induction in sequence, separated by a 2-min interval. The results of experiments in which chloramphenicol was used to arrest peptide bond formation indicate that both enzymes are first formed as enzymatically inactive precursors. The basis for the sequential appearance of these enzymes and of their precursors was shown to be the sequential appearance of their respective enzyme-forming capacities. Experiments using rifampicin, an inhibitor of the initiation of transcription, provide good evidence that the synthesis of messenger RNA specifying both enzymes is initiated upon addition of the inducer. These findings support the hypothesis that the structural genes of the two enzymes are transcribed into a single polycistronic messenger."
https://openalex.org/W1563059574,"Abstract Extracellular penicillinase from Bacillus cereus 569 was found to exist in two states, an iodine-sensitive state and an iodine-insensitive state. Iodine-sensitive penicillinase is inactivated by 2.5 x 10-3 m iodine within 1 min, while the iodine-insensitive enzyme is inactivated at a much slower rate. Approximately 20% of the extracellular penicillinase activity found in crude or partially purified preparations of penicillinase is iodine-sensitive. The two states of penicillinase were shown to be interconvertible. In the presence of saturated ammonium sulfate, penicillinase is converted quantitatively into the iodine-sensitive state, and, upon removal of the ammonium sulfate, it spontaneously reverts to the iodine-insensitive state. It is concluded that α- and γ-penicillinase correspond to the iodine-insensitive and iodine-sensitive penicillinases, respectively, and that the two penicillinases are different states of the same enzyme in dynamic equilibrium. The relative proportion of the two states depends upon the conditions imposed upon the enzyme preparation."

https://openalex.org/W2033441700,"Increased concentrations of immunoglobulin M have been found in the circulation of approximately half of patients with either endemic or sporadic nontoxic goiter. Blood was obtained from patients in several iodine-deficient goitrous areas; the patients with sporadic goiter resided in or about New York City. Concentrations of immunoglobulins G, A, and D were normal. Blood for control purposes was taken from patients residing in cities near the goiter areas where there was no iodine deficiency, and in New York City. Most of these samples came from hospitalized patients without known thyroid disease and were collected at random. Chi-square values for the difference between the number of goitrous patients with elevated concentrations of immunoglobulin M and those in the control patients were highly significant statistically."
