The IgA against intestinal commensal bacterial antigens was analyzed; it was not simply ""natural antibody"" but was specifically induced and responded to antigenic changes within an established gut flora. In contrast to IgA responses against exotoxins, a significant proportion of this specific anti-commensal IgA induction was through a pathway that was independent of T cell help and of follicular lymphoid tissue organization, which may reflect an evolutionarily primitive form of specific immune defense."

https://openalex.org/W2136479627,"A faunal record of sea-surface temperature (SST) variations off West Africa documents a series of abrupt, millennial-scale cooling events, which punctuated the Holocene warm period. These events evidently resulted from increased southward advection of cooler temperate or subpolar waters to this subtropical location or from enhanced regional upwelling. The most recent of these events was the Little Ice Age, which occurred between 1300 to 1850 A.D., when subtropical SSTs were reduced by 3° to 4°C. These events were synchronous with Holocene changes in subpolar North Atlantic SSTs, documenting a strong, in-phase link between millennial-scale variations in high- and low-latitude climate during the Holocene."

https://openalex.org/W3104501717,"The Kondo effect is a key many-body phenomenon in condensed matter physics. It concerns the interaction between a localised spin and free electrons. Discovered in metals containing small amounts of magnetic impurities, it is now a fundamental mechanism in a wide class of correlated electron systems. Control over single, localised spins has become relevant also in fabricated structures due to the rapid developments in nano-electronics. Experiments have already demonstrated artificial realisations of isolated magnetic impurities at metallic surfaces, nanometer-scale magnets, controlled transitions between two-electron singlet and triplet states, and a tunable Kondo effect in semiconductor quantum dots. Here, we report an unexpected Kondo effect realised in a few-electron quantum dot containing singlet and triplet spin states whose energy difference can be tuned with a magnetic field. This effect occurs for an even number of electrons at the degeneracy between singlet and triplet states. The characteristic energy scale is found to be much larger than for the ordinary spin-1/2 case."

However, regulation of CENP-A localization and its role have not been clear. Here we report that the fission yeast homolog SpCENP-A is essential for establishing centromere chromatin associated with equal chromosome segregation. SpCENP-A binding to the nonrepetitious inner centromeres depended on Mis6, an essential centromere connector protein acting during G1-S phase of the cell cycle. Mis6 is likely required for recruiting SpCENP-A to form proper connection of sister centromeres."

The ferroelectric polarization results from spontaneous polar symmetry breaking in a fluid smectic. The ferroelectric phase is also chiral, resulting in the formation of a mixture of macroscopic domains of either handedness at the isotropic-to-liquid crystal phase transition. This smectic liquid crystal is thus a fluid conglomerate. Detailed investigation of the electrooptic and polarization current behavior within individual domains in liquid crystal cells shows the thermodynamically stable structure to be a uniformly tilted smectic bow-phase (banana phase), with all layer pairs homochiral and ferroelectric (SmC S P F )."

https://openalex.org/W2139818451,"Dorsal-ventral patterning in vertebrate and Drosophila embryos requires a conserved system of extracellular proteins to generate a positional information gradient. The components involved include bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP/Dpp), a BMP antagonist (Chordin/Short gastrulation; Chd/Sog) and a secreted metalloproteinase (Xolloid/Tolloid) that cleaves Chd/Sog. Here we describe Xenopus Twisted gastrulation (xTsg), another member of this signalling pathway. xTsg is expressed ventrally as part of the BMP-4 synexpression group and encodes a secreted BMP-binding protein that is a BMP signalling agonist. The data suggest a molecular mechanism by which xTsg dislodges latent BMPs bound to Chordin BMP-binding fragments generated by Xolloid cleavage, providing a permissive signal that allows high BMP signalling in the embryo. Drosophila Tsg also binds BMPs and is expressed dorsally, supporting the proposal that the dorsal-ventral axis was inverted in the course of animal evolution."

https://openalex.org/W2040804871,"Neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2) is a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) PAS domain transcription factor expressed in multiple regions of the vertebrate brain. Targeted insertion of a beta-galactosidase reporter gene (lacZ) resulted in the production of an NPAS2-lacZ fusion protein and an altered form of NPAS2 lacking the bHLH domain. The neuroanatomical expression pattern of NPAS2-lacZ was temporally and spatially coincident with formation of the mature frontal association/limbic forebrain pathway. NPAS2-deficient mice were subjected to a series of behavioral tests and were found to exhibit deficits in the long-term memory arm of the cued and contextual fear task. Thus, NPAS2 may serve a dedicated regulatory role in the acquisition of specific types of memory."

Bleaching of diazoketo rhodopsin (DK-Rh) containing 11-cis-3-diazo-4-oxo-retinal yields batho-, lumi-, meta-I-, and meta-II-Rh intermediates corresponding to those of native Rh but at lower temperatures. Photoaffinity labeling of DK-Rh and these bleaching intermediates shows that the ionone ring cross-links to tryptophan-265 on helix F in DK-Rh and batho-Rh, and to alanine-169 on helix D in lumi-, meta-I-, and meta-II-Rh intermediates. It is likely that these movements involving a flip-over of the chromophoric ring trigger changes in cytoplasmic membrane loops resulting in heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein) activation."

We predict that there are approximately 900 NEAs with absolute magnitude less than 18 (that is, kilometer-sized), of which 29, 65, and 6% reside on Amor, Apollo, and Aten orbits, respectively. These results suggest that roughly 40% of the kilometer-sized NEAs have been found. The remainder, on highly eccentric and inclined orbits, are more difficult to detect."

We used a complementary DNA subtraction method, representational display analysis, to show that the small guanosine triphosphatase Rac2 is expressed selectively in murine TH1 cells. Rac induces the interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) promoter through cooperative activation of the nuclear factor kappa B and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Tetracycline-regulated transgenic mice expressing constitutively active Rac2 in T cells exhibited enhanced IFN-gamma production. Dominant-negative Rac inhibited IFN-gamma production in murine T cells. Moreover, T cells from Rac2-/- mice showed decreased IFN-gamma production under TH1 conditions in vitro. Thus, Rac2 activates TH1-specific signaling and IFN-gamma gene expression."

This report delineates and fits to experimental data a new model of this process, in which specific tropomyosin-actin interactions are important, the tropomyosin-tropomyosin polymer is continuous rather than disjointed, and tropomyosin affects myosin-actin binding by shifting among three positions as in recent structural studies. A myosin- and tropomyosin-induced conformational change in actin is proposed, rationalizing the ∼10,000-fold strengthening effect of myosin on tropomyosin-actin binding. Also, myosin S1 binding to regulated filaments containing mutant tropomyosins with internal deletions exhibited exaggerated cooperativity, implying an allosteric effect of tropomyosin on actin and allowing the effect's measurement. Comparisons among the mutants suggest the change in actin is promoted much more strongly by the middle of tropomyosin than by its ends. Regardless of calcium binding to troponin, this change in actin facilitates the shift in tropomyosin position to the actin inner domain, which is required for tight myosin-actin association. It also increases myosin-actin affinity 7-fold compared with the absence of troponin-tropomyosin.

Contraction is activated very cooperatively by Ca2+ binding to the thin filament protein troponin, and the binding of myosin S1 to actin on the thin filament is also very cooperative, especially in the absence of Ca2+ (reviewed in Refs. 1Tobacman L.S.

The sharpness of these transitions suggests that the thin filament undergoes abrupt conformational change(s) that are promoted by Ca2+ and myosin. Experimental and theoretical efforts have been made to understand this for several decades (3Hill T.L. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1325) Google Scholar, 11Rayment I. Holden H.M. Whittaker M. Yohn C.B. Lorenz M. Holmes K.C. Milligan R.A. Science. 1993; 261: 58-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar) and improved data on thin filament conformational states (12Holmes K.C. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 2-7PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lehman W. Craig R. Vibert P. Nature. 1994; 368: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 14Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Tropomyosin internal deletion mutants that span four or five rather than the usual seven actins have provided unexpected insights into thin filament-mediated regulation (15Landis C.A. Bobkova A. Homsher E. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14051-14056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Ca2+ binding to troponin induces normal repositioning of tropomyosin on actin in such mutant filaments. Nevertheless, myosin cycling is inhibited in the presence of Ca2+, and regulatory protein binding to actin is destabilized by the mutations when and only when myosin is present (16Rosol M. Lehman W. Craig R. Landis C. Butters C. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 908-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar,17Landis C.A. Back N. Homsher E. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31279-31285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In the present report, myosin S1-thin filament binding is examined and found to exhibit very exaggerated cooperativity in the presence of these mutant tropomyosins. Based upon these data and work in the literature, a new model of myosin-thin filament binding is proposed. Finally, the model and experimental results are used to elucidate the regulatory behavior of normal thin filaments. In 1997 three conformations of the thin filament were identified using electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstructions of actin-myosin S1 filaments in the presence of tropomyosin and of actin-troponin-tropomyosin filaments ± Ca2+ (14Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). As Ca2+ and then myosin bind to regulated thin filaments, the azimuthal position of tropomyosin on the actin filament shifts in two steps, with increasing exposure of the myosin-binding site on actin. These data suggested that any analysis of cooperative myosin-thin filament binding should include three tropomyosin positions as a critical component. Geeves and co-workers (8McKillop D.F.A. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar) presciently described many features of such a model in 1993 and used kinetic and equilibrium binding data to measure transitions among three thin filament states, termed blocked, closed, and open with respect to myosin binding. The current report presents a new model that includes three positions for tropomyosin but otherwise is a significant departure from previous analyses. Myosin and tropomyosin strongly promote each other's binding to actin (18Eaton B.L. Science. 1976; 192: 1337-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 19Cassell M. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol.

A. 1980; 77: 2616-2620Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), indicating either direct interactions between them or indirect interactions mediated by a conformational change in actin. A conformational change in actin is a central feature of the new analysis, with implications regarding different interactions of myosin with unregulated actin, regulated actin, and regulated actin that is partially saturated with myosin (7Bremel R.D. Weber A. Nat. New Biol. 1972; 238: 97-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 9Trybus K.M. Taylor E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8073-8080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific tropomyosin-actin interactions are identified experimentally and then emphasized in the model, in contrast to previous treatments. Also, the polymerized tropomyosin strand is properly analyzed as continuous, rather than as functionally affecting discrete units of seven actins. Detailed predictions are derived by the statistical weight matrix method (24Hill T.L. Cooperativity Theory in Biochemistry: Steady State and Equilibrium Systems. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York1985: 321-369Crossref Google Scholar) for obtaining the thin filament partition function. The results offer a new perspective on the regulation of striated muscle contraction. Rabbit fast skeletal muscle myosin S1 (25Weeds A.G. Taylor R.S.

A panel of six recombinant rat striated muscle α-tropomyosins were expressed in DE3(BL21) cells using the vector pET3d and purified to homogeneity (15Landis C.A. Bobkova A. Homsher E. Tobacman L.S.

Lataro R.C. Ferro J.A. Reinach F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10461-10466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The panel includes full-length tropomyosin (Ala-Ser Tm)1 and five internal deletion mutants as follows: Δ23Tm, Δ34Tm, Δ234Tm, Δ345Tm, and Δ456Tm. The first two of these listed mutants span five actins as a result of the deletion of 77 residues, and the remaining three mutants span four actins as a result of the deletion of 119 residues. By numbering according to the rat sequence, the deletions are as follows: Gln-47 through Ser-123 (Δ23Tm), Asn-89 through Val-165 (Δ34Tm), Gln-47 through Val-165 (Δ234Tm), Asn-89 through Leu-207 (Δ345Tm), and Glu-124 through Ala-242 (Δ456Tm). As described previously (16Rosol M. Lehman W. Craig R. Landis C. Butters C. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 908-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), steady state fluorescence of actin labeled on Cys374 withN-(1-pyrenyl)iodoacetamide was monitored during manual myosin S1 titrations. 3 to 5 titrations were averaged for each condition. Conditions: 25 °C, 20 mm imidazole (pH 7.5), 125 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm ADP, 1 μmactin, 0.5 μm troponin, 0.5 μm tropomyosin, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 14 units/ml hexokinase, 1 mm glucose, 20 μm Ap5A, 0.5 mm EGTA, and either 0 or 0.6 mmCaCl2. Titrations were also performed in the presence of lower ADP concentration to determine the maximal fluorescence change for a myosin-saturated thin filament, an 85% decrease in intensity. Protein concentrations were corrected for dilution (<8%), and the free myosin S1 concentration was calculated by subtracting the fluorescence-determined bound concentration from the total. Nonlinear least squares curve-fitting was performed with SCIENTIST (Micromath). Fig.1 schematically illustrates three tropomyosin positions on actin as follows: (i) on the outer domain in the absence of Ca2+, a position which blocks strong myosin binding; (ii) near the boundary between the inner and outer domains in the presence of Ca2+; (iii) on the inner domain when myosin is bound strongly to actin, regardless whether Ca2+ is present. Additionally, the scheme includes a novel feature designed to account for positively cooperative interactions between myosin and tropomyosin. Myosin S1 binds to actin-tropomyosin filaments, or to actin-troponin-tropomyosin filaments, with an affinity 4–7-fold higher than to bare actin (20Geeves M.A. Halsall D.J. Proc. R. Soc. Lond. Ser. B Biol. Sci. 1986; 229: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 22Williams D.L. Greene L.E. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2770-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Correspondingly, myosin S1 must increase the actin affinity of tropomyosin (or of troponin-tropomyosin) by 47–77-fold, i.e. 10,000-fold or more. This very high affinity binding has experimental support (18Eaton B.L. Science. 1976; 192: 1337-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar,19Cassell M. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12867-12872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and any convincing model should be consistent with this evidence that myosin and tropomyosin interact, either directly or indirectly. To explain this, the model invokes a conformational change in actin that is promoted both by myosin and by specific interactions between tropomyosin and the actin inner domain (15Landis C.A. Bobkova A. Homsher E. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14051-14056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Rosol M. Lehman W. Craig R. Landis C. Butters C. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 908-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This change in actin is schematically indicated by a shading of the surface of subdomain 3 in the figure, because thin filament reconstructions indicate that myosin S1 contacts the edge of this subdomain, where tropomyosin is also bound (14Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Some effect of myosin on actin atomic structure must occur and has been spectroscopically detected (29Kouyama T. Mihashi K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 114: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar, 30Feng L. Kim E. Lee W.-L. Miller C.J. Kuang B. Reisler E. Rubenstein P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16829-16837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 31Prochniewicz E. Thomas D.D. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 14860-14867Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), but high resolution data to define this effect are lacking. The assumption in the model is that myosin causes the same effects on actin, regardless of the presence of the regulatory proteins. When tropomyosin is located on the actin inner domain, it is proposed to promote all or part of the same changes in actin. For example, tropomyosin-induced movements of actin subdomain 3 surface residues might increase myosin binding to actin by 4–7-fold. Fig. 2 provides qualitative support for a conformational change in actin, as discussed below.Figure 2Tropomyosin internal deletion mutations cause myosin S1 binding to the thin filament to be highly cooperative in the presence of Ca2+. Myosin S1 binding to the thin filament was monitored using pyrene-labeled actin. Thin filaments contained saturating concentrations of Ca2+, troponin, and either full-length tropomyosin (Ala-Ser Tm) or internal deletion mutant tropomyosin (ΔTms; see text). Binding was also measured for actin-only filaments; data points are omitted to avoid obscuring the other data sets. Lines use Table I parameters.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The bottom of Fig. 1 shows a two-step energeticpath for myosin S1 binding to unregulated actin. (This is not a proposed kinetic pathway.)K T 0 describes the (unfavorable) equilibrium for bare actin to undergo the same conformational change that tropomyosin induces when present. Myosin S1 binding then follows with the same affinity, K S1, as it has for the active state of a regulated filament. The observed binding constant of myosin S1 for bare actin can be considered the productK T 0 K S1. The equilibrium constants illustrated in Fig. 1 are defined as per actin constants for transitions of entire filaments from one state to another. Definitions therefore include contributions due to changes in site-site interaction strength that may accompany such transitions. Actual filaments are assumed to undergo partial transitions.K T describes the average equilibrium for activation of the filament, from the Ca2+ state to the active state, including the conformational change in actin. L C concerns a shift in tropomyosin position (away from the inner domain) in the absence of a conformational change in actin. Larger L C corresponds to a smaller population of the illustrated intermediate state. The productK T L C describes the equilibrium constant for the activating conformational change in actin, once tropomyosin is located on the inner domain. Ca2+ binding to troponin is critical to muscle regulation, and this event is proposed to affect selected equilibria. In the absence of Ca2+ tropomyosin is in a position that blocks strong myosin binding to actin, and L B describes the equilibrium constant holding tropomyosin away from the inner domain in the absence of Ca2+. Because of troponin I-actin interactions, L B is expected to be larger thanL C when the model is fit to experiment. On the other hand, once tropomyosin is on the inner domain the conformational change in actin is attributed to tropomyosin-actin interactions, and so this equilibrium constant (K T L C ) is assumed to be unaffected by Ca2+, as is the final step of myosin binding, K S1. Finally, the schematic shows no inter-conversion between the blocked and Ca2+-induced states (unless Ca2+ binds or dissociates). This indicates the simplifying assumption that the distribution between these two states is strongly biased in one direction or the other. This simplification is very useful analytically but could be relaxed in a future treatment. It has strong support in the presence of Ca2+. (i) Rapid myosin S1 binding to thin filaments in the presence of Ca2+ implies that the blocked state is sparsely populated (8McKillop D.F.A. Geeves M.A. Biophys. J. 1993; 65: 693-701Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 9Trybus K.M. Taylor E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 7209-7213Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). (ii) Thin filament helical reconstructions indicate tropomyosin is not in a blocking, outer domain location under these conditions (13Lehman W. Craig R. Vibert P. Nature. 1994; 368: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). In the absence of Ca2+ the simplification is more uncertain (see below) but has the following support. (i) Specific interactions between troponin I and actin are believed to hold tropomyosin on the outer domain in the absence of Ca2+ (reviewed in Ref. 1Tobacman L.S. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 447-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). (ii) Thin filament helical reconstructions indicate tropomyosin is on the outer domain under these conditions (13Lehman W. Craig R. Vibert P. Nature. 1994; 368: 65-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Several transitions are defined by Fig. 1, but few of them are plausible sources of cooperativity. The mechanism proposed in the model is that multiple shifts of tropomyosin on actin cause an energetic penalty or strain relative to fewer shifts, of magnitude RT ln(Y) for each shift back and forth. This differs from Y in Hillet al. (3Hill T.L. Eisenberg E. Greene L.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3186-3190Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) in that shifts can occur for segments of the tropomyosin strand spanning any number of actins, rather than multiples of seven actins. Y includes any effect of strain within the tropomyosin itself. The magnitude of this component is inversely affected by the degree of tropomyosin flexibility. The other, perhaps larger contribution to Y, is strain on tropomyosin-actin interactions, particularly strain on the specific interactions between tropomyosin and active-state actin. The only other possible sources of cooperativity are myosin-myosin interactions (transition K S1) and/or actin-actin interactions (transition K T L C ). These are rejected because myosin S1 binding to bare actin is not cooperative (22Williams D.L. Greene L.E. Biochemistry. 1983; 22: 2770-2774Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 32Orlova A. Egelman E.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 265: 469-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). If either of these processes contributed to cooperative myosin S1 binding to the regulated thin filament, then they would also be expected to produce cooperativity in myosin S1 binding to bare actin. Troponin is located at every seventh actin along the thin filament, and influential previous models of activation represented thin filament transitions as occurring simultaneously in units of seven actins. However, this premise is not in agreement with significant aspects of thin filament structure. Tropomyosin forms a continuous strand along the actin filament, with end-to-end overlaps of successive tropomyosins (5Phillips Jr., G.N. Fillers J.P. Cohen C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 111-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) that are further strengthened by the tail region of troponin (33White S.P. Cohen C. Phillips Jr., G.N. Nature. 1987; 325: 826-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). There is no evidence that end-to-end interactions are interrupted as tropomyosin moves on the surface of actin, particularly in the presence of Ca2+, a condition in which myosin causes only a small shift in tropomyosin position. Therefore, the current model treats the thin filament as an actin monomer chain, with conformational change propagated by the continuous tropomyosin strand from one actin to the next. The critical distinction of this new approach is that myosin binding to an actin monomer affects the likelihood of myosin binding to any nearby monomer, rather than selectively to monomers that happen to contact the same tropomyosin molecule or that happen to be in the same “apparent cooperative unit” (34Geeves M.A. Lehrer S.S. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). In the presence of Ca2+, each actin on the thin filament can be in any of four states illustrated in Fig. 1,i.e. any state except the blocked state. For a filament N actins long, there are 4 N possible thin filament configurations, existing in proportions defined by the equilibrium constants described above and the myosin S1 concentration. The partition function, ξ, is a summation of all these configurations, weighted according to their relative proportions. Average properties such as binding saturation are straightforward to calculate from ξ, in the same manner that a binding polynomial is used for a small system. The frequency of any filament configuration depends upon the equilibria defined in Fig. 1 but also depends upon the number of times tropomyosin shifts back and forth on actin. By using the matrix method (24Hill T.L. Cooperativity Theory in Biochemistry: Steady State and Equilibrium Systems. Springer-Verlag Inc., New York1985: 321-369Crossref Google Scholar), the probability-weighted states at an index actin are multiplied repetitively by the similarly weighted states at successive actins, keeping track of statistical penalties due to changes in tropomyosin position. The partition function is shown in Equation1: ξ=Tr([1/LC+KT(1+KS1S1)]1/Y1/21/LC+KT(1+KS1S1)1/Y1/2)NEquation 1 For large N, ξ ≈ λmax N , where λmax is the larger of the two eigen values of the matrix. Solving the characteristic equation of the matrix, 2λmax=1+1/LC+KT(1+KS1S1)+,Equation 2 where ={[1−1/LC−KT(1+KS1S1)]2+4[1/LC+KT(1+KS1S1)]2/Y}1/2From the partition function one can immediately derive fractional saturation with myosin S1 (θ S1) as shown in Equation 3, θS1=1NS1ξ∂ξ∂S1=S1λmax∂λmax∂S1Equation 3 =KTKS1S11+[2/Y−1+1/LC+KT(1+KS1S1)]÷1+1/LC+KT(1+KS1S1)+The partition function is an N th order polynomial not only in S1 but also in K T and in 1/L C . This allows the derivation of the fraction of sites in the active state (θactive), the intermediate state (θintermediate), and the Ca2+ state (θCa2+) (see Equations Equation 4, Equation 5, Equation 6), θactive=KTλmax∂λmax∂KTEquation 4 =KT(1+KS1S1)1+[1/LC−1+KT(1+KS1S1)+2/Y]/1+1/LC+KT(1+KS1S1)+ θintermediateEquation 5 =1LCλmax∂λmax∂(1/LC)=1+[1/LC−1+KT(1+KS1S1)+2/Y]/1+1/LC+KT(1+KS1S1)+/LC θCa2+=1−θactive−θintermediateEquation 6 Equations Equation 3, Equation 4, Equation 5 remain applicable in the absence of Ca2+, but with L B andK T L C /L B substituted for L C and K T , respectively. Equation 6 then yields θBlocked rather than θCa2+. Binding of myosin S1 to the thin filament was determined for actin-troponin-Ca2+-tropomyosin filaments containing either full-length tropomyosin (Ala-Ser Tm) or tropomyosin internal deletion mutants (Fig. 2). These internal deletion mutants selectively and profoundly inhibit tropomyosin binding to myosin S1-decorated actin (17Landis C.A. Back N. Homsher E. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31279-31285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), so correspondingly they were expected to alter myosin binding to regulated actin. This prediction was confirmed previously for mutant Δ234Tm (16Rosol M. Lehman W. Craig R. Landis C. Butters C. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 908-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and Fig. 2 shows that it is true generally for the deletion mutant tropomyosins. These mutants lack either two or three of the seven quasi-repeating regions of tropomyosin (5Phillips Jr., G.N. Fillers J.P. Cohen C. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 192: 111-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), due to deletions of either 84 or 119 amino acids. They span five or four actins instead of seven and are designated according to which repeating regions are missing. For example, residues 47–165 are deleted in Δ234Tm, which lacks regions 2–4. The deletions greatly weakened the initial portions of the binding curves, had little effect on the upper portions of the curves, and dramatically increased cooperativity. This is particularly worth noting for filaments with deletion mutant Δ234Tm, because electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction have been performed using these filaments and indicate that tropomyosin is in the Ca2+-induced position (16Rosol M. Lehman W. Craig R. Landis C. Butters C. Tobacman L.S. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 908-917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, the S-shaped curves imply abrupt transitions from the Ca2+-induced state to the active state. As noted above, either myosin and tropomyosin interact directly when bound to actin to strengthen each other's binding or else they indirectly interact via a change in actin. Data using the deletion mutants strongly imply that the latter is the case. In Fig. 2, myosin binding to filaments containing full-length tropomyosin is 7-fold tighter than to bare actin filaments. If this were caused by direct tropomyosin-myosin interactions, then the deletions (which impair tropomyosin binding to acto-myosin by 1–3 orders of magnitude (17Landis C.A. Back N. Homsher E. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31279-31285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar)) would simply weaken myosin S1 binding to the thin filament, producing patterns more closely resembling that for bare actin. Instead the deletions increased cooperativity, and more importantly, in the presence of sufficient myosin S1 concentrations the mutant filaments exhibited much tighter myosin binding than did bare actin (Fig. 2). This behavior cannot be explained by deletion of direct interaction sites. Rather, it implies an allosteric mechanism involving a conformational change in actin as proposed in the model. Functional differences have long been noted among actin alone, regulated actin in the presence of Ca2+, and regulated actin that is partially saturated with myosin (7Bremel R.D. Weber A. Nat.

https://openalex.org/W2022323553,"In Caenorhabditis elegans, the gonad acquires two U-shaped arms by the directed migration of its distal tip cells (DTCs) along the body wall basement membranes. Correct migration of DTCs requires the mig-17 gene, which encodes a member of the metalloprotease-disintegrin protein family. The MIG-17 protein is secreted from muscle cells of the body wall and localizes in the basement membranes of gonad. This localization is dependent on the disintegrin-like domain of MIG-17 and its catalytic activity. These results suggest that the MIG-17 metalloprotease directs migration of DTCs by remodeling the basement membrane."

The fibers grew quasi-continuously through a protracted deformation history between 87 and 50 million years ago, over a period comparable to that of an orogeny. During a short interval between 66 and 62 million years, a rise in strain rate from 1.1 x 10(-15) to 7. 7 x 10(-15) seconds(-1) occurred.

The bulk of the results indicated that CDP/CUT expression or activity may be restricted to proliferating cells. Accordingly, many of the identified targets of CDP/CUT are genes that are repressed in proliferating precursor cells and are turned on as cells become terminally differentiated and CDP/CUT activity ceases (1Barberis A.

Sequence homology between Drosophila and mammalian CUT proteins is limited to five evolutionarily conserved domains: a region predicted to form a coiled-coil structure, three regions of ∼70 amino acids, three CUT repeats (CR1, CR2, and CR3, which share from 52 to 63% amino acid identity with each other), and a CUT-type homeodomain (HD) (4Blochlinger K.

Genet. 1992; 1: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The high degree of conservation of CUT repeats suggested that they may have an important biochemical function. Indeed, CUT repeats were found to function as specific DNA-binding domains (33Andres V. Chiara M.D. Mahdavi V. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 34Aufiero B.

CDP/CUT proteins therefore are unique in that they contain four DNA-binding domains: the CUT homeodomain and the three CUT repeats. The available data suggest that CDP/CUT has the capability to bind to a wide range of DNA sequences. Reported binding sites include sequences related to CCAAT, ATCGAT, Sp1 sites, and AT-rich matrix attachment regions (23Wang Z. Goldstein A. Zong R.T. Lin D. Neufeld E.J. Scheuermann R.H. Tucker P.W.

On the other hand, PCR-mediated site selection with GST fusion proteins containing various CDP/CUT DNA-binding domains led to the isolation of several types of sequences that could be aligned with either ATNNAT (mainly ATCGAT) or CCAAT. However, a sizable fraction of the selected sequences (∼20%) diverged greatly from these consensus sequences and yet represented excellent binding sites (33Andres V. Chiara M.D. Mahdavi V.

This property may not be unique to CDP/CUT proteins, as a similar relaxed sequence specificity was found for the GATA factors when submitted to PCR-mediated site selection (40Ko L.J. Engel J.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4011-4022Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar, 41Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3999-4010Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The evolutionary conservation of four DNA-binding domains within the same protein strongly suggests that this peculiar organization permits the execution of functions that could not otherwise be fulfilled. At this point, however, it is not well understood how CDP/CUT proteins interact with DNA. So far, DNA binding by CUT repeats has been investigated using glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins, which exist as dimers (33Andres V. Chiara M.D. Mahdavi V. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 34Aufiero B. Neufeld E.J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1995; 15: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). It has not been convincingly demonstrated whether each CUT repeat can bind DNA as a monomer or whether it requires cooperation with another CUT repeat or with the CUT homeodomain. As a monomer, CR3 was shown to cooperate with the CUT homeodomain to bind to DNA with high affinity and specificity (35Harada R. Dufort D. Denis-Larose C. Nepveu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2062-2067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Harada R. Berube G. Tamplin O.J. Denis-Larose C. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), yet it is not known whether CR1 and CR2 can cooperate with each other or with the CUT homeodomain. If this were the case, we could extrapolate that various combinations of CUT repeats and the CUT homeodomain may confer to the protein the capacity to interact with a large spectrum of DNA sequences. Moreover, if CDP/CUT proteins were capable of binding simultaneously to multiple binding sites, then cooperativity should increase the overall affinity for a given DNA segment. Another issue that remains to be investigated is which of the four CDP/CUT DNA-binding domains are responsible for the CCAAT displacement activity and what are the DNA sequence requirements for this activity to take place. To begin to decipher the various modes of interaction of CDP/CUT with DNA, we have expressed each CUT repeat as a monomer, either alone or with another CUT repeat or the CUT homeodomain. As monomers, either two CUT repeats or one CUT repeat and the CUT homeodomain were required for efficient DNA binding. The DNA-binding properties of the most efficient combinations (CR1+2 and CR3HD) were characterized and compared with that of the full-length CDP/CUT protein. We then defined the DNA sequence requirement for the CCAAT displacement activity and investigated the contribution of each domain to this activity. In contrast to what was previously reported, our results demonstrate that CR1 and CR2 are responsible for the CCAAT displacement activity, without the participation of the CUT homeodomain. A model is presented to illustrate the known CDP/CUT DNA-binding activities. Plasmids for expression of histidine-tagged fusion proteins were prepared by inserting various fragments from the human CDP/CUT cDNA (GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number M74099) into the bacterial expression vector pET-15b (Novagen) (5Neufeld E.J. Skalnik D.G. Lievens P.M. Orkin S.H. Nat. Genet. 1992; 1: 50-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar): CR1, nt 1605–2019 into the XhoI site of pET-15b; CR2, nt 2861–3153 into the XhoI site of pET-15b; CR1HD and CR2HD, a fragment encoding the homeodomain (nt 3737–3949) placed in frame at the carboxyl terminus of His-tagged CR1 and CR2 into the vectors described above, respectively; CR1+2, nt 1694–3127 into the BamHI site of pET-15b; and CR2+3, nt 2861–3737 into the BamHI site of pET-15b. For CR1-L-L-HD, three separate fragments (nt 1694–2853, 3071–3409, and 3673–3963) were placed in frame into the XhoI site of pET-15b. For CR2-L-HD, two fragments (nt 2853–3409 and 3673–3963) were placed in frame into the BamHI site of pET-15b. The MBP-CR3 and MBP-CR3HD vectors have previously been described (36Harada R. Berube G. Tamplin O.J. Denis-Larose C. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). MBP-CR1 was prepared by inserting nt 1605–2019 into the pMal-C2 plasmid (New England Biolabs Inc.). For expression of the full-length CDP/CUT protein in Sf9 insect cells, nt 27–5101 were inserted into pBlueBac His2b (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid was cotransfected with a helper plasmid to obtain baculoviruses expressing CDP/CUT. pET-15b- and pMal-C2-derived vectors were introduced into the BL21(DE3) or DH5 strain of Escherichia coli and induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Sf9 insect cells were infected with baculovirus encoding His-tagged CDP/CUT and incubated for 3 days. The fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography following procedures recommended by the suppliers (Invitrogen). EMSAs were performed with either 10 ng of purified fusion protein or 5 μg of nuclear extract from mammalian cells. The samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 min in a final volume of 30 μl of 25 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mmMgCl2, 5 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 5% of glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol with 30 ng of poly(dI·dC) and 3 μg of bovine serum albumin as nonspecific competitors. End-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (∼10 pg) were added and further incubated for 15 min at room temperature. Samples were loaded on a 5 or 4% polyacrylamide gel (30:1) and separated by electrophoresis at 8 V/cm in 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA. Gels were dried and visualized by autoradiography. The sequences of oligonucleotides used in this study are as follows: 29FP, TCGAGACGGTATCGATAAGCTTCTTTTC; “CGGTATCGAT,” same as 29FP; “CGATATCGAT,” TCGAGAAAAGAAGCTTATCGATATCGTC; “GGGCATCGAT,” TCGAGAAAAGAAGCTTATCGATGCCCT; N11, ACGCGATCGATATTTCGAATTCGCC; N15, CTAGATCGATATTTAGTTCGAATTCG; N19, CTAGATCGATATTTAGTTCGTTCGAATTCG; N21, CTAGATCGATATTTAGAGATCTCGTTCGAATTCG; “CGAATTCG,” TCGACTTGTCATTGGCGAATTAGAACACGCA; “CCAAT,” TCGAGAAAAGAACAACCAATCACCCGTC; and “CCAAT–CGAT,” TCGAGAAAAGAACAACCAATCACCGATC. Binding site selections were performed essentially as described previously using 50 ng of His-tagged CR1+2 fusion protein in the first selection cycle and then 10 ng in the subsequent cycles (36Harada R. Berube G. Tamplin O.J. Denis-Larose C. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 42Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). The sequence of the oligonucleotide used was 5′-AGACCTGCAGTCTGC(N)15CTGTCGTCTAGAGGA-3′. Protein·DNA complexes were separated from the free oligonucleotides by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel (30:1). After the fifth cycle, the PCR products were digested withPstI and XbaI and cloned into the plasmid pBluescript KS (Stratagene). Sequencing of the inserts were performed with the T7 polymerase sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). To determine the dissociation constant (K D), EMSAs were performed essentially as described above, but using a fixed amount of DNA (10 pm) and a wide range of protein concentrations with the following modifications: <10 pm DNA was used, and protein and DNA were incubated for 15 min at room temperature. The binding affinity (K D) was calculated using the method described by Carey (43Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 44Carey J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 975-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The amount of free and bound DNAs was quantitated by scanning of the autoradiograms on a PhosphorImager (Fuji). Scintillation counting of the excised bands in one case gave similar results. The data were plotted as the fraction of free DNA versus log of protein concentration. Since the protein concentrations did not take into account the fraction of inactive proteins, which was estimated in independent experiments to be <30% in each case, our data are referred to as the apparent dissociation constant (K D(app)). To estimate the on rate, the reaction was performed at 4 °C. 50 ng of purified protein was preincubated at 4 °C for 30 min in EMSA binding buffer prior to adding 1 ng of radiolabeled probe. Once the probe was added to the reaction mixture, an aliquot was taken and loaded on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at different time points in the presence of electric current. To estimate the off rate, 50 ng of purified proteins was incubated with 1 ng of radiolabeled probe for 15 min. A 1000-fold excess of the unlabeled probe was added to the reaction mixture, and aliquots were taken and loaded on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel at different time points in the presence of electric current. Monolayers of NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Nuclear extracts were prepared according to the procedure of Lee et al. (45Lee K.A.W. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), except that nuclei were obtained by submitting cells to three freeze/thaw cycles in buffer containing 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmdithiothreitol. This assay was performed essentially as described previously (46Wissmann A. Hillen W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 365-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The probe was prepared from the pBluescript KS vector, whose polylinker includes an ATCGAT motif. To label the upper or lower DNA strand, the plasmid was digested with either EcoRI or XhoI, end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase, and digested with the second enzyme (XhoI or EcoRI). The probes were purified from a nondenaturing acrylamide gel by passive elution. The labeled probes were partially methylated at purines using dimethyl sulfate. 20,000 cpm of partially methylated probe was used in EMSAs as described above. The free and retarded DNAs were visualized by autoradiography and purified by passive elution. The DNAs were cleaved at guanine and adenine bases using 0.2 m NaOH. The digested products were analyzed on 12% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The DNA-binding properties of CUT repeats have previously been investigated using GST fusion proteins (33Andres V. Chiara M.D. Mahdavi V. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 34Aufiero B. Neufeld E.J. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Since GST fusion proteins exist as dimers, these prior studies did not resolve whether individual CUT repeats can bind to DNA (36Harada R. Berube G. Tamplin O.J. Denis-Larose C. Nepveu A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 48Aceto A. Caccuri P. Sacchetta T. Bucciarelli B. Dragani N. Rosato G. Di Ilio C. Biochem.

Biochem. 1993; 215: 741-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To address this issue, we expressed each CUT repeat as a fusion protein with a histidine tag and assessed their DNA-binding properties in EMSAs using 29FP oligonucleotides encoding a CDP/CUT consensus binding site (ATCGAT). Representative results using 10 ng of His-tagged fusion proteins are shown in Fig. 1 B. Similar results were obtained when MBP was fused to CR1, CR3, or CR3HD (data not shown). When expressed as monomeric fusion proteins, the CUT repeats and the CUT homeodomain were not able to bind efficiently to DNA (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–4). We then asked whether various combinations of CUT repeats and the CUT homeodomain could bind to DNA as monomers. CR1+2, but not CR2+3, was able to bind to DNA (Fig.1 B, lanes 5 and 6). In addition, each CUT repeat bound to DNA when expressed together with the CUT homeodomain: CR1HD, CR2HD, and CR3HD (Fig. 1 B, lanes 7–9). In the latter fusion proteins, CR3 and the CUT homeodomain were maintained in the arrangement in which they exist in the CDP/CUT protein. Thus, the result obtained with the CR3HD fusion protein most likely reflects the activity of these domains in the context of the CDP/CUT protein. However, the same cannot be said of CR1HD and CR2HD because, in these fusion proteins, the homeodomain has been brought in close proximity to CR1 or CR2, unlike in the original CDP/CUT protein. To verify whether CR1 and CR2 could cooperate with the CUT homeodomain in the context of the entire CDP/CUT protein, we engineered larger fusion proteins in which CR2 and/or CR3 had been precisely deleted, keeping intact the linker regions between CUT repeats: CR1-L-L-HD and CR2-L-HD (Fig. 1 A). These two fusion proteins were able to bind to DNA, indicating that CR1 and CR2 can cooperate with the CUT homeodomain even when positioned at a distance from each other in the primary sequence (Fig. 1 B, lanes 10 and11). Whether such cooperation can occur in the context of a full-length CDP/CUT protein that contains CR3 could not be demonstrated because any DNA sequence that is recognized by CR1HD or CR2HD is also bound by CR3HD (see “Discussion”). In summary, when expressed as monomers, individual CUT repeats cannot bind to DNA, but can do so in conjunction with another CUT repeat or the CUT homeodomain. Therefore, at least two DNA-binding domains are necessary for DNA binding, and the combinations that work are CR1+2, CR1HD, CR2HD, and CR3HD. We have assessed the DNA-binding specificity of CR1+2 by performing polymerase chain reaction-mediated random oligonucleotide selection using oligonucleotides containing random bases at 15 positions. Selected sequences were then analyzed to find the best alignment and to derive a consensus binding site. Strikingly, all selected binding sites contained a CAAT or CGAT sequence almost invariably positioned at the beginning of the random sequence, indicating that C(A/G)AT is a preferred binding site, but that the flanking, nonrandom sequences also contribute to the binding site (Fig.2 A). For this reason, we have included the last 3 nonrandom bases in the compilation of selected sequences. In addition, all selected binding sites contained a second C(A/G)AT sequence (although sometimes with one mismatch) either as a direct or inverted repeat and positioned at a variable distance from the first C(A/G)AT site. Consequently, the selected sequences have been organized in two groups on the basis of whether the C(A/G)AT sites occur as direct or inverted repeats. Thus, the derived consensus binding sites for CR1+2 include two half-sites organized as direct or inverted repeats: cC(A/G)AT(N)nC(A/G)AT. The consensus binding site for CR1+2 is quite different from the ATCGAT consensus that was previously identified using GST fusion proteins (33Andres V. Chiara M.D. Mahdavi V.

Recent studies have shown that these reactions are catalyzed by a copolymerase encoded by EXT1 and EXT2, members of the exostosin family of putative tumor suppressors linked to hereditary multiple exostoses. Previously, we identified a collection of Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants (pgsD) that failed to make heparan sulfate (Lidholt, K., Weinke, J. L., Kiser, C. S., Lugemwa, F. N., Bame, K.

Here, we show that pgsD mutants contain mutations that either alter GlcA transferase activity selectively or that affect both GlcNAc and GlcA transferase activities. Expression of EXT1 corrects the deficiencies in the mutants, whereas EXT2 and the related EXT-like cDNAs do not. Analysis of the EXT1 mutant alleles revealed clustered missense mutations in a domain that included a (D/E)X(D/E) motif thought to bind the nucleotide sugar from studies of other transferases. These findings provide insight into the location of the GlcA transferase subdomain of the enzyme and indicate that loss of the GlcA transferase domain may be sufficient to cause hereditary multiple exostoses.

Virology. 1995; 208: 531-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This finding was followed by a report that recombinant forms of EXT1 and EXT2 have GlcNAc and GlcA transferase activities (26Lind T. Tufaro F. McCormick C. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26265-26268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that EXT1 and EXT2 may actually collaborate to form a functional oligomeric complex in the Golgi, the site where heparan sulfate polymerization is thought to occur (27McCormick C. Duncan G. Goutsos K.T. Tufaro F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 668-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Mutations in the EXT1 locus in Drosophila (tout-velu), cultured cells, and mice result in the loss of heparan sulfate in vivo, providing strong evidence that EXT1 is indeed the copolymerase responsible for heparan sulfate formation (8Lidholt K. Weinke J.L. Kiser C.S. Lugemwa F.N. Bame K.J. Cheifetz S. Massagué J. Lindahl U. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Ectopic expression of EXT1 fully corrects the enzymatic and heparan sulfate deficiencies in the mutants, whereas introduction of EXT2 and the related EXT-like cDNAs fail to complement the defect in pgsD cells. We also show that pgsD mutants contain mutations in EXT1 and that two classes of alleles exist based on differential activity of the GlcNAc and GlcA transferases in vitro. Sequencing the mutant alleles indicates that the GlcA transferase domain most likely resides in the N-terminal portion of the protein. CHO cells (CHO-K1) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CCL-61). One class of pgsD mutants (strains 623, 677, 108, 115, 6, 154, 625p, and 803) were isolated by replica plating and colony autoradiography, using35SO4 incorporation to identify clones that produced less proteoglycans (8Lidholt K. Weinke J.L. Kiser C.S. Lugemwa F.N. Bame K.J. Cheifetz S. Massagué J. Lindahl U. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2267-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 30Esko J.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 387-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). H661 was discovered by in situ enzymatic assay of GlcN N-sulfotransferase activity in mutagenized clones replica-plated to polyester cloth (30Esko J.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 387-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This strain failed to produce endogenous substrate for the enzyme (31Bame K.J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8059-8065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HVR101 and HVR104 were isolated from mutagenized CHO-K1 cells by selecting for cells that survived exposure to herpes simplex virus type 2, which is cytotoxic to wild-type cells (32Shieh M.-T. WuDunn D. Montgomery R.I. Esko J.D. Spear P.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1273-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar), followed by screening for colonies that incorporated 35SO4 but were resistant to virus infection. The purity of each strain was ensured by its isolation from cultures containing only mutant colonies. Cells were maintained in Ham's F12 medium (33Ham R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 53: 288-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) (Hyclone Laboratories) supplemented with 7.5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories), 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 100 units/ml penicillin G. Cells were switched to sulfate-deficient medium (34Esko J.D. Elgavish A. Prasthofer T. Taylor W.H. Weinke J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15725-15733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 7.5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 100 unit/ml penicillin G for radiolabeling studies. Cells were labeled for 24 h with 10 μCi/ml H235SO4 (1325 Ci/mmol, NEN Life Science Products) in sulfate-free medium. Radiolabeled GAG chains were isolated by anion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel as described previously (31Bame K.J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8059-8065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and separated by anion-exchange HPLC on a 7.5-mm inner diameter × 7.5 cm column of DEAE-3SW (TosoHaas, Montgomeryville, PA). The column was equilibrated in 10 mm KH2PO4 buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.2% (w/v) Zwittergent 3–12 and 0.2 m NaCl. GAGs were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl (0.2–1 m) in the same buffer using a flow rate of 1 ml/min and by increasing the NaCl concentration by 10 mm/min. The effluent from the column was monitored for radioactivity with an in-line radioactivity detector (Radiomatic Flo One/β, Packard Instruments) with sampling rates every 6 s. The data were averaged over 1-min intervals. GlcNAc transferase (UDP-GlcNAc:N-acetylheparosan α1–4N-acetyl-d-glucosaminyltransferase) and GlcA transferase (UDP-GlcA:N-acetylheparosan β1–4-d-glucuronosyltransferase) activities were assayed using oligosaccharide acceptors prepared from the capsular polysaccharide of Escherichia coli K5 (35Vann W.F. Schmidt M.A. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Briefly, the polysaccharide was partially N-deacetylated with hydrazine and subjected to deaminative cleavage with nitrous acid at pH 3.9 (36Shively J.E. Conrad H.E. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 3932-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) The resulting mixture of oligosaccharides averaged 16 residues in length with GlcA at their nonreducing termini (average mass, 3200 Da) (8Lidholt K. Weinke J.L. Kiser C.S. Lugemwa F.N. Bame K.J. Cheifetz S. Massagué J. Lindahl U. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This mixture was used as a substrate for GlcNAc transferase assays. Small portions (0.6–1.0 mg) were digested as needed with β-d-glucuronidase from bovine liver (Sigma, G-0501, 0.5 mg) in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, at 37 °C overnight. The chains were separated from the released GlcA by gel exclusion chromatography on a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), lyophilized, and used as substrate for GlcA transferase. Confluent monolayers of CHO cells were scraped with a rubber policeman in homogenization buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 20 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each leupeptin and pepstatin A) and sonicated by two 1-s pulses at output setting 3 on a 550 Sonic Dismembrator (Fisher Scientific) equipped with a microtip. Each 25-μl reaction for GlcNAc transferase contained 25 mm MOPS, pH 6.5, 20 mmMnCl2, 0.3% Triton X-100 (w/v), 1 mmUDP-[6-3H]GlcNAc (220 Ci/mole), 25 μg of cleavedN-acetylheparosan, and 10–20 μg of cell homogenate protein. To assay GlcA transferase, each 25-μl reaction contained 25 mm MES, pH 5.5, 20 mm MnCl2, 0.03% Triton X-100 (w/v), 2 mm UDP-[1-3H]GlcA (250 Ci/mole), 70 μg of β-glucuronidase-treatedN-acetylheparosan and 10–20 μg of cell homogenate protein. Product formation was proportional to time for over 4 h at 37 °C, but reactions were routinely terminated after 3 h by boiling or by adding dilute acid. Products were isolated by DEAE-Sephacel chromatography (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), mixed with chondroitin sulfate carrier (1 mg), precipitated in 80% ethanol, and quantified by liquid scintillation spectrometry. UDP-[1-3H]GlcA was synthesized fromd-[1-3H]glucose (10 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) as described (38Wei G. Bai X. Sarkar A.K. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7857-7864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 39Bai X.M. Wei G. Sinha A. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13017-13024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To determine the apparent K m values for UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-GlcA, the nucleotide sugars were added in increasing concentrations to a fixed amount of N-acetylheparosan oligosaccharides (0.8 mg/ml and 2 mg/ml, respectively). The signal obtained at each concentration of UDP sugar in the absence of acceptor was <10% of that obtained in its presence, and these values were subtracted. Increasing concentrations of cleavedN-acetylheparosan were added to determine theK m for the acceptors while holding the nucleotide sugar concentration at 1 and 2 mm for the GlcNAc and GlcA transferase reactions, respectively. The data were fitted by a nonlinear least-squares algorithm (SigmaPlot 4.11, Jandel Scientific) to the Michaelis-Menten rate equation (40Michaelis L. Menten M.L. Biochem. Z. 1913; 49: 333Google Scholar). The reactions were assumed to be pseudo first-order, because the second substrate was kept at a constant value. Optimal concentrations of detergent and divalent cations were determined for each reaction. The pH was varied by using a mixture of MOPS and MES buffers (25 mm each). Approximately 1 × 107 pgsD-H661 cells were transfected with a mixture of 500 μg of a wild-type CHO-K1 cDNA library prepared in pcDNA1 (Invitrogen) and 1.8 mg of pMAMneo (CLONTECH) using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Stable transfectants were selected by adding 0.4 mg/ml geneticin sulfate (G-418) (Life Technologies, Inc.) to the medium, and positive clones were screened by replica plating and125I-FGF-2 binding (41Bai X. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17711-17717Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Two clones that bound125I-FGF were identified in this way (461 and 477–1) and purified by two rounds of subcloning. Genomic DNA was then isolated from clone 477–1 and used to transfect ∼1.2 × 107pgsD-H661 cells (200 μg of genomic DNA and 6.8 μg of pSV2neo [CLONTECH]). Secondary transfectants were selected by resistance to G-418 and screened by replica plating and binding to 125I-FGF-2, yielding one positive clone (5607). The genomic DNA was also partially digested with Sau3AI (Life Technologies, Inc.) and fractionated by centrifugation through a 10–40% (w/vol) sucrose gradient. Fragments of 9–23 kilobases were pooled, and a genomic library was constructed using Lambda FIX II/XhoI partial Fill-in Vector Kit and Gigapack III Gold Cloning Kit (Stratagene). ∼2 × 106 plaques were screened using a 32P-labeled probe prepared from the cytomegalovirus promoter region of pcDNA1 (BamHI-NheI fragment) as a probe. Two positive phages 13-1-2 and 26-5-1 were identified, and 13-1-2 was further characterized. A 7-kilobase NotI fragment in 13-1-2 was subcloned into pcDNA3 and sequenced by BWG-Biotech, Inc. (High Point, North Carolina). This clone contained a full-length copy of EXT1 (GenBankTM accession number AF252858). Plasmid or lambda phage DNA was introduced into mutant cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two days after transfection, cells were labeled with 10 μCi/ml35SO4 for 24 h in sulfate-deficient medium, and the GAGs were isolated and analyzed by anion-exchange HPLC. To isolate stable transfectants expressing murine mEXT1 and mEXT2, cells were transfected with pCDNA3-mEXT1-myc/His and pCDNA3-mEXT2-myc/His (gifts from Frank Tufaro, University of British Columbia, Canada) as above. After two days, cells were replated in 100-mm dishes and treated with 0.4 mg/ml G-418 for 5 days. Cells then were overlaid with Whatman filter paper no. 50 and glass beads to obtain discreet colonies (30Esko J.D. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 32: 387-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The medium was replenished once, and after 5 days, single colonies were isolated with cloning rings. Positive clones were screened by flow cytometry analysis using biotinylated FGF-2 (38Wei G. Bai X. Sarkar A.K. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7857-7864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-Myc antibodies (Invitrogen). Full-length forms of mutant EXT1 cDNAs were isolated by reverse transcriptase-PCR as described below. The PCR products were digested byEcoRI and BamHI and inserted into the homologous sites in pFLAG-CMV2 (Sigma) to produce FLAG-tagged EXT1. Wild-type and mutant pgsD cells were transfected with the cDNAs, and the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using biotin-FGF-2 as probe (38Wei G. Bai X. Sarkar A.K. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7857-7864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Human EXTL1 cDNA was PCR-cloned from a human smooth muscle first strand cDNA library (CLONTECH) using the following two sets of primers: hEXTL1–803-5, 5′-CCTGCTCTTCCTGCTTGCTG-3′ and hEXTL1–2297-3, 5′-CTTCCTGTGCCCATCAATGAC-3′, and hEXTL1–2164-5, 5′-TGAAGCTCATCCAGGCGGT-3′ and hEXTL1–3074-3, 5′-AGGAGAAGGTAAGGCCACGC-3′. PCR conditions were: 95 °C for 3 min, 35 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, 50 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 2.5 min, and 72 °C for 10 min using pfupolymerase (Stratagene). Both PCR fragments were cloned into pPCR-Script Amp SK(+) plasmid (Stratagene), cut with BglII and NotI, and cloned into the NotI site of pcDNA3.1(−) to obtain a full-length cDNA. The correct orientation of the clone was determined by EcoRI digestion. To clone human EXTL2 cDNA, the PCR primers were 5′-GGCTGGCCCTACTGCAATC-3′ and 5′-cgcatcctcgagaaGCTACTCAAATGCCAAGC-3′ (the lowercase letters stand for noncoding sequence and the underlined sequence refers to an XhoI site). The PCR conditions were similar to those described above. The PCR product was cloned into pPCR-Script Amp SK(+) plasmid (Stratagene). The insert with the correct orientation was cloned into the NotI and BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1(−). The original cDNA clone of human EXTL3 in pBluescript II SK(+) (KIAA0519) was a gift from Dr. Takahiro Ngase (Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Kisarazu, Chiba 292, Japan). The full-length cDNA was cloned into the XhoI and NotI sites of pcDNA3.1(−). pcDNA3.1-hEXTL1, pcDNA3.1-hEXTL2, and pcDNA3.1-hEXTL3 were transfected into pgsD-677, pgsD-H661, and pgsD-623. At least eight stable transfectants from each mutant for each cDNA were picked. Expression of the human cDNAs in the stable transfectants was confirmed by Northern blot analysis. Expression of heparan sulfate was examined by flow cytometry using biotin-FGF-2 (38Wei G. Bai X. Sarkar A.K. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7857-7864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). mRNA was isolated from cells using QuickPrep Micro mRNA Purification Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The mRNA was denatured at 65 °C in a solution of 50% formamide (v/v), 6% formaldehyde (v/v), 20 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), electrophoresed in 1.0% agarose containing 6% formaldehyde (v/v), and transferred passively for 18 h to a Nytran plus nylon membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The blotted RNA was cross-linked by UV irradiation and then prehybridized for 2 h at 42 °C in a solution containing 50% formamide (v/v), 20 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8), 5× SSC, 1× Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS (w/v), 5% (w/v) dextran sulfate, and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA. Double-stranded DNA probes were labeled with [32P]dCTP by random oligonucleotide primers (Prime IT II labeling kit, Stratagene) using full-length cDNAs as templates. The probe was purified by Elute-tip (Schleicher & Schuell) before hybridization. Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C overnight in prehybridization buffer containing ∼1 × 106 cpm/ml of the32P-labeled probe. The membrane was washed two times with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 42 °C and then two times with 0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 65 °C. Hybridization was visualized by phosphoimaging (Storm 860, Molecular Dynamics) after overnight exposure. mRNA from mutant and wild-type CHO cells was purified as described above. First strand cDNA was produced using random primers in the SuperscriptTM Preamplification System according to the manufacturer's protocol (Life Technologies, Inc.). To determine the mutations in the mutants two PCR fragments of ∼1 kilobase each, which together covered the entire coding sequence, were isolated from each cell line. PCR primers were: 5′-CCTCTTGACCCAGGC-AGGACACATG-5′ and 5′-GCGTGAGCGGATCTGCATTGGGAAG-3′, 5′-TGCCACTTTCTGTCTGGTTCC-3′ and 5′-ATGACGGCAGCTTGGTTCC-3′. PCR was carried out with pfupolymerase (CLONTECH; 25 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min, followed by a final incubation at 72 °C for 7 min). The PCR products were cloned into pCR-Script Amp SK(+) (Stratagene). At least four clones from each PCR product were sequenced on both strands by the dideoxy chain termination method using Taq polymerase (dye terminator cycle sequencing, Perkin-Elmer) with a DNA automatic sequencer (ABI PRISM genetic analyzer). For other pgsD mutants, full-length EXT1 cDNAs were isolated by reverse transcriptase-PCR using the following primers: 5′-cgcgaattcaCAGGCCAAAAAACGCGAGGGCATC-3′ and 5′-gtggatcccTCAAAGCCGTTCAATGTCTC-3′ (lowercase letters stand for non-cDNA sequences and the underlined sequences are EcoRI and BamHI sites, respectively). The sequences were determined directly from these PCR products. Several heparan sulfate-deficient CHO cell mutants were previously isolated and characterized (8Lidholt K. Weinke J.L. Kiser C.S. Lugemwa F.N. Bame K.J. Cheifetz S. Massagué J. Lindahl U. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2267-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In addition, new mutants have been identified based on the their inability to produce substrate for GlcNN-sulfotransferase (31Bame K.J. Esko J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8059-8065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), failure to bind to FGF-2 (41Bai X. Esko J.D. J. Biol.

Tufaro F. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3290-3298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The latter assay is based on the observation that herpes simplex virus utilizes heparan sulfate as a co-receptor for attachment and fusion of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane (32Shieh M.-T.

Based on cell hybridization studies, all of these mutants belong to a single complementation group that was originally designated pgsD (8Lidholt K. Weinke J.L. Kiser C.S. Lugemwa F.N. Bame K.J.

PgsD mutants have mutations that affect the copolymerase responsible for the alternating addition of α1–4-linked GlcNAc and β1–4-linked GlcA units to nascent heparan sulfate chains. These reactions are catalyzed by a bifunctional protein that contains both GlcNAc transferase and GlcA transferase activities. Previous studies showed that the mutation in strain 677 affected both enzyme activities, which provided the first evidence that both catalytic sites resided in a single protein (8Lidholt K. Weinke J.L. Kiser C.S. Lugemwa F.N. Bame K.J. Cheifetz S. Massagué J. Lindahl U. Esko J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2267-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). To characterize the other mutants in the collection, GlcNAc and GlcA transferase assays in CHO cell homogenates were optimized with respect to buffer, pH, detergent, oligosaccharide acceptors, and nucleotide sugar"

https://openalex.org/W2058122685,"Spectacular advances in organometallic chemistry over the past two decades have resulted in single-site catalysts that are revolutionizing production of polyethylene (PE) and isotactic polypropylene (iPP). This report describes an unanticipated benefit of metallocene-catalyzed semicrystalline polyolefins, namely welded joint strengths in PE/iPP laminates that can exceed the cohesive strength of the constituents. We propose that interfacial polymer entanglements, established in the molten state and subsequently anchored in chain-folded lamellae upon crystallization, are responsible for this intrinsic property. The poor adhesion exhibited by traditional Ziegler-Natta-catalyzed polyolefins is shown to derive from the accumulation of amorphous polymer, a by-product of the polymerization reactions, at the interface. These results should facilitate fabrication and improve the properties of composites based on materials that dominate the plastics industry."

Endothelial cells (ECs) express very low amounts of ICAM-1 and require stimulation with cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) or interleukin-1 to up-regulate ICAM-1 levels (1Pober J.S. Cotran R.S.

ICAM-1 functions as a costimulatory molecule on antigen-presenting cells to activate major histocompatability complex class II restricted T-cells and on other cell types in association with major histocompatability complex class I to activate cytotoxic T-cells. The recognition of ICAM-1 by β2-integrins results in the adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium and in the extravasation of leukocytes to sites of inflammation (3Hayflick J.S. Kilgannon P.

The extravasation of leukocytes also occurs through a process involving ICAM-1 and the plasma protein fibrinogen (Fg). In this process, the integrin-bound Fg interacts with ICAM-1, mediating the bridging between blood cells and ECs (6Languino L.R. Plescia J. Duperray A. Brian A.A. Plow E.F. Geltosky J.E. Altieri D.C.

The 28-amino acid cytoplasmic tail of ICAM-1 lacks the consensus sequence required for intrinsic kinase activity. Moreover, ICAM-1 lacks the motifs resembling the Src homology domains (SH) that can recruit phosphorylated proteins at the cytoplasmic, membrane-proximal site (16Staunton D.E. Marlin S.D. Stratowa C. Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Cell. 1988; 52: 925-933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (810) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, Fg-ICAM-1 ligation in Raji B-cells results in proliferative signals that causes 2–3-fold increase in the phosphorylation of pp60Src and of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (13Gardiner E.E.

However, the ligation of TNFα-stimulated ECs to Fg results in a dramatic increase (8–10-fold) in ERK phosphorylation, which is implicated in EC survival and in preventing TNFα-mediated apoptosis (15Pluskota E. D'Souza S.E. Blood. 1999; 94 (Suppl. 1) (Abstr. 997): 226Google Scholar). In other studies, the ligation of ICAM-1 from EC derived from rat brain microvessels with β2-integrins from activated T-cells resulted in the phosphorylation of a Src kinase substrate, cortactin (17Durieu-Trautmann O.

The ITIM consensus sequence (I/V/L)XY XX(L/V), when phosphorylated, associates with the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing phosphatases SHP-1, SHP-2, and SHIP-1 (SH2-containing inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase). These cytosolic phosphatases down-regulate tyrosine kinase activity and cellular functions induced through immune receptor tyrosine-binding activation motifs (ITAM). SHP-2 (previously called SH-PTP2, PTP2C, PTP1D, and Syp) is a widely expressed phosphatase and contains two tandem SH2 domains at the amino-terminal third of the protein, followed by a catalytic phosphatase domain and a carboxyl region that becomes tyrosine phosphorylated (32Neel B.G. Tonks N.K. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 193-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (741) Google Scholar). The SH2 domains of SHP-2 physically interact with ligand-activated receptors that either elicit or lack tyrosine kinase activity, as well as other cytoplasmic signaling molecules (32Neel B.G.

This protein-protein interaction enhances the tyrosine phosphatase activity of SHP-2 by relieving the inhibitory intramolecular interactions between the amino-terminal SH2 domain and the catalytic phosphatase domain (37Hof P.

ICAM-1 contains a single sequence (IKKYRLQ) that poorly conforms to the concensus ITIM in that it has glutamine at the Y + 3 position instead of the invariant L/V; and lysine is at Y − 2 instead of the obligatory hydrophobic residue I/V/L. However, these invariant residues occur at Y + 2 and Y − 3 positions in ICAM-1. Our results demonstrate that the tyrosine phosphorylated peptide IKK485YRLQ binds to the SH2 domain proximal to the NH2 terminus of SHP-2 (SHP-2-N). SHP-2 associates with phosphorylated ICAM-1 under cellular conditions. Cells expressing ICAM-1 mutation Tyr → Ala at position 485, ICAM-1(Y485A), associate with SHP-2 at greatly diminished levels. The failure of ICAM-1 to associate with SHP-2 results in cells undergoing apoptosis despite extracellular Fg-ICAM-1 ligation. TNFα was purchased from Genzyme (Boston, MA).

Cells were plated on tissue culture-treated polystyrene plates (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) precoated with 1.0 μg/cm2 human fibronectin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 medium (DMEM/F-12) (BioWhittaker, Inc., Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 15% FCS, 90 μg/ml heparin (Sigma), and 150 μg/ml EC growth supplements (Clonetics, San Diego, CA). Cells were grown in T75 culture flasks, and ECs from passages 2–4 were used for this study. 293 cells of human kidney fibroblast origin and ICAM-1-expressing lymphoblastoid Raji cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Raji were grown in RPMI 1640 (BioWhittaker, Inc.) containing 7.5% FCS and 1.0 mm glutamine. 293 cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 containing 10% FCS and 1.0 mm glutamine.

The last 28 amino acids of ICAM-1(WT) were truncated, with the sequence terminating at residue 478 (ICAM-1(TR)) using polymerase chain reaction with the following primers: lower primer, which introduced a stop codon, 5′-GTC TGA ATT CCT TGA TCT TCC GCT AAC GGT T-3′; upper primer, 5′-CTA AGC TTC CCT ATG GCT CCC AGC-3′, containing HindIII and EcoRI restriction sites, respectively. The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) vector. To generate full-length ICAM-1 mutant Y485A, a single point mutation was introduced using the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the primer pair: upper ICAM-1(Y485A), 5′-CCT GTT GTA GTC TGG CTT TCT TGA TCT TCC-3′; lower ICAM-1(Y485A), 5′-GGA AGA TCA AGA AAG CCA GAC TAC AAC AGG-3′. The sequences of the DNA constructs were verified by sequence analysis. Next, 293 cells were stably transfected in the absence of serum using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 1–5 μg of pcDNA 3.1 containing cDNA for ICAM-1(WT), ICAM-1 (TR), or ICAM-1 (Y485A) or pcDNA3.1 vector alone as control. Transfected cells were selected using G418 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in DMEM/F-12. Cells expressing ICAM-1 were detected by incubation with mAb anti-ICAM-1 (LB2) antibodies and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and isolated using the fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS). Levels of ICAM-1 expression were monitored by FACS analysis and by immunoblotting as described previously. Resting and TNFα-stimulated ECs and 293 cells were removed by brief trypsin treatment and washed in Dulbecco's PBS. Cells were resuspended in a staining medium of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 2.0 mm CaCl2, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and 0.1% BSA and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min with 5.0 μg/ml of either control mouse IgG or the anti-ICAM-1 mAb LB-2. Cells were centrifuged through a cushion of FCS and resuspended in staining medium containing 50 μg/ml FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell-bound antibodies were detected using a FACScan and analyzed on the LYSIS program (Becton Dickinson). Petri dishes (Corning, NY) were coated with human Fg (200 nm in PBS) for 16 h at 4 °C and then blocked with 1% heat-inactivated BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Prior to use the dishes were rinsed three times with PBS. ECs, Raji cells, and 293 cells were maintained in DMEM/F-12 containing 1% FCS for 18 h prior to the commencement of an experiment. In addition to serum deprivation, some ECs were stimulated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) for 18 h. ECs and 293 cells were briefly trypsinized (BioWhittaker, Inc.), harvested by low speed centrifugation (800 rpm for 5 min), and resuspended in the medium. Cells were seeded onto Petri dishes coated with proteins at 1–2 × 106 cells/dish and incubated at 37 °C for 15–120 min. Cells were then processed for immunoprecipitation, Western blot analysis, or annexin V binding assay. For quantitative cellular adhesion, 293 cells (1 × 105/well) expressing ICAM-1 were allowed to adhere to Fg-coated tissue culture plates (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) for 15 min at 37 °C. The plates were washed three times with PBS, and the number of adherent cells in each well was quantitated using the Cyquant Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Molecular Probes Inc., Eugene, OR) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, after washing the plates were frozen at −70 °C for 2 h, cells were then thawed, and the green fluorescent dye, incorporating into DNA, was added. After 5 min of incubation at room temperature, fluorescence was measured using a microplate reader with excitation at 480 nm and emission detection at 530 nm. Adherent 293 cells were detached by gentle pipetting. Cells were washed and resuspended in calcium-enriched binding buffer (1 × 105 cells in 0.1 ml) and incubated with FITC-labeled annexin V for 15 min at room temperature; then 100 μl of binding buffer was added. Annexin V-FITC-stained cells were detected by FACS analysis. ICAM-1, SHP-1, SHP-2, and tyrosine phosphorylated proteins were purified from cell lysates by immunoprecipitation. After treatment, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed in 500 μl of ice-cold Triton X-100 buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm NaCl, 1.0% Triton X-100, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysate were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were precleared with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose and then assayed for protein concentration using bicinchoninic acid reagents (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Aliquots containing equivalent amounts of protein (500 μg) were mixed with 1–2 μg of specific antibody overnight at 4 °C. The immune complexes were recovered by the addition of 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose and incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. Sepharose beads were washed four times with lysis buffer and twice with PBS containing 0.1 mm Na3VO4. The immune complexes were extracted from the Sepharose beads by boiling in SDS gel loading buffer, separated on SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 5% BSA in TBS, pH 7.4, for 1 h at room temperature and immunoblotted with the primary mAb anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10, anti-ICAM-1, or anti-SHP-2 followed by goat anti-mouse peroxidase-linked secondary antibody. Immunoblots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence. Some blots were stripped using the stripping buffer (0.1 m glycine, pH 2.8, 3 m NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) with constant shaking at room temperature for 30 min. Membranes were rinsed with TBS several times, blocked with 5% BSA for 1 h, and reprobed with other antibodies. The tyrosine phosphorylation of proteins in the Western blots was quantitated by laser scanning densitometry using Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Inc., San Jose, CA) and the computer image analysis software NIH Image (Research Services Branch, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Biotinylated ICAM-1 (480) peptides (5 μg), both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated, were incubated with GST-SHP2-N or GST-SHP2-C or GST alone as a control in 1 ml of ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer for 16 h. The biotinylated peptides were captured by addition 20 μl of Ultralink-Immobilized-Streptavidin beads for 3 h at 4 °C. In competition experiments, nonbiotinylated ICAM-1(480–489) peptides, both phosphorylated or nonphosphorylated, at 0.5–4 μg were preincubated with GST-SHP-2-N (2 μg) for 3 h at room temperature and then incubated with 5 μg of biotinylated pY485 peptide for 16 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with ice-cold Triton X-100 lysis buffer and twice with ice-cold PBS. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and subjected to Western blotting using goat anti-GST antibody. SHP-2 cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction utilizing the human placental cDNA library and the following primers: upper, 5′-CGA AGA CGG GGA ATT CAT GAC ATC ATC GCG G-3′; lower, 5′-CTG CGT TCT GTC GGC GGC CGC TCA TCT GAA ACT CC-3′. The segments encoding amino acid residues 6–105, the NH2-terminal SH2 domain (SHP-2-N), and residues encoding 112–213, the COOH-terminal domain (SHP-2-C) of SHP-2 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction from SHP-2 cDNA using the following primers: for SHP-2-N, N43, 5′-CGA AGA CGG GGA ATT CAT GAC ATC GCG G-3′; N349, 5′-GGT AGG GTC CTC GAG TCA CAG CGG GTA CTT GAG-3′, containing EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively, and for SHP-2-C, C-376, 5′-CCT ACC TCT GAA TTC TGG TTC CAT GGT C-3′; C675, 5′-CTG CTT CTC GAG TCA GAC TGT GCC C-3′, containing EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites, respectively, and cloned into pGEX-4T-1. The sequences of all DNA constructs were verified by DNA sequence analysis. The bacterial expression constructs GST-SHP2-N and GST-SHP2-C were used to transform Escherichia coli BL21cells. GST fusion proteins were produced by inducing log phase 1000-ml cultures with 0.1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Sigma) and purified using the GST purification module following the manufacturer's instructions. Flexible 96-well Falcon plastic plates (BD Labware, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were coated with 100 μl (20 μg/ml in PBS) of nonbiotinylated ICAM-1(480–489) peptides for 16 h at 4 °C. Following washes, 0.20–0.24 μg of peptide remained bound. Wells were then postcoated with 3% gelatin in PBS for 3 h at 37 °C and washed four times with SPRIA buffer (PBS, 0.02% NaN3, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1% BSA). GST-SHP-2-N, GST-SHP-2-C, or GST alone (0.5–2 μg/100 μl/well) in PBS were incubated with the coated peptides for 16 h at 4 °C. Plates were washed six times with SPRIA buffer. Bound GST fusion SHP2 domains and GST alone were detected using mouse anti-GST Ab (1:1000 in SPRIA buffer) incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by the incubation with 125I-radiolabeled goat anti-mouse IgG in SPRIA buffer (105 cpm/well) for 2 h at 37 °C. Wells were washed with SPRIA buffer, dried, and counted in a γ counter (Isodata Corp., San Diego, CA). For competition studies, SHP-2-N domain was preincubated with nonphosphorylated or phosphorylated ICAM-1(480–489) peptides at 0–16 μg for 3 h at room temperature. This mixture was incubated with the phosphorylated ICAM-1(480–489) peptide and attached to microtiter wells for 16 h at 4 °C. The bound proteins were detected as described previously. For tyrosine phosphorylation of ICAM-1 and the binding of SHP-2 domains to intact phosphorylated ICAM-1 assays, plates were coated with rabbit anti-ICAM-1 antibody (4 μg/ml) raised a"

Along its dorsal axis Longisquama bore a series of paired integumentary appendages that resembled avian feathers in many details, especially in the anatomy of the basal region. The latter is sufficiently similar to the calamus of modern feathers that each probably represents the culmination of virtually identical morphogenetic processes. The exact relationship of Longisquama to birds is uncertain. Nevertheless, we interpret Longisquama's elongate integumentary appendages as nonavian feathers and suggest that they are probably homologous with avian feathers. If so, they antedate the feathers of Archaeopteryx, the first known bird from the Late Jurassic."

A public health response alone is insufficient to address this devastating epidemic. Political leadership at the highest levels is needed to mobilize a multisectoral response to the impact of HIV/AIDS on educational systems, industry, agriculture, the military, and other sectors. With a few notable exceptions, political response was slow to mobilize in the early years of the epidemic, but response has dramatically improved in the past 18 months. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) is involved in ongoing efforts to encourage political leaders to make a multisectoral response to the epidemic a major focus of their national plans."

In this study, we describe the structure-function relationship of an essential domain of human cdc25C that interacts with 14-3-3 proteins. We show that this domain is a bi-functional interactive motif that interacts with cyclins primarily through their P-box motif in addition to 14-3-3 proteins. Characterization of the structural features of this domain by NMR and circular dichroism reveals two distinct α helical moieties interconnected by a loop carrying the 14-3-3 binding site. Moreover, the helical folding is induced upon binding to 14-3-3, suggestive of a conformational regulation of this domain of cdc25C through interactions with partner proteins in vivo.

In fission yeast, the 14-3-3 homolog Rad24 regulates the untimely nuclear localization of cdc25 by enhancing the nuclear export of cdc25 thanks to its nuclear export signal (26Lopez-Girona A. Furnari B. Mondesert O. Russell P. Nature. 1999; 397: 172-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). InXenopus and in human cells, in contrast, 14-3-3 proteins seem to promote the increased cytoplasmic retention of cdc25 by preventing recognition of the bipartite nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of cdc25 by the nuclear import machinery (27Kumagai A.

Despite these numerous studies, the molecular basis underlying the mechanism of regulation of cdc25 by 14-3-3 has still not been resolved. With the aim of investigating this issue, we used fluorescence spectroscopy, gel filtration, and affinity chromatography to examine the interactive properties of a 51-amino acid peptide, MP51, derived from residues 195 to 244 of human cdc25C that encompass the 14-3-3 binding site and the putative bipartite NLS (31Morris M.C. Méry J. Heitz A. Heitz F. Divita G. J. Pept. Sci. 1999; 5: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We found that this domain of cdc25C not only interacts with 14-3-3ζ in vitroand in vivo but also with human cyclins A and B1 with similar high affinity. We show that the interaction of MP51 with cyclins is primarily mediated through their P-box motif and is independent of MP51 phosphorylation, in contrast to the interaction between MP51 and 14-3-3ζ. Moreover we found that phosphorylation of both MP51 and full-length human cdc25C by cds1 favors the formation of stable MP51 and cdc25C·14-3-3 complexes over those of MP51- or cdc25C-cyclin B1 complexes both in vitro andin vivo. Finally, we examined the structural properties of MP51 by circular dichroism and NMR spectroscopy and propose the first structural model of an essential N-terminal regulatory domain of human cdc25C. The consequences of the dual functionality of this domain of human cdc25C are discussed with respect to its structural characteristics as a function of its phosphorylation status and in the context of cell cycle regulation. MP51 was synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis according to the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl)/tert-butyl strategy, then purified by ion exchange chromatography and semi-preparative high performance liquid chromatography as described previously (31Morris M.C. Méry J. Heitz A. Heitz F. Divita G. J. Pept. Sci. 1999; 5: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). MP51 was identified by electrospray mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis. Stoichiometric phosphorylation of MP51 on Ser22 was performed using 1–5 μg of recombinant human GST-cds1 (kindly provided by Dr. C. McGowan) for 30 min at 37 °C in kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP). After phosphorylation, MP51 was purified by gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 12 column and identified by mass spectrometry. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco 800 dichrograph using 1-mm-thick quartz cells. MP51 or MP51P was initially diluted to a final concentration of 0.1 mg ml−1 in water or phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and structural variations were measured as a function of changes in the initial CD spectrum upon addition of increasing concentrations of methanol or 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol (TFE). CD spectra were measured between 185 and 260 nm, and ellipticity values were calculated at 220 nm as described previously (32Chaloin L. Vidal P. Heitz A. Van Mau N. Méry J. Divita G. Heitz F. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11179-11187Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). For binding experiments, 14-3-3ζ was diluted to a final concentration of 8 μm in phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and incubated for 15 min with a 2-fold excess of MP51 or MP51P. Data collection and analysis were performed with the package software from Jasco. NMR experiments were performed with samples containing 2 mm MP51 or MP51P in either H2O/TFE-d 3 (2:1) or H2O/2H2O/TFE-d 2(57:10:33). Spectra were acquired on a Bruker AMX 600 spectrometer, equipped with q z-gradient triple resonance (1H,15N, 13C) probe at 290 and 305 K, and1H chemical shifts were referred to internal TSP-d4.

Ernst R.R. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2019) Google Scholar) with 200- and 300-ms mixing times were used for proton assignments. Two-dimensional heteronuclear inverse-detected 13C-1H heteronuclear correlation (HSQC) (35Kontaxis G. Stonehouse J. Laue E.D. Keeler J. J. Magn. Reson. 1994; 111: 70-76Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and HSQC-TOCSY spectra were recorded at natural abundance for carbon identification. The carrier frequency was centered on the water signal, and the solvent was suppressed by continuous low power irradiation during the relaxation delay and during the mixing time for NOESY spectra. Two-dimensional spectra were obtained using 2048 and 4096 points for each t1 value, and 512 t1 experiments were acquired. The spectral width was 10 ppm for proton and 165 ppm for 13C. Before Fourier transform, the time domain data were multiplied by a phase-shifted sine bell or square-sine-bell window function in both dimensions. 1H chemical shift assignments were achieved by standard two-dimensional sequence-specific methods (36Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996Google Scholar). Assignments of α-carbons were determined by direct HSQC, and ambiguities were solved through remote connectivities obtained by homonuclear transfers in HSQC-TOCSY. The random coil chemical shift values used to calculate the chemical-shift index were those obtained in aqueous solution containing 30% v/v TFE (37Thanabal V. Omencinsky D.O. Reily M.D. Cody W.L J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The methylene carbon of TFE was taken as reference at 61.70 ppm in 13C spectra. Secondary structure predictions of MP51, human cdc25B, and human cdc25A were carried out using the different methods available on the Institut de Biologie et Chimie des Proteines web server (Network Protein Sequence Analysis (NPSA)), including DSC, Gibrat, Levin, DPM, PREDATOR, and SOPMA (38Guermeur Y. Geourjon C. Gallinari P. Deleage G. Bioinformatics. 1999; 15: 413-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Based on both NMR data and secondary structure predictions, a three-dimensional model of the structure of MP51 was elaborated using BIOPOLYMER and DISCOVER available through INSIGHT II (MSI Inc. San Diego, CA). Human cdk1 and cdk2 and human cyclins A and B1 were overexpressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described previously (39Heitz F. Morris M.C. Fesquet D. Cavadore J.-C. Dorée M.

The P-box domain of human cyclin B1 (residues 183 to 237) was overexpressed in E. coli and purified as a maltose-binding fusion protein. Full-length human cdc25C was prepared as described previously (40Morris M.C. Divita G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 475-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). GST-Nter-cdc25C (residues 1 to 302) was overexpressed in E. coli and purified as a GST fusion protein. For fluorescence experiments, the GST tag was cleaved with thrombin, and Nter-cdc25C was further purified by ion exchange chromatography on a Resource Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Both full-length cdc25C and Nter-cdc25C were phosphorylated with recombinant human GST-cds1 for 30 min at 37 °C in a kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 2 mm ATP). After phosphorylation, cdc25C and Nter-cdc25C were purified by affinity chromatography on a GST trap column and by gel filtration chromatography on a Superose 12 column. Protein concentrations were routinely determined using the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Complexes formed between MP51 or MP51P and cyclin B1 or 14-3-3ζ were purified by size exclusion chromatography using either a Bio-Sil TSK 125 column (Bio-Rad) or a Superose 12 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cyclin B1 and/or 14-3-3ζ were incubated with a 2-fold excess of peptide for 30 min at 25 °C in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl. Chromatographies were performed in the same buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min, and peak fractions were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A similar procedure was used to purify complexes formed between phosphorylated full-length cdc25C and cyclin B1 or 14-3-3ζ. Fluorescence measurements were performed at 25 °C using a PTI spectrofluorometer, with spectral bandpasses of 4 nm for both excitation and emission in a fluorescence buffer containing 150 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.2, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol. Binding experiments were performed by tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy essentially as described previously (39Heitz F. Morris M.C. Fesquet D. Cavadore J.-C. Dorée M. Divita G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4995-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 40Morris M.C. Divita G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 475-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 290 nm, and emission spectra were recorded between 310 and 400 nm. Recombinant cdks, cyclins, cdk-cyclin complexes, and human 14-3-3ζ were incubated in fluorescence buffer for 30 min, and titration experiments were initiated by the addition of increasing concentrations of peptide (MP51, MP51P) or proteins (cdc25C, Nter-cdc25) to a fixed concentration of these proteins (100 nm). Measurements were corrected and fitted according to a standard quadratic equation using the Grafit software (Erathicus software Ltd) as described previously (39Heitz F. Morris M.C. Fesquet D. Cavadore J.-C. Dorée M. Divita G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4995-5003Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 40Morris M.C. Divita G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 286: 475-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). 1 mg of MP51 and MP51P were cross-linked to 1 ml of epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B resin. 1 mg of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated GST-Nter cdc25C was coupled to 1 ml of GST Sepharose 4B resin. For pull-down experiments with recombinant proteins, 10 μg of purified cdks, cyclins, or 14-3-3ζ were incubated for 15 min with the beads in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, then washed twice in the same buffer. For pull-down experiments with cell lysates, extracts were prepared in radioimmune precipitation buffer-SDS from asynchronous HS68 fibroblasts cultured to 70% confluency in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (16Strausfeld U.

Total extracts were incubated for 15 min with the beads in radioimmune precipitation buffer-SDS, then extensively washed in the same buffer. Proteins retained on the different beads were analyzed by Western blotting with polyclonal rabbit antibodies against 14-3-3ε (sc-1020), cyclin A (sc-751), cyclin B1 (sc-752), cdc2 (sc-747), and cdk2 (sc-748) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). With the aim of dissecting the mechanism of cdc25C regulation by 14-3-3 at the molecular level, we took advantage of the absence of tryptophan groups in MP51 and of the presence of highly conserved tryptophan residues in 14-3-3 proteins to monitor and quantify their interactions by intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy. 14-3-3 proteins indeed contain two well conserved tryptophan residues, Trp59 (located in helix C) and Trp228 (in helix I), which form, respectively, the floor and the wall of the channel in the x-ray structure of 14-3-3 (25Yaffe M.B.

Sci. 1999; 5: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and as shown in Fig.1 a, the addition of increasing concentrations of unphosphorylated MP51 to 14-3-3ζ induced quenching of its intrinsic fluorescence by 40%, and curve-fitting yielded aK d value of 132 nm ± 25. Moreover, we were able to purify stable complexes of unphosphorylated MP51·14-3-3ζ by gel filtration chromatography in the presence of a high concentration of salt, revealing that the interactions are mainly hydrophobic (Fig. 2 a). The same experiment performed with MP51 phosphorylated on Ser22, denoted MP51P, induced a similar quenching of fluorescence, but a 6-fold higher affinity for 14-3-3ζ, with aK d value of 21 ± 9 nm, revealing the pivotal role of phosphorylation of Ser22 in this interaction. However, the observation that MP51 peptide can interact with 14-3-3ζ in vitro in the absence of phosphorylation suggests that initial interactions occur through residues other than phospho-Ser22. The significant quenching of fluorescence observed in these experiments indicates that direct contacts between residues of MP51 and the Trp groups of 14-3-3ζ are involved. Moreover, curve-fitting reveals that two molecules of MP51 or MP51P bind per 14-3-3ζ dimer, indicating that the two binding sites in the 14-3-3ζ dimer are accessible and that binding of MP51 peptide to one site does not exclude binding to the other, as already documented for short 14-3-3 binding peptides containing tandem phospho-serine motifs (25Yaffe M.B.

In comparison, as reported in TableI, unphosphorylated recombinant full-length cdc25C and the N-terminal domain of cdc25C, denoted Nter-cdc25C, interacted very poorly with 14-3-3ζ, whereas their phosphorylation by cds1 designated pcdc25C and pNter-cdc25C promoted their high affinity interaction with 14-3-3ζ, withK d values of 57 ± 5 nm and 48 ± 7 nm, respectively, and a stoichiometry of 1 per 14-3-3ζ dimer.Figure 2Purification of MP51·14-3-3ζ, MP51·cyclin B1, and full-length cdc25C·14-3-3ζ complexes. a, purification of MP51·14-3-3ζ complexes by size exclusion chromatography. 14-3-3ζ eluted in a major peak at 13 min (2), and uncomplexed MP51 eluted in a peak at 25 min (3).

MP51-cyclin B1 and MP51P-cyclin B1 complexes were first purified by size exclusion chromatography as described in panel b, then incubated for 15 min at 25 °C in the presence of a stoichiometric concentration of 14-3-3ζ. Complexes were then separated by cation exchange chromatography on a Mono Q column in phosphate buffer pH 7.5 and eluted in a linear gradient of NaCl. Incubation of MP51-cyclin B1 with 14-3-3ζ (dashed line) resulted in the elution of two main peaks at 200 mm (2) and 370 mm(3) NaCl, corresponding, respectively, to 14-3-3ζ and to the MP51-cyclin B1 complex. Incubation of MP51P-cyclin B1 with 14-3-3ζ (solid line) led to the elution of two major peaks at 170 mm (4) and 350 mm(1) NaCl containing, respectively, MP51P·14-3-3ζ and monomeric cyclin B1.

We next investigated the potential of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated MP51 to interact with human cyclins A and B1 as well as with their cdk partners cdk1 and cdk2in vitro by intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy and gel filtration chromatography.

The contribution of each domain to the binding and activation of single chain urokinase (scuPA) remains poorly understood. In the present paper we examined the role of domain II (DII) in these processes. Repositioning DII to the amino or carboxyl terminus of the molecule abolished binding of scuPA as did deleting the domain entirely. By using alanine-scanning mutagenesis, we identified a 9-amino acid continuous sequence in DII (Arg137–Arg145) required for both activities. Competition-inhibition and surface plasmon resonance studies demonstrated that mutation of Lys139 and His143 to alanine in soluble receptor (suPAR) reduced the affinity for scuPA ∼5-fold due to an increase in the “off rate.” Mutation of Arg137, Arg142, and Arg145, each to alanine, leads to an ∼100-fold decrease in affinity attributable to a 10-fold decrease in the apparent “on rate” and a 6-fold increase in off rate. These differences were confirmed on cells expressing variant urokinase receptor. suPAR-K139A/H143A displayed a 50% reduction in scuPA-mediated plasminogen activation activity, whereas the 3-arginine variant was unable to stimulate scuPA activity at all. Mutation of the three arginines did not affect binding of a decamer peptide antagonist of scuPA known to interact with DI and DIII. However, this mutation abolished both the binding of soluble DI to DII–III in the presence of scuPA and the synergistic activation of scuPA mediated by DI and wild type DII–DIII. These data show that DII is required for high affinity binding of scuPA and its activation. DII does not serve merely as a spacer function but appears to be required for interdomain cooperativity.

Ronne E. Behrendt N. Jensen A.L. Blasi F. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1926-1933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each domain consists of 81–87 amino acids that are characterized by a generally conserved pattern of cysteine residues, which are separated from each other by ∼11-amino acid linker sequences. There is ∼20% amino acid sequence similarity among the domains at the amino acid level (13Ploug M. Ellis V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which the three domains interact to generate a high affinity binding site for uPAR and to participate in cell adhesion and scuPA activation remains largely unresolved. We (14Higazi A.A.-R. Mazar A. Wang J. Quan N. Griffin R. Reilly R. Henkin J. Cines D.B. J. Biol.

In addition, each fragment of suPAR displays less capacity to activate scuPA than the intact receptor (14Higazi A.A.-R. Mazar A. Wang J. Quan N. Griffin R. Reilly R. Henkin J. Cines D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5348-5353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage of uPAR between the DII and DIII generates a soluble fragment composed of DI and DII that binds uPA with an affinity similar to that of isolated sDI (16Behrendt N. Ronne E. Dano K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22885-22894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Thus, the connection between the domains of suPAR is essential to generate a high affinity site. The fragment containing DII and DIII may come into close proximity to DI to form an extended binding site for uPA (17Ploug M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15606-16494Google Scholar). Alternatively, DII and DIII may contain auxiliary binding sites that are independent of the site within DI. Potential contact sites for uPA on the surface of sDI and sDIII have been probed using mutagenesis, chemical protection, and cross-linking approaches (17Ploug M.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3612-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), but direct contact between these portions of uPAR and uPA itself has not been proven. Furthermore, the contribution of domain II within the intact receptor to uPA binding has received little attention (21Riittinen L. Limongi P. Crippa M.P. Conese M. Hernandez-Marrero L. Fazioli F. Blasi F. FEBS Lett. 1996; 381: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The studies reported here identify a region in domain II composed of 9 amino acids that is required for scuPA to bind full-length uPAR with high affinity. Mutation of three arginine residues within this region of uPAR reduces the affinity of scuPA binding to a level comparable to that of domain I alone and abolished the capacity of suPAR to activate scuPA in the absence of amino acid substitutions in domain I or domain III. These results demonstrate that domain II is required for high affinity binding of scuPA to uPAR. scuPA, two chain uPA, and polyclonal anti-uPAR antibody were the kind gifts of Dr. J. Henkin (Abbott). Human embryonic kidney 293 cells were purchased from American Tissue Type Culture Collection, (Manassas, VA). Tissue culture medium, bovine serum, and Lipofectin were from Life Technologies, Inc. Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) was from Oxford Glycosystems (Wakefield, MA). Chymotrypsin and pepsin were from Sigma, Na125I from (NEN Life Science Products), and IODO-BEADS from Pierce. Plasminogen and Spectrozyme PL were gifts of American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). cDNA encoding domains I and III (DI–DIII; amino acids 1–92 and 192–281) was constructed using two-step polymerase chain reaction by looping out DII (amino acids 93–191) using full-length uPAR/pGEM as a template. Each PCR product was subcloned into pcDNA at the HindIII andEcoRI sites. cDNA encoding DII was constructed from two-step PCR with a mutation at position 191 of glycine to arginine to permit carboxyl-terminal processing and GPI linkage (22Aceto J. Kieber-Emmons T. Cines D.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 992-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To add DII (final amino acid sequences 1–92, 192–281, and 93–191) to the carboxyl terminus of DI-DIII, DI-DIII/pcDNA and DII/pcDNA were used as templates in the second step of the PCR. To add DII to the amino terminus of DI-DIII (final amino acid sequences 93–191, 1–92, 192–281), the wild type sequence at position 191 was restored. DII/pcDNA and DI-DIII/pcDNA were then used as templates in the second step of the PCR. After the nucleotide sequence of each final construct was confirmed, COS cells were transfected using Lipofectin. Expression levels of uPAR were measured by ELISA using polyclonal anti-uPAR antibody. Binding of anti-uPAR and scuPA to cells expressing each variant were demonstrated to be >90% PI-PLC-sensitive. Specific binding of 125I-scuPA to these transiently transfected cells was measured as described below. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis within the second domain of uPAR, residues 137–145, was performed both in clusters and as individual mutations. cDNA encoding the full-length uPAR, generously provided by F. Blasi (Milan, Italy), was subcloned into pBluSK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to generate pBluSK/uPAR(EcoRI-HinIII). The five residues, Arg137, Lys139, Arg142, His143, and Arg145, were all mutated to alanine (Arg137 → Ala, Lys139 → Ala, Arg142 → Ala, His143 → Ala, and Arg145 → Ala), designated m5A) using the ExSite PCR-based Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). pBluSK- uPAR (EcoRI-HinIII) was amplified using the sense oligonucleotide 5′ GCCGCCCTCGCTGGCTGTGGCTACCTTCCCGGC 3′ and the antisense oligonucleotide 5′ GTCATCCTCTTGTATCCCCTTCACCTTCCTGGAT 3′. The recombinant clone, designated pBluSK-m5A-uPAR, was subcloned into pTracer-SV40 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at the KpnI site to yield pTracer-m5A-uPAR. pTracer-m5A-uPAR was then used as template to generate pTracer-m2A-uPAR (Lys139 → Ala and His143 → Ala, designated m2A) or pTracer-m3A-uPAR (Arg137 → Ala, Arg142 → Ala, and Arg145 → Ala, designated m3A) using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). Mutation of individual residues was performed using a two-step PCR (23Landt, O., Grunert, H.-P., and Hahn, U. (1990) Gene (Amst.) 125–128Google Scholar) with pTracer-SV40/uPAR (KpnI) as the template. Plasmid DNA was transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells using Lipofectin, and the cells were grown in 10% Dulbecco's minimum essential medium, 10% fetal bovine serum and selected for Zeocin resistance. Clones expressing high, intermediate, and low levels of uPAR were chosen based on the ELISA and/or flow cytometry with rabbit polyclonal anti-uPAR antibody (24Higazi A.A.-R. Aceto J.F. Kniss D.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6884-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) in the presence and absence of PI-PLC. scuPA, suPAR, and soluble domain I of suPAR (sDI) were radiolabeled with Na125I (NEN Life Science Products) using IODO-BEADS (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Free 125I was removed by gel filtration using Sephadex G-25 (PD-10, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Stable 293 cells lines expressing either wild type uPAR or variant uPAR were subcultured onto poly-d-lysine 96-well Biocoat Multiwell tissue culture plates (Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA) at an initial cell density of 1 × 105 and grown for 1–2 days by which time they reached confluence. To measure the binding of125I-scuPA, the cells were pre-chilled for 30 min at 4 °C and washed twice with ice-cold binding buffer composed of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 1% BSA. The cells were then incubated with 0.15–20 nm125I-scuPA in the presence or absence of 100-fold molar excess unlabeled ligand for 1 h at 4 °C in binding buffer, washed 4 times with the same buffer, and the cell-bound ligand was eluted with glycine buffer, pH 2.8. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific binding from total binding. In some experiments cells were treated with PI-PLC (1 unit/ml) at 37 °C for 1 h before binding was measured. cDNAs encoding soluble wild type uPAR (amino acids 1–277), soluble domain II + III (amino acids, 88–277), and variant full-length uPA receptor sequences (designated m2A, m3A, and m5A, see below) were generated by polymerase chain reaction using pTracer-uPAR, pTracer-m2uPAR, pTracer-m3uPAR, or pTracer-m5uPAR as templates. The fragments were digested with BglII and Xho and subcloned into the expression vector (pMT/BiP/V5, Invitrogen). Wild type and variant suPARs or soluble domains were expressed inDrosophila Schneider S2 cells (DES system, Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. Small scale preparations of suPAR and variants were purified from the media using a polyclonal anti-uPAR antibody affinity column. For large scale preparation, S2 cell culture supernatants were filtered and the media loaded onto a 40 GM hydroxyapatite column equilibrated with 10 mm K2HPO4, pH 7.0. The column was then eluted with a gradient of 10–200 mmK2HPO4, pH 7.0, and the suPAR-containing fractions were identified by Western blotting. Fractions containing monomeric suPAR eluted between 50 and 120 mmK2HPO4. Fractions containing monomeric suPAR were pooled, concentrated, and further purified using C8 RP-HPLC. Crude suPAR (20 mg of total protein) was loaded in a volume of 2 ml onto a semi-preparative (10 × 25 cm) C8 column and eluted at a flow rate of 4 ml/min with a linear gradient of 0–70% solvent B where solvent A was 100% H2O, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and solvent B was 100% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. suPAR eluted as a single broad peak under these conditions with a retention time of approximately 27 min. SDS-PAGE analysis of suPAR purified in this manner demonstrated a single major peak at 35 kDa under non-reducing conditions. Also observed was a slight laddering effect with 3–4 minor higher molecular weight species. These were determined to be SDS stable aggregates of suPAR, which disappeared when SDS-PAGE was performed under reducing conditions. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry revealed a single broad peak with an average mass of 34,797. The predicted mass based on the amino acid sequence is 30,672 indicating the presence of about 4 kDa of glycosylation. Expression levels of suPAR were typically 30 mg/liter determined by ELISA. Purification yielded about 10–12 mg of pure suPAR protein per liter of culture supernatant. suPAR was digested with chymotrypsin to generate sDI and sDII-DIII. Chymotrypsin was added to suPAR (1 mg/ml in PBS) at a final molar ratio of suPAR:chymotrypsin of 1000:1, and the digest was allowed to proceed for 2 h at room temperature. The digest was quenched by addition of Pefablock (100 μm final concentration). sDI and sDII-DIII were separated using C8 RP-HPLC. sDI and sDII-DIII eluted with retention times of approximately 27 and 25 min, respectively. Purified sD1 was sequenced and a single amino terminus was observed beginning with RS (representing the two extra amino acids present in this construct) followed by KR, amino acids 1 and 2 in the mature suPAR sequence. Sequencing of sDII-DIII revealed a single amino terminus as well, beginning with amino acids SRS corresponding to amino acids 88–90 in the mature suPAR sequence. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectral analysis revealed a single peak for sD1 (mass = 11,041 Da) and several peaks for sDII-DIII (mass = 23,846, 23,691, 22,936, and 22,800). These were presumed to be glycosylation isoforms, although additional digestion of sDII-DIII from the carboxyl terminus could not be excluded. However, no consensus chymotryptic cleavage site that could result in the observed mass differences is present at the carboxyl terminus of sDII-DIII. The capacity of wild type and variant suPAR to compete with the binding of wt-suPAR to scuPA was measured as described (24Higazi A.A.-R. Aceto J.F. Kniss D. Upson R. Cohen R. Dichek D.A. Cines D.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6884-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Briefly, binding of 125I-wild type suPAR (10 nm) to a stably transfected CHO cell line expressing GPI-anchored scuPA was measured in the presence of varying concentrations of unlabeled wild type and variant full-length suPAR (24Higazi A.A.-R. Aceto J.F. Kniss D. Upson R. Cohen R. Dichek D.A. Cines D.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6884-6890Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In other experiments, binding of 125I-sDI (50 nm) to scuPA-CHO cells was measured in the presence of varying concentrations of wild type sDII-DIII (100–400 nm) for 1 h at 4 °C. Binding of scuPA to suPAR was measured using a BIA 3000 optical Biosensor (Biacore, AB, Sweden) (25Myszka D.G. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1997; 8: 50-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). This method detects binding interactions in real time by measuring changes in the refractive index at a biospecific surface, enabling the association and dissociation rate constants to be calculated. For these studies, wild type or variant suPAR was coupled to a CM5-research grade sensor chip flow cell (Biacore, AB, Sweden) via standard amine coupling procedures (26Johnsson B. Lofas S. Lindquist G. Edstrom A. Muller-Hillgran R.-M. Hanson A. J. Mol. Recognit. 1995; 8: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) usingN-hydroxysuccinimide/N-ethyl-N′-[3-(dimethylamino) propyl]carbodiimine hydrochloride (Pierce) at a level of 500 response units. The sensor surface was coated with suPAR (10 μg/ml) in 10 mm NaAc buffer, pH 5.0. After immobilization, non-reactive groups were blocked with 1 m ethanolamine, pH 8.5. A second flow cell, similarly activated and blocked without immobilization of protein, served as a control. All binding reactions were performed in PBS, pH 7.4, containing 0.005% Tween 20. Binding of scuPA was measured at 25 °C at a flow rate of 60 μl/min for 2 min, followed by 2 min of dissociation. The bulk shift due to changes in refractive index measured using a blank surface was subtracted from the binding signal at each condition to correct for nonspecific signals. Surfaces were regenerated with 1 × 18-s pulse of 1 m NaCl/HCl, pH 3.5, followed by an injection of binding buffer for 1 min to remove this high salt solution. All injections were performed using the RANDOM command in the automated method. Binding of scuPA was measured using 2-fold dilutions over a range of concentrations (12.5 to 0.2 nm for WT-scuPA, 50 to 0.4 nm for m2A-suPAR, 200 to 12.5 nm for m3A-suPAR, and 400 to 25 nmfor m5A-suPAR). Data, collected at 2.5 Hz, were fit to a 1:1 Langmuir reaction mechanism using global analysis in the BIA evaluation 3.0 software (Biacore, AB, Sweden). Secondary plots of the data (ln(‖dR/dt‖) versus t) were also performed to unmask any contribution of mass transport to the kinetic data. The capacity of suPAR variants to promote scuPA-mediated plasminogen activation was measured using a chromogenic assay, as described (27Higazi A.A.-R. Cohen R.L. Henkin J. Kniss D. Schwartz B.S. Cines D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17375-17380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, scuPA (5 nm) was incubated with various concentrations of wild type suPAR, m2A-suPAR, and m5A-suPAR in the presence of 10 nmplasminogen and 500 μm chromogenic substrate (Spectrozyme-PL) and the absorbance (405 nm) was measured over time in a Thermomax microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). cDNA encoding GPI-linked uPAR DII-III was generated by two-step PCR using pBluSK/uPAR as template and subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) at EcoRI and HindIII sites. Stable lines in 293 cells were developed under G418 selection as described above. Expression of uPAR DII–DIII was confirmed by flow cytometry using affinity purified rabbit polyclonal anti-uPAR IgG in the presence and absence of PI-PLC. 293 cells expressing wild type or variant GPI-anchored uPAR domains II–III or mock-transfected cells were incubated with 125I-sDI (50 nm) in the absence or presence of scuPA (0–500 nm) for 1 h at 4 °C in PBS, 1% BSA. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold binding buffer, and the cell-associated radioactivity was measured as above. The method of Ploug (20Ploug M. Ostergaard S. Hansen L.B.L. Holm A. Dano K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3612-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was followed with minor modifications. Briefly, SLN-Bpa-SQYLWS (AE-81) and SLNFSQYL-Bpa-S (AE-83) were synthesized in a stepwise manner by the Fmoc solid-phase method. Fmoc amino acids and Fmoc-Ser(tBu)-Wang resin were obtained from AnaSpec (San Jose, CA), and other reagents for peptide synthesis were from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). The synthesis was in a 0.1-mmol scale on a Applied Biosystems model 431A peptide synthesizer using 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium/1-hydroxybenzotriazole for activation. The peptides were cleaved from the resin, and the side chains were deprotected with trifluoroacetic acid containing 2.5% 1,2-ethanedithiol and 2.5% H2O. The resin was removed from the reaction mixture by filtration, and the peptides were precipitated with ether. The peptides were then purified by preparative reversed-phase HPLC on a Vydac C18 column (10 mm, 300 Angstrom, 10 × 25 cm) using a linear gradient from buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water) to buffer B (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile). The electrospray ion traps mass spectrometer (LCQ, Finingan, CA) was used to check the integrity of the peptides. Each peptide was iodinated using Bolton-Hunter reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as described (20Ploug M. Ostergaard S. Hansen L.B.L. Holm A. Dano K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3612-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To perform cross-linking, 5 μm WT- or m5AsuPAR was incubated with a mixture containing labeled and unlabeled peptide (100 μm final concentration) on ice for 90 min in the dark. Wells containing each mixture were uniformly positioned 1–2 cm from the light source (Philips TL/09 actinic lamp, 20-watt λmax = 365 nm). The reactions were terminated by adding SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The receptor concentrations were equalized based on protein staining on 12% SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, and the extent of cross-linking was assessed by autoradiography. There is considerable indirect evidence to suggest that each domain of uPAR contributes to the development of the high affinity binding site for scuPA. The purpose of our studies was to study the specific contribution of DII to this process. To begin to address this question, we measured the specific binding of125I-scuPA to COS cells expressing WT-uPAR and comparable levels of GPI-anchored uPAR variants in which the position of domain II within the receptor was moved to the amino terminus (DII-DI-DIII) or carboxyl terminus (DI-DIII-DII) of the molecule. scuPA (10 nm and 100 nm) bound specifically to cells expressing WT-uPAR as expected, whereas no specific binding to cells expressing comparable levels of either variant was seen (Fig.1), indicating that DII must be present between DI and DIII for the receptor to function normally. In accordance with this, deletion of DII from either entity or from wild type uPAR, leaving DI-DIII, did not restore binding (Fig. 1). No specific, receptor-dependent binding was detected to cells expressing GPI-linked uPAR-domain I at either ligand concentration (data not shown). These experiments indicate that DII must be present and must be present in its natural location for scuPA to bind to cell surface uPAR. Previous studies suggest that Arg53, Leu55, Trp57, and Leu66 in DI and His251 in DIII interface with scuPA. Computer-based analysis of the individual domains of uPAR revealed a single region in DII that had the highest likelihood of being expressed on the surface of the protein and might thereby contribute to the binding of scuPA (Fig. 2). Of interest, this region in DII (Arg137–Arg145) occupies a similar position with respect to the cysteine residues to the regions in domains I and III that also have a high probability of surface expression and have previously been implicated in scuPA binding (13Ploug M. Ellis V. FEBS Lett. 1994; 349: 163-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 17Ploug M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15606-16494Google Scholar, 19Gardsvoll H. Dano K. Ploug M. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3612-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Therefore, we targeted this region to examine the role of DII in scuPA binding and interdomain cooperativity. To examine the role of this region in DII, we generated wild type suPAR in S2 cells as well as a suPAR variant, designated m5A, in which five charged amino acids within this region (Arg137, Lys139, Arg142, His143, and Arg145) were mutated collectively to alanine. To characterize the binding affinity of m5A-suPAR, we first examined the capacity of the purified protein to inhibit the binding of125I-wild type suPAR (10 nm) to a previously characterized CHO cell line that expresses high levels of GPI-anchored scuPA (Fig. 3 and TableI). m5A-suPAR inhibited the binding of125I-WT suPAR to CHO-scuPA with an IC50 ∼16 μm, whereas unlabeled WT-suPAR inhibited binding with an IC50 of ∼10 nm.Table IAffinity of wild type and variant soluble uPA receptors for cell-associated single chain urokinaseLigandIC50μmWT-suPAR0.011 ± 0.003m2A-suPAR0.075 ± 0.35m3A-suPAR2.60 ± 1.60m5A-suPAR16.0 ± 11.3The IC50 (mean ± S.D.) for each form of uPAR was calculated from three separate inhibition experiments, each performed in triplicate.

Mutation of the five residues in the sequence Arg137–Arg145 thus leads to a greater than 1000-fold increase in the IC50 of suPAR for scuPA. To identify the contribution of the individual amino acids in this region in greater detail, we posited that the three arginines might constitute a functional group. Therefore, we restored either the three arginine"

https://openalex.org/W1641400530,"The homophilic binding of extracellular domains of membrane-bound immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) molecules is often required for intercellular adhesion and signaling. Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), a member of the IgSF, is a widely used tumor marker that functions in vitro as a homotypic intercellular adhesion molecule. CEA has also been shown to contribute to tumorigenicity by inhibiting cellular differentiation, an effect that requires the homophilic binding of its extracellular domains. It was of interest, therefore, to identify small subdomain sequences in CEA that could serve as a focus in the design of peptides that disrupt CEA-mediated intercellular adhesion. Three subdomains in the N-terminal domain of CEA, identified by site-directed deletions and point mutations, were shown to be required for intercellular adhesion. Cyclized peptides representing two of these subdomains, 42NRQII and80QNDTG, were found to be effective in blocking CEA-mediated cellular aggregation when added to CEA-expressing transfectants in suspension. Intermolecular binding involving each of these subdomains is therefore essential for intercellular adhesion and cannot be compensated for by known binding contributions of other regions in the CEA molecule. In further support of this assumption, the binding epitope of an anti-CEA monoclonal antibody (monoclonal antibody A20) known to block CEA-mediated adhesion, was shown to bridge two of the three required subdomains: 42NRQII and30GYSWYK."

(1994)J. Cell Biol. 125, 1213–1224; Hobbie, L., Fisher, A. S., Lee, S., Flint, A., and Krieger, M. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 20958–20970). Here, we pinpoint the site of the secretory block to an intermediate compartment between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi complex and show that the distributions of ER-Golgi recycling proteins, such as KDEL receptor and p23, as well as resident Golgi proteins, such as mannosidase II, are accordingly affected. At the nonpermissive temperature, neither the stability of the COPI complex nor its recruitment to donor Golgi membranes is affected. However, the binding of coatomer to the dilysine-based ER-retrieval motif is impaired in the absence of ε-COP, suggesting that dilysine signal binding is not the major means of COPI recruitment. Because expression of the exogenous chimera of ε-COP and green fluorescent protein in ldlF cells at nonpermissive temperature rapidly restores the wild type properties, ε-COP is likely to play an important role in the cargo selection events mediated by COPI.

However, the involvement of COPI in anterograde and/or retrograde transport both between the ER and the Golgi complex and within the Golgi complex is highly debated, and experiments supporting all of these functions have been reported (reviewed in Refs. 3Scales S.J. Gomez M. Kreis T.E. Int. Rev. Cytol. 2000; 95: 67-144Google Scholar and 8Cosson P. Letourneur F. Curr. Opin.

Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar). Several sorting signals have been identified in the early biosynthetic pathway between the Golgi complex and the ER, including the KKXX and KXKXX, or dilysine, retrieval motifs for integral membrane proteins and KDEL for soluble lumenal proteins of the ER (reviewed in Ref. 9Teasdale R.D. Jackson M.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 27-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar).

Science. 1994; 263: 1629-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), and this interaction may be physiological because certain COPI mutants in yeast are defective in retrieval of KKXX- and KDEL-bearing proteins from the Golgi (11Letourneur F.

Chem. 1996; 271: 30725-30730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). In vitro, coatomer can be reversibly disassembled into subcomplexes of α/ε/β′, β/δ, and γ/ζ (29Lowe M. Kreis T.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31364-31371Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and these interactions have been confirmed by two-hybrid analysis (30Faulstich D.

It has been proposed that different parts of COPI bind to distinct cytosolic signals to mediate sorting in different directions, such as α/ε/β′ binding to dilysine motifs for retrograde transport (10Cosson P.

Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Science. 1996; 273: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). However, other studies have shown that γ-COP can be cross-linked to KKXX motifs (31Harter C.

A. 1996; 93: 1902-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and indirect evidence suggests that coatomer has at least two dilysine binding sites (32Hudson R.T. Draper R.K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1901-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).A CHO cell line (ldlF) with a temperature-sensitive mutation in ε-COP (33Guo Q. Vasile E. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) has been shown to exhibit defects in the transport of newly synthesized proteins and in the maintenance of Golgi structure at the nonpermissive temperature (33Guo Q.

Chem. 1994; 269: 20958-20970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At nonpermissive temperature, ε-COP is rapidly degraded without affecting the levels of the other subunits, except for an ∼2-fold reduction in α-COP (35Guo Q. Penman M. Trigatti B.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11191-11196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 36Gu F. Aniento F. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1183-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). These phenotypes are corrected by stably transfecting wild type ε-COP (33Guo Q. Vasile E. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar,34Hobbie L. Fisher A.S. Lee S. Flint A. Krieger M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1999; 9: 821-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). We have used this ldlF cell line as a tool to examine the specific role of ε-COP in the COPI complex in the biosynthetic pathway. We find that at nonpermissive temperature, transport to the plasma membrane of the temperature-sensitive mutant of the glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus (ts-045-G) is blocked in an ER/Golgi intermediate compartment. In addition, we show that the distributions of recycling markers, such as KDEL receptor and p23, or resident Golgi proteins, such as mannosidase II, are also affected. At nonpermissive temperature, neither the stability of the COPI complex nor its recruitment to donor membranes is altered. However, the binding of coatomer to the dilysine ER-retrieval motif is impaired, indicating that coatomer recruitment to donor membranes and cargo selection are not identical but separate events. Because microinjection and expression of ε-COP-GFP cDNA in ldlF cells at nonpermissive temperature rapidly restores secretory function and Golgi structure, ε-COP is most likely involved in sorting/retrieval events in the early secretory pathway between the ER and Golgi and in the maintenance of Golgi structure.DISCUSSIONWe have taken advantage of the existence of a temperature-sensitive mammalian cell line (ldlF CHO cells) in which one of the coatomer subunits, ε-COP, is degraded at nonpermissive temperature to study the possible role played by this subunit in coatomer function. Our results suggest that ε-COP is not directly involved in the stability of the coatomer complex or in its recruitment to donor membranes. However, although coatomer still exists in the cells as a membrane-bound complex in the absence of ε-COP, transport from the ER to the plasma membrane of ts-045-G protein was blocked in an ER/Golgi intermediate compartment or in transport complexes. These results show that coatomer stability and recruitment to donor membranes are not sufficient for its proper function. In addition, we could show that, in the absence of ε-COP, binding of coatomer to the dilysine ER-retrieval motif was inhibited in vitro and that the distributions of the KDEL receptor (known to be involved in the retrieval of ER-resident proteins from the intermediate compartment and the Golgi complex) and the dilysine-containing protein p23 were alteredin vivo. At nonpermissive temperature, these proteins were redistributed to membranous structures to which the other non-ε-COP subunits of coatomer were bound. Because exogenously expressed ε-COP-GFP cDNA in ldlF cells at nonpermissive temperature rapidly colocalized with endogenous coatomer and restored all of the wild type properties, we conclude that ε-COP plays an important role in coatomer function, probably directly participating in sorting/retrieval events.Exactly how coat proteins are recruited to specific sites on the donor membrane to initiate budding is still unclear. Several lines of evidence suggest that cargo itself could stimulate coated vesicle formation. For example, the knockout in mice of the two mannose-6-phosphate receptors, the major cargoes of trans-Golgi network-derived clathrin-coated vesicles, results in decreased recruitment of AP-1 adaptors and clathrin to trans-Golgi network membranes (48Le Borgne R. Griffiths G. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2162-2170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the binding of the plasma membrane AP-2 adaptors to tyrosine-based motifs was shown to be strengthened upon clathrin coat formation, suggesting that cargo recognition and coat assembly are indeed coupled (49Rapoport I. Miyazaki M. Boll W. Duckworth B. Cantley L.C. Shoelson S. Kirchhausen T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2240-2250Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). By analogy, it has been proposed that some members of the p24 family, which can bind via their dilysine motifs to coatomer in vitro and are found in COPI-coated vesicles (13Fiedler K. Veit M. Stamnes M.A. Rothman J.E. Science. 1996; 273: 1396-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 18Sohn K. Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Bremser M. Lottspeich F. Fiedler K. Helms J.B. Wieland F.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 27Stamnes M.A. Craighead M.W. Hoe M.H. Lampen N. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8011-8015Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), may act in the donor membrane as cargo receptors and coatomer and/or ARF receptors. In fact, p23 and p24 cytoplasmic tails attached to artificial liposomes of physiological lipid composition appear sufficient to recruit coatomer in the presence of ARF-GTP to these membranes (21Bremser M. Nickel W. Schweikert M. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Hughes C.A. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Cell. 1999; 96: 495-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). However, our results suggest that in ldlF cells at nonpermissive temperature, coatomer can still be recruited to membranes in vitro and in vivo,despite impaired binding to dilysine motifs, consistent with the fact that coatomer can also bind to Golgi membranes via ARF-GTP, probably through the β/δ subunits (20Pavel J. Harter C. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2140-2145Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It seems unlikely, then, that the members of the p24 family act as the sole receptors for coatomer. It has actually been shown recently that p24 family proteins may be involved in protein sorting by modulating the COPI stimulation of the ARF GTPase activity (50Goldberg J. Cell. 2000; 100: 671-679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), which is in agreement with the observed binding of ARF to coatomer in close proximity of the dilysine-binding domain (51Zhao L. Helms J.B. Brunner J. Wieland F.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14198-14203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Zhu et al. (52Zhu Y. Traub L.M. Kornfeld S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 537-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) recently reported that, similarly, mannose 6-phosphate receptor tails are not essential determinants in the initial steps of AP-1 binding to the trans-Golgi network but are most likely involved in sorting steps by modulating ARF GTPase activity. COPI complex may thus be recruited on Golgi membranes via ARF in its GTP bound form, and p24 family proteins may then contribute to stabilize or destabilize this primary complex due to particular sequences in their dilysine-containing (or diphenylalanine-containing) tail.Although we showed that ε-COP plays a major role in sorting, we did not demonstrate a direct interaction between ε-COP and KKXX motifs, and we thus do not exclude the possibility that in the absence of ε-COP, binding to KKXX motifs was altered through the other subunits of the α/β′/ε subcomplex that is thought to mediate binding to KKXX motifs. Indeed, yeast genetic studies have shown that coatomer from α-COP and β′-COP mutants has lost the ability to bind dilysine motifs in vitro. (11Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Demolliere C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Also, the KDEL receptor, although it is a well established cargo of COPI-coated vesicles, has not been shown to interact directly with coatomer (18Sohn K. Orci L. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Bremser M. Lottspeich F. Fiedler K. Helms J.B. Wieland F.T. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1239-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 53Orci L. Stamnes M. Ravazzola M. Amherdt M. Perrelet A. Sollner T.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 335-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). However, our observation that in the absence of ε-COP KDEL receptor redistributes into similar structures to the dilysine-containing p23 suggests that they use similar recycling mechanisms, perhaps implicating ε-COP. This is consistent with genetic experiments performed in yeast, implicating COPI in retrieval of both KKXX- and KDEL-containing proteins (11Letourneur F. Gaynor E.C. Hennecke S. Demolliere C. Duden R. Emr S.D. Riezman H. Cosson P. Cell. 1994; 79: 1199-1207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar, 12Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R.

Nature. 1995; 375: 806-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar).In ldlF cells at nonpermissive temperature, not only the sorting of recycling proteins but also that of secretory proteins was perturbed. Transport to the plasma membrane of newly synthesized ts-045-G protein was indeed blocked in structures that were positive for β′-COP, and most likely also for KDEL receptor and p23. Similarly, we have previously shown that microinjection of antibodies against a synthetic peptide of β-COP, EAGE, blocks transport of ts-045-G to the cell surface, at the interface of the ER and the Golgi, in tubular structures containing ERGIC-53 (55Pepperkok R. Scheel J. Horstmann H. Hauri H.P. Griffiths G. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1993; 74: 71-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), suggesting that ts-045-G protein may be arrested in similar compartments in ldlF cells at nonpermissive temperature and in EAGE-microinjected cells. These structures might represent the TCs recently described in Vero cells (5Scales S.J. Pepperkok R. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 1137-1148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), although we cannot exclude the possibility that ts-045-G is arrested in the Golgi, which is also scattered at nonpermissive temperature in ldlF cells (33Guo Q. Vasile E. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). A model was proposed (5Scales S.J. Pepperkok R. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 1137-1148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 56Lowe M. Kreis T.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1404: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) in which COPII-coated vesicles form from the ER, cluster into vesicular tubular structures, as proposed by Balch and co-workers (57Balch W.E. McCaffery J.M. Plutner H. Farquhar M.G. Cell. 1994; 76: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 58Bannykh S.I. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and fuse to form TCs. Subsequently, COPI replaces COPII, and the TCs to interact with microtubules and move toward the Golgi complex (5Scales S.J. Pepperkok R. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 1137-1148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 37Shima D.T. Scales S.J. Kreis T.E. Pepperkok R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 821-824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In this model, COPI is required to retrieve material to the ER from the TC and the Golgi complex. Our observations of the phenotypes of ldlF cells are consistent with this model: we showed that coatomer in ldlF cells at nonpermissive temperature loses the ability to bind dilysine motifsin vitro, which could explain several of the defects we observed in these cells. If the steady state localizations of KDEL receptor and p23 require proper recycling between the Golgi complex and/or between the intermediate compartment and the ER, the inhibition of coatomer binding to motifs required for sorting and retrieval of these proteins would alter their distributions, as we observed. It could also explain the arrest of ts-045-G protein in an intermediate compartment between the ER and the Golgi (perhaps the TC); if the retrieval function of COPI is inhibited in ldlF cells at nonpermissive temperature, factors required for earlier steps in the secretory pathway (e.g. v-SNARES, ERGIC-53, and COPII-associated proteins) would not be removed, and transfer of cargo to the Golgi would be impaired. One of the proposed roles for the abundant p23 protein is that it contributes to the structure of the intermediate compartment (16Rojo M. Pepperkok R. Emery G. Kellner R. Stang E. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1119-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 22Rojo M. Emery G. Marjomaki V. McDowall A.W. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1043-1057Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, missorting of p23 induced by degradation of ε-COP could potentially explain the structural changes observed in the membranous compartments of the early biosynthetic pathway.The reasons for the observed distribution of the Golgi enzyme mannosidase II in ldlF cells at nonpermissive temperature are less clear. To some extent, it is reminiscent of the effect observed with the drug BFA, the earliest detected effect of which is the removal of β-COP from Golgi membranes, resulting in the extension of tubules from the Golgi to the ER and the subsequent disappearance of the Golgi, with the redistribution of Golgi membrane proteins to the ER (59Lippincott-Schwartz J. Donaldson J.G. Schweizer A. Berger E.G. Hauri H.P. Yuan L.C. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1990; 60: 821-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar, 60Strous G.J. Berger E.G. van Kerkhof P. Bosshart H. Berger B. Geuze H.J. J. Biol. Cell. 1991; 71: 25-31Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In ldlF cells at nonpermissive temperature, Golgi structure has been shown to be dramatically altered, dissociating into vesicles and tubules (33Guo Q. Vasile E. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). However, we observed that in ldlF cells at nonpermissive temperature, mannosidase II was still associated with patches positive for β′-COP that were not observed in ldlF cells at permissive or nonpermissive temperature after BFA treatment. This is consistent with the observation that dissociation of coatomer from membranes is required for BFA-induced transfer of Golgi enzymes to the endoplasmic reticulum (61Scheel J. Pepperkok R. Lowe M. Griffiths G. Kreis T.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 319-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It is thus possible that the membrane-bound ε-COP-depleted coatomer, although it lost at least part of its sorting capacity, conserved its ability to prevent premature fusion of transport intermediate. An extension of the transport model mentioned above predicts not only that TCs mature as they travel toward the Golgi complex but also that they could potentially fuse with each other to form the cis-Golgi network (5Scales S.J. Pepperkok R. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 1137-1148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 62Bannykh S.I. Rowe T. Balch W.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 19-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). Because we have shown that TC maturation is blocked by the inactivation of ε-COP (this work and Ref. 5Scales S.J. Pepperkok R. Kreis T.E. Cell. 1997; 90: 1137-1148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), this could also explain the observed changes in Golgi structure. This is consistent with recent data showing COPI to be necessary for the in vitro formation of vesiculo-tubular clusters (TC precursors) from transitional ER microsomes (63Lavoie C. Paiement J. Dominguez M. Roy L. Dahan S. Gushue J.N. Bergeron J.J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 285-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar).In conclusion, although a coatomer complex is still able to form and be recruited to membranes in ldlF cells at nonpermissive temperature, secretory function, protein sorting, and Golgi structure are affected. Exogenously expressed ε-COP-GFP, which rapidly incorporates into a nonfunctional coatomer devoid of ε-COP, restores all of the wild type properties, suggesting that ε-COP is essential for the proper functioning of coatomer. In addition, the ability of ε-COP-deficient coatomer to bind membranes without binding to KKXX motifs suggests that coatomer recruitment occurs prior to cargo selection rather than being directly coupled to it. Coated vesicles participate in sorting and transport of newly synthesized proteins in the early secretory pathway. To date, two coat protein (COP)1 complexes, COPI and COPII, have been identified that mediate transport between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi complex (1Schekman R. Orci L. Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar, 2Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 3Scales S.J. Gomez M.

To examine the effect of this interaction on ligand binding and kinase activation in the type II isozyme of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (cGKII), alanine was substituted for the conserved threonine or serine. cGKII was found to require the C2 amino group of cGMP and its cognate serine or threonine hydroxyl for efficient cGMP activation. Of the two binding sites, disruption of cGMP-specific binding in the NH2-terminal binding site had the greatest effect on cGMP-dependent kinase activation, like cGKI. However, ligand dissociation studies showed that the location of the rapid and slow dissociation sites of cGKII was reversed relative to cGKI. Another set of mutations that prevented cyclic nucleotide binding demonstrated the necessity of the NH2-terminal, rapid dissociation binding site for cyclic nucleotide-dependent activation of cGKII. These findings suggest distinct mechanisms of activation for cGKII and cGKI isoforms.

In the absence of cAMP, cAK is a tetrameric holoenzyme that is composed of two regulatory subunits associated with two catalytic subunits. These regulatory subunits inhibit kinase activity through the association of their auto-inhibitory region with the catalytic subunit. The cGK holoenzyme consists of a dimer of two identical subunits, with each subunit possessing a regulatory and catalytic domain. Although these represent significant structural differences between the cAK and cGK families, the mechanism of activation by cyclic nucleotides is thought to be similar. Kinase activation in both enzyme families depends on cyclic nucleotide occupation of the two cyclic nucleotide binding sites in the regulatory domain. This event dramatically reduces the affinity of the auto-inhibition region of the regulatory domain for the catalytic domain (13Herberg F.W. Taylor S.S. Dostmann W.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2934-2942Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 14Francis S.H. Smith J.A. Colbran J.L. Grimes K. Walsh K.A. Kumar S. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20748-20755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition to the regulation of activation, these binding sites impart the cyclic nucleotide specificity to the kinase and are in a tandem arrangement thought to result from gene duplication during evolution (1Shabb J.B. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5723-5726Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These sites are described by their distinct rates of dissociation of bound cyclic nucleotide (fast and slow), which is presumed to reflect the different ligand affinities of the two sites. A notable structural difference between the cyclic nucleotide binding sites of cAMP and cGMP-dependent protein kinases is the reversal of location of the slow and fast binding sites relative to the NH2 terminus, a feature termed the structural order of the two binding sites (15Rannels S.R. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 7085-7088Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Ogreid D. Doskeland S.O. Gorman K.B. Steinberg R.A. J. Biol.

Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1997; 31: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the structural order in cAK is defined by the presence of a fast dissociation site that is proximal to the NH2 terminus relative to the slow dissociation binding site (19Woodford T.A. Correll L.A. McKnight G.S. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13321-13328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Compared with cAK, the structural order of both cGKI isoforms is reversed so that the fast dissociation site of both cGKIα and cGKIβ are distal to the NH2 terminus relative to the slow dissociation site (17Reed R.B. Sandberg M. Jahnsen T. Lohmann S.M. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17570-17575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Reed R.B. Sandberg M.

Detailed studies of the relationship between the contribution of each binding site to kinase activation and the structural order of the binding sites have revealed important distinctions in the mechanisms of activation between cAK and cGK. The activation of cAK has been found to strongly depend on cyclic nucleotide binding to the COOH-terminal, slow dissociation binding site (20Saraswat L.D. Ringheim G.E. Bubis J. Taylor S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18241-18246Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Bubis J. Neitzel J.J. Saraswat L.D. Taylor S.S. J. Biol.

Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These changes decrease the affinity of the regulatory and catalytic subunit for each other (23Houge G. Steinberg R.A. Ogreid D. Doskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19507-19516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Symcox M.M. Cauthron R.D. Ogreid D. Steinberg R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23025-23031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and expose the NH2-terminal rapid dissociation cAMP binding site (25Rannels S.R. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7871-7876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ogreid D. Doskeland S.O. FEBS Lett. 1981; 129: 282-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 27Ogreid D. Doskeland S.O. FEBS Lett. 1981; 129: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). cAMP occupation of the NH2-terminal fast dissociation site decreases the affinity of the regulatory subunit for the catalytic subunit even further (23Houge G. Steinberg R.A. Ogreid D. Doskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19507-19516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and slows the cAMP dissociation and association rates for the COOH-terminal slow dissociation binding site (28Doskeland S.O. Ogreid D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2291-2301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of the integrity of the COOH-terminal, slow dissociation binding site for cAK activation by cyclic nucleotides is revealed by the dramatic increase in K a caused by mutagenesis of this site relative to effect of mutagenesis of the NH2-terminal, rapid dissociation site (19Woodford T.A. Correll L.A. McKnight G.S. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13321-13328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Houge G. Steinberg R.A. Ogreid D. Doskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19507-19516Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, for cAK, the relative contribution of a particular binding site to kinase activation correlates with the affinity of that site for cAMP. Investigations of cGKI activation have shown that cGMP binds to a slowly dissociating cyclic nucleotide binding site and induces a conformational change resulting in a partially active kinase (29Landgraf W. Hofmann F. Pelton J.T. Huggins J.P. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9921-9928Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 30Wolfe L. Francis S.H. Landiss L.R. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16906-16913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequent occupation of the second, rapid dissociation site imparts additional conformational changes in the enzyme until it forms the elongated shape that is associated with the fully active enzyme (31Zhao J. Trewhella J. Corbin J. Francis S. Mitchell R. Brushia R. Walsh D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31929-31936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar,32Chu D.M. Corbin J.D. Grimes K.A. Francis S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31922-31928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In cGKIα and cGKIβ, cGMP-specific binding to each binding site was disrupted by substitution of a highly conserved threonine residue with alanine (17Reed R.B. Sandberg M. Jahnsen T. Lohmann S.M. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17570-17575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Reed R.B. Sandberg M. Jahnsen T. Lohmann S.M. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1997; 31: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Ligand binding studies of the intact site of these mutants demonstrated that the slow dissociation site was NH2-terminal to the rapid dissociation site. Additionally, the mutation in the slow dissociation binding pocket of the cGKI isoforms had a greater effect on cGMP-dependent kinase activity than the same mutation in the fast dissociation binding pocket (17Reed R.B. Sandberg M. Jahnsen T. Lohmann S.M. Francis S.H. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17570-17575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 18Reed R.B. Sandberg M.

Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6122-6127Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For cGKI, these results showed that the slow dissociation site that induced partial activation of the enzyme (30Wolfe L. Francis S.H. Landiss L.R. Corbin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16906-16913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Corbin J.D. Doskeland S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11391-11397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was the amino-terminal binding site. There are allosteric interactions between all of the following factors involved in kinase activation: cyclic nucleotide binding at each of the binding pockets, ATP binding, and the interactions between catalytic and regulatory domains of the protein kinases (22Doskeland S.O. Maronde E. Gjertsen B.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1178: 249-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 35Hofmann F. Dostmann W. Keilbach A. Landgraf W. Ruth P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Although these interactions are complex, the results of the studies suggest that for both cAK and cGK, the binding pocket with the slowest rate of ligand dissociation also has the greatest contribution to kinase activation, and that this relationship is independent of the structural order of the cyclic nucleotide binding sites for the two enzymes. This study represents the first description of the structural order of the cyclic nucleotide binding sites in cGKII and their influence on kinase activation. Here we describe the behavior of cyclic nucleotide binding mutants of cGKII and report that the ligand dissociation kinetics of the cGKII sites resemble cAK more closely than cGKI. We also demonstrate that the amino-terminal, fast dissociation cGMP binding site is critical for cGKII activation. Additionally, these findings define a structural target for the design of molecular agents that would specifically prevent activation of the enzyme and attenuate the effects of enterotoxins. The T242A, S366A, T242A/S366A, G231E, and G355E substitutions in the cGKII cyclic nucleotide binding site domains were performed by a PCR-based, two-step, site-directed mutagenesis strategy similar to what has been described previously (36Gamm D.M. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7227-7232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), using oligonucleotides synthesized at the University of Michigan Biomedical Research Core Facilities. To ensure there were no extraneous mutations introduced by the PCR, all mutant constructs were sequenced using the dideoxy nucleotide chain termination method and a modified T7 polymerase (Sequenase, U. S. Biochemical Corp.). The Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used for high level protein expression in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells. The entire open reading frame of each hexahistidine-tagged mutant cGKII was excised from the CMV.Neo mammalian expression vector using BglII, and subsequently inserted into the BamHI site in the pFastBac plasmid. The Sf9 cells were maintained in SFM 900 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone). The transfectant medium containing virus was amplified twice to create a viral stock. For protein production, 1 × 108 Sf9 cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection of 10 and grown in a 250-ml culture for 72 h at 27 °C prior to centrifugation and freezing the cell pellet at −70 °C. For purification of the hexahistidine-tagged cGKII proteins from the Sf9 pellet, the pellets were sonicated three times for 10 s in ice-cold buffer A (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1% Triton X-100, 200 mm NaCl) containing Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The solution was centrifuged for 30 min at 4 °C, 10 mm imidazole was added to the solution, and the sample spun again for another 30 min. The supernatant was collected, filtered through a 0.45-μm cellulose acetate filter (VWR Scientific), allowed to bind to 1 ml of nickel affinity resin (Qiagen), and washed with 20 volumes of buffer A before the hexahistidine-tagged cGKII was eluted with a stepwise gradient of increasing concentrations of imidazole from 10 to 250 mm. For optimal long term storage of the wild type and mutant enzymes, freshly purified enzyme was stored at −20 °C in a solution containing 50% glycerol, 50 mm KPO4, pH 6.8, 25 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1% BSA. These storage conditions stabilized the enzyme kinetics for all mutants for at least 8 months. Of note, sucrose solutions (1–20%) with 10 or 50 mm KPO4, pH 6.8, 25 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 0 or 0.1% BSA, 0 or 150 mm NaCl did not stabilize cGKII activity when stored at −70 °C, unlike the optimal storage conditions reported for the cGKI isoforms (37Francis S.H. Wolfe L. Corbin J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 332-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad Bradford protein assay that had been standardized with several independently purified samples of cGKII. The protein concentrations of these samples were also determined by amino acid analysis (University of Michigan Biomedical Core Facilities). The corrected protein concentrations based on amino acid analysis were used for the calculation of stoichiometry andV max of cGKII proteins. An approach modified from the studies of cGMP binding in cGKI was employed to determine the dissociation rate and stoichiometry of wild type and mutant cGKIIs (38Mackenzie III, C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5589-5593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Mackenzie C.W. d. Int. J. Biochem. 1981; 13: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 40Doskeland S.O.

Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Wild type or mutant cGKII was added to a final concentration of 450 nm in a reaction mixture that contained KPEH buffer (5 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.8, 1 mm EDTA, 25 mm β-mercaptoethanol buffer, and 0.5 mg/ml histone IIA), 0.1 mg/ml BSA, 50 μm cGMP, and 3.2 μm [3H]cGMP (specific activity, 15.6 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 20 min and then cooled for 10 min on ice. Maximal saturation of binding (Bo ) under these conditions was determined by precipitating two 30-μl samples of the reaction mix in 3 ml of ice-cold 100% saturated (NH4)2SO4. To separate [3H]cGMP bound to the precipitated cGKII from free [3H]cGMP, the mixture was filtered through a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filter paper (Millipore) and washed three times with ice-cold 100% saturated (NH4)2SO4. Ammonium sulfate (95% saturated) with 10 mm Tris base was found to be an equally effective precipitating solution, as noted for cGKI (40Doskeland S.O. Vintermyr O.K. Corbin J.D. Ogreid D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 3534-3540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The filter was placed in a scintillation counting vial containing 1.6 ml of 2% SDS, shaken vigorously and 10 ml of Biodegradable Counting Scintillant (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) added before the samples were counted. Background values of [3H]cGMP binding to cGKII averaged 10% of maximal saturation for all except the G231E and G355E mutants, which showed a background approaching 20% ofBo , consistent with the lower binding stoichiometry of these proteins. These background values were subtracted from the observed counts to generate the dissociation function and t ½ values. A buffer blank showed less than 0.01% quenching and 3H2O contamination was determined to be less than 0.9% by filtration of [3H]cGMP stock solution over a DEAE Sephadex A-25 column that was equilibrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.5, and eluted with 0.5 m NaCl (42Martins T.J. Mumby M.C. Beavo J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1973-1979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the time course of [3H]cGMP dissociation from the two cGMP binding sites, a 100-fold excess of unlabeled cGMP was added to the reaction mix and vortexed immediately before 30-μl samples taken for analysis as described above. Thet ½ values expressed for the enzyme represent the amount of time required for each binding site to reach one-half of the value seen at maximal saturation. These values (shown in Table I) were determined after accounting for independent contributions of the slow and rapid dissociation site to each function as described previously (43Rannels S.R. Corbin J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 99: 168-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The dissociation function is expressed as the natural log of the ratio of the ligand bound after addition of 100× cold cGMP (B′) over the maximum of bound ligand (Bo ). The abscissa does not show the dissociation function after −2, or 13.5% of the signal to noise ratio. The stoichiometry of [3H]cGMP to cGKII was determined by assuming a molecular mass of 86 kDa.Table I[ 3 H]cGMP dissociation rates for cGKII binding site mutantscGKII proteint½NH2-terminal siteCOOH-terminal siteminWild type0.18 ± 0.054.0 ± 1.3T242A0.07 ± 0.047.2 ± 1.1G231E6.2 ± 1.7S366A1.7 ± 0.70.04 ± 0.01G355E0.91 ± 0.58T242A/S366A(0.10 ± 0.03)The average values for t½ were determined from four to seven experiments as described under “Materials and Methods” and are expressed with their S.E.

Fig. 2 shows experiments that represent those used to calculate these values as well as the average stoichiometry of 3H cGMP binding. Kinase activity was assessed with varying concentrations of cyclic nucleotide added to each well of a 96-well plate containing a phosphotransferase mixture consisting of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mm isobutylmethylxanthine, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mg/ml BSA, 200 μm cold ATP, 11 nm[γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 200–300 cpm/pmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 100 μm synthetic H2Btide (Arg-Lys-Arg-Ser-Arg-Ala-Glu) as the phosphate acceptor. The reaction was initiated by adding 10 μl of a 9.4 nm stock solution of cGKII enzyme that was kept on ice and diluted in buffer A with 25 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mg/ml BSA. For all reactions, the final cGKII concentration was 1.9 nm and the incubation time was 15 min. The maximum kinase activity detected under these conditions was 15% (or less) of the maximal phosphate incorporation possible for the assay, and none of the mutations affected the stability of maximal kinase activity over a 120-min period. All kinase reactions were terminated by spotting 25 μl of the reaction mixture onto P-81 phosphocellulose paper (Whatman) and washed three times in 75 mmH3PO4. Enzyme activity is expressed as percentage of maximum activation unless otherwise indicated, and specific activity is expressed as micromoles of phosphate transferred per minute of incubation time per milligram of cGKII added (μmol/min/mg). The K a values for each nucleotide were determined by Lineweaver-Burke analysis of three to eight experiments. To test the ability of various cGKII mutants to function in vivo, 175 ng of HCG-luciferase reporter construct (44Gamm D.M. Baude E.J. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15736-15742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) was co-transfected with 600 ng of the wild type or mutant hexahistidine cGKII construct or the empty vector (CMV.Neo) in addition to RSV β-galactosidase to control for transfection efficiency. Also included in the co-transfection mixture was a Flag-tagged PKIα construct to inhibit endogenous cAK activity. This construct was developed using a PCR-based mutagenesis strategy (45Collins S.P. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18169-18178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), using oligonucleotides synthesized at the University of Michigan Biomedical Research Core Facilities. DNA was co-transfected into HEK 293 cells in 35-mm wells. Cells at approximately 50% confluence were transfected using the calcium phosphate method (46Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar) and allowed to recover for 24 h after transfection in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum to allow expression of transfected genes. 8-Br-cGMP was then added to the medium at the indicated concentrations and allowed to incubate for 12 h prior to harvesting of cells for analysis for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity as described (44Gamm D.M. Baude E.J. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15736-15742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Expression levels of cGKII mutants were determined by Western blot analysis with a cGKII polyclonal antibody (47Collins S.P. Uhler M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8391-8404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The first goal of this study was to determine if the threonine or serine residue present in each of the cGKII binding pockets was responsible for cGMP-specific activation of the kinase. Based on the crystal structure of the type Iα isoform of the cAK regulatory subunit (RIα), the model structure in Fig. 1 A shows cGMP bound to the wild type cGKII amino-terminal cyclic nucleotide binding pocket. The hydrogen bond between the C2 amino group and the hydroxyl of the threonine, an interaction shown to be necessary for high affinity cGMP binding of cGKI (17Reed R.B. Sandberg M. Jahnsen T.

To test whether cGMP-specific activation requires such an interaction in cGKII, the first strategy involved substitution of an alanine for the highly conserved threonine or serine in the cGMP binding pocket of cGKII. Fig.1 B shows a schematic of the substitution of the threonine with an alanine, and the yellow circle indicates the absence of the hydrogen bond between cGMP and the cGKII cyclic nucleotide binding pocket. This substitution was predicted to attenuate both preferential cGMP binding and activation by removal of the participating threonine or serine hydroxyl. The second strategy examined the efficacy of cGKII activation by cyclic nucleotide analogs with substitutions of a number of substituents of the guanine ring. By comparing the results of this set of experiments with the effect of the alanine substitution, we were able to elucidate the importance of the cGMP C2 amino group and its cognate serine or threonine residue for cGKII activation by cGMP. The second goal of this study was to extend the observations of the effect of the alanine substitution on cGKII activation; this set of experiments examined the relative contribution of a single cyclic"
https://openalex.org/W1591531412,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae HIS3 gene is a model system to characterize transcription initiation from different types of core promoters. The NOT genes were identified by mutations that preferentially increased transcription of the HIS3 promoter lacking a canonical TATA sequence. They encode proteins associated in a complex that also contains the Caf1 and Ccr4 proteins. It has been suggested that the Ccr4-Not complex represses transcription by inhibiting factors more specifically required for promoters lacking a TATA sequence. A potential target is the yTaf(II)19 subunit of TFIID, which, when depleted, leads to a preferential decrease of HIS3 TATA-less transcription. We isolated conditional taf19 alleles that display synthetic growth phenotypes when combined with not4 or specific not5 alleles. Inactivation of yTaf(II)19p by shifting these mutants to the restrictive temperature led to a more rapid and striking decrease in transcription from promoters that do not contain a canonical TATA sequence. We demonstrated by the two-hybrid assay and directly in vitro that yTaf(II)19p and Not5p could interact. Finally, we found by the two-hybrid assay that yTaf(II)19p also interacted with many components of the Ccr4-Not complex. Taken together, our results provide evidence that interactions between Not5p and yTaf(II)19p may be involved in transcriptional regulation by the Ccr4-Not complex."

Here we measure the response by the wind-sensing system of the American cockroach (Periplaneta americana) to a complex hydrodynamic flow.

https://openalex.org/W1481695560,"During maize endosperm development, cells shift from a mitotic cycle to endoreduplication, driving the massive synthesis of storage proteins (zeins) and starch. In this developmental context, we studied changes in expression levels of histone H1 and high mobility group I/Y (HMG-I/Y), two chromatin architectural proteins that are known to affect gene transcription. Almost no change was found in the level of histone H1 during endosperm development, despite a dramatic increase in DNA content (endoreduplication); hence, the histone H1/DNA ratio decreased substantially. Concurrently with a reduction in the Cdc2 kinase activity at the shift to endoreduplication, significant changes were found in the level and mobility of the HMG-I/Y protein; the faster migrating forms were, at least partly, hypophosphorylated. Purified maize HMG-I/Y protein was found to be phophorylated in vitro by the Cdc2 kinase and bound efficiently to the gamma-zein promoter AT-rich tract (gammaZ-AT). Using an in vitro transcription assay, we demonstrated the capability of the maize HMG-I/Y protein to relieve the inhibitory effect exerted by histone H1 on templates containing the gammaZ-AT sequence. These data suggest that during maize endosperm development transcription and perhaps replication are controlled, at least partly, by the activity of the Cdc2 kinase and the interplay between histone H1 and HMG-I/Y proteins."
