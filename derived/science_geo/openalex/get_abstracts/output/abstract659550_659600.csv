https://openalex.org/W3085183323,"Knowing where our limbs are in space is essential for moving and for adapting movements to various changes in our environments and bodies. The ability to adapt movements declines with age, and age-related cognitive decline can explain a decreased ability to adopt and deploy explicit, cognitive strategies in motor learning. Age-related sensory decline could also lead to a reduced fidelity of sensory position signals and error signals, each of which can affect implicit motor adaptation. Here we investigate two estimates of limb position; one based on proprioception, the other on predicted sensory consequences of movements. Each is considered a measure of an implicit adaptation process and may be affected by both age and cognitive strategies. Both older (n = 38) and younger (n = 42) adults adapted to a 30° visuomotor rotation in a centre-out reaching task. We make an explicit, cognitive strategy available to half of participants in each age group with a detailed instruction. After training, we first quantify the explicit learning elicited by instruction. Instructed older adults initially use the provided strategy slightly less than younger adults but show a similar ability to evoke it after training. This indicates that cognitive explanations for age-related decline in motor learning are limited. In contrast, training induced much larger shifts of state estimates of hand location in older adults compared to younger adults. This is not modulated by strategy instructions, and appears driven by recalibrated proprioception, which is almost twice as large in older adults, while predictions might not be updated in older adults. This means that in healthy aging, some implicit processes may be compensating for other changes to maintain motor capabilities, while others also show age-related decline (data: https://osf.io/qzhmy)."
https://openalex.org/W3086703228,"This study investigated the efficacy of a culturally modified resilience education program on Japanese adolescents' well-being from a differential susceptibility perspective. First, a culturally modified resilience education intervention was developed by employing the SPARK resilience program and implemented with 407 Japanese high school students in Tokyo (age = 15-16, M = 192, F = 215). To test intervention efficacy, students' level of resilience, self-esteem, self-efficacy, and depression were measured pre-, post-, and three months after intervention. Additionally, sensory processing sensitivity, using the Japanese version of the Highly Sensitive Child Scale for Adolescence, was measured as an index of individual sensitivity. Analysis of variance was used to examine the baseline differences and interaction effects of students' gender and level of sensory processing sensitivity. Latent growth curve models were used to assess the overall effects of the intervention and change over time. Results indicated that the intervention was effective in enhancing students' overall self-efficacy; and that highly sensitive students, who scored significantly lower in well-being than their counterparts at baseline, responded more positively to the intervention, and had a greater reduction in depression and promotion of self-esteem. These findings provided unique evidence in line with the differential susceptibility perspective and useful implications to develop personalized treatment interventions for adolescents in different cultural contexts."
https://openalex.org/W3084684236,"The goal of this study was to determine the frequency of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs) in Escherichia coli and other Enterobacterales from turkeys in Canada and characterize the associated resistance determinants. Pooled fecal samples were collected in 77 turkey farms across British Columbia, Québec, and Ontario. Isolates were obtained with and without selective enrichment cultures and compared to isolates from diagnostic submissions of suspected colibacillosis cases in Ontario. Isolates were identified using MALDI-TOF and susceptibility to ESCs was assessed by disk diffusion. The presence of blaCMY, blaCTX-M, blaTEM, and blaSHV was tested by PCR. Transformation experiments were used to characterize blaCMY plasmids. Genome sequencing with short and long reads was performed on a representative sample of blaCTX-M-positive isolates to assess isolates relatedness and characterize blaCTX-M plasmids. For the positive enrichment cultures (67% of total samples), 93% (587/610) were identified as E. coli, with only a few other Enterobacterales species identified. The frequency of ESC resistance was low in E. coli isolates from diagnostic submission (4%) and fecal samples without selective enrichment (5%). Of the ESC-resistant Enterobacterales isolates from selective enrichments, 71%, 18%, 14%, and 8% were positive for blaCMY, blaTEM, blaCTX-M, and blaSHV, respectively. IncI1 followed by IncK were the main incompatibility groups identified for blaCMY plasmids. The blaCTX-M-1 gene was found repeatedly on IncI1 plasmids of the pMLST type 3, while blaCTX-M-15, blaCTX-M-55, and blaCTX-M-65 were associated with a variety of IncF plasmids. Clonal spread of strains carrying blaCTX-M genes between turkey farms was observed, as well as the presence of an epidemic blaCTX-M-1 plasmid in unrelated E. coli strains. In conclusion, Enterobacterales resistant to ESCs were still widespread at low concentration in turkey feces two years after the cessation of ceftiofur use. Although blaCMY-2 is the main ESC resistance determinant in E. coli from Canadian turkeys, blaCTX-M genes also occur which are often carried by multidrug resistance plasmids. Both clonal spread and horizontal gene transfer are involved in parallel in the spread of blaCTX-M genes in Enterobacterales from Canadian turkeys."
https://openalex.org/W3085004731,"The eucheumatoids Kappaphycus and Eucheuma are cultivated in tropical or subtropical regions for the production of carrageenan, a hydrocolloid widely used in the food and cosmetic industries. Kappaphycus alvarezii is a highly valued economic crop in the Coral Triangle, with the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia ranked among the largest producers. In the absence of measures to mitigate climate change, extreme events including heatwaves, typhoons, severe El Niño and La Niña, are expected to increase in frequency and magnitude. This inadvertently brings adverse effects to the seaweed cultivation industry, especially in the tropics. Temperatures are rapidly reaching the upper limit of biologically tolerable levels and an increase in reports of ice-ice and pest outbreaks is attributable to these shifts of environmental parameters. Nevertheless, few reports on the response of eucheumatoids to a changing environment, in particular global warming, are available. Understanding the responses and possible mechanisms for acclimation to warming is crucial for a sustainable seaweed cultivation industry. Here, the physiological and biochemical responses of K. alvarezii to acute warming indicated that the strain used in the current study is unlikely to survive sudden increases in temperature above 36°C. As temperature increased, the growth rates, photosynthetic performance, phycocolloid quality (carrageenan yield, gel strength and gel viscosity) and pigment content (chlorophyll-a, carotenoid and phycobiliproteins) were reduced while the production of reactive oxygen species increased indicating the occurrence of stress in the seaweeds. This study provides a basis for future work on long term acclimation to elevated temperature and mesocosm-based multivariate studies to identify heat-tolerant strains for sustainable cultivation."
https://openalex.org/W3085008143,"The objective of this study was to characterize the chemical composition and lipid profile of colostrum and milk of purebred Quarter Horse mares. Thirty-four (34) purebred mares were selected, which were then separated into groups according to age, birth order and lactation stage. Colostrum samples were collected in the first six hours after delivery and milk samples from the 7th postpartum day, with intervals of 14 days until the end of lactation. The samples were refrigerated and sent to the Milk Laboratory of the University (Laboleite—UFRN), where they were analyzed for chemical composition. Colostrum was assessed by refractometry. The lipid profile was determined by gas chromatography through a separation of methyl esters. The data were tabulated and subjected to descriptive statistics and analysis of variance by the F-Test, and the groups were compared by the Tukey test using a significance level of 5%. There was high protein content and reduced lactose content for the colostrum of the Quarter Horse mares, differing from other breeds. The milk composition was not influenced by the mares’ age. However, variations in the lactation stage and in the birth order of the Quarter Horse mares altered the milk’s chemical composition. There is variation in the lipid composition of milk according to the lactation stage, without changing the characteristic profile of the mares’ milk or diminishing the nutritional quality of the lipid fraction."
https://openalex.org/W3086023783,"Studies have linked the large percentage of maternal and neonatal mortality that occur in postnatal period to low uptake of postnatal care (PNC) services. Mobile health (mHealth) intervention through message reminders has resulted in significant increase in antenatal care utilisation in previous studies. However, its use in PNC services' uptake has not been adequately investigated in Nigeria. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of a mobile health intervention on PNC attendance among mothers in selected primary healthcare facilities in Osun State, Nigeria. A quasi-experimental research design was utilised. Participants were allocated to Intervention Group and Control Group. One hundred and ninety pregnant mothers were recruited in each group. A mobile health intervention software was developed and used to send educational and reminder messages to mothers in the intervention group from the 35th week of pregnancy to six weeks after delivery. Uptake of PNC services was assessed at birth, 3 days, 10 days and 42 days after delivery. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, chi-square and logistic regression models. About one-third (30.9%) of respondents in the intervention group had four postnatal care visits while only 3.7% in the control group had four visits (p < 0.001). After controlling for the effect of confounding variables, group membership remained a significant predictor of PNC uptake. (AOR: 10.869, 95% CI: 4.479-26.374). Mobile health intervention significantly improved utilisation of the recommended four postnatal care visits."
https://openalex.org/W3086306777,"During spaceflight, astronauts are subjected to various physical stressors including microgravity, which could cause immune dysfunction and thus potentially predispose astronauts to infections and illness. However, the mechanisms by which microgravity affects innate immunity remain largely unclear. In this study, we conducted RNA-sequencing analysis to show that simulated microgravity (SMG) suppresses the production of inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) as well as the activation of the innate immune signaling pathways including the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and the Erk1/2 MAPK pathways in the Enteropathogenic escherichia coli (EPEC)-infected macrophage cells. We then adopted hindlimb-unloading (HU) mice, a model mimicking the microgravity of a spaceflight environment, to demonstrate that microgravity suppresses proinflammatory cytokine-mediated intestinal immunity to Citrobacter rodentium infection and induces the disturbance of gut microbiota, both of which phenotypes could be largely corrected by the introduction of VSL#3, a high-concentration probiotic preparation of eight live freeze-dried bacterial species. Taken together, our study provides new insights into microgravity-mediated innate immune suppression and intestinal microbiota disturbance, and suggests that probiotic VSL#3 has great potential as a dietary supplement in protecting individuals from spaceflight mission-associated infections and gut microbiota dysbiosis."
https://openalex.org/W3084701189,"Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), mostly caused by aneurysm rupture, is a pathological condition associated with oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of key regulators of neuroinflammation, and RNF216 is an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that regulates TLRs via ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation. However, the role of RNF216 in SAH has not been determined. In this study, we investigated the biological function of RNF216 in experimental SAH models both in vitro and in vivo. The expression of RNF216 was found to be upregulated in cortical neurons after oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb) treatment, and increased RNF216 expression was also observed in brain tissues in the single-hemorrhage model of SAH. Downregulation of RNF216 expression by short interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection significantly reduced cytotoxicity and apoptosis after OxyHb exposure. The results of western blot showed that the RNF216-mediated neuronal injury in vitro was associated with the regulation of the Arc-AMPAR pathway, which was related to intracellular Ca2+ dysfunction, as evidenced by Ca2+ imaging. In addition, knockdown of RNF216 in vivo using intraventricular injection of siRNA was found to attenuate brain injury and neuroinflammation via the Arc-AMPAR pathway after SAH in the animal model. In summary, we demonstrated that silence of RNF216 expression protects against neuronal injury and neurological dysfunction in experimental SAH models. These data support for the first time that RNF216 may represent a novel candidate for therapies against SAH."
https://openalex.org/W3085705145,"Mood and behaviour are thought to be under considerable influence of the seasons, but evidence is not unequivocal. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether mood and affect are related to the seasons, and what is the role of neuroticism in this association. In a national internet-based crowdsourcing project in the Dutch general population, individuals were invited to assess themselves on several domains of mental health. ANCOVA was used to test for differences between the seasons in mean scores on the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS). Within-subject seasonal differences were tested as well, in a subgroup that completed the PANAS twice. The role of neuroticism as a potential moderator of seasonality was examined. Participants (n = 5,282) scored significantly higher on positive affect (PANAS) and lower on depressive symptoms (QIDS) in spring compared to summer, autumn and winter. They also scored significantly lower on negative affect in spring compared to autumn. Effect sizes were small or very small. Neuroticism moderated the effect of the seasons, with only participants higher on neuroticism showing seasonality. There was no within-subject seasonal effect for participants who completed the questionnaires twice (n = 503), nor was neuroticism a significant moderator of this within-subjects effect. The findings of this study in a general population sample participating in an online crowdsourcing study do not support the widespread belief that seasons influence mood to a great extent. For, as far as the seasons did influence mood, this only applied to highly neurotic participants and not to low-neurotic participants. The underlying mechanism of cognitive attribution may explain the perceived relation between seasonality and neuroticism."
https://openalex.org/W3086905981,"Clothianidin is a second-generation neonicotinoid insecticide, widely used against sap-sucking insect pest including melon aphid, Aphis gossypii Glover (Hemiptera: Aphididae). This pest causes severe economic damage to Cucurbitaceae plants worldwide. In this study, we investigated clothianidin resistance development under continuous selection pressure. Moreover, the age-stage, two-sex life table approach was used to evaluate the impact of clothianidin resistance on the fitness of A. gossypii. A clothianidin resistant strain (CT-R) with a 23.17-fold resistance level was developed from a susceptible strain (CT-S) after continuous selection for 24 generations. Life table results showed a significant reduction in the relative fitness (0.847) of CT-R strain compared to the CT-S strain of A. gossypii. The developmental duration, oviposition days, total pre-oviposition period (TPOP), longevity, and fecundity of CT-R strain were found to be significantly lower when compared to CT-S strain. The demographic parameters, including the intrinsic rate of increase (r), finite rate of increase (λ), net reproductive rate (R0), and mean generation time (T) were also significantly decreased in CT-R strain compared to the CT-S strain. Both the reproductive and survival rates were affected by clothianidin resistance in CT-R strain compared with the CT-S strain of A. gossypii. Overall, our results demonstrate that in-depth knowledge about the trade-off at play between resistance degree and fitness cost might be useful to design resistance management strategies against A. gossypii."
https://openalex.org/W3085899631,"The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of dry immersion, an innovative ground-based human model of simulated microgravity and extreme physical inactivity, on iron homeostasis and distribution. Twenty young healthy men were recruited and submitted to 5 days of dry immersion (DI). Fasting blood samples and MRI were performed before and after DI exposure to assess iron status, as well as hematological responses. DI increased spleen iron concentrations (SIC), whereas hepatic iron store (HIC) was not affected. Spleen iron sequestration could be due to the concomitant increase in serum hepcidin levels (P < .001). Increased serum unconjugated bilirubin, as well as the rise of serum myoglobin levels support that DI may promote hemolysis and myolysis. These phenomena could contribute to the concomitant increase of serum iron and transferrin saturation levels (P < .001). As HIC remained unchanged, increased serum hepcidin levels could be due both to higher transferrin saturation level, and to low-grade pro-inflammatory as suggested by the significant rise of serum ferritin and haptoglobin levels after DI (P = .003 and P = .003, respectively). These observations highlight the need for better assessment of iron metabolism in bedridden patients, and an optimization of the diet currently proposed to astronauts."
https://openalex.org/W3085073856,"Striga is an important biotic factor limiting maize production in sub-Saharan Africa and can cause yield losses as high as 100%. Marker-assisted selection (MAS) approaches hold a great potential for improving Striga resistance but requires identification and use of markers associated with Striga resistance for adequate genetic gains from selection. However, there is no report on the discovery of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to Striga in maize under artificial field infestation. In the present study, 198 BC1S1 families obtained from a cross involving TZEEI 29 (Striga resistant inbred line) and TZEEI 23 (Striga susceptible inbred line) plus the two parental lines were screened under artificial Striga-infested conditions at two Striga-endemic locations in Nigeria in 2018, to identify QTL associated with Striga resistance indicator traits, including grain yield, ears per plant, Striga damage and number of emerged Striga plants. Genetic map was constructed using 1,386 DArTseq markers distributed across the 10 maize chromosomes, covering 2076 cM of the total genome with a mean spacing of 0.11 cM between the markers. Using composite interval mapping (CIM), fourteen QTL were identified for key Striga resistance/tolerance indicator traits: 3 QTL for grain yield, 4 for ears per plant and 7 for Striga damage at 10 weeks after planting (WAP), across environments. Putative candidate genes which encode major transcription factor families WRKY, bHLH, AP2-EREBPs, MYB, and bZIP involved in plant defense signaling were detected for Striga resistance/tolerance indicator traits. The QTL detected in the present study would be useful for rapid transfer of Striga resistance/tolerance genes into Striga susceptible but high yielding maize genotypes using MAS approaches after validation. Further studies on validation of the QTL in different genetic backgrounds and in different environments would help verify their reproducibility and effective use in breeding for Striga resistance/tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W3086675747,"Objective Little is known about the role of gender expression (femininity, masculinity, or androgyny) in relation to sex differences in depression. This study tested if gender expression was associated with depression and burden of depressive symptoms in a 70-year-old population. Methods A cross-sectional population-based sample of 70-year-olds from The Gothenburg H70 Birth Cohort Study (n = 1203) was examined in 2014–16. Data were collected using psychiatric examinations and structured questionnaires, including the Positive-Negative Sex-Role Inventory to assess gender expression. Depression was diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria, and symptom burden was assessed with Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Results Gender expression was related to MADRS score and depression diagnosis. In fully adjusted models, feminine traits with low social desirability (FEM-) were associated with a higher MADRS score (R2 0.16; B 0.16; CI 0.1–0.2), while androgyny (t ratio) (R2 0.12; B 0.42; CI 0.1–0.7) and masculine traits with high social desirability (MAS+) (R2 0.13; B -0.06; CI -0.1–-0.01) were associated with a lower MADRS score. Also, feminine traits with low social desirability (FEM-) were positively associated with depression (OR 1.04; CI 1.01–1.1). No associations between depression and masculinity or androgyny were observed in adjusted models. There were no interactions between sex and gender expression in relation to depression or MADRS score, indicating that the effects of gender expression were similar in men and women. Conclusions We found that gender expression was associated to both depression and burden of depressive symptoms. More specifically, we found that femininity was associated to higher levels of depression, irrespective of biological sex. In addition, masculinity and androgyny were associated with lower levels of depression. These results highlight the importance of taking gender expression into consideration when studying sex differences in depression among older populations in future studies."
https://openalex.org/W3085923748,"Sierra Mixe maize is a geographically remote landrace variety grown on nitrogen-deficient fields in Oaxaca, Mexico that meets its nutritional requirements without synthetic fertilizer by associating with free-living diazotrophs comprising the microbiota of its aerial root mucilage. We selected nearly 500 diazotrophic (N2-fixing) bacteria isolated from Sierra Mixe maize mucilage and sequenced their genomes. Comparative genomic analysis demonstrated that isolates represented diverse genera and composed three major diazotrophic groups based on nitrogen fixation gene content. In addition to nitrogen fixation, we examined deamination of 1-amino-1-cyclopropanecarboxylic acid, biosynthesis of indole-3-acetic acid, and phosphate solubilization as alternative mechanisms of direct plant growth promotion (PGP). Genome mining showed that isolates of all diazotrophic groups possessed marker genes for multiple mechanisms of direct plant growth promotion (PGP). Implementing in vitro assays corroborated isolate genotypes by measuring each isolate’s potential to confer the targeted PGP traits and revealed phenotypic variation among isolates based on diazotrophic group assignment. Investigating the ability of mucilage diazotrophs to confer PGP by direct inoculation of clonally propagated potato plants in planta led to the identification of 16 bio-stimulant candidates. Conducting nitrogen-stress greenhouse experiments demonstrated that potato inoculation with a synthetic community of bio-stimulant candidates, as well as with its individual components, resulted in PGP phenotypes. We further demonstrated that one diazotrophic isolate conferred PGP to a conventional maize variety under nitrogen-stress in the greenhouse. These results indicate that, while many diazotrophic isolates from Sierra Mixe maize possessed genotypes and in vitro phenotypes for targeted PGP traits, a subset of these organisms promoted the growth of potato and conventional maize, potentially through the use of multiple promotion mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3086579872,"Purpose To estimate the nationwide prevalence of visual impairment and associated refractive error in school children in Bhutan. Methods The sample of this prospective cross-sectional national survey comprised of randomly selected classes in levels IV-IX (age 10 to 15 years) from schools throughout Bhutan. The examination included measurement of visual acuity (VA), evaluation of ocular motility, refraction under cycloplegia, examination of the external eye, media and fundus. The principal cause of impairment was determined for eyes with uncorrected VA ≤6/12. The main outcome measures were distance VA and cycloplegic refractive error. Results With a sampling frame of 1967 class-based clusters from 190 schools, 160 classes in 103 schools were randomly selected; 4985 (98.5%) of 5060 enumerated children were examined. The prevalence of uncorrected, presenting, and best-corrected visual impairment (VA≤6/12) in the better eye was 14.5%, 12.8%, and 0.34%, respectively. Refractive error was the principal cause (94.2%) of impaired vision and 88% of children who could achieve VA ≥6/9 with best correction were without necessary spectacles. The prevalence of myopia (≤ -0.5 D) was 6.64% and was associated with female gender (P = 0.004), urban schooling (P = 0.002), and greater parental education (P<0.001). The prevalence of hyperopia (≥ +2.0 D) was 2.17% and was significantly associated with lower class-level (P = 0.033), and female gender (P = 0.025). The overall prevalence of astigmatism (≥ 0.75 D) was 9.75%. Conclusions Reduced vision because of uncorrected refractive error is a public health problem among school-age children in Bhutan. Effective school eye health strategies are needed to eliminate this easily treatable cause of visual impairment."

First, based on project investigation and a literature review, a fire risk assessment index system suitable for high-rise buildings under construction was established. Second, the unascertained measure theory was applied to establish a fire risk assessment model for high-rise buildings under construction. The index weight was determined by the entropy weight method. Finally, taking a high-rise building project in Xi’an, China, as an example, the feasibility and rationality of the fire risk assessment index system and assessment model were verified. This research provides a new method for objectively assessing the fire risk of high-rise buildings under construction and provides a certain reference for controlling the fire risk of high-rise buildings under construction."
https://openalex.org/W3085119287,"In utero environment is crucial to ensure normal development of the fetus and to program metabolic health throughout the life. Beside macronutrients, the role of micronutrients, including vitamin D, begins to be explore. The aim of this study was to decipher the impact of maternal vitamin D deficiency (VDD), in normal and high-fat (HF) diet context, on adipose tissue metabolism and energy homeostasis in offspring, considering sex-specific responses. Body weight, energy expenditure, and spontaneous activity was differential impacted in juvenile male and female offspring born from VDD mice. In adulthood, a HF diet combined with maternal VDD disrupted glucose homeostasis and adiposity in male offspring but not in females. Such phenotypes were associated to different transcriptomic profiles in adipose tissue, which could be related to differential modulation of plasma 17β-estradiol concentrations. Thus, maternal VDD sex-dependently modulated metabolic fate of the offspring, especially when associated with HF diet in adulthood."
https://openalex.org/W3085325671,"Malnutrition is a major cause of child death, and many children suffer from acute and chronic malnutrition. Nigeria has the second-highest burden of stunting globally and a higher-than-average child wasting prevalence. Moreover, there is substantial spatial variation in the prevalence of stunting and wasting in Nigeria. This paper assessed the socioeconomic inequalities and determinants of the change in socioeconomic inequalities in child stunting and wasting in Nigeria between 2013 and 2018.Data came from the 2013 and 2018 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey. Socioeconomic inequalities in stunting and wasting were measured using the concentration curve and Erreygers' corrected concentration index. A pro-poor concentration index is negative, meaning that the poor bear a disproportionately higher burden of stunting or wasting than the wealthy. A positive or pro-rich index is the opposite. Standard methodologies were applied to decompose the concentration index (C) while the Oaxaca-Blinder approach was used to decompose changes in the concentration indices (ΔC).The socioeconomic inequalities in child stunting and wasting were pro-poor in 2013 and 2018. The concentration indices for stunting reduced from -0.298 (2013) to -0.330 (2018) (ΔC = -0.032). However, the concentration indices for wasting increased from -0.066 to -0.048 (ΔC = 0.018). The changes in the socioeconomic inequalities in stunting and wasting varied by geopolitical zones. Significant determinants of these changes for both stunting and wasting were changes in inequalities in wealth, maternal education and religion. Under-five dependency, access to improved toilet facilities and geopolitical zone significantly explained changes in only stunting inequality, while access to improved water facilities only significantly determined the change in inequality in wasting.Addressing the socio-economic, spatial and demographic determinants of the changes in the socioeconomic inequalities in child stunting and wasting, especially wealth, maternal education and access to sanitation is critical for improving child stunting and wasting in Nigeria."
https://openalex.org/W3086009634,"Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease characterized by the accumulation of macrophages in the vessel wall. Macrophages depend on their polarization to exert either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory effects. Macrophages of the anti-inflammatory phenotype express high levels of CD163, a scavenger receptor for the hemoglobin-haptoglobin complex. CD163 can also bind to the pro-inflammatory cytokine TWEAK. Using ApoE-deficient or ApoE/CD163 double-deficient mice we aim to investigate the involvement of CD163 in atherosclerosis development and its capacity to neutralize the TWEAK actions. ApoE/CD163 double-deficient mice displayed a more unstable plaque phenotype characterized by an increased lipid and macrophage content, plaque size, and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the absence of CD163 in M2-type macrophages-induced foam cell formation through upregulation of CD36 expression. Moreover, exogenous TWEAK administration increased atherosclerotic lesion size, lipids, and macrophages content in ApoE−/−/CD163−/− compared with ApoE−/−/CD163+/+ mice. Treatment with recombinant CD163 was able to neutralize the proatherogenic effects of TWEAK in ApoE/CD163 double-deficient mice. Recombinant CD163 abolished the pro-inflammatory actions of TWEAK on vascular smooth muscle cells, decreasing NF-kB activation, cytokines and metalloproteinases expression, and macrophages migration. In conclusion, CD163-expressing macrophages serve as a protective mechanism to prevent the deleterious effects of TWEAK on atherosclerotic plaque development and progression."
https://openalex.org/W3086433189,"Inoculating plants with entomopathogenic fungi may influence plant nutrient uptake and growth, and herbivore performance. Knowledge is limited concerning the effects of this symbiosis on higher trophic levels. We examined how fungal treatment of faba bean seeds with the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana influenced the choice-behavior and development of the aphid parasitoid Aphidius colemani. We also sampled plant material for analysis of changes in expression of genes related to plant defense pathways. While parasitoids were compatible with plants inoculated with B. bassiana initially (66 vs. 65% parasitization on inoculated and control plants, respectively; similar development times of parasitoids: 9.2 days), the emergence of adult parasitoids originating from aphids on fungus treated plants was significantly lower (67 vs. 76%, respectively). We also found that the defense response changed, similar to induced systemic resistance, when plants were treated with B. bassiana, similarly to what has been found for other plant symbiotic microorganisms. These novel findings show that although the application of entomopathogenic fungi to plants can alter the plants’ defense against herbivores, it may also have an impact on beneficial insects, so their function and use should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis."
https://openalex.org/W3084496412,"Sprouting angiogenesis is a highly coordinately process controlled by vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-Notch signaling. Here we investigated whether Tripartite motif-containing 28 (TRIM28), which is an epigenetic modifier implicated in gene transcription and cell differentiation, is essential to mediate sprouting angiogenesis. We observed that knockdown of TRIM28 ortholog in zebrafish resulted in developmental vascular defect with disorganized and reduced vasculatures. Consistently, TRIM28 knockdown inhibited angiogenic sprouting of cultured endothelial cells (ECs), which exhibited increased mRNA levels of VEGFR1, Delta-like (DLL) 3, and Notch2 but reduced levels of VEGFR2, DLL1, DLL4, Notch1, Notch3, and Notch4.The regulative effects of TRIM28 on these angiogenic factors were partially mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 α (HIF-1α) and recombination signal-binding protein for immunoglobulin kappa J region (RBPJκ). In vitro DNA-binding assay showed that TRIM28 knockdown increased the association of RBPJκ with DNA sequences containing HIF-1α-binding sites. Moreover, the phosphorylation of TRIM28 was controlled by VEGF and Notch1 through a mechanism involving RBPJκ-dual-specificity phosphatase (DUSP)-p38 MAPK, indicating a negative feedback mechanism. These findings established TRIM28 as a crucial regulator of VEGFR-Notch signaling circuit through HIF-1α and RBPJκ in EC sprouting angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3086741132,"Bushmeat harvesting and consumption represents a potential risk for the spillover of endemic zoonotic pathogens, yet remains a common practice in many parts of the world. Given that the harvesting and selling of bushmeat is illegal in Tanzania and other parts of Africa, the supply chain is informal and may include hunters, whole-sellers, retailers, and individual resellers who typically sell bushmeat in small pieces. These pieces are often further processed, obscuring species-identifying morphological characteristics, contributing to incomplete or mistaken knowledge of species of origin and potentially confounding assessments of pathogen spillover risk and bushmeat offtake. The current investigation sought to identify the species of origin and assess the concordance between seller-reported and laboratory-confirmed species of origin of bushmeat harvested from in and around the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania. After obtaining necessary permits, the species of origin of a total of 151 bushmeat samples purchased from known intermediaries from 2016 to 2018 were characterized by PCR and sequence analysis of the cytochrome B (CytB) gene. Based on these sequence analyses, 30%, 95% Confidence Interval (CI: 24.4–38.6) of bushmeat samples were misidentified by sellers. Misreporting amongst the top five source species (wildebeest, buffalo, impala, zebra, and giraffe) ranged from 20% (CI: 11.4–33.2) for samples reported as wildebeest to 47% (CI: 22.2–72.7) for samples reported as zebra although there was no systematic bias in reporting. Our findings suggest that while misreporting errors are unlikely to confound wildlife offtake estimates for bushmeat consumption within the Serengeti ecosystem, the role of misreporting bias on the risk of spillover events of endemic zoonotic infections from bushmeat requires further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3085694443,"CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) sites interact with each other in the chromatin environment, establishing chromatin domains. Our previous study showed that interaction between CTCF sites is cell type-specific around the β-globin locus and is dependent on erythroid-specific activator GATA-1. To find out molecular mechanisms of the cell type-specific interaction, we directly inhibited GATA-1 binding to the β-globin enhancers by deleting its binding motifs and found that histone H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) was decreased at CTCF sites surrounding the β-globin locus, even though CTCF binding itself was maintained at the sites. Forced H3K27ac by Trichostatin A treatment or CBP/p300 KD affected the interactions between CTCF sites around the β-globin locus without changes in CTCF binding. Analysis of public ChIA-PET data revealed that H3K27ac is higher at CTCF sites forming short interactions than long interactions. GATA-1 was identified as a representative transcription factor that relates with genes present inside the short interactions in erythroid K562 cells. Depletion of GATA-1-reduced H3K27ac at CTCF sites near erythroid-specific enhancers. These results indicate that H3K27ac at CTCF sites is required for cell type-specific chromatin interactions between them. Tissue-specific activator GATA-1 appears to play a role in H3K27ac at CTCF sites in erythroid cells."
https://openalex.org/W3086280129,"Background Preterm birth is a public health problem particularly in low- and middle-income countries especially in sub-Saharan Africa. It is associated with infant morbidity and mortality. Survivor of preterm suffers long term health consequences such as respiratory, hearing and visual problems as well as delivering preterm infants. Preterm birth also tends to recur in subsequent pregnancies. Little is known about recurrent rate of preterm birth and associated factors in Tanzania. This study aimed to determine the recurrence rate of preterm birth and associated factors among women who delivered at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC), in Northern Tanzania. Methods A historic cohort study was designed using maternally-linked data from KCMC medical birth registry. Women who delivered 2 or more singletons were included. A total of 5,946 deliveries were analysed. Recurrence of preterm birth and associated risk factors were estimated using multivariable log-binomial regression model with robust standard error to account for repeated births from the same mother. Results Overall recurrent rate of preterm birth was 24.4%. The recurrence of early preterm birth was higher compared to late preterm birth (26.2% vs. 24.2%). Similar pattern of recurrence was observed for spontaneous and medically indicated preterm birth (13.5% vs. 10.9%, respectively). Previous preterm birth (RR;1.85, 95% CI: 1.49, 2.31), preeclampsia (RR;1.46, 95% CI: 1.07, 2.00), long inter-pregnancy interval (RR;1.22, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.49) and clinical subtypes (RR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.86) were important predictors for recurrent preterm birth. Conclusion Recurrence of preterm birth remains higher in this population. The rate of preterm recurrence was dependent of gestational age and sub-clinical subtype. Other factors which were associated with recurrence of preterm birth were previous preterm birth, preeclampsia and long inter-pregnancy interval. Early identification of high risk women during prenatal period is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3086603795,"Purpose Biathlon is an Olympic sport combining 3–5 laps of cross-country skiing with rifle shooting, alternating between the prone and standing shooting positions between laps. The individual distance and the sprint are extensively examined whereas the pursuit, with start times based on the sprint results, is unexplored. Therefore, the current study aimed to investigate the contribution from start time, cross-country skiing time, penalty time, shooting time and range time to the overall and isolated performance in biathlon World Cup pursuit races. Methods 38 and 37 stepwise linear regression analyses for each of the races were performed, including 112 and 128 unique athletes where 20 and 13 athletes had more than 20 results within top 30 during the seasons 2011/2012-2015/2016 in men and women, respectively. Results Start time (i.e. sprint race performance) together with penalty time, explained ~80% of the performance-variance (R2) in overall pursuit performance in most races (p<0.01). For isolated pursuit performance, penalty time was the most important component, explaining >54% of the performance-variance in the majority of races, followed by course time (accumulated R2 = .91-.92) and shooting time (accumulated R2 = .98-.99) (p<0.01). Approximately the same rankings of factors were found when comparing standardized coefficients and correlation coefficients of the independent variables included in the regression. Conclusion Start time (i.e. sprint race performance) is the most important component for overall pursuit performance in biathlon, whereas shooting performance followed by course time are the most important components for the isolated pursuit race performance."
https://openalex.org/W3086231166,"Purpose To investigate the influence of EDOF IOLs, TECNIS Symfony® (Johnson & Johnson Surgical Vision, Inc.), on visual field sensitivity and to compare the IOLs with other kinds of IOLs. Methods The subjects included the normal fellow eyes of patients who underwent the Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) 30–2 with Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm Fast within 6 months after cataract due to glaucoma or suspected glaucoma. Each parameter of HFA was compared among eyes implanted with TENIS Symfony® (EDOF group), diffractive bifocal IOLs (bifocal group), and monofocal IOLs (monofocal group). Results The total of 76 eyes, including 24 eyes in the EDOF group, 26 eyes in the bifocal group, and 26 eyes in the monofocal group, were included in this study. Mean deviation (MD) of HFA was -0.24±0.58 dB in the EDOF group, -1.38±0.58 dB in the bifocal group, and 0.02±0.44 dB in the monofocal group. Foveal threshold (FT) of HFA was 35.8±1.6 dB in the EDOF group, 33.6±1.7 dB in the bifocal group, and 36.6±1.4 dB in the monofocal group. In both MD and FT, there was significant difference between the bifocal group and the others (p<0.001). There was no difference between the EDOF group and the monofocal group. Moreover, there was no significant difference between the three groups about pattern standard deviation (PSD) of HFA. Conclusion TECNIS Symfony® may have little influence on visual field sensitivity, whereas diffractive bifocal IOLs decrease visual field sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W3085051635,"The type I polyketide SF2487/A80577 (herein referred to as tetromadurin) is a polyether tetronate ionophore antibiotic produced by the terrestrial Gram-positive bacterium Actinomadura verrucosospora. Tetromadurin is closely related to the polyether tetronates tetronasin (M139603) and tetronomycin, all of which are characterised by containing a tetronate, cyclohexane, tetrahydropyran, and at least one tetrahydrofuran ring. We have sequenced the genome of Actinomadura verrucosospora to identify the biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for tetromadurin biosynthesis (the mad gene cluster). Based on bioinformatic analysis of the 32 genes present within the cluster a plausible biosynthetic pathway for tetromadurin biosynthesis is proposed. Functional confirmation of the mad gene cluster is obtained by performing in-frame deletions in each of the genes mad10 and mad31, which encode putative cyclase enzymes responsible for cyclohexane and tetrahydropyran formation, respectively. Furthermore, the A. verrucosospora Δmad10 mutant produces a novel tetromadurin metabolite that according to mass spectrometry analysis is analogous to the recently characterised partially cyclised tetronasin intermediate lacking its cyclohexane and tetrahydropyran rings. Our results therefore elucidate the biosynthetic machinery of tetromadurin biosynthesis and lend support for a conserved mechanism of cyclohexane and tetrahydropyran biosynthesis across polyether tetronates."
https://openalex.org/W3086050628,"Ruminative thought is a style of thinking which involves repetitively focusing upon one’s own negative mood, its causes and its consequences. The negative effects of rumination are well-documented, but comparatively little is known about how rumination is experienced. The evaluative nature of rumination suggests that it could involve more inner speech than non-ruminative states. The present study (N = 31) combined facial electromyography and self-report questionnaires to determine the type of inner experience that occurs in rumination. The results showed that induced rumination involved similar levels of muscle activity related to inner speech as periods of induced distraction. However, experience sampling and questionnaire responses showed that rumination involved more verbal thought, and also involved more evaluative and dialogic inner speech than distraction. These findings contribute to the understanding of inner speech as a flexible phenomenon and confirms the importance of employing multiple methods to investigate inner speech. Future research should clarify the link between inner speech in rumination and its negative effects on wellbeing."
https://openalex.org/W3086361975,"Divergence in ecological niche offers organisms the opportunity of exploiting different food and habitat resources, scaling down competition and predation both among species, and within different age or size-classes of the same species. In harsh environments, where abiotic factors determine a clustering of resources during short timespans, competition and predation between organisms is likely to be enhanced. This is the case in tropical dry forests, where amphibians have limited opportunities to feed, their activity being restricted to the short rainy season. One way to maximize resource exploitation while avoiding predation risk is by adopting different diel activity patterns. We tested this hypothesis by comparing activity patterns in adults and recently metamorphosed juveniles of Pacific horned frogs (Ceratophrys stolzmanni) during field surveys and in an experimental study. Field surveys showed that the adults are strictly nocturnal, whereas freshly metamorphosed juveniles can be found active above ground at all hours, with a peak activity during daytime. The average body condition index of juveniles found active during the night was higher than that of juveniles found active during the day, suggesting that the weaker individuals may be constrained to being active during the day. On the other hand, in a laboratory experiment, juveniles that were visually exposed to adults moved less than those in the absence of adults. Both field and experimental observations indicate a temporal niche divergence between life stages. The results of the experiment offer support to the hypothesis that the juveniles in this species display an inverse activity pattern compared to adults, which can reduce competitive interactions and predation pressure from the larger conspecifics."
https://openalex.org/W3084698854,"Prediction model mainly focused on specific diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or patients with cancer, or populations of Europe and America, thereby limiting its generalization. This study aimed to develop and validate a 10-year mortality risk score by using data from a population-representative sample of adults. Data were collected from 2,221 Taichung Community Health study participants aged ≥40 years. The baseline period of the study was 2004, and all participants were followed up until death or in 2016. Cox’s proportional hazards regression analyses were used to develop the prediction model. A total of 262 deaths were ascertained during the 10-year follow-up. The all-cause mortality prediction model calculated the significant risk factors, namely, age, sex, marital status, physical activity, tobacco use, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and albumin-to-creatinine ratio, among the baseline risk factors. The expanded cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality prediction model consisted of six variables: age, sex, body mass index, heart disease plus heart disease medication use, stroke plus medication use, and ankle–brachial index. The areas under receiver operating curves of the 3-, 5- and 10-year predictive models varied between 0.97, 0.96, and 0.88 for all-cause mortality, and between 0.97, 0.98, and 0.84 for expanded CVD mortality. These mortality prediction models are valid and can be used as tools to identify the increased risk for mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3084712316,"Pre-biopsy multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has transformed the risk stratification and diagnostic approach for suspected prostate cancer. The majority of clinically significant prostate cancers are visible on pre-biopsy mpMRI, however, there are a subset of significant tumors that are not detected by mpMRI. The radiobiological mechanisms underpinning mpMRI-visibility and invisibility of these cancers remain uncertain. Emerging evidence suggests that mpMRI-visible tumors are enriched with molecular features associated with increased disease aggressivity and poor clinical prognosis, which is supported by short-term endpoints, such as biochemical recurrence following surgery. Furthermore, at the histopathological level, mpMRI-visible tumors appear to exhibit increased architectural and vascular density compared to mpMRI-invisible disease. It seems probable that the genomic, pathological, radiological, and clinical features of mpMRI-visible and mpMRI-invisible prostate cancers are interrelated. Here, we propose a novel cross-disciplinary theory that links genomic and molecular evidence with cellular and histopathological appearances, elucidating both the mpMRI visibility and clinical status of significant prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W3084720025,"Myxobacteria are one of the most promising secondary metabolites producers. However, they are difficult to isolate and cultivate. To obtain more myxobacteria and know the effects of environmental factors on myxobacterial community, we characterized myxobacterial communities in Dinghushan acidic forest soils of pH 3.6–4.5 with culture-dependent and -independent techniques, and analyzed environmental factors shaping myxobacterial communities. A total of 21 myxobacteria were isolated using standard cultivation methods, including eleven isolates of Corallococcus, nine isolates of Myxococcus and one isolate of Archangium, and contained three potential novel species. In addition, a total of 67 unknown myxobacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained using high-throughput sequencing method. The abundance of Myxococcales account for 0.9–2.2% of bacterial communities, and Sorangium is the most abundant genus (60.1%) in Myxococcales. Correlation analysis demonstrated that bacterial diversity and soil pH are the key factors shaping myxobacterial community. These results revealed an abundant myxobacterial community which is shaped by other bacteria and pH in Dinghushan acidic forest soils."
https://openalex.org/W3084726973,"Clinical fungal infections always cause a negative impact on human health. Moreover, during the interaction of pathogenic fungi with the environment and host, many biologically active substances are produced. Here, we report a new toxin-like defensin of purlisin derived from a clinical pathogenic isolate of Purpureocillium lilacinum. The analysis of its genomic and mRNA sequences revealed an open reading frame of 444 bp without introns. The deduced precursor peptide was composed of 147 amino acids, and the mature peptide were identified at protein level by LC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS. After posttranslational processing, the precursor peptide of purlisin was split into two independent peptides. The two mature defensins, purlisin-NT and purlisin-CT, are consisting of 36 and 38 amino acid residues, which can form three and four intramolecular disulfide bonds, respectively. The results of circular dichroism and homology modeling revealed that they adopted a representative cysteine-stabilized α-helical and β-sheet motif. The purlisin-NT showed a dose-dependent selective inhibition of immune-related hKv1.3 target channel with IC50 value of 0.2 ± 0.04 μM but no obvious antibacterial activity, while the purlisin-CT displayed antimicrobial activities against gram-positive bacteria as well as clinical isolates of MRSA and low affinities for potassium channels. Our findings suggest that purlisin-NT with immunosuppressive effects and purlisin-CT possessing antibacterial activities are adapted to the survival and pathogenicity of clinical P lilacinumis. Moreover, they can also be used as templates for the design of novel antibacterial peptide and immunosuppressive agents."
https://openalex.org/W3085390464,"Clinacanthus nutans (CN) (Acanthaceae) is well-known for its anti-inflammatory properties among Asian communities; however, there are currently no data specifically focused on the anti-inflammatory effects of CN on the brain tissue. Neuroinflammation is a common consequence of toxin intrusion to any part of the central nervous system (CNS). As an innate immune response, the CNS may react through both protective and/or toxic actions due to the activation of neuron cells producing pro- and/or anti-inflammatory cytokines in the brain. The unresolved activation of the inflammatory cytokines’ response is associated with the pathogenesis of neurological disorders. The present study aimed to decipher the metabolic mechanism on the effects of 14 days oral treatment with CN aqueous extract in induced-lipopolysaccharides (LPS) rats through 1H NMR spectroscopic biomarker profiling of the brain tissue and the related cytokines. Based on the principal component analysis (PCA) of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectral data, twenty-one metabolites in the brain tissue were profiled as biomarkers for the LPS (10 μL)-induced neuroinflammation following intracerebroventricular injection. Among the twenty-one biomarkers in the neuroinflammed rats, CN treatment of 1000 and 500 mg/kg BW successfully altered lactate, pyruvate, phosphorylcholine, glutamine, and α-ketoglutarate when compared to the negative control. Likewise, statistical isolinear multiple component analysis (SIMCA) showed that treatments by CN and the positive control drug, dextromethorphan (DXM, 5 mg/kg BW), have anti-neuroinflammatory potential. A moderate correlation, in the orthogonal partial least squares (OPLS) regression model, was found between the spectral metabolite profile and the cytokine levels. The current study revealed the existence of high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, namely IL-1α, IL-1β, and TNF-α in LPS-induced rats. Both CN dose treatments lowered IL-1β significantly better than DXM Interestingly, DXM and CN treatments both exhibited the upregulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-2 and 4. However, DXM has an advantage over CN in that the former also increased the expression of IL-10 of anti-inflammatory cytokines. In this study, a metabolomics approach was successfully applied to discover the mechanistic role of CN in controlling the neuroinflammatory conditions through the modulation of complex metabolite interactions in the rat brain."
https://openalex.org/W3086057173,"Chronic and high dose opioid use may result in adverse events. We analyzed the risk associated with chronic and high dose opioid prescription in a Swiss population.Using insurance claims data covering one-sixth of the Swiss population, we analyzed recurrent opioid prescriptions (≥2 opioid claims with at least 1 strong opioid claim) between 2006 and 2014. We calculated the cumulative dose in milligrams morphine equivalents (MED) and treatment duration. Excluded were single opioid claims, opioid use that was cancer treatment related, and opioid use in substitution programs. We assessed the association between the duration of opioid use, prescribed opioid dose, and benzodiazepine use with emergency department (ED) visits, urogenital and pulmonary infections, acute care hospitalization, and death at the end of the episode.In 63,642 recurrent opioid prescription episodes (acute 38%, subacute 7%, chronic 25.8%, very chronic (>360 days) episodes 29%) 18,336 ED visits, 30,209 infections, 19,375 hospitalizations, and 9,662 deaths occurred. The maximum daily MED dose was <20 mg in 15.8%, 20-<50 mg in 16.6%, 50-<100 mg in 21.6%, and ≥100 mg in 46%. Compared to acute episodes (<90 days), episode duration was an independent predictor of ED visits (chronic OR 1.09 (95% CI 1.03-1.15), very chronic (>360 days) OR 1.76 (1.67-1.86)) for adverse effects; infections (chronic OR 1.74 (1.66-1.82), very chronic 4.16 (3.95-4.37)), and hospitalization (chronic: OR 1.22 (1.16-1.29), very chronic OR 1.82 (1.73-1.93)). The risk of death decreased over time (very chronic OR 0.46 (0.43-0.50)). A dose dependent increased risk was observed for ED visits, hospitalization, and death (≥100mg daily MED OR 1.21 (1.13-1.29), OR 1.29 (1.21-1.38), and OR 1.67, 1.50-1.85, respectively). A concomitant use of benzodiazepines increased the odds for ED visits by 46% (OR 1.46, 1.41-1.52), infections by 44% (OR 1.44, 1.41-1.52), hospitalization by 12% (OR 1.12, 1.07-1.1), and death by 45% (OR 1.45, 1.37-1.53).The length of opioid use and higher prescribed morphine equivalent dose were independently associated with an increased risk for ED visits and hospitalizations. The risk for infections, ED visits, hospitalizations, and death also increased with concomitant benzodiazepine use."

In some cases, this procedure is unsuccessful and patients need to revisit the hospital where they undergo surgery to treat the fracture. This work describes a geometric semi-automatic image analysis algorithm to analyse and compare the x-rays of healthy controls and patients with dorsally displaced wrist fractures (Colles' fractures) who were treated with Manipulation under Anaesthesia. A series of 161 posterior-anterior radiographs from healthy controls and patients with Colles' fractures were acquired and analysed. The patients' group was further subdivided according to the outcome of the procedure (successful/unsuccessful) and pre- or post-intervention creating five groups in total (healthy, pre-successful, pre-unsuccessful, post-successful, post-unsuccessful). The semi-automatic analysis consisted of manual location of three landmarks (finger, lunate and radial styloid) and automatic processing to generate 32 geometric and texture measurements, which may be related to conditions such as osteoporosis and swelling of the wrist. Statistical differences were found between patients and controls, as well as between pre- and post-intervention, but not between the procedures. The most distinct measurements were those of texture. Although the study includes a relatively low number of cases and measurements, the statistical differences are encouraging."
https://openalex.org/W3086768655,"Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC) is a debilitating condition of chronic pelvic pain with unknown etiology. Recently, we used a genetic approach in a murine model of IC to identify the lipase acyloxyacyl hydrolase (AOAH) as a modulator of pelvic pain. We found that AOAH-deficient mice have elevated pelvic pain responses, and AOAH immunoreactivity was detected along the bladder-brain axis. Lipidomic analyses identified arachidonic acid (AA) and its metabolite PGE2 as significantly elevated in the sacral spinal cord of AOAH-deficient mice, suggesting AA is a substrate for AOAH. Here, we quantified the effects of AOAH on phospholipids containing AA. Spinal cord lipidomics revealed increased AA-containing phosphatidylcholine in AOAH-deficient mice and concomitantly decreased AA-phosphatidylethanolamine, consistent with decreased CoA-independent transferase activity (CoIT). Overexpression of AOAH in cell cultures similarly altered distribution of AA in phospholipid pools, promoted AA incorporation, and resulted in decreased membrane fluidity. Finally, administration of a PGE2 receptor antagonist reduced pelvic pain in AOAH-deficient mice. Together, these findings suggest that AOAH represents a potential CoA-independent AA transferase that modulates CNS pain pathways at the level of phospholipid metabolism."

We modeled exposure of human esophageal myofibroblasts (HEMFs) to gastroesophageal reflux by repeated treatment with pH 4.5 and pH 4.5 bile salts and determined the effects on the epithelium in a 3D organotypic-like air-liquid interface model. Total, basal and supra-basal thickness of the epithelium were measured and immunostaining for p63, for basal (CK 14) and supra-basal (CK 4) squamous differentiation markers, and for cell proliferation (PCNA) were performed. Epithelial cell proliferation in response to HEMF conditioned media was also assessed in 2D culture. In the 3D organotypic model, total epithelial thickness increased similarly with pH 4.5 and pH 4.5 bile salt treated versus untreated and bile salt treated HEMF conditioned media. Epithelial p63 immunostaining was increased and multilayered. There was expansion of the CK14+ basal and CK4+ supra-basal layers in the epithelium established with conditioned media from pH 4.5 and pH 4.5 bile salt treated HEMFs versus untreated HEMF conditioned media. PCNA + cells per μm of tissue were unchanged in the basal layer across all treatment conditions while PCNA + cells per total DAPI + cells were decreased. In 2D culture, basal epithelial proliferation decreased with conditioned media from pH 4.5 and pH 4.5 bile salt treated HEMFs compared to conditioned media from untreated HEMF conditioned media. Secreted factors from HEMFs treated with acidic stimuli encountered in GERD increase epithelial thickness compared to secreted factors from untreated HEMFs and expand both basal and supra-basal layers. Our findings demonstrate for the first time paracrine regulation of the squamous epithelium from acid stimulated HEMFs. The effects of secreted factors from acid treated HEMFs on basal cell proliferation in this model and the mechanism mediating the increase in epithelial thickness merit further investigation."

https://openalex.org/W3086090435,"The continuous and sole dependence on imidazolinone (IMI) herbicides for weedy rice control has led to the evolution of herbicide resistance in weedy rice populations across various countries growing IMI herbicide-resistant rice (IMI-rice), including Malaysia. A comprehensive study was conducted to elucidate occurrence, level, and mechanisms endowing resistance to IMI herbicides in putative resistant (R) weedy rice populations collected from three local Malaysian IMI-rice fields. Seed bioassay and whole-plant dose-response experiments were conducted using commercial IMI herbicides. Based on the resistance index (RI) quantification in both experiments, the cross-resistance pattern of R and susceptible (S) weedy rice populations and control rice varieties (IMI-rice variety MR220CL2 and non-IMI-rice variety MR219) to imazapic and imazapyr was determined. A molecular investigation was carried out by comparing the acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) gene sequences of the R and S populations and the MR220CL2 and MR219 varieties. The AHAS gene sequences of R weedy rice were identical to those of MR220CL2, exhibiting a Ser-653-Asn substitution, which was absent in MR219 and S plants. In vitro assays were conducted using analytical grade IMI herbicides of imazapic (99.3%) and imazapyr (99.6%) at seven different concentrations. The results demonstrated that the AHAS enzyme extracted from the R populations and MR220CL2 was less sensitive to IMI herbicides than that from S and MR219, further supporting that IMI herbicide resistance was conferred by target-site mutation. In conclusion, IMI resistance in the selected populations of Malaysian weedy rice could be attributed to a Ser-653-Asn mutation that reduced the sensitivity of the target site to IMI herbicides. To our knowledge, this study is the first to show the resistance mechanism in weedy rice from Malaysian rice fields."
https://openalex.org/W3086155064,"Background Approximately one in every five adolescent girls in Kenya has either had a live birth or is pregnant with her first child. There is an urgent need to understand the language and symbols used to represent adolescent pregnancy, if the current trend in adolescent pregnancy is to be reversed. Agreement on the definition of a societal problem is an important precursor to a social issue’s political prioritization and priority setting. Methods We apply the Public Arenas Model to appraise the environments, definitions, competition dynamics, principles of selection and current actors involved in problem-solving and prioritizing adolescent pregnancy as a policy issue. Using a focused ethnographic approach, we undertook semi-structured interviews with 14 members of adolescent sexual reproductive health networks at the national level and conducted thematic analysis of the interviews. Findings We found that existing definitions center around adolescent pregnancy as a “disease” that needs prevention and treatment, socially deviant behaviour that requires individual agency, and a national social concern that drains public resources and therefore needs to be regulated. These competing definitions contribute to the rarity of the topic achieving traction within the political agenda and contribute to conflicting solutions, such as lowering the legal age of consenting to sex, while limiting access to contraceptive information and services to minors. Conclusion This paper provides a timely theoretical approach to draw attention to the different competing definitions and subsequent divergent interpretations of the problem of adolescent pregnancy in Kenya. Adolescent reproductive health stakeholders need to be familiar with the existing definitions and deliberately reframe this important social problem for better political prioritization and resource allocation. We recommend a definition of adolescent pregnancy that cuts across different arenas, and leverages already existing dominant and concurrent social and economic issues that are already on the agenda table."
https://openalex.org/W3086211153,"Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an emerging tool for diagnosis and treatment monitoring of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). The current study aims to identify central pulmonary arterial hemodynamic parameters that reflect clinical, cardiac and pulmonary changes after PEA. 31 CTEPH patients, who underwent PEA and received pre- and postoperative MRI, were analyzed retrospectively. Central pulmonary arterial blood flow, lung perfusion and right heart function data were derived from MRI. Mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) and 5-month follow-up six-minute walk-distance (6MWD) were assessed. After PEA, mPAP decreased significantly and patients achieved a higher 6MWD. Central pulmonary arterial blood flow velocities, pulmonary blood flow (PBF) and right ventricular function increased significantly. Two-dimensional (2D) phase-contrast (PC) MRI-derived average mean velocity, maximum mean velocity and deceleration volume changes after PEA correlated with changes of 6MWD and right heart ejection fraction (RVEF). Deceleration volume is a novel 2D PC MRI parameter showing further correlation with PBF changes. In conclusion, 2D PC MRI-derived main pulmonary hemodynamic changes reflect changes of RVEF, PBF and 5-month follow-up 6MWD and may be used for future CTEPH patient monitoring after PEA."

Furthermore, it was found that despite the perceived adequacy among women in accessing fruits and vegetables, carbohydrates and micro-nutrient supplements, their children under five years, still experiences public health challenges and suffers from wasting, underweight and stunting.There is need to implement extensive pro-rural under five nutritional and health educational advocacy using community-based approaches, targeting parents, emphasizing the significance of exclusive breast feeding and consistencies in giving dietary foods, if and only if the persistent public health challenges due to under nutrition among children under five years, is to be sustainably dealt with, in Malawi."
https://openalex.org/W3086835050,"Lactococcus lactis is a lactic acid bacterium widely used as a starter culture in the manufacture of dairy products, especially a wide variety of cheeses. Improved industrial strains would help to manufacture better food products that can meet the industry’s and consumer’s demands with respect to e.g. quality, taste, texture and shelf life. Bacteriophage infection of L. lactis starter cultures represents one of the main causes of fermentation failure and consequent economic losses for the dairy industry. In this study, however, we aim at employing bacteriophages for beneficial purposes. We developed an experimental setup to assess whether phage-mediated horizontal gene transfer could be used to enhance the genetic characteristics of L. lactis strains in accordance with the European law regarding the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in the food industry. Although we could not show the transfer of chromosomal DNA we did successfully transduce two dissimilar plasmids from L. lactis strain MG1363 to one of its derivatives employing three different lactococcal bacteriophages."
https://openalex.org/W3085123569,"Enclosed underground excavation worksite has an environment with poor ventilation and exposure to hazardous substances from diesel engine exhaust and construction materials. The objective of this study was to evaluate the exposure level of elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC), total carbon (TC), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), dust and crystalline silica (CS) during underground excavation work for top down construction buildings. Active local air sampling for EC, OC, and TC (n = 105), PAHs (n = 50), dust (n = 34) and CS (n = 34) was conducted from inside and outside the excavator at underground excavation workshop in four different construction sites. EC, OC, TC and CS were sampled with each respirable and total particulates. EC, OC, and TC were collected on quartz-filter and analyzed using the thermal optical transmittance method. PAHs was collected on polytetrafluorethylene filter with XAD-2 and analyzed using liquid chromatography with fluorescence detector. CS and particulates were collected on poly vinyl chloride filter and analyzed using fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. The geometric mean of respirable EC, OC, TC, total PAHs, respirable dust and respirable CS were 8.69 μg/m3, 34.32 μg/m3, 44.96 μg/m3, 6.818 μg/m3 0.13 mg/m3 and 0.02 mg/m3 from inside the excavator and 33.20 μg/m3, 46.53 μg/m3, 78.21 μg/m3, 3.934 μg/m3, 0.9 mg/m3 and 0.08 mg/m3 from outside the excavator (underground excavation workshop), respectively. The EC and RCS concentration from outside the excavator is significantly higher than that of inside the excavator (p<0.01). The worksite with rock ground, higher vehicle density, blasting and enclosed environments had higher exposure to EC than other sites (p<0.05). There was no significant difference of EC concentration between total and respirable particulates. In top down construction sites, EC concentrations during underground excavation work exceeded recommended exposure limits as 20 μg/m3, accounted for about 50% of the total sample, and the level of concentration of RCS exceeded 1.5 times of occupational exposure limit, 0.05 mg/m3. Efforts are needed to minimize exposure to diesel engine exhaust and silica in underground excavation sites. Management of diesel engine vehicle, supply of fresh air and ventilation and introducing water facilities to create wet environment in underground worksites are strongly suggested."
https://openalex.org/W3085415358,"Understanding the extent and limitation of viral genome evolution can provide insight about potential drug and vaccine targets. Influenza B Viruses (IBVs) infect humans in a seasonal manner and causes significant morbidity and mortality. IBVs are negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses with a segmented genome and can be divided into two antigenically distinct lineages. The two lineages have been circulating and further evolving for almost four decades. The immune response to IBV infection can lead to antibodies that target the strain causing the infection. Some antibodies are cross-reactive and are able to bind strains from both lineages but, because of antigenic drift and immunodominance, both lineages continue to evolve and challenge human health. Here we investigate changes in the genomes of an IBVs from each lineage after passage in tissue culture in the presence of human sera containing polyclonal antibodies directed toward antigenically and temporally distinct viruses. Our previous analysis of the fourth segment, which encodes the major surface protein HA, revealed a pattern of change in which signature sequences from one lineage mutated to the signature sequences of the other lineage. Here we analyze genes from the other genomic segments and observe that most of the quasispecies' heterogeneity occurs at the same loci in each lineage. The nature of the variants at these loci are investigated and possible reasons for this pattern are discussed. This work expands our understanding of the extent and limitations of genomic change in IBV."
https://openalex.org/W3086383893,"Cycling for transport could integrate physical activity (PA) into daily routines and potentially increase total PA levels. However, for parents with young children, most factors affecting transport mode choice tend to facilitate car use. Greater insight is necessary into reasons for (not) using sustainable transport modes in parents with young children. Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore the experiences, including motives, perceptions, attitudes, and norms, of parents of young children by using an e-bike, a longtail bike, and a traditional bike for everyday travel to the workplace, kindergarten, and the grocery store during the autumn, winter, and spring, in nine months.Semistructured focus group interviews were conducted with 18 parents of young children residing in southern Norway. Parents were recruited through Facebook announcements and direct contact with kindergartens, selected organisations, and companies in the Kristiansand municipality. Data were analysed by systematic text condensation by using NVivo V.11.Participants' experiences were summarised by three main themes: 'cycling is cumbersome', 'cycling reflects the desirable me', and 'breaking the cycling code'. Time use, planning, logistics, wet and cold weather, long distances, and no cycling habit were frequently mentioned barriers, and the most notable facilitator was the children's attitude towards cycling. In general, children loved to cycle and preferred cycling to driving. Additionally, the freedom and independence of cycling were emphasised and valued.In challenging weather conditions, parents of young children may experience cycling as cumbersome but desirable, and bike access could increase the feasibility of daily cycling."
https://openalex.org/W3084672505,"Emerging evidence indicates that a strong relationship exists between brain regenerative therapies and nutrition. Early life nutrition plays an important role during embryonic brain development, and there are clear consequences to an imbalance in nutritional factors on both the production and survival of mature neuronal populations and the infant's risk of diseases in later life. Our research and that of others suggest that vitamins play a fundamental role in the formation of neurons and their survival. There is a growing body of evidence that nicotinamide, the water-soluble amide form of vitamin B3, is implicated in the conversion of pluripotent stem cells to clinically relevant cells for regenerative therapies. This study investigated the ability of nicotinamide to promote the development of mature catecholaminergic neuronal populations (associated with Parkinson's disease) from mouse embryonic stem cells, as well as investigating the underlying mechanisms of nicotinamide's action. Nicotinamide selectively enhanced the production of tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing neurons and serotonergic neurons from mouse embryonic stem cell cultures (Sox1GFP knock-in 46C cell line). A 5-Ethynyl-2´-deoxyuridine (EdU) assay ascertained that nicotinamide, when added in the initial phase, reduced cell proliferation. Nicotinamide drove tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing neuron differentiation as effectively as an established cocktail of signalling factors, reducing the proliferation of neural progenitors and accelerating neuronal maturation, neurite outgrowth and neurotransmitter expression. These novel findings show that nicotinamide enhanced and enriched catecholaminergic differentiation and inhibited cell proliferation by directing cell cycle arrest in mouse embryonic stem cell cultures, thus driving a critical neural proliferation-to-differentiation switch from neural progenitors to neurons. Further research into the role of vitamin metabolites in embryogenesis will significantly advance cell-based regenerative medicine, and help realize their role as crucial developmental signalling molecules in brain development."
https://openalex.org/W3085121239,"Hematological reference intervals are important in clinical and diagnostic management for the assessment of health and disease conditions. Hematological reference intervals are better to be established based on gender and age differences as these are among the main affecting factors.The aim of this study was to establish hematological reference intervals among apparently healthy adolescents aged 12-17 years in Mekelle City, Tigrai, Northern Ethiopia, 2019.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in 249 adolescents aged 12-17 years from December 2018 to May 2019. About 4ml of blood sample was collected from each study participant using vacutainer tube containing K2EDTA. Hematological parameters were analyzed using Sysmex KX-21N hematology analyzer (Sysmex Corporation Kobe, Japan). Data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 23. Both parametric and non-parametric analyses were used to calculate the median and 95% of reference intervals. The 97.5th and 2.5th percentiles were calculated using descriptive statistics for the upper and lower reference limits of the study participants. Differences in reference intervals between male and female participants were evaluated using the Mann-Whitney U test.Among the 249 participants 122 (49%) were males and 127 (51%) were females with the median age of 14.5 (range 12 to 17) years were recruited in this study. The median and the 95% reference intervals of hematological parameters were determined. The 95% RIs were: Red blood cells (1012/Liter) 4.6-5.9 (Males) and 4.3-5.6 (Females), White blood cells (109/Liter) 2.9-9.6 (Males) and 3.4-10.2 (Females), Hemoglobin (g/dl) 12.6-17.1 (Males) and 12-15.4 (Females), Platelets (109/Liter) 138-364 (Males) and 151-462 (Females). Almost all of the hematological parameters showed significant differences (p<0.05) across gender.The hematological reference intervals established in this study showed a difference based on gender. We suggest preparing and using distinct local reference intervals for males and females separately."
https://openalex.org/W3086771469,"Although previous evidence has shown that deviated foot structure and function are associated with falls, little is known of the association between foot rotations and falls in apparently healthy older adults. Therefore, the main purpose of the study was to determine the associations between foot rotation and falls. In this cross-sectional study, we recruited 120 older women (mean±SD; age 71.01±6.77 years; height 158.92±21.41 cm; weight 70.29±12.97 kg; body-mass index 26.79±4.42 kg/m2). Foot rotations were assessed by using pressure platform (Zebris manufacturer, Munich, Germany), while the risk of falls was assessed by using Downtown Fall Risk Index questionnaire. Correlations and multiple regression models were applied to calculate the associations. In unadjusted model, higher foot rotation was associated with higher risk of falls (β = 0.14, p<0.001 for both feet). In a model adjusted for age, body-mass index, foot pain and fitness index, higher foot rotation remained associated with higher risk of falls (β = 0.10, p<0.001 for both feet). Our study shows that older adults with higher foot rotation are at higher risk of falls. Special interventions aiming to correct for deviated foot function in older women are warranted."
