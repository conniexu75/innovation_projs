https://openalex.org/W3127143267,"Eluding detection Influenza viruses evade immunity initiated by previous infection, which explains recurrent influenza pandemics. Unlike the error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and related viruses contain polymerases with proofreading activity. However, proofreading cannot correct deletions, which during a long-term persistent infection could result in the generation of viruses showing alteration of entire stretches of amino acids and the structures they form. McCarthy et al. identified an evolutionary signature defined by prevalent and recurrent deletions in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 at four antigenic sites. Deletion variants show human-to-human transmission of viruses with altered antigenicity. Science , this issue p. 1139"

In South Carolina, the spatial and temporal patterns were different, initially concentrating in small towns within metro counties, then diffusing to centralized urban areas and rural areas. When mitigation restrictions were relaxed, hotspots reappeared in the major cities. This paper examines the county-scale spatial and temporal patterns of confirmed cases of COVID-19 for South Carolina from March 1 st —September 5 th , 2020. We first describe the initial diffusion of the new confirmed cases per week across the state, which remained under 2,000 cases until Memorial Day weekend (epi week 23) then dramatically increased, peaking in mid-July (epi week 29), and slowly declining thereafter. Second, we found significant differences in cases and deaths between urban and rural counties, partially related to the timing of the number of confirmed cases and deaths and the implementation of state and local mitigations. Third, we found that the case rates and mortality rates positively correlated with pre-existing social vulnerability. There was also a negative correlation between mortality rates and county resilience patterns, as expected, suggesting that counties with higher levels of inherent resilience had fewer deaths per 100,000 population."
https://openalex.org/W3128255849,"Background As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has remained in Latin America, Mexico has become the third country with the highest death rate worldwide. Data regarding in-hospital mortality and its risk factors, as well as the impact of hospital overcrowding in Latin America has not been thoroughly explored. Methods and findings In this prospective cohort study, we enrolled consecutive adult patients hospitalized with severe confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia at a SARS-CoV-2 referral center in Mexico City from February 26th, 2020, to June 5th, 2020. A total of 800 patients were admitted with confirmed diagnosis, mean age was 51.9 ± 13.9 years, 61% were males, 85% were either obese or overweight, 30% had hypertension and 26% type 2 diabetes. From those 800, 559 recovered (69.9%) and 241 died (30.1%). Among survivors, 101 (18%) received invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) and 458 (82%) were managed outside the intensive care unit (ICU); mortality in the ICU was 49%. From the non-survivors, 45.6% (n = 110) did not receive full support due to lack of ICU bed availability. Within this subgroup the main cause of death was acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in 95% of the cases, whereas among the non-survivors who received full (n = 105) support the main cause of death was septic shock (45%) followed by ARDS (29%). The main risk factors associated with in-hospital death were male sex (RR 2.05, 95% CI 1.34–3.12), obesity (RR 1.62, 95% CI 1.14–2.32)—in particular morbid obesity (RR 3.38, 95%CI 1.63–7.00)—and oxygen saturation &lt; 80% on admission (RR 4.8, 95%CI 3.26–7.31). Conclusions In this study we found similar in-hospital and ICU mortality, as well as risk factors for mortality, compared to previous reports. However, 45% of the patients who did not survive justified admission to ICU but did not receive IMV / ICU care due to the unavailability of ICU beds. Furthermore, mortality rate over time was mainly due to the availability of ICU beds, indirectly suggesting that overcrowding was one of the main factors that contributed to hospital mortality."
https://openalex.org/W3128459342,"Most ovarian cancers are infiltrated by prognostically relevant activated T cells1-3, yet exhibit low response rates to immune checkpoint inhibitors4. Memory B cell and plasma cell infiltrates have previously been associated with better outcomes in ovarian cancer5,6, but the nature and functional relevance of these responses are controversial. Here, using 3 independent cohorts that in total comprise 534 patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer, we show that robust, protective humoral responses are dominated by the production of polyclonal IgA, which binds to polymeric IgA receptors that are universally expressed on ovarian cancer cells. Notably, tumour B-cell-derived IgA redirects myeloid cells against extracellular oncogenic drivers, which causes tumour cell death. In addition, IgA transcytosis through malignant epithelial cells elicits transcriptional changes that antagonize the RAS pathway and sensitize tumour cells to cytolytic killing by T cells, which also contributes to hindering malignant progression. Thus, tumour-antigen-specific and -antigen-independent IgA responses antagonize the growth of ovarian cancer by governing coordinated tumour cell, T cell and B cell responses. These findings provide a platform for identifying targets that are spontaneously recognized by intratumoural B-cell-derived antibodies, and suggest that immunotherapies that augment B cell responses may be more effective than approaches that focus on T cells, particularly for malignancies that are resistant to checkpoint inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W3128683827,"Background The term “metabolic (dysfunction)-associated fatty liver disease” (MAFLD) is suggested alternative for “non-alcoholic fatty liver disease” (NAFLD), as it better reflects metabolic dysfunction. No study has compared outcomes of the two diagnostic criteria. Methods In an ongoing, community-based, cohort-study in suburban Sri Lanka, participants were randomly selected in 2007. They were reassessed in 2014 to evaluate new-onset metabolic traits (MTs) and cardiovascular-events (CVEs). Baseline characteristics, MTs and CVEs after 7-years were compared in NAFLD and MAFLD and vs. controls. Similarly, we compared these parameters in those excluded by the NAFLD definition but captured by the MAFLD definition and vice versa, and vs. controls. Findings Of 2985 recruited in 2007, 940 (31.5%) had NAFLD, 990 (33.1%) had MAFLD and 362 (12.1%) were controls. When compared to NAFLD, MAFLD captured an additional 2.9% and lost 1.3% individuals. At baseline, anthropometric and metabolic traits were similar in NAFLD and MAFLD. At follow-up in 7-years, the risk of having new-onset MTs and fatal/non-fatal CVEs were similar in the groups, but were significantly higher compared to controls. Those excluded by the NAFLD definition but captured by the MAFLD definition showed higher baseline MTs compared to those excluded by the MAFLD definition but captured by the NAFLD definition, and had substantially higher risk for having new-onset MTs and CVEs compared to controls. Interpretation Although NAFLD and MAFLD had similar MTs at baseline, and similar outcomes after 7-years, those who were excluded by the NAFLD definition but captured by the MAFLD definition seem at higher risk of adverse outcomes than those excluded by the MAFLD definition but captured by the NAFLD definition. Although the increase in the index population was small, redefining NAFLD as MAFLD seemed to improve clinical utility."
https://openalex.org/W3128235268,"Governments around the globe have started to develop and deploy digital contact tracing apps to gain control over the spread of the novel coronavirus (Covid-19). The appropriateness and usefulness of these technologies as a containment measure have since sparked political and academic discussions globally. The present paper contributes to this debate through an exploration of how the national daily newspapers in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland reported on the development and adoption of digital contact-tracing apps during early and after stages of the lockdown. These countries were among the first in Europe to develop apps and were critical voices in the debate of decentralized vs. centralized data processing. We conducted thematic analysis on news coverage published between January and May 2020 in high-circulation national daily newspapers from Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. A total of 148 articles from nine newspaper companies were included in the final analysis. From our analysis emerged six core themes of the development and adoption of digital contact tracing apps: 1) data governance; 2) role of IT giants; 3) scientific rigor; 4) voluntariness; 5) functional efficacy; 6) role of the app. These results shed light on the different facets of discussion regarding digital contact tracing as portrayed in German-speaking media. This study complements emerging survey data on public perceptions of digital contact tracing apps by providing a better understanding of the ideas circulating in the media ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W3128390625,"The COVID-19 pandemic has become one of the main international concerns regarding its impact on mental health. The present study aims to investigate the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress symptoms, and behavioral aspects amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in a Brazilian population. An online survey was administered from May 22 to June 5, 2020 using a questionnaire comprising of sociodemographic information, the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS-21), and the Coping Strategies Inventory. Participants comprised 3,000 people from Brazil’s 26 states and the Federal District, with an average age of 39.8 years, women (83%), married (50.6%), graduates (70.1%) and employees (46.7%). Some contracted the virus (6.4%) and had dead friends or relatives (22.7%). There was more consumption of drugs, tobacco, medication, and food (40.8%). Almost half of participants expressed symptoms of depression (46.4%), anxiety (39.7%), and stress (42.2%). These were higher in women, people without children, students, patients with chronic diseases, and people who had contact with others diagnosed with COVID-19. The existence of a group more vulnerable to situations with a high stress burden requires greater attention regarding mental health during and after the pandemic. That said, it should be emphasized that these findings are preliminary and portray a moment still being faced by many people amid the pandemic and quarantine measures. Therefore, we understand that the magnitude of the impacts on mental health will only be more specific with continuous studies after total relaxation of the quarantine."
https://openalex.org/W3128817403,"Background Technology enables the continuous monitoring of personal health parameter data during pregnancy regardless of the disruption of normal daily life patterns. Our research group has established a project investigating the usefulness of an Internet of Things–based system and smartwatch technology for monitoring women during pregnancy to explore variations in stress, physical activity and sleep. The aim of this study was to examine daily patterns of well-being in pregnant women before and during the national stay-at-home restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic in Finland. Methods A longitudinal cohort study design was used to monitor pregnant women in their everyday settings. Two cohorts of pregnant women were recruited. In the first wave in January-December 2019, pregnant women with histories of preterm births (gestational weeks 22–36) or late miscarriages (gestational weeks 12–21); and in the second wave between October 2019 and March 2020, pregnant women with histories of full-term births (gestational weeks 37–42) and no pregnancy losses were recruited. The final sample size for this study was 38 pregnant women. The participants continuously used the Samsung Gear Sport smartwatch and their heart rate variability, and physical activity and sleep data were collected. Subjective stress, activity and sleep reports were collected using a smartphone application developed for this study. Data between February 12 to April 8, 2020 were included to cover four-week periods before and during the national stay-at-home restrictions. Hierarchical linear mixed models were exploited to analyze the trends in the outcome variables. Results The pandemic-related restrictions were associated with changes in heart rate variability: the standard deviation of all normal inter-beat intervals (p = 0.034), low-frequency power (p = 0.040) and the low-frequency/high-frequency ratio (p = 0.013) increased compared with the weeks before the restrictions. Women’s subjectively evaluated stress levels also increased significantly. Physical activity decreased when the restrictions were set and as pregnancy proceeded. The total sleep time also decreased as pregnancy proceeded, but pandemic-related restrictions were not associated with sleep. Daily rhythms changed in that the participants overall started to sleep later and woke up later. Conclusions The findings showed that Finnish pregnant women coped well with the pandemic-related restrictions and lockdown environment in terms of stress, physical activity and sleep."
https://openalex.org/W3126524771,"Strict storage recommendations for insulin are difficult to follow in hot tropical regions and even more challenging in conflict and humanitarian emergency settings, adding an extra burden to the management of people with diabetes. According to pharmacopeia unopened insulin vials must be stored in a refrigerator (2–8°C), while storage at ambient temperature (25–30°C) is usually permitted for the 4-week usage period during treatment. In the present work we address a critical question towards improving diabetes care in resource poor settings, namely whether insulin is stable and retains biological activity in tropical temperatures during a 4-week treatment period. To answer this question, temperature fluctuations were measured in Dagahaley refugee camp (Northern Kenya) using log tag recorders. Oscillating temperatures between 25 and 37°C were observed. Insulin heat stability was assessed under these specific temperatures which were precisely reproduced in the laboratory. Different commercialized formulations of insulin were quantified weekly by high performance liquid chromatography and the results showed perfect conformity to pharmacopeia guidelines, thus confirming stability over the assessment period (four weeks). Monitoring the 3D-structure of the tested insulin by circular dichroism confirmed that insulin monomer conformation did not undergo significant modifications. The measure of insulin efficiency on insulin receptor (IR) and Akt phosphorylation in hepatic cells indicated that insulin bioactivity of the samples stored at oscillating temperature during the usage period is identical to that of the samples maintained at 2–8°C. Taken together, these results indicate that insulin can be stored at such oscillating ambient temperatures for the usual four–week period of use. This enables the barrier of cold storage during use to be removed, thereby opening up the perspective for easier management of diabetes in humanitarian contexts and resource poor settings."
https://openalex.org/W3127066098,"In vitro embryo production systems are limited by their inability to consistently produce embryos with the competency to develop to the blastocyst stage, survive cryopreservation, and establish a pregnancy. Previous work identified a combination of three cytokines [fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)], called FLI, that we hypothesize improve preimplantation development of bovine embryos in vitro. To test this hypothesis, FLI was supplemented into oocyte maturation or embryo culture medium. Embryos were produced in vitro using abattoir-derived oocytes and fertilized with sperm from a single bull known to have high fertility. After an 18–20 h fertilization period, putative zygotes were cultured in synthetic oviductal fluid (SOF) for 8 days. The addition of FLI to the oocyte maturation medium increased ( P &lt; 0.05) the dissociation of transzonal projections at 12, 18, and 24 h of maturation, as well as, the proportion of oocytes that reached the metaphase II stage of meiosis. Additionally, lipid content was decreased ( P &lt; 0.05) in the blastocyst stage embryo. The addition of FLI during the culture period increased development to the blastocyst stage, cytoskeleton integrity, and survival following slow freezing, as well as, decreased post thaw cell apoptosis ( P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, the supplementation of these cytokines in vitro has the potential to alleviate some of the challenges associated with the cryo-survival of in vitro produced bovine embryos through improving embryo development and embryo quality."
https://openalex.org/W3034151881,"Emotion states recognition using wireless signals is an emerging area of research that has an impact on neuroscientific studies of human behaviour and well-being monitoring. Currently, standoff emotion detection is mostly reliant on the analysis of facial expressions and/or eye movements acquired from optical or video cameras. Meanwhile, although they have been widely accepted for recognizing human emotions from the multimodal data, machine learning approaches have been mostly restricted to subject dependent analyses which lack of generality. In this paper, we report an experimental study which collects heartbeat and breathing signals of 15 participants from radio frequency (RF) reflections off the body followed by novel noise filtering techniques. We propose a novel deep neural network (DNN) architecture based on the fusion of raw RF data and the processed RF signal for classifying and visualising various emotion states. The proposed model achieves high classification accuracy of 71.67 % for independent subjects with 0.71, 0.72 and 0.71 precision, recall and F1-score values respectively. We have compared our results with those obtained from five different classical ML algorithms and it is established that deep learning offers a superior performance even with limited amount of raw RF and post processed time-sequence data. The deep learning model has also been validated by comparing our results with those from ECG signals. Our results indicate that using wireless signals for stand-by emotion state detection is a better alternative to other technologies with high accuracy and have much wider applications in future studies of behavioural sciences."
https://openalex.org/W3126592836,"Weighing alternatives during reward pursuit is a vital cognitive computation that, when disrupted by stress, yields aspects of neuropsychiatric disorders. To examine the neural mechanisms underlying these phenomena, we employed a behavioral task in which mice were confronted by a reward and its omission (i.e., error). The experience of error outcomes engaged neuronal dynamics within the lateral habenula (LHb), a subcortical structure that supports appetitive behaviors and is susceptible to stress. A high incidence of errors predicted low strength of habenular excitatory synapses. Accordingly, stressful experiences increased error choices while decreasing glutamatergic neurotransmission onto LHb neurons. This synaptic adaptation required a reduction in postsynaptic AMPA receptors (AMPARs), irrespective of the anatomical source of glutamate. Bidirectional control of habenular AMPAR transmission recapitulated and averted stress-driven cognitive deficits. Thus, a subcortical synaptic mechanism vulnerable to stress underlies behavioral efficiency during cognitive performance."
https://openalex.org/W3127492012,"Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-COV), first identified in Saudi Arabia, was caused by a novel strain of coronavirus. Outbreaks were recorded from different regions of the world, especially South Korea and the Middle East, and were correlated with a 35% mortality rate. MERS-COV is a single-stranded, positive RNA virus that reaches the host by binding to the receptor of dipeptidyl-peptides. Because of the unavailability of the vaccine available for the protection from MERS-COV infection, the rapid case detection, isolation, infection prevention has been recommended to combat MERS-COV infection. So, vaccines for the treatment of MERS-COV infection need to be developed urgently. A possible antiviral mechanism for preventing MERS-CoV infection has been considered to be MERS-CoV vaccines that elicit unique T-cell responses. In the present study, we incorporated both molecular docking and immunoinformatic approach to introduce a multiepitope vaccine (MEP) against MERS-CoV by selecting 15 conserved epitopes from seven viral proteins such as three structural proteins (envelope, membrane, and nucleoprotein) and four non-structural proteins (ORF1a, ORF8, ORF3, ORF4a). The epitopes, which were examined for non-homologous to host and antigenicity, were selected on the basis of conservation between T-cell, B-cell, and IFN-γ epitopes. The selected epitopes were then connected to the adjuvant (β-defensin) at the N-terminal through an AAY linker to increase the immunogenic potential. Structural modelling and physiochemical characteristic were applied to the vaccine construct developed. Afterwards the structure has been successfully docked with antigenic receptor, Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3) and in-silico cloning ensures that its expression efficiency is legitimate. Nonetheless the MEP presented needs tests to verify its safety and immunogenic profile."
https://openalex.org/W3124600788,"Background and objectives Choir singing has been associated with better mood and quality of life (QOL) in healthy older adults, but little is known about its potential cognitive benefits in aging. In this study, our aim was to compare the subjective (self-reported) and objective (test-based) cognitive functioning of senior choir singers and matched control subjects, coupled with assessment of mood, QOL, and social functioning. Research design and methods We performed a cross-sectional questionnaire study in 162 healthy older (age ≥ 60 years) adults (106 choir singers, 56 controls), including measures of cognition, mood, social engagement, QOL, and role of music in daily life. The choir singers were divided to low (1–10 years, N = 58) and high (&gt;10 years, N = 48) activity groups based on years of choir singing experience throughout their life span. A subcohort of 74 participants (39 choir singers, 35 controls) were assessed also with a neuropsychological testing battery. Results In the neuropsychological testing, choir singers performed better than controls on the verbal flexibility domain of executive function, but not on other cognitive domains. In questionnaires, high activity choir singers showed better social integration than controls and low activity choir singers. In contrast, low activity choir singers had better general health than controls and high activity choir singers. Discussion and implications In healthy older adults, regular choir singing is associated with better verbal flexibility. Long-standing choir activity is linked to better social engagement and more recently commenced choir activity to better general health."
https://openalex.org/W3126832702,"Re-opening of communities in the midst of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has ignited new waves of infections in many places around the world. Mitigating the risk of reopening will require widespread SARS-CoV-2 testing, which would be greatly facilitated by simple, rapid, and inexpensive testing methods. This study evaluates several protocols for RNA extraction and RT-qPCR that are simpler and less expensive than prevailing methods. First, isopropanol precipitation is shown to provide an effective means of RNA extraction from nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples. Second, direct addition of NP swab samples to RT-qPCRs is evaluated without an RNA extraction step. A simple, inexpensive swab collection solution suitable for direct addition is validated using contrived swab samples. Third, an open-source master mix for RT-qPCR is described that permits detection of viral RNA in NP swab samples with a limit of detection of approximately 50 RNA copies per reaction. Quantification cycle (Cq) values for purified RNA from 30 known positive clinical samples showed a strong correlation (r 2 = 0.98) between this homemade master mix and commercial TaqPath master mix. Lastly, end-point fluorescence imaging is found to provide an accurate diagnostic readout without requiring a qPCR thermocycler. Adoption of these simple, open-source methods has the potential to reduce the time and expense of COVID-19 testing."
https://openalex.org/W3126793828,"This paper reports a novel, negligible-cost and open-source process for the rapid prototyping of complex microfluidic devices in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) using 3D-printed interconnecting microchannel scaffolds. These single-extrusion scaffolds are designed with interconnecting ends and used to quickly configure complex microfluidic systems before being embedded in PDMS to produce an imprint of the microfluidic configuration. The scaffolds are printed using common Material Extrusion (MEX) 3D printers and the limits, cost &amp; reliability of the process are evaluated. The limits of standard MEX 3D-printing with off-the-shelf printer modifications is shown to achieve a minimum channel cross-section of 100×100 μm. The paper also lays out a protocol for the rapid fabrication of low-cost microfluidic channel moulds from the thermoplastic 3D-printed scaffolds, allowing the manufacture of customisable microfluidic systems without specialist equipment. The morphology of the resulting PDMS microchannels fabricated with the method are characterised and, when applied directly to glass, without plasma surface treatment, are shown to efficiently operate within the typical working pressures of commercial microfluidic devices. The technique is further validated through the demonstration of 2 common microfluidic devices; a fluid-mixer demonstrating the effective interconnecting scaffold design, and a microsphere droplet generator. The minimal cost of manufacture means that a 5000-piece physical library of mix-and-match channel scaffolds (100 μm scale) can be printed for ~$0.50 and made available to researchers and educators who lack access to appropriate technology. This simple yet innovative approach dramatically lowers the threshold for research and education into microfluidics and will make possible the rapid prototyping of point-of-care lab-on-a-chip diagnostic technology that is truly affordable the world over."
https://openalex.org/W3127580137,"Thailand is among the top five countries with effective COVID-19 transmission control. This study examines how news of presence of COVID-19 in Thailand, as well as varying levels of government restriction on movement, affected human mobility in a rural Thai population along the border with Myanmar.This study makes use of mobility data collected using a smartphone app. Between November 2019 and June 2020, four major events concerning information dissemination or government intervention give rise to five time intervals of analysis. Radius of gyration is used to analyze movement in each interval, and movement during government-imposed curfew. Human mobility network visualization is used to identify changes in travel patterns between main geographic locations of activity. Cross-border mobility analysis highlights potential for intervillage and intercountry disease transmission.Inter-village and cross-border movement was common in the pre-COVID-19 period. Radius of gyration and cross-border trips decreased following news of the first imported cases. During the government lockdown period, radius of gyration was reduced by more than 90% and cross-border movement was mostly limited to short-distance trips. Human mobility was nearly back to normal after relaxation of the lockdown.This study provides insight into the impact of the government lockdown policy on an area with extremely low socio-economic status, poor healthcare resources, and highly active cross-border movement. The lockdown had a great impact on reducing individual mobility, including cross-border movement. The quick return to normal mobility after relaxation of the lockdown implies that close monitoring of disease should be continued to prevent a second wave."
https://openalex.org/W3129087799,"Abstract Brian metastasis, which is diagnosed in 30% of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients with metastasis, causes poor survival outcomes. Growing evidence has characterized miRNAs involving in breast cancer brain metastasis; however, currently, there is a lack of prognostic plasma-based indicator for brain metastasis. In this study, high level of miR-211 can act as brain metastatic prognostic marker in vivo. High miR-211 drives early and specific brain colonization through enhancing trans-blood–brain barrier (BBB) migration, BBB adherence, and stemness properties of tumor cells and causes poor survival in vivo. SOX11 and NGN2 are the downstream targets of miR-211 and negatively regulate miR-211-mediated TNBC brain metastasis in vitro and in vivo. Most importantly, high miR-211 is correlated with poor survival and brain metastasis in TNBC patients. Our findings suggest that miR-211 may be used as an indicator for TNBC brain metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W3127462145,"Objective Understanding mild to moderate symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) is important in order to identify active cases early and thus counteract transmission. Methods In March 2020, Leipzig University Hospital established an outpatient clinic for patients potentially infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Confirmed cases with mild to moderate symptoms self-isolated at home and were followed-up by daily telephone calls for at least 14 days. Symptoms and course of illness of these patients are reported here. Results From March 20 to April 17, 2020, 1460 individuals were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by naso- or oropharyngeal swab for real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Covid-19 was confirmed in 91 (6.2%) patients, of which 87 were included in the final analysis. Patients presented for testing after a mean of 5.9 days (IQR = 2.0–8.5). The median age was 37.0 years (IQR = 28.5–53), and 48 (55.2%) were female. Five (5.7%) patients required hospital admission during the course of illness. Most frequently reported symptoms were fatigue (n = 64, 74%), cough (n = 58, 67%), and hyposmia/hypogeusia (n = 44, 51%). In contrast to previous reports, fever occurred in less than a third of patients (n = 25, 29%). By day 14, more than half of the patients had recovered completely (n = 37/70, 52.9%). Conclusions Fever seems to be less common in patients of relatively young age diagnosed with mild to moderate Covid-19. This suggests that body temperature alone may be an insufficient indicator of SARS-CoV-2 infection."
https://openalex.org/W3128651414,"Introduction Severe and moderate acute malnutrition (SAM and MAM) affect more than 50 million children worldwide yet 80% of these children do not access care. The Combined Protocol for Acute Malnutrition Study (ComPAS) trial assessed the effectiveness of a simplified, combined SAM/MAM protocol for children aged 6–59 months and found non-inferior recovery compared to standard care. To further inform policy, this study assessed post-discharge outcomes of children treated with this novel protocol in Kenya. Methods Six ‘combined’ protocol clinics treated SAM and MAM children using an optimised mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC)-based dose of ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF). Six ‘standard care’ clinics treated SAM with weight-based RUTF rations; MAM with ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF). Four months post-discharge, we assessed anthropometry, recent history of illness, and body composition by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Data was analysed using multivariable linear regression, adjusted for age, sex and allowing for clustering by clinic. Results We sampled 850 children (median age 18 months, IQR 15–23); 44% of the original trial sample in Kenya. Children treated with the combined protocol had similar anthropometry, fat-free mass, fat mass, skinfold thickness z-scores, and frequency of common illnesses 4 months post-discharge compared the standard protocol. Mean subscapular skinfold z-scores were close to the global norm (standard care: 0.24; combined 0.27). There was no significant difference in odds of relapse between protocols (SAM, 3% vs 3%, OR = 1.0 p = 0.75; MAM, 10% vs 12%, OR = 0.90 p = 0.34). Conclusions Despite the lower dosage of RUTF for most SAM children in the combined protocol, their anthropometry and relapse rates at 4 months post-discharge were similar to standard care. MAM children treated with RUTF had similar body composition to those treated with RUSF and neither group exhibited excess adiposity. These results add further evidence that a combined protocol is as effective as standard care with no evidence of adverse effects post-discharge. A simplified, combined approach could treat more children, stretch existing resources further, and contribute to achieving Sustainable Development Goal Two."
https://openalex.org/W3127219510,"Background The effects of multiple meteorological factors on influenza activity remain unclear in Chongqing, the largest municipality in China. We aimed to fix this gap in this study. Methods Weekly meteorological data and influenza surveillance data in Chongqing were collected from 2012 to 2019. Distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNMs) were conducted to estimate the effects of multiple meteorological factors on influenza activity. Results Inverted J-shaped nonlinear associations between mean temperature, absolute humidity, wind speed, sunshine and influenza activity were found. The relative risks (RRs) of influenza activity increased as weekly average mean temperature fell below 18.18°C, average absolute humidity fell below 12.66 g/m 3 , average wind speed fell below 1.55 m/s and average sunshine fell below 2.36 hours. Taking the median values as the references, lower temperature, lower absolute humidity and windless could significantly increase the risks of influenza activity and last for 4 weeks. A J-shaped nonlinear association was observed between relative humidity and influenza activity; the risk of influenza activity increased with rising relative humidity with 78.26% as the break point. Taking the median value as the reference, high relative humidity could increase the risk of influenza activity and last for 3 weeks. In addition, we found the relationship between aggregate rainfall and influenza activity could be described with a U-shaped curve. Rainfall effect has significantly higher RR than rainless effect. Conclusions Our study shows that multiple meteorological factors have strong associations with influenza activity in Chongqing, providing evidence for developing a meteorology-based early warning system for influenza to facilitate timely response to upsurge of influenza activity."

We investigated between-subject and within-subject thermal variability, whether a significant percentage of individuals have a low mean oral temperature, and whether these differ by sex, age, time of day, ethnicity, body mass index (BMI), or menstrual phase. Oral temperature was measured by Life Brand® Fast-Read Digital Oral Thermometers and sampled 14 times over two weeks, seven morning and seven evening readings. The volunteer sample consisted of 96 adults (42 men, 54 women; 27 couples, 42 singletons), ages 18-67 years. We found sizeable individual differences in body temperature and that the normal temperature of many individuals is considerably lower than 37.0°C (98.6°F). Mean temperatures ranged from 35.2°C (95.4°F) to 37.4°C (99.3°F). The mean temperature across all participants was 36.1°C (97.0°F)-lower than most studies have reported, consistent with recent evidence of temperature declining over decades. 77% had mean temperatures at least 0.55°C (1°F) lower than 37.0°C (98.6°F). Mean temperature did not differ by age, but women had higher temperatures than men, even within a couple with room temperature and warmth of clothing equated. Although oral temperature varied widely across individuals, it showed marked stability within individuals over days. Variability of temperature over days did not differ by sex, but was larger among younger adults. Using 37.0°C (98.6°F) as the assumed normal temperature for everyone can result in healthcare professionals failing to detect a serious fever in individuals with a low normal temperature or obtaining false negatives for those individuals when using temperature to screen for COVID-19, mistaking their elevated temperature as normal. Some have called for lowering the estimate of normal temperature slightly (e.g., 0.2°C [0.36°F]). That still seems an overly high estimate. More important, using any standardized ""normal"" temperature will lead to errors for many people. Individual differences are simply too great. Personalizing body temperature is needed. Temperature could be measured at yearly doctor visits, as blood pressure is now. That would be simple to implement. Since our results show marked thermal stability within an individual, sampling temperature only once yearly could provide an accurate indication of a person's normal temperature at that time of day. Such records over time would also provide a more accurate understanding of how temperature changes over the lifespan."
https://openalex.org/W3128428198,"Chito-oligosaccharides (CHOS) are oligomers of D-glucosamine and N -acetyl-glucosamine. Anti-inflammatory activities of a wide variety of CHOS mixtures have previously been reported, mainly based on studies with mouse models and murine macrophages. Since the mouse and human immune systems are quite different, gaining insight into the activity of CHOS on human cell lines, using well-characterized CHOS mixtures, is of considerable interest. Bacillus subtilis chitosanase (BsCsn46A) can efficiently convert chitosan to mixtures of water soluble low molecular weight CHOS. Here, the anti-inflammatory activity of a properly characterized CHOS mixture was studied, using human THP-1 cells that were differentiated to mature monocytes using vitamin D3. Addition of CHOS reduced the production of multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with bacterial lipopolyssacharide (LPS)-stimulated inflammation, in a dose-dependent manner and without affecting cell viability. Interestingly, only minimal effects of CHOS were observed in similar experiments with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate- (PMA-) differentiated, macrophage-like, THP-1 cells. Altogether, in addition to showing promising biological effects of well-characterized low molecular weight soluble CHOS in a human system, the present study also points at Vitamin D3-stimulated THP-1 cells as a favorable system for assessing the anti-inflammatory activity of bioactive compounds."
https://openalex.org/W3128316141,"Prolonged social isolation is associated with poor physical and mental health outcomes, findings observed in both humans, and rodent models of isolation. Humans, like mice, may engage in enhanced exploratory and social behaviour following isolation, which may protect against subsequent cognitive decline and psychological distress. Understanding how these effects may impact behaviour in older adults is particularly relevant, as this population is likely to experience periods of late-life social isolation. We report that late-life social isolation in female mice did not lead to robust depressive-like symptomology, altered social interaction behaviour, sensitivity to context fear acquisition and memory, or alterations in inflammatory cytokines ( IL-6 , IL-1β , Tnf-α) or microglial activation (Itgam) within the hippocampus. Rather, isolation increased hyperactivity and exploration behaviours. These findings have translational value as the first female mouse model of late-life social isolation, and provide evidence to inform the development of interventions aimed at promoting functional recovery following isolation in late-life."
https://openalex.org/W3128733811,"Background Postnatal care services are a constellation of preventive care, practices, and assessments designed to identify and manage maternal and newborn complications during the first six weeks after birth. Recognizing the role of the appropriate PNC at this critical time, the World Health Organization recommended four visits as a complete PNC for all post-partum mothers and newborns to ensure their survival. Although there have been numerous studies on the factors affecting the general PNC service in Ethiopia, there is a shortage of evidence on the use of complete postnatal care services and its determinants. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the uptake of full postnatal care service and its determinants among women who recently gave birth in the Ezha district of southern Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Ezha district. A two-stage sampling technique was applied. A total of 568 mothers who stayed for at least 6 weeks after childbirth from selected Kebeles were included in the study using computer-generated random numbers. Data collected through pre-established, structured, and interviewer-administered questionnaires were entered into EpiData3.1 and exported to SPPS version 23 for analysis. The Principal Components Analysis (PCA) was carried out to assess the wealth status of participants. The Multivariable logistic regression model has been fitted to identify the determinants of complete post-natal care service uptake. Results The overall uptake of complete postnatal care services in the study area was 23.9% [95% CI: (19.9, 27.5)]. The factors namely; maternal education of secondary and above [AOR: 4.31, 95%CI: 2.15, 8.05], having four and more antenatal visits [AOR: 4.03, 95%CI: 1.83, 8.85], Caesarean delivery [AOR: 3.75, 95%CI: 1.78, 7.92], having good knowledge on PNC [AOR: 4.31, 95%CI: 2.34, 9.04], and being a model household [AOR: 3.61, 95%CI: 1.97, 6.64] were recognized as determinants complete postnatal care uptake. Conclusion and recommendation Complete post-natal care services uptake in the study area was low. Thus, a due emphasis should be given to behavioral change communication activities to improve maternal knowledge on PNC and enhancing adequate ANC uptake by health workers in the district. Besides, health extension workers in the district need to work on creating a model household through continuing education, support, and follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W3126531111,"Wheat rusts are the key biological constraint to wheat production in Ethiopia—one of Africa’s largest wheat producing countries. The fungal diseases cause economic losses and threaten livelihoods of smallholder farmers. While it is known that wheat rust epidemics have occurred in Ethiopia, to date no systematic long-term analysis of past outbreaks has been available. We present results from one of the most comprehensive surveillance campaigns of wheat rusts in Africa. More than 13,000 fields have been surveyed during the last 13 years. Using a combination of spatial data-analysis and visualization, statistical tools, and empirical modelling, we identify trends in the distribution of wheat stem rust (Sr), stripe rust (Yr) and leaf rust (Lr). Results show very high infection levels (mean incidence for Yr: 44%; Sr: 34%; Lr: 18%). These recurrent rust outbreaks lead to substantial economic losses, which we estimate to be of the order of 10s of millions of US-D annually. On the widely adopted wheat variety, Digalu , there is a marked increase in disease prevalence following the incursion of new rust races into Ethiopia, which indicates a pronounced boom-and-bust cycle of major gene resistance. Using spatial analyses, we identify hotspots of disease risk for all three rusts, show a linear correlation between altitude and disease prevalence, and find a pronounced north-south trend in stem rust prevalence. Temporal analyses show a sigmoidal increase in disease levels during the wheat season and strong inter-annual variations. While a simple logistic curve performs satisfactorily in predicting stem rust in some years, it cannot account for the complex outbreak patterns in other years and fails to predict the occurrence of stripe and leaf rust. The empirical insights into wheat rust epidemiology in Ethiopia presented here provide a basis for improving future surveillance and to inform the development of mechanistic models to predict disease spread."
https://openalex.org/W3126639184,"Parkinson’s disease is associated with the loss of dopamine (DA) neurons in ventral mesencephalon. We have previously reported that no single neurotrophic factor we tested protected DA neurons from the dopaminergic toxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP + ) in dissociated cultures isolated from the P0 rat substantia nigra, but that a combination of five neurotrophic factors was protective. We now report that cerebral DA neurotrophic factor (CDNF) and a variant of neurturin (NRTN), N4, were also not protective when provided alone but were protective when added together. In cultures isolated from the substantia nigra, MPP + (10 μM) decreased tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells to 41.7 ± 5.4% of vehicle control. Although treatment of cultures with 100 ng/ml of either CDNF or N4 individually before and after toxin exposure did not significantly increase survival in MPP + -treated cultures, when the two trophic factors were added together at 100 ng/ml each, survival of cells was increased 28.2 ± 6.1% above the effect of MPP + alone. In cultures isolated from the ventral tegmental area, another DA rich area, a higher dose of MPP + (1 mM) was required to produce an EC 50 in TH-positive cells but, as in the substantia nigra, only the combination of CDNF and N4 (100 ng/ml each) was successful at increasing the survival of these cells compared to MPP + alone (by 22.5 ± 3.5%). These data support previous findings that CDNF and N4 may be of therapeutic value for treatment of PD, but suggest that they may need to be administered together."
https://openalex.org/W3126927690,"Despite the need for safe and effective postoperative analgesia in neonates, research regarding pain management in neonatal rodents is relatively limited. Here, we investigate whether sustained release buprenorphine (Bup SR) effectively attenuates thermal hypersensitivity in a neonatal rat model of incisional pain. Male and female postnatal day 3 Sprague Dawley rat pups (n = 34) were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: 1) saline (control), 0.1 mL, once subcutaneously (SC); 2) buprenorphine HCl (Bup HCl), 0.05 mg/kg, once SC; 3) low dose Bup SR (low-SR), 0.5 mg/kg, once SC; 4) high dose Bup SR (high-SR), 1 mg/kg, once SC. Pups were anesthetized with sevoflurane and a 0.5-cm long skin incision was made over the left lateral thigh. The underlying muscle was dissected and closed using surgical glue. Thermal hypersensitivity testing was performed at 24 h prior to surgery and subsequently at 1, 4, 8, 24, and 48 h post-surgery using an infrared diode laser. Thermal hypersensitivity was attenuated at 1 h post-surgery in the Bup HCl group, while it was attenuated through the entire postoperative period in both low-SR and high-SR groups. This data suggests that a single dose of low-SR (0.5 mg/kg) or high-SR (1 mg/kg) effectively attenuates thermal hypersensitivity for at least 8 h in neonatal rat pups."

https://openalex.org/W3128439613,"Collagen deposition contributes to both high mammographic density and breast cancer progression. Low stromal PTEN expression has been observed in as many as half of breast tumors and is associated with increases in collagen deposition, however the mechanism connecting PTEN loss to increased collagen deposition remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Pten knockout in fibroblasts using an Fsp-Cre;Pten loxP/loxP mouse model increases collagen fiber number and fiber size within the mammary gland. Pten knockout additionally upregulated Sparc transcription in fibroblasts and promoted collagen shuttling out of the cell. Interestingly, SPARC mRNA expression was observed to be significantly elevated in the tumor stroma as compared to the normal breast in several patient cohorts. While SPARC knockdown via shRNA did not affect collagen shuttling, it notably decreased assembly of exogenous collagen. In addition, SPARC knockdown decreased fibronectin assembly and alignment of the extracellular matrix in an in vitro fibroblast-derived matrix model. Overall, these data indicate upregulation of SPARC is a mechanism by which PTEN regulates collagen deposition in the mammary gland stroma."
https://openalex.org/W3126641549,"Motorsports have become an excellent playground for testing the limits of technology, machines, and human drivers. This paper presents a study that used a professional racing simulator to compare the behavior of human and autonomous drivers under an aggressive driving scenario. A professional simulator offers a close-to-real emulation of underlying physics and vehicle dynamics, as well as a wealth of clean telemetry data. In the first study, the participants’ task was to achieve the fastest lap while keeping the car on the track. We grouped the resulting laps according to the performance (lap-time), defining driving behaviors at various performance levels. An extensive analysis of vehicle control features obtained from telemetry data was performed with the goal of predicting the driving performance and informing an autonomous system. In the second part of the study, a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm was trained to control the brake, throttle and steering of the simulated racing car. We investigated how the features used to predict driving performance in humans can be used in autonomous driving. Our study investigates human driving patterns with the goal of finding traces that could improve the performance of RL approaches. Conversely, they can also be applied to training (professional) drivers to improve their racing line."
https://openalex.org/W3126790438,"Background Mobility disability and parkinsonism are associated with decreased survival in older adults. This study examined the transition from no motor impairment to mobility disability and parkinsonism and their associations with death. Methods 867 community-dwelling older adults without mobility disability or parkinsonism at baseline were examined annually. Mobility disability was based on annual measured gait speed. Parkinsonism was based on the annual assessment of 26 items from the motor portion of the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale. A multistate Cox model simultaneously examined the incidences of mobility disability and parkinsonism and their associations with death. Results Average age at baseline was 75 years old and 318 (37%) died during 10 years of follow-up. Mobility disability was almost 2-fold more common than parkinsonism. Some participants developed mobility disability alone (42%), or parkinsonism alone (5%), while many developed both (41%). Individuals with mobility disability or parkinsonism alone had an increased risk of death, but their risk was less than the risk in individuals with both impairments. The risk of death did not depend on the order in which impairments occurred. Conclusion The varied patterns of transitions from no motor impairment to motor impairment highlights the heterogeneity of late-life motor impairment and its contribution to survival. Further studies are needed to elucidate the underlying biology of these different transitions and how they might impact survival."
https://openalex.org/W3126366494,"Purpose Overall survival (OS) is the most significant endpoint for evaluation of treatment benefit with checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) in cancer. We evaluated serum C-reactive protein (CRP) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) trials with atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1) as an early OS surrogate. Methods Serum from patients enrolled in randomized Phase II (n = 240) and Phase III (n = 701) trials of NSCLC patients (POPLAR, OAK) who progressed on prior-platinum chemotherapy, were analyzed for CRP levels over time. Patients were grouped by changes in CRP levels post-treatment as either increased (≥ 1.5 fold), decreased (≤ 1.5 fold) or unchanged (within +1.5 fold) relative to pre-treatment levels to assess association with progression free survival (PFS) and OS. Results Decrease in serum CRP levels at 6 weeks relative to pre-treatment were observed in patients with RECIST1.1 based complete or partial responses (CR/PR) to atezolizumab whereas patients with disease progression (PD) demonstrated an increase in CRP levels in the Phase II POPLAR study, and confirmed in the Phase III OAK study. Decrease in serum CRP as early as six weeks post treatment predicted improved PFS and OS, even in patients who were determined as stable disease (SD) in their first scan. This effect was not observed in the chemotherapy arms. Conclusion Modulation of serum CRP correlates with clinical outcome post-atezolizumab treatment. This routine lab test may provide utility in informing OS signals as early as 6 weeks post-initiation of therapy with CPIs in NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W3126499782,"Background The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Mellow Babies (MB) in the UK. MB is a 14-week early parenting intervention program that is delivered in groups and is targeted at ‘at-risk’ parents (both mothers and fathers) and their babies up to 18 months old. Method The study used a pragmatic pre-post intervention design. Outcomes were parental mental health, parenting confidence, quality of life, socio-emotional development of children, and perceived parent-child relationship. Fifteen groups representing n = 91 parent-baby dyads were recruited across the UK between 2017–2018. The sample consisted of 10 Mellow Mums groups (70 mother-baby dyads) and 5 Mellow Dads groups (21 father-baby dyads). Intention-to-treat and ‘completer’ analyses were performed. Results Findings suggest short-term positive outcomes for parents attending MB. Completion of the program was associated with significant improvements in anxiety and overall wellbeing, parenting confidence, and perceived closeness of the parent-child relationship. The significance of these improvements, except for parenting confidence, was maintained in the intention-to-treat analysis. MB engaged and retained a high proportion of parents who could be considered ‘at-risk’ and benefitted fathers and mothers attending the intervention equally. Conclusions This is the first prospective study to explore MB participation for both mothers and fathers and to indicate engagement and potential benefits specifically for ‘at-risk’ parents. Findings further demonstrate the effectiveness of MB as an early intervention program for parents experiencing psychosocial difficulties. Replication by studies using a contrast or control group also incorporating follow-up data would further improve the evidence base for MB."
https://openalex.org/W3127581707,"Background Familial dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is typically a monogenic disorder with dominant inheritance. Although over 40 genes have been linked to DCM, more than half of the patients undergoing comprehensive genetic testing are left without molecular diagnosis. Recently, biallelic protein-truncating variants (PTVs) in the nebulin-related anchoring protein gene ( NRAP ) were identified in a few patients with sporadic DCM. Methods and results We determined the frequency of rare NRAP variants in a cohort of DCM patients and control patients to further evaluate role of this gene in cardiomyopathies. A retrospective analysis of our internal variant database consisting of 31,639 individuals who underwent genetic testing (either panel or direct exome sequencing) was performed. The DCM group included 577 patients with either a confirmed or suspected DCM diagnosis. A control cohort of 31,062 individuals, including 25,912 individuals with non-cardiac (control group) and 5,150 with non-DCM cardiac indications (Non-DCM cardiac group). Biallelic (n = 6) or two (n = 5) NRAP variants (two PTVs or PTV+missense) were identified in 11 unrelated probands with DCM (1.9%) but none of the controls. None of the 11 probands had an alternative molecular diagnosis. Family member testing supports co-segregation. Biallelic or potentially biallelic NRAP variants were enriched in DCM vs. controls (OR 1052, p&lt;0.0001). Based on the frequency of NRAP PTVs in the gnomAD reference population, and predicting full penetrance, biallelic NRAP variants could explain 0.25%-2.46% of all DCM cases. Conclusion Loss-of-function in NRAP is a cause for autosomal recessive dilated cardiomyopathy, supporting its inclusion in comprehensive genetic testing."
https://openalex.org/W3127609536,"A coronavirus pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has spread rapidly worldwide since December 2019. Improved understanding and new strategies to cope with novel coronaviruses are urgently needed. Viruses (especially RNA viruses) encode a limited number and size (length of polypeptide chain) of viral proteins and must interact with the host cell components to control (hijack) the host cell machinery. To achieve this goal, the extensive mimicry of SLiMs in host proteins provides an effective strategy. However, little is known regarding SLiMs in coronavirus proteins and their potential targets in host cells. The objective of this study is to uncover SLiMs in coronavirus proteins that are present within host cells. These SLiMs have a high possibility of interacting with host intracellular proteins and hijacking the host cell machinery for virus replication and dissemination. In total, 1,479 SLiM hits were identified in the 16 proteins of 590 coronaviruses infecting humans. Overall, 106 host proteins were identified that may interact with SLiMs in 16 coronavirus proteins. These SLiM-interacting proteins are composed of many intracellular key regulators, such as receptors, transcription factors and kinases, and may have important contributions to virus replication, immune evasion and viral pathogenesis. A total of 209 pathways containing proteins that may interact with SLiMs in coronavirus proteins were identified. This study uncovers potential mechanisms by which coronaviruses hijack the host cell machinery. These results provide potential therapeutic targets for viral infections."

Methods 165 Indigenous and 165 White patients matched for the KTx year at Mayo Clinic Arizona from 2007–2015 were studied over a median follow-up of 3 years. Propensity score was calculated to account for baseline differences. Results Compared to Whites, Indigenous patients had the following characteristics: younger age, more obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and required dialysis prior to KTx (p&lt;0.01). Indigenous patients had longer hospital stay for KTx, shorter follow-up and lived further from the transplant center (p&lt;0.05). 210 (63.6%) received deceased donor KTx and more Whites received a living donor KTx compared to Indigenous patients (55.2% vs 17.6%, p&lt;0.0001). Post-KTx, there was no difference in the CV event rates. The cumulative incidence of infectious complications was higher among the Indigenous patients (HR 1.81, p = 0.0005, 48.5% vs 38.2%, p = 0.013), with urinary causes as the most common. Malignancy rates were increased among Whites (13.3% vs 3.0%, p = 0.001) with skin cancer being the most common. There was a significant increase in the dose normalized tacrolimus level for the Indigenous patients compared to Whites at 1 months, 3 months, and 1 year post-KTx. After adjustment for the propensity score, there was no statistical difference in infectious or graft outcomes between the two groups but the mean number of emergency room visits and hospitalizations after KTx was significantly higher for Whites compared to Indigenous patients. Conclusions Compared to Whites, Indigenous patients have similar CV events, graft outcomes and infectious complications after accounting for baseline differences."

In onboard vessel systems, the radiation pattern can be much different than the one obtained for an isolated antenna (because of the vessel’s structure and other nearby radiating systems interference). Finding out the onboard antenna’s radiation pattern is a well-known problem for any shipbuilder/owner. The conventional method consists of measuring radiation patterns from a fixed antenna on the coast while the ship is navigating in circles. Recent electronic systems in the market now allow for an alternative method: keeping the ship static while an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) circles it, measuring the antenna’s transmitted power. This research paper examines the airspace volume and optimal flight path of an off-the-shelf UAV system for measuring the onboard antenna’s radiation pattern in the presence of physical constraints such as the vessel’s dimensions, safety zone, distance to base, Fresnel’s and multipath distances, and considering the loss due to polarization decoupling between the antenna under test and UAV’s antenna."
https://openalex.org/W3128271149,"Human activities that fragment fish habitat have isolated inland salmonid populations. This isolation is associated with loss of migratory life histories and declines in population density and abundance. Isolated populations exhibiting only resident life histories may be more likely to persist if individuals can increase lifetime reproductive success by maturing at smaller sizes or earlier ages. Therefore, accurate estimates of age and size at maturity across resident salmonid populations would improve estimates of population viability. Commonly used methods for assessing maturity such as dissection, endoscopy and hormone analysis are invasive and may disturb vulnerable populations. Ultrasound imaging is a non-invasive method that has been used to measure reproductive status across fish taxa. However, little research has assessed the accuracy of ultrasound for determining maturation status of small-bodied fish, or reproductive potential early in a species’ reproductive cycle. To address these knowledge gaps, we tested whether ultrasound imaging could be used to identify maturing female Westslope Cutthroat Trout ( Oncorhynchus clarkii lewisi ). Our methods were accurate at identifying maturing females reared in a hatchery setting up to eight months prior to spawning, with error rates ≤ 4.0%; accuracy was greater for larger fish. We also imaged fish in a field setting to examine variation in the size of maturing females among six wild, resident populations of Westslope Cutthroat Trout in western Montana. The median size of maturing females varied significantly across populations. We observed oocyte development in females as small as 109 mm, which is smaller than previously documented for this species. Methods tested in this study will allow researchers and managers to collect information on reproductive status of small-bodied salmonids without disrupting fish during the breeding season. This information can help elucidate life history traits that promote persistence of isolated salmonid populations."

So far, only two strains of this bacterium have been sequenced, and very little is known about its patterns of genetic diversity. Understanding genetic variability of this pathogen is essential to implement conservation programs for their threatened, long-lived hosts. We used next generation sequencing to explore the genomic diversity of 86 cultured samples of M . agassizii collected from mostly healthy Mojave and Sonoran desert tortoises in 2011 and 2012. All samples with enough sequencing coverage exhibited a higher similarity to M . agassizii strain PS6 T (collected in Las Vegas Valley, Nevada) than to strain 723 (collected in Sanibel Island, Florida). All eight genomes with a sequencing coverage over 2x were subjected to multiple analyses to detect single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Strikingly, even though we detected 1373 SNPs between strains PS6 T and 723, we did not detect any SNP between PS6 T and our eight samples. Our whole genome analyses reveal that M . agassizii strain PS6 T may be present across a wide geographic extent in healthy Mojave and Sonoran desert tortoises."
https://openalex.org/W3128939902,"Effective green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) design requires comprehensive quantification of the volume of water that can be treated or removed over a given time period. It is recognized that evapotranspiration (ET) can be a substantial pathway for stormwater volume reduction in bioretention systems. However, measuring ET is often difficult and expensive, such as with lysimeters or a mass balance approach. This research focused on a new technique for quantifying ET in bioretention systems by exploring an approach using thermal imaging to calculate ET by measuring the flux of energy at the canopy surface. This thermal imaging approach was compared to ET measurements given by a traditional mass balance approach. The experimental setup had three benchtop scale vegetated lysimeters planted with Switchgrass. Time lapse thermal images of the Switchgrass plants were taken at 10 second intervals and paired with meteorological data. The data were used in an energy balance to estimate the mass of water lost from the lysimeter plant/soil system. That mass was compared to the change in weight measured by weighing the lysimeter before and after the data collection period. For comparison, reference ET was also calculated for the vegetated systems using three common reference ET equations. The uncalibrated energy balance equation developed here estimated an averaged ET over 12 data collection days within 1 mm of the mass balance measured ET. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using a thermal image energy balance technique to estimate ET."

In this environment, obtaining a quantitative grasp of heterogeneous interactions of firms and customers, which have attracted interest of management scientists and economists, requires the analysis of extremely high-dimensional data. Existing approaches in quantitative research could not handle such data without any reliable prior knowledge nor strong assumptions. Alternatively, we propose a novel method called complex Hilbert principal component analysis (CHPCA) and construct a synchronization network using Hodge decomposition. CHPCA enables us to extract significant comovements with a time lead/delay in the data, and Hodge decomposition is useful for identifying the time-structure of correlations. We apply this method to the Japanese beer market data and reveal comovement of variables related to the consumer choice process across multiple products. Furthermore, we find remarkable customer heterogeneity by calculating the coordinates of each customer in the space derived from the results of CHPCA. Lastly, we discuss the policy and managerial implications, limitations, and further development of the proposed method."

This study investigates an innovative way to present content to be explored by touch. Following embodied approaches and evidence about the advantages of manipulations in tactile processing, we examined 3D miniatures that children explored using their middle and index fingers to simulate leg movements. This “Action simulations by finger gestures–ASFG” procedure has a symbolic relevance in the context of blindness. The aim of the present study was to show how the ASFG procedure facilitates the identification of objects by blind and sighted children. Experiment 1 examined the identification of 3D miniatures of action objects (e.g. the toboggan, trampoline) by 8 early blind and 15 sighted children, aged 7 to 12, who explored with the ASFG procedure. Results revealed that objects were very well identified by the two groups of children. Results confirmed hypotheses that ASFG procedures are relevant in the identification process regardless of the visual status of subjects. Experiment (control) 2 studied identification of tactile pictures of same action objects by 8 different early blind and 15 sighted children, aged 7 to 12. Results confirmed that almost all objects obtained lower recognition scores in tactile pictures than in 3D miniatures by both groups and showed surprisingly higher scores in blind children than in sighted children. Taken together, our study provides evidence of the contribution of sensorimotor simulation in the identification of objects by touch and brings innovative solutions in book design for blind people. Moreover, it means that only the ASFG procedure has a very inclusive potential to be relevant for a larger number of subjects, regardless of their visual skills."

The most widely used self-report instrument for assessing CF is the Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire–7 (CFQ-7), a unidimensional scale with good reliability and validity. However, its psychometric properties have been studied mainly in non-clinical samples and by applying Classical Test Theory. The goal of this study was to use Item Response Theory to investigate the adequacy of the scale in a non-clinical sample and to test measurement invariance across non-clinical and clinical psychological samples. The non-clinical sample consisted of 258 undergraduate students (68.2% females, Mage = 24.3), while the clinical sample consisted of 105 undergraduate students with psychological distress (60.7% females, Mage = 23.8). The results showed that CFQ-7 assesses a wide range of CF severity among non-clinical subjects and that it is useful to discriminate different levels of CF. Moreover, the results showed the scale was sufficiently informative for a broad range of the trait. The relationships of CFQ-7 scores with theoretically related constructs provided further support to the validity of the scale. The Differential Item Functioning analysis showed that CFQ-7 is invariant across different types of population. Overall, findings in this study provide support for the adequacy of the CFQ-7 both in non-clinical and clinical contexts."
https://openalex.org/W3128625243,"The paradigm for compartment models in epidemiology assumes exponentially distributed incubation and removal times, which is not realistic in actual populations. Commonly used variations with multiple exponentially distributed variables are more flexible, yet do not allow for arbitrary distributions. We present a new formulation, focussing on the SEIR concept that allows to include general distributions of incubation and removal times. We compare the solution to two types of agent-based model simulations, a spatially homogeneous one where infection occurs by proximity, and a model on a scale-free network with varying clustering properties, where the infection between any two agents occurs via their link if it exists. We find good agreement in both cases. Furthermore a family of asymptotic solutions of the equations is found in terms of a logistic curve, which after a non-universal time shift, fits extremely well all the microdynamical simulations. The formulation allows for a simple numerical approach; software in Julia and Python is provided."
https://openalex.org/W3095914676,"Objective To quantify the effect of inhaled 5% carbon-dioxide/95% oxygen on EEG recordings from patients in non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). Methods Five children of mixed aetiology in NCSE were given high flow of inhaled carbogen (5% carbon dioxide/95% oxygen) using a face mask for maximum 120s. EEG was recorded concurrently in all patients. The effects of inhaled carbogen on patient EEG recordings were investigated using band-power, functional connectivity and graph theory measures. Carbogen effect was quantified by measuring effect size (Cohen’s d) between “before”, “during” and “after” carbogen delivery states. Results Carbogen’s apparent effect on EEG band-power and network metrics across all patients for “before-during” and “before-after” inhalation comparisons was inconsistent across the five patients. Conclusion The changes in different measures suggest a potentially non-homogeneous effect of carbogen on the patients’ EEG. Different aetiology and duration of the inhalation may underlie these non-homogeneous effects. Tuning the carbogen parameters (such as ratio between CO 2 and O 2 , duration of inhalation) on a personalised basis may improve seizure suppression in future."

Methods We conducted a retrospective comparative study by reviewing the medical records of women with severe preeclampsia at ≤ 26 +0 weeks, from January 2010 to June 2018, in two centers: Hospital das Clínicas da Faculdade de Medicina, in Sao Paulo, Brazil (where medical abortion is forbidden in this indication) and Hôpital Antoine-Béclère, Clamart, France (where medical termination is accepted). We collected information on maternal characteristics, laboratory tests, maternal complications and fetal and newborn characteristics. We used Student’s t-test and the Mann-Whitney U nonparametric test to compare quantitative variables, and Chi-square test or Fisher's exact test to evaluate the associations between the qualitative variables. Results There was no between-group difference in maternal complications during hospitalization (p = 0.846). In Brazil, the rate of cesarean section was 66.7%, and 20% of patients had vertical incision. The rate of spontaneous fetal death was 35.6% and among the live-born infants 26.6% were discharged from hospital. In France, one patient had a cesarean section with vertical incision. Conclusion When comparing termination of pregnancy to expectant management in severe preeclampsia before 26 weeks, maternal complications were equivalent but maternal reproductive future might have been compromised in 20% of cases due to a higher risk of uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies for patients having classic cesarean (vertical incision). 26.6% of children survived the neonatal period when pregnancy was pursued, however we lack information on their long-term follow-up."
https://openalex.org/W3127483629,"Split fluorescent proteins have wide applicability as biosensors for protein-protein interactions, genetically encoded tags for protein detection and localization, as well as fusion partners in super-resolution microscopy. We have here established and validated a novel platform for functional analysis of leave-one-out split fluorescent proteins (LOO-FPs) in high throughput and with rapid turnover. We have screened more than 12,000 variants of the beta-strand split fragment using high-density peptide microarrays for binding and functional complementation in Green Fluorescent Protein. We studied the effect of peptide length and the effect of different linkers to the solid support. We further mapped the effect of all possible amino acid substitutions on each position as well as in the context of some single and double amino acid substitutions. As all peptides were tested in 12 duplicates, the analysis rests on a firm statistical basis allowing for confirmation of the robustness and precision of the method. Based on experiments in solution, we conclude that under the given conditions, the signal intensity on the peptide microarray faithfully reflects the binding affinity between the split fragments. With this, we are able to identify a peptide with 9-fold higher affinity than the starting peptide."
https://openalex.org/W3127149403,"We theorize that individuals’ pre-existing beliefs about the hiring manager role (role construal) are associated with their tendency to condone bias accommodation in hiring contexts, in which a person aligns hiring decisions with the perceived biases of others. In two studies, we focus on human resources (HR) professionals’ endorsement of the role demand to prioritize candidate fit with others (e.g., supervisor) when making hiring decisions. Study 1 examined bias accommodation from a vicarious perspective, revealing that role demand endorsement is positively associated with viewing it as acceptable and common for another hiring manager to accommodate third-party bias against women. Study 2 examined bias accommodation experimentally from an actor’s perspective, showing lower preference for and selection of a female (vs. male) job candidate in the presence of cues to third-party bias against women, but only when role demand endorsement is relatively high. HR professionals in both studies indicated that third-party bias influences in hiring are relatively common. Responses in Study 2 provide preliminary evidence that the phenomenon of third-party bias accommodation might be relevant in the context of employment discrimination based on group characteristics other than gender (e.g., race/ethnicity, age). We discuss the practical implications of our findings for hiring professionals and for organizations seeking to increase diversity in their workforce."
