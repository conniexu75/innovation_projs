https://openalex.org/W2101749257,"The genetic interrogation and reprogramming of cells requires methods for robust and precise targeting of genes for expression or repression. The CRISPR-associated catalytically inactive dCas9 protein offers a general platform for RNA-guided DNA targeting. Here, we show that fusion of dCas9 to effector domains with distinct regulatory functions enables stable and efficient transcriptional repression or activation in human and yeast cells, with the site of delivery determined solely by a coexpressed short guide (sg)RNA. Coupling of dCas9 to a transcriptional repressor domain can robustly silence expression of multiple endogenous genes. RNA-seq analysis indicates that CRISPR interference (CRISPRi)-mediated transcriptional repression is highly specific. Our results establish that the CRISPR system can be used as a modular and flexible DNA-binding platform for the recruitment of proteins to a target DNA sequence, revealing the potential of CRISPRi as a general tool for the precise regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2166123725,"Genome sequencing enhances our understanding of the biological world by providing blueprints for the evolutionary and functional diversity that shapes the biosphere. However, microbial genomes that are currently available are of limited phylogenetic breadth, owing to our historical inability to cultivate most microorganisms in the laboratory. We apply single-cell genomics to target and sequence 201 uncultivated archaeal and bacterial cells from nine diverse habitats belonging to 29 major mostly uncharted branches of the tree of life, so-called ‘microbial dark matter’. With this additional genomic information, we are able to resolve many intra- and inter-phylum-level relationships and to propose two new superphyla. We uncover unexpected metabolic features that extend our understanding of biology and challenge established boundaries between the three domains of life. These include a novel amino acid use for the opal stop codon, an archaeal-type purine synthesis in Bacteria and complete sigma factors in Archaea similar to those in Bacteria. The single-cell genomes also served to phylogenetically anchor up to 20% of metagenomic reads in some habitats, facilitating organism-level interpretation of ecosystem function. This study greatly expands the genomic representation of the tree of life and provides a systematic step towards a better understanding of biological evolution on our planet. Uncultivated archaeal and bacterial cells of major uncharted branches of the tree of life are targeted and sequenced using single-cell genomics; this enables resolution of many intra- and inter-phylum-level relationships, uncovers unexpected metabolic features that challenge established boundaries between the three domains of life, and leads to the proposal of two new superphyla. Currently available genome sequences give us a narrow view of the remarkable diversity of microorganisms because the vast majority of them have never been cultivated in pure culture. Here Tanja Woyke and colleagues use single-cell genomics to target and sequence 201 uncultivated archaeal and bacterial cells from nine diverse habitats. This information reveals numerous intra- and inter-phylum relationships and a number of unexpected metabolic features. On the basis of the new data the authors propose taxonomic revisions to the archaeal and bacterial domains, including a proposal to reorganizing the Archaea into three superphyla."
https://openalex.org/W2044686992,"Earthquakes in unusual locations have become an important topic of discussion in both North America and Europe, owing to the concern that industrial activity could cause damaging earthquakes. It has long been understood that earthquakes can be induced by impoundment of reservoirs, surface and underground mining, withdrawal of fluids and gas from the subsurface, and injection of fluids into underground formations. Injection-induced earthquakes have, in particular, become a focus of discussion as the application of hydraulic fracturing to tight shale formations is enabling the production of oil and gas from previously unproductive formations. Earthquakes can be induced as part of the process to stimulate the production from tight shale formations, or by disposal of wastewater associated with stimulation and production. Here, I review recent seismic activity that may be associated with industrial activity, with a focus on the disposal of wastewater by injection in deep wells; assess the scientific understanding of induced earthquakes; and discuss the key scientific challenges to be met for assessing this hazard."

https://openalex.org/W2049959255,"Cancer Hits a Nerve Solid tumors sculpt their microenvironment to maximize their growth and metastatic potential. This concept is illustrated most famously by tumor angiogenesis, a process whereby tumors induce the growth of new blood vessels to boost their supply of oxygen and blood-borne nutrients. Magnon et al. (p. 10.1126/science.1236361 ; see the Perspective by Isaacs ) now highlight the important contribution made by another microenvironmental component—developing autonomic nerve fibers—to tumor growth and metastasis. In mouse models of prostate cancer, surgical or chemical destruction of sympathetic nerves prevented early-stage growth of tumors, whereas pharmacological inhibition of parasympathetic nerves inhibited tumor dissemination. In a small study of human prostate cancer specimens, the presence of a high density of nerve fibers in and around the tumor tissue was found to correlate with poor clinical outcome. These results raise the possibility that drugs targeting the autonomic nervous system may have therapeutic potential for prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2166984808,"Folate receptors (FRα, FRβ and FRγ) are cysteine-rich cell-surface glycoproteins that bind folate with high affinity to mediate cellular uptake of folate. Although expressed at very low levels in most tissues, folate receptors, especially FRα, are expressed at high levels in numerous cancers to meet the folate demand of rapidly dividing cells under low folate conditions. The folate dependency of many tumours has been therapeutically and diagnostically exploited by administration of anti-FRα antibodies, high-affinity antifolates, folate-based imaging agents and folate-conjugated drugs and toxins. To understand how folate binds its receptors, we determined the crystal structure of human FRα in complex with folic acid at 2.8 Å resolution. FRα has a globular structure stabilized by eight disulphide bonds and contains a deep open folate-binding pocket comprised of residues that are conserved in all receptor subtypes. The folate pteroate moiety is buried inside the receptor, whereas its glutamate moiety is solvent-exposed and sticks out of the pocket entrance, allowing it to be conjugated to drugs without adversely affecting FRα binding. The extensive interactions between the receptor and ligand readily explain the high folate-binding affinity of folate receptors and provide a template for designing more specific drugs targeting the folate receptor system."

Targeting this pathological interplay could represent a novel avenue for treatment of MPN-affected patients and prevention of myelofibrosis. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) sustain the life-long production of all types of mature blood cells (Orkin and Zon, 2008Orkin S.H. Zon L.I. Hematopoiesis: an evolving paradigm for stem cell biology.Cell. 2008; 132: 631-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). At steady state, HSCs primarily reside in the bone marrow (BM) cavity, where they interact with different types of stromal cells expressing important regulatory molecules including stem cell factor (SCF), C-X-C motif chemokine 12 (CXCL12, also called SDF1α), and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) (Frenette et al., 2013Frenette P.S.

Immunol. 2013; 31: 285-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Although early mouse studies implicated mature bone-forming osteoblasts (Calvi et al., 2003Calvi L.M. Adams G.B. Weibrecht K.W. Weber J.M. Olson D.P. Knight M.C. Martin R.P. Schipani E. Divieti P. Bringhurst F.R. et al.Osteoblastic cells regulate the haematopoietic stem cell niche.Nature. 2003; 425: 841-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (2806) Google Scholar), recent work has refined the identity of HSC-supportive cells to several populations of multipotent stromal cells (MSCs) and their early osteoblastic lineage cell (OBC) derivatives. Both Runx2-expressing OBCs (Chitteti et al., 2010Chitteti B.R. Cheng Y.H. Streicher D.A. Rodriguez-Rodriguez S. Carlesso N. Srour E.F.

Sugiyama T. Kohara H. Kondoh G. Fujii N. Kohno K. Nagasawa T.

Saunders T.L. Enikolopov G. Morrison S.J. Endothelial and perivascular cells maintain haematopoietic stem cells.Nature. 2012; 481: 457-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1316) Google Scholar) have been shown to be important for HSC maintenance. However, not all MSC derivatives have HSC-supportive activity, and, in fact, mature adipocytes negatively impact HSC function (Naveiras et al., 2009Naveiras O. Nardi V. Wenzel P.L. Hauschka P.V. Fahey F. Daley G.Q. Bone-marrow adipocytes as negative regulators of the haematopoietic microenvironment.Nature. 2009; 460: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Other known HSC-supporting BM niche cells include endothelial cells (ECs) (Doan and Chute, 2012Doan P.L. Chute J.P. The vascular niche: home for normal and malignant hematopoietic stem cells.Leukemia. 2012; 26: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and ectodermally derived nonmyelinating Schwann cells (Yamazaki et al., 2011Yamazaki S. Ema H. Karlsson G. Yamaguchi T. Miyoshi H. Shioda S. Taketo M.M. Karlsson S. Iwama A. Nakauchi H. Nonmyelinating Schwann cells maintain hematopoietic stem cell hibernation in the bone marrow niche.Cell. 2011; 147: 1146-1158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar). Therefore, the emerging picture of the HSC BM niche is a complex array of regulatory cell types with a predominant role for MSCs and their early OBC derivatives in forming both perivascular end endosteal BM niches that maintain HSCs and regulate blood production. Deregulation of HSC activity is an important step in the development of myeloid malignancies (Passegué et al., 2003Passegué E. Jamieson C.H.M. Ailles L.E. Weissman I.L. Normal and leukemic hematopoiesis: are leukemias a stem cell disorder or a reacquisition of stem cell characteristics?.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 11842-11849Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar). This is particularly the case for myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), a class of clonal disorders that are propagated by leukemic stem cells (LSCs) arising from transformed HSCs and carrying oncogenic lesions such as BCR/ABL for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) or activating Jak2 mutations for polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythosis, and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) (Van Etten and Shannon, 2004Van Etten R.A.

Gilliland D.G. Myeloproliferative disorders.Blood. 2008; 112: 2190-2198Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Deregulation of the BM microenvironment is another important factor in the development of myeloid malignancies (Lane et al., 2009Lane S.W. Scadden D.T. Gilliland D.G. The leukemic stem cell niche: current concepts and therapeutic opportunities.Blood. 2009; 114: 1150-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Genetic ablation of the retinoic acid receptor γ (Rar-γ) or retinoblastoma (Rb) genes in BM stromal cells promotes MPN development (Walkley et al., 2007aWalkley C.R. Olsen G.H. Dworkin S. Fabb S.A.

Rb regulates interactions between hematopoietic stem cells and their bone marrow microenvironment.Cell. 2007; 129: 1081-1095Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), whereas inactivation of the microRNA-processing enzyme dicer in immature osterix (Osx)-expressing osteoprogenitors causes myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (Raaijmakers et al., 2010Raaijmakers M.H. Mukherjee S. Guo S. Zhang S. Kobayashi T. Schoonmaker J.A. Ebert B.L. Al-Shahrour F. Hasserjian R.P. Scadden E.O. et al.Bone progenitor dysfunction induces myelodysplasia and secondary leukaemia.Nature. 2010; 464: 852-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). In addition, changes in the signaling activity of OBCs can alter HSC numbers and cause lineage-specific defects in blood production (Schepers et al., 2012Schepers K. Hsiao E.C. Garg T. Scott M.J. Passegué E. Activated Gs signaling in osteoblastic cells alters the hematopoietic stem cell niche in mice.Blood. 2012; 120: 3425-3435Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that myeloid malignancies also affect the function of the BM microenvironment. In particular, decreased expression of Cxcl12 by BM stromal cells is observed in chronic-phase CML (Zhang et al., 2012Zhang B. Ho Y.W. Huang Q. Maeda T. Lin A. Lee S.U. Hair A. Holyoake T.L. Huettner C. Bhatia R. Altered microenvironmental regulation of leukemic and normal stem cells in chronic myelogenous leukemia.Cancer Cell. 2012; 21: 577-592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), thereby impairing support for normal HSCs, whereas severe osteoblastic defects are found in blast-crisis CML, leading to a major loss of bone (Frisch et al., 2012Frisch B.J. Ashton J.M. Xing L. Becker M.W. Jordan C.T. Calvi L.M. Functional inhibition of osteoblastic cells in an in vivo mouse model of myeloid leukemia.Blood. 2012; 119: 540-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, much remains to be understood about how leukemic hematopoiesis impacts the BM microenvironment and, in turn, how changes in the activity of specific BM niche cells contribute to MPN pathogenesis. Here, we use an inducible Scl-tTA::TRE-BCR/ABL double-transgenic mouse model of human chronic-phase CML (Reynaud et al., 2011Reynaud D. Pietras E. Barry-Holson K. Mir A. Binnewies M. Jeanne M. Sala-Torra O. Radich J.P. Passegué E. IL-6 controls leukemic multipotent progenitor cell fate and contributes to chronic myelogenous leukemia development.Cancer Cell. 2011; 20: 661-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) to investigate the effect of MPN development on the endosteal BM niche. Several flow cytometry approaches have been developed for identifying endosteum-associated BM stromal cells. Here, we used a previously described protocol to isolate ECs (Lin−/CD45−/CD31+/Sca-1+), MSCs (Lin−/CD45−/CD31−/CD51+/Sca-1+), and OBCs (Lin−/CD45−/CD31−/CD51+/Sca-1−) from hematopoietic cell-depleted, collagenase-treated crushed bones of wild-type (WT) mice (Figures 1A and 1B ) (Winkler et al., 2010Winkler I.G. Sims N.A. Pettit A.R. Barbier V. Nowlan B. Helwani F. Poulton I.J. van Rooijen N. Alexander K.A. Raggatt L.J. Lévesque J.P. Bone marrow macrophages maintain hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niches and their depletion mobilizes HSCs.Blood. 2010; 116: 4815-4828Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). In vitro characterization of these populations showed the expected high frequency of colony-forming unit fibroblast (CFU-F) activity and platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα) levels in MSCs (Figures S1A and S1B available online). In contrast, OBCs had lower CFU-F frequencies and PDGFRα levels, whereas ECs lacked PDGFRα expression and were devoid of CFU-F activity. Consistent with their lineage relationship, both MSCs and OBCs produced alkaline-phosphatase-positive colonies and von Kossa-positive bone nodules upon osteoblastic differentiation, with MSCs giving rise to larger colonies than their OBC derivatives ( Figure S1A). These results confirm reliable enrichment of endosteal MSCs and their OBC derivatives using this flow-cytometry protocol. We then used GFP reporter mice to determine the relationship between endosteal subsets and BM niche cells with demonstrated HSC-supportive activity. Strikingly, we found the presence of Osx+ osteoprogenitors, CXCL12hi CAR cells, and Nes+ MSC-like cells within the OBC fraction (Figures 1C and 1D), with frequencies ranging from ∼10% in Osx-gfp and Cxcl12-gfp mice to ∼70% in Nes-gfp mice (Figure 1E). As expected, we also found that ∼35% of the MSC fraction was GFP+ in Nes-gfp mice (Méndez-Ferrer et al., 2010Méndez-Ferrer S. Michurina T.V. Ferraro F. Mazloom A.R. Macarthur B.D. Lira S.A. Scadden D.T. Ma’ayan A. Enikolopov G.N. Frenette P.S. Mesenchymal and haematopoietic stem cells form a unique bone marrow niche.Nature. 2010; 466: 829-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (2484) Google Scholar), whereas less than 1% was GFP+/hi in either Osx-gfp or Cxcl12-gfp mice (Figure 1E). Additional flow-cytometry analyses of stromal versus hematopoietic BM cells (Figure S1C) and immunofluorescence analyses of bone sections (Figure S1D) confirmed that most Osx-GFP+ cells were located at the bone surface, whereas Cxcl12-GFPhi and Nes-GFP+ cells were found both at the bone surface and throughout the BM cavity. These results indicate that the endosteal OBC fraction contains some of the previously described HSC niche cells. To confirm that endosteal OBCs are able to maintain HSCs, we performed short-term in vitro coculture experiments wherein 500 WT HSCs (Lin−/c-Kit+/Sca-1+/Flk2−/CD150+/CD48−) were grown for 4 days with or without 2,000 purified OBCs (Figure 1F). As expected, HSCs cocultured with OBCs showed more in vitro hematopoietic expansion and higher myeloid differentiation potential in methylcellulose than HSCs cultured on plastic (Figure 1G). Mice transplanted with the progeny of 500 HSCs cocultured with OBCs also displayed significantly higher levels of donor chimerism than mice receiving cells cultured without OBCs (Figure 1H). However, the chimerism level was still lower than in mice transplanted with 500 freshly isolated WT HSCs, indicating that OBCs were primarily maintaining HSC function without increasing their numbers. In all cases, we observed similar multilineage reconstitution (data not shown). These results directly demonstrate that phenotypically defined endosteal OBCs have HSC-supporting activity. We then used our inducible Scl-tTA::TRE-BCR/ABL (BA) double-transgenic mouse model of chronic-phase CML (Reynaud et al., 2011Reynaud D. Pietras E. Barry-Holson K. Mir A. Binnewies M. Jeanne M. Sala-Torra O. Radich J.P. Passegué E. IL-6 controls leukemic multipotent progenitor cell fate and contributes to chronic myelogenous leukemia development.Cancer Cell. 2011; 20: 661-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) to address how MPN development affects the endosteal BM niche. We first quantified the numbers of endosteal stromal BM cells in age-matched littermate controls (Ctrl) and primary diseased BA mice, which develop severe granulocytic expansion within 5 to 6 weeks upon doxycycline withdrawal and BCR/ABL induction (Figures 2A and 2B ). Remarkably, we found a large increase in OBC numbers in BA mice, with MSC numbers remaining largely unaffected and EC numbers actually decreasing (Figures 2C and S2A). This OBC expansion was associated with an accumulation of myelofibrotic cells with increased collagen deposition (Figure S2B), as previously reported in both primary BA mice (Reynaud et al., 2011Reynaud D. Pietras E. Barry-Holson K. Mir A. Binnewies M. Jeanne M. Sala-Torra O. Radich J.P. Passegué E. IL-6 controls leukemic multipotent progenitor cell fate and contributes to chronic myelogenous leukemia development.Cancer Cell. 2011; 20: 661-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and human CML-affected patients (Thiele and Kvasnicka, 2006Thiele J. Kvasnicka H.M. Myelofibrosis in chronic myeloproliferative disorders—dynamics and clinical impact.Histol. Histopathol. 2006; 21: 1367-1378PubMed Google Scholar). Although no significant changes in bone mineral density were detected (data not shown), micro-computed-tomography analyses of proximal tibiae revealed increased trabecular thickening of primary and secondary spongiosa and significant expansion of the trabecular bone below the growth plate in BA mice (Figure S2C). Although trabecular numbers and spacing were unchanged, trabeculae were thicker and showed increased connectivity (Figure S2D). In contrast, cortical bone formation was unaffected (Figure S2C), and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining showed no qualitative differences in osteoclast numbers between Ctrl and BA mice (Figure S2E). To exclude the possibility that BCR/ABL was expressed in OBCs, we generated Scl-tTA::TetO-H2B-gfp double-transgenic reporter mice (Figure S2F). Whereas some ECs (Lécuyer and Hoang, 2004Lécuyer E. Hoang T. SCL: from the origin of hematopoiesis to stem cells and leukemia.Exp. Hematol. 2004; 32: 11-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and all hematopoietic BM cells including HSCs were GFP+, no cells within the OBC and MSC fractions expressed GFP. This finding indicates that the Scl/Tal-1 3′-enhancer element is not active in endosteal MSCs and OBCs and rules out an intrinsic effect of BCR/ABL expression in these populations. These results demonstrate that MPN development is accompanied by a striking expansion of endosteal OBCs, an increase in trabecular bone formation, and BM fibrosis. To demonstrate that MPN development is directly responsible for the OBC expansion, we transplanted purified HSCs isolated from primary Ctrl and diseased BA mice into sublethally irradiated WT recipients (Figure 2A). Mice that received BA HSCs all developed CML within 3 to 5 months following transplantation (Figure 2D). Remarkably, diseased BA HSC-transplanted WT recipients also showed OBC expansion, which was now accompanied by an increase in MSC numbers and BM fibrosis (Figures 2E and 2F). To test whether MPN-expanded OBCs are involved in myelofibrosis development, we transplanted unfractionated Ctrl or BA BM cells into lethally irradiated Osx-gfp recipients, wherein ∼10% of endosteal OBCs were marked by GFP expression (Figure 1E). Strikingly, diseased BA BM-transplanted Osx-gfp recipients showed accumulation of GFP+ cells in the BM cavity (Figure 2G), which reflected the contribution of MPN-expanded recipient-derived Osx-GFP+ OBCs to the myelofibrotic tissue. Collectively, these results indicate that MPN progressively alters the architecture of the BM microenvironment and directly causes an expansion of endosteal OBCs that, in turn, contribute to BM fibrosis. To understand how MPN development leads to OBC expansion, we developed an in vitro coculture/imaging approach modeling the interactions between hematopoietic and stromal BM populations (Figure 3A). WT MSCs or OBCs were isolated from β-actin-gfp mice and cocultured for up to 10 days with BM cells isolated from Ctrl or BA mice. A combination of manual and software-automated cell counting of fluorescence microscopy images obtained with an IN Cell Analyzer 2000 was then used to determine the number of MSC- or OBC-derived colonies and GFP+ cells per colony. As expected, MSCs cocultured with BM cells showed more numerous colonies than MSCs cultured without hematopoietic cells (0.6 ± 0.7 versus 6.9 ± 3.2 colonies; n = 10; p ≤ 0.001). In these conditions, BA BM cells significantly increased the size of MSC-derived colonies compared to Ctrl BM cells (Figure 3B), without changing the total numbers of colonies (6.9 ± 3.2 versus 6.5 ± 3.6 colonies; n = 10). In contrast, BA BM cells had no effect on the size (Figure 3B) or the number of OBC-derived colonies (3.7 ± 2.5 versus 4.0 ± 1.0 colonies; n = 10), hence demonstrating a specific effect of leukemic hematopoiesis on MSCs. Fluidigm-based gene analyses uncovered no major differences in expression of the cell-cycle machinery in MSCs and OBCs isolated from primary Ctrl and BA mice, besides a significant decrease in Ccnd2 (cyclinD2) and p27 expression in BA populations (Figure S3A). EdU incorporation experiments performed after 7 days of coculture showed that BA BM cells directly increased the proliferation rates of expanding MSC-derived cells (Figures 3C and S3B). Consistent with an enhanced OBC differentiation, MSC-derived cells cocultured for 10 days with BA BM cells also showed a smaller, more rounded osteoblastic-like morphology and increased expression of early osteoblastic differentiation markers as measured by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses (Figures S3C and S3D). However, upon differentiation, MPN-expanded OBCs did not maintain a proliferative state, as shown in vivo by the absence of staining with the proliferation marker Ki67 of recipient-derived Osx-GFP+ OBCs (Figure S3E). These results indicate that MPN BM cells directly stimulate MSCs to overproduce OBC derivatives. We next tested the importance of leukemic myeloid cells for OBC expansion. We first confirmed that mature BA BM cells, rather than immature c-Kit+ stem and progenitor cells, were responsible for the increase in MSC colony size (data not shown). We then used magnetic bead depletion to obtain ≥ 95% Mac-1+ myeloid-enriched BM cells from both Ctrl and BA mice (Figure 3D). Strikingly, we found that myeloid-enriched Ctrl BM cells did not increase MSC colony size in contrast to myeloid-enriched BA BM cells, hence demonstrating the specific involvement of leukemic myeloid cells. To address the reliance of OBC expansion on leukemic myeloid cells, we re-exposed primary diseased BA mice to doxycycline to block BCR/ABL expression and eradicate leukemic myeloid cells (Figure 3E). Following normalization of myeloid counts, we observed a progressive decrease in OBC numbers, with full recovery by 4 months post reinduction, and a quick disappearance of myelofibrosis as early as 2 months post reinduction (Figure 3F). These results are consistent with normal turnover rates of MSCs (Park et al., 2012Park D. Spencer J.A. Koh B.I. Kobayashi T. Fujisaki J. Clemens T.L. Lin C.P. Kronenberg H.M. Scadden D.T. Endogenous bone marrow MSCs are dynamic, fate-restricted participants in bone maintenance and regeneration.Cell Stem Cell. 2012; 10: 259-272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar), and they demonstrate that leukemic myeloid cells are both necessary and sufficient to drive OBC expansion and to remodel the endosteal BM niche. To understand how leukemic myeloid cells stimulate MSCs to overproduce OBC derivatives, we first used Transwell plates to assess the relative contribution of secreted soluble factors versus direct cell-cell interactions. Strikingly, we did not observe a significant increase in MSC colony size when BA BM cells were physically separated from MSCs (Figure 4A). Examination of MSCs cocultured with myeloid-enriched BA BM cells also showed close contacts between the two cell types throughout the culture period (Figure S4A). These findings indicate that direct contacts or close-proximity signals between leukemic myeloid cells and MSCs are important in driving OBC expansion. We then directly tested the effect of candidate factors known to increase osteoblastic differentiation, such as interleukin-6 and interleukin-1β (IL-6 and IL-1β) (Erices et al., 2002Erices A.

Although both IL-6 and IL-1β levels were increased in the serum of primary diseased BA mice (Figure S4A) (Reynaud et al., 2011Reynaud D. Pietras E. Barry-Holson K. Mir A. Binnewies M. Jeanne M.

In addition, OBC expansion and myelofibrosis were still observed in primary BA mice lacking either Il-6 or Il-1r1 genes (Figures S4C and S4D), confirming that MPN-mediated remodeling of the endosteal BM niche was largely independent of the aberrant secretion of these proinflammatory cytokines by leukemic myeloid cells. Among the other factors tested, only TPO increased MSC colony size by itself (Figure 4B). Strikingly, addition of Ctrl BM cells significantly potentiated the effect of TPO and CCL3 on MSC colony size, but did not promote MSC expansion with either TGF-β or G-CSF (Figure 4B). We also confirmed elevated levels of CCL3 and TPO in the BM plasma of primary diseased BA mice and detected a trending increase in CCL3 and G-CSF levels in the supernatant of MSC cocultures with BA BM cells (Figure 4D). These results suggest that TPO and CCL3, in conjunction with direct interactions between MSCs and leukemic myeloid cells, drive the overproduction of OBC derivatives during MPN development. To determine whether MPN-expanded OBCs are functionally altered, we compared the gene expression profiles of OBCs isolated from primary Ctrl and diseased BA mice using Affymetrix Gene ST 1.0 microarrays. Consistent with their identity, both Ctrl and BA OBCs expressed high levels of osteoblast and chondrocyte differentiation markers and low levels of MSC and adipocyte differentiation genes, and they were not contaminated by adherent myeloid cells (Figure S5A). Statistical analysis of microarrays uncovered 610 genes that were differentially expressed between Ctrl and BA OBCs (≥1.5-fold; p ≤ 0.05), with 437 upregulated and 173 downregulated genes (Tables S1 and S2). Gene ontology (GO) analyses of these genes identified processes such as extracellular matrix organization, regulation of cell adhesion, and inflammatory responses as being significantly enriched in BA OBCs (Figure 5A and Table S3). Examination of individual genes showed changes in extracellular matrix components that are relevant for myelofibrosis development, such as increased expression of chitinase (Chi3l1), Spp1, and fibrinogen (Fgg) and decreased expression of several types of collagens (Col), versican proteoglycans (Vcan), laminin glycoproteins (Lamc1), and integrin ligands (Fbln5), as well as increased expression of a whole range of matrix metallopeptidases (Mmp) and ADAM metallopeptidases (Adamts) that are probably important for tissue remodeling (Figure 5B). BA OBCs also displayed changes in integrin (Itg) and cadherin (Cdh) expression levels, as well as a striking upregulation of the IL-1 superfamily of proinflammatory cytokines and many serum amyloids (Saa) (Figure 5B). These results were validated by subsequent qRT-PCR and Fluidigm-based gene expression analyses (Figures S5B and S5C). Importantly, many of the genes upregulated in primary BA OBCs were also upregulated in WT MSC-derived cells cocultured with BA BM cells (Figure S3A), thus confirming that these molecular changes were a direct consequence of exposure to leukemic myeloid cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate the myelofibrotic, proinflammatory nature of MPN-expanded OBCs. We then took advantage of our Fluidigm-based gene expression analyses to investi"
https://openalex.org/W1984077980,"The use of two kinase inhibitors (2i) enables derivation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in the pluripotent ground state. Using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS), we show that male 2i ESCs are globally hypomethylated compared to conventional ESCs maintained in serum. In serum, female ESCs are hypomethyated similarly to male ESCs in 2i, and DNA methylation is further reduced in 2i. Regions with elevated DNA methylation in 2i strongly correlate with the presence of H3K9me3 on endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) and imprinted loci. The methylome of male ESCs in serum parallels postimplantation blastocyst cells, while 2i stalls ESCs in a hypomethylated, ICM-like state. WGBS analysis during adaptation of 2i ESCs to serum suggests that deposition of DNA methylation is largely random, while loss of DNA methylation during reversion to 2i occurs passively, initiating at TET1 binding sites. Together, our analysis provides insight into DNA methylation dynamics in cultured ESCs paralleling early developmental processes."
https://openalex.org/W2167010568,"Genome-wide erasure of DNA methylation takes place in primordial germ cells (PGCs) and early embryos and is linked with pluripotency. Inhibition of Erk1/2 and Gsk3β signaling in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) by small-molecule inhibitors (called 2i) has recently been shown to induce hypomethylation. We show by whole-genome bisulphite sequencing that 2i induces rapid and genome-wide demethylation on a scale and pattern similar to that in migratory PGCs and early embryos. Major satellites, intracisternal A particles (IAPs), and imprinted genes remain relatively resistant to erasure. Demethylation involves oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), impaired maintenance of 5mC and 5hmC, and repression of the de novo methyltransferases (Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b) and Dnmt3L. We identify a Prdm14- and Nanog-binding cis-acting regulatory region in Dnmt3b that is highly responsive to signaling. These insights provide a framework for understanding how signaling pathways regulate reprogramming to an epigenetic ground state of pluripotency."

Moreover, we show that motor cortex activity can drive changes in somatosensory cortex network state. A series of experiments demonstrate the involvement of the direct corticocortical feedback pathway, providing temporally precise and spatially targeted modulation of network dynamics. Cortically mediated changes in network state significantly impact sensory coding, with activated states increasing the reliability of responses to complex stimuli. By influencing network state, corticocortical communication from motor cortex may ensure that during active exploration the relevant sensory region is primed for enhanced sensory discrimination."

To investigate their individual and combinatorial functions, we first sought an in vitro system for transcriptional readouts and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing analysis. We then integrated this data with information from single-cell transcriptome analysis of normal and mutant PGCs. Here we show that BLIMP1 binds directly to repress somatic and cell proliferation genes. It also directly induces AP2γ, which together with PRDM14 initiates the PGC-specific fate. We determined the occupancy of critical genes by AP2γ-which, when computed altogether with those of BLIMP1 and PRDM14 (both individually and cooperatively), reveals a tripartite mutually interdependent transcriptional network for PGCs. We also demonstrate that, in principle, BLIMP1, AP2γ and PRDM14 are sufficient for PGC specification, and the unprecedented resetting of the epigenome towards a basal state."

However, correlations are affected by both direct and indirect paths, confounding our ability to identify true pairwise interactions. Here we exploit the fundamental properties of dynamical correlations in networks to develop a method to silence indirect effects. The method receives as input the observed correlations between node pairs and uses a matrix transformation to turn the correlation matrix into a highly discriminative silenced matrix, which enhances only the terms associated with direct causal links. Against empirical data for Escherichia coli regulatory interactions, the method enhanced the discriminative power of the correlations by twofold, yielding >50% predictive improvement over traditional correlation measures and 6% over mutual information. Overall this silencing method will help translate the abundant correlation data into insights about a system's interactions, with applications ranging from link prediction to inferring the dynamical mechanisms governing biological networks."

We formulate the problem as the inverse of network convolution, and introduce an algorithm that removes the combined effect of all indirect paths of arbitrary length in a closed-form solution by exploiting eigen-decomposition and infinite-series sums. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in several network applications: distinguishing direct targets in gene expression regulatory networks; recognizing directly interacting amino-acid residues for protein structure prediction from sequence alignments; and distinguishing strong collaborations in co-authorship social networks using connectivity information alone. In addition to its theoretical impact as a foundational graph theoretic tool, our results suggest network deconvolution is widely applicable for computing direct dependencies in network science across diverse disciplines."

Notable examples include injection of wastewater into deep formations and emerging technologies related to oil and gas recovery, including hydraulic fracturing. In addition to directly causing increased local seismic activity, activities such as deep fluid injection may have other ramifications related to earthquake occurrence. Van der Elst et al.

Theoretical propositions suggest that one form, unexpected uncertainty, may be used to rapidly adapt to changes in the environment, while being influenced by two other forms: risk and estimation uncertainty. While previous studies have reported neural representations of estimation uncertainty and risk, relatively little is known about unexpected uncertainty. Here, participants performed a decision-making task while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which, in combination with a Bayesian model-based analysis, enabled us to separately examine each form of uncertainty examined. We found representations of unexpected uncertainty in multiple cortical areas, as well as the noradrenergic brainstem nucleus locus coeruleus. Other unique cortical regions were found to encode risk, estimation uncertainty, and learning rate. Collectively, these findings support theoretical models in which several formally separable uncertainty computations determine the speed of learning."

We found that only a small number of lamina output neurons are essential for motion detection, while most neurons serve to sculpt and enhance these feedforward pathways. Two classes of feedback neurons (C2 and C3), and lamina output neurons (L2 and L4), are required for normal detection of directional motion stimuli.

MI was layer and cell type specific, with multisensory enhancement being rare in the major class of inhibitory interneurons and in the output infragranular layers. Optogenetic manipulation of parvalbumin-positive interneuron activity revealed that the scarce MI of interneurons enables MI in neighboring pyramids. Finally, single-cell resolution calcium imaging revealed a gradual merging of modalities: unisensory neurons had higher densities toward the borders of the primary cortices, but were located in unimodal clusters in the middle of the cortical area.

https://openalex.org/W1974183989,"Some evolutionary innovations may originate non-adaptively as exaptations, or pre-adaptations, which are by-products of other adaptive traits. Examples include feathers, which originated before they were used in flight, and lens crystallins, which are light-refracting proteins that originated as enzymes. The question of how often adaptive traits have non-adaptive origins has profound implications for evolutionary biology, but is difficult to address systematically. Here we consider this issue in metabolism, one of the most ancient biological systems that is central to all life. We analyse a metabolic trait of great adaptive importance: the ability of a metabolic reaction network to synthesize all biomass from a single source of carbon and energy. We use novel computational methods to sample randomly many metabolic networks that can sustain life on any given carbon source but contain an otherwise random set of known biochemical reactions. We show that when we require such networks to be viable on one particular carbon source, they are typically also viable on multiple other carbon sources that were not targets of selection. For example, viability on glucose may entail viability on up to 44 other sole carbon sources. Any one adaptation in these metabolic systems typically entails multiple potential exaptations. Metabolic systems thus contain a latent potential for evolutionary innovations with non-adaptive origins. Our observations suggest that many more metabolic traits may have non-adaptive origins than is appreciated at present. They also challenge our ability to distinguish adaptive from non-adaptive traits."

In vivo calcium imaging of L3, combined with neuronal silencing experiments, suggests a neural mechanism to achieve selectivity for moving dark edges. We further demonstrate that different innate behaviors, turning and forward movement, can be independently modulated by visual motion. These two behaviors make use of different combinations of input channels. Such modular use of input channels to achieve feature extraction and behavioral specialization likely represents a general principle in sensory systems."
https://openalex.org/W2027458507,"Vocal communicators such as humans and songbirds readily recognize individual vocalizations, even in distracting auditory environments. This perceptual ability is likely subserved by auditory neurons whose spiking responses to individual vocalizations are minimally affected by background sounds. However, auditory neurons that produce background-invariant responses to vocalizations in auditory scenes have not been found. Here, we describe a population of neurons in the zebra finch auditory cortex that represent vocalizations with a sparse code and that maintain their vocalization-like firing patterns in levels of background sound that permit behavioral recognition. These same neurons decrease or stop spiking in levels of background sound that preclude behavioral recognition. In contrast, upstream neurons represent vocalizations with dense and background-corrupted responses. We provide experimental evidence suggesting that sparse coding is mediated by feedforward suppression. Finally, we show through simulations that feedforward inhibition can transform a dense representation of vocalizations into a sparse and background-invariant representation."

Cells have adopted a protein-mediated delivery mechanism for copper within the cytosol.

Although cytosolic copper trafficking has been well characterized, the pathway that delivers copper to mitochondria in yeast and in other eukaryotes is completely unknown. CcO is a multimeric protein complex that contains two copper centers, a binuclear CuA site and a heme a3-CuB site. A number of assembly factors act in concert to build both of these sites.

Additionally, the IMS protein Cmc1 has been implicated in the control of copper flow within the IMS, potentially by directing copper to the Cox17-mediated CcO assembly pathway (10.Horn D. Al-Ali H.

These observations led us to propose that the matrix copper pool is redistributed to the IMS, where it is made available to CcO. Although the exact structural identity of the CuL is unknown, we have characterized many aspects of its in vivo function. We propose that the ligand exists in a metal-free form in the cytosol, where it binds copper and delivers it to mitochondria, providing a non-proteinaceous trafficking system for copper delivery to the organelle. The IM is impermeable to most ions and molecules, so transporters must exist that facilitate matrix import of the CuL complex and its subsequent redistribution to the IMS. However, transporters required for the movement of copper across the IM have yet to be identified and remain a fundamental gap in our understanding of the mechanisms that provide for the assembly of CcO. Data from our previous studies suggest that the CuL is the molecule that is transported into the matrix and that this complex may resemble a metabolite or nucleotide. Therefore, copper transport across the IM may proceed through one or more of the mitochondrial carrier family (MCF) proteins. These proteins transport diverse metabolic substrates, such as oxaloacetate, citrate, GTP, and ATP, into and out of the matrix (15.Kunji E.R. Robinson A.J.

Therefore, a precedent exists for the involvement of multiple MCF proteins in modulating mitochondrial metal ion homeostasis. Herein, we present evidence that the MCF protein Pic2 transports copper across the mitochondrial IM, allowing for its accumulation within the matrix. The yeast strains used in this study were BY4741 (MATa leu2Δ met15Δ ura3Δ his3Δ) and the isogenic kanMX4-containing mutant from Invitrogen. ccs1Δ::IMhSOD1 was created in the Y7092 background (MATα can1Δ::STE2pr-Sp_his5 lyp1Δ his3Δ leu2Δ ura3Δ met15Δ) (27.Tong A.H. Boone C. Synthetic genetic array analysis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 313: 171-192PubMed Google Scholar). All cultures were grown in YP medium (1% yeast extract and 2% peptone) or synthetic defined media (with selective amino acids excluded) with the appropriate filter-sterilized carbon source added. Metal concentrations were varied using BIO 101 yeast nitrogen base (Sunrise Science Products) plus added 0.1 mm ferrous chloride to give copper-deficient conditions. If required, further copper chelation was achieved by adding bathocuproinedisulfonic acid (BCS). Exogenous copper was provided by adding CuSO4. All of the growth tests were performed at 30 °C with 1:10 serial dilutions of pre-cultures grown under permissive conditions. Matrix-targeted Crs5 was described previously (14.Cobine P.A. Pierrel F. Bestwick M.L. Winge D.R. Mitochondrial matrix copper complex used in metallation of cytochrome oxidase and superoxide dismutase.J. Biol.

The PIC2/YER053C ORF plus 300 bp upstream (to include the endogenous promoter) was cloned into pRS415. The PIC2 ORF was also cloned into pNZ8148 (MoBiTec) under the control of the nisin-inducible promoter. The fidelity of each construct was verified by dideoxynucleotide sequencing prior to use. Intact mitochondria were prepared, and the resultant soluble contents were fractionated as described previously (11.Cobine P.A. Ojeda L.D. Rigby K.M. Winge D.R. Yeast contain a non-proteinaceous pool of copper in the mitochondrial matrix.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14447-14455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Anionic fractions for reverse phase chromatography were prepared by adding DEAE resin (Whatman) in batch. The resin was washed with 25 bed volumes of 20 mm ammonium acetate (pH 8.0) and eluted with 5 volumes of 1 m ammonium acetate (pH 8.0). The samples were loaded directly onto a Phenomenex C18 column. Unbound fractions were removed with 50 mm ammonium acetate (pH 5.0) or with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to isolate the apo-ligand. A 60-min gradient to 100% acetonitrile was used, and 1-ml fractions were collected. The final fractions were analyzed for copper by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES; PerkinElmer Life Sciences 9300-DV system) and for fluorescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS55 fluorometer). Excitation and emission scans of copper-containing fractions were performed at an excitation maximum of 220 nm and an emission maximum of 360 nm using 5-nm slit widths. L. lactis cells transformed with vector (pNZ8148) alone or carrying the PIC2 gene were grown overnight at 30 °C in M17 medium with 0.5% glucose and 10 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Cells were diluted into fresh medium at an A600 of 0.1, grown to an A600 of 0.4, and induced using 1 ng/ml nisin for 5 h. Protein expression was confirmed using SDS-PAGE, followed by SYPRO staining or immunoblotting for Pic2. Isolated mitochondria suspended in 0.6 m sorbitol were incubated with the CuL for 30-s intervals and removed from the solution by centrifugation. Uptake was measured by ICP-OES as an increase in copper over time. Copper uptake was assayed in L. lactis using a modified method in which whole cells were resuspended in soluble matrix copper, purified ligand, or copper salts in either water or potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). Cells were incubated for different time points at room temperature, removed by centrifugation, and washed with water, and total metals were measured by ICP-OES. Uptake is reported as the increase in copper over time. CcO and malate dehydrogenase activities were measured as described previously (11.Cobine P.A. Ojeda L.D. Rigby K.M. Winge D.R. Yeast contain a non-proteinaceous pool of copper in the mitochondrial matrix.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14447-14455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) using a Shimadzu UV-2450 system. Superoxide dismutase (SOD1) activity was measured using a xanthine oxidase-linked assay kit (Sigma). The anti-human SOD1 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antisera for Cox2 (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2) and porin were purchased from Invitrogen. Antiserum for yeast Pic2 was raised against a synthetic peptide consisting of the 20 N-terminal residues (GenScript). We assume that the transported form of copper into mitochondria is the CuL complex. To assess transport characteristics into yeast mitochondria, we isolated the soluble matrix copper contents using anion exchange resin and incubated purified intact mitochondria with variable concentrations of the stable CuL complex. Mitochondria were removed by centrifugation and then assayed for their total copper content by ICP-OES. The CuL was imported into mitochondria in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1A). The observed increase in copper content was not due to membrane association, as lysis of mitochondria via sonication before assay prevented accumulation (Fig. 1A), and lysis after uptake released the copper into the soluble fraction (80 ± 5% soluble). Increasing concentrations of the CuL complex saturated the initial rate of copper uptake (Fig. 1B). Half-maximal transport was observed at ∼15 μm CuL complex. Uptake was temperature-dependent, as incubation of mitochondria at 4 °C prevented CuL accumulation, and identical initial rates were obtained in mitoplasts lacking the outer membrane (Fig. 1C), suggesting that the transport occurred at the IM. Addition of the uncoupling ionophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone did not affect the initial rates of uptake (Fig. 1C). Therefore, we conclude that the mitochondrial IM has a saturable temperature-dependent copper transport system. External chelators are often used to deplete the medium of copper. However, we sought to find a competitor that could more directly affect mitochondrial copper. Silver shares similar electronic properties with copper, and it is often used as a toxic mimetic of copper in biological systems (28.Jin Y.H. Dunlap P.E. McBride S.J. Al-Refai H. Bushel P.R.

Inorg. Biochem. 2012; 116: 88-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We therefore isolated intact mitochondria from yeast grown in glucose-containing medium with or without 185 μm AgNO3. Mitochondria from cells grown in the presence of silver accumulated 17 ± 0.4 mmol of silver/mol of sulfur and contained 3.3 ± 0.2 mmol of copper/mol of sulfur, whereas mitochondria from untreated cells contained 5.4 ± 0.1 mmol of copper/mol of sulfur. Although the mitochondrial copper content was reduced in silver-treated cultures, the other mineral element concentrations were comparable to those in the untreated cultures (Fig. 2A). The decrease in copper was associated with a decrease in CcO activity and oxygen consumption (Fig. 2B). Separate cultures were grown in medium containing either 150 μm silver or 150 μm copper. Under these identical conditions, silver accumulated to ∼5-fold higher concentrations in mitochondria compared with copper (data not shown). Moreover, addition of 185 μm silver to rich medium containing a non-fermentable carbon source limited the growth of wild-type cells (Fig. 2C). Mitochondria from these silver-treated cells were fractionated into soluble and insoluble components, and the soluble contents were separated by anion exchange chromatography (Fig. 2D). The fractions containing the CuL also contained an anionic silver complex (AgL). Anionic AgL was used for in vitro uptake assays. Like the CuL, the AgL complex was imported into mitochondria in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). On the basis of the in vivo observation that silver affected copper accumulation in mitochondria, we attempted to mimic this in vitro. The AgL complex was added to mitochondria in 10-fold excess compared with the CuL, and the initial rate of uptake was monitored. The excess AgL acted as a competitor, greatly decreasing CuL uptake (Fig. 3B). Conversely, a 10-fold excess of the CuL slowed uptake of the AgL into mitochondria (Fig. 3C). Yeast lacking PIC2, which encodes a MCF protein, had a growth defect on non-fermentable medium in the presence of the cell-impermeable copper chelator BCS. This defect was exacerbated by addition of silver to the medium and reversed upon addition of copper (Fig. 4A). The decrease in growth was accompanied by a silver-dependent depletion of Cox2 protein in these mitochondria (Fig. 4B). The pic2Δ strain also showed a defect on copper-limited synthetic medium with a non-fermentable carbon source without addition of silver (Fig. 5A). In agreement with the growth phenotype, we observed a 50% reduction in CcO activity and oxygen consumption in the pic2Δ mutant (Fig. 5B). To exaggerate the growth defect in the pic2Δ strain, we transformed the cells with a matrix-targeted copper metallothionein (CRS5) that we have used previously to biochemically deplete the bioavailable matrix copper pool (14.Cobine P.A. Pierrel F. Bestwick M.L. Winge D.R. Mitochondrial matrix copper complex used in metallation of cytochrome oxidase and superoxide dismutase.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36552-36559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The pic2Δ strain expressing matrix-targeted CRS5 exhibited a greater growth defect compared with the pic2Δ strain alone on copper-replete non-fermentable medium, a defect that became more severe upon depletion of available copper from the medium by addition of increasing BCS concentrations (Fig. 5C).FIGURE 5Growth phenotypes of pic2Δ yeast strains upon copper depletion.

Pierrel F. Bestwick M.L. Winge D.R. Mitochondrial matrix copper complex used in metallation of cytochrome oxidase and superoxide dismutase.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 36552-36559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In this biomarker strain, the gene for the copper chaperone for Sod1, CCS1, has been deleted, rendering the yeast Sod1 inactive and causing a lysine auxotrophy. An IM-tethered human SOD1 (IM-hSOD1) is then stably expressed and rescues the Sod1 deficit of the ccs1Δ strain in a manner that is dependent on matrix copper being made available within the IMS. Although deletion of PIC2 did not change the steady-state levels of IM-hSOD1 (Fig. 6A), SOD1 activity in BCS-supplemented medium was decreased to 39% of the parental strain (Fig. 6B). Supplementation of the medium with silver progressively decreased the activity of IM-hSOD1 in ccs1Δ mitochondria, and deletion of PIC2 exacerbated this defect (Fig. 6C). These data strongly suggest that mitochondrial copper required for the metallation of IMS cuproenzymes is a limiting factor in pic2Δ cells. Mitochondria isolated from pic2Δ cells grown in synthetic medium were analyzed for total metals by ICP-OES and showed a mild decrease in copper to 0.7-fold of the parental strain (1.9 ± 0.2 mmol of copper/mol of sulfur in the parental strain versus 1.2 ± 0.2 mmol of copper/mol of sulfur in pic2Δ mitochondria). To exaggerate this phenotypic effect, pic2Δ cells were grown in synthetic medium with added 0.5 mm CuSO4, and the mineral profile of the mitochondria was compared with that of parental yeast cultured under the same conditions (Fig. 7A). Although both strains had increased mitochondrial copper under these conditions, the pic2Δ mitochondria accumulated less copper compared with the parental strain (∼0.4-fold). There was no observable change in the content of phosphorus, iron, manganese, calcium, and magnesium, but we observed an ∼1.5-fold increase in zinc and potassium. These data suggest a specific defect in copper uptake in pic2Δ mitochondria (Fig. 7A). Intact mitochondria from pic2Δ cells were incubated with purified CuL complex and assayed for uptake. Initial rates of CuL uptake were decreased in pic2Δ mitochondria relative to those in parental cells (Fig. 7B). Moreover, pic2Δ mitochondria showed lower maximal rates of uptake. This change in saturation suggests a decreased capacity for CuL uptake in the pic2Δ strain, consistent with the lower total copper accumulation. This uptake defect was evident across a range of CuL concentrations (Fig. 7B). Because Pic2 has been previously identified as a secondary phosphate carrier, mitochondria from pic2Δ cells were assayed for phosphate uptake using an established swelling assay (30.Hamel P. Saint-Georges Y. de Pinto B. Lachacinski N. Altamura N. Dujardin G. Redundancy in the function of mitochondrial phosphate transport in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Arabidopsis thaliana.Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Consistent with previous observations, no defect in phosphate uptake was detected in pic2Δ mitochondria (data not shown). To account for possible indirect effects of other proteins contributing to the observed defects in mitochondrial copper uptake, we cloned PIC2 into a nisin-inducible vector for expression in the bacterium L. lactis. MCF proteins expressed in L. lactis are folded correctly in the cytoplasmic membrane, and transport can be assayed directly in whole cells (31.Kunji E.R. Chan K.W. Slotboom D.J. Floyd S. O'Connor R.

https://openalex.org/W1967709814,"Molecular motors play critical roles in the formation of mitotic spindles, either through controlling the stability of individual microtubules, or by crosslinking and sliding microtubule arrays. Kinesin-8 motors are best known for their regulatory roles in controlling microtubule dynamics. They contain microtubule-destabilizing activities, and restrict spindle length in a wide variety of cell types and organisms. Here, we report an antiparallel microtubule-sliding activity of the budding yeast kinesin-8, Kip3. The in vivo importance of this sliding activity was established through the identification of complementary Kip3 mutants that separate the sliding activity and microtubule-destabilizing activity. In conjunction with Cin8, a kinesin-5 family member, the sliding activity of Kip3 promotes bipolar spindle assembly and the maintenance of genome stability. We propose a slide–disassemble model where the sliding and destabilizing activity of Kip3 balance during pre-anaphase. This facilitates normal spindle assembly. However, the destabilizing activity of Kip3 dominates in late anaphase, inhibiting spindle elongation and ultimately promoting spindle disassembly. Pellman and colleagues report that the Kip3 kinesin-8 has antiparallel microtubule-sliding activity. The ability of Kip3 to slide antiparallel microtubules, along with its known role in destabilizing microtubules, are important for regulating spindle length."

Overexpression of HER2 has been found to serve as a target for developing trastuzumab to treat 20-25% of breast cancer. However, little or none of the other membrane receptor was found to be useful as a potential target for breast cancer treatment since then. Here, we showed that amplified signaling of interleukin-17 receptor B (IL-17RB) and its ligand IL-17B promoted tumorigenicity in breast cancer cells and impeded acinus formation in immortalized normal mammary epithelial cells. External signal transmitted through IL-17RB activated nuclear factor-κB to upregulate antiapoptotic factor Bcl-2 and induced etoposide resistance. Elevated expression of IL-17RB had a stronger correlation with poor prognosis than HER2 in breast cancer patients. Interestingly, breast cancer patients with high expression of IL-17RB and HER2 had the shortest survival rate. Depletion of IL-17RB in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cells significantly reduced their tumorigenic activity, suggesting that IL-17RB and HER2 have an independent role in breast carcinogenesis. Furthermore, treatment with antibodies specifically against IL-17RB or IL-17B effectively attenuated tumorigenicity of breast cancer cells. These results suggest that the amplified IL-17RB/IL-17B signaling pathways may serve as a therapeutic target for developing treatment to manage IL-17RB-associated breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1970663550,"The bacterial RecBCD helicase/nuclease shows broad, and apparently static, heterogeneity in the unwinding rate manifest by individual molecules: here it is shown that transiently halting an enzyme during processive translocation allows for a change, most likely conformational, such that the velocity of the molecule after pausing can fall anywhere within the spectrum of rates seen for a population. The bacterial RecBCD helicase/nuclease shows broad heterogeneity in unwinding rates of individual molecules. Stephen Kowalczykowski and colleagues have investigated this behaviour and find that transiently stopping the enzyme during processive translocation allows for a change, probably conformational, such that the velocity of the molecule after pausing can fall anywhere within the spectrum of rates seen for a population. The interpretation is that ligand binding stabilizes a particular equilibrium conformational sub-state that can persist for the duration of unwinding of the substrates used, and that determines the rate for that molecule. Single-molecule studies can overcome the complications of asynchrony and ensemble-averaging in bulk-phase measurements, provide mechanistic insights into molecular activities, and reveal interesting variations between individual molecules1,2,3. The application of these techniques to the RecBCD helicase of Escherichia coli has resolved some long-standing discrepancies, and has provided otherwise unattainable mechanistic insights into its enzymatic behaviour4,5,6. Enigmatically, the DNA unwinding rates of individual enzyme molecules are seen to vary considerably6,7,8, but the origin of this heterogeneity remains unknown. Here we investigate the physical basis for this behaviour. Although any individual RecBCD molecule unwound DNA at a constant rate for an average of approximately 30,000 steps, we discover that transiently halting a single enzyme–DNA complex by depleting Mg2+-ATP could change the subsequent rates of DNA unwinding by that enzyme after reintroduction to ligand. The proportion of molecules that changed rate increased exponentially with the duration of the interruption, with a half-life of approximately 1 second, suggesting that a conformational change occurred during the time that the molecule was arrested. The velocity after pausing an individual molecule was any velocity found in the starting distribution of the ensemble. We suggest that substrate binding stabilizes the enzyme in one of many equilibrium conformational sub-states that determine the rate-limiting translocation behaviour of each RecBCD molecule. Each stabilized sub-state can persist for the duration (approximately 1 minute) of processive unwinding of a DNA molecule, comprising tens of thousands of catalytic steps, each of which is much faster than the time needed for the conformational change required to alter kinetic behaviour. This ligand-dependent stabilization of rate-defining conformational sub-states results in seemingly static molecule-to-molecule variation in RecBCD helicase activity, but in fact reflects one microstate from the equilibrium ensemble that a single molecule manifests during an individual processive translocation event."
https://openalex.org/W2055895574,"Normal cells possess adaptive mechanisms to couple energy availability with cell growth (cell size increase) and survival, and imbalances are associated with major diseases such as cancer. Inactivation of critical regulators involved in energy stress response, including adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), liver kinase B1 (LKB1), tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) and tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2), leads to uncontrolled cell growth yet increased apoptosis under energy stress. These energy stress regulators are also important in tumor suppression and metabolism. Here, we show that forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factor, a central regulator of tumor suppression and metabolism, plays a unique role in energy stress response. FoxOs inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), a key regulator of cell growth, under energy stress, and inactivation of FoxOs alleviates energy stress-mediated mTORC1 repression. Surprisingly, unlike AMPK-, Lkb1- or Tsc1/2-deficient cells, FoxO-deficient cells exhibit decreased apoptosis under energy stress. FoxOs operate to inhibit mTORC1 signaling and cell survival independent of AMPK and TSC. Integrated transcriptomic and functional analyses identified BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein 3 (BNIP3)—a negative regulator of both Rheb and Bcl2 prosurvival family members—as a key downstream target of FoxOs to inhibit mTORC1 function and promote apoptosis in response to energy stress. We show that p38β, but not AMPK, is likely to function upstream of FoxO–BNIP3 to mediate energy stress response. Finally, we reveal that low expression of FoxO or BNIP3 correlates with poor clinical outcomes in renal cancer patients. Together, our study uncovers a novel signaling circuit functioning to mediate cellular energy responses to control cell growth and survival. These findings also have important implications to human cancers."

These cues supplement the influence of daily and seasonal cycles in light and temperature. In Drosophila, the social environment modulates circadian mechanisms that regulate sex pheromone production and mating behavior. Here we demonstrate that a neuroendocrine pathway, defined by the neuropeptide Pigment-Dispersing Factor (PDF), couples the CNS to the physiological output of peripheral clock cells that produce pheromones, the oenocytes. PDF signaling from the CNS modulates the phase of the oenocyte clock. Despite its requirement for sustaining free-running locomoter activity rhythms, PDF is not necessary to sustain molecular rhythms in the oenocytes. Interestingly, disruption of the PDF signaling pathway reduces male sex pheromones and results in sex-specific differences in mating behavior. Our findings highlight the role of neuropeptide signaling and the circadian system in synchronizing the physiological and behavioral processes that govern social interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2170847633,"Removal of cells during development in Caenorhabditis elegans requires the precise execution of cell-death programs, which can include both caspase-dependent and -independent pathways; here it is shown that a single upstream transcription factor can drive both, in parallel, to destroy a single cell. The removal of cells during development requires the precise execution of cell-death programs, which can include both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways. Takashi Hirose and H. Robert Horvitz report that a single upstream factor can drive both, in parallel, to destroy a single cell. They show in C. elegans that the transcription factor SPTF-3 not only drives the transcription of the egl-1 gene, which promotes apoptosis through the activation of caspases, but also the transcription of pig-1, which codes for a protein kinase and kills cells in a caspase-independent manner. Thus different cell-killing pathways can be coordinated by a single transcription factor. The authors suggest that such 'cell-death nodes' might be important therapeutic targets for diseases caused by excessive cell death. During animal development, the proper regulation of apoptosis requires the precise spatial and temporal execution of cell-death programs, which can include both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways1,2. Although the mechanisms of caspase-dependent and -independent cell killing have been examined extensively, how these pathways are coordinated within a single cell that is fated to die is unknown. Here we show that the Caenorhabditis elegans Sp1 transcription factor SPTF-3 specifies the programmed cell deaths of at least two cells—the sisters of the pharyngeal M4 motor neuron and the AQR sensory neuron—by transcriptionally activating both caspase-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways. SPTF-3 directly drives the transcription of the gene egl-1, which encodes a BH3-only protein that promotes apoptosis through the activation of the CED-3 caspase3. In addition, SPTF-3 directly drives the transcription of the AMP-activated protein kinase-related gene pig-1, which encodes a protein kinase and functions in apoptosis of the M4 sister and AQR sister independently of the pathway that activates CED-3 (refs 4, 5). Thus, a single transcription factor controls two distinct cell-killing programs that act in parallel to drive apoptosis. Our findings reveal a bivalent regulatory node for caspase-dependent and -independent pathways in the regulation of cell-type-specific apoptosis. We propose that such nodes might act as features of a general mechanism for regulating cell-type-specific apoptosis and could be therapeutic targets for diseases involving the dysregulation of apoptosis through multiple cell-killing mechanisms."

The sensory cortex contains “topographic” organizations of stimulus parameters such as the orientation of a visual stimulus or the frequency of a sound. Thus, different stimuli cause different groups of neurons to be highly active. For example, smooth motion of a small object causes responses in a population of neurons in extrastriate area MT; the largest responses occur in neurons that have receptive fields in the stimulated location and that prefer the speed and direction of the object’s motion. Target motions at different speeds or directions cause peak responses in different MT neurons. MT provides the sensory drive for the system we study, smooth pursuit eye movements (Newsome et al., 1985Newsome W.T. Wurtz R.H. Dürsteler M.R. Mikami A.

Segregation of object and background motion in visual area MT: effects of microstimulation on eye movements.Neuron. 2000; 26: 725-734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In the motor pathways for pursuit, the representation of the desired eye motion is quite different from that in MT. In cerebellar neurons that are two synapses removed from the extraocular motoneurons, eye direction is determined by the relative firing of neurons that prefer horizontal versus vertical eye motion; eye speed is determined by the absolute firing rate of all neurons (Krauzlis and Lisberger, 1996Krauzlis R.J. Lisberger S.G. Directional organization of eye movement and visual signals in the floccular lobe of the monkey cerebellum.Exp. Brain Res. 1996; 109: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Thus, one of the major challenges faced by the pursuit circuit, and all sensory-motor behaviors, is to “read-out” or “decode” the sensory population response in a way that transforms sensory representations into the coordinate system of the muscles. The readout is continuous in the sense that it attempts to match eye velocity to whatever target velocity is present, rather than making a forced-choice decision among a small number of speeds and/or directions (Lisberger and Westbrook, 1985Lisberger S.G. Westbrook L.E. Properties of visual inputs that initiate horizontal smooth pursuit eye movements in monkeys.J. Neurosci. 1985; 5: 1662-1673PubMed Google Scholar, Osborne et al., 2005Osborne L.C. Lisberger S.G. Bialek W. A sensory source for motor variation.Nature. 2005; 437: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The initiation of pursuit uses the population response in area MT to estimate target velocity: T⇀=f(rMT). The estimate of target velocity then is converted to commands for pursuit, possibly with some added noise: E⇀=T⇀+ξ. Our previous work has led to the hypothesis of a sensory origin for most of the variation in the initiation of pursuit (Osborne et al., 2005Osborne L.C. Lisberger S.G. Bialek W. A sensory source for motor variation.Nature. 2005; 437: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, Osborne et al., 2007Osborne L.C. Hohl S.S. Bialek W. Lisberger S.G.

Variation, signal, and noise in cerebellar sensory-motor processing for smooth-pursuit eye movements.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 6832-6842Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), with little or no noise,ξ, added after sensory estimation. Sensory noise exists because correlations between the responses of individual MT neurons limit noise reduction by pooling across the population (Shadlen et al., 1996Shadlen M.N. Britten K.H. Newsome W.T. Movshon J.A. A computational analysis of the relationship between neuronal and behavioral responses to visual motion.J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1486-1510PubMed Google Scholar, Huang and Lisberger, 2009Huang X. Lisberger S.G.

Neurophysiol. 2009; 101: 3012-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). One goal of the present paper was to provide a critical test of the hypothesis of a sensory origin to motor noise. If the hypothesis is true, then the trial-by-trial variation in responses of individual MT neurons should be correlated with the variation in the initiation of pursuit: there should be strong “MT-pursuit” correlations. The hypothesis also predicts that the trial-by-trial variance of pursuit initiation should be only modestly smaller than the trial-by-trial variance of the responses of MT neurons, because of the limits on noise reduction. Our data satisfy both of these predictions, providing strong, direct support for the hypothesis of a sensory origin for at least some of the variation in pursuit initiation. Our findings in pursuit initiation imply generality for the suggestion that much of the variation in arm movements (Churchland et al., 2006Churchland M.M. Afshar A. Shenoy K.V. A central source of movement variability.Neuron. 2006; 52: 1085-1096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) or saccadic eye movements (van Beers, 2007van Beers R.J. The sources of variability in saccadic eye movements.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 8757-8770Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) arises in the brain, rather than in the motor effectors (Harris and Wolpert, 1998Harris C.M. Wolpert D.M. Signal-dependent noise determines motor planning.Nature. 1998; 394: 780-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (1774) Google Scholar). The other goal in the present paper was to constrain the function f that decodes the population response in MT to estimate target velocity, T⇀=f(rMT). Given that the responses of MT neurons show trial-by-trial correlations with the initial eye velocity of pursuit, the details of the MT-pursuit correlations should probe the exact mechanisms used by pursuit for population decoding. We find positive MT-pursuit correlations in almost all neurons with statistically significant correlations, without regard for whether the target speed is faster or slower than the neuron’s preferred speed. Computational analysis shows that this “structure” of MT-pursuit correlations would result from a specific version of vector averaging decoding computations. Importantly, the data contradict the predictions of other popular decoding computations, including traditional vector averaging and maximum likelihood estimation. We recorded responses of 104 neurons in visual area MT of two monkeys (52 neurons each in monkeys Y and J). The same population of neurons contributed to a prior paper (Hohl and Lisberger, 2011Hohl S.S. Lisberger S.G. Representation of perceptually invisible image motion in extrastriate visual area MT of macaque monkeys.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 16561-16569Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) that analyzed the responses of MT neurons to the small image motions present during the eye movements of fixation. We now report on a conceptually different issue, namely the trial-by-trial correlations between the responses of MT neurons to imposed target motion and the subsequent initiation of smooth pursuit eye movements. We used a modified step-ramp pursuit task (Osborne et al., 2007Osborne L.C. Hohl S.S. Bialek W. Lisberger S.G. Time course of precision in smooth-pursuit eye movements of monkeys.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2987-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, Rashbass, 1961Rashbass C. The relationship between saccadic and smooth tracking eye movements.J. Physiol. 1961; 159: 326-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar) with three distinct epochs of visual stimulation (Figure 1). First, the dots appeared in the receptive field of the neuron under study and remained stationary for a variable amount of time (300–800 ms). The delay between dot appearance and dot motion allowed us to isolate the response to target motion by separating it in time from the transient caused in many neurons by the onset of a visual stimulus; the variable duration prevented the monkey from anticipating the time of onset of target motion. Next, the dots moved locally across the receptive field within a stationary virtual aperture for 100 ms to cause the monkey to initiate pursuit. This approach keeps the moving stimulus positioned on the receptive field of the neuron under study for the interval of stimulus presentation that drives the responses we measure. Dot motion within a stationary virtual aperture causes pursuit initiation that is indistinguishable from that evoked by the en bloc motion of the dots and the aperture (Osborne et al., 2007Osborne L.C. Hohl S.S. Bialek W. Lisberger S.G. Time course of precision in smooth-pursuit eye movements of monkeys.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 2987-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Lastly, we moved the virtual aperture at the same speed as the dots for 250 to 700 ms, to require the monkey to use the pursuit he had initiated to track a moving target as the basis for delivery of a fluid reward. Even though our task provided the same compelling visual motion on each trial and the monkeys performed the behavioral task diligently, the eye velocity at the initiation of pursuit (see traces in Figure 1) was somewhat variable from trial-to-trial (Osborne et al., 2005Osborne L.C. Lisberger S.G. Bialek W. A sensory source for motor variation.Nature. 2005; 437: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). As expected, neural responses in area MT also varied considerably from trial-to-trial (rasters in Figure 1). Our analysis leverages the naturally-occurring variation in both neural and behavioral responses. We observed clear trial-by-trial correlations between the firing rates in MT neurons and eye speed in the initiation of pursuit. The images in Figure 2 show the average MT-pursuit correlations separately for the two populations of neurons recorded in the two monkeys. Each pixel shows the MT-pursuit correlation across many trials for the pair of times indicated on the x and y axes; the full image shows MT-pursuit correlations for all combinations of times in the eye speed and firing rate. Zero on each axis indicates the time of onset of the motion of the dots within the stationary aperture. To obtain MT-pursuit correlations that were uncontaminated by small eye drifts during fixation (Hohl and Lisberger, 2011Hohl S.S. Lisberger S.G. Representation of perceptually invisible image motion in extrastriate visual area MT of macaque monkeys.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 16561-16569Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), we used the filtering procedure outlined in the Experimental Procedures to remove autocorrelations in eye speed that could contaminate MT-pursuit correlations. In both monkeys, there was a strong patch of positive correlations both before (Figures 2A and 2B) and after (Figures 2C and 2D) filtering of eye velocity. Filtering attenuated the MT-pursuit correlations somewhat but did not change their pattern. The filtered MT-pursuit correlations were similar in monkey J (Figure 2C) and monkey Y (Figure 2D) and were large and positive for the correlation of MT responses from 20 to 60 ms after the onset of target motion with pursuit from 80 to 120 ms after the onset of target motion. Because the positive MT-pursuit correlations appeared for times when neural responses precede the eye movement by 60 ms (oblique dashed line), they are consistent with a causal influence of MT firing on eye speed. The remainder of the paper shows MT-pursuit correlations only after removal of temporal autocorrelations in eye velocity. We have analyzed MT-pursuit correlations in three 40 ms intervals using firing rate from 20–140 ms, and the eye velocity from 80–200 ms, after the onset of target motion. These intervals represent the time when image motion precedes eye motion and when pursuit is driven in an open-loop manner by the visual motion present before pursuit begins. In this interval, the image motion is the same on every trial; MT-pursuit correlations seem to arise because the fluctuations in MT responses are driving the fluctuations in eye velocity. Outside of the analysis interval, we found negative MT-pursuit correlations for time intervals when the neural response lagged the eye movements (Figure 2, blue pixels). The timing of the negative correlations is not consistent with a causal effect of firing rate on eye velocity. It suggests, instead, an effect of eye velocity on MT firing rate. Because image motion is equal to target motion minus eye motion, trial-by-trial differences in eye velocity during the initiation of pursuit will cause differences in image motion across the retina, leading to a correlated effect on the firing of MT neurons 60 ms later. The negative MT-pursuit correlations also could arise from temporal autocorrelation in eye velocity after the initiation of pursuit eye movements, possibly due to oscillations that can follow the initial rising phase of eye velocity (Goldreich et al., 1992Goldreich D. Krauzlis R.J. Lisberger S.G. Effect of changing feedback delay on spontaneous oscillations in smooth pursuit eye movements of monkeys.J. Neurophysiol. 1992; 67: 625-638PubMed Google Scholar). We address next the relationship among the stimulus speed and direction, the tuning parameters of an MT neuron, and the sign and magnitude of its MT-pursuit correlation. We show in a later section that this relationship sheds light on the nature of the decoding computation used to estimate target speed from the responses of the population of MT neurons. We computed MT-pursuit correlations for stimulus speeds and directions at different places on the tuning curves of the neuron under study, always correlating MT firing with eye velocity 60 ms later. For each individual neuron, we were able to study only a few combinations of direction and speed, so we assembled a full picture of the “structure” of MT-pursuit correlations by combining the results across the full population of neurons. Overall, we obtained 540 estimates of MT-pursuit correlations for 104 MT neurons, with individual neurons contributing between 2 and 12 stimulus conditions. In Figure 3, each symbol shows the results for one stimulus speed and direction in one neuron. MT-pursuit correlations were largest and most likely to be statistically significant (open symbols) when we correlated MT firing in the interval from 20 to 60 ms after the onset of target motion with the eye velocity in the interval from 80 to 120 ms after the onset of target motion (Figures 3B and 3F). Significant positive or negative correlations appeared in 42.44% or 16.79% of the stimulus conditions. MT-pursuit correlations were more positive for target directions near the preferred direction of the neuron under study, and more negative for target directions nearly opposite to the preferred direction of the neuron under study (Figure 3B). In contrast to the findings for direction, the sign of MT-pursuit correlations depended little on the speed of the stimulus relative to the preferred speed of neurons (Figure 3F). Most of the statistically significant MT-pursuit correlations were positive; most of the negative MT-pursuit correlations represent data for stimulus motion near the nonpreferred direction. The magnitude of the significant correlations in Figure 3F tended to get larger as stimulus speeds increased up to the preferred speed of the neuron under study. We found fewer examples of significant MT-pursuit correlations for eye velocity in the intervals from 120 to 160 ms (Figures 3C and 3G) or from 160 ms to 200 ms (Figures 3D and 3H) after the onset of stimulus motion, even though we retained the 60 ms time difference between firing rate and eye velocity. Fewer than 10% of MT neurons showed significant MT-pursuit correlations for the interval that preceded the initiation of pursuit, incorporating eye velocity from 0–40 ms after the onset of stimulus motion (Figures 3A and 3E). In some experiments we used a different random seed and a different random dot pattern for each trial, and in others we used the same seed and the same dot pattern for all trials. We found significant MT-pursuit correlations under both conditions, with a surprising tendency toward larger correlations when we used the same dot pattern repeatedly. Analysis of the distributions of MT-pursuit correlations revealed statistically significant positive or negative shifts in Figure 3B, depending on whether the direction of target motion was within 90 degrees of the preferred versus the nonpreferred direction of the neuron under study. The mean correlations were 0.1 and −0.03, respectively. The mean values of MT-pursuit correlation were so close to zero in Figures 3A, 3C, and 3D that statistical evaluation seemed meaningless. The prevalence of statistically significant trial-by-trial MT-pursuit correlations during the initiation of pursuit supports the hypothesis of a sensory origin of the variation in the initiation of pursuit more strongly than did prior data, which were strictly inferential (Osborne et al., 2005Osborne L.C. Lisberger S.G. Bialek W. A sensory source for motor variation.Nature. 2005; 437: 412-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). To represent the structure of MT-pursuit correlations in a way that would be easy to compare with the results of computational analysis, we averaged the MT-pursuit correlations in bins according to the neuron’s preferred speed and direction, relative to target speed and direction. The red and yellow pixels on the left side of Figure 4A indicate positive MT-pursuit correlations for neurons with preferred directions within 90 degrees of target direction. As shown earlier (Figure 3F), the MT-pursuit correlation did not vary strongly along the y axis, as a function of preferred speed. The blue and green pixels on the right side of Figure 4A indicate zero or small negative MT-pursuit correlations for neurons with preferred directions within 90 degrees of opposite to the direction of target motion. White pixels indicate bins without data and provide a mask that also was used to present the MT-pursuit correlations for simulated population decoding in the other panels of Figure 4. We used equations given in the Experimental Procedures to create populations of model MT neurons that had mean tuning curves, response variance, and noise correlations like those found in our recordings from area MT (Huang and Lisberger, 2009Huang X. Lisberger S.G. Noise correlations in cortical area MT and their potential impact on trial-by-trial variation in the direction and speed of smooth-pursuit eye movements.J. Neurophysiol. 2009; 101: 3012-3030Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Each unit’s response on each trial was a single number that was intended to represent the spike count within a 40 ms analysis interval. The model MT population consisted of 3,600 units, with 60 preferred directions at a 6 degree spacing and 60 preferred speeds spaced uniformly in log2(speed) between 0.5 and 512 deg/s We created 1,000 simulated population responses (or trials) for target motion at 16 deg/s in one direction and applied several decoding computations to estimate the target direction and speed from the population response in each simulated trial. Finally, we computed each decoder’s predictions for MT-pursuit correlations with the same analysis procedures we had applied to our recordings from area MT. Most of the decoding computations we used are structured as “vector averaging,” a family of decoding computations that can reproduce much of pursuit behavior, defined by S→ in Equation 1. Vector averaging computes the vector sum of MT responses (Ri) weighted by their preferred speed (si) and a unit vector in their preferred direction (θ→i) in the numerator; it divides by the sum of MT responses for normalization:S→=∑iRiθ→isi∑jRj(Equation 1) The equations for our decoders, by using the subscripts i versus j in the numerator and denominator, include the possibility of using different populations of model neurons for the numerator and denominator. This feature allows implementation of the principle that normalization might be based on an estimate rather than a calculation of total population activity (Chaisanguanthum and Lisberger, 2011Chaisanguanthum K.S. Lisberger S.G. A neurally efficient implementation of sensory population decoding.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 4868-4877Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). It also allows us to explore the new idea that there need not be neuron-neuron correlations between the populations of model units that contribute to the population vector sum and the normalization. In all models, however, we created neuron-neuron correlations within the numerator or denominator populations. There were two important ingredients of decoding models that predicted our data successfully. One was an opponent computation in the numerator, to create different signs of MT-pursuit correlations for neurons with preferred directions near versus opposite to the direction of target motion. The other was the lack of correlation between the model neurons that contribute to the weighted population vector in the numerator versus the normalization in the denominator, to create mostly positive MT-pursuit correlations for neurons with preferred directions within 90 degrees of target direction. Figure 4B provided a good qualitative match to the data in Figure 4A, for a form of vector averaging that used opponent motion signals in the numerator and the sum of activity in a different population of model neurons in the denominator (Churchland and Lisberger, 2001Churchland M.M.

Horizontal and vertical eye speeds sh and sv were decoded separately and combined to obtain the speed s (Equation 4). We achieved independence of the model populations for the numerator and denominator by creating two separate populations indexed by i and j, where the model units’ responses were correlated within but not between populations. We scaled the denominator by k to ensure that the estimate of target speed has the correct amplitude, on average. Although it provides the best fit to our data, even Figure 4B does not mimic the data perfectly. It shows a tendency for smaller MT-pursuit correlations for model neurons with lower preferred speeds, a tendency that was weak but visible in our data (Figures 3F and 4A). We found somewhat worse agreement with the data when we decoded with “numerator-opponent vector averaging” (Equations 2, 3, and 4) using the same correlated neurons in the numerator and denominator (Churchland and Lisberger, 2001Churchland M.M. Lisberger S.G. Shifts in the population response in the middle temporal visual area parallel perceptual and motor illusions produced by apparent motion.J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 9387-9402PubMed Google Scholar). In broad strokes, the predicted MT-pursuit correlations (Figure 4C) were positive versus negative for model neurons with preferred directions within 90 degrees of target direction versus within 90 degrees of the opposite direction. However, the model predicted small negative MT-pursuit correlations that were not seen in our data for neurons with preferred directions from 22 to 90 degrees different from target direction and preferred speeds below target speed. Numerator-opponent vector averaging is more successful than some of our other decoders, because the use of opponent motion signals only in the numerator partially de-correlates the numerator and denominator even though the same population of model MT neurons contributes to both. The three decoding computations used in Figures 4D–4F failed qualitatively to predict the MT-pursuit correlations in our data. In each case, the predicted MT-pursuit correlations depended strongly on the difference between target speed and preferred speed when target direction was within 90 degrees of the preferred direction. Each graph has positive MT-pursuit correlations in the upper-left quadrant and negative MT-pursuit correlations in the lower-left quadrant. In our data, MT-pursuit correlations were positive in both of these quadrants. The decoding computation used in Figure 4D was standard vector averaging (Groh, 2001Groh J.M.

https://openalex.org/W2015145802,"The initiation and maintenance of the immune response require a coordinated regulation of signal transduction pathways. Identifying the mechanisms by which these pathways are controlled and modulated is a significant goal of immunology. In the present report, we show a novel role for the zinc finger transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) in the modulation of the inflammatory immune response via its regulation of IL-6. We analyzed the role of KLF4 in the production of IL-6 by dendritic cells. Our data indicate that KLF4 can act in a dual function manner. It acts as a transcription factor in that it can bind to and activate the IL-6 promoter at specific binding sites. KLF4 also has a role in the chromatin remodeling of the IL-6 promoter in that cells deficient in KLF4 exhibited a relative hypoacetylation. These results indicate a molecular role for KLF4 in modulating the intensity of the inflammatory response and help to explain its pleiotropic role in different settings."

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of GATA3 in breast carcinogenesis is still not fully understood. We report here that GATA3 promotes cell proliferation and tumorigenesis by facilitating the G1/S transition through its transcription regulation of the CCND1 gene in breast cancer cells. We found that GATA3 is physically associated with poly-ADP ribose polymerase-1 (PARP1), an enzyme modifying nuclear proteins by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. We showed that PARP1 acts as a transcription coactivator for GATA3 in breast cancer cells and demonstrated that GATA3 cooperates with PARP1 in transactivation of the CCND1 gene. We demonstrated that PARP1 competes with linker histone H1 to maintain a transcriptional competent chromatin environment for CCND1 gene. Our results unveiled a molecular basis for the coordinated regulation between GATA3 and PARP1 in transcription activation, providing a mechanism for GATA3 in breast carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2012309827,"The Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1) transcription factor is associated with unfavorable clinical outcomes. However, the mechanisms underlying this association remain to be fully elucidated. We demonstrate that YB-1 phosphorylation, indicative of YB-1 activation, is a powerful marker of outcomes for ovarian cancer patients. In ovarian cancer, YB-1 phosphorylation is induced by activation of the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) receptor (LPAR) via SRC-dependent transactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that is coupled to MAPK/p90 ribosomal S6 kinase (p90RSK), but not phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling. Activation of the LPAR/SRC/EGFR/MAPK/p90RSK/YB-1 axis leads to production of the EGFR ligand amphiregulin (AREG). AREG induces ongoing YB-1 phosphorylation as well as YB-1-dependent AREG expression, thus constituting an AREG/YB-1 self-reinforcing loop. Disruption of transactivation of the EGFR and the downstream self-reinforcing loop decreases invasiveness of ovarian cancer cells in vitro and limits ovarian cancer growth in xenograft models. These findings established the regulation and significance of YB-1 phosphorylation, therefore further exploration of this signaling axis as a therapeutic avenue in ovarian cancer is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2013425740,"Cross-modal regulation of visual performance by olfactory stimuli begins in the retina, where dopaminergic interneurons receive projections from the olfactory bulb. However, we do not understand how olfactory stimuli alter the processing of visual signals within the retina. We investigated this question by in vivo imaging activity in transgenic zebrafish expressing SyGCaMP2 in bipolar cell terminals and GCaMP3.5 in ganglion cells. The food-related amino acid methionine reduced the gain and increased sensitivity of responses to luminance and contrast transmitted through OFF bipolar cells but not ON. The effects of olfactory stimulus were blocked by inhibiting dopamine uptake and release. Activation of dopamine receptors increased the gain of synaptic transmission in vivo and potentiated synaptic calcium currents in isolated bipolar cells. These results indicate that olfactory stimuli alter the sensitivity of the retina through the dopaminergic regulation of presynaptic calcium channels that control the gain of synaptic transmission through OFF bipolar cells."

Mammals have developed a sophisticated uptake system to capture the vitamin from the diet. Cbl transport is mediated by three transport proteins: transcobalamin, intrinsic factor, and haptocorrin (HC). All three proteins have a similar overall structure but a different selectivity for corrinoids. Here, we present the crystal structures of human HC in complex with cyanocobalamin and cobinamide at 2.35 and 3.0 Å resolution, respectively. The structures reveal that many of the interactions with the corrin ring are conserved among the human Cbl transporters. However, the non-conserved residues Asn-120, Arg-357, and Asn-373 form distinct interactions allowing for stabilization of corrinoids other than Cbl. A central binding motif forms interactions with the e- and f-side chains of the corrin ring and is conserved in corrinoid-binding proteins of other species. In addition, the α- and β-domains of HC form several unique interdomain contacts and have a higher shape complementarity than those of intrinsic factor and transcobalamin. The stabilization of ligands by all of these interactions is reflected in higher melting temperatures of the protein-ligand complexes.

It is a cofactor for the enzymes methionine synthase and methylmalonyl-CoA mutase. Consequently, Cbl is indispensable for central metabolic reactions, including biosynthetic pathways of nucleotides, branched-chain amino acids, and odd-chain fatty acids (1.Banerjee R. Ragsdale S.W.

Watkins D. Update on cobalamin, folate, and homocysteine.Hematology Am. Soc. Hematol. Educ. Program. 2003; 2003: 62-81Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Therefore, Cbl deficiency has severe consequences, including anemia and impaired function of the nervous system (3.Wolters M. Ströhle A. Hahn A. Cobalamin: a critical vitamin in the elderly.Prevent. Med. 2004; 39: 1256-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Cbl is a very complex metalorganic compound (4.Randaccio L. Geremia S. Demitri N. Wuerges J. Vitamin B12: unique metalorganic compounds and the most complex vitamins.Molecules. 2010; 15: 3228-3259Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). It consists of a corrin ring with seven amide side chains (a–g), coordinating a central cobalt ion through four nitrogen atoms. The fifth coordination site on the lower axial part (α-side) of the molecule is provided by a 5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB) ribonucleotide moiety connected to side chain f, whereas the sixth coordination site (β-side) can be occupied by various ligands such as a cyano (CN), hydroxyl, methyl, or 5′-deoxyadenosyl group (see Fig. 1A). A complex transport and uptake system has evolved to guarantee efficient assimilation of the minute amounts of Cbl present in dietary sources. Three proteins with similar structure mediate transport and distribution of Cbl in the human body by capturing the ligand with very high affinity (Kd ∼ 6 fm) (5.Fedosov S.N. Grissom C.B.

Vitamin B12 transport from food to the body's cells–a sophisticated, multistep pathway.Nat. Rev. Gastroenterol. Hepatol. 2012; 9: 345-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). IF is responsible for the absorption of dietary Cbl in the intestine, and TC mediates Cbl transport from the blood to peripheral cells. HC binds Cbl in the upper part of the gastrointestinal tract and is responsible for the stomach passage (8.Fedosov S.N. Physiological and molecular aspects of cobalamin transport.Subcell. Biochem. 2012; 56: 347-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). HC is present in secretions, including saliva, milk, and tears, but also in blood plasma (12.Morkbak A.L. Poulsen S.S. Nexø E. Haptocorrin in humans.Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 2007; 45: 1751-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). There, its physiological function is still unclear. A prominent feature of HC is its high content of glycans, which contribute 28% to the molecular weight. Depending on the source of synthesis (gastric mucosa, glands, granulocytes, etc.) (13.Alpers D.H. Russell-Jones G. Intrinsic factor, haptocorrin, and their receptors.in: Banerjee R. Chemistry and Biochemistry of B12. Wiley, New York1999: 411-440Google Scholar), different glycoforms of HC have been described (14.Yang S.Y. Coleman P.S. Dupont B. The biochemical and genetic basis for the microheterogeneity of human R-type vitamin B12 binding proteins.Blood. 1982; 59: 747-755Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, TC completely lacks glycans. One striking difference between HC and the other two transport proteins is its ability to capture corrinoids other than Cbl, so-called Cbl analogs, with equally high affinity (15.Kolhouse J.F. Allen R.H. Absorption, plasma transport, and cellular retention of cobalamin analogues in the rabbit. Evidence for the existence of multiple mechanisms that prevent the absorption and tissue dissemination of naturally occurring cobalamin analogues.J. Clin. Invest. 1977; 60: 1381-1392Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Notably, HC even binds corrinoids whose nucleotide is missing (cobinamide (Cbi)) (see Fig. 1B) or not coordinated to the cobalt (“base-off” ligands) (6.Fedosov S.N. Fedosova N.U. Kräutler B. Nexø E.

Biochem. 1991; 199: 299-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This suggests that HC has a potential role as a scavenger protein in plasma, preventing the uptake of biologically inactive corrinoids into cells and clearing them through the hepatobiliary pathway (16.Stupperich E. Nexø E. Effect of the cobalt-N coordination on the cobamide recognition by the human vitamin B12 binding proteins intrinsic factor, transcobalamin and haptocorrin.Eur. J.

Cobalamin analogues are present in human plasma and can mask cobalamin deficiency because current radioisotope dilution assays are not specific for true cobalamin.N. Engl. J.

The exact nature and significance of these Cbl analogs in blood are still unclear, but interestingly, some studies found a correlation of high analog concentrations in blood with Cbl deficiency, neurologic abnormalities, and Alzheimer disease (12.Morkbak A.L. Poulsen S.S. Nexø E. Haptocorrin in humans.Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 2007; 45: 1751-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the last 6 years, the crystal structures of human TC and bovine (bTC) TC (20.Wuerges J. Garau G. Geremia S. Fedosov S.N. Petersen T.E. Randaccio L. Structural basis for mammalian vitamin B12 transport by transcobalamin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 4386-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), IF (21.Mathews F.S. Gordon M.M. Chen Z. Rajashankar K.R. Ealick S.E. Alpers D.H. Sukumar N. Crystal structure of human intrinsic factor: cobalamin complex at 2.6-Å resolution.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 17311-17316Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and IF in complex with its receptor cubilin (22.Andersen C.B. Madsen M. Storm T. Moestrup S.K. Andersen G.R. Structural basis for receptor recognition of vitamin-B12-intrinsic factor complexes.Nature. 2010; 464: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) have been reported. However, structural information on HC revealing the molecular determinants of the unique ability of HC to bind to Cbl analogs is still missing to date. Based on homology models, it was predicted that the overall architecture of HC is very similar to the structures of TC and IF (23.Wuerges J. Geremia S. Randaccio L. Structural study on ligand specificity of human vitamin B12 transporters.Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The ability of HC to bind the baseless ligand Cbi was explained by the presence of three bulky residues, Arg-357, Trp-359, and Tyr-362 (23.Wuerges J. Geremia S. Randaccio L. Structural study on ligand specificity of human vitamin B12 transporters.Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), in the binding pocket. It is thought that these residues facilitate the binding of Cbi to HC by compensating for the absence of nucleotide at the α-side of the corrin ring. They may provide comparable hydrophobic contacts with the apolar α-side of Cbi, as observed for the DMB ribonucleotide in Cbl. In contrast to HC, TC and IF possess only one of these three bulky amino acids (Tyr and Trp, respectively) and thus cannot fully compensate for the hydrophobic contacts at the α-side of Cbi as proposed for HC. Still, the homology model did not provide an explanation for the ability of HC to bind a wide range of Cbl analogs modified at the α-side, including base-off ligands. In this study, we set out to determine the crystal structure of HC to understand the molecular details of its unique corrinoid-binding behavior compared with the other reported Cbl transport proteins. To facilitate crystallization of the heavily glycosylated protein, we expressed recombinant human HC in HEK293 GnTI− cells, thereby producing proteins with a uniform glycosylation pattern to facilitate subsequent deglycosylation. We describe the crystal structures of HC in complex with the ligands cyanocobalamin (CNCbl) and Cbi. Our results complete the picture of corrinoid transport by providing the molecular details of the last of the three human transport proteins. Recombinant human HC and TC (referred to below as HC and TC) and murine TC (mTC) were prepared as described previously (24.Furger E. Fedosov S.N. Lildballe D.L. Waibel R. Schibli R. Nexø E. Fischer E. Comparison of recombinant human haptocorrin expressed in human embryonic kidney cells and native haptocorrin.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7: e37421Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 25.Furger, E., (2012) Structural and Functional Characterisation of the Cobalamin Transport Protein Haptocorrin. Ph.D. thesis, ETH Zürich,Google Scholar). Briefly, HC was expressed in HEK293 cells, purified on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column, and subjected to size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200 column equilibrated in 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) and 20 mm NaCl. Purification tags were removed by thrombin (Sigma) cleavage. For crystallization, the protein was expressed in HEK293 GnTI− cells, and additional steps were included in the purification procedure to increase the homogeneity of the protein sample. After thrombin cleavage and the second Ni2+ affinity column purification, the buffer was exchanged to 50 mm citric acid at pH 5.5 (12 mm citric acid and 38 mm sodium citrate) for deglycosylation overnight at room temperature on an orbital shaker using either endoglycosidase H (5 units; New England Biolabs) or endoglycosidase F1 (10 μg/mg protein; New England Biolabs). The sample was then finally polished on a HiLoadTM 16/60 Superdex 200 column at a flow rate of 48 ml/h using HEPES-buffered saline at pH 7.4 (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and 100 mm NaCl). The fractions with pure and untagged protein were pooled, concentrated to 36 mg/ml, and directly used for crystallization. Recombinant IF was kindly provided by Prof. Ebba Nexø (Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark). A real-time PCR cycler (Rotor-Gene Q 5plex HRM, Qiagen) was used for protein stability measurement by DSF. Stability measurements were performed in triplicates in PBS at pH 7.4. SYPRO® Orange (Invitrogen) was used at a 5-fold final concentration. The final protein concentration in the samples was 1 μm, and the ligand concentration was varied between 0.25 and 10 μm. The final volume of the samples was 100 μl. The real-time PCR cycler was programmed to ramp the temperature from 25 to 95 °C, collecting the data every 0.5 °C, with an equilibration time of 2 s. Data were normalized to the peak fluorescence value of the protein in the absence of ligands. Tm values were determined using Rotor-Gene Q Version 2.0.2.4 software (Qiagen). For crystallization, proteins were supplied with a 1.5-fold molar excess of CNCbl (Sigma) or dicyanocobinamide (Sigma) and concentrated to 0.8 mm (36 mg/ml). Proteins were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with the precipitant and crystallized by the sitting drop vapor diffusion technique at a temperature of 4 °C. Hexagonal pink crystals appeared in 50% PEG 400, 0.2 m MgCl2, and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate (pH 6.5) after 5–7 days and reached their full size after 15 days. They belonged to space group P64, with one molecule in the asymmetric unit. Crystals were flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen without additional cryoprotecting agents. Diffraction data were collected at 100 K at beamline X06SA of the Swiss Light Source (Villigen, Switzerland). Data were processed and merged using XDS (26.Kabsch W. XDS.Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2010; 66: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (11228) Google Scholar). The structure of HC-CNCbl was determined by molecular replacement with Phaser (27.McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W.

The initial molecular replacement solution (RFZ (rotation function Z-score) = 5.4, TFZ (translation function Z-score) = 15.0, LLG (log-likelihood gain) = 205, RFZ = 3.9, TFZ = 12.2, LLG = 289) was first fitted by rigid body refinement, followed by automated model rebuilding with PHENIX (29.Adams P.D.

Open table in a new tab Crystals of HC in complex with the two ligands CNCbl and Cbi (Fig. 1, A and B) were obtained, and the structures of the complexes were determined to 2.35 and 3.0 Å resolution, respectively. In both complexes, the ligands are buried at the interdomain interface. Here, we compared the HC-CNCbl structure with the reported structures of IF-CNCbl (21.Mathews F.S. Gordon M.M. Chen Z. Rajashankar K.R. Ealick S.E. Alpers D.H. Sukumar N. Crystal structure of human intrinsic factor: cobalamin complex at 2.6-Å resolution.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Despite the low sequence identity (<25%) to TC and IF (23.Wuerges J. Geremia S. Randaccio L. Structural study on ligand specificity of human vitamin B12 transporters.Biochem. J. 2007; 403: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), HC features a very similar domain architecture. It comprises two globular domains, the N-terminal α-domain (residues 1–287) and the C-terminal β-domain (residues 309–410), which are connected by a flexible linker (Figs. 1C and 2). The α-domain consists of an intertwined α6/α6 helical barrel as described for TC (20.Wuerges J. Garau G. Geremia S. Fedosov S.N. Petersen T.E. Randaccio L. Structural basis for mammalian vitamin B12 transport by transcobalamin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 4386-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and IF (21.Mathews F.S. Gordon M.M. Chen Z. Rajashankar K.R. Ealick S.E. Alpers D.H. Sukumar N. Crystal structure of human intrinsic factor: cobalamin complex at 2.6-Å resolution.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 17311-17316Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). However, conformational differences are observed at the α1-α2, α3-α4, and α5-α6 loops, which are remote from the ligand interaction site. The α3-α4 loop is much shorter than in TC and is more similar to the corresponding loop in IF. Moreover, the α4-α5 loop of HC adopts a helical conformation (α5′). The outer shell helix α7 is shortened by a helix break at Pro-149, which is followed by a long α7-α8 loop containing a short β-hairpin (β-1′-β-1″ (Fig. 1F). The 3/10 helix capping the bottom of the barrel is one turn shorter than observed in TC and IF. The three disulfide bridges (Cys-3–Cys-242, Cys-82–Cys-285, and Cys-132–Cys-174) that cross-link the α-domain are also conserved. The β-domain consists of two almost perpendicular antiparallel β-sheets (β1/β2/β6/β7/β8 and β3/β4/β5) and an α-helix (α13) stacked in between (20.Wuerges J. Garau G. Geremia S. Fedosov S.N. Petersen T.E. Randaccio L. Structural basis for mammalian vitamin B12 transport by transcobalamin.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 4386-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The tight hydrophobic packing is further stabilized by an additional fourth disulfide bridge (Cys-365–Cys-370), which is unique to human HC and is absent in both TC and IF. This disulfide bridge reduces the flexibility of the β5-β6 loop, which adopts a similar conformation as observed in the structure of IF and which contains a two-residue insertion (Asn-373 and Asn-374) compared with TC (Fig. 1D). This two-residue insertion at the tip of the β5-β6 turn establishes a contact with helix α5 and the α5-α6 loop of the α-domain and confers additional stability to the complex. It comprises the side chains of Asn-109, His-113, Thr-116, Lys-152, Asn-153, Asn-373, Asn-374, and Arg-376 and the main chains of Asn-114, Leu-118, and Thr-119 (Fig. 1D), which form three direct and a series of water-mediated hydrogen bonds. In TC and IF, this interaction is less prominent due to a shorter β5-β6 loop (TC) and a shorter helix α5 (in IF, two turns shorter, and TC, one turn shorter), which is tilted away from the β-domain (Figs. 1D and 2). In TC, no direct hydrogen bonds are observed at this interdomain contact, and in IF, only one salt bridge (Lys-365–Glu-110) and one hydrogen bond (Lys-365–Ser-105) have been described (21.Mathews F.S. Gordon M.M. Chen Z. Rajashankar K.R. Ealick S.E. Alpers D.H. Sukumar N. Crystal structure of human intrinsic factor: cobalamin complex at 2.6-Å resolution.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 17311-17316Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Clear electron density for seven N-linked N-acetylglucosamine moieties is present in the HC-CNCbl structure at Asn-193, Asn-293, Asn-314, Asn-320, Asn-326, Asn-331, and Asn-346. In contrast to the crystal structure of human TC, the HC linker does not participate in crystal contacts over its full length and is largely disordered (residues 296–307). Linker residues 289–294 form a parallel β-strand interaction with strand β2 of a symmetry-related molecule (residues 321–325). Moreover, the N-glycan at Asn-293 is in contact with the symmetry-related N-glycans at Asn-326 and Asn-346. This explains why HC crystallized only upon deglycosylation, as longer branched glycans at these three sites would have prevented crystal formation (data not shown). The relative orientation between the α-and β-domains in HC varies compared with TC and IF: the central axis of the α-domain of HC relative to the β-domain is tilted by 16° compared with TC and is both tilted and twisted by 12° compared with IF. These differences result in a tighter packing of the HC-ligand complex, which features a total buried surface area of 1491 Å2 compared with 1166, 1254, and 1266 Å2 for TC, bTC, and IF, respectively. Accordingly, the overall structure of HC superimposes on TC, bTC, and IF with root mean square deviations of 2.3 Å (281 Cα atoms), 2.3 Å (302 Cα atoms), and 1.8 Å (246 Cα atoms) Å, resp"

https://openalex.org/W2069702049,"SMARCB1 (Snf5/Ini1/Baf47) is a potent tumor suppressor, the loss of which serves as the diagnostic feature in malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRT) and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT), two highly aggressive forms of pediatric neoplasms. SMARCB1 is a core subunit of Swi/Snf chromatin remodeling complexes, and loss of SMARCB1 or other subunits of these complexes has been observed in a variety of tumor types. Here, we restore Smarcb1 expression in cells derived from Smarcb1-deficient tumors, which developed in Smarcb1 heterozygous p53−/− mice. We find that while re-introduction of Smarcb1 does not induce growth arrest, it restores sensitivity to programmed cell death and completely abolishes the ability of the tumor cells to grow as xenografts. We describe persistent activation of AKT signaling in Smarcb1-deficient cells, which stems from PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase)-mediated signaling and which contributes to the survival and proliferation of the tumor cells. We further demonstrate that inhibition of AKT is effective in preventing proliferation of Smarcb1-deficient cells in vitro and inhibits the development of xenografted tumors in vivo. Profiling Smarcb1-dependent gene expression, we find genes that require Smarcb1 and Swi/Snf for their expression to be enriched for extracellular matrix and cell adhesion functions. We find that Smarcb1 is required for transcriptional activation of Igfbp7, a member of the insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins family and a tumor suppressor in itself, and show that re-introduction of Igfbp7 alone can hinder tumor development. Our results define a novel mechanism for Smarcb1-mediated tumorigenesis and highlight potential therapeutic targets."
https://openalex.org/W2090782442,"The PUR domain is a nucleic acid-binding motif found in critical regulatory proteins of higher eukaryotes and in certain species of bacteria. During investigations into mechanisms by which the Lyme disease spirochete controls synthesis of its Erp surface proteins, it was discovered that the borrelial PUR domain protein, Bpur, binds with high affinity to double-stranded DNA adjacent to the erp transcriptional promoter. Bpur was found to enhance the effects of the erp repressor protein, BpaB. Bpur also bound single-stranded DNA and RNA, with relative affinities RNA > double-stranded DNA > single-stranded DNA. Rational site-directed mutagenesis of Bpur identified amino acid residues and domains critical for interactions with nucleic acids, and it revealed that the PUR domain has a distinct mechanism of interaction with each type of nucleic acid ligand. These data shed light on both gene regulation in the Lyme spirochete and functional mechanisms of the widely distributed PUR domain."
https://openalex.org/W1973421322,"Hepcidin regulates iron metabolism by down-regulating ferroportin-1 (Fpn1). We demonstrated that hepcidin is complexed to the blood transport protein, α2-macroglobulin (α2M) (Peslova, G., Petrak, J., Kuzelova, K., Hrdy, I., Halada, P., Kuchel, P. W., Soe-Lin, S., Ponka, P., Sutak, R., Becker, E., Huang, M. L., Suryo Rahmanto, Y., Richardson, D. R., and Vyoral, D. (2009) Blood 113, 6225-6236). However, nothing is known about the mechanism of hepcidin binding to α2M or the effects of the α2M·hepcidin complex in vivo. We show that decreased Fpn1 expression can be mediated by hepcidin bound to native α2M and also, for the first time, hepcidin bound to methylamine-activated α2M (α2M-MA). Passage of high molecular weight α2M·hepcidin or α2M-MA·hepcidin complexes (≈725 kDa) through a Sephadex G-25 size exclusion column retained their ability to decrease Fpn1 expression. Further studies using ultrafiltration indicated that hepcidin binding to α2M and α2M-MA was labile, resulting in some release from the protein, and this may explain its urinary excretion. To determine whether α2M-MA·hepcidin is delivered to cells via the α2M receptor (Lrp1), we assessed α2M uptake and Fpn1 expression in Lrp1(-/-) and Lrp1(+/+) cells. Interestingly, α2M·hepcidin or α2M-MA·hepcidin demonstrated similar activities at decreasing Fpn1 expression in Lrp1(-/-) and Lrp1(+/+) cells, indicating that Lrp1 is not essential for Fpn1 regulation. In vivo, hepcidin bound to α2M or α2M-MA did not affect plasma clearance of α2M/α2M-MA. However, serum iron levels were reduced to a significantly greater extent in mice treated with α2M·hepcidin or α2M-MA·hepcidin relative to unbound hepcidin. This effect could be mediated by the ability of α2M or α2M-MA to retard kidney filtration of bound hepcidin, increasing its half-life. A model is proposed that suggests that unlike proteases, which are irreversibly bound to activated α2M, hepcidin remains labile and available to down-regulate Fpn1."
https://openalex.org/W2070736508,"Mesothelioma is diagnosed in ∼2500 patients in the United States every year, most often arising in the pleural space, but also occurring as primary peritoneal mesothelioma. The vast majority of patients with mesothelioma die of their disease within 3 years. We developed a new mouse model of mesothelioma by bladder or intraperitoneal injection of adenovirus Cre into mice with conditional alleles of each of Tp53 and Tsc1. Such mice began to develop malignant ascites about 6 months after injection, which was due to peritoneal mesothelioma, on the basis of tumor morphology and immunohistochemical staining. Mesothelioma cell lines were established, which showed loss of both Tsc1 and Tp53, with mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTORC)1 activation. Treatment of mice with malignant ascites due to mesothelioma with rapamycin led to a marked reduction in ascites, extended survival and a 95–99% reduction in the mesothelioma tumor volume, in comparison with vehicle-treated mice. To see whether TSC1/TSC2 loss was a common genetic event in human mesothelioma, we examined nine human mesothelioma cell lines, and found that four of nine showed persistent activation of mTORC1, although none had loss of TSC1 or TSC2. A tissue microarray analysis of 198 human mesothelioma specimens showed that 33% of cases had reduced TSC2 expression and 60% showed activation of mTOR, indicating that mTOR activation is common in human mesothelioma, suggesting that it is a potential therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2020245513,"The key molecular events required for the formation of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and its progression to invasive breast carcinoma have not been defined. Here, we show that the nuclear receptor coactivator amplified in breast cancer 1 (AIB1) is expressed at low levels in normal breast but is highly expressed in DCIS lesions. This is of significance since reduction of AIB1 in human MCFDCIS cells restored a more normal three-dimensional mammary acinar structure. Reduction of AIB1 in MCFDCIS cells, both before DCIS development or in existing MCFDCIS lesions in vivo, inhibited tumor growth and led to smaller, necrotic lesions. AIB1 reduction in MCFDCIS cells was correlated with significant reduction in the CD24-/CD44+ breast cancer-initiating cell (BCIC) population, and a decrease in myoepithelial progenitor cells in the DCIS lesions in vitro and in vivo. The loss of AIB1 in MCFDCIS cells was also accompanied by a loss of expression of NOTCH 2, 3 and 4, JAG2, HES1, GATA3, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and HER3 in vivo. These signaling molecules have been associated with differentiation of breast epithelial progenitor cells. These data indicate that AIB1 has a central role in the initiation and maintenance of DCIS and that reduction of AIB1 causes loss of BCIC, loss of components of the NOTCH, HER2 and HER3 signaling pathways and fewer DCIS myoepithelial progenitor cells in vivo. We propose that increased expression of AIB1, through the maintenance of BCIC, facilitates formation of DCIS, a necessary step before development of invasive disease."
https://openalex.org/W1983835422,"Human SNF5 (hSNF5; INI1, SMARCB1 or BAF47) is a component of the human SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex and a tumour suppressor mutated in rhabdoid tumours. It also associates with the integrase of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1. We show by fluorescence loss in photobleaching that hSNF5 is constantly shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, raising the question of what the role of hSNF5 is in the cytoplasm. Here, we demonstrate that hSNF5 directly interacts with the GTPase dynamin-2 (DNM2) in the cytoplasm. DNM2 is a large GTPase involved in endocytosis and vesicle dynamics, which has been related to HIV-1 internalization. We show that hSNF5 colocalizes with DNM2 in endocytic vesicles. Depletion of hSNF5, but not of other components of the SWI/SNF complex, destabilizes DNM2 and impairs DNM2-dependent endocytosis. Furthermore, we show that hSNF5 inhibits assembly-stimulated DNM2 GTPase activity but not basal GTPase activity in vitro. Altogether, these results indicate that hSNF5 affects both the stability and the activity of DNM2, uncovering an unexpected role of hSNF5 in modulating endocytosis, and open new perspectives in understanding the role of hSNF5 in tumour genesis."
https://openalex.org/W2069438602,"The non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src is a major player in multiple physiological responses including growth, survival and differentiation. Overexpression and/or oncogenic mutation in the Src gene have been documented in human tumors. The v-Src protein is an oncogenic mutant of Src, which promotes cell survival, migration, invasion and division. GRIM-19 is an antioncogene isolated using a genome-wide knockdown screen. Genes associated with Retinoid-IFN-induced Mortality (GRIM)-19 binds to transcription factor STAT3 and ablates its pro-oncogenic effects while v-Src activates STAT3 to promote its oncogenic effects. However, we found that GRIM-19 inhibits the pro-oncogenic effects of v-Src independently of STAT3. Here, we report the identification of functionally inactivating GRIM-19 mutations in a set of head and neck cancer patients. While wild-type GRIM-19 strongly ablated v-Src-induced cell migration, cytoskeletal remodeling and tumor metastasis, the tumor-derived mutants (L71P, L91P and A95T) did not. These mutants were also incapable of inhibiting the drug resistance of v-Src-transformed cells. v-Src downregulated the expression of Pag1, a lipid raft-associated inhibitor of Src, which was restored by wild-type GRIM-19. The tumor-derived mutant GRIM-19 proteins failed to upregulate Pag1. These studies show a novel mechanism that deregulates Src activity in cancer cells."
