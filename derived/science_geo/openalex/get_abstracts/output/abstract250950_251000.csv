https://openalex.org/W2158682140,"We previously reported that intramyocardial injection of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells overexpressing Akt (Akt-MSCs) inhibits ventricular remodeling and restores cardiac function measured 2 wk after myocardial infarction. Here, we report that the functional improvement occurs in < 72 h. This early remarkable effect cannot be readily attributed to myocardial regeneration from the donor cells. Thus, we hypothesized that paracrine actions exerted by the cells through the release of soluble factors might be important mechanisms of tissue repair and functional improvement after injection of the Akt-MSCs. Indeed, in the current study we demonstrate that conditioned medium from hypoxic Akt-MSCs markedly inhibits hypoxia-induced apoptosis and triggers vigorous spontaneous contraction of adult rat cardiomyocytes in vitro. When injected into infarcted hearts, the Akt-MSC conditioned medium significantly limits infarct size and improves ventricular function relative to controls. Support to the paracrine hypothesis is provided by data showing that several genes, coding for factors (VEGF, FGF-2, HGF, IGF-I, and TB4) that are potential mediators of the effects exerted by the Akt-MSC conditioned medium, are significantly up-regulated in the Akt-MSCs, particularly in response to hypoxia. Taken together, our data support Akt-MSC-mediated paracrine mechanisms of myocardial protection and functional improvement."
https://openalex.org/W2053789753,"A characteristic feature of grasses and commercially important cereals is the presence of (1,3;1,4)-β- d -glucans in their cell walls. We have used comparative genomics to link a major quantitative trait locus for (1,3;1,4)-β- d -glucan content in barley grain to a cluster of cellulose synthase–like CslF genes in rice. After insertion of rice CslF genes into Arabidopsis , we detected (1,3;1,4)-β- d -glucan in walls of transgenic plants using specific monoclonal antibodies and enzymatic analysis. Because wild-type Arabidopsis does not contain CslF genes or have (1,3;1,4)-β- d -glucans in its walls, these experiments provide direct, gain-of-function evidence for the participation of rice CslF genes in (1,3;1,4)-β- d -glucan biosynthesis."
https://openalex.org/W2111184085,"We demonstrated short segments of a superconducting wire that meets or exceeds performance requirements for many large-scale applications of high-temperature superconducting materials, especially those requiring a high supercurrent and/or a high engineering critical current density in applied magnetic fields. The performance requirements for these varied applications were met in 3-micrometer-thick YBa2Cu3O(7-delta) films epitaxially grown via pulsed laser ablation on rolling assisted biaxially textured substrates. Enhancements of the critical current in self-field as well as excellent retention of this current in high applied magnetic fields were achieved in the thick films via incorporation of a periodic array of extended columnar defects, composed of self-aligned nanodots of nonsuperconducting material extending through the entire thickness of the film. These columnar defects are highly effective in pinning the superconducting vortices or flux lines, thereby resulting in the substantially enhanced performance of this wire."
https://openalex.org/W2166483810,"The mitochondrial (mt) DNA depletion syndromes (MDDS) are genetic disorders characterized by a severe, tissue-specific decrease of mtDNA copy number, leading to organ failure. There are two main clinical presentations: myopathic (OMIM 609560) and hepatocerebral1 (OMIM 251880). Known mutant genes, including TK2 (ref. 2), SUCLA2 (ref. 3), DGUOK (ref. 4) and POLG5,6, account for only a fraction of MDDS cases7. We found a new locus for hepatocerebral MDDS on chromosome 2p21-23 and prioritized the genes on this locus using a new integrative genomics strategy. One of the top-scoring candidates was the human ortholog of the mouse kidney disease gene Mpv17 (ref. 8). We found disease-segregating mutations in three families with hepatocerebral MDDS and demonstrated that, contrary to the alleged peroxisomal localization of the MPV17 gene product9, MPV17 is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein, and its absence or malfunction causes oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) failure and mtDNA depletion, not only in affected individuals but also in Mpv17−/− mice."
https://openalex.org/W2157139222,"We report an extremely rapid mechanism for magnetic field amplification during the merger of a binary neutron star system. This has implications for the production of the short class of gamma-ray bursts, which recent observations suggest may originate in such mergers. In detailed magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the merger process, the fields are amplified by Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities beyond magnetar field strength and may therefore represent the strongest magnetic fields in the universe. The amplification occurs in the shear layer that forms between the neutron stars and on a time scale of only 1 millisecond, that is, long before the remnant can collapse into a black hole."

https://openalex.org/W2136915216,"Seismic rupture produced spectacular tectonic deformation above a 400-kilometer strip of the Sunda megathrust, offshore northern Sumatra, in March 2005. Measurements from coral microatolls and Global Positioning System stations reveal trench-parallel belts of uplift up to 3 meters high on the outer-arc islands above the rupture and a 1-meter-deep subsidence trough farther from the trench. Surface deformation reflects more than 11 meters of fault slip under the islands and a pronounced lessening of slip trenchward. A saddle in megathrust slip separates the northwestern edge of the 2005 rupture from the great 2004 Sumatra-Andaman rupture. The southeastern edge abuts a predominantly aseismic section of the megathrust near the equator."

https://openalex.org/W2109092551,"Tumor escape from immunity, as well as the failure of several anti-cancer vaccination and cellular immunotherapy approaches, is suggested to be due to the angiogenesis-mediated suppression of endothelial cell (EC) adhesion molecules involved in leukocyte-vessel wall interactions. We hypothesized that inhibition of angiogenesis would overcome this escape from immunity. We investigated this in vivo by means of intravital microscopy and ex vivo by immunohistochemistry in two mouse tumor models. Angiogenesis inhibitors anginex, endostatin, and angiostatin, and the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel were found to significantly stimulate leukocyte-vessel wall interactions by circumvention of EC anergy in vivo, i.e., by the up-regulation of endothelial adhesion molecules in tumor vessels. This was confirmed by in vitro studies of cultured EC at the protein and mRNA levels. The new angiostatic designer peptide anginex was most potent at overcoming EC anergy; the enhanced leukocyte-vessel interactions led to an increase in the numbers of tumor infiltrating leukocytes. While anginex inhibited tumor growth and microvessel density significantly, the amount of infiltrated leukocytes (CD45), as well as the number of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, was enhanced markedly. The current results suggest that immunotherapy strategies can be improved by combination with anti-angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2170445507,"Dietary restriction (DR) has been shown to increase life span, delay or prevent age-associated diseases, and improve functional and metabolic cardiovascular risk factors in rodents and other species. To investigate the effects of DR on beat-to-beat heart rate and diastolic blood pressure variability (HRV and DPV) in male Sprague-Dawley rats, we implanted telemetric transmitters and animals were maintained on either intermittent fasting (every other day feeding) or calorie-restricted (40% caloric reduction) diets. Using power spectral analysis, we evaluated the temporal profiles of the low- and high-frequency oscillatory components in heart rate and diastolic blood pressure signals to assess cardiac autonomic activity. Body weight, heart rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure were all found to decrease in response to DR. Both methods of DR produced decreases in the low-frequency component of DPV spectra, a marker for sympathetic tone, and the high-frequency component of HRV spectra, a marker for parasympathetic activity, was increased. These parameters required at least 1 month to become maximal, but returned toward baseline values rapidly once rats resumed ad libitum diets. These results suggest an additional cardiovascular benefit of DR that merits further studies of this potential effect in humans."
https://openalex.org/W1998689099,"Enhanced expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha, is associated with the neuropathological effects underlying disease-, trauma- and chemically induced neurodegeneration. Previously, we have shown that deficiency of TNF receptors protects against MPTP-induced striatal dopaminergic neurotoxicity, findings suggestive of a role for TNF-alpha in neurodegeneration. Here, we demonstrate that deficiency of TNF receptors suppresses microglial activation and alters the susceptibility of brain regions to MPTP. MPTP-induced expression of microglia-derived factors, TNF-alpha, MCP-1, and IL-1alpha, preceded the degeneration of striatal dopaminergic nerve terminals and astrogliosis, as assessed by loss of striatal dopamine and TH, and an increase in striatal GFAP. Pharmacological neuroprotection with the dopamine reuptake inhibitor, nomifensine, abolished striatal dopaminergic neurotoxicity and associated microglial activation. Similarly, in mice lacking TNF receptors, microglial activation was suppressed, findings consistent with a role for TNF-alpha in striatal MPTP neurotoxicity. In the hippocampus, however, TNF receptor-deficient mice showed exacerbated neuronal damage after MPTP, as evidenced by Fluoro Jade-B staining (to identify degenerating neurons) and decreased microtubule-associated protein-2 (MAP-2) immunoreactivity. These effects were not accompanied by microglial activation, but were associated with increased oxidative stress (nitrosylation of tyrosine residues). These findings suggest that TNF-alpha exerts a neurotrophic/neuroprotective effect in hippocampus. The marked differences we observed in the regional density, distribution and/or activity of microglia and microglia-derived factors may influence the region-specific role for this cell type. Taken together, our results are indicative of a region-specific and dual role for TNF-alpha in the brain: a promoter of neurodegeneration in striatum and a protector against neurodegeneration in hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2064600258,"After cutaneous injury, a variety of cell types are activated to reconstitute the epithelial and dermal components of the skin. beta-Catenin plays disparate roles in keratinocytes and fibroblasts, inhibiting keratinocyte migration and activating fibroblast proliferation, suggesting that beta-catenin could either inhibit or enhance the healing process. How beta-catenin functions in concert with other signaling pathways important in the healing process is unknown. Wound size was examined in mice expressing conditional null or conditional stabilized alleles of beta-catenin, regulated by an adenovirus expressing cre-recombinase. The size of the wounds in the mice correlated with the protein level of beta-catenin. Using mice expressing these conditional alleles, we found that the wound phenotype imparted by Smad3 deficiency and by the injection of TGFbeta before wounding is mediated in part by beta-catenin. TGFbeta was not able to regulate proliferation in beta-catenin null fibroblasts, whereas keratinocyte proliferation rate was independent of beta-catenin. When mice are treated with lithium, beta-catenin-mediated signaling was activated in cutaneous wounds, which healed with a larger size. These results demonstrate a crucial role for beta-catenin in regulating cutaneous wound size. Furthermore, these data implicate mesenchymal cells as playing a critical role regulating wound size."

https://openalex.org/W2096987374,"Kaposi's sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV, human herpesvirus 8) is the causative agent of Kaposi's sarcoma and other lymphoproliferative syndromes often associated with HIV/AIDS. Functional complementary DNA selection for a receptor mediating KSHV cell fusion identified xCT, the 12-transmembrane light chain of the human cystine/glutamate exchange transporter system x – c . Expression of recombinant xCT rendered otherwise not susceptible target cells permissive for both KSHV cell fusion and virion entry. Antibodies against xCT blocked KSHV fusion and entry with naturally permissive target cells. KSHV target cell permissiveness correlated closely with endogenous expression of xCT messenger RNA and protein in diverse human and nonhuman cell types."
https://openalex.org/W2076442408,"TRPM2 (previously designated TRPC7 or LTRPC2) is a Ca2+-permeable nonselective cation channel that contains a C-terminal enzymatic domain with pyrophosphatase activity, which specifically binds ADP-ribose. Cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can facilitate ADPR-mediated activation of heterologously expressed TRPM2. Here, we show that the two Ca2+-mobilizing second messengers cyclic ADP-ribose (cADPR) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) strongly activate natively expressed TRPM2 channels in Jurkat T cells. TRPM2 activation by both agonists can be partially suppressed by the ADPR antagonist adenosine monophosphate (AMP), which suggests that cADPR and NAADP lead to mobilization of endogenous ADPR presumably via metabolic conversion. The remaining channel activity is due to direct gating of TRPM2 by the two agonists and can be completely suppressed by 8-Br-cADPR, which suggests that cADPR and NAADP share a common binding site on TRPM2 that can regulate TRPM2 activity in synergy with ADPR. We conclude that cADPR and NAADP, in combination with ADPR, represent physiological co-activators of TRPM2 that contribute to Ca2+ influx in T lymphocytes and presumably other cell types that express this channel."
https://openalex.org/W2099962252,"Senescence is accompanied by oxidative stress and cardiac dysfunction, although the link between the two remains unclear. This study examined the role of antioxidant metallothionein on cardiomyocyte function, superoxide generation, the oxidative stress biomarker aconitase activity, cytochrome c release, and expression of oxidative stress-related proteins, such as the GTPase RhoA and NADPH oxidase protein p47phox in young (5-6 mo) and aged (26-28 mo) FVB wild-type (WT) and cardiac-specific metallothionein transgenic mice. Metallothionein mice showed a longer life span (by approximately 4 mo) than FVB mice evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier survival curve. Compared with young cardiomyocytes, aged myocytes displayed prolonged TR(90), reduced tolerance to high stimulus frequency, and slowed intracellular Ca2+ decay, all of which were nullified by metallothionein. Aging increased superoxide generation, active RhoA abundance, cytochrome c release, and p47phox expression and suppressed aconitase activity without affecting protein nitrotyrosine formation in the hearts. These aging-induced changes in oxidative stress and related protein biomarkers were attenuated by metallothionein. Aged metallothionein mouse myocytes were more resistant to the superoxide donor pyrogallol-induced superoxide generation and apoptosis. In addition, aging-associated prolongation in TR90 was blunted by the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632. Collectively, our data demonstrated that metallothionein may alleviate aging-induced cardiac contractile defects and oxidative stress, which may contribute to prolonged life span in metallothionein transgenic mice."
https://openalex.org/W2171411861,"Degradative fragments of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) have been observed in arthritic patients. The physiological enzyme(s) that degrade COMP, however, remain unknown. We performed a yeast two-hybrid screen (Y2H) to search for proteins that associate with COMP to identify an interaction partner that might degrade it. One screen using the epidermal growth factor (EGF) domain of COMP as bait led to the discovery of ADAMTS-7. Rat ADAMTS-7 is composed of 1595 amino acids, and this protein exhibits higher expression in the musculoskeletal tissues. COMP binds directly to ADAMTS-7 in vitro and in native articular cartilage. ADAMTS-7 selectively interacts with the EGF repeat domain but not with the other three functional domains of COMP, whereas the four C-terminal TSP motifs of ADAMTS-7 are required and sufficient for association with COMP. The recombinant catalytic domain and intact ADAMTS-7 are capable of digesting COMP in vitro. The enzymatic activity of ADAMTS-7 requires the presence of Zn2+ and appropriate pH (7.5-9.5), and the concentration of ADAMTS-7 in cartilage and synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis is significantly increased as compared to normal cartilage and synovium. ADAMTS-7 is the first metalloproteinase found to bind directly to and degrade COMP."
https://openalex.org/W2081869055,"MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells belong to a highly invasive metastatic cell line that depends on phospholipase D (PLD) activity for survival when deprived of serum growth factors. In response to the stress of serum withdrawal, there is a rapid and dramatic increase in PLD activity. Concomitant with increased PLD activity, there was an increase in the ability of MDA-MB-231 cells to both migrate and invade Matrigel™. The ability of MDA-MB-231 cells to both migrate and invade Matrigel™ was dependent on both PLD and mTOR, a downstream target of PLD signals. Serum withdrawal also led to a PLD-dependent increase in the expression of the stress factor, hypoxia-inducible factor-1α. These data reveal that PLD survival signals not only prevent apoptosis but also stimulate cell migration and invasion, linking the ability to suppress apoptosis with the ability to metastasize."
https://openalex.org/W2142782821,We report an undocumented major warming of the Antarctic winter troposphere that is larger than any previously identified regional tropospheric warming on Earth. This result has come to light through an analysis of recently digitized and rigorously quality controlled Antarctic radiosonde observations. The data show that regional midtropospheric temperatures have increased at a statistically significant rate of 0.5 degrees to 0.7 degrees Celsius per decade over the past 30 years. Analysis of the time series of radiosonde temperatures indicates that the data are temporally homogeneous. The available data do not allow us to unambiguously assign a cause to the tropospheric warming at this stage.
https://openalex.org/W2116121153,"In vivo phage display is a technology used to reveal organ-specific vascular ligand-receptor systems in animal models and, recently, in patients, and to validate them as potential therapy targets. Here, we devised an efficient approach to simultaneously screen phage display libraries for peptides homing to any number of tissues without the need for an individual subject for each target tissue. We tested this approach in mice by selecting homing peptides for six different organs in a single screen and prioritizing them by using software compiled for statistical validation of peptide biodistribution specificity. We identified a number of motif-containing biological candidates for ligands binding to organ-selective receptors based on similarity of the selected peptide motifs to mouse proteins. To demonstrate that this methodology can lead to targetable ligand-receptor systems, we validated one of the pancreas-homing peptides as a mimic peptide of natural prolactin receptor ligands. This new comprehensive strategy for screening phage libraries in vivo provides an advantage over the conventional approach because multiple organs internally control for organ selectivity of each other in the successive rounds of selection. It may prove particularly relevant for patient studies, allowing efficient high-throughput selection of targeting ligands for multiple organs in a single screen."
https://openalex.org/W2084471484,"Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding to the C2A and C2B domains of synaptotagmin 1 is thought to trigger fast neurotransmitter release, but only Ca2+ binding to the C2B domain is essential for release. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we have compared the role of basic residues in Ca2+/phospholipid binding and in release. Mutations in a polybasic sequence on the side of the C2B domainβ-sandwich or in a basic residue in a top Ca2+-binding loop of the C2A domain (R233) cause comparable decreases in the apparent Ca2+ affinity of synaptotagmin 1 and the Ca2+ sensitivity of release, whereas mutation of the residue homologous to Arg233 in the C2B domain (Lys366) has no effect. Phosphatidylinositol polyphosphates co-activate Ca2+-dependent and -independent phospholipid binding to synaptotagmin 1, but the effects of these mutations on release only correlate with their effects on the Ca2+-dependent component.

Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding by synaptotagmin 1 in vitro correlates with its functional role in Ca2+ triggering of release in vivo, as demonstrated with both loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations (1Fernandez-Chacon R.

This correlation suggests that Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding represents a crucial step in synaptotagmin 1 function.

Thus, it is puzzling that the two C2 domains of synaptotagmin 1 appear to exhibit similar Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding properties in vitro but a striking functional asymmetry in vivo. The differential requirements of the C2A versus C2B domain for the Ca2+ triggering of release could potentially arise from the unique ability of the C2B domain (but not the C2A domain) to bind to phosphoinositides in a Ca2+-independent manner (10Fukuda M. Kojima T. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26523-26527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 11Bai J. Tucker W.C. Chapman E.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Indeed, consistent with this idea, microinjection of soluble inositol polyphosphates into nerve terminals potently inhibits release (30Llinas R. Sugimori M. Lang E.J. Morita M. Fukuda M. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12990-12993Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Two observations, however, argue against this interpretation. First, the C2B domain acts in release by binding Ca2+ (26Mackler J.M. Drummond J.A. Loewen C.A. Robinson I.M. Reist N.E. Nature. 2002; 418: 340-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar, 29Nishiki T. Augustine G.J. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8542-8550Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), making it difficult to imagine that a Ca2+-independent activity of the C2B domain mediates its essential role. Second and more importantly, mutations in the phosphatidylinositol phosphate-binding site in the C2B domain of synaptotagmin 1 (the polybasic sequence on the side of the domain) abolish phosphatidylinositol phosphate binding (10Fukuda M. Kojima T. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26523-26527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 11Bai J. Tucker W.C. Chapman E.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) but impair synaptotagmin 1 function only moderately (31Mackler J.M. Reist N.E. J. Comp. Neurol. 2001; 436: 4-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 32Borden C.R. Stevens C.F. Sullivan J.M. Zhu Y. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2005; 29: 462-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus the physiological significance of Ca2+-independent binding of phosphatidylinositol phosphates to the polybasic sequences remains unclear.To address this conundrum, we have now tested whether the polybasic sequence of the C2B domain may participate in Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding and whether such an activity correlates with the in vivo function of synaptotagmin 1. We did not examine this activity previously because the location of the polybasic sequence in the atomic structure of the C2B domain, on the side, away from the Ca2+-binding sequences, made a participation in Ca2+-dependent activities appear highly unlikely. Surprisingly, we find that mutation of the polybasic sequence in the C2B domain (the KAKA mutation) impairs Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding to a similar extent as mutation of the positively charged Arg233 in the C2A domain. We also show that under approximately physiological conditions, binding of phosphoinositides to synaptotagmin 1 is entirely Ca2+-dependent, although at low ionic strength or in the absence of Mg2+,Ca2+-independent binding of phosphoinositides occurs. Moreover, we demonstrate that the effects of the R233Q and KAKA mutations on the Ca2+ sensitivity of release correlate with their impairment of the Ca2+-dependent component of phospholipid binding but not with their effects on the Ca2+-independent component. Finally, we show that the K366Q substitution in the C2B domain (that corresponds to the R233Q mutation in the C2A domain) has no effect on phospholipid binding and release. These results show that the polybasic region contributes to Ca2+-dependent phospholipid binding to synaptotagmin 1, reinforcing the notion that this is a major function of synaptotagmin 1 during fast Ca2+-triggered release and revealing an overt asymmetry in the contributions of the two C2 domains to this activity. In addition, the enhancement of Ca2+-induced phospholipid binding by phosphoinositides suggests that phosphoinositides may modulate the apparent Ca2+ affinity of synaptotagmin 1 during release.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESSite-directed Mutagenesis and Viral Preparation—Mutations were introduced into rat cDNA encoding synaptotagmin1 using point mutation PCR or QuikChange™ mutagenesis technique as described previously (52Han W. Rhee J.S. Maximov A. Lao Y. Mashimo T. Rosenmund C. Sudhof T.C. Neuron. 2004; 41: 85-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Mutated synaptotagmin 1 inserts were subsequently subcloned into the pSFV1 vector (Invitrogen). Semliki Forest virus (SFV) production was carried out as described previously (40Ashery U. Betz A. Xu T. Brose N. Rettig J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Briefly, linearized SFV plasmids were transcribed in vitro, and the resulting RNA were transfected into BHK21 cells by electroporation. 24 h later, cell culture media containing inactive virus were collected and frozen in aliquots. For one experiment, one frozen aliquot was thawed and activated by α-chymotrypsin for 30 min.Neuronal Culture and Viral Infection—Autaptic cultures of neonatal synaptotagmin-deficient mice hippocampal neurons were prepared as described previously (53Pyott S.J. Rosenmund C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 539: 523-535Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Briefly, islands of substrate (polylysine/collagen) were applied with a stamp containing regularly spaced squares (200 × 200 μm). Astrocytes (5,000/cm2) were preplated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. As soon as astrocytes reached confluence, 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine was added (10 μm) to inhibit overgrowth of the astrocytes. Before neurons were plated at a density of 500/cm2, the medium was replaced with serum-free medium (Neurobasal medium A supplemented with B27). Islands containing single neurons were examined after 10–15 days growth in culture. Successfully transfected neurons were detected by development of eGFP-based fluorescence, resulting from internal ribosome entry site (IRES) driven expression of the green fluorescent protein. We compared expression levels of WT and synaptotagmin 1KAKA overexpression levels by analyses of transfection efficiency and using Western blot analyses. Transfection efficiency after 15 h was 70–80% in both wild-type synaptotagmin as well as synaptotagmin 1KAKA-transfected cultures. Neurons with viral infection of 15–20 h resulted in the highest rescue efficiency. Western blot analysis was performed from high density cultures from neurons (200,000 neurons/20 cm2/15 days in vitro) that were transfected 15 h prior to harvesting of the proteins. Equal amounts of proteins (10 μg) were used for SDS-PAGE and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane. The viral expressed synaptotagmin 1 was probed with a monoclonal mouse anti-synaptotagmin 1 antibody (1:5,000; clone 41.1, Synaptic Systems, Göttingen, Germany) and the endogenous expressed synaptobrevin 2 with a polyclonal rabbit anti-synaptobrevin 2 antibody (1:10000, Synaptic Systems, Göttingen, Germany). Blots were developed using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000, Amersham Biosciences) together with the ECL™ Western blotting detection reagent. Semiquantitative estimates for synaptotagmin 1 overexpression were obtained by normalizing the densitometric Western blot signals against the densitometric signal from endogenous synaptobrevin 2. The degree of synaptotagmin overexpression for synaptotagmin wild-type and synaptoatagmin 1KAKA was comparable in both groups (approximately 4–6-fold, three independent experiments). Patch-pipette solutions contained (in mm): 120 KCl, 20 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 4.6 MgCl2, 4 K2-ATP, 15 creatine phosphate, 50 units ml–1 phosphocreatine kinase (300 mosm, pH 7.3). The extracellular saline solution contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 2.4 KCl, 10 HEPES, 10 glucose, 4 CaCl2, and 4 MgCl2 except otherwise noted (305 mosm, pH 7.3). All chemicals, except for 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoylbenzo(f)-quinoxaline (NBQX) and tetrodotoxin (Tocris, Bristol, UK), were purchased from Sigma. All solutions were applied using a fast flow system at room temperature (53Pyott S.J. Rosenmund C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2002; 539: 523-535Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar).Electrophysiology—Cells were whole cell voltage-clamped at –70 mV with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments) under the control of Clampex 8.0 (Axon Instruments) program. Excitatory postsynaptic currents were evoked by somatic depolarization to 0 mV for 2 ms. The readily releasable pool was determined by integrating the transient inward current component evoked by 4-s application of external solution added with 500 mm sucrose. Miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) were measured in 300 nm tetrodotoxin. For the determination of apparent Ca2+ sensitivity of EPSC amplitudes, EPSCs were recorded in Ca2+ concentrations varying from 0.5 to 12 mm in presence of 1 mm Mg2+ and were subsequently normalized to EPSC recorded intermittently at standard conditions (4 mm Ca2+, 4 mm Mg2+). Data were low pass-filtered at 1 or 5 kHz and stored at either 10 or 20 kHz. The series resistance was compensated to 70–90%. Only cells with series resistances below 15 MOhm were analyzed. Data were analyzed with software Axograph 4.6 and Kaleidagraph 3.0 running on a Mac OS X system. Statistical significance was tested using student's t test; *** and ** in Figs. 4 and 6 indicate t test values of p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively. All values are presented as the mean ± S.E.FIGURE 6Synaptic properties of the three synaptotagmin (syt) 1 basic residue mutants (synaptotagmin 1R233Q, synaptotagmin 1K366Q, and synaptotagmin 1KAKA) and WT.

HEPES buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, and 4 mm EGTA) containing 0.5 m sucrose was added to the dried lipid layer, vortexed for 20 min, and sonicated for 5 min in a bath sonicator (model G112SP1G; Laboratory Supply Co. Inc.). After liposome formation, 4 volumes of HEPES buffer without sucrose were added and centrifuged to separate heavy liposomes from free phospholipids (100,000 × g for 30 min). Heavy liposomes were washed once and repelleted (20,800 × g for 10 min). Recombinant wild-type or mutant forms of GST-synaptotagmin 1-C2A/B proteins (10 μg) were mixed with 100 μg of liposomes in the presence of different concentrations of free Ca2+ calculated with EqCal software (Biosoft, Ferguson, MI). After 10-min incubation of total 1-ml reaction mixture on an Eppendorf thermal mixer at 30 °C and 800 rpm, liposomes were re-isolated by centrifugation (20,800 × g for 10 min) and washed three times with 1 ml of the corresponding buffers. Chloroform:methanol (1:2, v/v) solution was added into the pelleted liposomes to denature protein and dissolve lipids. After centrifugation (20,800 × g for 15 min), the protein precipitate was resuspended in 30 μl of 2× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining (7Fernandez I. Arac D.

The spectra and the Ca2+-induced cross-peak shifts observed for the KAKA mutant of the C2B domain were very similar to those observed for the wild-type C2B domain, demonstrating that the synaptotagmin 1KAKA mutation does not induce major structural perturbations in the C2B domain or impair its ability to bind Ca2+.FIGURE 1The KAKA mutation does not affect the proper folding of the C2B domain. The diagrams show 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the wild-type (A) and KAKA mutant (B) synaptotagmin 1 C2B domain in 1 mm EDTA (black contours) or 20 mm Ca2+ (red contours).

Consistent with this spatial separation, the polybasic region was found to bind to phosphatidylinositides in a Ca2+-independent. but not Ca2+-dependent. manner (11Bai J. Tucker W.C. Chapman E.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 36-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 33Mehrotra B. Myszka D.G. Prestwich G.D. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9679-9686Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, both synaptotagmin 1 C2 domains (and other C2 domains) are known to bind in a Ca2+-dependent manner to all negatively charged phospholipids, including phosphatidylinositides (9Zhang X. Rizo J. Südhof T.C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12395-12403Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To explore the relation between Ca2+-dependent and -independent binding of phosphoinositides to the C2B domain, we systematically examined the role of the polybasic region. In these studies, we employed recombinant fragments containing both C2 domains (the C2AB domain fragment) instead of isolated C2 domains because the effects of mutations on the biochemical properties of the individual C2 domains may not reflect their effects on the normally present double C2 domain configuration (e.g. Ref. 25Fernandez-Chacon R. Shin O.H. Konigstorfer A. Matos M.F. Meyer A.C. Garcia J. Gerber S.H. Rizo J. Sudhof T.C. Rosenmund C. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 8438-8446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We produced recombinant C2 domain proteins under conditions that minimize bacterial non-proteinaceous contaminations bound to the polybasic region (34Ubach J. Lao Y. Fernandez I. Arac D. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5854-5860Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) and compared the properties of the wild-type C2AB domain fragment with those of mutant C2AB domains containing either the KAKA substitution in the C2B domain or the R233Q substitution in the C2A domain. The latter mutation was used because it decreases the apparent Ca2+ affinity of the C2AB domain fragment and thus serves as a control for changes in apparent Ca2+ affinity (1Fernandez-Chacon R. Konigstorfer A. Gerber S.H. Garcia J. Matos M.F. Stevens C.F. Brose N. Rizo J. Rosenmund C. Sudhof T.C. Nature. 2001; 410: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar).We performed Ca2+ titrations to compare the effects of the R233Q and KAKA mutations on the Ca2+ dependence of phospholipid binding in the presence of increasing concentrations of PIP and PIP2. In addition, we also studied the effects of Mg2+ on these properties because Mg2+ may bind to PIP and PIP2. In these experiments, we employed a centrifugation assay that yields more reliable results than standard GST pulldown assays (7Fernandez I. Arac D. Ubach J. Gerber S.H. Shin O. Gao Y. Anderson R.G.

Neurosc. 2002; 5: 649-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The phospholipid vesicles used in these experiments contained a mixture of PC, PS, PE, PI, and cholesterol that corresponds to the reported phospholipid composition of synaptic vesicle membranes (36Benfenati F. Greengard P. Brunner J. Bahler M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1851-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 37Deutsch J.W. Kelly R.B.

Small, incremental amounts of PIP and PIP2 were added to mimic those that are likely to be present in vivo, based on the estimation that phosphoinositides constitute 5% of the synaptic membrane lipids and that these phosphoinositides are composed of: 80–90% PI, 5–10% PIP, 2–5% PIP2, and less than 0.5% of other phosphoinositides (38Fruman D.A.

Kim Y.M. Standaert D.G. Hersch S.M. Mouradian M.M. Young A.B. Tanese N. Krainc D. Science. 2002; 296: 2238-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), we have also demonstrated that blocking Sp1 using mithramycin A dramatically prolonged survival in a mouse model of HD (20Ferrante R.J. Ryu H. Kubilus J.K. D'Mello S. Sugars K.L. Lee J. Lu P. Smith K. Browne S. Beal M.F. Kristal B.S. Stavrovskaya I.G. Hewett S. Rubinsztein D.C. Langley B. Ratan R.R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10335-10342Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Thus, the negative effects of mutant huntingtin on Sp1 function may be outweighed by the beneficial effects of suppressing Sp1 in HD models. In resolve this paradox, we examined the role of endogenous Sp1 in the neurotoxicity found in three models: 1) Htt inducible neuronal cell lines (PC12 cells) expressing either normal or mutant Htt, 2) neurodegeneration induced by mutant Htt or 3-NP in vitro, and 3) in vivo, using primary neurons and mice obtained by crossing Sp1 heterozygous knock-out and R6/2 or N171-82Q transgenic mouse models of HD. We found that Sp1 is induced by 3-NP as well as by the presence of mutant Htt in vitro and in vivo. Toxicity caused by mutant Htt or 3-NP was correlated with increased Sp1 levels in the nucleus. Pharmacologic and genetic interference of Sp1 using mithramycin A, or RNA interference (RNAi) eliminated cellular toxicity induced by either 3-NP or mutant Htt. Moreover, Sp1 RNAi's protective effects correlated with the down regulated mutant Htt levels. We also found that knocking down Sp1 was neuroprotective in both primary striatal neurons as well as mice derived from the crosses. A trend toward a reduction in mutant huntingtin transgene expression in the double mutant mice could partially explain the observed prolonged survival of HD mice. These studies suggest that up-regulation of Sp1 occurs in response to mutant huntingtin and that down-regulation of Sp1 is neuroprotective. Cell Culture—PC12 cell lines containing an ecdysone-inducible protein fused with the first 17 amino acids of Htt plus 103 or 25 glutamines tagged with GFP at the C terminus (21Apostol B.L.

The cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum, 10% horse serum, 100 μm penicillin-streptomycin, 2 mg/ml Gentecin®, and 1 mg/ml zeocin (all from Invitrogen). Polyglutamine expression was induced with 2.5 μm ponasterone. Striatal neuronal cultures were prepared from Sp1 heterozygous knock-out mice (22Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) (kindly provided by Dr. Sjaak Philipsen, Erasmus University Rotterdam. The Netherlands) crossed with R6/2 or N171-82Q transgenic mice, and from wild-type littermate controls. Striatal neurons from 16-day-old embryonic mice with different genetic backgrounds were isolated by our previous enzyme treatment protocol (23Qiu Z. Hyman B. Rebeck G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279 (Epub 32004 May 34928): 34948-34956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Briefly, striata were dissociated in calcium-free saline and plated on poly-d-lysine (Sigma)-coated tissue culture dishes at a density of 106 cell/ml. The neurons were grown in Neurobasal Media (Invitrogen) plus 10% fetal bovine serum with 25 μm penicillin-streptomycin. One hour after plating, medium with serum was replaced with medium containing B-27 supplement (Invitrogen). All cells were grown in humidified 5% CO2 incubators for less than 2 weeks. Animal Studies—Sp1 heterozogous knock-out mice (Sp1+/–) (22Marin M. Karis A. Visser P. Grosveld F. Philipsen S. Cell. 1997; 89: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) were cross-bred with two distinct transgenic mouse models of HD, N171-82Q and R6/2 lines. The N171-82Q HD transgenic mice (line 81) express 82 CAG repeats within exon 1 and 2 of the HD gene driven by the mouse prion promoter (24Schilling G. Becher M.W. Sharp A.H. Jinnah H.A. Duan K. Kotzuk J.A. Slunt H.H. Ratovitski T. Cooper J.K. Jenkins N.A. Copeland N.G. Price D.L. Ross C.A. Borchelt D.R. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 397-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The R6/2 mice express exon 1 of the human HD gene with ∼150 CAG repeats (25Mangiarini L. Sathasivam K. Seller M. Cozens B. Harper A. Hetherington C. Lawton M. Trottier Y. Lehrach H. Davies S.W. Bates G.P. Cell. 1996; 87: 493-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2564) Google Scholar). All of the mice are maintained on a B6CBA background. DNA from each mouse or embryo (for neuronal cultures) was analyzed by PCR to determine its genotype. Survival analysis was performed in wild-type, N171-82Q, R6/2, and in both transgenic lines cross-bred with Sp1 heterozogous knock-out mice. For the survival study in R6/2 line, there were 5 male WT, 5 female WT, 5 male Sp1+/–, 5 female Sp1+/–, 3 male HD+/–, 5 female HD+/–, 5 male Sp1+/– HD+/–, and 4 female Sp1+/– HD+/–. For the N171-82Q there were 3 male WT, 4 female WT, 9 male Sp1+/–, 12 female Sp1+/–, 12 male HD+/–, 10 female HD+/–, 14 male Sp1+/– HD+/–, and 9 female Sp1+/– HD+/–. All experiments were carried out in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and the Use of Laboratory Animals and the Massachusetts General Hospital IACUC. The mice were weighed weekly starting from 28 days of age and continued for the duration of their life span. Mouse survival was assessed for mortality twice daily, early morning and late afternoon, as previously reported (26Ferrante R.J. Kubilus J.K. Lee J. Ryu H. Beesen A. Zucker B. Smith K. Kowall N.W. Ratan R.R. Luthi-Carter R. Hersch S.M. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9418-9427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mice were euthanized upon reaching criteria for morbidity. Deaths occurring overnight were recorded the next morning. Neurotoxicity Assay—A standard lactate dehydrogenase assay (LDH kit, Roche Applied Science) (27Koh J.Y. Choi D.W. J. Neurosci.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 10445-10456Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the MTT assay (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5,diphenyltetrazolium bromide; Sigma) (29Qiu Z. Gruol D.L. J. Neuroimmunol. 2003; 139: 51-57Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) were adapted in this study. The LDH assay measures lysed cells, and the MTT assay estimates viable cells. Neurotoxicity was concurrently examined from supernatant for LDH and cells for MTT. Two independent assays in each cell culture set were performed for confirmation. For studies involving 3-NP (Sigma), the PC12 cells and the primary striatal neurons were treated with 3-NP for 4 h, both with and without pretreatment (i.e. mithramycin A for 24 h prior to 3-NP). For both the LDH and MTT assays, results from each culture set were normalized to the appropriate control values for the culture set and then combined. Immunohistochemical and Htt Aggregate Analysis—PC12 cell cultures were washed, fixed, and then immunostained for 15–24 h at 4 °C using anti-Sp1 rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Sp1 antibody was detected with anti-rabbit Ig and Cy3-linked whole antibody. Htt aggregates were examined by eGFP fluorescence after 2.5 μm ponasterone induction for 24 h. For primary striatal neurons, mutant Htt (polyglutamine expansion, 37 Gln) and Sp1 antibodies were detected with fluorescein-linked anti-mouse Ig and Cy3-linked anti-rabbit Ig. Htt aggregates in HD mice brain were examined by immunocytochemistry using EM48 polyclonal antibody by the method reported previously (2Dunah A.W. Jeong H. Griffin A. Kim Y.M. Standaert D.G. Hersch S.M. Mouradian M.M. Young A.B. Tanese N. Krainc D. Science. 2002; 296: 2238-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Mice were perfused with 3.0% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde. Brains were removed and postfixed overnight in 2% paraformaldehyde. Sections were stained with EM48 polyclonal antibody (1:2000) to detect the presence of aggregates. Immunoreactivity was detected after 48 h via an immunoperoxidase reaction using the Vectastain Elite Kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Starting from the most rostral segment of the neostriatum in the mouse forebrain, 50 μm coronal tissue sections were serially cut using a vibratome (Series 1500, St Louis, MO). Every tenth section was collected through the anterior commissure. Aggregate formation was characterized by stereology measuring nuclear aggregates alone or total aggregate burden, including neuropil and nuclear aggregates. First, using StereoInvestigator software (MicroBrightField, Williston, VT) and a Leica DMLB microscope, the volume of striatum was estimated by the Cavalieri principle (30Nurcombe V. Wreford N.G. Bertram J.F. Methods Mol. Biol. 2001; 169: 251-268PubMed Google Scholar). The number and volume of EM48-positive nuclear aggregates was analyzed using the Nucleator (31Gundersen H.J. J. Microsc. 1988; 151: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar) in each cortex and striatum section. In a second procedure, EM48-positive Htt aggregate images from selected microscopic fields were captured with a CCD camera (Hamamatsu, Hamamatsu City, Japan) and digitized by computer with Openlab software (Heideberg-Wiebingen, Germany). Total Htt aggregate burden from the cortex and striatum, each obtained from four R6/2 mice and four R6/2 crossed with Sp1 heterozygous knock-out mice, was quantified using NIH Image (particle analysis) via unbiased measurement of the number and size (area) after selecting threshold (>1 μm). All computer-identified cell profiles in each cross-sectional area were normalized to the related brain region of R6/2 mice and then pooled for statistic analysis. Western Blot—Neuronal cultures and mouse brain tissue were lysed or homogenized in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.05 m NaCl, 4 μm leupeptin, 2 μm pepstatin, 1.5 μm aprotinin, 400 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Triton-X. Equal amounts of protein were analyzed for Sp1 and mutant Htt by immunoblot analysis. Briefly, proteins were denatured, reduced, and separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After transfer to nitrocellulose membrane, proteins were probed with polyclonal antibodies against Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechology), GFP (Invitrogen), or polyglutamine expansion (37 Gln) (Chemicon Int., Inc., Temecula, CA). From the same blots, actin (AC-40; Sigma) was detected by a specific monoclonal antibody to assure that equal protein was present in each lane. Immunoreactivity was detected using a horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody and chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Analyses, with a Bio-Rad GS-700 Imaging densitometer, were recorded as percentages of the sister cultures or control mouse brains. Sp1 RNA Interference—Rat Sp1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) (sense/antisense), 5′-agccuugaaguguagcuau-3′/5′-auagcuacacuucaaggcu-3′, was used to target the Sp1 sequence aaagccuugaaguguagcuau. The sequences of Sp1 target-specific siRNA duplexes were designed according to the manufacturer's recommendation and subjected to a BLAST search against the rat genome sequence to ensure that no endogenous genes of the genome were targeted. Lipofectamine-mediated transient transfections of Sp1 siRNA were performed. After 48 h, the transfected cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and analyzed by Western blot to probe the Sp1 gene expression. Moreover, cell viability in the transfected cells was concurrently assessed in order to confirm the inhibition of Sp1 function by siRNA. Quantitative PCR—RNA isolated from primary striatal neurons, and mouse brains were extracted according to the manufacturer's instruction (RNeasy from Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Reverse transcription of RNA was conducted with a SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR studies used a Bio-Rad iCycler to follow the amplification of cDNA products through PCR cycles. Cycle parameters were 1 min at 95 °C, then 50 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. Primers used (upper/lower) were Sp1 (5′-aatttgcctgccctgagtgc-3′/5′-ttggacccatgctaccttgc-3′), human Htt (L34020) (5′-agatggacggccgctcaggtt-3′/5′-tcatcagcttttccagggtcgccat-3′), and murine β-actin (X03672) (5′-aggtatcctgaccctgaag-3′/5′-gctcattgtagaaggtgtgg-3′). Relative expression levels for each target were normalized to β-actin using the 2–ΔCT method (32Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (121290) Google Scholar). Data Analysis—Data from several cultures or brains were pooled for statistical analyses. Values are expressed as mean ± S.E. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Fisher post hoc test for multiple comparisons determined statistical significance. Animal survival data were analyzed using the Mantel-Cox log-rank test (33Dietz K. Gail M. Krickeberg K. Singer B. Survival Analysis: A Self Learning Text. 1996; (Springer, New York): 83-128Google Scholar) and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The survival curves were adjusted for sex since there were a slightly different number of males and females in each group. p < 0.05 was considered indicative of a statistically significant difference. Mutant Htt Protein Increases Sp1 Levels—Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that Htt aggregates and Sp1 levels were substantially enhanced with ponasterone induction of Htt expression in PC12 cells, particularly in the nucleus (Fig. 1A). Western blot analysis further demonstrated increased levels of Sp1 in HttQ103 cells (by 45% p < 0.05, Fig. 1B), suggesting that HttQ103 may be directly or indirectly involved in the alterations of Sp1 levels. 3-NP treatment in HttQ25 and HttQ103 cells substantially increased Sp1 levels; PC12/HttQ103 cells showed a 79% increase and PC12/HttQ25 cells showed a 34% increase, p < 0.05, Fig. 1B. Such enhancement was also obtained from WT mouse brains administrated 3-NP at the dose of 55 mg/kg, twice a day for 10 days (by 68%, p < 0.05, Fig. 1C), indicating that the Sp1 levels are both mutant Htt and 3-NP inducible in CNS. Additional results showed increased Sp1 levels in primary striatal neuronal cultures isolated from R6/2 (by 152%) and N181-82Q (by 122%) transgenic mice (Fig. 1D). Co-localization of mutant Htt (polyglutamine expansion, 37 Gln) with Sp1 was also observed in the nucleus of primary striatal neurons isolated from R6/2 mice (Fig. 1D). The DNA binding capacity of Sp1, detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, was also enhanced in R6/2 mouse brains (Fig. S1 in supplemental data) corresponding with the increased Sp1 protein levels (by 89%, Fig. 1E) and indicating enhanced Sp1 activity. It has also been reported that Sp1 levels are increased in human brain in the early stages of HD (2Dunah A.W. Jeong H. Griffin A. Kim Y.M. Standaert D.G. Hersch S.M. Mouradian M.M. Young A.B. Tanese N. Krainc D. Science. 2002; 296: 2238-2243Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of mutant Htt corresponds both in vitro and in vivo with increased Sp1 levels and DNA binding. Sp1 Helps Mediate Mutant Htt-associated Neuronal Cell Death—3-NP, an irreversible inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase, causes pathology resembling HD in vivo (34Beal M.F. Brouillet E. Jenkins B.G. Ferrante R.J. Kowall N.W. Miller J.M. Storey E. Srivastava R. Rosen B.R. Hyman B.T. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 4181-4192Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under baseline conditions neither HttQ25 nor HttQ103 cells exhibited detectable cell death, represented as normalized LDH release. Although 3-NP significantly increased cell death in both groups, PC12 cells expressing HttQ103 were more sensitive to 3-NP treatment (Fig. 2A), corresponding to HttQ expression (data not shown). When the dose-dependent effects of 3-NP were examined in both HttQ25 and HttQ103 cells, the dose response curve significantly shifted upward for the HttQ103-expressing cells (Fig. 2B), which suggests that HttQ103 sensitizes neuronal cells to 3-NP toxicity. To examine Sp1 function in the presence of mutant Htt, we tested the effects of pharmacological and genetic inhibition of Sp1 using mithramycin A and Sp1 RNAi, respectively. Mithramycin A is an aureolic antibiotic that selectively inhibits gene expression by blocking Sp1 binding to G-C-rich regions of promoters. We tested the effects of mithramycin A on neuronal cell death in both HttQ25 and HttQ103 cells in the presence of 3-NP treatment. 3-NP induced cell toxicity was completely abolished by mithramycin A (100 nm) in both HttQ25 (Fig. 2C) and HttQ103 cells (Fig. 2D). Mithramycin A decreased 3-NP toxicity in a dose-dependent manner in both HttQ25 and HttQ103 cells. Significantly greater protective effects of mithramycin A from 3-NP (20Ferrante R.J. Ryu H. Kubilus J.K. D'Mello S. Sugars K.L. Lee J. Lu P. Smith K. Browne S. Beal M.F. Kristal B.S. Stavrovskaya I.G. Hewett S. Rubinsztein D.C. Langley B. Ratan R.R. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10335-10342Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) were obtained in HttQ103 cells (data not shown). In fact, no detectable changes in Sp1 levels were observed in mithramycin A-treated HttQ103 cells (Fig. 2E), consistent with the role of mithramycin A as a functional blocker of Sp1. Given that mithramycin A might affect other pathways in addition to Sp1, we also assessed Sp1 function using Sp1 RNAi. Because HttQ103 cells are stressed by the transfection procedures, considerable neuronal cell death was present in mock siRNA transfection. No detectable differences in cell death were obtained between blank transfection and scrambled sequence siRNA transfection (mock siRNA control). Sp1 RNAi eliminated this neuronal cell death induced by HttQ103 (Fig. 2F). In the presence of siRNA, Sp1 levels were significantly decreased (Fig. 2G) as measured by Western analysis (by 36% in HttQ25 cells and by 51% in HttQ103 cells), and the increase in Sp1 levels caused by 3-NP treatment (Fig. 1B) was eliminated (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the alterations in cellular toxicity observed in Fig. 2A corresponded with Sp1 gene expression. Sp1 RNAi also significantly decreased the expression of HttQ103 (Fig. 2H) detected by Western blot using antibody against GFP (by 74%, p < 0.05). There was no significant potentiation when mithramycin was applied to the PC12/HttQ25 cell transfected with Sp1 siRNA (data not shown), suggesting that Sp1 RNAi and mithramycin affect a common action site. Taken together, our data suggest that either blocking Sp1-driven gene expression by mithramycin A or inhibiting Sp1 gene expression by Sp1 RNAi both diminish HttQ103 and 3-NP-associated neuronal cell death. Sp1 Gene Knock-down Ameliorates Neurodegeneration in Striatal Neurons Isolated from HD Transgenic Mice—To determine whether Sp1 plays an important role in neurodegeneration in HD, primary striatal neurons from WT, Sp1 heterozygous knock-out, HD transgenic, and Sp1 heterozygous knock-out mice crossed with HD transgenic mice were examined as shown in Fig. 3. Neurons obtained from 16-day-old WT mice had distinctive morphological changes during the culture period (Fig. 3A). During the first day, cells have a rounded shape in culture, are attached to the substrate, and initiate process outgrowth. Prominent neurite outgrowth and synapse formation are observed by 7 DIV with the length and numbers of neurites increasing with culture age; by 10 DIV, they are relative stable. Neurons isolated from HD transgenic (R6/2 and N171-82Q), Sp1 heterozygous knock-out, and HD transgenic cross-bred with Sp1 heterozygous knock-out mice displayed similar morphologic developmental pattern as WT neurons during the culture period. The time course of neurodegeneration in primary neurons was examined (Fig. 3B). Considerable differences in neuronal death between WT and R6/2 neurons were observed at 5 DIV and persisted until 8 DIV. For subsequent experiments, neurodegeneration was examined at 8 DIV, because at this time point the difference in neuronal death between WT and R6/2 neurons is substantial and maintained. The neurodegeneration occurring in primary striatal neurons from each genetic background was examined under baseline (Fig. 3C) and 3-NP-treated conditions (Fig. 3D). Under b"
https://openalex.org/W2069988713,"We have previously shown that the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT1) is expressed and functional in the mitochondrial membrane and that this expression enhances the mitochondrial toxicity of the nucleoside drug, fialuridine (FIAU) (Lai, Y., Tse, C. M., and Unadkat, J. D. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 4490-4497). Here we report on identification of the mitochondrial targeting sequence of hENT1. Using confocal microscopy and different truncated and point mutants of hENT1-YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, we identified amino acid residues Pro(71),Glu(72), and Asn(74) (the PEXN motif) of hENT1 as important in mitochondrial targeting of hENT1. Identification of this mitochondrial targeting sequence provides a possible explanation for the dramatic difference in mitochondrial toxicity of FIAU between humans and rodents. Although the mouse ENT1 (mENT1), expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, can transport FIAU, confocal microscopy showed that mENT1-GFP (green fluorescent protein) was not localized to the mitochondria. Consistent with this observation, mitochondria isolated from mouse livers did not transport FIAU. Sequence alignment of hENT1, mENT1, and rat ENT1 (rENT1) showed that the PEXN motif of hENT1 was substituted with a PAXS motif in both mENT1 and rENT1. Substitution of PAXS in mENT1 with PEXN (to create mENT1-PEXN-GFP) and of PEXN in hENT1 with PAXS (to create hENT1-PAXS-YFP) resulted in partial mitochondrial localization of mENT1-PEXN-GFP and loss of mitochondrial localization of hENT1-PAXS-YFP. This is the first time that the mitochondrial targeting signal of hENT1 has been identified. Our data suggest that the lack of mitochondrial toxicity of FIAU in mice is due to the lack of mENT1 targeting to and expression in the mitochondria."
https://openalex.org/W2155305990,"IRAK-4 is a protein kinase that is pivotal in mediating signals for innate immune responses. Here, we report that IRAK-4 signaling is also essential for eliciting adaptive immune responses. Thus, in the absence of IRAK-4, in vivo T cell responses were significantly impaired. Upon T cell receptor stimulation, IRAK-4 is recruited to T cell lipid rafts, where it induces downstream signals, including protein kinase Cθ activation through the association with Zap70. This signaling pathway was found to be required for optimal activation of nuclear factor κB. Our findings suggest that T cells use this critical regulator of innate immunity for the development of acquired immunity, suggesting that IRAK-4 may be involved in direct signal cross talk between the two systems."
https://openalex.org/W2037388166,"Cells possess several Ca2+-mobilizing messengers, which couple stimulation at the cell surface by a multitude of extracellular cues to the regulation of intracellular Ca2+-sensitive targets. Recent studies suggest that agonists differentially select from this molecular palette to generate their characteristic Ca2+ signals but it is still unclear whether different messengers mediate different functions or whether they act in a redundant fashion. In this study, we compared the effects of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), a novel Ca2+-mobilizing messenger, with that of the prototypical messenger inositol trisphosphate on cytosolic Ca2+ levels and differentiation status of PC12 cells. We demonstrate that liposomal delivery of NAADP mediated release of Ca2+ from acidic Ca2+ stores and that this stimulus was sufficient to drive differentiation of the cells to a neuronal-like phenotype. In sharp contrast, cell fate was unaffected by more transient Ca2+ signals generated by inositol trisphosphate-evoked release of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores. Our data establish for the first time (i) the presence of novel NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ stores in PC12 cells, (ii) a role for NAADP in differentiation, and (iii) that Ca2+-dependent function can be messenger-specific. Thus, differential recruitment of intracellular Ca2+-mobilizing messengers and their target Ca2+ stores may represent a robust means of maintaining stimulus fidelity in the control of Ca2+-dependent cell function. Cells possess several Ca2+-mobilizing messengers, which couple stimulation at the cell surface by a multitude of extracellular cues to the regulation of intracellular Ca2+-sensitive targets. Recent studies suggest that agonists differentially select from this molecular palette to generate their characteristic Ca2+ signals but it is still unclear whether different messengers mediate different functions or whether they act in a redundant fashion. In this study, we compared the effects of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP), a novel Ca2+-mobilizing messenger, with that of the prototypical messenger inositol trisphosphate on cytosolic Ca2+ levels and differentiation status of PC12 cells. We demonstrate that liposomal delivery of NAADP mediated release of Ca2+ from acidic Ca2+ stores and that this stimulus was sufficient to drive differentiation of the cells to a neuronal-like phenotype. In sharp contrast, cell fate was unaffected by more transient Ca2+ signals generated by inositol trisphosphate-evoked release of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores. Our data establish for the first time (i) the presence of novel NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ stores in PC12 cells, (ii) a role for NAADP in differentiation, and (iii) that Ca2+-dependent function can be messenger-specific. Thus, differential recruitment of intracellular Ca2+-mobilizing messengers and their target Ca2+ stores may represent a robust means of maintaining stimulus fidelity in the control of Ca2+-dependent cell function. Changes in cytosolic Ca2+ drive numerous cellular events (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar) perhaps the most striking example being the activation of the quiescent egg at fertilization resulting ultimately in the generation of highly differentiated cell types. Given the remarkable multifunctional role of Ca2+, stringent mechanisms must exist within the cell to prevent inappropriate activation of Ca2+-sensitive targets. Precise organization of Ca2+ signals both temporally and spatially are likely such mechanisms (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar). Ca2+ signals are often in the form of oscillations, the frequency of which has profound effects on Ca2+-dependent output (2Gu X. Spitzer N.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar, 3Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I.

Whitney M. Zlokarnik G. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1998; 392: 936-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar). Restriction of Ca2+ signals to particular subcellular locations also will ensure the activation of Ca2+ sensors only in that location (6Nelson M.T. Cheng H. Rubart M. Santana L.F. Bonev A.D. Knot H.J. Lederer W.J. Science. 1995; 270: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar, 7Tinel H. Cancela J.M. Mogami H. Gerasimenko J.V. Gerasimenko O. Tepikin A. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4999-5008Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). A full understanding of how these complex Ca2+ signals are generated is then vital to understand how Ca2+ controls cell function. Cytosolic Ca2+ signals are often generated by agonist-evoked increases in intracellular messengers and the subsequent activation of intracellular Ca2+ channels (1Berridge M.J. Lipp P. Bootman M.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 1: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (4493) Google Scholar). Inositol trisphosphate is the most ubiquitous of these messengers and is generated in response to a wide range of stimuli that include hormones, growth factors, and neurotransmitters (8Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). Accumulating evidence indicates that intracellular Ca2+ stores can also be mobilized by NAADP 2The abbreviations used are: NAADP, nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate; BAPTA-AM, 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester); GPN, glycyl-l-phenylalanine-β-naphthylamide.

Ca2+ release via this NADP metabolite is particularly intriguing because in many cells, NAADP appears to target novel acidic Ca2+ stores (15Churchill G.C. Okada Y. Thomas J.M. Genazzani A.A. Patel S.

Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Despite this physical segregation, activation of NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ channels is often coupled to activation of endoplasmic reticulum-based Ca2+ channels as evidenced by the sensitivity of NAADP-induced Ca2+ release in intact cells to inhibitors of inositol trisphosphate and/or ryanodine receptors (19Brailoiu E.

NAADP may therefore provide a “trigger” release of Ca2+, which is subsequently propagated by the process of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (21Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), although direct activation of ryanodine receptors (25Mojzisova A. Krizanova O. Zacikova L. Kominkova V. Ondrias K.

FASEB J. 2003; 13: 1907-1909Google Scholar) have been proposed as alternative mechanisms (see Refs. 13Galione A. Petersen O.H. Mol. Interv. 2005; 5: 73-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar and 30Patel S. Biol. Cell. 2004; 96: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar for discussion). It has been known for some time that different agonists evoke unique Ca2+ signals or “signatures” (31Petersen C.C. Toescu E.C. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The mechanistic basis of this heterogeneity however is not clear. One possibility is that different stimuli may recruit distinct combinations of intracellular messengers. Results of recent studies directly support this hypothesis. In pancreatic acinar cells and smooth muscle cells, desensitization of NAADP receptors or depletion of acidic Ca2+ stores attenuates Ca2+ signals in response to cholecystokinin (17Yamasaki M. Masgrau R. Morgan A.J. Churchill G.C. Patel S. Ashcroft S.J.H. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7234-7240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 21Cancela J.M. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Nature. 1999; 398: 74-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) and endothelin-1 (18Kinnear N.P. Boittin F.X. Thomas J.M. Galione A. Evans A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 54319-54326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), respectively. Importantly, these inhibitory effects are agonist-specific; in acinar cells for example neither acetylcholinenor bombesin-evoked Ca2+ signals are affected by similar treatments (32Cancela J.M. Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2549-2557Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 33Burdakov D. Galione A. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 993-996Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Accordingly, only cholecystokinin stimulates increases in NAADP levels (34Yamasaki M. Thomas J.T. Churchill G.C. Garnham C. Lewis A.L. Cancela J.M. Patel S. Galione A. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 874-878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Although specific combinations of intracellular messengers can indeed mimic the effect of extracellular stimuli on cytosolic Ca2+ levels (35Cancela J.M. Van Coppenolle F. Galione A. Tepikin A.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 909-919Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), functional correlates of messenger-evoked Ca2+ signals are lacking. Cell differentiation is a process that occurs not only during embryonic development but also in the adult during regeneration of many tissues. Indeed, the potential of stem cells to develop into different cell types has been the focus of much attention recently (36Eckfeldt C.E. Mendenhall E.M. Verfaillie C.M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 726-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Differentiation results because of specific changes in gene expression. Because several transcription factors including CREB (37Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar) and NF-AT (37Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar) are Ca2+-sensitive, Ca2+ is likely to be involved in the differentiation process. Indeed, buffering of cytosolic Ca2+ with Ca2+ chelators has been shown to prevent differentiation of several cell types including neurons (2Gu X. Spitzer N.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar), keratinocytes (38Li L. Tucker R.W. Hennings H. Yuspa S.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 163: 105-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), myocytes (39Ferrari M.B. Rohrbough J. Spitzer N.C. Dev. Biol. 1996; 178: 484-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), trophoblasts (40Wang J. Rout U.K. Bagchi I.C. Armant D.R. Development. 1998; 125: 4293-4302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and NB4 cells (41Berry D.M. Meckling-Gill K.A. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4779-4788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, imposing Ca2+ transients appears sufficient to drive neurotransmitter specification in embryonic Xenopus spinal neurons (2Gu X. Spitzer N.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Many studies have demonstrated changes in the Ca2+ signaling protein complement upon differentiation (for example see Ref. 42Reber B.F. Reuter H. J. Physiol. 1991; 435: 145-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), but whether these changes drive differentiation or are a consequence of altering cell fate is difficult to discern. In particular there is a surprising paucity of information concerning the role of intracellular Ca2+-mobilizing messengers in differentiation. Although ryanodine receptor-mediated Ca2+ signals have been implicated in the differentiation of skeletal myoblasts (43Seigneurin-Venin S. Parrish E. Marty I. Rieger F. Romey G. Villaz M. Garcia L. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 223: 301-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 44Pisaniello A. Serra C. Rossi D. Vivarelli E. Sorrentino V. Molinaro M. Bouche M. J.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 4127-4134Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and HL-60 cells (47Munshi C.B. Graeff R. Lee H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49453-49458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the latter via CD-38-mediated production of cADPR, an endogenous modulator of ryanodine receptors (48Lee H.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 317-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), direct evidence for inositol trisphosphate receptor involvement is scant. In keratinocytes, phospholipase C-γ1 is necessary for differentiation in response to physiologically relevant elevations in extracellular Ca2+ levels (49Xie Z. Bikle D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20421-20424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). What effect NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signals have on differentiation is not known. In the present study, using liposomes we have examined the direct effects of NAADP and inositol trisphosphate on modulating differentiation of PC12 cells, a rat pheochromocytoma cell line and a long standing model for neuronal differentiation (50Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4873) Google Scholar). We show that although both messengers evoke changes in cytosolic Ca2+, these signals are kinetically and mechanistically distinct and that NAADP-but not inositol trisphosphate-mediated Ca2+ increases are sufficient to cause differentiation. Cell Culture—PC12 cells were routinely maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin (all from Invitrogen) in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. The medium was changed every 72 h. Liposome Preparation—Liposomes were prepared using egg phosphatidylcholine (Sigma) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-ethylphosphocholine (Avanti Polar Lipids) at a 9:1 molar ratio (3 mg of lipid/ml of aqueous phase) as described previously (51Brailoiu E. Miyamoto M.D. Neuroscience. 2000; 95: 927-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 52Brailoiu E. Patel S. Dun N.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The aqueous phase was either buffer (140 mm KCl, pH 6.9) alone or buffer containing Lucifer yellow (10 mm), NAADP (1–100 μm), or IP3 (1–100 μm). Unincorporated constituents were removed by dialysis (Sigma dialysis sacs, molecular weight cut off of 12,400) against Hanks' balanced salt solution (for experiments using adherent cells) or RPMI 1640 medium (for culture experiments; 1:600 v/v, 150 min, solution changed every 30 min). Liposome Delivery—Both cells that had been attached to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and loosely adherent cells in culture were treated with liposomes (1:15 v/v dilution). For attached cells, the cells were superfused with Hanks' balanced salt solution supplemented with liposomes at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. For cells in culture, the cells were first serum-starved for 12 h, and then cell suspensions were incubated with liposomes in serum-free medium for 2 h with gentle agitation. Measurement of Lucifer Yellow Fluorescence—Adherent cells were superfused for 2 min with Lucifer yellow-containing liposomes. Unincorporated liposomes were removed by manual rinsing of the coverslips with Hanks' balanced salt solution, and the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Confocal fluorescence images (emission wavelength >520 nm) were captured following excitation at 425 nm. Measurement of NAADP Levels—NAADP levels were determined based on the method described previously (53Churamani D. Carrey E.A. Dickinson G.D. Patel S. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Suspensions of PC12 cells (5–10 × 106) that had been treated with liposomes were washed by brief centrifugation, and cell pellets were resuspended in two volumes of ice-cold 10% w/v trichloroacetic acid. After a 5-min incubation, the samples were centrifuged at 12,100 × g for 1 min, and the supernatants were recovered and neutralized by back extraction with water-saturated ether (5 × 1 ml) followed by addition of 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.2). The samples and known concentrations of NAADP were incubated with sea urchin egg homogenates (0.25% v/v) prepared as described previously (54Dickinson G.D. Patel S. Biochem. J. 2003; 375: 805-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) in binding buffer consisting of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 250 mm potassium gluconate, 250 mm N-methyl d-glucamine, and 1 mm MgCl2. Following a 1–2-h incubation, enzymatically prepared [32P]NAADP (55Patel S. Churchill G.C. Sharp T. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36495-36497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was added (0.5 nm) to saturate unoccupied NAADP receptors, and the incubations were filtered through glass fiber filters using a cell harvester to separate bound and free ligand. The radioactivity of the filters was determined by Cerenkov counting. The sensitivity of this assay is markedly enhanced by the addition of unlabeled NAADP before the radiolabel (53Churamani D. Carrey E.A. Dickinson G.D. Patel S. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This was necessary to detect NAADP levels in unstimulated cells. Measurement of Cytosolic Ca2+ Concentration—Cytosolic Ca2+ concentration measurements were performed as described previously (19Brailoiu E. Hoard J.L. Filipeanu C.M. Brailoiu G.C. Dun S.L. Patel S. Dun N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5646-5650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Attached cells were incubated with 4 μm Fura-2 AM (Molecular Probes) in Hanks' balanced salt solution at room temperature for 45 min in the dark, washed three times with dye-free buffer, and then incubated for a further 45 min to allow for complete de-esterification of the dye. The coverslips were subsequently mounted in a custom-designed bath on the stage of a S300 Axiovert Nikon inverted microscope equipped with a C & L Instruments fluorometer system. Cells were routinely superfused with Hanks' balanced salt solution at a flow rate of 2.5 ml/min except during liposome addition (see above). Fura-2 fluorescence (emission = 510 nm) following alternate excitation at 340 nm and 380 nm was acquired at a frequency of 20 Hz. Organelle Localization—For the localization of acidic compartments and the endoplasmic reticulum in the same cells, cells were incubated with a combination of Lysotracker Green (1 μm) and ER-Tracker Blue-White DPX (100 nm) for 15 min. Confocal fluorescence images of the dyes were captured following excitation at 488 nm (emission = 505–530 nm) and 364 nm (emission >385 nm), respectively, using a 63× objective. Acidic compartments were also localized using Lysotracker Red (1 μm, excitation = 543 nm, emission >620 nm) following a 1-h pretreatment with vehicle Me2SO (0.1% v/v), glycyl-l-phenylalanine-β-naphthylamide (GPN) (200 μm), or bafilomycin-A1 (1 μm). In these experiments, the magnification was increased to 100× and z stack images were captured. All dyes were from Molecular Probes. Differentiation—Cells suspensions were treated with liposomes (as described above) or nerve growth factor (100 ng/ml, 2 h) and then plated on to poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips in complete medium and cultured for 7 days. In some experiments, cells were incubated with BAPTA-AM (10 μm, 45 min) followed by three washes to remove the Ca2+ chelator, prior to liposome addition. Cells were fixed in freshly prepared 0.2% picric acid, 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. The coverslips were then blocked with 10% normal horse serum for 2 h and incubated sequentially with mouse monoclonal anti-tyrosine hydroxylase antibody (1:750; Chemicon International, Temecula, CA) for 4 h, biotinylated anti-mouse IgG (1:50, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h, and fluorescein Avidin D (Vector Laboratories) for 3 h. All dilutions were done in phosphate-buffered saline, and coverslips were rinsed several times between incubations. The coverslips were mounted in Citifluor (Ted Pella, Redding, CA) sealed, and confocal fluorescence images were captured using excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 520 nm, respectively. Cells were considered differentiated if neurite length exceeded that of the cell body. We have previously used liposomes to effect intracellular delivery of NAADP and other cell impermeant molecules into neuronal preparations (19Brailoiu E. Hoard J.L. Filipeanu C.M. Brailoiu G.C. Dun S.L. Patel S. Dun N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 5646-5650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 52Brailoiu E. Patel S. Dun N.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To demonstrate the effectiveness of the methodology in PC12 cells, we characterized delivery of the fluorescent marker Lucifer yellow (Fig. 1, A and B). Confocal imaging of cells that been attached to coverslips and superfused with Lucifer yellow-containing liposomes for 2 min revealed a uniform distribution of the dye throughout the cell (Fig. 1B, left). Little fluorescence was detected upon perfusion of cells with control liposomes prepared in the presence of buffer only (Fig. 1B, middle). These data clearly demonstrate that cytosolic delivery of liposomal constituents is achieved rapidly as reported (56Papadimitriou E. Antimisiaris S.G. J. Drug Target. 2000; 8: 335-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Extracellular application of the dye resulted in much weaker punctate fluorescence confined to the cell periphery (Fig. 1B, right) most likely reflecting endocytosis. To further quantify liposomal delivery, cell suspensions were incubated with liposomes encapsulating NAADP (100 μm), acid extracts were prepared, and NAADP content was measured using a radioreceptor assay (Fig. 1A). As shown in Fig. 1C, the concentration of NAADP in extracts from cells treated with NAADP-containing liposomes was markedly higher than in extracts from cells treated with control liposomes containing buffer alone. These data demonstrate that cellular levels of NAADP can be readily elevated in populations of PC12 cells in a non-invasive manner. Having established experimental conditions for the successful delivery of molecules into PC12 cells, we first characterized the effect of NAADP (100 μm) and inositol trisphosphate (100 μm) on cytosolic Ca2+ concentration (Fig. 2). Both messengers evoked robust cytosolic Ca2+ increases in attached cells loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator Fura-2 (Fig. 2A). Intriguingly, although the amplitude of Ca2+ signals in response to NAADP and inositol trisphosphate were similar, the kinetics of the evoked changes were quite different (Fig. 2A). Specifically, Ca2+ increases in response to NAADP were slower to peak and more sustained than those mediated by inositol trisphosphate. We quantified the time taken for the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration to peak and then return to 50% of its peak value following stimulation with each messenger. Intriguingly the latter “recovery index” for NAADP was nearly an order of magnitude greater than that for inositol trisphosphate (Fig. 2B). Clearly then, NAADP and inositol trisphosphate mediate kinetically different Ca2+ increases. We next examined the pharmacology of messenger-evoked Ca2+ signals. In these experiments, cells were transiently superfused with liposomes containing 100 μm NAADP (Fig. 3A) or 100 μm inositol trisphosphate (Fig. 3B). Under these conditions, the Ca2+ signals in response to the messengers receded upon washout of the liposomes most likely reflecting rapid metabolism upon termination of delivery. Importantly, control liposomes did not evoke any changes in cytosolic Ca2+ levels (Fig. 3, A and B). Prior incubation with thapsigargin, a sarcoendoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase inhibitor, which depletes endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores, reduced but did not abolish NAADP-evoked Ca2+ increases (Fig. 3A). Peak Ca2+ responses in response to NAADP after thapsigargin treatment were ∼50% of control responses (Fig. 3C). To probe the possible involvement of lysosomes in NAADP-mediated Ca2+ changes (15Churchill G.C. Okada Y. Thomas J.M. Genazzani A.A. Patel S. Galione A. Cell. 2002; 111: 703-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 17Yamasaki M. Masgrau R. Morgan A.J. Churchill G.C. Patel S. Ashcroft S.J.H. Galione A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 54319-54326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), we compared the effects of NAADP following osmotic lysis of these organelles with GPN, a cathepsin C substrate. GPN pretreatment abolished the effects of NAADP (Fig. 3, A and C). Essentially identical results were obtained with the V-type ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A1 which prevents organelle acidification (Fig. 3, A and C). In contrast to the effects of NAADP, inositol trisphosphate-evoked Ca2+ mobilization was completely blocked by thapsigargin and unaffected by pretreatment with GPN and bafilomycin A1 (Fig. 3, B and D). Results with the latter confirm the specificity of the inhibitors employed. Stimulation of cells with a lower concentration of either NAADP or inositol trisphosphate (1 μm) failed to significantly affect cytosolic calcium concentration (Fig. 3, C and D). We compared the distribution of acidic compartments and the endoplasmic reticulum in live PC12 cells. As shown in Fig. 4A, the acidic compartments tended to form perinuclear clusters, whereas the endoplasmic reticulum was more diffuse. Individual acidic vesicles could be resolved at higher magnification (Fig. 4B). When cells were pretreated with GPN or bafilomycin-A1, vesicular staining was abolished (Fig. 4B). Thus, these vesicles are strong candidates for NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ stores. Collectively the data in Figs. 2, 3, 4 suggest that NAADP-sensitive Ca2+ channels are expressed in PC12 cells and that they likely reside on acidic Ca2+ stores. These stores are readily distinguishable from those targeted by inositol trisphosphate thus confirming the original studies using sea urchin eggs (15Churchill G.C. Okada Y. Thomas J.M. Genazzani A.A. Patel S. Galione A. Cell. 2002; 111: 703-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The partial sensitivity of NAADP responses to thapsigargin may well be indicative of channel “chatter” (10Patel S. Churchill G.C. Galione A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 482-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) between NAADP receptors and endoplasmic reticulum-based Ca2+ channels. PC12 cells are a long standing model for neuronal differentiation that adopt a more neuronal-like phenotype in response to a variety of cues including neurotrophins such as nerve growth factor. To explore the role of intracellular Ca2+ stores in differentiation, we examined the effects of NAADP and inositol trisphosphate on the morphology of PC12 cells. In these experiments, cell suspensions were incubated for 2 h in the presence of control liposomes or liposomes containing either NAADP or inositol trisphosphate, and then cells were cultured (in the absence of liposomes) for 7 days. The effects of NAADP on cell morphology were dramatic. Remarkably, as shown in Fig. 5, NAADP differentiated a significant proportion of cells in the absence of trophic support. The observed phenotype was highly reminiscent of that following nerve growth factor treatment (Fig. 5A). In stark contrast, liposomes containing inositol trisphosphate had little affect on cell morphology (Fig. 5) despite the demonstrated ability of this messenger to evoke Ca2+ changes (Fig. 3, B and D). As expected, control liposomes did not induce differentiation (Fig. 5). A lower concentration of either NAADP or inositol trisphosphate (1 μm) were also without effect (Fig. 5B). To determine whether the effects of NAADP on cell morphology were Ca2+-dependent, we examined the effect of NAADP-containing liposomes in cells that had been loaded with the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA. Our loading conditions were optimized such that BAPTA completely prevented Ca2+-signals in response to both NAADP and inositol trisphosphate (data not shown). In BAPTA-treated cultures, NAADP did not affect cell fate (Fig. 5B). Importantly, this treatment did not compromise cell viability. Trypan blue staining indicated that 93 ± 2% of the cells were viable. Thus the Ca2+-dependent outcome in this particular scenario appears exquisitely sensitive to the Ca2+-mobilizing messenger. Although NAADP evokes changes in cytosolic Ca2+ concentration in many cells, little is known concerning its role in neurons and less still concerning downstream functional consequences. Here we have shown for the first time that mobilization of acidic lysosomal-like Ca2+ stores by NAADP is sufficient to mediate differentiation of a neuronal cell model. Combined with the ability of NAADP to modulate neurotransmission (52Brailoiu E. Patel S. Dun N.J. Biochem. J. 2003; 373: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 57Chameau P.

Trends Neurosci. 1999; 22: 488-495Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Indeed, receptors for NAADP are widespread in the mammalian brain (55Patel S. Churchill G.C. Sharp T. Galione A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36495-36497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and brain homogenates readily metabolize NAADP in a Ca2+-dependent fashion (60Berridge G. Cramer R. Galione A. Patel S. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The functional effects of NAADP-mediated Ca2+ signals on differentiation reported here are unprecedented and clearly highly specific because Ca2+ increases by inositol trisphosphate were unable to modify cell fate. The lack of effect of inositol trisphosphate on differentiation is consistent with a previous report using PC12 cells (61Das K.P. Freudenrich T.M. Mundy W.R. Neurotoxicol. Teratol. 2004; 26: 397-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). We propose that only sustained Ca2+ signals such as those evoked by NAADP are capable of initiating differentiation, whereas more transient ones mediated by inositol trisphosphate are not. Indeed, Ca2+-dependent gene transcription, which more than likely programs cellular change, is particularly well tuned to both temporal (3Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I.

Neurosci. 2001; 4: 565-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) subtleties in the Ca2+ signal. It is tempting to speculate that recruitment of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores by NAADP (as evidenced by the partial sensitivity of NAADP-mediated Ca2+ responses to thapsigargin; Fig. 3A) serves to prolong the resultant Ca2+ signal thereby determining functional outcome. Indeed our preliminary data show that cADPR can also induce differentiation of PC12 cells (data not shown) raising the possibility that NAADP and ryanodine receptors are functionally coupled. Blocking both inositol trisphosphate and ryanodine receptors prevents long term oscillations induced by NAADP in sea urchin eggs (65Churchill G.C. Galione A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) and potentiation of neurite length by NAADP in cortical neurons (19Brailoiu E. Hoard J.L. Filipeanu C.M. Brailoiu G.C. Dun S.L.

To conclude, we provide a clear example of different Ca2+ mobilizing messengers mediating quite different cellular responses likely through the generation of temporally distinct Ca2+ signals. Ca2+-dependent function may thus be tailored by selective recruitment of intracellular Ca2+-mobilizing messengers.

https://openalex.org/W2097573588,"Although patients with chronic renal failure are increasing worldwide, many aspects of kidney biology remain to be elucidated. Recent research has uncovered several molecular properties of the glomerular filtration barrier, in which podocytes, highly differentiated, ramified cells that enwrap the glomerular basement membrane, have been reported to be mainly responsible for filter's selectivity. We previously described that podocytes express Rab3A, a GTPase restricted to cell types that are capable of highly regulated exocytosis, such as neuronal cells. Here, we first demonstrate by a proteomic study that Rab3A in podocytes coimmmunoprecipitates with molecules once thought to be synapse specific. We then show that podocytes possess structures resembling synaptic vesicles, which contain glutamate, coexpress Rab3A and synaptotagmin 1, and undergo spontaneous and stimulated exocytosis and recycling, with glutamate release. Finally, from the results of a cDNA microarray study, we describe the presence of a series of neuron- and synapse-specific molecules in normal human glomeruli and confirm the glomerular protein expression of both metabotropic and ionotropic glutamate receptors. These data point toward a synaptic-like mechanism of communication among glomerular cells, which perfectly fits with the molecular composition of the glomerular filter and puts in perspective several previous observations, proposing a different working hypothesis for understanding glomerular signaling dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W2029337387,"Highly energized molecules normally are rapidly equilibrated by a solvent; this finding is central to the conventional (linear-response) view of how chemical reactions occur in solution. However, when a reaction initiated by 33-femtosecond deep ultraviolet laser pulses is used to eject highly rotationally excited diatomic molecules into alcohols and water, rotational coherence persists for many rotational periods despite the solvent. Molecular dynamics simulations trace this slow development of molecular-scale friction to a clearly identifiable molecular event: an abrupt liquid-structure change triggered by the rapid rotation. This example shows that molecular relaxation can sometimes switch from linear to nonlinear response."
https://openalex.org/W2050093300,"Fibroblasts and myofibroblasts both participate in wound healing. Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta) induces fibroblasts to differentiate into myofibroblasts, whereas fibroblast growth factor and heparin (FGF/h) induce myofibroblasts to ""de-differentiate"" into fibroblasts. TGFbeta induces expression of smooth muscle alpha actin (SMalphaA) and incorporation into in stress fibers, a phenotype of differentiated myofibroblasts. Additionally, TGFbeta induces the expression of fibronectin and fibronectin integrins. Fibronectin-generated signals contribute to the TGFbeta-mediated myofibroblast differentiation. Because fibronectin signals are transmitted through focal adhesion kinase (FAK), it was predicted that FAK would be essential to TGFbeta-mediated myofibroblast differentiation. To determine whether the FAK signaling pathway is required for myofibroblast differentiation, we used two approaches to decrease FAK in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs): 1) FAK +/+ MEFs, in which FAK protein expression was greatly decreased by short hairpin RNA (shRNA), and 2) FAK -/- MEFs, which lack FAK. In both cases, the majority of cells were myofibroblasts, expressing SMalphaA in stress fibers even after treatment with FGF/h. Furthermore, both the surface expression of FGFRs and FGF signaling were greatly reduced in FAK -/- [corrected]MEFs. We conclude that FAK does not contribute to TGFbeta-dependent myofibroblast differentiation. Instead, FAK was necessary for FGF/h signaling in down-regulating expression of SMalphaA, which is synonymous with myofibroblast differentiation. FAK activation could contribute to regulating myofibroblast differentiation, thereby ameliorating fibrosis."
https://openalex.org/W2068964404,"The major nonspecific porin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, OprF, produces a large channel yet allows only a slow diffusion of various solutes. Here we provide an explanation of this apparent paradox. We first show, by introduction of tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site in the middle of OprF protein, that most of OprF population folds as a two-domain protein with an N-terminal β-barrel domain and a C-terminal periplasmic domain rich in α-helices. However, sedimentation of unilamellar proteoliposomes through an iso-osmotic gradient showed that only about 5% of the OprF population produced open channels. Gel filtration showed that the open channel conformers tended to occur in oligomeric associations. Because the open channel conformer is likely to fold as a single domain protein with a large β-barrel, we reasoned that residues near the C terminus may be exposed on cell surface in this conformer. Introduction of a cysteine residue at position 312 produced a functional mutant protein. By using bulky biotinylation reagents on intact cells, we showed that this cysteine residue was not exposed on cell surface in most of the OprF population. However, the minority OprF population that was biotinylated in such experiments was enriched for the conformer with pore-forming activity and had a 10-fold higher pore-forming specific activity than the bulk OprF population. Finally trypsin treatment, which preferentially cleaves the C-terminal domain of the two-domain conformer, did not affect the pore-forming activity of OprF nor did it digest the minority conformer whose residue 312 is exposed on cell surface.

Structure and functions of the now classical, trimeric bacterial porins, such as OmpF, PhoE, and OmpC of Escherichia coli, are well understood. Each monomer forms a β-barrel composed of 16 membrane-traversing β-strands, and the central channel in the barrel is narrowed by the infolding of an external loop, L3 (for reviews, see Refs. 1Schulz G.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 701-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 2Cowan S.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 501-507Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 3Nikaido H. J. Biol.

The crystal structure of OmpF and PhoE shows that the channel is open (2Cowan S.W. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 501-507Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and measurement of permeability of the outer membrane in intact cells shows that at least a majority of the porin channel is open at any given time (5Nikaido H. Rosenberg E.Y. J. Gen. Physiol. 1981; 77: 121-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In contrast, much controversy still surrounds the properties of the major outer membrane protein OprF of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, first identified as the major porin of this species by reconstitution studies in 1979 (6Hancock R.E.W. Decad G.M. Nikaido H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 554: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The specific pore-forming activity of this porin was very low in the reconstitution assay (7Yoshimura F. Zalman L.S. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2308-2314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this was not due to inactivation of the protein during purification because the intact outer membrane of P. aeruginosa also showed permeability coefficients about 2 orders of magnitude lower than the E. coli outer membrane (8Yoshimura F. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1982; 152: 636-642Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Angus B.L. Carey A.M. Caron D.A. Kropinski A.M.B. Hancock R.E.W. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1982; 21: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The difficulty in explaining this low specific activity was magnified by the paradoxical observation that the OprF channel is wider than the E. coli OmpF channel, which has a much higher specific activity (6Hancock R.E.W. Decad G.M. Nikaido H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 554: 323-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 7Yoshimura F. Zalman L.S. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2308-2314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To explain these observations in a simplistic manner, it was claimed that purified OprF has no porin activity (10Yoshihara E. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6297-6301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that the outer membrane channels in P. aeruginosa are very narrow, consistent with their low permeability (10Yoshihara E. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6297-6301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Yoneyama H. Nakae T. Eur. J.

The finding that OprF is a homolog of E. coli OmpA (13Duchene M. Schweizer A. Lottspeieh F. Grauss G. Marget M. Vogel K. von Specht B.-U. Domdey H. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 171: 4130-4137Crossref Google Scholar), which is not a classical trimeric porin, seemed to add further support to these claims. However, we have shown that OmpA also produces very slow permeation of solutes, yet its pore size is comparable to that of OmpF, both properties reminiscent of those of OprF (14Sugawara E. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2507-2511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore careful repetition of the OprF purification procedure of Yoshihara and Nakae (10Yoshihara E. Nakae T. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6297-6301Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has shown that the purified product has distinct pore-forming activity, that the OprF contributes the major nonspecific porin activity to the P. aeruginosa outer membrane, and that the channel is indeed significantly larger than that of OmpF (15Nikaido H. Nikaido K. Harayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 770-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally Bellido et al. (16Bellido F. Martin N.L. Siehnel R.J. Hancock R.E.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5196-5203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that in intact cells OprF channel has a large size. Nevertheless the question remained on how the porin with large channel size could produce such a low permeability, that is, catalyze such slow permeation of solutes. Furthermore the accepted folding pattern of the OprF homolog, OmpA, consisting of an N-terminal eight-stranded β-barrel and a C-terminal, α-helix-rich, periplasmic domain (17Ried G. Koebnik R. Hindennach I. Mutscher B. Henning U. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) has been confirmed by the x-ray crystallographic structure of the N-terminal domain (18Pautsch A. Schulz G.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar), and the absence of sizable channel in this narrow barrel is a contradiction with the assumed porin function of this protein. We have shown earlier (19Sugawara E. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17981-17987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that OmpA protein population consists of two conformers, a majority (about 98%) containing “closed” channels and a minority (about 2%) containing open channels. The closed conformer presumably folds as a two-domain protein (17Ried G. Koebnik R. Hindennach I. Mutscher B. Henning U. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) with the N-terminal eight-stranded β-barrel and the C-terminal periplasmic globular domain. That most of the OprF protein also folds in this manner was suggested by our circular dichroism studies (20Sugawara E. Steiert M. Rouhani S. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6067-6069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, another laboratory has shown evidence that the folding pattern of OprF is OmpF-like with up to 18, rather than eight, transmembrane β-strands (21Wong R.S. Jost H. Hancock R.E.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 283-292Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 22Wong R.S. Wirtz R.A. Hancock R.E.W. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Rawling E.G. Martin N.L. Hancock R.E.W. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 38-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that OprF, like OmpA, becomes folded into two distinct conformers, the abundant, closed channel conformer and the rare, open channel conformer, and that the latter tends to occur as oligomers at high protein concentrations. We further present data demonstrating that the closed conformer folds in two domains, the N-terminal eight-stranded β-barrel and the C-terminal periplasmic globular domain, whereas the minority, open conformer folds as a single domain protein with a larger number of transmembrane β-strands, similar to the folding pattern of OmpF. Bacterial Strains and Their Cultivation—P. aeruginosa PAO1 was used as the source of OprF. To assess the degree of possible contamination of other proteins, we also used oprF null mutant H636 (15Nikaido H. Nikaido K. Harayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 770-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which has an “omega” insertion in the middle of the gene. The oprF gene was also cloned by PCR amplification and inserted between the BamHI and PstI sites of low copy number plasmid pHSG576 (24Takeshita S. Sato M. Toba M. Masahashi W. Hashimoto-Gotoh T. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 61: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (594) Google Scholar), producing plasmid pHSG-oprF, which was used as the starting material for the production of the other plasmids described below. The cloned DNA included a 108-bp sequence upstream of the ATG initiation codon, and it was sequenced to ascertain that there was no errors introduced by PCR. Bacteria were grown at 37 °C in Luria-Bertani medium containing 0.5% glucose (and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol when needed for plasmid maintenance) with aeration by rotary shaking. Cleavage of OprF into N-terminal and C-terminal Domains—Most of the OprF population appears to fold into a two-domain conformation with the N-terminal β-barrel domain and the C-terminal globular domain (see “Results”). Digestion of unmodified OprF by common proteases, however, results in the nearly complete digestion of the C-terminal domain and does not produce any information on the conformation of this domain in intact OprF. We therefore introduced a cleavage site for a highly specific protease in OprF. Inspection of OprF primary sequence and especially comparison with its homolog OmpA show that the N-terminal β-barrel of OprF is likely to end at Phe-160 followed by a short linker sequence rich in proline and alanine and finally by the C-terminal domain. Thus an 8-residue sequence specifically cleaved by tobacco etch virus protease (25Carrington J.C. Dougherty W.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3391-3395Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), SENLYFQS, was introduced between residues 162 and 163 of OprF. In addition, for purification, a decahistidine tag was introduced at the N terminus of the mature sequence. First, an upstream primer containing an EcoRI site and a downstream primer containing a PstI site as well as the sequence coding for the decahistidine tag were used to amplify the modified signal sequence of E. coli ompA gene. After restriction enzyme treatment, the amplicon was cloned in between the EcoRI and PstI sites of vector pBCKS(+) (Stratagene) whose multiple cloning sequence contains restriction sites EcoRI, PstI, BamHI, XbaI, and NotI in this order. Second, the sequence coding for the N-terminal half of the mature OprF (residues 1 through 162 of the mature sequence or residues 25 through 186 of the precursor OprF) was amplified with pHSG-oprF as the template by using an upstream primer containing a PstI site and a downstream primer containing a BamHI site as well as the sequence coding for the tobacco etch virus protease site (see above). The amplicon, after restriction enzyme treatment, was cloned into the recombinant plasmid described above that was cut with PstI and BamHI. Finally the oprF sequence coding for the C-terminal half, or amino acid residues 163 through 326 of the mature OprF, was PCR-amplified by using an upstream primer with a BamHI site and a downstream primer with a XbaI site, and the amplicon, after restriction enzyme treatment, was inserted into the recombinant plasmid obtained in the previous step cut with BamHI and XbaI. The complete modified oprF gene was sequenced to ascertain the absence of any PCR-induced alterations. It was excised from the pBCKS(+)-based construct with EcoRI and NotI and was inserted into vector pKY9790 (obtained from K. Yoshida) cut with the same two enzymes. This is a 5.1-kb plasmid with the pBR322 origin, chloramphenicol marker, lacI gene, and ptac promoter. Use of a gene that was cut with EcoRI at its upstream end places the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the ptac promoter at optimal distances from the initiation codon. The recombinant plasmid, pKY-oprFTev, was transformed into a recA E. coli strain, BLR (Novagen). Overnight culture of this strain (10 ml) was diluted into 1 liter of fresh LB broth containing 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and the suspension was incubated at 37 °C with aeration until the A600 reached 0.6. At this time, 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to initiate protein expression, and the culture was incubated at 30 °C for 3 h more. Crude envelope fraction was prepared by French pressure cell disruption, and it was then extracted with 0.12% octyl polyoxyethylene in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 to remove cytoplasmic membrane proteins. Outer membrane proteins were solubilized with a solution containing 3% octyl polyoxyethylene, 0.5 m NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. Decahistidine-tagged OprF with the internal cleavage site was purified by using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid Superflow column (Qiagen). Two hundred micrograms of the purified OprF was treated with 10 units of AcTEV protease (an enhanced form of tobacco etch virus protease, Invitrogen) in a total volume of 0.5 ml at room temperature overnight, and the mixture was loaded onto a nickel column, as above, to separate the C-terminal fragment from the decahistidine-tagged N-terminal fragment. The flow-through fraction containing the C-terminal fragment was concentrated. CD Spectra—CD spectra were recorded on an Aviv model 62DS circular dichroism spectrometer (Aviv Associates, Lakewood, NJ). All spectra were corrected for light scattering by subtracting spectra of samples not containing protein. Preparation of Unmodified OprF Protein—OprF protein was purified from the outer membrane fraction of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 by following essentially the procedure published earlier (20Sugawara E. Steiert M. Rouhani S. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6067-6069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief contaminating proteins (mostly from the cytoplasmic membrane) were first removed from the crude outer membrane fraction with dilute non-ionic detergents, and then the membranes were extracted with 68 mm octyl β-d-glucoside in the presence of 5 mm EDTA and 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0. The extract was fractionated by ion-exchange chromatography on a Macro-Prep 50Q column (10 × 50 mm) (Bio-Rad) in 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 0.3% (w/v) dodecyl β-d-maltoside (buffer A) and with a gradient of NaCl. The second peak containing mostly OprF and a small amount of OprG was combined from three successive runs, and the combined sample was fractionated on the same column with a shallower NaCl gradient, and the main peak was finally purified by gel filtration through a 1.5 × 90-cm column of Toyo Pearl HW-50F. Elution was by gravity using a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3 mm NaN3, 0.4 m NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1% (w/v) dodecyl β-d-maltoside. The OprF was eluted in the first large peak, which slightly overlapped with the second peak containing OprG. To assess the degree of contamination by other pore-forming proteins, the crude outer membrane fraction of the mutant H636 was treated in exactly the same manner. Functional Fractionation of OprF—These experiments were carried out as described for OmpA (19Sugawara E. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17981-17987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Purified OprF was mixed with the extensively sonicated egg phosphatidylcholine, octyl β-d-glucoside was added to a final concentration of 1.1%, and unilamellar, OprF-containing proteoliposomes were produced by dilution of this solution. The amount of OprF was chosen so that each vesicle would contain less than about 10 molecules of this protein. The uniform size distribution of these vesicles was ascertained in an earlier study (19Sugawara E. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17981-17987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The vesicles, made in a buffer containing 0.3 m urea, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.0, and 3 mm NaN3, were sedimented through a linear gradient that contained 0.3 m urea at the top and a mixture of 0.15 m urea and 0.15 m sucrose at the bottom in the same KCl-HEPES-NaN3 buffer at 300,000 × g for 16 h in a Beckman SW65 swinging bucket rotor at 10 °C. Fractions were collected, and the lipids in proteoliposomes were quantitated by the total phosphate assay (26Ames B.N. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-775Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). They were also analyzed for protein composition by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining (27Henkeshoven J. Dernick R. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 28-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Vesicles were also collected and used for the production of multilamellar vesicles for use in the osmotic swelling assay as described earlier for OmpA (19Sugawara E. Nikaido H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17981-17987Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). High Resolution Size Fractionation of OprF—OprF samples were fractionated by gel filtration with a 1.5 × 90-cm column of high resolution medium with narrow particle size distribution (Toyo Pearl HW-50F, Tosoh Biosep, Montgomeryville, PA). The buffer used contained 0.1% (w/v) dodecyl maltoside, 0.4 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm DTT, and 3 mm NaN3. Fractions of 0.5 ml each were collected and analyzed for protein with A280 or BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) and for pore-forming activity with the liposome swelling assay described below. Determination of Pore-forming Activity—Pore-forming activity was routinely assayed by the osmotic swelling rates of proteoliposomes containing different amounts of OprF (15Nikaido H. Nikaido K. Harayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 770-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes were made in 15% Dextran T-40 (Pharmacia Corporation). As a routine measure of pore-forming activity, swelling rates in iso-osmotic l-arabinose were used because influx of this small, pentose sugar was rapid, and therefore the swelling rates could be determined more accurately. The pore size was inferred from the dependence of swelling rates on the size of the permeating solutes as described earlier (15Nikaido H. Nikaido K. Harayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 770-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Channel Reconstitution into Planar Lipid Bilayers—The channel-forming activity of open channel-enriched, unfractionated, and open channel-depleted OprF fractions has been probed with bilayer lipid membrane technique (see also Ref. 28Nestorovich E.M. Sugawara E. Nikaido H. Bezrukov S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16230-16237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For multichannel experiments reported here, “solvent-free” bilayer lipid membranes were formed on a 100-μm aperture in the 15-μm-thick Teflon film that separated two compartments as described in Ref. 28Nestorovich E.M.

The channel measurements were carried out at room temperature of 23 ± 2 °C in planar diphytanoyl phosphatidylcholine lipid membrane; the aqueous phase of the membrane chamber contained 1 m KCl in 5 mm Tris at pH 7.42. OprF was added from 0.6–2 mg/ml stock solutions. In contrast, for the single channel experiments in Ref. 28Nestorovich E.M. Sugawara E. Nikaido H. Bezrukov S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16230-16237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar we used OprF stock solutions of 30 μg/ml concentration. Labeling of Intact Cells and Outer Membrane Preparations with Biotin-Maleimide—A mutant OprF protein, whose Ala-312 (the numbering is that of the mature protein) was changed into cysteine, was used for this purpose. Site-directed mutagenesis was achieved by the PCR method (29Liu J. Rutz J.M. Klebba P.E. Feix J.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13274-13283Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) starting from pHSG576-oprF. Briefly an upstream primer containing the BamHI site and a downstream primer covering amino acid residue 312 and containing the desired mutant sequence were used in the first step, and the amplicon was used as the upstream megaprimer together with the downstream primer outside the coding sequence in the second PCR. The purified product was digested with BamHI and was ligated into pHSG576 to yield plasmid pHSG-A312C. The PCR-amplified segment was sequenced to confirm the absence of unwanted mutations. E. coli DH5α containing the plasmid pHSG-FA312C was grown at 37 °C in LB broth containing 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol up to the midexponential phase (A600 = 1.0). Cells from the four sets of 20-ml cultures, grown in parallel, were collected by centrifugation, and two sets each were used either for intact cell labeling or for preparation of the cell envelope fractions. The sets for intact cell labeling were washed twice with 20 ml of M63 medium (0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 15 mm (NH4)2SO4, 1 mm MgSO4), and one set was treated with 2% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol for 30 min at room temperature followed by washing in M63 medium. Cells of the other sets were resuspended each in 0.5 ml of 20 mm Hepes/NaOH buffer, pH 8.0, and were disintegrated by using a Gallenkamp Soniprep 150 sonicator. After the removal of unbroken cells by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 10 min, the envelope fractions were sedimented by centrifugation at 150,000 rpm for 15 min in a Beckman TA ultracentrifuge and were resuspended in M63 medium. One set of the envelope fractions was incubated with 2% (v/v) mercaptoethanol for 30 min at room temperature and was then washed three times with M63 medium by ultracentrifugation as above. These four samples were labeled with 0.1 mm biotin-maleimide (N-biotinoyl-N′-(6-maleimidohexanoyl) hydrazide (Sigma)) for 5 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and the samples were washed twice by centrifugation in M63 medium. All samples were resuspended in 0.1 ml of lysis buffer (4% SDS, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue in 0.125 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) and were solubilized by heating for 5 min in a boiling water bath. One-tenth aliquots of the samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane by electrophoretic blotting. The membrane was blocked for 1 h with 5% dry milk in TNT (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 80) followed by treatment for 30 min with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce) (0.06 μg in TNT containing 1% (w/v) dry milk). After washing the membrane three times with TNT, the biotinylated proteins were visualized with chemiluminescence detection (Renaissance Western blot ECL kit, DuPont). Purification of the OprF Conformer with Its C-terminal Domain Exposed on Cell Surface—N-[6-(Biotinamido)hexyl]-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)propionamide (biotin-HPDP 2The abbreviation used is: biotin-HPDP, N-[6-(biotinamido)hexyl]-3′-(2′-pyridyldithio)propionamide.; Pierce), a cleavable biotinylation reagent, was used for this purpose. E. coli DH5α containing pHSG-OprFA312C was grown in 1 liter of LB broth containing 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 37 °C. Cells harvested by centrifugation were washed once with M63 medium and were resuspended in 20 ml of M63 medium. Cells were labeled with 0.1 mm biotin-HPDP for 5 min at room temperature and were then immediately centrifuged. Cells were washed quickly three times with M63 medium, and crude cell envelope fraction was prepared by French press treatment (14,000 p.s.i., repeated three times). Biotinylated OprFA312C was trapped onto an immobilized monomeric avidin column (Pierce) and was eluted by reducing the disulfide linkage in the biotin linker with a solution containing 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.1% dodecyl maltoside in phosphate-buffered saline. As a control, labeling was done on crude envelope fraction, and the OprFA312C proteins that were biotinylated under these conditions were isolated by the same procedure as above. Trypsin Digestion Kinetics of OprF—Intact cells of E. coli DH5α containing pHSG-OprFA312C were labeled with biotin-maleimide as described above. Cells were washed three times with M63 medium. Crude membrane fraction was isolated by French pressure cell disruption (see above), and the inner membrane proteins were removed by extraction with 1% Sarkosyl. The outer membrane fraction (0.4 mg) was then incubated at 37 °C with trypsin (20 μg) in a total volume of 0.15 ml. Digestion was stopped by the addition of 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and the samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE after solubilization in the sample buffer for 5 min at 100 °C. The time course of digestion of total OprF population was determined by the scanning of the OprF band in the Coomassie Blue-stained gel, whereas that of the surface-exposed conformer of OprF was assayed by treating the blot of the gel with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin as described above. Conformation of the Majority of OprF Population—E. coli OmpA has long been believed to fold into a two-domain conformation (17Ried G. Koebnik R. Hindennach I. Mutscher B. Henning U. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1994; 243: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) with its N-terminal half producing an eight-stranded β-barrel and its C-terminal half folding into a globular periplasmic domain that interacts with the underlying peptidoglycan (30De Mot R. Vanderleyden J. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 333-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 31Koebnik R. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 16: 1269-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In fact, the eight-stranded β-barrel structure was confirmed by the crystallization of C-terminally truncated OmpA derivative (18Pautsch A. Schulz G.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1013-1017Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). In contrast, P. aeruginosa OprF, a homolog of OmpA, has been described usually as a single domain protein that forms a 16-stranded β-barrel (21Wong R.S. Jost H. Hancock R.E.W. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 10: 283-292Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 22Wong R.S. Wirtz R.A. Hancock R.E.W. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 158: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 23Rawling E.G. Martin N.L. Hancock R.E.W. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 38-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) just like the classical trimeric porin OmpF. Although this concept was challenged by our study of the secondary structures in OprF (20Sugawara E. Steiert M. Rouhani S. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6067-6069Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), direct proof for the OmpA-like, two-domain structure is lacking. We wanted to isolate the two putative domains, the N-terminal β-barrel domain and the C-terminal globular domain, by cleaving the intact protein in the middle. However, treatment of OprF with general proteases such as trypsin or proteinase K results in the complete digestion of the C-terminal region. In this study, we introduced a peptide sequence coding for a cleavage site for a more specific protease, tobacco etch virus protease, between residues 162 and 163 of OprF within the region corresponding to the hinge between the two domains in OmpA (see “Experimental Procedures”). We also introduced a decahistidine tag at the N terminus of the protein. OprF,"
https://openalex.org/W1993926727,"The integral membrane proteins Alb3, OxaI, and YidC belong to an evolutionary conserved protein family mediating protein insertion into the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts, the inner membrane of mitochondria, and bacteria, respectively. Whereas OxaI and YidC are involved in the insertion of a wide range of membrane proteins, the function of Alb3 seems to be limited to the insertion of a subset of the light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding proteins. In this study, we identified a second chloroplast homologue of the Alb3/OxaI/YidC family, named Alb4. Alb4 is almost identical to the Alb3/OxaI/YidC domain of the previously described 110-kDa inner envelope protein Artemis. We show that Alb4 is expressed as a separate 55-kDa protein and that Artemis was identified mistakenly. Alb4 is located in the thylakoid membrane of Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplasts. Analysis of an Arabidopsis mutant (Salk_136199) and RNA interference lines with a reduced level of Alb4 revealed chloroplasts with an altered ultrastructure. Mutant plastids are larger and more spherical in appearance, and the grana stacks within the mutant lines are less appressed than in the wild-type chloroplasts.

These data indicate that Alb4 is required for proper chloroplast biogenesis. The insertion, folding, and assembly of integral membrane proteins into high molecular weight structures is a complex process requiring numerous regulatory factors. Recently, proteins belonging to the Alb3/OxaI/YidC family were described to have important roles for the biogenesis of membrane proteins in chloroplasts, mitochondria, and bacteria (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Dalbey R.E. Kuhn A. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 166: 769-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar and 2Yi L. Dalbey R.E. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2005; 22: 101-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, most inner membrane proteins are targeted to the cytoplasmic membrane using the SRP pathway. The cotranslational insertion into the membrane is mediated via the SecY-translocase and the associated plasma membrane protein YidC. The exact function of YidC in the biogenesis of Sec-dependent membrane proteins is not clarified yet, but recent studies indicate that YidC can assist the lipid partitioning of single transmembrane domains or folding of the Sec-dependent proteins (3Beck K.

In addition, YidC can also act independently of the SecY-translocase mediating the insertion of a subset of E. coli inner membrane proteins (7Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moller I. Wiedmann M.

Cell. 2004; 15: 1853-1861Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Since mitochondria do not contain an SRP and a SecY-translocase (11Glick B.S. Von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2651-2652Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), OxaI and Cox18/OxaII function in a Sec-independent manner. OxaI is required for the insertion of a number of both mitochondrially and nuclear encoded inner membrane proteins (12Hell K. Herrmann J.M. Pratje E. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.

OxaI differs from Cox18/OxaII by a C-terminal extension that functions as a ribosome-binding domain during the cotranslational insertion of mitochondrial translation products (14Herrmann J.M. Neupert W. IUBMB Life. 2003; 55: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Cox18/OxaII is specifically required for the biogenesis of the cytochrome oxidase complex, and recent studies indicate that its function is restricted to a posttranslational activity (15Jia L.

In chloroplasts of higher plants and algae, such as Arabidopsis thaliana and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the thylakoid membrane proteins Alb3 (A. thaliana) and Alb3.1 (C. reinhardtii), respectively, were identified as homologues of YidC and OxaI (18Sundberg E.

Chlamydomonas mutants lacking Alb3.1 are mainly characterized by a specific depletion of the light-harvesting systems (19Bellafiore S. Ferris P. Naver H. Gohre V. Rochaix J.D. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2303-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in Chlamydomonas, a second Alb3 homologue, Alb3.2, was identified. The molecular function of this protein is, however, still unknown (19Bellafiore S. Ferris P. Naver H. Gohre V. Rochaix J.D. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 2303-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In Arabidopsis, Artemis was identified as a second chloroplast member of the Alb3/OxaI/YidC family. Artemis was described as a 110-kDa inner envelope protein consisting of three distinct modules: an N-terminal receptor kinase-like domain, a centrally positioned ATP/GTP-binding domain, and a C-terminal Alb3/OxaI/YidC domain. Arabidopsis plants containing an En-1 transposon in the N-terminal part of Artemis exhibited chloroplasts arrested in the late stages of chloroplast division (22Fulgosi H. Gerdes L. Westphal S. Glockmann C. Soll J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11501-11506Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Notably, the Arabidopsis genome annotation of BAC clone F21J9 predicts two open reading frames in its current version for the genomic region described to encode Artemis (At1g24490/At1g24500; Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences A. thaliana Genome Database). The upstream located open reading frame is predicted to encode a hypothetical 65-kDa protein with unknown function, and the second open reading frame is predicted to encode the C-terminal Alb3/OxaI/YidC domain of Artemis. This caused us to reinvestigate the presence of Artemis in the model plant A. thaliana. Here, we describe that the predicted C-terminal Alb3/OxaI/YidC domain of Artemis is expressed as a 55-kDa chloroplast protein (Alb4) that is located exclusively in the thylakoid membrane. Analysis of the ultrastructure of chloroplasts of Arabidopsis mutants showing reduced levels of Alb4 indicates that Alb4 is involved in proper chloroplast biogenesis. The existence of Artemis can no longer be maintained. All experiments were performed on Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. Columbia plants (cv. Col-0; Lehle Seeds, Round Rock, TX). The T-DNA insertion line Salk_136199 (23Alonso J.M. Stepanova A.N. Leisse T.J. Kim C.J. Chen H. Shinn P. Stevenson D.K. Zimmerman J. Barajas P. Cheuk R. Gadrinab C. Heller C. Jeske A. Koesema E.

Prior to sowing, seeds were surface-sterilized with 5% hypochlorite. To synchronize germination, all seeds were kept at 4 °C for 1 day. Plants were grown on soil or on medium containing 1% d-sucrose and 0.5× Murashige and Skoog salts at pH 5.7. Plant growth occurred in growth chambers with a 16-h light (21 °C, photon flux density of 100 μmol m–2 s–1) and 8-h dark (16 °C) cycle. Alb3, Alb4, and OEP7 (24Salomon M. Fischer K. Flügge U.I.

For transient expression of fluorescence-tagged proteins, Alb3 and Alb4 were cloned into pOL-GFP (26Peeters N.M. Chapron A. Giritch A. Grandjean O. Lancelin D. Lhomme T. Vivrel A. Small I. J. Mol. Evol. 2000; 50: 413-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and OEP7 was cloned into pK7FWG2 (27Karimi M. De Meyer B. Hilson P. Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 103-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). For in vitro transcription, Alb4 was cloned into pSP65 (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). Constructs were confirmed by sequencing. For RNAi, a part of Alb4 (corresponding to nucleotides 523–1257) that showed very low homologies on the nucleotide level to other transcripts from Arabidopsis was amplified from cDNA using gene-specific primers with att sites for homologous recombination. The PCR product was cloned into pH7GWIWG2(I) (27Karimi M. De Meyer B. Hilson P. Trends Plant Sci. 2005; 10: 103-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). Agrobacterium strain GV3101::pMK90RK, carrying the RNAi construct for Alb4 in pH7GWIWG2(I), was used to transform Arabidopsis Col-0 plants (T0) by floral dip (28Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformed Arabidopsis lines (T1 and T2) were selected on Murashige and Skoog plates containing hygromycin (50 μg/ml or 35 μg/ml; Roche Applied Science). Hygromycin-resistant seedlings were then transferred to soil. Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts were isolated from leaves of 4-week-old plants and transiently transfected according to the protocol of Jen Sheen (available on the World Wide Web at opus.mgh.harvard.edu/sheen_lab/). GFP fluorescence was observed with a TCS-SP 1 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Image stacks were processed with ImageJ (National Institutes of Health; available on the World Wide Web at rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). Import reactions were performed as described previously (29Waegemann K. Soll J. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 50: 255-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). 20 μg of chlorophyll were used per import reaction. Import mix contained 0.2% bovine serum albumin. Import was done for 20 min at 25 °C. Import reactions were treated with 200 μg/mg chlorophyll thermolysin for 20 min on ice. Protease inhibitors were present at all subsequent steps. After protease treatment, chloroplasts were lysed in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.6) and separated into a soluble stromal and a total membrane fraction by centrifugation for 10 min at 165,000 × g. Soluble proteins were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid. Import products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by fluorography. α-Alb4-1—The C termini of Alb3 (residues 361–462) and Alb4 (residues 347–494) were amplified by PCR using corresponding primers with unique restriction sites. The PCR products were digested with EcoRV and XhoI and cloned into the EcoRV/XhoI site of the overexpression vector pET29b(+) (Novagen). The recombinant proteins were expressed using the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) or BL21(DE3)pLysS (Invitrogen). Overexpressed protein was purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) under denaturing conditions as suggested by the manufacturer. The recombinant C terminus of Alb4 was dialyzed against 1× phosphate-buffered saline buffer (pH 7.4) and used as antigen to raise antibodies in rabbits (SeqLab, Göttingen, Germany). The antibody was purified by affinity chromatography. 1 mg of the native purified protein was dialyzed against 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, and coupled to 0.1 ml Affi-Gel 15 (Bio-Rad) following the instructions of the manufacturer. 1.5 ml of serum was incubated for 30 min at 56 °C and centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000 × g. The supernatant was added to the coupled antigen and incubated at 4 °C overnight. The beads were washed two times with 0.5 ml of 200 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and two times with 0.5 ml of 500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5. The bound antibody was eluted three times with 250 μl of 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5. For neutralization and stabilization of the antibody, 20 μl of 1 m Tris and 25 μl of 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin were added. α-Alb4-2—The C terminus of Alb4 (residues 369–499) was amplified by PCR using the corresponding primers with unique restriction sites. The PCR products were cloned into the NheI/XhoI site of the overexpression vector pET21d (Novagen). The recombinant protein was expressed using the E. coli strain BL21(DE3) (Invitrogen). Overexpressed protein was purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen) under denaturing conditions as suggested by the manufacturer. The protein was concentrated using Biomax 10K Ultrafree centrifuge filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA) in 6 m urea, 250 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl, 1% (w/v) SDS and used as antigen to raise antibodies in rabbits (Pineda, Berlin, Germany). α-Alb4-3 and α-Alb4-4—Two peptides corresponding to amino acid residues 418–437 (QKAEAALSNQNTDKAHEQDE) and 485–499 (GHDTEQQHSHETEKR), respectively, were chemically synthesized, mixed, and used as antigen to raise antibodies in two rabbits (Pineda). Arabidopsis plants (150 g fresh weight, 5 weeks old) were homogenized in 900 ml of 0.45 m sorbitol, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaHCO3, 20 mm Tricine-KOH (pH 8.4) using a Waring blender. The homogenate was filtered through two layers of Miracloth and centrifuged for 5 min at 1400 × g. The pellets were resuspended in 20 ml of 0.3 m sorbitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tricine-KOH, pH 7.6 (RB) and loaded on four preformed 30-ml 50% Percoll gradients (50% Percoll in RB). After centrifugation of the Percoll gradients for 6 min at 12,000 × g, the lower green band was removed and washed one time with RB. Chloroplasts were lysed at 1–2 mg of chlorophyll/ml in 0.1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Separation in stroma, thylakoids, and envelopes was done according to Ref. 30Li H.M. Moore T. Keegstra K. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 709-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar. Genomic DNA of the T3 and T4 progeny of the T-DNA insertion line Salk_136199 was PCR-screened using the Alb4 gene-specific primer ArtTMNotI.for (5′-AATGCGGCCGCGGTACATGTTCCTTATTCCTATG-3′) in combination with the T-DNA-specific left border primer LBa1 (5′-TGGTTCACGTAGTGGGCCATCG-3′). A PCR product of about 1065 bp was expected. Nevertheless, both primers generated a 1338-bp DNA fragment on hetero- and homozygous plants. The PCR product was sequenced, and the correct insertion position was determined. To identify Salk_136199 plants with the T-DNA insertion in both alleles of the Alb4 gene, we used the gene-specific sense primer ArtTMNotI.for in combination with Ex13.rev (5′-GGGGTACCCTGCGAGGACTGCATAATT-3′). DNA from homozygous Salk_136199 plants gave no amplification product, whereas the amplified region on wild-type and heterozygous DNA was 1218 bp long. Progeny of plants carrying an En-1 transposon in the N-terminal part of Artemis (22Fulgosi H. Gerdes L. Westphal S. Glockmann C. Soll J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 11501-11506Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) were screened for the presence of a stable footprint. A line could be identified in that En-1 was imprecisely cut out, leaving a 128-bp footprint behind. PCR on genomic DNA with the primers Ex2.for (5′-ACATAAGCATCGACTGTGG-3′) and Ex2.rev (5′-CTTACTAATTCCTGCGCAC-3′) yielded a 527-bp product in WT and heterozygous plants. In plants heterozygous and homozygous for the footprint in Artemis, a band of 655 bp was observed. In all tested plants (n = 103), the footprint segregated in a Mendelian fashion (24% homozygous, 50% heterozygous, 26% WT). Total RNA from Arabidopsis tissues was isolated using the Plant RNeasy Extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). 5′-RACE-ready cDNA was amplified from 1 μg of total leaf RNA with the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech). 5′-RACE was performed with the gene-specific primer 5′RACE-1633.rev (5′-GACGACGACGGTGTGTGGCTGAAACG-3′) using Advantage 2 polymerase mix (Clontech). The RACE products were TA-cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). Full-length cDNA of Alb4 was synthesized using the Titan One Tube RT-PCR kit (Roche Applied Science) and the gene specific primers 5′-CAAGTTATGTCTTCAACAATATCC and 5′-GAAACAGAGAAGAGGTAATTC. The full-length PCR products were TA-cloned into the vector pGemT-easy (Promega). To analyze splicing variants in the Alb4 mutant (Salk_136199), cDNA from 7-day-old cotyledons and 4-week-old leaves was prepared as depicted before (31Clausen C. Ilkavets I. Thomson R. Philippar K. Vojta A. Mohlmann T. Neuhaus E. Fulgosi H. Soll J. Planta. 2004; 220: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The primers E7.fw (5′-TCCAACGACTGTTGCT-3′) and E7.rv (5′-CAGGTTTGGGGCATTC-3′) were used to amplify specific products for wild-type Alb4 (497 bp) and mutant transcripts (389 bp; see Fig. 7). The RT-PCR products were TA-cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen). All RACE and RT-PCR products were fully sequenced in the respective plasmid vectors. To quantify the transcript abundance in alb4 mutants, total RNA was extracted from cotyledons of 7-day-old A. thaliana seedlings or from leaves of 5-week-old plants, DNase-digested, and reverse transcribed into cDNA as described (31Clausen C. Ilkavets I. Thomson R. Philippar K. Vojta A. Mohlmann T. Neuhaus E. Fulgosi H. Soll J. Planta. 2004; 220: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Quantification of transcripts by real time RT-PCR was performed as depicted before (32Philippar K. Ivashikina N. Ache P. Christian M. Luthen H. Palme K. Hedrich R. Plant J. 2004; 37: 815-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) using a LightCycler (Roche Applied Science). For Alb4, we constructed the following gene-specific primers: LCfw (5′-ACCAAGAGAGAAGGGTG-3′) and LCrv (5′-GCCAATGCCGAATGTC-3′). The primer pair was designed to amplify a product specific for the C-terminal end of Alb4 (316 bp). To prevent amplification of contaminating genomic DNA, the primers were selected to flank intron 9. cDNA quantities were calculated by using LIGHTCYCLER 3.1 software (Roche Applied Science). All quantifications were normalized to actin 2/8 cDNA fragments, amplified by ACTfw (5′-GGTGATGGTGTGTCT-3′) and ACTrev (5′-ACTGAGCACAATGTTAC-3′). Samples of A. thaliana were prepared as follows. Cotyledons of 7-day-old plants were fixed overnight in 4% glutaraldehyde in 50 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 7.0. The samples were washed thoroughly in the same buffer. Postfixation was overnight in 1% osmium tetroxide in sodium cacodylate buffer. After washing in distilled water, samples were dehydrated in a graded water/acetone series (10%, 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 2× 100%) and embedded afterward in Spurr's resin. Ultrathin sections were cut with a Reichert-Jung Ultracut E ultramicrotome from the middle part of the cotyledons and collected on copper grids. Samples were stained by flotation on droplets of 2% uranyl acetate and Reynolds lead citrate solution. All sections were examined with an EM10 A transmission electron microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). Arabidopsis leaves were ground in liquid nitrogen, mixed with buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 50 mm EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 300 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and centrifuged for 10 min at 256,000 × g. Soluble proteins in the supernatant and membrane proteins from the pellet were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot analysis using antibodies against Alb4, LHCP (as a marker protein for thylakoid membranes), Tic32 (as a marker protein for the inner envelope membrane), and LSU (large subunit of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase) (as a marker protein for the stroma). The Genomic Region Predicted to Encode the C-terminal Alb3/OxaI/YidC Domain of Artemis Contains an Open Reading Frame for Alb4—Difficulties to amplify full-length cDNA encoding Artemis by RT-PCR and the in silico prediction of two open reading frames within the genomic sequence led to experiments reexamining the existence of Artemis. Fig. 1A shows a partial alignment of the amino acid sequence of Artemis and the N terminus of the predicted ORF encoding an Alb3 homologue, referred to as Alb4. Except for the first 20 residues, Alb4 is identical to the C-terminal Alb3/OxaI/YidC domain of Artemis. To prove the expression of Alb4, the corresponding full-length cDNA was amplified by RT-PCR using RNA extracted from Arabidopsis leaves. The observation that the Alb4 cDNA could be amplified using a 5′-primer whose sequence is specific for Alb4 and not present in the Artemis cDNA demonstrated the existence of an ORF encoding Alb4 (submitted to GenBank™; accession number AM177312). In addition, sequence analysis of the 130-bp-long 5′-untranslated region obtained by 5′-RACE experiments identified a stop codon 30 base pairs upstream of the start codon of Alb4, excluding the possibility of a longer ORF (Fig. 1B). The exon/intron structure for Alb4 was confirmed to be as annotated for At1g24500 (see below). The expression of Alb4 was further verified by Northern blot experiments. Total RNA was extracted from 6-week-old plants, transferred to filters, and hybridized with probes encoding the C termini of Alb3 and Alb4 (Fig. 2A). The specificity of the probes was verified by control experiments using in vitro generated transcripts of Alb3 and Alb4 (Fig. 2B). Fig. 2A shows that the Alb3 probe detected the expected 1.7-kb Alb3 transcript. The Alb4-specific probe generated a single signal of ∼1.9 kb, a size that corresponds to the predicted length of the Alb4 mRNA. Even after prolonged exposure of the blots treated with the Alb4 probe, no signal could be found at ∼3.5 kb, the predicted size of the Artemis transcript.FIGURE 2The Alb4 gene is expressed in leaves of Arabidopsis. A, total RNA (15 μg/lane) was prepared from 6-week-old wild-type plants. RNA gel blots were hybridized with [32P]CTP-labeled DNA probes specific for Alb3 (lane 1) or Alb4 (lane 2). The DNA probes encode the C-terminal regions of Alb3 and Alb4 used for protein expression as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, the specificity of the used DNA probes for the detection of the Alb3- or Alb4-mRNA was verified by performing Northern blot experiments using in vitro transcribed mRNA of Alb3 (lanes 2 and 4) and pAlb4 (lanes 1 and 3). Samples in lanes 1 and 2 were hybridized with the Alb3-specific probe, and samples in lanes 3 and 4 were hybridized with the Alb4-specific probe.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Alb4 Is a Thylakoid Membrane Protein—Alb4 is predicted to have a chloroplast transit peptide with a processing site after amino acid residue 45 based on the ChloroP prediction program (33Emanuelsson O. Nielsen H. von Heijne G. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 978-984Crossref PubMed Scopus (1559) Google Scholar). To test this prediction, Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts were transiently transformed with constructs for Alb3-GFP or Alb4-GFP. Merging of the GFP and autofluorescence images indicated a thylakoid localization of Alb4. The GFP distribution for Alb4 is similar to that of Alb3 and not to that of outer envelope protein AtOEP7 (Fig. 3). To test this assumption, in vitro translated radiolabeled Alb4 was imported into isolated pea chloroplasts. Nonimported protein was degraded by protease treatment, and chloroplasts were fractionated into a soluble and a membrane fraction. Fig. 4A shows that Alb4 is imported and processed to a smaller protease-resistant mature protein of 50 kDa that was present in the membrane fraction after extraction with 4 m urea. The import behavior was under all conditions similar to that of the precursor protein of the oxygen evolving complex subunit of 33 kDa OE33, which is localized in the thylakoid lumen. Since pOE33 has a bipartite transit peptide, an intermediate form was detected in the stroma fraction (Fig. 4B).FIGURE 4Alb4 is imported into chloroplasts. A, in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled Alb4 precursor (pAlb4) was imported into isolated pea chloroplasts (equivalent to 20 μg of chlorophyll) for 20 min at 25 °C in the dark. After completion of the import reaction, chloroplasts were reisolated through a 40% (v/v) Percoll cushion and washed once. Chloroplasts were then either not treated (–) or treated (+) with the protease thermolysin. Organelles were lysed and separated into a soluble stroma (S) and membrane fraction (M). All samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE (only 10% of the soluble fraction was loaded), and labeled proteins were detected by fluorography. 35S-Labeled translation product (TP) is shown as an internal standard, 10% of which was added to a standard import reaction. p, precursor; m, mature. B, the precursor protein of the oxygen-evolving complex 33-kDa subunit (OE33) was used as a control and was imported into the thylakoids, where the processed mature form is resistant to thermolysin.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm that Alb4 is localized in the thylakoid membrane and not in the envelope membranes, an antibody was raised against a recombinant C-terminal fragment of Alb4. Alb4 is highly similar to Alb3 (55% identity, 72% similarity). To exclude a possible cross-reaction of the anti-Alb4-1 antibody with Alb3 and to demonstrate the specificity for Alb4, we tested anti-Alb4-1 thoroughly using overexpressed protein and in vitro translation products for both Alb4 and Alb3. The anti-Alb4-1 antibody recognized the antigen and detected the in vitro translation product of the full-length Alb4 precursor (Fig. 5, A and B). No cross-reaction was detected between the anti-Alb4-1 antibody and the recombinant C terminus of Alb3 and the in vitro translation product of full-length Alb3 (Fig. 5, A"
https://openalex.org/W2070444415,"Protein palmitoylation is a reversible lipid modification that plays important roles for many proteins involved in signal transduction, but relatively little is known about the regulation of this modification and the cellular location where it occurs. We demonstrate that the humanδ opioid receptor is palmitoylated at two distinct cellular locations in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and undergoes dynamic regulation at one of these sites. Although palmitoylation could be readily observed for the mature receptor (Mr 55,000), [3H]palmitate incorporation into the receptor precursor (Mr 45,000) could be detected only following transport blockade with brefeldin A, nocodazole, and monensin, indicating that the modification occurs initially during or shortly after export from the endoplasmic reticulum. Blocking of palmitoylation with 2-bromopalmitate inhibited receptor cell surface expression, indicating that it is needed for efficient intracellular transport. However, cell surface biotinylation experiments showed that receptors can also be palmitoylated once they have reached the plasma membrane. At this location, palmitoylation is regulated in a receptor activation-dependent manner, as was indicated by the opioid agonist-promoted increase in the turnover of receptor-bound palmitate. This agonist-mediated effect did not require receptor-G protein coupling and occurred at the cell surface without the need for internalization or recycling. The activation-dependent modulation of receptor palmitoylation may thus contribute to the regulation of receptor function at the plasma membrane.

Palmitoylation, a post-translational lipid modification, plays an important role in the structure and function of a variety of proteins involved in cell signaling (1Dunphy J.T. Linder M.E. Biochim.

Bouvier M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 97: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The attached palmitate has therefore been proposed to promote the formation of a fourth cytoplasmic loop through its anchoring in the membrane (3Moench S.J. Moreland J. Stewart D.H. Dewey T.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5791-5796Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Consequently, palmitoylation may have a profound effect on the local conformation of this domain and possibly controls interaction of GPCRs with specific regulatory proteins. It has been shown to display diverse roles in GPCR function, including G protein coupling, desensitization, trafficking, and targeting of the receptors (2Qanbar R. Bouvier M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 97: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Unlike other lipid modifications such as myristoylation and prenylation, palmitoylation is a highly dynamic modification. The 16-carbon saturated palmitate that is attached to the specific cysteine residues via an acyl-thioester bond has been demonstrated to turn over rapidly (4Degtyarev M.Y. Spiegel A.M. Jones T.L. J.

The human δ opioid receptor (hδOR) is one of the three opioid receptor subtypes (μ, δ, κ) that are targets for opiate drugs and endogenous opioid neuropeptides. It contains several cysteine residues in the proximal part of its C-terminal end (28Knapp R.J. Malatynska E. Fang L. Li X. Babin E. Nguyen M. Santoro G. Varga E.V. Hruby V.J. Roeske W.R.

We have demonstrated that hδOR palmitoylation can occur at two distinct cellular locations. The newly synthesized receptors are first palmitoylated early in their biosynthetic pathway before they are transported to the cell surface, but palmitoylation/depalmitoylation cycles can also occur on the mature receptor at the plasma membrane. We also found that such constitutive receptor-bound palmitate turnover is increased upon agonist-promoted receptor activation. This regulation occurred locally at the plasma membrane and did not require G protein coupling, internalization, or recycling of the receptor.

The anti-FLAG M2 antibody, FLAG-peptide, isoproterenol, leucine-enkephalin (LE), cyclic[d-Pen2,d-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE), pertussis toxin (PTX), nocodazole (NOC), and cycloheximide (CHX) were products of Sigma. 2-Bromopalmitate (2-Br) was obtained from Fluka, and sulfo-N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-biotin, sulfo-NHS-S-S-biotin, immobilized streptavidin, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin were obtained from Pierce. Phycoerythrin-conjugated rat anti-mouse IgG1 and 7-amino-actinomycin D were from BD Biosciences. The mouse anti-c-Myc antibody (9E10) was produced by the core facility at the Department of Biochemistry, University of Montréal, as ascites fluid. Cell culture reagents were either from Invitrogen, Wisent, or Sigma. All the other reagents were of analytical grade and were obtained from various commercial suppliers. DNA Constructs and Cell Culture—The hδOR (Gene accession number P41443) in pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was tagged at the C-terminal end with a Flag epitope (DYKDDDDK) and expressed in stably transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293S cells (HEK293S-hδOR-Flag cells; 10.5 pmol/mg membrane protein, as determined by saturation binding using [3H]bremazocine) as described previously (30Petäjä-Repo U.E.

Receptor expression in the HEK293i-Myc-hδOR-Flag cells was induced by adding tetracycline (0.5 μg/ml; Invitrogen) into the culture medium. Labeling with [3H[Palmitate—For [3H]palmitate labeling, cells were first preincubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) without fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 60 min at 37 °C, and labeling was performed in fresh serum-free medium containing 500 μCi/ml [3H]palmitate for the times indicated in the figures and text. For pulse-chase experiments, the medium was removed, and cells were washed and incubated in the chase medium (DMEM supplemented with FBS and 100 μm palmitate) for different periods of time as specified in Figs. 2, 3, and 5 and in the text. For the HEK293i-Myc-hδOR-Flag cells, the chase medium was supplemented with CHX (20 μg/ml). The receptor ligands were added at the beginning of the labeling or chase, as indicated. When the labeling was performed in the presence of BFA (5 μg/ml), NOC (20 μg/ml), MON (10 μm), PTX (100 ng/ml), or 2-Br (100 μm), the reagents were added 15 min (NOC), 30 min (BFA, MON), or 16 h (PTX, 2-Br) before the labeling. For HEK293i-Myc-hδOR-Flag cells, BFA was added 6 h before labeling, and no preincubation in a serum-free medium was performed. To block receptor internalization, cells were detached and incubated in DMEM, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA in the absence or presence of sucrose (0.35 m) for 30 min at 37 °C before adding [3H]palmitate.FIGURE 3Addition of palmitate to newly synthesized hδORs is needed for their efficient transport to the cell surface. A–C, HEK293i-Myc-hδOR-Flag cells expressing the Myc and Flag epitope-tagged hδOR in a tetracycline-inducible manner were pretreated or not with 2-Br (2-Br Pre, 100 μm) for 16 h as indicated. Receptor expression was induced by adding tetracycline (0.5 μg/ml) to the culture medium, and transport of newly synthesized receptors to the cell surface was inhibited with BFA (5 μg/ml). Cells were incubated for 7 h in the continued absence or presence of 2-Br and then were labeled with [3H]palmitate for 60 min at 37 °C (A). Alternatively, cells were treated as described in A without adding [3H]palmitate, and cell surface proteins were labeled with sulfo-NHS-biotin (0.5 mg/ml) at 4 °C for 30 min (B and C). Cells were then harvested immediately (lanes 1 and 2) or after a 2-h chase in the absence of BFA, tetracycline, and 2-Br but in the presence of CHX (20 μg/ml) and palmitate (100 μm)(lanes 3 and 4). Total cellular membranes were isolated and extracted in DDM, and receptors were isolated by immunoprecipitation. Aliquots of the eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography (A) or by Western blotting using anti-FLAG M2 antibody (B) or HRP-conjugated streptavidin (C). The results shown are representative of two to three independent experiments. D, HEK293i-Myc-hδOR-Flag cells were pretreated (2-Br Pre) or not (Control) with 2-Br, and receptor expression was induced with tetracycline, as described in A, in the presence of BFA. A 2-h CHX chase was then performed in the absence of BFA and tetracycline and in the presence or absence of 2-Br (100 μm) or palmitate (Pal, 100 μm) as indicated.

Alternatively, immunoprecipitated receptors were subjected to Western blot analysis using HRP-conjugated streptavidin. Inhibition of Internalization and Detection of Internalized Receptors—The assay used to detect internalized receptors was modified from Cao et al. (34Cao T.T. Mays R.W. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24592-24602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were first washed with warm Dulbecco's PBS, cooled on ice, and incubated with gentle agitation at 4 °C for 30 min in the same buffer containing 0.3 mg/ml sulfo-NHS-S-S-biotin. Excess biotin was quenched by adding Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, to a final concentration of 50 mm, after which the incubation was continued for 10 min at 4 °C. Thereafter, cells were detached and incubated in warm DMEM, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA in the presence or absence of sucrose (0.35 m) for 30 min at 37 °C. Internalization was induced by adding LE (10 μm) and incubating cells for 30 min at 37 °C. After cooling on ice, the medium was removed by centrifugation (500 × g, 10 min), and cells were washed with 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) FBS. Biotin that remained attached to the cell surface was removed by incubating cells on ice for 10 min in 50 glutathione, 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) FBS. Finally, to quench the residual glutathione, cells were incubated on ice for 10 min in 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 5 mm EDTA in PBS, pH 7.4. The efficiency of biotin removal was confirmed by verifying that no biotin labeling could be detected in the absence of agonist-induced internalization following glutathione treatment. Immunoprecipitation—Crude cellular membranes were prepared as described (30Petäjä-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperrière A. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol.

After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min, the Flag-tagged receptor was immunoprecipitated from the supernatant fraction by two-step immunoprecipitation using immobilized anti-FLAG M2 antibody (35Petäjä-Repo U.E.

Hydroxylamine Treatment—For hydroxylamine treatment, receptors were eluted from immobilized anti-FLAG M2 antibody using a solution composed of 1% (w/v) SDS and 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide. Samples were then divided into two equal aliquots and treated with either 1 m hydroxylamine (pH 7.2) or 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) at 20 °C for 2 h. The reaction was stopped by adding equal volume of SDS-sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.001% (w/v) bromphenol blue). SDS-PAGE and Western Blotting—For SDS-PAGE (10% separating gels), samples were denatured by heating at 95 °C for 2 min under nondenaturing conditions. For detection of radioactivity, gels were treated with Enhance (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions, dried, and exposed at –80 °C for 20–120 days using the Biomax MS film and intensifying screens (Kodak). For Western blotting, proteins resolved in SDS-PAGE were transferred electrophoretically onto Immobilon P membrane (Millipore), and bound proteins were probed using anti-FLAG M2 antibody as described (30Petäjä-Repo U.E.

The relative intensities of the bands on autoradiograms and Western blots were analyzed by densitometric scanning with Agfa Arcus II or Agfa Duoscan HiD laser scanners and quantitation using Scion Image 4.02 software, subtracting the local background from each lane. Flow Cytometry—Cells were cooled on ice and detached from cell culture flasks with PBS. To label plasma membrane receptors, 1 × 106 cells/sample were incubated for 30 min on ice with monoclonal anti-c-Myc antibody (1:1,000) in PBS, 1% (v/v) FBS. After the residual unbound primary antibody was removed, cells were incubated with 0.5 μg/ml phycoerythrin-conjugated rat anti-mouse IgG1 in PBS, 1% (v/v) FBS for 30 min. After washing, dead cells were labeled with 7-amino-actinomycin D (0.25 μg/1 × 106 cells) for 10 min. All incubations were performed on ice. Ten thousand cells of each sample were analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur™ flow cytometer. Cells were excited with a 488-nm argon ion laser, and phycoerythrin and 7-amino-actinomycin D emission was detected with a 585 ± 21-nm band-pass filter and a 670-nm long-pass filter, respectively. Data analysis to quantitate changes in mean surface receptor fluorescence values were performed using the CellQuest ™Pro 4.02 software (BD Biosciences). Mean fluorescence of live cells minus mean fluorescence of cells stained only with phycoerythrin-conjugated secondary antibody was used for calculations. Data Analysis—Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4.02 software. For statistical t tests, the limit of significance was set at p < 0.05, and data are presented as the mean ± S.E. hδOR Is Palmitoylated via Thioester Bonds—To determine whether the hδOR is palmitoylated, we assessed whether it incorporates [3H]palmitate during metabolic labeling. HEK293S cells expressing the C-terminally Flag-tagged receptor (HEK293S-hδOR-Flag cells) were incubated for 60 min with [3H]palmitate, and the receptor was immunoprecipitated using immobilized anti-FLAG M2 antibody and subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis and fluorography. As shown in Fig. 1A, [3H]palmitate was incorporated into one major protein of Mr 55,000 that comigrated with the mature receptor on Western blots (compare lanes 2 and 4) (30Petäjä-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperrière A. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13727-13736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), whereas no labeled proteins were detected in nontransfected cells (lanes 1 and 3). This clearly demonstrates that, as is the case for many family A GPCRs, the hδOR is modified by addition of palmitate. No distinct labeled band comigrating with the Mr 45,000 receptor precursor (30Petäjä-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperrière A. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13727-13736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) was detected, but occasionally an ill-defined [3H]palmitate-labeled band migrating faster than the Mr 55,000 mature receptor (∼Mr 48,000) was observed (Fig. 1A, lane 2). This species represents a partially glycosylated mature receptor form that contains only one N-linked glycan. 5P. M. H. Markkanen, J. T. Tuusa, and U. E. Petäjä-Repo, manuscript in preparation. Covalent attachment of palmitate into proteins occurs primarily through a thioester linkage to cysteine residues; this linkage is chemically labile and can be cleaved by weak nucleophiles such as hydroxylamine at neutral pH. To assess the nature of the acyl linkage on the hδOR, the immunoprecipitated [3H]palmitate-labeled receptor was treated with either 1 m hydroxylamine (pH 7.2) or 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, fluorography, and Western blotting. Treatment with hydroxylamine led to a loss of the 3H signal on the fluorograms, whereas the protein remained intact (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 4, respectively), demonstrating that the acyl moiety on the receptor was attached via a thioester bond. hδOR Palmitoylation Is a Dynamic Process, Involving Newly Synthesized Receptors in Transit to the Plasma Membrane as well as Mature Receptors at the Cell Surface—The major hδOR species that was found to incorporate [3H]palmitate during the 60-min labeling period was the mature fully glycosylated form of Mr 55,000 (Fig. 1A, lane 2), and this was observed even when the labeling was shortened to 10 min (see Fig. 4B). Given that the ER residency time of newly synthesized hδORs is relatively long (half-time of maturation ∼ 120 min) (30Petäjä-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperrière A. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13727-13736Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), the fast labeling kinetics of the mature receptor suggests that palmitoylation is a late post-translational event and might even take place once the protein has been inserted into the plasma membrane. To investigate further in which cellular subcompartment palmitoylation takes place, we first assessed which hδOR species could incorporate [3H]palmitate in cells treated with BFA. This drug interferes with protein transport to the cell surface and leads to the accumulation of newly synthesized proteins in the ER (36Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1548) Google Scholar). When BFA was added to the labeling medium 30 min before [3H]palmitate addition and maintained during the 30-min labeling period, label was incorporated into two major proteins of Mr 45,000 and 55,000 (Fig. 2A, lane 2), the label of which was removable by hydroxylamine treatment (compare lanes 1 and 2 in Fig. 2B). The smaller receptor species represents newly synthesized receptor precursors that accumulate in the ER in BFA-treated cells (30Petäjä-Repo U.E. Hogue M. Laperrière A. Walker P. Bouvier M. J. Biol.

However, because the Mr 45,000 receptor species was not labeled in nontreated cells (Fig. 2A, lane 1), it is unlikely that palmitoylation occurs to any considerable extent in the ER. To further investigate this early site of palmitate attachment to the hδOR, the cells were treated with NOC, a microtubule-depolymerizing agent that inhibits microtubule-mediated vesicular transport and leads to accumulation of secretory proteins in pre-Golgi intermediates that fail to translocate to the Golgi (38Cole N.B. Sciaky N. Marotta A. Song J. Lippincott-Schwartz J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 631-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 2A, lane 3, the Mr 45,000 rece"

Transplantation of mouse bone marrow (BM) lineage antigen-negative (Lin-) cells resulted in the generation of the cells that displayed cardiomyocyte-specific antigenic profiles and contractile function when transplanted into syngeneic newborn recipients. To clarify the mechanism underlying the cardiomyogenic potential, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled BM Lin-ScaI+ hematopoietic progenitors were transplanted into neonatal mice constitutively expressing cyan fluorescence protein (CFP). Lambda image acquisition and linear unmixing analysis using confocal microscopy successfully separated GFP and CFP, and revealed that donor GFP+ cardiomyocytes coexpressed host-derived CFP. We further reconstituted human hemopoietic- and immune systems in mice by injecting human cord blood (CB)-derived Lin-CD34+CD38- hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) into neonatal T cell(-)B cell(-)NK cell- immune-deficient NOD/SCID/IL2rgamma(null) mice. Fluoroescence in situ hybridization analysis of recipient cardiac tissues demonstrated that human and murine chromosomes were colocalized in the same cardiomyocytes, indicating that cell fusion occurred between human hematopoietic progeny and mouse cardiomyocytes. These syngeneic- and xenogeneic neonatal transplantations provide compelling evidence that hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells contribute to the postnatal generation of cardiomyocytes through cell fusion, not through transdifferentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2096362679,"Pathological cellular hallmarks of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) include, among others, abnormal calcium homeostasis. Changes in the expression of specific receptors for extracellular ATP in dystrophic muscle have been recently documented: here, we demonstrate that at the earliest, myoblast stage of developing dystrophic muscle a purinergic dystrophic phenotype arises. In myoblasts of a dystrophin-negative muscle cell line established from the mdx mouse model of DMD but not in normal myoblasts, exposure to extracellular ATP triggered a strong increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations. Influx of extracellular Ca2+ was stimulated by ATP and BzATP and inhibited by zinc, Coomassie Brilliant Blue-G, and KN-62, demonstrating activation of P2X7 receptors. Significant expression of P2X4 and P2X7 proteins was immunodetected in dystrophic myoblasts. Therefore, full-length dystrophin appears, surprisingly, to play an important role in myoblasts in controlling responses to ATP. Our results suggest that altered function of P2X receptors may be an important contributor to pathogenic Ca2+ entry in dystrophic mouse muscle and may have implications for the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophies. Treatments aiming at inhibition of specific ATP receptors could be of a potential therapeutic benefit."

Here, we show that amphetamines are bioactivated by CNS prostaglandin H synthase (PHS) to free radical intermediates that cause ROS formation and neurodegenerative oxidative DNA damage. In vitro incubations of purified PHS-1 with 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) and methamphetamine (METH) demonstrated PHS-catalyzed time- and concentration-dependent formation of an amphetamine carbon- and/or nitrogen-centered free radical intermediate, and stereoselective oxidative DNA damage, evidenced by 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dG) formation. Similarly in vivo, MDA and METH caused dose- and time-dependent DNA oxidation in multiple brain regions, remarkably dependent on the regional PHS levels, including the striatum and substantia nigra, wherein neurodegeneration of dopaminergic nerve terminals was evidenced by decreased immunohistochemical staining of tyrosine hydroxylase. Motor impairment using the rotarod test was evident within 3 wk after the last drug dose, and persisted for at least 6 months. Pretreatment with the PHS inhibitor acetylsalicylic acid blocked MDA-initiated DNA oxidation and protected against functional motor impairment for at least 1.5 months after drug treatment. This is the first direct evidence for PHS-catalyzed bioactivation of amphetamines causing temporal and regional differences in CNS oxidative DNA damage directly related to structural and functional neurodegenerative consequences."
https://openalex.org/W2153279287,"The regulation of cell death is a key element in building up and maintaining both innate and adaptive immunity. A critical role in this process plays the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor family of death receptors. Recent work suggests that sialic acid binding immunoglobulin (Ig) -like lectins (Siglecs) are also empowered to transmit death signals, at least into myeloid cells. Strikingly, death induction by Siglecs is enhanced when cells are exposed to proinflammatory survival cytokines. Based on these recent insights, we hypothesize that at least some members of the Siglec family regulate immune responses via the activation of caspase-dependent and caspase-independent cell death pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2166949826,"Cytosolic calcium and membrane potential were monitored simultaneously in quiescent human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) exposed to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)165 using the fluorescent indicators indo-1 AM and DiSBAC2(3), respectively. Application of VEGF165 to cells elicits a rapid rise in cytosolic calcium followed by a slower decline toward control values. Peak calcium is associated with a slight membrane hyperpolarization; however, as calcium falls toward control, a strong depolarization develops and is sustained throughout a 10-min period of VEGF165 stimulation. Both the VEGF165-mediated rise in cytosolic calcium and membrane depolarization are eliminated by inhibitors of VEGFR-2, tyrosine kinase, src kinase and inositol-1,4,5 triphosphate-operated calcium channels. Calcium entry, which is initially facilitated by transient hyperpolarization, is restricted by a substantial, sustained depolarization that developed during the downstroke of the calcium spike. Inhibition of plasmalemmal calcium channels diminished the magnitude and duration of the calcium spike, suggesting that extracellular calcium influx, secondary to stores release, is a significant component of the calcium transient. Inhibition of chloride channels substantially reduced membrane depolarization. In addition, the depolarization is modulated by PI3 kinase in a ras-independent manner. In summary, intracellular calcium and membrane potential are influenced by several key signaling cascades of VEGFR-2 activation in HUVEC."
https://openalex.org/W2030388237,"The functional relevance of autoantibodies (Abs) against cardiac myosin (CM) in clinical idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) remains controversial. The study sought to determine effects of human Abs affinity-purified (AF) by immunoaffinity column chromotography on excitation-contraction coupling in isolated myocytes. Effects of CM-Abs from heart failure patients with DCM (n=19) and ischemic heart disease (IHD, n=19) on contractility, L-type Ca2+ current, and Ca2+ transients in continuously perfused rat ventricular myocytes were studied. Immunofluorescence studies using confocal microscopy were carried out to determine whether Abs were internalized. AF-Abs from either group did not differ in IgG titer but differed in their elution profiles. The IgG3 subclass response was higher in AF fractions from DCM (21%) than IHD (5%) patients. The Abs reduced the capacity of field-stimulated myocytes to contract in a dose-dependent manner. Inhibition of contraction, as a percentage of untreated cells, was greater with DCM than IHD-Abs (P=0.004), and the effect was independent of Ab titer. An increase in frequency of the beating myocytes (0.2 to 3.0 Hz) raised peak systolic and diastolic levels of [Ca2+]i of cells treated with DCM but not IHD-Abs (P<0.005). The AF-Abs were not internalized by myocytes and had no effect on L-type Ca2+ currents. The altered sensitivity of the myofilaments to [Ca2+]i by CM-Abs may represent a potential mechanism of autoantibody-mediated impairment in clinical DCM."
https://openalex.org/W1983768032,"We have previously shown that interferon regulatory factor-2 (IRF-2) is acetylated in a cell growth-dependent manner, which enables it to contribute to the transcription of cell growth-regulated promoters. To clarify the function of acetylation of IRF-2, we investigated the proteins that associate with acetylated IRF-2. In 293T cells, the transfection of p300/CBP-associated factor (PCAF) enhanced the acetylation of IRF-2. In cells transfected with both IRF-2 and PCAF, IRF-2 associated with endogenous nucleolin, while in contrast, minimal association was observed when IRF-2 was transfected with a PCAF histone acetyl transferase (HAT) deletion mutant. In a pull-down experiment using stable transfectants, acetylation-defective mutant IRF-2 (IRF-2K75R) recruited nucleolin to a much lesser extent than wild-type IRF-2, suggesting that nucleolin preferentially associates with acetylated IRF-2. Nucleolin in the presence of PCAF enhanced IRF-2-dependent H4 promoter activity in NIH3T3 cells. Nucleolin knock-down using siRNA reduced the IRF-2/PCAF-mediated promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that PCAF transfection increased nucleolin binding to IRF-2 bound to the H4 promoter. We conclude that nucleolin is recruited to acetylated IRF-2, thereby contributing to gene regulation crucial for the control of cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W2066063313,"In fast-spiking neurons such as those in the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) in the auditory brainstem, Kv3.1 potassium channels are required for high frequency firing. The Kv3.1b splice variant of this channel predominates in the mature nervous system and is a substrate for phosphorylation by protein kinase C (PKC) at Ser-503. In resting neurons, basal phosphorylation at this site decreases Kv3.1 current, reducing neuronal ability to follow high frequency stimulation. We used a phospho-specific antibody to determine which PKC isozymes control serine 503 phosphorylation in Kv3.1b-tranfected cells and in auditory neurons in brainstem slices. By using isozyme-specific inhibitors, we found that the novel PKC-δ isozyme, together with the novel PKC-ε and conventional PKCs, contributed to the basal phosphorylation of Kv3.1b in MNTB neurons. In contrast, only PKC-ε and conventional PKCs mediate increases in phosphorylation produced by pharmacological activation of PKC in MNTB neurons or by metabotropic glutamate receptor activation in Kv3.1/mGluR1-cotransfected cells. We also measured the time course of dephosphorylation and recovery of basal phosphorylation of Kv3.1b following brief high frequency electrical stimulation of the trapezoid body, and we determined that the recovery process is mediated by both novel PKC-δ and PKC-ε isozymes and by conventional PKCs. The association between Kv3.1b and PKC isozymes was confirmed by reciprocal coimmunoprecipitation of Kv3.1b with multiple PKC isozymes. Our results suggest that the Kv3.1b channel is regulated by both conventional and novel PKC isozymes and that novel PKC-δ contributes specifically to the maintenance of basal phosphorylation in auditory neurons.

The MNTB is key element of neural pathways that detect differences in the level or timing of interaural stimuli to compute sound localization. MNTB neurons are able to fire at frequencies of hundreds of Hz (9Leao R.M. Von Gersdorff H. J. Neurophysiol. 2002; 87: 2297-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 10Kopp-Scheinpflug C.

Yin T.C. J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 73: 1043-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). One important physiological specialization enabling MNTB neurons to fire at such high frequencies is the high level of expression of Kv3.1 potassium channels. Genetic knock-out of the Kv3.1 gene, as well as pharmacological and computer modeling studies, confirms that a high threshold component of potassium current in MNTB neurons is carried by Kv3.1 channels and that its elimination impairs the neuronal response to high frequency stimulation (12Brew H.M.

Nevertheless, high levels of Kv3.1b current degrade the accuracy of action potential timing at lower frequencies of firing (14Macica C.M. von Hehn C.A. Wang L.Y. Ho C.S. Yokoyama S. Joho R.H.

The Kv3.1b channel predominates in the mature nervous system and has a longer carboxyl terminus than that of Kv3.1a (2Weiser M. Bueno E. Sekirnjak C. Martone M.E. Baker H. Hillman D. Chen S.

Neurophysiol. 1995; 74: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Although activation of PKC stimulates phosphate incorporation into several serine residues in Kv3.1b, the specific actions of PKC on Kv3.1b currents have been shown to depend selectively on the phosphorylation of Ser-503 in the carboxyl-terminal region (14Macica C.M. von Hehn C.A. Wang L.Y. Ho C.S. Yokoyama S. Joho R.H. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 1133-1141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By using a phospho-specific antibody to serine 503 of Kv3.1b, it has been found that Kv3.1b in MNTB neurons is basally phosphorylated by PKC in a quiet auditory environment, providing maximal timing accuracy at low firing frequencies. In vivo acoustic stimulation of animals, or high frequency stimulation of the afferent input of MNTB neurons in brainstem slices, results in a rapid and reversible decrease in the level of phosphorylation. This dephosphorylation permits neurons to fire at higher rates, albeit with lower temporal accuracy. Thus phosphorylation of Kv3.1b by PKC appears to be a mechanism that rapidly adjusts the intrinsic electrical properties of neurons to the pattern of incoming auditory stimuli (16Kaczmarek L.K. Bhattacharjee A. Desai R. Gan L. Song P. von Hehn C.A. Whim M.D. Yang B. Hear. Res. 2005; 206: 133-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). PKC includes a family of Ser/Thr protein kinases that control many different aspects of neuronal function (20Malenka R.C. Madison D.V. Nicoll R.A. Nature. 1986; 321: 175-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 21Tanaka C. Nishizuka Y. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 551-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 22Malmberg A.B.

PKC enzymes have been divided into three groups as follows: (i) conventional, Ca2+-dependent PKC (cPKC) (α, βI, βII, and γ); (ii) novel, Ca2+-independent PKC (nPKC) (δ, ε, η, and θ); and (iii) atypical PKC isozymes (aPKC) (ξ, λ, ι, and μ). Both cPKCs and nPKCs are activated by phorbol esters, whereas aPKCs are insensitive to either Ca2+ or to phorbol esters. In this study we have identified the PKC isozymes that control the basal level of Kv3.1b phosphorylation in MNTB neurons, those that mediate the PKC activator and receptor-induced phosphorylation, and also those that contribute to the recovery from stimulation-induced dephosphorylation of Kv3.1b channels in MNTB neurons. Materials—12-(2-Cyanoethyl)-6,7,12,13-tetrahydro-13-methyl-5-oxo-5H-indolo[2,3-a]pyrrolo[3,4-c] carbazole (Gö6976) was purchased from Alexis (Carlsbad, CA). Rottlerin and 2-[1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-1H-indol-3-yl]-3-(1H-indol-3-yl)-maleimide (GF109203X) were from Calbiochem. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and bisindolylmaleimide VIII (Ro 31-7549) were from Sigma. (S)-3,5-Dihydroxyphenylglycine (S-DHPG; Tocris Neuramin, Ltd., Bristol, UK) were prepared in H2O. (RS)-α-Methyl-4-carboxylphenylglycine (MCPG) was prepared in an NaOH solution. All the other drugs were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO). Polyclonal antibody against Ser-503-phosphorylated Kv3.1b was made by PhosphoSolutions (Aurora, CO). Antibodies against PKC-α, -δ, and -ε were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. Immunocytochemistry—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing Kv3.1a, Kv3.1b, or Kv3.1 mutant S503A were maintained in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mm hypoxanthine, and 0.5 mg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen). CHO cells were grown on coverslips for 24–48 h in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C preceding drug administration. Cells were preincubated for 30 min with PKC inhibitors at the indicated concentrations and then stimulated with the PKC activator PMA for 12 min. For transient transfection of Kv3.1-CHO cells with pcDNA-mGluR1 (a kind gift from Dr. Jarda Wroblewski, Georgetown University), the cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 4.5% proline. Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) and were treated 10 min with mGluR1 agonist DHPG (300 μm) at 24 h after transfection. After drug treatment, CHO cells were quickly washed with ice-cold 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 10 min. After blocking and permeabilization, cells were incubated with rabbit anti-phosphoserine 503 Kv3.1b polyclonal antibody (1:400) at 4 °C for 24 h and subsequently with Alexa Fluor® 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:700) at 4 °C overnight. The coverslips were then mounted on glass slides with Citifluor Mountant Media (Ted Pella, Redding, CA), and images were taken on an Olympus BX60 microscope by using a SPOT RT digital camera (Diagnostic Instruments, Inc., Sterling Heights, MI). Preparation of Brainstem Slices—Sprague-Dawley rats (17–19 days old, Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were killed by decapitation, and transverse brainstem slices containing MNTB were cut at a thickness of 350 μm in ice-cold gassed artificial cerebrospinal fluid (in mm: 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 25 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 0.1 CaCl2, 3.0 MgCl2, 3 myoinositol, 2 sodium pyruvate, 0.4 ascorbic acid, and 25 glucose, pH 7.4). The slices were incubated at 37 °C for 50 min and thereafter kept at room temperature in recoding solution containing (in mm) 125 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 25 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2 CaCl2,1 MgCl2, 3 myoinositol, 2 sodium pyruvate, 0.4 ascorbic acid, and 25 glucose, pH 7.4. Slices were stimulated at the midline with a bipolar electrode (8 V, 0.2 ms) or treated with PKC inhibitor and activator as done with CHO cells. After that the slices were quickly transferred to 4% paraformaldehyde prior to immunohistochemistry. All experiments were conducted in accordance with the NIH and institutional animal care guidelines. Immunohistochemistry—Coronal sections were cut on a cryostat at a thickness of 35 μm. Similarly with immunocytochemistry, sections were incubated with phospho-specific antibody against Kv3.1b at 4 °C for 60 h and subsequently with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG at 4 °C for 24 h. Sections were scanned by a Bio-Rad model 1024 UV laser confocal microscope system. Coimmunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—CHO cells or rat brainstems were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% dodecyl β-d-maltoside, and a protease/phosphatase inhibitor mixture). The lysate was precleared with 1:1 slurry of protein A-Sepharose and equilibrated in lysis buffer at 4 °C for 1 h with shaking. After a short spin, the supernatant was incubated at 4 °C overnight with rabbit IgG or antibodies as indicated. Immune complexes were pooled down by protein A-Sepharose at 4 °C for 2 h with shaking. Immunoprecipitates were washed and dissolved in SDS sample buffer. The protein was loaded and separated by SDS-PAGE (10%) and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with the indicated antibodies. Goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies were used for detection with West Femto chemiluminescence (Pierce). Image Analysis—Optical density of the immunostaining was measured using ImagePro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD) and was referred to as “level of immunoreactivity” in the figures. OD values were subjected to statistical evaluation using Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance followed by post hoc comparison to confirm significant differences between the groups. Criteria for significance in all analyses were defined as p < 0.05. Data were presented as mean ± S.E. Detection of Phosphorylated Kv3.1b Potassium Channels Using a Ser-503 Phospho-specific Antibody—Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting were performed to evaluate the specificity of the anti-phospho-Ser-503 Kv3.1b antibody that was used throughout this study. CHO cells were stably transfected with the wild-type Kv3.1b gene or with S503A mutant Kv3.1b, in which this PKC phosphorylation site is mutated. As described previously (15Song P. Yang Y. Barnes-Davies M. Hamann M. Bhattacharjee A. Forsythe I.D. Oliver D.L. Kaczmarek L.K. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), no detectable basal immunostaining was observed in Kv3.1b-CHO cells until treatment with PMA (500 nm), an activator of PKC (Fig. 1A). Moreover, no immunoreactivity was detected after treatment with PMA in cells transfected with the S503A mutant Kv3.1b or with the Kv3.1a splice variant, both of which lack the Ser-503 phosphorylation site. Negative control experiments in which the primary antibody was either omitted or pre-adsorbed with the antigen peptide also revealed no immunostaining in PMA-treated Kv3.1b-CHO cells. In contrast, incubation of the primary antibody with a heterologous peptide did not affect the immunostaining in PMA-treated Kv3.1b-CHO cells (Fig. 1A). In contrast to the Kv3.1b-transfected CHO cells, profuse immunostaining was seen on the membrane of MNTB principal neurons in adult rats using the phospho-specific Kv3.1b antibody, even in the absence of pharmacological activation of PKC. This immunolabeling represented specific staining of Kv3.1b phosphorylated at Ser-503 because it was blocked by preincubating the primary antibody with the antigenic peptide but not with the heterologous peptide (Fig. 1B). Immunoblots of denatured protein extracts were carried out in transfected CHO cells. Consistent with previous studies using antibodies against other regions of the Kv3.1b protein (2Weiser M. Bueno E. Sekirnjak C. Martone M.E. Baker H. Hillman D. Chen S. Thornhill W. Ellisman M. Rudy B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4298-4314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Parameshwaran-Iyer S. Carr C.E. Perney T.M. J. Neurobiol. 2003; 55: 165-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), a protein band of ∼100 kDa was detected in extracts from Kv3.1b-CHO cells using the phospho-specific Kv3.1b antibody pre-absorbed with the heterologous peptide (Fig. 1C). This band was absent when the immunoblots were treated with antibody that was pre-adsorbed with the antigenic peptide or when the cells were treated with Me2SO, the vehicle for PMA treatment. Moreover, no band was detected in PMA-treated CHO cells that had been transfected with the S503A mutant Kv3.1b gene. Therefore, this antibody recognized Kv3.1b channels only when the channels were phosphorylated by PKC at Ser-503. PKC Isozymes Responsible for PMA-induced Phosphorylation of Kv3.1b Channels in CHO Cells—To identify the PKC isozymes involved in the modulation of Kv3.1b channels, a variety of PKC inhibitors was used specifically to inhibit different groups of PKC isozymes (Table 1). Group I inhibitors were those that are known only to inhibit the conventional family of PKCs (cPKC), whereas the group II inhibitors act on both cPKC and nPKC. Gö6976 is a specific inhibitor of cPKCs and has no effect on the activity of nPKC or aPKC isozymes even at micromolar levels (25Martiny-Baron G. Kazanietz M.G. Mischak H. Blumberg P.M. Kochs G.

At the much higher concentration of 1 μm, GF109203X inhibits both cPKCs and nPKCs (27Toullec D. Pianetti P. Coste H. Bellevergue P. Grand-Perret T. Ajakane M. Baudet V. Boissin P. Boursier E.

Similarly, Ro 31-7549 is known to antagonize only cPKCs at a concentration of 50 nm but inhibits both cPKCs and nPKCs at the higher concentration of 4 μm (29Ozawa K. Szallasi Z. Kazanietz M.G.

We found that preincubation of Kv3.1b-transfected CHO cells with group I inhibitors, i.e. 100 nm Gö6976, 1 μm Gö6976, 50 nm Ro 31-7549, or 50 nm GF109203X, diminished but did not abolish PMA-induced phosphorylation of Kv3.1b channels (Fig. 2A). In contrast, 4 μm Ro 31-7549 and 1 μm GF109203X, which are group II inhibitors, completely abolished PMA-induced immunoreactivity of Kv3.1b channels, indicating that both conventional and novel PKCs are involved in PMA-induced phosphorylation of Kv3.1b in CHO cells. Rottlerin (10 μm), which inhibits only PKC-δ, had no effect on the actions of PMA. Quantification of the phospho-Kv3.1b immunoreactivity showed that PMA treatment of Kv3.1b-transfected CHO cells produced a dramatic increase in the phosphorylation level over control cells treated with Me2SO (p < 0.0001) (Fig. 2B). The effect of PMA was significantly attenuated by group I inhibitors to values between 59 and 32% of that in PMA-treated cells, i.e.100 nm Gö6976 (p < 0.01 versus PMA and p < 0.05 versus control), 1 μm Gö6976 (p < 0.0001 versus PMA and p < 0.05 versus control), 50 nm Ro 31-7549 (p < 0.0001 versus PMA and p < 0.05 versus control), and 50 nm GF109203X (p < 0.0001 versus PMA and p < 0.05 versus control). The group II inhibitors, i.e. 4 μm Ro 31-7549 and 1 μm GF109203X, completely abolished the effect of PMA, attenuating staining to less than 4.0% of PMA treatment (for both cases, p < 0.0001 versus PMA and p > 0.05 versus control). The effects of group II inhibitors were significantly more potent than those of group I inhibitors (p < 0.01). The response to PMA was not significantly affected by 10 μm rottlerin (p > 0.05 versus PMA and p < 0.001 versus control). PKC Isozymes Responsible for mGluR1-mediated Phosphorylation of Kv3.1b Channels in CHO Cells—It is known that activation of mGluR1 leads to PKC activation, through increases in membrane-bound diacylglycerol and intracellular inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate level. In CHO cells cotransfected with mGluR1 and Kv3.1b channels, treatment with the mGluR1 agonist DHPG (300 μm) led to an increase in the phosphorylation level of Kv3.1b channels (Fig. 3). This effect was partially inhibited by the cPKC inhibitor Gö6976 (1 μm), was fully blocked by the n- and c-PKC inhibitor GF109203X (1 μm) and the group I/II mGluR antagonist MCPG (1 mm), but was not affected by the PKC-δ inhibitor rottlerin (10 μm). Quantification of the phospho-Kv3.1b immunoreactivity showed that DHPG treatment of mGluR1, Kv3.1b-cotransfected CHO cells produced a very marked increase in the phosphorylation level over control cells that were transfected with Kv3.1b and pcDNA vector alone (p < 0.001) (Fig. 3B). The effect of DHPG was significantly attenuated by the group I inhibitor Gö6976 (1 μm, p < 0.001 versus DHPG and p < 0.05 versus control). The group II inhibitor GF109203X (1 μm) completely abolished the effect of DHPG (p < 0.001 versus DHPG and p > 0.05 versus control). The effect of GF109203X was more potent than Gö6976 (p < 0.05). The response to DHPG was not significantly affected by the nPKC-δ inhibitor rottlerin (10 μm, p > 0.05 versus DHPG and p < 0.001 versus control). PKC Isozymes That Regulate the Basal Phosphorylation of Kv3.1b in Brainstem Slices—The PKC isozymes that have been identified in the brain and spinal cord are cPKC-α, -βI, -βII, -γ, and nPKC-δ, -ε, and aPKC-ζ (21Tanaka C. Nishizuka Y. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 551-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 36Ono Y. Fujii T. Ogita K. Kikkawa U. Igarashi K. Nishizuka Y. FEBS Lett. 1987; 226: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, dense basal phosphorylation of Kv3.1b potassium channels at Ser-503 was observed in MNTB neurons in brainstem slices of 17–19-day-old rats. The basal phosphorylation was diminished by pretreatment with the group I inhibitor, 1 μm Gö6976, and was completely abolished by the group II inhibitor, 1 μm GF109203X. In contrast to its lack of effect in PMA-treated CHO cells, rottlerin (10 μm), an inhibitor of nPKC-δ, also reduced the basal phosphorylation of Kv3.1b channels in MNTB neurons. Quantification showed that the basal Kv3.1b phosphorylation in MNTB neurons in control slices was reduced to 40% of control levels by 1 μm Gö6976 (p < 0.001 versus control) and to less than 6% of control by GF109203X (1 μm)(p < 0.0001 versus control and p < 0.001 versus Gö6976). Rottlerin (10 μm) reduced the basal staining to 71% of the control (p < 0.05). These data indicate that both cPKCs and nPKCs contribute to the basal phosphorylation of Kv3.1b channels in MNTB neurons and that nPKCs account for at least 34% of the basal staining. Because inhibition of PKC-δ alone by rottlerin produced a smaller inhibition of the basal staining, these results suggest that both nPKC-δ and nPKC-ε regulate the basal level of Kv3.1b phosphorylation. PKC Isozymes That Mediate PMA-induced Phosphorylation of Kv3.1b in MNTB Neurons—We next tested the actions of PKC inhibitors on PMA-induced phosphorylation of Kv3.1b channels in MNTB neurons. As shown in Fig. 5, treatment of brainstem slices with PMA (700 nm) significantly enhanced Kv3.1b phosphorylation in MNTB neurons. The group I inhibitors (100 nm Gö6976, 1 μm Gö6976, 50 nm Ro 31-7549, or 50 nm GF109203X) diminished Ser-503 phosphorylation but did not abolish it. In contrast, group II inhibitors (4 μm Ro 31-7549 or 1 μm GF109203X) completely abolished K3.1b phosphorylation in the presence of PMA, suggesting that both cPKCs and nPKCs contribute to PMA-induced phosphorylation of Kv3.1b channels. In contrast to the case of basal phosphorylation in MNTB neurons, the PKC-δ inhibitor rottlerin (10 μm) had no effect"
https://openalex.org/W2147780927,"The term mitotic catastrophe (MC) was coined to describe the mammalian cell death caused by aberrant mitosis. MC occurs with features that are fundamentally different from those typifying other forms of cell death, including apoptosis. We report here for the first time that the Rac-activating toxin CNF1 interferes with the occurrence of MC and leads to aneuploidy and multinucleation. This seems to be in line with the anti-apoptotic activity of the toxin and consistent with the hypothesis that points at CNF1 as a toxin bearing a carcinogenic potential."
https://openalex.org/W2166795574,"The cellular composition of an atherosclerotic lesion is determined by cell infiltration, proliferation, and apoptosis. The tumor suppressor gene retinoblastoma (Rb) has been shown to regulate both cell proliferation and cell death in many cell types. To study the role of macrophage Rb in the development of atherosclerosis, we used apoE-deficient mice with a macrophage-restricted deletion of Rb (Rb(del) mice) and control littermates (Rb(fl) mice). After 12 wk feeding a cholesterol-rich diet, the Rb(del) mice showed a 51% increase in atherosclerotic lesion area with a 39% increase in the relative number of advanced lesions. Atherosclerotic lesions showed a 13% decrease in relative macrophage area and a 46% increase in relative smooth muscle cell area, reflecting the more advanced state of the lesions. The increase in atherosclerosis was independent of in vitro macrophage modified lipoprotein uptake or cytokine production. Whereas macrophage-restricted Rb deletion did not affect lesional macrophage apoptosis, a clear 2.6-fold increase in lesional macrophage proliferation was observed. These studies demonstrate that macrophage Rb is a suppressing factor in the progression of atherosclerosis by reducing macrophage proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2078065643,"We previously isolated 80 TISP (transcript induced in spermiogenesis) genes whose transcription is dramatically induced during spermiogenesis. Our analysis here of the expression of these genes in the testis of the cAMP-responsive element modulator (CREM)-null mouse revealed that 54 TISP genes are under the transcriptional regulation of CREM. One CREM-regulated gene is TISP40, which encodes a basic leucine zipper (bZip)-type transcription factor bearing a transmembrane domain that generates the two proteins Tisp40α and Tisp40β. Both of these proteins function by binding to UPRE (unfolded protein-response element) but do not recognize CRE motifs. We show here that Tisp40α mRNA is generated under the direct transcriptional regulation of CREM. CREMτ and Tisp40 form a heterodimer, which functions through CRE but not through UPRE. Furthermore, binding ability of CREM to CRE is dramatically up-regulated by forming a heterodimer with Tisp40αΔTM, a truncated form of Tisp40α that lacks the transmembrane domain. We confirmed that Tisp40 and CREM actually bind to the Tisp40 promoter in vivo by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Finally, we demonstrate that the Tisp40ΔTM-CREMτ heterodimer acts as a recruiter of HIRA, a histone chaperone, to CRE. Taken together, we propose that Tisp40 is an important transcriptional regulator during spermiogenesis.

Taken together, we propose that Tisp40 is an important transcriptional regulator during spermiogenesis. Spermatogenesis is a complex process that produces mature sperm. It involves three phases, namely, proliferation of spermatogonia, meiosis, and spermiogenesis. During spermiogenesis, sperm nuclei become tightly packed with proteins, first by small basic proteins called transition proteins and then by protamines (1Tanaka H. Baba T. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 344-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, it was believed that none or only very few genes are expressed after meiosis (2Hecht N.B. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Challenging this belief, however, is our previous report that shows many spermatid-specific genes (TISP, 2The abbreviations used are: TISP, transcript induced in spermiogenesis; CREM, cyclic AMP-response element modulator; CREB, cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein; CBP, CREB-binding protein; EMSA, electrophoresis mobility shift assay; DTT, dithiothreitol; HA, hemagglutinin; Rip, regulated intramembrane proteolysis; Tnp, transition proteins; Prm, protamine; UPR, unfolded protein response; UPRE, unfolded protein-response element; bZip, basic leucine zipper; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay; wt, wild type.2The abbreviations used are: TISP, transcript induced in spermiogenesis; CREM, cyclic AMP-response element modulator; CREB, cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein; CBP, CREB-binding protein; EMSA, electrophoresis mobility shift assay; DTT, dithiothreitol; HA, hemagglutinin; Rip, regulated intramembrane proteolysis; Tnp, transition proteins; Prm, protamine; UPR, unfolded protein response; UPRE, unfolded protein-response element; bZip, basic leucine zipper; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay; wt, wild type. transcript induced in spermiogenesis) are up-regulated in the round spermatids after meiosis (3Fujii T. Tamura K. Masai K. Tanaka H. Nishimune Y. Nojima H. EMBO. Rep. 2002; 3: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). It is known that the bZip-type transcription factor CREM acts as a master regulator of spermatogenesis (4Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 2005; 434: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). CREM generates many alternatively spliced forms. One of these is called ICER (inducible cAMP early repressor), which is an inactive form of CREM that suppresses CRE-mediated gene expression during meiosis. In post-meiotic cells, however, CREM generates active forms called CREMτ, -τ1, and -τ2, which up-regulate many CRE-mediated genes (4Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 2005; 434: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 5Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2000; 56: 228-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CREM-null mice display male infertility: while the spermatogonia differentiate normally into round spermatids, all the elongating spermatids are eliminated by apoptosis during spermiogenesis, which results in the lack of late spermatids (6Blendy J.A. Kaestner K.H. Weinbauer G.F. Nieschlag E. Schutz G. Nature. 1996; 380: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 7Nantel F. Monaco L. Foulkes N.S. Masquilier D. LeMeur M. Henriksen K.

Macho B. Sassone-Corsi P. Int. J. Androl. 2004; 27: 322-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is thought that CREM is an essential factor for spermiogenesis. Some spermiogenic genes, such as the genes for transition proteins (Tnp)1, Tnp2, protamine (Prm)1, Prm2, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), have been identified as the direct transcriptional targets of CREM (6Blendy J.A. Kaestner K.H. Weinbauer G.F. Nieschlag E. Schutz G. Nature. 1996; 380: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 7Nantel F. Monaco L. Foulkes N.S. Masquilier D. LeMeur M. Henriksen K. Dierich A. Parvinen M. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1996; 380: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). However, CREM probably regulates the expression of many other spermiogenic genes because defects in the Tnp1, Tnp-2, Prm1, Prm2, and ACE genes alone cannot fully explain the male infertility of CREM-null mice (6Blendy J.A. Kaestner K.H. Weinbauer G.F. Nieschlag E. Schutz G. Nature. 1996; 380: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 7Nantel F. Monaco L. Foulkes N.S. Masquilier D. LeMeur M. Henriksen K. Dierich A. Parvinen M. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1996; 380: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). For example, mice whose Tnp1 and Tnp2 genes are both knocked out can still produce epididymal sperm, unlike CREM-null mice (6Blendy J.A. Kaestner K.H. Weinbauer G.F. Nieschlag E. Schutz G. Nature. 1996; 380: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 7Nantel F. Monaco L. Foulkes N.S. Masquilier D. LeMeur M. Henriksen K. Dierich A. Parvinen M. Sassone-Corsi P.

Reprod. 2004; 71: 1220-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, identification of other novel target genes of CREM would shed light on the mechanisms regulating spermiogenesis. CREB (cAMP-response element-binding protein)-binding protein (CBP) acts as a co-activator of many transcription factor through its histone acetyl transferase activity, which is recruited by transcription factors on promoter regions and acetylates histones (10Servillo G. Della Fazia M.A. Sassone-Corsi P. Exp. Cell Res. 2002; 275: 143-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In case of CREB, recruitment of CBP to the promoter region by CREB is dependent on its phosphorylation (11Chrivia J.C. Kwok R.P.S. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1767) Google Scholar). Once recruited, CBP acetylates histones to facilitate new transcription. In contrast, CREM is not phosphorylated in male germ cells. Consequently, instead of CBP, ACT (activator of CREM in testis) is believed to function as the trans-activator of CREM in male germ cells (7Nantel F. Monaco L. Foulkes N.S. Masquilier D. LeMeur M. Henriksen K. Dierich A. Parvinen M. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1996; 380: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 12Fimia G.M. De Cesare M.D. Sassone-Corsi P.

Prior to chromatin condensation, ACT is exported by Kif17b, a testis-specific kinesin, independent of its motor domain, and this export is inhibited by leptomycin B (14Macho B. Brancorsini S. Fimia G.M. Setou M. Hirokawa N. Sassone-Corsi P. Science. 2002; 298: 2388-2390Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 15Kotaja N. Macho B. Sassone-Corsi P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31739-31745Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Notably, while ACT-null mice display sperm abnormality, they can nevertheless produce offspring (16Kotaja N. De Cesare M.D. Macho M. Monaco L. Brancorsini S. Goossens E. Tournaya H. Gansmuller A. Sassone-Corsi P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 10620-10625Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This observation reveals that the trans-activation of CREM is retained in ACT-null mice, which indicates that another, as yet unknown, factor can also act as an activator of CREM, probably by complementing ACT function. Although CREM is an essential factor for spermiogenesis, precisely how CREM regulates the transcription of haploid-specific genes remains unknown. Here we report that a novel regulator, Tisp40, acts as a recruiter of chromatin modifier to CRE by forming heterodimer with CREM during mouse spermiogenesis. Plasmid Construction—To prepare pCMV-3FLAG-Tisp40α/βΔTM, pCMV-6Myc-CREMτ (wt and S117A), pCDNA3-CREMτ (wt and S117A), and several reporter plasmids, we generated cDNA fragments containing the appropriate open reading frames and the promoter regions by PCR. The lack of artificial point mutations from PCR was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the generated plasmid DNA. p5XATF6 (UPRE)-GL3 is a kind gift from Prof. K. Mori (Kyoto University). Northern Blot Analysis, in Vitro Pulldown Assay, and Western Blot Analysis—Preparation of RNA from the testes of CREM(+/+) and CREM(–/–) mice and Northern blot analysis were performed as described previously (3Fujii T. Tamura K. Masai K. Tanaka H. Nishimune Y. Nojima H. EMBO. Rep. 2002; 3: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). TISP cDNA inserts cut out of the plasmids by EcoRI/NotI restriction enzymes were radiolabeled by [32P]dCTP with the random primer DNA labeling kit (TaKaRa, Japan) and used as hybridization probes. The Northern blots were probed with radiolabeled glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA as a loading control. GST-Tisp40αΔTM was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified on glutathione-Sepharose 4B. HA-CREMτ was expressed by using the TnT expression system (Promega). We mixed GST-Tisp40αΔTM with HA-CREMτ on glutathione-Sepharose 4B and conducted Western blot analysis after extensive washing. HA-CREMτ expressed in TnT lysates was used as a positive control whereas GST alone served as a negative control. Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (17Nagamori I. Yabuta N. Fujii T. Tanaka H. Yomogida K. Nishimune Y. Nojima H. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 575-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Cell Culture, Transient Transfection, Luciferase Assay, Co-immunoprecipitation Assay, and EMSA—The culture of HeLa S3 cells, their transient transfection, the luciferase assay and EMSA (electrophoresis mobility shift assay) have been described (17Nagamori I. Yabuta N. Fujii T. Tanaka H. Yomogida K. Nishimune Y. Nojima H. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 575-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For the co-immunoprecipitation assay, transfected HeLa cell proteins were extracted in binding buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 150 mm KCL, 5 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.05% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and 1,000 units micrococcal nuclease for 1 h at 4°C. The lysates were centrifuged by 17,400 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then incubated with protein G-Sepharose with rotation for 1 h at 4°C and precipitated by centrifugation. The supernatant was subsequently incubated with anti-Myc antibody (PL14;MBL), anti-CREM antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or control IgG with rotation overnight at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose was then added to this mixture, incubated with rotation for 1 h at 4°C, and precipitated by centrifugation. After extensive washing, the precipitated proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-Tisp40 antibody or anti-CREM antibody as the probes. To detect the endogenous interaction between CREM and Tisp40, we used two testes from adult mice and 1 μg of anti-CREM antibody, anti-Tisp40 antibody, or rabbit IgG. In Vivo Electroporation Assay—Reporter DNA fragments containing the Tisp40 upstream region, the luciferase gene, and the SV40 poly(A) signal were amplified from the recombinant luciferase constructs by PCR with the following oligonucleotide pair: RV Primer3, 5′-CTAGCAAAATAGGCTGTCCC-3′ and RV Primer4, 5′-GACGATAGTCATGCCCCGCG-3′. The control fragment was also amplified from the RL plasmid using the oligonucleotide pair: RL5, 5′-TTTTGCTCACATGGCTCGAC-3′ and RL3, 5′-CGCACATTTCCCCGAAAAGT-3′. The in vivo electroporation assay was performed exactly as described (18Ike A. Ohta H. Onishi M. Iguchi N. Nishimune Y. Nozaki M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). ChIP Assay—Germ cells from two testes were fixed in 500 μl of 1% formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline(–) for 5 min at 4 °C. The fixed germ cells were sonicated (Output 7, ON 30 s OFF 60 s, 5 cycles at 4 °C, using handy sonic PR-20, TOMY, Tokyo) after phosphate-buffered saline(–) washed two times. 200 μl of sonicated chromatin-protein complexes were diluted in 1.8 ml of ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, and 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). Diluted chromatin-protein complexes were immune-precipitated by antibody against CREM, Tisp40, or HIRA (mixed WC15 and WC19), respectively, and antibody against rabbit or mouse IgG (negative control) at 4 °C overnight after blocking with 800 μg of single strand DNA. The immune complexes were precipitated with protein G-Sepharose followed by washing with low salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, and 150 mm NaCl), high salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 500 mm NaCl), LiCl buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Np40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 1 mm EDTA). The immune-purified complexes of chromatin proteins were eluted in 50 ml of elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3, and 10 mm DTT) twice, and 4 μl of 5 m NaCl were added to eluted mixtures and incubated for 4 h at 65 °C. Then, 0.2 μlof0.5 m EDTA, 4 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 0.2 μl of 20 mg/ml proteinase K were added and incubated for 1 h at 45°C. These chromatin DNA were purified by PheOH/CHCl3 extractions and EtOH precipitations. Purified chromatin DNA was used as PCR templates. PCR was conducted for 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1 min (3 min in the final cycle). Purification of Protein Complexes by Pulldown Assays—Germ cells were suspended in sucrose buffer (0.25 m sucrose, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 170 mm KCl) and precipitated by centrifugation at 600 × g for 10 min. The nuclear pellets were resuspended in binding buffer supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), 0.5 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 2,000 units of micrococcal nuclease and rotated for 1 h at 4 °C. These mixtures were centrifuged at 17,400 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and this supernatant enriched with chromatin-binding proteins was purified using P11 column chromatography for 1 h at 4°C. The mixture was eluted in 5 ml of P11 elution buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH pH7.6, 1 m KCl, 1 mm DTT, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 10% glycerol) from the P11 column by rinsing with binding buffer. Eluted extracts, which contain many large complexes, were dialyzed in 400 ml of P11 binding buffer (25 mm Hepes-KOH pH7.6, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm DTT, 2.5 mm CaCl2,5mm MgCl2, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.05 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10% glycerol) for 3 h at 4°C. Eluted extracts from P11 column were mixed with the GST-fused trans-regulational regions of Tisp40α/β or CREMτ with glutathione-Sepharose overnight at 4 °C after being blocked by glutathione-Sepharose fused to GST alone. These pull-downed complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by silver staining after extensive rinsing. The Expression of 54 TISP Genes Is Regulated by a CREM-dependent Pathway—To determine how many spermatid-specific genes are directly up-regulated by CREM, we examined the effect of the CREM-null mutation on the expression of 80 TISP genes that we previously comprehensively identified as mouse spermatid-specific genes (3Fujii T. Tamura K. Masai K. Tanaka H. Nishimune Y. Nojima H. EMBO. Rep. 2002; 3: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis revealed that the expression of 54 TISP genes is dramatically reduced in testis from CREM(–/–) mice (Fig. 1), which suggests that these genes are under the transcriptional control of CREM. Comparison of the intensities of the bands allowed us to classify these 54 TISP genes into three classes (A–C, see Fig. 1). The 38 class A TISP genes showed no expression in the CREM(–/–) testis. Consistent with previous reports (6Blendy J.A. Kaestner K.H. Weinbauer G.F. Nieschlag E. Schutz G. Nature. 1996; 380: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar, 7Nantel F. Monaco L. Foulkes N.S. Masquilier D. LeMeur M. Henriksen K. Dierich A. Parvinen M. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1996; 380: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), protamine1 (TISP18), protamine2 (TISP1), and transition protein2 (TISP28) belong to this class. TISP40 is also a member of this group. The 11 class B clones, which showed intense expression in the CREM(+/+) testis, still exhibited weak expression in the CREM(–/–) testis. The 5 class C clones showed at least two bands; one was expressed at almost equal levels in the CREM(–/–) and CREM(+/+) testes, whereas the other band was predominantly found only in the CREM(+/+) testis. The expression of the remaining 26 TISP genes did not appear to differ between the CREM(–/–) and CREM(+/+) testes (data not shown), despite the expression restricted to the spermatids (3Fujii T. Tamura K. Masai K. Tanaka H. Nishimune Y. Nojima H. EMBO. Rep. 2002; 3: 367-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This suggests a novel transcriptional pathway exists during spermiogenesis that is independent of CREM. Tisp40α mRNA Is Directly Transcribed by CREMτ through the CRE2 Site—We previously showed that TISP40 generates two proteins named Tisp40α and Tisp40β, and that transcription of the mRNAs for these proteins occurs after step 5, which is later than the transcription of the CREM gene (17Nagamori I. Yabuta N. Fujii T. Tanaka H. Yomogida K. Nishimune Y. Nojima H. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 575-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because both of these mRNAs, which will be referred to hereafter as Tisp40α/β mRNAs, were not observed in CREM-null mice, we speculated that the transcription of the Tisp40α/β mRNAs is under the direct control of CREM. To test this assumption, we performed promoter assays. Compared with Tisp40α mRNA, Tisp40β mRNA contains an extra 5′-region that adds 55 amino acids that may act as an acidic trans-activational domain (17Nagamori I. Yabuta N. Fujii T. Tanaka H. Yomogida K. Nishimune Y. Nojima H. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 575-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We found two CRE motifs between the transcriptional start sites of Tisp40α and Tisp40β. We named the upstream CRE site, CRE1, and the downstream CRE site, CRE2 (Fig. 2A). To determine whether CREM actually binds to these CRE sites, we performed EMSA and found that in vitro expressed HA-CREMτ fusion protein bound to both the CRE1 and CRE2 sites (Fig. 2B, lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6), but not to mutated CRE1 and mutated CRE2 sites (lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8). To confirm that the HA-CREMτ-shifted CRE2 band actually contains HA-CREMτ, we performed a supershift assay with anti-HA antibody (3F10), where the antibody was allowed to associate with HA-CREMτ before the radiolabeled CRE2 probe was added to the reaction mixture. This confirmed that the HA-CREMτ-shifted band indeed contained HA-CREMτ (Fig. 2C, lane 6). However, we could not detect HA-CREMτ bound to the CRE1 site by the supershift assay, probably because the interaction of HA-CREMτ with the CRE1 site is very weak (lane 3). Successful competition using 4-, 10-, or 20-fold molar excesses of CRE1 or CRE2 oligonucleotides also confirmed CREMτ associates specifically with wild-type CRE1 and CRE2 (Fig. 2D, lanes 1–5 and 11–15). In contrast, competition assays using mutated CRE1 and CRE2 site oligonucleotides did not inhibit the binding between HA-CREMτ and CRE very efficiently (Fig. 2D, lanes 6–10 and 16–20). Competition assays to compare the ability of CREMτ to bind to CRE1 (wt) and CRE2 (wt) showed that CRE2 (wt) efficiently reduced the binding activity of CREMτ to both CRE1 and CRE2, whereas CRE1 (wt) only reduced the binding of CREMτ to CRE1 (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that CREMτ prefers to bind to the CRE2 site rather than to the CRE1 site (Fig. 2, B–E). We next determined the putative cis-element required for the expression of Tisp40α/β mRNA in vivo. To do so, we performed the in vivo electroporation assay that permits transient expression of reporter plasmids in the testes of mice; this assay was previously used to identify the cis-element in haploid spermatid-specific genes (18Ike A. Ohta H. Onishi M. Iguchi N. Nishimune Y. Nozaki M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We thus constructed reporter plasmids that harbored a deletion or a point mutation in the Tisp40α/β promoter (Fig. 3A), transferred them into the seminiferous tubules of the murine testes by electroporation and measured the luciferase activity. The results were normalized with full-length Tisp40 promoter-driven Renilla luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 3A, the relative reporter expression of the 5′ deletion mutants –2071∼+151, –971∼+151, –311∼+151, –220∼+151, and –101∼+151 (lines 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6, respectively) was not significantly reduced when compared with the activity of the full-length Tisp40 promoter. In contrast, the relative reporter expression of the –2071∼–971 3′ deletion mutant (line 3) and the –50∼+151 5′ deletion mutant (line 7) was reduced to about 70% of the expression driven by the full-length Tisp40 promoter. These data indicate that the region –101∼-50 of the Tisp40α promoter region is important for the expression of Tisp40α. This region contains the CRE2 site but not the CRE1 site. Consequently, we then prepared Tisp40α reporter plasmids bearing mutations in the CRE1 and/or CRE2 sites and transferred them into the testes by electroporation. We found that the reporter expression of the ΔCRE1 promoter was not reduced (line 8), but the reporter expression of the ΔCRE2 single mutant (line 9) and the ΔCRE1/2 double mutant (line 10) were reduced to similar levels as the –2071∼-971 3′ deletion mutant (line 3) or –50∼+151 5′ deletion mutant (line 7). These data are consistent with the results obtained by EMSA (Fig. 2) and indicate that the CRE2 site is essential for Tisp40α mRNA expression. Finally, to confirm that CREMτ actually up-regulates Tisp40α mRNA, we performed luciferase assays by cotransfecting HeLa cells with a reporter plasmid containing the Tisp40α/β promoter upstream of firefly luciferase cDNA with or without the 6Myc-CREMτ-expressing vector. The results were normalized by thymidine kinase promoter-driven Renilla luciferase activity. We found that 6Myc-CREMτ-activated transcription through the Tisp40α/β and Tisp40α promoters but not through the Tisp40β promoter (Fig. 3B). From these data, we conclude that Tisp40α is a direct transcriptional target of CREM in vivo. Tisp40ΔTM Associates with CREMτ Both in Vitro and in Vivo—Because both the Tisp40α and Tisp40β proteins (denoted from here on in as Tisp40α/β proteins) are expressed in the spermatid, we reasoned that Tisp40α/β proteins may form a complex with CREMτ. To test this, we performed in vitro pulldown assays using GST-Tisp40αΔTM and HA-CREMτ. We first examined the quality of GST-Tisp40αΔTM and GST alone by Western blot analysis with anti-GST antibody (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 3). Although GST-Tisp40αΔTM was slightly degraded (indicated by *), full-length GST-Tisp40αΔTM was also detected (indicated by #) at levels sufficient for pulldown assays. Thus, we mixed the purified GST-Tisp40αΔTM (or GST alone) with HA-CREMτ, which had been expressed by using the in vitro transcription-translation system (TnT). We then conducted Western blot analysis after extensively washing the mixture to remove possible nonspecifically associating proteins. We found that GST-Tisp40αΔTM associated with HA-CREMτ in vitro (lane 6), unlike GST alone (lane 5). Next, we examined the association between the Tisp40α/β and CREMτ proteins in cultured cells by performing co-immunoprecipitation assays after transfecting HeLa cells with pCMV-6Myc-Tisp40α/βΔTM along with pCDNA3-CREMτ or empty vector. We first confirmed the transfection was successful by detecting the bands for 6Myc-Tisp40α/βΔTM and CREMτ in the whole cell extract (WCE) with anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (PL14) and anti-CREM polyclonal antibody, respectively (Fig. 4B, upper two panels). That anti-Myc antibody successfully immunoprecipitated 6Myc-Tisp40α/βΔTM (lanes 3–6, second panel from the bottom) was also confirmed by detecting the relevant bands in the Western blot. When the WCE was immunoprecipitated by anti-Myc antibody and probed with anti-CREM antibody, a band for CREMτ (indicated by an arrow) was detected only when Tisp40αΔTM (lane 5, bottom panel) or Tisp40βΔTM (lane 6, bottom panel) was produced together with CREMτ. This indicates that CREM associates with the Tisp40 proteins in HeLa cells. We could not perform reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments, because the anti-CREM antibody nonspecifically recognized 6Myc-Tisp40α/βΔTM proteins when they were immunoprecipitated with anti-CREM antibody (arrowheads in bottom panel and data not shown). Finally, we confirmed the physiological association of Tisp40 with CREM in the mouse testis by performing a co-immunoprecipitation assay using whole testis cell extract. As shown in Fig. 4C, CREM proteins were precipitated with anti-CREM antibody but not with control IgG (Fig. 4C, upper panel, lanes 1–3). When precipitated by anti-CREM antibody, Tisp40 protein was co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. 4C, lower panel, lanes 1–3). Here, the reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation with anti-Tisp40 antibody was confirmed (lane 4). These data suggest that Tisp40ΔTM and CREMτ form a heterodimer in the mouse testis. CREMτ Inhibits the Trans-activation of Tisp40β through UPRE—It has been shown that Tisp40ΔTM binds to UPRE but not to CRE (17Nagamori I. Yabuta N. Fujii T. Tanaka H. Yomogida K. Nishimune Y. Nojima H. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 575-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We thus investigated whether the Tisp40ΔTM-CREM heterodimer functions through UPRE or CRE. When we cotransfected HeLa cells with the pGL3–5XUPRE reporter plasmid (kind gift from Prof. K. Mori) together with the CREMτ-expressing vector and/or the Tisp40βΔTM-expressing vector and measured the luciferase activity, we found that Tisp40βΔTM activated transcription through UPRE but its activity was suppressed by CREMτ(wt) (Fig. 5, lanes 1–3). Furthermore, CREMτ(S117A), which is a trans-inactive mutant, also suppressed the trans-activity of Tisp40βΔTM (lane 4). These data suggest that the CREM-Tisp40ΔTM heterodimer does not function through UPRE and that the ability of CREMτ to inhibit the trans-activity of Tisp40βΔTM is not because of its transcriptional activity. The Binding Ability of CREMτ with CRE Is Increased by Tisp40ΔTM—Many CREB/CREM family proteins regulate transcription by binding to the CRE motif. However, Tisp40 binds to UPRE but not CRE and regulates transcription through UPRE (17Nagamori I. Yabuta N. Fujii T. Tanaka H. Yomogida K. Nishimune Y. Nojima H. Genes Cells. 2005; 10: 575-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Because the trans-activation of Tisp40βΔTM through UPRE was inhibited by CREMτ as shown above (Fig. 5), we speculated that the Tisp40ΔTM-CREMτ heterodimer may function as a trans-activator through CRE. To test this, we cotransfected HeLa cells with the pGL3–5XCRE construct derived from the somatostatin (SOM) gene promoter together with or without vectors expressing CREMτ, Tisp40αΔTM, or Tisp40βΔTM.

We provide evidence that protease-mediated cleavage of allergens represents a mechanism that regulates allergen-induced mast cell activation. When used in molar ratios as they occur in vivo, purified beta-tryptase cleaved major grass and birch pollen allergens, resulting in defined peptide fragments as mapped by mass spectrometry. Tryptase-cleaved allergens showed reduced IgE reactivity and allergenic activity. The biological relevance is demonstrated by the fact that lysates from activated human mast cells containing tryptase levels as they occur in vivo cleaved allergens. Additionally, protamine, an inhibitor of heparin-dependent effector cell proteases, augmented allergen-induced release of mediators from effector cells. Protease-mediated allergen cleavage may represent an important mechanism for terminating allergen-induced effector cell activation."

The Cys loop family of LGICs, with the signature cysteine loop in the amino-terminal domain, includes nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, serotonin receptor type 3, γ-aminobutyric acid receptor types A and C, glycine receptors, zinc activated cation channels, and invertebrate glutamate/serotonin-activated anionic channels or GABA-gated cation channels (1Unwin N.

Studies using site-directed mutagenesis, affinity labeling, cysteine accessibility test, and electron microscopy in the last two decades have demonstrated that all of the members of this receptor family have similar structural architecture (5Karlin A. Akabas M. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1231-1244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). Each receptor is comprised of five subunits. Each subunit has a large amino-terminal extracellular domain that forms agonist-binding sites in subunit interfaces, four transmembrane domains (M1-M4) that form ion conduction pore, and a large intracellular loop that can interact with intracellular proteins for receptor targeting and regulation. The structure model of amino-terminal extracellular domain is further extended by the crystal structure of a homologous protein, acetylcholine-binding protein (6Celie P.

The structural model of nicotinic receptor transmembrane domains is also available via electron microscopy at 4 Å resolution (10Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar, 11Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). The Cys loop family of LGICs are allosteric proteins (3Changeux J.P. Edelstein S. Neuron. 1998; 21: 959-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), in which binding of a neurotransmitter to its binding site in the extracellular amino-terminal domain controls distant gating machinery in the transmembrane domain to open the ion conduction pore. The kinetic mechanism of channel activation can be best described by an allosteric model in which agonist binding and channel gating are highly coupled (3Changeux J.P. Edelstein S. Neuron. 1998; 21: 959-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar, 12Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 923-948Crossref Scopus (782) Google Scholar, 13Chang Y. Weiss D. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2542-2551Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This long range coupling of the agonist-binding domain to the gating machinery requires an interconnected allosteric network, through which binding energy can be reliably transmitted, in the form of a “conformational wave” (14Grosman C. Zhou M. Auerbach A. Nature. 2000; 403: 773-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), from the agonist-binding site to the gating machinery to open the channel. Information about this interconnected allosteric network, however, is not readily available by directly examining the structural models. Although recent experimental studies have made significant contributions toward understanding the mechanism of ligand-gated ion channel activation (4Lester H. Dibas M. Dahan D. Leite J. Dougherty D. Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 329-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 15Absalom N. Lewis T. Schofield P. Exp. Physiol. 2004; 89: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), exhaustive experimental studies are time consuming, and the activation pathway still needs to be defined. Thus, to facilitate future experimental studies, it is necessary to use computer-aided analysis to define the entire allosteric network for experimental validation. Statistical coupling analysis (SCA) is a sequence-based statistical method designed to estimate the thermodynamic coupling of two residues in a protein. The basis of this method is that the coupling of two sites in a protein, either directly or allosterically, should cause these two positions to coevolve. Such coevolved residues can be identified by analyzing a large and diverse multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of a protein family for the distribution probability of 20 amino acid residues at each position (16Lockless S. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). With this method, the degree of residue covariance at two sites, in a form of “coupling energy,” can be determined by observing the effect of perturbation at one site (extracting a subset of sequence alignment containing a relatively conserved residue at the site) on the amino acid distribution of another site. Prediction of potential interacting residues could dramatically reduce the work of exhaustive mutagenesis scanning and facilitates identification of functionally important residues in the interconnected allosteric network of the protein for the mechanisms of binding-gating coupling of the entire family. This method has been successfully used to define interconnected allosteric networks of several protein families, such as PDZ domains (16Lockless S. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar), G-proteins (17Hatley M. Lockless S. Gibson S. Gilman A. Ranganathan R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 14445-14450Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), G-protein-coupled receptors, serine proteases, globins (18Suel G. Lockless S. Wall M. Ranganathan R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), and retinoid X receptors (19Shulman A. Larson C. Mangelsdorf D. Ranganathan R. Cell. 2004; 116: 417-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). McLachlan-based substitution correlation (McBASC) is another approach to find covariant positions in a protein family (20Gobel U. Sander C. Schneider R. Valencia A. Proteins. 1994; 18: 309-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar), although it is more frequently used to find direct contacting residues (21Olmea O. Rost B. Valencia A. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 293: 1221Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). By comparing pairs of sequences in an MSA, this method assigns a score for each comparison at each position based on the change of amino acid residue properties using the McLachlan substitution matrix (22McLachlan A. J. Mol. Biol. 1971; 61: 409-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Correlation analysis (correlation coefficient) of these mutational scores between two sites from the MSA of a protein family then can be used to identify coevolved sites. In this paper, using these two approaches with different scoring systems, we have identified a cluster of genetically covariant sites in the Cys loop receptors. Mapping these positions onto the three-dimensional structural model of a nicotinic receptor subunit reveals that these positions are mainly clustered in functionally important domains, forming an interconnected allosteric network linking the agonist-binding pocket to the gating machinery via coupling domains. In addition, these highly coupled positions are also clustered in transmembrane domains, the recent focus for the sites of action of many allosteric modulators. Thus, our results revealed a genetically interconnected network that potentially serves as the activation pathway and plays an important role in allosteric modulation of the Cys loop family of LGICs. Data Source and Multiple Sequence Alignment—The amino acid sequences of subunits in the Cys loop receptor family of ligand-gated ion channels were downloaded from the Ligand-Gated Ion Channel Data base in the European Bioinformatics Institute website (www.ebi.ac.uk/compneur-srv/LGICdb/LGIC.html), where a redundancy check has been performed. Based on the length distribution histogram of all of the sequences (data not shown), we excluded those sequences that clearly do not belong to the same population. Extra long sequences (>700 residues) could have different structure, and extra short sequences (<250 residues) are likely incomplete sequences that would introduce unnatural gaps and influence coupling analysis (see Fig. 2B). Thus, these extra long and short sequences were excluded for further analysis. The remaining 389 sequences were used for analysis. All of the sequences were aligned using the Clustalw1.83 package with default parameters: 10.00 gap opening penalty, 0.20 gap extension penalty, and Gonnet series of the protein weight matrix. Because the structural model of the Torpedo nicotinic receptor is the best model available, for all calculations, the numbering in the α subunit of Torpedo california nicotinic receptor was used, ignoring the signal peptide and gaps inserted into the subunit during the sequence alignment. Statistical Coupling Analysis (SCA)—The static energy (ΔGistat) for each site i and coupling energy (ΔΔGi,jstat) between two sites, i and j, were calculated following Lockless and Ranganathan (16Lockless S. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar) using the software written in JAVA adapted from the original software written in C (kindly provided by Dr. Rama Ranganathan at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas). Correlated Mutational Analysis—Correlated mutational analysis was carried out using the McBASC (23Fodor A. Aldrich R. Proteins. 2004; 56: 211-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The program for this calculation, written in JAVA, was downloaded from Anthony A. Fodor's website (www.afodor.net), modified for formatted output, and executed under a JAVA environment. Clustering Analysis—To extract information from the large data sets for coupling or correlated mutation analysis, a clustering analysis was performed using Hierarchical Clustering Explorer 3.0 by Jinwook Seo at University of Maryland (www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/multi-cluster/hce3.html). The coupling energy/correlation coefficient data matrices without normalization were clustered with complete linkage. Visual Presentation—For visual presentation of the highly coupled residues in the structural model of a subunit, the structure of the α subunit of the Torpedo marmorata nicotinic receptor was downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information website with the Protein Data Bank identification code of 2BG9. The sequence of this subunit is incomplete and therefore not included in covariance calculation. However, it is highly homologous to the α subunit of T. california nicotinic receptor, and both subunits have identical numbering. Thus, the sites with high coupling energy or correlation coefficient were directly mapped onto the above structural model without further conversion, using the molecular graphics program DEEPVIEW/SwisspdbViewer v3.7 (us.expasy.org/spdbv/). The resulting image was saved as a POV-Ray 3.5 scene file. The final image of the model was rendered by POV-Ray 3.6 software (www.povray.org/download/). Visualization of the coupling energy result before clustering (Fig. 2A) was accomplished by using TreeView version 1.60 (rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm). Static Energy—To calculate the coupling, we started by counting occurrences of amino acids at each position in the MSA. Fig. 1A shows the relative frequencies of the amino acid residues in the Cys loop family of LGICs (open bars) and in all proteins from the Swiss-Prot data base (filled bars) used for calculation. Note that the frequencies of amino acid residues in the MSA slightly deviate from those in all proteins. Hydrophobic residues, such as Leu, Ile, Phe, Val, and Trp in the MSA, had slightly higher frequencies than average. Small and some hydrophilic residues such as Gly, Ala, and Lys had lower frequencies than average. This is expected for membrane proteins with multiple hydrophobic transmembrane stretches. The amino acid frequencies at each site were then determined and converted to probabilities for all 20 amino acids (16Lockless S. Ranganathan R. Science. 1999; 286: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1029) Google Scholar). The probabilities then were used to calculate the static energy. If the amino acid distribution at a site is similar to the distribution for all positions, then the site is not conserved, and the static energy approaches zero. In contrast, if a site is conserved, its amino acid distribution will deviate from the mean, and the static energy at that site will be higher. Thus, the magnitude of the static energy represents the extent of deviation of the amino acid distribution at each site from the mean in the MSA and therefore represents the extent of residue conservation at that site. Fig. 1B shows the static energy for all 437 positions using the numbering of T. california nicotinic receptor α subunit. Note that a stretch of positions toward the carboxyl terminus had low static energy. This region corresponds to the large intracellular loop between M3 and M4, the most diversified region in this protein family. The static energy for all positions was then mapped onto the structural model of the Torpedo nicotinic receptor α subunit (Fig. 1C). The most conserved positions (in red) are mainly located in the protein core near the binding site, and intermediately conserved positions are clustered in functionally important domains for binding, coupling, and channel gating as indicated by arrows. Coupling Energy—To calculate the statistical coupling energy, we performed perturbation analysis as described by Suel et al. (18Suel G. Lockless S. Wall M. Ranganathan R. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Briefly, sequences containing a conserved residue (>30%) at a particular site were taken out of the MSA to form a subset. There are 253 sites with at least one relatively conserved residue (>30%). Thus, 253 perturbations were performed (one perturbation at each site), and 253 subsets were generated. The extracted sequences in a subset containing only the conserved residue at the perturbation site resulted in amino acid redistribution at this and all the other sites. The amino acid probabilities at each site in a subset were then determined and used for coupling energy calculation. If the perturbation at one site significantly changes the amino acid distribution at another site, then these two sites have high coupling energy. Otherwise, they have low coupling energy. The calculation resulted in a 437 × 253 matrix of the coupling energy (Fig. 2A). In some regions of the receptor, such as the large intracellular loop (sites 301-402) between the third and fourth transmembrane domains with the most diversified sequences and low static energy (Fig. 1B), the alignment generated large gaps at many positions. To determine whether gaps can influence the coupling result, we examined the relationship between the number of gaps at each position and the mean coupling energy of all positions in response to the same perturbation. Fig. 2B plots the number of gaps against the mean coupling energy for each perturbation. Note that all of the positions with more than 60 gaps had high mean coupling, suggesting the number of gaps does have some influence in the coupling energy calculation. To avoid this potential influence, we discarded positions with more than 60 gaps and most of the M3-M4 intracellular loop (sites 296-392) for further analysis in both rows (coupling) and columns (perturbation). This resulted in a 311 × 219 matrix. To identify highly coupled sites from this large data set, we performed a clustering analysis. Fig. 3A shows the clustering result of coupling energy for this matrix with 219 rows (perturbation) and 311 columns. Note that the sites with high coupling energy are mainly clustered in the bottom right as indicated by the three yellow boxes. Fig. 3B is a closer view of these clusters. The positions of all of the columns in this highly coupled cluster showed a similar coupling pattern to many perturbations, suggesting that they are covariant in response to same set of perturbations and thus are mutually coupled. The detailed positions in Fig. 3B are listed in Table 1.TABLE 1Highly coupled sites identified by SCA or McBASCSCAMcBASCSCAMcBASCSCAMcBASCSCAMcBASC7121121226276111221222302772212312323128028039124232232281281411261262342824848130235286491321322362362915013713724024029252521462412412932935314924224239839855150150248399399676716624940240281811702502504049017325340540591911752552554089292176176256256410959520020025825841141196203259412972112672674159898212212268268421421102213270422422112217272272425118219219273273429120120222275275 Open table in a new tab Correlated Mutation Analysis—With the same set of MSA, we performed correlated mutation analysis using the McBASC method. This resulted in a 437 × 437 matrix (data not shown). Similarly, to extract information from the large data set, we first removed positions with large gaps (>60) and intracellular loop (sites 296-392) to avoid potential influence of gaps and improper alignment. The remaining data were clustered using the Hierarchical Clustering Explorer 3.0 software. The results are shown in Fig. 4A. Note that there is a high correlation coefficient cluster (the yellow box in the bottom right corner) from the large background. The details of this cluster with high correlation coefficient are shown in Fig. 4B, and the positions in this cluster are listed in Table 1. In search for the activation pathway, we used two statistical analyses along with clustering to systematically identify the genetically interconnected positions in the Cys loop family of ligand-gated ion channels. Highly coupled positions predicted by both methods overlapped by nearly 70% (see below). Mapping these positions onto the three-dimensional structural model demonstrated that these highly coupled positions were mainly clustered in important functional domains, linking the binding pocket through coupling domains to the gating machinery. Thus, our results suggest an interconnected network that may serve as the allosteric activation pathway, coupling agonist binding to channel function. The finding can be used as a guide for experimental design and to facilitate elucidation of the activation mechanism for the Cys loop family of LGICs. Comparison of Coupling and Correlation Results—To compare the identified covariant positions by the two methods, we list these positions in Table 1. Note that positions predicted by the two methods substantially overlap. In fact, the overlapping sites represent 62% of the total number of positions predicted by SCA and 65% of the total number of positions predicted by McBASC. If we take an additional stringent step by removing the sites with 20 or more gaps (sites 7, 11, 22, 81, 95, 166, 230, 240, 398, 399, 425, and 429), then the results are more consistent, and the overlapping sites represent 69 and 68% for the predictions by SCA and McBASC, respectively. The prediction differences could be due to different scoring methods: SCA uses amino acid probability and observes changes in the probability distribution in response to a perturbation at a site by extracting a fraction of total number of sequences containing a relatively conserved residue, whereas McBASC uses a score matrix with consideration of amino acid properties and compares all possible pairs. Thus, theoretically McBASC more effectively uses sequence data and therefore could be a better predictor for genetically covariant positions in a protein family. Nevertheless, the positions predicted by both methods are the most reliable ones with high coupling. Positions predicted by only one method still should be coupled but with slightly lower coupling strength. To visualize this genetically interconnected network, we mapped the positions predicted by both methods (after removing the sites with 20 or more gaps) in the three-dimensional structure of the Torpedo nicotinic receptor α subunit (Fig. 5A). Each position in the high coupling cluster is shown with its side chain and color-coded as follows: red represents the positions predicted only by McBASC; green represents positions predicted only by SCA; and yellow represents positions predicted by both methods. Note that yellow residues form a sparse network with high density in binding domains, coupling region, and gating machinery. The red and green residues further fill gaps, forming an interconnected network. Two salient features are apparent in this interconnected network. First, they are highly clustered in functionally important domains connecting the agonist-binding site through the coupling region to the gating machinery, forming a putative activation pathway. Second, many positions are concentrated in a region of the recent focus for the sites of action of many allosteric modulators (24Olsen R. Chang C. Li G. Hanchar H. Wallner M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 68: 1675-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar): transmembrane domains. These two aspects are further discussed in detail below. Allosteric Activation Pathway—The strategic location of the highly coupled residues strongly suggests their importance in channel function. The agonist-binding pocket of a receptor is located in the amino-terminal domain at a interface between two subunits, each contributing three binding loops (7Brejc K. van Dijk W.J. Klaassen R.V. Schuurmans M. van Der Oost J. Smit A.B. Sixma T.K. Nature. 2001; 411: 269-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 (B and C) plots highly coupled residues in the context of other residues in two different views (principal face and complementary face). The residues in the high coupling cluster for all three colors in Fig. 5A are now in yellow. Important binding sites are highlighted with red in the principal face and cyan in the complementary face. For the convenience of numbering, both faces are shown in the same subunit. In reality, this is only true for homomeric channels in that the same subunit contributes both the principal face and the complementary face of the binding sites. In heteromeric channels, the principal and complementary faces of the binding pocket are in different subunits. The overlapping residues are in orange for the overlapping between red and yellow or in green for overlapping between cyan and yellow. The gate forming residue, the conserved M2 Leu, is highlighted in purple. Note that only two highly coupled positions (sites 55 and 149) overlap with binding site residues. This is because many functionally important residues are highly conserved and nonvariant and thus escape detection by covariant analysis. However, these binding site residues are flanked by highly coupled residues in both the principal and complementary faces (Fig. 5, B and C). With the exception that predicted high coupling positions flank binding residues in loop E from the top of the molecule (Fig. 5C, sites 67 and 112), all of the other positions form an interconnected network connecting the binding pocket through the coupling region (see below) to the gating machinery. Interestingly, in the amino-terminal domain, the highly coupled residues are distributed only in the inner sheet. This is consistent with current understanding of the activation mechanism as suggested by 4 Å electron microscopic study: activation involves a clockwise rotation of the inner sheet of the amino-terminal domain around its own axis in each subunit (10Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar, 11Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). The highly coupled positions also clustered in the contact region between the amino-terminal domain and transmembrane domain. This is a region that is believed to be crucial in coupling binding to channel gating. In fact, the coupling between amino-terminal domain and channel domain has been postulated to be mediated by the M2-M3 linker (25Bera A. Chatav M. Akabas M. J. Biol.

The function of syntaxin relies on its proper trafficking to and targeting at the target membrane. The mechanisms underlying the trafficking and targeting of syntaxin to its physiological sites remain poorly understood. Here we have analyzed the trafficking of syntaxin 1A in INS-1 and CHO cells. We have identified the transmembrane domain together with several flanking positive-charged amino acids as the minimal domain required for the membrane delivery. Interestingly, we found that SNARE motif-exposed syntaxin 1A mutants were retained in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and failed to transport to the cell surface in the absence of SNAP-25, suggesting that the exposure of the SNARE motif causes ER retention and complexation with SNAP-25 helps the ER escape. Finally, our data propose two key roles for the Habc domain: to protect nonspecific interaction by masking the SNARE motif and to participate in the clustering of syntaxin 1A to the fusion sites in the plasma membrane.

(soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins play a central role in the process of intracellular membrane fusion in eukaryotic cells (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Hong W.

Metab. 2005; 16: 81-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 3Ungar D. Hughson F.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2003; 19: 493-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Intracellular SNAREs can be divided into two categories: the v-SNAREs located on carrier vesicles and the t-SNAREs present on target compartments (4Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar, 5Hay J.C. Scheller R.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The interaction between SNAREs present on two opposing membranes is generally believed to provide the driving force to initiate membrane fusion. Syntaxin 1A (Stx1A) is a t-SNARE predominantly located at the plasma membrane and has been shown to be essential for vesicle fusion (6Ferro-Novick S. Jahn R. Nature. 1994; 370: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). The essential requirement of Stx1A for exocytosis has been demonstrated in that deletion of its homologues leads to complete loss of synaptic transmission in Drosophila (7Broadie K. Prokop A. Bellen H.J. O'Kane C.J. Schulze K.L. Sweeney S.T. Neuron. 1995; 15: 663-673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) and complete paralysis in Caenorhabditis elegans (8Saifee O. Wei L. Nonet M.L. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1235-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar).To function appropriately, the SNAREs themselves must be correctly sorted and delivered to destination compartments. The intracellular trafficking of t-SNARE syntaxin is particularly intriguing as syntaxin belongs to a family of proteins that are “tail-anchored,” also called Type IV membrane proteins (9Borgese N. Colombo S. Pedrazzini E. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Such proteins have an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain that is membrane-bound by virtue of a single C-terminal hydrophobic domain. These proteins lack an N-terminal signal sequence, and their membrane-interacting region is so close to the C terminus that it emerges from the ribosome only upon termination of translation. The trafficking and targeting mechanism of these tail-anchored proteins have largely remained obscure.The trafficking of syntaxin may require the interaction with “accessory” proteins. For instance, it has been demonstrated that neural specific Stx1A sorting from the Golgi complex and delivery to the plasma membrane required Munc18-1 (10Rowe J. Corradi N. Malosio M.L. Taverna E. Halban P. Meldolesi J. Rosa P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 1865-1877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, this hypothesis has been challenged by another research demonstrating that syntaxin transportation to the membrane is independent of unc18 protein in C. elegans (11Weimer R.M. Richmond J.E. Davis W.S. Hadwiger G. Nonet M.L. Jorgensen E.M. Nat. Neurosci. 2003; 6: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). A recent research in munc18-1 knock-out mice also showed that Munc18-1 is not essential for Stx1A delivery to the presynaptic terminal (12Toonen R.F. de Vries K.J. Zalm R. Sudhof T.C. Verhage M. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 1393-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).To gain further insight into the mechanism of Stx1A trafficking and the functional construction of the protein, we have recently investigated the subcellular localization of Stx1A in INS-1 and CHO cells. The intracellular trafficking and distribution of Stx1A have not been characterized in these cells. These two cell types were selected because INS-1 cells are insulin-secreting cells that express endogenously Stx1A, Munc18-1, and SNAP-25 (13Zhang W. Efanov A. Yang S.N. Fried G. Kolare S. Brown H.

Halban P. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), whereas we verified that non-secretory CHO cells possess no endogenous Stx1A and Munc18-1 (data not shown). CHO cells hence serve as a good model to study the dependence of Stx1A trafficking on Munc18-1. Herein we have quantitatively studied the trafficking of wild type Stx1A and its truncation mutants in both INS-1 and CHO cells employing a pH-sensitive fluorescent protein label, pHluorin. We have identified the molecular determinants of the trafficking and targeting of Stx1A.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Mouse anti-Stx1A monoclonal antibodies were from Sigma. Restriction enzymes and other standard molecular biology reagents were from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). Chemicals were from Sigma or as indicated in the text. The ER marker pDsRed2-ER and the Golgi marker pEYFP-Golgi were from Clontech Laboratories.DNA Construction—Expression plasmids encoding pHluorin-fused wild type Stx1A (Stx1A-pHluorin) and truncated recombinant (t1–t8) were constructed by cloning Stx1A cDNA (15Sanders J.D. Yang Y. Liu Y. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 53: 670-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and pHluorin cDNA (16Miesenbock G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar) into pcDNA3.1Zeo(+) vector (Invitrogen). Plasmid SNAP-25-TDimer2 was constructed as described previously (17Yang X. Xu P. Xu T.

Gimenez J. Martin T.F. DasGupta B.R. Neuropharmacology. 1993; 32: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) was ligated into the subclone vector. To generate a red fluorescence protein-targeted Golgi marker, pmSrawberry-Golgi, the red fluorescence protein mStrawberry (20Shaner N.C. Campbell R.E. Steinbach P.A. Giepmans B.N. Palmer A.E.

For construction of Munc18-1-TDimer2 fusion construct, the Munc18-1 PCR fragment was ligated into subclone vector pcDNA3.1-TDimer2 (17Yang X. Xu P. Xu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 330: 914-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Construct integrity was verified using DNA sequencing analysis provided by Invitrogen Biotechnology (Beijing, China). Habc fragment was amplified with PCR and cloned into pIRES-EGFP vector (Clontech Laboratories), and then EGFP was substituted with mRFP.Cell Culture—CHO cells were grown at 37 °C in complete medium: Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium/F-12 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine (pH 7.4). INS-1 cells were cultured as described previously (21Asfari M. Janjic D. Meda P. Li G. Halban P.A. Wollheim C.B. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (748) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell cultures were maintained in RPMI 1640 culture medium containing 10 mm Hepes, 11.1 mm glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2.0 mm l-glutamine, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, and 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol.Transfection—INS-1 or CHO cells were transfected with Lipofectamine™ 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's recommendations. The day prior to the experiment, cells were transferred onto a poly-l-lysine-coated round coverslip at a density of 50,000 cells per chamber.Antibodies and Western Blotting—Cell extracts were prepared by washing the cells with phosphate-buffered saline and then extracting proteins with lysis buffer (in mm): 10 Tris, 3 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 2.5% Nonidet P-40 (pH 7.5). Protein concentration was determined with the Pierce BCA protein reagent kit (Pierce). Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by standard Western blotting techniques. Anti-Munc18-1 polyclone anitibody (1:3000) was from BD Biosciences and anti-β-actin monoclonal antibody (1:5000) was from Sigma.RNA Interference—To generate a red fluorescence protein-labeled shRNA vector, mRFP (20Shaner N.C.

Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 1567-1572Crossref PubMed Scopus (3440) Google Scholar) was used to substitute cGFP in pRNAT-H1.1/Neo (GenScript Corp., Piscataway, NJ). Small hairpin oligonucleotides (shRNA) to suppress Munc18-1 expression were designed according to the recommendations given by Miyagishi et al. (22Miyagishi M. Sumimoto H. Miyoshi H. Kawakami Y. Taira K. J. Gene Med. 2004; 6: 715-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and cloned into the BamHI-HindIII sites of the vector pRNAT-H1.1/RFP. Oligonucleotide sequences with the highest knockdown efficiency were as follows: sense, 5′-gat ccg cgt tac taa ggt act gta ttc aag aga tac ggt gcc ttg gta atg ctt ttt tgg aaa-3′; antisense, 5′-agc ttt tcc aaa aaa gca tta cca agg cac cgt atc tct tga ata cag tac ctt agt aac gcg-3′.Fluorescence Imaging—Cells were viewed under Olympus confocal laser scanning biological microscope FV500 with 60 × (NA = 1.40) oil objective after transfection. pHluorin fluorescence was excited by 488 nm argon laser, and TDimer2 (or mStrawberry) fluorescence was excited by a 543 nm HeNe laser (Melles Griot). Images were acquired and analyzed using FLUOVIEW (Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo, Japan) and Photoshop 6.0.Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) setup was constructed based on the prismless and through-the-lens configuration using the TIRF condensor made from TILL (TILL Photonics, Gräfelfing, Germany). The GFP and RFP fluorescence were both excited by a 488 nm argon laser. To image the green and the red fluorescence simultaneously, a dual-View Micro-Imager (Optical-Insights, Santa Fe, NM) was inserted before the cooled CCD (PCO Electron Multiplying CCD, PCO Computer Optics, Kelheim, Germany). Images were collected, corrected for background, processed, and analyzed using TILLvisION4.01 (TILL Photonics).Calculation of Surface Fraction and pH of the Intracellular Compartment—We designed experiments to quantify the relative amount of Stx1A-pHluorin on the cell surface compared with that in the cytosol. INS-1 and CHO cells were first incubated in the non-permeating normal solution (pH 7.4) after 48-h transfection. The external solution was then changed in turn to non-permeating pH 5.5 solution, permeating pH 7.4 NH4Cl solution, and normal wash solution. The surface fraction of Stx1A-pHluorin and the pH of the intracellular compartment (pHi) were determined as described previously (23Mitchell S.J. Ryan T.A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4884-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly, during application of a pH 5.5 solution, we define f(pHi) as surface fraction of Stx1A-pHluorin as a function of internal pHi, f(pHi)=ε1−ϕ(pHi)+α(pHi)(1−ε)(Eq. 1) where α(pHi) = (1/(1 + 10pK–7.4) – 1/(1 + 10pK-pHi))/(1/(1 + 10pK-pHi)), ϕ(pHi) = (1/(1 + 10pK–5.5))/(1/(1 + 10pK-pHi)), and ε is a mean value for the fractional increase in fluorescence during application of a non-permeating pH 5.5 solution. The pK of pHluorin was set to 7.07 as determined previously (24Sankaranarayanan S. De Angelis D. Rothman J.E. Ryan T.A. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2199-2208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar).During application of NH4Cl solution, the surface fraction of Stx1A-pHluorin, f (pHi), can be calculated as follows, f(pHi)=α(pHi)−γα(pHi)γ+α(pHi)(Eq. 2) where γ is the mean value for the fractional increase in fluorescence during application of NH4Cl solution at pH 7.4.The functions for f (pHi) derived from Equations 1 and 2 as described above were plotted to estimate the pH of the intracellular compartment. The point of intersection gave us a readout of mean intracellular pH, and the surface fraction of Stx1A-pHluorin was calculated by using the mean pH value (23Mitchell S.J. Ryan T.A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4884-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).RESULTSStx1A Is Delivered to the Plasma Membrane in Both INS-1 and CHO Cells—To examine the roles of different domains in Stx1A trafficking and localization, we have generated series deletion mutants of Stx1A as shown in Fig. 1. To investigate the intracellular distribution of these mutants and wild type Stx1A in living cells, we tagged these proteins at its C terminus with the pH-sensitive GFP variant, ecliptic pHluorin. Ecliptic pHluorin is brightly fluorescent at pH 7.4 but almost non-fluorescent at about pH < 6.0 (16Miesenbock G. De Angelis D.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1998; 394: 192-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar). pHluorin at the C terminus of Stx1A mutants will be embedded in the lumen of intracellular compartments and will be exposed extracellularly when inserted into the plasma membrane. Thus, pHluorin is a good marker to study the cell surface localization of Stx1A, which is usually not easy when GFP is used. In addition, one can quantify the surface fraction of pHluorin-labeled proteins by comparing the fluorescence changes between surface quenching using acidic extracellular solution (pH 5.5) and dequenching internal pHluorin with membrane-permeant NH4Cl solution (pH 7.4), as described previously (23Mitchell S.J. Ryan T.A. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4884-4888Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We first examined the subcellular localization of exogenous expressed Stx1A-pHluorin in CHO cells by laser scanning confocal microscopy. We verified that there is no endogenous Stx1A expressed in CHO cells (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2a, Stx1A-pHluorin fluorescence was mainly observed at the peripheral boundary of the cell, with some distribution inside the cell. The rim-like peripheral distribution represents cell surface Stx1A-pHluorin because it is largely quenched upon extracellular perfusion of solution at pH 5.5 (Fig. 2a). Application of NH4Cl solution buffered at pH 7.4 resulted in an increase in intracellular fluorescence, suggesting that some Stx1A-pHluorin is present at acidic intracellular compartments. INS-1 cells transfected with Stx1A-pHluorin displayed a similar distribution (Fig. 2a). As exemplified in Fig. 2b, extracellular application of pH 5.5 solution resulted in a significant decrease in the normalized fluorescence, whereas switching to NH4Cl solution caused an increased fluorescence. By calculating the surface fraction of Stx1A-pHluorin in pH 5.5 and NH4Cl solutions according to Equations 1 and 2, respectively, we estimated a mean internal pH (pHi) of 6.6 (Fig. 2c), suggesting that intracellular Stx1A-pHluorin resides in acidic compartments. Using this mean pHi we quantified the surface fraction of Stx1A-pHluorin in both CHO and INS-1 cells. The surface fraction of Stx1A on the plasma membrane 48 h after transfection was 45.9 ± 3.3% (n = 16) for CHO cells, similar to that in INS-1 cells (51.9 ± 7.1% n = 11, see Fig. 2d).FIGURE 2Quantitative analysis of cell surface Stx1A using pHluorin. a, confocal images of Stx1A-pHluorin in different extracellular solutions from CHO and INS-1 cells.

The surface fraction of Stx1A-pHluorin in CHO cells was rather low at 6 h after transfection and reached a plateau 24 h after transfection, whereas the surface fraction in INS-1 cells remained constant even from 6 h after transfection (Fig. 2, e and g). The different time course may result from Munc18-1 proteins, which are only expressed in INS-1 cells. To explore the role of Munc18-1 in Stx1A trafficking, we manipulated the level of Munc18-1 and examined the rate and extent of Stx1A surface translocation in both cell types. In CHO cells, which do not express Munc18-1, overexpression of Munc18-1 exerts no significant influence on the surface fraction of Stx1A (Fig. 2e). The slight enhancement after 24-h transfection may be explained by the previous finding that Munc-18 can stabilize Stx1A on the plasma membrane (12Toonen R.F. de Vries K.J. Zalm R. Sudhof T.C. Verhage M. J. Neurochem. 2005; 93: 1393-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Transfection with rat-specific shRNA against Munc18-1 in INS-1 cells reduced the protein level by >85% (Fig. 2f). However, no significant difference in Stx1A surface translocation between control and Munc18-1 knockdown cells was observed (Fig. 2g). The results suggest that trafficking of Stx1A to the plasma membrane is independent of Munc18-1.SNAP-25 Interacts with Exposed SNARE Motif of Stx1A and Transports It to the Cell Surface—The cytoplasmic portion of Stx1A consists of two helical domains: Habc and H3 (25Yang B. Steegmaier M. Gonzalez Jr., L.C. Scheller R.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The Habc domain is thought to bind the H3 domain (SNARE motif) in an antiparallel four-helix bundle. The binding of Habc domain to the SNARE motif renders Stx1A in a closed configuration that is essential for the interaction with Munc18-1. To investigate the role of Habc domain in the trafficking of Stx1A, we first generated different N-terminal truncated mutants that preserve the intact SNARE motif, which we designated t1, t2, and t3 here. These SNARE motif-exposed mutants were found localized to the plasma membrane in INS-1 cells (Fig. 3a), suggesting that their trafficking does not require Munc18-1. Surprisingly, they failed to translocate to the plasma membrane in CHO cells (Fig. 3a). The averaged surface fraction of these mutants in CHO cells were 4.0 ± 1.0% (n = 12), 4.7 ± 1.0% (n = 12), and 5.4 ± 1.3% (n = 12) for t1, t2, and t3, respectively. These values are markedly lower than those in INS-1 cells (compare with Fig. 3d). One explanation for the mislocalization of the mutants in CHO cells could be due to the lack of a certain factor to facilitate the transportation of the mutant proteins. We first verified that co-transfection of Munc18-1 in CHO cells does not rescue the trafficking (data not shown). Interestingly, co-transfection of SNAP-25 rescued the membrane localization of all three mutants in CHO cells (Fig. 3b, upper panels, and Fig. 3c). The surface fraction of the t1 mutant was recovered to 41.13 ± 3.36% (n = 22) by co-expressed SNAP-25, which is similar to the value for wild type Stx1A in CHO cells. t2 and t3 mutants were less efficiently recovered by SNAP-25, suggesting the hinge region flanking the core SNARE motif of Stx1A participates in stabilizing the interaction with SNAP-25 (Fig. 3c). We further determined that SNAP-25 can traffic to the plasma membrane in CHO cells (data not shown), consistent with previous observation that SNAP-25 trafficking is independent of syntaxin (26Loranger S.S. Linder M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 34303-34309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In INS-1 cells, co-expression of SNAP-25 with t1–t3 mutants resulted in comparable surface fractions as those from cells without SNAP-25 co-transfection (Fig. 3d), probably due to the presence of native SNAP-25 proteins. As we have shown in Fig. 3b, co-expressed SNAP-25 and SNARE motif-exposed Stx1A mutants co-localized at the plasma membrane (t1 as an example; t2 and t3 not shown).FIGURE 3Distribution and surface fraction of SNARE motif-exposed Stx1A mutants in CHO and INS-1 cells. a, confocal images of expressed t1 mutant of Stx1A from example CHO or INS-1 cell. b, confocal images of t1 mutant and co-expressed SNAP-25-Tdimer2.

When co-expressed with pDsRed2-ER or pmSrawberry-Golgi to label ER or Golgi, respectively, the mutants were found to be retained in ER and could not be transported into Golgi network in CHO cells (Fig. 4a, t3 as an example). In contrast, besides the cell surface distribution, a substantial amount of the mutant Stx1A proteins co-localized with Golgi maker in INS-1 cells, suggesting these mutants exit ER, enter Glogi network, and then are transported to the plasma membrane (Fig. 4b).FIGURE 4SNARE motif-exposed Stx1A is retained mainly in ER in CHO cells but transports to Golgi and plasma membrane in INS-1 cells.

Also shown are images of ER or Golgi markers from cells co-transfected with either pDsRed2-ER or pmSrawberry-Golgi. Merged images are shown in the right column.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The above data suggest that the SNARE motif-exposed mutants may interact with other SNARE motifs inside ER and hence be retained without trafficking to the Golgi and plasma membrane in CHO cells; whereas in INS-1 cells, endogenously expressed SNAP-25 may compete with the putative ER SNARE(s) for interaction with the exposed SNARE motif of Stx1A. SNAP-25 has been shown to form a high affinity binary complex with Stx1A (27Jahn R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1014: 170-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 28Jahn R. Lang T. Sudhof T.C. Cell. 2003; 112: 519-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1213) Google Scholar). The complexed Stx1A mutants then can be transported to the plasma membrane via SNAP-25-dependent pathway or its own sorting pathway. To test this hypothesis, INS-1 cells were co-transfected with the light chain of botulinum neurotoxin type E (BoNT/E), a toxin that specifically cleaves SNAP-25 and impairs its interaction with Stx1A (29Binz T. Blasi J. Yamasaki S. Baumeister A. Link E. Sudhof T.C. Jahn R. Niemann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1617-1620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After co-expression of BoNT/E in INS-1 cells, the membrane localization of the SNARE motif-exposed Stx1A mutants was almost completely blocked (Fig. 5). As control, the surface delivery of full-length Stx1A was not impaired by BoNT/E treatment (Fig. 5b). These results confirm that endogenous SNAP-25 participates in the delivery of the SNARE motif-exposed mutants, but not the complete Stx1A, to the plasma membrane.FIGURE 5Cleavage of endogenous SNAP-25 by BoNT/E abolishes cell surface localization of SNARE motif-exposed Stx1A mutants in INS-1 cells. a, confocal images of co-expressed SNARE motif-exposed Stx1A mutants (t1 as an example) and cytosolic mRFP (as an indicator of BoNT/E expressed by pmRFP-IRES-BoNT/E vector) in INS-1 cells.

We thus generated a longer N-terminal truncation extending to the middle of the SNARE core motif (t4) or a mutant where only the SNARE core motif is deleted (t5). The subcellular distribution of these mutants were studied when expressed alone or co-expressed with SNAP-25 in CHO and INS-1 cells. Confocal analysis showed that both mutants transported to the cell surface in both cell types (Fig. 6a). As shown in Fig. 6b, the surface fractions of t4 and t5 reach 46.8 ± 3.6% (n = 14) and 46.3 ± 3.7% (n = 12) in CHO cells, which is not significantly different from the value for wild type Stx1A (see Fig. 2). The surface fractions of t4 and t5 in INS-1 cells are somewhat lower than that of wild type Stx1A (Fig. 6c). Furthermore, the surface fractions of the two mutants were not significantly influenced by co"
https://openalex.org/W1975018283,"This article reports the identification and characterization of a DBL-like guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) in Drosophila, called GEFmeso, as a novel binding target of the Ras-like GTPase Ral. Previous studies suggested that some aspects of Ral activity, which is involved in multiple cellular processes, are mediated through regulation of Rho GTPases. Here we show in vitro association of GEFmeso with the GTP-bound active form of Ral and the nucleotide-free form of the Rho GTPase Cdc42. GEFmeso fails to bind to other Rho GTPases, showing that Cdc42 is a specific interaction partner of this GEF. Unlike Ral and Cdc42, which are ubiquitously expressed, GEFmeso exerts distinct spatio-temporal expression patterns during embryonic development, suggesting a tissue-restricted function of the GEF in vivo. Based on previous observations that mutations in Cdc42 or overexpression of mutant alleles of Cdc42 lead to distinct effects on wing development, the effects of overexpression of dominant-negative and activated versions of Ral on wing development were analyzed. In addition, GEFmeso overexpression studies as well as RNAi experiments were performed. The results suggest that Ral, GEFmeso and Cdc42 act in the same developmental pathway and that GEFmeso mediates activation of Cdc42 in response to activated Ral in the context of Drosophila wing development."
