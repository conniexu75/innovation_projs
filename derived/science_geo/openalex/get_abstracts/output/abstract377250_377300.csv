But from 1941 until a few months ago, no further research was undertaken."

https://openalex.org/W2077506157,"NUMEROUS attempts have been made by several geneticists to induce mutations in Drosophila by treating either eggs, larvæ, pupæ or adults with various chemicals. The first unquestionably positive results were obtained by C. Auerbach and J. M. Robson, who induced genetic changes in the sperm of males by exposure to the vapours of various mustards. There is very little doubt that the method of treatment developed by Auerbach and Robson contributed significantly to their success. This method can be used with chemical substances that can be handled as vapours."
https://openalex.org/W4237179805,"THE light of the night sky has excited increased attention since the end of the War ; from the practically minded student of rockets and from astronomers, as well as from students of the upper atmosphere. The astronomer is particularly interested because of the effect of this radiation on his observations. To the student of the upper atmosphere, this radiation has held out a promise of information concerning the composition of the upper air, as well as concerning fundamental processes there. Because of the difficult problem presented by spectroscopy of the light of the night sky, there are still many unidentified radiations in its spectrum, as well as inadequately studied regions. In every review of the contributions of spectroscopy to the study of the upper atmosphere, attention is directed to the desirability of further laboratory investigations of the spectra of O2 and N2, nd the desirability of obtaining emission spectra of ozone and the oxides of nitrogen. It has been suggested that a search along these lines may yield a satisfactory identification of the strong ultra-violet band at ?3556 A."

https://openalex.org/W2092948560,"IN these Laboratories the fungistatic properties of ethylenic and acetylenic compounds have been studied recently1. Our results indicated that biological activity was connected with the presence of substituents that attract electrons strongly, and led us to a consideration of the dissociation constants of compounds which donate protons (that is, acids as defined in the broadest sense), since these constants form a basis for a comparison of the affinity for electrons of radicals and groups. During the course of this work, relationships were found between certain dissociation constants, which constants are conveniently expressed as Î""F (= â RT.logeK)2 for the reaction RH + Râ + H+ taking place in dilute aqueous solution at 25° C. Although the relationships summarized below are of general application, space here does not permit them to be illustrated by long lists of examples, and so, as far as possible, only the values of Î""F (calories) for the seven acids, H3PO4 (I) + 2,900; H2PO4â (II) + 9,800; HPO4ââ (III) + 16,900; H2SO3 (IV) + 2,4003; HSO3â (V) + 9,8003; HSO4â (VI) + 2,300 and HOCl (VII) + 10,1004,5, have been used in this discussion differ by 7 kgm. cal.

Ground up and the chitinous cuticle filtered off, they are extracted with acetone. This extract is washed three times with N/10 sodium hydroxide. The three liquors thus obtained are freed of acetone, neutralized to pH 7·5, and each is concentrated so that 1 c.c. corresponds to 1 gm. of larval bodies."

https://openalex.org/W1986027123,"“THE DATA OF GEOCHEMISTRY”, by the late F. W. Clarke, is a mine of information on river waters, their variation with geological formation and Joly's 'cyclic sodium' transported in the air and brought down by rain. These phenomena are simply studied by measurements of electrical conductivity at 0° C. Thus C × 106 for Plymouth tap-water varied during 1923–24 from 25 to 28 ; the values found on July 7, 1923, and September 26, 1923, were 27 and 28—identical respectively with those of July 5, 1945, and September 19, 1945. The pH varied from 6·4 to 6·8 during the year. It was with some surprise that I found rain-water, collected at Downderry on the Cornish coast during a downpour on March 12, 1946, to have a conductivity 24, with pH. 6·6. Rain at Plymouth on March 13, 1946, had conductivity 55 and pH 4·0. During the night of September 19–20, 1946, rain at Antony, Cornwall, had conductivity 28, the typical September figure for Dartmoor water. Clean snow at Downderry on January 24, 1947, gave 44, and a Plymouth sample of January 25, 1947, gave 72 for conductivity. The latter was taken from the middle of the snow blanket and was, on thawing, surprisingly sooty. Plymouth rain of January 8, 1947, had conductivity 70, close to that of snow."

https://openalex.org/W2038602192,"AMONG the many points touched upon in recent literature of tuberculosis are : (1) the favourable results in the treatment of lupus, and possibly other forms of surgical tuberculosis, with calciferol1–3 ; (2) the conflicting results reported by various workers4–6 as to the effect of penicillin. In the course of an extensive experimental study of the chemotherapy of tuberculosis, we have made observations bearing upon these questions which it is thought are of sufficient interest to report briefly."

https://openalex.org/W2987690456,"THE suggestion put forward by Walton1 that the presence of small teeth and chitinous elevations in the pharynx of Micronecta indicates that this Hemipteran ingests and masticates particulate food material appears to be true for other families of the Cryptocerata. There exists in many, and probably all, species of Corixidæ a type of feeding mechanism which does not seem to have been recorded. This takes the form of a modification of the cibarial suction pump2 in such a manner as to produce a pair of chitinous jaws having a structure and position strongly suggesting that they function as organs for the comminution of solid material. It is a mechanism more elaborate in form than that found in Micronecta. The whole ventral wall of the cibarial pump consists of a curved chitinous plate having a thickened posterior margin. The anterior border of this plate appears to be folded back and modified into a transverse triangular bar set with rows of minute tooth-like projections. Above this bar and articulating with it at its lateral ends lies a second chitinous bar formed by the thickened dorsal wall of the cibarium and similarly equipped with teeth or rugosities (Fig.1). The two bars have the appearance of a pair of grinding jaws, and although the musculature of the organ has not been studied in detail, enough has been noted to support this supposition."

https://openalex.org/W2000741587,"PREVIOUS work1,2 and also many unpublished results have shown that in the woodlouse Armadillidium vulgare Latr. red body colour and a colour pattern called type D behave as simple autosomal dominants to the common black and grey types (the only complication being that in adult animals type D is sex-limited to the female sex). Collinge3,4,5, however, has reported results which do not agree with mine in that he fails to find any segregations. I was inclined to believe that Collinge's results were due to his scoring animals before they were really old enough for the different colour types to be distinguished ; for he had stated6 that, when he examined some young from the variety rufobrunneus (red) at just over three weeks old, no trace of red or brown coloration was apparent, and that, if he had not known their history, he would have identified them as young specimens of the variety plumbeus (grey black). While it must be emphasized that in the majority of cases red colour does behave as a simple dominant, and that one does usually obtain good 1 : 1 and 3 : 1 segregations, I have recently obtained some results which confirm Collinge's observations."
https://openalex.org/W2015906164,"WORK undertaken in this Laboratory suggests that certain species of diatoms, which are the normal constituents of the slime film which forms upon a submerged surface in marine waters, contain copper, far in excess of the amount usually considered lethal for unicellular Algae. (Half to one part per million is usually sufficient to remove algal growths from reservoirs.) Large colonies of marine diatoms were gathered freshly during the spring maximum of 1946, from a raft located in Chichester Harbour. Sixteen samples were examined : Nos. 1–12 inclusive were species which live in frondose colonies of mucous filaments, 5–10 cm. in length ; samples Nos. 13–16 inclusive were species which grow either upon mucous stalks or embedded within a flat film."
https://openalex.org/W2003710138,"THE recent note “Aspergillin: a Name Misapplied to Several Different Antibiotics”, in which Tobie1 deprecates the practice of assigning names to antibiotics without due consultation of the literature, prompts me to point out, for its historical interest, that even penicillin has not escaped such a duplication in naming. I refer to the use of the name 'penicillin' by Palei and Osuicheva2 in 1936 to designate a thermostable substance isolated from Penicillium luteum purpurogenum, which was unfavourable to the production of citric acid by Aspergillus niger. This was seven years after the first use of the term by Fleming3 in his now famous paper. The oversight is probably due in part to the vagaries of indexing. The name âpenicillinâ did not appear in Chemisches Zentralblatt until 1934, or in the British abstracts until 1933; it can, however, be found in the 1929 Chemical Abstracts and the Biological Abstracts for 1930. This serves as another warning against too much reliance on a single abstracting source."
https://openalex.org/W2040177529,"THE place of thermodynamics in education was recently discussed by the Low-Temperature Group of the Physical Society. In outlining the purpose of the discussion, the chairman, Sir Alfred Egerton, explained that a feeling exists amongmembers of the Group that the thermodynamics teaching givento students in Great Britain is often inadequate; and it was in the hope of formulating constructive proposals for its improvement that this meeting was called. He added that it was not his intention to confine discussion only to low-temperature aspects of thermodynamics, but to encourage discussion over the whole thermodynamic field."
https://openalex.org/W2055128000,"FRAGMENTS of young stem tissue of Helianthus annuus (L.), when cultured on a nutrient medium containing 2 per cent sucrose and mineral salts, are capable of making only a limited amount of growth, chiefly confined to the production of a pad of callus tissue on the cut surface. Such cultures have been shown to respond in various ways to certain plant hormones. Root production results from the addition to the medium of one part per thousand million of such substances as indole acetic, indole butyric or naphthalene acetic acid to the agar on which such stem fragments are cultured. The type of root growth varies with the hormone used1. Higher concentrations of these substances cause a characteristic proliferation of the stem tissue. These reactions have already been used to demonstrate the presence of indole acetic acid in commercial penicillin. The crystalline penicillins G and X were shown to have root-initiating properties by this means, but to differ from indole acetic acid in that they failed to induce the same characteristic cellular proliferation at high concentration2. The reactions have also led to the detection of growth-substances in bacteria-free crown gall tissue."
