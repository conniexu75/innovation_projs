https://openalex.org/W4305015938,"Abstract In patients with previously treated metastatic uveal melanoma, the historical 1 year overall survival rate is 37% with a median overall survival of 7.8 months. We conducted a multicenter, single-arm, open-label phase 2 study of tebentafusp, a soluble T cell receptor bispecific (gp100×CD3), in 127 patients with treatment-refractory metastatic uveal melanoma (NCT02570308). The primary endpoint was the estimation of objective response rate based on RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours) v1.1. Secondary objectives included safety, overall survival, progression-free survival and disease control rate. All patients had at least one treatment-related adverse event, with rash (87%), pyrexia (80%) and pruritus (67%) being the most common. Toxicity was mostly mild to moderate in severity but was greatly reduced in incidence and intensity after the initial three doses. Despite a low overall response rate of 5% (95% CI: 2–10%), the 1 year overall survival rate was 62% (95% CI: 53–70%) with a median overall survival of 16.8 months (95% CI: 12.9–21.3), suggesting benefit beyond traditional radiographic-based response criteria. In an exploratory analysis, early on-treatment reduction in circulating tumour DNA was strongly associated with overall survival, even in patients with radiographic progression. Our findings indicate that tebentafusp has promising clinical activity with an acceptable safety profile in patients with previously treated metastatic uveal melanoma, and data suggesting ctDNA as an early indicator of clinical benefit from tebentafusp need confirmation in a randomized trial."

Using data from 1,076 participants enrolled in ChAdOx1 nCov-19 vaccine efficacy trials in the United Kingdom, we found that inter-individual variation in normalized antibody responses against SARS-CoV-2 spike and its receptor-binding domain (RBD) at 28 days after first vaccination shows genome-wide significant association with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II alleles. The most statistically significant association with higher levels of anti-RBD antibody was HLA-DQB1*06 (P = 3.2 × 10-9), which we replicated in 1,677 additional vaccinees. Individuals carrying HLA-DQB1*06 alleles were less likely to experience PCR-confirmed breakthrough infection during the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus and subsequent Alpha variant waves compared to non-carriers (hazard ratio = 0.63, 0.42-0.93, P = 0.02). We identified a distinct spike-derived peptide that is predicted to bind differentially to HLA-DQB1*06 compared to other similar alleles, and we found evidence of increased spike-specific memory B cell responses in HLA-DQB1*06 carriers at 84 days after first vaccination. Our results demonstrate association of HLA type with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine antibody response and risk of breakthrough infection, with implications for future vaccine design and implementation."

https://openalex.org/W4305014647,"The B cell antigen receptor (BCR) is composed of a membrane-bound class M, D, G, E or A immunoglobulin for antigen recognition1–3 and a disulfide-linked Igα (also known as CD79A) and Igβ (also known as CD79B) heterodimer (Igα/β) that functions as the signalling entity through intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs)4,5. The organizing principle of the BCR remains unknown. Here we report cryo-electron microscopy structures of mouse full-length IgM BCR and its Fab-deleted form. At the ectodomain (ECD), the Igα/β heterodimer mainly uses Igα to associate with Cµ3 and Cµ4 domains of one heavy chain (µHC) while leaving the other heavy chain (µHC′) unbound. The transmembrane domain (TMD) helices of µHC and µHC′ interact with those of the Igα/β heterodimer to form a tight four-helix bundle. The asymmetry at the TMD prevents the recruitment of two Igα/β heterodimers. Notably, the connecting peptide between the ECD and TMD of µHC intervenes in between those of Igα and Igβ to guide TMD assembly through charge complementarity. Weaker but distinct density for the Igβ ITAM nestles next to the TMD, suggesting potential autoinhibition of ITAM phosphorylation. Interfacial analyses suggest that all BCR classes utilize a general organizational architecture. Our studies provide a structural platform for understanding B cell signalling and designing rational therapies against BCR-mediated diseases. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of the mouse class M immunoglobulin B cell receptor complex provide insight into B cell receptor subunit assembly, domain architecture and signalling mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W4305014085,"Bacterial toxin DddA-derived cytosine base editors (DdCBEs)-composed of split DddAtox (a cytosine deaminase specific to double-stranded DNA), custom-designed TALE (transcription activator-like effector) DNA-binding proteins, and a uracil glycosylase inhibitor-enable mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) editing in human cells, which may pave the way for therapeutic correction of pathogenic mtDNA mutations in patients. The utility of DdCBEs has been limited by off-target activity, which is probably caused by spontaneous assembly of the split DddAtox deaminase enzyme, independent of DNA-binding interactions. We engineered high-fidelity DddA-derived cytosine base editors (HiFi-DdCBEs) with minimal off-target activity by substituting alanine for amino acid residues at the interface between the split DddAtox halves. The resulting domains cannot form a functional deaminase without binding of their linked TALE proteins at adjacent sites on DNA. Whole mitochondrial genome sequencing shows that, unlike conventional DdCBEs, which induce hundreds of unwanted off-target C-to-T conversions in human mtDNA, HiFi-DdCBEs are highly efficient and precise, avoiding collateral off-target mutations, and as such, they will probably be desirable for therapeutic applications."

https://openalex.org/W4306181016,"Endophytic fungi from the Chilli were used to help okra plants exposed to cadmium (Cd) or chromium (Cr) stress. Initially, the strain Ch06 produced higher amounts of indole acetic acid (IAA) (230.5 μg/mL), sugar (130.7 μg/mL), proteins (128.2 μg/mL), phenolics (525.6 μg/mL) and flavonoids (98.4 μg/mL) in Czapek broth supplemented with Cd or Cr. The production of IAA and other metabolites in such a higher concentration suggested that Ch06 might improve plant growth under heavy metal stress. For this reason, an experiment was designed, in which biomass of Ch06 (at 2g/100g of sand) were applied to the okra plants exposed to Cd or Cr stress (at 100 or 500 μg/g). The results exhibited that Ch06 improved the total chlorophyll (36.4±0.2 SPAD), shoot length (22.6±0.2 cm), root length (9.1±0.6 cm), fresh weight (5±0.6 g), dry weight (1.25±0.01 g), sugars (151.6 μg/g), proteins (114.8 μg/g), proline (6.7 μg/g), flavonoids (37.9 μg/g), phenolics (70.7 μg/g), IAA (106.7 μg/g), catalase (0.75 enzyme units/g tissue) and ascorbic acid oxidaze (2.2 enzyme units/g tissue) of the associated okra plants. Similar observations have been recorded in Ch06 associated okra plants under Cd and Cr stress. Also, Ch06 association reduced translocation of Cd (35% and 45%) and Cr (47% and 53%) to the upper parts of the okra plants and thus reduced their toxicity. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region amplification of 18S rDNA (ribosomal deoxyribo nucleic acid) exhibited that the potent strain Ch06 was Aspergillus violaceofuscus. The results implied that A. violaceofuscus has the ability to promote host species growth exposed to Cd and Cr. Moreover, it helped the host plants to recover in Cd and Cr polluted soils, hence can be used as biofertilizer."
https://openalex.org/W4306181067,"Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is one of the most prevalent causes of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Hyperglycemia induces increased expression/deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins including fibronectin (FN) and collagen (Col) and plays an important role in fibrosis in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). The roles of RNAs including microRNA (miRNA) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) have begun to be understood in many conditions. In this study, we investigated the role of a specific miRNA, miR-9, and its interactions with lncRNA ZFAS1 in mediating fibrosis in DCM. Treatment with 25 mM glucose (HG) decreased miR-9 expression and increased expressions of ZFAS1, ECM proteins and inflammatory markers, compared to 5 mM glucose (NG) in the HCMECs by using qRT-PCR. Glucose-induced upregulation of ECM proteins can be prevented by ZFAS1 siRNA or miR-9 mimic transfection. Luciferase assay was confirmed miR-9 binding to FN 3’-UTR. miR-9 expression can be regulated by ZFAS1 through polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) components using RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. In the in vivo experiment, hyperglycemia-induced the ECM production can be prevented by the miR-9 overexpression in the fibrosis in DCM. These studies showed a novel glucose-induced molecular mechanism in which ZFAS1 participates in the transcriptional regulation of ECM protein production in diabetes through miR-9."
https://openalex.org/W4305015503,"Membrane lipids control the cellular activity of kinases containing the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain through direct lipid-SH2 domain interactions. Here we report development of new nonlipidic small molecule inhibitors of the lipid-SH2 domain interaction that block the cellular activity of their host proteins. As a pilot study, we evaluated the efficacy of lipid-SH2 domain interaction inhibitors for spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk), which is implicated in hematopoietic malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia (AML). An optimized inhibitor (WC36) specifically and potently suppressed oncogenic activities of Syk in AML cell lines and patient-derived AML cells. Unlike ATP-competitive Syk inhibitors, WC36 was refractory to de novo and acquired drug resistance due to its ability to block not only the Syk kinase activity, but also its noncatalytic scaffolding function that is linked to drug resistance. Collectively, our study shows that targeting lipid-protein interaction is a powerful approach to developing new small molecule drugs."
https://openalex.org/W4306180774,"The high proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections that have remained undetected presents a challenge to tracking the progress of the pandemic and estimating the extent of population immunity.We used residual blood samples from women attending antenatal care services at three hospitals in Kenya between August 2020 and October 2021and a validated IgG ELISA for SARS-Cov-2 spike protein and adjusted the results for assay sensitivity and specificity. We fitted a two-component mixture model as an alternative to the threshold analysis to estimate of the proportion of individuals with past SARS-CoV-2 infection.We estimated seroprevalence in 2,981 women; 706 in Nairobi, 567 in Busia and 1,708 in Kilifi. By October 2021, 13% of participants were vaccinated (at least one dose) in Nairobi, 2% in Busia. Adjusted seroprevalence rose in all sites; from 50% (95%CI 42-58) in August 2020, to 85% (95%CI 78-92) in October 2021 in Nairobi; from 31% (95%CI 25-37) in May 2021 to 71% (95%CI 64-77) in October 2021 in Busia; and from 1% (95% CI 0-3) in September 2020 to 63% (95% CI 56-69) in October 2021 in Kilifi. Mixture modelling, suggests adjusted cross-sectional prevalence estimates are underestimates; seroprevalence in October 2021 could be 74% in Busia and 72% in Kilifi.There has been substantial, unobserved transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Nairobi, Busia and Kilifi Counties. Due to the length of time since the beginning of the pandemic, repeated cross-sectional surveys are now difficult to interpret without the use of models to account for antibody waning."
https://openalex.org/W4306180601,"Background Active ageing is described as the process of optimizing health, empowerment, and security to enhance the quality of life in the rapidly growing population of older adults. Meanwhile, multimorbidity and neurological disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease (PD), lead to global public health and resource limitations. We introduce a novel user-centered paradigm of ageing based on wearable-driven artificial intelligence (AI) that may harness the autonomy and independence that accompany functional limitation or disability, and possibly elevate life expectancy in older adults and people with PD. Methods ActiveAgeing is a 4-year, multicentre, mixed method, cyclic study that combines digital phenotyping via commercial devices (Empatica E4, Fitbit Sense, and Oura Ring) with traditional evaluation (clinical assessment scales, in-depth interviews, and clinical consultations) and includes four types of participants: (1) people with PD and (2) their informal caregiver; (3) healthy older adults from the Helgetun living environment in Norway, and (4) people on the Helgetun waiting list. For the first study, each group will be represented by N = 15 participants to test the data acquisition and to determine the sample size for the second study. To suggest lifestyle changes, modules for human expert-based advice, machine-generated advice, and self-generated advice from accessible data visualization will be designed. Quantitative analysis of physiological data will rely on digital signal processing (DSP) and AI techniques. The clinical assessment scales are the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Geriatric Anxiety Inventory (GAI), Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), and the REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder Screening Questionnaire (RBDSQ). A qualitative inquiry will be carried out with individual and focus group interviews and analysed using a hermeneutic approach including narrative and thematic analysis techniques. Discussion We hypothesise that digital phenotyping is feasible to explore the ageing process from clinical and lifestyle perspectives including older adults and people with PD. Data is used for clinical decision-making by symptom tracking, predicting symptom evolution, and discovering new outcome measures for clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W4306194555,"Consistent clinical observations of characteristic findings of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest X-rays have attracted the research community to strive to provide a fast and reliable method for screening suspected patients. Several machine learning algorithms have been proposed to find the abnormalities in the lungs using chest X-rays specific to COVID-19 pneumonia and distinguish them from other etiologies of pneumonia. However, despite the enormous magnitude of the pandemic, there are very few instances of public databases of COVID-19 pneumonia, and to the best of our knowledge, there is no database with annotation of abnormalities on the chest X-rays of COVID-19 affected patients. Annotated databases of X-rays can be of significant value in the design and development of algorithms for disease prediction. Further, explainability analysis for the performance of existing or new deep learning algorithms will be enhanced significantly with access to ground-truth abnormality annotations. The proposed COVID Abnormality Annotation for X-Rays (CAAXR) database is built upon the BIMCV-COVID19+ database which is a large-scale dataset containing COVID-19+ chest X-rays. The primary contribution of this study is the annotation of the abnormalities in over 1700 frontal chest X-rays. Further, we define protocols for semantic segmentation as well as classification for robust evaluation of algorithms. We provide benchmark results on the defined protocols using popular deep learning models such as DenseNet, ResNet, MobileNet, and VGG for classification, and UNet, SegNet, and Mask-RCNN for semantic segmentation. The classwise accuracy, sensitivity, and AUC-ROC scores are reported for the classification models, and the IoU and DICE scores are reported for the segmentation models."
https://openalex.org/W4304080545,"Expression of Protein tyrosine kinase 6 (PTK6) is upregulated in several human solid tumors, and it has oncogenic roles in prostate and breast cancer. PTK6 and SRC kinase are distantly related, share many substrates, and often regulate the same signaling pathways, but whether they interact to regulate signaling is not well understood. We characterized crosstalk between PTK6 and SRC and show that PTK6 can directly phosphorylate SRC to promote its activation. Stable knockdown of PTK6 in multiple cancer cell lines leads to decreased activating phosphorylation of SRC. We show that coexpression of kinase-dead SRC and active PTK6 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking Src, Yes, and Fyn results in activating phosphorylation of SRC. However, there is no reciprocal effect, because active SRC does not promote activating phosphorylation of PTK6. Overexpression of active PTK6 maintained activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), AKT, and FAK, but not SHP2 and ERK1/2 in cells with knockdown of SRC. Both PTK6 and SRC are regulated by EGFR, and its inhibition with erlotinib downregulated PTK6 and to a lesser degree SRC activation in LNCaP cells that overexpress active PTK6. Erlotinib treatment also led to AKT inhibition, but overexpression of active PTK6 prevented this. Our data demonstrate overlapping and unique functions for PTK6 and SRC. Finally, we show that PTK6 and SRC are coexpressed in subsets of human prostate and breast cancer cells, and active PTK6 and active SRC colocalize in prostate cancer, supporting a role for PTK6 in promoting SRC activity in cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4305014664,"Cancer genetics has uncovered many tumor-suppressor and oncogenic pathways, but few alterations have revealed mechanisms involved in tumor spreading. Here, we examined the role of the third most significant chromosomal deletion in human melanoma that inactivates the adherens junction gene NECTIN1 in 55% of cases. We found that NECTIN1 loss stimulates melanoma cell migration in vitro and spreading in vivo in both zebrafish and human tumors specifically in response to decreased IGF1 signaling. In human melanoma biopsy specimens, adherens junctions were seen exclusively in areas with low IGF1 levels, but not in NECTIN1-deficient tumors. Our study establishes NECTIN1 as a major determinant of melanoma dissemination and uncovers a genetic control of the response to microenvironmental signals."

https://openalex.org/W4306180872,"Opposed to most crayfish species that inhabit permanent bodies of water, a unique burrowing lifestyle has evolved several times throughout the crayfish phylogeny. Burrowing crayfish are considered to be semi-terrestrial, as they burrow to the groundwater—creating complex burrows that occasionally reach 3 m in depth. Because burrowing crayfishes spend most of their lives within their burrow, we lack a basic understanding of the behavior and natural history of these species. However, recent work suggests that burrowing crayfishes may exhibit a higher level of surface activity than previously thought. In the current study, we conducted a behavioral study of the Little Brown Mudbug, Lacunicambarus thomai using video surveillance to determine their degree of surface activity and behavioral patterns. Throughout 664 hrs of footage, we observed a surprisingly high amount of activity at the surface of their burrows—both during the day and night. The percentage of time that individual crayfish was observed at the surface ranged from 21% to 69% per individual, with an average of 42.48% of the time spent at the surface across all crayfish. Additionally, we created an ethogram based on six observed behaviors and found that each behavior had a strong circadian effect. For example, we only observed a single observation of foraging on vegetation during the day, whereas 270 observations of this behavior were documented at night. Overall, our results suggest that burrowing crayfishes may exhibit higher levels of surface activity than previously thought. To increase our understanding of burrowing crayfish behaviors ecology, we encourage the continued use of video-recorded observations in the field and the laboratory."
https://openalex.org/W4306180880,"Adversarial machine learning is a recent area of study that explores both adversarial attack strategy and detection systems of adversarial attacks, which are inputs specially crafted to outwit the classification of detection systems or disrupt the training process of detection systems. In this research, we performed two adversarial attack scenarios, we used a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate synthetic intrusion traffic to test the influence of these attacks on the accuracy of machine learning-based Intrusion Detection Systems(IDSs). We conducted two experiments on adversarial attacks including poisoning and evasion attacks on two different types of machine learning models: Decision Tree and Logistic Regression. The performance of implemented adversarial attack scenarios was evaluated using the CICIDS2017 dataset. Also, it was based on a comparison of the accuracy of machine learning-based IDS before and after attacks. The results show that the proposed evasion attacks reduced the testing accuracy of both network intrusion detection systems models (NIDS). That illustrates our evasion attack scenario negatively affected the accuracy of machine learning-based network intrusion detection systems, whereas the decision tree model was more affected than logistic regression. Furthermore, our poisoning attack scenario disrupted the training process of machine learning-based NIDS, whereas the logistic regression model was more affected than the decision tree."
https://openalex.org/W4306181065,"Older adults have been especially vulnerable to adverse effects from the COVID-19 pandemic including higher mortality and more severe disease complications. At the same time, social isolation, malnutrition and physical inactivity are serious concerns among older adults. The pandemic and associated restrictions may serve to exacerbate these issues, presenting increased risks to physical and mental health. The aims of this qualitative study were: i) to explore how community-living older people in the UK experienced the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically how it impacted their well-being and associated health behaviours; ii) to explore how older people's experiences and behaviours changed over time throughout the first wave.Qualitative data were collected by conducting serial telephone interviews, with an interval of approximately three months. Participants were from the Hertfordshire Cohort Study, all aged over 80 years. Discussions were audio-recorded, information related to the COVID-19 pandemic was transcribed verbatim and transcripts analysed thematically. Interviews were conducted from March to October 2020.Data for twelve participants (7 men and 5 women) from a total of 35 interviews were used, comprising two or three timepoints per participant. Analysis identified five overarching themes: 1) shopping strategies and food accessibility, 2) limitations on activities and going out, 3) disruption to healthcare, 4) social and psychological repercussions, and 5) coping strategies. Findings highlight challenges associated with accessing shops, healthcare, and usual activities due to pandemic-related restrictions. Longitudinal findings showed that for some, the ongoing pandemic and related restrictions appeared to aggravate mental health issues (low mood, anxiety) over time, as well as greater feelings of isolation or loneliness, reduced activity and functional limitations; this was despite some relaxation of restrictions later on. Coping strategies used by participants included finding ways to keep busy and to do physical activity safely, maintaining social contact remotely, and having an optimistic or positive outlook, a 'do what you can' attitude.Interventions are likely to be needed in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic to support health behaviours, such as increasing physical activity, social engagement and improving mental health among community-living older adults."
https://openalex.org/W4306181193,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 continues to impose itself on all populations of the world. Given the slow pace of vaccination in the developing world and the absence of effective treatments, adherence to precautionary infection control measures remains the best way to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic from spiraling out of control. In this study, we aim to evaluate the extent to which the Syrian population adheres to these measures and analyze the relationship between demographic variables and adherence.This cross-sectional study took place in Syria between January 17 and March 17, 2021. A structured self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data. The questionnaire was distributed in both electronic and printed versions. Our sample consisted of 7531 individuals. Collected data were analyzed using SPSS v.25. The chi-square test was used to address the correlation between adherence and demographic variables.Of the 10083 reached out, only 8083 responded, and 7531 included in the final analysis with an effective response rate of 74.7%. Of them, 4026 (53.5%) were women, 3984 (52.9%) were single, and 1908 (25.3%) had earned university degrees. 5286 (70.25) were in the high level of adherence category to protective measures. Statistically significant differences were documented when investigating the correlation between commitment to preventive measures and age, sex, marital status, financial status, employment, and educational attainment. Furthermore, those who believed that COVID-19 poses a major risk to them, or society were more committed to preventive measures than those who did not.The participants in this study generally showed a high level of adherence to the preventive measures compared to participants in other studies from around the world, with some concerns regarding the sources of information they depend on. Nationwide awareness campaigns should be conducted and focus on maintaining, if not expanding, this level of commitment, which would mitigate the pandemic's impact on Syrian society."
https://openalex.org/W4306248077,"Large input and high loss of chemical fertilizer are the major causes of agricultural non-point source pollution in China. Employing fertilizer loss and micro-health data, this paper analyzes the effects of chemical fertilizer loss on the health of rural elderly and the medical cost in China. Results of the difference-in-differences (DID) method indicate that one kg/ha increase in fertilizer loss alters a key medical disability index (Activities of Daily Living) by 0.0147 (0.2 percent changes) and the number of diseases by 0.0057 for rural residents of 65 and older. This is equivalent to CNY 316 million (USD 45 million) at national medical cost. Furthermore, the age of onset is younger in regions with higher fertilizer loss. One kg/ha increase of fertilizer loss advances the age of onset by 0.267 year, which will cause long-term effect on public health. Our results are robust to a variety of robustness checks."
https://openalex.org/W4306180750,"Previous studies have explored the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and multimorbidity. However, the relationship between other obesity indicators and their dynamic changes and multimorbidity has not been systematically estimated. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the association of BMI and other obesity indicators, including waist circumference (WC), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), waist divided by height0.5 (WHT.5R), and body roundness index (BRI) and their changes and the risk of multimorbidity in middle-aged and older adults through a retrospective cohort study.Data collected from annual health examination dataset in the Jinshui during 2017 and 2021. Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate the effect of baseline and dynamic changes in the anthropometric indices on the risk of multimorbidity.A total of 75,028 individuals were included in the study, and 5,886 participants developed multimorbidity during the follow-up. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed a progressive increase in the risk of multimorbidity with increasing anthropometric indicators (BMI, WC, WHtR, WHT.5R, and BRI) (all P<0.001). Regardless of general obesity status at baseline, increased WC was associated with a high risk of multimorbidity. Compared to the subjects with baseline BMI<24 kg/m2 and WC<90 (men)/80 (women), the HRs (95% CI) of the baseline BMI<24 kg/m2 and WC≥90 (men)/80 (women) group and BMI≥24 kg/m2 and WC≥90 (men)/80 (women) group were 1.31 (1.08, 1.61) and 1.82 (1.68, 1.97), respectively. In addition, the dynamics of WC could reflect the risk of multimorbidity. When subjects with baseline WC<90 (men)/80 (women) progressed to WC≥90 (men)/80 (women) during follow-up, the risk of multimorbidity significantly increased (HR = 1.78; 95% CI, 1.64, 1.95), while the risk of multimorbidity tended to decrease when people with abnormal WC at baseline reversed to normal at follow-up (HR = 1.40; 95% CI, 1.26, 1.54) compared to those who still exhibited abnormal WC at follow-up (HR = 2.00; 95% CI, 1.82, 2.18).Central obesity is an independent and alterable risk factor for the occurrence of multimorbidity in middle-aged and elderly populations. In addition to the clinical measurement of BMI, the measurement of the central obesity index WC may provide additional benefits for the identification of multimorbidity in the Chinese middle-aged and elderly populations."
https://openalex.org/W4306181049,"A novel stent retriever device for in vivo mechanical thrombectomy for acute cerebral infarction has been developed. In this study, we compared the thrombus removal capacity, potential complications, and extent of vessel wall damage of this novel device with those of the Solitaire FR device by performing a histopathologic analysis using an autopsied canine model. Through this experimental evaluation, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of the newly developed thrombus removal device for cerebral infarction. Blood clots (autologous thrombus) were injected into 12 canines. Mechanical thrombectomy was performed in six canines using the newly developed Tromba thrombectomy device (experimental group) and in the other six canines using the Solitaire FR thrombectomy device (control group). Angiographic and histopathologic evaluations were performed 1 month after the blood vessels underwent mechanical thrombectomy. In the experimental group, the reperfusion patency was classified as “no narrowing” in five cases and “moderate narrowing (25%–50% stenosis)” in one case. In the control group, the reperfusion patency was classified as “no narrowing” in four cases, “moderate narrowing (25%–50% stenosis)” in one case, and “slight narrowing (less than 25% stenosis)” in one case. In the experimental group, intimal proliferation was observed in only two cases, endothelial loss was observed in two cases, and device-induced medial injury was observed in one case. In the control group, intimal proliferation was observed in two cases, endothelial loss was observed in one case, and thrombosis (fibrin/platelet) was observed in one case. The Tromba thrombectomy device showed no significant difference to the conventional Solitaire device in angiographic and histopathologic evaluations after thrombus removal. The stability and efficiency of the newly developed Tromba device are considered to be high and comparable to those of Solitaire."
https://openalex.org/W4306194629,"Infrared and THz optics has many promising practical applications such as in spectroscopy, diagnostic, optical metrology, sensing, and many others. Due to limited number of IR radiation sources, the frequency down-conversion processes are widely used for obtaining infrared radiation. Among them, the most applicable method is a generation of wave with difference frequency under the three-waves interaction in a medium with quadratic nonlinear response. Below we propose a new effective tool for three times decreasing frequency of the incident pulse based on three-waves interaction in a medium with the quadratic susceptibility. At such interaction, a medium's response inherent cubic non-linearity appears due to so-called cascading SHG. The frequency down-conversion process possesses two stable modes. This is shown using multi-scale method. For each of the modes, the analytical solution is developed in the framework of the long pulse duration approximation without using the pump energy non-depletion approximation. The computer simulation results confirm those of analytical analysis. We show that the conversion efficiency of the incidentpump pulse energy achieves about 70%, if the low frequency wave incident intensity equals zero, or almost 100%, if the incident intensity of the low frequency wave is non-zero. The developed theoretical approach may be applied to other processes of the frequency down-conversion."
https://openalex.org/W4306247857,"The fundamental challenge in machine learning is ensuring that trained models generalize well to unseen data.

On the digit recognition task, the baseline CNN achieved an average internal test AUC of 99.87% (95% CI, 99.87-99.87%), which decreased to an average external test AUC of 91.85% (95% CI, 91.82-91.88%), with an average salvage of 35% from baseline upon adaptation. On the lung pathology classification task, the baseline CNN achieved an average internal test AUC of 78.07% (95% CI, 77.97-78.17%) and an average external test AUC of 71.43% (95% CI, 71.32-71.60%), with a salvage of 25% from baseline upon adaptation. Adversarial domain adaptation leads to improved model performance on radiographic data derived from multiple out-of-sample healthcare populations. This work can be applied to other medical imaging domains to help shape the deployment toolkit of machine learning in medicine."
https://openalex.org/W4306247863,"Background As the largest professional group, nurses and midwives play instrumental roles in healthcare delivery, supporting the smooth administration and operation of the health system. Consequently, the withdrawal of nursing and midwifery services via strike action has direct and indirect detrimental effects on access to healthcare. Objective The current study examined the impact of strike action by nurses and midwives with respect to access to and use of health services. Method Data were collected retrospectively from a total of 181 health facilities from all the 16 administrative regions of Ghana, with the support of field officers. Because the strike lasted for 3 days, the data collection span three consecutive days before the strike, three days of the strike and three consecutive days after the strike. Data analysis was focused comparing the utilization of healthcare services before, during and after strike. Data were analysed and presented on the various healthcare services. This was done separately for the health facility type and the 16 administrative regions. Findings The results showed that; (1) the average number of patients or clients who accessed healthcare services reduced drastically during the strike period, compared with before the strike. Majority of the regions recorded more than 70% decrease in service use during the strike period; (2) the average number of patients or clients who accessed healthcare services after the strike increased by more than 100% across majority of the regions. Conclusion The study showed that strike action by nurses and midwives negatively affected access to and utilization of healthcare services."
https://openalex.org/W4306247980,"To investigate the effect of surface water and underground water drip irrigation on cotton yield, dry matter accumulation and nutrients uptake, two consecutive field experiments were conducted. The first experiment (different mixing ratio irrigation) comprised of five ratios of underground water to surface water including; 1:0 (U), 0:1 (S), 1:1 (U:S = 1:1), 1:2 (U:S = 1:2) and 1:3 (U:S = 1:3). Whereas, the second experiment (round irrigation) comprised of eight treatments including: 1:3 (T1), 2:2 (T2), 3:1 (T3), {S:U 3:1 (T4)}, 2:2 {S:U (T5)}, 1:3 {S:U (T6)}, 4:0 (T7) and 0:4 (T8). The average concentration of leaves dry matter after 8th irrigation in different mixing ratio experiment was significantly increased by 131.2% (S), 34.4% (U: S = 1:1), 59.3% (U: S = 1:2), and 93.7% (U: S = 1:3), respectively, relative to U treatment. Likewise, the stem dry matter increased from 48.5 g (U), to 122.2 g (S) and 101.6 g (U:S = 1:3). The soil available N at 0-20 cm after 8th irrigation recorded an average increase rate of 40.1%, 6.6%, 13.5%, and 29.5%, respectively. However, at 20-40cm an average increase rate of 37.4% (S), 7.1% (U: S = 1:1), 20.0% (U: S = 1:2), and 21.9% (U: S = 1:3) were noted (p < 0.05). The highest cotton yield of 6571 kg h-1 was recorded in S treatment compared with the U treatment (5492 kg h-1), U: S = 1:1 (5502 kg h-1), U: S = 1:2 (5873 kg h-1) and U: S = 1:3 (6111 kg h-1). Contrastingly, in round irrigation experiment the highest leaves dry matter at various growth stages were recorded in T8 treatment. For instance, compared with T7 treatment an average increase rate of 50.6% (growth), 100.9% (boll) and 93.3% (boll opening), in stem dry matter were recorded in T8 treatment. Moreover, the concentration of N in round irrigation at 0-20 cm at different growth stages were 83.3±2.8 (growth stage), 79.01±1.84 (boll stage), and 96.16±3.83 (boll opening stage) in T8. Whereas, in T7 the concentration of N was 36.1±5.9 (growth), 54.51±2.81 (boll), and 53.9±3.83 (boll opening) (p < 0.05). Similarly, cotton yield were substantially higher in T8 applied treatment and follows the sequence of T8 > T1 > T4 > T2 > T5 > T3 > T6 > T7. Overall, our findings provide meaningful information to current irrigation practices in water scarce regions. Improving water use efficiency is a viable solution to the water scarcity. Therefore, surface water irrigation is recommended as an effective irrigation strategies to improve cotton yield and growth."
https://openalex.org/W4306248037,"Individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) present respiratory dysfunctions, mainly due to decreased chest wall expansion, which worsens with the course of the disease. These findings contribute to the restrictive respiratory pattern and the reduction in chest wall volume. According to literature, inspiratory muscle thixotropic conditioning maneuvers may improve lung volumes in these patients. The study aimed to determine the after-effects of respiratory muscle thixotropic maneuvers on breathing patterns and chest wall volumes of PD. A crossover study was performed with twelve patients with PD (8 males; mean age 63.9±8.8 years, FVC %pred 89.7±13.9, FEV 1%pred 91.2±15, FEV 1 /FVC %pred 83.7±5.7). Chest wall volumes were assessed using OEP during thixotropic maneuvers. Increases in EIV CW (mean of 126mL, p = 0.01) and EEV CW (mean of 150mL, p = 0.005) were observed after DI TLC (deep inspiration from total lung capacity) due to increases in pulmonary (RCp) and abdominal (RCa) ribcage compartments. Changes in ICo TLC (inspiratory contraction from TLC) led to significant EIV CW (mean of 224mL, p = 0.001) and EEV CW (mean of 229mL, p = 0.02) increases that were mainly observed in the RCp. No significant changes were found when performing DE RV (deep expiration from residual volume) and ICo RV (Inspiratory contraction from RV). Positive correlations were also observed between the degree of inspiratory contraction during ICo TLC and EEV RCp ( rho = 0.613, p = 0.03) and EIV RCp ( rho = 0.697, p = 0.01) changes. Thixotropy conditioning of inspiratory muscles at an inflated chest wall volume increases EIV CW and EEV CW in the ten subsequent breaths in PD patients. These maneuvers are easy to perform, free of equipment, low-cost, and may help patients improve chest wall volumes during rehabilitation."
https://openalex.org/W4306248079,"In Canada, pneumococcal vaccination is recommended to all adults aged ≥65 and those <65 who have one or more chronic medical conditions (CMCs). Understanding vaccine uptake and its determinants among eligible groups has important implications for reducing the burden of pneumococcal disease.Using data from a large national cohort of Canadian residents aged ≥47 years between 2015-2018, we calculated self-reported pneumococcal vaccine uptake among eligible groups, estimated associations between key factors and non-vaccination, assessed missed opportunities for vaccination (MOV) and examined risk factors for MOV. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for relevant associations were estimated through logistic regression.45.8% (95% CI: 45.2-46.5) of 22,246 participants aged ≥65 and 81.3% (95% CI: 80.5-82.0) of 10,815 individuals aged 47-64 with ≥1 CMC reported never having received a pneumococcal vaccine. Receipt of influenza vaccination in the previous year was associated with the lowest odds of pneumococcal non-vaccination (aOR = 0.14 [95% CI: 0.13-0.15] for older adults and aOR = 0.23 [95% CI: 0.20-0.26] for those aged 47-64 with ≥1 CMC). Pneumococcal vaccine uptake was also more likely in case of contact with a family doctor in the previous year (versus no contact), increased with age and varied widely across provinces. Among individuals recently vaccinated against influenza, 32.6% (95% CI: 31.9-33.4) of those aged ≥65 and 71.1% (95% CI: 69.9-72.3) of those aged 47-64 with ≥1 CMC missed an opportunity to get a pneumococcal vaccine. Among individuals who had contact with a family doctor, 44.8% (95% CI: 44.1-45.5) of those aged ≥65 and 80.4% (95% CI: 79.6-81.2) of those aged 47-64 with ≥1 CMC experienced a MOV.Pneumococcal vaccine uptake remains suboptimal among at-risk Canadian adults who are eligible for vaccination. Further research is needed to clarify the reasons behind missed opportunities for vaccination and adequately address the main barriers to pneumococcal vaccination."
https://openalex.org/W4306180609,"Quality of life (QoL) is an important measure of disease burden and general health perception. The relationship between early chronic kidney disease (CKD) and QoL remains poorly understood. The Oxford Renal Study (OxRen) cohort comprises 1063 adults aged ≥60 years from UK primary care practices screened for early CKD, grouped according to existing or screen-detected CKD diagnoses, or biochemistry results indicative of reduced renal function (referred to as transient estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) reduction).This study aimed to compare QoL in participants known to have CKD at recruitment to those identified as having CKD through a screening programme.Health profile data and multi-attribute utility scores were reported for two generic questionnaires: 5-level EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D-5L) and ICEpop CAPability measure for Adults (ICECAP-A). QoL was compared between patients with existing and screen-detected CKD; those with transient eGFR reduction served as the reference group in univariable and multivariable linear regression.Mean and standard deviation utility scores were not significantly different between the subgroups for EQ-5D-5L (screen-detected:0.785±0.156, n = 480, transient:0.779±0.157, n = 261, existing CKD:0.763±0.171, n = 322, p = 0.216) or ICECAP-A (screen-detected:0.909±0.094, transient:0.904±0.110, existing CKD:0.894±0.115, p = 0.200). Age, smoking status, and number of comorbidities were identified as independent predictors of QoL in this cohort.QoL of participants with existing CKD diagnoses was not significantly different from those with screen-detected CKD or transient eGFR reduction and was similar to UK mean scores for the same age, suggesting that patient burden of early CKD is minor. Moreover, CKD-related comorbidities contribute more significantly to disease burden in earlier stages of CKD than renal function per se. Larger prospective studies are required to define the relationship between QoL and CKD progression more precisely. These data also confirm the essentially asymptomatic nature of CKD, implying that routine screening or case finding are required to diagnose it."
https://openalex.org/W4306180633,"Beijing plain is a strong earthquake tectonic area in China. There was a Sanhe-Pinggu earthquake with Ms8 that happened in1679. The seismogenic fault of this earthquake is called Xiadian fault. Our work found fault with a similar strike and opposite dip in the west of the Xiadian fault, which is called the Xiadian west fault in this paper. Six shallow seismic profiles have been constructed to determine the location of the fault in Sanhe city, and the late Quaternary activity of the fault is studied with the method of combined drilling, magnetic susceptibility logging, and luminescence dating. The results of shallow seismic exploration show that the fault is zigzag and generally strikes NE and inclines NW. According to the core histogram and logging curves of ten boreholes and eight effective dating data, the buried depth of the upper breakpoint of the concealed fault is about 12 m, which dislocates the late Pleistocene strata. The effective dating result of this set of strata is 36.52 ±5.39 ka. The vertical slip rate has been about 0.075± 0.023 mm/a since the late Pleistocene and about 0.058 ± 0.030 mm/a since the late period of the late Pleistocene. It can be inferred that the Xiadian west fault is probably a part of the seismogenic structure of the Sanhe-Pinggu Ms8 earthquake that happened in 1679. In a broad sense, the Xiadian fault zone is likely to extend to the southwest along the Xiadian west fault."
https://openalex.org/W4306180645,"Introduction Medication errors are an important cause of morbidity and mortality. The p harmacist-led I T-based i n tervention to reduce c linically important medication er rors (PINCER) intervention was shown to reduce medication errors when tested in a cluster randomised controlled trial and when implemented across one region of England. Now that it has been rolled out nationally, and to enhance findings from evaluations with staff and stakeholders, this paper is the first to report patients’ perceived acceptability on the use of PINCER in primary care and proposes suggestions on how delivery of PINCER related care could be delivered in a way that is acceptable and not unnecessarily burdensome. Methods A total of 46 participants living with long-term health conditions who had experience of medication reviews and/or monitoring were recruited through patient participant groups and social media. Semi-structured, qualitative interviews and focus groups were conducted face-to-face or via telephone. A thematic analysis was conducted and findings mapped to the constructs of the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability (TFA). Results Two themes were identified and interpreted within the most relevant TFA construct: Perceptions on the purpose and components of PINCER (Affective Attitude and Intervention Coherence) and Perceived patient implications (Burden and Self-efficacy). Overall perceptions on PINCER were positive with participants showing good understanding of the components. Access to medication reviews, which PINCER related care can involve, was reported to be limited and a lack of consistency in practitioners delivering reviews was considered challenging, as was lack of communication between primary care and other health-care providers. Patients thought it would be helpful if medication reviews and prescription renewal times were synchronised. Remote medication review consultations were more convenient for some but viewed as a barrier to communication by others. It was acknowledged that some patients may be more resistant to change and more willing to accept changes initiated by general practitioners. Conclusions Participants found the concept of PINCER acceptable; however, acceptability could be improved if awareness on the role of primary care pharmacists is raised and patient-pharmacist relationships enhanced. Being transparent with communication and delivering streamlined and consistent but flexible PINCER related care is recommended."

The study was a non-blinded single arm 2 stage study. Stage I was a single escalating dose (n = 5) [2.5 mg Δ9-THC and 2.5 mg CBD) versus a 3-fold escalated dose. Stage II was an up-titrated dose in patients with advanced cancers and intractable pain (n = 25). During Stage I with an increased cannabis-based medicine dose, maximum observed plasma concentrations of cannabinoids were dose dependant. The water-soluble formulation in the current study resulted in a higher median (min, max) systemic exposure of Δ9-THC than CBD (AUC from 2.5 mg each of Δ9-THC and CBD, was 1.71 ng mL.h-1 (1.1, 6.6) and 0.65 ng mL.h-1 (0.49, 4.1), respectively). During stage II a subgroup of patients diagnosed with breast and prostate cancers with bone metastases, had the highest mean pain score improvement from baseline of 40% (unadjusted) and 33% (adjusted for rescue medication use). For all patients the most reported adverse events were mild or moderate drowsiness affecting 11 (44%) and 4 (6%) patients, respectively, and nausea and vomiting that affected 18 (72%) patients. The water-soluble cannabis-based medicine provided acceptable bioavailability for Δ9-THC/CBD, appeared safe and tolerable in advanced incurable cancers with uncontrolled pain with preliminary evidence of analgesic efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W4306180864,"Understanding how humans master complex skills has the potential for wide-reaching societal benefit. Research has shown that one important aspect of effective skill learning is the temporal distribution of practice episodes (i.e., distributed practice). Using a large observational sample of players (n = 162,417) drawn from a competitive and popular online game (League of Legends), we analysed the relationship between practice distribution and performance through time. We compared groups of players who exhibited different play schedules using data slicing and machine learning techniques, to show that players who cluster gameplay into shorter time frames ultimately achieve lower performance levels than those who space their games across longer time windows. Additionally, we found that the timing of intensive play periods does not affect final performance-it is the overall amount of spacing that matters. These results extend some of the key findings in the literature on practice and learning to an ecologically valid environment with huge n. We discuss our work in relation to recent studies that have examined practice effects using Big Data and suggest solutions for salient confounds."
https://openalex.org/W4306180911,"Bacillus anthracis is a gram-positive, rod-shaped and endospore-forming bacterium that causes anthrax, a deadly disease to livestock and, occasionally, to humans. The spores are extremely hardy and may remain viable for many years in soil. Previous studies have identified East Qinghai and neighbouring Gansu in northwest China as a potential source of anthrax infection. This study was carried out to identify conditions and areas in the Qinghai Lake basin that are environmentally suitable for B. anthracis distribution. Anthrax occurrence data from 2005-2016 and environmental variables were spatially modeled by a maximum entropy algorithm to evaluate the contribution of the variables to the distribution of B. anthracis. Principal Component Analysis and Variance Inflation Analysis were adopted to limit the number of environmental variables and minimize multicollinearity. Model performance was evaluated using AUC (area under the curve) ROC (receiver operating characteristics) curves. The three variables that contributed most to the suitability model for B. anthracis are a relatively high annual mean temperature of -2 to 0°C, (53%), soil type classified as; cambisols and kastanozems (35%), and a high human population density of 40 individuals per km2 (12%). The resulting distribution map identifies the permanently inhabited rim of the Qinghai Lake as highly suitable for B. anthracis. Our environmental suitability map and the identified variables provide the nature reserve managers and animal health authorities readily available information to devise both surveillance strategy and control strategy (administration of vaccine to livestock) in B. anthracis suitable regions to abate future epidemics."

Genomics of Cardicola spp. have thus far been limited to molecular phylogenetics of select gene sequences. In this study, sequencing of the C. forsteri genome was performed using Illumina short-read and Oxford Nanopore long-read technologies. The sequences were assembled de novo using a hybrid of short and long reads, which produced a high-quality contig-level assembly (N50 > 430 kb and L50 = 138). The assembly was also relatively complete and unfragmented, comprising 66% and 7.2% complete and fragmented metazoan Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCOs), respectively. A large portion (> 55%) of the genome was made up of intergenic repetitive elements, primarily long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), while protein-coding regions cover > 6%. Gene prediction identified 8,564 hypothetical polypeptides, > 77% of which are homologous to published sequences of other species. The identification of select putative proteins, including cathepsins, calpains, tetraspanins, and glycosyltransferases is discussed.

https://openalex.org/W4306180920,"Understanding biological and environmental factors that influence movement behaviors and population connectivity of highly migratory fishes is essential for cooperative international management and conservation of exploited populations, like bluefin tuna. Pacific bluefin tuna Thunnus orientalis (PBT) spawn in the western Pacific Ocean and then juveniles disperse to foraging grounds across the North Pacific. Several techniques have been used to characterize the distribution and movement of PBT, but few methods can provide complete records across ontogeny from larvae to adult in individual fish. Here, otolith biominerals of large PBT collected from the western, eastern, and south Pacific Ocean, were analyzed for a suite of trace elements across calcified/proteinaceous growth zones to investigate patterns across ontogeny. Three element:Ca ratios, Li:Ca, Mg:Ca, and Mn:Ca displayed enrichment in the otolith core, then decreased to low stable levels after age 1-2 years. Thermal and metabolic physiologies, common diets, or ambient water chemistry likely influenced otolith crystallization, protein content, and elemental incorporation in early life. Although similar patterns were also exhibited for otolith Sr:Ca, Ba:Ca and Zn:Ca in the first year, variability in these elements differed significantly after age-2 and in the otolith edges by capture region, suggesting ocean-specific environmental factors or growth-related physiologies affected otolith mineralization across ontogeny."
https://openalex.org/W4306181021,"Understanding the scale of the threat posed by SARS-CoV2 B.1.1.529, or Omicron, variant formed a key problem in public health in the early part of 2022. Early evidence indicated that the variant was more transmissible and less severe than previous variants. As the virus was expected to spread quickly through the population of England, it was important that some understanding of the immunological landscape of the country was developed. This paper attempts to estimate the number of people with good immunity to the Omicron variant, defined as either recent infection with two doses of vaccine, or two doses of vaccine with a recent booster dose. To achieve this, we use a process of iterative proportional fitting to estimate the cell values of a contingency table, using national immunisation records and real-time model infection estimates as marginal values. Our results indicate that, despite the increased risk of immune evasion with the Omicron variant, a high proportion of England's population had good immunity to the virus, particularly in older age groups. However, low rates of immunity in younger populations may allow endemic infection to persist for some time."
https://openalex.org/W4306181050,"This study explores the dissemination potential of a COVID-19 message embedded in a sponsored social media post. The moderating role of prior parasocial interaction and influencer-brand fit were considered. 365 respondents participated in the study. A 3 (control, congruent, incongruent brand) × 2 (control, COVID-19 message) between-subject online experiment was designed and executed. Data were analyzed using a mediated moderation model. Results indicated that the three-way interaction of the COVID-19 message, brand presence and prior parasocial interaction affected the perceived influencer credibility, attitudes towards the social media post, and the behavioral engagement with the post. When the COVID-19 message was included in the post, increased prior parasocial interaction intensified the positive effect of influencer-brand fit on influencer credibility, which in turn resulted in a more positive attitude towards the post, and a higher behavioral engagement. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed."

Although depression is known to affect injecting behaviors and HIV treatment, its overall impact on HIV transmission has not been quantified. Using mathematical modeling, we sought to estimate secondary HIV transmissions and identify differences by depression among PWID.We analyzed longitudinal data from 455 PWID living with HIV in Vietnam during 2009-2013. Using a Bernoulli process model with individual-level viral load and behavioral data from baseline and 6-month follow-up visits, we estimated secondary HIV transmission events from participants to their potentially susceptible injecting partners. To evaluate differences by depression, we compared modeled transmissions per 1,000 PWID across depressive symptom categories (severe, mild, or no symptoms) in the three months before each visit.We estimated a median of 41.2 (2.5th, 97.5th percentiles: 33.2-49.2) secondary transmissions from all reported acts of sharing injection equipment with 833 injecting partners in the three months before baseline. Nearly half (41%) of modeled transmissions arose from fewer than 5% of participants in that period. Modeled transmissions per 1,000 PWID in that period were highest for severe depressive symptoms (100.4, 80.6-120.2) vs. mild (87.0, 68.2-109.4) or no symptoms (78.9, 63.4-94.1). Transmission estimates fell to near-zero at the 6-month visit.Secondary transmissions were predicted to increase with depression severity, although most arose from a small number of participants. Our findings suggest that effective depression interventions could have the important added benefit of reducing HIV transmission among PWID."

This paper presents an optimal path planning model for UAV to control its direction during target touring, where UAV and target are at the same altitude. Geometric interpretation of the given model is provided when the vehicles consider connecting an initial position to the destination position with specific target touring. We develop a nonlinear constrained model based on an arc parameterization approach to determine the UAV's optimal path touring a target. The model is then extended to touring finite numbers of targets and optimizing the routes. The model is found reliable through several simulations. Numerical experiments are conducted and we have shown that the UAV's generated path satisfies vehicle dynamics constraints, tours the targets, and arrives at its destination."
https://openalex.org/W4306181150,"Background Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is caused by a deficiency of a molecule called surfactant. It occurs in newborns born before 37 weeks of gestation. It is a main cause of morbidity and mortality in the early neonatal period. Therefore, this study aims to assess median time to recovery and predictors of preterm neonates with respiratory distress syndrome admitted in University of Gondar comprehensive specialized hospital Northwest Ethiopia 2020. Methods Institution based retrospective follow up study was conducted on 386 preterm neonates with hyaline membrane disease who were admitted in the neonatal intensive care unit from January, 2016 to December 2018. The data were entered in to EPI info version 7.0 and transferred to Stata version 14.0 for analysis. Both bi-variable and multi variable Weibull parametric model were fitted to identify predictors with 95% confidence interval of hazard ratio (HR) and p-value. P-value less than 0.05 in the multivariable model showed the presence of significant association between covariates and the dependent variable. Results The overall median length of recovery were 11 day with an interquartile range of (7, 16) neonate-days. Being a product of multiple pregnancy (AHR 1.67; 95%CI (1.25, 2.23)), vaginal mode of delivery (AHR 1.6; 95%CI (1.13, 2.26)), and neonatal hypothermia at admission (AHR 1.6; 95%CI (1.13, 2.26)) were found to be significant predictors of time to recovery. Conclusion In this study the median time to recovery of preterm neonates with respiratory distress syndrome was slower than the clinical recommendations. Receiving bag and mask ventilation and hypothermia decreased the recovery whereas, vaginal delivery gestational age at birth, being multiple pregnancy, birth weight ≥2000grams were enhance the recovery of preterm neonates with RDS."
https://openalex.org/W4306181152,"Malaria remains a public health challenge in endemic countries of the world. The use of Long-lasting Insecticidal Nets (LLINs) is one of the major ways of malaria vector control. Recent evidence however suggests some LLINs are unable to maintain their effectiveness over their useful life span. This study assessed the bio-efficacy, physical integrity, use and attrition at 6 and 12-months post-distribution of LLINs (LifeNet).Following a mass distribution of LLINs in the West Mamprusi District of the North-East region of Ghana in 2018, a total of 147 LLINs were sampled for physical integrity and attrition assessment using hole size and the number of holes as a measure of the proportionate hole index (pHI). Bioassays were conducted on sixty randomly selected LLINs using the WHO guidelines for bio-efficacy testing (cone tests), (20 each at baseline, midline and endline) over a one-year study period. Bed net ownership and use as well as malaria vector resistance status were also assessed.Findings indicate high bio-efficacy of approximately 100% average mortalities of mosquitoes at baseline, 6-months and 12-months post-distribution. A small proportion of LLINs (0.8% and 5.6% at the 6 and 12-months surveys respectively) were damaged beyond maintenance while 62.4% and 62.7% of LLINs were used the night before the survey for 6 and 12-months post-distribution respectively. Households with electricity were less likely to use LLINs compared to those without electricity (P-value = 0.016, OR = 0.39). There were 20 fewer LLINs recovered at the 12-months relative to the 6-months resulting in 14.3% attrition rate. Susceptibility testing showed high pyrethroid and organochlorine resistance (18%, 67.5% and 3.8%) to local malaria vectors respectively), whereas organophosphates and carbamates recorded vector susceptibility of 100% for pirimiphos-methyl and 98.7% for bendiocarb.Biological efficacy, physical integrity and net attrition during the study period were in conformity with respect to the WHOPES one year net use. LLINs remained effective after one-year of usage. Net ownership was high in the study households. There should be continuous and regular distribution campaigns to maintain high coverage."

A hydrogen peroxide colorimetric method and high performance liquid chromatography showed that APPJ produced low amounts of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Ten-week-old male C57BL/6j mice with normal blood glucose levels (DM- group) and 10-week-old male C57BLKS/J Iar-+Leprdb/+Leprdb mice (DM+ group) received two full-thickness cutaneous wounds (4 mm in diameter) on both sides of the dorsum. Wounds were treated with or without the plasma jet or argon gas for 1 minute and were then covered with a hydrocolloid dressing (Hydrocolloid), according to which mice were divided into the following groups: DM+Plasma, DM+Argon, DM+Hydrocolloid, DM-Plasma, DM-Argon, and DM-Hydrocolloid. Exudate weights, wound areas, and wound area ratios were recorded every day. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was performed to assess re-epithelialization and α-SMA immunohistological staining to evaluate the formation of new blood vessels. Non-thermal plasma under non-contact conditions reduced the production of exudate. Exudate weights were smaller in the DM+Plasma group than in the DM+Hydrocolloid and DM+Argon groups. The wound area ratio was smaller for plasma-treated wounds, and was also smaller in the DM+Plasma group than in the DM+Hydrocolloid and DM+Argon groups on days 1-21 (p<0.01). Wound areas were smaller in the DM-Plasma group than in the DM-Argon group until day 14 and differences were significant on days 1-5 (p<0.01). The percentage of re-epithelialization was significantly higher in the DM+Plasma group than in the DM+Argon and DM+Hydrocolloid groups (p<0.01). The number of new blood vessels that had formed by day 7 was significantly higher in the DM+Plasma group than in the DM+Hydrocolloid and DM+Argon groups (p<0.05). These results indicate that treatment with the current non-thermal plasma APPJ device under non-contact conditions accelerated wound healing in diabetic mice."

We aimed to describe frequency and patient attributes associated with emergency department (ED) visits within 30 days of inpatient discharge in a Portuguese health region–Algarve. Methods Secondary data on inpatient and emergency care, for adult patients discharged in 2016. To analyse the association between outcome–ED visit within 30 days of discharge–and selected variables (admission type and groups of or individual illnesses/conditions), we used age- and sex-adjusted odds ratios (aOR). We included all adult patients (aged ≥18 years) discharged during 2016 from the region’s public hospital inpatient departments. The period for ED visits also included January 2017. Results For 21,744 adults discharged in 2016 (mean age: 58 years; 60% female), 23 percent visited ED at least once within 30 days of discharge. Seventy-five percent of those visits were triaged with high clinical priority. Patients with more comorbidities or specific groups of illnesses/conditions had a significant increased risk of returning ED (aOR and 95% confidence intervals–endocrine: 1.566; 1.256–1.951; mental illness: 1.421; 1.180–1.713; respiratory: 1.308; 1.136–1.505). Conclusion Patients returned ED after inpatient discharge frequently and for severe reasons. Patients with more comorbidities or specific groups of illnesses/conditions (endocrine, mental illness or respiratory) had an increased risk of returning ED, so these groups may be prioritized in further research and health system initiatives to improve care before and after discharge."
https://openalex.org/W4306248039,"Tea mosquito bug (TMB) is a serious pest of cocoa whose prevalence is high, mostly during summer and post monsoon season. Three species of tea mosquito bug have been reported on cocoa: Helopeltis antonii Signoret, H . theivora Waterhouse, and H . bradyi Waterhouse. H . theivora is the most prevalent one causing damage to young shoots, cherelles and pods. Rearing of tea mosquito bug on cocoa was found to be a failure in the present study hence Helopeltis theivora Waterhouse was maintained on the alternate host mile-a-minute ( Mikania micrantha Kunth ) under laboratory condition in insect rearing cages. Using freshly reared tea mosquito bugs twenty cocoa hybrids were screened for resistance and were ranked after 72 hours of screening. All the hybrids having less than three lesions per plant in seedlings and less than 33 lesions on pods were ranked as highly resistant. It was observed that hybrids classified as highly resistant had significantly higher phenol content than those classified as susceptible. The significantly low phenol content in the susceptible hybrids suggests that phenolics have a function in mediating resistance to tea mosquito bug in cocoa. From correlation and regression analysis it is confirmed that phenol content can be used as a potential marker indicating the level of resistance of cocoa hybrids against tea mosquito bug resistance."
