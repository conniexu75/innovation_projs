https://openalex.org/W2904763455,"INTRODUCTION Strong genetic associations have been found for a number of psychiatric disorders. However, understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms remains challenging. RATIONALE To address this challenge, the PsychENCODE Consortium has developed a comprehensive online resource and integrative models for the functional genomics of the human brain. RESULTS The base of the pyramidal resource is the datasets generated by PsychENCODE, including bulk transcriptome, chromatin, genotype, and Hi-C datasets and single-cell transcriptomic data from ~32,000 cells for major brain regions. We have merged these with data from Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx), ENCODE, Roadmap Epigenomics, and single-cell analyses. Via uniform processing, we created a harmonized resource, allowing us to survey functional genomics data on the brain over a sample size of 1866 individuals. From this uniformly processed dataset, we created derived data products. These include lists of brain-expressed genes, coexpression modules, and single-cell expression profiles for many brain cell types; ~79,000 brain-active enhancers with associated Hi-C loops and topologically associating domains; and ~2.5 million expression quantitative-trait loci (QTLs) comprising ~238,000 linkage-disequilibrium–independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms and of other types of QTLs associated with splice isoforms, cell fractions, and chromatin activity. By using these, we found that &gt;88% of the cross-population variation in brain gene expression can be accounted for by cell fraction changes. Furthermore, a number of disorders and aging are associated with changes in cell-type proportions. The derived data also enable comparison between the brain and other tissues. In particular, by using spectral analyses, we found that the brain has distinct expression and epigenetic patterns, including a greater extent of noncoding transcription than other tissues. The top level of the resource consists of integrative networks for regulation and machine-learning models for disease prediction. The networks include a full gene regulatory network (GRN) for the brain, linking transcription factors, enhancers, and target genes from merging of the QTLs, generalized element-activity correlations, and Hi-C data. By using this network, we link disease genes to genome-wide association study (GWAS) variants for psychiatric disorders. For schizophrenia, we linked 321 genes to the 142 reported GWAS loci. We then embedded the regulatory network into a deep-learning model to predict psychiatric phenotypes from genotype and expression. Our model gives a ~6-fold improvement in prediction over additive polygenic risk scores. Moreover, it achieves a ~3-fold improvement over additive models, even when the gene expression data are imputed, highlighting the value of having just a small amount of transcriptome data for disease prediction. Lastly, it highlights key genes and pathways associated with disorder prediction, including immunological, synaptic, and metabolic pathways, recapitulating de novo results from more targeted analyses. CONCLUSION Our resource and integrative analyses have uncovered genomic elements and networks in the brain, which in turn have provided insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders. Our deep-learning model improves disease risk prediction over traditional approaches and can be extended with additional data types (e.g., microRNA and neuroimaging). A comprehensive functional genomic resource for the adult human brain. The resource forms a three-layer pyramid. The bottom layer includes sequencing datasets for traits, such as schizophrenia. The middle layer represents derived datasets, including functional genomic elements and QTLs. The top layer contains integrated models, which link genotypes to phenotypes.

https://openalex.org/W2903631495,"INTRODUCTION The DNA of protein-coding genes is transcribed into mRNA, which is translated into proteins. The “coding genome” describes the DNA that contains the information to make these proteins and represents ~1.5% of the human genome. Newly arising de novo mutations (variants observed in a child but not in either parent) in the coding genome contribute to numerous childhood developmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Discovery of these effects is aided by the triplet code that enables the functional impact of many mutations to be readily deciphered. In contrast, the “noncoding genome” covers the remaining ~98.5% and includes elements that regulate when, where, and to what degree protein-coding genes are transcribed. Understanding this noncoding sequence could provide insights into human disorders and refined control of emerging genetic therapies. Yet little is known about the role of mutations in noncoding regions, including whether they contribute to childhood developmental disorders, which noncoding elements are most vulnerable to disruption, and the manner in which information is encoded in the noncoding genome. RATIONALE Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provides the opportunity to identify the majority of genetic variation in each individual. By performing WGS on 1902 quartet families including a child affected with ASD, one unaffected sibling control, and their parents, we identified ~67 de novo mutations across each child’s genome. To characterize the functional role of these mutations, we integrated multiple datasets relating to gene function, genes implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, conservation across species, and epigenetic markers, thereby combinatorially defining 55,143 categories. The scope of the problem—testing for an excess of de novo mutations in cases relative to controls for each category—is challenging because there are more categories than families. RESULTS Comparing cases to controls, we observed an excess of de novo mutations in cases in individual categories in the coding genome but not in the noncoding genome. To overcome the challenge of detecting noncoding association, we used machine learning tools to develop a de novo risk score to look for an excess of de novo mutations across multiple categories. This score demonstrated a contribution to ASD risk from coding mutations and a weaker, but significant, contribution from noncoding mutations. This noncoding signal was driven by mutations in the promoter region, defined as the 2000 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) where mRNA synthesis starts. The strongest promoter signals were defined by conservation across species and transcription factor binding sites. Well-defined promoter elements (e.g., TATA-box) are usually observed within 80 nucleotides of the TSS; however, the strongest ASD association was observed distally, 750 to 2000 nucleotides upstream of the TSS. CONCLUSION We conclude that de novo mutations in the noncoding genome contribute to ASD. The clearest evidence of noncoding ASD association came from mutations at evolutionarily conserved nucleotides in the promoter region. The enrichment for transcription factor binding sites, primarily in the distal promoter, suggests that these mutations may disrupt gene transcription via their interaction with enhancer elements in the promoter region, rather than interfering with transcriptional initiation directly. Promoter regions in autism. De novo mutations from 1902 quartet families are assigned to 55,143 annotation categories, which are each assessed for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) association by comparing mutation counts in cases and sibling controls. A de novo risk score demonstrated a noncoding contribution to ASD driven by promoter mutations, especially at sites conserved across species, in the distal promoter or targeted by transcription factors."

Matharu et al. tested whether a CRISPR-based activation system (CRISPRa) could rescue a haploinsufficient phenotype by increasing the gene expression levels of the existing normal copy (see the Perspective by Montefiori and Nobrega). By delivering this system into the mouse hypothalamus using adeno-associated virus, they rescued the obesity phenotype caused by haploinsufficiency of either of two genes known to promote obesity when mutated in mice and humans. These results highlight the translational potential of the CRISPR activation system to treat haploinsufficient disease. Science , this issue p. eaau0629 ; see also p. 231"
https://openalex.org/W2904785741,"Genes implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders are active in human fetal brain, yet difficult to study in a longitudinal fashion. We demonstrate that organoids from human pluripotent cells model cerebral cortical development on the molecular level before 16 weeks postconception. A multiomics analysis revealed differentially active genes and enhancers, with the greatest changes occurring at the transition from stem cells to progenitors. Networks of converging gene and enhancer modules were assembled into six and four global patterns of expression and activity across time. A pattern with progressive down-regulation was enriched with human-gained enhancers, suggesting their importance in early human brain development. A few convergent gene and enhancer modules were enriched in autism-associated genes and genomic variants in autistic children. The organoid model helps identify functional elements that may drive disease onset."
https://openalex.org/W2904628228,"INTRODUCTION Chromosomal conformations, topologically associated chromatin domains (TADs) assembling in nested fashion across hundreds of kilobases, and other “three-dimensional genome” (3DG) structures bypass the linear genome on a kilo- or megabase scale and play an important role in transcriptional regulation. Most of the genetic variants associated with risk for schizophrenia (SZ) are common and could be located in enhancers, repressors, and other regulatory elements that influence gene expression; however, the role of the brain’s 3DG for SZ genetic risk architecture, including developmental and cell type–specific regulation, remains poorly understood. RATIONALE We monitored changes in 3DG after isogenic differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) into neurons or astrocyte-like glial cells on a genome-wide scale using Hi-C. With this in vitro model of brain development, we mapped cell type–specific chromosomal conformations associated with SZ risk loci and defined a risk-associated expanded genome space. RESULTS Neural differentiation was associated with genome-wide 3DG remodeling, including pruning and de novo formations of chromosomal loopings. The NPC-to-neuron transition was defined by the pruning of loops involving regulators of cell proliferation, morphogenesis, and neurogenesis, which is consistent with a departure from a precursor stage toward postmitotic neuronal identity. Loops lost during NPC-to-glia transition included many genes associated with neuron-specific functions, which is consistent with non-neuronal lineage commitment. However, neurons together with NPCs, as compared with glia, harbored a much larger number of chromosomal interactions anchored in common variant sequences associated with SZ risk. Because spatial 3DG proximity of genes is an indicator for potential coregulation, we tested whether the neural cell type–specific SZ-related “chromosomal connectome” showed evidence of coordinated transcriptional regulation and proteomic interaction of the participating genes. To this end, we generated lists of genes anchored in cell type–specific SZ risk-associated interactions. Thus, for the NPC-specific interactions, we counted 386 genes, including 146 within the risk loci and another 240 genes positioned elsewhere in the linear genome but connected via intrachromosomal contacts to risk locus sequences. Similarly, for the neuron-specific interactions, we identified 385 genes: 158 within risk loci and 227 outside of risk loci. Last, for glia-specific interactions, we identified 201 genes: 88 within and 113 outside of risk loci. We labeled the genes located outside of schizophrenia risk loci as “risk locus–connect,” which we define as a collection of genes identified only through Hi-C interaction data, expanding—depending on cell type—by 50 to 150% the current network of known genes overlapping risk sequences that is informed only by genome-wide association studies. This disease-related chromosomal connectome was associated with “clusters” of coordinated gene expression and protein interactions, with at least one cluster strongly enriched for regulators of neuronal connectivity and synaptic plasticity and another cluster for chromatin-associated proteins, including transcriptional regulators. CONCLUSION Our study shows that neural differentiation is associated with highly cell type–specific 3DG remodeling. This process is paralleled by an expansion of 3DG space associated with SZ risk. Specifically, developmentally regulated chromosomal conformation changes at SZ-relevant sequences disproportionally occurred in neurons, highlighting the existence of cell type–specific disease risk vulnerabilities in spatial genome organization. 3DG remodeling across neuronal differentiation with parallel expansion of SZ risk space. (Left) Chromatin conformation assays reveal pruning of short-range loops in neurons along with widening of TADs upon differentiation from NPCs. (Right) Cell type–specific chromatin interactions, functionally validated with CRISPR assays, expand the network of known risk-associated genes (blue circle), which show evidence for coregulation at the transcriptomic and proteomic levels."

https://openalex.org/W2905430542,"Forgetting and receptor removal The trafficking of AMPA receptors to and from the surface of postsynaptic membranes regulates synaptic strength and underlies learning and memory. Awasthi et al. found that the integral membrane protein synaptotagmin-3 (Syt3) is predominantly found on postsynaptic endocytic zones of neurons, where it promotes AMPA receptor internalization (see the Perspective by Mandelberg and Tsien). In Syt3 overexpressing or knockdown neurons, synaptic transmission and short-term plasticity were unchanged. However, in neurons from Syt3 knockout mice, synaptic long-term depression was abolished and decaying long-term potentiation endured. In Syt3 knockout mice, spatial learning was unaltered; however, these animals showed signs of impaired forgetting and relearning during the water maze spatial memory task.

A second aim was to determine the whole blood taurine concentrations in a representative sample of healthy golden retrievers.Twenty-four client-owned golden retrievers with documented taurine deficiency and dilated cardiomyopathy and 52 healthy client-owned golden retrievers.In this multicenter prospective observational study, baseline and follow-up echocardiographic data, complete diet and medical histories, and whole blood, plasma, or serum taurine concentrations were obtained. Baseline and follow-up echocardiographic data were compared. Associations were evaluated between specific diets and taurine deficiency or congestive heart failure. The prevalence of low whole blood taurine concentrations in the healthy golden retrievers was calculated.Twenty-three of 24 dogs diagnosed with taurine deficiency and dilated cardiomyopathy were fed diets that were either grain-free, legume-rich, or a combination of these factors. None of these diets were feeding trial tested using Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) procedures. Twenty-three of 24 dogs had significant improvement in their echocardiographic parameters and normalization of taurine concentrations following diet change and taurine supplementation. Nine of 11 dogs diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF) had resolution of their congestion at follow-up with five no longer requiring diuretic therapy and four tolerating diuretic dose reduction by >50%.Certain diets and diet characteristics were associated with the development of taurine deficiency. Taurine deficiency and dilated cardiomyopathy in golden retrievers is likely multifactorial, including a combination of dietary, metabolic, and genetic factors."
https://openalex.org/W2904843472,"Climbing vibrational levels Vibrational excitation of molecules adsorbed on a surface is usually limited because the vibrational energy is rapidly transferred into phonons, the vibrational modes of the substrate. Chen et al. found that this is not the case for CO molecules adsorbed on a surface of NaCl. The CO molecules efficiently transferred vibrational energy within groups of molecules from one high excitation state to another until they reached the dissociation limit. This process was possible because of the close proximity of the molecules and the limited transfer of energy to just one phonon mode in the salt surface. Science , this issue p. 158"
https://openalex.org/W2905274959,"Vaccine hesitancy has been little studied in low- and middle-income countries but is a potential concern because vaccine refusal may increase the burden of infectious diseases and impede control efforts. The aim of this study was to compare vaccine hesitancy between locals, long-time city residents, and non-locals, who have more recently moved to the city from either other urban or rural areas, in Shanghai, China.Parents of infants ≤3 months of age were surveyed at immunization clinics in Shanghai, China. Participants completed a paper questionnaire utilizing the 10-item Vaccine Hesitancy Scale, which was developed by the World Health Organization Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization. Items were grouped based on internal consistency, and regressed onto demographic variables using a negative binomial model.In total, 1,188 (92.5%) individuals participated. For most items on the scale, parents expressed positive beliefs about vaccines. However, about half of parents somewhat or strongly agreed that new vaccines carried more risks than older vaccines, and 71.6% somewhat or strongly agreed that they were concerned about serious adverse effects. Seven items from the Vaccine Hesitancy Scale were highly correlated and mapped onto ""lack of confidence""; the other three items were analysed separately. Compared to mothers, fathers had less lack of confidence (β: -0.06, 95% CI: -0.12, -0.01), and individuals living in the outer suburbs (β: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.01, 0.25) and rural non-locals (β: 0.10, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.18) had greater lack of confidence in vaccines compared to their urban or local counterparts, respectively.Shanghai parents professed confidence in certain vaccine benefits, but vaccine messaging could focus on addressing misconceptions about vaccines for diseases no longer common, newer vaccines, and adverse effects associated with vaccination. These messages may need to be separately tailored to locals and non-locals, who have differing concerns."

At central synapses, the CaV2 channel family, CaV2.1 (P/Q type), CaV2.2 (N type), and CaV2.3 (R type), mediate Ca2+ signals that trigger neurotransmitter release (Simms and Zamponi, 2014Simms B.A. Zamponi G.W.

A critical determinant of synaptic vesicle (SV) release probability (Pr) and release kinetics in response to APs is CaV2 subtype number (Ariel et al., 2013Ariel P. Hoppa M.B. Ryan T.A.

Therefore, elucidating mechanisms regulating presynaptic CaV2 subtype levels is fundamental to understanding information encoding in the nervous system. Since synaptic CaV2 levels at the AZ are distinct from the soma (Doughty et al., 1998Doughty J.M. Barnes-Davies M. Rusznák Z. Harasztosi C. Forsythe I.D.

Although the molecular identity of slots is unknown, it is hypothesized that they differentially interact with the CaV2 α1 subunit to set relative CaV2 levels and that slot preference can vary depending on synapse type. It is thought some slots are CaV2.2 specific and that others prefer CaV2.1 but can accept CaV2.2, but that none are CaV2.1 exclusive and that these slots are always saturated (Cao et al., 2004Cao Y.Q.

This suggests that at CaV2.1-dominated presynaptic terminals in vivo, CaV2.1-exclusive slots exist, and CaV2.1 are preferred over CaV2.2. More importantly, if slots existed in a CaV2.1-saturated state, this would constrain how CaV2.1-exclusive presynaptic terminals could increase Ca2+ entry to modulate synaptic strength and SV release kinetics and implies that increases in Ca2+ entry could only be achieved through CaV2.1 channel modulation, and not by increasing CaV2.1 levels in the presynaptic AZ. To investigate the role of the CaV2 α1 subunit in AZ preference and CaV2.1 saturation states at a Cav2.1 dominate presynaptic terminal, we used the calyx of Held, a giant axosomatic presynaptic terminal in the auditory brainstem which is similar to GABAergic cerebellar, thalamic, and hippocampal synapse and transitions from a mixed CaV2 subtype to CaV2.1 exclusivity during neuronal circuit maturation (Borst and Soria van Hoeve, 2012Borst J.G.

Here we show that CaV2.1 α1 subunit overexpression leads to larger presynaptic Ca2+ currents due to increases in CaV2.1 currents and CaV2.1 channel number, which results in increased Pr at both developmental stages. In addition, we found that CaV2.1 channels, and not CaV2.2 channels, were preferred at both developmental stages. Therefore, we propose a modified “slot” model in which AZs are not fully occupied by CaV2.1 during different states of neuronal circuit maturity and that CaV2.1 can compete with other CaV2 subtypes. This implies that CaV2.1 levels in the AZ can be increased to regulate neuronal circuit output. To test if slots in synapses within a native neuronal circuit prefer CaV2.1 or CaV2.2 and whether CaV2 slots exist in a saturated state, we overexpressed the mouse CaV2.1 and CaV2.2 α1 subunits at the P7 calyx of Held, a developmental time point at which the mouse calyx expresses a mixture of CaV2.1, CaV2.2, and CaV2.3 (∼60% CaV2.1), similar to many other CNS synapses (Iwasaki et al., 2000Iwasaki S.

Developmental changes in calcium channel types mediating synaptic transmission in rat auditory brainstem.J. Physiol. 1998; 509: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). We injected either HdAd CaV2.1 α1 or HdAd CaV2.2 α1 by utilizing the high-level overexpression cassette pUNISHER (Montesinos et al., 2011Montesinos M.S. Chen Z. Young Jr., S.M. pUNISHER: a high-level expression cassette for use with recombinant viral vectors for rapid and long term in vivo neuronal expression in the CNS.J. Neurophysiol. 2011; 106: 3230-3244Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) to drive CaV2 α1 expression, independent of an EGFP or myristoylated EGFP (mEGFP) reporter, into the cochlear nucleus (CN) of P1 mice (Figures 1A–1C; Table S1). Viral particle to infectious unit ratios (VP:IU) of HdAd CaV2.1 α1 or HdAd CaV2.2 α1 were similar, therefore ensuring that CaV2.1 α1 and CaV2.2 α1 expression in vivo is equivalent. Using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings at transduced or nontransduced P7 calyces, we measured the sensitivity of pharmacologically isolated Ca2+ currents (ICa) to the CaV2 subtype-specific blockers, ω-agatoxin IVA (Aga) (CaV2.1-selective) and ω-conotoxin GVIA (Cono) (CaV2.2-selective). All remaining Ca2+ currents (CaV2.3-mediated) were subsequently blocked with Cd2+ (nonspecific CaV2 channel blocker). Measurements of the maximum steady-state ICa amplitudes in the absence of CaV2 blockers revealed a significant increase in the total ICa in the CaV2.1 α1 overexpression (OE) calyces compared to control (1,916 ± 211 pA versus 868 ± 51 pA, n = 4, n = 5, p = 0.0328, Mood’s median test and post hoc Bonferroni test). However, this increase was absent in the CaV2.2 OE calyces (758 ± 132 pA, n = 6, p > 0.99, Mood’s median test and post hoc Bonferroni test). Analysis of the CaV2 subtype contributions revealed the ICa increase in the CaV2.1 α1 OE calyces was due to an ∼3-fold increase in the Aga-sensitive current (1,712 ± 272 pA versus 567 ± 66 pA, n = 4, n = 5, p = 0.0328, Mood’s median test and post hoc Bonferroni test). In addition, we found a 65% decrease in the Cono-sensitive current (59 ± 26 pA versus 172 ± 26 pA, n = 4, n = 5, p = 0.0054, Mood’s Median test and post hoc Bonferroni test) compared to control. Normalization of the Ca2+ currents revealed the contribution of CaV2.1 to ICa was strongly increased (91% ± 3.2% versus 65.2% ± 5.3%,) while the contribution of CaV2.2 (3% ± 1.5% versus 20.2% ± 3.1%) and CaV2.3 (4.7% ± 2.3% versus 14% ± 2.5%) were decreased (Figure 1I). In contrast, there were no changes in the toxin-sensitive fractions when overexpressing CaV2.2 α1. Since CaV2.2 activates at more positive voltages than CaV2.1 at the calyx (Inchauspe et al., 2004Inchauspe C.G. Martini F.J. Forsythe I.D. Uchitel O.D. Functional compensation of P/Q by N-type channels blocks short-term plasticity at the calyx of Held presynaptic terminal.J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 10379-10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), it was possible that we underestimated the ability of CaV2.2 to compete for CaV2.1 slots. To further characterize how CaV2.1 and CaV2.2 α1 OE influence ICa, we carried out current-voltage (IV) recordings (Figures 1J–1O). We switched to 1 mM external Ca2+ to minimize the potential influence of voltage clamp errors. Results of the IV relationships revealed that CaV2.1 α1 OE increased ICa compared to control while CaV2.2 α1 OE did not. The slow component of the cell capacitance (Cslow) in whole-cell configuration can be used as an estimate for the size of the presynaptic terminal. Since Cslow values were unchanged (Table S1), this indicates that ICa increases were not due to changes in calyx size. Fits of the presynaptic ICa revealed that CaV2.2 α1 OE did not change the voltage dependence of activation. In summary, these results demonstrate that CaV2.1 α1 OE leads to an increase in CaV2.1 currents which is paralleled by a reduction in CaV2.2 currents with no change in calyx size. Therefore, we conclude that presynaptic CaV2.1 current levels at the calyx of Held are not saturated and prefer CaV2.1 instead of CaV2.2. To determine if the increased presynaptic CaV2.1 currents correlated to changes in CaV2.1 channel numbers, we carried out SDS-digested freeze fracture replica immunogold labeling (SDS-FFRL) at calyces transduced with either HdAd CaV2.1 α1 OE mEGFP or untransduced calyces (Figure 2; Table S2). Since CaV2 channels predominantly exist as clusters in the AZ (Baur et al., 2015Baur D. Bornschein G. Althof D. Watanabe M. Kulik A. Eilers J. Schmidt H.

To do so, we used 30 nm radius circles extending from the center of each gold particle which accounts for CaV2 localization uncertainty (Althof et al., 2015Althof D. Baehrens D. Watanabe M. Suzuki N. Fakler B. Kulik Á. Inhibitory and excitatory axon terminals share a common nano-architecture of their Cav2.1 (P/Q-type) Ca(2+) channels.Front. Cell. Neurosci. 2015; 9: 315Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) to measure the cluster area, number of gold particles per cluster, and gold particle density in clusters. We found that CaV2.1 α1 OE resulted in a distribution shift to larger cluster areas which was evidenced by a mean increase in the cluster area (0.0122 ± 0.0004 μm2 versus 0.0091 ± 0.0003 μm2, p = 0.0006, Mann-Whitney U test), the number of gold particles per cluster (7.3 ± 0.3 versus 4.8 ± 0.2, p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test), and the gold particle density per μm2 cluster area (563.3 ± 4.2 versus 506.3 ± 4.6, p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test) (Figures 2B–2D). In addition, we found a decrease of inter-particle distance per cluster (Table S2) and that there was a decrease in the number of single gold particles not found in a cluster compared to control (4.8% versus 10.9%, p < 0.0001, Fisher’s exact test) (Figure 2E), indicating the increased number of CaV2.1 channels lead to a higher probability of CaV2.1 channels being in clusters. Finally, these changes were not due to mEGFP expression, as previous reports have demonstrated that mEGFP expression alone does not lead to increases in Cav2.1 numbers (Dong et al., 2018Dong W. Radulovic T. Goral R.O. Thomas C. Suarez Montesinos M. Guerrero-Given D. Hagiwara A. Putzke T. Hida Y.

Individual presynaptic AZs contain multiple CaV2 clusters in a nonrandom organization (Holderith et al., 2012Holderith N. Lorincz A. Katona G. Rózsa B. Kulik A. Watanabe M. Nusser Z. Release probability of hippocampal glutamatergic terminals scales with the size of the active zone.Nat.

Takahashi T. Nanoscale distribution of presynaptic Ca(2+) channels and its impact on vesicular release during development.Neuron. 2015; 85: 145-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Therefore, we wanted to determine if CaV2.1 α1 OE increased the number of CaV2.1 channels and clusters within the AZ. At the calyx, a 100 nm radius extending from the center of the gold particle is equivalent to the average putative AZ area (Dong et al., 2018Dong W. Radulovic T. Goral R.O. Thomas C. Suarez Montesinos M. Guerrero-Given D. Hagiwara A. Putzke T. Hida Y. Abe M. et al.CAST/ELKS proteins control voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel density and synaptic release probability at a mammalian central synapse.Cell Rep. 2018; 24: 284-293Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, we used a 100 nm radius from individual gold particles to measure the putative AZ area, the number of gold particles, particle density, and the 30 nm cluster distribution within the putative AZ (Figures 2F and 2G; Table S2). We found that CaV2.1 α1 OE increased the putative AZ area (0.153 ± 0.011 μm2 versus 0.105 ± 0.008 μm2, p = 0.0015, Mann-Whitney U test) and a corresponding increase gold particle density within the putative AZ (110.8 ± 2.6 versus 86.6 ± 2.2, p < 0.0001 Mann-Whitney U test). Subsequently, we counted the number of 30 nm clusters (>1 particle within 30 nm area) within the putative AZ. Our analysis revealed a shift towards putative AZs with increased cluster numbers (2.44 ± 0.17 versus 1.59 ± 0.14, p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U test; Figure 2G). Taken together, our results demonstrate that the increase in presynaptic CaV2.1 currents upon CaV2.1 α1 OE correlates with increased CaV2.1 numbers, density per cluster, and cluster numbers. Our SDS-FFRL data demonstrated that the putative AZ at the calyx increases in size with CaV2.1 α1 OE. However, the putative AZ area is based on CaV2.1 numbers and therefore an indirect measurement of AZ size. To directly measure the AZ length, we carried out ultrathin section TEM on the CaV2.1 α1 OE calyces and control (Figure 3; Table S2). The presynaptic AZ was defined as the membrane opposing the postsynaptic density (PSD) (Clarke et al., 2012Clarke G.L. Chen J. Nishimune H. Presynaptic active zone density during development and synaptic plasticity.Front. Mol. Neurosci. 2012; 5: 12Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We found no increase in AZ length compared to control (Figures 3B and 3C). Since CaV2.1 clusters are suggested to correlate to SV docking sites (Miki et al., 2017Miki T. Kaufmann W.A. Malagon G. Gomez L. Tabuchi K. Watanabe M. Shigemoto R. Marty A. Numbers of presynaptic Ca2+ channel clusters match those of functionally defined vesicular docking sites in single central synapses.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2017; 114: E5246-E5255PubMed Google Scholar), we measured the number of docked SV, defined as those within 5 nm of the plasma membrane (Taschenberger et al., 2002Taschenberger H. Leão R.M. Rowland K.C. Spirou G.A. von Gersdorff H. Optimizing synaptic architecture and efficiency for high-frequency transmission.Neuron. 2002; 36: 1127-1143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Analysis of SV distribution revealed no change in docked SV number or SV distribution (Figures 3D and 3E). Our data demonstrate that AZ length and SV docking do not change with an increase in CaV2.1 channel numbers at the AZ. Therefore, we conclude that the AZ area does not increase to accommodate more CaV2.1 channels. Although our ultrastructural data indicated there were no changes in AZ ultrastructure, it was possible that there were changes in SV volume that would not be apparent in the ultrathin section EM. Therefore, we recorded spontaneous AMPA-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSC) in medial nucleus of the trapezoid body (MNTB) principal cells innervated by transduced or non-transduced calyces (Figures 3F–3H). We found no change in the mEPSC amplitudes between the CaV2.1 α1 OE and control calyces (37.2 ± 1.6 pA versus 35.7 ± 1.9 pA, p = 0.56, two-tailed t test, n = 15), while there was an ∼2-fold increase in the mEPSC frequency (0.56 ± 0.1 Hz versus 0.92 ± 0.1 Hz, p = 0.04, two-tailed t test, n = 15). Since quantal amplitude was not increased, we conclude that CaV2.1 α1 OE does not lead to an increase in SV volume. The strength of neurotransmitter release in response to APs is positively correlated to CaV2 numbers within the AZ (Holderith et al., 2012Holderith N. Lorincz A. Katona G. Rózsa B. Kulik A.

In the 50 years since, the essay has influenced discussions ranging from climate change (see page 1217 ) to evolution, from infectious disease to the internet, and has reached far beyond academic literature—but not without criticism. Considerable work, notably by Nobelist Elinor Ostrom ( 2 ), has challenged Hardin, particularly his emphasis on property rights and government regulatory leviathans as solutions. Instead, research has documented contexts, cases, and principles that reflect the ability of groups to collectively govern common resources. To mark this anniversary and celebrate the richness of research and practice around commons and cooperation, Science invited experts to share some contemporary views on such tragedies and how to avert them. — Brad Wible"
https://openalex.org/W2904341463,"Honey bee (Apis mellifera) colonies invest a substantial amount of colony resources in the production of drones during the reproductive season to enable mating with virgin queens from nearby colonies. Recent studies have shown significant differences in the production of sperm cells that are viable (i.e., sperm viability) and can fertilize an ovule among sexually mature drones that are exposed to different environmental conditions during development or as adults. In particular, sperm viability may be negatively affected during drone development from exposure to pesticides in contaminated beeswax. To assess whether sperm viability is negatively affected during drone development from exposure to beeswax contaminated with in-hive pesticides, we compared the viability of sperm collected from drones reared in pesticide-free beeswax with that of drones reared in beeswax contaminated with field-relevant concentrations of the pesticides most commonly found in wax from commercial beekeeping operations in the United States. These pesticides include the miticides fluvalinate, coumaphos and amitraz, and the agro-chemicals chlorothalonil and chlorpyrifos. Sperm from drones collected at 10 and 18 days post emergence were classified as viable or non-viable to calculate sperm viability. For all pesticide treatment groups, drones that were reared in pesticide-laden beeswax had lower sperm viability compared to those reared in pesticide-free beeswax. This difference was especially pronounced among drones reared in miticide-laden wax. Our results reinforce the notion that pesticide contamination of beeswax negatively affects the reproductive quality of drones, which can affect the queens they mate with, ultimately compromising colony health."

In the SE the information available to assist individuals (users) in making decisions focuses predominantly on community generated trust and reputation information. However, how such information impacts user judgement is still being understood. To explore such effects, we constructed an artificial SE accommodation platform where we varied the elements related to hosts' digital identity, measuring users' perceptions and decisions to interact. Across three studies, we find that trust and reputation information increases not only the users' perceived trustworthiness, credibility, and sociability of hosts, but also the propensity to rent a private room in their home. This effect is seen when providing users both with complete profiles and profiles with partial user-selected information. Closer investigations reveal that three elements relating to the host's digital identity are sufficient to produce such positive perceptions and increased rental decisions, regardless of which three elements are presented. Our findings have relevant implications for human judgment and privacy in the SE, and question its current culture of ever increasing information-sharing."
https://openalex.org/W2905455819,"This study explores the genomic alterations that contribute to the formation of a unique subset of low-risk, epithelial differentiated, favorable histology Wilms tumors (WT), tumors that have been characterized by their expression of post-induction renal developmental genes (Subset 1 WT). We demonstrate copy neutral loss of heterozygosity involving 19q13.32-q13.43, unaccompanied by evidence for imprinting by DNA methylation. We further identified loss-of-function somatic mutations in TRIM28 (also known as KAP1), located at 19q13, in 8/9 Subset 1 tumors analyzed. An additional germline TRIM28 mutation was identified in one patient. Retrospective evaluation of previously analyzed WT outside of Subset 1 identified an additional tumor with anaplasia and both TRIM28 and TP53 mutations. A major function of TRIM28 is the repression of endogenous retroviruses early in development. We depleted TRIM28 in HEK293 cells, which resulted in increased expression of endogenous retroviruses, a finding also demonstrated in TRIM28-mutant WT. TRIM28 has been shown by others to be active during early renal development, and to interact with WTX, another gene recurrently mutated in WT. Our findings suggest that inactivation of TRIM28 early in renal development contributes to the formation of this unique subset of FHWTs, although the precise manner in which TRIM28 impacts both normal renal development and oncogenesis remains elusive."
https://openalex.org/W2904427385,"Return to work after acute myocardial infarction (AMI), a leading cause of death globally, is a multidimensional process influenced by clinical, psychological, social and occupational factors, the single impact of which, however, is still not well defined. The objective of this study was to investigate these 4 factors on return to work (RTW) within 365 days after AMI in a homogeneous cohort of patients who had undergone an urgent coronary angioplasty.We studied 102 patients, in employment at the time of AMI (88.24% of men), admitted to the Department of Cardiology of the University-Hospital of Ferrara between March 2015 to December 2016. Demographical and clinical characteristics were obtained from the cardiological records. After completing an interview on social and occupational variables and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HADS) questionnaire, patients underwent exercise capacity measurement and spirometry.Of the 102 patients, only 12 (12.76%) held a university degree, 68.63% were employees and 31.37% self-employed. The median number of sick-leave days was 44 (IQR 33-88). At day 30, 78.5% of all subjects had not returned to work, at day 60, 40.8% and at day 365 only 7.3% had not resumed working. At univariate analyses, educational degree (p = 0.026), self-employment status (p = 0.0005), white collar professional category (p = 0.020) and HADS depression score were significant for earlier return to work. The multivariate analysis confirms that having a university degree, being self-employed and presenting a lower value of HADS depression score increase the probability of a quicker return to work.These findings suggest that the strongest predictors of returning to work within 1 year after discharge for an acute myocardial infarction are related more to socio-occupational than to clinical parameters."
https://openalex.org/W2905339048,"Today's students have increased expectations for flexible learning options and evidence-based practice resources to be available to support curricular activities. We investigated: (i) the suitability of a static website for teaching ocular anatomy and physiology and an interactive version of the website with quiz and self-assessment activities and (ii) the usefulness of a blended online and in-lab environment to teach in Optometry. We administered a survey to compare responses of optometry students who had access to the interactive website, with those from students from a previous year who used the static version. We examined learning preferences of students in a focus group. Students were positive about the value of the website for their learning and the clarity of the website content. Nevertheless, objective comparison of pass rates for students using the static and interactive websites did not show significant changes. The majority of students commenting on the static website felt they did not get sufficient feedback via the website (67%) compared with only 22% from students who used self-assessments in the interactive website. Interestingly, users of the static website commented that it was perceived as just another resource while users of the interactive website commented on the usefulness of the material to review knowledge before laboratories. In the focus group, students reported they preferred a blended learning over the website alone even by students using the interactive website as they felt the need to revise content with the educator before the test. We conclude that there is acceptance of online learning methods due to the technologically 'savvy' environment of students in the first year of the Optometry programme but there is still dependence on the educator as the main administrator of their learning."
https://openalex.org/W2904563716,"Are mathematical learning difficulties caused by impairment of the abilities that underlie mathematical talent? Or are mathematical difficulties and talent qualitatively different? The main goal of this study was to determine whether mathematical learning difficulties are explained by the same executive functions as mathematical talent. We screened a pool of 2,682 first-year high school students and selected 48 for evaluation, dividing them into three groups: those with mathematical learning difficulties (n = 16), those with typical performance (n = 16), and those with mathematical talent (n = 16). Adolescents from the learning difficulties and talented groups had age, reading skills, and verbal and non-verbal intelligence that were similar to those of the typical performance group. Participants were administered a suite of tasks to evaluate verbal and visual short-term memory and executive functions of inhibition, shifting, and updating. Different executive functions showed different contributions at the two ends of the math ability continuum: lower levels of performance in updating visual information were related to mathematical learning difficulties, while greater shifting abilities were related to mathematical talent. Effect sizes for the differences in performance between groups were large (Hedges' g > 0.8). These results suggest that different executive functions are associated with mathematical learning difficulties and mathematical talent.

We describe the uptake of each component of the CDC/WHO recommended package of linkage services, and early enrollment in HIV care and antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation among persons with HIV who participated in a peer-delivered, linkage case management (LCM) program implemented in Bukoba, Tanzania, October 2014 –May 2017. Of 4206 participants (88% newly HIV diagnosed), most received recommended services including counseling on the importance of early enrollment in care and ART (100%); escort by foot or car to an HIV care and treatment clinic (CTC) (83%); treatment navigation at a CTC (94%); telephone support and appointment reminders (77% among clients with cellphones); and counseling on HIV-status disclosure and partner/family testing (77%), and on barriers to care (69%). During three periods with different ART-eligibility thresholds [CD4<350 (Oct 2014 –Dec 2015, n = 2233), CD4≤500 (Jan 2016 –Sept 2016, n = 1221), and Test & Start (Oct 2016 –May 2017, n = 752)], 90%, 96%, and 97% of clients enrolled in HIV care, and 47%, 67%, and 86% of clients initiated ART, respectively, within three months of diagnosis. Of 463 LCM clients who participated in the last three months of the rollout of Test & Start, 91% initiated ART. Estimated per-client cost was $44 United States dollars (USD) for delivering LCM services in communities and facilities overall, and $18 USD for a facility-only model with task shifting. Well accepted by persons with HIV, peer-delivered LCM services recommended by CDC and WHO can achieve near universal early ART initiation in the Test & Start era at modest cost and should be considered for implementation in facilities and communities experiencing <90% early enrollment in ART care."
https://openalex.org/W2904997198,"A bioactive lipid, sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), acts extracellularly as a potent mediator, and is implicated in the progression of various cancers including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). S1P exerts its functions by binding to five types of specific receptors, S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1), S1PR2, S1PR3, S1PR4 and S1PR5 on the plasma membrane. However, the exact roles of S1P and each S1PR in HCC cells remain to be clarified. In the present study, we investigated the effect of S1P on the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)-induced migration of human HCC-derived HuH7 cells, and the involvement of each S1PR. S1P dose-dependently reduced the HGF-induced migration of HuH7 cells. We found that all S1PRs exist in the HuH7 cells. Among each selective agonist for five S1PRs, CYM5520, a selective S1PR2 agonist, significantly suppressed the HGF-induced HuH7 cell migration whereas selective agonists for S1PR1, S1PR3, S1PR4 or S1PR5 failed to affect the migration. The reduction of the HGF-induced migration by S1P was markedly reversed by treatment of JTE013, a selective antagonist for S1PR2, and S1PR2- siRNA. These results strongly suggest that S1P reduces the HGF-induced HCC cell migration via S1PR2. Our findings may provide a novel potential of S1PR2 to therapeutic strategy for metastasis of HCC."
https://openalex.org/W2905477811,"In Malawi's PMTCT Option B+ program, HIV-infected pregnant women who are already receiving ART are continued on their current therapy regimen without testing for treatment failure at the first antenatal care (ANC) visit. HIV RNA screening at ANC may identify women with treatment failure and ensure that viral suppression is maintained throughout the pregnancy.We conducted a cross-sectional study of HIV-infected pregnant women who had been receiving ART for at least 6 months at the first ANC visit under the PMTCT Option B+ program at Bwaila Hospital in Lilongwe, Malawi from June 2015 to December 2017. Poisson regression models with robust variance were used to investigate the predictors of ART treatment failure defined as viral load ≥1000 copies/ml.The median age of 864 women tested for ART failure was 31.1 years (interquartile range: 26.9-34.5). The prevalence of treatment failure was 7.6% (95% confidence interval (CI): 6.0-9.6). CD4 cell count (adjusted prevalence ratio (aPR) = 0.57; 95% CI: 0.50-0.65) was strongly associated with treatment failure.The low prevalence of treatment failure among women presenting for their first ANC in urban Malawi demonstrates success of Option B+ in maintaining viral suppression and suggests progress towards the last 90% of the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets. Women failing on ART should be identified early for adherence counseling and may require switching to an alternative ART regimen."
https://openalex.org/W2904421627,"Cholinergic Receptor Nicotinic Alpha 5 (CHRNA5) is an important susceptibility locus for nicotine addiction and lung cancer. Depletion of CHRNA5 has been associated with reduced cell viability, increased apoptosis and alterations in cellular motility in different cancers yet not in breast cancer. Herein we first showed the expression of CHRNA5 was variable and positively correlated with the fraction of total genomic alterations in breast cancer cell lines and tumors indicating its potential role in DNA damage response (DDR). Next, we demonstrated that silencing of CHRNA5 expression in MCF7 breast cancer cell line by RNAi affected expression of genes involved in cytoskeleton, TP53 signaling, DNA synthesis and repair, cell cycle, and apoptosis. The transcription profile of CHRNA5 depleted MCF7 cells showed a significant positive correlation with that of A549 lung cancer cell line while exhibiting a negative association with the CHRNA5 co-expression profile obtained from Cancer Cell Line Encylopedia (CCLE). Moreover, it exhibited high similarities with published MCF7 expression profiles obtained from exposure to TP53 inducer nutlin-3a and topoisomerase inhibitors. We then demonstrated that CHRNA5 siRNA treatment reduced cell viability and DNA synthesis indicating G1 arrest while it significantly increased apoptotic sub-G1 cell population. Accordingly, we observed lower levels of phosphorylated RB (Ser807/811) and an increased BAX/BCL2 ratio in RNAi treated MCF7 cells. We also showed that CHRNA5 RNAi transcriptome correlated negatively with DDR relevant gene expression profile in breast cancer gene expression datasets while the coexposure to topoisomerase inhibitors in the presence of CHRNA5 RNAi enhanced chemosensitivity potentially due to reduced DDR. CHRNA5 RNAi consistently lowered total CHEK1 mRNA and protein levels as well as phosphorylated CHEK1 (Ser345) in MCF7 cells. We also detected a significant positive correlation between the expression levels of CHRNA5 and CHEK1 in CCLE, TCGA and METABRIC breast cancer datasets. Our study suggests CHRNA5 RNAi is associated with cell cycle inhibition, apoptosis as well as reduced DDR and increased drug sensitivity in breast cancer yet future studies are warranted since dose- and cell line-specific differences exist in response to CHRNA5 depletion. Gene expression microarray data can be accessed from GEO database under the accession number GSE89333."
https://openalex.org/W2903629090,"Honeybee colonies are increasingly exposed to environmental stress factors, which can lead to their decline or failure. However, there are major gaps in stressor risk assessment due to the difficulty of assessing the honeybee colony state and detecting abnormal events. Since stress factors usually induce a demographic disturbance in the colony (e.g. loss of foragers, early transition from nurse to forager state), we suggest that disturbances could be revealed indirectly by measuring the age- and task-related physiological state of bees, which can be referred to as biological age (an indicator of the changes in physiological state that occur throughout an individual lifespan). We therefore estimated the biological age of bees from the relationship between age and biomarkers of task specialization (vitellogenin and the adipokinetic hormone receptor). This relationship was determined from a calibrated sample set of known-age bees and mathematically modelled for biological age prediction. Then, we determined throughout the foraging season the evolution of the biological age of bees from colonies with low (conventional apiary) or high Varroa destructor infestation rates (organic apiary). We found that the biological age of bees from the conventional apiary progressively decreased from the spring (17 days) to the fall (6 days). However, in colonies from the organic apiary, the population aged from spring (13 days) to summer (18.5 days) and then rejuvenated in the fall (13 days) after Varroa treatment. Biological age was positively correlated with the amount of brood (open and closed cells) in the apiary with low Varroa pressure, and negatively correlated with Varroa infestation level in the apiary with high Varroa pressure. Altogether, these results show that the estimation of biological age is a useful and effective method for assessing colony demographic state and likely detrimental effects of stress factors."
https://openalex.org/W2904429495,"Modelling of internal migration to new cities is challenging, yet necessary to ensure that these newly established urban areas will be populated and function as intended. In the State of Kuwait, there is a unique set of push and pull factors: government subsidised housing for citizens, the existence of a single urban area, and the initiation of a new and ambitious master plan for the construction of 12 new cities, which are expected to attract not only locals, but also international residents and businesses. On top of these factors, there is an unusual demographic situation, as non-citizens outnumber Kuwaiti citizens by a factor of 2.3, with these groups having widely different preferences in terms of housing. Currently, there is no plan to take these resident groups’ opinions into consideration for the new cities project. Besides, the current study simulates the impacts of the involvement of residents in urban planning. Samples from resident groups (citizens and non-citizens) participated in targeted surveys and useful answers were extracted in relation to the migration likelihood, push and pull factors that may affect their decisions, spatial preferences for new cities and their opinions on segregation by nationality. Specifically, the survey results showed significant interest of residents in moving to the new cities. For citizens, the most important factors in deciding whether to move or not were proximity to their close family and housing availability, while for non-citizens the most important factor was the creation of new employment opportunities. Both survey groups agreed that existing city property prices are too high and make the prospect of moving to a new city more attractive. The responses were transferred in an Agent Based Model, and the simulations showed certain differences to the official projections for 2050 without the public responses, in regards to the geographical distribution of the most desirable suburbs. Furthermore, the simulations showed that in the new cities, nationality segregation levels are expected to drop by at least 15% compared to the 2015 levels. The findings may be utilised by the authorities to modify the master plan accordingly."
https://openalex.org/W2904256744,"Azotobacter vinelandii is a nitrogen-fixing bacterium of the Pseudomonadaceae family that prefers the use of organic acids rather than carbohydrates. Thus, in a mixture of acetate-glucose, glucose is consumed only after acetate is exhausted. In a previous work, we investigated the molecular basis of this carbon catabolite repression (CCR) process under diazotrophic conditions. In the presence of acetate, Crc-Hfq inhibited translation of the gluP mRNA, encoding the glucose transporter in A. vinelandii. Herein, we investigated the regulation in the expression of the small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) crcZ and crcY, which are known to antagonize the repressing activity of Hfq-Crc. Our results indicated higher expression levels of the sRNAs crcZ and crcY under low CCR conditions (i.e. glucose), in relation to the strong one (acetate one). In addition, we also explored the process of CCR in the presence of ammonium. Our results revealed that CCR also occurs under non-diazotrophic conditions as we detected a hierarchy in the utilization of the supplied carbon sources, which was consistent with the higher expression level of the crcZ/Y sRNAs during glucose catabolism. Analysis of the promoters driving transcription of crcZ and crcY confirmed that they were RpoN-dependent but we also detected a processed form of CrcZ (CrcZ*) in the RpoN-deficient strain derived from a cbrB-crcZ co-transcript. CrcZ* was functional and sufficient to allow the assimilation of acetate."

Methods Survey data including maternal dietary patterns derived from food frequency questionnaire data using principal component analysis (PCA) were compared by maternal age using one-way ANOVA and chi-squared as appropriate. Main outcome measures Dietary pattern PCA scores, supplement use, familiarity and compliance with 5-a-day fruit and vegetable recommendations, consumption of cola, maternal BMI. Results Three distinct dietary patterns were derived from the data; snack and processed foods, meat and fish and grains and starches. Mean PCA score for snack and processed foods was higher among women aged ≤19 (0.6, CI 0.4 to 0.8) than women aged 20–34 (-0.02, CI -0.1 to 0.01) and those aged 35≥ (-0.3, CI -0.4 to -0.2). Women aged 35≥ had a significantly higher mean PCA score for the grains and starches dietary pattern (0.1, CI 0.03 to 0.3) compared to both the 20–34 years (-0.01, CI -0.05 to 0.02) and the ≤19 (-0.04, CI -0.2 to 0.1) groups. No differences were observed between groups in mean PCA scores for the meat and fish dietary pattern. Adolescent women also had higher intakes of sugar sweetened cola (0.9 cups per day, CI 0.7 to 1.1) and reported lower levels of fruit and vegetable and supplement intake. Women aged 35≥ had a higher mean BMI (28.0, CI 27.5 to 28.4) and higher prevalence of overweight (36.8%) and obesity (29.6%, p<0.001). Conclusions Significant differences were observed between age groups both in terms of diet quality and BMI. Interventions targeted by age group may be advantageous in improving maternal nutrition and contribute to healthy pregnancies."

RT-PCR is performed to detect the expression levels of AS3MT, 3 miRNAs, and 17 relative mRNAs in 43 workers producing arsenic trioxide, 36 workers who stopped exposure to arsenic for 85 days, and 24 individuals as the control group. The concentrations of urinary arsenic are very high in workers. A negative correlation between AS3MT and MiR-548c-3p is found. There exist significant changes for most selected miRNAs and mRNAs in workers. There are no significant differences between workers who stopped exposure to arsenic and the control group for most miRNAs and mRNAs, but the MiR-548c-3p levels show significant changes. Similar positive correlations between the expression of AS3MT and all selected mRNAs are found. Negative correlations between the expression of MiR-548c-3p and many relative mRNAs are found as well. AS3MT and MiR-548c-3p may regulate arsenic methylation jointly, which when involved in a group of relative mRNAs may play roles in arsenic metabolism and epigenetic changes caused by this metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2905158896,"Development and implementation of rapid antimicrobial susceptibility testing is critical for guiding patient care and improving clinical outcomes, especially in cases of sepsis. One approach to reduce the time-to-answer for antimicrobial susceptibility is monitoring the inhibition of DNA production, as differences in DNA concentrations are more quickly impacted compared to optical density changes in traditional antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Here, we use real-time PCR to rapidly determine antimicrobial susceptibility after short incubations with antibiotic. Application of this assay to a collection of 144 isolates in mock blood culture, covering medically relevant pathogens displaying high rates of resistance, provided susceptibility data in under 4 hours. This assay provided categorical agreement with a reference method in 96.3% of cases across all species. Sequencing of a subset of PCR amplicons showed accurate genus level identification. Overall, implementation of this method could provide accurate susceptibility results with a reduced time-to-answer for a number of medically relevant bacteria commonly isolated from blood culture."
https://openalex.org/W2905240707,"Private-sector investors could be key players in combatting global land degradation and realising the emerging concept of Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN). To better understand how to incentivize private-sector investors for LDN, we conducted an online-survey of 68 private-sector investors. Structural equation modelling based on the theory of planned behavior was performed to investigate how cognitive, social, emotional, motivational and financial determinants influence their intention and motivation to invest in LDN. Good knowledge and a positive attitude towards both LDN and investing sustainably were found to be main predictors for intention. In contrast, perceived social pressure had little effect on the intention to invest towards combating land degradation. The general motivation to invest sustainably was mainly triggered by a consciousness for sustainability and emotional attachment, less by the desire for short-term profit maximisation whilst prospects of long-term financial return are important. Overall, strong homogeneity in psychological determinants was found for both traditional and impact investors. As the determinants of the intention and the motivation to invest sustainably do not substantially differ across different investor types, our study implies that investors should be targeted as a uniform group when mobilising interest for LDN. Emphasis should be placed on the psychological determinants traditional and impact investors commonly share, rather than on the type-specific characteristics that may distinguish different investor types."

Recombinant proteins have been widely investigated for diagnosis, achieving high sensitivity and specificity in an overall population; however, little is known about age as a factor in its application. This study aims to investigate the diagnostic potential of Toxocara canis TES-30 and TES-120 recombinant proteins in humans, differentiating between its performance in children and adults. Serum samples collected from children and adults seropositive to Toxocara spp. were tested with indirect ELISA using T. canis TES-30 and TES-120 recombinant proteins produced in Escherichia coli. While rTES-30 sensitivity was not affected by age (81.8% in children and 87% in adults), rTES-120 sensitivity severely decreased in children to only 63.6%, down from 95.7% in adults. Furthermore, the sensitivity of rTES-30 increased to 97.8% after Western blotting confirmation. High specificity (>94%) against other geohelminths was reported for both recombinant proteins. Our study favors the use of rTES-30 with total IgG as the primary antibody in an indirect ELISA assay as a tool for epidemiological human studies."
https://openalex.org/W2905510200,"Background A biphasic, U-shape relationship has been reported between body mass index (BMI) and clinical outcomes following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, the relationship between waist circumference (WC) and the cardiovascular risk following PCI has not been reported. Methods A prospective cohort study was performed. A major adverse cardiac event (MACE) was defined as a composite of cardiac death (CD), nonfatal myocardial infarction (NFMI) and target vessel revascularization (TVR). Patients were evenly divided into 4 groups according to BMI (Q1BMI, Q2BMI, Q3BMI and Q4BMI) and WC (Q1WC, Q2WC, Q3WC and Q4WC). Results A total of 1,421 patients were observed for 5 years. The risk of the composite events of CD and NFMI (CD/NFMI) was lower in the Q3WC and Q4WC groups than in the Q1WC group, whereas it was only marginally lower in the Q2BMI group than in the Q1BMI group (ANOVA, p = 0.062). The risk of MACE was highest in the Q1WC group and lowest in the Q3WC group; however, the risk of MACE did not differ among the 4 groups, according to BMI. Multivariate Cox-regression analyses showed that the risk of CD/NFMI gradually decreased with BMI (linear p = 0.030) and with WC (linear p = 0.015). The risks of TVR and MACEs that were driven by TVRs showed a distinguishing biphasic, U-shaped relationship with WC (nonlinear p = 0.009) but not with BMI (nonlinear p = 0.439). Landmark survival analysis showed that the incidences of CD and NFMI were higher in the lower BMI groups and lower WC groups than in the higher BMI groups and higher WC groups, respectively, until 1 year and did not differ afterward. In contrast, the incidence of MACE was highest in Q1WC and lowest in Q3WC (log-rank p = 0.003), whereas the incidence was not different among the groups according to BMI. Conclusions Both BMI and WC were associated with a lower risk of early episodes of CD and NFMI after PCI. In the late period after PCI, WC demonstrated a biphasic, U-shaped association between cardiovascular outcomes and adiposity, whereas BMI did not."
https://openalex.org/W2903998747,"Background An increasing number of people are living with multiple chronic conditions and it is unclear which quality indicators should be used to guide care for this population. Objective To critically appraise and select the most appropriate set of quality indicators for ambulatory care for older adults with five selected disease combinations. Methods A two-round web-based Delphi process was used to critically appraise and select quality of care indicators for older adults with diabetes and comorbidities. A fifteen-member Canadian expert panel with broad geographical and clinical representation participated in this study. The panel evaluated process indicators for meaningfulness, potential for improvements in clinical practice, and overall value of inclusion, while outcome indicators were evaluated for importance, modifiability and overall value of inclusion. A 70% agreement threshold was required for high consensus, and 60–69% for moderate consensus as measured on a 5-point Likert type scale. Results Twenty high-consensus and nineteen medium-consensus process and outcome indicators were selected for assessing care for older adults with selected disease combinations, including 1) concordant (conditions with a common management plan), 2) discordant (conditions with unrelated management plans), and 3) both types. Panelists reached rapid consensus on quality indicators for care for older adults with concordant comorbid conditions, but not for those with discordant conditions. All selected indicators assess clinical aspects of care. The feedback from the panelists emphasized the importance of developing indicators related to patient-centred aspects of care, including patient self-management, education, patient-physician relationships, and patient’s preferences. Conclusions The selected quality indicators are not intended to provide a comprehensive tool set for measuring quality of care for older adults with selected disease combinations. The recommended indicators address clinical aspects of care and can be used as a starting point for ambulatory care settings and development of additional quality indicators."
https://openalex.org/W2905390180,"Calcium (Ca2+) is an important ion in physiology and is found both outside and inside cells. The intracellular concentration of Ca2+ is tightly regulated as it is an intracellular signal molecule and can affect a variety of cellular processes. In immune cells Ca2+ has been shown to regulate e.g. gene transcription, cytokine secretion, proliferation and migration. Ca2+ can enter the cytoplasm either from intracellular stores or from outside the cells when Ca2+ permeable ion channels in the plasma membrane open. The Ca2+ release-activated (CRAC) channel is the most prominent Ca2+ ion channel in the plasma membrane. It is formed by ORAI1-3 and the channel is opened by the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ sensor proteins stromal interaction molecules (STIM) 1 and 2. Another group of Ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane are the voltage-gated Ca2+ (CaV) channels. We examined if a change in immunological tolerance is accompanied by altered ORAI, STIM and CaV gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in pregnant women and in type 1 diabetic individuals. Our results show that in pregnancy and type 1 diabetes ORAI1-3 are up-regulated whereas STIM1 and 2 are down-regulated in pregnancy but only STIM2 in type 1 diabetes. Expression of L-, P/Q-, R- and T-type voltage-gated Ca2+ channels was detected in the PBMCs where the CaV2.3 gene was up-regulated in pregnancy and type 1 diabetes whereas the CaV 2.1 and CaV3.2 genes were up-regulated only in pregnancy and the CaV1.3 gene in type 1 diabetes. The results are consistent with that expression of ORAI, STIM and CaV genes correlate with a shift in immunological status of the individual in health, as during pregnancy, and in the autoimmune disease type 1 diabetes. Whether the changes are in general protective or in type 1 diabetes include some pathogenic components remains to be clarified."
https://openalex.org/W2905401198,"Objectives To assess variations in management of severe postpartum hemorrhage: 1) between obstetricians in the same situation 2) by the same obstetrician in different situations. Study design A link to a vignette-based survey was emailed to obstetricians of 215 maternity units; the questionnaire asked them to report how they would manage the PPH described in 2 previously validated case-vignettes of different scenarios of severe PPH. Vignette 1 described a typical immediate, severe PPH, and vignette 2 a less typical case of severe but gradual PPH. They were constructed in 3 successive steps and included multiple-choice questions proposing several types of clinical practice options at each step. Variations in PPH were assessed in a descriptive analysis; agreement about management and its timing between vignette 1 and vignette 2 was assessed with the Kappa coefficient. Results Analysis of complete responses from 119 (43.4%) obstetricians from 53 (24.6%) maternity units showed delayed or inadequate management in both vignettes. While 82.3% and 83.2% of obstetricians (in vignettes 1 and 2, respectively) would administer oxytocin 15 minutes after PPH diagnosis, only 52.9% and 29.4% would alert other team members. Management by obstetricians of the two vignette situations was inconsistent in terms of choice of treatment and timing of almost all treatments. Conclusion Case vignettes demonstrated inadequate management as well as variations in management between obstetricians and in different PPH situations. Protocols or procedures are necessary in all maternity units to reduce the variations in practices that may explain a part of the delay in management that leads to PPH-related maternal mortality and morbidity."

However, the nature of cognitive modification in patients with PD remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we examined whether patients with PD could correct and maintain subjective time duration and line length estimation. After training sessions, in which participants repeatedly memorized either a duration or a length, we compared a learning performance in 20 PD patients with 20 healthy controls. In the case of duration in the PD patients, the learned durations immediately returned to baseline of pre-training within a few minutes. However, the patients’ ability to learn length estimation remained unimpaired. In contrast, healthy controls were able to retain the learned duration and length estimations. Time compression in PD's internal clock may become entrained to their altered duration estimation even after learning of accurate time duration. These deficits may be associated with disrupting cognitive modification in PD."
https://openalex.org/W2904608733,"It is well-established that experiences of discrimination influence immigrants’ acculturation. Yet, whereas a large body of research has demonstrated the role of discrimination by members of the dominant societal group, surprisingly little is known about how being discriminated by members of one’s own group relates to the way immigrants acculturate. With a sample of 162 African first- and second-generation immigrants living in Norway, the present research investigated the relationship between both types of discrimination, acculturation and psychological well-being. It did so, focusing on discrimination based on one’s skin tone, a type of discrimination Africans can experience from White as well as African individuals. Results showed that skin-tone discrimination by Whites was associated with a lower host culture orientation. By contrast, skin-tone discrimination by Africans was associated with a lower heritage culture orientation. Mediation analyses showed that the positive relationship of skin-tone discrimination by Whites and Africans with life satisfaction was mediated by a lower host and heritage culture orientation respectively. This indirect relationship did not reach significance with self-esteem as dependent variable. Participants’ actual skin tone was unrelated to experiences of skin-tone discrimination. We discuss our results in light of previous research and highlight potential limitations."
https://openalex.org/W2904770012,"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups (hgs) are evolutionarily conserved sets of mtDNA SNP-haplotypes with characteristic geographical distribution. Associations of hgs with disease and physiological characteristics have been reported, but have frequently not been reproducible. Using 418 mtDNA SNPs on the PsychChip (Illumina), we assessed the spatio-temporal distribution of mtDNA hgs in Denmark from DNA isolated from 24,642 geographically un-biased dried blood spots (DBS), collected from 1981 to 2005 through the Danish National Neonatal Screening program. ADMIXTURE was used to establish the genomic ancestry of all samples using a reference of 100K+ autosomal SNPs in 2,248 individuals from nine populations. Median-joining analysis determined that the hgs were highly variable, despite being typically Northern European in origin, suggesting multiple founder events. Furthermore, considerable heterogeneity and variation in nuclear genomic ancestry was observed. Thus, individuals with hg H exhibited 95%, and U hgs 38.2% - 92.5%, Danish ancestry. Significant clines between geographical regions and rural and metropolitan populations were found. Over 25 years, macro-hg L increased from 0.2% to 1.2% (p = 1.1*E-10), and M from 1% to 2.4% (p = 3.7*E-8). Hg U increased among the R macro-hg from 14.1% to 16.5% (p = 1.9*E-3). Genomic ancestry, geographical skewedness, and sub-hg distribution suggested that the L, M and U increases are due to immigration. The complex spatio-temporal dynamics and genomic ancestry of mtDNA in the Danish population reflect repeated migratory events and, in later years, net immigration. Such complexity may explain the often contradictory and population-specific reports of mito-genomic association with disease."
https://openalex.org/W2903672731,"Objective To identify the specific domains of the presynaptic protein synapsin targeted by recently described autoantibodies to synapsin. Methods Sera of 20 and CSF of two patients with different psychiatric and neurological disorders previously tested positive for immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibodies to full-length synapsin were screened for IgG against synapsin I domains using HEK293 cells transfected with constructs encoding different domains of rat synapsin Ia. Additionally, IgG subclasses were determined using full-length synapsin Ia. Serum and CSF from one patient were also screened for IgA autoantibodies to synapsin I domains. Sera from nine and CSF from two healthy subjects were analyzed as controls. Results IgG in serum from 12 of 20 IgG synapsin full-length positive patients, but from none of the healthy controls, bound to synapsin domains. Of these 12 sera, six bound to the A domain, five to the D domain, and one to the B- (and possibly A-), D-, and E-domains of synapsin I. IgG antibodies to the D-domain were also detected in one of the CSF samples. Determination of IgG subclasses detected IgG1 in two sera and one CSF, IgG2 in none of the samples, IgG3 in two sera, and IgG4 in eight sera. One patient known to be positive for IgA antibodies to full-length synapsin had IgA antibodies to the D-domain in serum and CSF. Conclusions Anti-synapsin autoantibodies preferentially bind to either the A- or the D-domain of synapsin I."

Poisson regression was used to compare rates of vitamin D prescribing across years (risk ratio (RR), 95% CI).There was a statistically significant increase in women with a claim for vitamin D between 2005-2011, with the largest increase among breast cancer patients aged ≥ 55 years (RR = 2.26; 95% CI, 2.11-2.42).This may have significant public health implications if associations between vitamin D and improved breast cancer survival prove to be causal."
https://openalex.org/W2904688470,"Background Aedes japonicus was first documented in Ontario, Canada, in 2001. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of Ae. japonicus establishment on the abundance of other mosquitoes in the Greater Golden Horseshoe (GGH) region of Ontario. Methods Adult mosquito data from the Ontario West Nile virus surveillance program were used. Descriptive analyses, linear trends and distribution maps of average trap count per month for six mosquito species of interest were produced. Multivariable negative binomial regression models were constructed to 1) test whether the invasion of Ae. japonicus affected the abundance of other mosquitoes by comparing the time period before Ae. japonicus was identified in an area (pre-detection), to after it was first identified (detection), and subsequently (establishment), and 2) identify the variables that explain the abundance of the various mosquito species. Results The monthly seasonal average (May–October) of Ae. japonicus per trap night increased from 2002 to 2016, peaking in September, when the average of most other mosquitoes decrease. There were increased numbers of Ae. triseriatus/hendersoni (Odds Ratio (OR): 1.40, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.02–1.94) and decreased numbers of Coquillettidia perturbans (OR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.26–0.73) in the detection period, compared to the pre-detection period. Additionally, there was a decrease in Cx. pipiens/restuans (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.76–0.99) and Cq. perturbans (OR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.49–0.94) in the establishment period, compared to the pre-detection period. None of the most parsimonious explanatory models included the period of the establishment of Ae. japonicus. Conclusions There is no evidence that the introduction of Ae. japonicus significantly reduced populations of Ae. triseriatus/hendersoni, Cx. pipiens/restuans or An. punctipennis in the GGH. While further research is needed to understand the impact of the Ae. japonicus invasion on other mosquito species, our work indicates that, on a regional scale, little impact has been noted."
https://openalex.org/W2903729552,"The estimation of the Sample Size Requirement (SSR) when using a binary composite endpoint (i.e. two or more outcomes combined in a unique primary endpoint) is not trivial. Besides information about the rate of events for each outcome, information about the strength of association between the outcomes is crucial, since it can determine an increase or decrease of the SSR. Specifically, the greater the strength of association between outcomes the higher the SSR. We present Bin-CE, a free tool to assist clinicians for computing the SSR for binary composite endpoints. In a first step, the user enters a set of candidate outcomes, the assumed rate of events for each outcome and the assumed effect of therapy on each outcome. Since the strength of the association between outcomes is usually unknown, a semi-parametric approach linking the a priori clinical knowledge of the potential degree of association between outcomes with the exact values of these parameters was programmed with Bin-CE. Bin-CE works with a recursive algorithm to choose the best combination of outcomes that minimizes the SSR. In addition, Bin-CE computes the sample size using different algorithms and shows different figures plotting the magnitude of the sample size reduction, and the effect of different combinations of outcomes on the rate of the primary endpoint. Finally, Bin-CE is programmed to perform sensitivity analyses. This manuscript presents the mathematic bases and introduces the reader to the use of Bin-CE using a real example."
https://openalex.org/W2904606194,"The guinea pig has been used as a model to study various human infectious diseases because of its similarity to humans regarding symptoms and immune response, but little is known about the humoral immune response. To better understand the mechanism underlying the generation of the antibody repertoire in guinea pigs, we performed deep sequencing of full-length immunoglobulin variable chains from naïve B and plasma cells. We gathered and analyzed nearly 16,000 full-length VH, Vκ and Vλ genes and analyzed V and J gene segment usage profiles and mutation statuses by annotating recently reported genome data of guinea pig immunoglobulin genes. We found that approximately 70% of heavy, 73% of kappa and 81% of lambda functional germline V gene segments are integrated into the actual V(D)J recombination events. We also found preferential use of a particular V gene segment and accumulated mutation in CDRs 1 and 2 in antigen-specific plasma cells. Our study represents the first attempt to characterize sequence diversity in the expressed guinea pig antibody repertoire and provides significant insight into antibody repertoire generation and Ig-based immunity of guinea pigs."
https://openalex.org/W2905176486,"Background Achieving good medication adherence is a major challenge for patients with chronic conditions. Our study aimed to assess the Threshold for Unacceptable Risk of Non-adherence (TURN), defined as the threshold at which physicians consider the health risks incurred by patients due to medication non-adherence unacceptable, for the most commonly prescribed drugs in France. Methods We conducted an online study using a crowdsourcing approach among French general practitioners and specialists from September 2016 to August 2017. Physicians assessed the TURN for various levels of missed doses by evaluating a series of randomly presented clinical vignettes, each presenting a given medication with a given therapeutic indication. For each “drug-indication group” (i.e., all drugs from the same pharmacological class with a similar therapeutic indication): 1) we described the distribution of physicians’ assessments, 2) we provided a summary estimate of the TURN, defined as the frequency of missed doses above which 75% of the physicians’ assessments were located; 3) we computed the number of pill boxes reimbursed in France in 2016 to put our results into context. Results We collected a total of 5365 assessments from 544 physicians, each of whom evaluated a random sample among 528 distinct clinical vignettes. Estimates of the TURN varied widely across drug-indication groups, ranging from risk considered unacceptable with 1 daily dose missed per month (e.g., insulin for diabetes) to risk always considered acceptable (e.g., anti-dementia drugs). Drugs with an estimated TURN of over one missing daily dose per week represented 44.9% of the prescription volume of the medications assessed in our study. Conclusions According to physicians, the impact of non-adherence may vary greatly. Patient-physician discussions on the variable consequences of non-adherence could lead to a paradigm shift by seeking to reach “optimal adherence” depending on drugs rather than unrealistic “perfect adherence” to all drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2810393059,"In most Eukaryotes, ubiquitin either exists as free monoubiquitin or as a molecule that is covalently linked to other proteins. These two forms cycle between each other and due to the concerted antagonistic activity of ubiquitylating and deubiquitylating enzymes, an intracellular ubiquitin equilibrium is maintained that is essential for normal biological function. However, measuring the level and ratio of these forms of ubiquitin has been difficult and time consuming. In this paper, we have adapted a simple immunoblotting technique to monitor ubiquitin content and equilibrium dynamics in different developmental stages and tissues of Drosophila. Our data show that the level of total ubiquitin is distinct in different developmental stages, lowest at the larval-pupal transition and in three days old adult males, and highest in first instar larvae. Interestingly, the ratio of free mono-ubiquitin remains within 30–50% range of the total throughout larval development, but peaks to 70–80% at the larval-pupal and the pupal-adult transitions. It stays within the 70–80% range in adults. In developmentally and physiologically active tissues, the ratio of free ubiquitin is similarly high, most likely reflecting a high demand for ubiquitin availability. We also used this method to demonstrate the disruption of the finely tuned ubiquitin equilibrium by the abolition of proteasome function or the housekeeping deubiquitylase, Usp5. Our data support the notion that the ubiquitin equilibrium is regulated by tissue- and developmental stage-specific mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W2905106977,"11C-acetate (ACE)-PET/CT is used for staging of high-risk prostate cancer. PET data is reconstructed with iterative algorithms, such as VUEPointHD ViP (VPHD) and VUEPoint HD Sharp IR (SharpIR), the latter with additional resolution recovery. It is expected that the resolution recovery algorithm should render more accurate maximum and mean standardized uptake values (SUVmax and SUVmean) and functional tumor volumes (FTV) than the ordinary OSEM. Performing quantitative analysis, choice of volume-of-interest delineation algorithm (SUV threshold) may influence FTV. Optimizing PET acquisition time is justified if image quality and quantitation do not deteriorate. The aim of this study is to identify the optimal reconstruction algorithm, SUV threshold and acquisition time for ACE-PET/CT.ACE-PET/CT data acquired with a General Electric Discovery 690 PET/CT from 16 consecutive high-risk prostate cancer patients was reconstructed with VPHD and SharpIR. Forty pelvic lymph nodes (LNs) and 14 prostate glands were delineated with 42% and estimated threshold. SUVmax, SUVmean, FTV and total lesion uptake were measured. Default acquisition time was four minutes per bed position. In a subset of lesions, acquisition times of one, two and four minutes were evaluated. Structural tumor volumes (STV) of the LNs were measured with CT for correlation with functional volumetric parameters. To validate SUV quantification under different conditions with SharpIR 42%, recovery coefficients (RCs) of SUVmean and FTV were calculated from a phantom with 18F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose (FDG)-filled volumes 0.1-9.2cm3 and signal-to-background (S/B) ratios 4.3-15.9.With SharpIR, SUVmax and SUVmean were higher and FTV lower compared with VPHD, regardless of threshold method, in both prostates and LNs. Total lesion uptake determined with both threshold methods was lower with SharpIR compared with VPHD with both threshold methods, except in subgroup analysis of prostate targets where estimated threshold returned higher values. Longer acquisition times returned higher FTV for both threshold methods, regardless of reconstruction algorithm. The FTV difference was most pronounced with one minute's acquisition per bed position, which also produced visually the highest noise. SUV parameters were unaffected by varying acquisition times. FTV with SharpIR 42% showed the best correspondence with STV. SharpIR 42% gave higher RCs of SUVmean and FTV with increasing phantom size and S/B-ratio, as expected.Delineation with SharpIR 42% seems to provide the most accurate combined information from SUVmax, SUVmean, FTV and total lesion uptake. Acquisition time may be shortened to two minutes per bed position with preserved image quality."
