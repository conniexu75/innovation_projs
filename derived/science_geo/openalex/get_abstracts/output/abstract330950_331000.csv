https://openalex.org/W2085415559,"A fourteen-faced space-filling polyhedron which closely approximates the actual distribution of four-, five- and six-sided polygons found in packings of soap bubbles and biological cells is proposed as an alternative to the Kelvin tetrakaidecahedron as the ideal polyhedron for these packings. This polyhedron may also have relevance to crystallite morphologies and crystal structures."
https://openalex.org/W2026414118,"Granitic rocks from batholiths of the Sierra Nevada and Peninsular Ranges exhibit initial (143)Nd/(144)Nd ratios that vary over a large range and correlate with (87)Sr/(86)Sr ratios. The data suggest that the batholiths represent mixtures of materials derived from (i) chemically depleted mantle identical to the source of island arcs and (ii) old continental crust, probably sediments or metasediments with a provenance age of approximately 1.6 x 10(9) years. These conclusions are consistent with a model for continental growth whereby new crustal additions are repeatedly extracted from the same limited volume of the upper mantle, which has consequently become depleted in elements that are enriched in the crust. There is little evidence that hydrothermally altered, subducted oceanic crust is a primary source of the magmas."

https://openalex.org/W2033534612,"Encounters leading to competitive interactions between colonies on coral reefs are to some extent accidents of patterns of recruitment and growth. In contrast, colonies of Millepora spp. actively detect nearby arborescent gorgonians and subsequently redirect growth in order to contact and overgrow them. Detection is dependent on water flow over the two colonies."
https://openalex.org/W2088060828,"Nolana mollis, a succulent-leaved shrub of the extreme coastal desert of Chile, has the capacity to condense water on its leaves out of unsaturated atmospheres, Metabolic energy would have to be expended to move this water either from the leaf surface directly to the mesophyll or, when dripped to the soil, from there into the roots. Because of the unusual aridity of its habitat and of the utilization of water-use-efficient metabolism by Nolana, at least during certain periods, such an energy expenditure could be effective."
https://openalex.org/W4251134474,"Mature meanders in lunar sinuous rills strongly suggests that the rills are features of surface erosion by water. Such erosion could occur under a pressurizing ice cover in the absence of a lunar atmosphere. Water, outgassed from the lunar interior and trapped beneath a layer of permafrost, could be released by a meteoritic impact and overflow the crater to form an ice-covered river. A sinuous rill could be eroded in about 100 years."
https://openalex.org/W2070847695,"A new species of Lower Carboniferous holocephalan chondrichthyan, Delphyodontos dacriformes, is described from two fetal specimens. The well-developed slashing and piercing dentition, enlargement of the abdominal region, and fecal material indicate the probable evolution of intrauterine oophagy and viviparity in Paleozoic Chondrichthyes."
https://openalex.org/W2083032204,Quantitative economic analysis of 20 commercial innovations shows that there is great benefit to society that is often not reflected in the rate of return to the innovator. The study also documents the importance of marketing strategy and proper consideration of risk.
https://openalex.org/W2072166221,"All published distributional data on recent benthic foraminifera of the North American Atlantic continental margin were archived into computerized catalogs. Cluster analysis of these data delimited seven large, marginally overlapping provinces exhibiting a congruous relationship with western North Atlantic water masses. The single major latitudinal faunal change occurs at Cape Hatteras."

https://openalex.org/W2043079891,Fossilized visceral organs in ancient echinoderms have anatomical features that were not inferred from the anatomy of extant relatives. The unique visceral anatomy of extinct echinoderms demonstrates the need to integrate paleontological and neontological analyses in order to fully evaluate this and other morphologically complex phyla. Comparative analysis of the visceral anatomy of extinct and extant echinoderms necessitates regrouping these animals into three new subphyla. Similar analyses for other metazoan groups could yield equally significant results.
https://openalex.org/W2061869603,"A few of the scientific challenges of polar research are reviewed, with stress on the work being done by U.S. investigators. The accomplishments that have been made are impressive, but much remains to be done. An evaluation of future research goals and priorities in science per se and in the national interest is not attempted, but a research strategy for the future, presently planned by the National Research Council's Polar Research Board, should contribute to this end."

https://openalex.org/W2085339990,"The reaction of SO2 and NO2 with soot has been studied experimentally by gravimetric determination of chemisorption with subsequent analysis of the chemisorbed species by various techniques. When samples of commercially available carbon black (used as soot surrogate) are exposed to SO2 or NO2 in dry air or N2 as carrier gas, no quantitative chemisorption (less than 5 micrograms per mg of substrate) is observed. However, exposure of the same grade of carbon to a combination of SO2 and NO2 in dry air of N2 results in significant chemisorption (180-200 micrograms/mg), a major fraction of which is analyzed as sulfate."
https://openalex.org/W1996628657,The first and only known phase in the tellurium-sulfur system has been obtained at high pressures. Evidence is presented to support the hypothesis that this phase consists of a cocrystallization of sulfur and tellurium helices in 1 : 1 ratio.
