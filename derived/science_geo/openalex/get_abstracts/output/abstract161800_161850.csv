Saturated fatty acids (SFAs) acylated in lipid A moiety of LPS are essential for biological activities of LPS. Thus, we determined whether these fatty acids modulate LPS-induced signaling pathways and COX-2 expression in monocyte/macrophage cells (RAW 264.7). Results show that SFAs, but not unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs), induce nuclear factor κB activation and expression of COX-2 and other inflammatory markers. This induction is inhibited by a dominant-negative Tlr4. UFAs inhibit COX-2 expression induced by SFAs, constitutively active Tlr4, or LPS. However, UFAs fail to inhibit COX-2 expression induced by activation of signaling components downstream of Tlr4. Together, these results suggest that both SFA-induced COX-2 expression and its inhibition by UFAs are mediated through a common signaling pathway derived from Tlr4. These results represent a novel mechanism by which fatty acids modulate signaling pathways and target gene expression. Furthermore, these results suggest a possibility that propensity of monocyte/macrophage activation is modulated through Tlr4 by different types of free fatty acids, which in turn can be altered by kinds of dietary fat consumed.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that the levels of prostaglandins in various tumors, or the tumor's biosynthetic capacity of prostaglandins, are greater when compared with normal tissues (12Bennett A.

Recently, it has been shown that the inducible form of COX is overexpressed in sites of inflammation and in many types of tumor tissues (17Kutchera W. Jones D.A. Matsunami N. Groden J. McIntyre T.M.

Overexpression of COX-2 in tumor tissues occurs in both tumor cells and stromal cells including macrophages (21Hwang D. Scollard D. Byrne J. Levine E. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). What causes the overexpression of COX-2 in such pathological states is not clearly understood. COX-2 belongs to a family of immediate early response genes that do not require precedent protein synthesis for their expression (22Herschman H.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 281-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). Therefore, elucidating the signaling pathways leading to the expression of COX-2 is a key to understanding why COX-2 is overexpressed in such pathological states and can provide critical information for identifying potential targets of modulation by pharmacological and dietary factors. COX-2 expression is induced by various mitogenic stimuli in different cell types (6Kujubu D.A. Fletcher B.S. Varnum B.C. Lim R.W. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

The cis-acting NFκB element is present in the 5′-flanking regions of COX-2 genes of different species (24Fletcher B.S. Kujubu D.A. Perrin D.M. Herschman H.R. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 31315-31320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar). Results from our previous studies demonstrated that the activation of NFκB is required to induce maximal expression of COX-2 in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophage cell line (26Hwang D. Jang B.C., Yu, G. Boudreau M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar,27Rhee S.H. Hwang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34035-34040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα and IL-1, also activate NFκB and induce COX-2 expression in many cell types (28Schwenger P. Alpert D. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 78-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Schwenger P. Bellosta P. Vietor I. Basilico C. Skolnik E.Y. Vilcek J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2869-2873Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). The recent finding that murine Tlr4 is the LPS receptor (30Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6397) Google Scholar) provided a new impetus in elucidating LPS-induced signaling pathways and target gene expression. Results from our previous studies indicated that murine Tlr4 confers LPS responsiveness and that activation of Tlr4 is sufficient to induce NFκB activation and expression of COX-2 in macrophages (27Rhee S.H. Hwang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34035-34040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The lipid A moiety possesses most of the biological activities of LPS (31Raetz C.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Lipid A of Escherichia coli andSalmonella typhimurium is a β,1–6-linked disaccharide of glucosamine, acylated with R-3-hydroxylaurate or myristate and phosphorylated at positions 1 and 4′. The 3-hydroxyl groups of these saturated fatty acids are further 3-O-acylated by lauric acid, myristic acid, or palmitic acid (31Raetz C.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). These acyl-linked saturated fatty acids are subject to hydrolysis by acyloxyacyl hydrolase; the deacylated lipid A loses its endotoxic properties and acts as an antagonist against lipid A (32Munford R.S. Hall C.L. Science. 1986; 234: 203-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 33Kitchens R.L. Ulevitch R.J. Munford R.S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This implies that fatty acids acylated in lipid A may play an important role in ligand recognition and receptor activation for Tlr4. In light of the finding that murine Tlr4 is the LPS receptor (30Poltorak A. He X. Smirnova I. Liu M.Y. Huffel C.V. Du X. Birdwell D. Alejos E. Silva M. Galanos C. Freudenberg M. Ricciardi-Castagnoli P. Layton B. Beutler B. Science. 1998; 282: 2085-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (6397) Google Scholar), it is important to determine whether these fatty acids modulate Tlr4-mediated signaling pathways and the expression of target gene products. If they do, this will represent a new paradigm for the mechanism by which gene expression is regulated by fatty acids. Activation of monocytes/macrophages is an important initial step in the cascades of events leading to many inflammatory diseases including endotoxemia (34Rietschel E.T. Brade H. Sci. Am. 1992; 267: 54-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). If activation of macrophages is modulated by types of fatty acids through Tlr4, it can be inferred that risk for such diseases may also be modified by different types of fatty acids. All saturated and unsaturated fatty acids were purchased from Nu-Chek (Eslyan, MN). Rumenic acid (9(Z),11(E)-octadecadienoic acid; conjugated linoleic acid) was purchased from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA). LPS was purchased from Difco (Detroit, MI). Bovine serum albumin (fatty acid free and low endotoxin, catalog number A8806; BSA) and human recombinant TNFα were purchased from Sigma. Polyclonal antibodies for COX-2 were prepared and characterized as described previously (21Hwang D. Scollard D. Byrne J. Levine E. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1998; 90: 455-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar, 23Lee S.H. Soyoola E. Chanmugam P. Hart S. Sun W. Zhong H. Liou S. Simmons D. Hwang D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25934-25938Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies for iNOS and IL-1α were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. ECL Western blotting detection reagents were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. SuperFect transfection reagent was purchased from Qiagen (Valencia, CA). A luciferase assay system and β-galactosidase enzyme system were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). All other reagents were purchased from Sigma unless described otherwise. RAW 264.7 cells (a murine macrophage-like cell line, ATCC number TIB-71) or HT-29 cells (a human colon adenocarcinoma cell line, ATCC number HTB-38) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Intergen) and 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2/air environment. Cells (2 × 106) were plated in 60-mm dishes (Falcon) and cultured for an additional 18 h to allow the number of cells to approximately double. Cells were maintained in serum-poor (0.25% fetal bovine serum) medium for another 18 h prior to the treatment with indicated reagents. All fatty acids were solubilized in ethanol. They were combined with fatty acid-free and low endotoxin BSA at a molar ratio of 10:1 (fatty acid:albumin) in serum-poor medium (0.25% fetal bovine serum). Fatty acid-albumin complex solution was freshly prepared prior to each experiment. These were performed as previously described (26Hwang D. Jang B.C., Yu, G. Boudreau M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1997; 54: 87-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar,35Paik J.H. Ju J.H. Lee J.Y. Boudreau M.D. Hwang D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28173-28179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, solubilized proteins were subjected to 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for COX-2, iNOS, IL-1α, and GAPDH immunoblot analyses. Following electrophoresis, the gel was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the membrane was blocked to prevent nonspecific binding of antibodies in TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl, 137 mm NaCl, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 7.6) containing 5% nonfat dried milk (Carnation). Immunoblotting was performed using respective polyclonal antibodies followed by incubation with anti-rabbit IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase. The membrane was exposed on an x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.) using ECL Western blot detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The luciferase reporter plasmids (pGL2) containing the promoter region of the murine COX-2 gene (−3201/+93 or −1017/+93) were provided by David Dewitt (Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI). To prepare the wild-type COX-2 promoter fragment, polymerase chain reaction was performed with the primers named Kpn-COX2-For and Hind-COX2-Rev using the murine COX-2 (−1017/+93) luciferase reporter plasmid as a template. To prepare the mutant COX-2 promoter fragment-containing mutated NFκB site, Kpn-COX2-Fmut and Hind-COX2-Rev were used as primers. Each polymerase chain reaction fragment was inserted into theKpnI and HindIII sites of pGL2 to generate the wild-type or mutant COX-2 (−410/+86) luciferase reporter constructs, respectively. The sequence for the wild-type NFκB site, GGGATTCCC, was changed to GGCCTTCCC. All promoter sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The primers used are as follows: Kpn-COX2-For, 5′-GACGGTACCGAGAGGTGAGGGGATTCCC-3′; Hind-COX2-Rev, 5′-CAGAAGCTTGGTGGAGCTGGCAGGATG-3′; Kpn-COX2- Fmut, 5′-GACGGTACCGAGAGGTGAGGGCCTTCCC-3′. 2× NFκB-luciferase reporter construct was a gift from Frank Mercurio (Signal Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA). HSP70-β-galactosidase reporter plasmid was from Robert Modlin (University of California, Los Angeles, CA). The expression plasmids for a constitutively active form of Tlr4 (ΔTlr4) and a dominant-negative mutant, ΔTlr4(P712H), were prepared as described previously (27Rhee S.H. Hwang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34035-34040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid of the wild-type NFκB-inducing kinase (NIK), pRK-NIK(wt), was gift from Mike Rothe (Tularik, South San Francisco, CA). The dominant-negative mutant of inhibitor κB (pCMV4-IκBα(ΔN)) was provided by Dean Ballard (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). The constitutively active form of MyD88 (FLAG-MyD88(ΔToll)) was kindly provided by Jurg Tschopp (University of Lausanne) (36Burns K. Martinon F. Esslinger C. Pahl H. Schneider P. Bodmer J.L. Di Marco F. French L. Tschopp J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12203-12209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The dominant-negative mutant of mouse PPARγ (pCMX-PPARγ(L466A/L467A)) was from Ira Schulman (Ligand Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA). All DNA constructs were prepared in large scale using an EndoFree plasmid maxi kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for transfection. These were performed as described in our previous studies (27Rhee S.H. Hwang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34035-34040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 35Paik J.H. Ju J.H. Lee J.Y. Boudreau M.D. Hwang D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28173-28179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Briefly, RAW 264.7 cells were plated in 6-well plates (5 × 105 cells/well) and transfected with luciferase reporter plasmids and HSP70-β-galactosidase plasmid as an internal control using SuperFect transfection reagent (Quiagen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Luciferase and β-galactosidase enzyme activities were determined using the luciferase assay system and β-galactosidase enzyme system (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Luciferase activity was normalized by β-galactosidase activity. Data were analyzed by pairedt test. Saturated fatty acids induced COX-2 expression as determined by both Western blot analysis (Fig.1 A) and luciferase reporter gene assay for COX-2 (Fig. 1 B). Among the saturated fatty acids (C8:0-C18:0) tested, lauric acid (C12:0) and palmitic acid (C16:0) were most potent in inducing COX-2 expression (Fig.1 C). In addition to COX-2, the expression of other inflammatory marker gene products such as iNOS and IL-1α was also induced by lauric acid in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1 A). Unlike saturated fatty acids, all unsaturated fatty acids (C18:1n-9, C18:2n-6, C20:4n-6, C20:5n-3, and C22:6n-3) and conjugated linoleic acid (cLA) tested were unable to induce COX-2 expression in RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 1 D). In our previous studies it was demonstrated that activation of NFκB is sufficient and required to induce maximal expression of COX-2 in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells (27Rhee S.H. Hwang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34035-34040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Therefore, we determined whether saturated fatty acid-induced COX-2 expression is mediated through the activation of NFκB in RAW 264.7 cells. Lauric acid activated NFκB in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.2 A). The expression of COX-2 induced by lauric acid was inhibited by co-transfection of a dominant-negative mutant of IκBα plasmid (Fig. 2 B). In addition, lauric acid-induced COX-2 expression was significantly reduced in the COX-2 promoter reporter gene containing the mutated NFκB site as compared with the one containing the wild-type NFκB site (Fig. 2 C). Because naturally occurring fatty acids are known to bind and activate PPARs (37Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Boudreau M.D. Hwang D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 28173-28179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 43Meade E.A. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8328-8334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), we determined whether saturated fatty acid-induced COX-2 expression is also mediated through the PPAR signaling pathway. The 5′-flanking region of murine COX-2 contains PPAR response element (PPRE)-like sequences (Fig.3 A). Thus, we determined whether these sequences are required for saturated fatty acid-induced COX-2 expression. The result showed that deletion of those sequences did not affect the promoter activity of COX-2 reporter gene (Fig.3 A). Next, we determined whether a dominant-negative mutant of PPARγ (44Schulman I.G. Shao G. Heyman R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3483-3494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) alters the saturated fatty acid-induced COX-2 expression. The result showed that lauric acid-induced COX-2 expression in cells co-transfected with a dominant-negative mutant of PPARγ plasmid was not altered as compared with control cells regardless of whether the COX-2 reporter gene construct contains the PPRE-like sequences or not (Fig. 3 B). Together, these results suggest that saturated fatty acid-induced COX-2 expression is not directly mediated through the PPRE-like sequences in COX-2 gene. Next, we attempted to identify the upstream target in the NFκB signaling pathways through which the saturated fatty acids activate NFκB and induce COX-2 expression. Activation of Tlr4 is sufficient and necessary to activate NFκB and to induce COX-2 expression in RAW 264.7 cells. Because of the implication that lauric acid, myristic acid, or palmitic acid acylated in the lipid A molecule may play an important role in transmitting the LPS-mediated signal, we determined whether saturated fatty acid-induced activation of NFκB and COX-2 expression are mediated through the murine LPS receptor (Tlr4). If saturated fatty acid-induced COX-2 expression is mediated through Tlr4, co-transfection of cells with a dominant-negative mutant of Tlr4 should lead to inhibition of COX-2 expression. The results show that the dominant-negative mutant of Tlr4 (ΔTlr4(P712H)) inhibits both saturated fatty acid-induced NFκB activation and COX-2 expression (Fig. 4,A and B). These results suggest that the upstream target in the signaling pathways through which saturated fatty acids mediate NFκB activation and COX-2 expression is Tlr4 or its associated molecules. However, these results do not allow us to conclude whether saturated fatty acids directly interact with Tlr4. Unlike saturated fatty acids, unsaturated fatty acids were unable to induce COX-2 expression (Fig. 1 D). Furthermore, they inhibited saturated fatty acid-induced NFκB activation (Fig.5 A) and COX-2 expression (Fig.5 B). These results indicate that inhibition of saturated fatty acid-induced COX-2 expression by unsaturated fatty acids is mediated through suppression of the NFκB signaling pathway. Together, these results suggest that both the induction of COX-2 by saturated fatty acids and its inhibition by unsaturated fatty acids are mediated through the NFκB signaling pathway. If saturated fatty acid-induced COX-2 expression is mediated through Tlr4, it is logical to determine whether the inhibition of saturated fatty acid-induced COX-2 expression by unsaturated fatty acids is also mediated through Tlr4. The results showed that docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n-3) partially inhibits constitutively active Tlr4 (ΔTlr4)-induced COX-2 expression (Fig. 6 A). MyD88 is the immediate downstream adaptor protein that interacts directly with the cytoplasmic domain of Tlr4. Activation of MyD88 leads to activation of NFκB and COX-2 expression in RAW 264.7 cells (27Rhee S.H. Hwang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34035-34040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Therefore, if the inhibition of saturated fatty acid-induced COX-2 expression by unsaturated fatty acids is mediated through Tlr4, COX-2 expression induced by the activation of signaling steps downstream of Tlr4 should not be inhibited by unsaturated fatty acids. The results indeed show that docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n-3) is unable to inhibit COX-2 expression induced by constitutively active MyD88 or NIK (Fig. 6,B and C). These results suggest that both induction of COX-2 expression by saturated fatty acids and its inhibition by unsaturated fatty acids are mediated through Tlr4 or molecules associated with Tlr4. If the inhibition of saturated fatty acid-induced COX-2 expression by unsaturated fatty acids is mediated through Tlr4 or its associated molecules, unsaturated fatty acids should also inhibit LPS-induced COX-2 expression. The results indeed show that docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n-3) inhibits the LPS-induced expression of COX-2, iNOS, and IL-1α (Fig.7 A). Other unsaturated fatty acids tested (Fig. 1 D) also inhibit LPS-induced COX-2 expression (data not shown). Inhibition of LPS-induced NFκB activation by docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n-3) is demonstrated by inhibition of LPS-induced degradation of IκBα protein (Fig. 7 B). Furthermore, docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n-3) fails to inhibit TNFα-induced COX-2 expression in a colon tumor cell line (HT-29) (Fig. 7 C) reinforcing the possibility that the inhibitory effect of unsaturated fatty acid on saturated fatty acid- or LPS-induced expression of COX-2 is specifically mediated through Tlr4 or its associated molecules. Most long-chain fatty acids are esterified in cellular lipids in mammalian cells. Therefore, the concentrations of unesterified fatty acids are believed to be low. However, fatty acids are rapidly released by the action of various phospholipase A2 and monoacylglycerol and diacylglycerol lipases in response to various extracellular stimuli. In plasma the average concentration of free fatty acid in postabsorptive state is <0.7 mm, and this concentration may be much higher in absorptive phase after ingestion of a fatty meal (45Jump D.B. Clarke S.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 63-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Therefore, blood cells such as monocytes are constantly exposed to relatively high concentrations of free fatty acids. Fatty acids are known to regulate the expression of many genes involved in lipid metabolism (45Jump D.B. Clarke S.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 63-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) and modulate activity of signaling molecules such as phospholipase C and protein kinase C (46Hwang S.C. Jhon D.Y. Bae Y.S. Kim J.H.

Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4218) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which fatty acids can regulate gene expression is still not well understood. However, some conceptual framework has been proposed for the possible mechanism of actions. Fatty acids and their oxidative metabolites are known to bind and activate PPARs, the steroid-thyroid superfamily of nuclear receptors (37Forman B.M. Chen J. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Two zinc finger motifs in the DNA binding domain of PPARs bind PPREs located in the 5′-flanking region of PPAR responsive genes. PPARs bind PPRE as a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor. Polyunsaturated fatty acids and other peroxisome proliferators induce peroxisomal β-oxidation and the expression of certain peroxisomal enzymes (45Jump D.B. Clarke S.D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1999; 19: 63-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Using PPARα null mice, it was demonstrated that PPARα is required for the induction of acyl-CoA oxidase by n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids but not for the suppression of lipogenic enzymes by n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (48Ren B. Thelen A.P. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Jump D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26827-26832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). These results indicate that regulation of gene expression by fatty acids can be mediated through signaling pathways other than PPARs. The inability of a dominant-negative mutant of PPARγ to inhibit saturated fatty acid-induced COX-2 expression suggests that the induction was not mediated through activation of PPARγ. However, the possibility that the induction of COX-2 expression by saturated fatty acid is in part mediated through PPARα or PPARδ cannot be ruled out. Murine COX-2 gene contains PPRE-like sequences at positions −2354 to −2342 in the 5′-flanking region. Deletion of these sequences did not affect the promoter activity of COX-2 reporter gene (Fig. 3) suggesting that the PPRE-like sequences do not appear to be required for saturated fatty acid-induced COX-2 expression. However, the possibility that the saturated fatty acids in part stimulate or inhibit other PPAR-responsive gene products, which in turn cause the induction of COX-2 expression, cannot be ruled out. It was shown that unsaturated fatty acids induce COX-2 expression in mammary epithelial cells (43Meade E.A. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8328-8334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Whether this induction is mediated through PPARs has not been determined. However, to our surprise, saturated fatty acids, but not unsaturated fatty acids, induce COX-2 in RAW 264.7 cells (Fig. 1). Greater potency of lauric acid and palmitic acid in inducing COX-2 expression among saturated fatty acids tested (Fig. 1 C) coincides with the abundance of these fatty acids in the lipid A molecule (31Raetz C.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). Lauric, myristic, and palmitic acids are known to be major fatty acids acylated in the lipid A molecule (31Raetz C.R. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 129-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). The fact that deacylation of these fatty acids from LPS results in loss of endotoxic activity (32Munford R.S. Hall C.L. Science. 1986; 234: 203-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 33Kitchens R.L. Ulevitch R.J. Munford R.S. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 485-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar) implies an important role of these fatty acids in LPS-mediated signal transmission. NFκB is one of the major downstream signaling pathways derived from activation of the LPS receptor, Tlr4 in RAW 264.7 cells (27Rhee S.H. Hwang D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34035-34040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The results demonstrating that induction of COX-2 by lauric acid is mediated through activation of NFκB (Fig. 2) and that this activation is inhibited by a dominant-negative mutant of Tlr4 (Fig. 4 A), suggest that the most upstream signaling components affected by saturated fatty acids include Tlr4 or molecules associated with Tlr4. Whether saturated fatty acids can directly interact with Tlr4 or they interact with molecules associated with either extracellular or intracellular domains of Tlr4 remains to be determined. The results presented in Figs. 4 and 6 suggest that activation of NFκB and COX-2 expression induced by saturated fatty acids and inhibition of this induction by unsaturated fatty acids are mediated through a common signaling pathway derived from Tlr4. The possibility that saturated fatty acids may act as a physiologically relevant endogenous ligand for Tlr4 and that unsaturated fatty acids interfere with saturated fatty acids in interacting with Tlr4 or molecules associated with Tlr4 remains to be determined. Although the detail mechanism by which saturated and unsaturated fatty acids interact with Tlr4 or its associated molecules is not known, the results presented in this report represent a novel mechanism by which fatty acids modulate signaling pathways and the expression of target genes. Furthermore, the results imply the possibility that cellular expression of COX-2 and other inflammatory markers in monocytes and macrophages can be differentially regulated by different types of free fatty acids that in turn can be altered by kinds of dietary fats consumed. These results further raise important questions as to whether activation of monocytes/macrophages and the propensity of endotoxemia can be modulated by types of plasma fatty acids and whether unsaturated fatty acids can provide prophylactic efficacy against endotoxemia. Elucidating the mechanisms of the differential regulation of gene expression and activation of macrophages by types of fatty acids will help us to understand how different kinds of dietary fat modify risks of many chronic and acute inflammatory diseases.

Several agonists that act via seven-transmembrane domain-containing, G protein-coupled receptors elicit a contractile response without a change in [Ca2+]i (9Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. J. Physiol. 2000; 522: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). This generally results from inhibition of myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP), a myosin-associated type 1 protein-serine/threonine phosphatase that dephosphorylates LC20 phosphorylated by MLCK (10Hartshorne D.J. Ito M. Erdödi F. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1998; 19: 325-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). MLCP inhibition occurs via signaling pathways that involve (i) protein kinase C (PKC) and its substrate protein CPI-17 (17-kDa phosphatase inhibitor and substrate of protein kinase C), which becomes a very potent inhibitor of type 1 phosphatase after phosphorylation by PKC (11Li L. Eto M. Lee M.R. Morita F. Yazawa M. Kitazawa T. J. Physiol. 1998; 508: 871-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 12Kitazawa T. Eto M. Woodsome T.P. Brautigan D.L. J. Biol.

Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21492-21498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or via activation of an atypical PKC isoenzyme (16Gailly P. Gong M.C. Somlyo A.V. Somlyo A.P. J. Physiol. 1997; 500: 95-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) or ROK (17Feng J. Ito M. Kureishi Y. Ichikawa K. Amano M. Isaka N. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Hartshorne D.J. Nakano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3744-3752Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Of these signal transduction pathways, the RhoA-ROK pathway, appears to be the most important quantitatively (9Somlyo A.P. Somlyo A.V. J. Physiol. 2000; 522: 177-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). All of these signaling pathways terminate in inhibition of MLCP and an increase in myosin phosphorylation, which accounts for the contractile response. The kinase responsible for the increase in myosin phosphorylation without a change in [Ca2+]i could be MLCK itself that is partially activated at the prevailing [Ca2+]i, or it could be a distinct kinase capable of phosphorylating myosin at Ser19 in a Ca2+-independent manner. We recently obtained evidence for the presence in smooth muscle of a Ca2+-independent kinase that can phosphorylate LC20 at Ser19 and Thr18 (18Weber L.P. Van Lierop J.E. Walsh M.P. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 805-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The addition of the phosphatase inhibitor microcystin-LR to Triton X-100-demembranated (skinned) rat tail arterial smooth muscle strips in the absence of Ca2+elicited a contraction that reached a steady-state level of force comparable with that evoked in skinned muscle by Ca2+ or in intact muscle by K+ depolarization. This Ca2+-independent contraction correlated with phosphorylation of myosin at Ser19 and Thr18 of LC20. The kinase responsible for this phosphorylation was not MLCK for the following reasons: (i) its activity was independent of Ca2+ and CaM; (ii) it did not bind to CaM in either the presence or absence of Ca2+; (iii) its activity was insensitive to AV25, a synthetic peptide inhibitor of MLCK corresponding to the autoinhibitory (pseudosubstrate) domain of MLCK; (iv) it phosphorylated Ser19 and Thr18 of LC20, whereas MLCK only phosphorylates Thr18 at high kinase concentrations and only after Ser19 has been fully phosphorylated (6Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 10027-10031Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Ikebe M. Hartshorne D.J. Elzinga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 36-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and (v) the activity could be separated from MLCK. The kinase appeared to be associated with the myofilaments, since Ca2+-independent kinase activity directed toward endogenous myosin LC20 was recovered in myofilament preparations. We were able to separate Ca2+-independent kinase activity from MLCK by differential extraction from myofilaments and by affinity chromatography on a column of CaM-Sepharose (18Weber L.P. Van Lierop J.E. Walsh M.P. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 805-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). We report here the identification of this Ca2+-independent kinase as integrin-linked kinase (ILK) and provide evidence for two distinct pools of this enzyme in smooth muscle, one of which is associated with the myofilaments and is responsible for the Ca2+-independent phosphorylation of myosin. ILK could account, at least in part, for the phosphorylation of myosin and contraction that occurs in smooth muscle in response to agonists that trigger a contractile response without a change in [Ca2+]i. Furthermore, ILK could play a role in the contractile response to agonists that induce both an increase in [Ca2+]i and inhibition of MLCP. These results also raise the possibility that ILK may play an important role in regulation of nonmuscle motile processes such as cell migration, chemotaxis, and cytokinesis. Finally, this work confirms that ILK is indeed a functional protein-serine/threonine kinase.

Chicken gizzard myofilaments were prepared as follows. All procedures were carried out at 0–4 °C. Fresh gizzards (100 g) were trimmed, minced in a meat grinder, and homogenized in 500 ml of buffer A (20 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 6.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with the aid of a Brinkman Polytron (setting 6). The homogenate was centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in 500 ml of buffer A plus 0.5% Triton X-100, homogenized with the aid of a Brinkman Polytron (setting 5), and centrifuged as before. The pellet was resuspended in 500 ml of buffer A plus 0.5% Triton X-100, homogenized, and centrifuged as before. The pellet was resuspended in 500 ml of buffer A plus 0.3% Triton X-100, homogenized, and centrifuged as before. The pellet was resuspended in 500 ml of buffer A, homogenized, and centrifuged as before. The pellet (myofilament preparation) was resuspended in 500 ml of buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 80 mm KCl, 30 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), stirred gently for 30 min, and centrifuged as before. This extraction with 30 mmMgCl2 removes almost all the MLCK (18Weber L.P. Van Lierop J.E. Walsh M.P. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 805-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The pellet was resuspended in 473.7 ml of buffer B, and 31.3 ml of buffer C (buffer B plus 4 m NaCl) were added slowly with stirring. The mixture was stirred gently for 30 min and centrifuged as before. The supernatant, which contained the Ca2+-independent myosin LC20 kinase, was dialyzed overnight against buffer C (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm DTT) to lower the NaCl concentration. The dialysate was centrifuged as before to remove particulate material, and the supernatant was subjected to chromatography at a flow rate of 40 ml/h on a column of DEAE-Sephacel (1.5 × 20 cm) previously equilibrated with buffer C. Fractions containing Ca2+-independent kinase activity were identified by assaying myosin phosphorylation in the absence of Ca2+as previously described (18Weber L.P. Van Lierop J.E. Walsh M.P. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 805-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The flow-through fractions, which contained the Ca2+-independent LC20 kinase, were dialyzed overnight against buffer D (20 mm NaHepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1m NaCl, 1 mm DTT). The dialysate was applied at a flow rate of 60 ml/h to a column of SP-Sepharose Fast Flow (1.5 × 15 cm) previously equilibrated with buffer D, and the column was washed with 100 ml of buffer D. Bound proteins, including the Ca2+-independent LC20 kinase, were eluted with a linear [NaCl] gradient (0.1–0.6 m) at 40 ml/h, collecting 10-ml fractions. Fractions containing Ca2+-independent kinase were pooled, dialyzed overnight against buffer D, and applied to a Mono Q FPLC column, eluting bound proteins with a linear [NaCl] gradient (0.1–0.4 m in buffer D). Fractions of 1 ml were collected and assayed for Ca2+-independent MLCK activity. Protein samples were mixed with an equal volume of 2 × SDS gel sample buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% SDS, 30% glycerol, and 0.01% bromphenol blue) and incubated at 20 °C for 2 h prior to electrophoresis in SDS gels with a 10–20% acrylamide gradient (23Winder S.J. Walsh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10148-10155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with LC20throughout the 0.75-mm thick gel (5 μg/ml running gel solution). Gels were washed at room temperature with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 10 mm EGTA, 2.5% Triton X-100 for 2 h to remove the SDS and then washed for a further 2 h in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 60 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm DTT, 10 mm EGTA, 0.1% Tween 80 (kinase assay buffer). The buffer was replaced with 25 ml of fresh kinase assay buffer, and LC20 phosphorylation was initiated by the addition of 60 μm ATP containing 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After incubation at 20 °C for 3 h, the gel was washed extensively with 5% trichloroacetic acid, 1% sodium pyrophosphate until the radioactivity in the wash solution was negligible. The gel was stained, destained, dried, and exposed to x-ray film (23Winder S.J. Walsh M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10148-10155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A partial ILK cDNA was cloned from chicken gizzard mRNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction using primers (5′-TGTGGCTGGACAACACAGAG-3′ and 5′-GAGAGGTCAGCAAAGGGCAC-3′) corresponding to nucleotides 53–72 and 1168–1187, respectively, within the coding region of the human cDNA (24Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Full-length ILK cDNA was cloned by 5′- and 3′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (25Frohman M.A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 340-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The full-length cloned cDNA was sequenced by the Sanger dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (26Sanger F. Science. 1981; 214: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was performed on the trypsin-digested 59-kDa kinase band from the Mono Q column (see Fig. 2 B), and one of the peptides (1594 Da) was directly sequenced by MALDI-TOF MS in the post-source decay mode by Borealis Biosciences Inc. (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Full-length chicken ILK cDNA was inserted into theEcoRI/BamHI site of the vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The recombinant plasmid pGEX-2T-ILK and the empty vector as a negative control were used to transform competent BL21(DE3)pLysS cells. Expression was induced with 0.1 mmisopropyl %-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. GST-ILK was purified from the bacterial lysate by glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity chromatography, and the GST was cleaved off by thrombin treatment following the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We showed previously that myofilaments isolated from chicken gizzard smooth muscle contain endogenous Ca2+-independent kinase activity toward myosin LC20, phosphorylation occurring at Ser19 and Thr18 (18Weber L.P. Van Lierop J.E. Walsh M.P. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 805-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). These myofilaments also retain the full complement of cellular MLCK (18Weber L.P. Van Lierop J.E. Walsh M.P. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 805-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). To estimate the relative activities of these two myofilament-associated kinases, we examined the effect of synthetic peptide inhibitors of MLCK, corresponding to the autoinhibitory domain of MLCK, on the phosphorylation of endogenous myosin in the presence of Ca2+ and CaM. These peptides are the most highly selective inhibitors of MLCK (27Ikebe M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 714-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 28Foster C.J. Johnston S.A. Sunday B. Gaeta F.C.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 280: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 29Knighton D.R. Pearson R.B. Sowadski J.M. Means A.R. Ten Eyck L.F. Taylor S.S. Kemp B.E. Science. 1992; 258: 130-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). SM-1 corresponds to the autoinhibitory sequence of MLCK (residues 783–804 of chicken gizzard MLCK), and AV25 is a similar peptide corresponding to residues 783–807 of chicken gizzard MLCK with three substitutions (Trp800 was replaced by Leu to effectively eliminate interaction of the peptide with CaM, and Ser787 and Thr803 were replaced by Ala to eliminate phosphorylatable residues). The two peptides proved to be equipotent inhibitors of MLCK, so data obtained from their use were combined. As shown in Fig.1, most of the MLCK activity in myofilaments can be accounted for by Ca2+/CaM-dependent MLCK, but a significant proportion was found to be insensitive to inhibition by the autoinhibitory domain of MLCK (Fig. 1 A). For comparison, purified MLCK was completely inhibited by the MLCK inhibitory peptides, with half-maximal inhibition at 1 μm peptide (Fig.1 B). [Ala9]autocamtide 2, a peptide inhibitor of Ca2+/CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II), an enzyme known to phosphorylate myosin in vitro(30Edelman A.M. Lin W-H. Osterhout D.J. Bennett M.K. Kennedy M.B. Krebs E.G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1990; 97: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), had no effect on Ca2+-independent LC20phosphorylation in myofilaments but potently inhibited the phosphorylation of caldesmon in myofilaments by exogenous CaM kinase II, as expected (18Weber L.P. Van Lierop J.E. Walsh M.P. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 805-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). CaM kinase II, or a constitutively active proteolytic fragment of CaM kinase II, is therefore not involved in myosin phosphorylation in myofilaments. On the other hand, the Ca2+-independent phosphorylation of myosin in myofilaments was inhibited by staurosporine, a relatively nonselective kinase inhibitor, with half-maximal inhibition at ∼0.2 μm(18Weber L.P. Van Lierop J.E. Walsh M.P. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 805-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Staurosporine also inhibited microcystin-induced, Ca2+-independent contraction of skinned smooth muscle (18Weber L.P. Van Lierop J.E. Walsh M.P. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 805-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-independent phosphorylation of myosin in myofilaments was insensitive to the PKC-selective inhibitor chelerythrine and the ROK inhibitor HA-1077 (18Weber L.P. Van Lierop J.E. Walsh M.P. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 805-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The MLCK activity that was resistant to the MLCK inhibitor peptides was partially purified from myofilaments by first removing MLCK by extraction with 30 mm Mg2+ (18Weber L.P. Van Lierop J.E. Walsh M.P. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 805-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-independent kinase was then extracted with 0.25m NaCl and further purified by sequential chromatography on columns of DEAE-Sephacel, SP-Sepharose, and Mono Q. The elution profile of Ca2+-independent MLCK activity from the final column is shown in Fig. 2 A. An in-gel kinase assay in the absence of Ca2+, with isolated LC20 as substrate, showed that this activity resides in a 59-kDa protein (Fig. 2 B). This band, which was barely visible in a Coomassie Blue-stained gel of the corresponding Mono Q fractions (Fig. 2 C), was cut out of the gel, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS (TableI) (31Stults J.T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Comparison of the measured masses of the tryptic peptides with predicted masses from the protein sequence data bases revealed a single match to ILK (24Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Peptides 1–11 perfectly matched predicted tryptic peptides from human ILK, and together the 11 peptides accounted for 31% of the complete sequence. To confirm its identity as ILK, one of the tryptic peptides (peptide 6) was selected and sequenced directly by MALDI-TOF MS in the postsource decay mode (31Stults J.T. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1995; 5: 691-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Its sequence was confirmed as GMAFLHTLEPLIPR, corresponding to residues 304–317 of human ILK. From the mass spectrometric analysis, there was no evidence of a second protein in the 59-kDa band used for trypsin digestion.Table IMALDI-TOF MS analysis of Ca2+-independent myosin light chain kinasePeptideMeasured massComputed massResiduesSequenceDa1997.36997.44342–349FSFQCPGR21196.551196.62162–170IPYKDTFWK31203.591203.66439–448FDMIVPILEK41573.711573.80350–363MYAPAWVAPEALQK51582.691582.7666–80GDDTPLHLAASHGHR61593.811593.87304–317GMAFLHTLEPLIPR71679.741679.79389–403EVPFADLSNMEIGMK81742.831743.0335–349ISMADVKFSFQCPGR92023.822024.4372–388SADMWSFAVLLWELVTR102310.022310.1460–80INVMNRGDDTPLHAASHGHR113110.643111.3218–43LWLDNTENDLNQGDDHGFSPLHWACR Open table in a new tab Identification of the Ca2+-independent MLCK as ILK was confirmed by Western blotting with an antibody to human ILK. Fig.3 shows a correlation of Ca2+-independent MLCK activity (eluted from the Mono Q column) in the in-gel kinase assay (Fig. 3 A) and immunoreactivity with anti-ILK (Fig. 3 B), both at 59 kDa. Ca2+/CaM-dependent MLCK can be proteolytically degraded to a constitutively active fragment that retains the catalytic domain but lacks the autoinhibitory and CaM-binding domains (32Ikebe M. Maruta S. Reardon S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6967-6971Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that ILK purified through the Mono Q column is contaminated with a constitutively active fragment of Ca2+/CaM-dependent MLCK, pooled ILK fractions from the Mono Q column were subjected to Western blotting with an antibody that recognizes both intact MLCK (130 kDa) and the 61-kDa catalytically active fragment of Ca2+/CaM-dependent MLCK (18Weber L.P. Van Lierop J.E. Walsh M.P. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 805-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Fig.4 shows that the ILK preparation contains no trace of Ca2+/CaM-dependent MLCK fragments (lane 3), whereas both intact Ca2+/CaM-dependent MLCK (lane 1) and the 61-kDa constitutively active tryptic fragment (lane 2) are clearly recognized by the antibody. Furthermore, Ca2+-independent phosphorylation of myosin by ILK purified through the Mono Q column was unaffected by AV25, supporting the conclusion that the ILK preparation is not contaminated with proteolyzed MLCK (Fig. 5).Figure 5Phosphorylation of myosin by Mono Q-purified Ca2+-independent myosin LC20 kinase is unaffected by AV25. Smooth muscle myosin was incubated under phosphorylating conditions in the absence (lanes 1 and 2) and presence (lanes 3 and 4) of pooled ILK-containing fractions from the Mono Q column (178.5 μl/ml) and in the absence and presence of 50 μm AV25, as described previously (18Weber L.P. Van Lierop J.E. Walsh M.P. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 805-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). At the end of the reaction, samples (40 μl) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.

Isolated LC20 was phosphorylated to a stoichiometry of 1.64 mol of Pi/mol of LC20 (36.2% monophosphorylated LC20 and 63.8% diphosphorylated LC20) and intact myosin to 1.14 mol of Pi/mol of myosin (45.4% monophosphorylated LC20 and 5.7% diphosphorylated LC20). The sites of phosphorylation were identified as Ser19 and Thr18 using phosphorylation site-specific antibodies (Fig.6 B). While a portion of the ILK in chicken gizzard smooth muscle was recovered in the cytosolic fraction following homogenization of the tissue in the absence of detergent (Fig.7, lane 2), a substantial fraction remained in the Triton-insoluble fraction composed of myofilaments and cytoskeleton (Fig. 7, lane 6), consistent with its retention in Triton-skinned smooth muscle, where it phosphorylates myosin in situ in the absence of Ca2+ and elicits a Ca2+-independent contraction (18Weber L.P. Van Lierop J.E. Walsh M.P. J. Physiol. 1999; 516: 805-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). From in-gel kinase assays, ∼73% of total ILK activity was recovered in the Triton-insoluble fraction. ILK cDNA was cloned from chicken gizzard mRNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (33Schwabe W. Lee J.E. Nathan M. Xu R.H. Sitaraman K. Smith M. Potter R.J. Rosenthal K. Rashtchian A.

The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of chicken ILK are shown in Fig. 8 and are available from GenBankTM under accession number AF296130. A comparison of the chicken and human ILK amino acid sequences is shown in Fig.9. The deduced amino acid sequence of chicken ILK is 90.7% identical and 95.4% similar to the human ILK sequence (GenBankTM accession number U40282), with 21 conservative and 21 nonconservative substitutions in the 452-residue protein. Compared with many other protein-serine/threonine kinases, ILK contains a number of amino acid substitutions in highly conserved subdomains within the catalytic domain (34Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Hunter T. Science. 1988; 241: 42-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (3794) Google Scholar). The GXGXXG sequence in subdomain I of most protein kinases is NENHSG in human ILK and NENQSG in the chicken enzyme.

Inhibition of phospholipase C with U73122 blocked calcium entry andIcrac activation whether in response to a phospholipase C-coupled agonist or to calcium store depletion with thapsigargin. Run-down of cellular polyphosphoinositides by concentrations of wortmannin that block phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase completely blocked calcium entry and Icrac. The membrane-permeant IP3 receptor inhibitor, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borane, blocked both capacitative calcium entry and Icrac. However, it is likely that 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borane does not inhibit through an action on the IP3 receptor because the drug was equally effective in wild-type DT40 B-cells and in DT40 B-cells whose genes for all three IP3 receptors had been disrupted. Intracellular application of another potent IP3 receptor antagonist, heparin, failed to inhibit activation of Icrac. Finally, the inhibition of Icrac activation by U73122 or wortmannin was not reversed or prevented by direct intracellular application of IP3. These findings indicate a requirement for phospholipase C and for polyphosphoinositides for activation of capacitative calcium entry. However, the results call into question the previously suggested roles of IP3 and IP3receptor in this mechanism, at least in these particular cell types.

IP3 is known to bind to and activate receptors present on intracellular calcium stores, the endoplasmic reticulum, allowing calcium to be released into the cytosol (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar). In most cells, the emptying of these calcium stores subsequently activates calcium influx across the plasma membrane through the “capacitative calcium entry” pathway (2Putney Jr., J.W. Cell Calcium. 1986; 7: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (2115) Google Scholar, 3Putney Jr., J.W. Capacitative Calcium Entry. Landes Biomedical Publishing, Austin, TX1997Crossref Google Scholar). It is unclear how empty intracellular stores signal activation of plasma membrane capacitative calcium entry. However, a rise in cytosolic calcium is not required, nor is the activation of plasma membrane receptors, because agents such as the calcium-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin and the calcium ionophore ionomycin, which deplete calcium stores independently of receptor-coupled events, can fully activate capacitative calcium entry (3Putney Jr., J.W. Capacitative Calcium Entry. Landes Biomedical Publishing, Austin, TX1997Crossref Google Scholar). Two general models are proposed as underlying mechanisms for capacitative calcium entry activation. One is based on the requirement for a diffusible messenger generated upon store depletion (4Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 5Trepakova E.S. Csutora P. Hunton D.L. Marchase R.B. Cohen R.A. Bolotina V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26158-63261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The other hypothesizes a conformational coupling between proteins on the intracellular stores (e.g. the IP3 receptor) and capacitative calcium entry channels or associated proteins in the plasma membrane (6Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar,7Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). The diffusible messenger hypothesis proposes that a decrease in the concentration of stored calcium leads to the release of a factor that diffuses to the plasma membrane and activates capacitative calcium entry channels. Evidence in support of this model comes from reports of an unidentified calcium influx factor (4Randriamampita C. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1993; 364: 809-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (789) Google Scholar, 5Trepakova E.S. Csutora P. Hunton D.L. Marchase R.B. Cohen R.A. Bolotina V.M. J. Biol.

Nature. 1993; 364: 814-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). Evidence from Xenopus oocytes indicates that if the signal is diffusible then its diffusion is somewhat limited, because the signal remains confined to the area of calcium release (11Petersen C.C.H.

Biol. 1997; 7: 599-602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The conformational coupling model proposes the direct relay of a signal through protein-protein interactions. In the model's simplest form, IP3 receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum interact with capacitative calcium entry channels in the plasma membrane (6Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 7Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). A change in the conformation of the IP3 receptor, which occurs after a drop in endoplasmic reticulum luminal calcium (14Oldershaw K.A. Taylor C.W. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 631-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), may then be transmitted directly to the capacitative calcium entry channels causing them to open (6Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 7Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). This theory was originally proposed by analogy with ryanodine receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum stores, which bind directly to dihydropyridine calcium channels in the plasma membrane of skeletal muscle (15Meissner G. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1994; 56: 485-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). The theory has subsequently gained some experimental support. A number of studies suggest that the regulation of capacitative calcium entry is dependent upon an intimate interaction between the endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane. Pharmacological or physical dislocation of the plasma membrane away from the endoplasmic reticulum prevents activation of capacitative calcium entry by store depletion (16Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Gill D.L. Cell. 1999; 98: 487-499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar, 17Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. J. Physiol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9110-9113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). However, there is more direct evidence that an IP3receptor-capacitative calcium entry channel complex bridges the gap between endoplasmic reticulum and plasma membrane. Calcium flux through endogenous capacitative calcium entry channels (20Zubov A.I. Kaznacheeva E.V. Alexeeno V.A. Kiselyov K. Muallem S. Mozhayeva G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25983-25985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) or overexpressed TRP3 channels (a candidate capacitative calcium entry channel (21Kiselyov K. Xu X. Mozhayeva G. Kuo T. Pessah I. Mignery G. Zhu X. Birnbaumer L. Muallem S. Nature. 1998; 396: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar)) can be recorded in the cell-attached configuration but ceases when the patch is excised. The addition of IP3 and the IP3 receptor to the patch (but not the IP3receptor alone) reconstitutes capacitative calcium entry activity. A similar requirement for the IP3 receptor is revealed by the use of the IP3 receptor inhibitors 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borane (2-APB) and xestospongin C, which uncouple store depletion from the activation of capacitative calcium entry (22Ma H.-T. Patterson R.L. van Rossum D.B. Birnbaumer L. Mikoshiba K. Gill D.L. Science. 2000; 287: 1647-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). Thus, there is substantial evidence that IP3 receptors are required for activation of capacitative calcium entry channels and also evidence that these IP3 receptors need to be liganded with IP3. The requirement for IP3 for capacitative calcium entry presents something of a paradox, because, as discussed above, many laboratories have confirmed that store depletion alone, in the absence of phospholipase C activation, is capable of full activation of capacitative calcium entry. Thus, it has been suggested that the requirement for IP3 must normally be fulfilled by its basal production, presumably by a phospholipase C located in close proximity to the channel-IP3 receptor complex (23Putney Jr., J.W. Cell. 1999; 99: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The experiments in the present study were therefore designed to address the question of whether basal PLC activity and basal levels of IP3 in resting cells are required and are sufficient to support a role for the IP3-liganded IP3 receptor in the context of the conformational coupling capacitative calcium entry model. To this end, we monitored capacitative calcium entry channel activity directly by measuring the calcium release-activated calcium current (Icrac) in RBL cells and indirectly by measuring the cytosolic calcium concentration in RBL, mouse lacrimal, and DT40 cells. In the last case, we used both wild-type DT40 cells and cells whose IP3 receptor genes were disrupted by targeted homologous recombination (24Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). IP3 receptor function was inhibited pharmacologically with the membrane-permeant IP3receptor inhibitor 2-APB and the membrane-impermeant inhibitor, low molecular weight heparin. Basal IP3 formation was prevented with a phospholipase C inhibitor (U73122), and the levels of the precursor polyphosphoinositides were decreased by use of a phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase inhibitor (wortmannin). Intracellular calcium stores were subsequently depleted, independent of PLC and the IP3 receptor, using thapsigargin and ionomycin, to test whether capacitative calcium entry could still be activated by store depletion. Our results show that maneuvers that are expected to disrupt basal PLC activity prevent activation of capacitative calcium entry upon store depletion. However, the specific function of PLC is uncertain, since we are unable to demonstrate a role for IP3 or IP3 receptors in this pathway. Rat basophilic leukemia cells stably expressing the muscarinic m1 receptor (RBL-2H3 m1) were a gift from Dr. M. Beaven (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (25Choi O.H. Lee J.H.

Cells were cultured in Earle's minimal essential medium with Earle's salts, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 mg/ml streptomycin, (37 °C, 5% CO2). For experiments, cells were passaged onto glass coverslips (number 1 ½) and used 12–36 h after plating. Mouse lacrimal cells were isolated as described previously (26Parod R.J. Leslie B.A. Putney Jr., J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1980; 239: G99-G105PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the excised glands from three mice (male CD-1; 30–40 g) were finely minced and treated for 1 min with 0.2 mg/10 ml trypsin (Sigma). The cells were then removed from the trypsin by centrifugation, followed by a 5-min incubation with 2.5 mg/10 ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma) in the presence of 2.5 mm EGTA. Finally, the acinar cells were isolated after treating the tissue with 5 mg/10 ml collagenase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 10 min. Throughout, all enzyme solutions were prepared in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Following isolation, the cells were washed and suspended in sterile Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 units/ml streptomycin. The cells were allowed to attach to glass coverslips (number 1) coated with Matrigel. Lacrimal cells were incubated on glass coverslips at least 3 h before use. Lacrimal cells attached to glass coverslips were mounted in a Teflon chamber and incubated with 0.5 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed and bathed in a HEPES-buffered physiological saline solution (HBSS; 120 mm NaCl, 5.3 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgSO4, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 11.1 mm glucose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at room temperature at least 20 min before Ca2+ measurements were made. In some experiments, a nominally Ca2+-free medium was used, which was identical in composition except for the omission of added CaCl2. The fluorescence of Fura-2-loaded lacrimal cells was monitored with a photomultiplier-based system, mounted on a Nikon Diaphot 300 inverted microscope equipped with a Nikon × 40 (1.3 NA) Neofluor objective. The fluorescence light source was a Deltascan D101 (Photon Technology International Ltd.), equipped with a light path chopper and dual excitation monochromators. The light path chopper enabled rapid interchange between two excitation wavelengths (340 and 380 nm), and a photomultiplier tube monitored the emission fluorescence at 510 nm, selected by a barrier filter (Omega). All experiments were performed at room temperature. The data are expressed as a ratio of Fura-2 fluorescence due to excitation at 340 nm to that due to excitation at 380 nm (F340/F380). The immortalized chicken B-lymphocyte cell line, DT-40 (RIKEN Cell Bank number RCB1464), and a mutant version with genes for all three IP3 receptor types disrupted (RIKEN Cell Bank number RCB1467) were maintained in suspension with RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% chicken serum, 4 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 units/ml streptomycin, and 50 μg/ml 2-mercaptoethanol. The cells were maintained in culture at 40 °C in a humidified 95% air, 5% CO2 incubator, and at a cell density that ranged between 25 × 104 and 1 × 106 cells/ml. Both cell types were allowed to attach to glass coverslips (number 1) coated with Matrigel, and maintained in the RPMI 1640 medium described above. Both DT-40 cell types, attached to glass coverslips, were mounted in a Teflon chamber and incubated with either 1 μm Fura-2/AM (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 40 °C or 1 μm fluo-4/AM (Molecular Probes) for 15 min at 40 °C. The cells were then washed and bathed in a modified HBSS (136.9 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.81 mm MgSO4, 0.44 mmKH2PO4, 0.34 mmNa2HPO4, 0.34 mmNaHCO3, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) at room temperature at least 20 min before Ca2+ measurements were made. In some experiments, a nominally Ca2+-free medium was used, which was identical in composition except for the omission of added CaCl2. In addition, calcium entry in DT-40 cells loaded with Fura-2 was determined in the presence of 0.5 mmCaCl2, whereas calcium entry with fluo-4 was determined in the presence of 0.25 mm CaCl2, in both instances to avoid saturation of the fluorescence signal due to the very large increases in [Ca2+]i in this cell type. The fluorescence intensities of Fura-2- and fluo-4-loaded DT-40 cells were monitored with a camera-based imaging system (Universal Imaging) mounted on a Zeiss Axiovert 35 inverted microscope equipped with a Zeiss × 40 (1.3 NA) fluor objective. Both fluorescence excitation and emission wavelengths were selected by filters (Chroma). For Fura-2 measurements, a Sutter Instruments filter changer enabled alternative excitation at 340 and 380 nm, and the emission fluorescence was monitored at 510 nm with a Paultek Imaging camera (model PC-20) equipped with a GenIISys intensifier (Dage-MTI, Inc.). The images of multiple cells collected at each excitation wavelength were subsequently processed using the MetaFluor software (Universal Imaging Corp., West Chester, PA) to provide ratio images. After background fluorescence correction, these images were further processed to convert the fluorescence ratios into [Ca2+] values (Kd(Fura-2) = 135 nm). Individual cells in the field of view were selected with suitable regions of interest, and their calcium changes with time were extracted. All experiments were performed at room temperature. Fluo-4 measurements were performed with the same imaging system, except single wavelength excitation was performed at 485 nm, and the emission fluorescence was monitored at 510 nm. Regions of interest were used to select Individual cells in the field of view so that the time course of changes in fluorescence intensity could be monitored and extracted. Patch clamp experiments were conducted in the standard whole cell recording configuration, using RBL-2H3 m1 cells (27Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflüg. Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15174) Google Scholar). Patch pipette (2–4 megaohms; Garner glass, type 7052) solutions contained 140 mm Cs-Asp, 2 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm MgATP, and 10 mm1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid-Cs4 (with free calcium set to 100 nm, calculated using MaxChelator software, version 6.60), pH 7.2. Bath solution (HBSS) was as described above, except CaCl2 was increased to 10 mm for calcium-HBSS, or omitted for nominally calcium-free HBSS (10 mm MgCl2 was included in nominally calcium-free HBSS). In all experiments, upon forming the whole cell configuration, the cell membrane potential was held at 0 or +20 mV. Once every 5 s, the membrane potential was stepped to −100 mV (for 20 ms to assessIcrac), and then a voltage ramp to +60 mV over a period of 160 ms was applied. Currents are normalized to cell capacitance. All voltages are corrected for a 10-mV liquid junction potential. Membrane currents were amplified with an Axopatch-1C amplifier (Axon Instruments, Burlingham, CA). Voltage clamp protocols were implemented, and data acquisition was performed with PCLAMP 6.1 software (Axon Instruments). Currents were filtered at 1 kHz and digitized at 200-μs intervals. RBL-2H3 cells were labeled with [3H]inositol and incubated in the presence or absence of methacholine, wortmannin, or both according to the protocol for examining effects on Icrac (see “Results”). 3H-Labeled lipids were extracted, deacylated, and separated by HPLC as previously described (28Anderson K.E. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Milligan G. Signal Transduction: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, London1999: 283-300Google Scholar, 29Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Cantley L.C. Irvine R.F. Methods in Inositide Research. Raven Press, New York1990: 159-166Google Scholar). The [3H]inositol-labeled polyphosphoinositide levels were determined by liquid scintillation spectroscopy of the HPLC fractions corresponding to the retention times of authentic PIP and PIP2 standards. IP3, caged IP3, ionomycin, U73122, and U73343 were from Calbiochem. Thapsigargin was from LC laboratories. Heparin and wortmannin were from Sigma. Cs4-1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid and Fura-2 were from Molecular Probes. RBL-2H3 cells have a well defined calcium release-activated calcium current (Icrac), activated upon intracellular calcium store depletion (30Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). We used the whole cell patch clamp technique to measure Icrac in RBL-2H3 cells, stably transfected with the muscarinic m1 receptor (25Choi O.H. Lee J.H. Kassessinoff T. Cunha-Melo J.R. Jones S.V. Beaven M.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 5586-5595PubMed Google Scholar). Extracellular application of ionomycin (500 nm) led to rapid and full activation of Icrac (Fig.1 A). Subsequently, extracellular application of the IP3 receptor inhibitor 2-APB (100 μm) rapidly blockedIcrac. Cells incubated with 2-APB for 3 min before exposure to ionomycin failed to show any detectable activation of Icrac (Fig. 1 B). The inhibition was not readily reversible upon removal of 2-APB (Fig. 1,A and B). In contrast to the results with 2-APB, blockade of IP3receptor function with the competitive IP3 receptor antagonist heparin (10 mg/ml) failed to block ionomycin-activatedIcrac (Fig. 1 C). Heparin is cell-impermeant and was delivered to the cell interior by inclusion in the patch pipette. An effective concentration clearly entered the cell, because 200 s after forming the whole cell mode, flash photolysis of caged IP3 (30 μm) failed to release stored calcium or activate Icrac in cells exposed to heparin (Fig. 1 D, open circles). In the absence of heparin, Icrac was readily activated by UV flash photolysis of caged IP3 (Fig.1 D, closed circles). Heparin has previously been reported to have no effect on the rise in cytosolic calcium induced by thapsigargin-activated capacitative calcium entry in mouse lacrimal cells (31Bird G. St J. Rossier M.F. Hughes A.R. Shears S.B. Armstrong D.L. Putney Jr., J.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, the IP3 receptor antagonist 2-APB (30 μm) does prevent capacitative calcium entry in response to store depletion with thapsigargin in mouse lacrimal cells (Fig. 1 E). Methacholine, a muscarinic receptor agonist, evokes a sustained rise in intracellular calcium in mouse lacrimal cells, when added at both a low (1 μm) and high (100 μm) concentration (Fig.2 A). The calcium signal is composed of the IP3-mediated release of stored calcium and plasma membrane capacitative calcium entry (32Kwan C.Y. Takemura H. Obie J.F. Thastrup O. Putney Jr., J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C1006-C1015Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We aimed to prevent this agonist response by blocking activation of PLC and IP3generation with a membrane-permeable PLC inhibitor, U73122 (33Smith R.J. Sam L.M. Justen J.M. Bundy G.L. Bala G.A. Bleasdale J.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 253: 688-697PubMed Google Scholar). A 3–5-min pretreatment of cells with 10 μmU73122 has previously been documented to fully and irreversibly prevent PLC activation upon agonist stimulation (33Smith R.J. Sam L.M. Justen J.M. Bundy G.L. Bala G.A. Bleasdale J.E. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1990; 253: 688-697PubMed Google Scholar, 34Broad L.M. Cannon T.R. Taylor C.W. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1999; 517: 121-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Likewise, a 5-min preincubation of mouse lacrimal cells with 10 μmU73122was sufficient to prevent the intracellular calcium response to low or high doses of methacholine, consistent with a blockade of agonist-activated PLC (Fig. 2 A). A 5-min pretreatment of cells with 1–5 μmU73122 resulted in variable degrees of inhibition of the calcium signal (data not shown). A 5-min preincubation of cells with 10 μmU73343, a less potent analogue of U73122, had no effect on the agonist-evoked responses (not shown). The addition of the Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin to lacrimal cells in the absence of extracellular calcium caused a transient increase in intracellular calcium, due to release of calcium from stores. Upon the addition of extracellular calcium, a second more sustained rise in intracellular calcium concentration occurs, due to calcium influx via capacitative calcium entry (Fig. 2 B). A 5-min pretreatment of cells with 10 μmU73122 had no effect on the ability of thapsigargin to release intracellular calcium stores but fully prevented the rise in intracellular calcium concentration upon the readdition of extracellular calcium (Fig.2 B). U73343 had no effect on thapsigargin-induced capacitative calcium entry (Fig. 2 B). Thus, inhibition of PLC activity with U73122 appears to result in a specific block of capacitative calcium entry after store depletion. To ensure the effects of U73122 were not indirect (for example, due to changes in cell membrane potential or stimulation of the calcium removal processes), we examined the effects of this reagent on Icrac in RBL-2H3 m1 cells, measured under voltage-clamped conditions. The extracellular addition of either thapsigargin (1 μm) or ionomycin (500 nm) was sufficient to deplete intracellular calcium stores and fully activateIcrac in control cells (Fig.3, black circles). A 5-min pretreatment of cells with U73122 (10 μm), prevented activation of Icrac upon store depletion with either thapsigargin (Fig. 3 A, open circles) or ionomycin (Fig. 3 B, open circles). A 5-min pretreatment of cells with 5 μmU73122 (a dose that failed to consistently block either agonist or thapsigargin-induced calcium signals in mouse lacrimal cells) failed to block activation ofIcrac in RBL-2H3 m1 cells, althoughIcrac was inhibited to 38 ± 4% (n = 9) of controls (see also Fig.4 B). A 5-min pretreatment of cells with the inactive analogue U73343 (10–15 μm) did not affect activation of Icrac upon store depletion with either thapsigargin or ionomycin (Fig. 3 B,gray circles).Figure 4The addition of exogenous IP3 fails to relieve the inhibition of Icracproduced by inhibition of PLC. A, RBL-2H3 m1 cells were pretreated for 5 min with either 10 μmU73122(n = 18, open symbols) or 10 μmU73343 (n = 5, gray symbols) or were untreated (n = 21,black symbols). After pretreatment, the whole cell configuration was established (time 0), and 50 or 500 μm (not shown) F-IP3 was delivered to the cell interior through the patch pipette. B, RBL-2H3 m1 cells were exposed to 5 μmU73122 for 5 min (black symbols, n = 10), after which time 500 nm ionomycin (IONO) was applied extracellularly (as indicated). After a further 200 s, 100 μmmethacholine (MeCh) was added. In control cells, not treated with U73122 (broken trace, no symbols), the addition of 100 μm methacholine 600 s after forming the whole cell mode rapidly activated Icrac. HBSS containing 10 mm calcium was replaced with nominally calcium-free HBSS at the times indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The addition of 10 μmU73122 to RBL-2H3 cells onceIcrac had been activated resulted in a much smaller inhibition of Icrac and never caused a complete block. Icrac in U73122-treated cells averaged 73 ± 12% of controls. This suggests thatIcrac is much less sensitive to inhibition of PLC once it is initiated (Fig. 3, C and D). In the context of the conformational coupling model, the apparent dependence of capacitative calcium entry on PLC might reflect a requirement for IP3 on the channel-associated IP3 receptor (6Irvine R.F. FEBS Lett. 1990; 263: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar,7Berridge M.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 23Putney Jr., J.W. Cell. 1999; 99: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, we next addressed whether the addition of exogenous IP3 to the patch pipette would overcome the block ofIcrac activation in cells treated with U73122. Intracellular delivery of F-IP3 (50 or 500 μm), a slowly metabolizable analogue of IP3, rapidly activated Icrac in control cells after forming the whole cell mode (Fig. 4 A). However, a 5-min pretre"

Cellular proteins undergo degradation in the cytosol, and the resulting peptides are transported into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),1 generally through transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP). Within the ER, the peptides are charged onto MHC I molecules. One of the key unresolved questions in this scheme pertains to the mechanism through which peptides are channeled to the TAP or other transporters. Although peptides are generated in the cytosol, there is little evidence that the cytosol harbors free peptides. It has been proposed that the peptides exist in association with peptide-binding proteins in the cytosol and the ER (1Srivastava P.K. Maki R.G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 167: 109-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 2Srivastava P.K. Udono H. Blachere N.E. Li Z. Immunogenetics. 1994; 39: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Because heat shock proteins (HSPs) are known to chaperone a wide array of molecules (3Ellis R.J. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R137-R139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and because immunological and structural evidence exists that HSPs chaperone antigenic peptides (see Ref. 4Srivastava P.K. Menoret A. Basu S. Binder R.J. McQuade K.L. Immunity. 1998; 8: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar for review), it was suggested that HSPs are the peptide-binding proteins that transport peptides (1Srivastava P.K.

Immunogenetics. 1994; 39: 93-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). This view has received little formal attention in the form of support or rejection, although no alternative mechanisms of peptide traffic have been suggested. Nonetheless, evidence has continued to accumulate that (a) HSPs are associated with peptides from a wide spectrum of antigens, including tumor antigens (5Udono H. Srivastava P.K. J. Exp.

Wahl C. Faath S. Rammensee H.-G. Schild H. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 461-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this report, we address the issue functionally and ask if the chaperoning of peptides in the cytosol by HSPs confers on the HSP-chaperoned peptides any advantage not available to unchaperoned peptides in terms of their presentability by MHC I molecules. EL4 cells were treated with brefeldin A (BFA) at two different concentrations in succession to respectively block the MHC I pathway of antigen presentation (6.0 μg/ml for 3 h) and to maintain the block (0.6 μg/ml for up to 12 h). Maintenance of the BFA block did not affect CTL function during the CTL assay. EL4 cells, untreated or treated with BFA at these concentrations, were analyzed by FACScan to show maximal decreases (∼40%) in surface expression of MHC I after 20 h (data not shown). BFA-treated cells were loaded with protein and used as targets in the CTL assay, as described, in the presence of BFA. The T-Ag-transformed cell lines SVB6 and PS-C3H were obtained from Prof. S. S. Tevethia and have been previously described (11Tevethia S.S. Lewis M. Tanaka Y. Milici B.K. Maloy W.L. Anderson R. J.

Rose J.K. Lefrancois L. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 708-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). EL4 cells and the TAP-dysfunctional cell line, RMA-S, were obtained from Prof. S. Nathenson. The RMA cell line has been previously described (13Lunggren H.-G. Karre K. J. Exp. Med. 1985; 162: 1745-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar). All chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. unless otherwise specified. HL-1 and RPMI media, together with pyruvate, glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin, and non-essential amino acids were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. RPMI containing 5% fetal calf serum (Intergen) and 1% each of pyruvate, glutamine, penicillin-streptomycin, and non-essential amino acids is subsequently referred to as complete RPMI. HSPs were detected by immunoblotting with specific antibodies: gp96 (rat monoclonal antibody SPA-850, clone 9G10); cytosolic hsp70 (mouse monoclonal antibody SPA-820, clone N27F3-4 recognizes constitutive hsp73 and inducible hsp72); hsp90 (rat monoclonal antibody SPA-845, clone 1R2D12p90). All these antibodies were purchased from StressGen Biotechnologies Corp., Victoria, Canada. Anti-Kb, anti-Db, anti-Dd, or anti-LFA-1 (clones AF6-88-5, KH95, 34-2-12, and 2D7, respectively)-fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibodies were obtained from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). To prepare proteins (gp96, hsp70, hsp90, or SA; complexed or not) for loading, the indicated amount of protein was incubated with DOTAP (N-[-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate (C43H83NO8S)) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at a 3:2 ratio (microgram amounts) for 15 min at room temperature. In all loading experiments, 1.5 × 106 cells (EL4, RMA, or RMA-S) were washed three times with serum-free HL-1 media and then incubated in 1 ml of HL-1 media with a protein:DOTAP combination for 4–4.5 h at 37 °C. Control cells were either mock-loaded by incubating 1.5 × 106 cells in the same amount of DOTAP alone or were incubated with protein alone in the absence of DOTAP (pulsed cells). After loading (or mock loading for controls), cells were washed three times with HL-1 media and once with complete RPMI. Where indicated, loaded, mock-loaded, or pulsed cells were used as targets in CTL assays. Loading efficiencies of gp96, hsp70, hsp90, or serum albumin alone were the same, and inter-experimental values did not vary significantly. Free peptides were loaded into cells using the same protocol. CTL assays were carried out as follows. Briefly 2 × 103 51chromium (supplied as Na2CrO4; ICN) labeled target cells in 100 μl of complete RPMI were added to various dilutions of T-Ag or VSV8-specific CTL in 100 μl of complete RPMI, as indicated by the effector-to-target ratios. Effectors and targets were cultured in v-bottomed 96-well plates for 4 h. Supernatants (50 μl) were harvested, mixed with scintillation fluid, and counted in a 1450 MicroBeta Trilux liquid scintillation counter (Wallac Inc.). Percent specific 51Cr release was measured as follows, Exerimental51Cr release−spontaneous51Cr releaseMaximum51Cr release−spontaneous51Cr release×100%Equation 1 Maximum and spontaneous releases were measured by culturing 2 × 103 labeled target cells in lysis buffer (0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl) and complete RPMI, respectively, for 4 h. VSV8-specific CTL were obtained by dual immunizations of C57BL/6 mice, 1 week apart, with N1 cells. Spleen cells were harvested 1 week after the second immunization, restimulated in culture with irradiated N1 cells, and cloned by limiting dilution (14Heike M. Blachere N.E. Wolfel T. Meyer zum Buschenfelde K.H. Storkel S. Srivastava P.K. J. Immunother. Emphas. Tumor Immunol. 1994; 15: 165-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The specificity of the CTL clone was tested by cold target inhibition and antibody blocking experiments. This CTL clone was shown to be specific for the VSV8 peptide (NH2-RGYVYQGL-COOH) bound to Kbmolecules. A similar strategy, with SVB6 cells, was used to obtain the T-Ag-specific CTL clone. This clone was shown to be specific for the 9-mer peptide (NH2-AINNYAQKL-COOH), previously named epitope 1 (11Tevethia S.S. Lewis M. Tanaka Y. Milici B.K. Maloy W.L. Anderson R. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1192-1200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). N1 cells were irradiated (5000 rads) and allowed to recover in AIM V medium with or without DSG for 48 h at 37 °C or 25 °C. Half of the cells incubating at 25 °C were then placed at 37 °C for an additional 8 h. One group of the cells not treated with DSG but incubated at 25 °C for 48 h was placed at 37 °C in the presence of DSG for 8 h. Cells (1 × 106) were then stained at 4 °C for 40 min with anti-Kb, anti-Db, anti-Dd, or anti-LFA fluorescein-conjugated antibodies and analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer purchased from Becton Dickinson (San Jose, CA). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% saponin and probed with anti-VSV glycoprotein Cy3-coupled antibody (Sigma). Cells were visualized using a Zeiss LSM confocal microscope. Vesicular stomatis virus (VSV) was obtained from Advanced Biotechnology (Columbia, MD). Meth A or EL4 cells were incubated with 10 plaque forming units of VSV per cell for 1 h at 37 °C in plain RPMI and allowed to recover in RPMI with 10% fetal calf serum for 4 h. Cells were washed three times in PBS (10 mmphosphate buffer, 150 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCL, pH 7.4). gp96 was then purified from these cells as described below. The following peptides were used (underlinedsequences represent the precise MHC I binding epitope): unextended MHC binding 9-mer, NH2-AINNYAQKL-COOH; T-Ag 20-mer (N terminus extended), NH2-FFLTPHRHRVS- AINNYAQKL-COOH; T-Ag 20-mer (N+C termini extended), NH2-RHRVSAINNYAQKLCTFSFL-COOH; T-Ag 20-mer (C terminus extended), NH2-AINNYAQKLCTFSFLICKGV-COOH. Peptides were synthesized by Genemed to >95% purity as determined by high pressure liquid chromatography. The unextended MHC I binding 9-mer peptide is identical to epitope I of the T-Ag (11Tevethia S.S. Lewis M. Tanaka Y. Milici B.K. Maloy W.L. Anderson R. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1192-1200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The T-Ag 9-mer stabilized MHC I molecules on RMA-S cells and sensitized targets for lysis by the T-Ag-specific CTL. All three T-Ag 20-mer peptides failed to bind MHC H-2Db as determined by their inability to stabilize empty MHC molecules on the surface of RMA-S cells and their inability to sensitize target cells for lysis by T-Ag-specific CTL. Purified gp96 or hsp90 was incubated, at the indicated amount, with peptide at a protein-to-peptide molar ratio of 1:50 in 700 μl of PBS for 10 min at 50 °C and incubated for a further 30 min at room temperature. The peptide concentration used for complexing was 10−6 m. Approximately 1% of the gp96 or hsp90 molecules was loaded with the exogenous peptides by this method (15Blachere N.E. Li Z. Chandawarkar R.Y. Suto R. Jaikaria N.S. Basu S. Udono H. Srivastava P.K. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). The indicated amount of purified hsp70 or SA was incubated with peptide at a protein-to-peptide molar ratio of 1:50 in 300 μl of PBS at 37 °C for 1 h. Peptide concentration used for complexing was 10−6 m. To remove free, uncomplexed peptides, complexes were washed extensively with PBS in an Ultrafree-4 centrifugal device, Biomax 10K NMWL membrane (Millipore Corp.). To determine the efficiency of complexing, peptides were labeled with125I (ICN) using IODO-BEADs (Pierce). In parallel with unlabeled peptides, 125I-labeled peptides were complexed to proteins and checked by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (data not shown). The efficiency of gp96, hsp70, hsp90, or SA to complex peptides was comparable. EL4 cells (107) in complete RPMI were treated for 2 h with 100 μm of the proteasome inhibitorN-acetyl-l-leucinyl-l-leucinal-l-norleucinal (LLnL) in Me2SO or with 0.002% Me2SO alone. In other experiments, EL4 cells were treated with 100 μmlactacystin dissolved in Me2SO for 1 h. In both cases, the treated cells were constantly in the presence of the inhibitor during loading with protein. FACScan analysis of inhibitor-treated cells showed greater than 35% decrease in cell surface MHC I expression after 20 h confirming inhibition of MHC I trafficking. hsp70 and gp96 were purified from cells according to previously described methods (16Peng P. Menoret A. Srivastava P.K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 204: 13-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 17Srivastava P.K. Immunology Methods Manual. Academic Press Ltd., New York1997: 739-747Google Scholar). hsp90 was purified according to the protocol of Denis (18Denis M. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 173: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, 100,000 × g supernatants were obtained from cell lysates and applied to a Mono Q column (Mono Q HR 16/10, purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and attached to the BIOCAD, Perseptive Biosytems). 15-Deoxyspergualin (DSG) was a gift from Dr. S. Nadler at Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (Wallingford, CT). Lyophilized DSG was dissolved in PBS and stored in aliquots at a concentration of 10 mg/ml at −130 °C. Twenty micrograms per ml of DSG, with or without peptide (final concentration of 1 μm), was added to the MLTC of VSV CTL clones. After a 5-day incubation at 37 °C, each well of the MLTC was harvested and tested for its ability to lyse51Cr-labeled N1 and EL4 cells in a 4-h 51Cr release assay. The cationic liposome, DOTAP, was used to introduce HSP·peptide complexes or free peptides into the cytosol. Distinct properties of the detergents Nonidet P-40 and Saponin were used to demonstrate that DOTAP-loaded gp96 enters the soluble, non-vesicular, cytosolic compartment of the cells (Fig.1). Although the cytosolic HSPs are of primary interest in this study, gp96 was used as a test case, because its distinct non-cytosolic localization (in the ER) permitted determination of the compartment into which the HSP·peptide complexes were being introduced, as will become clear from the following. The gp96/DOTAP-loaded cells were lysed with each of two detergents. Lysis of live cells with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 leads to solubilization of all non-nuclear membranes, whereas lysis with 0.01% Saponin results in solubilization of plasma membranes but not internal membranes (19Forster C. Marienfeld S. Wilhelm R. Kramer R. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1998; 167: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The lysates were centrifuged to obtain the solubilized components, which were analyzed for the presence of gp96 by immunoblotting: The internal resident gp96 is detected in the Nonidet P-40-lysates of non-loaded cells (Fig. 1, lane 1) but not in the Saponin-lysed non-loaded cells (Fig. 1, lanes 2 and 3), because gp96 is a luminal component of the ER compartment, which remains impervious to Saponin. gp96 is not detected in cells treated with DOTAP without gp96 (lane 2) or gp96 without DOTAP (lane 3). The only instance where gp96 is detectable in the Saponin-solubilized cells is if it has been introduced along with DOTAP into cells (lane 4), i.e. from an exogenous source. As additional controls, all samples tested predictably positive for the cytosolic chaperone hsp70 (Fig. 1, bottom panel,lanes 1–4). Thus, DOTAP-mediated delivery of gp96 (and by deduction other proteins) into cells introduces them into the cytosolic compartment. Similar results were obtained with introduction of labeled peptides by DOTAP. Quantitative analysis of exogenously introduced radiolabeled proteins through DOTAP indicated that ∼5% of the DOTAP-loaded protein is introduced into the cytosol and that >96% of this 5% is detected in a soluble, non-vesicular, cytosolic compartment of the cells (data not shown). As discussed in the previous section, the cytosolic chaperones hsp90 and hsp70 are of primary interest for the studies described all through this report. However, the ER chaperone gp96 was also used in all studies, primarily because (i) gp96 was used for the demonstration that DOTAP introduces proteins into the cytosol, (ii) gp96 is highly homologous (protein sequence homology of 50%) (see Ref.1Srivastava P.K. Maki R.G. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1991; 167: 109-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) to the cytosolic chaperone hsp90, and (iii) considerable immunological and structural information on gp96-peptide interaction is already available (see Ref. 4Srivastava P.K. Menoret A. Basu S. Binder R.J. McQuade K.L. Immunity. 1998; 8: 1-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). gp96, purified from the T-Ag-transformed cell line SVB6, and chaperoning T-Ag-derived peptides was loaded into EL4 cells by DOTAP. Presentation of T antigen-derived peptides by MHC I molecules of EL4 cells was monitored by specific lysis of DOTAP-loaded cells using a CTL clone specific for epitope 1 of the T-Ag (11Tevethia S.S. Lewis M. Tanaka Y. Milici B.K. Maloy W.L. Anderson R. J. Virol. 1990; 64: 1192-1200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The T-Ag-derived peptides were present in gp96 preparations and were observed to be efficiently re-presented in this assay (Fig. 2 A). Percentage of lysis of the loaded cells increased with increasing amounts of gp96 loaded into the cells. No lysis was observed with less than 25 μg of gp96. In parallel control experiments, EL4 cells were pulsed, in the absence of DOTAP (as opposed to loaded) with gp96, to determine if there is extracellular exchange of peptides between gp96 and surface MHC I molecules on EL4 cells. No surface charging was detected. SVB6-derived hsp70 or hsp90 preparations were also loaded into EL4 cells in increasing doses. Antigen-specific recognition of the loaded cells by CTLs was observed when either hsp70 or hsp90 was loaded (Fig.2 A), indicating that similar to gp96, hsp70 or hsp90 donate their chaperoned peptides to become ligands for MHC I molecules. Again, lysis of cells was dependent on the amount of HSP loaded by DOTAP. Although peptides chaperoned by all three HSPs could become ligands for re-presentation by MHC I molecules, the efficiency of doing so was different for each HSP. For comparable lysis (∼40%) of HSP-loaded cells, 100, 250, and 500 μg of gp96, hsp70, and hsp90, respectively, were required. Approximate amounts of HSP, below which no lysis was detected were 25, 180, and 400 μg for gp96, hsp70, and hsp90, respectively. A second, well characterized antigenic system, the Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) system, was used to test the generality of the observation in the T-Ag system. VSV nucleoprotein (VSVNP) derived peptides chaperoned by gp96 or hsp70 (purified from the VSVNP-transfected cell line N1 (12Puddington L. Bevan M.J. Rose J.K. Lefrancois L. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 708-717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are effectively re-presented and recognized by VSVNP-specific CTL after the respective HSPs are introduced into the cytosol of EL4 cells by DOTAP (Fig. 2 B). To demonstrate that lysis by VSVNP-specific CTL, of cells loaded with HSPs, is peptide-dependent, equivalent amounts of peptide-free hsp70, obtained by ATP treatment of N1-derived hsp70 preparations (15Blachere N.E. Li Z. Chandawarkar R.Y. Suto R. Jaikaria N.S. Basu S. Udono H. Srivastava P.K. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar), were delivered into EL4 cells. No lysis of EL4 cells loaded with peptide-depleted hsp70 preparations was observed (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, HSP preparations not carrying VSVNP-derived peptides (EL4-derived HSPs) (Fig. 2 B), did not render loaded cells susceptible to VSVNP-specific CTLs, with any amount of HSP loaded. The results imply that presentation and consequent cell lysis are both peptide-dependent and -specific and require intracellular processing of the HSP·peptide complexes. It is difficult to monitor and quantify presentation of specific antigenic peptides in naturally derived HSP·peptide complexes. To quantitate the efficiency of re-presentation of specific HSP-chaperoned peptides, HSPs reconstitutedin vitro with known quantity of antigenic peptides or their extended versions were used. The Db-restricted 9-mer epitope I of the SV40 T-Ag protein (NH2-AINNYAQKL-COOH), or 20-mer peptides extended on the NH2 terminus, COOH terminus, or both termini (Fig.3 A) were complexed to HSPs gp96, hsp90, or hsp70, or a control peptide-binding protein serum albumin (SA) (15 and “Experimental Procedures”). Peptides thus complexed (∼10−8 m with respect to peptide concentration) or free peptides (10−6 or 10−4 m) were loaded into EL4 cells with DOTAP. In parallel, experiments using radiolabeled HSPs, SA, and each of the peptides were used to determine how much of each moiety administered with DOTAP could be recovered in the cytosol of the cells. This exercise demonstrated that ∼6–8% of the quantity of each moiety introduced in the cells by DOTAP could be recovered from the cytosol (data not shown). The constancy of this number allows for valid comparisons among the results with each antigenic moiety. The cells into which the HSPs, SA, or peptides were introduced were then monitored for lysis by T-Ag-specific CTLs (Fig. 3 B). It was observed that (i) a concentration of 10−4 m free peptide was required for loading to observe lysis of the EL4 cells comparable to that observed for 10−8 m concentration of peptide when chaperoned by HSPs, (ii) peptides chaperoned by SA, which binds peptides efficiently (“Experimental Procedures”), were not re-presented by MHC I molecules, suggesting that HSPs play a role different from simply carrying the peptides, and (iii) MHC I epitopes are generated from peptides chaperoned by HSPs regardless of whether they are extended on the NH2, COOH, or both termini. The cytosolic proteasomes have been implicated as the primary producers of peptide ligands for MHC I molecules (for review see Refs. 20Monaco J.J. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 173-179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar, 21Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. Nature. 1992; 357: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Because DOTAP-mediated loading of cells with the HSP·peptide complexes results in presentation the peptides by MHC I, we tested the requirement for proteasomal activity for re-presentation of HSP-chaperoned peptides. Because HSPs are purified from cells after the peptides have been generated through protease activity and also have been shown to chaperone precise MHC I peptide epitopes (6Ishii T. Udono H.

Immunol. 1998; 28: 1016-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), we expected that re-presentation of HSP-chaperoned peptides would not require further proteasomal action. EL4 cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor, N-acetyl-Leu-Leu-norleucinal (LLnL) for 1 h prior to and during loading with either the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone gp96 or the cytosolic chaperone hsp70 derived from N1 cells. Surprisingly, re-presentation of VSVNP peptides chaperoned by gp96 or hsp70 was inhibited by LLnL (Fig.4 A), suggesting that re-presentation of HSP-chaperoned peptides requires functional protease activity. Control, LLnL-untreated EL4 cells loaded with gp96 or hsp70 in an identical manner were able to re-present VSVNP-derived peptides. Because LLnL has been shown to have inhibitory effects on proteases other than the proteasome (22Craiu A. Gaczynska M. Akopian T. Gramm C.F. Fenteany G. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 172: 13437-13445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (349) Google Scholar), we replaced LLnL with the proteasome-specific inhibitor, lactacystin. To examine the proteasome dependence of HSP-chaperoned peptide re-presentation more precisely, we used HSP·peptide complexes reconstituted in vitro instead of the naturally derived complexes. The four T-Ag-derived peptides used earlier (Fig. 3 A) were complexed separately to gp96, hsp70, hsp90, or the non-HSP, SA. HSP·peptide complexes, reconstitutedin vitro, were loaded independently but identically, into EL4 cells, not treated or treated with lactacystin prior to loading. It was observed (Table I) that (i) treatment with lactacystin inhibited re-presentation of all theextended peptides, (ii) surprisingly, treatment of cells with lactacystin inhibited re-presentation of even theprecise unextended MHC I-binding peptides when chaperoned by hsp70 or hsp90; (iii) in another surprise, re-presentation of the precise MHC I binding peptide complexed to gp96 was not inhibited by lactacystin. These observations suggest that, during re-presentation, proteasomes may contribute function(s) other than proteolytic degradation of extended peptides. They also suggest that peptides chaperoned by the ER HSP, gp96, are processed by a different mechanism from that of peptides chaperoned by the cytosolic hsp70 and hsp90. The structural basis for this difference is not yet clear.Table IInfluence of inhibition of functional proteasomes by lactacystin on re-presentation of precise and extended peptides chaperoned by HSPsChaperonePeptidesN-extended, 20-merN+C-extended, 20-merC-extended, 20-merDb-binding, 9-mer%gp9660.196.081.00hsp9061.298.098.271.1hsp7090.198.365.346.1Data are percent inhibition of re-presentation.

https://openalex.org/W2155614325,"The minichromosome maintenance (MCM) proteins, together with the origin recognition complex (ORC) proteins and Cdc6, play an essential role in eukaryotic DNA replication through the formation of a pre-replication complex at origins of replication. We used a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify MCM2-interacting proteins. One of the proteins we identified is identical to the ORC1-interacting protein termed HBO1. HBO1 belongs to the MYST family, characterized by a highly conserved C2HC zinc finger and a putative histone acetyltransferase domain. Biochemical studies confirmed the interaction between MCM2 and HBO1 in vitro and in vivo. An N-terminal domain of MCM2 is necessary for binding to HBO1, and a C2HC zinc finger of HBO1 is essential for binding to MCM2. A reverse yeast two-hybrid selection was performed to isolate an allele of MCM2 that is defective for interaction with HBO1; this allele was then used to isolate a suppressor mutant of HBO1 that restores the interaction with the mutant MCM2. This suppressor mutation was located in the HBO1 zinc finger. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that the interaction between MCM2 and HBO1 is direct and mediated by the C2HC zinc finger of HBO1. The biochemical and genetic interactions of MYST family protein HBO1 with two components of the replication apparatus, MCM2 and ORC1, suggest that HBO1-associated HAT activity may play a direct role in the process of DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W2001537741,"Recent studies have provided evidence that breast cancer susceptibility gene products (Brca1 and Brca2) suppress cancer, at least in part, by participating in DNA damage signaling and DNA repair. Brca1 is hyperphosphorylated in response to DNA damage and co-localizes with Rad51, a protein involved in homologous-recombination, and Nbs1·Mre11·Rad50, a complex required for both homologous-recombination and nonhomologous end joining repair of damaged DNA. Here, we report that there is a qualitative difference in the phosphorylation states of Brca1 between ionizing radiation (IR) and UV radiation. Brca1 is phosphorylated at Ser-1423 and Ser-1524 after IR and UV; however, Ser-1387 is specifically phosphorylated after IR, and Ser-1457 is predominantly phosphorylated after UV. These results suggest that different types of DNA-damaging agents might signal to Brca1 in different ways. We also provide evidence that the rapid phosphorylation of Brca1 at Ser-1423 and Ser-1524 after IR (but not after UV) is largely ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase-dependent. The overexpression of catalytically inactive ATM and Rad3 related (ATR) kinase inhibited the UV-induced phosphorylation of Brca1 at these sites, indicating that ATR controls Brca1 phosphorylation in vivo after the exposure of cells to UV light. Moreover, ATR associates with Brca1; ATR and Brca1 foci co-localize both in cells synchronized in S phase and after exposure of cells to DNA-damaging agents. ATR can itself phosphorylate the region of Brca1 phosphorylated by ATM (Ser-Gln cluster in the C terminus of Brca1, amino acids 1241–1530). However, there are additional uncharacterized ATR phosphorylation site(s) between residues 521 and 757 of Brca1.

Cells respond to DNA damage by activating a complex DNA damage-response pathway that includes cell cycle arrest, transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of genes associated with repair, and under some circumstances, the triggering of programmed cell death. Biochemically, the DNA damage-response pathway provides a mechanism for transducing a signal from a sensor that recognizes the damage, through a transduction cascade, to a series of downstream effector molecules, which implement the appropriate response. At or close to the top of this pathway in mammalian cells are the members of the phosphoinositide kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family, which includes ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ATM and Rad3 related). These proteins play important roles in signaling the presence of DNA damage, activating cell cycle checkpoints, and repairing DNA (1Lavin M.F. Khanna K.K. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1999; 75: 1201-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). ATM is homozygously mutated in the germline of patients with the neurodegenerative and cancer predisposition syndrome, ataxia telangiectasia (AT). Cells derived from AT patients are hypersensitive to agents that cause double strand breaks in DNA, such as IR, but retain normal resistance to UV and other damaging agents. AT cells exhibit cell cycle defects at multiple checkpoints (G1/S, intra S, and G2/M) in response to IR. ATM-deficient mice are viable but show growth retardation and a cancer predisposition. In mammals, ATM is an upstream regulator of p53, c-Abl, Chk2 (hCds1), Brca1, and nibrin in response to IR (2Khanna K.K. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 2000; 92: 795-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar, 3Zhou B.B. Elledge S.J. Nature. 2000; 408: 433-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar). Less is known about ATR because no ATR mutations have been detected in human diseases. However, the overexpression of the dominant negative ATR derivative in mammalian cells sensitizes them to a range of DNA-damaging agents (4Cliby W.A. Roberts C.J. Cimprich K.A. Stringer C.M.

We and others have recently provided evidence that ATM and ATM-dependent kinase Chk2 mediate the phosphorylation of Brca1 after IR (10Cortez D. Wang Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J.

ATM is required only for the rapid and immediate phosphorylation of Brca1 after IR because Brca1 is still phosphorylated in ATM-null cells, albeit with delayed kinetics (11Gatei M. Scott S.P.

Furthermore, the phosphorylation of Brca1 after UV and hydroxyurea is ATM-independent (13Chen J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5037-5039PubMed Google Scholar) and probably mediated by ATR because ATM and ATR have been shown to have overlapping substrate specificity in vitro (14Kim S.T. Lim D.S. Canman C.E. Katan M.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37538-37543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (644) Google Scholar). Despite the apparent overlap of function between ATM and ATR, it has been clearly shown that the immediate phosphorylation of p53 in response to IR is largely ATM-dependent, whereas ATR mediates the UV-induced rapid phosphorylation of p53. Recently, evidence has been presented that ATR regulates the phosphorylation of human Chk1 in response to UV treatment (15Liu Q. Guntuku S. Cui X.S. Matsuoka S. Cortez D. Tamai K. Luo G. Carattini-Rivera S. De Maya F. Bradley A. Donehower L.A. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1448-1459Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the role of ATR in UV-induced modifications of Brca1. During the preparation of this manuscript, similar studies have suggested the role of ATR in Brca1 phosphorylation (13Chen J. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5037-5039PubMed Google Scholar, 16Tibbetts R.S. Cortez D. Brumbaugh K.M. Scully R. Livingston D.M. Elledge S.J. Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 2989-3002Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). However, using phospho-specific antibodies, our results provided further details of BRCA1 phosphorylations at various sites by ATM and ATR. We found that ATM and ATR, in addition to their shared phosphorylation sites, also phosphorylate distinctively different sites in BRCA1 in vivo. Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines generated from normal controls and AT patients have been described previously (17Shafman T. Khanna K.K. Keder P. Spring K. Kozlov S. Yen T. Hobson K. Gatei M. Zhang N. Watters D. Egerton M. Shiloh Y. Kharbanda S. Kufe D. Lavin M.F. Nature. 1997; 387: 520-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). The generation and characterization of GM847 cells that express wild-type (wt) or kinase-dead (kd) ATR under the control of the bacterial tet operator have been described previously (4Cliby W.A. Roberts C.J. Cimprich K.A. Stringer C.M. Lamb J.R. Schreiber S.L. Friend S.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Lymphoblastoid cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. The SV40-transformed GM847 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. Following transfection, cells were grown in complete medium containing G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). The expression of wt and kd ATR was induced by incubating the cells in culture medium containing 1 mm doxycycline (Sigma) for 48 h. Cells were grown to 80% confluence and then treated with either IR or UV light. The indicated cells were irradiated (6 Gy) with a 137Cs γ-ray source or exposed to UV-C (80 J/m2). Phospho-specific antibodies against ATM phosphorylation sites in BRCA1 (anti-Ser-1423, anti-Ser-1457, and anti-Ser-1387) have been described previously (11Gatei M. Scott S.P. Filippovitch I. Soronika N. Lavin M.F. Weber B. Khanna K.K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3299-3304PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-phospho-Ser-1524 rabbit antiserum was generated in this study by immunizing with keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated phosphopeptide (QNRNYP-Phospho-Ser(P)-QEELIK). Bleeds were assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the serum was collected on days corresponding to the peak antibody response and then affinity-purified against the same peptide. The affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies recognized the phosphorylated form of a Brca1 peptide but not the unphosphorylated form employing an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Anti-BRCA1 monoclonal antibodies (Ab-1) and anti-ATR polyclonal antibodies were from Oncogene Science, Inc. (Manhasset, NY). Anti-FLAG was purchased from Sigma. A series of glutathioneS-transferase (GST)-BRCA1 fusion proteins was generated and purified as described previously (11Gatei M. Scott S.P. Filippovitch I. Soronika N. Lavin M.F. Weber B. Khanna K.K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3299-3304PubMed Google Scholar). Cellular extracts were prepared by resuspending the cells in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mmNaF, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium orthovandate, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/m1 leupeptin, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 0.3% Nonidet P-40) and incubating on ice for 30 min. Supernatants were collected following centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min. 40 μg of protein/sample was then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with the appropriate antibodies. For co-immunoprecipitations, protein samples were precleared with protein A beads for 1 h at 4 C. The supernatants were then incubated with the required antibody for 2 h. The immune complexes were collected with protein A- and G-Sepharose beads. The complexes were washed twice with lysis buffer and then fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for immunoblot analysis. For kinase assays, cells were lysed in TGN buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Tween 20, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovandate, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmdithiothreitol) as described previously (18Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Siliciano J.D. Science. 1998; 281: 1677-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (1705) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitation was carried out as described above using either anti-ATR or anti-FLAG antibodies. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with TGN buffer, once with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.5 mLiCl, and twice with kinase buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2, 5 μm ATP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Kinase reactions were prepared by resuspending washed beads in 30 μl of kinase buffer containing 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 1 μg of GST-BRCA1 fusion protein. Immune complex reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. Cells were synchronized by a double thymidine block at the G1/S transition and then released into thymidine-free medium for a synchronous passage through S phase. 2 h after release, cells were either left untreated or irradiated at 10 Gy, and 4 h after exposure, cells were fixed in methanol:acetone (1:1) at −20 °C, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and blocked with a blocking solution (3% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton in phosphate-buffered saline). For double labeling with rabbit (anti-ATR) and mouse (anti-Brca1) antibodies, cells were incubated with a mixture of antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C. Cells were then washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with a mixture of fluorescein-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) and indocarbocyanine-labeled anti-mouse IgG (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) for 30 min. After extensive washing, samples were mounted onto glass slides with a drop of anti-fade mounting reagent (Vectashield, Vector Laboratories). Samples were analyzed with a confocal laser scanning microscope (Bio-Rad). Images were digitally captured and overlaid using the RGB function of Adobe Photoshop. We previously raised anti-phospho-specific antibodies against three of the ATM phosphorylation sites in Brca1 (Ser-1387, Ser-1423, and Ser-1457). In this report, polyclonal rabbit antibodies against an additional ATM phosphorylation site in Brca1 (Ser-1524) were produced, affinity-purified, and termed α-1524. In the present study, we monitored the phosphorylation of Brca1 in intact cells by using the phospho-specific antibodies. Control and AT cells were exposed to IR (6 Gy) or UV radiation (80 J/m2), and the cells were harvested for Western blot analysis 30 min after damage. The Brca1 protein level and phosphorylation state were then analyzed by Western blotting by using anti-Brca1 (Ab-1, Oncogene Science) or phospho-specific antibodies (α-1387, α-1423, α-1457, and α-1524) against ATM phosphorylation sites in Brca1. In agreement with our earlier study (11Gatei M. Scott S.P. Filippovitch I. Soronika N. Lavin M.F. Weber B. Khanna K.K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3299-3304PubMed Google Scholar), Brca1 phosphorylation after IR but not after UV was ATM-dependent (Fig.1). The α-1524 and α-1423 antibodies detected an increased level of phosphorylation of Brca1 after UV and IR. The IR-induced phosphorylation was clearly ATM-dependent because ATM-deficient cells (L3) failed to show increased phosphorylation at these sites; however, UV-C-induced phosphorylation was ATM-independent. Immunoblotting with α-1457 also revealed dramatically increased levels of phosphorylated Brca1 in response to UV but not in response to IR (Fig. 1). Again, this UV-C-induced increase was ATM-independent. However, previously (11Gatei M. Scott S.P. Filippovitch I. Soronika N. Lavin M.F. Weber B. Khanna K.K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3299-3304PubMed Google Scholar) we have shown that α-1457 did detect phosphorylated Brca1 after IR when Brca1 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysate (1 mg) with anti-Brca1 antibody (Ab-1) followed by blotting with α-1457. These results suggest that only a small fraction of Brca1 is phosphorylated at this site after IR, which is below the threshold level of detection after straight Western blot. However, a significant proportion of Brca1 is phosphorylated at Ser-1457 after UV. By contrast the α-1387 antibodies detected an increase in Brca1 phosphorylation after IR but not after UV radiation. Both ATM and ATR are members of the PIKK family and contribute to the phosphorylation and accumulation of p53 after cellular exposure to γ and UV radiation, respectively (19Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3471-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar, 20Tibbetts R.S. Brumbaugh K.M. Williams J.M. Sarkaria J.N. Cliby W.A. Shieh S.Y. Taya Y. Prives C. Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). No ATR mutations have so far been documented in human disease; therefore, human cell lines that carry mutant ATR are not available. Furthermore, a homozygous knockout of ATR in mice is embryonic lethal (5Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 397-402PubMed Google Scholar, 6de Klein A. Muijtjens M. van Os R. Verhoeven Y. Smit B. Carr A.M. Lehmann A.R. Hoeijmakers J.H. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 479-482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Therefore, for this study we have used cells transfected with FLAG-tagged kd ATR, which has previously been shown to exert a dominant negative effect (4Cliby W.A. Roberts C.J. Cimprich K.A. Stringer C.M. Lamb J.R. Schreiber S.L. Friend S.H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 159-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Cells were induced with 1 mmdoxycycline for 48 h to allow the expression of transfected cDNA prior to harvesting. Western blotting of cell lysates using anti-FLAG antibody revealed the presence of ectopic ATR protein induced with doxycycline (Fig. 2 A). This protein was not detected in untransfected GM847 cells. Immunoblotting of cell lysates with the anti-ATR antibody, which recognizes both endogenous and ectopic ATR, revealed an approximately 2–3-fold increase in ATR protein expression after the cells were induced with doxycycline (Fig. 2 A). The extracts from uninduced and induced cells transfected with kd ATR, with and without prior exposure to IR (6 Gy) and UV (80 J/m2), were analyzed for damage-induced modifications of Brca1 by Western blotting with α-Brca1 (Ab-1) and various anti-phospho-specific antibodies (α-1524, α-1457, α-1423, and α-1387) against Brca1. The results, shown in Fig. 2 B, clearly demonstrate that the immediate UV-induced mobility shift of Brca1 is compromised in cells overexpressing kd ATR protein. This is reflected as the markedly reduced phosphorylation of Brca1 on serine residues 1524, 1423, and 1457 in these cells in response to UV (but not IR), suggesting thereby that rapid UV-induced modifications of Brca1 are dependent upon the presence of functional ATR kinase. Recently it has been shown that Brca1 exists as a part of a complex designated Brca1-associated genome surveillance complex that includes putative DNA damage sensors such as ATM (21Wang Y. Cortez D. Yazdi P. Neff N. Elledge S.J. Qin J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 927-939Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Therefore, we were interested in determining whether ATR exists in complex with Brca1. To study this association, cell lysates were co-immunoprecipitated with either anti-Brca1 or anti-ATR antibodies. The immunoblot analysis of the ATR immunoprecipitates with anti-Brca1 antibody demonstrated an interaction between the two proteins in control and AT cell lines, indicating that the interaction between ATR and Brca1 is ATM-independent (Fig.3 A). Similar results were obtained when Brca1 immunoprecipitates were blotted with the ATR antibody. The specificity of this association was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with nonspecific immunoglobulin, which failed to show an ATR or Brca1 band after blotting with the respective antibodies (results not shown). We next sought to examine whether ATR and Brca1 co-localize in cells with or without the prior treatment of cells with DNA damage. Prior to DNA damage, the majority of cells stained with anti-ATR antibodies indicated a nuclear diffuse pattern of staining. However, about 15% of the cells exhibit a punctate pattern (foci) of staining in the nucleus (data not shown). The synchronization of cells in S phase by a double thymidine block caused a dramatic increase in the proportion of cells exhibiting ATR foci (Fig. 3 B). In synchronized cells, ATR foci overlapped Brca1 foci. The staining pattern of ATR and Brca1 also overlapped extensively at 4 h after the treatment of cells with IR and UV (Fig. 3 B), indicating that the damage-induced modification of Brca1 by ATR might contribute to changes in Brca1 subnuclear localization after DNA damage. To investigate this possibility, we sought to examine whether the phosphorylated Brca1 is a part of the Brca1 foci induced after DNA damage by using a phospho-specific antibody against Ser-1524. Most of the undamaged cells (>85%) stained negative for the α-Ser-1524 antibody; however, by 4 h after the treatment of cells with IR or UV, >80% of cells exhibited the presence of phosphorylated Brca1 as nuclear foci (Fig. 3 B). Most of the foci observed after staining cells with the anti-Brca1 antibody (which detects both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated Brca1) co-localized with the foci observed with the phospho-specific antibody, indicating that the phosphorylation of Brca1 at Ser-1524 may be essential for regulating the localization of Brca1. To test whether Brca1 is a direct target for the protein kinase activity of ATR, we used a series of recombinant GST-Brca1 fragments (B1F1–B1F7) covering the entire open reading frame (11Gatei M. Scott S.P. Filippovitch I. Soronika N. Lavin M.F. Weber B. Khanna K.K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3299-3304PubMed Google Scholar). Kinase reactions were performed with purified immunoprecipitated ATR with or without prior exposure to UV. Immunoprecipitated ATR from control lymphoblastoid cell lines phosphorylated the region in Brca1, B1F6 (amino acids 1241–1530 (Fig. 3 C)); the same region was previously shown to be phosphorylated by ATM (11Gatei M. Scott S.P. Filippovitch I. Soronika N. Lavin M.F. Weber B. Khanna K.K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3299-3304PubMed Google Scholar). This activity was also observed against an additional Brca1 fusion protein not phosphorylated by ATM, B1F3 (amino acids 521–757 (Fig.3 C)). None of the other Brca1-GST fusion proteins were phosphorylated by ATR. Immunoprecipitated ATR from ATM-deficient cells showed a similar phosphorylation of fragments 3 and 6 (data not shown), indicating that the activation of ATR is independent of ATM expression in cells. Although ATR is activated in vivo after the UV-C treatment of cells (demonstrated in Fig. 2 B), we were experimentally unable to show the increased activation of ATR after UV-induced DNA damage in vitro. Ectopically expressed FLAG-tagged wt ATR revealed a similar phosphorylation of Brca1 at these sites (B1F6 is shown in Fig. 3 D), whereas kd ATR failed to show any activity against Brca1, thus providing a specific control for ATR kinase activity (Fig. 3 D). The present results demonstrate that there is a qualitative difference in Brca1 phosphorylation between γ radiation and UV radiation. Brca1 is phosphorylated at Ser-1423 and Ser-1524 after both IR and UV. However, Ser-1387 is specifically phosphorylated after IR, and Ser-1457 is predominantly phosphorylated after UV. These different responses in the phosphorylation of Brca1 after UV and IR exposure correspond to the fact that the nature of DNA damage caused by these two treatments is distinct; IR produces single or double strand breaks followed by ligation or recombination repair, whereas UV produces cyclobutane dimers followed by excision repair. The cellular molecules that detect and repair these distinct DNA lesions are different, which could well explain why the Brca1 response is also different. For example, ATM-deficient cells are defective in the cellular responses to double strand break-inducing agents (such as IR and other radiomimetic agents) but have a normal response to UV (22Khanna K.K. Lavin M.F. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3307-3312PubMed Google Scholar). However, there is not an absolute requirement for ATM in the cellular response to double strand breaks because the stabilization and phosphorylation of p53 (19Siliciano J.D. Canman C.E. Taya Y. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3471-3481Crossref PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar, 22Khanna K.K. Lavin M.F. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3307-3312PubMed Google Scholar) is delayed but not abrogated in ATM-deficient cells in response to IR. Recently, the ATM-related kinase ATR was shown to mediate this late phosphorylation of p53 on Ser-15 in response to IR and the early phosphorylation of p53 in response to UV (20Tibbetts R.S. Brumbaugh K.M. Williams J.M. Sarkaria J.N. Cliby W.A. Shieh S.Y. Taya Y. Prives C. Abraham R.T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 152-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (866) Google Scholar). These distinctions in kinetics may be a consequence of dynamic changes in initiating damage during the cellular exposures to IR and may dictate the need for particular components of the damage response pathway at particular times. These experiments reveal that the primary genetic damages induced by IR may initially activate ATM and, subsequently, that ATR is required to recognize the late DNA strand breakage. Moreover, these experiments also suggest that UV radiation may up-regulate the catalytic activity of ATR efficiently rather than regulating ATM activity. Although the mechanism by which ATM and ATR kinases are selectively regulated by distinct DNA damage signals remains unclear at present, it seems reasonable to propose that distinct DNA damage detectors might act to identify different types of DNA damage and that these distinct detectors might signal to Brca1 in a different way. ATR may be used immediately after UV damage, and ATM may be used after IR to detect damage in the DNA and then add phosphate groups to Brca1. We have shown here that ATM is involved in the immediate phosphorylation of Brca1 at multiple sites (Ser-1387, Ser-1423, and Ser-1457) after IR but not after UV, which is consistent with accumulating data that ATM is primarily involved in the signaling of double strand breaks in DNA. The finding that the overexpression of catalytically inactive ATR inhibits the UV-induced phosphorylation of Brca1 at Ser-1423, Ser-1457, and Ser-1524 strongly suggests that the phosphorylation of BRCA1 in response to UV requires the presence of functional ATR. The precise mechanism by which the ATM- and ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Brca1 regulate Brca1 function is unclear at present. It is possible that phosphorylation might lead to a change in Brca1 subnuclear localization, which changes in response to DNA damage. In this regard, we observed that the Brca1 pool in cells is phosphorylated on Ser-1524 in response to IR and UV, and this phosphorylated form localizes to nuclear foci within 2 h after DNA damage, suggesting that phosphorylation might regulate the localization of Brca1. Interestingly, ATR also forms nuclear foci in cells synchronized in S phase, and these foci co-localize with Brca1. This observation is consistent with the essential roles of ATR and BRCA1 during the normal cell cycle, possibly facilitating DNA replication and preventing mitotic entry during S phase. A majority of cells in asynchronous culture show ATR-containing nuclear foci when exposed to DNA damage (IR and UV). Because an increase in ATR kinase activity has not been observed after treatment with various DNA-damaging agents, it is possible that ATR is regulated by its location to its substrate, such as BRCA1, after DNA damage. These results are also consistent with an earlier report that demonstrated the co-localization of Brca1 and ATR onto asynapsed regions of meiosis I chromosomes (23Scully R. Chen J. Plug A. Xiao Y. Weaver D. Feunteun J. Ashley T. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 88: 265-275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1326) Google Scholar) and could represent the primary response to early lesions, which might initiate meiotic recombination and synapsis. It is quite conceivable that the ATR·Brca1 complex might control homologous recombination and homology-directed repair in somatic cells. The fact that ATR and BRCA1 mutant mice share similar phenotypes (5Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 397-402PubMed Google Scholar) and that ATR controls BRCA1 phosphorylation suggests that ATR is a key regulator of BRCA1 function. Uncovering the biochemical details of signaling to Brca1 will be an important step toward understanding why the defects in this gene product predispose people to breast cancer. Special thanks are extended to Dr. S. Handeli for providing cells expressing wild-type and dominant negative ATR."
https://openalex.org/W2066298745,"Cellular interactions of advanced glycation end products (AGE) are mediated by AGE receptors. We demonstrated previously that class A scavenger receptor types I and II (SR-A) and CD36, a member of class B scavenger receptor family, serve as the AGE receptors. In this study, we investigated whether scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), another receptor belonging to class B scavenger receptor family, was also an AGE receptor. We used Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells overexpressed hamster SR-BI (CHO-SR-BI cells). 125I-AGE-bovine serum albumin (AGE-BSA) was endocytosed in a dose-dependent fashion and underwent lysosomal degradation by CHO-SR-BI cells. 125I-AGE-BSA exhibited saturable binding to CHO-SR-BI cells (Kd= 8.3 μg/ml). Endocytic uptake of 125I-AGE-BSA by CHO-SR-BI cells was completely inhibited by oxidized low density lipoprotein (LDL) and acetylated LDL, whereas LDL exerted only a weak inhibitory effect (<20%). Cross-competition experiments showed that AGE-BSA had no effect on HDL binding to these cells and vice versa. Interestingly, however, SR-BI-mediated selective uptake of HDL-CE was completely inhibited by AGE-BSA in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 <10 μg/ml). Furthermore, AGE-BSA partially inhibited (by <30%) the selective uptake of HDL-CE in human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells (IC50 <30 μg/ml). In addition, [3H]cholesterol efflux from CHO-SR-BI cells to HDL was significantly inhibited by AGE-BSA in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 <30 μg/ml). Our results indicate that AGE proteins, as ligands for SR-BI, effectively inhibit both SR-BI-mediated selective uptake of HDL-CE and cholesterol efflux from peripheral cells to HDL, suggesting that AGE proteins might modulate SR-BI-mediated cholesterol metabolism in vivo.

In the Maillard reaction, proteins react with glucose to form Schiff base and Amadori products.

Two AGE-binding proteins of 60- and 90-kDa (called p60 and p90) were also identified from the rat liver (24Vlassara H. Li Y.M. Imani F. Wojciechowicz D. Yang Z. Liu F.T. Cerami A. Mol.

We have recently shown that the macrophage scavenger receptor class AI/AII (SR-A), which is known as a receptor for oxidized low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) (26Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Takeya M.

In contrast, although functionally related to SR-A, the class B receptors differ significantly in structure. CD36, the defining member of this class, binds Ox-LDL, fatty acids, and the proteins collagen and thrombospondin (28Endemann G. Stanton L.W. Madden K.S. Bryant C.M. White R.T. Protter A.A. J. Biol.

CD36 has a broad ligand specificity, and its multiple potential roles have been proposed. We recently discovered that the class B scavenger family member CD36 also serves as a receptor for AGE-BSA (33Ohgami N. Nagai R. Ikemoto M. Arai H. Kuniyasu A. Horiuchi S. Nakayama H. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 3195-3202Google Scholar). Our study provided novel information that in addition to SR-A the class B scavenger receptor family seems to serve as AGE receptors in vivo and therefore might participate in the pathogenesis of diabetic macrovascular complications (33Ohgami N. Nagai R. Ikemoto M. Arai H. Kuniyasu A. Horiuchi S. Nakayama H. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 3195-3202Google Scholar). The scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), a member of the class B scavenger receptor family, was first identified as a high density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor and was shown to mediate selective uptake of cholesteryl esters from HDL (HDL-CE) in vitro (34Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science.. 1996; 271: 518-520Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrated that SR-BI-mediated selective uptake of HDL-CE was much more efficient than CD36-mediated uptake, despite the high similarity in structure of SR-BI and CD36 (35Connelly M.A. Klein S.M. Azhar S. Abumrad N.A. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 41-47Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical analyses in rodents revealed abundant SR-BI expression in the liver and steroidogenic tissues such as the adrenal glands and ovaries (34Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science.. 1996; 271: 518-520Google Scholar), where a selective uptake of HDL-CE is known to predominate (36Glass C. Pittman R.C. Weinstein D.B. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of SR-BI in mouse liver is associated with reduced plasma HDL levels and increased cholesterol secretion into bile (40Kozarsky K.F. Donahee M.H. Rigotti A.

In the present study, we investigated whether AGE-proteins could be recognized as ligands by SR-BI. Our results suggest that AGE proteins generated in vivo could affect SR-BI-mediated cholesterol metabolism. Penicillin G (1,650 IU/mg), streptomycin sulfate (750 IU/mg), G418, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), and Ham's F-12 medium were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Na125I (3.7 GBq/ml), [1,2-3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether (1 mCi/ml), and [1,2-3H]cholesterol (1 mCi/ml) were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse SR-BI antibody was purchased from Novus Biologicals. Other chemicals were of the best grade available from commercial sources. AGE-BSA was prepared as described previously (33Ohgami N. Nagai R. Ikemoto M. Arai H. Kuniyasu A. Horiuchi S. Nakayama H. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 3195-3202Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.0 g of BSA was dissolved in 10 ml of 0.5 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 3.0 g of d-glucose. Each sample was sterilized by ultrafiltration, incubated at 37 °C for 40 weeks, and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) (PBS). The extent of lysine modification was 71% for AGE-BSA. TheN ε-(carboxymethyl) lysine content of AGE-BSA was 7.7 mol/mol of BSA (33Ohgami N. Nagai R. Ikemoto M. Arai H. Kuniyasu A. Horiuchi S. Nakayama H. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 3195-3202Google Scholar). Nonglycated BSA was prepared as described previously (44Nagai R. Ikeda K. Kawasaki Y. Sano H. Yoshida M. Araki T. Ueda S. Horiuchi S. FEBS Lett... 1998; 425: 355-360Google Scholar). Briefly, 1.0 g of BSA was incubated with phenyl boronic acid resin (PBA-60, Amicon, Beverly, MA) in 800 ml of 0.5m glycine/NaOH buffer containing 2% MgCl2 (pH 8.5) for 2 h at room temperature. The filtrate through a glass filter was refiltered with another portion of the same resin. The final solution was dialyzed against PBS and used for the experiments. Human LDL (d = 1.019–1.063 g/ml) (33Ohgami N. Nagai R. Ikemoto M. Arai H. Kuniyasu A. Horiuchi S. Nakayama H. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 3195-3202Google Scholar) and HDL (d = 1.063–1.21 g/ml) (45Sakai M. Miyazaki A. Hakamata H. Sasaki T. Yui S. Yamazaki M. Shichiri M. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 31430-31435Google Scholar) were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation of human plasma from normolipidemic subjects after overnight fasting and dialyzed against 0.15 m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4) (33Ohgami N. Nagai R. Ikemoto M. Arai H. Kuniyasu A. Horiuchi S. Nakayama H. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 3195-3202Google Scholar). Traces of apoB and -E were removed from HDL by a heparin-agarose column. Acetylated LDL (acetyl-LDL) was prepared by chemical modification of LDL with acetic anhydride as described previously (46Ohgami N. Kuniyasu A. Furukawa K. Miyazaki A. Hakamata H. Horiuchi S. Nakayama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 2000; 277: 417-422Google Scholar). To prepare Ox-LDL, LDL was dialyzed against PBS to remove EDTA. LDL (0.1 mg/ml) was then incubated for 16 h at 37 °C with 5 μm CuSO4, followed by addition of 1 mm EDTA and cooling (46Ohgami N. Kuniyasu A. Furukawa K. Miyazaki A. Hakamata H. Horiuchi S. Nakayama H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun... 2000; 277: 417-422Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility of AGE-BSA preparations toward the anode was 1.4 times higher than that of unmodified BSA. Under identical conditions, Ox-LDL showed a similar increase in electrophoretic mobility. Thus, modification of BSA with glucose is associated with a significant increase in net negative charge (33Ohgami N. Nagai R. Ikemoto M. Arai H. Kuniyasu A. Horiuchi S. Nakayama H. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 3195-3202Google Scholar). AGE-BSA was labeled with 125I by IODO-GEN (Pierce), and HDL was labeled as described previously (33Ohgami N. Nagai R. Ikemoto M. Arai H. Kuniyasu A. Horiuchi S. Nakayama H. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 3195-3202Google Scholar) to a specific radioactivity of 850 and 500 cpm/ng, respectively. CHO-K1 cells were maintained at 37 °C in medium A (Ham's F-12 supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 units/ml streptomycin) containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). CHO-SR-BI cells (47Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2000; 97: 6538-6543Google Scholar) stably expressing hamster SR-BI were maintained in medium A supplemented with 50 μg/ml G418 (medium B). CHO-mock cells were prepared by stably transfecting an expression vector pCR3 (Invitrogen) without a cDNA insert (empty control vector) into CHO-K1 cells. HepG2 cells were obtained from RIKEN cell bank (Japan) and maintained in DMEM containing 10% FCS supplemented with 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 units/ml streptomycin (medium C). Rat liver parenchymal cells, as a positive control, were obtained from male Wistar rats. Isolation of liver parenchymal cells from rats was essentially similar to the method devised previously for preparation of rat liver cells (48Matsumoto K. Sano H. Nagai R. Suzuki H. Kodama T. Yoshida M. Ueda S. Smedsrod B. Horiuchi S. Biochem. J... 2000; 352: 233-240Google Scholar). The portal vein was cannulated with a polyethylene catheter, and the liver was perfused with calcium-free Gey's balanced salt solution (GBSS) buffer (pH 7.5) for 10 min at a flow of 8 ml/min and then with GBSS buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.05% collagenase and 4 mmCaCl2 for 3 min at 37 °C. The liver was minced and suspended in ice-cold PBS. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 100 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. The precipitate was suspended in ice-cold PBS, followed by centrifugation. The resulting precipitate was solubilized in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.4) (TBS) containing 2% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin). Samples (30 μg of protein/lane) were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (49Laemmli U.K. Nature.. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and then electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was blocked for 2 h with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS/Tween (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 (pH 7.4)) and washed with TBS/Tween three times. The membrane was then incubated for 1 h with a 1:1,000 dilution of anti-SR-BI antibody in 1.5% skim milk in TBS/Tween and then washed three times with TBS/Tween. Immunoreactive bands were detected by incubation for 30 min with a 1:5,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat secondary anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) in 1.5% skim milk in TBS/Tween and washed three times with TBS/Tween, followed by addition of ECL reagent. All cellular experiments, except for the binding study, were performed at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. CHO-SR-BI cells and CHO-mock cells were cultured in medium B. Cells (8 × 104) were seeded in a 24-well plate and cultured for 2 days in 1.0 ml of medium B, which was then replaced by DMEM containing 3% BSA (medium D). After culture for 1 h, each well received 0.5 ml of medium D containing various concentrations of 125I-HDL or 125I-AGE-BSA in the presence or absence of 20-fold excess amounts of the unlabeled ligand to be tested. After incubation for the indicated times, medium was taken from each well, and soluble radioactivity in trichloroacetic acid was determined as an index of cellular degradation, as described previously (33Ohgami N. Nagai R. Ikemoto M. Arai H. Kuniyasu A. Horiuchi S. Nakayama H. J. Biol. Chem... 2001; 276: 3195-3202Google Scholar). After the cells were washed three times with 1 ml of medium D and then three more times with PBS, they were lysed with 1 ml of 0.1 n NaOH for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation, 125I radioactivity of 0.1 n NaOH-soluble protein was determined (as the cell association of 125I-HDL or 125I-AGE-BSA), and cellular proteins were determined using BCA protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad). For the binding study, cells that had been seeded in each well as described above were incubated for 90 min at 4 °C in 0.5 ml of medium D with various concentrations of 125I-HDL or125I-AGE-BSA in the presence or absence of 20-fold excess amounts of the unlabeled ligands. Each well was washed with ice-cold PBS containing 3% BSA and PBS. The cells were lysed, and the cell-bound radioactivity and cellular proteins were determined as described above. Human HDL (d = 1.063–1.21 g/ml) labeled with [3H]cholesteryl oleoyl ether (CE), a nonhydrolyzable cholesteryl ester analogue, was prepared by a modification of the procedure of Miyazaki et al. (50Miyazaki A. Sakai M. Suginohara Y. Hakamata H. Sakamoto Y. Morikawa W. Horiuchi S. J. Biol. Chem... 1994; 269: 5264-5269Google Scholar). Briefly, 250 μCi of [3H]CE in toluene was evaporated under a gentle stream of N2 at room temperature. Dried [3H]CE was resuspended with 0.4 ml of acetone. [3H]CE in acetone was added to 20 ml of human lipoprotein-deficient serum (20–40 mg/ml) with gentle stirring under a gentle stream of N2 at room temperature for 1 h. Human HDL (15 mg) was then added to the mixture with gentle stirring at room temperature for 30 min. After incubation and adjustment of the mixture density with KBr (d = 1.21 g/ml), the labeled HDL was collected by ultracentrifugation, followed by dialysis against 0.15m NaCl and 1 mm EDTA (pH 7.4). HDL-[3H]CE was then labeled with 125I as described above. The specific activity for125I-HDL-[3H]CE was 158.8 cpm/ng of protein for 125I and 11.8 dpm/ng of protein for 3H. Cells (8 × 104) were seeded in a 24-well plate and cultured for 2 days in 1.0 ml of medium B (for CHO-SR-BI and CHO-mock cells) or medium C (for HepG2 cells), which was then replaced by medium D. After culture for 1 h, each well received 0.5 ml of medium C containing various concentrations of125I-HDL-[3H]CE in the presence (nonspecific uptake) or absence (total uptake) of 10-fold excess amounts of the unlabeled ligand to be tested. After incubation for the indicated times, the cells were washed three times with 1 ml of medium D and then three more times with PBS. The washed cells were lysed with 1 ml of 0.1n NaOH for 30 min at 37 °C. After incubation,125I radioactivity of 0.1 n NaOH-soluble protein (representing the cell association of 125I-HDL) was determined, and cellular proteins were determined as described above. We then determined the 3H radioactivity of 0.1n NaOH-soluble protein (representing [3H]CE uptake). HDL-CE-selective uptake was calculated by subtracting the amount of cell-associated HDL (125I) from the amount of CE uptake (3H) (51Pfeuffer M.A. Richard B.M. Pittman R.C. Arterioscler. Thromb... 1992; 12: 870-878Google Scholar). The [3H]cholesterol efflux assay was performed using a procedure essentially similar to that reported previously by Ji et al. (52Ji Y. Jian B. Wang N. Sun Y. Moya M.L. Phillips M.C. Rothblat G.H. Swaney J.B. Tall A.R. J. Biol. Chem... 1997; 272: 20982-20985Google Scholar). Cells were labeled with [3H]cholesterol by addition of [3H]cholesterol in medium A containing 10% FCS. After 48 h of incubation, cells were incubated for 24 h in DMEM containing 0.5% BSA. Cellular cholesterol efflux was determined by measuring radioactivity released from cells into the medium upon the addition of HDL. All data were expressed as mean ± S.D. Differences between groups were examined for statistical significance using the Student's t test. A pvalue less than 0.05 denoted the presence of a statistically significant difference. CHO-SR-BI cells that stably expressed hamster SR-BI were established. Immunoblotting with a polyclonal anti-SR-BI antibody yielded no bands in CHO-mock cells, whereas CHO-SR-BI cells exhibited a distinctive band. Parallel control experiments demonstrated that rat liver parenchymal cells expressing high levels of SR-BI exhibited a positive band with molecular weight indistinguishable from that obtained from CHO-SR-BI cells as reported previously (47Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2000; 97: 6538-6543Google Scholar) (Fig.1). We further examined whether SR-BI expressed on the cells was functional; CHO-SR-BI cells exhibited cellular binding of 125I-HDL with high affinity (Kd = 6.5 μg/ml, Bmax = 72.3 μg/mg cell protein) but no significant capacity for endocytic uptake of 125I-HDL (data not shown), as reported previously (34Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science.. 1996; 271: 518-520Google Scholar). Selective uptake of HDL-CE by CHO-SR-BI cells was 4-fold higher, at least, than that of CHO-mock cells (data not shown), as reported previously (47Ikemoto M. Arai H. Feng D. Tanaka K. Aoki J. Dohmae N. Takio K. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Inoue K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 2000; 97: 6538-6543Google Scholar). These results indicated that SR-BI expressed on CHO-SR-BI cells functioned as the HDL receptor. We determined the endocytic uptake and degradation of 125I-AGE-BSA by CHO-SR-BI cells at 37 °C. The amount of cell association of 125I-AGE-BSA with CHO-SR-BI cells increased in a dose-dependent manner and was almost competed away by a 20-fold excess of unlabeled AGE-BSA (Fig.2 A). The specific cell association exhibited a dose-dependent saturation pattern with a plateau level of 640 ng/mg cell protein and an apparentKd = 2.3 μg/ml, and a maximal ligand association of 738 ng/mg cell protein (Fig. 2 A). Parallel experiments in CHO-mock cells revealed that the cell association of125I-AGE-BSA occurred at a negligible level (Fig.2 A). In sharp contrast with 125I-HDL (data not shown), endocytic degradation of 125I-AGE-BSA by the transfected cells was significant (Fig. 2 B). Specific degradation increased dose-dependently with a plateau level of 230 ng/mg cell protein; the apparent Kd for degradation was 3.1 μg/ml, and the maximal ligand degradation was 297 ng/mg cell protein, whereas CHO-mock cells did not degrade125I-AGE-BSA under the same conditions (Fig.2 B). This result indicates that SR-BI mediates the cell association of AGE-BSA and its endocytic degradation. We next determined the cellular binding of 125I-AGE-BSA to CHO-SR-BI cells at 4 °C. Total binding of 125I-AGE-BSA was inhibited by 70% by an excess amount of the same ligand. The specific binding, obtained by subtracting nonspecific binding from the total binding, yielded a saturation pattern. Scatchard analysis of the specific binding disclosed a binding site with an apparentKd of 8.3 μg/ml and maximal binding of 85.7 ng/mg cell protein, indicating that CHO-SR-BI cells possess a high affinity binding site for AGE-BSA (Fig. 3). Since the parallel binding experiment of 125I-AGE-BSA to CHO-mock cells failed to yield specific binding (data not shown), it is likely that the specific binding site for AGE-BSA on CHO-SR-BI cells is identical to SR-BI. To examine whether the recognition site for AGE-BSA in CHO-SR-BI cells was identical to that for Ox-LDL, acetyl-LDL, LDL, and HDL, we determined the effect of these lipoproteins on cellular binding of 125I-AGE-BSA to CHO-SR-BI cells. Cellular binding of 125I-AGE-BSA to CHO-SR-BI cells was effectively (>62%) replaced by unlabeled Ox-LDL and acetyl-LDL and by unlabeled AGE-BSA, whereas unlabeled LDL and HDL had a slightly weaker effect (<20%) (Fig.4 A). Non-glycated BSA, a negative control, had no effect on this process (Fig. 4 A). Parallel experiments demonstrated that cellular binding of125I-HDL to CHO-SR-BI cells was effectively (60%) replaced by unlabeled HDL, whereas AGE-BSA had little effect (<15%) (Fig.4 B). These results suggest that the binding site of SR-BI for AGE-BSA might overlap with that for Ox-LDL and acetyl-LDL but not that for LDL and HDL. We determined the effect of Ox-LDL, acetyl-LDL, LDL, and HDL on endocytic uptake of125I-AGE-BSA by CHO-SR-BI cells. The cell association of125I-AGE-BSA was effectively (>85%) replaced by unlabeled Ox-LDL and acetyl-LDL and by unlabeled AGE-BSA, whereas the effect of unlabeled LDL and HDL was almost negligible (<20%), and nonglycated BSA, a negative control, had no effect on this process (Fig.5 A). Similarly, the endocytic degradation of 125I-AGE-BSA was effectively inhibited (>85%) by the presence of unlabeled Ox-LDL, acetyl-LDL, and unlabeled AGE-BSA, whereas unlabeled LDL and HDL also exerted a much weaker effect (<25%) (Fig. 5 B). The results of endocytic experiments are consistent with those of the binding experiments (Fig."
https://openalex.org/W2002735575,"Heparin activates the primary serpin inhibitor of blood clotting proteinases, antithrombin, both by an allosteric conformational change mechanism that specifically enhances factor Xa inactivation and by a ternary complex bridging mechanism that promotes the inactivation of thrombin and other target proteinases. To determine whether the factor Xa specificity of allosterically activated antithrombin is encoded in the reactive center loop sequence, we attempted to switch this specificity by mutating the P6–P3′ proteinase binding sequence excluding P1–P1′ to a more optimal thrombin recognition sequence. Evaluation of 12 such antithrombin variants showed that the thrombin specificity of the serpin allosterically activated by a heparin pentasaccharide could be enhanced as much as 55-fold by changing P3, P2, and P2′ residues to a consensus thrombin recognition sequence. However, at most 9-fold of the enhanced thrombin specificity was due to allosteric activation, the remainder being realized without activation. Moreover, thrombin specificity enhancements were attenuated to at most 5-fold with a bridging heparin activator. Surprisingly, none of the reactive center loop mutations greatly affected the factor Xa specificity of the unactivated serpin or the several hundred-fold enhancement in factor Xa specificity due to activation by pentasaccharide or bridging heparins. Together, these results suggest that the specificity of both native and heparin-activated antithrombin for thrombin and factor Xa is only weakly dependent on the P6–P3′ residues flanking the primary P1–P1′ recognition site in the serpin-reactive center loop and that heparin enhances serpin specificity for both enzymes through secondary interaction sites outside the P6–P3′ region, which involve a bridging site on heparin in the case of thrombin and a previously unrecognized exosite on antithrombin in the case of factor Xa.

Antithrombin is a member of the serpin family of serine proteinase inhibitors whose primary physiologic function is to inhibit and thereby regulate several serine proteinases in the blood coagulation pathway (1Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function, and Biology. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1996Google Scholar, 2Björk I. Olson S.T. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1997; 425: 17-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Inhibition of these proteinases results from the serpin trapping the enzymes as stable acyl-intermediate complexes of a regular substrate reaction through a major conformational change. A unique feature of antithrombin is that it requires activation by the polysaccharide, heparin, to inhibit its main target enzymes, thrombin and factor Xa, at a physiologically significant rate. Heparin activates antithrombin through two distinct mechanisms whose relative contribution depends on the proteinase inhibited (3Danielsson Å. Raub E. Lindahl U. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15467-15473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In both mechanisms, antithrombin binds to a sequence-specific pentasaccharide in heparin (5Choay J. Petitou M. Lormeau J.C. Sinay P. Casu B. Gatti G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 116: 492-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar) which induces an activating conformational change in the reactive center loop of the serpin (6Olson S.T. Shore J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 11065-11072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Gettins P.G.W. Fan B. Crews B.C. Turko I.V. Olson S.T. Streusand V.J.

Such conformational changes are alone sufficient to accelerate antithrombin inactivation of factor Xa through an allosteric mechanism. By contrast, the conformational changes negligibly affect the rate of thrombin inhibition, heparin accelerating antithrombin inhibition of this enzyme instead through a bridging mechanism wherein thrombin binding to a bridging site on heparin next to bound antithrombin enhances thrombin recognition of the serpin (3Danielsson Å. Raub E. Lindahl U. Björk I. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 15467-15473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol.

Although it is well established that conformational activation of antithrombin by the heparin pentasaccharide specifically enhances the reactivity of the serpin with factor Xa, the basis for this enhanced reactivity has not been determined. The x-ray crystal structures of antithrombin (11Schreuder H.A. de Boer B. Dijkema R. Mulders J. Theunissen H.J.M. Grootenhuis P.D.J. Hol W.G.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 48-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 12Carrell R.W. Stein P.E. Fermi G. Wardell M.R. Structure. 1994; 2: 257-270Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) and its complex with the heparin pentasaccharide (9Jin L. Abrahams J.P. Skinner R. Petitou M. Pike R.N. Carrell R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14683-14688Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) have shown that heparin induces an increased exposure of the reactive center loop which may allow unhindered access of the proteinase to the loop and also permit optimal proteinase interaction by increasing loop flexibility. The factor Xa specificity of the conformationally activated serpin suggests that the loop sequence must also be critical for discrimination between factor Xa and thrombin. Supporting this idea, the preferred P4 to P1 substrate sequence for factor Xa recognition in the natural substrate prothrombin, IEGR or IDGR, does resemble the P4–P1 IAGR sequence found in antithrombin, whereas the proposed FPRSFR P3–P3′ optimal thrombin recognition sequence (13Le Bonniec B.F. Myles T. Johnson T. Knight C.G. Tapparelli C. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7114-7122Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) deviates significantly from the AGRSLN sequence in antithrombin. The factor Xa specificity of the antithrombin reactive loop sequence is further supported by our finding that mutation of the factor Xa-preferred P2 Gly of the loop to the thrombin-preferred Pro enhances antithrombin specificity for thrombin at the expense of decreasing specificity for factor Xa in a manner dependent on allosteric activation of the serpin (14Chuang Y.-J. Gettins P.G.W. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28142-28149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Together, these considerations have strongly suggested that the presence of a factor Xa recognition sequence in the reactive center loop and the need for conformational activation of the loop to make this sequence accessible to factor Xa is the basis for allosteric activation of antithrombin by heparin pentasaccharide. To rigorously test this hypothesis, we sought to determine whether changes in the antithrombin reactive center loop sequence to an optimal thrombin recognition sequence would increase the thrombin specificity of the serpin in a manner that was dependent on pentasaccharide activation and comparable to the activation-dependent increase in factor Xa specificity of the wild-type serpin. To accomplish this goal, we evaluated 12 antithrombin variants with single or multiple mutations in the putative P6–P3′ proteinase binding region in the loop other than P1–P1′ to a more favorable thrombin recognition sequence. The results of analyzing the effects of these mutations on antithrombin specificity for thrombin and factor Xa revealed that such reactive center loop changes significantly increased the specificity of antithrombin for thrombin, but the specificity enhancements were only modestly dependent on allosteric activation of the serpin and were greatly attenuated with a bridging heparin activator. Remarkably, the effects of the reactive center loop sequence changes on factor Xa specificity were quite modest, and all variants showed a large inhibition rate enhancement upon allosteric activation comparable to that of the wild-type serpin and independent of the loop sequence. Together, these results strongly argue against our initial hypothesis that exposure of a factor Xa-specific reactive center loop sequence in antithrombin by a pentasaccharide-induced conformational change in the loop is the basis for allosterically activating antithrombin for rapid factor Xa inhibition. Rather, our findings suggest that the specificity of antithrombin for factor Xa arises from the exposure of still unknown recognition determinants outside the P6–P3′ reactive center loop sequence which are only made accessible upon heparin activation. The cDNA for N135Q antithrombin was used as the template for mutating reactive center loop residues to eliminate glycosylation heterogeneity resulting from incomplete glycosylation at Asn-135 and to mimic the high heparin affinity β-form of plasma antithrombin that lacks the Asn-135 carbohydrate chain (15Turko I.V.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6682-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of human antithrombin cDNA was carried out in the single-stranded M13mp19 vector as described (7Gettins P.G.W. Fan B. Crews B.C. Turko I.V. Olson S.T. Streusand V.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8385-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) using an antisense oligonucleotide encoding the desired mutation. This method was used for the construction of the G392P, A391H, and N396H mutations. Other mutants were made by annealing complementary oligonucleotides carrying the desired mutant codons to pAlter (Promega) or pMAStop (7Gettins P.G.W. Fan B. Crews B.C. Turko I.V. Olson S.T.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8385-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) plasmids in which the antithrombin N135Q cDNA was preinserted and generating mutant plasmids by polymerase chain reaction. cDNAs for antithrombin-protease nexin-1 loop chimeras were generated in pAlter plasmids and then excised and ligated into the pMAStop expression plasmid. The chimeras were generated by first mutating the antithrombin P6–P2 sequence and then the P2′–P3′ sequence to that of protease nexin-1. Variants containing G392P, A391F, and L395F mutations in all possible combinations were generated by stepwise mutation. Oligonucleotides used for generating mutations (antisense strand only) were as follows (mutant codons underlined): A391F, 5′-GTT TAG CGA ACG GCC GAA AAT CAC AAC AGC GG-3′; G392P, 5′-GTT TAG CGA ACGGGG AGC AAT CAC AAC-3′; L395F, 5′-CCT GTT GGG GTTAAA CGA ACG GCC AGC-3′; A391F/G392P, 5′-GG GTT TAG CGA ACGGGGGAA AAT CAC AAC AG-3′; A391F/L395F, 5′-GTTAAA CGA ACG GCC AAA AAT CAC AAC AGC-3′; G392P/L395F, 5′-GTT AAA CGA ACG CGG AGC AAT CAC AAC-3′; A391F/G392P/L395F, 5′-C CCT GTT GGG GTT AAA CGA ACGGGGAAA AAT CAC AAC AGC-3′; PN1 P6–P2, 5′-CAC CCT GTT GGG GTT TAG CGA ACG CGCGATGAGGATGGC AGC GGT ACT TGC AGC TGC TTC ACT-3′; PN1 P6–P3′, 5′-GGC CTT GAA AGT CAC CCT GTT GGGCGGCGAGCTTCTGGCGATGAGGATGGC AGC GGT ACT TGC-3′; V388A/V389A/I390A, 5′-G CGA ACG GCC AGC AGCGGCAGC AGC GGT ACT TGC AG-3′; A391H, 5′-TAG CGA ACG GCC ATG AAT CAC AAC AGC-3′; N396H, 5′-CAC CCT GTT GGG ATG TAG CGA ACG GCC-3′. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Baby hamster kidney cells were cotransfected with the expression vector carrying the reference or mutant cDNA together with selection plasmids and stably transfected cell lines obtained as described previously (7Gettins P.G.W.

FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recombinant antithrombins were isolated from serum-free cycles of medium collected from the stably transfected baby hamster kidney cells grown to confluence in roller bottles, with expression levels routinely reaching 15–40 mg/liter (7Gettins P.G.W. Fan B. Crews B.C. Turko I.V. Olson S.T. Streusand V.J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 8385-8389Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 15Turko I.V. Fan B. Gettins P.G.W. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Recombinant antithrombins were purified by heparin-agarose chromatography to resolve the high heparin affinity glycoform corresponding in affinity to plasma β-antithrombin followed by DEAE-Sepharose and Sephacryl S-200 chromatography (15Turko I.V. Fan B. Gettins P.G.W. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 17Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Concentrations of recombinant antithrombins were determined from the absorbance at 280 nm using a molar absorption coefficient of 37,700m−1 cm−1(18Nordenman B. Nyström C. Björk I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 78: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Human α-thrombin was a gift of Dr. John Fenton (New York State Department of Health, Albany, NY). Human factor Xa (predominantly α) was obtained by activation of purified factor X followed by purification on soybean trypsin inhibitor-agarose as described (19Bock P.E. Craig P.A. Olson S.T. Singh P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 273: 375-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) or generously provided by Dr. Paul Bock (Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN). Proteinase concentrations were based on active-site titrations that indicated >90 and >70% active enzyme for thrombin and factor Xa, respectively (20Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A. Peng X. Picard V. Zenderouh P. Turk B. Björk I. Olson S.T. Bock S.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Human neutrophil elastase was purchased from Athens Research and Technology (Athens, GA). Bovine β-trypsin was isolated from commercial enzyme (Sigma) by soybean trypsin inhibitor-agarose chromatography as described (21Yung B.Y. Trowbridge C.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 65: 927-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The α-methyl glycoside of a synthetic heparin pentasaccharide corresponding to the antithrombin-binding sequence in heparin was generously provided by Dr. Maurice Petitou (Sanofi Recherche, Toulouse, France). A full-length heparin containing the pentasaccharide with an average molecular weight of ∼8000 (∼26 saccharides) was isolated from commercial heparin by size and antithrombin affinity fractionation (17Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Concentrations of pentasaccharide and full-length heparins were determined by stoichiometric titrations of antithrombin with the saccharides monitored by changes in protein fluorescence (4Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). All experiments were done at 25 or 37 °C as noted in buffers consisting of 20 mm sodium phosphate, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 8000 containing either 0.1 m NaCl (I 0.15) at pH 7.4, 0.25 m NaCl (I 0.3) at pH 7.4, or 0.125m NaCl (I 0.15) at pH 6.0. An exception was experiments with trypsin that were done in 100 mm Hepes containing 0.1 m NaCl, 0.01 mCaCl2, and 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, pH 7.4. Thrombin (5–100 nm), factor Xa (10–100 nm), or trypsin (100 nm) were incubated with increasing molar ratios of recombinant antithrombin to enzyme in the absence or presence of heparin levels equimolar with the maximum inhibitor concentration (0.1–2 μm) for times sufficient to complete the reaction based on measured second-order rate constants (17Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Residual enzyme activity was then measured by 50–100-fold dilution of an aliquot of the reaction mixtures into 100 μm S2238 (Chromogenix) for thrombin, 200 μm Spectrozyme FXa (American Diagnostica) for factor Xa, or 100 μm S-2222 (Chromogenix) for trypsin, followed by monitoring the initial rate of substrate hydrolysis from the linear absorbance increase at 405 nm. In some cases thrombin or trypsin activity was measured by dilution of reaction mixtures into 50 μmtosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Sigma) and substrate hydrolysis monitored from the linear fluorescence increase at excitation and emission wavelengths of 380 and 440 nm, respectively. All substrates contained 50–100 μg/ml Polybrene (Aldrich) to neutralize any heparin present. The inhibition stoichiometry was obtained by extrapolating linear least squares fits of the decrease in enzyme activity with increasing molar ratio of inhibitor to enzyme to the ratio yielding complete enzyme inhibition. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis was performed using the Laemmli discontinuous buffer system and a 10% polyacrylamide gel under nonreducing conditions (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206631) Google Scholar). The products of antithrombin-proteinase reactions were analyzed after reacting 2–5 μm proteinase with a 1–3-fold molar excess of antithrombin in the absence or presence of full-length heparin equimolar with the inhibitor for 5–30 min in I 0.15 buffer. Reactions were quenched with 250 μmPhe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (Calbiochem) for thrombin or 500 μm Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (Bachem) for factor Xa prior to addition of SDS sample buffer and boiling. Neutrophil elastase cleavage of wild-type and V388A/V389A/I390A variant antithrombins was analyzed by incubating 3 μm serpin with 0.3 nm enzyme and 10 μm unfractionated heparin (Sigma) for varying times up to 60 min in I 0.15 buffer at 37 °C followed by quenching with SDS sample buffer and boiling for 3 min. Protein bands were detected by Coomassie Blue R-250 staining. The KD for heparin binding to recombinant antithrombins was measured by titrating 50 nm antithrombin with at least a 10-fold molar excess of polysaccharide in I 0.3 buffer, and monitoring heparin binding from the intrinsic protein fluorescence enhancement at excitation and emission wavelengths of 280 and 340 nm, respectively (4Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,17Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Stoichiometries of heparin binding were determined by similar titrations in I 0.15 buffer where binding is considerably tighter (4Olson S.T. Björk I. Sheffer R. Craig P.A. Shore J.D. Choay J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12528-12538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Titrations were fit by the quadratic equilibrium binding equation with KD, the stoichiometry and the maximal relative fluorescence change being the fitted parameters (17Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Stoichiometries determined at I 0.15 were assumed in fitting titrations at I 0.3 where KD was best determined. Second-order rate constants for the association of variant antithrombins with proteinases were measured under pseudo first-order conditions by using a molar excess of inhibitor over enzyme of at least 10 times the inhibition stoichiometry (16Turk B. Brieditis I. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. Björk I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6682-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Reactions contained 10–300 nm antithrombin and 0.1–10 nm proteinase with or without catalytic levels of pentasaccharide or full-length heparins ranging from 0.25 to 20 nm. For pentasaccharide-accelerated antithrombin-thrombin reactions or for pentasaccharide or full-length heparin-accelerated antithrombin-trypsin reactions, a 1.5–4-fold molar excess of heparin over antithrombin was used to saturate the inhibitor (≥92%). The time-dependent decrease in enzyme activity was measured by quenching samples at varying times into substrate and determining the initial rate of chromogenic or fluorogenic substrate hydrolysis as in determinations of reaction stoichiometry. Enzyme inhibition progress curves were computer-fitted by a single exponential function with a zero end point to obtain the observed pseudo first-order rate constant,kobs. Apparent second-order association rate constants for uncatalyzed and heparin-catalyzed reactions were determined from the least squares slope of the linear dependence ofkobs on the antithrombin or the heparin concentration, respectively, in accordance with Equation 1 that applies when [AT]o ≫ [H]o, kobs=kuncat×[AT]o+kH×[H]o×([AT]o/(KAT,H+[AT]o))Equation 1 where kuncat and kHare the second-order rate constants for uncatalyzed and heparin-catalyzed reactions, respectively, and [AT]o and [H]o represent the total antithrombin and heparin concentrations, and KAT, H is the dissociation constant for the antithrombin-heparin interaction (16Turk B. Brieditis I. Bock S.C. Olson S.T. Björk I. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6682-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The expression multiplying kH represents the antithrombin-heparin complex concentration which under the conditions of the experiments ([AT]o ≫ KAT,H) was closely approximated by [H]o. Association rate constants for reactions of thrombin with antithrombin-pentasaccharide complex or of trypsin with antithrombin complexes with either pentasaccharide or full-length heparins were obtained by dividing the measured or fittedkobs at saturating heparin by the antithrombin concentration. Apparent second-order rate constants were corrected for the different fractions of wild-type and variant antithrombins reacting through the inhibitory pathway by multiplying by the measured stoichiometry of proteinase inhibition (1Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function, and Biology. R. G. Landes, Austin, TX1996Google Scholar). Resolution of the noncovalent and covalent reaction steps of the reaction of wild-type and variant antithrombin-heparin complexes with thrombin was done by monitoring the reaction kinetics with a reporter fluorogenic substrate in an SX-17MV Applied Photophysics stopped-flow instrument under pseudo first-order conditions in I 0.15 buffer as in previous studies (14Chuang Y.-J. Gettins P.G.W. Olson S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28142-28149Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Reactions contained 0.06–75 nm thrombin and a 40–400-fold molar excess of antithrombin-heparin complex generated by saturating 0.025–2 μm full-length heparin with a 1.1–2-fold molar excess of antithrombin. Reactions were continuously monitored from the exponential decrease in the rate of hydrolysis of the fluorogenic substrate, tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin, present at 5 μm. kobs values were averaged for each inhibitor-heparin complex concentration and corrected for the uncatalyzed reaction due to excess free inhibitor. The dependence ofkobs on the antithrombin-heparin complex concentration ([AT·H]) was fit by the hyperbolic Equation2,kobs=k[AT·H]/(1+[S]o/KM)/(KT,ATH+[AT·H]/(1+[S]o/KM))Equation 2 where k represents the limiting rate constant for conversion of the noncovalent heparin-antithrombin-thrombin ternary complex to a covalent serpin-proteinase complex with release of heparin, KT,ATH is the dissociation constant for formation of the ternary complex, [S]o is the concentration of fluorogenic substrate, and KM is the Michaelis constant for substrate hydrolysis by thrombin. KMwas fixed at the measured value of 4.5 ± 0.4 μm,and KT,ATH and k were the fitted parameters. Rate constants for dissociation of covalent antithrombin-proteinase complexes were measured as in previous studies by continuously monitoring the recovery of proteinase activity in the presence of a reporter chromogenic substrate (14Chuang Y.-J.

Briefly, complexes were formed by reacting 5–10 μm antithrombin with 0.5–1 μm proteinase and 1 μmfull-length heparin for 10 min at 25 °C. In the case of the triple P3/P2/P2′ AGL → FPF variant and protease nexin-1 loop swap variants, heparin was either omitted or the complex formed at higher ionic strength to minimize any substrate reaction (14Chuang Y.-J.

Complexes were diluted to 0.3–6 nm in 400 μm S2238 or 400 μm Spectrozyme FXa in I 0.15 buffer containing 100 μg/ml Polybrene at 37 °C, conditions which effectively block reassociation of residual inhibitor with dissociated enzyme (17Olson S.T. Björk I. Shore J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 525-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar), and the initial rate of complex dissociation was continuously monitored from the parabolic increase in the rate of substrate hydrolysis at 405 nm for ∼80 min (<1% complex dissociation). The time-dependent absorbance changes were fit by a second-order polynomial equation to obtain the initial rate of complex dissociation using the independently measured turnover number for enzyme hydrolysis of the substrate under these conditions to relate absorbance changes to changes in enzyme concentration (14Chuang Y.-J.

Initial rates of complex dissociation were plotted against the concentration of complex and the first-order dissociation rate constant determined from the least squares slope of this linear plot. Table I summarizes the reactive center loop mutations that were made in antithrombin to improve its specificity for thrombin. Such mutations were confined to the P6–P3′ residues since the proteinase recognition sequence is typically contained in this region (25Read R.J. James M.N.G. Barrett A.J. Salvesen G.S. Proteinase Inhibitors. Elsevier Science Publishers, Amsterdam1986: 301-336Google Scholar). P3 and P3′ residues were individually changed to basic His side chains due to the reported thrombin preference for basic residues in these positions (26Le Bonniec B.F. MacGillivray R.T. Esmon C.T. J.

The critical P3, P2, and P2′ specificity-determining residues were substituted with the proposed thrombin consensus residues, Phe, Pro, and Phe, respectively (26Le Bonniec"
https://openalex.org/W2011159612,"A cyclic protein was produced in vivo using the intein from Pyrococcus furiosus PI-PfuI in a novel approach to create a circular permutation of the precursor protein by introducing new termini in the intein domain. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) was cyclized with this method in vivo on milligram scales. There was no by-product of linear or polymerized species isolated, unlike with other in vitro or in vivo cyclization methods utilizing inteins. Cyclized GFP unfolded at half the rate of the linear form upon chemical denaturation and required >2 days in 7 m guanidine hydrochloride until a residual fast folding phase (consistent with a persistent cis-proline) had disappeared. Cyclic GFP might become a novel tool for studying the role of termini and backbone topology in various biological processes such as protein degradation and translocation in vivo as well as in vitro."

We show here that an Arf-nucleotide exchange factor, ARNO (ADP-ribosylation factor nucleotide site opener) as well as Arf6 and Arf1 small GTPases are located in the kidney proximal tubule receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway, and that ARNO and Arf6 recruitment from cytosol to endosomes is pH-dependent. In proximal tubules in situ, ARNO and Arf6 partially co-localized with the V-ATPase in apical endosomes in proximal tubules. Arf1 was localized both at the apical pole of proximal tubule epithelial cells, but also in the Golgi. By Western blot analysis ARNO, Arf6, and Arf1 were detected both in purified endosomes and in proximal tubule cytosol. A translocation assay showed that ATP-driven endosomal acidification triggered the recruitment of ARNO and Arf6 from proximal tubule cytosol to endosomal membranes. The translocation of both ARNO and Arf6 was reversed by V-type ATPase inhibitors and by uncouplers of endosomal intralumenal pH, and was correlated with the magnitude of intra-endosomal acidification.

Receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME)1 is used by eukaryotic cells to internalize and process various macromolecules such as signaling molecules, proteins, nutrients, and toxins. In kidney epithelial cells, vesicular trafficking plays a crucial role in many processes, including fluid, ion, and metabolite homeostasis (1Brown D. Stow J.L. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 245-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). In particular, kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells are highly specialized for protein reabsorption and membrane protein recycling via the RME pathway. Recently, important progress has been made in our understanding of the regulation of exo- and endocytotic pathways. Key roles are played by V-type ATPase (V-ATPase)-dependent intravesicular acidification as well as by the ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) subfamily of small GTPases. Earlier studies on the localization and distribution of overexpressed Arf proteins in cultured cells demonstrated that Arf1 was exclusively associated with the Golgi complex (2Peters P.J. Hsu V.W.

In contrast, Arf6 was localized to the plasma membrane of Chinese hamster ovary cells (2Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D. Teal S.B. Oorschot V. Donaldson J.G. Klausner R.D. J.

It was proposed that Arf6 is an important regulator of the RME trafficking pathway (10D'Souza-Schorey C. Li G. Colombo M.I. Stahl P.D. Science. 1995; 267: 1175-1178Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) and is also implicated in rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton (11D'Souza-Schorey C. Boshans R.L. McDonough M. Stahl P.D. Vanaelst L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5445-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Some of these effects may be mediated via activation of phospholipase D isoforms by Arf proteins (12Brown H.A.

In situ, all six members of the Arf family have been identified in rat and mouse tissues (14Price S.R. Nightingale M.S. Tsuchiya M. Moss J. Vaughan M. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 159: 15-23PubMed Google Scholar). Recently we also identified Arf isoforms in human, dog, and rat kidneys (15Marshansky V. Bourgoin S. Londoño I. Bendayan M. Vinay P.

Arf small GTPases have low intrinsic GTPase activity, yet nucleotide exchange is required for their function as a “molecular switch” during the GTP/GDP cycle and cytosol to target membrane shuttling. Regulatory factors including Arf-specific GTPase-activating proteins (Arf-GAP) and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Arf-GEF) are, therefore, essential for Arf function. ARNO (ADP-ribosylation factor nucleotide site opener) is a member of a family of Arf-GEFs which also includes cytohesin-1 (17Meacci E. Tsai S.C. Adami R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1745-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), GRP1 (18Klarlund J.K. Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. Buxton J.M. Holik J.J. Sakelis C. Patki V. Corvera S. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

ARNO is located at the plasma membrane and in contrast to another Arf-GEF activity located in the Golgi complex, it is not sensitive to brefeldin A (2Peters P.J. Hsu V.W. Ooi C.E. Finazzi D.

Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Recently the insulin receptor-dependent translocation of ARNO from cytosol to plasma membrane of adipocytes in vivowas demonstrated (21Venkateswarlu K. Oatey P.B. Tavare J.M. Cullen P.J. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 463-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) and its coimmunoprecipitation with the insulin receptor has been reported (22Shome K. Vasudevan C. Romero G. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). ARNO is 4 times more efficient in activating Arf6 than Arf1 during exchange of GDP by GTP in vitro (23Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (207) Google Scholar), indicating that its physiological function may be to regulate Arf6 activity. Numerous mammalian intracellular organelles and carrier vesicles including clathrin-coated vesicles, endosomes, lysosomes, and the Golgi/TGN complex have an acidic lumen generated by a V-ATPase in conjunction with a parallel chloride conductance (24Mellman I. Fuchs R. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 663-700Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Mellman I. J. Exp. Biol. 1992; 172: 39-45Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Seksek O. Biwersi J. Verkman A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4967-4970Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Individual endocytotic vesicles from kidney proximal tubules showed considerable pH heterogeneity (27Shi L.B. Fushimi K. Bae H.R. Verkman A.S. Biophys. J. 1991; 59: 1208-1217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), suggesting that endocytotic trafficking is associated with a progressive acidification as internalized content passes from early endosomes to late endosomes and finally to lysosomes. Two central questions need to be answered. 1) What are the molecular mechanisms by which this differential acidification in the RME pathway is achieved? 2) What is the functional role of the intra-endosomal acidification process in regulation of the RME pathway? One potential regulatory mechanism involves a pH-dependent interaction of transport vesicles with Arf small GTPases and other cytosolic coat proteins. Previously, a pH-dependent interaction of Arf protein(s) with pancreatic microsomal vesicles (28Zeuzem S. Feick P. Zimmermann P. Haase W. Kahn R.A. Schulz I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, the specific members of the Arf subfamily involved, as well as the molecular mechanism of pH-dependent recruitment were not established (33Marshansky V. Bourgoin S. Londoño I. Bendayan M. Maranda B. Vinay P. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 2661-2676Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We now report the expression and distribution of ARNO, Arf6, and Arf1 in kidney proximal tubule epithelial cells and describe their co-localization with apical acidifiable endosomal vesicles in situ. We show that V-ATPase-dependent intra-endosomal acidification stimulates the recruitment of ARNO and Arf6 from proximal tubule cytosol to endosomal membranes, implicating this process in endosomal function in situ.

The polyclonal anti-ARNO antibodies (Lap18) were raised against recombinant ARNO. The chicken polyclonal anti-V-ATPase (subunit E, 31 kDa) antibodies were generated against a KLH-coupled C terminus peptide (C-GANANRKFLD) and affinity purified using Pierce “Sulfolink” column (Rockford, IL). They were generously provided by Dr. Sylvie Breton, MGH Program in Membrane Biology, and have been characterized previously (34Breton S. Nsumu N.N. Gali T. Sabolic I. Smith P.J. Brown D. Am. J.

Rabbit polyclonal anti-Rab5 antibodies (early endosome marker) were obtained from StressGen Corp. (Victoria, BC, Canada). Immunofluorescence experiments were performed on cryostat sections of rat kidney using an antigen retrieval technique (36Brown D. Lydon J. McLaughlin M. Stuart-Tilley A. Tyszkowski R. Alper S. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 105: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Kidneys from Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were fixed in paraformaldehyde-lysine periodate by intravascular perfusion. Kidney slices were further fixed overnight at 4 °C, before being stored in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Kidney slices were cryo-protected in 30% sucrose/PBS, mounted for cryosectioning in Tissue-Tek embedding medium and quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sections were cut at a thickness of 5 μm on a Reichert-Frigocut cryostat and collected on Fisher Superfrost Plus microscope slides. Antigen retrieval was performed by treatment of cryostat sections with 1% SDS for 4 min as previously described (36Brown D. Lydon J. McLaughlin M. Stuart-Tilley A. Tyszkowski R. Alper S. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 105: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). After washing in PBS buffer (2 times, 5 min) sections were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 10 min. Primary polyclonal anti-ARNO (1:20 dilution), anti-V-ATPase (1:200 dilution), anti-megalin (1:1,000 dilution), anti-Arf1 (1:20 dilution), anti-Rab11 (1:10 dilution), anti-Rab5 (1:100 dilution), and monoclonal anti-Arf6 (1:10 dilution) were then applied and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Secondary GAR-Alexa 488 or GAM-Alexa 488 were diluted in DAKO medium (1:100) and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. After washing in PBS, slides were counterstained with Evans Blue. In co-localization experiments, primary mouse monoclonal anti-Arf6, rabbit polyclonal anti-ARNO, and chicken polyclonal anti-V-ATPase antibodies were used as above. Primary antibodies were then detected using goat anti-mouse, goat anti-rabbit, or donkey anti-chicken IgG conjugated to Alexa 488 or Cy5 as appropriate. FITC-dextran (25 mg in 1 ml of 0.9% NaCl) was injected into the jugular vein of an anesthetized adult rat. After 10 min kidneys were perfused with PBS followed by paraformaldehyde-lysine periodate and sucrose solution. After removing the kidneys, they were immersed in paraformaldehyde-lysine periodate for 2 h for additional fixation, and FITC-dextran was visualized in 5-μm cryostat sections as previously described (37Lencer W.I. Weyer P. Verkman A.S. Ausiello D.A. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: C309-C317Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Incubated sections were mounted in a 2:1 mixture of Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Labs, Burlingham, CA) in 1.5m Tris solution (pH 8.9). Epifluorescence analysis was performed on a Nikon Eclipse E800 epifluorescence microscope connected to a Macintosh G4 computer. Images were captured using a Hamamatsu Orca CCD camera and IPLab Spectrum (Version 3.1a) image processing software (Scanalytics Inc., Fairfax, VA). Confocal analysis was performed on a Bio-Rad Radiance 2000 confocal microscope using LaserSharp 2000 software. All images were transferred into Adobe Photoshop 5.0, paginated using Adobe Illustrator 9.0, and printed on a Epson Stylus Photo750 color printer. Cortical tubules (>85% proximal) were prepared from slices of dog renal cortical tissue. Briefly, both kidneys were removed from anesthetized animals and immediately immersed in ice-cold modified Krebs-Henseleit saline containing: 120 mm NaCl, 3.2 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 0.5 mmCaCl2, 25 mm NaHCO3, 50 mm mannitol. The renal cortex was sliced with a Stadie Riggs microtome and tubules were separated and isolated by collagenase digestion as previously described (38Vinay P. Gougoux A. Lemieux G. Am. J. Physiol. 1981; 241: F403-F411PubMed Google Scholar, 39Marshansky V. Fleser A. Noel J. Bourgoin S. Vinay P. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 153: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The final suspension of cortical tubules containing around 60 mg wet weight per ml was kept at 4 °C in Krebs-Henseleit saline fully gassed with 5% CO2, 95% O2 until use. Endosomes and cytosol from dog kidney proximal tubules in suspension were also prepared as previously described (39Marshansky V. Fleser A. Noel J. Bourgoin S. Vinay P. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 153: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, the suspension of cortical tubules was homogenized in the presence of protease inhibitors: 0.1 μm aprotinin, 1 μmpepstatin A, 10 μm chymostatin, and 100 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The suspension was then centrifuged at 7,700 × g for 15 min and the supernatant was recentrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant from the second centrifugation was recentrifuged at 150,000 × g for 1 h and was kept on ice until use. The pellet containing a mixture of brush-border membrane (BBM) vesicles and early endosomes was collected and homogenized by aspiration through a 25 5/8-gauge steel needle and recentrifuged at 1,900 × g for 15 min. Endosome-enriched BBM vesicles were pelleted by centrifugation at 31,000 × g for 30 min, resuspended in 150 mm KCl, 5 mm Tris-Hepes (pH 7.4) (1 mg of protein/ml), and used to purify the early endosomal fraction. To separate early endosomes (E) from BBM vesicles (BBMV) a wheat germ agglutinin negative selection technique was employed as previously described (39Marshansky V. Fleser A. Noel J. Bourgoin S. Vinay P. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 153: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Protein concentration of proximal tubules, early endosomal, and 150,000 × g cytosol fractions was measured after solubilization of membranes in 0.1% SDS with Pierce bicinchroninic acid protein assay kit (Rockford, IL) using albumin as standard (40Hill H.D. Straka J.G. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Freshly prepared endosomes were resuspended to yield 5–10 mg of protein/ml and stored on ice until use. Estimation of the purity of the endosomal preparation (39Marshansky V. Fleser A. Noel J. Bourgoin S. Vinay P. J. Membr. Biol. 1996; 153: 59-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) as well as characterization of their acidification machinery (41Marshansky V. Vinay P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1284: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was also previously described in detail. In our experiments, we used only freshly prepared early endosomal and cytosolic fractions to measure endosomal acidification and ARNO/Arf translocation. Freezing in liquid nitrogen with consequent thawing drastically diminished the acidification capacity of endosomes and interfered with the translocation assay (data not shown). Isolation of Golgi stacks from kidney cortex was performed using a discontinuous sucrose gradient as previously described (42Slusarewicz P. Hui N. Warren G. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. Academic Press, New York1994: 509-516Google Scholar). Acidification of endosomes was measured simultaneously with translocation of ARNO/Arf under the same conditions, and using freshly prepared endosomal and cytosolic fractions. Endosomal acidification was measured at 37 °C by acridine orange fluorescence quenching as previously described (41Marshansky V. Vinay P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1284: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 μg of endosomal protein was added to 2 ml of acidification/translocation buffer (1.5 mg/ml cytosol supplemented with 150 mm KCl, 50 mm Tris-Hepes (pH 7.4), 5 mm MgSO4, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 10 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 5 μm acridine orange) to initiate proton transport. Fluorescence measurements were performed using a Deltascan Model RFM-2001 spectrofluorimeter (Photon Technology International, South Brunswick, NJ) with excitation at 450 nm (slit width 1 nm) and emission at 525 nm (slit width 2 nm). Fluorescence was recorded using the FelixTM software. Folimycin (0.1 μm) or DCCD (100 μm) were used to inhibit the V-ATPase while FCCP (1 μm), nigericin (1 μm), or NH4Cl (10 mm) were used to dissipate intra-endosomal proton gradients. The ARNO and Arf translocation assays were performed in the same buffer used for the acidification measurements (see above), except that 5 μm acridine orange was replaced with 100 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Also, for the study of GTP/GDP cycle-dependent Arf translocation, the ATP-regenerating system (1 mm ATP, 5 mmcreatine phosphate, 10 units/ml creatine phosphokinase) was replaced by GTPγS (200 μm) and/or GDPβS (200 μm) as indicated in the figure legends. Freshly prepared endosomes (100 μg) were mixed with 500 μl of freshly prepared cytosol (1 mg/ml protein) and incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Translocation was stopped by putting the tubes on ice for 2 min, and endosomes were recovered by centrifugation at 16,000 × g, 4 °C for 60 min. The endosomal pellet was rinsed with 200 μl of rinsing buffer (200 mm sucrose, 25 mm Hepes-KOH, 50 mmKCl, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7, 4). After determination of protein concentration, endosomes were resuspended in 150 mm KCl, 5 mm Tris-Hepes (pH 7.4), and in SDS-PAGE sample buffer to give 1 mg/ml protein. Electrophoresis was performed using 12% SDS-Tris glycine-polyacrylamide gels (SDS-PAGE) according to Laemmli (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar). Endosomal membranes collected after thein vitro translocation assay were applied to the gel (20 μg of protein per lane) and submitted to electrophoresis using a conventional Mini-Protean II electrophoresis cell (Bio-Rad). A graphite electroblotter system MilliBlotTM (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) was used to transfer proteins from the gels to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by exposing the membrane to 5% nonfat dry milk for 1 h. Membranes were incubated for 1 h with an antibody against Arf6 (1:1,000 dilution) or Arf1 (1:1,000 dilution) diluted in TBS/Tween/albumin buffer (15 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 5 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.0). After washing four times in TBS/Tween buffer, the membranes were exposed to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit or sheep anti-mouse antibodies (dilution 1:3,000) in TBS/Tween/milk buffer for 1 h. Membranes were then washed four times in TBS/Tween buffer and proteins revealed using the ECL technique. Quantification of Arf6 and/or Arf1 was made using highly purified rec-Arf1 and rec-Arf6 calibration curves running simultaneously. Quantitative densitometric analysis was performed using NIH Image 1.62 software. Mapping of Arf proteins in the cytoplasm from dog kidney proximal tubules was performed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (two-dimensional PAGE) and Western blot analysis. A combination of isoelectric focusing (IEF) (3/10 ampholyte, Bio-Rad) and 12% SDS-PAGE was used to resolve 25 μg of protein from the 150,000 × g cytosolic fraction of dog kidney proximal tubules. Electrophoresis was carried out using a Mini-Protean II 2D (Bio-Rad) electrophoresis system. Electrotransfer of proteins from the two-dimensional gels to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and immunoblotting with anti-Arf1 (polyclonal SYL1, 1:1,000 dilution) and anti-Arf6 (monoclonal SYL6, 1:1,000 dilution) antibodies were performed as described above. All experiments were performed at least three times and data were analyzed using appropriate ANOVA analyses (SuperANOVA software, Abacus). By confocal immunofluorescence, endogenous ARNO, an Arf-GEF, was detected in the apical pole of proximal tubules in association with numerous vesicles immediately below the apical brush-border membrane and co-localized with V-ATPase in acidifiable endosomes (Fig.1 A). Small GTPase Arf6 was also detected in the apical pole of proximal tubules in association with numerous vesicles and co-localized with V-ATPase in acidifiable endosomes (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, confocal immunofluorescence analysis revealed that Arf6 co-localized with its exchange factor ARNO in apical proximal tubule endosomes in situ (Fig.1 C). As shown in Fig. 2(panels A-C), internalized FITC-dextran was concentrated in endosomal vesicles immediately below the apical brush-border membrane of kidney proximal tubules 10 min after FITC-dextran injection into the jugular vein of rats in vivo. The apical receptor protein megalin (Fig. 2 D) showed a similar pattern of apical localization, immediately below the apical brush-border membrane. Antibodies against Rab5 (an early endosome marker) and Rab11 (a recycling endosome marker), also label subapical compartments in proximal tubule epithelial cells (Fig. 2, E andF). In contrast, endogenous Arf1 was detected in the perinuclear region, probably corresponding to the Golgi complex, similar to previous findings in cultured LLC-PK1 cells (44Sullivan B.M. Harrison-Lavoie K.J. Marshansky V. Lin H.Y. Kehrl J.H. Ausiello D.A. Brown D. Druey K.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3155-3168Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, Arf1 was also found associated with apical microvilli and with vesicles at the base of brush-border membrane (not shown). These results are in agreement with our previous electron microscopic data (16Londoño I. Marshansky V. Bourgoin S. Vinay P. Bendayan M. Kidney. Int. 1999; 55: 1407-1416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) showing that both Arf6 and Arf1 are detectable in the endocytotic pathway of proximal tubule epithelial cells in situ. Thus, ARNO, Arf6, and V-ATPase (Fig. 1) in situare co-localized in apical acidifiable endosomes corresponding to the active RME pathway of these cells i"

Cell number counting and fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis indicated that a significant fraction of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes differentiated into adipocytes without mitotic clonal expansion when induced with the combination of 1-isobutyl-3-methylxanthine and dexamethasone. Furthermore, when normally induced 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were treated with PD98059 (an inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase 1) to block the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) 1 and Erk2, the mitotic clonal expansion was blocked, but adipocyte differentiation was not affected. These observations were confirmed by bromodeoxyuridine labeling. The differentiated adipocytes induced with 1-isobutyl-3-methylxanthine and dexamethasone or standard hormone mixture plus PD98059 were not labeled by bromodeoxyuridine.

Obesity has become a major health hazard in many countries and has been indicated as a risk factor for many physiological disorders, such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart problems. As the major cellular component in adipose tissue, adipocytes play a key role in obesity. The excessive growth of adipose tissue in obesity has been suggested as expansion of adipocytes both in cell size and in cell number (1Gregoire F.M. Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 783-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar, 2Spiegelman B.M. Flier J.S. Cell. 1996; 87: 377-389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1150) Google Scholar). To better understand adipocyte physiology, in vitro cell models, such as 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A, have been used. These model cell lines provide a useful tool to study the adipocyte differentiation process (1Gregoire F.M. Smas C.M. Sul H.S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 783-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1808) Google Scholar, 3MacDougald O.M. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev.

It is one of the most used preadipocyte models to study the adipogenesis process. The preadipocyte differentiation program involves several stages. Immediately after hormonal stimulation (IGF-I 1The abbreviations used are:IGF-Iinsulin-like growth factor IMIX3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthineDEXdexamethasoneMDI3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulinFBSfetal bovine serumDMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumPBSphosphate-buffered salineBrdUrdbromodeoxyuridineDAPI4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindoleFACSfluorescence-activated cell sortingMEKmitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinaseErkextracellular signal-regulated kinaseMAPmitogen-activated proteinMD3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and dexamethasone or insulin at a nonphysiologically high concentration, a glucocorticoid, dexamethasone (DEX), and a cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor that increases intracellular cAMP, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (MIX)), postconfluent G0 3T3-L1 preadipocytes reenter a period of the cell cycle called mitotic clonal expansion. The gene expression program leading to terminal adipocyte differentiation is initiated during and after this mitotic clonal expansion period. It has been proposed that this mitotic clonal expansion might facilitate the DNA remodeling for the adipogenesis gene expression program (3MacDougald O.M. Lane M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 345-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). insulin-like growth factor I 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine dexamethasone 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin fetal bovine serum Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phosphate-buffered saline bromodeoxyuridine 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole fluorescence-activated cell sorting mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase mitogen-activated protein 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine and dexamethasone Whereas it is clear that the mitotic clonal expansion phase precedes the adipogenic gene expression program, whether this cell proliferation process is an obligatory step along the 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation process is still not clear. Several studies have indicated that mitotic clonal expansion and 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation are both blocked by the DNA synthesis inhibitor aphidicolin (7Reichert M. Eick D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), the antiproliferation reagent rapamycin (8Yeh W. Bierer B.E. McKnight S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 1998; 247: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These results supported the view that mitotic growth is a necessary step in the adipocyte differentiation process. However, in our previous studies, we have found that 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation can be blocked with the protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate, whereas mitotic clonal expansion is not affected (11Liao K. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12123-12132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 12Jin S. Zhai B. Qiu Z. Wu J. Lane M.D. Liao K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34344-34352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Vanadate inhibits the differentiation induction signal from IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinase by blocking the turnover of tyrosine-phosphorylated c-Crk (12Jin S. Zhai B. Qiu Z. Wu J. Lane M.D. Liao K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34344-34352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Further investigation indicates that the effect of vanadate on blocking 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation occurs at a very early stage of differentiation induction, before the initiation of mitotic clonal expansion (12Jin S. Zhai B. Qiu Z. Wu J. Lane M.D. Liao K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34344-34352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the activated IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinase induces 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation and mitotic clonal expansion by two separate signal transduction pathways. In addition, primary preadipocytes from human adipose tissue enter the differentiation process without mitotic clonal expansion (13Entenmann G. Hauner H. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1011-C1016Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These observations provide an impetus for us to investigate whether mitotic clonal expansion is an essential step during 3T3-L1 the preadipocyte differentiation induction process or a parallel event induced by the differentiation induction hormones. In the present study, we reported that two rounds of the mitotic clonal expansion cell cycle occurred during 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation induction and that the initiation of clonal expansion required activation of the Erk1 and Erk2 MAP kinases. Of three differentiation induction reagents (MIX, DEX, and a high concentration of insulin in place of IGF-I), only insulin was capable of inducing mitotic clonal expansion. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes induced with MIX and DEX (omitting insulin) or induced with the standard hormone mixture plus MEK inhibitor PD98059 were still able to differentiate into adipocytes, but without DNA synthesis and mitotic clonal expansion. Thus, our results suggest that DNA synthesis and mitotic clonal expansion is not an essential step required for the 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation process; rather, it is a separable event induced by the activated IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinase through a signal pathway of MAP kinases Erk1 and Erk2. Anti-Erk and anti-p-Erk (against the critical Tyr residue phosphorylated peptide) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, BrdUrd, DAPI, sodium orthovanadate, dexamethasone, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, and insulin were purchased from Sigma. PD98059 was purchased from New England Biolab. Mouse monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody was purchased from Becton Dickinson. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody was purchased from Jackson Laboratories, and DMEM was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum and allowed to reach confluence. Differentiation of 2-day postconfluent preadipocytes (designated as day 0) was initiated with 1 μg/ml insulin, 1 μm DEX, and 0.5 mm MIX in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (6Student A.K. Hsu R.Y. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4745-4750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Reed B.C. Lane M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). After 48 h (day 2), the culture medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 μg/ml insulin, and the cells were then fed every other day with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cytoplasmic triglyceride droplets were visible by day 4, and cells were fully differentiated by day 8. For stimulation with individual hormone (MIX, DEX, or insulin alone) or a two-hormone combination (MIX plus DEX, MIX plus insulin, or DEX plus insulin), 2-day postconfluent preadipocytes were induced by hormone(s) at the above-mentioned concentration for 48 h. Cells were trypsinized from culture dishes, and the cell numbers were counted using a hemocytometer plate. For cells carried to final differentiation, the induction culture medium was replaced after 48 h with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum supplemented with or without 1 μg/ml insulin as described in the figure legends, and then the normal cell feeding protocol was followed until day 8. For PD98059 treatment, 20 μm PD98059 was added to the cells with the differentiation induction hormone mixture on day 0. The cells were then cultured following the standard differentiation induction protocol with a supplement of 20 μm PD98059 until day 4. 3T3-L1 cells (6-cm plate) were trypsinized from the culture dishes and collected by centrifugation. An aliquot was subjected to cell counting using a hemocytometer plate. The cells were then fixed in 70% ethanol, pelleted, and treated with 1 mg/ml RNase A for 30 min at 37 °C. After staining with 20 μg/ml propidium iodide, the DNA content in cells was determined by FACS analysis. For Oil-Red-O staining, 3T3-L1 adipocyte monolayers (usually on day 8) were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then fixed for 2 min with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS. Oil-Red-O (0.5%) in isopropanol was diluted with 1.5 volumes of water, filtered, and added to the fixed cell monolayers for 1 h at room temperature. Cell monolayers were then washed with water, and the stained triglyceride droplets in the cells were visualized and photographed. For protein analysis, cell monolayers from cells treated as described in the figure legends were washed three times with cold PBS. Cells were then lysed directly in boiling 1× Laemmli SDS sample buffer (15Laemmli V.D. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) containing 20 mmdithiothreitol. The cell lysate was then heated at 100 °C for 5 min. For Western blotting, cell extracts (usually containing ∼15 μg of protein) were subjected to 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). After blocking with 2% nonfat dried milk in 1× TTBS (Tween/Tris-buffered saline) containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween, and 0.001% thimerosal for 2 h at room temperature, membranes were incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 45 min. Target proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. Cells were cultured on coverslips until 2-day postconfluence and induced to differentiate with different induction conditions as described in the figure legends. During the S phase of the cell cycle, 30 μg/ml BrdUrd was pulsed for 2 h (from the 16th to the 18th h after the induction) to label DNA synthesis. The coverslips were fixed in 70% ethanol for 30 min and then stored in 70% ethanol at 4 °C for immunofluorescence analysis. For cells carried to final differentiation, the BrdUrd labeling medium was replaced with preconditioned medium, which was obtained from a parallel cell culture dish treated with the same induction condition. After 48 h, the medium was replaced with DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum with or without a supplement of 1 μg/ml insulin as described in the figure legends. By day 8, cells were fixed with 70% ethanol and stored in the same ethanol solution at 4 °C for immunofluorescence analysis. BrdUrd labeling was also conducted on day 3 3T3-L1 cells to reveal the effect of the insulin supplementation in the medium. At the 16th h after the medium change, 30 μg/ml BrdUrd was pulsed for 2 h, and the labeling medium was replaced with preconditioned medium obtained from a cell culture dish fed in parallel. On day 4, the cells were fed with normal medium every other day until day 8. Ethanol-fixed coverslips were incubated in 100% methanol for 10 min at room temperature. The coverslips were then treated with 1.5 m HCl for 30 min, blocked with 0.5% Tween 20 in PBS solution for 5 min, and incubated with anti-BrdUrd primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody in a Tween-PBS solution containing 0.1 μg/ml DAPI was added to the coverslips for 1 h at room temperature. After washing coverslips with Tween-PBS twice for 5 min to remove the secondary antibody, the coverslips were mounted for immunofluorescence microscope analysis (AXIOSKOP 20; Zeiss). To minimize the effect of medium change on the activation of Erk1 and Erk2, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were fed with DMEM plus 10% FBS 1 day before the differentiation induction. On day 0, the differentiation inducers were added directly to the culture medium without changing the medium. The remaining steps followed the standard differentiation protocol. In this modified protocol, adipocyte differentiation and mitotic clonal expansion progressed normally, without any detectable changes. For analysis of Erk activation, postconfluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were fed with DMEM containing 10% FBS. The next day, 20 μm PD98059 or 25 μm sodium orthovanadate was added to the culture medium for 1 h, and then a mixture of MIX, DEX, and insulin was added to the medium to initiate the differentiation process. At the indicated time point (time of the addition of MDI is designated as 0 min), cells were harvested by lysing the cells directly in 1× boiling Laemmli SDS sample buffer with 20 mm dithiothreitol. Total Erk protein and the activated tyrosine-phosphorylated Erk were detected with antibodies against Erk or tyrosine-phosphorylated Erk, respectively, on Western blot. For insulin-induced Erk activation, after the medium change (24 h) and pretreatment with PD98059 or vanadate (1 h pretreatment), insulin was added to the cells to initiate the mitotic clonal expansion process. At each time point, the cells were harvested as described above. Two rounds of mitotic clonal expansion were observed during 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation induction and induced only by insulin. It was observed that after 3T3-L1 preadipocytes differentiated into adipocytes, the cell numbers were usually increased by 3–4-fold (Fig.1A). This is consistent with our previous results and results reported by other researchers (9Patel Y.M. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17653-17660Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 10Lyle R.E. Richon V.M. McGehee Jr., R.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 247: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 11Liao K. Lane M.D. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 34344-34352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To ascertain how many cell cycles occurred during the clonal expansion period, we took advantage of the fact that postconfluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes enter mitotic clonal expansion synchronously after the differentiation induction. By cell number counting and FACS analysis of the cellular DNA content, two rounds of cell cycle were observed, and the cell number increase was matched by the DNA content analysis, especially for the first cell cycle, which is well synchronized (Fig. 1, B and C). Complete DNA synthesis and transition from diploid to tetraploid were observed (Fig.1C). Thus, the clonal expansion was full cell cycle mitosis. Because differentiation induction is initiated with three hormones working through three signal pathways (MIX on cAMP, DEX on glucocorticoid receptor, and insulin on IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinase), it is important to know whether the mitotic clonal expansion is the result of the combined effects of three hormones or the result of one of the hormones. By inducing 3T3-L1 cells with individual hormone or a different combination of two hormones on day 0 and counting the cell number after the completion of the first cell cycle, it was clear that once insulin was present, the cell number was increased. Even with insulin alone, mitosis still occurred (Fig.1D). This insulin-activated mitosis was confirmed by analysis of DNA synthesis with BrdUrd labeling. The incorporation of BrdUrd in cells exposed to insulin or to a hormone mixture containing insulin was significantly higher than that in cells exposed to other hormones (Fig. 1E). Because insulin is working through the IGF-I receptor in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (16Smith P.J. Wise L.S. Berkowitz R. Wan C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9402-9408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Schmidt W. Poll-Jordan G. Loffler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15489-15495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mitotic clonal expansion is induced by the activation of IGF-I receptor. Because insulin is the sole factor to induce mitotic clonal expansion, we attempted to induce 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation with MIX and DEX. As shown in Fig.2A, induction of preadipocytes with MIX, DEX, and insulin led to an almost doubled cell number by day 2, whereas induction with MIX and DEX caused no cell number increase. After the change of medium on day 2, MIX and DEX-induced cells fed with insulin-supplemented medium started mitosis. By day 4, the cell number increased and was close to that induced with the standard differentiation protocol (MDI for 48 h plus insulin for an additional 48 h). In contrast, MIX and DEX-induced cells fed with plain medium remained in the quiescent state, and no cell number increase was detected. FACS analysis confirmed the results of cell number counting (Fig. 2B). Only in MIX and DEX-induced cells fed with insulin-supplemented medium was DNA synthesis observed. Thus, induction with MIX and DEX (without insulin) in the first 2 days followed by normal insulin-supplemented medium for an additional 2 days delayed the cells entrance into mitotic clonal expansion, whereas induction only with MIX and DEX for 2 days resulted in the cells staying in the quiescent state without entering into clonal expansion. Adipocyte differentiation under these induction conditions was analyzed by the accumulation of cytoplasmic triglyceride and the expression of adipocyte marker protein aP2 (Fig. 2, C and D). As shown by Oil-Red-O staining (Fig. 2C), 3T3-L1 preadipocytes induced with MIX and DEX for 2 days and then with insulin for an additional 2 days differentiated into adipocytes normally, although the clonal expansion was delayed by 2 days compared with standard condition-induced 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Thus, delaying the mitotic clonal expansion did not have a detectable effect on the 3T3-L1 cell differentiation. Furthermore, when 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were induced without insulin for the entire differentiation process (MIX and DEX for the first 2 days and then medium without an insulin supplement), a significant fraction of the preadipocytes differentiated into adipocytes, even though no mitotic clonal expansion occurred; and the differentiated adipocytes were evenly distributed in the entire cell monolayer. The expression of adipocyte marker protein aP2 confirmed the results of Oil-Red-O staining. In all three cases (standard induction condition: MDI for 2 days and insulin for 2 days; clonal expansion delayed condition: MD for 2 days and insulin for 2 days; no clonal expansion: MD for 2 days), expression of aP2 protein started on day 3, and its expression was further increased in fully differentiated adipocytes (Fig. 2D). These results indicated that the differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes into adipocytes was not related to their mitotic clonal expansion. The results of FACS analysis and cell number counting indicated that a significant fraction of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes differentiated into adipocytes without undergoing mitotic clonal expansion when induced with MIX and DEX. To confirm these results, BrdUrd was used to label DNA synthesis. Therefore, if adipocyte differentiation requires mitotic clonal expansion, then most of the differentiated adipocytes will be labeled with BrdUrd. When BrdUrd was added to the cells during the S phase (from the 16th to 18th h after the hormonal stimulation), most MDI-induced cells were labeled by BrdUrd as shown in Fig. 3, Aand B. In contrast, only a small percentage of cells induced with MIX and DEX were labeled with BrdUrd, and it was the same as the percentage of BrdUrd-labeled control cells fed with DMEM and 10% FBS. Although the adipocyte differentiation in MIX and DEX-induced cells was not as complete as that in MDI-induced cells (37%versus 70% of the cells containing visible triglyceride droplets), only around 15% of differentiated adipocytes with MIX and DEX induction were labeled by BrdUrd. This ratio of BrdUrd incorporation in differentiated adipocytes was in the same range of BrdUrd incorporation in the total cell population. If mitotic clonal expansion were a required step for adipocyte differentiation, we would expect a much higher BrdUrd incorporation ratio in adipocytes than in total cells. Thus, the MIX and DEX-induced adipocytes did not undergo DNA synthesis and hence mitosis. In the standard differentiation induction protocol, after the initial hormone induction the induction medium was replaced with medium supplemented with insulin. Because of the mitogenic effect of insulin on clonal expansion (Fig. 1), MIX and DEX-induced cells would have a delayed mitotic clonal expansion if they were fed with insulin-supplemented medium. Thus, the BrdUrd labeling experiment was also conducted on day 3 cells, i.e. after the medium change. The result shown in Fig. 3C indicated that the basal level of BrdUrd labeling was observed in cells induced with MIX and DEX, which was replaced with a no-insulin medium. However, when replaced with insulin-supplemented medium, a significant amount of cells induced with MIX and DEX were labeled by BrdUrd, indicating a delayed mitotic clonal expansion. However, the adipocyte differentiation was normal. Thus, the results from cell counting, FACS analysis, and BrdUrd labeling were very consistent with each other. They provided compelling evidence that 3T3-L1 preadipocytes could differentiate into adipocytes without DNA synthesis and mitotic clonal expansion. Due to the lack of exposure to insulin, 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation induced with MIX and DEX was only about half of the normally induced differentiation. To analyze the role of mitotic clonal expansion in the normally induced 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation process, MEK-1 inhibitor PD98059 (18Lazar D.F. Wiese R.J. Brady M.J. Mastick C.C.

It has been reported that PD98059 blocks the activation of Erk1 and Erk2 MAP kinases by IGF-I in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and that it also blocks the proliferation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes (21Boney C.M. Gruppuso P.A. Faris R.A. Frackelton Jr., A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In addition, it has no effect on the adipocyte differentiation (21Boney C.M. Gruppuso P.A. Faris R.A. Frackelton Jr., A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22Font D.E. Mora J. Porras A. Ahn N. Santos E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6068-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). By adding 20 μm PD98059 during the differentiation induction process (from day 0 to day 4), PD98059 almost completely blocked mitotic clonal expansion (Fig. 4A). In the presence of PD98059, the cell number was only slightly increased as compared with noninduced cells. The result of FACS analysis (Fig.4B) was consistent with the cell number counting. In MDI-induced cells treated with PD98059, only a small fraction of cells had DNA synthesis during the clonal expansion period, whereas in control MDI-induced cells, most of the cells had DNA synthesis. Thus, it is clear that PD98059 treatment inhibits mitotic clonal expansion. Although PD98059 blocked mitotic clonal expansion, it had no effect on adipocyte differentiation. As shown in Fig. 4C, in the presence of PD98059, 3T3-L1 preadipocytes differentiated into adipocytes without any difference from adipocytes induced by standard protocol. Results of BrdUrd labeling confirmed the observation that PD98059 blocked mitotic clonal expansion but not adipocyte differentiation (Fig. 4, D and E). The total adipocyte differentiation in the presence or absence of PD98059 was very similar (both around 80% of the cells containing visible triglyceride droplets). However, only 20% of the cells were labeled by BrdUrd in the presence of PD98059, whereas >70% of the cells were labeled by BrdUrd in the standard induced control cells. In differentiated adipocytes, close to 80% of the normally induced adipocytes were labeled by BrdUrd, whereas less than 20% of the adipocytes were labeled by BrdUrd in PD98059-treated cells. Thus, In the presence of PD98059, most differentiated adipocytes had no DNA synthesis and mitosis. During differentiation induction, 3T3-L1 cells started to enter S phase 14 h after the addition of differentiation inducers (Fig. 1C). Thus, the activation of Erk1 and Erk2 by MEK-1 during the first 14 h was investigated. As shown in Fig.5A, in MDI-induced cells, Erk1 and Erk2 were significantly activated (as shown by the increase in the phosphorylated form of Erk1 and Erk2), whereas the addition of PD98059 to MDI-induced cells greatly diminished the phosphorylation of Erk1 and Erk2. In our previous studies (12Jin S. Zhai B. Qiu Z. Wu J. Lane M.D. Liao K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34344-34352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), the protein tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor vanadate blocked 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation without affecting mitotic clonal expansion. Thus, the effect of vanadate on the activation of Erk1 and Erk2 was also investigated. It was clear that vanadate did not affect the MDI-induced activation of Erk1 and Erk2. Of MIX, DEX, and insulin, only insulin, acting through the IGF-I receptor (16Smith P.J. Wise L.S. Berkowitz R. Wan C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9402-9408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Schmidt W. Poll-Jordan G. Loffler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15489-15495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was capable of inducing mitotic clonal expansion (Fig. 1). The results of study of the activation of Erk1 and Erk2 by insulin showed a pattern similar to their activation by MDI (Fig.5B). PD98059 treatment also blocked the activation of Erk1 and Erk2 by insulin, whereas vanadate treatment did not interfere with insulin-activated Erk1 and Erk2 phosphorylation and even slightly increased the phosphorylation of Erk1 and Erk2. MIX alone could also increase the phosphorylation of Erk1 and Erk2, but it caused no mitosis (results not shown). Thus, activation of Erk1 and Erk2 is not sufficient to promote growth-arrested postconfluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes to enter mitotic clonal expansion during differentiation induction. Treatment with DEX alone did not activate Erk1 and Erk2 (results not shown). Mitotic clonal expansion during differentiation induction is a rather unique process for adipocyte differentiation. However, its role in the adipocyte differentiation process has not been fully understood. In the debate over whether this cell proliferation is a required step along the differentiation process or a parallel event activated by differentiation inducers, our studies provided evidence for the latter. As indicated in our previous studies with vanadate, which selectively blocks adipocyte differentiation but not mitotic clonal expansion, mitotic clonal expansion is not likely to be an obligatory step in the adipocyte differentiation process because differentiation is blocked at the event(s) preceding mitotic clonal expansion, which, on the other hand, is not inhibited (12Jin S. Zhai B. Qiu Z. Wu J. Lane M.D. Liao K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34344-34352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the present study, we further analyzed the relationship between 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation induction and mitotic clonal expansion during differentiation induction. By cell number counting and FACS analysis, it was found that two rounds of cell division occurred in the clonal expansion period: (a) a well-synchronized first round of the cell cycle; and (b) a not very synchronized second round of the cell cycle (Fig. 1, A–C). By delaying or omitting the addition of insulin during differentiation induction, mitotic clonal expansion could be delayed or completely prevented (Fig.2, A and B). However, there was still normal adipocyte differentiation under these conditions (Figs. 2 and 3). Thus, mitotic clonal expansion and adipocyte differentiation are two separable events. Importantly, the identification of insulin as the hormone responsible for inducing mitotic clonal expansion (Fig. 1,D and E) indicated that the IGF-I receptor was the important factor responsible for activation of mitotic clonal expansion because insulin acts through the IGF-I receptor in 3T3-L1 cell differentiation induction (12Jin S. Zhai B. Qiu Z. Wu J. Lane M.D. Liao K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34344-34352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 16Smith P.J. Wise L.S. Berkowitz R. Wan C. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9402-9408Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Schmidt W. Poll-Jordan G. Loffler G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15489-15495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During the induction of adipocyte differentiation, IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinase signaling was very important. Without the addition of insulin in differentiation induction, 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation was only about half of the differentiation induced with insulin (Fig. 3). The small amount of hormones, such as insulin and IGF-I, present in the culture medium (containing fetal bovine serum) might also contribute some of this differentiation. Thus, the identification of insulin as the inducer for mitotic clonal expansion indicated that the IGF-I receptor was the important signal initiator for both mitotic clonal expansion and adipocyte differentiation. Based on our previous (12Jin S. Zhai B. Qiu Z. Wu J. Lane M.D. Liao K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34344-34352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and present results, it is likely that the IGF-I receptor activates two signal pathways, which lead to the mitotic clonal expansion and adipocyte differentiation separately. It has been reported that in subconfluent 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, PD98059, a MEK-1 inhibitor, blocks thymidine incorporation and accelerates adipocyte differentiation (21Boney C.M. Gruppuso P.A. Faris R.A. Frackelton Jr., A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Our results with PD98059 treatment in postconfluent 3T3-L1 preadipocyte differentiation induction indicated that PD98059 blocked mitotic clonal expansion during differentiation induction, whereas adipocyte differentiation was not affected (Fig. 4). This is just the opposite of the effect of vanadate, which blocks adipocyte differentiation without affecting mitotic clonal expansion (11Liao K. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12123-12132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 12Jin S. Zhai B. Qiu Z. Wu J. Lane M.D. Liao K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34344-34352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Vanadate blocks adipocyte differentiation by inhibiting the turnover of IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylated c-Crk, therefore blocking the c-Crk-mediated differentiation induction signal (12Jin S. Zhai B. Qiu Z. Wu J. Lane M.D. Liao K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34344-34352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). On the other hand, PD98059 blocked mitotic clonal expansion by inhibiting the activation of MAP kinase (Erk1 and Erk2) by MEK-1 (Fig. 5). Because the activation of Erk1 and Erk2 is important for cell proliferation, inhibition of Erk1 and Erk2 will inevitably affect cell division. Our observation that PD98059 did not affect adipocyte differentiation is consistent with reports by other investigators (21Boney C.M. Gruppuso P.A. Faris R.A. Frackelton Jr., A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 22Font D.E. Mora J. Porras A. Ahn N. Santos E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6068-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In fact, there is evidence that Erk1 and Erk2 MAP kinase activation is not necessary for but antagonizes 3T3-L1 adipocyte differentiation (22Font D.E. Mora J. Porras A. Ahn N. Santos E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6068-6075Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). As expected, vanadate (a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor), which did not affect mitotic clonal expansion but blocked adipocyte differentiation, had no effect on the activation of Erk1 and Erk2 (Fig. 5). Taken together, these results indicate that the IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinase activated by the high concentration of insulin stimulates at least two signal pathways. One pathway leads to the activation of Erk1 and Erk2, which is essential for mitotic clonal expansion, whereas the other pathway, through the adapter molecule c-Crk that is inhibited by vanadate, leads to the adipocyte differentiation."

We have identified a sequence motif (TXP) in the second transmembrane helix of chemokine receptors and investigated its role by theoretical and experimental approaches.

In particular, the chemokine receptor CCR5 is the main co-receptor for macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strains, which are responsible for disease transmission and predominate during the asymptomatic phase of the disease (2Littman D.R.

Chemokines are small globular proteins, 60–100 residues long, comprising a well structured domain, and a flexible NH2 terminus, with a Cys-Cys or Cys-X-Cys motif (where X represents a variable residue) marking the limit between the two parts (1Baggiolini M. Nature. 1998; 392: 565-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (2407) Google Scholar). The mechanisms by which chemokines bind their receptors and induce activation are currently unclear. Mutagenesis studies of chemokines suggest that a major role in binding is played by receptor interactions with their compact domain, while the flexible NH2 terminus is required mainly for receptor activation (5Hemmerich S.

NH2-terminally truncated chemokines usually bind their receptors with wild type affinities but elicit a severely impaired functional response (6Jarnagin K. Grunberger D. Mulkins M. Wong B.

On the receptor side, several studies have shown that its extracellular domains play an essential role in chemokine binding (8LaRosa G.J. Thomas K.M. Kaufmann M.E. Mark R. White M. Taylor L. Gray G.

In particular, the NH2-terminal domain of the receptor was shown to be mandatory for chemokine binding, with several charged and aromatic residues playing a crucial role (10Farzan M. Choe H.

On the other hand, some of us have shown that most of the ligand specificity is encoded in the second extracellular loop of CCR5 (12Samson M. LaRosa G. Libert F. Paindavoine P. Detheux M. Vassart G. Parmentier M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24934-24941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Clearly belonging to the rhodopsin-like family of GPCRs, chemokine receptors share all of the highly conserved sequence motifs characteristic of this family. The overwhelming majority of these sequence motifs are located in the transmembrane region, suggesting the conservation of a common fold for this region throughout the entire rhodopsin-like family. The existence of a conserved fold may in turn imply similar mechanisms in receptor activation involving the membrane-embedded portion of the proteins. A detailed atomic model representing this common fold has at long last become available with the recent determination of the high resolution x-ray structure of bovine rhodopsin (13Palczewski K. Kumasaka T. Hori T. Behnke C.A. Motoshima H. Fox B.A. Le T., I Teller D.C. Okada T. Stenkamp R.E. Yamamoto M. Miyano M. Science. 2000; 289: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5056) Google Scholar). This structure confirms the well documented seven-transmembrane α-helix bundle topology, proposed on the basis of lower resolution structural studies (14Unger V.M. Hargrave P.A. Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F. Nature. 1997; 389: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar). It furthermore provides a detailed atomic picture of the interactions between the transmembrane helices, particularly those involving the conserved GPCR sequence motifs. It has been established that for many receptors, which are activated by small ligands like neurotransmitters, agonist binding and subsequent triggering of activation involves a water-accessible pocket centrally located within the transmembrane helix bundle. This pocket corresponds roughly to the retinal binding site in rhodopsin (15Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Graziano M.P. Tota M.R. FASEB. J. 1995; 9: 745-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 16Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol.

The strong similarity of the transmembrane regions of chemokine receptors to those of other rhodopsin-like GPCRs suggests that these proteins undergo ligand-induced activation processes, involving analogous conformational changes. Some of these changes have been monitored for various GPCRs, using different techniques (for a review, see Ref. 17Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol.

This crucial rigid body motion of a part of TM6 is thought to be enabled by the presence of a highly conserved proline in the middle of the helix (25Gether U. Lin S. Ghanouni P. Ballesteros J.A.

Such a break, denoted a proline kink (PK), is likely to impart the backbone flexibility (16Ji T.H. Grossmann M. Ji I. J. Biol.

Mutations of the conserved Pro in TM6 in several receptors were indeed shown to produce phenotypes ranging from severely impaired expression of the receptor (29Kolakowski Jr., L.F. Lu B. Gerard C.

For instance, proline mutations in the conserved NPXXY motif in TM7 often produce particularly strong phenotypes, including impaired activity (33Wess J. Nanavati S. Vogel Z. Maggio R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 35Vichi P. Whelchel A. Posada J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15407-15414Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). However, although some of the structural rearrangements associated with activation are likely to be conserved throughout the rhodopsin-like receptor family, the extraordinary diversity of ligand types, ranging from small size neurotransmitters to large glycoprotein hormones (17Gether U. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17979-17982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), suggests that receptor subfamilies have presumably evolved specific binding modes with activation mechanisms probably requiring somewhat different structural adaptations. This study investigates such subfamily-specific properties in the chemokine receptors. All chemokine receptors are shown here to share a proline in TM2. Analysis of their aligned sequences also reveals the presence of a conserved threonine residue 2 positions upstream of this Pro forming the TXP motif. Considering that threonine residues have been observed to induce small distortions in α-helices (37Blundell T. Barlow D. Borkakoti N. Thornton J. Nature. 1983; 306: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 38Ballesteros J. Deupi X. Olivella M. Haaksma E. Pardo L. Biophys. J. 2000; 79: 2754-2760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), we hypothesize here that the conjunction of these two conserved and structurally relevant residues in chemokine receptors might constitute a key motif required for proper receptor function. The influence of Thr in Pro-containing helices had been identified earlier for other integral membrane proteins (39Ri Y. Ballesteros J.A. Abrams C.K. Oh S. Verselis V.K. Weinstein H. Bargiello T.A. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2887-2898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is investigated using an approach, which combines theoretical and experimental procedures. The theoretical procedures are aimed at characterizing the effect of the TXP motif on the intrinsic conformational properties of the transmembrane helix and on its putative interactions with other helices in the bundle. To this end, we have performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of an isolated polyalanine helix comprising a TXP motif and several variants thereof in which the Thr residue is replaced by other side chains, Ser, Cys, Val, and Ala, respectively. In addition, using the recently determined three-dimensional structure of rhodopsin as a template, the structural role of this motif in the context of the seven-helix bundle is assessed. This allows us to formulate hypotheses on how the conformational states of the TXP motif-containing helix might act to produce structural changes in the helix bundle. The experimental procedures involve site-directed mutagenesis, in which the Thr of the TXP motif of TM2 in CCR5 is replaced by the same side chains as in the simulation analysis and where Ala is substituted for the Pro in order to abrogate the PK. The different CCR5 mutants are then tested in order to determine their ligand binding and activation properties. Our results reveal a significant correspondence between the modulating effect on the Pro kink angle and helix conformational flexibility by Thr versus other residues in the TXP motif and the activation properties measured experimentally for the corresponding mutants in CCR5. The implications of these findings for chemokine-receptor interactions and chemokine-induced activation are discussed. In this work, we use a general numbering scheme to identify residues in the transmembrane segments of different receptors (28Ballesteros J.A. Weinstein H. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 366-428Crossref Scopus (2509) Google Scholar). Each residue is numbered according to the helix (helix 1 through 7) in which it is located and according to the position relative to the most conserved residue in that helix, arbitrarily assigned to 50. For instance, Pro-2.58 is the proline in the transmembrane helix 2 (TM2), 8 residues following the highly conserved aspartic acid Asp-2.50. Since stable structural motifs are likely to recur in proteins of known structures (40Wintjens R.T. Rooman M.J. Wodak S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 255: 235-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), we also surveyed the recent release of the Protein Data Bank (Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ) for α-helical segments featuring a TXP, SXP, or CXP motif with no other Thr, Ser, or Cys within the PK and no other Pro anywhere in the segment. Since measuring the bending angle requires at least one helical turn prior to the PK and a helical turn following it, we selected helical segments of at least 12 residues. We performed our search in a nonredundant set of protein structures with resolutions of 3 Å or better, identifying 16 helical segments (Protein Data Bank numbers 1AR1, 1B7E, 1B94, 1BDB, 1BPO, 1FCB, 1FIY, 1FVK, 1OCC, 1PJC,1REQ, 1RVE, 1TCO, 1VHB, 2AK3, and 2GST). Detailed analysis of the corresponding structures showed that most of these helices are exposed to solvent, with water molecules often interacting with the backbone at the level of the PK. Since such interactions are not likely to occur in a membrane-embedded helix, structures displaying these interactions were rejected, finally yielding only seven structures (see Table I). The bending angle of these structures is defined as the angle between the axes computed as the least square lines through the backbone atoms (N, Cα, C) of the α-helical part before and after the Pro kink (using the InsightII software, MSI, San Diego).Table IBending angles for TXP motifs found in the Protein Data Bank (PDB)PDB no.MotifHelical segmentPosition of the ProBending angledegrees1VHBTVPA7→A20A15281FIYTDP823→856838441B7ETLP349→379373491RVESRPB37→B59B50261AR1SLPA219→A248A236351AR1SLPB85→B103B98291BPOCRP428→44243841Two segments are taken from the structure of cytochrome coxidase (1AR1), which is a membrane protein.

The other proteins are hemoglobin (1VHB), a phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (1FIY), a transposase inhibitor (1B7E), an endonuclease (1RVE), and the clathrin heavy chain (1BPO). To study the conformational properties of an α-helix containing a TXP motif, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of the model peptides Ace-Ala11-XXX-Ala11-NMe, whereXXX is either AAP, TAP, SAP, CAP, or VAP. These 25-residue peptides were built in the standard α-helical conformation (φ, ψ =58°, −47°). In a hydrophobic environment, the side chains of Ser, Thr, and Cys are most likely to form hydrogen bonds with other polar groups of the protein or of the ligand whenever present. Surveys of known protein structures (41Gray T.M. Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 175: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar, 42McGregor M.J. Islam S.A. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 295-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar) show that in α-helices, these side chains hydrogen-bond primarily the carbonyl group in the preceding turn of the helix (residue i-4 or i-3). For Thr and Ser, such bonds can form only in the g+ org− side chain conformations, whereas for Cys, they can be formed only in the g+ conformation. The g− conformation of Cys is energetically unfavorable because of the steric clash between the Sγ atom and the carbonyl oxygen of residue i-3 (42McGregor M.J. Islam S.A. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 198: 295-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). For these side chains, the t cannot form such hydrogen bonds as it points the OH group away from the backbone. The model peptides were hence built with the Thr and Ser side chains in either g+ or g− and with the Cys side chain ing+. The hydrophobic Val side chain was built in the t conformation. Starting structures were placed in a rectangular box (59 × 37 × 38 Å) containing methane molecules at a density approaching half that of hydrocarbons in lipid bilayer, in order to mimic the plasma membrane environment. The peptide-methane systems were subjected to 500 iterations of energy minimization and then heated to 300 K in 15 ps. This was followed by an equilibration period (15–500 ps) and a production run (500–1500 ps). The simulations were carried out at constant volume and constant temperature (300 K), with the latter maintained through coupling to a heat bath. The particle mesh Ewald method was employed to compute electrostatic interactions (43Darden T. York D. Pedersen L. J. Chem. Phys. 1993; 98: 10089-10092Crossref Scopus (21402) Google Scholar). Structures were collected for analysis every 10 ps during the last 1000 ps of simulation. The molecular dynamics simulations were run with the Sander module of AMBER5 (44Case D.A. Pearlman D.A.

Bending of the Pro containing peptides was measured as described above using backbone atoms of helical segments comprising residues 2–11 (before the Pro) and 16–24 (after the Pro). One-way analysis of the variance plus a posteriori one-sided Dunnett'st tests were performed to determine if the bend angles of the helices containing the TAP, SAP, CAP, and VAP motifs are greater than the bend angle of the helix containing the AAP motif, taken as reference. To choose representative structures for each trajectory, the structures saved during the production run were clustered on the basis of their relative backbone root mean square deviation using the NMRCLUST program (46Kelley L.A. Gardner S.P. Sutcliffe M.J. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 1063-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) with a cut-off of 3 Å. Plasmids encoding the CCR5 mutants studied here were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange method (Stratagene). Following sequencing of the constructs, the mutated coding sequences were subcloned into the bicistronic expression vector pEFIN3 as previously described for generation of stable cell lines (12Samson M.

All constructs were verified by sequencing prior to transfection. CHO-K1 cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies). Constructs encoding wild type or mutant CCR5 in the pEFIN3 bicistronic vector were transfected using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a CHO-K1 cell line expressing an apoaequorin variant targeted to mitochondria (47Rizzuto R. Pinton P. Carrington W. Fay F.S. Fogarty K.E. Lifshitz L.M. Tuft R.A. Pozzan T. Science. 1998; 280: 1763-1766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1818) Google Scholar). Selection of transfected cells was made for 14 days with 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies) and 250 μg/ml zeocin (Invitrogen; for maintenance of the apoaequorin-encoding plasmid), and the population of mixed cell clones expressing wild type or mutant receptors was used for binding and functional studies. Cell surface expression of the receptor variants was measured by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies recognizing different CCR5 epitopes; 2D7 (phycoerythrin-conjugated; Pharmingen), MC-1, MC-4, MC-5, and MC-6 (kindly provided by Mathias Mack, Medizische Poliklinik, Ludwig-Maximilians, University of Munich, Munich, Germany) were detected by anti-mouse IgG phycoerythrin-coupled secondary antibody (Sigma). CHO-K1 cells expressing wild type or mutant CCR5 were collected from plates with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5 mm EDTA, gently pelleted for 2 min at 1000 × g, and resuspended in binding buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% bovine serum albumin). Competition binding assays were performed in Minisorb tubes (Nunc) with 40,000 cells in a final volume of 0.1 ml. The mixture contained 0.05 nm125I-RANTES (2000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as tracer and variable concentrations of competitors (R & D Systems). Total binding was measured in the absence of competitor, and nonspecific binding was measured with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled ligand. Samples were incubated for 90 min at 27 °C, and then bound tracer was separated by filtration through GF/B filters presoaked in 0.5% polyethylenimine (Sigma) for125I-RANTES. Filters were counted in a β-scintillation counter. Binding parameters were determined with the Prism software (GraphPad Software) using nonlinear regression applied to a one-site competition model. Functional response to chemokines was analyzed by measuring the luminescence of aequorin as described (48Stables J. Green A. Marshall F. Fraser N. Knight E. Sautel M. Milligan G. Lee M. Rees S. Anal.

Cells were collected from plates with Ca2+- and Mg2+-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5 mm EDTA. They were then pelleted for 2 min at 1000 × g, resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium at a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml, and incubated for 2 h in the dark in the presence of 5 μm coelenterazine H (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). Cells were diluted 5-fold before use. Agonists in a volume of 50 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were added to 50 μl of cell suspension (50,000 cells), and luminescence was measured for 30 s in a Berthold luminometer. Multiple sequence alignments of the second transmembrane helix of 55 mammalian chemokine receptors were performed. Fig.1 shows alignment of the human and mouse sequences, together with TM2 of bovine rhodopsin. Inspection of the aligned sequences reveals a highly conserved TXP sequence motif in TM2, where X represents a variable hydrophobic residue. Pro, at position 842.58 (84 is the residue number in the CCR5 sequence, and 2.58 is the corresponding number in the general numbering scheme), is completely conserved across all chemokine receptors. The Thr residue is also highly conserved, present in 47 sequences out of 55, while Ser is found in four receptors. The last four receptors have an Ile or Leu in position 2.56. A survey of the 1200 rhodopsin-like GPCRs present in the G-protein Coupled Receptors Database (50Horn F. Weare J. Beukers M.W. Horsch S. Bairoch A. Chen W. Edvardsen O. Campagne F. Vriend G.

These pore-forming toxins are believed to undergo a drastic conformational change upon interaction with a membrane. Since these toxins are inserted into the cytoplasmic membrane without the aid of other proteins such as chaperones or the translocation machinery, characterization of their metamorphosis has been regarded as a novel means for studying membrane-protein interactions (16Lesieur C. Vecsey-Semjen B. Abrami L. Fivaz M. Gisou van der Goot F. Mol. Membr. Biol. 1997; 14: 45-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). A characteristic feature of ε-toxin is its potent neurotoxicity, which is not seen for the structurally well defined pore-forming toxins. Thus, it could serve as a useful tool for extending our knowledge of how proteins gain entry into a membrane. Another characteristic feature of ε-toxin is that activation of the inactive precursor form (ε-protoxin) by proteases such as trypsin, chymotrypsin (17Hunter S.E.C. Clarke I.N. Kelly D.C.

These DNA fragments were cloned into the pT7Blue T-vector (Novagen), and then inserted into the MscI and EcoRI sites of pET22b(+) (Novagen) so that recombinant toxins could be directed to the periplasmic space of E. coli by a signal peptide encoded in the vector. The resultant plasmids, which expressed ε-protoxin and ΔN-ε-protoxin, were designated as pEP1 and pEN1, respectively.To construct an ε-protoxin derivative (PD) and an N-terminally truncated form of it (ΔN-PD), in which a factor Xa recognition sequence, IEGR, was inserted between Lys-273 and Lys-274 of ε-protoxin, sequential PCR amplification was carried out using pEP1 as the template and the following pairs of primers: 5′-TAATACGACTCACTATAGGG-3′ (T7 primer) and 5′-TTTACGACCTTCGATTTTATCTACAGGTATTACATATTCTTG-3′ (antisense, sequence corresponding to IEGR is underlined); and 5′-GATAAAATCGAAGGTCGTAAAGAAAAAAGTAATGATTCAAAT-3′ (sense, sequence corresponding to IEGR is underlined) and 5′-GCTAGTTATTGCTCAGCGGTGG-3′ (T7ter primer). The resulting PCR products were used as mixed templates, and T7 and T7ter were used as primers for a second PCR amplification. The specific PCR products were digested with AvrII and EcoRI, and then cloned into pEP1 and pEN1. The resultant plasmids, which expressed PD and ΔN-PD, were named pEP4 and pEN4, respectively.The MscI-NotI insert DNA fragments from pEP4 and pEN4 were subcloned into the SmaI and NotI sites of pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The EcoRI fragments from these plasmids were inserted into pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). The resultant plasmids, named pEP9 and pEN9, enabled the expression of GST-PD and GST-ΔN-PD fusion proteins, respectively, which contained a pentapeptide recognized by the cyclic-AMP-dependent protein kinase (20Kaelin W.G.J.

The accuracy of all the final DNA constructions was confirmed by DNA sequencing.Expression and Purification of ε-Protoxin DerivativesTransformants of E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) carrying plasmids pEP1, pEN1, pEP4, and pEN4 were used to prepare ε-protoxin, ΔN-ε-protoxin, PD, and ΔN-PD, respectively. Each transformant was grown in 1 liter of LB broth supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (33.4 μg/ml) to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.7. Isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and then the cultures were grown for another 3.5 h. The cells were collected and treated with polymyxin B to obtain the periplasmic fraction, as described previously (21Okabe A. Matsushita O. Katayama S. Hayashi H. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1986; 30: 82-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Proteins in this fraction were precipitated with ammonium sulfate (60% saturation), dialyzed against 5 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and then applied to a DEAE-Sephadex A-25 column (1.5 × 12 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), which had been equilibrated with the buffer used for dialysis. The flow-through fraction was collected and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1m ammonium sulfate. This fraction was then subjected to hydrophobic interaction high performance liquid chromatography on a Phenyl-Superose HR 5/5 column (1 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Proteins were eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient of ammonium sulfate (1–0 m) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Fractions containing ε-protoxin or its derivatives, as determined by SDS-PAGE, were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). Purified toxins were stored at −80 °C.C-terminally truncated PD (ΔC-PD), and N- and C-terminally truncated PD (ΔNC-PD) were obtained from purified PD and ΔN-PD, respectively, by cleaving them at the factor Xa-sensitive site. Digestion with factor Xa (restriction grade, Novagen) and its removal on a Xarrest-agarose column (Novagen) were carried out according to the manufacturer's instructions. GST-PD and GST-ΔN-PD were prepared from cultures ofE. coli BL21 carrying pEP9 and pEN9, respectively, which were grown and induced as described above. The fusion proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions.Mouse Lethality Test and Cytotoxicy AssayThe lethality of ε-protoxin and its derivatives toward mice were determined as described previously (19Minami J. Katayama S. Matsushita O. Matsushita C. Okabe A. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 41: 527-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). A group of 15 male ddY mice weighing 37 g each were injected intravenously with 0.25 ml of the toxin solution, and deaths occurring within 24 h were recorded.MDCK cells were cultured in Eagle's minimum essential medium containing Earle's salts, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, in a cell culture incubator (under 5% CO2 at 37 °C). Freshly trypsinized cells were cultured in 96-well microculture plates for 48 h to give monolayers. The medium was exchanged for 200 μl of minimum essential medium, followed by the addition of 50 μl of PBS or PBS containing one of the purified ε-protoxin derivatives. After a 6-h incubation, the cells in each well were washed with PBS containing Mg2+ and Ca2+. Cell viability was determined by the 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium inner salt (Promega, Madison, WI) conversion assay. The absorbance, which is proportional to the number of viable cells, was read at 490 nm using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader. Percentage of cell viability was calculated as follows: the mean absorbance value of a toxin-group/that of a control.Preparation of Rat Brain Synaptosomal MembranesSynaptosomes were prepared from rat brains as reported previously (22Gray E.G. Whittaker V.P. J. Anat. 1962; 96: 79-88PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, rat brains (7.5 g) were homogenized in nine volumes (w/v) of buffer A (10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.0), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mm benzamidine HCl, 1 μmpepstatin A, 20 μm leupeptin) containing 0.32m sucrose, by means of 10 passes through a glass homogenizer with a Teflon plunger. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min. Then the pellet was re-suspended in a small volume of buffer A containing 0.32m sucrose, loaded onto a 0.8 m sucrose solution layered on a 1.1 m sucrose solution in a centrifuge tube, and finally centrifuged at 63,000 × g for 2 h. The synaptosomal membrane fraction at the 0.8 m/1.1m interface was isolated and collected by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The fraction was re-suspended in buffer A containing 0.14 m NaCl.Preparation of Radiolabeled ε-Protoxin Derivativesε-Protoxin derivatives were radiolabeled with125I as follows. The purified toxin derivatives (8 μg) were incubated with 36.2 GBq of 125I (643.8 GBq/mg; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and IOAD-BEADS iodination reagent (Pierce) in 60 μl of PBS for 15 min at room temperature. The radioiodinated proteins were separated from free iodine by gel filtration on a Sephadex G-25 column (0.75 × 5.5 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated with Tris-buffered saline (TBS; 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4)). The specific activities of 125I-labeled PD, ΔN-PD, ΔC-PD, and ΔNC-PD were 430, 630, 540, and 390 kcpm/μg of protein, respectively.Phosphorylation of ε-protoxin derivatives with 32P was performed as follows. Approximately 300 μg of GST-PD or GST-ΔN-PD were loaded onto a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (bed volume, 100 μl; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and then phosphorylated using the catalytic subunit of bovine heart protein kinase (Sigma) and [γ-32P]ATP (167 TBq/mmol; ICN Biochemicals, Costa Mesa, CA) according to the protocol recommended by the manufacturer. The specific activities of 32P-labeled GST-PD and GST-ΔN-PD were about 21 and 48 kcpm/μg of protein, respectively. [32P]ΔC-PD and [32P]ΔNC-PD were prepared from 32P-labeled GST-PD and GST-ΔN-PD, respectively, by cleavage at the factor Xa-specific site within the C-terminal portion and also at a nonspecific but sensitive site in a GST linker sequence (see “Results”).Formation of an SDS-resistant Complex in Synaptosomal MembranesFifteen nanograms of each 125I-labeled toxin derivative were added to 2.2 μg of synaptosomal membranes in 12 μl of TBS containing 0.1% BSA. After incubation at 37 °C for 90 min, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 17,000 ×g for 5 min. The membrane pellet was washed three times with 200 μl of TBS at 4 °C, and then dissolved by heating in SDS sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% β-mercaptoethanol, 1% SDS, 0.01% bromphenol blue) at 95 °C for 5 min. Samples were electrophoresed on a SDS-PAGE gel, followed by exposure to an imaging plate (Fuji Photo Film, Kanagawa, Japan) for autoradiography.Heteromeric polymerization of ε-protoxin derivatives was carried out using [32P]ΔC-PD and [32P]ΔNC-PD in various ratios. A total of 20–40 ng of each labeled toxin derivative was added to 2.2 μg of synaptosomal membranes in 10 μl of TBS. After incubation at 37 °C for 90 min, SDS sample buffer was added to the reaction mixtures, followed by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. To separate heteromeric polymers, SDS-PAGE was performed on a 5% polyacrylamide gel prepared in a DNA sequencing gel apparatus (800 × 170 × 0.4 mm; Bio-Rad) at 15 mA and room temperature for 20 h.Analytical MethodsN-terminal amino acid sequencing of the purified toxins was performed with a protein sequencer (model 492 Procise; Applied Biosystems), as described previously (23Matsushita O. Jung C.-M. Minami J. Katayama S. Nishi N. Okabe A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3643-3648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were measured using Pierce bicinchoninic acid protein assay reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as the standard.SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205973) Google Scholar). High and low molecular weight marker proteins were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Mass determinations were carried out with a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry instrument (Voyager DE PRO; Applied Biosystems) in the positive linear mode at an acceleration voltage of 15 kV with delayed extraction. Samples were mixed with sinapinic acid (10 mg/ml in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile), which was used as the absorbing matrix. Horse skeletal muscle myoglobin was used as the standard.Circular dichroism (CD) spectra in the far UV region (260–205 nm) were obtained with a J720WI spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) using a cell with a 1-mm light path at 25 °C. All samples were dialyzed against PBS at 4 °C, and the dialysate was also measured as the background. The measurements were repeated four times, and the results were averaged.RESULTSConstruction and Characterization of ε-Protoxin DerivativesBoth an N-terminal peptide of 13 amino acids and a C-terminal peptide of 22 amino acids are removed upon tryptic activation of ε-protoxin. To determine which peptide inactivates ε-protoxin, we constructed recombinant ε-protoxin derivatives without the N- or C-terminal peptide using an E. coliexpression system. The recombinant ε-protoxins with and without the N-terminal peptide were inactive but activated by treatment with trypsin plus chymotrypsin, as shown by the mouse lethality test (TableI). The LD50 of their activated forms was 50 ng/kg of body weight, which coincided with the value reported for ε-toxin from C. perfringens cultures. When the recombinant ε-protoxin without the C-terminal peptide was expressed in E. coli, it precipitated as inclusion bodies, which could be solubilized with 6 m urea, but it could not be recovered in a soluble form after dialysis (data not shown). Thus, we constructed two ε-protoxin derivatives, with and without the N-terminal peptide, respectively, in which IEGR, a coagulation factor Xa recognition sequence, was inserted between Lys-273 and Lys-274 (trypsin cleavage site), as shown in Fig.1 A. This construction enabled the recovery of these proteins, i.e. PD and ΔN-PD, from the periplasmic space and also allowed cleavage at the relevant site with factor Xa.Table ILethality of ɛ-toxin derivatives in miceToxinLD50ng of toxin/kg of body weightɛ-Protoxin/trypsin/chymotrypsin1-aTreatment with trypsin and chymotrypsin was carried out as described by Minami et al.(19).50ΔN-ɛ-protoxin/trypsin/chymotrypsin1-aTreatment with trypsin and chymotrypsin was carried out as described by Minami et al.(19).50PD31,000ΔN-PD31,000ΔC-PD490ΔNC-PD380P-ΔC-PD740P-ΔNC-PD6601-a Treatment with trypsin and chymotrypsin was carried out as described by Minami et al.(19Minami J.

Open table in a new tab PD and ΔN-PD were purified from E. coli cultures to homogeneity, as demonstrated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1 B). Another two derivatives, ΔC-PD and ΔNC-PD, were obtained by treatment of the purified PD and ΔN-PD, respectively, with factor Xa (Fig.1 B). The identities of all the constructs were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing of the recombinant plasmids, N-terminal amino acid sequencing (data not shown), and molecular mass determination by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Fig. 1 A). CD analysis revealed that all the derivatives gave a negative ellipticity band at 215 nm, indicating a predominance of β-structure. Some minor differences were observed in the CD spectra, which may be due to a minor change in the conformation arising from the insertion of the factor Xa recognition sequence or removal of the N- and/or C-terminal sequence(s). However, there were no remarkable differences in the CD spectra, strongly suggesting neither the insertion nor the removal(s) affects the overall structure of ε-protoxin (Fig. 2).Figure 2CD spectra of ε-protoxin and its derivatives. Measurements were carried out on protein solutions in PBS. The mean residue weight values used were calculated from the deduced amino acid sequences.Panel A, ε-protoxin; panel B, PD; panel C, ΔN-PD;panel D, ΔC-PD; panel E, ΔNC-PD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Toxicity of ε-Protoxin DerivativesThe toxicity of the ε-protoxin derivatives was determined by means of a mouse lethality test (Table I). The LD50 of PD with an insertion of the IEGR sequence was 31,000 ng/kg body weight, slightly lower than that previously reported for ε-protoxin purified from C. perfringens cultures (70,000 ng/kg of body weight). The LD50 of ΔN-PD was the same as that of PD, being higher than that of ΔC-PD by a factor of about 60. The LD50 of ΔNC-PD was almost the same as that of ΔC-PD, although both were slightly higher than that reported for trypsin-activated ε-toxin (320 ng/kg). This might be due to the difference in the C-terminal region: ΔNC-PD and ΔC-PD have four extra amino acids after the trypsin cleavage site. To eliminate the possibility that N-terminal processing has an additional activating effect, the toxicities of the four derivatives were determined by means of an in vitro assay method using MDCK cells, which is less sensitive but more accurate than the mouse lethality test (Fig. 3). ΔC-PD and ΔNC-PD exhibited almost the same toxicity toward MDCK cells, and there was no significant difference in the 50% cytotoxicity dose between the two derivatives. No cytotoxicity was detectable for ΔN-PD and PD at the highest concentration (600 ng/ml) used in this study. These results clearly indicate that only cleavage at the C-terminal region is responsible for activation of ε-protoxin.Figure 3Cytotoxicity of ε-protoxin derivatives toward MDCK cells.Various concentrations of ε-protoxin derivatives were added to MDCK cells cultured on microculture plates. Viability was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and is expressed as a percentage of the value for a control culture.

Gibert M. Gillet D. Laurent-Winter C. Boquet P. Popoff M.R. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6480-6487Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and the complex has also been reported in brain homogenates incubated with the toxin (5Nagahama M. Ochi S. Sakurai J. J. Nat. Toxins. 1998; 7: 291-302PubMed Google Scholar). Such a complex may also be formed in synaptosomal membranes, which could be responsible for the neuronal cell death in the hippocampus observed in ε-toxin injected mice (2Miyamoto O. Minami J. Toyoshima T. Nakamura T. Masada T. Nagao S. Negi T. Itano T. Okabe A. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2501-2508Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In order to assess this possibility, membranes were incubated with 125I-labeled toxin derivatives and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 A). In the samples incubated with 125I-labeled ΔC-PD and ΔNC-PD, large SDS-resistant complexes were detected, with apparent molecular masses of ∼200 and 180 kDa, respectively. No SDS-resistant complex was detected in membranes incubated with 125I-labeled PD and ΔN-PD. When equal amounts of 125I-labeled ΔC-PD and unlabeled ΔNC-PD or vice versa were incubated with the membranes, a smeared band corresponding to 200–180-kDa complexes was detected on a SDS-PAGE gel (Fig. 4 B), indicating that both active forms are equally capable of forming the complex.Figure 4Formation of a large SDS-resistant complex by ε-protoxin derivatives in synaptosomal membranes. A, complex formation through homomeric toxin assembly. 125I-Labeled toxin derivatives (15 ng each) were added to synaptosomal membranes (2.2 μg of protein) in 12 μl of TBS containing 0.1% BSA.

The sizes of the molecular mass markers are indicated on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Heptamerization of Active ε-ToxinThe molecular masses of ΔC-PD and ΔNC-PD are 31 and 29 kDa, respectively. Therefore, the 200- or 180-kDa large complex should consist of five toxin molecules and an intrinsic membrane protein, or at maximum seven toxin molecules, if they are unprocessed in the membrane. The result of an experiment involving a mixture of the two active forms suggested that the smeared band corresponds to heteromultimers consisting of the two forms in various ratios, and that the number of toxin molecules per complex is independent of the ratio. If this is the case, complexes of different molecular sizes will form, which can be separated to determine the number of toxin molecules in a complex. The heteromeric complexes formed by 125I-labeled toxins were not well separated even with a SDS-PAGE gel system for large polypeptides. To circumvent this problem, we constructed GST fusion proteins containing a protein kinase recognition site (RRXSV) at the N termini of the two toxin derivatives (Fig. 5 A). These constructs were cleaved by factor Xa not only at the C-terminal specific site but also between the two arginine residues in the RRXSV sequence. Thus, the fusion proteins were purified (Fig. 5 B, lanes 1 and 2), phosphorylated, and cleaved with factor Xa (Fig. 5 B,lanes 3 and 4). The resultant phosphorylated ΔC-PD and ΔNC-PD were designated as P-ΔC-PD and P-ΔNC-PD, respectively. The identities of these protein derivatives were verified by N-terminal amino acid sequencing (data not shown), and molecular mass dete"
https://openalex.org/W2125760322,"The transcription factor NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) plays a central role in mediating Ca2+-dependent gene transcription in a variety of cell types. Sustained increases in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) are presumed to be required for NFAT dephosphorylation by the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein calcineurin and its subsequent nuclear translocation. Here, we provide the first identification and characterization of NFAT in native smooth muscle, showing that NFAT4 is the predominant isoform detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis. PDGF induces NFAT4 translocation in smooth muscle, leading to an increase in NFAT transcriptional activity. NFAT4 activation by PDGF depends on Ca2+ entry through voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels, because its nuclear accumulation is prevented by the Ca2+ channel blocker nisoldipine and the K+ channel opener pinacidil. Interestingly, elevation of [Ca2+]i by membrane depolarization or ionomycin treatment are not effective stimuli for NFAT4 nuclear accumulation, indicating that Ca2+ influx is necessary but not sufficient for NFAT4 activation. In contrast, membrane depolarization readily activates the Ca2+-dependent transcription factor CREB (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein). The calcineurin blockers CsA and FK506 also prevented the PDGF-induced NFAT4 nuclear localization. These results indicate that both the nature of the calcium signal and PDGF-induced modulation of nuclear import-export of NFAT are critical for NFAT4 activation in this tissue.

In the gut, the phasic behavior of ileal smooth muscle cells that is essential for the normal function of this tissue is determined by recurrent action potentials that are mediated by voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (VDCC). These action potentials deliver surges of Ca2+ to the interior of the cell in the form of repetitive Ca2+ spikes (3Sanders K.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Ca2+ signal modulation in smooth muscle takes on additional forms, including localized transient releases of Ca2+ through ryanodine receptors in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, known as Ca2+ sparks, as well as propagating Ca2+ waves that traverse the length of the cell and display distinctive frequency and amplitude properties (2Jaggar J.H.

It is becoming increasingly clear that [Ca2+]i also serves an important second messenger role in the regulation of gene expression in smooth muscle. We have recently demonstrated that activation of the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) and subsequent c-fos expression can be induced by depolarization in native arterial smooth muscle, a process that is mediated by calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMK) and is dependent on Ca2+ influx through VDCC (6Cartin L. Lounsbury K.M. Nelson M.T. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-sensitive transcription factor, NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells) may play a role in smooth muscle, as suggested by results from the A7r5 aortic smooth muscle cell line (7Boss V.

Chem. 1998; 273: 19664-19671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), but this possibility has remained unexplored in native tissue. NFAT represents a family of Ca2+-dependent transcription factors comprising four well-characterized members, designated NFAT1 (NFATc2/p), NFAT2 (NFATc1/c), NFAT3 (NFATc4), and NFAT4 (NFATc3/x) (8Rao A.

Although originally thought to be largely restricted to cells of the immune system, NFAT has since been shown to play a role in other cell types, including cardiac and skeletal myocytes and neurons. In non-immune cells, NFAT has been shown to regulate heart valve development, control the differentiation of skeletal myocytes into slow- or fast-twitch fiber types, and contribute to the development of hypertrophy in cardiac and skeletal myocytes (9Ranger A.M.

Mermelstein P.G. Stankunas K. Neilson J.R. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Most NFAT isoforms are constitutively expressed and exist as transcriptionally inactive, cytosolic phosphoproteins. Stimuli that activate NFAT do so, in part, by increasing [Ca2+]i, and NFAT activation appears to be strictly dependent on this increase. Upon elevation of [Ca2+]i, the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin dephosphorylates NFAT, leading to the unmasking of nuclear localization signals and the translocation of NFAT to the nucleus (15Timmerman L.A. Clipstone N.A. Ho S.N. Northrop J.P. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1996; 383: 837-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 16Luo C. Shaw K.T. Raghavan A. Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F.

Immunity. 2000; 12: 359-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation of NFAT has been shown to be inhibited by the immunosuppressant drugs cyclosporin A (CsA) and FK506 (16Luo C. Shaw K.T. Raghavan A. Aramburu J. Garcia-Cozar F. Perrino B.A. Hogan P.G. Rao A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8907-8912Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of NFAT is dynamically dependent on a balance between the cytosolic phosphatase activity of calcineurin and the activity of incompletely characterized nuclear kinases, which promote export of NFAT from the nucleus. Both import and export processes can be regulated in an isoform-selective manner (18Chow C.W. Dong C. Flavell R.A. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 5227-5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 19Chow C.W. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 702-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 20Zhu J. Shibasaki F.

Stimuli that provoke a sustained moderate elevation in global [Ca2+]i have consistently been shown to effectively promote NFAT nuclear translocation in non-excitable cells. In these cell types, the Ca2+requirement may be provided by release from intracellular stores coupled with influx of extracellular Ca2+ through capacitative Ca2+ entry pathways (23Luckhoff A. Clapham D.E. Biophys. J. 1994; 67: 177-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In hippocampal neurons, NFAT activation is mediated by Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels, but not NMDA receptors, suggesting the possibility of privileged communication between specific Ca2+ entry pathways and NFAT activation (14Graef I.A. Mermelstein P.G. Stankunas K. Neilson J.R. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). NFAT activity can also be induced in neurons by a brief depolarizing stimulus, indicating that the Ca2+ signaling component of NFAT activation may display cell-type specific requirements. Ca2+ oscillations, which can occur in both excitable and non-excitable cells, can also increase the efficiency and specificity of gene expression by selectively activating certain transcription factors, including NFAT (24Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar, 25Dolmetsch R.E. Xu K. Lewis R.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) plays an important role in a number of pathophysiological processes. It has been shown to contribute to the healing of gastrointestinal ulcers, stimulate colonic tumor growth by promoting angiogenesis (26Piazuelo E. Jimenez P. Lanas A. Garcia A. Esteva F. Sainz R. Eur. Surg. Res. 2000; 32: 191-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 27Hsu S. Huang F. Friedman E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 165: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease (28Beck P.L. Podolsky D.K. Inflamm. Bowel Dis. 1999; 5: 44-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). PDGF is also a potent smooth muscle cell mitogen that has been shown to activate NFAT promoter-reporter constructs in cultured smooth muscle cells (7Boss V. Abbott K.L. Wang X.F. Pavlath G.K. Murphy T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19664-19671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Although NFAT has recently received considerable attention in the context of cardiac and skeletal muscle, the existence of NFAT in native smooth muscle has not been demonstrated. Likewise, the activation requirements for NFAT in this tissue have not been described. We show here that NFAT4 is the predominant isoform expressed in native smooth muscle. We provide evidence that PDGF induces a nuclear translocation of NFAT4 that is dependent on the influx of extracellular Ca2+ through L-type VDCCs. We further show that Ca2+ influx alone is not sufficient to induce nuclear accumulation of NFAT4 and demonstrate differential effects of distinct Ca2+ signals on the activation of the transcription factors NFAT4 and CREB. Adult female CD-1 mice (20–25 g, Charles River Laboratories, Canada) were euthanized by peritoneal injection of pentobarbital solution (200 mg/kg). For isolation of ileal strips, a segment of ileum was detached from mesenterium and the outer longitudinal and several layers of the inner circular smooth muscle were removed. Ileal smooth muscle sheets were cut into sections for use in immunofluorescence experiments. For RT-PCR analysis of NFAT expression in isolated cells, smooth muscle cells were enzymatically dispersed as described by Gomez and Swärd (29Gomez M. Sward K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1714-C1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the sheets were cut into pieces and incubated for 10 min at 35 °C in 2 ml of the dispersion medium (in mm: 110 NaCl, 5 KCl, 0.16 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 10 HEPES, 10 NaHCO3, 0.5 KH2PO4, 0.5 NaH2PO4, 10 glucose, 0.49 EDTA, 10 taurine, pH 7.0) containing 1.5 mg ml−1 collagenase (FLUKA, Switzerland), 1 mg ml−1 papain (Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Lakewood, NJ), 4.5 mg ml−1 bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and 1 mg ml−1 dithioerythiol. After isolation, cells were allowed to settle in a chamber mounted on an inverted microscope and collected using a microbore pipette (5–10 μm diameter). The cells were transferred to nuclease-free microcentrifuge tubes, flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C for future use in RT-PCR. Ileal sheets (1–3 mm wide, 5–8 mm long) were treated at room temperature with various agents and times as specified in the text and then mounted onto glass slides. After air-drying for 5 min, sheets were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 15 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and blocked for 1 h with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Primary antibody dilutions in 2% bovine serum albumin/PBS, rabbit anti-NFAT4/c3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) (1:250 dilution) and rabbit anti-P-CREB (1:250 dilution), were applied overnight at 4 °C. Secondary antibody, Cy3-anti-rabbit IgG or Cy5-anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) (1:500 dilution) was applied for 1 h at 25 °C. The fluorescent nucleic acid dye YOYO-1 (1:10000 dilution) was used for identification of nuclei. After washing, the sheets were mounted (Aqua Polymount mounting medium, Polysciences) and examined at × 40 magnification using a Bio-Rad 1000 laser scanning confocal microscope. Red fluorescence of NFAT4/P-CREB was measured at an excitation wavelength of 550 and/or 650 nm, and emission was measured at 570 and/or 670 nm, for Cy3 and Cy5 respectively. Specificity of immune staining was confirmed by the absence of fluorescence in sheets incubated with primary or secondary antibodies alone. For scoring of NFAT4- and P-CREB-positive nuclei, multiple fields for each smooth muscle strip were imaged and counted by two independent observers under double-blind conditions. For quantification, a cell was considered positive if co-localization (yellow) was observed in the nucleus, whereas a cell was considered negative if no co-localization (green) was visualized. Total RNA was prepared from tissue or isolated ileal smooth muscle cells using the Trizol-LS Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and the Micro-FastTrack 2.0 RNA Isolation Kit (Invitrogen) respectively, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was DNase-treated and then reverse-transcribed using oligo-dT primers and the Sensiscript RT Kit (Qiagen), as described by the manufacturer. PCR reactions were performed using AmpliTaq Gold (Perkin Elmer Life Sciences) with the following sets of primer pairs: for NFAT1, F, 5′-ACATCCGCGTGCCCGTGAAAGT-3′ and R, 5′-CTCGGGGCAGTCTGTTGTTGGATG-3′); NFAT2, F, 5′-CATGCGCCCTCTGTGGCCCTCAAA-3′ and R, 5′-GGAGCCTTCTCCACGAAAATG-3′); NFAT3, F, 5′-GAAGCTACCCTCCGGTACAGAG-3′ and R, 5′-GCTTCATAGCTGGCTGTAGCC-3′); NFAT4, F, 5′-CTACTGGTGGCCATCCTGTTGT-3′ and R, AGCTCGTGGGCAGAGCGCTGAGAGCACTC-3′); and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH,CLONTECH). Amplification conditions were 94 °C, 10 min; 30–45 cycles at 94 °C, 1 min; 55 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 2 min and extension for 10 min at 72 °C. Amplified PCR products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and detected by ethidium bromide staining. Tissue samples were homogenized in cell lysis buffer (in mm: 50 Tris, 150 NaCl, 1 EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, pH 8.0) containing phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mm), pepstatin (20 μg/ml), leupeptin (20 μg/ml), and aprotinin (0.5 μg/ml). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford dye-binding assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Aliquots of tissue extracts containing equal amounts of protein were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 8% gels using the Laemmli buffering system. Proteins were transferred to Immuno-Blot polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad) and blocked by rocking for 1 h at room temperature in blocking buffer (Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat dry milk). Blots were exposed to primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, multiply washed with TBST, treated with secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated) for 45 min, and followed by a final series of washes with TBST. Primary (rabbit polyclonal anti-NFAT4, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and secondary antibodies were prepared in blocking buffer, and all treatments were performed at room temperature. Transgenic mice, uniformly expressing a promoter construct containing three tandem copies of the interleukin-2 promoter distal NFAT-binding domain inserted into a minimal expression vector upstream of a luciferase construct, were used to determine NFAT transcriptional activity. In a given experiment, ileal strips were collected from 2 mice, pooled, and then divided into individual treatment groups (typically 4–6 strips/group). After treatment, samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until ready for processing. Frozen samples were pulverized and homogenized in 50–100 μl of 1× cell culture lysis reagent (Invitrogen) with the aid of a motorized pestle. An aliquot of clarified supernatant (20 μl), obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min, was added to 100 μl of luciferase substrate reagent (Invitrogen) and assayed for luciferase activity using a Turner Designs 20/20 luminometer. Optical density measurements were normalized to starting protein concentration determined using a protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad) and expressed as relative luciferase units. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. where applicable. All statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad software (Prism 3.0). Statistical significance was determined using the two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. We have used RT-PCR analysis and immunoblotting to identify NFAT isoforms expressed in native ileal smooth muscle. Previous results from experiments employing the rat A7r5 aortic smooth muscle cell line suggested that the NFAT1 and NFAT2 isoforms are expressed in smooth muscle (7Boss V. Abbott K.L. Wang X.F. Pavlath G.K. Murphy T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19664-19671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), although expression of additional isoforms could not be ruled out in this study. Using RT-PCR analysis, we find no evidence for NFAT1 or NFAT2 expression in native ileal smooth muscle sheets (Fig. 1 B) using primer pairs that efficiently amplify NFAT1 from spleen and NFAT2 from thymus (Fig. 1 A). Instead, we find that the NFAT4 and, perhaps to a lesser extent, the NFAT3 isoforms are constitutively expressed, as shown in Fig. 1 B. We have found a similar pattern of NFAT isoform expression in native arterial smooth muscle of the aorta and the cerebral vasculature (30Hill-Eubanks D.C. Stevenson A.S. Nelson M.T. FASEB J. 2000; 14: A576Google Scholar, 31Stevenson, A. S., Gomez, M. F., Hill-Eubanks D. C., and Nelson, M. T. (2000) FASEB J..Google Scholar). NFAT4 appears to be the predominant isoform expressed, based on results obtained from an RT-PCR analysis of isolated smooth muscle cells (Fig. 1 C). NFAT3 identified in RT-PCR analysis of intact ileal strips (Fig.1 B) may represent expression in co-isolated neurons of the nerve plexus between longitudinal and circular smooth muscle layers, which is consistent with previous observations in neurons (14Graef I.A. Mermelstein P.G. Stankunas K. Neilson J.R. Deisseroth K. Tsien R.W. Crabtree G.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 703-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). At the protein level, NFAT4 isolated from ileal smooth muscle strips runs as multiple high molecular mass bands on SDS gels with a single band at ∼160 kDa, which is similar to that previously reported in Jurkat cells (32Lyakh L. Ghosh P. Rice N.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2475-2484Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and as additional, apparently nonspecific bands at 75–100 kDa (Fig. 1 D). Differences in the mobility of the high molecular mass band between smooth muscle and thymus (which expresses NFAT4 at high levels) may reflect tissue differences in the expression of known NFAT4 splice variants (33Imamura R. Masuda E.S. Naito Y. Imai S. Fujino T. Takano T. Arai K. Arai N. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3455-3463PubMed Google Scholar). The potent smooth muscle cell mitogen PDGF has been previously shown to induce NFAT activation in the rat A7r5 aortic smooth muscle cell line (7Boss V. Abbott K.L. Wang X.F. Pavlath G.K. Murphy T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19664-19671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To explore NFAT activation in native smooth muscle, we treated ileal smooth muscle strips with PDGF (10 ng/ml) for 30 min and analyzed for NFAT nuclear accumulation by immunostaining with an antibody specific for NFAT4. Sections were also stained with the DNA binding dye YOYO-1 to identify nuclei. PDGF induces nuclear translocation of NFAT4 in ileal smooth muscle (Fig.2), with 47.4 ± 6.7% of the cells in PDGF-treated strips exhibiting nuclear localization of NFAT4, compared with 5.8 ± 1.2% of the cells in untreated control strips. PDGF-induced nuclear accumulation is completely blocked in the presence of the calcineurin inhibitors CsA or FK506 (Fig. 2), which reduce the percentage of NFAT-positive nuclei to 5.7 ± 5.7 and 4.3 ± 2.0, respectively. PDGF-induced NFAT4 nuclear translocation appears to reflect a direct action on smooth muscle rather than an indirect action through associated neurons in the plexus layer since stimulation with PDGF in the presence of a mixture of neurotransmitter inhibitors that includes atropine, tetrodotoxin, phentolamine, and propanolol (1 μm each), does not prevent NFAT4 nuclear accumulation (60.9 ± 12.8% NFAT4-positive nuclei, Fig. 2). The percentage of NFAT4-positive nuclei (5.4 ± 1.9%) in ileal strips treated with the neurotransmitter inhibitory mixture alone does not significantly differ from controls (Fig. 2). Nuclear translocation of NFAT4 is first evident at 10–15 min after exposure to PDGF, with a clustering of NFAT4 staining in the vicinity of the nuclear envelope (Fig. 3). After 30 min of PDGF treatment, redistribution to the nucleus is observed. The clustering of NFAT4 around the nucleus prior to translocation suggests the possibility that a distinct docking step is involved in the nuclear translocation process. To determine whether the observed NFAT4 nuclear accumulation is associated with increased transcriptional activity, ileal smooth muscle strips from a transgenic mouse that uniformly expresses an NFAT luciferase promoter-reporter construct (34Rincon M. Flavell R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1074-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) were treated with PDGF (10 ng/ml) and harvested after 6 or 24 h in serum-free medium (37 °C). Samples were homogenized as described under “Experimental Procedures” and assayed for protein-normalized luciferase activity. We found that the PDGF-induced NFAT4 accumulation is accompanied by an increase in NFAT-dependent transcriptional activity (Fig. 4). This transcriptional activity is transient, being evident at 6-h post-PDGF treatment, but not after 24 h, and is effectively induced by a brief (30 min) exposure to PDGF. [Ca2+]i regulates nuclear accumulation of NFAT, and both the source of Ca2+and the nature of the Ca2+ signal may be important in determining the nature of the response (24Dolmetsch R.E. Lewis R.S. Goodnow C.C. Healy J.I. Nature. 1997; 386: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar, 25Dolmetsch R.E. Xu K. Lewis R.S. Nature. 1998; 392: 933-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (1659) Google Scholar). In ileal strips, treatment with the dihydropyridine inhibitor of voltage-dependent L-type Ca2+ channels, nisoldipine (100 nm), results in a complete abrogation of PDGF-induced NFAT4 nuclear accumulation (Fig.5 C; 6.7 ± 5.6% NFAT4-positive nuclei). Nisoldipine is equally effective when added before (Fig. 5 C) or concurrent with PDGF exposure (data not shown). Thus, PDGF-induced mobilization of NFAT4 is critically dependent on Ca2+ influx through VDCC. To provide additional evidence for VDCC involvement, we examined the effects of hyperpolarizing the cell membrane, which would decrease Ca2+ entry by closing VDCC. Pinacidil (1 μm), which induces membrane hyperpolarization by opening ATP-sensitive K+ channels (35Quayle J.M. Nelson M.T. Standen N.B. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1165-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar), completely blocked the PDGF-induced nuclear translocation of NFAT4 (Fig. 5 D; 6.74 ± 1.67% NFAT4-positive nuclei). These results indicate that functional VDCC are required for PDGF-induced nuclear accumulation of NFAT. To determine whether direct activation of VDCC is sufficient to induce NFAT4 nuclear accumulation, we treated ileal smooth muscle with 60 mm K+for up to 30 min, a treatment that has been previously shown to cause a graded and sustained increase in [Ca2+]i in this preparation as a result of VDCC activation (29Gomez M. Sward K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1714-C1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Sward K. Nilsson B.O. Hellstrand P. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1754-C1763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, depolarization was incapable of inducing the nuclear accumulation of NFAT4 (Fig. 5 and6, 10.5 ± 3.5% NFAT4-positive nuclei). Similar results were obtained with the Ca2+ionophore ionomycin (1 μm, 30 min, 13.1 ± 2.3% NFAT4-positive nuclei, n = 4, total cells = 930). These data indicate that although Ca2+ influx is necessary for PDGF-mediated NFAT4 nuclear accumulation, it is not a sufficient stimulus alone. Further, we tested whether PDGF was still capable of inducing NFAT4 nuclear accumulation in the presence of a depolarizing stimulus. The PDGF-stimulated increase in NFAT4 nuclear localization was completely blocked in ileal strips treated for 30 min with PDGF (10 ng/ml) and 60 mm K+ (Fig. 5, 8.6 ± 3.8% positive nuclei). These results suggest that NFAT4 nuclear accumulation may require the repetitive Ca2+-spiking characteristic of ileal smooth muscle (3Sanders K.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1992; 54: 439-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), which might be modified by PDGF, but is completely abolished by high K+ (29Gomez M. Sward K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1714-C1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Sward K. Nilsson B.O. Hellstrand P. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1754-C1763Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In time course experiments, neither continuous exposure (30 min) nor brief pulses of 60 mm K+ (5, 10, 15 min) were able to induce NFAT4 nuclear accumulation (Fig. 6). Even when time course experiments were performed in the presence of the L-type Ca2+ channel agonist Bay K 8644 to increase Ca2+ entry, depolarization with 60 mm K+ failed to induce NFAT4 nuclear accumulation (data not shown). We have previously reported that depolarizing stimuli activate the Ca2+-sensitive transcription factor CREB in cerebral artery smooth muscle (6Cartin L. Lounsbury K.M. Nelson M.T. Circ. Res. 2000; 86: 760-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), increasing the fraction of nuclei staining for P-CREB. This response is dependent on the influx of extracellular Ca2+ through VDCC and appears to be mediated by CaMK. In ileal smooth muscle, depolarization with 60 mmK+ also results in a rapid and robust increase in P-CREB (Fig. 7 B). Like NFAT4, CREB is also activated by PDGF in ileal smooth muscle, as evidenced by the prominent nuclear P-CREB staining observed after 30 min of PDGF stimulation (Fig. 7 C). Thus, CREB is activated by both PDGF and depolarizing stimuli, whereas depolarization-induced Ca2+ influx through VDCC alone is insufficient to stimulate NFAT4 nuclear translocation. These results clearly indicate that these two Ca2+-sensitive transcription factors respond differentially to a given Ca2+-elevating stimulus and provide evidence for Ca2+ signal discrimination at the transcription factor level. We have found that NFAT4 is expressed in native smooth muscle and can be activated by stimulation with the smooth muscle mitogen PDGF. This activation is dependent on Ca2+ influx through VDCCs and can be blocked by calcineurin inhibitors CsA and FK506. Surprisingly, sustained increases in global [Ca2+]i induced by treatment with ionomycin or membrane depolarization with K+ failed to activate NFAT4 in this tissue. The predominant isoform of NFAT expressed in native ileal smooth muscle is NFAT4, which we have also found abundantly expressed in aortic and cerebral artery smooth muscle tissue (30Hill-Eubanks D.C. Stevenson A.S. Nelson M.T. FASEB J. 2000; 14: A576Google Scholar, 31Stevenson, A. S., Gomez, M. F., Hill-Eubanks D. C., and Nelson, M. T. (2000) FASEB J..Google Scholar). NFAT1 and NFAT2 isoforms, which are ubiquitously expressed in cells of the immune system and in other cell types, do not appear to be constitutively expressed at significant levels in these tissues. This is in sharp contrast to results reported for the A7r5 smooth muscle cell line, which expresses both NFAT1 and NFAT2 isoforms (7Boss V. Abbott K.L. Wang X.F. Pavlath G.K. Murphy T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19664-19671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), suggesting that significant changes in the regulation of NFAT expression take place during the process of cell line establishment. Although it is known that NFAT4 is highly expressed in thymus cells (37Masuda E.S. Naito Y. Tokumitsu H. Campbell D. Saito F. Hannum C. Arai K. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2697-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) and is also expressed in skeletal muscle (33Imamura R. Masuda E.S. Naito Y. Imai S. Fujino T. Takano T. Arai K. Arai N. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3455-3463PubMed Google Scholar), these data provide the first evidence that this NFAT isoform is highly expressed in smooth muscle. It has become axiomatic that stimuli that induce sustained increases in [Ca2+]i are sufficient and necessary for NFAT nuclear accumulation. The failure of depolarization-induced elevation in [Ca2+]i to induce NFAT4 nuclear accumulation in native ileal smooth muscle was therefore unexpected. Ca2+ influx is clearly necessary for PDGF-induced NFAT4 nuclear translocation in native ileal smooth muscle, as evidenced by the ability of VDCC inhibitors and membrane hyperpolarizing agents to completely prevent this translocation. It is possible that modulation of the Ca2+ signal may play an important facilitating role in PDGF-induced NFAT4 nuclear accumulation, such that the tonic increase in [Ca2+]i induced by depolarization with K+ may lack information that is critical to the response of NFAT in this tissue. In ileal smooth muscle, the presence of spontaneous action potentials generates repetitive [Ca2+]i spiking that may constitute an appropriately modulated Ca2+ signal. PDGF has also been shown to give rise directly to Ca2+ waves or oscillations (38Ridefelt P. Yokote K. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Growth Factors. 1995; 12: 191-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 39Nie L. Mogami H. Kanzaki M. Shibata H. Kojima I. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 763-769PubMed Google Scholar). The spontaneous phasic contractile behavior and repetitive Ca2+ spiking is blocked in the presence of 60 mm K+, and it is likely that any complex or modulated Ca2+ signal generated by PDGF stimulation would be similarly abrogated in the presence of depolarizing concentrations of K+. In either case, a modulated Ca2+ signal would be replaced by tonic increases in [Ca2+]i. The fact that PDGF fails to induce NFAT4 nuclear localization in the presence of 60 mm K+ is consistent with a role for Ca2+ signal modulation because elevated global Ca2+ induced by depolarization would otherwise be predicted to increase, not decrease, PDGF-induced NFAT4 nuclear translocation. If spontaneous action potentials contribute an appropriately modulated Ca2+ signal, these results further suggest that nuclear export greatly exceeds Ca2+-driven nuclear import in ileal smooth muscle; otherwise, the oscillating Ca2+ signal provided by spontaneous phasic contractions would be predicted to promote the constitutive nuclear localization of NFAT. Thus, ileal smooth muscle may be unique with respect to NFAT activation in that a sufficient Ca2+ signal may exist under basal conditions, and the regulation of nuclear export dynamics may be the critical factor that determines the cellular localization of NFAT. Accordingly, PDGF may induce NFAT4 nuclear accumulation primarily by decreasing the basal rate of nuclear export. Nuclear export of various NFAT isoforms is promoted by the activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), which phosphorylates conserved serines in the N terminus that are required for nuclear export. There is evidence that PDGF inhibits GSK-3 activity in fibroblasts, suggesting a possible mechanism by which PDGF might promote NFAT nuclear accumulation (40Brady M.J. Bourbonais F.J. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14063-14066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). NFAT4 is unique among NFAT isoforms in that its nuclear export can be regulated by the activity of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK; Ref. 21Chow C.W. Rincon M. Cavanagh J. Dickens M. Davis R.J. Science. 1997; 278: 1638-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) and it is conceivable that the effects of PDGF on NFAT4 may be caused by inhibition of JNK activity. NFAT nuclear import can also be inhibited by a number of mechanisms and PDGF might act to disinhibit these processes or directly promote NFAT4 translocation by other means. Although inhibition of nuclear export or potentiation of import represent attractive mechanisms to account for these results, the Ca2+-independent mechanisms by which PDGF may regulate NFAT4 localization remain to be elucidated. Unlike NFAT4, CREB is activated by membrane depolarization with elevated external K+ in ileal smooth muscle, suggesting that CREB is capable of responding to global increase in [Ca2+]i alone, whereas NFAT4 is not. These results clearly indicate that Ca2+-sensitive transcription factors are capable of discriminating between different Ca2+ signals, resulting in their differential activation. The physiological or pathological implication of differential transcription factor activation mechanisms has not been explored in native smooth muscle, which exhibits a rich diversity of Ca2+ signaling modalities and a phenotypic plasticity that clearly reflects the activity of underlying genetic regulatory mechanisms. The targets of Ca2+-sensitive transcription factors that may play a role in maintaining the contractile smooth muscle phenotype, or contribute to adaptive or pathological changes in smooth muscle structural or functional properties, are unknown. Smooth muscle cells have been found to undergo rapid and profound phenotypic changes during culture in vitro (41Owens G.K. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 164: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In guinea pig ileal strips cultured in the presence of serum, it has been shown that force development in response to contractile stimuli is diminished and that expression of L-type Ca2+ channels is down-regulated. The down-regulation of VDCCs is prevented by treatment with a dihydropyridine VDCC blocker (29Gomez M. Sward K. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1714-C1720Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by pretreatment with the calcineurin inhibitor CsA (42Gomez M. Håkansson A. Larsson B. Hellstrand P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: A103Google Scholar), suggesting that the changes in VDCC expression are Ca2+-dependent and that the Ca2+-dependent modulation of VDCC expression may be regulated by NFAT. A number of ion channel genes and regulatory subunits, including those for L-type Ca2+ channels (e.g. α1C), ryanodine receptors (e.g. RYR2), IP3 receptors (e.g. IP3R1), voltage-dependent K+ channels (e.g. Kv1.5) and the β subunit of the large conductance Ca2+-dependent K+ channel contain NFAT response elements within their promoter regions. These observations suggest the possibility that this Ca2+-dependent transcription factor may play a role in regulating Ca2+ homeostasis by regulating the expression of ion channel gene assemblages. Ultimately, the identification of NFAT-regulated genes in native smooth muscle will be crucial for developing an understanding of the physiological role that this transcription factor plays in this genetically dynamic tissue.

The proposed model for Src action defines a temporal sequence in which GRK2 phosphorylates the β2-adrenergic receptor, and an Src-arrestin complex then targets to the receptor, facilitating internalization and signaling to Ras (3Luttrell L.M.

In the current work we reveal that Src targets a conditional SH2-binding site of the β2-adrenergic receptor, is recruited to the phospho-Tyr-350 receptor, is activated, and then phosphorylates GRK2. This temporal sequence is shown to be obligate for agonist-induced desensitization.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell CultureHuman epidermoid carcinoma cells (A431) and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT), penicillin (60 μg/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) and grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2and 95% air at 37 °C. Cells were stably transfected with mammalian expression vectors harboring the constitutively active form (Y527F) or the dominant-inhibitory form (K295R/Y527F) of c-Src, the hamster wild-type β2-adrenergic receptor, the hamster Y350F mutant form of the β2-adrenergic receptor, or a green fluorescent protein-tagged β2-adrenergic receptor fusion protein (8Gagnon A.W. Kallal L. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6976-6981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), as previously described (13Lin F. Wang H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19025-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar).Suppression via Antisense OligodeoxynucleotidesAntisense, sense, and control missense oligodeoxynucleotides with the same base composition, but in scrambled order, were synthesized and purified to cell culture-grade (Operon, Alameda, CA), as described (15Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Before addition to cells, oligodeoxynucleotides were mixed at a ratio of 1:3 (w/w) withN-[1-(2,3-dioleoyloxy)propyl]-N,N,N-trimethylammonium methylsulfate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), a cationic diacylglycerol in liposomal form that serves as a delivery vehicle. A431 cells were treated with oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs, 5 μg/ml) for at least 48–72 h prior to the analysis of the expression of the target molecule. The sequences employed for the antisense and sense ODNs for Src were 24 nucleotides in length, terminating with the initiator codon for Src. Missense was created using a random sequence with the same base composition as the antisense ODN for Src.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting by Antibodies against β2-Adrenergic Receptor, c-Src, or GRK2For most studies, A431 cells were either untreated or stimulated with 10 μmisoproterenol for periods up to 60 min. Cells were harvested and lysed in a lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet-P40, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 100 μg/ml bacitracin, 100 μg/ml benzamidine, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm KH2PO4, 10 mm sodium molybdate, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 20 min. After centrifugation of the cell debris at 10,000 × g for 15 min, the lysates were precleared with protein A/G-agarose for 90 min at 4 °C. The mixture was then subjected to immunoprecipitation for 2 h with antibodies specific for the β-adrenergic receptor (CM04), c-Src, or GRK2. The primary antibodies were linked covalently to a protein A/G-agarose matrix. Immune complexes were washed three times with RIPA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1% Triton X-100, pH 8.0) and separated on 4 to 12% linear gradient SDS-acrylamide Laemmli gels. Immunoblotting and detection of Src, of GRK2, and of the β2-adrenergic receptor by immunostaining were performed as previously described (13Lin F. Wang H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19025-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The anti-phospho-Src (Y416) antibodies were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY).Epifluorescence ImagingMicroscopy of live cells stably transfected to express a green fluorescent protein-tagged β-adrenergic receptor fusion protein was performed on the Eclipse TE300 (Nikon) inverted microscope equipped with a × 40 objective and a set of filters (13Lin F. Wang H. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19025-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Images were acquired using MicroMAX Imaging System (Princeton Instruments Inc.) and WinView32 software. Fluorescent dyes were imaged sequentially in frame-interface mode to eliminate spectral overlapping between the channels (12Shih M. Lin F. Scott J.D. Wang H.Y. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1588-1595Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).Radioligand Binding AssayThe number of β2-adrenergic receptors was determined by radioligand binding. Approximately 106 stably transfected CHO cells were incubated with 30 pm[125I]iodocyanopindolol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the absence or presence of 10 μmpropranolol (for defining the amount of nonspecific binding) at 23 °C for 90 min. The incubation buffer contained 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, and 150 mm NaCl (16Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 8692-8699Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were collected on GF/C binder-free glass giber filter membranes at reduced pressure and washed rapidly. The radioligand bound to the washed cell mass retained by the filter was quantified by use of a γ-counter. Nonspecific binding was less than 5% of radioligand binding. Each experimental point was performed in triplicate.Cyclic AMP AssayOne day prior to the analysis, A431 cells and CHO clones stably transfected with β2-adrenergic receptor and β2-adrenergic receptor-GFP-pcDNA3 were seeded in 96-well plates at the density of 20,000 cells/well. Cells were washed and challenged with or without 10 μm isoproterenol in 50 μl of HEM buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 135 mmNaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm MgSO4, 2.5 mm NaHCO3, containing Ro-20–1724 (0.1 mm; Calbiochem)) and adenosine deaminase (0.5 unit/ml) for the times indicated in the figure legends. The first challenge with agonist was for 0–60 min. For some studies, the cells first challenged with agonist were washed free of agonist (three times) at the end of the first incubation and then challenged again for 5 min with agonist. The incubations were stopped by addition of 100 μl of ice-cold ethanol. The agonist-stimulated cyclic AMP production was determined as described elsewhere (15Shih M. Malbon C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12193-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar).RESULTSThe nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Src has been shown to play a prominent role in linking G-protein-linked receptors to Ras and downstream signaling to the mitogen-activated protein kinase network (2Ahn S. Maudsley S. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1185-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 3Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S. Daaka Y.

For the β2-adrenergic receptor, Src has been shown to act as a switch from receptor regulation of Gs and adenylylcyclase to activation of Ras following the normal progression of receptor activation, desensitization, and sequestration. The role of Src in desensitization is far less clear. Src has been proposed to target to GPLRs via its interaction with β-arrestin, suggesting in a temporal sense that Src would be functioning in post-receptor desensitization. To test the hypothesis that Src may be participating in events prior to receptor sequestration and Ras activation, we focused on an analysis of β2-adrenergic receptor-mediated activation and desensitization, using the accumulation of intracellular cyclic AMP as the readout.Human epidermoid A431 carcinoma cells are a widely used model of β2-adrenergic receptor action (18Kashles O. Levitzki A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1987; 36: 1531-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar, 19Wang H.Y. Berrios M. Hadcock J.R. Malbon C.C. Int. J. Biochem. 1991; 23: 7-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Challenging A431 cells with the β2-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol (10 μm) leads to peak accumulation of cyclic AMP at 5 min, which declines to approximately half-maximal levels within 30–60 min, reflecting ongoing agonist-induced desensitization (Fig. 1). The cyclic AMP response of A431 cells to agonist, following a 30 or 60 min first challenge with isoproterenol, a washout of agonist, and a second challenge with isoproterenol for 5 min, is rectified to the level of naı̈ve cells that have been challenged with agonist for 5 min. To explore what role, if any, Src may have in agonist-induced desensitization of β2-adrenergic receptors, we performed the same experiments in A431 cells pretreated for 30 min with the Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2 (Fig. 1). In the presence of the Src inhibitor, agonist-induced desensitization was abolished, and intracellular cyclic AMP levels continued to increase over the period of 60 min of challenge with agonist. These data suggest that Src activity is important not only for subsequent downstream signaling to Ras but also for agonist-induced desensitization itself. To test the observations by an independent approach that targets Src only, A431 cells were treated for 4 days with ODNs antisense to Src to suppress Src levels. Treatment with ODNs antisense to Src also abolished agonist-induced desensitization (Fig. 1). Suppression of Src levels by antisense ODNs yields increased cyclic AMP accumulation in A431 cells challenged with isoproterenol for up to 60 min. Treatment of cells with ODNs sense or missense to Src, in contrast, was without effect (data not shown).To further test this newly discovered role for Src in agonist-induced desensitization of β2-adrenergic receptors, we tested the effects of stable transfection of A431 cells with an expression vector harboring either the constitutively active form (Y527F) or the dominant-negative form (K295R/Y527F) of c-Src (Fig. 2). Stable expression of the dominant-inhibitory form of Src abolishes agonist-induced desensitization of β2-adrenergic receptor with respect to cyclic AMP accumulation. The accumulation of intracellular cyclic AMP increased throughout the time course of β-adrenergic stimulation, for up to 60 min, in the clones expressing the dominant-negative form of Src. This observation confirms the results obtained with cells treated with the Src family inhibitor PP2 and with ODNs antisense to suppress Src levels (Fig. 1). Thus, inhibition of Src activity, suppression of Src expression, and expression of a dominant-inhibitory form of Src all lead to a loss of agonist-induced desensitization of β2-adrenergic receptor-mediated activation of adenylylcyclase. The cyclic AMP responses to isoproterenol in the cells with Src suppression or inhibition are the greatest cyclic AMP responses that we have observed with these cells to date. Expression of the constitutively active form (Y527F) of Src, in contrast, had no demonstrable effect on agonist-induced desensitization (Fig. 2). Although we expected that the expression of the constitutively active Src would further amplify the desensitization response, no such alteration was noted. This observation suggests that endogenous Src may be fully activated with respect to desensitization only when the β2-adrenergic receptors first have been activated. Under these circumstances, the introduction of constitutively active Src without proper targeting to β2-adrenergic receptor, as in the basal state, may have little effect on desensitization.Figure 2Expression of a dominant-negative, but not the constitutively active, mutant form of Src abolishes agonist-induced desensitization of the cyclic AMP response to stimulation by a β-adrenergic agonist. A431 cells (control) and clones stably transfected to express either the Y527F constitutively active mutant of Src (CA-Src (Y527F)) or the dominant-negative mutant of Src (DN-Src (K295R/Y527F)) were used to study cyclic AMP accumulation in response to isoproterenol over time. The cells were challenged with 10 μm isoproterenol (ISO) for 0, 5, 30, or 60 min, and intracellular cyclic AMP accumulation was determined. Some cells were first treated with isoproterenol for 30 or 60 min and then washed free of agonist and rechallenged with isoproterenol for 5 min. Assays of cyclic AMP accumulation were performed in triplicate. The data shown are mean values ± S.E. from three to five separate experiments performed on separate occasions.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)We tested the hypothesis that agonist treatment of A431 cells activated endogenous Src activity in A431 cells (Fig.3). Cells were challenged with isoproterenol (10 μm) for periods up to 60 min. At the conclusion of the activation, whole-cell extracts were prepared, and the extracts were subjected to an immune precipitation “pull down” assay using antibodies against the β2-adrenergic receptor (antibody CM04). The immune precipitations were subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, and the resultant immunoblots were stained with antibodies to c-Src. Some Src was found in association with the β2-adrenergic receptor under basal, unstimulated cell culture conditions, probably reflecting the observation that growth factors such as insulin catalyze the phosphorylation of the β2-adrenergic receptor on residue Tyr-350, which then constitutes a canonical SH2-binding site (20Baltensperger K.

In response to challenge with isoproterenol, the level of Src association increased by more than 3.0-fold within 30 min and was maintained until at least 60 min. To determine whether the Src associated with the β2-adrenergic receptor was activated, we performed immunoblotting of the Src associated with the β2-adrenergic receptor using an antibody that detects only Src phosphorylated at the Tyr-416 position (anti-phospho-Src (Tyr-416)). The results of the blotting for activated Src revealed that the Src associated with the β2-adrenergic receptor following the challenge with isoproterenol was phosphorylated at Tyr-416 and therefore activated. Thus, not only were Src expression and activity necessary for agonist-induced desensitization of β2-adrenergic receptors, but association and activation by this G-protein-linked receptor were also increased sharply in response to agonist.Figure 3Stimulation of cells with isoproterenol provokes recruitment of Src to the β-adrenergic receptor and tyrosine phosphorylation (activation) of Src. A431 cells were challenged with 10 μm isoproterenol (ISO) for 0, 5, 30, or 60 min and then used to harvest whole-cell extracts. The extracts were subjected to immune precipitation (IP) pull down assays with antibodies against the β-adrenergic receptor (CM04),and the immune complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE. The resultant immunoblots (IB) were stained with antibodies specific for the phospho-Tyr-417 activated version of Src, an antibody against Src itself, or a second antibody against the β-adrenergic receptor (CM02) to establish equivalent loading of each lane.

The simplest hypothesis to explain the agonist-induced increase in Src association and activation was that the β2-adrenergic receptor might display increased phosphorylation of Tyr-350, a conditional canonical SH2-binding site. To test this possibility, we challenged A431 cells with isoproterenol (10 μm) for periods up to 60 min and performed immune precipitation pull-downs of β2-adrenergic receptors from the whole-cell extracts (Fig. 4). The immune precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the resultant immunoblots were stained with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY99). These data show conclusively and unexpectedly that the phosphotyrosine content of the β2-adrenergic receptor increased upon challenge of the cells with isoproterenol. Within 5 min of challenge with isoproterenol, the content of phosphotyrosine more than doubled, increasing to 2.5- and then 3.0-fold by 30 and 60 min, respectively. We confirmed these data using metabolic labeling of an independent hamster smooth muscle cell line (DDT1-MF2 vas deferens) with [32P]Pi overnight and stimulation with 10 μm isoproterenol for 5 or 15 min (data not shown).Figure 4Stimulation of cells with β-adrenergic agonist leads to increased phosphotyrosine content of the β2-adrenergic receptor. A431 cells were challenged with isoproterenol (ISO) (10 μm) for 0, 5, 30, and 60 min and then used to prepare whole-cell extracts. The cell extracts were subjected to immune precipitation (IP) pull-down assays with antibody (CM04) against the β2-adrenergic receptor, separation of the immune precipitate on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting. The immunoblots (IB) were stained with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY99) as well as with another antibody (CM02) against the β2-adrenergic receptor to establish equivalent loading for each lane. Shown is a blot representative of three such experiments with essentially identical results. β2AR, β2-adrenergic receptor.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Earlier studies demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro that phosphorylation of the β2-adrenergic receptor at Tyr-350 generates an SH2-binding site that Grb2, 1-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, or dynamin can bind via SH2 domains (23Karoor V.

Signal. 1998; 10: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We tested whether Tyr-to-Phe substitution of the Tyr-350 residue of the β2-adrenergic receptor would alter association of the receptor with Src (Fig. 5). These studies were performed in CHO-K cells that express very low levels of endogenous β2-adrenergic receptors. Stably transfected CHO clones were created that express either the wild-type β2-adrenergic receptor or the Y350F mutant form of the receptor. Clones were selected that express comparable levels of expression of β2-adrenergic receptors, 0.25 pmol of receptor/mg of membrane protein, as measured using the high affinity, radiolabeled β2-adrenergic antagonist ligand iodocyanopindolol. CHO clones were challenged with isoproterenol (10 μm) for periods up to 60 min and then harvested for whole-cell extracts. The extracts were subjected to immune precipitation pull-down assays with antibodies to the β2-adrenergic receptor (CM04). The immune precipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the resultant blots were stained with antibodies against Src as well as with a second antibody (CM02) to ensure equivalent loading of samples. As noted above with pull-down assays from whole-cell extracts prepared from A431 cells (Fig. 3), the amount of Src associated with the wild-type β2-adrenergic receptor increased in response to challenge of the cells with isoproterenol (Fig. 5). In sharp contrast to the situation observed for pull-down assays in cells expressing the wild-type receptor, the pull-down assays performed with whole-cell extracts of CHO clones expressing the Y350F mutant form of the β2-adrenergic receptor do not reveal an increase in Src association in response to agonist challenge. In fact, contrary to the increase shown in Src-β2-adrenergic receptor association for the wild-type receptor, Src association with the Y350F mutant form of β2-adrenergic receptor actually declines in response to challenge with isoproterenol. Thus, the likely basis for the increase in Src-β2-adrenergic receptor association and Src activation in response to agonist challenge is Src association with the phosphorylated Tyr-350 residue of the receptor that creates an SH2-binding site.Figure 5The Y350F mutation of the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2AR) abolishes recruitment of Src to a receptor-Src complex in response to stimulation by β-adrenergic agonist. CHO clones expressing either wild-type (WT) β2-adrenergic receptors or the Y350F mutant form of the β2-adrenergic receptor were challenged with isoproterenol (ISO) (10 μm) for 0, 5, 30, and 60 min and then used to prepare whole-cell extracts. The clones expressed equivalent levels of β2-adrenergic receptors, as measured by radioligand binding studies with iodocyanopindolol. The cell extracts were subjected to immune precipitation (IP) pull-down assays with antibody (CM04) against the β2-adrenergic receptor, separation of the immune precipitate on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting. The immunoblots (IB) were stained with anti-Src antibody as well as with another antibody (CM02) against the β2-adrenergic receptor to establish equivalent loading for each lane.

A key component of the cells' response to volume changes is the activation of a channel, which elicits characteristic chloride currents (ICl, Swell). The molecular identity of this channel has been controversial. Most recently, ClC-3, a protein highly homologous to the ClC-4 and ClC-5 channel proteins, has been proposed as being responsible for ICl, Swell (1Duan D. Winter C. Cowley S. Hume J.R. Horowitz B. Nature. 1997; 390: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Subsequently, however, other reports have suggested that ClC-3 may generate chloride currents with characteristics clearly distinct from ICl, Swell. Significantly different tissue distributions for ClC-3 have also been reported, and it has been suggested that two isoforms of ClC-3 may be expressed with differing functions. In this study we generated a series of cell lines expressing variants of ClC-3 to rigorously address the question of whether or not ClC-3 is responsible for ICl, Swell. The data demonstrate that ClC-3 is not responsible for ICl, Swell and has no role in regulatory volume decrease, furthermore, ClC-3 is not activated by intracellular calcium and fails to elicit chloride currents under any conditions tested. Expression of ClC-3 was shown to be relatively tissue-specific, with high levels in the central nervous system and kidney, and in contrast to previous reports, is essentially absent from heart. This distribution is also inconsistent with the previous proposed role in cell volume regulation. Volume regulation is essential for normal cell function.

Following cell swelling upon exposure to hypotonic solution, animal cells restore their volume toward its original value by activation of channels and transporters in the plasma membrane: the loss of K+ and Cl− ions and organic osmolytes, followed by obligatory loss of water, leads to regulatory volume decrease (RVD)1 (2Lang F. Busch G.L. Ritter M. Volkl H. Waldegger S. Gulbins E. Haussinger D. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 247-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1592) Google Scholar). Although a cell swelling-activated chloride current (ICl, Swell) required for RVD has been carefully characterized in several cell types, the molecular identity of the channel has not yet been established (3Okada Y. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C755-C789Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Strange K. Emma F. Jackson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C711-C730Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Valverde M.A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). This is primarily due to three experimental limitations. First, the current is ubiquitous, such that cell lines exhibiting little or no current necessary for expression cloning are not available. Second, no specific, high affinity blockers of the current are known. Third, the magnitude and the rate of activation of the currents are readily perturbed by both endogenous and exogenous factors making quantitative analysis difficult. The latter issue is illustrated by the fact that P-glycoprotein, proposed as a candidate for the cell swelling-activated chloride channel, was subsequently shown to be a regulator of endogenous channel activity (6Valverde M.A. Bond T.D. Hardy S.P. Taylor J.C. Higgins C.F. Altamirano J. Alvarez-Leefmans F.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4460-4468Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 7Bond T.D. Valverde M.A. Higgins C.F. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 508: 333-340Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar), whereas another candidate, pICln, was also shown not to be the channel and its precise role is still uncertain (8Furst J. Bazzini C. Jakab M. Meyer G. Konig M. Gschwentner M. Ritter M. Schmarda A. Botta G. Benz R. Deetjen P. Paulmichl M. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 440: 100-115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Li C. Breton S. Morrison R. Cannon C.L. Emma F. Sanchez-Olea R. Bear C. Strange K. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 112: 727-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Another swelling-activated chloride channel expressed in many cell types, ClC-2, has also been suggested as contributing to RVD (10Xiong H. Li C. Garami E. Wang Y. Ramjeesingh M. Galley K. Bear C.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 167: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). However ClC-2 generates a current with biophysical and pharmacological characteristics that differ significantly from ICl, Swell (11Grunder S. Thiemann A. Pusch M. Jentsch T.J. Nature. 1992; 360: 759-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 12Jordt S.E. Jentsch T.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1582-1592Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 13Bond T.D. Ambikapathy S. Mohammad S. Valverde M.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 511: 45-54Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and in a human intestinal epithelial cell line it has been shown that ClC-2 does not contribute to RVD (13Bond T.D. Ambikapathy S. Mohammad S. Valverde M.A. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 511: 45-54Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Recently, a series of studies has led to the suggestion that ClC-3 is the swelling-activated chloride channel responsible for ICl, Swell. The gene coding for ClC-3 was first cloned from rat by a homology-based cloning strategy; its predicted amino acid sequence is similar to other ClC channels (14Kawasaki M. Uchida S. Monkawa T. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Neuron. 1994; 12: 597-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 15Kawasaki M. Suzuki M. Uchida S. Sasaki S. Marumo F. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1285-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The human cDNA was subsequently cloned and sequenced from fetal brain (16Borsani G. Rugarli E.I. Taglialatela M. Wong C. Ballabio A. Genomics. 1995; 27: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and the guinea pig version was cloned and sequenced from cardiac myocytes (1Duan D. Winter C. Cowley S. Hume J.R. Horowitz B. Nature. 1997; 390: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Expression of gpClC-3 was reported to increase significantly ICl, Swell (1Duan D. Winter C. Cowley S. Hume J.R. Horowitz B. Nature. 1997; 390: 417-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 17Duan D. Cowley S. Horowitz B. Hume J.R. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 113: 57-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This view was supported by antisense experiments where reduction of ClC-3 expression was reported to decrease ICl, Swell (18Wang L. Chen L. Jacob T.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 63-75Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Subsequently, the role of ClC-3 in ICl, Swell has been challenged. Attempts to replicate experiments with gpClC-3 and hClC-3, either in Xenopus oocytes or in mammalian cell lines (HEK293 and NIH3T3), were unsuccessful (19Friedrich T. Breiderhoff T. Jentsch T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 896-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In another study, expression of rClC-3 in CHO cells was reported to generate a Ca2+-sensitive chloride channel (15Kawasaki M. Suzuki M. Uchida S. Sasaki S. Marumo F. Neuron. 1995; 14: 1285-1291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Further complexity was introduced by the suggestion that short and long versions of ClC-3 could potentially be generated in vivo using two different translation initiation sites, identical except for an additional 58 amino acids at the N-terminal of the long version (20Shimada K. Li X. Xu G. Nowak D.E. Showalter L.A. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G268-G276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was reported that expression of the short and long versions generated, in Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cells, distinct currents that are ClC-5-like and ICl, Swell-like, respectively (20Shimada K. Li X. Xu G. Nowak D.E. Showalter L.A. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G268-G276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although the ion selectivity of the ClC-5-like currents is reported both as I− > Cl− and Cl− > I− (21Li X. Shimada K. Showalter L.A. Weinman S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35994-35998Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The tissue distribution of ClC-3 is also ambiguous. Kawasaki et al. (14Kawasaki M. Uchida S. Monkawa T. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Neuron. 1994; 12: 597-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) reported mRNA coding for ClC-3 mainly in brain and kidney, but not in heart. In contrast, Shimada et al. (20Shimada K. Li X. Xu G. Nowak D.E. Showalter L.A. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G268-G276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported high levels of expression of ClC-3 protein in the liver, and Britton et al. (22Britton F.C. Hatton W.J. Rossow C.F. Duan D. Hume J.R. Horowitz B. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: H2225-H2233Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) high levels in heart. Furthermore, ClC-3 was reported in bovine non-pigmented ciliary cells to be localized mainly to the nucleus (18Wang L. Chen L. Jacob T.J. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 63-75Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar), yet to the canalicular membrane in hepatocytes (20Shimada K. Li X. Xu G. Nowak D.E. Showalter L.A. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G268-G276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To resolve the controversy surrounding ClC-3 we generated cell lines expressing the long and short versions of hClC-3-GFP, with hClC-5-GFP as control, in HEK293 cells. Neither the long nor the short version of hClC-3-GFP affected the swelling-activated currents significantly or influenced cell volume regulation. Indeed, ClC-3 generated no detectable chloride currents when overexpressed in response to change in cellular Ca2+ concentrations. The findings presented here exclude ClC-3 as the channel responsible for ICl, Swell and cell volume regulation. The original cDNA sequence coding for ClC-3 predicted a protein of 760 amino acids (the short version) (14Kawasaki M. Uchida S. Monkawa T. Miyawaki A. Mikoshiba K. Marumo F. Sasaki S. Neuron. 1994; 12: 597-604Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Subsequently, an upstream ATG codon was identified, and a protein with an additional 58 amino acids at the N terminus was predicted (the long version) (20Shimada K. Li X. Xu G. Nowak D.E. Showalter L.A. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G268-G276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that both versions may be expressed (20Shimada K. Li X. Xu G. Nowak D.E. Showalter L.A. Weinman S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G268-G276Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To study the localization of hClC-3, we generated cell lines expressing both the short and long versions fused to GFP at the C terminus. It has previously been reported that GFP tags at the C terminus of ClC channels do not impair function (23Park K. Arreola J. Begenisich T. Melvin J.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 163: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As a control for function, a cell line expressing hClC-3 with no GFP tag was also generated. Plasmids containing overlapping cDNA fragments encoding hClC-3 were obtained from Dr. Borsani (16Borsani G. Rugarli E.I. Taglialatela M. Wong C. Ballabio A. Genomics. 1995; 27: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Appropriate restriction fragments were excised from these plasmids, or generated from these plasmids by PCR, and ligated together to generate a full-lengthCLCN3 cDNA. The PCR primer at the 5′-end (5′-AGTTGGAACGCTAGCCACCATGACAAATGGAGGCAGC-3′) was designed to introduce a consensus Kozak sequence and a unique NheI restriction site upstream of the start codon. The full-length cDNA was inserted as a NheI-XhoI fragment into the expression vector pCIneo (Promega) to generate the expression plasmid pCI-ClC-3. The cDNA was verified by sequencing. To generate the long version, the missing coding sequence was cloned from human primary lung fibroblasts by a reverse transcriptase reaction (Omniscript, Qiagen) using random hexamer primers (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), followed by PCR using primers specific for ClC-3: the upstream promoter was 5′-CGAGATAATGCTAGCCCACCATGGAGTCTGAGCAGCTGTTCCAT-3′ and at the downstream promoter 5′-AGAACTGTTAATGGATCCTCCATTTGTCAT-3′. The PCR fragment was ligated as an NheI-BamHI fragment into pCI-ClC-3, which had been modified by a PCR-based insertion of a silent BamHI restriction site downstream of the short version start codon. The resultant plasmid was designated pCI-ClC-3long. To generate the mutant K579N, the Altered Sites mutagenesis system (Promega) with an oligonucleotide containing the desired mutation together with a silent AflII restriction site (5′-GAAGCACACATCCGACTTAAGGGATACCCTTTCTTG-3′) was used. Plasmids encoding hClC-3-GFP fusion proteins were generated by a two-step cloning procedure. First, the stop codon was substituted with an XhoI site by PCR using primer 5′-CCTCATCTGTGACTCGAGGTTGAACATTATTG-3′. The EGFP-fragment from the pIRES2-EGFP plasmid (CLONTECH) was then inserted as a NcoI-NotI fragment into plasmid pCI-ClC-3 after digestion with XhoI and NotI, using two short linker oligonucleotides to mediate ligation between theXhoI and the NcoI ends (TCGAGTCTAGAGCCAC and CATGGTGGCTCTAGAC). The plasmid encoding hClC-5-GFP was a generous gift of Prof. T. Jentsch, Hamburg, and was based on the same pCIneo vector and EGFP gene as the hClC-3 fusions generated here. HEK293 (human embryonic kidney-transformed cells (24Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3511) Google Scholar)) cell lines, expressing the various hClC-3, hClC-3-GFP, and hClC-5-GFP proteins, were generated by electroporating with linearized plasmids. To generate a cell line expressing short hClC-3 without a GFP tag, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with pGreenLantern-1, which encodes GFP (Life Technologies, Inc.), and the pCI-ClC-3-expressing hClC-3 at a ratio of 1:3. Clones were selected for resistance to 800 μg/ml G418 and by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. The “greenest” clones were then manually selected and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 500 μg/ml G418. After subsequent screening for GFP fluorescence and G418 resistance, clones were tested for hClC-3 expression by immunoblotting. A polyclonal antibody against ClC-3, called D1, was produced by injecting a synthetic peptide MTNGGSINSSTHLLD (corresponding to amino acids 59–73 of the long version of hClC-3; amino acids 1–15 of the short version) coupled to bovine serum albumin, together with Freund's adjuvant, into rabbits at four time points over a 5-month period (Regal Group Ltd., UK). This peptide was selected because it is specific for ClC-3, and we showed that the antibody D1 does not cross-react with overexpressed ClC-4 or ClC-5 in Western blots (data not shown). Sera from bled animals were affinity-purified using N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) coated with the immunogenic peptide. The eluates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining. The IgG-containing fractions were then dialyzed and concentrated using spin columns (Millipore) with a cut-off size of 70 kDa. The commercial antibody against ClC-3, Anti-ClC-3, was obtained from Alomone and was raised against residues 592 to 661 of short ClC-3. The antibody against GFP, JL-8, was a monoclonal antibody fromCLONTECH. Cells, grown at low density on glass coverslips coated with poly-l-lysine, were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with calcium and magnesium: 8.0 g/liter NaCl, 1.15 g/liter Na2HPO4, 0.2 g/liter KCl, 0.2 g/liter KH2PO4, 0.13 g/liter CaCl2-2H2O, 0.1 g/liter MgCl2·6H2O) for 30 min at room temperature. Cell nuclei were stained with propidium iodide after treatment with RNase A (Sigma) (100 μg/ml) for 3 min at 37 °C. The coverslips were then mounted onto glass slides with mounting oil containing anti-fading agent (Vectashield, Vector). Images were taken by a MicroRadiance Bio-Rad confocal microscopy through a 63× planapochromat 1.4 numerical aperture objective. The GFP signal was detected by excitation with the 488-nm line of an argon laser through a HQ515/30 emission filter. The signal from propidium iodide in the same cell section was detected by excitation using the 543-nm line of a helium-neon laser through an E600LP emission filter. Cells grown on poly-l-lysine-coated 75-cm2 flasks or 35-mm dishes to 80% confluency were incubated in 5 ml of reducing buffer (50 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA in PBS) for 5 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed twice with 5 ml of 1 mm EDTA in PBS. Cells were labeled by incubation for 30 min at room temperature with 1 ml of biotin maleimide (Molecular Probes) dissolved in DMSO and diluted to 1 mm in EDTA buffer. The reaction was quenched by washing twice with 2 ml of 5 mmdithiothreitol in PBS and twice with PBS plus 1 mm EDTA. The labeled cells were lysed by addition of 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 plus complete mini protease inhibitors (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 1 mg of protein was incubated with 100 μl of prewashed immobilized Ultralink neutravidin (Pierce) and gently rotated overnight at 4 °C. The slurry was recovered by centrifugation, washed twice (by resuspension and centrifugation) with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer, twice with 0.5 ml of high salt buffer (0.5 m NaCl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40 in dH2O), and once with 0.5 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The bound, biotinylated proteins were eluted by incubating the washed slurry with 100 μl of Laemmli sample buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue) for 10 min at 90 °C and analyzed by Western blotting. Cell extracts for Western blotting were prepared by detaching cells with PBS containing 5 mm EDTA followed by lysis buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 and complete mini protease inhibitors; Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The lysate was sonicated to shear the DNA. Proteins from tissues were obtained from whole organs removed from laboratory mice (C57/Bl6) immediately after killing and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen organs were stored at −80 °C until further processing. To homogenize, the frozen organs were first pulverized with pestle and mortar in liquid nitrogen, and then resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer with protease inhibitors (described above) and treated for 30 s using an Ultra-Turrax homogenizer. Where necessary, proteins were deglycosylated by resuspending the cell lysate in a 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and with 5 units/μl PNGase F (New England BioLabs) at 37 °C for 1 h with occasional gentle mixing. To digest DNA, Benzonase (Sigma Chemical Co.) was added to a final concentration of 5 units/μl and incubated at 37 °C for 5 min prior to addition of Laemmli sample buffer. For electrophoresis, samples were mixed with equal amounts of Laemmli sample buffer and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 7.5% polyacrylamide gels at 15–40 V/cm for ∼1.5 h in a Bio-Rad chamber. The separated proteins were then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (0.45-μm pore size, Immobilon-P, Millipore) using a semi-dry blotting apparatus (Anachem) as described by the manufacturer. After blocking with PBS containing 4% dried skimmed milk and 0.02% Tween 20 for at least 30 min, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with diluted antiserum (1/1000, JL-8 CLONTECH; 1/200 Anti-CLC-3, Alomone and 1/100 D1) in the blocking buffer. Membranes were washed three times for 15 min with PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20, incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-mouse or anti-rabbit-IgG, as appropriate; Dako) for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times for 15 min each, and finally the horseradish peroxidase signal detected using the ECL chemiluminescence system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Chloride currents were measured in whole cell recording mode of the patch-clamp technique as described previously (7Bond T.D. Valverde M.A. Higgins C.F. J. Physiol.

To prevent voltage offset when bath Cl−concentration was changed, the bath reference electrode was connected through an agar bridge that maintains a constant Cl−concentration in the immediate vicinity of the Ag/AgCl electrode. The extracellular (bathing) isotonic solution contained 100 mmNMDGCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1.3 mmCaCl2, 10 mm HEPES titrated to pH 7.4 with Tris. The osmolarity was corrected to 300 mOsm with mannitol. The extracellular hypotonic solution, used to elicit swelling-activated currents, had the same composition as the isotonic solution except that the osmolarity was corrected with mannitol to 220 mOsm. Extracellular solutions with chloride substitution were obtained by replacing 100 mm NMDGCl with 100 mm of the respective anion salts (NaI, NaF, or NaBr), and osmolarity was adjusted with mannitol to 220 or 300 mOsm for hypotonic or isotonic solutions, respectively. The intracellular (pipette) solution was 100 mm NMDGCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm ATP titrated to pH 7.4 with Tris, and osmolarity was adjusted to 280 mOsm with mannitol. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. (n, number of cells). Statistical analyses were performed by non-paired t test; statistical significance was accepted for p < 0.05(*) or p < 0.01(* **Supported by the TMR Marie Curie Research Training Grant.*). Cells were grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and loaded, before the experiment, for 5 min with 2.5 μm Calcein-AM (Molecular Probes) in isotonic solution (70 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmCaCl2, 5.5 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.4, and osmolarity was adjusted to 320 mOsm with mannitol). After extensive washing with isotonic solution not containing calcein-AM, cells were transferred to a perfusion chamber set on the stage of the microscope. Experiments were performed at room temperature. Cells were imaged by a MicroRadiance Bio-Rad confocal microscopy through a Plan-Neofluor 40 × 1.3 numerical aperture oil immersion objective (Zeiss), and the dye was excited with a 488-nm line of an argon ion laser. The emitted fluorescence was collected through a QH500LP filter. An optical section passing through the cells was acquired every 30 s, and the average fluorescence signal from a representative cellular area was plotted along the time. To calibrate the fluorescence signal, brief exposures to 15% hypotonic and 15% hypertonic solutions, obtained by adjusting the amount of mannitol, were used (25Alvarez-Leefmans F.J. Altamirano J. Crowe W.E. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 27: 361-391Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The cells were then perfused, for at least 5 min, with an isotonic solution containing 10 μg/ml Gramicidin (Sigma) and where NaCl was substituted with 70 mm NMDGCl and then challenged with a 40% hypotonic solution, obtained by reduction of mannitol concentration. The signal was then analyzed and converted in volume measurement and the percentage of RVD was calculated (6Valverde M.A. Bond T.D. Hardy S.P. Taylor J.C. Higgins C.F. Altamirano J.

Methods Neurosci. 1995; 27: 361-391Crossref Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The fluorescence signal due to the GFP tag, present in the cells expressing ClC-3-GFP, was negligible in comparison to the signal due to calcein and was shown to be non-osmotically sensitive, so it could readily be accounted for in the calibration of the signal. To facilitate study of ClC-3 and its subcellular location, stable cell lines expressing short hClC-3-GFP and long hClC-3-GFP, and short hClC-3(N579K)-GFP and long ClC-3(N579K)-GFP, were generated in HEK293 cells (see “Experimental Procedures”). It has previously been shown for other ClC channels that a C-terminal GFP tag does not affect function (23Park K. Arreola J. Begenisich T. Melvin J.E. J. Membr. Biol. 1998; 163: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). As controls, cell lines expressing hClC-5-GFP (which is known to localize to the plasma membrane and to endosomal compartments (26Gunther W. Luchow A. Cluzeaud F. Vandewalle A. Jentsch T.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8075-8080Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 27Devuyst O. Christie P.T. Courtoy P.J. Beauwens R. Thakker R.V. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 247-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar)), and short hClC-3 without a GFP tag, were also generated. Fig. 1 shows Western blots, probed with anti-GFP antibody (panel a) or antibodies against ClC-3 (panels b and c), demonstrating expression of the appropriate proteins in these cell lines. Note that the fusion proteins remain intact with the GFP tag at the C terminus. To localize the ClC-3-GFP fusion proteins, the cell lines were studied by confocal microscopy. Fig.2 (top row of panels) shows three optical sections taken along the z axis of a typical cell expressing short hClC-3-GFP. The signal in greencorresponds to the ClC-3-GFP fusion protein, and the redsignal corresponds to the cell nucleus (DNA stained with propidium iodide). The majority of the hClC-3 protein was localized to an organelle in proximity to the nucleus, presumably the Golgi, and to a variety of differently sized intracellular vesicles scattered throughout the cytoplasm. However, a proportion of the protein was located in a rim around the periphery of the cell, presumably the plasma membrane. A very similar pattern of localization was also observed for short hClC-3 bearing the mutation N579K (middle row of panels) and for hClC-5-GFP (lower row of panels). The cells shown were representative of the large majority of the cells within a single clone and of several independent clones expressing each GFP fusion protein (data not shown). The data above suggest that a proportion of the ClC-3-GFP fusion protein is localized to the plasma membrane. However, because of the limited horizontal resolution of confocal microscopy, the data do not exclude the possibility that the protein is located in vesicles just beneath the plasma membrane. To demonstrate that the ClC-3-GFP fusion proteins are inserted in the plasma membrane, cells were labeled with the membrane-impermeant, thiol-reactive reagent biotin-maleimide (28Blott E.J. Higgins C.F. Linton K.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6800-6808Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The biotinylated proteins were then isolated using immobilized neutravidin, and any GFP fusion proteins in the biotinylated protein fraction were detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-GFP antibodies. In the absence of biotinylation, no proteins were bound by the resin, showing that the labeling is specific (data not shown). A significant proportion of each of the GFP fusion proteins tested was accessible to biotin maleimide in intact cells, consistent with a plasma membrane location (Fig. 3, top panel a). Under these conditions, an intracellular control antigen known to be located just beneath the plasma membrane, the Ras pathway protein SHC (29Nguyen D.H. Webb D.J. Catling A.D. Song Q. Dhakephalkar A. Weber M.J. Ravichandran K.S. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19382-19388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) was not labeled, demonstrating that the biotin maleimide does not permeate the membrane (Fig. 3, bottom panel a). When cell membranes were permeabilized with saponin (Fig.3 b), there was, as expected, a significant increase in labeling of ClC-3-GFP proteins (top panel b), and SHC was now also labeled (bottom panel b). Similar results were obtained also with the clone expressing the native ClC-3 protein (data not shown). Thus, in the HEK cell lines a significant proportion of both the hClC-3 and hClC-5-GFP fusion proteins is located in the plasma membrane. Having established that the hClC-3GFP fusion proteins were present in the plasma membrane, cell swelling-activated chloride currents were studi"

RRases are grouped into three major classes (class I, II, and III) based on the mechanisms they use for radical generation and on their structural differences. Class I is subdivided further into two subclasses (Ia and Ib) based mainly on allosteric regulation but also on involvement of auxiliary proteins (recently reviewed in Ref. 1Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli has the coding potential for three different RRases. The NrdAB (class Ia) is active during aerobiosis, NrdDG (class III) is strictly anaerobic, and NrdEF (class Ib) is thought to be a cryptic enzyme with no obvious function (1Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Class I enzymes receive the electrons required for the reduction of ribose from small proteins, thioredoxins (Trxs) and glutaredoxins (Grxs), with two redox-active cysteine thiols, which by dithiol-disulfide interchange reduce an acceptor disulfide in the active center of RRase. Trxs and Grxs are kept in a reduced form by NADPH, which reduces the redoxin either via the flavoprotein thioredoxin reductase or via the flavoprotein glutathione reductase and the ubiquitous tripeptide GSH (2Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13963-13966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Escherichia colicontains two thioredoxins (Trx1 and Trx2), three glutaredoxins (Grx1, Grx2, and Grx3), and a novel redoxin (called NrdH) with thioredoxin-like activity but glutaredoxin-like amino acid sequence (2Holmgren A.

NrdH is a more specific hydrogen donor for the NrdEF than for the NrdAB enzyme, whereas the opposite is the case for Grx1 (5Jordan A. Åslund F. Pontis E. Reichard P. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18044-18050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Trx1 and Trx2 are hydrogen donors for NrdAB but not for NrdEF (3Miranda-Vizuete A. Damdimopoulos A.E.

The nrdA and nrdB genes that code for the NrdAB class Ia reductase constitute a tightly regulated transcription unit that does not include the gene for either Trx or Grx. Expression ofnrdAB genes is cell cycle-regulated and increases when DNA synthesis is inhibited (1Jordan A. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 71-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Regulation of nrdAB expression in E. coli has been shown to be very complex; multiplecis-acting positive regulatory sites identified upstream of the nrdAB promoter appear to control, independently but in concert, the cell cycle-dependent transcription and the response to inhibition of DNA synthesis (9Jacobson B.A. Fuchs J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 1315-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Recent data from our group add further complexity to the nrdAB regulation, demonstrating a tight and inverse relation between expression ofnrdAB and that of genes coding for components of both glutaredoxin and thioredoxin pathways (10Prieto-Álamo M.J. Jurado J. Gallardo-Madueño R. Monje-Casas F. Holmgren A. Pueyo C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13398-13405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we have observed that induction ratios of nrdAB transcription by hydroxyurea (RRase inhibitor) are similar to the increments innrdAB basal expression of mutants lacking both Trx1 and Grx1. Therefore, we have postulated that operation of the NrdAB enzyme in the absence of its two main reductants must lead to disturbances in deoxyribonucleotide production sensed as those caused by hydroxyurea. The nrdE and nrdF genes that code for the NrdEF class Ib reductase form a conserved operon where the promoter is followed by four genes (11Jordan A. Aragall E. Gibert I. Barbé J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 777-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Genes nrdH, coding for the NrdH-redoxin, and nrdI, coding for a protein with a stimulatory effect on ribonucleotide reduction, are present upstream ofnrdEF (5Jordan A. Åslund F. Pontis E. Reichard P. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18044-18050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). It has been reported that the E. colitranscription unit is not expressed in sufficient amounts to support growth under normal laboratory conditions. Neither inhibitors of DNA replication nor DNA damages induce its expression. Thus far, only hydroxyurea has been shown to stimulate the expression ofnrdEF genes (11Jordan A. Aragall E. Gibert I. Barbé J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 777-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We have quantitated the in vivo transcription of genes encoding for components of both glutaredoxin and thioredoxin pathways by means of a novel multiplex reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) approach (10Prieto-Álamo M.J.

In this protocol, all target genes, a housekeeping gene (also named control gene, reference gene, or internal standard), and one external standard are amplified in the same reaction tube. Specific fluorescent primers are used, and amplification products are analyzed with a DNA sequencer. Putative variations in the expression of the housekeeping gene are controlled by the external standard. Relative expressions of the targets to the reference (or to the external standard) are measured. Lately (13Pueyo C. Jurado J. Prieto-Álamo M.J. Monje-Casas F. López-Barea J. Methods Enzymol. 2001; Google Scholar), we have experimentally demonstrated that our methodology fulfills all theoretical requirements for precise quantification of both induction and repression of gene transcription. Because of the PCR amplification step, our method displays a much higher sensitivity than those of current techniques for mRNA quantitation, like Northern blotting or primer extension analyses. Here, we used this sensitive experimental approach to identify those growth conditions and stress circumstances under which expression of nrdHIEF genes might be required inE. coli.

In this last case, the multiplex PCR amplification was performed in a mixture (25-μl final volume) containing MPCR buffer 3 (Maxim Biotech Inc., San Francisco, CA) supplemented with 1 mmMgCl2, a 250 μm concentration of each dNTP, 1 μl of cDNA solution, 1.25 units of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase, and primers at the following concentrations: 0.07 μm(nrdH), 0.09 μm (nrdE), 0.04 μm (gapA), and 0.14 μm (external standard). After incubation at 95 °C for 12 min (for activation of DNA polymerase), 26 cycles of PCR were performed. Each cycle consisted of 1 min of denaturation at 94 °C and 45 s of annealing and enzymatic primer extension at 70 °C. These multiplex PCR conditions were optimized as detailed (13Pueyo C. Jurado J. Prieto-Álamo M.J. Monje-Casas F. López-Barea J. Methods Enzymol. 2001; Google Scholar) to ensure that the amplifications were in the exponential phase and that the efficiencies remained constant in the course of the PCR. Reaction products were quantified as described previously (12Gallardo-Madueño R. Leal J.F.M. Dorado G. Holmgren A. López-Barea J. Pueyo C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18382-18388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Differences among PCR outcomes were normalized by comparing the fluorescence intensity of each band to that resulting from gapA amplification (internal standard). The levels ofgapA in reference to the external standard remained essentially equal among the strains and experimental conditions investigated in this work. Consequently, changes detected with reference to the housekeeping gapA gene were accurately attributed to variations in the expression levels of the target genes under analysis. Samples for comparison of different experimental conditions or different bacterial strains were handled in parallel. Data are the means ± S.E. from n ≥ 6 independent multiplexed PCR amplifications. Statistical comparisons were done by a hierarchical analysis of variance with SAS software (Statistical Analysis System, version 6.03). Data presented here as relative expression ratios do not provide any indication of the mechanism that contributes to the dynamic control of a particular mRNA concentration, whether it is the rate of transcription initiation or the rate of transcript turnover. In a prior study (11Jordan A. Aragall E. Gibert I. Barbé J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 777-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), expression of nrdEF genes was quantified by a competitive RT-PCR, in which the competitor had an internal deletion of 99 base pairs and the reaction products were resolved in ethidium bromide-agarose gels and analyzed by densitometry. Several points at which errors can occur by using such a methodology include differences in amplification efficiencies because of the great size difference between the competitor and the target, possible heteroduplex formation, and the need to compensate for differences in fragment label incorporation. When measuring rare species of mRNA, which requires a high number of PCR cycles, the control of those problems is of maximal importance, even for relative quantification (e.g.see Refs. 22Freeman W.M. Walker S.J. Vrana K.E. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 112-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (857) Google Scholar, 23Raeymaekers L. Anal.

In this work, by taking advantage of the high sensitivity, accuracy, and reproducibility of our multiplex RT-PCR procedure (13Pueyo C. Jurado J. Prieto-Álamo M.J. Monje-Casas F. López-Barea J. Methods Enzymol. 2001; Google Scholar), we monitored variations in basal levels ofnrdHIEF expression and in response to several stress conditions. To achieve this objective, we first confirmed that transcription from the nrdHIEF promoter normally takes place in wild-type cells and increases upon hydroxyurea exposure (11Jordan A. Aragall E. Gibert I. Barbé J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 777-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). UC5710 cells were, thus, exposed to increasing concentrations of hydroxyurea (varying from 1 to 30 mm) for 5 min. Thereafter, the expression of all of the genes that constitute thenrdHIEF operon was examined by using the primer pair set in Table I. Basal levels of nrdH,nrdI, nrdE, and nrdF gene expression were readily detected and increased upon hydroxyurea treatment (data not shown). As an average, an induction level of 12.4 ± 2.5-fold (relative to untreated bacteria) was observed at the minimal dose assayed of 1 mm. It is worth noting that in the prior study by Jordan et al. (11Jordan A. Aragall E. Gibert I. Barbé J. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 777-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), such an induction level was observed under much more acute treatment conditions (bacteria grown in the presence of 50 mm hydroxyurea). Since we do not detect differences in the number of times that expression of eachnrd gene was increased by hydroxyurea, the multiplex PCR was simplified in further experiments by amplifying just two (nrdH and nrdE) of the four genes included in thenrdHIEF transcription unit (in addition to the internal and external standards). The expression profiles of nrdH andnrdE genes throughout the growth curve of wild-type UC5710 cells in rich LB medium are shown in Fig.1. Maximal expression levels were observed at the initial stages of exponential growth (A600 ≤ 0.2); then gene expression decreased rapidly, reaching 25-fold lower levels as the culture continued growing from midexponential to stationary phase (A600 ≥ 0.4). Fis and RpoS (also named ςS or ς38) are two regulatory proteins with acute growth phase-dependent expression in LB medium (25Ball C.A. Osuna R. Ferguson K.C. Johnson R.C. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 8043-8056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,26Jishage M. Ishihama A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6832-6835Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). To determine the hypothetical influence of Fis and RpoS on thenrdH and nrdE transcript levels during the course of cell growth in LB, both fis::767 andrpoS::Tn10 mutants were analyzed in comparison with otherwise isogenic wild-type cells. Data obtained (not shown) indicate that neither the presence of Fis nor the presence of RpoS affects the expression of nrH and nrdI genes in E. coli. Notable variations in gene expression were observed also with respect to the composition of the growth medium (Fig. 1). Thus, bacteria growing on M9 minimal medium with glucose had from 2-fold (A600 = 0.2) to 75-fold (A600 = 0.7) higher levels of nrdHand nrdE transcripts than did bacteria growing on rich LB medium alone. Since carbon sources control intracellular cAMP levels (27Epstein W. Rothman-Denes L.B. Hesse J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 2300-2304Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), we examined next the effects on nrdH andnrdE expression, of the addition of glucose to the LB nutrient medium (to 2 g/liter), and of replacement of glucose by lactose as the sole carbon source in the M9 minimal medium. No dependence on carbon source was observed (data not shown). As indicated above, -fold variations were identical for bothnrdH and nrdE genes; nrdH data will henceforth be considered representative of the entirenrdHIEF transcription unit. In addition to the classic function of acting as reductants for RRase, both the Trx and Grx/GSH pathways are required to maintain the low thiol-disulfide redox potential of the bacterial cytoplasm (20Åslund F. Zheng M. Beckwith J. Storz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6161-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 28Prinz W.A. Åslund F. Holmgren A. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15661-15667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). On the other hand, catalase, alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, and superoxide dismutase activities maintain the steady-state concentrations of peroxides and superoxide beneath their respective toxicity thresholds (29Storz G. Imlay J.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). The influence of missing various components of these systems on basal levels of nrdHIEFexpression is studied in Table II. Significant increments in the steady-state levels of nrdHIEFtranscript were detected in mutants compromised either in both the Trx- and Grx/GSH-reducing pathways or in the removal of endogenous oxidants. Of particular note is the large up-regulation (>30-fold) quantified in bacteria lacking Trx1 in combination with either Grx1 (UC827) or GSH (UC1358) or missing both catalase hydroperoxidase I and alkyl hydroperoxide reductase activities (UC4101).Table IIBasal levels of gene expression in bacteria defective in Trx and Grx/GSH pathways or in antioxidant enzymesStrainRelevant phenotypenrdHIEF/gapA ratioVariation-foldUC5710Wild type0.013 ± 0.0011.0UC1342OxyR−0.020 ± 0.0021.5UC1394OxyRc0.012 ± 0.0010.9UC1101Wild type/pKM1010.020 ± 0.0021.5Deficient in Trx and Grx/GSH pathwaysUC827Trx1−Grx1−1.342 ± 0.112103.2UC1358Trx1−Gsh−0.425 ± 0.02332.7UC1363Trx1−Gsh−OxyR−0.707 ± 0.10354.4UC1395Trx1−Gsh−OxyRc0.154 ± 0.01111.8Deficient in peroxide/superoxide scavenging enzymesUC499KatG−0.015 ± 0.0011.2UC4910AhpCF−0.009 ± 0.0010.7UC1049KatG−KatE−0.031 ± 0.0022.4UC4101KatG−AhpCF−0.906 ± 0.05769.7UC498KatG−KatE−/pKM1010.025 ± 0.0031.9UC628SodA−SodB−/pKM1010.076 ± 0.0045.8Cells were grown in LB broth to reach an A600 of 0.7.

Boldface type indicates statistically significant increments relative to wild type UC5710. Since OxyR can be activated either by challenge with an oxidant such as H2O2 or directly by a change in the cellular thiol-disulfide status caused by the inactivation of the two Trx- and Grx/GSH-reductive pathways (20Åslund F. Zheng M. Beckwith J. Storz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6161-6165Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 28Prinz W.A. Åslund F. Holmgren A. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15661-15667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), it seemed possible that the transcriptional induction of nrdHIEF that we report in TableII was due to activation of OxyR. This possibility was investigated by studying the effects of oxyR mutant alleles on basal levels of gene expression in UC1358. As shown in Table II, expression ofnrdHIEF genes was modulated by mutations in theoxyR regulatory locus, but it followed a pattern opposite to that exhibited by most OxyR-regulated genes (10Prieto-Álamo M.J.

We used three different inducible UCP2 expression constructs to achieve mitochondrial UCP2 expression levels in yeast of 33, 283, and 4100 ng of UCP2/mg of mitochondrial protein. Yeast mitochondria expressing UCP2 at 33 or 283 ng/mg showed no increase in proton conductance, even in the presence of various putative effectors, including palmitate and all-trans-retinoic acid. Only when UCP2 expression in yeast mitochondria was increased to 4 μg/mg, more than an order of magnitude greater than the highest known physiological concentration, was proton conductance increased. This increased proton conductance was not abolished by GDP. At this high level of UCP2 expression, an inhibition of substrate oxidation was observed, which cannot be readily explained by an uncoupling activity of UCP2. Quantitatively, even the uncoupling seen at 4 μg/mg was insufficient to account for the basal proton conductance of mammalian mitochondria. These observations suggest that uncoupling of yeast mitochondria by UCP2 is an overexpression artifact leading to compromised mitochondrial integrity.

It is clear that, under some experimental conditions, heterologous or transgenic expression of these proteins can cause an increase in the proton conductance of the inner membrane (16Rial E.

However, it is less obvious whether these experimental observations of uncoupling are due to a native protein activity of the UCP1 homologues, or represent a more general disruption of mitochondrial function. None of the effects observed in genetically manipulated model systems has been repeated in natural systems where changes in the levels of UCP2 and/or UCP3 occur as a response to some environmental or physiological condition (19Cadenas S.

Physiol. 1999; 277: E380-E389PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that expression of UCP1 in yeast mitochondria can cause a nonspecific uncoupling that is not due to protein activityper se (22Stuart J.A. Harper J.A. Brindle K.M. Brand M.D. Int. J. Obes. 2000; 24: S187Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23Stuart, J. A., Harper, J. A., Brindle, K. M., Jekabsons, M. B., and Brand, M. D. (2001) Biochem. J., in press.Google Scholar). This uncoupling artifact is present only at higher levels of UCP1 expression. At these levels, UCP1 expression in yeast also interferes with mitochondrial substrate oxidation. Similarly, Heidkaemper et al. (24Heidkaemper D. Winkler E. Muller V. Frischmuth K. Liu Q. Caskey T. Klingenberg M. FEBS Lett. 2000; 406: 1-6Google Scholar) have concluded that both UCP1 and UCP3 can be expressed in an incompetent form that interferes with ATP production. They suggest that most of the UCP3 expressed in yeast mitochondria is nonfunctional. There is considerable evidence that, under some expression regimes, a substantial proportion of the UCP1 expressed in yeast mitochondria is in fact not functional (23Stuart, J. A., Harper, J. A., Brindle, K. M., Jekabsons, M. B., and Brand, M. D. (2001) Biochem. J., in press.Google Scholar). In experiments with mammalian models, Cadenas et al. (18Cadenas S. Buckingham J.A. Clapham J.C. Brand M.D. Int. J. Obes. 2000; 24: S187Crossref Google Scholar) showed that transgenic mice overexpressing UCP3 in skeletal muscle mitochondria (17Clapham J.C. Arch J.R. Chapman H. Haynes A.

These observations suggest that UCP expression has compromised mitochondrial function in ways not related to uncoupling. This raises the question of whether the observed uncoupling following UCP2 or UCP3 expression might also be an artifact of expression and not represent a significant native activity of the protein. This is especially of concern because the amount of UCP2/UCP3 expressed in yeast mitochondria has not been quantified. Recently, information has become available regarding the levels of UCP2 that are found in mammalian mitochondria. Here we use this information, and three different yeast heterologous expression systems that yield different amounts of UCP2, to assess the effects of physiological, and supraphysiological, levels of UCP2 expression in yeast mitochondria. We relate the different levels of UCP2 expression to measured proton conductance and attempt to distinguish between native UCP2 activity and expression artifact. Human UCP2 was expressed in E. coli, where it accumulated as inclusion bodies that were subsequently harvested and used as a semipure source of UCP2 with which to calibrate UCP2 expression levels in yeast mitochondria. A PCR product for hUCP2 was made from a human mRNA library provided by Dr. Jan Digby (Department of Clinical Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom), and its sequence was verified. It was ligated into XbaI and EcoRI restriction sites of the pET expression vector pMW172 (25Way M. Pope B. Gooch J. Hawkins M. Weeds A.G. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 4103-4109Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Competent C41 strain E. coli were transfected with either pET-UCP2 or the empty pET vector. Cultures were incubated in TB media with 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C at 250 rpm until theA600 reached 0.5–0.6. Expression of UCP2 was induced by addition of 1 mmisopropyl-μ-d-thiogalactopyranoside. After 2 h cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 15 min. All centrifugation steps were carried out at 4 °C. Cell pellets were stored at −85 °C. Cells were lysed in B-PER reagent (Pierce) for 10–15 min at room temperature, centrifuged at 27,200 × g for 15 min and resuspended in B-PER containing 200 μg/ml lysozyme for 5–10 min to lyse any remaining cells. Inclusion bodies were harvested by centrifugation at 27,200 × g for 15 min. The pellet was washed three times by resuspension in buffer containing 150 mm potassium phosphate, 25 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, pH 7.8 (13Jaburek M. Varecha M. Gimeno R.E. Dembski M.

The final pellet was solubilized in 1.5% n-lauryl sarcosine for 45 min at room temperature. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 27,200 × g for 15 min. The supernatant (solubilized UCP2 inclusion bodies) was stored at −85 °C. Solubilized UCP2 inclusion bodies were electrophoresed on 19-cm 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for 2 h at 370 V (Fig. 1 a). UCP2 content was assessed with three different stains over a range of protein loadings. For Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 staining, protein loaded per lane was 2–20 μg (Fig. 1 a). For staining with silver (Bio-Rad) and SYPRO Orange (Bio-Rad), 0.1–1.0 μg of protein was loaded. Gels were dried overnight and then scanned using a Scanmaker 12 USL (Microtek) scanner. Band intensities were quantified using NIH Image 1.60 (available via FTP). The UCP2 content of inclusion bodies was quantified by comparing the UCP2 signal either to the signal obtained with bovine serum albumin (fraction V, assumed 90% pure) or to the total protein signal obtained within the lane. The mean estimate of the purity of the preparation used to calibrate UCP2 expression in yeast was 55 ± 7%. Mitochondrial samples and UCP2 inclusion bodies were loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and run at 160 V for 1 h in a Tris-glycine running buffer (28.8 g of glycine, 6 g of Tris in 1 liter) containing 0.1% SDS. Protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, using a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot® SD semidry electrophoretic transfer cell at 10 V for 35 min in running buffer lacking SDS and containing 20% methanol. The membrane was blocked in a phosphate-buffered saline solution containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) Marvel™ nonfat dry milk powder for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with either of two primary antibodies. One antibody (N-19; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was raised to a 19-amino acid epitope at the N terminus of human UCP2. It was used at a 1/1000 dilution in blocking buffer). Following several washing steps, these membranes were incubated with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-goat secondary antibody (Sigma), diluted 1/6000 in blocking buffer, for 45 min at room temperature. A second antibody (M-14; Calbiochem), raised to an epitope representing amino acids 144–157 of the mouse UCP2 sequence (which is 100% conserved between mouse and human UCP2), was also used. Membranes were incubated with a 1/2000 dilution of this primary antibody. Following several washing steps, they were exposed to an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody (New England Biolabs) diluted 1/4000 in blocking buffer. For both antibodies, membranes were washed twice in blocking buffer and twice in a buffer containing 10 mmTris-HCl, 10 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 9.5, then developed with a Phototope®-Star Western blot detection kit (New England Biolabs) and exposed for up to 1 h to Kodak X-Omat AR scientific imaging film. Films were scanned and analyzed as outlined above. UCP2 contents of yeast mitochondria were interpolated from a UCP2 inclusion body calibration series loaded on the same gel. Cells of theS. cerevisiae diploid, W303 (a/α), were transformed (26Hinnen A. Hicks J.B. Fink G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 1929-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar) with one of three different UCP2 expression constructs. UCP2low (pBF242) was made by ligating the UCP2 PCR product intoKpnI and BamHI restriction sites of the pYES2 vector (Invitrogen), so that a 144-base untranslated region was present between the transcription start site and the initiation ATG. UCP2mid (pRUCP2) was made by ligating the UCP2 PCR product intoKpnI and SacI restriction sites of the pYES2 vector, so that a Kozak (27Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8148Crossref PubMed Scopus (4172) Google Scholar) sequence (ACCATGG) was present at the initiation ATG. UCP2high (pBF346) was made by blunt-end ligation of the UCP2 PCR product into the pKV49 vector, so that a Kozak sequence (ATAATGG) was present at the initiation ATG. Precultures of yeast transformed with the pYES2 constructs were grown overnight in selective lactate (SL) media (28Bouillaud F. Arechaga I. Petit P.X. Raimbault S. Levi-Meyrueis C. Casteilla L.

Precultures were grown to an A600 of ∼2.0 and then transferred to an identical SL medium at 1/40 dilution for overnight growth. When cultures had reached anA600 of 0.5–0.8, 1% d-galactose was added to induce expression of UCP2. Cells were harvested after 4 h (or more; see “Results”). Mitochondria were isolated following (29Guerin B. Labbe P. Somlo M. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 55: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) from yeast cultures with A600 of between 1.0 and 1.5. Yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2500 × g for 5 min at room temperature, resuspended in Milli-Q grade water, recentrifuged, then resuspended in buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl and 20 mmdithiothreitol, pH 9.3, and incubated for 10 min at 30 °C. The cells were recentrifuged, washed twice in buffer containing 100 mm Tris-HCl and 500 mm KCl, pH 7.0, and resuspended in 5 ml of isotonic spheroplasting buffer (40 mm citric acid, 120 mm disodium hydrogen orthophosphate, 1.35 m sorbitol, 1 mm EGTA, pH 5.8). Lyticase was added at 3 mg/ml, and the cells were incubated at 30 °C for exactly 30 min. Subsequent steps were at 4 °C.

The spheroplasts were homogenized by 12 passes with a Wesley Coe homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were removed by pipette, to prevent disruption of the pellet, and centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 10 min. Mitochondrial pellets were washed in buffer containing 10 mm Tris-maleate, 0.65 m mannitol, 2 mm EGTA, pH 6.8, then resuspended in a small volume of this buffer and assayed for protein content (31Gornall A.G.

Respiratory control ratio (RCR) = (NADH + FCCP rate)/NADH rate. Complex III was inhibited with myxothiazol, and ascorbate in the presence of the artificial electron carrier N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) was used as a well defined respiratory substrate whose oxidation could be titrated conveniently. The oxygen electrode was fitted with a methyltriphenylphosphonium (TPMP)-sensitive electrode to allow simultaneous measurements of membrane potential (32Brand M.D. Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. Bioenergetics: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1995: 39-62Google Scholar) and oxygen consumption rate (which is equal to proton leak rate divided by the H+/O ratio of 4.0). The dependence of oxygen consumption rate on membrane potential gives the kinetic response of the proton leak to its driving force. The proton conductance at each membrane potential can be read from the proton leak curves. Mitochondria were suspended in electrode buffer at 0.5 mg/ml, 30 °C. Oligomycin (1 μg/ml) was added to inhibit the ATP synthase, so that all oxygen consumption was attributable to the leak pathway and not ATP synthesis. Nigericin (100 ng/ml) was added to clamp the pH gradient across the inner membrane. Myxothiazol (3 μm) was added to inhibit electron transport at respiratory complex III because some additions were in ethanol, which can be oxidized by yeast mitochondria through an NADH-linked pathway. 2 mm ascorbate was used as respiratory substrate. Ascorbate oxidation is through cytochromec oxidase and is linearly dependent on TMPD, which catalyzes electron transport to mitochondrial cytochrome c. The TPMP electrode was then calibrated with four additions, each of 1 μm TPMP. Ascorbate oxidation was increased sequentially by adding TMPD to cumulative concentrations of 6.25, 12.25, 25, 37.5, 50, and 75 μm. At each TMPD concentration, steady-state oxygen consumption and membrane potential were measured. Membrane potentials were calculated from TPMP concentrations outside the mitochondria, as described in Ref. 32Brand M.D. Brown G.C. Cooper C.E. Bioenergetics: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, New York1995: 39-62Google Scholar, assuming a TPMP binding correction of 0.4 (μl/mg)−1. A different TPMP binding correction would affect all the measured values of membrane potential but would not significantly affect our conclusions. Means were compared using Student'st test. Chemicals were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise stated. The levels of UCP2 expression in mitochondria isolated from transfected yeast were determined by Western blot using solubilized UCP2 inclusion bodies as calibration standards (Fig. 1). The two antibodies (C-14 and N-19) gave virtually identical results. UCP2 was expressed in yeast mitochondria at three levels that ranged from 33 ng/mg of mitochondrial protein in UCP2low yeast to 4 μg/mg in UCP2high yeast (Table I).Table IUCP2 expression levels in mitochondria isolated from yeast containing UCP2 expression constructsYeast expression constructInduction regimeUCP2 expression level(ng UCP2/mg mitochondrial protein)UCP2lowOvernight 2%d-galactose32.5 ± 3.3UCP2midOvernight 2% d-galactose283 ± 22UCP2high4-h 1% d-galactose4066 ± 1274UCP2 concentrations were determined using N-19 antibody calibrated with inclusion body UCP2 (see “Experimental Procedures”).

Values represent means ± S.E. from three to five separate experiments with two or three transformants for each construct. Induction of UCP2 expression in UCP2low yeast had no effect on yeast growth rates. The mean doubling time of UCP2low yeast in selective galactose medium was 1.83 ± 0.07 h, compared with 1.81 ± 0.03 h (S.E., n = 6) in paired controls grown under identical conditions. Respiration rates with NADH as substrate, both coupled and uncoupled with FCCP, were not different between UCP2low mitochondria and their paired controls (Table II). Palmitate (50 μm) stimulated respiration equally in UCP2low and control mitochondria (data not shown). The proton leak kinetics were determined in mitochondria isolated from UCP2low yeast and paired controls (Fig.2 a). Over the range of membrane potentials (driving force for proton leak), no differences in proton conductance were observed. Induction of UCP2 expression in UCP2mid yeast had no effect on growth. The doubling time of UCP2mid yeast growing in exponential phase following induction was 1.75 ± 0.06 h, compared with 1.77 ± 0.06 (S.E., n = 6) for paired controls. Respiration rates with NADH as substrate, both coupled and uncoupled with FCCP, were not different in mitochondria isolated from UCP2mid yeast and paired controls (Table II). Palmitate (50 μm) and all-trans-retinoic acid (45 μm, buffer, pH 7.3) stimulated respiration equally in UCP2mid and control mitochondria (Fig. 3, a andb). The proton leak kinetics of UCP2mid mitochondria were similar to control mitochondria (Fig. 2 b). UCP2mid mitochondria had identical, or perhaps slightly lower, proton conductance than controls at all measured values of membrane potential. Induction of UCP2 expression in UCP2high yeast significantly inhibited growth rate in the exponential phase. The doubling time of UCP2high yeast in exponential phase following induction with 1% d-galactose was 4.1 ± 0.1 h, compared with 2.6 ± 0.1 h (S.E., n = 7) for paired controls. Mitochondria isolated from UCP2high yeast had significantly higher rates of respiration with NADH as substrate, slightly (not significantly) lowered FCCP uncoupled rates and significantly lowered respiratory control (Table II and Fig. 3 c). GDP did not inhibit respiration with NADH as substrate in UCP2high mitochondria or their paired controls (Fig. 3 c). 3 mm GDP slightly stimulated respiration in UCP2high mitochondria (Fig.3 c), perhaps through the nucleotide inducible proton conductance pathway (33Prieto S. Bouillaud F. Rial E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our assay conditions were designed to minimize the proton leak through this pathway (33Prieto S. Bouillaud F. Rial E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 334: 43-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), but may not have abolished it entirely. UCP2high yeast mitochondria had altered proton leak kinetics (Fig.2 c). At all measured membrane potentials, proton conductance was greater in UCP2high mitochondria. Membrane potentials and oxygen consumption rates can be compared for each concentration of TMPD; UCP2high mitochondria achieved a lower membrane potential, but did not respire faster than control mitochondria. Increased proton conductance normally lowers membrane potential and stimulates respiration (34Brand M.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1018: 128-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Thus, substrate (ascorbate/TMPD) oxidation was impaired in UCP2high mitochondria. Indeed, fully FCCP-uncoupled rates of NADH oxidation in UCP2high mitochondria became progressively impaired as the time between UCP2 induction and mitochondrial isolation increased (Fig.4). This was also apparent when the oxidized substrate was ascorbate/TMPD (data not shown). Antibodies to UCP2 are typically able to detect the presence of the protein expressed in yeast mitochondria, but the same antibodies often fail to detect UCP2 in mitochondria from mammalian tissues. Recently, this has been shown to be due to two limitations: low levels of UCP2 in mitochondria from most mammalian tissues, and cross-reactivity of the commercially available UCP2 antibodies with other proteins with apparent molecular masses of about 32 kDa. Nonetheless, UCP2 levels in mammalian mitochondria have recently been quantified, using an antibody whose specificity has been verified using mitochondria from the tissues of wild-type and"
https://openalex.org/W2047453411,"We recently reported that the marked decrease in cellular ceramide in primary astrocytes is an early event associated with the mitogenic activity of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (Riboni, L., Viani, P., Bassi, R., Stabieini, A., and Tettamanti, G. (2000) GLIA32, 137–145). Here we show that a rapid activation of sphingomyelin biosynthesis appears to be the major mechanism responsible for the fall in ceramide levels induced by bFGF. When quiescent astrocytes were treated with bFGF, an increased amount of newly synthesized ceramide (from eitherl-[3H]serine or [3H]sphingosine) was directed toward the biosynthesis of sphingomyelin. Conversely, bFGF did not appear to affect ceramide levels by other metabolic pathways involved in ceramide turnover such as sphingomyelin degradation and ceramide biosynthesis, degradation, and glucosylation. Enzymatic studies demonstrating a relevant and rapid increase in sphingomyelin synthase activity after bFGF treatment have provided a convincing explanation for the activation of sphingomyelin biosynthesis. The bFGF-induced increase in sphingomyelin synthase appears to depend on a post-translational activation mechanism. Moreover, in the presence of brefeldin A, the activation of sphingomyelin biosynthesis was abolished, suggesting that the enzyme is located in a compartment other than the Golgi apparatus. Also the phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C inhibitor D609 exerted a potent inhibitory effect on sphingomyelin biosynthesis. Finally, we demonstrate that inhibition of sphingomyelin biosynthesis by brefeldin A or D609 led to a significant inhibition of bFGF-stimulated mitogenesis. All this supports that, in primary astrocytes, the early activation of sphingomyelin synthase is involved in the bFGF signaling pathway leading to proliferation. We recently reported that the marked decrease in cellular ceramide in primary astrocytes is an early event associated with the mitogenic activity of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (Riboni, L., Viani, P., Bassi, R., Stabieini, A., and Tettamanti, G.

All this supports that, in primary astrocytes, the early activation of sphingomyelin synthase is involved in the bFGF signaling pathway leading to proliferation. Ceramide, a key sphingolipid metabolite in both the biosynthesis and degradation of complex sphingolipids, is involved in the signal transduction of different extracellular stimuli that lead to cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptotic cell death (reviewed in Refs. 1Riboni L. Viani P. Bassi R. Prinetti A. Tettamanti G. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 153-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 2Perry D.K. Hannun Y.A. Biochim. Biophys.

Acta. 2000; 1485: 63-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In all these events, the ceramide concentration, possibly at specific subcellular sites, is crucial. There is evidence that different activators such as cytokines, growth factors, and hormones elicit their biological effect by modulating the activity of sphingomyelinases, ceramide synthase, or neutral ceramidase (reviewed in Refs. 1Riboni L.

A role of ceramide as an intracellular mediator of specific extracellular agents has been recognized also in cells from the central nervous system (reviewed in Refs. 6Jayadev S. Hannun Y.A. J. Lipid Mediat. Cell Signal. 1996; 14: 295-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 7Futerman A.H. Biochemistry ( Engl. Trans. Biokhimiya ). 1998; 63: 89-100Google Scholar, 8Mathias S. Peña L.A.

In neuronal and glial cells, the administration of differentiating or apoptotic agents results in increased cellular levels of ceramide, which, in turn, participate in the cascade of events producing the final effects (9Dobrowsky R.T.

In particular, we found that, in quiescent primary astrocytes, the induction of proliferation by bFGF is paralleled by an early and marked decrease in the cellular content of ceramide, an event associated with the signaling pathways responsible for the mitogenic activity of bFGF (13Riboni L. Viani P. Bassi R. Stabilini A. Tettamanti G. GLIA. 2000; 32: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, the metabolic pathway responsible for the reduction of the ceramide levels in astrocytes after bFGF treatment still remained to be discovered. In fact, the bFGF-stimulated astrocytes showed no variation in either sphingomyelin (SM) degradation or ceramide cleavage (13Riboni L. Viani P. Bassi R. Stabilini A. Tettamanti G. GLIA. 2000; 32: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Note that these variations were observed in a glioma cell line stimulated by neurotrophins (9Dobrowsky R.T. Werner M.H. Castellino M. Chao M.V. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1994; 265: 1596-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar) and in bFGF-treated extraneural cells (18Coroneos E. Wang Y. Panuska J.R. Templeton D.J. Kester M. Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), respectively. Thus, this study focused on the metabolic pathway underlying the decrease in cellular ceramide, an early event triggered by bFGF in stimulating astrocyte proliferation.

Neurochem. 1988; 51: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the plates were washed twice with supplemented BMEM containing 0.5% fetal calf serum, and the cells were incubated for 48–72 h in the same medium prior to use as quiescent cells. At the time of experiments, 20 ng/ml bFGF was added, and the cells were incubated for different times. Cell viability was assessed by the trypan blue exclusion test. In pulse experiments, quiescent cells were fed 200 nm [3H]Ser, 40 nm[3H]Sph, or 1 μm[d-erythro-sphingosine-3H]GM1 in serum-free supplemented BMEM (20Riboni L. Viani P. Tettamanti G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 656-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) in the absence or presence of 20 ng/ml bFGF. In chase experiments, after a pulse with the above radiolabeled compounds in the absence of bFGF, the cells were submitted to a period of chase in serum-free supplemented BMEM containing 20 ng/ml bFGF. After appropriate pulse or chase times (see below), the medium was carefully collected, and the cells were rapidly washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by a rubber scraper, and submitted to lipid extraction. The total lipids were extracted and partitioned from cells at 4 °C as recently described (20Riboni L. Viani P. Tettamanti G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 656-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). After partitioning, the organic phase was subjected to a mild alkaline methanolysis (treatment with methanolic 0.1 n KOH at 37 °C for 1 h). After counting for radioactivity, the obtained methanolyzed organic phase and aqueous phase were analyzed by HPTLC using the following solvent systems (by volume): A, chloroform/methanol/water (55:20:3); B, chloroform, methanol, and 32% NH4OH (40:10:1); C, chloroform, methanol, and 0.2% CaCl2 (55:45:10); and D, chloroform, methanol, and 0.5% CaCl2 (55:45:10). After HPTLC, the plates were radioscanned with a digital autoradiograph (Berthold, Bad Wiedbad, Germany) and then submitted to fluorography. Recognition and identification of [3H]ceramide, [3H]SM, [3H]glucosylceramide (Glc-Cer), and other3H-labeled metabolites were performed as previously described (19Riboni L. Bassi R. Sonnino S. Tettamanti G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 300: 188-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 20Riboni L. Viani P. Tettamanti G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 656-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In some cases, the medium was centrifuged (1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), and the supernatant was processed for volatile radioactivity (20Riboni L. Viani P. Tettamanti G. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 656-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Quiescent cultures were incubated for different times in supplemented BMEM containing 20 ng/ml bFGF in the absence or presence of 1 μm actinomycin D, 10 μg/ml cycloheximide, 1–2 μg/ml BFA, or 10–20 μg/ml D609. Stock solutions of cycloheximide and BFA were prepared in distilled methanol and ethanol, respectively, and added to the medium to the desired final concentration (the final solvent concentration never exceeded 0.1%). D609 was dissolved in sterile phosphate-buffered saline on the day of the experiment. In the presence of all inhibitors at the concentrations used, no sign of cell toxicity was detected for up to 24 h of treatment. SM synthase was assayed as previously described (23Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14550-14559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), with some modifications. The astrocytes were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and collected by scraping in ice-cold lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. Cell homogenates, obtained by sonication in lysis buffer (3 × 10 s at 4 °C), were used fresh as the enzyme source. In the enzyme assay, the reaction mixture contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 25 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 5–20 μg of cell proteins in a final volume of 50 μl. The reaction was started by the addition of 2 nmol of C6-[3H]ceramide as an equimolar complex with fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (complex specific activity of 300 nCi/nmol). After incubation for 10–30 min at 37 °C, the reaction was terminated by the addition of 200 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:2, by volume) at 4 °C; the tubes were centrifuged, and aliquots of the supernatant were applied to an HPTLC plate that was developed in solvent system D (see above). Background values were obtained by blocking the reaction at time 0, with incubation at 37 °C being omitted. Quiescent cultures were incubated with bFGF for 24 h, and 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine was added to each dish 4 h before cell harvesting. The [3H]thymidine incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-insoluble materials was then determined. Each independent experiment was performed at least in triplicate, using independent cultures. Total protein was assayed (24Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin (fraction V) as the standard. SM was determined, after perchloric acid digestion, as reported (25Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Dodge J.T. Phillips G.B. J. Lipid Res. 1967; 8: 667-675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting, fluorography, or radiochromatoscanning using the digital autoradiograph. Statistical significance of differences was determined by Student's ttest. To investigate the biochemical mechanisms involved in the rapid decrease in ceramide upon bFGF treatment, the initial experiments were focused on the possible effects of bFGF on ceramide biosynthesis. For this purpose, [3H]Ser, the precursor of the de novo biosynthetic pathway of ceramide, was administered to quiescent and bFGF-treated astrocytes, and its metabolic fate was followed in pulse and pulse-chase experiments. In pulse experiments, 45 and 90 min after [3H]Ser administration, quiescent and bFGF-treated cells incorporated similar amounts of radioactivity, which increased with time (Fig. 1, upper left panel). Under these experimental conditions, also the amount of3H-labeled sphingolipids, measured after partitioning and mild alkaline methanolysis, increased with pulse time, but remained unaffected by bFGF treatment (Fig. 1, upper middle panel). Within the 3H-labeled sphingolipids, the radiolabeled ceramide also increased during the pulse, with no difference between the control and bFGF-stimulated astrocytes (Fig. 1, upper right panel). After a 90-min pulse with [3H]Ser, radioactive ceramide decreased with chase time, and [3H]SM was detected as the major 3H-labeled sphingolipid (Fig. 1, lower panels). Under such conditions, the bFGF administration was followed by a marked, significant reduction of [3H]ceramide (Fig. 1, lower left panel); the amount of this sphingolipid was ∼40 and 50% lower than that in quiescent cells after 2 and 4 h of chase, respectively. At the same times, in bFGF-treated cells, the radioactivity incorporated into SM was increased (Fig. 1, lower middle panel), whereas the amount of radioactive Glc-Cer was similar to that in quiescent cells (Fig. 1, lower right panel). These data suggest that ceramide utilization as a precursor of SM biosynthesis could be stimulated by bFGF. Taking into account that exogenous Sph is rapidly incorporated first into ceramide and then into SM in astrocytes (27Riboni L. Bassi R. Prinetti A. Viani P. Tettamanti G. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 28Riboni L. Viani P. Bassi R. Giussani P. Tettamanti G. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), an additional study using [3H]Sph was performed. Quiescent cells were submitted to a 20-min pulse with this molecule (sufficient to obtain [3H]ceramide as the major3H-labeled metabolite) in the absence or presence of bFGF. The results demonstrate that, in quiescent and bFGF-treated cells, the amount of [3H]ceramide synthesized from [3H]Sph was similar (132 ± 10 and 125 ± 12 nCi/mg of protein, respectively). In a second set of experiments, after a 20-min pulse of quiescent cells with [3H]Sph, the fate of newly synthesized [3H]ceramide was followed in a chase in the absence or presence of bFGF. In bFGF-treated cells, a significant decrease in radiolabeled ceramide (Fig.2, upper left panel) concomitant with an increase in [3H]SM (upper right panel) was detected after both 30 and 60 min of chase. At the same times, quite similar amounts of radioactive Glc-Cer and GM3 were produced in quiescent and bFGF-treated cells (Fig. 2, lower panels). Under these conditions, also the complete degradation of [3H]ceramide did not appear to be modified by bFGF. In fact, the amount of 3H2O (detectable as the final degradation product) released in the medium after a 60-min chase accounted for 2.5 ± 0.27 and 2.3 ± 0.29 nCi/mg of protein in quiescent and bFGF-treated cells, respectively. Since Sph in cells is derived essentially from sphingolipid degradation and is mainly recycled for biosynthetic purposes (1Riboni L. Viani P. Bassi R. Prinetti A. Tettamanti G. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 153-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), further experiments were performed to confirm that ceramide, synthesized from the salvage of intracellularly produced Sph, was affected in bFGF-stimulated cells. Thus, we followed the turnover of radiolabeled ceramide and the formation of SM during a chase, after a pulse with [d-erythro-sphingosine-3H]GM1. The experimental conditions used allowed us to follow the recycling of Sph produced from ganglioside degradation and to determine the fate of ceramide produced from the salvage of catabolically produced Sph (29Riboni L. Bassi R. Prinetti A. Tettamanti G. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The results demonstrate that bFGF did not affect the total amount of radioactivity measured in the organic phase (Fig.3, upper left panel), but did affect the distribution within the major components. In fact, a marked reduction of [3H]ceramide paralleled by a relevant increase in [3H]SM occurred at both chase times (Fig. 3,lower panels). Under such conditions, no significant variation of [3H]Glc-Cer was detected (Fig. 3,upper right panel). On the basis of this evidence, we next assessed the in vitro activity of SM synthase. In these experiments, quiescent astrocytes were incubated with bFGF for different times, subsequently scraped off the dishes, and assayed for enzyme activity using C6-[3H]ceramide as substrate and optimized conditions. As shown in Fig.4, SM synthase activity was found to be enhanced by bFGF treatment. When the reaction rate was linear with incubation time and enzyme protein (Fig. 4, upper panels), the formation rate of the reaction product C6-[3H]SM was noticeably higher (1.8–2-fold) in the bFGF-treated cells than in the quiescent cells after a 1-h treatment with bFGF. In this in vitro assay, the activity of Glc-Cer synthase was 0.38 ± 0.04 and 0.42 ± 0.05 nmol/mg/min in quiescent and bFGF-treated astrocytes, respectively. Preincubation with the RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin or the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide had no effect on the bFGF-stimulated increase in SM synthase activity (Fig. 4, lower panel). Recent evidence demonstrating that D609, a phosphatidylcholine (PC)-specific phospholipase C inhibitor (30Müller-Decker K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 162: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 31Schütze S. Potthof K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Krönke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (964) Google Scholar), dramatically inhibits SM synthase in SV40-transformed fibroblasts (23Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14550-14559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) prompted us to investigate the effect of this compound on bFGF-stimulated SM synthase. The addition of 20 μg/ml D609 to astrocytes during bFGF stimulation resulted in ∼85% inhibition of SM synthase activity (Fig. 4, lower panel). A similar effect (∼80% inhibition) was obtained at 10 μg/ml. The activation of SM biosynthesis after bFGF treatment led us to evaluate whether the cellular level of SM was also affected by this growth factor. The results demonstrate that after 2 and 4 h of bFGF treatment, the amount of total SM in quiescent cells (13.67 ± 1.18 and 13.91 ± 1.16 nmol/mg of protein, respectively) was very similar to that in bFGF-treated cells (13.97 ± 1.26 and 14.31 ± 1.42 nmol/mg of protein, respectively). To obtain evidence concerning the subcellular location of the bFGF-stimulated SM synthase, a study was made of the effect of BFA, an inhibitor of the anterograde vesicular transport between Golgi compartments (32Klausner R.D. Donaldson J.G. Lippincott-Schwartz J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 1071-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1529) Google Scholar), on [3H]Sph incorporation into SM and other sphingolipids. In both quiescent and bFGF-treated astrocytes, the presence of BFA during a pulse with [3H]Sph resulted in an increase in [3H]ceramide and, above all, [3H]Glc-Cer, paralleled by a marked reduction of [3H]SM (Fig.5). Interestingly, the observed bFGF-induced decrease in [3H]ceramide and concomitant elevation of [3H]SM did not occur with BFA. The possible connection between stimulation of SM synthase and the mitogenic effect of bFGF was investigated. For this purpose, [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA was assessed in cells treated with BFA or D609 in the early phase of bFGF stimulation. As shown in Fig. 6, in astrocytes treated with bFGF, both BFA and D609 exerted a potent inhibitory effect on the incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA. The major finding of this study is that an increase in SM biosynthesis appears to be the major mechanism responsible for the rapid decrease in ceramide levels induced by bFGF in primary astrocytes, an event associated with bFGF-stimulated astrocyte proliferation (13Riboni L. Viani P. Bassi R. Stabilini A. Tettamanti G. GLIA. 2000; 32: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In fact, when quiescent cells were treated with bFGF, an increased amount of newly synthesized ceramide (either from [3H]Ser or [3H]Sph) was directed toward the biosynthesis of SM. On the other hand, under the same conditions, the biosynthesis of ceramide through either the de novo pathway or Sph recycling was not affected by bFGF. The activation of SM biosynthesis was further confirmed by studies demonstrating a significant increase in SM synthase activity after 1–2 h of stimulation with bFGF. Conversely, no effect was detected on ceramide biosynthesis, SM degradation, or ceramide removal by ceramidase in the early phases of bFGF stimulation (this study and Ref. 13Riboni L. Viani P. Bassi R. Stabilini A. Tettamanti G. GLIA. 2000; 32: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Under our experimental conditions, also the biosynthesis of Glc-Cer, particularly efficient in astrocytes (28Riboni L. Viani P. Bassi R. Giussani P. Tettamanti G. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 503-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and necessary for bFGF stimulation of axonal growth in hippocampal neurons (33Boldin S. Futerman A.H. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 882-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 34Boldin S.A. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9905-9909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), was not influenced by the growth factor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence of an association between activation of SM biosynthesis and growth stimulation of cells. In this respect, it is worth noting that SM synthase recently emerged as a negative regulator of endogenous ceramide levels involved in signaling processes (35Andieu-Abadie N. Carpentier S. Salvayre R. Levade T. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 91-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 36Bourteele S. Haußer A. Döppler H. Horn-Müller J. Röpke C. Schwarzmann G. Pfizenmaier K. Müller G.

Chem. 2000; 275: 14760-14766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been demonstrated that SV40-transformed lung fibroblasts contain a significantly higher SM synthase activity than normal lung fibroblasts, and a role for SM synthase in the regulation of cell growth has been suggested (23Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14550-14559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Our results appear to corroborate this hypothesis. We also observed that the stimulation of SM synthase activity by bFGF was not paralleled by significant changes in cellular SM content. This apparent contradiction could be explained by the evidence that the cellular concentration of SM in rat cerebellar astrocytes is 20-fold higher than that of ceramide (13Riboni L. Viani P. Bassi R. Stabilini A. Tettamanti G. GLIA. 2000; 32: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 27Riboni L. Bassi R. Prinetti A. Viani P. Tettamanti G. Biochem. J. 1999; 338: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Evidence from the literature supports that SM can be synthesized at more than one subcellular site. Although most studies indicate that SM synthase is mainly located in the cis- and medial-Golgi (38Voelker D.R. Kennedy E.P.

The M1 receptor is the predominant mAChR subtype in the cortex and hippocampus. Although the five mAChR fall into two broad functional groups, all five subtypes, when expressed in recombinant systems, can activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. The MAPK pathway has been implicated in learning and memory, amyloid protein processing, and neuronal plasticity. We used M1 knock-out mice to determine the role of this receptor subtype in signal transduction in the mouse forebrain. In primary cortical cultures from mice lacking the M1 mAChR, agonist-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis was reduced by more than 60% compared with cultures from wild type mice. Although muscarinic agonists induced robust activation of MAPK in cortical cultures from wild type mice, mAChR-mediated activation of MAPK was virtually absent in cultures from M1-deficient mice. These results indicate that the M1 mAChR is the major subtype that mediates activation of phospholipase C and MAPK in mouse forebrain.

Of the five subtypes of these seven transmembrane, G protein-coupled receptors, M1 is found in greatest abundance in the cortex and hippocampus where it constitutes 40–50% of the total mAChR (5Levey A.I. Proc. Internatl. Symp. Life Sci. 1993; 52: 441-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). The M1, M3, and M5 subtypes preferentially couple via the Gq/11 protein family to activate phospholipase C (PLC), stimulating phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis (6Wess J. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1996; 10: 69-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The resulting products, diacylglycerol and inositol trisphosphate, activate PKC and trigger a release of intracellular calcium, respectively. These events initiate an overlapping network of signals, including the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (7Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). M2 and M4 preferentially couple via Gi to inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity but in some cell types can also activate PLC (8Tietje K.M. Goldman P.S. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2828-2834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Tietje K.M. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17382-17387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These subtypes can also activate MAPK by direct G protein βγ subunit-mediated mechanisms (10Crespo P. Xu N. Simonds W.F. Gutkind J.S. Nature. 1994; 369: 418-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar) and potentially also via activation of PKC. The MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 (p44 and p42) are known to play a pivotal role in signaling events in the brain where they are involved in neuronal plasticity (11Orban P.C. Chapman P.F. Brambilla R.

Neuron. 1999; 21: 869-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (776) Google Scholar). In addition to activation by G protein-coupled receptors, the ERKs can be stimulated by growth factors signaling through receptor tyrosine kinases. Thus these kinases are poised at a critical position allowing cross-talk between a variety of signal transduction pathways. Although the functional properties of the individual mAChR subtypes have been well characterized in recombinant systems, the analysis of endogenous mAChR function in cells and tissues expressing multiple subtypes of mAChR is complicated by the lack of subtype-specific agonists and overlapping selectivity of antagonists. In addition, the apparent affinity of a putative subtype-selective antagonist can vary dramatically depending on membrane composition and lipid environment (18Berstein G. Haga T. Ichiyama A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 601-607PubMed Google Scholar), so that the same receptor polypeptide can potentially exhibit different ligand affinities in different cell types. We have previously shown that in mice with a targeted deletion of the gene encoding the M1 receptor, mAChR-mediated suppression of the M current potassium channel is completely lost in sympathetic neurons (19Hamilton S.E. Loose M.D. Qi M. Levey A.I. Hille B. McKnight G.S. Idzerda R.L. Nathanson N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13311-13316Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), whereas mAChR-mediated suppression of the M current in hippocampal neurons is unaltered (20Rouse S.T. Hamilton S.E. Potter L.T. Nathanson N.M. Conn P.J. Neurosci. Lett. 2000; 278: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, a given subtype of mAChR may not couple to the same functional pathway in different cell types. In this paper, we use mice lacking the M1 receptor to demonstrate that M1 is the main receptor subtype responsible for activation of PLC and MAPK in cultured cerebral cortical neurons.

Membranes were prepared from mouse heart, cerebellum, and forebrain as described by Luetje et al. (21Luetje C.W. Gierschik P. Milligan G. Unson C. Spiegel A. Nathanson N.M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4876-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Dissected mouse tissues were placed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing protease inhibitors, homogenized on ice 25 times in a glass-glass homogenizer, and centrifuged at 36 × g for 15 min to remove debris. The supernatant was centrifuged at 8000 ×g for 15 min to pellet membranes. After determination of protein concentration, 55 μg of membrane protein was solubilized in an SDS sample buffer containing 8 m urea and loaded onto a 3.5% stacking SDS-polyacrylamide gel and a 7% separating SDS-polyacrylamide gel, each containing 4 m urea. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane, and immunoblot analysis was carried out as described by McKinnon and Nathanson (22McKinnon L.A. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20636-20642Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) using affinity-purified polyclonal anti-M1 antibody directed against the third cytoplasmic loop of the mouse M1(19Hamilton S.E. Loose M.D. Qi M. Levey A.I. Hille B. McKnight G.S. Idzerda R.L. Nathanson N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13311-13316Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Primary cortical cultures were prepared as described by Chan et al. (23Chan G.C.-K.,G.C. Hinds T.R. Impey S. Storm D.R. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5322-5332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cerebral cortices of newborn mouse brains were digested with papain for 20 min at 37 °C. The rinsed tissue was then triturated 15 times and allowed to settle. Supernatants were saved, and the trituration was repeated on remaining tissue. Supernatants were combined, and cortical neurons were seeded on plates treated with polylysine for a minimum of 2 h. Neurons for PI assays and determination of MAPK activation were plated in 24-well (0.15 × 106 cells/well) and 6-well (1 × 106 cells/well) plates, respectively. Cells were grown in neurobasal medium containing B-27 supplement, glutamine (1 mm), penicillin (0.05 units/ml), and streptomycin (0.05 μg/ml) and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Medium was changed one and three days after plating and contained 3.6 μmcytosine-β-d-arabinoside to retard glial growth. The expression of the M3 mAChR was determined by immunoprecipitation analysis using a polyclonal antibody specific for the M3 mAChR as described (19Hamilton S.E. Loose M.D. Qi M. Levey A.I. Hille B. McKnight G.S. Idzerda R.L. Nathanson N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13311-13316Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). After six to eight days in culture, PI turnover was measured as described (24Shapiro R.A. Scherer N.M. Habecker B.A. Subers E.M. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18397-18403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Subers E.M. Nathanson N.M. J. Mol. Cell Cardiol. 1988; 20: 131-140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were incubated overnight in culture medium containing 1 μCi/mlmyo-[2-3H]inositol (18.3 Ci/mmol). Cells were washed and incubated 30 min at 37 °C with physiological saline solution (118 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 3 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mmKH2PO4, 10 mm glucose, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 10 mm LiCl. Carbachol or ACPD was added for 15 min before the reaction was terminated with ice-cold methanol. Total inositol phosphates were quantified using ion exchange chromatography. Each drug condition was performed in quadruplicate for each of four cultures/genotype. MAPK analysis was performed on cultures seven to 10 days after plating. Two h before stimulation, cultures were treated with tetrodotoxin (1 μm), CNQX (40 μm), APV (100 μm), and nimodipine (5 μm) to decrease endogenous synaptic activity (26Xia Z. Dudek H. Miranti C.K. Greenberg M.E. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5425-5436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were stimulated for the intervals indicated with oxo (100 μm) and PMA (0.1 μm) or pretreated with atropine (3 μm) for 5 min before a 5-min stimulation with oxo. Medium was aspirated, and cells were washed two times with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 100 μl 4× SDS sample buffer. Scraped cells were placed in 1.5-ml polypropylene tubes, sonicated 10 s, boiled 5 min, cooled, and centrifuged. Samples (25 μl) were run on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P membrane. Membranes were incubated with phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody (1:2000) overnight, and bands were detected by ECL. Blots were stripped using the method supplied with Immobilon-P membrane and reprobed with monoclonal anti-MAPK antibody (1:2000) for 2 h, and bands were visualized by ECL. Autoradiograms were scanned (Scan Wizard PPC 3.0.7, Microtek) and processed (Adobe Photoshop 5.0), and the p42 phospho-ERK band intensities were determined (NIH Image 1.62). Results were internally normalized and applied to the intensity data obtained from the respective anti-phospho-MAPK blots to correct for differences in protein loading. Previously, we showed that the M1-KO mice do not express detectable M1 protein as determined by immunoprecipitation of radioligand-labeled, digitonin-solubilized receptors (19Hamilton S.E. Loose M.D. Qi M. Levey A.I. Hille B. McKnight G.S. Idzerda R.L. Nathanson N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13311-13316Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Recent work has shown that fragments of the mAChR can interact to form a reconstituted functional receptor. The interaction between receptor fragments containing transmembrane domains I–V and fragments containing transmembrane VI–VII depends on the presence of the long third intracellular loop, and chimeric receptors containing these separate domains exhibited agonist-induced functional activity (27Maggio R. Barbier P. Colelli A. Salvadori F. Demontis G. Corsini G.U. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 291: 251-257PubMed Google Scholar, 28Maggio R. Barbier P. Fornai F. Corsini G.U. J. Biol.

A. 1993; 90: 3103-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Because our targeting construct used to generate M1-KO mice lacked the nucleotides coding for the first 55 amino acids of the M1 receptor, it would be possible for protein synthesis to initiate at a downstream methionine, resulting in the expression of a truncated polypeptide containing most of the transmembrane domains as well as the third cytoplasmic loop. If this truncated protein were indeed synthesized, it could interact with one of the remaining mAChR polypeptides to produce a protein exhibiting the functional coupling of the M1 receptor but would not necessarily be stable to detergent solubilization and subsequent detection by immunoprecipitation. To determine whether this possibility was occurring, we performed immunoblot analysis using an antiserum prepared against the third cytoplasmic loop of the M1 receptor to ensure that this portion of M1 was absent in our M1-KO mice. In addition to mouse tissues, protein from the mouse Y1 adrenal cell line and Y1 cells stably transfected with mouse M1 (Y1-M1) under an inducible promoter (24Shapiro R.A. Scherer N.M. Habecker B.A. Subers E.M. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18397-18403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were analyzed simultaneously. A strong signal was detected in the WT forebrain, which was significantly reduced in forebrain from heterozygote mice (Fig. 1). As expected from the negligible expression of the M1 receptor in cerebellum and heart, no signal was detected in these tissues. Immunoreactivity to M1 was not detectable in any of the M1-KO tissues. The Y1-M1 cells express two immunoreactive proteins, the lower corresponding to the band in the M1-HET and WT forebrain samples with an apparent molecular mass of 60 kDa. These results, combined with our previous data (19Hamilton S.E. Loose M.D. Qi M. Levey A.I. Hille B. McKnight G.S. Idzerda R.L. Nathanson N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13311-13316Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), indicate that a polypeptide containing the functionally vital third cytoplasmic loop of the M1 receptor is completely absent in the M1-KO mice and that there most likely is no ectopic translation of a truncated protein. To measure the effects of inactivating the M1 receptor on mAChR-mediated activation of PLC, we measured the stimulation of PI hydrolysis in primary cortical cultures derived from WT and M1-KO mice in response to the muscarinic agonist carbachol. The mean maximum increase in inositol phosphates obtained with WT cultures was 250% above basal level (Fig. 2 A). In M1-KO cultures this maximal level was reduced by a factor of 2.6 with a mean stimulation of 95% above basal. We previously showed by quantitative immunoprecipitation analyses that the level of the remaining mAChR subtypes was unaltered in the forebrain of M1-KO mice (19Hamilton S.E. Loose M.D. Qi M. Levey A.I. Hille B. McKnight G.S. Idzerda R.L. Nathanson N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13311-13316Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In addition to M1, M3 couples via the Gq/11-family and is present in significant amounts in the forebrain. To ensure that levels of M3 were not altered in cortical cultures, we carried out quantitative immunoprecipitation analyses with an anti-M3-specific antibody. The levels of M3were similar in cortical cultures prepared from WT (88 ± 17 fm/mg protein) and M1-KO (73 ± 18 fm/mg protein) mice (mean ± S.E.; n = 4). Metabotropic glutamate receptors also activate PLC via Gq/11 proteins. ACPD, a selective agonist for the metabotropic glutamate receptor, was used as a positive control to ensure that no general defect in G protein or PLC function existed. Similar levels of maximal activation by ACPD were obtained from WT and M1-KO cortical cultures (Fig. 2 B), indicating that the PLC signaling pathway downstream of the M1 mAChR is normal in M1-KO mice. Dual phosphorylation of the MAP kinases ERK1 and ERK2 on Thr-202 and Tyr-204 by MAPK kinase results in their activation; the detection of this dual phosphorylation using a dual-phospho-specific antibody is a widely used, sensitive method for the quantitation of the activation of MAPK in cultured cells and intact tissues (13Mills J.

We performed SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analysis using antibodies specific to the activated (dually phosphorylated) forms of ERK to measure stimulation of MAPK in primary cortical cultures from WT and M1-KO mice. In WT cultures the time course of treatment with the agonist oxo showed maximal levels of phospho-ERK within 5–10 min of agonist stimulation with a return to basal level by 30 min (Fig.3 A, a). This blot was stripped and reprobed with an antibody to the non-phosphorylated forms of ERK to ensure that differences in band intensity observed with phospho-ERK antibodies were not due to differences in protein loading (Fig.3 A, b). Immunoblot analyses comparing stimulation of WT and M1-KO cultures showed a robust activation of MAPK by oxo in WT cortical neurons (Fig. 3 B, a) and low to nonexistent activation in the M1-KO cultures (Fig. 3 C, a). Quantitative analysis of the immunoblots showed that WT cultures treated with oxo exhibited a mean stimulation of >300% above basal compared with 31% for the M1-KO cultures (n = 5 for each genotype; Fig.4). This activation is decreased by >75% when cultures are pretreated with the muscarinic-specific antagonist atropine, indicating that the effects of oxo are due to mAChR activation. PMA, a direct activator of PKC, induced a similar level of MAPK activation in WT (1050%) and M1-KO cultures (890%), respectively, indicating that the signaling pathway coupling stimulation of PKC to activation of the MAPK pathway is unaltered in M1-deficient neurons.Figure 4Quantitative analysis of mAChR-mediated MAPK activation in WT and M1-KO primary cortical cultures.Data represent the mean ± S.E. of five sets of cultures for each genotype, which were treated with PBS (10 min), oxo (5, 10 min), and atropine (5 min) followed by oxo (5 min), (atr/oxo), or PMA (10 min). Intensities of p42 phospho-MAPK bands on immunoblots were corrected for variations in protein loading using the normalized p42 band intensities from the anti-MAPK immunoblots and expressed as percent stimulation above basal.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) A growing number of studies show that functionally significant intermolecular interactions between muscarinic receptors can occur and that the third cytoplasmic loop is vital for these potential heteromolecular interactions. In the original construct designed to ablate the M1 gene product by homologous recombination, nucleotides coding for the N terminus and first transmembrane domain were deleted (19Hamilton S.E. Loose M.D. Qi M. Levey A.I. Hille B. McKnight G.S. Idzerda R.L. Nathanson N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13311-13316Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). However, the nucleotide sequence for >85% of the coding sequence, including the third cytoplasmic loop, is still present in these mice. To ensure that this portion of the receptor was not expressed, we performed immunoblot analyses using an M1-specific antibody raised against the third cytoplasmic loop of M1 (amino acids 233–332). Our results confirm that this key region of the receptor is significantly reduced in the forebrain of the M1-HET mice and is not detected in the M1-KO mice. Studies using recombinant M1 mAChR show that it couples via the Gq/11 protein family to the activation of PLC (24Shapiro R.A. Scherer N.M. Habecker B.A. Subers E.M. Nathanson N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18397-18403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Fukada K. Higashida H. Kubo T. Maeda A. Akiba I. Bujo H. Mishina M. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 335: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The M1 receptor constitutes approximately half of the total mAChR in adult mouse forebrain (19Hamilton S.E. Loose M.D. Qi M. Levey A.I. Hille B. McKnight G.S. Idzerda R.L. Nathanson N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13311-13316Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In primary cortical cultures from newborn M1-KO mice, agonist-stimulated PI hydrolysis was reduced by >60% compared with WT cultures. Thus, the M1receptor is the predominant mAChR subtype responsible for PLC activation in mouse cortical neurons. Despite the loss of M1, there was still significant carbachol-stimulated hydrolysis of PI. This is not unexpected because M3 also couples to PLC and is expressed to similar extents in WT and KO cortical cultures. The similar levels of PI hydrolysis obtained with the metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist ACPD in both WT and M1-KO cultures demonstrate that the G protein/PLC interactions are unaltered in the M1-KO mice. Although activation of mAChR in the brain has recently been shown to activate MAPK in rat cortical cultures (16Rosenblum K. Futter M. Jones M. Hulme E.C. Bliss T.V.P. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 977-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), most work demonstrating the relationship between mAChR and MAPK has been performed in established cell lines. In human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, carbachol was found to activate MAPK via M3 and a PKC-dependent pathway (31Offermanns S. Bombien E. Schultz G. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 545-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). When M1 is overexpressed in PC-12 cells, agonist-induced stimulation leads to MAPK activation (14Haring R. Fisher A. Marciano D. Pittel A. Kloog Y. Zuckerman A. Eshhar N. Heldman E. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 2094-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Although the predominant mAChR subtype in native PC-12 cells is M4 (∼95%), carbachol-induced MAPK activation was completely abolished with a highly selective M1 toxin (32Berkeley J.L. Levey A.I. J. Neurochem. 2000; 75: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, pretreatment with pertussis toxin, which uncouples members of the Gi/o family from their receptors, inhibited 70% of this agonist-induced activation, suggesting that either ectopic coupling of M1 to Gi/o proteins or signal transduction downstream of M4 also contributes to the muscarinic agonist activation in this neuronal cell line. MAPK activation in our WT primary cortical cultures ranged from 180 to 540% over basal values, similar to the values reported in rat cortical cultures (Fig. 3 A, Ref. 16Rosenblum K. Futter M. Jones M. Hulme E.C. Bliss T.V.P. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 977-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The maximal MAPK activation occurred in our WT mouse cultures within 5–10 min of agonist stimulation and rapidly returned to baseline, in contrast to the more persistent (30–60 min) activation reported for rat cultures (16Rosenblum K. Futter M. Jones M. Hulme E.C. Bliss T.V.P. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 977-985Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This may be due to differences in species or tissue culture conditions. In M1-KO cultures the range of MAPK stimulation by agonist was reduced to −70 to 120%. The average magnitude of stimulation decreased from 320% over basal in cultures from WT mice to 31% in the cultures from M1-KO mice. Thus M1 is the mAChR responsible for coupling to ERK activation in our primary cortical neuron culture system. The M3 receptor is present in similar amounts in our WT and KO cultures and most likely accounts for the agonist-induced PLC activation remaining in the M1-KO cultures. The much greater impairment in MAPK activation compared with PLC activation observed in the M1-KO cultures suggests that the M3 receptor, although still able to evoke significant activation of PLC, is relatively ineffective in mediating activation of MAPK in these neuronal cultures. PMA-induced activation of MAPK was similar in WT and M1-KO cultures indicating that signaling downstream of PKC is unaltered in mice lacking M1mAChR. In summary, these results show that there are significant defects in mAChR-mediated activation of PLC and MAPK in the forebrains of mice lacking the M1 receptor. Both the M1 and M3 receptors couple to members of the Gq-family of G proteins, although it is not known if there are subtle differences in the specificity of the two receptors for either α or βγ subunits; the results here suggest that the signaling pathways activated by the two receptors in cortical neurons appear to be different. The M1-KO mice will be useful in determining the PKC-dependent and PKC-independent pathways by which mAChR mediate secretion of soluble amyloid precursor protein. In addition, these mice should be useful in determining the relationship between M1 mAChR, MAPK activation, long-term potentiation, and learning and memory. Indeed, preliminary data indicate that mice lacking the M1 mAChR exhibit defects in the consolidation of hippocampus-dependent learning and show a deficit in long term potentiation (33Anagnostaras S.G.

To elucidate the mechanism of triplex-induced recombination, we have examined the ability of intermolecular triplexes to provoke recombination within plasmid substrates in human cell-free extracts. An assay for reversion of a point mutation in the supFG1 gene in the plasmid pSupFG1/G144C was established in which recombination in the extracts was detected upon transformation into indicator bacteria. A bifunctional oligonucleotide containing a 30-nucleotide TFO domain linked to a 40-nucleotide donor domain was found to mediate gene correction in vitro at a frequency of 46 × 10−5, at least 20-fold above background and over 4-fold greater than the donor segment alone. Physical linkage of the TFO to the donor was unnecessary, as co-mixture of separate TFO and donor segments also yielded elevated gene correction frequencies. When the recombination and repair proteins HsRad51 and XPA were depleted from the extracts using specific antibodies, the triplex-induced recombination was diminished, but was either partially or completely restored upon supplementation with the purified HsRad51 or XPA proteins, respectively. These results establish that triplex-induced, intermolecular recombination between plasmid targets and short fragments of homologous DNA can be detected in human cell extracts and that this process is dependent on both XPA and HsRad51.

Triplex formation, by itself, can be mutagenic, and evidence suggests that the nucleotide excision repair (NER) and transcription-coupled repair pathways may play a role in the triplex-induced mutagenesis (8Wang G. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Science. 1996; 271: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In previous work, we found that triple helix-directed psoralen cross-links could stimulate recombination in a plasmid substrate containing two tandem copies of the supFG1 reporter gene (9Faruqi A.F. Seidman M.M. Segal D.J. Carroll D. Glazer P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6820-6828Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Subsequent work established that triplex formation, even in the absence of covalent DNA damage, could stimulate recombination between repeated sequences, an effect that was absent in cells deficient in the NER factor, XPA (10Faruqi A.F. Datta H.J. Carroll D. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 990-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Recent work has extended these findings to the demonstration of TFO-induced recombination at a chromosomal locus containing two tandem copies of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene, following direct intranuclear microinjection of the oligonucleotides (11Luo Z. Macris M.A. Faruqi A.F. Glazer P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9003-9008Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Based on the ability of TFOs to mediate specific molecular recognition of a DNA target site within a cellular genome and on the observation that triplex formation can stimulate recombination, we also tested a series of bifunctional oligonucleotides consisting of a TFO designed to bind to bp 167–196 of the supFG1 reporter gene coupled to a short (40 nt) segment of DNA homologous to bp 121–160 of the gene. Such a hybrid molecule, designated a tethered donor-TFO (TD-TFO), was found to mediate recombination with the supFG1 gene present in an SV40-based episomal vector in monkey cells at frequencies in the range of 0.1–1% (Ref. 23Chan P.P.

This result is consistent with studies demonstrating that bifunctional oligonucleotides can mediate both triplex formation and strand invasion on plasmid substrates in vitro (24Gamper H.B. Hou Y.M.

In the present study, we have used a plasmid-based assay to investigate triple helix-induced recombination in human cell-free extracts. We find that triple helix formation can stimulate recombination between a plasmid and short homologous fragments in vitro. Stimulation was observed whether or not the donor fragment was directly linked to the TFO. Recombination was reduced in the absence of the TFO as well as when the TFO was substituted with a non-triplex-forming, scrambled sequence oligonucleotide. To probe the mechanism of the induced recombination, the roles of the NER damage recognition factor, XPA (26Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar), and the human recombinase, HsRad51 (27Gupta R.C. Bazemore L.R. Golub E.I. Radding C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), were directly tested by experimental manipulation of the respective protein levels in the extracts, either via immunodepletion with specific antibodies or supplementation with purified proteins. We report here that both XPA and HsRad51 are required for triple helix-induced recombination, and that increased HsRad51 levels can boost the efficiency of the reaction. The shuttle vector plasmid pSupFG1/G144C, containing a supFG1 gene with an inactivating G:C to C:G point mutation at position 144, was described previously (23Chan P.P. Lin M. Faruqi A.F. Powell J. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11541-11548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX) and purified by either gel electrophoresis or high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC), followed by Centricon-3 filtration in distilled water (Amicon, Beverly, MA). The oligonucleotides consisted primarily of phosphodiester linkages but were modified at the 3′ end to resist exonuclease activity by the inclusion of phosphorothioate linkages at the terminal three residues. In the TD-TFO molecule (designated A−AG30), the linker segment between the donor fragment and the TFO domain consisted of the sequence 9TT9TT9, in which 9 indicates a 9-atom polyethylene glycol linker (Spacer 9, Glen Research, Sterling, VA). The specific TFO, designated AG30, has the sequence 5′-AGGAAGGGGGGGGTGGTGGGGGAGGGGGAG-3′ and is designed to bind as a third strand to bp 167–176 of the supFG1 gene. The donor domain (A) consists of a 40-nt synthetic single-stranded DNA fragment homologous to positions 121–160 of the supFG1 gene (5′-AGGGAGCAGACTCTAAATCTGCCGTCATCGACTTCGAAGG-3′). The scrambled sequence oligonucleotide, SCR30, has the same base composition as AG30 but differs at 12 positions: 5′-GGAGGAGTGGAGGGGAGTGAGGGGGGGGGG-3′. Construction of E. coli SY302lacZ125(Am) recA56 hsdR2::Tn10 trp-49 has been described previously (28Glazer P.M. Sarkar S.N. Chisholm G.E. Summers W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were maintained and grown by the National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN) and were obtained as cell pellets for extract preparation. HsRad51 protein was purified fromE. coli DH10B (Life Technologies, Inc.) carrying plasmid pEG932. Purification consisted of chromatography through Q Sepharose, Bio-Gel-http, Mono-Q, and native DNA-cellulose. Other purification details have been reported previously (29Haaf T. Golub E.I. Reddy G. Radding C.M. Ward D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2298-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). Purification was documented by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, yielding a single visualized band of 37 kDa following the DNA-cellulose purification step. Purified HsRad51 protein was injected into rabbits to produce high affinity polyclonal antibodies specific to the HsRad51 protein (29Haaf T. Golub E.I. Reddy G. Radding C.M. Ward D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2298-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). XPA protein was produced using an Escherichia coliexpression vector (obtained from R. Wood) containing the human XPA cDNA sequence, along with an N-terminal 6-histidine tag, in the pET-15b plasmid (Novagen, Madison, WI). The protein was expressed in anE. coli expression strain, BL21(DE3) pLysS, as described by Jones and Wood (30Jones C.J. Wood R.D. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12096-12104Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Following expression, XPA was purified using immobilized metal-affinity chromatography (Talon resin;CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) under native conditions. Fractions were eluted with a buffer containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 mm imidazole. Western analysis was used to determine specificity using antibodies to the 6-His tag. Coomassie staining was used to determine purity. To further confirm that the expressed and purified protein was the correct species and present as soluble monomers in solution, XPA protein was subjected to both mass spectrometry and HPLC size exclusion chromatography/laser light scattering analysis. The results revealed a monodispersed peak at a molecular mass of 36.8 kDa, indicating a monomer of the correct size. Rabbits were immunized with the purified XPA protein (100 μg/injection) to produce high affinity antibodies specific to XPA. HeLa whole cell extract was prepared as described previously (28Glazer P.M. Sarkar S.N. Chisholm G.E. Summers W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, HeLa cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 0.01m Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmDTT, followed by lysis using a Dounce homogenizer. The lysate was diluted in four packed cell volumes of 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.01 m MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 25% sucrose, 50% glycerol, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma catalog no. P8340). One packed cell volume of saturated (NH4)2SO4 (0.33 g/ml of solution) was added and then neutralized by 1 n NaOH, followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 0.025 m HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.1m KCl, 0.012 m MgCl2, 0.05 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, 17% glycerol and was dialyzed in the same buffer for 8–12 h. The sample was quick frozen in liquid N2 and stored at −80 °C. The preparation typically contained 15–20 mg of protein/ml. Reactions consisted of 3 μg of pSupFG1/G144C plasmid DNA, 3 μg each of selected oligonucleotides (TFO, donor fragment, or both), 60 mmNaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 3 mm KCl, 12 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm each dNTPs, 2.5 mm creatine phosphate, 1 μg of creatine phosphokinase, 12 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm spermidine, 2% glycerol, 0.2 mm DTT, and 15–20 μl of cell-free extract in a 50-μl total reaction volume. After incubating 2 h at 30 °C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of 25 μm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, and 20 μg of proteinase K. After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the plasmid DNA was isolated by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation and dissolved in 10 μl of H2O. 1 μl of the resulting sample was used to transform E. coli SY302 by electroporation, as described (28Glazer P.M. Sarkar S.N. Chisholm G.E. Summers W.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), followed by growth of the cells on indicator plates for genetic analysis of supFG1 gene function as described previously (19Wang G. Levy D.D. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1759-1768Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-HsRad51 or anti-XPA sera were adjusted to 1× Tris-buffered saline (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH-7.5, 100 mm NaCl) and then incubated with pre-swollen Protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with Tris-buffered saline buffer and incubated with 50 μl of HeLa cell extract for 2 h on ice with gentle rotation. The supernatant (HsRad51- or XPA-depleted extract) was recovered by centrifugation and subsequently examined by Western blot and used in the in vitro recombination assay. After incubating the cell extract with HsRad51 antibody-Protein A-Sepharose beads, the beads were centrifuged and washed twice with 10 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.2. Then one bead volume of 100 mmglycine, pH 2.5, and 3.5 m MgCl2 was added and kept at 4 °C. After 1 h, the sample was centrifuged and the supernatant was immediately dialyzed against a buffer containing 20 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 100 mm KCl. The supernatant was directly used to supplement the depleted extracts for the recombination assay without freezing. The substrate for triplex-targeted recombination was the plasmid vector pSupFG1/G144C, containing a mutated version of the supFG1 amber suppressor tRNA gene,supFG1-144, which has an inactivating G:C to C:G mutation at bp 144. The function of this gene can be readily assayed in indicator bacteria carrying an amber stop codon in the lacZ gene, and so supFG1-144 is a useful reporter of recombination events that revert the gene to the functional sequence. ThesupFG1-144 gene also contains a 30-bp, G-rich site at the 3′ end of the gene to which the G-rich 30-mer TFO (AG30) can bind to form a triple helix in the anti-parallel motif (Fig.1). In a strategy to promote targeted recombination, we designed a TD-TFO molecule (A−AG30) in which the AG30 TFO is tethered to a donor DNA fragment homologous to a region of the supFG1-144 target gene via a mixed sequence linker (Fig. 1) (23Chan P.P. Lin M. Faruqi A.F. Powell J. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11541-11548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This arrangement facilitates target site recognition via triple helix formation while at the same time positioning the donor fragment for possible recombination and information transfer. This strategy also is intended to exploit the ability of a triple helix, itself, to provoke DNA repair, potentially increasing the probability of recombination with the homologous donor DNA. In the bifunctional A−AG30 molecule, the donor fragment, A, consists of a single-strand of length 40 synthesized to be homologous to positions 121–160 of the supFG1-144 gene except at position 144, where the sequence matches that of the functionalsupFG1 gene. In previous work, we demonstrated the occurrence of triplex-induced recombination upon transfection of A−AG30 into monkey COS cells already carrying the pSupFG1/G144C vector as an episomal, SV40-replicon-based target (23Chan P.P. Lin M. Faruqi A.F. Powell J. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11541-11548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To investigate the mechanism of triplex-induced recombination, in the present work we have tested the ability of triplex formation to promote recombination within human cell-free extracts. Selected oligonucleotides were incubated with the target pSupFG1/G144C vector in HeLa whole cell extracts supplemented with nucleotides and ATP. Following a 2-h incubation, the plasmid vector DNA was isolated and used to transform recA, lacZ(Amber) indicatorE. coli to score for supFG1 gene function (Fig.2). The results show that the bifunctional oligonucleotide, A−AG30, was active in the extracts and produced supFG1-144 gene reversion at a frequency of 45 × 10−5. Note that this effect occurred in the extract and was not mediated by recombination in the indicator bacteria because, without incubation in the extract, no recombinant products were observed upon transformation of the A−AG30 sample into bacteria. The A donor fragment was also somewhat active, as co-mixture of A plus the pSupFG1/G144C plasmid led to a low level of supFG1reversion, consistent with the ability of short fragments of DNA to mediate recombination and marker rescue (31Campbell C.R. Keown W. Lowe L. Kirschling D. Kucherlapati R. New Biol. 1989; 1: 223-227PubMed Google Scholar, 32Goncz K.K. Gruenert D.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 133: 85-99PubMed Google Scholar, 33Lin F.L. Sperle K.M. Sternberg N.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 129-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the effect of A−AG30 was 4-fold higher than that of A alone, demonstrating the influence of the TFO domain and providing direct evidence for triplex-induced recombination in vitro. By itself, however, the TFO domain produced minimal reversion over background, indicating the need for the sequence information provided by the A donor fragment. Interestingly, the sample in which AG30 and the A donor oligonucleotide were not linked but were simply co-mixed as separate molecules together with the plasmid substrate also produced an increased level of recombination, at a frequency of 40 × 10−5, almost as high as that produced by the linked A−AG30. This result provides further evidence that a TFO can stimulate recombination between a donor fragment and a target locus. In addition, because the donor fragment in this case is separate from the TFO, the result specifically demonstrates a role for the TFO in stimulating recombination that is distinct from its ability to deliver a tethered donor fragment to the target site. In another sample tested, the A donor was linked to an oligonucleotide segment designated SCR30, consisting of the same base composition as AG30 but a scrambled sequence creating 12 mismatches. SCR30 does not bind to the supFG1 gene and so does not form a triplex. It also has no homology to the target gene. Linkage of SCR30 to the donor fragment was found to actually inhibit recombination relative to the donor fragment alone. The results above establish that triplex-induced recombination can be reconstituted in HeLa cell extracts in vitro. By using this in vitro system, we sought to determine the role(s) of selected recombination and repair proteins in the pathway of triplex-induced recombination. HsRAD51 is a human recA homolog that functions in homologous recombination and has been shown to mediate DNA pairing and strand exchange reactions (34Baumann P. West S.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 247-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). To test the role of HsRAD51 protein in this homologous gene conversion, we used a polyclonal rabbit anti-HsRad51 antibody to deplete HsRad51 protein from the cell extract. Successful depletion of HsRad51 from the extract was confirmed by Western blot (Fig. 3). The depleted extract was tested for the ability to support triplex-induced recombination (Table I), both in the case of the linked A−AG30 bifunctional molecule and in the case of the co-mixed separate A and AG30 sample. Immunodepletion of HsRad51 was found to substantially reduce the frequency of recombinants in both cases. Control samples demonstrated that Protein A-Sepharose, in the absence of the HsRad51 polyclonal antibody, had no effect.Table IEffect of HsRad51 depletion on triplex-induced recombination in cell-free extractsOligonucleotideExtract treatmentBlue colonies/totalReversion frequency× 10−5NoneStandard0 /110,0000A−AG30No extract0 /95,0000A−AG30Standard53 /99,00054A−AG30Protein A-Sepharose45 /93,00048A−AG30HsRad51 antibody9 /110,0008A+AG30Standard42 /105,00040A+AG30Protein A-Sepharose36 /96,00038A+AG30HsRad51 antibody9 /99,0009The results represent the combined data from three independent experiments. Open table in a new tab The results represent the combined data from three independent experiments. Next, we tested the extent to which the triplex-induced recombination in the HsRad51-depleted extracts could be restored by the addition of purified, recombinant HsRad51 protein. Increasing amounts of HsRad51 protein were added to the depleted extracts, and the recombination assay was carried out (TableII). Even after the addition of a large amount of HsRAD51 (up to 5 μg), only a portion of the triplex-induced recombination activity was recovered. We hypothesized that the lack of complementation by purified HsRad51 might reflect the removal from the immunodepleted extracts of other factors physically associated with HsRad51. To test this, we supplemented the immunodepleted extracts with re-solubilized HsRad51 immunoprecipitate (Table II). Addition of the solubilized immunoprecipitate to the depleted extracts was found to almost completely restore the recombination activity, indicating that HsRad51 immunodepletion removes more than HsRad51 alone and that HsRad51 supplementation, by itself, cannot compensate for the loss of the other factors. This result is not surprising in light of emerging evidence that the recombination complex in human cells consists of multiple factors, including Rad52, Rad54, XRCC2, and XRCC3, as well as members of the RAD51 family, including Rad51B/Rad51L1, Rad51C/Rad51L2, and Rad51D/Rad51L3 (35Thacker J.

Increasing amounts of HsRAD51 (from 250 ng to 2 μg) were added to non-depleted whole cell extracts, and triplex-induced recombination was measured (Table III). Both in the case of the linked donor fragment and TFO (A−AG30) and the unlinked donor plus TFO (A+AG30), additional HsRad51 was found to increase the frequency of the triplex-induced recombinants. In the samples supplemented with amounts of HsRad51 in the lower range, there was a minimal effect. However, at higher levels of supplementation, increased yields of recombinants were seen. Hence, even though HsRad51, by itself, cannot fully complement the activity of the immunodepleted extracts, it can provide increased activity to otherwise complete whole cell extracts.Table IIIEffect of HsRad51 supplementation on triplex-induced recombination in cell-free extractsOligonucleotideExtract treatmentBlue colonies/totalReversion frequency×10−5NoneStandard0 /93,0000A−AG30No extract0 /87,0000A−AG30Standard54 /110,00049A−AG30Plus 250 ng of HsRad5143 /95,00045A−AG30Plus 500 ng of HsRad5155 /98,00056A−AG30Plus 1 μg of HsRad5179 /105,00075A−AG30Plus 2 μg of HsRad51103 /97,000106A+AG30No extract0 /93,0000A+AG30Standard39 /105,00037A+AG30Plus 500 ng of HsRad5137 /110,00034A+AG30Plus 1 μg of HsRad5154 /114,00047A+AG30Plus 2 μg of HsRad5176 /102,00075The results represent the combined data from three independent experiments. Open table in a new tab The results represent the combined data from three independent experiments. In previous work studying TFO-induced mutagenesis and recombination within SV40 vectors in human cells, we had obtained genetic evidence that the ability of triplex formation to stimulate DNA metabolism is dependent on the activity of the NER pathway (8Wang G. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Science. 1996; 271: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 10Faruqi A.F. Datta H.J. Carroll D. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 990-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To obtain direct biochemical evidence in support of this proposed mechanism, we tested the requirement for the NER damage recognition factor, XPA (26Sancar A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 43-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar), in the triplex-induced recombination in the HeLa cell extracts. A rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against recombinant human XPA protein produced in E. coli and was found to recognize a single protein in human cells of the expected size (data not shown). Using this antibody, XPA was removed from the extracts by immunoprecipitation. Depletion of XPA was confirmed by Western blot analysis of the residual samples (Fig.4). Depletion of XPA from the extracts was found to substantially reduce the frequency of TFO-induced recombination, whether or not the TFO was covalently linked to the donor fragment (Table IV). With both the A−AG30 and the A+AG30 samples, the depletion of XPA reduced the frequency of recombinants to that mediated by the donor fragment alone (Table I). Hence, the ability of a triple helix to stimulate recombination depends on the XPA protein. This result supports the hypothesis that the NER pathway can recognize a triple helix as a “lesion,” thereby provoking DNA metabolism that can lead to recombination or mutation.Table IVEffect of XPA depletion on triplex-induced recombination in cell-free extractsOligonucleotideExtract treatmentBlue colonies/totalReversion frequency× 10−5NoneStandard0 /209,0000A−AG30No extract0 /213,0000A−AG30Standard96 /219,00044A−AG30Protein A-Sepharose45 /114,00039A−AG30XPA antibody18 /214,0008A−AG30XPA antibody + 75 ng of XPA27 /112,00024A−AG30XPA antibody + 150 ng of XPA42 /114,00037A−AG30XPA antibody + 300 ng of XPA45 /118,00038A+AG30Standard46 /118,00039A+AG30Protein A-Sepharose39 /111,00035A+AG30XPA antibody12 /115,00010The results represent the combined data from three independent experiments.

The results show that increasing amounts of XPA protein provide functional complementation in the depleted extracts. These results establish a direct role for XPA in mediating the ability of a triple helix to stimulate recombination. The work reported here establishes that triplex-induced recombination can be detected in human cell-free extracts. A 30-mer TFO that binds with high affinity to a portion of the supFG1reporter gene within the pSupFG1/G144C vector was found to stimulate recombination between the vector and a 40-nt donor fragment. Recombination was induced both when the donor fragment was linked to the TFO and when it was present as a separate, unlinked molecule. The stimulation was determined to occur in the extracts and not in the indicator bacteria because no recombinants were observed unless the samples were incubated in the extracts. The donor fragment, by itself, was able to participate in recombination with the plasmid in the extracts, consistent with previous studies that have detected intermolecular recombination in similar mammalian cell extracts (37Kucherlapati R.S. Ayares D. Hanneken A. Noonan K. Rauth S. Spencer J.M. Wallace L. Moore P.D. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1984; 49: 191-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the present work establishes that such intermolecular recombination can be stimulated by third strand binding to one of the molecules. Establishment of TFO-induced recombination allowed testing of the role of selected factors in the process. Immunodepletion of HsRad51, a human recombinase homologous to recA (34Baumann P. West S.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 247-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar), from the extract reduced the yield of induced recombinants, but purified HsRad51 did not fully compensate for the immunodepletion. When the immunoprecipitate was re-solubilized and used to supplement the depleted extracts, the induced recombination activity was restored. These results suggest that the immunoprecipitate contains factors in addition to HsRad51 that are essential for the reaction. Such factors could include HsRad51-associated proteins that are proposed to play a role in homologous recombination, such as HsRad51a, HsRad51b, HsRad52, HsRad54, XRCC2, and XRCC3 (35Thacker J. Trends Genet. 1999; 15: 166-168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar, 36Sung P. Trujillo K.M. Van Komen S. Mutat. Res. 2000; 451: 257-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the addition of extra HsRad51 to the non-depleted extracts produced an increased frequency of recombinants, suggesting that HsRad51, itself, plays a critical role in the process. This result is consistent with the observation that overexpressed HsRad51 can provide a modest increase in the frequency of recombination in reporter gene substrates in mammalian cells (38Yanez R.J. Porter A.C. Gene Ther. 1999; 6: 1282-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The NER damage recognition factor, XPA, was also found to play an essential role in the triplex-induced recombination, as no induced recombinants were seen in the extracts after XPA immunodepletion. Supplementation of the induced extracts with recombinant XPA protein restored the induced recombination activity. This result not only is consistent with previous work showing that triplex-induced mutagenesis and recombination are substantially reduced in human mutant cell lines deficient in XPA (8Wang G. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Science. 1996; 271: 802-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 10Faruqi A.F. Datta H.J. Carroll D. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 990-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), it also demonstrates directly that XPA is required for the process. Taken together, the data support a model in which the oligonucleotide-mediated triple helix is recognized by XPA, thereby initiating repair activity that can create recombinogenic intermediates. Such intermediates may either be correctly repaired, repaired with incorporation of mutation in an error-prone manner, or, if homologous DNA is present, serve as substrates for repair by a HsRad51-dependent pathway of homologous recombination. In the extracts, the TFO was found to sensitize the plasmid to recombination either with a linked donor fragment or with an unlinked fragment, at approximately the same frequency. This ability of the TFO to stimulate recombination between the target site and an unlinked fragment is in contrast to a previous study examining TFO-induced recombination in COS cells, in which the linked TD-TFO molecule was found to be 4-fold more active than the mixture of the unlinked molecules (23Chan P.P. Lin M. Faruqi A.F. Powell J. Seidman M.M. Glazer P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11541-11548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In that study, the pSupFG1/G144C vector was pre-transfected into COS cells, and the cells were transfected the next day with the oligonucleotides. Two days later, the vector DNA was isolated for analysis in indicator bacteria. We interpret this difference between the previous cell study and the present work to suggest that, in the in vitro reactions, the TFO and donor fragment are present in adequate local concentrations whether or not they are linked together covalently. Hence, in the extracts, the ability of the TFO to deliver a linked donor fragment to the target site and place it in juxtaposition with the region of homology is not as important in promoting recombination as is the ability of the triplex to provoke DNA metabolism. In contrast, in the cell experiments, both properties of the TFO appear to be needed, although it remains to be determined whether the need for linkage of the donor to the TFO in cells can be overcome by increasing the efficiency of donor fragment transfection. If so, it would allow a gene correction strategy in which a TFO could be used in combination with larger donor fragments, greater than those that can be synthesized in continuity with the TFO. This would be advantageous, since previous studies examining recombination between episomal or chromosomal targets and transfected DNAs in mammalian cells have consistently shown that fragments in the range of 500 bp or larger produce higher levels of recombination than do short fragments in the size range used here (31Campbell C.R. Keown W. Lowe L. Kirschling D. Kucherlapati R. New Biol. 1989; 1: 223-227PubMed Google Scholar, 32Goncz K.K. Gruenert D.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 133: 85-99PubMed Google Scholar, 33Lin F.L.

Overall, the work reported here demonstrates that triplex-induced recombination can be detected in human cell free extracts, and it provides insight into the underlying mechanism by identifying critical roles for HsRad51 and XPA. The results suggest a pathway of triplex-induced recombination that depends on NER and on homologous recombinational repair of NER-generated intermediates. The ability to reconstitute TFO-induced recombination in vitro should serve as a basis for further elucidation of the manner in which triplex formation can provoke DNA metabolism, and may thereby guide refinements in strategies to use TFOs to promote targeted genetic changes in human cells.

In the present study, we show that long-chain fatty acids (e.g. oleic acid, elaidic acid, and cis- and trans-parinaric acids) inhibit gelatinase A as well as gelatinase B with Ki values in the micromolar range but had only weak inhibitory effect on collagenase-1 (MMP-1), as assessed using synthetic or natural substrates. The inhibition of gelatinases depended on fatty acid chain length (with C18 > C16, C14, and C10), and the presence of unsaturations increased their inhibitory capacity on both types of gelatinase. Ex vivoexperiments on human skin tissue sections have shown that micromolar concentrations of a long-chain unsaturated fatty acid (elaidic acid) protect collagen and elastin fibers against degradation by gelatinases A and B, respectively. In order to understand why gelatinases are more susceptible than collagenase-1 to inhibition by long-chain fatty acids, the possible role of the fibronectin-like domain (a domain unique to gelatinases) in binding inhibitory fatty acids was investigated. Affinity and kinetic studies with a recombinant fibronectin-like domain of gelatinase A and with a recombinant mutant of gelatinase A from which this domain had been deleted pointed to an interaction of long-chain fatty acids with the fibronectin-like domain of the protease. Surface plasmon resonance studies on the interaction of long-chain fatty acids with the three individual type II modules of the fibronectin-like domain of gelatinase A revealed that the first type II module is primarily responsible for binding these compounds.

Most of them are secreted as inactive proenzymes and are then extra- or pericellularly activated by other MMPs or serine proteinases (5Nagase H. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 151-160PubMed Google Scholar). Their catalytic activities are strictly controlled by endogenous specific inhibitors designated as tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) (6Brew K. Dinakarpandian D. Nagase H. Biochim.

MMPs are multidomain enzymes containing propeptide, catalytic and, except matrilysin (MMP-7), MMP-23, and endometase/matrilysin-2 (MMP-26), hemopexin-like domains. Gelatinase A (MMP-2) and gelatinase B (MMP-9) contain in addition three tandem copies of a 58-amino acid fibronectin type II (FN-II) module (11Collier I.E. Wilhelm S.M. Eisen A.Z. Marmer B.L.

We report here an in vitroinvestigation showing that fatty acids, depending on their chain length and degree of unsaturation, inhibit gelatinases A and B with similar efficiency but only have low inhibitory capacity toward collagenase-1. We conclude that interaction between FN-II domain and unsaturated fatty acids leads to gelatinase inhibition because of the following: (i) oleic acid displayed markedly weaker inhibitory capacity toward gelatinase A deleted in FN-II modules; (ii) fatty acids bound avidly to the first FN-II module; and (iii) this module totally prevented the oleic acid-mediated inhibition of full-length gelatinase A. The physiological relevance of our findings was substantiated by ex vivo experiments on human skin tissue sections demonstrating that C18-unsaturated fatty acid efficiently impeded the collagenolytic and elastolytic activities of gelatinases A and B, respectively. Human recombinant progelatinases A and B and natural procollagenase-1 were purchased from Calbiochem. The recombinant pro-ΔVal-191—Gln-364 gelatinase A (pro-ΔFN-II gelatinase A or truncated progelatinase A), corresponding to progelatinase A with FN-II domains deleted (15Murphy G. Nguyen Q.

Murphy (University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK). Human recombinant TIMP-2 was a gift from Prof. Y. A. DeClerck (Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA). Acid-soluble type I collagen was extracted and purified from guinea pig skin as described previously (26Eeckhout Y. Delaissé J.M. Vaes G. Biochem. J. 1986; 239: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Recombinant proteins coll 1, coll 2, coll 3, and coll 123 containing different segments of the gelatin-binding site of human gelatinase A were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by gelatin-Sepharose 4B chromatography as described previously (14Banyai L.

Human foreskins from healthy young children (10 months to 10 years old) were obtained on parental consent during surgical operations and kept frozen at −80 °C. Serial sections of 8 μm thickness were prepared with a cryostat microtome at −20 °C. The free acid forms of decanoic acid (capric acid, 10:0), tetradecanoic acid (myristic acid, 14:0),cis-9-tetradecenoic acid (myristoleic acid, c9–14:1), hexadecanoic acid (palmitic acid, 16:0), cis-9-hexadecenoic acid (palmitoleic acid, c9–16:1), octadecanoic acid (stearic acid, 18:0), cis-9-octadecenoic acid (oleic acid, c9–18:1), andtrans-9-octadecenoic acid (elaidic acid, t9–18:1), and an alcohol analogue of oleic acid were purchased from Sigma. Thecis-9, trans-11, trans-13,cis-15-octadecatetraenoic acid (cis-parinaric acid, c9, t11, t13, c15–18:4), and all-trans-9, -11, -13, -15- octadecatetraenoic acid (trans-parinaric acid, all-t9, 11, 13, 15–18:4) were from Molecular Probes (Interchim, Montluçon, France). The hydroxamate derivative of oleic acid was prepared as described previously (24Emonard H. Marcq V. Mirand C. Hornebeck W. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 878: 647-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The quenched fluorescent substrate Mca-PLGL(Dpa)-AR-NH2 was from Bachem (Voisins-le-Bretonneux, France). Full-length and ΔFN-II progelatinases A were fully activated by incubating the proenzymes in 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 1 mm p-aminophenylmercuric acetate (APMA) for 18 h at 4 °C. Active gelatinase B and collagenase-1 were obtained using 2 mm APMA in Tris buffer at 37 °C for 1 h. Full activation of each enzyme was assessed by gelatin zymography or Western blots. Each enzyme was further active site-titrated using a standard preparation of TIMP-2 (28Murphy G. Willenbrock F. Method Enzymol. 1995; 248: 496-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). The inhibitory effect of fatty acids (from C10 to C18, either saturated or cis- ortrans-unsaturated) against gelatinase A (full-length or FN-II-deleted forms), gelatinase B, or collagenase-1 was analyzed using the fluorescent quenched substrate Mca-PLGL-(Dpa)-AR-NH2. Two hundred picomolar of each MMP species were preincubated for 15 min at 22 °C with 0–40 μm fatty acid in a 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mmNaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2. The assays were initiated by adding 2 μm Mca-PLGL-(Dpa)-AR-NH2. The final concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) used to dissolve fatty acid and fluorogenic substrate never exceeded 1% (v/v). The reaction was allowed to proceed at 22 °C for 20 min (gelatinase A), 60 min (gelatinase B), or 180 min (collagenase 1) and then was stopped by adding 10 mm EDTA. Under these experimental conditions, MMPs generated a similar intensity of fluorescence, allowing the comparison of the inhibition results. The effect of substitution of the carboxylic end by alcohol or hydroxamate group on the inhibitory potency of oleic acid against gelatinase A was similarly evaluated. The rate of substrate cleavage was measured in quadruplicate for each fatty acid or derivative concentration examined, using a Perkin Elmer LS 50B spectrofluorimeter with excitation and emission wavelengths of 325 and 387 nm, respectively. Less than 5% of the substrate was hydrolyzed during the rate measurements. Addition of fatty acid after the digestion of fluorogenic substrate had no effect on the fluorescent signal. Nonlinear regression analysis with the Grafit computer software (R. J. Leatherbarrow, Erithacus Software) allowed us to calculate the best estimates of the equilibrium dissociation constant of the enzyme-inhibitor complex or inhibition constant Ki, using the integrated Equation 1(29Bieth J.G. Method Enzymol. 1995; 248: 59-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), vivo=1−([E]o+[I]o+Ki)−{([E]o+[I]o+Ki)2−4[E]o[I]o}1/22[E]oEquation 1 where vi is the rate of substrate hydrolysis in the presence of inhibitor; vo is the rate in its absence; and [E]o and [I]o are the initial concentrations of enzyme and inhibitor, respectively. The inhibitory effect of oleic, elaidic, or stearic acids (0–40 μm) was further evaluated against gelatinase A, using a natural substrate, i.e. heat-denatured [3H]collagen type I. Briefly, 1.6 nmgelatinase A was first mixed with 0–40 μm fatty acid in a 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl and 10 mm CaCl2 for 15 min at 22 °C before incubation with radiolabeled natural substrate for 20 h at 37 °C (30Marbaix E. Donnez J. Courtoy P.J. Eeckhout Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11789-11793Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of fatty acids for gelatinase A were determined using the Grafit computer software. For each enzyme, the mode of inhibition of oleic acid was analyzed with the Grafit computer software, using the graphical methods of either Dixon or Cornish-Bowden (see Ref. 31Knight C.G. Barrett A.J. Salvesen G. Proteinase Inhibitors. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1986: 23-51Google Scholar). The trimodular protein coll 123 contains the entire fibronectin-related part of human gelatinase A (27Banyai L. Tordai H. Patthy L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12003-12008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Oleic acid and stearic acid-coll 123 interaction studies were performed using a BIAcore X system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Sensor chip HPA (BIAcore AB) was used for all experiments. A flow rate of 5 μl/min was used, and the instrument was thermostated at 25 °C. The surface of sensor chip was washed for 5 min with 40 mm n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside in water. Fatty acid (20 μl of an 8 mm solution in Me2SO) was then injected. The process of spontaneous fatty acid adsorption on the sensor chip was monitored. When the sensorgram reading began to level out, the flow rate was briefly increased to 100 μl/min to suppress the multiple lipid layers formed on the sensor chip surface. An additional injection of 10 mm NaOH (10 μl) was performed to regenerate the sensor chip and to reach a stable base line. To assess the extent of coverage of the sensor chip surface by both fatty acids, we injected 10 μl of 0.1 g/liter bovine serum albumin in 4.4 mm Na2HPO4 buffer, pH 7.4, 130 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl. The amount of bovine serum albumin bound to the sensor chip surface corresponded to 43 resonance units, a value much lower than that typically obtained with a surface fully coated with dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine or palmitoyloleoyl phosphatidylcholine. Binding experiments with coll 123 were performed in the same buffer. After each cycle, the sensor chip was regenerated by injecting 10 μl of 10 mm NaOH. These regeneration conditions allowed to restore the base-line level observed before each injection. The coll 123 binding kinetics were measured at six different concentrations of analyte, i.e. 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 μm. We similarly studied oleic acid interactions with the isolated FN-II modules of gelatinase A, i.e. coll 1, coll 2, or coll 3. The binding curves were analyzed using the nonlinear data fitting software BIAevaluation to obtain the rate constants of association (ka) and dissociation (kd) and the equilibrium constants of dissociation (KD). Oleic acid (5 μm) and gelatinase A (200 pm) were preincubated for 15 min at 22 °C with molar fold excess (1–100-fold in comparison with gelatinase A) of the trimodular protein coll 123 or the single module proteins coll 1, coll 2, or coll 3, and residual enzymatic activity was measured with Mca-PLGL- (Dpa)-AR-NH2 (2 μm), as described above. Whatever the concentration used, coll 123, coll 1, coll 2, or coll 3 did not exhibit inhibitory effect against gelatinase A. A set of three skin tissue sections was laid on a coated polylysine microscopic slide (Bio-Rad) and overlaid with 10 μl of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl and 5 mmCaCl2 (assay buffer) or the same buffer containing 50 nm APMA-activated gelatinase A or gelatinase B. The preparations were then incubated for 4 h at 37 °C in a moist chamber. After incubation, the tissue sections were rinsed and stained with polyphenolic catechin-fuschin and red sirius for staining of elastic and collagen fibers, respectively (32Berton A. Godeau G. Emonard H. Baba K. Bellon P. Hornebeck W. Bellon G. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Elastic fibers appeared in deep blue-black, and the background was poorly stained and collagen fibers were revealed in red-orange. This allowed a further quantitative estimation of the area (AA) and volume (VV) fractions occupied by these fibers. For elaidic acid inhibition assays, gelatinase A or gelatinase B were first incubated with 0, 1, or 10 μm fatty acid for 15 min at 22 °C; alternatively, tissue sections were preincubated with 1 or 10 μm elaidic acid or Me2SO-containing assay buffer as negative control for 30 min at 37 °C before adding gelatinase A or gelatinase B. The microscopic slides were then observed under a Zeiss standard 14 microscope equipped with CF 126 PHR video camera, and computerized analyses of the elastic and collagenic fibers were carried out as described previously (32Berton A. Godeau G. Emonard H. Baba K. Bellon P. Hornebeck W. Bellon G. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Briefly, three skin serial sections were used for each assay, and 10 fields of dimensions 0.7 × 0.7 mm were analyzed for each skin tissue section. Black and white images generated by the video camera were converted into 256 different gray levels using a Sophretec NUM 600 image memory, transferred to a BFM 186 microcomputer, and finally analyzed using a software for mathematical morphology. The area fraction (AA) occupied by the elastic and collagen fibers was automatically calculated. The area fraction represents the surface of fibers as a function of the tissue area analyzed. For the elastic fibers, the volume fraction (VV) was also determined and corresponds to AA × k, wherek <1 represents the Weibel correction factor (k = d/d + t, with dand t, elastic fiber diameter, and section thickness, respectively, in μm). The average diameter of the elastic fibers was obtained semiautomatically using skin tissue sections treated or not and a calibrated slide. The effect of fatty acids varying in chain length and degree of unsaturation was first evaluated on gelatinases A and B using the fluorogenic Mca-PLGL-(Dpa)-AR-NH2 substrate. TableI shows that both enzymes were inhibited with a similar efficiency by fatty acids. Inhibition depended on their alkyl chain length (with C18 > C16, C14, and C10). The presence of unsaturations in fatty acids increased the inhibition of both gelatinases. Furthermore, gelatinases A and B inhibition did not depend on the cis-trans configuration of double bond(s) since oleic acid and elaidic acid, its trans-counterpart, displayed similar Ki values; also, no difference was observed between cis- and trans-parinaric acids. Such polyunsaturated fatty acids were, however, more efficient as inhibitors toward gelatinase B versus gelatinase A (TableI).Table IInhibition of gelatinases A and B activities by fatty acidsLong-chain fatty acidsTrivial namesKiGelatinase AGelatinase Bμm10:0CapricNI aNI, no or less than 10% of inhibition, at [I]o = 40 μm.NI14:0MyristicNINIc9–14:1MyristoleicNINI16:0PalmiticNINIc9–16:1Palmitoleic29.3 ± 5.534.3 ± 4.918:0Stearic35.2 ± 5.647.4 ± 7.7c9–18:1Oleic4.3 ± 0.46.4 ± 0.4t9–18:1Elaidic4.4 ± 0.35.8 ± 0.3c9, t11, t13, c15–18:4cis-Parinaric8.1 ± 1.20.8 ± 0.3All t9, 11, 13, 15–18:4trans-Parinaric5.7 ± 0.41.9 ± 0.6Fatty acids were first incubated with gelatinases A and B before adding fluorogenic substrate.

The equilibrium dissociation constantKi and its standard error were calculated by nonlinear regression analysis using Equation 1, and the given value corresponds to the best estimate obtained from one fit curve among three independent experiments; the S.D. between the three experiments is less than 15%. When they were tested against collagenase-1, only unsaturated fatty acids with 18 carbon atoms exhibited a low inhibitory effect, with aKi value equal to 59.6 ± 5.7 μmfor oleic acid. Contrary to data obtained with gelatinases, atrans-configuration of the unsaturation slightly improved collagenase-1 inhibition; 40 μm of oleic or elaidic acids inhibited by 30 and 40%, respectively, the degradation of fluorogenic substrate by collagenase-1. Changing carboxylic end group of oleic acid to hydroxamic group, a more potent bidentate ligand for catalytic zinc, did not dramatically improve gelatinase A inhibition, with the Ki value only decreasing from 4.3 ± 0.4 to 1.8 ± 0.2 μm(Fig. 1). Also, replacement of carboxylic group by an alcohol group, not considered as a zinc ligand, did not strikingly impair the inhibitory activity of oleic acid, with theKi value only rising from 4.3 ± 0.4 to 6.3 ± 0.3 μm (Fig. 1). Our data suggested that FN-II repeats, present in gelatinases A and B but absent in collagenase- 1, could represent selective targets for fatty acids. We therefore evaluated the inhibitory capacity of oleic, elaidic, and stearic acids against gelatinase A deleted in FN-II repeats. Fig.2 illustrated the weak inhibition of oleic and elaidic acids toward truncated gelatinase A; as shown above for collagenase-1, oleic acid was less efficient than itstrans-counterpart, elaidic acid, with Kivalues of 32.5 ± 3.0 and 12.3 ± 1.6 μm, respectively. Again, stearic acid did not inhibit truncated gelatinase A (Fig. 2). The mode of inhibition of each enzyme by oleic acid was evaluated. In both cases, Dixon plots (data not shown) were consistent with oleic acid acting as either competitive or mixed inhibitor, with Ki values graphically estimated to 1.6 and 26.3 μm for full-length and truncated gelatinases A, respectively. Cornish-Bowden plot allowed us to distinguish between these two possibilities (Fig. 3). The intersection of lines above the abscissa in the Cornish-Bowden plot was consistent with a mixed mode of inhibition of oleic acid against the full-length gelatinase A (Fig. 3 A), whereas it appeared to act as a weak competitive inhibitor toward truncated gelatinase A (Fig.3 B). Potential interactions between fatty acids and the gelatinase A FN-II repeats were studied by SPR analyses using a recombinant peptide corresponding to the three FN-II modules (coll 123) of gelatinase A and oleic or stearic acids. Fatty acids were linked to the surface of a sensor cell as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Solutions of coll 123 were allowed to bind to the immobilized oleic acid or stearic acids, and data were analyzed as a function of time. The results of typical binding assays are shown in Fig.4, A and B. The association rate constant (ka), dissociation rate constant (kd), and dissociation equilibrium constant (KD) of coll 123 for oleic acid or stearic acid were calculated from SPR analyses, using the nonlinear data fitting software BIAevaluation (Table II). Oleic and stearic acids bound coll 123, with KD of 41 ± 1 and 36.1 ± 2 μm, respectively. Furthermore, SPR analysis demonstrated that oleic acid interacted with the first FN-II module, coll 1, with a KD value of 62 ± 4 μm, close to that obtained with the entire FN-II domain, coll 123; on contrary, the second and third FN-II modules weakly bound oleic acid with dissociation constants of 210 ± 90 and 3900 ± 1400 μm, respectively.Table IIKinetic and equilibrium constants of FN-II repeats of gelatinase A with oleic or stearic acidsFatty acidskakdKDm−1s−1s−1μmOleic acid3.9 ± 0.1 × 10216.0 ± 0.3 × 10−341 ± 1Stearic acid6.1 ± 0.1 × 10222.0 ± 0.7 × 10−336.1 ± 2Binding of the trimodular protein coll 123 to oleic or stearic acids was monitored by SPR. Binding constants were calculated using the BIAcore evaluation software. The errors for the kaand kd rate constants are expressed as the standard deviation of the slope and the standard deviation of six analyte concentrations, respectively, from two separate experiments. The errors for the KD values represent the sum of the errors from the ka and kd values. Open table in a new tab Binding of the trimodular protein coll 123 to oleic or stearic acids was monitored by SPR. Binding constants were calculated using the BIAcore evaluation software. The errors for the kaand kd rate constants are expressed as the standard deviation of the slope and the standard deviation of six analyte concentrations, respectively, from two separate experiments. The errors for the KD values represent the sum of the errors from the ka and kd values. We next investigated whether the ability of oleic acid to bind FN-II modules was related to its gelatinase inhibitory capacity. Gelatinase A activity was measured in the presence of increasing concentrations of trimodular protein coll 123 and an oleic acid concentration producing 50% inhibition, i.e. 5 μm. Increasing concentrations of coll 123 relieved the inhibition of gelatinase A, and the inhibitory effect of oleic acid was totally abolished by a 100-fold molar excess of coll 123 (Fig.5 A). In the same way, we analyzed the effect of isolated FN-II modules, i.e. coll 1, coll 2, and coll 3, on gelatinase A inhibition by oleic acid. A 50-fold molar excess of coll 1 restored up to 95% gelatinase A activity in the presence of 5 μm oleic acid (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, only a slight or no restoration of gelatinase A activity was observed in the presence of coll 2 or coll 3. Denatured collagen (gelatin) represents physiological substrate for gelatinase A. We also evalua"

Here, we report the construction of mono-, di-, and tetrameric variants of the anti-tumor p185HER-2 single chain Fv fragment 4D5 by fusion of self-associating peptides to the carboxyl terminus. Dimeric miniantibodies with a synthetic helix-turn-helix domain and tetrameric ones with the multimerization domain of the human p53 protein were produced in functional form in the periplasm of Escherichia coli. We have directly compared these molecules and the single-chain Fv fragment in the targeting of SK-OV-3 xenografts. Tetramerization of the 4D5 antibody fragment resulted in increased serum persistence, significantly reduced off-rate, due to the avidity effect, both in surface plasmon resonance measurements on purified p185HER-2 and on SK-OV-3 cells. The99mtechnetium-tricarbonyl-labeled tetrameric 4D5-p53 miniantibody localized with the highest dose at the tumor and remained stably bound for at least 72 h. The highest total dose was 4.3% injected dose/g after 24 h, whereas the highest tumor-to-blood ratio was found to be 13.5:1 after 48 h, with a total dose of 3.2% injected dose/g. The tetramer shows no higher avidity than the dimer, presumably since the simultaneous binding to more than two antigen molecules on the surface of cells is not possible, and the improvement in performance over the dimer must at least be due in part to the molecular weight.

One of the current visions in the medical application of recombinant antibody technology (1Holliger P. Hoogenboom H. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 1015-1016Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) is the specific targeting and delivery of effector agents such as radioisotopes, toxins, or enzymes to tumors or other disease-related sites in the body. Unfortunately, recombinant antibody fragments have exhibited poor in vivotargeting efficiency, probably due to their fast clearance from the blood circulation resulting in low total dose accumulation (2Begent R.H. Verhaar M.J. Chester K.A. Casey J.L. Green A.J. Napier M.P. Hope-Stone L.D. Cushen N. Keep P.A. Johnson C.J. Hawkins R.E. Hilson A.J. Robson L. Nat.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 485-490PubMed Google Scholar, 4Rowlinson-Busza G. Tumor Targeting. 1996; 2: 37-48Google Scholar). The targeting efficacy of antibody fragments can be improved by the use of multimeric formats of antibody fragments with higher avidity and a molecular weight slightly above the renal filtration threshold (5Hudson P.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 548-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 6Plückthun A. Pack P. Immunotechnology. 1997; 3: 83-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 7Hu S. Shively L. Raubitschek A. Sherman M. Williams L.E. Wong J.Y. Shively J.E. Wu A.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3055-3061PubMed Google Scholar). This has first been shown in studies in which Fab and scFv1 fragments were multimerized by chemical linkage (8Werlen R.C. Lankinen M. Offord R.E. Schubiger P.A. Smith A. Rose K.

Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4026-4034PubMed Google Scholar). More efficient is the multimerization of antibody fragments by modification of the polypeptide sequence itself by recombinant DNA technology and the subsequent purification of the multimeric protein from the bacterial host. One strategy is to shorten the flexible peptide linker of scFv fragments to make it impossible to form monomers (5Hudson P.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1999; 11: 548-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 13Holliger P. Winter G. Cancer Immunol. Immunother. 1997; 45: 128-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The so-called “diabodies” have been shown to be stable under in vivoconditions and to enrich efficiently at xenografts (14Adams G.P. Schier R. McCall A.M. Crawford R.S. Wolf E.J. Weiner L.M. Marks J.D. Br. J. Cancer. 1998; 77: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 15Viti F. Tarli L. Giovannoni L. Zardi L. Neri D. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 347-352PubMed Google Scholar). Another strategy is the fusion of the homodimerization domain CH3 to the carboxyl terminus of the polypeptide chain. By using this approach in combination with a stabilizing intramolecular disulfide bridge for an anti-carcinoembryonic antigen scFv fragment, very promising tumor targeting data were reported (7Hu S. Shively L. Raubitschek A. Sherman M. Williams L.E. Wong J.Y. Shively J.E. Wu A.M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3055-3061PubMed Google Scholar). However, recombinant molecules that contain additional disulfide bridges are usually produced at lower yields in heterologous expression systems and are generally less convenient to handle (16Plückthun A. Krebber A. Krebber C. Horn U. Knüpfer U. Wenderoth R. Nieba L. Proba K. Riesenberg D. McCafferty J. Hoogenboom H.R. Chiswell D.J. Antibody Engineering, A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1996: 203-252Google Scholar). Instead of using whole protein domains self-associating peptides can be used as multimerization modules to form so-called miniantibodies (6Plückthun A. Pack P. Immunotechnology. 1997; 3: 83-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Here we report on the engineering and production of mono-, di-, and tetrameric variants of the anti-p185HER-2 scFv fragment 4D5 in the periplasm of Escherichia coli and their in vivo application for targeting xenografted SK-OV-3 tumors. The comparison of the various formats is expected to provide insight into the performance of such multimerized molecules for in vivotargeting purposes and serve as a proof of this concept under in vivo conditions. We demonstrate that the in vivostability of the tetrameric miniantibody is high enough to result in efficient tumor targeting and that such multimerized antibody fragments can be readily produced in the periplasm of E. coli (17Pack P.

The breast carcinoma cell line SK-BR-3 (HTB 30, ATCC, Rockville MD) and the ovarian carcinoma cell line SK-OV-3 (HTB 77, ECACC, Salisbury, Wilts, UK) were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium (Amimed BioConcept, Pillschwill, Switzerland), supplemented with 15% bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). For binding experiments the adherent cell lines were carefully detached by use of PBS containing 5 mm EDTA. No trypsin was used to avoid enzymatic cleavage of cell surface receptors. The purified recombinant antigen p185HER-2-ECD was a kind gift of Dr. Paul Carter (Genentech Inc., CA). The scFv fragment of the human anti-p185HER-2 antibody 4D5 was constructed (19Knappik A. Plückthun A. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 81-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) from the Fab fragment (20Carter P. Presta L. Gorman C.M. Ridgway J.B. Henner D. Wong W.L. Rowland A.M. Kotts C.

The 4D5-dhlx miniantibody construct was obtained by ligation of the EcoRI/HindIII fragment of the vector pKM30-dhlx-his (24Müller K.M. Arndt K.M. Plückthun A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 432: 45-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), containing the dhlx sequence and the His tag, into the expression vector pIG6, containing the scFv fragment 4D5 (25Ge L. Knappik A. Pack P. Freund C. Plückthun A. Borrebaeck C.A.K. Antibody Engineering. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 229-261Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence for the p53 tetramerization domain was isolated as an EcoRI/AscI fragment from the plasmid pACK9-9p53, 2P. Pack, unpublished data. which contains the p53 tetramerization domain (26Rheinnecker M. Hardt C. Ilag L.L. Kufer P. Gruber R. Hoess A. Lupas A. Rottenberger C. Plückthun A. Pack P. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 2989-2997PubMed Google Scholar). The construct 4D5-p53 was then obtained by substituting the dhlx domain in the 4D5-dhlx construct by the EcoRI/AscI fragment containing the p53 tetramerization domain. All constructs were expressed in the periplasm of E. coli using the expression vector pIG6 under the control of a lac promoter (25Ge L. Knappik A. Pack P. Freund C. Plückthun A. Borrebaeck C.A.K. Antibody Engineering. Oxford University Press, Oxford1995: 229-261Google Scholar). For large scale expression the constructs were transformed in the E. coli strain SB536 (27Bass S. Gu Q. Christen A. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1154-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and grown overnight. Twenty-five ml were then used for inoculation of 1 liter of 2YT medium containing 1% glucose and ampicillin (50 μg/ml) in a 5-liter baffled shake flask. The culture was grown at room temperature, and expression was induced with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 1 mm final concentration) for miniantibody production when it reached an A550 nm of 0.5. Expression was continued for 3–4 h at 24 °C until the culture reached a final A550 nm of 4–5. The harvested pellet was stored at −80 °C. Briefly, the monomeric scFv fragment 4D5 was purified as described earlier (22Willuda J. Honegger A. Waibel R. Schubiger P.A. Stahel R. Zangemeister-Wittke U. Plückthun A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5758-5767PubMed Google Scholar). For purification of the miniantibodies 4D5-dhlx and 4D5-p53, the pellet of a 1-liter expression culture was resuspended in 50 ml of buffer containing 100 mm Tris (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.01% Tween 20, DNase (1 mg/100 ml), RNase (1 mg/100 ml). The cell suspension was lysed in two cycles with a French pressure cell press (SLS Instruments Inc., Urbana, IL), and to clear the lysate, it was centrifuged for 30 min in an SS-34-rotor at 48,000 × g at 4 °C. The protein was purified by a combination of immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography and ion exchange chromatography. Immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography purification of the 4D5-dhlx and 4D5-p53 was performed with a Ni2+-iminodiacetic acid column on a BioCAD-system (PE Perseptive Biosystems). After loading of the lysate, the column was washed with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20 until the absorption reached the base line. The column was then washed with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.0), 1 m NaCl, 0.01% Tween 20 for 150 column volumes, followed by a further washing step with 80 mm imidazole, 20 mm Tris (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl for 40 column volumes. Proteins were then eluted with 500 mm imidazole (pH 7.0), 150 mm NaCl, and samples were collected in a fraction collector in tubes containing 100 mm Tris (pH 7.0), 8 mm EDTA for immediate 2-fold dilution. The collected sample was loaded on a HQ-Sepharose column (HQ 4.6/100) equilibrated with 2-fold diluted PBS. Impurities bound to the column, and the flow-through, containing the desired miniantibody, was collected and then dialyzed against PBS overnight at 4 °C, before it was concentrated to about 200–300 μg/ml by ultracentrifugation using Centricon micro-concentrators (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Analytical gel filtration with non-labeled antibody fragments was performed on a SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a Superose-12 column (PC3.2) equilibrated with degassed PBS containing 0.005% Tween 20. Thirty μl of the antibody fragments were injected at a concentration of 250 μg/ml. Analytical gel chromatography with radiolabeled antibody fragments was performed on a HiLoad system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Either a Superose-12 (HR 10/30) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or a Superdex-200 (HR 10/30) column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated in PBS containing 0.5% BSA, was used. For calibration of the Superose-12 column alcohol dehydrogenase (Mr 150,000), bovine serum albumin (Mr 66,000) and carbonic anhydrase (Mr 29,000) were used. The Superdex-200 column was calibrated with thyroglobulin (Mr 669,000), apoferritin (Mr 443,000), β-amylase (Mr 200,000), and alcohol-dehydrogenase (Mr 150,000). 99mTc labeling was carried out essentially as described before (23Waibel R. Alberto R. Willuda J. Finnern R. Schibli R. Stichelberger A. Egli A. Abram U. Mach J.P. Plückthun A. Schubiger P.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 897-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To label the various constructs (200 μg/ml) they were mixed with the same volume of freshly prepared99mTc-tricarbonyl (pH 6.8, 30 mCi to 1 Ci/ml) and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by removing the free99mTc using a Biospin-6 column (Bio-Rad) equilibrated with PBS containing 0.005% Tween 20. The eluted fractions were quantitated for incorporated radioactivity by gamma-scintillation counting. The immunoreactive fraction of the antibody constructs on cells was determined as described by Lindmo et al. (28Lindmo T. Boven E. Cuttitta F. Fedorko J. Bunn Jr., P.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 72: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar) and/or by gel filtration analysis. For the determination on cells, duplicate samples with increasing numbers of cells (0.5–10 × 106cells/ml) were incubated in suspension with constant amounts (1–5 ng) of radiolabeled antibody fragments for 1 h at 4 °C on a shaker. Nonspecific binding was determined on control samples of cells, preincubated with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled antibody fragments in PBS containing 0.5% BSA for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.5% BSA, and the bound radioactivity in the cell pellets was determined by gamma-scintillation counting (28Lindmo T. Boven E. Cuttitta F. Fedorko J. Bunn Jr., P.A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 72: 77-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (894) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the immunoreactivity of the antibodies was determined by a gel filtration shift assay. After radiolabeling the constructs were separated from free 99mTc-tricarbonyl by gel filtration on a Superdex-200 (HR 10/30) column, equilibrated with PBS containing 0.5% BSA, on a HiLoad system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fraction containing the radiolabeled antibody fragment was identified by gamma-scintillation counting of the eluted fractions, and 10–20 ng of the radiolabeled antibody fragment were then incubated with a 100-fold molar excess of recombinant antigen p185HER-2-ECD for 1 h at room temperature. After the binding equilibrium had been established, the sample was analyzed again on a second Superdex-200 (HR 10/30) column, and the eluted radioactivity in the collected fractions was monitored by gamma-scintillation counting and compared with the elution profile of the radiolabeled control antibody fragment not incubated with p185HER-2-ECD antigen. Immunoreactivity was then estimated from the percentage of radioactivity eluting at higher molecular weight, indicating the formation of complexes of antigen and active radiolabeled antibody fragment. The in vitro thermal and serum stability of the anti-p185HER-2-antibody fragments was estimated in a gel filtration assay. After incubation at nanomolar concentration in human serum at 37 °C for 20 h radiolabeled antibody fragments were analyzed on a Superdex-200 (HR 10/30) column equilibrated in PBS containing 0.5% BSA. The elution profile of the radioactivity was then compared with the elution profile of the radiolabeled control antibody fragment diluted in PBS (containing 0.5% BSA) and stored at 4 °C. The loss of the peak with the desired molecular weight over time was examined. A comparison of the dissociation kinetics of the various constructs was carried out by surface plasmon resonance by using a BIAcore instrument (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), as well as on p185HER-2-overexpressing SK-OV-3 cells. For the surface plasmon resonance measurements a CM5-Sepharose Chip (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was coated with 3000 RU p185HER-2-ECD antigen by amine chemistry. Antibody fragments were injected in a volume of 30 μl on the coated surface and for estimation of nonspecific binding on an uncoated reference surface. The antibody concentration was chosen such that the surface was not saturated, and binding was about 50% of the maximally reachable RU values. The sensorgrams were obtained at a flow rate of 30 μl/min, and dissociation was followed for 6000 s. Data were evaluated with the BIAevaluation (3.0) software (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Alternatively, dissociation of the miniantibodies was studied on cells overexpressing the p185HER-2 antigen. Duplicate samples of the radiolabeled 4D5 constructs were incubated with 0.5 × 106 SK-OV-3 cells suspended in 100 μl of PBS containing 0.5% BSA for 1 h at 4 °C. The cells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.5% BSA to remove initially unbound radioactivity and were then incubated at 37 °C on a shaker to start dissociation. Antibodies were used at non-saturating concentrations in which about 50% of maximum binding was reached (50% Bmax). After 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min, samples were taken and immediately washed three times with PBS containing 0.5% BSA to remove dissociated antibody fragments. When the last sample was taken, all samples were measured for the remaining radioactivity in a gamma-scintillation counter. For an estimation of nonspecifically bound radioactivity control samples were preincubated with a 100-fold excess of unlabeled antibody constructs for 1 h at 4 °C. The functional affinity of the99mTc-labeled anti-p185HER-2 antibody fragments on SK-OV-3 cells was determined by RIA. SK-OV-3-cells (0.5 × 106) were incubated with increasing amounts of the radiolabeled antibody fragments (50 pm to 30 nm) for 1 h at 4 °C, washed three times with PBS containing 0.5% BSA to remove unbound radioactivity, and measured for bound radioactivity in a gamma-scintillation counter. To correct for nonspecific binding, control samples were preincubated with 100-fold excess of unlabeled antibody fragments for 1 h at 4 °C. All measurements were performed in duplicate. The corrected radioactivity was plotted against the scFv fragment concentration, and the functional affinity was calculated from the fit of the data, assuming a simple 1:1 model with the approximate function y =ymax· × /(KD +x), where x is the concentration of radioligand (corrected for activity); y is the radioactivity attributable to specific binding; and ymax is its plateau value. Blood clearance studies were performed in 6–8-week-old female Balb/c mice. Biodistribution analysis was carried out in athymic CD1 nu/nu mice (Charles River, Germany). For blood clearance studies each mouse received intravenous injections of 5–10 μg of radiolabeled antibody fragments (90–130 μCi/mouse). Mice were sacrificed after 7.5, 15, 30, 60, 120, and 180 min, and blood, liver, and kidney samples were taken and measured for radioactivity in a gamma-scintillation counter. The percentage of the injected dose/g tissue (% ID/g) was calculated for each time point.t12α and t 12β were obtained from the analysis of the plot of the % ID/g of the blood values over time with a biphasic exponential function (GraphPad software). The serum stability of the multimeric miniantibodies in the circulation of Balb/c mice was examined by gel filtration of serum samples after administration of the radiolabeled constructs. Each mouse received intravenous injection of 100 μl of PBS containing 2–5 μg of radiolabeled antibody fragments. After 30 min mice were sacrificed, and blood samples were taken and centrifuged for 5 min at maximum speed in an Eppendorf lab centrifuge at room temperature. Then 150 μl of the serum was analyzed by gel filtration in PBS containing 0.5% BSA using a Superose-12 (HR10/30) column on a HiLoad system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The eluted fractions were monitored in a gamma-scintillation counter for serum radioactivity. All data were normalized to the same amount of injected radioactivity (10 × 106 cpm). Tumor localization studies of the 99mTc-labeled 4D5 antibody fragments were performed in nude mice xenografted with SK-OV-3 tumors. Tumors were raised subcutaneously at the lateral flanks by injections of 107 SK-OV-3 carcinoma cells in a total volume of 100 μl. Ten days after tumor inoculation, when tumors reached a size of 20–50 mm3, each mouse received intravenous injections of 10–15 μg of radiolabeled miniantibody (1–2 mCi/mouse). The anti-fluorescein binding scFv fragment FITC-E2 (29Vaughan T.J. Williams A.J. Pritchard K. Osbourn J.K. Pope A.R. Earnshaw J.C. McCafferty J. Hodits R.A. Wilton J. Johnson K.S. Nat.

Mice were killed at 15 and 30 min and 1, 4, 24, 48, and 72 h after injection, and organs were removed, and radioactivity was measured in a gamma-scintillation counter. The areas under the curve (AUC) values were calculated with the GraphPad Software version 3.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego CA). The synthetic helix-turn-helix peptide dhlx (30O'Shea E.K.

For the unmodified scFv fragment 4D5, we routinely obtained 1–2 mg/liter E. coliculture, whereas for the 4D5-dhlx and 4D5-p53 constructs 500 and ∼250 μg/liter were obtained, respectively. Upon concentration by ultrafiltration, concentrations of 2–3 mg/ml could be obtained for the scFv 4D5, 400–500 μg/ml for the 4D5-dhlx miniantibody, and about 200–250 μg/ml for the 4D5-p53 tetrameric miniantibody.Figure 2A, purity of mono-, di-, and tetrameric anti-p185HER-2 antibody fragments.

The unmodified scFv fragment 4D5 eluted at a retention volume of 1.56 ml as expected for a monomeric species. The 4D5-dhlx construct eluted at a volume of 1.43 ml, which corresponds to a calculated Mr of about 60,000 consistent with a dimer. The p53-multimerized species eluted at 1.32 ml, which corresponds to a calculated Mr of about 130,000 consistent with a tetramer. In no cases were higher molecular weight aggregates detected, and the elution of single symmetric peaks indicated the homogeneity of the protein preparations. All 4D5 constructs could be labeled with99mTc-tricarbonyl, which forms an extremely stable complex with clusters of histidine residues (23Waibel R. Alberto R. Willuda J. Finnern R. Schibli R. Stichelberger A. Egli A. Abram U. Mach J.P. Plückthun A. Schubiger P.A. Nat. Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 897-901Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). No precipitate was observed in the reaction mixture. For the monomeric 4D5 about 70% of the free99mTcCO (which is present in molar trace amounts) was incorporated when the protein was used at 1 mg/ml. For the dimeric 4D5-dhlx usually 30% incorporation was obtained with an initial protein concentration of 500 μg/ml. To compare the data between the proteins of this study, all antibody fragments were used at concentrations of 250 μg/ml, which was the highest concentration achievable for the 4D5-p53 construct, and the routinely obtained incorporation yields of 99mTc-tricarbonyl were between 10 and 20% of the radionuclide (100–200 mCi/ml). To ensure the conservation of the binding activity of the multimers after radiolabeling, we measured the immunoreactivity of the constructs. In binding assays on SK-OV-3 cells we determined the immunoreactive fractions to be about 80–90% for the monomeric 4D5 scFv, above 95% for the 4D5-dhlx dimer, and 80% for the 4D5-p53 tetramer (Table I).Table IImmunoreactivity of multimerized anti-p185HER-2-antibody fragmentsAntibody fragmentImmunoreactive fraction on cells1-aImmunoreactive fraction means binding to the antigen with at least one binding site.Complex formation with p185HER-2-ECD1-aImmunoreactive fraction means binding to the antigen with at least one binding site. determined by gel filtration%4D5-scFv80–90954D5-dhlx>95954D5-p538055–601-a Immunoreactive fraction means binding to the antigen with at least one binding site.

To determine the mechanisms by which UCP3 plays a role in regulating glucose metabolism, we expressed human UCP3 in L6 myotubes by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer and in H9C2cardiomyoblasts by stable transfection with a tetracycline-repressibleUCP3 construct. Expression of UCP3 in L6 myotubes increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake 2-fold and cell surface GLUT4 2.3-fold, thereby reaching maximally insulin-stimulated levels in control myotubes. Wortmannin, LY 294002, or the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein abolished the effect of UCP3 on glucose uptake, and wortmannin inhibited UCP3-induced GLUT4 cell surface recruitment. UCP3 overexpression increased phosphotyrosine-associated phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity 2.2-fold compared with control cells (p < 0.05). UCP3 overexpression increased lactate release 1.5- to 2-fold above control cells, indicating increased glucose metabolism. In H9C2 cardiomyoblasts stably transfected withUCP3 under control of a tetracycline-repressible promotor, removal of doxycycline resulted in detectable levels of UCP3 at 12 h and 2.2-fold induction at 7 days compared with 12 h. In parallel, glucose transport increased 1.3- and 2-fold at 12 h and 7 days, respectively, and the stimulation was inhibited by wortmannin or genistein. p85 association with membranes was increased 5.5-fold and phosphotyrosine-associated PI3K activity 3.8-fold. In contrast, overexpression of UCP3 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes did not alter glucose uptake, suggesting tissue-specific effects of human UCP3. Thus, UCP3 stimulates glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation to the cell surface in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells by activating a PI3K dependent pathway.

Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) 1The abbreviations used are:UCPuncoupling proteinPI3Kphosphoinositide 3-kinaseDNPdinitrophenolIRS-1insulin receptor substrate-1IRinsulin receptorBATbrown adipose tissueROSreactive oxygen speciesGLUTglucose transporterpfuplaque-forming unit(s)DMEMDulbecco's modified Eagle's mediumMAPKmitogen-activated protein kinaseJNKc-Jun N-terminal kinaseα-MEMα minimal essential medium are mitochondrial inner membrane proteins proposed to be central to the regulation of energy expenditure. Energy expenditure is composed of the resting metabolic rate, physical activity, and thermogenesis and can be increased by energy dissipation due to futile metabolic processes. Uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), the first uncoupling protein to be identified, is selectively expressed in brown adipose tissue (BAT), a major site of thermogenesis in rodents. UCP1 uncouples mitochondrial respiration from ATP synthesis by dissipating the transmembrane proton gradient, releasing energy as heat (1Jacobsson A. Stadler U. Glotzer M.A. Kozak L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 16250-16254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of UCP1 in energy expenditure in adult humans is less clear, because little BAT is present. Recently UCP2 and UCP3 were identified with 59 and 57% amino acid identity to UCP1, respectively (2Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Levi-Meyrueis C. Bouillaud F. Seldin M.F.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 408: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). UCP3, unlike UCP1 and UCP2, exists as short and long form transcripts (5Solanes G. Vidal-Puig A. Grujic D. Flier J.S. Lowell B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25433-25436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The long form of UCP3 was shown to be an uncoupling protein, because it increases O2 consumption and decreases the mitochondrial electrochemical potential when expressed in yeast or C2C12 myoblasts (2Fleury C. Neverova M. Collins S. Raimbault S. Champigny O. Levi-Meyrueis C. Bouillaud F. Seldin M.F. Surwit R.S. Ricquier D. Warden C.H. Nat.

Reconstitution of UCPs into liposomes showed that UCP2 and UCP3, like UCP1, mediate electrophoretic proton flux across lipid bilayers (8Jaburek M. Varecha M. Gimeno R.E. Dembski M. Jezek P. Zhang M.

Chem. 1999; 274: 26003-26007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), providing further evidence that these UCPs are functional uncoupling proteins.UCP2 is expressed in many tissues, whereas UCP3is expressed selectively in skeletal muscle in humans and primarily in skeletal muscle and brown adipocytes in rodents with low levels in white adipose tissue (3Vidal-Puig A.

In humans, resting skeletal muscle metabolism is a significant determinant of whole body energy expenditure and therefore is thought to play a role in body weight regulation (10Zurlo F. Larson K. Bogardus C. Ravussin E. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1423-1427Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Consistent with this, UCP3 gene expression correlates negatively with body mass index and positively with sleeping metabolic rate in Pima Indians (11Schrauwen P. Xia J. Bogardus C. Pratley R.E. Ravussin E. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 146-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a polymorphism in theUCP3 gene is associated with reduced basal fat oxidation rate and increased respiratory quotient in a specific African American population (12Argyropoulos G. Brown A.M. Willi S.M. Zhu J. He Y. Reitman M. Gevao S.M. Spruill I. Garvey W.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 102: 1345-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Overexpressing either UCP3 orUCP1 at very high levels in muscle of transgenic mice results in increased energy expenditure, resistance to diet-induced obesity, and increased glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (13Clapham J.C.

However, recent studies with UCP3 knockout mice show that, although endogenous UCP3 has uncoupling activity in skeletal muscle mitochondria, the absence of UCP3 produces no apparent abnormality in energy balance or glucose homeostasis (15Vidal-Puig A.J. Grujic D. Zhang C.Y. Hagen T. Boss O. Ido Y. Szczepanik A. Wade J. Mootha V. Cortright R. Muoio D.M. Lowell B.B. J. Biol.

Interestingly, mitochondria lacking UCP3 produce more reactive oxygen species (ROS) (15Vidal-Puig A.J. Grujic D. Zhang C.Y. Hagen T. Boss O. Ido Y. Szczepanik A. Wade J. Mootha V. Cortright R. Muoio D.M. Lowell B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16258-16266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Thus, the role of UCP3 in energy homeostasis and fuel metabolism remains controversial.Increased energy expenditure due to increased uncoupling activity is expected to deplete energy stores and therefore raise fuel needs. Because skeletal muscle is an important site for the regulation of glucose disposal, increased uncoupling activity due to overexpression of a UCP could result in increased glucose metabolism. In the muscle-specific UCP1 and UCP3 overexpressing mice, fasting glucose is indeed lower and in epitrochlearis muscle fromUCP1 overexpressing mice the basal glucose uptake rate tends to be increased (13Clapham J.C. Arch J.R. Chapman H. Haynes A. Lister C. Moore G.B. Piercy V. Carter S.A. Lehner I. Smith S.A. Beeley L.J. Godden R.J. Herrity N. Skehel M. Changani K.K. Hockings P.D. Reid D.G. Squires S.M.

Ho Han D. Coleman T. Holloszy J.O. Semenkovich C.F. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 1115-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). In humans, a positive correlation betweenUCP3 mRNA and glucose utilization in lean NIDDM patients was recently demonstrated (17Krook A. Digby J. O'Rahilly S. Zierath J.R. Wallberg-Henriksson H. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1528-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, these data are not yet conclusive, because no such relationship was found in nondiabetic controls (17Krook A. Digby J. O'Rahilly S. Zierath J.R. Wallberg-Henriksson H. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1528-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar).Glucose transport is rate-limiting for glucose metabolism. In L6 myotubes glucose uptake is stimulated 2- to 3-fold by insulin (18Bashan N. Burdett E. Guma A. Sargeant R. Tumiati L. Liu Z. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C430-C440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment with the strong uncoupling agent dinitrophenol (DNP) for 30 min stimulates glucose uptake to the level of insulin in these cells, and longer treatment stimulates above insulin-stimulated levels (19Khayat Z.A. Tsakiridis T. Ueyama A. Somwar R. Ebina Y. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1487-C1497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,20Khayat Z.A. McCall A.L. Klip A. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Long term treatment (18 h) with DNP also increases lactate levels in L6 myotubes, because the cells cannot use oxidative phosphorylation and therefore rely mainly on glycolysis to maintain ATP (18Bashan N. Burdett E. Guma A. Sargeant R. Tumiati L. Liu Z. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C430-C440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings indicate that L6 myotubes can adapt to situations of higher energy demand such as uncoupling by increasing their glucose uptake and metabolism. Furthermore, L6 cells express low endogenous levels of UCP3, which can be metabolically regulated (21Nagase I. Yoshida S. Canas X. Irie Y. Kimura K. Yoshida T. Saito M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 461: 319-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Therefore, they are a good model to study the effects of UCP3.L6 muscle cells express the glucose transporters GLUT1, GLUT3, and GLUT4 (22Tsakiridis T. Vranic M. Klip A. Biochem.

Glucose uptake can be increased by inducing the expression of one or more of these glucose transporters (GLUTs) or by eliciting their redistribution from intracellular vesicles to the cell surface. Insulin rapidly stimulates glucose transport in L6 cells as well as in primary muscle and adipocytes by eliciting the translocation of GLUTs to the cell surface via a signaling cascade requiring phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) (22Tsakiridis T. Vranic M. Klip A. Biochem. J. 1995; 309: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). PI3K consists of an 85-kDa regulatory (p85) and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (p110). The p85 subunit is normally a cytosolic protein, but in response to insulin it translocates in association with IRS proteins to specific intracellular membranes and to the actin cytoskeleton (23Khayat Z.A. Tong P. Yaworsky K. Bloch R.J. Klip A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 279-290Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chemical inhibitors of PI3K or a dominant negative regulatory subunit of PI3K inhibit the insulin-induced increase in glucose transport and glucose transporter translocation (24Cheatham B.

Human UCP3 (long form) was overexpressed in rat L6 myotubes by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer and in H9C2 cardiomyoblasts by stable transfection with a tetracycline-repressible UCP3 construct. Overexpression of UCP3 stimulates glucose transport and GLUT4 recruitment to the cell surface to levels equivalent to the effect of insulin, and the UCP3 effects are inhibited by wortmannin, LY 294002, or genistein. Furthermore, PI3K activity and p85 translocation to membranes are increased in UCP3-overexpressing myotubes. Thus, UCP3 increases glucose transport and metabolism in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells by a PI3K-dependent mechanism.DISCUSSIONMitochondrial uncoupling proteins alter membrane potential and oxygen consumption and are proposed to play a major role in energy expenditure (40Schrauwen P. Walder K. Ravussin E. Obes. Res. 1999; 7: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Although UCP3 knockout mice appear to have normal glucose homeostasis (15Vidal-Puig A.J. Grujic D.

This indicates that UCP3 may affect muscle cell glucose metabolism, although little is known about the mechanism for this or the effects of increased UCP3 expression on intracellular signaling pathways. This study demonstrates that UCP3overexpression increases glucose transport in both cardiac and skeletal muscle cells. This effect results from increased recruitment of GLUT4 to the cell surface and is dependent on activation of PI3K.Most existing data on the role of uncoupling proteins in glucose utilization are correlative. Cold exposure stimulates glucose uptake in brown adipose tissue (BAT) of normal rats (41Vallerand A.L. Perusse F. Bukowiecki L.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: R1043-R1049PubMed Google Scholar). Because cold exposure activates UCP1 expression in BAT via the sympathetic nervous system, the effect on glucose transport may involve increased UCP1 activity, but this needs to be tested. Recently, Krook et al. (17Krook A. Digby J. O'Rahilly S. Zierath J.R. Wallberg-Henriksson H. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 1528-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) demonstrated a positive correlation betweenUCP3 mRNA and glucose utilization in lean NIDDM patients. Although no such relationship was found in nondiabetic controls, the data suggest a relationship between UCP3expression and glucose homeostasis at least under some conditions. Although glucose oxidation is normal in UCP3 knockout mice (15Vidal-Puig A.J. Grujic D. Zhang C.Y. Hagen T. Boss O. Ido Y. Szczepanik A. Wade J. Mootha V. Cortright R. Muoio D.M. Lowell B.B. J. Biol.

Further studies are needed to determine whether glucose utilization is normal under all metabolic conditions.Cellular stressors such as contraction/exercise, hypoxia, osmotic shock, and heat shock (19Khayat Z.A.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3564-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), which increase energy demands stimulate glucose transport. Most of these manipulations result in decreased ATP levels, and the concomitant increase in glucose transport has been interpreted to be a response to generate ATP via glycolysis. With strong uncoupling agents such as DNP, the increase in glucose transport persists even though ATP levels are rapidly restored (18Bashan N. Burdett E. Guma A. Sargeant R. Tumiati L. Liu Z. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C430-C440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to our current findings, stimulation of glucose transport in all of these stress situations, including short term, high dose DNP treatment, does not depend on signal transduction via the PI3K pathway (19Khayat Z.A. Tsakiridis T. Ueyama A. Somwar R. Ebina Y. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: C1487-C1497Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Yeh J.I. Gulve E.A. Rameh L. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol.

Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3564-3570Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, high dose DNP has much stronger uncoupling effects than UCP3 when overexpressed at the levels in our study (20Khayat Z.A. McCall A.L. Klip A. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 713-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Consistent with this is the shorter cell survival in glucose-free media of cells treated with high dose DNP compared with cells overexpressing UCP3 (Fig. 2). DNP treatment at a 10 to 50 times lower concentration for as long as the UCP3 overexpression lasted (62 h) also increased glucose uptake, but this effect was inhibited by wortmannin. The levels of lactate release from UCP3-overexpressing cells and from low dose, long term DNP-treated cells were comparable, suggesting the same degree of uncoupling. Thus, not only UCP3, but other methods of mild, long term uncoupling activate a signaling cascade through PI3K.We found a 2.2-fold increase in PI3K activity in L6 cell lysates and a 3.8-fold increase in membranes of H9C2 cells. Most likely this difference reflects the high association of activated PI3K with membranes. The mechanism by which increased uncoupling activity could increase PI3K activity is of interest. UCP2 and UCP3 play a role in the regulation of mitochondrial ROS generation (15Vidal-Puig A.J. Grujic D. Zhang C.Y. Hagen T. Boss O. Ido Y. Szczepanik A. Wade J. Mootha V. Cortright R. Muoio D.M.

The effect of UCP3 could be mediated by altering levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). A growing body of evidence suggests a potential role for oxygen-derived radicals such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anions as intracellular signaling molecules (for review see Ref. 44Finkel T. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1999; 65: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial metabolism of pyruvate activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which is triggered by increased release of mitochondrial H2O2, leading to inhibition of glycogen synthase 3β and activation of glycogen synthase (45Nemoto S. Takeda K., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Finkel T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 7311-7318Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Interestingly, stimulation of vascular smooth muscle cells with platelet-derived growth factor results in increased ROS. When ROSs are rapidly removed with scavenger compounds, the tyrosine phosphorylation effects of platelet-derived growth factor are abolished (46Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Irani K. Finkel T. Science. 1995; 270: 296-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (2301) Google Scholar). In addition, the reactive oxygen species hydrogen peroxide alters both basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport in myotubes and adipocytes (47Kozlovsky N. Rudich A. Potashnik R. Bashan N. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1997; 23: 859-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 48Kono T. Robinson F.W. Blevins T.L. Ezaki O. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 10595-10602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). These studies support the possibility that ROSs alter signaling pathways involving tyrosine phosphorylation and PI3K.Our findings raise the possibility that PI3K may be activated in association with mitochondrial function in muscle. This may be indirect via other cellular signals, which are activated by mitochondrial uncoupling such as ROSs, or via direct physical interaction of PI3K at the site of mitochondria. No data are published about the presence or activation of PI3K activity in mitochondria. However, PI3K is stimulated in nuclei of leukemia cells during granulocyte differentiation (50Marchisio M. Bertagnolo V. Colamussi M.L. Capitani S. Neri L.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate binding protein localizes in the nucleus in brain (51Tanaka K. Horiguchi K. Yoshida T. Takeda M. Fujisawa H. Takeuchi K. Umeda M. Kato S. Ihara S. Nagata S. Fukui Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3919-3922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and hydrogen peroxide treatment leads to PI3K translocation to the nucleus where its activity is enhanced. Further studies will determine whether this occurs in mitochondria.In the current study, we found that the inhibitor of tyrosine phosphorylation, genistein, inhibited the stimulatory effect of UCP3 on glucose transport (Figs. 5 B and 9D). However, we did not detect any obvious increase in tyrosine phosphorylation by antiphosphotyrosine immunoblotting. It is likely that the level of phosphorylation change required for the degree of stimulation of phosphotyrosine-associated PI3K activity inUCP3-overexpressing L6 cells(Fig. 5 A) would be below the detection limit of Western blotting. The lack of effect on Akt is not surprising, given that we and others found a discordance between PI3K activity and Akt stimulation in other models (as reviewed in Ref. 37Kim Y.-B. Zhu J.-S. Zierath J.R. Shen H.-Q. Baron A.D. Kahn B.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 310-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).The effects of UCP3 on glucose transport appear to be tissue-specific, because they are seen in cardiac and skeletal muscle cells but not in adipocytes. This may result from the fact that adipocytes are already more uncoupled than muscle cells. Strong uncoupling with DNP treatment stimulates glucose transport to only ∼15% of the maximal effect of insulin in adipocytes, whereas it reaches the maximal effect of insulin in muscle cells (see “Results” and Ref. 18Bashan N. Burdett E. Guma A. Sargeant R. Tumiati L. Liu Z. Klip A. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C430-C440Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, adipocytes have the potential for greater glucose transport stimulation but uncoupling has minimal effect. Because in humans UCP3 is expressed selectively in muscle, we speculate that regulation of human UCP3 activity requires muscle-specific factors.In summary, these data demonstrate that UCP3 overexpression increases glucose transport and metabolism in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. Furthermore, these effects of UCP3 appear to involve GLUT4 translocation and are mediated by activation of PI3K, becauseUCP3 overexpression increases PI3K activity and the effect of UCP3 to stimulate glucos"

Blood. 1997; 89: 2413-2421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the C domains are homologous to the galactose lipid binding domain and to the regions within neuraminidase (13Pratt K.P. Shen B.W.

Factor VIII circulates as a divalent metal ion-dependent, noncovalent heterodimer resulting from proteolytic cleavage at the B/A3 junction that generates a heavy chain (A1-A2-B) and a light chain (A3-C1-C2). This procofactor form is cleaved by thrombin at Arg372-Ser373, Arg740-Ser741, and Arg1689-Ser1690 to yield factor VIIIa, a heterotrimer composed of A1, A2, and A3-C1-C2 subunits (14Lollar P.

Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The A1 and A3-C1-C2 subunits remain associated with a divalent metal ion-dependent linkage, whereas the A2 subunit is weakly associated with the A1 and A3-C1-C2 dimer (16Lollar P. Parker G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1688-1692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. Walker F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although intact factor VIIIa is required for maximal enhancement of factor IXa activity, recent results demonstrate that the isolated A2 subunit stimulates factor IXa activity by ∼100-fold (18Fay P.J. Koshibui K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Ca2+-dependent assembly of factor IXa and factor VIIIa on a suitable PL surface is essential for hemostasis since defects or deficiency in the proteins result in severe bleeding diatheses, namely hemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency) or hemophilia B (factor IX deficiency) (Ref. 12Pemberton S. Lindley P. Zaitsev V. Card G. Tuddenham E.G.D. Kemball-Cook G. Blood. 1997; 89: 2413-2421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; see the hemophilia A mutation data base and the Haemophilia B data base of point mutations and short additions and deletions, both available via the World Wide Web). In this assembly, the Ca2+-loaded form of the Gla domain of factor IXa binds to PL (21Freedman S.J. Blostein M.D. Baleja J.D. Jacobs M. Furie B.C. Furie B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 272: 22037-22045Google Scholar), whereas EGF1 3Although there is a considerable controversy as to the role of EGF1 domain in the interaction of factor IXa and factor VIIIa, at present it cannot be completely ruled out that this domain contains a direct interactive site for factor VIIIa (8Mertens K. Celie P.H.N. Kolkman J.A. Lenting P.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 82: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar)./EGF2 region(s) and the protease domain are thought to interact with the A3 and A2 subunits of factor VIIIa, respectively (18Fay P.J.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1935-1940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Factor VIIIa in this assembly anchors to the PL surface via its C2 domain (13Pratt K.P. Shen B.W. Takeshima K. Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Stoddard B.L. Nature. 1999; 402: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar), and binding of factor X to the IXa/VIIIa complex may be partly mediated through the A1 subunit of factor VIIIa (23Lapan K.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2082-2088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the IXa/VIIIa complex, residues 558–565 of the A2 subunit of factor VIIIa are thought to bind to the protease domain of factor IXa (24Fay P.J. Beattie T. Huggins C.F. Regan L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20522-20527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, helix 330–338 (c162–170) of the protease domain of factor IXa has been shown to bind to factor VIIIa (25Mathur A. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18477-18486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, whether or not helix 330–338 of factor IXa binds to the A2 subunit or more specifically to its 558–565 peptide region is not known. The present study is designed to address this issue. The kinetic, fluorescence, and inhibition data indicate that helix 330 (c162) of factor IXa most likely interacts with the 558–565 region of the A2 subunit. An interface model between the helix 330–338 of factor IXa and the A2 558–565 region was then constructed. Other spatially nearby residues in factor IXa as well as those in the A2 subunit that could contribute to the interface were noted. The role of these residues in this interaction is discussed. Benzoyl-Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg-p-nitroanilide (S-2222) was purchased from Helena Laboratories. Dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (dEGR-ck) was obtained from Calbiochem. Phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, recombinant hirudin, and fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) were obtained from Sigma. PL vesicles containing 75% phosphatidylcholine and 25% phosphatidylserine were prepared by the method of Husten et al. (26Husten E.J. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 12953-12966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and used for all experiments except for the fluorescence emission studies. For fluorescence experiments, PL vesicles comprised 40% phosphatidylcholine, 20% phosphatidylserine, and 40% phosphatidylethanolamine and were prepared using octyl glucoside as described (27Mimms L.T. Zampighi G. Nozaki Y. Tanford C. Reynolds J.A. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 833-840Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Recombinant factor VIII preparations (Kogenate®) were a gift from Drs. Lisa Regan and Jim Brown of Bayer Corp.. Purified recombinant factor VIII was also a generous gift from Debra Pittman of the Genetics Institute. Normal plasma factor IX (IXNP) and factor X were isolated as described (6Bajaj S.P. Birktoft J.J. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 96-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and factor Xa was prepared as outlined (28Bajaj S.P. Rapaport S.I. Prodanos C. Prep. Biochem. 1981; 11: 397-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Purified human factor XIa and α-thrombin were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South Bend, IN). A synthetic peptide corresponding to the A2 subunit residues 558–565 (Ser-Val-Asp-Gln-Arg-Gly-Asn-Gln) was obtained as described previously (18Fay P.J. Koshibui K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), and its concentration was determined by amino acid analysis. The Kogenate® concentrate was fractionated to separate factor VIII from albumin following S-Sepharose chromatography as outlined (29Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Huggins C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17861-17866Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Factor VIIIa was prepared from factor VIII using thrombin and subsequently purified using CM-Sepharose chromatography (30Curtis J.E. Helgerson S.L. Parker E.T. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6246-6251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the A2 subunit and A1/A3-C1-C2 dimer were separated by Mono S chromatography (15Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The A2 subunit was further purified using an anti-A2 immunoaffinity column (15Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The purified A2 subunit was essentially homogeneous (>95% pure), as judged by SDS-PAGE. For some experiments, proteins were concentrated using a Microcon concentrator (Millipore, 10-kDa cut-off). The concentration of the A2 subunit was determined by the Coomassie Blue dye binding method of Bradford (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Wild-type factor IX (IXWT), as well as mutants IXR333Q (a point mutant in which R333 is replaced by Gln), IXVIIhelix (a replacement mutant in which helix 330–338 (c162–170) is replaced by that of factor VII), and IXPCEGF1 (a replacement mutant in which EGF1 domain is replaced by that of protein C), were constructed, expressed, and purified as described previously (25Mathur A. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18477-18486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 32Zhong D. Smith K.J. Birktoft J.J. Bajaj S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Purified proteins were homogeneous on SDS-PAGE and contained normal Gla content (25Mathur A. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18477-18486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 32Zhong D. Smith K.J. Birktoft J.J. Bajaj S.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The buffer used was TBS, pH 7.5 (50 mmTris, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5), containing 5 mmCaCl2. SDS-PAGE analysis revealed full activation of each factor IX to factor IXa without degradation in the autolysis loop (34Mathur A. Zhong D. Sabharwal A.K. Smith K.J. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23418-23426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). dEGR-IXaWT and various dEGR-IXa mutant proteins free of dEGR-ck were obtained as described previously (34Mathur A. Zhong D. Sabharwal A.K. Smith K.J. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23418-23426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For these studies, each factor IX was activated with factor XIa/Ca2+ as described above. For factor X activation studies, the concentration of factor IXa was kept at 20 nm and the buffer used was TBS/BSA (TBS with 200 μg/ml BSA) containing 5 mm CaCl2. The concentrations of PL used were 10, 25, 50, and 100 μm in different sets of experiments. The concentration of factor X at each PL concentration ranged from 25 nm to 3 μm. The activations were carried out for 5–15 min, and the amount of factor Xa generated was measured by hydrolysis of S-2222 as described previously (25Mathur A. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18477-18486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 34Mathur A. Zhong D. Sabharwal A.K. Smith K.J. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23418-23426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The Km and kcatvalues were obtained using the program GraFit from Erithacus Software. The EC50 (functionalKd) of binding of each factor IXa protein with the A2 subunit was measured essentially as described previously for its interaction with the intact factor VIIIa (25Mathur A. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18477-18486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 34Mathur A. Zhong D. Sabharwal A.K. Smith K.J. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23418-23426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). For these experiments, concentrations of factor IXa and factor X were kept constant, and the rates of formation of factor Xa were determined at increasing concentrations of the A2 subunit. Reaction mixtures contained 5 nm factor IXa, 250 nm factor X, 25 μm PL, and various concentrations of the A2 subunit in TBS/BSA, pH 7.5 containing 5 mm CaCl2. Reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 5–20 min and stopped by adding 1 μl of 500 mm EDTA. The amount of factor Xa generated was determined by S-2222 hydrolysis as described previously (25Mathur A. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18477-18486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 34Mathur A. Zhong D. Sabharwal A.K. Smith K.J. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23418-23426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The EC50 was obtained by fitting the data to a single-site ligand binding equation (Equation 1) by non-linear regression analysis using the program GraFit from Erithacus Software. V=VmaxLEC50+LEquation 1 V is the rate of formation of factor Xa at a given concentration of the A2 subunit, denoted by L, andVmax is the rate of factor Xa formation by the factor IXa:A2 subunit complex. EC50 is the functionalKd defined as the concentration of free A2 subunit yielding 50% of the Vmax. The background rate of factor Xa generation was obtained by carrying out the reaction in the absence of the A2 subunit. This represented less than 1% of theVmax and was subtracted before data analysis. To obtain EC50 values as a function of substrate concentration, a series of experiments were performed in which factor X was varied from 50 nm to 1 μm. The apparentKd (termedKd(A2)) for binding of each dEGR-IXa protein to the A2 subunit was determined by its ability to inhibit factor IXaWT:A2 subunit interaction in the tenase complex as described previously for intact factor VIIIa (25Mathur A. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18477-18486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 34Mathur A. Zhong D. Sabharwal A.K. Smith K.J. Bajaj S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23418-23426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out as described for the EC50 experiments above, except that the dEGR-IXa and IXaWT were mixed prior to addition of the A2 subunit; this ensured steady state conditions. Mixtures contained 100 nm IXaWT, 30 nm A2 subunit, 250 nm factor X, 25 μm PL, and various concentrations of dEGR-IXa proteins in TBS/BSA, pH 7.5 containing 5 mm CaCl2. The IC50 (concentration of inhibitor required for 50% inhibition) was determined by fitting the data to IC50four-parameter logistic equation of Halfman (35Halfman C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 74: 408-481Google Scholar) given below. y=a1+(x/IC50)s+backgroundEquation 2 y is the rate of factor Xa formation in the presence of a given concentration of dEGR-IXa protein represented byx, a is the maximum rate of factor Xa formation in the absence of dEGR-IXa, and s is the slope factor. Each point was weighted equally, and the data were fitted to Equation 2using the nonlinear regression analysis program GraFit from Erithacus Software. The background value represented ∼5% of the maximum rate of factor Xa formation in the absence of dEGR-IXa. To obtain apparentKd(A2) values for the interaction of dEGR-IXa proteins with A2, we used the following equation as described by Cheng and Prusoff (36Cheng Y.-C. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12330) Google Scholar) and further elaborated by Craig (37Craig D.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 89-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).Kd(A2)=IC501+(A/EC50)Equation 3 A is the concentration of factor IXaWT, and EC50 is the concentration of factor IXaWTthat gives a 50% maximum response in the absence of the competitor at a specified concentration of factor X used in the experiment. Effect of the A2 subunit on the emission intensity of the dansyl moiety in each dEGR-IXa protein was determined using the SLM AB2 spectrofluorometer. Each reaction mixture contained 220 nmdEGR-IXa in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.01% Tween, 200 μg/ml BSA, and 100 μm PL vesicles. The excitation wavelength was 340 nm (slit width, 8 nm) and the emission wavelength was 540 nm (slit width, 8 nm). First, blank values (in triplicate) were obtained for the buffer containing PL. dEGR-IXa was then added, and the emission intensity in the absence of the A2 subunit was recorded. Each reaction mixture was subsequently titrated with the A2 subunit, and the emission readings (in triplicate) were obtained at each point. The fluorescence emission intensity at each point was corrected for increases in the reaction volume prior to analysis of the data. The volume of added A2 subunit did not exceed 10% of the total volume. Data are presented asF/F0, where F0is the emission intensity in the absence of A2 subunit and Fis the intensity at a given A2 subunit concentration. The apparentKd (termedKd(peptide)) for binding of each factor IXa to the A2 558–565 peptide was determined by its ability to inhibit the respective IXa:A2 subunit interaction, as measured by reduction in the rate of factor X activation in the tenase system. The reaction mixtures for both IXaWT and IXaPCEGF1 contained 100 nm factor IXa, 30 nm A2 subunit, 250 nm factor X, and 25 μm PL in TBS/BSA, pH 7.5, with 5 mm CaCl2. The reaction mixture for IXaR333Q contained 300 nm factor IXa instead of 100 nm used for IXaWT or IXaPCEGF1; concentrations of other components were the same. The amount of factor Xa generated was determined by hydrolysis of S-2222. The IC50 values were obtained using Equation 2. Here,y is the rate of factor Xa formation in the presence of a given concentration of the A2 558–565 peptide represented byx, and a is the maximum rate of factor Xa formation in the absence of the A2 peptide. Equation 3 was then used to obtain the apparent Kd(peptide) values. Here,A is the concentration of IXaWT, IXaPCEGF1, or IXaR333Q, and EC50 is the apparent Kd(A2) for the respective IXa:A2 subunit interaction. The three (A1, A2, and A3) domains in factor VIIIa are homologous to the three respective domains in ceruloplasmin (12Pemberton S. Lindley P. Zaitsev V. Card G. Tuddenham E.G.D. Kemball-Cook G. Blood. 1997; 89: 2413-2421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Church W.R. Jernigan R.L. Toole J. Hewick R.M. Knopf J. Knutson G.J. Nesheim M.E. Mann K.G. Fass D.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 6934-6937Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The A1, A2, and A3 domains of factor VIIIa were modeled using the coordinates of each respective domain of ceruloplasmin (39Zaitseva I. Zaitsev V. Card G. Moshkov K. Bax B. Ralph A. Lindley P. J. Biol. Inorg. Chem. 1996; 1: 15-23Crossref Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Each domain was modeled using the homology model building module from Biosym/MSI (San Diego, CA), as well as the Swiss-Model server using the optimize mode (40Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar, 41Guex N. Diemand A. Peitsch M.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 364-367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The two approaches used in building the homology models resulted in minor differences between the structure of each of the A subunits. However, the structure pertaining to the loop containing the 310 helical turn involving residues 558–565 as well as other nearby interface regions of the A2 subunit implicated in binding to factor IXa were invariant between the two models. Further, the Biosym/MSI models of all three A subunits were similar to those published previously by Pembertonet al. (12Pemberton S. Lindley P. Zaitsev V. Card G. Tuddenham E.G.D. Kemball-Cook G. Blood. 1997; 89: 2413-2421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we used the coordinates of Pembertonet al. (Ref. 12Pemberton S. Lindley P. Zaitsev V. Card G. Tuddenham E.G.D. Kemball-Cook G. Blood. 1997; 89: 2413-2421Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; see hemophilia data base, available on-line) in building the interface between the A2 subunit and the protease domain of factor IXa. Details are provided under “Results and Discussion.” The kinetic constants for the activation of factor X were obtained by various factor IXa proteins in the presence of Ca2+ and several concentration of PL. This analysis was performed to establish whether or not the factor IXa proteins under investigation bind to Ca2+ and PL normally and possess a functional active site. The kinetic constants obtained under these conditions in the absence of factor VIIIa are listed in Table I. All mutants activated factor X normally, and the specificity constant (kcat/Km) for each mutant at different PL concentrations did not differ appreciably from that observed for IXaWT or IXaNP. The increase inKm values at higher concentrations of PL for WT or for a given mutant may reflect binding of factor IXa and factor X to different PL vesicles (42Mann K.G. Jenny R.J. Krishnaswamy S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 915-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 43van Dieijen G. Tans G. Rosing J. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3433-3442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further, our Km andkcat values are in close agreement with the earlier published data (18Fay P.J. Koshibui K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 43van Dieijen G. Tans G. Rosing J. Hemker H.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1981; 256: 3433-3442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we also observed a slight increase in kcatfor each factor IXa protein at higher concentrations of PL. Cumulatively, our data presented in Table I indicate t"

Unlike thep21 gene, in which p53-dependent transcriptional activation is mediated by a response element containing two consensus p53 half-sites, it previously was reported that activation of the BAX element by p53 requires additional sequences. Here, it is demonstrated that the minimal BAXresponse element capable of mediating p53-dependent transcriptional activation consists of two p53 half-sites plus an adjacent 6 base pairs (5′-GGGCGT-3′). This GC-rich region constitutes a “GC box” capable both of binding members of the Sp family of transcription factors, including Sp1 in vitro, and of conferring Sp1-dependent transcriptional activation on a minimal promoter in cells. Mutations within this GC box abrogated the ability of p53 to activate transcription without affecting the affinity of p53 for its binding site, demonstrating that these 6 bases are required for p53-dependent activation. In addition, a positive correlation was observed between the ability of p53 to activate transcription in cells and the ability of Sp1 to bind this response element in vitro. Mutations that inhibited Sp1 binding also blocked the ability of p53 to activate transcription through this element. Together, these results suggest a model in which p53 requires the cooperation of Sp1 or a Sp1-like factor to mediate transcriptional activation of the human BAXpromoter.

Fang G. Bhalla K. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 3115-3120PubMed Google Scholar, 6Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5894) Google Scholar). Thus, an important determinant of the apoptotic response of a cell is the balance between the levels of BAX and BCL-2/BCL-XL. In this regard, regulation of the level of expression of BAX protein is key. An important regulator of BAX gene expression is the tumor suppressor protein p53 (7Miyashita T. Krajewski S. Krajewska M.

Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The p53 protein has been implicated in several growth-related pathways, including apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (9Ko L.J. Prives C.

The ability of p53 to function as a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein appears to be central to its role as a tumor suppressor (11Bargonetti J. Friedman P.N. Kern S.E. Vogelstein B. Prives C.

Science. 1991; 252: 1708-1711Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar). At its amino terminus, the protein contains a potent transcriptional activation domain (13Fields S. Jang S.K. Science. 1990; 249: 1046-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar) that is linked to a central core domain that mediates sequence-specific DNA binding (14Bargonetti J. Manfredi J.J. Chen X.

A DNA consensus sequence through which p53 binds and activates transcription has been identified. This sequence consists of two palindromic decamers of 5′-RRRCWWGYYY-3′ (where R is a purine; Y is a pyrimidine; and W is an adenine or thymine) separated by 0–13 base pairs, forming four repeats of the pentamer 5′-RRRCW-3′ alternating between the top and bottom strands of the DNA duplex (18el-Deiry W.S.

When compared with alternate p53 targets, studies demonstrate that the BAX gene is differentially regulated by wild-type p53 in a cell type-specific manner (7Miyashita T. Krajewski S. Krajewska M.

Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3743-3751PubMed Google Scholar). In the mouse, p53-dependent regulation of BAX expression following ionizing radiation is seen in the prostate, thymus, spleen, small intestine, and lung, as well as sympathetic, Purkinje, and olfactory cortical neurons. In the kidney, heart, liver, and brain, however, no p53-dependent regulation of BAX is observed (7Miyashita T. Krajewski S. Krajewska M. Wang H.G. Lin H.K. Liebermann D.A. Hoffman B. Reed J.C.

Furthermore, the myeloid leukemia ML-1, Burkitt's lymphoma WMN and AG876, and lymphoblastoid NL2 and FWL cell lines induce BAX following ionizing radiation, whereas the fibroblast AG1522 and WI38, colorectal carcinoma RKO, and osteosarcoma U2-OS cell lines fail to do so (28Zhan Q. Fan S. Bae I. Guillouf C. Liebermann D.A. O'Connor P.M. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3743-3751PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, several tumor-derived p53 mutants have been identified that are capable of activating transcription through the promoter of thep21 gene but not through the BAX promoter (29Di Como C.J. Prives C. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 30Flaman J.M. Robert V. Lenglet S. Moreau V. Iggo R. Frebourg T.

This correlates with an inability of these mutants to trigger apoptosis (29Di Como C.J. Prives C. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2527-2539Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 31Friedlander P. Haupt Y. Prives C. Oren M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4961-4971Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 32Ludwig R.L. Bates S. Vousden K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4952-4960Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), suggesting that a failure in the ability of p53 to transactivate the BAX gene may play an important role in tumor formation and progression. Supporting this, Yin et al. (33Yin C. Knudson C.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Van Dyke T. Nature. 1997; 385: 637-640Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) demonstrated that BAX is an obligatory downstream effector for the p53-mediated apoptosis that attenuates choroid plexus tumor growth in the TgT121 mouse model. Thus, a complete understanding of the transcriptional regulation of the BAX promoter by p53 may yield important information relevant to our understanding of tumorigenesis. Here is presented a detailed analysis of the p53 response element located in the promoter of the human BAX gene. The minimalBAX response element capable of mediating p53-dependent transcriptional activation is found to consist of two p53 half-sites plus an adjacent 6 base pairs (5′-GGGCGT-3′) that demonstrate sequence-specific binding to the transcription factor Sp1. Mutational analysis of this “GC box” shows it to be required for p53-dependent activation, and a positive correlation between the ability of p53 to activate transcription in cells and the ability of Sp1 to bind this response element in vitro is observed. These results are consistent with a model in which p53 requires the cooperation of Sp1 or a Sp1-like factor to mediate transcriptional activation of the humanBAX gene. This presents the intriguing possibility that regulation of this cofactor may represent a novel basis for the cell type-specific control of the proapoptotic BAX by wild-type p53. The osteosarcoma Saos-2 cell line was maintained in a humidified tissue culture incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.Drosophila SL2 cells were cultured at 25 °C in Schneider's Drosophila medium, containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin.

The following synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotides were digested with KpnI and NheI and cloned into pGL3-E1bTATA (34Resnick-Silverman L. St. Clair S. Maurer M. Zhao K. Manfredi J.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2102-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), which also had been double-digested with KpnI and NheI to produce pTATA vectors with corresponding names: BAX −113/−83, BAX −113/−93, BAX −102/−83, BAX −113/−83(sc −102/−93), BAX(−113/−93)3, BAX −92/−83, BAX −133/−77, p21 5′, BAXGG−92/−91AA, BAXGG−85/−84AA, BAXG−92A, BAXG−91A, BAXG−90A, BAXC−89A, BAXG−88A, BAXT−87G, BAXG−86T, BAXG−85T, BAXG−84T, BAXC−83A, BAX sc −92/−83, BAX sc −86/−83. pBAX −315/+51, pBAX −127/+51, and pBAX −76/+51 were generated by PCR1 amplification of the appropriate fragments from the original pBAX luciferase reporter plasmid (8Miyashita T. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 293-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Upstream primers were engineered with the NheI restriction site. Downstream primers contained the HindIII restriction site. Following PCR, products were digested with bothNheI and HindIII and cloned into pGL3-E1bTATA which was also double-digested with NheI andHindIII, removing the adenovirus E1b minimal promoter. To construct pBAXΔ−126/−77, PCR amplification of the original pBAX was used to generate two fragments corresponding to −315 to −127 and to −76 to +51 from the start site of transcription. The −315 to −127 fragment was engineered to contain the NheI restriction site on the upstream side and the SacI restriction site on the downstream side. The −76 to +51 fragment was engineered to contain the SacI site upstream and theHindIII site downstream. Following PCR amplification each fragment was double-digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes (NheI and SacI or SacI andHindIII). A three-way ligation with the two PCR-generated fragments and pGL3-E1bTATA, double-digested with NheI andHindIII, then was performed, replacing the BAXsequence from −126 to −77 with the SacI restriction site. To construct pBAXΔ−113/−104, PCR amplification of the original pBAX was used to generate two fragments corresponding to −315 to −114 and to −103 to +51 from the start site of transcription. The −315 to −114 fragment was engineered to contain the NheI restriction site on the upstream side and the NcoI restriction site on the downstream side. The −103 to +51 fragment was engineered to contain the NcoI site upstream and theHindIII site downstream. Following PCR amplification each fragment was double-digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes (NheI and NcoI or NcoI andHindIII). A three-way ligation with the two PCR-generated fragments and pGL3-E1bTATA, double-digested with NheI andHindIII, then was performed, replacing the BAXsequence from −113 to −104 with the NcoI restriction site. The generation of pBAXΔ−103/−93, pBAXΔ−92/−83, and pBAXΔ−113/−93 was accomplished as above with pBAXΔ−113/−104 but using PCR-generated fragments corresponding to −315 to −104 and −92 to +51, −315 to −93 and −82 to +51, and −315 to −114 and −92 to +51, respectively. The expression plasmid pCMV-p53wt, originally referred to as pC53-SN3 (35Baker S.J. Markowitz S. Fearon E.R. Willson J.K. Vogelstein B. Science. 1990; 249: 912-915Crossref PubMed Scopus (1611) Google Scholar), encodes the wild-type human p53 protein under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The expression plasmid pPacSp1 contains the 2.1-kilobase pairXhoI restriction fragment of Sp1 cloned downstream of the Actin 5C promoter (36Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). pPacU was generated by removing the 2.1-kilobase pair XhoI fragment from pPacSp1. Saos-2 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). 2 × 105 cells were seeded into 35-mm plates. Cells were transfected 24 h later according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cellular lysates were prepared 24 h post-transfection, and total protein concentration was determined by protein assay (Bio-Rad), and luciferase assays were quantitated using a commercially available kit (Promega) and a TD-20e Luminometer (Turner).Drosophila SL2 cells were transfected using Cellfectin (Life Technologies, Inc.). 60-mm dishes were seeded with 2 × 106 cells in Schneider's Drosophila media containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum but no penicillin or streptomycin. The DNA to be transfected was added to 500 μl of serum-free media containing 8 μl of Cellfectin reagent, mixed gently, and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. This mixture then was added directly to the cells. 48 h post-transfection cells were lysed by sonication (6 × 20 s pulse). Total protein and luciferase activity was determined as above. Unless otherwise stated, all procedures were conducted at 4 °C. HeLa S3 cells were obtained as a packed cell pellet from the National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN). Cell pellets were resuspended in 5 volumes of Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm DTT) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cells then were centrifuged at 500 × g for 12 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in two packed cell volumes of Buffer A. Cells were homogenized 10 times in a Dounce homogenizer with pestle A (tight). The resulting solution was centrifuged at 430 × g for 10 min to pellet the nuclei. The supernatant was decanted, and the pellet was recentrifuged at 24,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant again was removed. The pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of Buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT) per 109 cells. The solution was homogenized 10 times with pestle B (loose). The resulting solution was transferred to a beaker and stirred for 30 min on ice. The solution then was centrifuged at 24,000 × g for 30 min. The resulting nuclear extract was dialyzed against Buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mKCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT) for 5 h. The extract was clarified by centrifugation at 24,000 × g for 20 min. Nuclear extracts were aliquoted, frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath, and stored at −70 °C. Production of baculovirus-infected Sf9 cell extracts and purification of recombinant human p53 protein were done as described previously (34Resnick-Silverman L. St. Clair S. Maurer M. Zhao K. Manfredi J.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2102-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Purified p53 protein, extract from Sf9 cells expressing recombinant human Sp1 protein, or HeLa cell nuclear extract was incubated with 3 ng of radiolabeled double-stranded oligonucleotide and antibody (Sp1 PEP-2X, p300 N-15X, and CBP 451X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), where appropriate, in a total volume of 30 μl of DNA binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 83 mmNaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 12% glycerol, 2 mmMgCl2, 2 mm spermidine, 0.7 mm DTT, and 17 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)) for 20 min at room temperature. Samples were loaded on a native 4% acrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE and electrophoresed at 4 °C at 225 V for 2 h. The gel was dried and exposed to Kodak XAR film using an intensifying screen at −70 °C. Phosphorimaging and densitometry data were collected with a Personal Molecular Imager FX and a GS-710 Calibrated Imaging Densitometer (Bio-Rad), and analyzed with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). Previously it was demonstrated that in isolation the p53 response element from the human BAX promoter required sequences from three adjacent half-sites to confer p53-dependent transcriptional activation on a minimal promoter (37Thornborrow E.C. Manfredi J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33747-33756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To confirm the requirement of all three half-sites in the context of the BAX promoter, luciferase reporter plasmids with various deletions in the BAX promoter, both in and around the p53 response element, were cotransfected with either pCMV or a wild-type p53 expression vector into the p53-negative osteosarcoma Saos-2 cell line (Fig. 1). The previously characterized p53 response element of the BAXpromoter is contained within the sequence from −113 to −83 from the start site of transcription. There was no significant difference between the p53-dependent transactivation of either a reporter construct lacking sequences 5′ to the p53 response element (pBAX −127/+51) or the full-length promoter construct (pBAX −315/+51)(Fig. 1 A). Deletion of a larger fragment, including the p53 response element (pBAX −76/+51), produced a reporter construct that was unresponsive to wild-type p53 (Fig. 1 A). Furthermore, targeted deletion of the promoter region containing the p53 response element (pBAXΔ−126/−77) also produced a reporter plasmid that was unresponsive to wild-type p53 (Fig. 1 A). These results show that −113 to −83 is the only region, within the 366-base pair promoter fragment investigated, that affects the ability of p53 to activate transcription. The region from −113 to −83 contains three potential p53 half-sites (represented in Fig. 1 B as the light gray, white,and dark gray boxes). The role of each of these half-sites in the p53-dependent activation of the BAXpromoter was examined. Removal of the first half-site from −113 to −104 (pBAXΔ−113/−104) significantly reduced the ability of p53 to activate transcription through this promoter (Fig. 1 B, compare 63-fold with pBAX −315/+51 to 7-fold with pBAXΔ−113/−104), whereas removal of the second (pBAXΔ−103/−93) or the third half-site (pBAXΔ−92/−83) completely abolished the ability of p53 to activate transcriptionally the promoter (Fig. 1 B). Consistent with the above results, removal of the first and second half-sites in combination (pBAXΔ−113/−93) also abolished the ability of p53 to activate transcriptionally the promoter (Fig.1 B). These results demonstrate that, as was observed with the isolated response element (37Thornborrow E.C. Manfredi J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33747-33756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), p53 requires sequences from all three potential half-sites to mediate transcriptional activation of theBAX promoter. Each of the three potential p53 half-sites located in the BAX promoter from −113 to −83 closely resembles the consensus sequence of 5′-RRRCWWGYYY-3′ (represented in Fig. 2 by the light gray, white, and dark gray boxes). The first, located at −113 to −104, deviates from the consensus at 2 bases (−113 and −104). The second half-site matches the consensus sequence at all 20 base pairs and is located at −102 to −93. The third half-site is located at −92 to −83 and deviates from the consensus at three bases (−84, −85, and −88)(see Fig. 2). These three half-sites can combine in different ways to produce a total of three possible p53 complete binding sites (half-sites 1 and 2, 2 and 3, and 1 and 3). Previous studies demonstrated that in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), double-stranded oligonucleotides representing both −113 to −93 (half-sites 1 and 2) and −102 to −83 (half-sites 2 and 3) are capable of binding p53 in a sequence-specific manner with similar affinities (37Thornborrow E.C. Manfredi J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33747-33756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). When cloned upstream of the adenovirus E1bminimal promoter in the pTATA luciferase reporter plasmid, however, the combination of the first and second half-sites (−113 to −93) is unable to mediate p53-dependent transcriptional activation (37Thornborrow E.C. Manfredi J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33747-33756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To examine further the ability of p53 to interact with this sequence in cells, the −113 to −93 sequence was multimerized (as three copies) and cloned into the pTATA luciferase reporter plasmid. This reporter plasmid was cotransfected with either pCMV or a wild-type p53 expression vector in the Saos-2 cell line (Fig. 2). These three copies of this p53-binding site were capable of mediating a significant degree of activation in response to p53 (Fig. 2, compare 4-fold with pTATA-113/−93 to 142-fold with pTATA(−113/−93)3), demonstrating that the sequence from −113 to −93 is indeed abona fide p53 response element capable of both binding p53 in a sequence-specific manner in vitro and mediating p53-dependent transcriptional activation in cells. Confirming previous results, p53 was able to activate transcription through the second and third half-sites (−102 to −83), but this activation was significantly reduced as compared with that mediated by all three half-sites combined (Fig. 2, compare 44-fold with pTATA-102/−83 and 153-fold with pTATA-113/−83). To test the ability of half-sites one and three to mediate p53-dependent transcriptional activation, a synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to −113 to −83 of the BAX promoter, with −102 to −93 scrambled to remove any contribution of the second half-site, was cloned into the pTATA reporter plasmid. This construct failed to be activated by p53 (Fig. 2, pTATA-113/−83(sc −102/−93)). The third half-site in isolation (−92 to −83) also failed to mediate p53-dependent transcriptional activation (Fig. 2, pTATA-92/−83). We previously reported the identification of a nuclear factor, termed Binder of BAX 1 (BoB1), that interacts with sequence specificity with the same region of the human BAX promoter that is required for p53-dependent transcriptional activation (37Thornborrow E.C. Manfredi J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33747-33756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). These previous studies demonstrated that this factor binds to sequences within the region of −102 to −83. Analysis of this region using a MatInspector search of the TRANSFAC data base (38Quandt K.

To test this, a synthetic oligonucleotide corresponding to −102 to −83 of the BAX promoter was used as a radiolabeled probe in an EMSA with HeLa cell nuclear extract (Fig. 3).

PRL-1 is a predominantly nuclear, farnesylated PTPase that has been linked to the control of cellular growth and differentiation. This interaction was initially found using the yeast two-hybrid system. ATF-7 is most closely related to members of the ATF/CREB family of bZIP proteins, with highest homology to ATF-4. ATF-7 homodimers can bind specifically to CRE elements. ATF-7 is expressed in a number of different tissues and is expressed in association with differentiation in the Caco-2 cell model of intestinal differentiation. We have confirmed the PRL-1·ATF-7 interaction and mapped the regions of ATF-7 and PRL-1 important for interaction to ATF-7's bZIP region and PRL-1's phosphatase domain. Finally, we have determined that PRL-1 is able to dephosphorylate ATF-7 in vitro. Further insight into ATF-7's precise cellular roles, transcriptional function, and downstream targets are likely be of importance in understanding the mechanisms underlying the complex processes of maintenance, differentiation, and turnover of epithelial tissues.

It is clear that many cellular processes are regulated through protein phosphorylation. This post-translational modification is responsible for the control of a wide variety of important processes, including the regulation of metabolism, cell proliferation, the cell cycle, gene expression, protein synthesis, and cellular transport (1Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2607) Google Scholar,2Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 6: 415-424Crossref Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation is a dynamic and reversible process, it follows that phosphatases are as important as kinases in its regulation (3Tonks N.K. Neel B.G.

Phosphorylation of transcription factors and their associated proteins is one of the principal methods used to regulate gene expression (1Hunter T.

Classic examples of this latter phenomenon include the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) 1The abbreviations used are: bZIPbasic leucine zipper proteinPTPaseprotein-tyrosine phosphataseCREcyclic-AMP response elementCREBCRE-binding proteinATFactivating transcription factorbpbase pair(s)C/EBPCCAAT enhancer-binding proteinGSTglutathione S-transferaseTKthymidine kinaseaaamino acid(s)PAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresiskbkilobase(s) proteins CREB and c-Jun, where phosphorylation of specific residues in the transactivating domain has been demonstrated to up-regulate transactivation, probably by allowing interaction of these proteins with transcriptional coactivators such as CREB-binding protein (12Chrivia J.C.

Kinases or phosphatases may also, in some situations, bind transcription factors but influence transcription by acting on proteins other than the transcription factors themselves (7Ghosh S.

An example of this phenomenon is the nuclear tyrosine kinase c-Abl, which binds to p53 and increases its transactivating ability without phosphorylating it. It is thought that Abl may be able to execute this function by phosphorylating the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II, which is known to be extensively phosphorylated on tyrosine (14Baskaran R.

Cressman D.E. Laz T.M. Abrams C.S. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3752-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). PRL-1 is a 20-kDa protein that contains the “signature” amino acid sequence for the active site of PTPases but otherwise does not contain regions of homology to any previously described protein (16Diamond R.H. Cressman D.E. Laz T.M. Abrams C.S. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3752-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). PRL-1 is primarily localized to the cell nucleus with a discrete, reproducible “speckled” pattern on immunofluorescence. Under certain circumstances, PRL-1 also is localized to extranuclear sites in the cell (17Kong W. Swain G.P. Li S. Diamond R.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G613-G621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Zeng Q. Si X. Horstmann H. Xu Y. Hong W. Pallen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21444-21452Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). PRL-1 is found in the insoluble cellular fraction, despite the fact that it is readily soluble when expressed in bacteria (16Diamond R.H. Cressman D.E. Laz T.M. Abrams C.S. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3752-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). This is likely a result of protein prenylation, because PRL-1 is a farnesylated protein (19Cates C.A. Michael R.L. Stayrook K.R. Harvey K.A. Burke Y.D. Randall S.K. Crowell P.L. Crowell D.N. Cancer Lett. 1996; 110: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). When PRL-1 was stably overexpressed in 3T3 fibroblasts, altered growth characteristics became apparent, including a faster doubling time, growth to a greater saturation density, altered morphology, and evidence of anchorage-independent growth manifested by the ability of these cells to grow in soft agar (16Diamond R.H. Cressman D.E. Laz T.M. Abrams C.S. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3752-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PRL-1 in epithelial cells resulted in tumor formation in nude mice (19Cates C.A. Michael R.L. Stayrook K.R. Harvey K.A. Burke Y.D. Randall S.K. Crowell P.L. Crowell D.N. Cancer Lett. 1996; 110: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). PRL-1 is also significantly expressed in intestinal epithelia, and in contrast to PRL-1's expression pattern in liver, its expression is associated with cellular differentiation in the intestine. Specifically, PRL-1 is expressed in villus but not crypt enterocytes, and in differentiated, but not proliferating, Caco-2 cells (20Diamond R.H. Peters C. Jung S.P. Greenbaum L.E. Haber B.A. Silberg D.G. Traber P.G. Taub R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G121-G129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, PRL-1 protein was found to be expressed during development in a number of differentiating epithelial tissues (17Kong W. Swain G.P. Li S. Diamond R.H. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: G613-G621Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that PRL-1 may have divergent roles in different tissues. It is an established feature of some growth response genes that they may play a role in terminal differentiation in some tissues (21Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R. Cell. 1985; 42: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar, 22Benito M. Porras A. Nebreda A.R. Santos E.

The apparently paradoxical dual roles may be explained by the availability of different substrates or cofactors in different cells, different kinetics of protein expression, or by the presence of scaffolding or anchoring proteins that may direct an enzyme to a different cellular location and different substrates (26Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 275: 2075-2080Crossref Scopus (1903) Google Scholar, 27Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4239) Google Scholar). Significant insight into PRL-1's specific cellular functions and the reasons for its apparently varied expression pattern in different tissues may be derived from identification of PRL-1's substrates and other cellular partners. To that end, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using PRL-1 as bait. We have identified a novel protein that interacts with PRL-1. This protein, which we have designated ATF-7, is a novel bZIP protein most closely related to members of the ATF/CREB family. We have functionally confirmed that ATF-7 is a bZIP protein by showing that its homodimers specifically bind to cyclic AMP response (CRE) elements. We have confirmed the interaction of PRL-1 and ATF-7 using GST binding and coimmunoprecipitation assays, and we have mapped the sites of interaction to include PRL-1's phosphatase domain and ATF-7's bZIP domain. ATF-7 is expressed in a number of different tissues, and it is expressed in association with differentiation in the Caco-2 cell model of intestinal differentiation. Finally, we have determined that PRL-1 is able to dephosphorylate ATF-7 in vitro. It is likely that further insight into ATF-7's precise cellular roles, transcriptional function, and downstream targets will be of importance in understanding the mechanisms underlying the complex processes of maintenance, differentiation, and turnover of epithelial tissues. The N-terminal 132 amino acids of PRL-1 fused to the C terminus of the GAL4 DNA binding domain in the yeast expression vector pGBT9 (CLONTECH) was constructed from the full-length PRL-1 cDNA. This construct contains most of the full-length PRL-1 cDNA except for the C-terminal basic region and CCIQ farnesylation domain. The active site cysteine (Cys-104) was mutated to serine as previously described (C104S) (16Diamond R.H. Cressman D.E. Laz T.M. Abrams C.S. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3752-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Use of active site cysteine-serine mutant PTPases to demonstrate binding of PTPases to other proteins is a well-established and validated method (28Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K.

A 3T3-L1 adipocyte library was synthesized from fully differentiated adipocytes with a cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene) and constructed in the pGAD-10 GAL4 vector (CLONTECH) (gift of Dr. Alan Saltiel) (31Ribon V. Printen J.A. Hoffman N.G. Kay B.K. Saltiel A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 872-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The yeast strain HF7c was cotransformed with the GAL4-PRL-1 construct and with the 3T3-L1 adipocyte library. The resulting transformants were plated on selection medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine and were incubated at 30 °C for 4–5 days. 5 × 106 clones were analyzed. Colonies positive for growth on selective media lacking histidine were blotted on filter paper (Whatman number 5), permeabilized in liquid nitrogen, and placed on another filter soaked in Z buffer (60 mmNa2HPO4, 40 mmNaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 37.5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) containing 1 mm5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactoside. Yeast colonies were scored as positive when a bright color developed within 3 h. Library-derived plasmids were rescued from positive clones and then transformed into HB101 Escherichia coli by electroporation. False positives were eliminated by transforming the rescued plasmids back into yeast along with either the PRL-1 bait construct, empty vector, or a control p53 bait construct. True positives were identified by their requirement for the PRL-1 bait construct to activate the reporter genes, and these were then sequenced. Sequence analysis was performed using GenAlign software, and FASTA and BLAST searches were performed against the SwissProt and GenBank™ data libraries. RNA preparation, Northern blot analyses, and labeling of recombinant plasmids have been described elsewhere (16Diamond R.H. Cressman D.E. Laz T.M. Abrams C.S. Taub R. Mol. Cell.

Caco-2 cells were grown and harvested with respect to proliferating and differentiated phenotypes as previously described (20Diamond R.H. Peters C. Jung S.P. Greenbaum L.E. Haber B.A. Silberg D.G. Traber P.G. Taub R. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G121-G129Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from cells and from mouse tissues using the techniques previously described (32Mohn K.L. Laz T.M. Hsu J.C. Melby A.E. Bravo R. Taub R. Mol. Cell.

Hybridization buffer consisted of 10% dextran sulfate, 40% formamide, 0.6 mNaCl, 0.06 m sodium citrate, 7 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 0.8× Denhardt's solution, and 0.002% heat-denatured, sonicated salmon sperm DNA. Northern blots were hybridized at 42 °C for 16 h and washed for 30 min twice at 60 °C in 0.015m NaCl-0.0015 m sodium citrate-0.1% SDS prior to exposure to film (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The cDNA insert of a full-length ATF-7 clone isolated in the yeast two-hybrid screen and the cDNA insert of full-length C104S-PRL-1 were cloned into the pSPUTK (Stratagene) both with and without an Myc epitope fused to the N-terminal end. This vector provides a strong Kozak (34Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) consensus sequence and methionine for translation. C104S-PRL-1 and wild type PRL-1 were cloned into the pGEX GST fusion vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The appropriate restriction sites and the indicated epitope tags were added by performing the polymerase chain reaction with primers containing these sequences. Plasmid constructs were confirmed by sequencing and by protein expression. For interaction site mapping studies, the following constructs were made in pSPUTK: pSPUTK-ATF-7-amino (amino acids (aa) 1–139) and pSPUTK-ATF-7-bZIP (aa 140–217). The following constructs were made in pGEX: PGEX-PRL-1-aa-1–96, PGEX-PRL-1-aa-1–132, PGEX-PRL-1-aa-60–118, PGEX-PRL-1-aa-97–173, PGEX-PRL-1-aa-97–132, and PGEX-PRL-1-aa-118–173. All deletion and truncation constructs were made using polymerase chain reaction with appropriate primers and restriction sites and were sequenced completely prior to use in experiments. The in vitro translated proteins (pSPUTK) or bacterially expressed proteins (pGEX) were all of the predicted size. Rabbit polyclonal anti-ATF-7 antibodies were prepared by Cocalico Biologicals (Reamstown, PA) against bacterially expressed purified denatured ATF-7 protein expressed as a fusion protein linked to six histidines (35Rosenberg A.H. Lade B.N. Chui D.S. Lin S.W. Dunn J.J. Studier F.W. Gene. 1987; 56: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar). The anti-Myc epitope tag monoclonal antibody (9E10) was obtained commercially (Babco, Richmond, CA). In vitrotranscription/translation was performed using the TnT-coupled lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The reaction was incubated for 2 h at 30 °C in the presence of [35S]methionine, and the products were analyzed directly by SDS-PAGE or subjected to immunoprecipitation or binding assays prior to SDS-PAGE as described in the text. Radiolabeled in vitrotranslated proteins (5 μl) were incubated with GST or GST-PRL-1 C104S fusion proteins (1 μg), or with the indicated PRL-1 protein fragments attached to glutathione-Sepharose beads in 500 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl) for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rotation. The beads were washed five times with binding buffer and resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and the sample was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The two proteins or protein fragments being tested were in vitro translated simultaneously as described above. One protein used was fused to the Myc-tag epitope. 7.5 μl of the in vitro translated protein was incubated with to 5 μl of the anti-Myc-tag antibody or control sera in 500 μl of IP buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton) for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were bound to protein A-agarose beads and, after washing four times in IP buffer, were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Preannealed, gel-purified, double-stranded oligonucleotides were radiolabeled and incubated with 5 μl of in vitro translated proteins or 10 μg of mouse liver nuclear extract for 15 min at room temperature in binding buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5/50 mm NaCl/1 mmEDTA/1 mm dithiothreitol/5 mmMgCl2/10% (v/v) glycerol). 1–2 μg of poly(dI-dC) was used as a nonspecific competitor in each reaction. Nuclear extracts from liver were prepared according to the method of Hattori (36Hattori M. Tugores A. Veloz L. Karin M. Brenner D.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 777-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), with modifications (37Greenbaum L.E. Cressman D.E. Haber B.A. Taub R. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 1351-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The mixtures were electrophoresed on a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE buffer (88 mmTris, 88 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA). Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Supershifts were performed by incubating 1–1.5 μl of primary antibody with in vitrotranslated proteins in binding buffer for 45 min at 4 °C, prior to addition of labeled oligonucleotide. Cold competitions were performed by incubating unlabeled oligonucleotide in 100-fold excess within vitro translated proteins in binding buffer for 45 min at 4 °C prior to the addition of labeled oligonucleotide. The double-stranded oligonucleotides used were: CRE: TCATGGTAAAAATGACGTCATGGTAATTA, C/EBP: GATCCGGTTGCCAAACATTGCGCAATCT, and AP1: TATCGATAAGCTATGACTCATCCGGGGGA. Oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using polynucleotide kinase. GST-ATF-7 was expressed in bacteria and purified using the methods outlined above. The protein, attached to glutathione beads, was tyrosine-phosphorylated with 32P using c-Src kinase (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's directions. After the kinase reaction was stopped, the beads were washed four times in 1 ml of phosphatase buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol), resuspended, and split into three equal aliquots. PRL-1 active phosphatase and C104S-PRL-1 inactive mutant phosphatase were prepared as described previously (16Diamond R.H. Cressman D.E. Laz T.M. Abrams C.S. Taub R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3752-3762Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of active or mutant PRL-1, or buffer (negative control), were added to each tube, which were then incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. The phosphatase reaction was terminated by the addition of equal volumes of 2× Laemmli buffer, the products were then boiled, and run on an SDS-PAGE gel, which was then dried and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak). The results were quantified by densitometry. To identify PRL-1-interacting proteins, a truncated PRL-1 (amino acids 1–132) fused to the DNA binding domain of GAL4 was used as bait to screen a 3T3-L1 adipocyte cDNA expression library fused to the GAL4 transcriptional activation domain in the yeast two-hybrid interaction system. The bait construct used contains most of the full-length PRL-1 protein except for the C-terminal basic and farnesylation domains. Full-length PRL-1 bait did not yield any positives (true or false), although we later determined that full-length PRL-1 can in fact interact with ATF-7. We were able to document that the full-length fusion protein was able to be expressed in the yeast (data not shown). Because PRL-1 is a farnesylated protein residing in the insoluble cellular fraction (despite being readily soluble itself when expressed in bacteria) (16Diamond R.H. Cressman D.E. Laz T.M. Abrams C.S. Taub R. Mol. Cell.

Of 5 × 106 total transformants, 38 colonies positive for β-galactosidase activity were isolated from histidine-minus plates. When the library-derived plasmids were recovered from these 38 colonies, we determined that 31 were true positives. 16 of these clones encoded either full-length or near full-length ATF-7. The remaining 15 clones all encoded another novel protein that has no homology to ATF-7 and is not a transcription factor. 2R. Diamond, unpublished data. This protein will be the subject of a separate report. As summarized in Fig.1, each of the GAL4-AD/ATF-7 clones induced histidine-minus growth and β-galactosidase activity only when they were coexpressed with PRL-1-derived/GAL4-BD fusion protein and not with an unrelated GAL4-BD fusion protein containing p53 or the GAL4 DNA binding domain alone (empty vector). Sequence analysis of the clone with the longest insert (1.6 kb) revealed a single open reading frame of 651 bp fused in-frame to the GAL4 activation domain. The sequence is shown in Fig. 2 A. An ATG initiation codon was present near the 5′-end, which was a good match for the canonical Kozak eukaryotic translation initiation consensus (34Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence encodes a protein of 217 amino acid residues, with a predicted molecular mass of 24 kDa and a pI of 5.46. In vitro translation of the ATF cDNA yielded an ∼30-kDa protein (Fig. 4), probably due to post-translational modification of the protein.Figure 4PRL-1 and ATF-7 interact in vitro. A, in vitrotranscription/translation of ATF-7, Myc-tagged C104S-PRL-1 (full-length), and luciferase control protein was performed in the presence of [35S]methionine as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunoprecipitation with an anti-Myc-tag antibody was then carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Lanes 1–3 show the results of the in vitro translation; lanes 4–6 show the results of the immunoprecipitation, which demonstrates that ATF-7 coimmunoprecipitates with the Myc-tagged C104S PRL-1.

The extreme C-terminal end of the predicted ATF-7 protein contains three leucines and three valines, each separated by six other amino acids, suggesting a leucine zipper structure (38Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1988; 240: 1759-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (2544) Google Scholar). This hybrid leucine-valine zipper is unique to ATF-7 among the previously described bZIP proteins. Immediately upstream of this leucine-valine zipper sequence is an arginine-lysine-rich basic domain, thought to be necessary for sequence-specific DNA binding by bZIP proteins (39Dang C.V. McGuire M. Buckmire M. Lee W.M.F. Nature. 1989; 337: 664-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 40Neuberg M.M. Schuermann M. Hunter J.B. Muller R. Nature. 1989; 338: 589-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The N-terminal end of the predicted protein is negatively charged and proline-rich, reminiscent of the acidic activation domains of bZIP transcription factors. The bZIP family can be divided into three groups on the basis of binding site preference (41Lamb P. McKnight S.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 417-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar): (i) the C/EBPs, (ii) the AP1 group of transcription factors, and (iii) the CREB/ATF family, which contains the ATFs, the original CREBs, and the CRE modulators. Distinctions within the bZIP family are also based upon differences in transactivating ability, patterns of tissue expression, and phosphorylation by specific kinases (41Lamb P. McKnight S.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 417-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 B and summarized in Fig. 2 C, ATF-7 is most closely related to ATF-4 (also known as CREB-2, C/ATF, and TAXREB67 (42Tsujimoto A. Nyunoya H. Morita T. Sato T. Shimotohno K. J.

Osteoclasts, multinucleate cells responsible for bone resorption, are derived from hematopoietic stem cells that differentiate along the macrophage/monocyte lineage (1Martin T.J. Ng K.W. Suda T.

Direct contact between osteoblasts or stromal cells with mononuclear precursors of osteoclasts is required for their differentiation into mature, functional, multinucleate osteoclasts (3Suda T. Takahashi N. Martin T.J. Bikle D.D. Negro-vilar A. Endocrine Reviews, Monographs. 4. Endocrine Society, Bethesda, MD1995: 266-270Google Scholar). Osteoblasts/stromal cells express a membrane-bound protein termed RANKL, which stimulates the differentiation and formation of multinucleate osteoclasts from mononuclear precursors when it binds to its receptor, RANK (4Hsu H.

It acts as a decoy receptor for RANKL, antagonizing its biological actions by preventing it from binding to and activating its receptor, RANK (16Simonet W.S. Lacey D.L. Dunstan C.R. Kelley M.

Overexpression of OPG in transgenic mice results in severe osteopetrosis, with impaired formation of marrow cavity and profound depletion of osteoclasts.

The full-length cDNA of osteoclastinhibitory lectin (OCIL) predicts OCIL to be a 207-amino acid type II membrane protein with a 143-amino acid extracellular domain, a 21-amino acid transmembrane domain, and a 43-amino acid cytoplasmic domain.DISCUSSIONWe report the cloning and characterization of an inhibitor of osteoclast formation (mOCIL) that belongs to the C-type lectin family. The structure of mOCIL is reminiscent of a type II transmembrane protein, with a carboxyl-terminal extracellular domain and a short amino-terminal cytoplasmic domain.Lectins are nonenzymatic sugar-binding proteins that bind with considerable specificity to complex carbohydrate structures found on cell surfaces and in the extracellular matrix and secreted glycoproteins. They are involved in numerous cellular processes such as host-pathogen interactions, targeting of proteins within cells, and cell-cell interactions (40Gabius H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 543-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar, 44Drickamer K. Taylor M.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 237-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). The calcium-dependent (C-type) lectin family includes cell adhesion molecules like selectins, which target leukocytes to lymphoid tissues and sites of inflammation (45Cummings R.D. Smith D.F.

These proteins contain a C-type carbohydrate recognition domain attached to other domains responsible for the physiological functions of the molecule (51Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9557-9560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein sequences containing C-type lectin domains are classified into seven different categories according to sequence homology and/or the overall modular architecture of the protein (52Drickamer K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1993; 3: 393-400Crossref Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The C-type lectin domain of mOCIL has a 36% homology to the C-lectin domain of human CD69. CD69 is the earliest leukocyte activation antigen and is expressed mainly by activated T, B, and natural killer cells. Studies in mice deficient in CD69 through targeted gene deletion suggested that CD69 plays a role in B cell development, with otherwise normal hematopoietic cell development as well as normal T cell subpopulations and functions (53Lauzurica P. Sancho D. Torres M. Albella B. Marazuela M. Merino T. Bueren J.A. Martinez A.C. Sanchez-Madrid F. Blood. 2000; 95: 2312-2320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CD69 belongs to the group V category of C-type lectins, which includes natural killer dimeric cell-surface receptors CD94/NKG2, Ly-49, and NKR-P1 (48Weis W.I. Kahn R. Fourme R. Drickamer K. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1991; 254: 1608-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). There is little information available regarding the structure of these receptors, how they recognize their ligands, and how they form dimers.Recombinant OCIL inhibited osteoclast formation predominantly in the proliferative phase of osteoclastogenesis, with a smaller effect during the differentiation phase. Osteoclast inhibitors such as IL-18 and GM-CSF (21Horwood N.J. Udagawa N. Elliott J. Grail D. Okamura H. Kurimoto M. Dunn A.R. Martin T. Gillespie M.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) elicit their actions only during the proliferative phase of osteoclast formation, whereas legumain appears to block the later stages of osteoclast formation (22Choi S.J. Reddy S.V. Devlin R.D. Menaa C. Chung H. Boyce B.F. Roodman G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27747-27753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). We assessed OCIL action with adherent spleen cells to eliminate the effects of lymphocytes because IL-18 inhibits osteoclast formation via the production of GM-CSF by T cells, suggesting that the immune system may have a regulatory role in osteoclastogenesis. Identical results were obtained with T cell-depleted spleen cells (data not shown), thus suggesting that OCIL acts on osteoclast precursors independently of T cells and other lymphocytes.Osteoblasts express RANKL and OPG as well as OCIL. Like RANKL, OCIL is a transmembrane protein that may be dependent on cell-cell interactions for its effects. Our results suggest that OCIL is capable of acting independently in regulating osteoclast formation, although cooperativity with OPG cannot be excluded. The ability of OCIL to act independently of OPG was demonstrated with adherent spleen cultures treated with RANKL and M-CSF. Such cultures lack osteoblasts; and as a consequence, OPG levels were very low (data not shown). In the mouse bone marrow culture, OCIL and OPG were constitutively expressed during the proliferative phase (days 0–4), permitting both to act in the early phase of osteoclast formation to inhibit osteoclast formation. In the later phase of osteoclast formation (days 5–8), OCIL mRNA expression was substantially suppressed, enabling the formation of multinucleate osteoclasts. In contrast, OPG mRNA not only was maintained, but was slightly increased during this phase of osteoclast formation. Although this would appear to be contrary to the actions of OPG in osteoclast formation, we hypothesize that during this later phase, OPG may be acting to inhibit the resorptive action of mature osteoclasts (19Hakeda Y. Kobayashi Y. Yamaguchi K. Yasuda H. Tsuda E. Higashio K. Miyata T. Kumegawa M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 251: 796-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The marked down-regulation of OCIL mRNA expression during the later phase implies that OCIL does not share this secondary function with OPG, highlighting a major difference in action between these two molecules.The regulation of OCIL mRNA expression was also different from that of OPG. OCIL mRNA expression was increased by a variety of osteotropic factors such as retinoic acid, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, parathyroid hormone, IL-1β, and IL-11. Similar osteotropic factors up-regulate RANKL mRNA expression (7Yasuda H. Shima N. Nakagawa N. Yamaguchi K. Kinosaki M. Mochizuki S. Tomoyasu A. Yano K. Goto M. Murakami A. Tsuda E. Morinaga T.

Riggs B.L. Khosla S. Bone ( Elmsford ). 1999; 25: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). In contrast, OPG mRNA expression is decreased by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, glucocorticoids, and PGE2 (11Horwood N.J. Elliott J. Martin T.J. Gillespie M.T.

Eukaryotic Gene Expression. 1998; 8: 107-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), which are largely refractile to regulation by osteotropic agents, or the case with OPG, whose regulation opposes that of RANKL, regulation of OCIL and RANKL appears concordant, suggesting that OCIL may be a tonic inhibitor of the actions of RANKL under physiological conditions in bone. Under pathological conditions of increased bone turnover, in which osteoclast formation is increased through the actions of cytokines, the concurrent up-regulation of OCIL might act as a self-regulatory mechanism to limit osteoclast formation.One of the more intriguing aspects of recent knowledge on RANKL and OPG has been the demonstration that both molecules are widely distributed in tissues other than bone, thus raising questions about their possible functions in extraskeletal tissues.

OCIL expression was found to be very similar to our previously described distribution for RANKL (60Kartsogiannis V. Zhou H. Horwood N.J. Thomas R.J. Hards D.K. Quinn J.M. Niforas P. Ng K.W. Martin T.J. Gillespie M.T. Bone ( Elmsford ). 1999; 25: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), being present also in brain, heart, skeletal muscle, skin, lung, and kidney, and the expression of OCIL in these tissues was maintained in newborn as well as adult tissues. The function of OCIL in tissues other than bone is unknown. The widespread distribution of RANKL, OPG, and OCIL suggests that each molecule probably has a multifunctional role with the possibility of different effects depending on tissue-specific microenvironments.Recent discoveries of RANKL and OPG as promoter and inhibitor, respectively, of osteoclast formation highlight the importance of local control in this process. Studies showing that the induction of osteoclastogenesis is dependent upon the relative abundance of RANKL compared with the levels of OPG (7Yasuda H. Shima N. Nakagawa N. Yamaguchi K. Kinosaki M.

Khosla S. Dunstan C.R. Lacey D.L. Boyle W.J. Riggs B.L. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 2-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the results presented in this study provide good evidence that OCIL, in conjunction with RANKL, may also play an important role in the regulation of osteoclast formation. The proximity of OCIL to RANKL on the osteoblast cell membrane, together with in vitro evidence that OCIL inhibits RANKL- and M-CSF-induced osteoclast formation, is strongly suggestive of an interaction between these molecules in skeleton and perhaps in other tissues as well. The interactions of the recently discovered proteins RANKL (Receptor Activator ofNF-κB ligand), osteoprotegerin (OPG),1 and RANK, the cognate receptor for RANKL, along with M-CSF are crucial to the formation of osteoclasts. Osteoclasts, multinucleate cells responsible for bone resorption, are derived from hematopoietic stem cells that differentiate along the macrophage/monocyte lineage (1Martin T.J. Ng K.W. Suda T. Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. North Am. 1989; 18: 833-858Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Suda T. Takahashi N. Martin T.J. Endocr. Rev. 1992; 13: 66-80PubMed Google Scholar). Direct contact between osteoblasts or stromal cells with mononuclear precursors of osteoclasts is required for their differentiation into mature, functional, multinucleate osteoclasts (3Suda T. Takahashi N. Martin T.J. Bikle D.D. Negro-vilar A. Endocrine Reviews, Monographs. 4. Endocrine Society, Bethesda, MD1995: 266-270Google Scholar). Osteoblasts/stromal cells express a membrane-bound protein termed RANKL, which stimulates the differentiation and formation of multinucleate osteoclasts from mononuclear precursors when it binds to its receptor, RANK (4Hsu H.

We monitored the transbilayer movement of several polyunsaturated FA and oxidation products (13-hydroxy octadecadienoic acid (HODE) and 15-hydroxytetraenoic acid (HETE)) in unilamellar protein-free phospholipid vesicles containing a fluorescent pH probe. All FA diffused rapidly by the flip-flop mechanism across the model membrane, as revealed by pH changes inside the vesicle. This result suggests that FA oxidation products generated in the cell could cross the plasma or nuclear membrane spontaneously without a membrane transporter. To illuminate features of extra- and intracellular transport, the partitioning of unsaturated FA and oxidized FA between phospholipid vesicles and albumin or FABP was studied by the pyranin assay. These experiments showed that all polyunsaturated FA and oxidized FA (13-HODE and 15-HETE) desorbed rapidly from the phospholipid bilayer to bind to bovine serum albumin, which showed a slight preference for the unsaturated FA over the oxidized FA. FABP rapidly bound FA in the presence of phospholipid bilayers, with a preference of 13-HODE over the unsaturated FA and with a specificity depending on the type of FABP. Liver FABP was significantly more effective than intestinal FABP in binding 13-HODE in the presence of vesicles. The more effective binding of the FA metabolite, 13-HODE, than its precursor 18:2 by FABP may help protect cellular membranes from potential damage by monohydroxy fatty acids and may contribute a pathway for entry of 13-HODE into the nucleus.

Polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) may also be oxidized to products that are biologically active and act, for example, as potent signal agents. Intracellular fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) may deliver FA to sites of utilization and influence intracellular metabolism and storage (1Glatz J.F.C. Vork M.M. Cistola D.D. Van der Vusse G.J. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1993; 48: 33-41Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). FABP may also deliver oxidized FA to the nucleus where they bind to receptors and modulate gene transcription (2Glatz J.F.C. Börchers T. Spener F. van der Vusse G.J. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1995; 52: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Another possible function of FABP is to bind and protect PUFA from oxidation, which may in turn regulate PUFA metabolism (3Ek B.A. Cistola D.P. Kaduce T.L Spector A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1346: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Moreover, the toxic effects of oxidative intermediates of lipid peroxidation might be reduced by this interaction (3Ek B.A. Cistola D.P. Kaduce T.L Spector A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1346: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In general it is considered important to minimize the possibility of oxidation of polyunsaturated FA to undesirable monohydroxy FA. Such oxidative products are 13-hydroxy octadecadienoic acid (13-HODE) from linoleic acid (18:2) and 15-hydroxy eicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) from arachidonic acid (20:4). These metabolites are formed by free radical processes that include the formation of intermediate lipid hydroperoxides, which may have adverse effects on the functions of cellular membranes (10Yamamoto S. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1991; 10: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In type II diabetes and atherosclerosis increased amounts of peroxidized FA have been detected (4Sundaram R.K. Bhaskar A. Vijayalingam S. Viswanathan M. Mohan R. Shanmugassundarm K.R. Clin. Sci. ( London ). 1996; 90: 255-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), and such metabolic changes seem to be functionally important for the outcome of cardiovascular disease (5Van der Vusse G.J. Glatz J.F.C. Stam H.C.G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 88: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Eicosanoids and lipid peroxidation products derived from PUFA in oxidized low density lipoprotein are activators of peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) and may thus act as downstream regulators of foam cell formation (6Yu K.

Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1563) Google Scholar), and lipoxygenase metabolites of arachidonic acid and peroxidation products of PUFA, such as 15-15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid, bind with higher affinity to liver FABP (L-FABP) than oleic acid (8Raza H. Pongubala J.R. Sorof S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Com. 1989; 161: 448-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Prostaglandin E1 also binds specifically and rapidly to L-FABP (9Dutta-Roy A.K. Gopalswamy N. Trulzsch D.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 162: 615-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The mechanism(s) by which FA cross the plasma membrane of mammalian cells are the subject of active investigation and debate (11Abumrad N. Harmon C. Ibrahimi A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2309-2318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hamilton J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 467-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A key question for understanding the cellular effects of oxidized FA is whether they can partition into a membrane and cross the membrane without a specialized mechanism. If FA metabolites can quickly exit the cell, they could bind to serum albumin, which would facilitate their removal from cells. Inside the cell, binding to FABP could sequester some of the oxidized FA, also protecting the cell membranes and possibly transporting them to nuclear targets. Therefore, we investigated whether FA metabolites were able to diffuse across a phospholipid bilayer membrane and how effectively albumin and FABP can bind these molecules in the presence of model membranes. Lauric acid (12:0), palmitic acid (16:0), oleic acid (18:1), linoleic acid (18:2), arachidonic acid (20:4), 13-HODE, 15(s)-HETE (active form), pentaenoic acid (20:5), docosapentaenoic acid (22:5), and docosahexaenoic acid (22:6) were obtained from Cayman Chemicals (Ann Arbor, MI). Sephadex G25 was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The fluorescence pH probe, pyranin, was from Eastman Kodak Co.. BSA (FA-free, fraction V) was from Sigma. Distilled water was further treated with a Millipore purification apparatus. Molecular weights used for calculations are as follows: BSA, 66,200; I-FABP, 15,200; rat l-FABP, 14,200; and rat cellular retinoic acid binding protein II, 15,000 (13Richeri G.V. Ogata R.T.

Small (∼25 nm) unilamellar vesicles (SUV) were prepared from 45 mg of egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) (Avanti Polar Lipids, Pelham, AL) containing the fluorescence probe (pH indicator) pyranin (16Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11074-11085Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 17Zhang F. Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 35: 16055-16060Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 18Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11928-11937Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). 100 mm (pH 7.4) Hepes/KOH and 10 mm pyranin were added to a dry film of PC. After the suspension was soaked overnight in the cold room, it was vortexed and sonicated for 60 min with a microtip Branson sonicator (power level 3, 30% duty cycle, kept on ice under nitrogen). After low speed centrifugation, SUV were separated from the extravesicular pyranin on a Sephadex G25 column (4.3 g, medium grade, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Large (∼100 nm) unilamellar vesicles (LUV) were prepared by extrusion (18Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11928-11937Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Chemical analysis of such vesicle preparations shows a low content of FA (< 1.0 mol% with respect to PC). Fluorescence measurements were performed with a Hitachi F2000 fluorimeter using a cuvette with a magnetic stirrer at room temperature. The suspension of PC vesicles (0.51 mmol/SUV sample; 3.5 mmol/LUV) with entrapped pyranin was diluted to 2.0 ml in 100 mm Hepes/KOH buffer (pH 7.4). External pH was determined with a pH minielectrode (Microelectrode, Londonderry, NH), and internal pH (pHin) was determined by pyranin fluorescence (exitation wavelength, 455 nm; emission wavelength, 509 nm). Aliquots of 0.5 μl of FA in ethanol were added to buffer containing PC vesicles. Eight volumes of 0.5-μl ethanol added at the same time intervals showed no effect on the SUV fluorescence. The relation between pHinand pyranin fluorescence was calibrated as described (16Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11074-11085Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The effectiveness of proteins to bind FA was measured as the reduction in the amount of FA that partitions into the phospholipid bilayer and is detected by pyranin after it undergoes transbilayer movement (TRBM). Quantitatively, this was expressed by a TRBM50 value and was calculated from the Schild equation, log (DR − 1) = log [B] − log TRBM (DR = dose ratio, B = concentration of BSA), where DR = (IC50(BSA)/IC50 (control). By plotting log DR − 1versus the log concentration of BSA, each shift of the curve to the right following the addition of one BSA concentration can be determined. The relationship between the four BSA concentrations was plotted, and the linear regression line was extrapolated to thex axis. The intercept shows the TRBM50 value, which is the DR at which 50% of the FA was bound to BSA and therefore represents a calculation performed at the equilibrium concentration between FA and BSA. A high TRBM50 indicates that more BSA was used to reduce transmembrane transport of FA, which reflects weaker binding of the FA to BSA. To quantitate the distribution of FA between SUV and protein, the partition coefficient was calculated. The relative concentrations of FA bound to the vesicle and to the protein were obtained from pHin in SUV measured in the absence and in the presence of protein. The partition coefficient was calculated as FAvesicle/vesicletotal/FAprotein/proteintotal(16Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11074-11085Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Transbilayer movement of FA across a phospholipid bilayer was investigated by a method based on the fluorescence of the pH dye pyranin trapped inside vesicles (16Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11074-11085Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Fig.1 compares results in SUV from three unsaturated FA, 18:1, 20:4, and 22:6. Immediately after addition to SUV all FA gave a rapid decrease in fluorescence that was complete within 1–2 s, the time resolution of the experiment, in accordance with previous results for 18:1 and other FA not studied here (16Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11074-11085Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The same results were obtained upon addition of 18:1, 20:4, and 22:6 to LUV with low curvature (data not shown). The decrease in fluorescence is directly proportional to a decrease in pHin; this reflects movement of un-ionized FA to the inner leaflet of the membrane (“flip-flop”) after binding of the FA to the external leaflet. The extent of the fluorescence (pHin) decrease was similar for all three FA, reflecting equivalent partitioning of FA from the aqueous phase, where they are poorly soluble, into the vesicles. In a second protocol, aliquots of 1 nmol of FA (18:2) were added to the suspension of vesicles in 10-s intervals for a total time interval of 70 s (Fig.2 A). A decrease in fluorescence (pHin) occurred rapidly following each addition of 18:2, as reported previously (3Ek B.A. Cistola D.P. Kaduce T.L Spector A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1346: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 B, the monohydroxy metabolite of 18:2, 13-HODE, also exhibited flip-flop within the time resolution of the measurement. A similar result was obtained for 15-HETE (not shown). In all experiments, the successive additions caused gradually smaller decreases in fluorescence (pHin), as predicted because of the increasing acidification of the vesicle internal volume (16Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11074-11085Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). All FA in this study, including those examined by the protocols of Figs. 2and 3, showed rapid flip-flop.Figure 3Effect of BSA on the decrease in pHin caused by addition of 18:2 to SUV.

Fig. 2compares parallel experiments with 18:2 and 13-HODE (similar experiments with 18:2 have been published before; see Ref. 3Ek B.A. Cistola D.P. Kaduce T.L Spector A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1346: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Addition of BSA to the external buffer increased the pH inside the vesicle, as a consequence of desorption of FA from the outer leaflet of the SUV to bind to BSA and replenishment of FA by net movement of FA from the inner to the outer leaflet. The increase in pHin was rapid, reflecting rapid desorption of the FA from the vesicle (17Zhang F. Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 35: 16055-16060Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar) to albumin binding sites and rapid re-equilibration of un-ionized FA across the bilayer. As observed before (16Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11074-11085Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), BSA binds endogenous FA in SUV, causing an overshoot of the pHin. Fig. 2 A shows that when a total of 2 nmol of BSA was added, the drop in fluorescence (pHin) was more than recovered. Fig. 2 B shows that each addition of 13-HODE produced a smaller drop in fluorescence (pHin) compared with the addition of equivalent amounts of 18:2. This is likely a reflection of weaker partitioning of 13-HODE into the PC bilayer. From the illustrated experiment, binding of 18:2 to BSA appeared to be the same as for 13-HODE to BSA (Fig. 2). To obtain more quantitative data about the effectiveness of BSA in binding FA in the presence of vesicles, we modified the protocol used in Fig. 2. In this case a given amount of BSA was added to the external buffer of the SUV suspension prior to the addition of FA. Then the percentage drop in fluorescence (pHin) following addition of a given FA, in the presence of different concentrations of BSA, was calculated (Fig. 3). The curve to the left represents the fluorescence (pHin) drop with addition of FA in the absence of BSA, and the four curves shifted to the right the fluorescence (pHin) drop with different amounts (1–4 nmol) of BSA. With increasing BSA concentration the percentage drop in fluorescence (pHin) decreased at a given FA concentration. From a plot of the log of the dose ratio of IC50 (BSA)/IC50(control) − 1 versus the log of the BSA concentration, the intercept with the abscissa was obtained from the regression line. We have designated this value (see “Methods”) the TRBM50 value (Table I).Table IPartitioning of FA between BSA and phospholipid vesicles: effect of BSA on the transbilayer movement constant of various FAFatty AcidTRBM50μmLauric acid (12:0)6.5 (1)Palmitic acid (16:0)6.2 (1)Oleic acid (18:1, n-6)2.0 (2)Linoleic acid (18:2, n-6)2.0 ± 0.07 (3)Arachidonic acid (20:4, n-6)2.0 (2)Pentaenoic acid (20:5, n-3)2.0 (2)Docosapentaenoic acid (22:5, n-6)1.6 (2)Monohydroxy fatty acid13-HODE (18:2-OH, n-6)4.0 (2)15-HETE (20:4-OH, n-6)4.0 (1)The inhibitory transbilayer movement constant, TRBM50 value, of each fatty acid to BSA was determined from experiments as illustrated in Fig. 3 for 18:2.

Open table in a new tab The inhibitory transbilayer movement constant, TRBM50 value, of each fatty acid to BSA was determined from experiments as illustrated in Fig. 3 for 18:2. Following the addition of several concentrations of BSA the TRBM50 value was estimated from a Schild analysis (see “Methods”). Each value was determined from addition of 4–6 concentrations of BSA. Values within brackets represent number of experiments. Mean values ± S.D. The same experimental protocols as in Figs. 2 and 3 were performed for several additional FA including lauric (12:0), palmitic (16:0), oleic (18:1), linoleic (18:2), arachidonic (20:4), pentaenoic (20:5), and docosapentaenoic acid (22:5) (Table I). To compare the results of different FA, the TRBM50 value was calculated for each FA. A higher TRBM50 value corresponds to a lower partitioning of FA to the protein. The TRBM50 value generally decreased with increasing FA carbon chain length (Table I) but was not distinguishable for the 18- and 20-carbon FA studied. For the two monohydroxy FA, 15-HETE and 13-HODE, the calculated TRBM50value was about twice that of their respective FA. Thus, twice as much BSA was added to bind 13-HODE and 15-HETE as compared with the respective FA, 20:4 and 18:2, indicating weaker binding of the two monohydroxy FA to BSA (Table I). As a further analysis of our data, we calculated the partition coefficient (see “Methods”) for FA between BSA and SUV. The data for 18:2 can be analyzed as two regions, one with a small slope at low mole ratios and the other with a larger slope at high mole ratios. The intersection of the two linear portions occurs at ∼3.0 mol of 18:2/BSA and is interpreted, as before (16Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11074-11085Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), as the number of high affinity sites for 18:2. After the high affinity sites are filled, the partitioning to SUV increases at a higher rate. By comparison, there is no detectable break in the plot for 13-HODE, and the slope of the single line is about the same as for 18:2. This predicts that there are fewer high affinity sites for 13-HODE than for 18:2 and other long chain FA. Furthermore, partitioning of 13-HODE compared with 18:2 favors the SUV at all FA/BSA ratios except <0.5, where the scatter in the data are too great to distinguish the two FA. Oxidized FA generated inside the cell could bind to membranes and FABP. To determine the partitioning of FA between a phospholipid bilayer and FABP, experiments were done as in Fig. 2, and the fluorescence (pHin) was used to monitor the amount of FA bound to SUV. Because only limited amounts of FABP were available as compared with BSA, a lower concentration of FA was used. The values shown in TableII therefore represent TRBM rather than the TRBM50 determined from multiple experiments with BSA (Table I). In this case the amount of protein required to inhibit TRBM by 50% of 1 nmol FA across SUV was calculated (Table II).Table IIPartitioning of FA between proteins and phospholipid vesicles: the amount of protein (nmol) required to reduce flip-flop by 50% in the presence of a constant FA concentration (1 nmol)13-HODE18:218:1I-FABP1.3 ± 0.091.5 ± 0.42.2 ± 0.7L-FABP0.4 ± 0.21.0 ± 0.30.9 ± 0.06BSA0.3 ± 0.10.2 ± 0.020.2 ± 0.03Mean values ± S.D., n = 2. Open table in a new tab Mean values ± S.D., n = 2. In comparing the flip-flop of the FA in SUV in the presence of BSA, the value for 13-HODE revealed a weaker affinity compared with 18:1 and 18:2, as shown also by the data from Fig.4. The flip-flop (Table II) for 13-HODE was only slightly lower for BSA as compared for L-FABP. Fig. 5 compares the pHin changes after addition of 18:2 and 13-HODE followed by addition of L-FABP. About 5 nmol L-FABP was used to completely recover the drop in fluorescence (pHin) achieved by addition of 3 nmol 18:2 (Fig. 5 A), but only 2 nmol of L-FABP was used to recover the effect of 4 nmol 13-HODE (Fig.5 B). This comparison demonstrates a higher affinity of L-FABP for 13-HODE than for 18:2 in the presence of a model membrane. Similar experiments were performed with I-FABP. The amounts of L-FABP, I-FABP, and BSA used to decrease the binding and transport in SUV by 50% for a specific amount of FA (1 nmol) are shown in Table II. We found a higher value for I-FABP and a smaller difference between 18:2 and 13-HODE compared with L-FABP. BSA had significantly lower values for 18:1 and 18:2 compared with both FABP. The cellular retinoic acid binding protein II had no effect on flip-flop with any of the FA (data not shown). Addition of BSA or FABP protein to the SUV preparation resulted in a small increase in fluorescence, indicating binding of contaminating free FA in the SUV. We studied the transport of several polyunsaturated FA and oxidized FA across phospholipid vesicles with a single bilayer encapsulating a fluorescent pH dye. Fluorescence measurements quantitated the effectiveness of FABP and BSA in recovering the FA-induced decrease in pHin. Because the FA diffused rapidly across the bilayer and desorbed rapidly from the phospholipid membrane, the extent of the recovery of pHin after addition of protein was related directly to the ability of the protein to bind each FA. Although our study did not mimic the full complexity of cell membranes, it is more relevant to cell physiology than an assay in aqueous media, because the lipophilic FA molecules will bind extensively to the lipid bilayer in biological membranes. Previously we described a diffusion pathway in simple model membranes and in cells based on pH effects associated with FA flip-flop (18Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11928-11937Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In the present study we examined the transmembrane movement of several FA not previously studied with the pyranin assay, 20:4, 20:5, 22:5, and 22:6 and the peroxidation products, 13-HODE and 15-HETE. Although these FA have increased water solubility compared with their saturated counterparts, they are still highly hydrophobic molecules and bind mainly to the lipid (membrane) phase in an aqueous suspension of phospholipid vesicles, as shown by the decrease in pHin. The PUFA caused the same decrease in pHin as oleic acid, when equal amounts of each FA were added to vesicles, indicating equivalent partitioning. Among the FA studied, a significant decrease in partitioning into vesicles in buffer (without added protein) was observed only for 13-HODE and 15-HETE. All FA studied caused an immediate and rapid decrease in pHin after their addition to vesicles (SUV or LUV). Thus, the PUFA precursors for oxidized FA and the 13-HODE and 15-HETE can likely enter (and exit) a cell by simple diffusion without a transporter protein. This could represent a mechanism whereby peroxides of FA exit the cell spontaneously and rapidly to act as inducers for low density lipoprotein oxidation in the extracellular matrix. Although a recent study suggested that certain monohydroxy saturated FA cannot flip-flop (19Jezek P. Modriansky M. Garild K.D. Febs Lett. 1997; 408: 161-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), our results for 13-HODE and 15-HETE are in accord with NMR (20Cabral D.J. Small D.M. Lilly H.S. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1801-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) and fluorescence spectroscopy (16Kamp F. Hamilton J.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11074-11085Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) experiments that showed fast flip-flop of mono- and dihydroxy bile acids across phospholipid membranes. The rapid flip-flop rates of polyunsaturated FA are consistent with the interpretations of the kinetics of transfer of polyunsaturated FA from phospholipid vesicles (21Massey J.B. Bick D.H. Pownall H.J. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 1732-1743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To determine the effectiveness of albumin in removing FA from membranes and to provide comparative data for FABP experiments, we used BSA as an acceptor of FA in bilayer membranes. BSA was able to remove all FA species examined from membranes with a relative effectiveness quantified as the TRBM50 (Table I). The TRBM50was the same or nearly so for all unsaturated FA, indicating an equivalent partitioning of these FA between albumin and membranes;i.e. the ratio of binding constants for each FA with BSA or vesicles alone is the same. The equilibrium constants for binding of saturated FA to phospholipid bilayers (22Peitzsch R.M. McLaughlin S. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10436-10443Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar) or to albumin alone (23Ashbrook J.D. Spector A.A. Santos E.C. Fletcher J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 2333-2338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) decrease with decreasing chain length. Our results reflect a relatively greater decrease in the binding to BSA, shifting the partition coefficient more in favor of the membrane. The oxidized FA showed an even greater partitioning to the membrane and less effective binding to albumin compared with the PUFA. Differential binding of 18:2 and its metabolite 13-HODE was revealed by the data analysis of Fig.4, which showed higher partitioning of 18:2 to BSA at all mole ratios of FA except possibly at low mole ratios (<0.5), where the data were indeterminate. FABP are small (∼15 kDa) intracellular proteins with a single binding site for FA, except for L-FABP, which has two binding sites for FA (24Glatz J.F.C. Luiken J.J.F.P. van Nieuwenhoven F.A. Van der Vusse G.J. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1997; 57: 3-9Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). As shown in Table II, 13-HODE partitioned more favorably than 18:1 or 18:2 to I-FABP and L-FABP. All three ligands showed better binding to L-FABP compared with I-FABP. The results for 18:2 and 13-HODE provide evidence that a metabolite of a FA can bind better to cytosolic FABP than its precursor FA. On the basis of displacement of oleic acid from FABP, Veerkamp and Maatman (25Veerkamp J.H. Maatman R.G.H.J. Prog. Lip. Res. 1995; 34: 17-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar) found that certain prostaglandins, which are more polar than 15-HETE and 13-HODE, bound to both I-FABP and L-FABP with about the same affinity as FA; L-FABP was much more effective in binding prostaglandins than muscle FABP, which is more closely related to I-FABP. The partitioning experiments summarized in Table II can be discussed in terms of affinities of the proteins for the different ligands, as the membrane component was constant in all cases. The finding that the affinity of BSA for 13-HODE is lower than for 18:1 or 18:2 can be rationalized by reference to the structures of binding sites (30Cistola D.P. Small D.M. Hamilton J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10980-10985Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Curry S. Mandelkow H. Brick P. Franks N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). It is likely that the hydroxylated FA have less stable interactions in the FA high affinity sites and are relegated to lower affinity sites for FA, possibly the flexible site in the middle of albumin that binds diverse ligands such as bile acids and bilirubin with high affinity (31Curry S. Mandelkow H. Brick P. Franks N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). In contrast to the α-helical, multiple domain structure of albumin, FABP consists of a β-barrel lined with both hydrophobic and polar-charged amino acids. In I-FABP, which has a high specificity for FA, a single FA molecule is buried inside the binding cavity (32Sacchettini J.C. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18399-18402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Zhang F. Lücke C. Baier L.J. Sacchettini J.C. Hamilton J.A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1997; 9: 213-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). L-FABP is capable of binding two FA molecules, as well as other ligands (34Thompson J. Winter N. Terway D. Bratt J. Banazak L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7140-7150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Ileal lipid binding protein, another member of the same family, binds bile acids with one or more OH groups with higher affinity than FA (35Sacchettini J.C. Hauft S.M. Van Camp S.L. Cistola D.P. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 19199-19207Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Lücke C. Zhang F. Rüterjans Heinz Hamilton J.A. Sacchettini J.C. Structure. 1996; 4: 785-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus it is predictable that FABP could bind hydroxylated FA such as 15-HETE and 13-HODE as well or better than FA and that L-FABP could show a higher affinity for these ligands than I-FABP. It is interesting to note that the partitioning of 13-HODE to L-FABP is almost indistinguishable from BSA (Table II). Our study yielded the following important findings: (i) PUFA and the hydroxylated products 13-HODE and 15-HETE adsorb rapidly to a phospholipid bilayer, and the un-ionized form of the FA diffuses rapidly across the bilayer by the flip-flop mechanism; (ii) all FA desorb from the phospholipid bilayer rapidly to bind to BSA, which shows a preference for the unsaturated FA over the oxidized FA; (iii) all FA desorb from the phospholipid bilayer to bind to FABP, which shows a preference of oxidized FA over the unsaturated FA and a specificity depending on the type of FABP. The interactions of oxFA such as 13-HODE and 15-HETE (and their FA precursors) with membranes, intracellular FABP, and albumin must therefore be considered to understand their biological effects and metabolism. Extrapolation of these and previous results with simple model systems to cells show that a complex relationship might exist between FABPs and intracellular oxidative metabolism of FA. Intracellular oxidation of PUFA could be decreased by their binding to FABP (3Ek B.A. Cistola D.P. Kaduce T.L Spector A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1346: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and binding protects the product from further degradation and cell membranes from effects of oxidized FA. It is also possible that membrane-associated proteins, including those described as “transporters” (11Abumrad N. Harmon C. Ibrahimi A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 2309-2318Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Hamilton J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1998; 39: 467-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), could protect membranes by binding and sequestering oxFA. Binding of 13-HODE to FABP could also influence the interactions of HODE with nuclear targets, such as PPARγ. 13-HODE can be formed in the cytosol or can be internalized together with lipoproteins by the CD36 receptor (26Nagy L. Tontonoz P. Alvarez J.G.A. Chen H. Evans R.M. Cell. 1998; 93: 229-240Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1496) Google Scholar). In the absence of binding to FABP, 13-HODE could diffuse as a monomer to the nuclear membrane, where it could bind and then desorb and diffuse as a monomer to PPARγ. However, binding to FABP will enhance diffusion of 13-HODE to intracellular sites (27Vork M.M. Glatz J.F.C. Van Der Vusse G.J. J. Therm. Biol. 1993; 160: 207-222Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar), and the HODE·FABP complex can enter the nucleus through the nuclear pore and potentially interact directly with PPAR. Such a concept has been proposed previously (2Glatz J.F.C. Börchers T. Spener F. van der Vusse G.J. Prostaglandins Leukotrienes Essent. Fatty Acids. 1995; 52: 121-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), and phytanic acid has been shown to bind to L-FABP and act as a transcriptional activator of L-FABP via activation of PPARα (29Wolfrum C. Ellinghaus P. Fobker M. Seedorf U. Assmann G. Börchers T. Spener F. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 708-714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In considering potential roles of FABP in transporting oxFA, it is important to consider that only a minor fraction of intracellular FABP is complexed with FA under normal cellular conditions; most FA is bound to cell membranes (27Vork M.M. Glatz J.F.C. Van Der Vusse G.J. J. Therm. Biol. 1993; 160: 207-222Crossref Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, FABP could bind oxFA without displacement of the highly abundant typical FA. A protective role of FABP in ischemia of intestinal (38Nielsen S.U. Spener F. J. Lipid Res. 1993; 34: 1355-1366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 1iver (37Nemecz G. Schroeder F. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17180-17186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and myocardial tissue (28Glatz J.F. Paulusen R.J. Veerkamp J.H. Chem. Phys. Lip. 1995; 38: 115-129Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar) has been suggested, although precise mechanisms were not established. The role of L-FABP in binding oxFA may be particularly important in cells where it is abundant, which are the liver, stomach, small intestines, and kidney. The roles of FABP in binding oxFA suggested by our study may be important in diseases related to increased lipid peroxidation and altered utilization of FA, such as insulin resistance and atherosclerosis. The intracellular concentration and type of FABP could regulate their binding to membranes and their transport to the nucleus. We kindly thank Dr. Arthur A.

Structural analysis of MMP-inhibitor complexes has mainly focused on the study of the interactions of the catalytic domains of the enzyme with sulfonamide or hydroxamic acid derivatives as zinc-cheating ligands (7Betz M.

Chem. 1999; 42: 1723-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Most of the synthetic inhibitors are designed to provide a bidentate chelating ligand to the catalytic zinc ion. It is a general trend that these metal chelators largely lack selectivity in inhibition of MMPs. This complicates the possibility for targeting specific members of the MMP family in a particular pathological condition. A recent report by Brown et al. (1Brown S. Margarida B. Li Z. Korta L.P. Tanaka Y. Fridman R. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 6799-6800Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar) described a novel concept for the selective inhibition of gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) by the design and synthesis of the first mechanism-based MMP inhibitor (“suicide substrate”) for any MMP. This small molecule inhibitor, designated SB-3CT, provides a potent and highly selective inhibition of human gelatinases by the manifestation of both slow binding and mechanism-based inhibition behavior in its kinetic profile (1Brown S. Margarida B. Li Z. Korta L.P. Tanaka Y. Fridman R. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 6799-6800Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the mechanism of inhibition of MMP-2 by SB-3CT and the local structure around the catalytic zinc ion in latent, active, and inhibited MMP-2, the zinc ion coordination shell in all complexes was studied by x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Our results show that the catalytic zinc ion is directly coordinated to the sulfur atom of the bound inhibitor in a monodentate manner to form a tetrahedral coordination at the zinc ion. Interestingly, the inhibited enzyme retains the conformation of the latent MMP-2 around the zinc coordination shell, which may explain the remarkable selectivity of SB-3CT for gelatinases for which it was designed. Human pro-MMP-2 was expressed in a recombinant vaccinia virus mammalian cell expression system, as described earlier (21Fridman R. Furest T.R. Bird R.E. Hoyhtya M. Oelkuct M. Kraus S. Komarek D. Liotta L.A. Berman M.L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15398-15405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Pro-MMP-2 was purified to homogeneity from the media of infected HeLa cells by gelatin-agarose affinity chromatography, as described previously (21Fridman R. Furest T.R. Bird R.E. Hoyhtya M. Oelkuct M. Kraus S. Komarek D. Liotta L.A. Berman M.L. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15398-15405Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration of proMMP-2 was determined using the molar extinction coefficient of 122,800m − 1 cm− 1(22Murphy G. Crabbet T. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 248: 470-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) and amino acid analysis. Pro-MMP-2 was activated by 1 mm p-aminophenylmercuric acetate (dissolved in 200 mm Tris) for 30 min at 37 °C. The protein concentration of the active MMP-2 was determined by titration with TIMP-2, as described previously (23Olson M.W. Bernardo M.M. Pietila M. Gervasi D.C. Kotra L.P. Massova I. Mobashery S. Fridman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2661-2668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The synthetic mechanism-based inhibitor was synthesized for these studies as described earlier (1Brown S. Margarida B. Li Z. Korta L.P. Tanaka Y. Fridman R. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 6799-6800Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). MMP-2 was inhibited for our studies according to the procedure that has been reported previously (1Brown S. Margarida B. Li Z. Korta L.P. Tanaka Y. Fridman R. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 6799-6800Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The metal content in MMP-2 samples was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy using the ICP-AES model “Spectroflame” from Spectro (Kleve, Germany). Prior to measurement, the samples were digested with nitric acid, and the volume was adjusted to 6 ml (final concentration 10%). The zinc content in the protein samples was determined relative to an equivalent amount of the enzyme assay buffer. All enzyme samples were subjected to gelatin zymography before XAS data collection. The enzyme was concentrated by ultrafiltration using a Millipore Centricon-30 (Bedford, MA) device to make a final concentration of 10 mg/ml. Samples were loaded into copper sample holders (10 × 5 × 0.5 mm) covered with Mylar tape and were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. The frozen samples were then mounted inside a Displex closed-cycle helium cryostat, and the temperature was maintained at 30 K, to minimize the thermal disorder in the XAS data. XAS data collection was performed at the National Synchrotron Light Source at Brookhaven National Laboratory, beam line X9B. The spectra were recorded at the zinc K-edge in fluorescence geometry at low temperature (30 K). The beam energy was defined using a flat Si(111) monochromator crystal. The incident beam intensity I0 was recorded using an ionization chamber. The fluorescence intensity was recorded using a 13-element germanium detector. The transmission signal from a zinc foil was measured with a reference ion chamber simultaneously with fluorescence to calibrate the beam energy. Several scans of each sample were collected for a total of 1 × 106 counts across the edge. The samples were checked for burning marks after each scan, and the beam position on the sample was changed before each scan to minimize radiation damages. The average zinc K-edge absorption coefficient μ(E), which was obtained after 10–12 independent XAS measurements for each sample, was aligned using the first inflection point of a reference zinc metal foil XAS data (9659 eV). Subsequently, the absorption coefficients for different samples were shifted in x-ray energy until their first inflection points were aligned at the same energy. The smooth atomic background was removed with the AUTOBK program of the UWXAFS data analysis package, developed at the University of Washington, Seattle (24Stern E.A. Newville M. Ravel B. Yacoby Y. Haskel D. Physica B. 1995; 208 & 209: 117-122Crossref Scopus (919) Google Scholar). The same energy, E0 = 9659 eV, was chosen for the purpose of background removal as the origin of the photoelectron energy. The R-space region for minimizing the signal below the first shell was chosen between 1.2 and 3 Å. After the removal of background, the useful k-range in the resultantk 2-weighted χ(k) was between 2.0 and 9 Å− 1. Model data for the fitting procedure were constructed by extracting the catalytic zinc site coordinates (in a radius of 6 Å from the crystallographic coordinates of gelatinase A (RCSB Protein Data Bank Code 1CK7). Using the computer code FEFF7 (25Rehr J.J. Mustre de leon J. Zabinsky S.I. Albers R.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1991; 113: 5135-5138Crossref Scopus (1808) Google Scholar, 26Zabinsky S.I. Rehr J.J. Ankudinov A. Albers R.C. Eller M.J. Phys. Rev. B. 1995; 52: 2995-2999Crossref PubMed Scopus (2645) Google Scholar), we calculated the theoretical photoelectron scattering amplitudes and phase shifts. Total theoretical χ(k) was constructed by adding the most important partial χ(k) values that contributed to ther-range of interest. The theoretical XAFS signal was fitted to the experimental data using the nonlinear least squares method, implemented in the program FEFFIT (24Stern E.A. Newville M. Ravel B. Yacoby Y. Haskel D. Physica B. 1995; 208 & 209: 117-122Crossref Scopus (919) Google Scholar) in R-space, by Fourier transforming both theory and data. Data and theory were weighted by k and multiplied by a Hanning window function in Fourier transforms. X-ray crystal structure of MMP-2 (RCSB Protein Data Bank Code1CK7) was used to model the inhibitor in the active site of MMP-2 as well as to model the covalent complex between the inhibitor and MMP-2. The point charges on the inhibitor molecule were MNDO electrostatic potential charges, and the charge on the zinc was +1.62. 2L. P. Kotra, Y. Shimura, R. Fridman, H. B. Schlegel, and S. Mobashery, unpublished results. The same charge on the zinc ion was used in the covalent complex and the noncovalent complex. The inhibitor molecule was docked into the active site of MMP-2 by fitting the biphenyl moiety into the S1′ pocket. The complex, including crystallographic water molecules, was solvated using TIP3 water molecules in a box of 10-Å thicknesses from the surface of the enzyme. The entire complex was energy-minimized for 2500 iterations using AMBER 6.0 (28Case D.A. Pearlman D.A. Caldwell J.W. Cheatham III, T.E. Ross W.S. Simmerling C.L. Darden T.A. Merz K.M. Stanton R.

University of California, San Francisco, CA1999Google Scholar). In the case of the covalent complex, a bond between the zinc ion and the thiirane sulfur, and a bond between Glu404 and the methylene moiety of the thiirane ring, were defined. This complex was energy-minimized as described above. Only one enantiomer of the thiirane inhibitor is shown in Fig. 4, although we carried out energy minimizations with both stereoisomers. Given the importance of the zinc ion in the proenzyme latency and in catalysis by the mature enzyme, quantitative analyses of the zinc stoichiometry in MMPs have given puzzling results (29Salowe S.P.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8500-8507Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Direct measurements of the zinc ion content in various MMPs show variations between 1 and 2 equivalents of metal ions per enzyme. Studies by Willenbrock et al. (34Willenbrock F. Murphy G. Phillips I.R. Brocklehurst K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), Springman et al. (33Springman E.B. Nagase H. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15713-15720Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and recently by Kleifeld et al. (32Kleifeld O. Van den Steen P. Frenkel A. Cheng F. Jiang H. Opdenakker G. Sagi I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34335-34343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) suggest that full-length intact MMPs (for the ones tested) contain a single zinc ion, while truncated enzymes (lacking the C-terminal domain) contain two zinc ions. In addition, it was suggested that the zinc content in MMPs might be dependent on the procedure used for enzyme purification (32Kleifeld O. Van den Steen P. Frenkel A. Cheng F. Jiang H. Opdenakker G. Sagi I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34335-34343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 33Springman E.B. Nagase H. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15713-15720Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the crystal structure of an inactive full-length pro-MMP-2 mutant clearly shows the presence of both structural and catalytic zinc ion sites (13Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Isupov M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Tryggvason K. Science. 1999; 284: 1667-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The zinc content in our protein preparation has been determined by ICP-AES and XAS. The ICP-AES analysis gave a zinc stoichiometry of 1.93 ± 0.1 zinc ions per protein, as determined in four separate determinations. The zinc-protein ratio was further investigated by XAS edge step analysis following previous procedures (32Kleifeld O. Van den Steen P. Frenkel A. Cheng F. Jiang H. Opdenakker G. Sagi I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34335-34343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, the edge step of the XAS coefficient should be proportional to the concentration of the absorbing element. Therefore, the number of zinc ions per protein can be determined by comparing the edge step intensity measured in the enzyme absorption coefficient data with an edge step calibration curve obtained for standard compounds, where the edge step is measured as a function of zinc concentration. This calibration curve is linear throughout its range where linearity in the lower concentrations of the calibration curve was obtained by extrapolating the line to zero. To obtain the estimated concentration of zinc ion in the enzyme as measured by XAS, we crossed the experimental edge step intensity value of recombinant human pro-MMP-2 with the calibration curve. The concentration of zinc ion obtained by this analysis was 1.75 ± 0.05 zinc ions per enzyme (data not shown). The results obtained from the ICP-AES and XAS support the presence of two zinc ions per enzyme molecule. Similar ICP studies on the full-length recombinant pro-MMP-2 (purified from NSO mouse myeloma cells) showed a one-to-one ratio for zinc ion and protein (34Willenbrock F. Murphy G. Phillips I.R. Brocklehurst K. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), as opposed to two-to-one ratio reported by x-ray crystallography (13Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Isupov M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Tryggvason K. Science. 1999; 284: 1667-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Based on our studies of the natural human pro-MMP-9 (where only one zinc ion per protein was found), we cannot rule out the possibility that the zinc ion content in MMPs is dependent on the overall stability of the enzyme and the purification procedures. Nevertheless, we have treated our x-ray structural analysis with two zinc ions according to the stoichimetric ratio seen in the preparation used in this study. The active site structures of the catalytic zinc ion in the recombinant human MMP-2 in its latent, active, and inhibited states were studied by x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), and by XAFS spectroscopy. XAFS refers to modulations in x-ray absorption coefficient around an x-ray absorption edge of a given atom. XAFS is divided into EXAFS (extended x-ray absorption fine structure) and XANES that provide complementary information. EXAFS is a valuable technique for elucidating the structure of a variety of metal-binding sites in metalloproteins (36Scott R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 117: 414-458Crossref Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Information available from XAFS includes average bond distances, mean square variation in distance, coordination numbers, and atomic species. Fig. 1 shows the proposed mechanism for inhibition of gelatinases by the mechanism-based inhibitor (adopted from Brown et al. (1Brown S. Margarida B. Li Z. Korta L.P. Tanaka Y. Fridman R. Mobashery S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 6799-6800Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar)). Fig. 2 shows the normalized raw x-ray absorption edge spectra of recombinant human MMP-2 in the latent, active, and inhibited states of the enzyme. The proenzyme edge spectrum has three distinct peaks at 9665, 9710, and 9738 eV. Activation of MMP-2 results in a slight increase in peak intensity at 9665 eV and in drastic reduction in peak intensity at 9738 eV. The changes in the spectral features are consistent with the raw x-ray absorption spectra observed for the latent and active natural human MMP-9, respectively (32Kleifeld O. Van den Steen P. Frenkel A. Cheng F. Jiang H. Opdenakker G. Sagi I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34335-34343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Similar to the natural human MMP-9, a slight edge shift to a higher energy is observed upon activation. Interestingly, we observed that MMP-2 in complex with SB-3CT exhibited an edge spectrum similar to that observed with pro-MMP-2 alone with an increase in peak intensity at 9738 eV. In addition, the edge position is shifted back to lower energy and overlaps with the proenzyme edge position. This may indicate that the total atomic charge of the zinc ion in the inhibited enzyme is consistent with the atomic charge of the zinc ion in the proenzyme. Thus, in both the latent and the inhibited active form of the enzyme, a thiolate completes the coordination sphere. The great similarity in XAS features between natural MMP-9, which was shown to have one zinc ion (32Kleifeld O. Van den Steen P. Frenkel A. Cheng F. Jiang H. Opdenakker G. Sagi I. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34335-34343Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and MMP-2 points out to the near identity of the structure around the catalytic zinc ion in both enzymes. In addition, the binding of the inhibitor does not influence the backscattering contribution of the structural zinc. This observation is also supported by the MMP-2-SB-3CT binding ratio.Figure 2Edge spectra of pro, active, and inhibited forms of MMP-2. Normalized raw XAS data in the zinc K-edge region of pro-MMP2 (red), active (green), and MMP-2-SB-3CT complex (black). The overall shape of the edge spectra of the pro and the active enzyme differs. The most distinct feature is the decrease in the peak at 9738 eV at the XANES region upon activation of the enzyme. Interestingly, this peak is restored in the inhibited MMP-2-SB-3CT complex.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further study the structure of the zinc site in the enzyme, we have performed a rigorous EXAFS analysis. EXAFS analyses of MMP-2, in its latent, active, and inhibited states, were conducted by fitting the data to theoretical phase shifts and amplitudes. Theoretical models of the proposed structural and catalytic zinc sites were constructed from the crystal structure of pro-MMP-2 (13Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Isupov M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Tryggvason K. Science. 1999; 284: 1667-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). The crystal structure reports the presence of two zinc ions with proposed catalytic and structural functions. The catalytic zinc ion in pro-MMP-2 is bound to three histidines and one cysteine, whereas the structural zinc ion is bound to three histidines and one aspartate. The theoretical models that were constructed from these sites were used to modulate the catalytic and structural zinc sites of MMP-2 in the latent, active, and inhibited enzyme EXAFS data in our data analysis procedures. The conformational variations at the structural zinc (37Massova I. Kotru L.P. Mobashery S. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1998; 8: 853-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) site were addressed by fitting the zinc site models obtained from the crystallographic data to the raw EXAFS data. Fig. 3, a—c, shows the best fitting results of the EXAFS analysis of the various structures. The fitting parameters and the quality of the fits are listed in Table I. The zinc sites in the various forms of the enzyme were fitted to the Zn-N, Zn-O, Zn-S, and Zn-C paths using different combinations of varied and constraint parameters. In addition, different initial conditions of distances, Debye-Waller factors, and ΔE0 shifts were applied in the fitting procedure. To account for two zinc ions in our fitting procedures, we have used the following strategy. In the first stage, the EXAFS data were fitted to a relevant theoretical model containing only one zinc ion, and in the second stage, the fits were refined by constraining and fixing the structural zinc contributions in the fits and fitting the residual phases and amplitudes with the appropriate model. This procedure was repeated in an iterative way until a stable solution was achieved. Furthermore, final refinement of the data included the repeat of the second stage by fixing the catalytic zinc contributions. Using this fitting procedure allowed us to better estimate the goodness of the fits and to refine the final results. Stable and reproducible fits of pro-MMP-2 (Table IA, Fits 2–3) were consistent with a tetrahedral coordination of the zinc ion with three Zn-N(His) at 2.07 ± 0.03 Å, one Zn-S(Cys) at 2.30 ± 0.03 Å contributions (in the first coordination shell), and seven Zn-C contributions where three Zn-C at 2.87 ± 0.05 Å and four at 3.18 ± 0.04 Å (in the second coordination shell). The zinc-ligand distances derived from our EXAFS analysis for the proenzyme are in agreement (within the experimental error) with the crystal structure (13Morgunova E. Tuuttila A. Bergmann U. Isupov M. Lindqvist Y. Schneider G. Tryggvason K. Science. 1999; 284: 1667-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). Fitting the data to a one zinc site model resulted in a high χ2 and unstable fits (Table IA, Fit 1).Table ICurve fitting analysis of latent, active, and inhibited MMP-2Results of EXAFS curve fitting analysis of pro-MMP-2, (A) active MMP-2 (B), and inhibited MMP-2 complex (C).

We have identified a NSF homologue inPlasmodium falciparum (PfNSF). The reportedPfNSF gene sequence (GenBankTM accession number CAB10575) indicated that PfNSF comprises 783 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight of 89,133. The overall identities of its gene and amino acid sequences with those of rat NSF are 50.9 and 48.8%, respectively. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis and Northern blotting with total P. falciparum RNA indicated expression of the PfNSFgene. Polyclonal antibodies against a conserved region of NSF specifically recognized an 89-kDa polypeptide in the parasite cells. After homogenization of the parasite cells, ∼90% of an 89-kDa polypeptide is associated with particulate fraction, suggesting membrane-bound nature of PfNSF. PfNSF was present within both the parasite cells and the vesicular structure outside of the parasite cells. The export of PfNSF outside of the parasite cells appears to occur at the early trophozoite stage and to terminate at the merozoite stage. The export of PfNSF is inhibited by brefeldin A, with 9 μm causing 50% inhibition. Immunoelectromicroscopy indicated that intracellular PfNSF was associated with organelles such as food vacuoles and that extracellular PfNSF was associated with vesicular structures in the erythrocyte cytoplasm. These results indicate that PfNSF expressed in the malaria parasite is exported to the extracellular space and then localized in intraerythrocytic vesicles in a brefeldin A-sensitive manner. It is suggested that a vesicular transport mechanism is involved in protein export targeted to erythrocyte membranes during intraerythrocytic development of the malaria parasite."
https://openalex.org/W1596361592,"Candida boidinii Pmp20 (CbPmp20), a protein associated with the inner side of peroxisomal membrane, belongs to a recently identified protein family of antioxidant enzymes, the peroxiredoxins, which contain one cysteine residue. Pmp20 homologs containing the putative peroxisome targeting signal type 1 have also been identified in mammals and lower eukaryotes. However, the physiological function of these Pmp20 family proteins has been unclear. In this study, we investigated the biochemical and physiological functions of recombinant CbPmp20 protein in methanol-induced peroxisomes of C. boidinii using thePMP20-deleted strain of C. boidinii(pmp20Δ strain). The His6-tagged CbPmp20 fusion protein was found to have glutathione peroxidase activityin vitro toward alkyl hydroperoxides and H2O2. Catalytic activity and dimerization of His6-CbPmp20 depended on the only cysteine residue corresponding to Cys53. The pmp20Δ strain was found to have lost growth ability on methanol as a carbon and energy source. The pmp20Δ growth defect was rescued by CbPmp20, but neither CbPmp20 lacking the peroxisome targeting signal type 1 sequence nor CbPmp20 haboring the C53S mutation retrieved the growth defect. Interestingly, the pmp20Δ strain had a more severe growth defect than the cta1Δ strain, which lacks catalase, another antioxidant enzyme within the peroxisome. During incubation of these strains in methanol medium, thecta1Δ strain accumulated H2O2, whereas the pmp20Δ strain did not. Therefore, it is speculated to be the main function of CbPmp20 is to decompose reactive oxygen species generated at peroxisomal membrane surface,e.g. lipid hydroperoxides, rather than to decompose H2O2. In addition, we detected a physiological level of reduced glutathione in peroxisomal fraction of C. boidinii. These results may indicate a physiological role for CbPmp20 as an antioxidant enzyme within peroxisomes rich in reactive oxygen species. Candida boidinii Pmp20 (CbPmp20), a protein associated with the inner side of peroxisomal membrane, belongs to a recently identified protein family of antioxidant enzymes, the peroxiredoxins, which contain one cysteine residue. Pmp20 homologs containing the putative peroxisome targeting signal type 1 have also been identified in mammals and lower eukaryotes. However, the physiological function of these Pmp20 family proteins has been unclear. In this study, we investigated the biochemical and physiological functions of recombinant CbPmp20 protein in methanol-induced peroxisomes of C. boidinii using thePMP20-deleted strain of C. boidinii(pmp20Δ strain). The His6-tagged CbPmp20 fusion protein was found to have glutathione peroxidase activityin vitro toward alkyl hydroperoxides and H2O2. Catalytic activity and dimerization of His6-CbPmp20 depended on the only cysteine residue corresponding to Cys53. The pmp20Δ strain was found to have lost growth ability on methanol as a carbon and energy source. The pmp20Δ growth defect was rescued by CbPmp20, but neither CbPmp20 lacking the peroxisome targeting signal type 1 sequence nor CbPmp20 haboring the C53S mutation retrieved the growth defect. Interestingly, the pmp20Δ strain had a more severe growth defect than the cta1Δ strain, which lacks catalase, another antioxidant enzyme within the peroxisome. During incubation of these strains in methanol medium, thecta1Δ strain accumulated H2O2, whereas the pmp20Δ strain did not. Therefore, it is speculated to be the main function of CbPmp20 is to decompose reactive oxygen species generated at peroxisomal membrane surface,e.g. lipid hydroperoxides, rather than to decompose H2O2. In addition, we detected a physiological level of reduced glutathione in peroxisomal fraction of C. boidinii. These results may indicate a physiological role for CbPmp20 as an antioxidant enzyme within peroxisomes rich in reactive oxygen species. The peroxisome is a ubiquitous organelle found in most eukaryotic cells in which various kinds of oxidative metabolism occur through at least one H2O2-generating peroxisomal oxidase (1Subramani S. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 171-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 2Van den Bosch H. Schutgens R.B.H. Wanders R.J.A. Tager J.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1992; 61: 157-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). These oxidative metabolisms yield reactive oxygen species (ROS),1 which can cause damage to all cellular constituents, i.e. nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, etc. In mammalian cells, treatment with peroxisome proliferators or constitutive expression of peroxisomal oxidases (acyl-CoA oxidase and urate oxidase) were shown to result in neoplastic transformation (3Yeldandi A.V. Rao M.S. Reddy J.K. Mutat. Res. 2000; 448: 159-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and these and other studies indicate that ROS generation within peroxisomes is related to carcinogenesis. The peroxisomal matrix and membranes are assumed to be exposed to a high level of ROS. Therefore, as in other ROS-generating organelles, such as mitochondria (4Raha S. Robinson B.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar), peroxisomes are assumed to have defensive enzyme activities against ROS toxicity (5Singh I. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1996; 804: 612-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). One such activity is peroxisomal catalase, which decomposes H2O2. It is distributed from lower to higher organisms, and as such, it is also used as a marker enzyme for peroxisomes. In mammalian peroxisomes, two other antioxidant enzymes are also present, i.e. superoxide dismutase (6Keller G. Warner T.G. Steimer K.S. Hallewell R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7381-7385Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 7Dhaunsi G.S. Gulati S. Singh A.K. Orak J.K. Asayama K. Singh I. J. Biol.

Biophys. 1994; 315: 331-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Pmp20 (20-kDa peroxisomal membrane protein) was initially identified as a peroxisomal membrane protein of unknown function in the methylotrophic yeast Candida boidinii (10Garrard L.J. Goodman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13929-13937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, Pmp20 family proteins have been suggested to detoxify ROS within human and murine peroxisomes (11Yamashita H. Avraham S. Jiang S. London R. Van Veldhoven P.P. Subramani S. Rogers R.A. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29897-29904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 12Knoops B. Clippe A. Bogard C. Arsalane K. Wattiez R. Hermans C. Duconseille E. Falmagne P. Bernard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30451-30458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Subsequently, putative Pmp20 homologs, having a putative peroxisome targeting signal type 1 (PTS1) at their C terminus, were found to be widely distributed in various eukaryotic cells from yeasts and mammalian cells, e.g. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ScPmp20; also designated as Ahp1p or type II thioredoxin peroxidase (TPX)) (13Lee J.

Lett. 1994; 122: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), human (HsPmp20), and mouse (MmPmp20) (11Yamashita H. Avraham S. Jiang S. London R. Van Veldhoven P.P. Subramani S. Rogers R.A. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29897-29904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Immunocytochemical and biochemical studies have clearly demonstrated that C. boidinii Pmp20 (CbPmp20) is a peroxisomal membrane-associated protein present also in the peroxisome matrix (16Goodman J.M. Trapp S.B. Hwang H. Veenhuis M. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 97: 193-204Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,17Veenhuis M. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 96: 583-590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the physiological significance and function of this and other Pmp20 family proteins seem to be more complex than initially expected. For example, a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-ScPmp20 fusion protein was localized to mitochondria despite the presence of a putative PTS1 sequence (18Farcasanu I.C. Hirata D. Tsuchiya E. Mizuta K. Miyakawa T. Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem. 1999; 63: 1871-1881Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Depletion of Pmp20 in S. cerevisiae did not affect its growth on oleate medium where normal peroxisomal metabolism is necessary for its growth. 2I. C. Farcasanu and T. Miyakawa, personal communication. 2I. C. Farcasanu and T. Miyakawa, personal communication. Although the binding of HsPmp20 to the PTS1 receptor Pex5p was shown, up to 50% of epitope-tagged HsPmp20 was also detected in the cytosolic fraction of HeLa cells (11Yamashita H. Avraham S. Jiang S.

More recently, a long form of HsPmp20, designated as AOEB166, having a mitochondrial sorting signal at its N terminus and peroxisome targeting signal at its C-terminus, showed bimodal distribution of AOEB166 in these organelles (12Knoops B. Clippe A. Bogard C. Arsalane K. Wattiez R. Hermans C. Duconseille E. Falmagne P. Bernard A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30451-30458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Recently, the Pmp20 family proteins were recognized from their primary amino acid sequence to belong to a new antioxidant family, the peroxiredoxins (Prx) (19Schröder E. Ponting C.P. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 2465-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). HsPmp20 and ScPmp20 exhibited antioxidant activity in vitro (11Yamashita H. Avraham S. Jiang S. London R. Van Veldhoven P.P. Subramani S. Rogers R.A. Avraham H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29897-29904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 14Jeong J.S. Kwon S.J. Kang S.W. Rhee S.G. Kim K. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), and both MmPmp20 (20Zhou Y. Kok K.H. Chun A.C.S. Wong C.-M. Wu H.W. Lin M.C.M. Fung P.C.W. Kung H.-F. Jin D.-Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 921-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and ScPmp20 (21Verdoucq L. Vignols F. Jacquot J.-P. Chartier Y. Meyer Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19714-19722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) were reported to have TPX activity. However, the presence of thioredoxin molecule within peroxisomes has not been demonstrated. Furthermore, bimodal localization of Pmp20 proteins in peroxisomes and mitochondria has made it difficult for us to investigate the physiological function of Pmp20 proteins in relation to the ROS protection system within peroxisomes. To answer these questions, we initiated a study of the biochemical and physiological functions of CbPmp20. The rationale for using CbPmp20 in the methylotrophic yeast C. boidinii are as follows: 1) Because CbPmp20 is specifically induced in methanol-containing medium and is exclusively localized within peroxisomes, we can specify the function of CbPmp20 within methanol-induced peroxisomes (17Veenhuis M. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 96: 583-590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Yurimoto H. Komeda T. Lim C.R. Nakagawa T. Kondo K. Kato N. Sakai Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1493: 56-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). 2) The molecular genetics (23Sakai Y. Tani Y. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5988-5993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sakai Y. Kazarimoto T. Tani Y. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7458-7463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and organelle fractionation techniques (25Sakai Y. Saiganji A. Yurimoto H. Takabe K. Saiki H. Kato N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 37-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Nakagawa T. Imanaka T. Morita M. Ishiguro K. Yurimoto H. Yamashita A. Kato N. Sakai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3455-3461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) have been well established with C. boidinii.Through this study we have demonstrated that the Pmp20-antioxidant system indeed functions within peroxisomes as GPX and that the antioxidant function of CbPmp20 is biochemically and physiologically distinct from that of peroxisomal catalase. C. boidiniistrain S2 was the original haploidal strain for construction of the genomic library. C. boidinii strain TK62 (ura3) (24Sakai Y. Kazarimoto T. Tani Y. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7458-7463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as the host for transformation. C. boidiniistrain GC (27Sakai Y. Rogi T. Yonehara T. Kato N. Tani Y. Bio/Technology. 1994; 12: 291-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which was derived from strain TK62 via gene conversion with URA3 fragment (24Sakai Y. Kazarimoto T. Tani Y. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 7458-7463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was routinely used as the control wild type strain. C. boidinii straincta1Δ, which is the disruptant of the peroxisomal catalase-encoding gene (CTA1), will be described elsewhere. 3H. Horiguchi, H. Yurimoto, T.-K. Goh, T. Nakagawa, N. Kato, and Y. Sakai, manuscript in preparation. Synthetic MI medium was used as the basal medium on which C. boidinii was cultivated (26Nakagawa T. Imanaka T. Morita M. Ishiguro K. Yurimoto H. Yamashita A. Kato N. Sakai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3455-3461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). One or more of the following was used as the carbon source in each experiment: 1% (w/v) glucose, 1% (v/v) methanol. The initial pH of the medium was adjusted to 6.0. The complex YP medium containing 2% bactopeptone and 1% yeast extract (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI) was also used as the basal medium in some experiments. YPD contained 2% glucose, and YPMGy contained 0.5% methanol and 0.5% glycerol as the carbon source(s). The C. boidinii strains were incubated aerobically at 28 °C under reciprocal shaking, and the growth of the yeast was followed by measuring the OD610. Escherichia coli DH5α (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) was routinely used for plasmid propagation. LB medium (0.5% yeast extract, 1% bactopeptone, and 1% NaCl) (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) was used for bacterial expression of the recombinant CbPmp20s. Two PCR primers, PMP20N1 and PMP20R1 (TableI), were designed based on the conserved DNA sequences between CbPmp20A and CbPmp20B (10Garrard L.J. Goodman J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13929-13937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and synthesized. These primers were used to amplify an approximately 500-base pair fragment that encoded a partial Pmp20 sequence from C. boidinii strain S2. This PCR-amplified fragment was gel purified,32P-labeled according to the method of Feinberg and Vogelstein (29Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16562) Google Scholar), and used for further cloning experiments. A pool ofBamHI-digested genomic DNA of ∼3.8 kb was gel purified and ligated into the BamHI site of pBluescript II KS+ (Strategene, San Diego, CA). E. coli transformants were transferred onto a Biodyne nylon membrane (Pall Bio Support, New York, NY). After lysis of the bacteria, the liberated DNA was bound to the nylon membrane, and these blots were then used for colony hybridization under high stringency hybridization conditions using Church-Gilbert buffer (1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25m NaCl, 0.25 m Na3PO4, pH 7.2, 7% SDS) (30Church G.M. Gilbert W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 1991-1995Crossref PubMed Scopus (7251) Google Scholar). Hybridization was performed at 65 °C overnight, and then the membranes were washed six times in 0.2× SSC (1× SSC is 0.15 m NaCl plus 0.015 m sodium citrate) at the same temperature. Five clones that showed strong positive signals were found to harbor a reactive 3.8-kbBamHI fragment. The nested deletion mutants were derived as previously described (31Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene ( Amst. ). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11410) Google Scholar), and the entire PMP20 gene was sequenced in both directions using a 7-deaza sequencing kit (Thermo Sequence fluorescent labeled primer cycle sequencing kit) from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and DNA sequencer model DSQ-2000L from SHIMADZU Co. Ltd. (Kyoto, Japan).Table IOligonucleotide primers used in this studyPrimerSequence (5′–3′)PMP20N1TTGGATCC(AT)GA(AG)GG(AT)GGAGA(AT)CC(AT)GGPMP20R1AAGATATC(AG)ACTTC(AT)CC(AT)CC(AG)TT(TC)TCNOT20NATAAGAATGCGGCCGCAAAATGGCGCCAATTAAAAGG20CNOTATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCCTATAATTTAGCAATAATCTTTTG20dAKL-CATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCCTAAATAATCTTTTGAGCAGTAGAAAC53S-FTTACACCACCATCTACTGAACAACATTTC53S-RAAATGTTGTTCAGTAGATGGTGGTGTAABases in the parentheses represent mixed bases.

The remaining fragment was gel purified, blunted with T4 DNA polymerase, and ligated to theSacI-XhoI fragment of pSPR (C. boidinii URA3 gene having repeated sequence at the 5′- and 3′-franking regions) (23Sakai Y. Tani Y. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5988-5993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ligation reaction generated the C. boidinii PMP20 disruption vector pD20SPR. After propagation of pD20SPR inE. coli, the insert DNA fragment was liberated followingHindIII digestion and was used to transform C. boidinii TK62 (ura3) to uracil prototrophy. The disruption of PMP20 was confirmed by genomic Southern analysis with HindIII-digested DNA from a Ura+transformant, using the 1.0-kb StyI-HindIII fragment from pMP200 as the probe. The PMP20 disruptant strain pmp20Δ, obtained with pD20SPR, was reverted to uracil auxotrophy, yielding strain pmp20Δ ura3, using our previously described procedure (23Sakai Y. Tani Y. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 5988-5993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NotI sites were added to both ends of thePMP20 coding sequence by PCR using two primers NOT20N and 20CNOT (Table I) and PMP20 DNA as the template. To replace the conserved Cys53 residue of CbPmp20 with serine, at first, two fragments were PCR-amplified using either set of primers, primers NOT20N and C53S-R, or, primers C53S-F and C53S-R (Table I). Each fragment was purified and used as the templates of the second PCR, where primers NOT20N and 20CNOT were used. Each of the wild type or C53S-mutagenized PMP20-fragments amplified was introduced into the C. boidinii expression vector pNoteI (32Sakai Y. Akiyama M. Kondoh H. Shibano Y. Kato N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1308: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and the constructed plasmids were named pNot20 and pNot20C53S, respectively. pNoteI harbored the C. boidinii AOD1 promoter and terminator sequences with a unique NotI site to insert coding sequences for expression (32Sakai Y. Akiyama M. Kondoh H. Shibano Y. Kato N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1308: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). pNot20-ΔAKL, in which the C-terminal 3 amino acids of CbPmp20 were deleted, was constructed in the same way with the use of primers NOT-20-N and 20dAKL-C (Table I). These constructed plasmids were linearized by BamHI and introduced intoC. boidinii strain pmp20Δ ura3 by the modified lithium acetate method (33Sakai Y. Goh T.K. Tani Y. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 3556-3562Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression plasmid, pGFP-AKL containing GFP tagged with the Pmp20 C-terminal -AKL sequence (34Sakai Y. Yurimoto H. Matsuo H. Kato N. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1175-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), was also introduced into strain pmp20Δ ura3, yielding strain GFP-AKL/pmp20Δ. Strain GFP-AKL/wt (34Sakai Y. Yurimoto H. Matsuo H. Kato N. Yeast. 1998; 14: 1175-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was used as the control wild type strain. CbPmp20 or CbPmp20 C53S-coding protein was expressed inE. coli BL21(DE3) (Novagen, Madison, WI) as a His6 fusion protein in pRSET A (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) containing six histidine residues at their N terminus. pNot20 and pNot20C53S was each digested with NotI, and the insert DNAs was blunt-ended and ligated to the blunt-ended BamHI site of pRSET A, yielding pRSET20 and pRSET20C53S, respectively. The proper in-frame integration was confirmed by DNA sequencing. A single colony was inoculated in 100 ml of LB medium containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and incubated at 28 °C with reciprocal shaking until the OD610 reached ∼0.6. The recombinant protein production was induced by adding isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a 1 mm final concentration and cultured further for 5 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, resuspended in 25 ml of cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and recentrifuged. The cell pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of the same buffer, frozen and thawed six times, and sonicated for 30 s three times. Solubilized proteins were recovered by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min. The obtained protein-containing supernatant was applied on the nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA), and proteins were purified through a protein nondenaturation procedure as recommended by the manufacturer. Purified proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and subjected to the biochemical analyses. GPX activity was determined by measuring consumption of NADPH in the presence of GSH (Wako, Osaka, Japan) and GSH reductase (Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan) using cumene hydroperoxide, tert-butyl hydroperoxide, and hydrogen peroxide as substrates. The standard reaction mixture (1 ml) was 20 μg of purified His6-tagged CbPmp20, 70 μmNADPH, 0.1 mm GSH, and 0.4 units/ml GSH reductase in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The reaction was carried out at 30 °C and was started by adding peroxide on a double beam spectrophotometer UV 2200-A (Shimadzu Co. Ltd., Kyoto, Japan). In the thioredoxin system, 4 μm thioredoxin (Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan) and 0.4 units/ml thioredoxin reductase (Oriental Yeast, Tokyo, Japan) were substituted for GSH and GSH reductase. Enzyme activity was expressed as μmol of NADPH oxidized/min/mg protein. The amount of GSH and GS-SG was determined according to Tietze (35Tietze F. Anal. Biochem. 1969; 27: 502-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (5488) Google Scholar). GSH reductase (GR) activity was determined by the method of Casaloneet al. (36Casalone E. Dillio C. Federici G. Polsinelli M. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek. 1988; 54: 367-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Catalase and cytochrome c oxidase activities were determined as described previously (37Bergmeyer H.U. Biochem. Z. 1955; 327: 255-258PubMed Google Scholar, 38Tolbert N.E. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 734-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Protein quantitation was performed using the method of Bradford (39Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) with a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Standard 9% Laemmli gels (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) with a separating gel of pH 9.2 were used. Immunoblotting was performed by the method of Towbin et al. (41Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 77: 5201-5205Google Scholar) using the ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The VA9 monoclonal anti-Pmp20 antibody and anti-alcohol oxidase were kindly provided by Dr. J. M. Goodman (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). O2 dissolved in aqueous solution was measured polarographically at 37 °C in 50 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.4, using a Clark electrode placed in a water-jacketed cell assembly from Rank Brothers Ltd. (model 0646). The calibration of the O2 monitor was performed as described before (42Robinson J. Cooper J.M. Anal. Biochem. 1970; 20: 525-532Google Scholar). O2 uptake was initiated by the addition of the reducing agent (ascorbate or DTT), unless specifically noted. The profile of DTT oxidation is comprised of a lag phase of several minutes, followed by a rapid O2 uptake step when the maximal rate is reached. The maximum rate was determined from the slope of the steepest, nearly linear segment of the O2 uptake curve. Fluorescent measurement was employed in the horseradish peroxidase-catalyzed oxidation of homocanillic acid by H2O2 (43Yim M.B. Chae H.Z. Rhee S.G. Chock P.B. Stadtman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1621-1626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,44Guibault G.G. Brignac Jr., P.J. Juneau M. Anal. Chem. 1968; 40: 1256-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Because thiols are substrates for horseradish peroxidase (45Harman L.R. Carver D.K. Schreiber J. Manson R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1642-1648Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), sulfhydryl groups were alkylated with N-ethylmaleimide, prior to the determination of H2O2concentration. Calibration curves were generated with known amounts of H2O2. Wild type C. boidiniicells were grown on YPMGy medium overnight, spheroplasted with Zymolyase 100T (Seikagaku Co., Tokyo Japan), and osmotically lysed according to the method of Goodman et al. (46Goodman J.M. Scott C.W. Donahue P.N. Atherton J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 8485-8493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as described previously (26Nakagawa T. Imanaka T. Morita M.

Unlysed cells, nuclei, and other cell debris were removed carefully from the lysate by centrifugation at 1,000 ×g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant was subjected to centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 20 min to obtain a crude pellet containing mainly peroxisomes and mitochondria. To prepare a continuous Nycodenz (Sigma) gradient solution, a step gradient of 10.6 ml (1.3 ml of 60% Nycodenz, 2 ml of 50% Nycodenz, 4 ml of 35% Nycodenz, and 3.3 ml of 28% Nycodenz (w/v)), was frozen once in liquid nitrogen, and then thawed. Then, the organellar suspension was layered on top of the 10.6-ml gradient, and the samples were spun at 100,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C in a VTi 65.1 vertical rotor (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). The gradients were fractionated from the bottom. Cells representing GFP fluorescence were placed on a microscope slide and examined under a Carl Zeiss Axioplan 2 Fluorescence Microscope (Oberkochen, Germany), and set at the fluorescein isothiocyanate channel. Images were acquired using a CCD camera (Carl Zeiss ZVS-47DE) and a CG7 Frame Grabber (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD). C. boidinii strainpmp20Δ cells were incubated in MI medium containing 0.5% yeast extract for 10 h. Cells were fixed with 2% glutaraldehyde and postfixed sequentially with 1.5% KMnO4 and 1.5% uranyl acetate as described previously (47Sakai Y. Marshall P.A. Saiganji A. Takabe K. Saiki H. Kato N. Goodman J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6773-6781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The material was dehydrated in a graded acetone series and then embedded in Spurr resin (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA). Ultrathin sections were prepared by using a diamond knife for cutting and observed under an electron microscope (JEOL model C100). The nucleotide sequence ofPMP20 gene published here has been submitted to GenBank and is available under accession number AB055180. From the deduced encoded amino acid sequence of the gene cloned from strain S2 of C. boidinii, CbPmp20 is a protein of 167 amino acids with a molecular mass of 18,083 Da. Fig. 1shows a multiple alignment of several Pmp20 family proteins. All family members contain a putative PTS1 sequence at their C- terminus. The amino acid identity of CbPmp20 based on deduced amino acid sequences with CbPmp20B, CbPmp20A, HsPmp20, MmPmp20, and ScPmp20 was 99.4% (C. boidinii ATCC32195), 96.4% (C. boidiniiATCC32195), 25.7% (human), 23.4% (mouse), and 18.6% (S. cerevisiae), respectively. BLAST analysis revealed that these Pmp20 family proteins exhibited significant sequence similarities with other Prx family proteins, especially in the region around Cys53 of CbPmp20. The most unique feature of the C. boidinii Pmp20 proteins is that CbPmp20 has only one cysteine residue, whereas mammalian and S. cerevisiae Pmp20s have more than two cysteine residues. Therefore, CbPmp20 was classified as 1-Cys Prx, whereas other Pmp20 proteins belonged to 2-Cys Prx (48Munz B. Frank S. Hübner G. Olsen E. Werner S. Biochem.

Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 158: 141-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Both apyrases and ATPases can use ATP as substrates; however, there are substantial differences (1Plesner L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 158: 141-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 2Komoszynski M. Wojtczak A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1310: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). For instance, the ATPases are highly selective toward their substrate ATP with ADP and phosphate as reaction products. On the contrary, apyrases can use different nucleoside tri- and diphosphates as their substrates, with phosphates and nucleoside monophosphates as the main reaction products. Additionally, sequence comparison among various apyrases revealed the presence of apyrase conserved regions, which are highly conserved among all apyrases from various organisms such as plants, parasites, and mammals. Thus far, two types of apyrases, ecto-apyrases and endo-apyrases, have been described (2Komoszynski M. Wojtczak A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1310: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Ecto-apyrases such as CD39 are apyrase enzymes with their catalytic domain exposed on the cell surface (1Plesner L. Int. Rev.

Broekman M.J. Drosopoulos J.H.G. Islam N. Alyonycheva T.N. Safier L.B. Hajiar K.A. Posnett D.N. Schoenborn M.A. Schooley R.B. Gayle R.B. Maliszewski C.R. J. Clin.

J. 1996; 285: 345-365Crossref Scopus (753) Google Scholar). On the other hand, endo-apyrases such as uridine diphosphatase and the 700-kDa lysosomal apyrase-like protein (LALP70) are apyrase enzymes with their catalytic domain localized intracellularly (6Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 7Biederbick A. Kosan C. Kunz J. Elsasser H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19018-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The biological functions of the endo-apyrases are unknown, although it was suggested that they are important for regulating the level of activated sugar during protein glycosylation. Recently, Wang and Guidotti (6Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) identified the first mammalian endo-apyrase, human uridine diphosphatase. This enzyme is predicted to be a 610-amino acid protein with two putative transmembrane domains. Using a myc-tagged version of this protein, this enzyme was found to be in the luminal side of the Golgi apparatus and had the highest catalytic activity using UDP as its substrate and had lower activities using GDP, CDP, UTP, GTP, CTP, and TTP. Interestingly, Biederbick et al. (7Biederbick A. Kosan C. Kunz J. Elsasser H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19018-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) reported altered substrate preferences of LALP70, which is a splicing variant of uridine diphosphatase and has an additional 8 amino acids (VSFASSQQ) resulting from the inclusion of an alternate exon. The enzymatic properties of this splice variant revealed a broad substrate specificity, with CTP, UDP, CDP, GTP, and GDP as preferred substrates. Using antibodies and a green fluorescent protein-tagged version of this splicing variant, LALP70 was co-localized with the autophagic marker monodansylcadaverine and the lysosomal protein lamp1, suggesting a lysosomal/autophagic vacuole subcellular location (8Biederbick A. Rose S. Elsasser H.P. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2473-2484Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although most of the transiently expressed LALP70/GFP1 fusion protein was co-localized with lamp1-positive vacuoles, an association with the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum could not be ruled out. These studies clearly demonstrated that LALP70/uridine diphosphatase is the first mammalian member of the endo-apyrase gene family. Here we report the molecular cloning and characterization of the LALP1 gene, which closely resembles LALP70 in both structure and enzymatic property. Hence, we propose thatLALP1 is a second member of the endo-apyrase gene family. 5′- and 3′-RACE reactions were conducted with the SMART RACE kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions, with a slight modification as described previously (11Li, Q. Z., Wang, C. Y., Shi, J. D., Ruan, Q. G., Cruz, P. E., Eckenrode, S., Semiromi, A. D., and She, J. X. (2001) Genomics, inGoogle Scholar, 12Wang C.Y. Semiromi A.D. Huang W. Connor E. Shi J.D. She J.X. Hum. Genet. 1998; 103: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Briefly, for 5′-RACE, the first-strain cDNA synthesis is primed using a gene-specific primer and a SMART oligonucleotide with human brain total RNA. After reverse transcription reaches the end of the mRNA template, several dC residues are added to the end of the cDNA. The SMART oligonucleotide, which contains several 3-dG at its 3′ end, anneals to the tail of the newly synthesized cDNA and then serves as a template for further extension of the cDNA by RT. After the RT reaction, an internal gene-specific reverse primer and a UP primer, which is complementary to SMART oligonucleotide, were used to perform PCR using the RT products as templates. To increase the specificity and product yield of 5′-RACE, nested PCR was then performed using another internal gene-specific primer and NUP primer (internal primer of UP primer). For 3′-RACE, the first-strand cDNA was synthesized using a modified oligo(dT) with a UP oligonucleotide tail. The UP primer and a gene-specific forward primer were used for first-round PCR. Nested PCR was performed using NUP and an internal gene-specific forward primer. PCRs were carried out in a final volume of 20 μl. After the RT-PCR, the samples were denatured at 94 °C for 5 min; amplifications were carried out with 5 cycles of 30-s denaturing at 94 °C, 30-s annealing at 68 °C, and a 4-min extension at 72 °C followed by 30 cycles of 30-s denaturing at 94 °C, 30-s annealing at 62 °C, and a 4-min extension at 72 °C. PCR products obtained from nested PCR were loaded onto a 2% agarose gel, and individual bands were excised from the gel for direct sequencing. The PCR product was subcloned into TA vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA), and the sequence was determined with ABI 310 DNA sequencer as described previously (12Wang C.Y. Semiromi A.D. Huang W. Connor E. Shi J.D. She J.X. Hum. Genet. 1998; 103: 681-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 13Wang C.Y. Shi J.D. Semiromi A.D. She J.X.

Total RNA was isolated from various mouse tissues using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA (5 μg) was used for RT reactions in a total volume of 20 μl using a poly(T)-plus primer as described previously (13Wang C.Y. Shi J.D. Semiromi A.D. She J.X. Genomics. 1999; 55: 322-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 14Ruan Q.G. Wang C.Y. Shi J.D. She J.X. Autoimmunity. 1999; 13: 307-313Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Denatured RNA samples and the primer were incubated with reverse transcriptase at 42 °C for 1 h. The RT reaction was then stopped by heating the samples at 95 °C for 10 min. 2 μl of the cDNA was used as template for a subsequent PCR in a total volume of 20 μl. To assess the relative expression level of the mouse Lalp1 gene, competitive RT-PCR was performed. Briefly, a 750-bp Lalp1fragment (mExon8F and 5′UTR-R primers) was co-amplified with a 450-bp β-actin fragment (Table I) in the same PCR. The annealing temperature was set to 58 °C, and the PCR was run for 30 cycles. The PCR products were analyzed on a 2% agarose gel in Tris-borate EDTA buffer.Table IPrimers used in this studyPrimer name5′–3′ SequenceHumanhLALP1-RTATACAAAGGAGAGACGGAAChLALP1-R1GCTCGTGTTTGTCGGTGGTGhLALP1-R2CCTGAGTGGTAAGAATCGTGhLALP1-F1ACTTTCTACCGTAATTCCTTCThLALP1-F2CAGCCCCTTCTTTCTChExon4-FCAGCAGGCATGAGGCTTCThExon8-RAGCGCTGCCGGGCAAAGTTGhExon1-FATGGAGATGCCTGGGACAAGMousemExon8FCCAATCGACTTCAACAACAG5′UTR-RGGGCACCAAAAAGAAATCAAAGmLALP-R1CTGTTTCCCAGAGATCACTTCmLALP1-RTTCGGAGGCTGAGGTAGGAAmLALP1-R2GGCACAGTGAAGTACCAGGAGmLALP1-F1AAAACACGATTCTTACCACTCAGmLALP1-F2CTCCGCCTTTCCTTTGTCTACβ-actin-FGAAAAGATGACCCAGATCATGβ-actin-RCCACAGGATTCCATACCCAACPrimers for RACESmart oligonucleotideAAGCAGTGGTAACAACGCAGAGTACGCGGGUPCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCAAGCAGTGGTAACAACGCAGAGTNUPAAGCAGTGGTAACAACGCAGAGT Open table in a new tab Two expression constructs were made to study the enzymatic activity and cellular localization of the human LALP1 protein. First, full-length LALP1 cDNA was subcloned into mammalian expression vector pEGFP N1 (CLONTECH) using engineered HindIII restriction endonuclease sites via PCR. This construct is designated pEGFP/LALP1. In the second construct (pEGFP/LALP1-GFP), LALP1 cDNA is fused with a C-terminal GFP to produce LALP1-GFP fusion protein. HEK297 cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml gentamycin and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified chamber equilibrated with 5% CO2. Cells were transfected with mammalian pEGFP expression constructs using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as transfection reagent following the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were harvested for the apyrase assay 24 h after transfection. The cellular localization of LALP1 was determined by transfection experiments with the LALP1-GFP plasmid. After transfection, cells were cultured in chamber slides (LAB-TEK) for 12–18 h. Transfected cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and mounted with coverslips. The fluorescent images were obtained using a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad) equipped with an argon laser with excitation at 488 nm and detection at 510–530 nm bandpass for GFP. Nucleotide phosphatase activity was measured in crude membranes from HEK293 cells transfected with pEGFP vector or pEGFP/LALP1 construct. Ten flasks (T75) of transfected HEK293 cells were homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer, and nuclei were separated according to the method of Wang and Guidotti (6Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To separate the crude membrane fraction from the cytosol, the postnuclear supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 ×g. The pellets were resuspended in 500 μl of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, and 0.2 mm EDTA containing 0.1% Triton X-100. The protein concentration in each sample was determined with bicinchoninic acid (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To measure apyrase activity, HEK297 membrane suspension containing 10 μg of total protein was adjusted to 45 μl with reaction buffer containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 120 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, 1 mmNaN3, and 0.5 mmNa3VO4, with or without 5 mmCaCl2. After preincubation for 5 min at 37 °C nucleotide phosphatase reactions were initiated by the addition of 5 μl of the same buffer containing 10 mm nucleotide phosphate substrates to give a final concentration of 1 mm. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. NTP/NDP hydrolysis under these conditions was linear up to 30 min. Apyrase activity was determined by measuring the inorganic phosphate released as described previously (6Wang T.F. Guidotti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11392-11399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 7Biederbick A. Kosan C. Kunz J. Elsasser H.P. J. Biol.

Values obtained from samples without CaCl2 or MgCl2 were subtracted from those obtained with CaCl2 or MgCl2. All measurements were done in triplicate. Student's t test was performed to assess statistical significance. The humanLALP1 gene was cloned using SMART RACE technology. Based on the sequence of expressed sequence tag N35618 in the human chromosomal region 10q23–q24 (9Wang C.Y. Shi J.D. Huang Y.Q. Cruz P.E. Ochoa B. Bobbilynn H.-L. Semiromi A.D. She J.X.

The resulting full-length sequence (Fig.1) was 2962 bp (GenBankTMaccession number AF269255). A GenBankTM search indicated that the human LALP1 gene is contained in clone RP11-483F11 (GenBankTM accession number AL133353). Comparison of cDNA and genomic sequences suggested that LALP1 has 12 exons that expand about 46 kilobase pairs of genomic sequence (Fig. 2). The cloned cDNA coincides almost exactly with the computer-predicted structure. The translation initiation codon ATG is located near the end of exon 1, which contains only eight coding nucleotides. Multiple in-frame stop codons are present upstream of the putative first ATG. A CpG island was identified at −124 bp upstream of the putative first ATG. A putative polyadenylation signal sequence (AATAAA) is found at 28 bp upstream of the poly(A) tail. The LALP1 gene contains 1,812 nucleotides of coding sequence and encodes a protein of 604 amino acids with a molecular mass of 69.88 kDa. Interestingly, the exon/intron structure of LALP1 is almost identical to that of theLALP70 gene (7Biederbick A. Kosan C. Kunz J. Elsasser H.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19018-19024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).Figure 2Genomic strucuture of the humanLALP1 gene. Black boxes represent exons, whereas the lines represent introns.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The mouseLalp1 gene was cloned based on homology with its human homologue. Briefly, two human LALP1 primers (hExon4-F and hExon8-R) were used to amplify the mouse gene from mouse brain cDNA. A fragment of 450 bp encompassing the region from exon 4 to exon 8 was obtained and directly sequenced. This mouse fragment shares 86.8% homology with the human LALP1 homologous region, confirming that the fragment is indeed derived from the mouseLalp1 gene. A mouse reverse primer (mLALP-R1) was designed based on the partial mouse Lalp1 sequence and used together with a human forward primer (hExon1-F) in RT-PCR. This RT-PCR generated a fragment of 730 bp, which shares 89.5% homology with the humanLALP1 sequence. To obtain the complete sequences at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the gene, 5′- and 3′-RACE were performed using several reverse and forward primers (mLALP1-RT, mLALP1-R2, mLALP1-F1, and mLALP1-F2). Mouse Lalp1 cDNA contains 3268 bp (GenBankTMaccession number AF288221) with an open reading frame of 1818 bp and encodes a protein of 606 amino acids (with a molecular mass of 69.99 kDa). The mouse and human cDNA sequences share 87% nucleotide sequence similarity in the entire coding region, whereas the sequence homology in 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR is poor, further supporting the open reading frame assignment. The deduced protein sequences are also highly conserved between human and mouse (88% identity). To compare the relative expression levels in different tissues, competitive RT-PCR was performed with RNA from different mouse tissues. As shown in Fig. 3,Lalp1 is highly expressed in most tissues including the brain, kidney, liver, and testis. The expression is relatively lower in the lung, thymus, and heart. Among all tissues analyzed, the expression is lowest in the spleen. These results suggest that the LALP1 protein must play critical roles in the cellular functions of many different tissues. A BLAST search revealed that the LALP1 and Lalp1 proteins have significant sequence homologies with human LALP70 and guanosine diphosphatase protein family members (Fig. 4). The human LALP1 shares 59% identity and 71% similarity to LALP70, 58% identity and 70% similarity to guanosine diphosphatase, and 25% identity and 42% similarity to CD39. These results suggest that LALP1 may be an apyrase. To determine whether LALP1 is indeed an apyrase, nucleotide phosphotase activity was measured in HEK293 cells transfected with the pEGFP vector or the full-length LALP1 cDNA constructs (pEGFP/LALP1). The experiments were done in the presence of 1 mm azide (inhibitor of F-type ATPase) and 0.5 mm vanadate (inhibitor of P-type ATPase), which do not inhibit the activities of E-ATPases (1Plesner L. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1995; 158: 141-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 2Komoszynski M. Wojtczak A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1310: 233-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5, the mean activities were higher for cells containing LALP1 expression vector than in cells containing control vector. For example, the CTPase activity (24.9 ± 1.46 nmol Pi/min/mg) with the LALP1 construct is 5-fold higher than the CTPase activity (4.34 ± 2.02 nmol Pi/min/mg) for cells transfected with control vector. Student's t test suggested that the mean activities were significantly different between LALP1 and control vector with UTP (p < 0.02), GTP (p < 0.002), and CTP (p < 0.0001) as the substrates (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the nucleotide phosphatase activities are absolutely dependent on the presence of Ca2+ions (data not shown). Therefore, our data indicate that human LALP1 is truly an apyrase with a substrate preference for UTP, GTP, and CTP. It is interesting to note that the HEK293 cells have very high enzymatic activities for the GDP and UDP nucleotide substrates (controls in Fig.5) due to endogenous apyrases. However, GDP and UDP do not seem to be preferred substrates for the LALP1 protein because LALP1-overexpressing cells do not have significantly higher enzymatic activities compared with control cells. We then determined whether LALP1 is an ecto-apyrase or an endo-apyrase. Two sets of experiments were performed. First, the enzymatic activity of intact and disrupted cells was compared to determine whether it is located intracellularly or extracellularly. The CTPase activity of LALP1 cDNA-transfected HEK293 cells increased significantly after the cells were treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 or disrupted by mechanical forces (data not shown). These results suggest that human LALP1 is located inside the cell. Second, we determined the cellular localization of LALP1 using a LALP1-GFP fusion construct. The expression of LALP1-GFP fusion protein could be clearly observed as a punctuate distribution pattern under a confocal fluorescence microscope (Fig.6 A), indicating an intracellular vesicular compartmentalization as compared with a typical soluble GFP intracellular distribution (Fig. 6 B). However, we did not observe any significant plasma membrane fluorescence, even under prolonged transfection conditions. Therefore, the LALP1-GFP fusion protein was associated with intracellular membrane compartments instead of the plasma membrane. This result further supports the notion that LALP1 is an endo-apyrase. In conclusion, we have cloned the human LALP1 and mouseLalp1 genes that share a high degree of sequence homology with mammalian endo-apyrases. Studies of the enzymatic activities and intracellular localization strongly suggest that these genes encode a novel member of the mammalian endo-apyrase gene family.

https://openalex.org/W2039504258,"The control of DNA binding by eukaryotic transcription factors represents an important regulatory mechanism. Many transcription factors are controlled by cis-acting autoinhibitory modules that are thought to act by blocking promiscuous DNA binding in the absence of appropriate regulatory cues. Here, we have investigated the determinants and regulation of the autoinhibitory mechanism employed by the ETS-domain transcription factor, PEA3. DNA binding is inhibited by a module composed of a combination of two short motifs located on either side of the ETS DNA-binding domain. A second type of protein, Ids, can act in trans to mimic the effect of these cis-acting inhibitory motifs and reduce DNA binding by PEA3. By using a one-hybrid screen, we identified the basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper transcription factor USF-1 as an interaction partner for PEA3. PEA3 and USF-1 form DNA complexes in a cooperative manner. Moreover, the formation of ternary PEA3·USF-1·DNA complexes requires parts of the same motifs in PEA3 that form the autoinhibitory module. Thus the binding of USF-1 to PEA3 acts as a switch that modifies the autoinhibitory motifs in PEA3 to first relieve their inhibitory action, and second, promote ternary nucleoprotein complex assembly.

PEA3 and USF-1 form DNA complexes in a cooperative manner. Moreover, the formation of ternary PEA3·USF-1·DNA complexes requires parts of the same motifs in PEA3 that form the autoinhibitory module. Thus the binding of USF-1 to PEA3 acts as a switch that modifies the autoinhibitory motifs in PEA3 to first relieve their inhibitory action, and second, promote ternary nucleoprotein complex assembly. helix-loop helix basic helix-loop-helix-leucine zipper polymerase chain reaction glutathione S-transferase human immunodeficiency virus type 1 USF-specific region Eukaryotic transcription factors are grouped into families based on the type of DNA-binding domains that they possess. Due to high sequence conservation within these DNA-binding domains, members of particular families bind to similar DNA sequences. Thus, mechanisms must be in place to prevent promiscuous binding to inappropriate sites and provide specificity to ensure binding to the correct sites. One such mechanism is autoinhibition, whereby proteins block their own DNA binding by employing cis-acting inhibitory modules (reviewed in Ref.1Graves B.J. Cowley D.O. Goetz T.L. Petersen J.M. Jonsen M.D. Gillespie M.E. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These modules also often act to block other activities of transcription factors such as transcriptional activation or nuclear localization. Conversely, mechanisms exist to reverse these inhibitory interactions and allow recruitment of proteins to the correct promoter/enhancer sites at appropriate times. Activating triggers can include post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation or the binding to other coregulatory proteins or transcription factors. The transcription factor Ets-1 represents a paradigm for this type of regulatory mechanism. Ets-1 is part of the larger ETS-domain family of proteins that bind to sequences containing the central core trinucleotide GGA (2Graves B.J. Petersen J.M. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 75: 1-55Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Sharrocks A.D. Brown A.L. Ling Y. Yates P.R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1371-1387Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Sequences flanking this motif permit subtle variations in binding specificities for individual family members. Due to this relatively low stringency of binding, many ETS-domain transcription factors possess autoinhibitory domains, including Elk-1 (4Janknecht R. Zinck R. Ernst W.H. Nordheim A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1273-1278PubMed Google Scholar), PU.1 (5Brass A.L. Kehrli E. Eisenbeis C.F. Storb U. Singh H. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2335-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), and members of the PEA3 subfamily (6Brown L.A. Amores A. Schilling T.F. Jowett T. Baert J.L. de Launoit Y. Sharrocks A.D. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Laget M.P. Defossez P.A. Albagli O. Baert J.L. Dewitte F. Stehelin D. de Launoit Y.

DNA binding by Ets-1 is tightly controlled by an inhibitory module composed of α-helices lying N- and C-terminal to the ETS-domain (9Donaldson L.W. Petersen J.M. Graves B.J. McIntosh L.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 10Skalicky J.J. Donaldson L.W. Petersen J.M. Graves B.J. McIntosh L.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 296-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Disruption of one of the N-terminal α-helices results in relief of autoinhibition and permits high affinity DNA binding (11Jonsen M.D. Petersen J.M. Xu Q.-P. Graves B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2065-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 12Petersen J.M. Skalicky J.J. Donaldson L.W. McIntosh L.P. Alber T. Graves B.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1866-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Ets-1 has been shown to bind to DNA cooperatively with several transcription factors including USF-1 (13Sieweke M.H. Tekotte H. Jarosch U. Graf T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1728-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and AML-1/CBFα2 (14Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M.H. Shaw P.E.

Biol. 1994; 14: 840-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In the case of the Ets-1·AML-1 complex, this cooperativity appears to result from interaction of the two proteins and subsequent mutual disruption of inhibitory modules in each protein, thereby leading to a loss of autoinhibition (13Sieweke M.H. Tekotte H. Jarosch U. Graf T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1728-1739Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 17Goetz T.L. Gu T.L. Speck N.A. Graves B.J. Mol. Cell.

Alternative routes for relief of autoinhibition have not yet been demonstrated in Ets-1, but in a different ETS-domain transcription factor Elk-1, phosphorylation has been shown to act as a trigger to relieve autoinhibition and thereby stimulate DNA binding (14Gille H. Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Moomaw C. Slaughter C. Cobb M.H. Shaw P.E. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 951-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar, 19Yang S.-H. Shore P. Willingham N. Lakey J.H. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5666-5674Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the case of Elk-1, DNA binding is also subject to further control and is negatively regulated in trans, by members of the Id subfamily of helix-loop-helix (HLH)1 proteins (20Yates P.R. Atherton G. Deed R.W. Norton J.D. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 968-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In this study we have investigated how DNA binding is regulated in a member of a different subfamily of ETS-domain transcription factors, PEA3. The PEA3 group of ETS-domain transcription factors contains three different proteins, PEA3/E1AF, ERM, and ER81 (reviewed in Ref. 21de Launoit Y. Baert J.L. Chotteau A. Monte D. Defossez P.A. Coutte L. Pelczar H. Leenders F. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1997; 61: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Members of this group of proteins are conserved at both the sequence and functional levels in vertebrates as diverse as humans and zebrafish (6Brown L.A. Amores A. Schilling T.F. Jowett T. Baert J.L. de Launoit Y. Sharrocks A.D. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22Munchberg S.R. Ober E.A. Steinbeisser H. Mech. Dev. 1999; 88: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Biological roles for PEA3 family members include promoting muscle cell differentiation (23Taylor J.M. Dupont-Versteegden E.E. Davies J.D. Hassell J.A. Houle J.D. Gurley C.M. Peterson C.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5550-5558Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and the definition of connecting muscle motor and sensory neurones (24Lin J.H. Saito T. Anderson D.J. Lance-Jones C. Jessell T.M. Arber S. Cell. 1998; 95: 393-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Embryonic expression patterns and aberrant expression in metastatic tumors, suggest a role for PEA3 proteins in regulating cell motility during organogenesis/development and during tumor progression (reviewed in Ref. 21de Launoit Y. Baert J.L. Chotteau A. Monte D. Defossez P.A. Coutte L. Pelczar H. Leenders F. Biochem. Mol. Med. 1997; 61: 127-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that in common with the other ETS-domain transcription factors, murine PEA3 and human ERM (7Laget M.P. Defossez P.A. Albagli O. Baert J.L. Dewitte F. Stehelin D. de Launoit Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1325-1336PubMed Google Scholar, 8Xin J.H. Cowie A. Lachance P. Hassell J.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 481-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), DNA binding by zebrafish PEA3 is subject to stringent regulation by autoinhibitory mechanisms (6Brown L.A. Amores A. Schilling T.F. Jowett T. Baert J.L. de Launoit Y. Sharrocks A.D. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Here we investigate the molecular basis for this inhibitory process in zebrafish PEA3 and demonstrate one route by which this autoinhibition can be relieved. Our results point to an intriguing model in which the regions that autoregulate DNA binding by PEA3 also participate in cooperative DNA binding with the partner protein USF-1, thereby coordinately regulating the loss of autoinhibition, with the stimulation of nucleoprotein complex formation. The following plasmids were used for making proteins by in vitro transcription/translation. pcDNA3Id3 (encoding full-length Id3) (25Norton J.D. Atherton G.T. Mol. Cell.

The following plasmids encode the indicated mutant derivatives of PEA3. pAS619 (PEA3-(258–452)-R339P) and pAS1165 (PEA3-(258–452)-V330P) were constructed from the template pAS533. pAS1155 (PEA3-(321–474)-E460P), pAS1156 (PEA3-(321–474)-L468P), pAS1163 (PEA3-(321–474)-K450P), pAS1164 (PEA3-(321–474)-F453P), and pAS1166 (PEA3-(321–474)-I437P) were constructed from the template pAS774. Site-directed mutations were introduced by a two-step PCR protocol using a mutagenic primer and two flanking primers as described previously (27Shore P. Whitmarsh A.J. Bhaskaran R. Davis R.J.

The following plasmids were used for expressing PEA3 derivatives as C-terminal hexahistidine/FLAG-tagged proteins inEscherichia coli. pAS609, pAS610, pAS1161, and pAS1162 (encoding PEA3 derivatives; PEA3-(321–452), PEA3-(341–432), PEA3-(341–452), and PEA3-(321–432)) were constructed by inserting theNcoI-XhoI-digested PCR-derived fragments into the same sites in pET-Hnef-PFH (28Zhao L.-J. Narayan O. Gene. 1993; 137: 345-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). C-terminal hexahistidine-tagged USF-1 derivatives were expressed in E. coli from the plasmids pET3his-USFII (encoding full-length USF-1), pEC12 (encoding USF-1-(144–310)) and pEC14 (encoding USF-1-(197–310)) (29Cheung E.

The following plasmids were constructed for use in yeast one-hybrid assays. pAS468 encoding PEA3-(341–494) was constructed by ligating aBamHI/SpeI-cleaved PCR product (primer pairs ADS288/262 on template pAS333) into the same sites in pMSe4 (33Sieweke M.H.

Biol. 1994; 14: 3283-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the E-box/ets site found in the HIV-1 LTR (oligonucleotide pair ADS671/ADS672; top strand, 5′-TCGATCATCACGTGGCCCGAGAGCTGCATCCGGAGTAC-3′) and the mutated version of the E-box/ets site (oligonucleotide pair ADS881/ADS882; top strand, 5′-TCGATCATCACGTGGCCCGAGAGCTGCATGGGGAGTAC-3′). The ets-motif and E-box are underlined anditalicized, respectively. The mutated bases are indicated inboldface. In competition assays with Id3, the Id3 and PEA3 proteins were allowed to bind for 15 min at room temperature before the addition of 32P-labeled DNA probe. Antibody supershifts were carried out by adding 1–2.5 μl of anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) together with PEA3 derivatives prior to incubation with the DNA. Protein·DNA complexes were resolved on nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels cast in either 0.5× or 1× TBE (Tris-borate (90 mm), EDTA (2 mm)). Interactions between PEA3 and Id or USF proteins were investigated using GST pull-down assays as previously described (38Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3283-3291Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). 293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Duplicate transfection experiments were carried out in six-well plates using Superfect reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Qiagen). Following transfection, cells were incubated in 0.5% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 24 h prior to cell extract preparation and luciferase assays as described previously (36Yang S.-H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Transfection efficiencies were standardized by normalizing for the β-galactosidase activity from cotransfected pCH110 as described previously (36Yang S.-H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Yeast one-hybrid screening was carried out by an adaptation of the protocol described previously (33Sieweke M.H. Tekotte H. Frampton J. Graf T. Cell. 1996; 85: 49-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The yeast reporter strain Ets-Lac repwas constructed by integrating the pMSv1 reporter (33Sieweke M.H. Tekotte H. Frampton J. Graf T. Cell. 1996; 85: 49-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) into thehis3 locus of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain W3031A (MATα, ho, his3-11,15;trp1-1; ade2-1; leu2-3,112;ura3; can1-100). UntransformedEts-Lac rep was grown in YEPD medium (2% Bactopeptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% glucose) at 30 °C with shaking. Full-length PEA3 (pAS497) was used as a bait in a yeast one-hybrid screen, using the reporter strainEts-Lac rep and a mouse 11-day embryonic library cloned in pGAD10 (CLONTECH). The PEA3 expression vector pAS497 contains a galactose-inducible promoter. However, because induction with galactose resulted in a block in cell growth, presumably due to the toxicity of the PEA3 protein, no induction was used in the screen and we relied upon leaky expression of the bait protein. Transformations were carried out essentially as described previously (39Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1771) Google Scholar) and potential positives were identified by filter assays for β-galactosidase activity. Filter and liquid assays for β-galactosidase activity were carried out essentially as described previously (33Sieweke M.H. Tekotte H. Frampton J. Graf T. Cell. 1996; 85: 49-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Positive clones were verified by retransforming theEts-Lac rep reporter strain with DNA recovered from potential “positives” in the presence and absence of the bait protein. Positive interacting clones that activated the reporter only in the presence of the bait protein were sequenced, and the identity of sequences elucidated using NCBI BLAST searches. Two screens (total of 157,000 colonies screened) resulted in the identification of 13 clones that scored positive in the above tests. One of these, pAS956, encodes the C-terminal part of mouse USF-1. All figures were generated electronically from scanned images of autoradiographic images using Picture Publisher (Micrografix) or Adobe PhotoDeluxe and PowerPoint version 7.0 (Microsoft) software. Final images are representative of the original autoradiographic images. Phosphorimaging data were quantified using Tina software (version 2.08e). DNA binding by members of the PEA3 subfamily of ETS-domain transcription factors has previously been shown to be regulated by autoinhibitory mechanisms (6Brown L.A. Amores A. Schilling T.F. Jowett T. Baert J.L. de Launoit Y. Sharrocks A.D. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 7Laget M.P. Defossez P.A. Albagli O. Baert J.L. Dewitte F. Stehelin D. de Launoit Y. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1325-1336PubMed Google Scholar, 8Xin J.H. Cowie A. Lachance P. Hassell J.A. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 481-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). In the case of zebrafish PEA3, three regions have been shown to be involved in regulating DNA binding (Fig. 1A) (6Brown L.A. Amores A. Schilling T.F. Jowett T. Baert J.L. de Launoit Y. Sharrocks A.D. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 93-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Deletion of region I led to a small increase in DNA binding, whereas more dramatic increases in DNA binding were observed upon deletion of regions II and III. Combined deletion of regions II and III, to leave just the ETS DNA-binding domain, led to further enhancement of DNA binding by PEA3. To further define the extents of the inhibitory domains II and III, a series of finer N- and C-terminal deleted proteins were constructed (Fig. 1 A). Sequential deletion of N-terminal sequences up to amino acid 321 did not result in significant increases in DNA binding (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–5). However, a large increase in the efficiency of DNA binding was observed upon deletion to amino acid 341 (corresponding to the start of the ETS-domain), which was further enhanced upon simultaneous deletion of the sequences located C-terminally to the ETS-domain (Fig. 1 B; lanes 6and 7). Thus, the N-terminal extent of inhibitory domain II is between amino acids 321 and 341. C-terminally truncated proteins were tested in the context of the protein PEA3-(321–494) that contains the intact inhibitory domain II. In this case, enhanced DNA binding was observed upon deletion to amino acid 452 (Fig. 1 B,lane 9). Because PEA3-(321–474) was still inhibited (Fig.1 B, lane 10), the C-terminal extent of inhibitory domain III is located between amino acids 452 and 474. Deletion to amino acid 432 did not lead to any further increases in DNA binding, although simultaneous deletion of inhibitory domain II led to a further enhancement of DNA-binding activity (Fig. 1 B, lanes 7 and 8). Thus, the inhibitory domains II and III that lie adjacent to the ETS-domain have been mapped to short 20-amino acid motifs. Deletion of either one of these inhibitory motifs results in a decrease of autoinhibition, whereas their simultaneous deletion leads to a loss of autoinhibition. Work on the autoinhibitory mechanism used by a different ETS-domain transcription factor, Ets-1, has implicated the involvement of an inhibitory module composed of α-helices lying N- and C-terminal to the ETS-domain (9Donaldson L.W. Petersen J.M. Graves B.J. McIntosh L.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 10Skalicky J.J. Donaldson L.W. Petersen J.M. Graves B.J. McIntosh L.P. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 296-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Disruption of one of the N-terminal α-helices results in relief of autoinhibition (11Jonsen M.D. Petersen J.M. Xu Q.-P. Graves B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2065-2073Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 12Petersen J.M. Skalicky J.J. Donaldson L.W. McIntosh L.P. Alber T. Graves B.J. Science. 1995; 269: 1866-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Little sequence conservation exists between Ets-1 and PEA3 in the regions immediately outside the ETS-domain. However, to test whether a similar mechanism involving interacting α-helices might operate in PEA3, proline-scanning mutagenesis was used to probe for the presence of functionally important α-helices in inhibitory motifs II and III. Because proline residues are incompatible with regular α-helices, the insertion of proline residues is expected to disrupt these secondary structure elements. Several conserved proline residues exist in the regions flanking the ETS-domain (Fig.2 A). Further proline residues were introduced in the sequences between these residues (Fig.2 A), and their effect on DNA binding by PEA3 was monitored (Fig. 2, B and C). The position of proline insertions was chosen so that the spacing between any two proline residues was less than a full helical turn. First, the effect of inserting proline residues into inhibitory motif II in the context of PEA3-(258–452) was investigated. This protein has lost the C-terminal inhibitory domain III. However, neither of the two mutations tested caused an increase in DNA binding by PEA3 (Fig. 2 B). Similarly, the insertion of proline residues at several positions into inhibitory motif III in PEA3-(321–474) (containing inhibitory domains II and III), caused little stimulation of DNA binding activity. These data therefore demonstrate that it is unlikely that the formation of α-helices within the inhibitory motifs is a functionally important requirement for autoinhibition of DNA binding by PEA3. It was recently demonstrated that the members of the Id family of helix-loop-helix proteins can bind to members of the TCF subfamily of ETS-domain transcription factors and subsequently inhibit their DNA binding (20Yates P.R. Atherton G. Deed R.W. Norton J.D. Sharrocks A.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 968-976Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Because interaction with Id proteins is via the ETS DNA-binding domain of the TCFs, we tested whether Id proteins could also inhibit DNA binding by PEA3 (see Figs.3 A and 5A for PEA3 derivatives tested). First, we used GST pull-down assays to test whether Id2 can bind to a series of GST-PEA3 fusion proteins. Id2 could bind to both full-length PEA3 (PEA3-(1–494)) and the isolated PEA3 ETS-domain (PEA3-(341–432)) (Fig. 3 B, lanes 3and 4) but not to PEA3 derivatives that lacked the ETS-domain (Fig. 3 B, lanes 5 and 6). Reciprocal experiments were carried out in which GST-Id2 fusion proteins were used to pull-down truncated PEA3 proteins. Consistent with the above results, full-length PEA3, PEA3-(1–432), and the isolated PEA3 ETS-domain (PEA3-(341–432)) could bind to Id2 (Fig.3 C). Collectively, these data demonstrate that Ids interact with PEA3 and that the ETS-domain of PEA3 is their point of interaction. To study the functional consequences of this interaction, the effect of Id proteins on DNA binding by PEA3 was investigated. Several PEA3 derivatives (Fig. 3 A) were tested that lack one of the inhibitory motifs and, therefore, exhibit detectable DNA binding. DNA binding by all the PEA3 derivatives tested was inhibited upon titration of increasing concentrations of Id3 (Fig. 3 D). Moreover, the degree of inhibition was similar in all cases and because the minimal DNA-binding region tested is the ETS-domain (in PEA3-(341–432)), this part of the protein therefore represents the target for inhibition. Thus, binding of Id proteins to the ETS-domain of PEA3 results in inhibition of DNA binding in trans, in an analogous manner to the cis-acting inhibition mediated by the autoinhibitory module. Because DNA binding by PEA3 is tightly inhibited by intramolecular autoinhibitory motifs, this inhibition must be relieved to permit its recruitment to DNA. One such mechanism might involve interaction with a second transcription factor or coregulatory protein (reviewed in Ref.1Graves B.J. Cowley D.O. Goetz T.L. Petersen J.M. Jonsen M.D. Gillespie M.E. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1998; 63: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We therefore employed a yeast one-hybrid assay to identify proteins that might act to potentiate the activity of PEA3, either via providing linkages to the basal machinery, recruitment to the DNA or a combination of both. The system we used was adopted fr"

Using the globular C1q domain as a bait in the yeast two-hybrid system, we have isolated a cDNA encoding a novel protein. Determination of the entire primary structure demonstrated that this EMILIN-binding polypeptide is highly homologous to EMILIN. The domain organization is superimposable, one important difference being a proline-rich (41%) segment of 56 residues between the potential coiled-coil region and the collagenous domain absent in EMILIN. The entire gene (localized on chromosome 18p11.3) was isolated from a BAC clone, and it is structurally almost identical to that of EMILIN (8 exons, 7 introns with identical phases at the exon/intron boundaries) but much larger (about 40 versus 8 kilobases) than that of EMILIN. Given these findings we propose to name the novel protein EMILIN-2 and the prototype member of this family EMILIN-1 (formerly EMILIN). The mRNA expression of EMILIN-2 is more restricted compared with that of EMILIN-1; highest levels are present in fetal heart and adult lung, whereas, differently from EMILIN-1, adult aorta, small intestine, and appendix show very low expression, and adult uterus and fetal kidney are negative. Finally, the EMILIN-2 protein is secreted extracellularly by in vitro-grown cells, and in accordance with the partial coexpression in fetal and adult tissues, the two proteins shown extensive but not absolute immunocolocalization in vitro.

Bot S. Bonaldo P. Colombatti A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The presence of a gC1q domain and the recent identification that gC1q is structurally homologous to the tumor necrosis factor family of growth factors (22Shapiro L. Scherer P.E. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 335-338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) allowed the inclusion of EMILIN in the C1q/tumor necrosis factor superfamily of proteins (21Doliana R. Bot S. Bonaldo P. Colombatti A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The gC1q-like domain is shared with several other ECM constituents including type VIII and type X collagens in which it represents the equivalent of the C propeptide of fibrillar collagens (23Sage H. Pritzl P. Bornstein P. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5747-5755Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 24Kittleberger R. Davis P.F. Greenhill N.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Given the tissue distribution of EMILIN, its proadhesive functions, and the characteristics of its domains, it is likely that EMILIN plays a fundamental role in the process of elastogenesis and might associate with other ECM constituents. However, their identification is difficult because of the low solubility of the tissue form (15Bressan G.M. Castellani I. Colombatti A. Volpin D. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 13262-13267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by the very large size of recombinant EMILIN (26Mongiat M. Mungiguerra G. Bot S. Mucignat M.-T. Giacomello E. Doliana R.

To bypass these problems we have decided to isolate potential interactors of EMILIN by the yeast two-hybrid system that allows the measurement of specific protein-protein interactions in vivo; a vector encompassing the C-terminal gC1q-like domain that has previously been shown to interact with itself to form homotrimers (26Mongiat M.

In the present study this vector was used as a bait to screen a human kidney cDNA library and allowed the identification of a novel protein that interacts with EMILIN via their gC1q domains.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 27Colombatti A. Doliana R. Bot S. Canton A. Mongiat M. Mungiguerra G. Paron-Cilli S. Spessotto P. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) is homologous to EMILIN, it is encoded by a distinct gene, and differs in part from EMILIN in the tissue-specific expression pattern. Its mRNA was detected in a variety of human organs including fetal heart, lung placenta, and spinal cord. We propose to classify the EMILINs as a new family of extracellular proteins and to name its members as EMILIN-1 (formerly EMILIN) and EMILIN-2 (this study). TheSaccharomyces cerevisiae strain EGY48 (p8op-lacZ;MATα,his3,trp1,ura3,LexAop(x6)-LEU2) carrying the reporter plasmid p8pop-LacZ and YM4271 (MATa,ura3–52,his3–200,lys2–801,ade2–101,ade5,trp1–901,leu2–3,112,tyr1–501,gal4-d512,gal80-D538,ade5-hisG) was used for all assays. Yeast cultures were grown at 30 °C in either YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% glucose) or SD minimal medium (0.5% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose, and 1% desired amino acid dropout solution). Growth and manipulation of yeast strains was carried out using the procedures described in the Matchmaker Two-Hybrid system user manual (CLONTECH Laboratories Inc., Palo Alto, CA). For our studies, a bait was constructed by cloning in the LexA plasmid the C-terminal domain of EMILIN-1 (gC1q-1), generated by PCR amplifications using 1 ng of pCEpu-EMILIN template (26Mongiat M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 25471-25480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), 10 pm each primer (see below), one unit of Taq polymerase (Promega Corp.), 0.2 mm each of the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates (Pharmacia Ultrapure; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), in a final volume of 100 μl of 1× Promega PCR buffer (Promega Corp.). The primers used were as follows: sense, 5′-GGGAATTCGCACCAGCAGCCCCTGTG-3′; and antisense, 5′-CCCTCGAGCTACGCGTGTTCAAGCTCTGG-3′. The underlined bases correspond to appended EcoRI (sense) and XhoI (antisense) restriction enzyme recognition sites plus two additional protective nucleotides. The PCR fragments were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes, ligated overnight in pLexA vector, in frame with the DNA-binding domain, and transformed in theEscherichia coli competent DH5α strain. Ampicillin-resistant colonies were screened for the presence of the PCR fragment by restriction analysis of their plasmids. The nucleotide sequences of plasmids carrying the insert, as determined by restriction analysis, were performed by automatic sequencing, and a selected plasmid was used as a bait in the library screening. To screen for interacting proteins the EGY48 cells were sequentially transformed with the bait and with a human kidney Matchmaker cDNA library (CLONTECH) using the LiAc method. Clones were examined for transcriptional activation of reporter genes Leu- and β-galactosidase indicating interaction between bait/binding domain and library/activation domain constructs. Only clones meeting all standard two-hybrid specificity tests were considered as positive. These tests included absence of an interaction between the target construct and p53 and pLaminC-negative control constructs and the inability of colonies containing the target construct alone, or the target and the bait vectors without any insert, to pass Leu− and β-galactosidase assay. Positive clones were sequenced. The entire coding sequence of the cDNA isolated in the yeast two-hybrid system was determined by cDNA library screening. The insert from one selected yeast two-hybrid system clone (about 1000 bp) was labeled by the random primer method with a multiprime kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and utilized to screen, by the plaque hybridization method, about 300,000 clones of a human kidney cDNA library in the λgt10 vector (CLONTECH). Successive rounds of screening of a human aorta cDNA library in the λgt10 vector with the most 5′-end clones resulted in the isolation of overlapping clones comprising the full-length cDNA of EMILIN-2. The sequences were performed using the Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing kit and a model 310 DNA sequencing system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). To correct for possible Taq polymerase errors all sequences were determined from both strands and were repeated on clones obtained from independent PCR products. All human cDNA sequences were confirmed by sequencing the EMILIN-2 gene (see below). A human genomic BAC library was screened for specific clones at Genome System using a cDNA insert corresponding to the 5′-end of the EMILIN-2 (see below) cDNA. Two positive clones were identified, and one was further characterized. It was authenticated by successful PCR reamplification of insert fragments with primer pairs derived from the EMILIN-2 cDNA sequences, and it was partially characterized by restriction enzyme mapping and Southern blot analysis. Appropriate restriction fragments were gel-purified and subcloned in the pGEM 7z+ vector and then sequenced. RNA expression analysis was performed using a human multiple tissues blot fromCLONTECH. A 32P-labeled probe was synthesized using as template the EMILIN-binding protein-1 (EBP-1) clone and the multiprime labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization was performed at 65 °C in Rapid-hyb buffer. After film exposure the blot was stripped and hybridized with a32P-labeled EMILIN-1 probe. All the other procedures were performed using standard techniques. The sequence corresponding to the C-terminal domain of EMILIN-2 (gC1q-2) was amplified from the yeast two-hybrid system template (see above) with the following primers: sense, 5′-GGGGATCCGGGCGGGGTCTGCCGCG-3′; and antisense, 5′-GGGGTACCTTAGAGGTGGGAAAGGAAAGGAT, where the underlined nucleotides correspond to appended BamHI (sense) andKpnI (antisense) restriction enzyme recognition sites plus two additional protective nucleotides. The amplified gC1q-2 fragment was then ligated in frame in the 6His-tagged pQE-30 expression vector (Qiagen) and transformed in M15 cells. Positive clones were isolated, and the cloned fragment was sequenced in both directions to check for errors generated by PCR. 500 ml of liquid culture grown at 0.6A600 nm was induced with 2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37 °C. The culture was then centrifuged at 4000 × gfor 20 min, and the cell pellet was resuspended in sonication buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 0.3 m sodium chloride) at 5 volumes per gram of wet weight. The samples were frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath, thawed in cold water, and sonicated on ice (1 min bursts/1 min cooling/2–300 watts), and cell breakage was monitored by measuring the release of nucleic acids atA260 nm. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min, the supernatant was collected, and purification of the 6His-tagged recombinant fragment was performed by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen) under native conditions. The recombinant protein was eluted from the affinity column in sonication buffer, pH 6.0, containing 10% glycerol and 0.2 m imidazole. BALB/c mice were immunized with the recombinant gC1q-2 fragment, and hybridomas that reacted with the antigen in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay assay were selected and subcloned twice before using. Indirect immunofluorescence of cells grown on tissue culture glass chamber slides (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL) was carried out on cells fixed in 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min before incubation with the a polyclonal rabbit anti-EMILIN-1 antiserum or a murine anti-EMILIN-2 (gC1q-2 domain) monoclonal antibody. These two antibody reagents are specific for their respective antigens and did not show any cross-reactivity (data not shown). The slides were then incubated with fluorescein-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (for EMILIN-1) or with rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (for EMILIN-2) and examined under the confocal laser (MRC-1024, Bio-Rad laboratories, Hercules, CA) scanning microscope (Diaphot 200, Nikon Inc., Melville, NY). The two hybrid system was used to screen for potential interactors with the gC1q domain of EMILIN. A segment spanning the gC1q domain of EMILIN (residues 845 to 995 of the published sequence; see Ref. 20Doliana R. Mongiat M. Bucciotti F. Giacomello E. Deutzmann R. Volpin D. Bressan G.M.

A library of human kidney cDNAs in the pB42-activating domain was then introduced to the transformants, and the colonies growing in the absence of the Leu/His/Trp/Ura markers were selected. Among the 5 × 106 cells transformed in total, 87 colonies were Leu-positive. After the β-galactosidase assay, 7 clones of 20 positive colonies were selected and identified as representing the same clone by DNA sequencing analysis. The interaction was specific, because neither the LexA DNA-binding domain-gC1q hybrid interacted with the unfused pB42-activating domain, nor did a pB42-activating domain-unrelated hybrid clone from the library with the unfused LexA-binding domain (data not shown). Fusing the original bait (gC1q-1) into the pB42-activating domain vector and the target protein into the LexA-binding domain vector also gave a positive result. One clone, EBP-1, was then further characterized. The EBP-1 cDNA isolated contained 1000 nucleotides and encoded an in frame 192-amino acid-long open reading frame with high homology to the C-terminal end of EMILIN, including part of the collagenic region and the entire gC1q domain. The stop codon is followed by a quite long 3′-untranslated region. To obtain the full-length open reading frame, the cDNA was extended by screening a human aorta library in λgt10. Five partly overlapping cDNA clones were sequentially isolated using initially the EBP-1 fragment as the probe and then probes derived from subclones at the 5′-end of each successively isolated clone (Fig.1, bottom). A composite nucleotide sequence of about 3900 base pairs was then obtained from the overlapping clones. A data bank search indicated that this novel protein (provisionally called EBP), has not been identified previously, and several partially overlapping expressed sequence tag entries showed a good match with different regions of the human EMILIN-1 transcript (20Doliana R.

However, expressed sequence tag clones harbored a total of 26 mismatches as compared with EBP-1, including base replacements resulting in amino acid substitutions and single base insertions or deletions. Independent sequencing of BAC clones confirmed the present sequence. The complete coding sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence and the complete 3′-untranslated region of the novel protein (GenBankTM accession number AF270513) is shown in (Fig. 2).Figure 2Nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequence of human EMILIN-2.First line, nucleotide sequence;second line, deduced amino acid sequence.

Therefore, residues −30/−1 correspond most likely to the signal peptide as it agrees with the classical consensus sequence (29Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Hejne G.

Biol. 1983; 167: 391-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Thus, the mature protein consists of 1023 amino acids, with a calculated molecular mass of 112 kDa, and a statistical pI of 3.8. It contains 8 potentialN-glycosylation sites and 20 cysteines with a number of them clustered as doublets, separated by none or two residues, that could be involved in intramolecular disulfide bonding. We had previously reported on the isolation and characterization of EMILIN (20Doliana R. Mongiat M. Bucciotti F. Giacomello E. Deutzmann R. Volpin D. Bressan G.M. Colombatti A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16773-16781Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), a multimodular protein composed by a C-terminal gC1q domain, a short collagenic domain, a long region with high propensity to form coiled-coil structures and, at the N terminus, a characteristic cysteine-rich domain (EMI domain; see Ref. 21Doliana R. Bot S. Bonaldo P. Colombatti A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 484: 164-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The primary structure of the novel protein reported here, including the lack of a transmembrane segment, the presence of a putative secretory signal peptide, and the overall sequence composition and domain organization suggests that this gene product is an EMILIN-related ECM protein that may also form oligomers via its C-terminal gC1q domain and the potential coiled-coil domain (see Fig. 1, top). Based on the primary sequence, on the domain composition, and on the gene structure organization (see below), EMILIN and EBP were renamed EMILIN-1 and EMILIN-2, respectively. The novel protein includes an N-terminal EMI domain and a C-terminal gC1q domain, which both have up to 70% sequence similarity with the corresponding human EMILIN-1 domains. Pairwise alignment of the EMILINs further emphasizes the close kinship between these two members. In the C1q domain, for example, both protein present an insertion of 10 amino acids in comparison to all the other members of the C1q-containing proteins family, one of which, ACRP30/Adipo Q, is shown for comparison in Fig.3B. The EMI domain at the N terminus is much more conserved between the two proteins in comparison to the other EMI domain-containing gene products (Fig. 3A). The short collagenic stretch of 17 triplets present in EMILIN-1 is conserved in EMILIN-2, although in the latter there are four imperfections. Although lacking any detectable sequence homology in the extended central region, EMILIN-1 and EMILIN-2 have structural motifs, consisting of heptad repeats in which positions 1 and 4 are preferentially occupied by aliphatic moieties and positions 5 and 7 are filled with polar residues, in common. The presence of these repeats, which are characteristic of coiled-coil α helices (Fig.4, top), also suggest that EMILIN-2 might form extended homoassociations, as was determined to be the case for EMILIN-1 (26Mongiat M. Mungiguerra G. Bot S. Mucignat M.-T. Giacomello E. Doliana R. Colombatti A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25471-25480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Finally, one striking difference between the two members was the finding that in EMILIN-2 the collagenic region is preceded by a sequence, absent in EMILIN-1, characterized by an unusually high proline content. This novel proline-rich 55-residue-long sequence, in which the proline content exceeds 41% (compared with an 8–12% of proline content in the EMI and gC1q domains and a 2–4% in the coiled-coil regions), might be implicated in additional protein-protein interactions.Figure 4Sequences of the intron:exon junctions of the human EMILIN-2 gene.

https://openalex.org/W2011899140,"The sequence of human myoglobin (Mb) is similar to that of other species except for a unique cysteine at position 110 (Cys110). Adding hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to human Mb affords Trp14-peroxyl, Tyr103-phenoxyl, and Cys110-thiyl radicals and coupling of Cys110-thiyl radicals yields a homodimer through intermolecular disulfide bond formation (Witting, P. K., Douglas, D. J., and Mauk, A. G. (2000) J. Biol. Chem.275, 20391–20398). Treating a solution of wild type Mb and H2O2 with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) at DMPO:protein ≤ 10 mol/mol yields DMPO-Cys110 adducts as determined by EPR. At DMPO:protein ratios (25–50 mol/mol), both DMPO-Tyr103 and DMPO-Cys110 adducts were detected, whereas at DMPO:protein ≥ 100 mol/mol only DMPO-Tyr103 radicals were present. The DMPO-dependent decrease in DMPO-Cys110 was matched by a near 1:1 stoichiometric increase in DMPO-Tyr103. In contrast, reaction of the Y103F human Mb with H2O2 gave no DMPO-Cys110 at DMPO:protein ≤ 10 mol/mol, and only trace DMPO-Cys110at DMPO:protein ≥ 100 mol/mol (i.e. conditions that consistently gave DMPO-Tyr103 in the case of wild type Mb). No detectable homodimer was formed by incubation of the Y103F variant with H2O2. However, the homodimer was detected in a mixture of both the Y103F and C110A variants of human Mb upon treatment with H2O2(C110A:Y103F:H2O2 2:1:5 mol/mol/mol); the yield of this homodimer increased with increasing ratios of C110A:Y103F. Together, these data suggest that addition of H2O2 to human Mb can produce Cys110-thiyl radicals through an intermolecular electron transfer reaction from Cys110 to a Tyr103-phenoxyl radical.

Chem. 1993; 268: 803-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) mechanisms. Also, it has been proposed that free radical damage in proteins may well occur with a chain process similar to that for lipid peroxidation (15Neuzil J. Gebicki J.M. Stocker R. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 601-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). One example of radical translocation is provided by the protein-centered radical(s) formed upon reaction of mammalian myoglobin with H2O2 (16Lloyd-Raven E. Mauk A.G. Sykes A.G. Advances in Inorganic Chemistry: Heme-Fe Proteins. 51. Academic Press, London2000: 1-49Google Scholar). Myoglobin (Mb)1 shows a limited peroxidase activity in the presence of H2O2. Reaction of Mb and H2O2 yields water with the concomitant formation of ferryl (Fe(IV)=O) heme and a porphyrin radical cation (16Lloyd-Raven E. Mauk A.G. Sykes A.G. Advances in Inorganic Chemistry: Heme-Fe Proteins. 51. Academic Press, London2000: 1-49Google Scholar). At H2O2:protein ratios of ≤5, reaction of ferric or metmyoglobin (metMb) with H2O2yields both ferryl (Fe(IV)=O) Mb and protein radicals (globin⋅) (17George P. Irvine D.H. Biochem. J. 1952; 52: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Although the ferryl Mb is stable for hours at room temperature and is characterized readily by electronic absorption spectroscopy (17George P. Irvine D.H. Biochem. J. 1952; 52: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), the identity of the Mb residue(s) that form globin⋅ in the presence of H2O2 has been the subject of some controversy. The precise location of the radical on the protein likely depends to some extent on both the mechanism by which it is formed and the stability of the radical species formed at a particular amino acid residue (14Rao S.I. Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 803-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Globin⋅ have been localized to tyrosine (18Tew D. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol.

Acta. 1991; 1077: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and/or tryptophan residues (20Gunther M.R. Tschirret-Guth R.A. Witkowska H.E. Fann Y.C. Barr D.P. Ortiz De Montellano P.R. Mason R.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1293-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) that effectively stabilize the odd electron through extended delocalization over unsaturated bonds. Additionally, globin⋅ may undergo subsequent chemistry (20Gunther M.R. Tschirret-Guth R.A. Witkowska H.E. Fann Y.C. Barr D.P. Ortiz De Montellano P.R. Mason R.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1293-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and is capable of oxidizing other biological molecules (21Kelman D., J. DeGray J.A Mason R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7458-7463Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, hydroxyl radicals do not appear to be involved in the transfer of oxidative damage to either protein or target molecules (22Davies M.J. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1990; 10: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 23Turner J.J. Rice-Evans C.A. Davies M.J. Newman E.S. Biochem. J. 1991; 277: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Human Mb is similar in sequence to other mammalian myoglobins. One significant difference, however, is the presence of Cys110 (24Hubbard S.R. Hendrickson W.A. Lambright D.G. Boxer S.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). No other known mammalian Mb possesses a reactive thiol group. Recently (25Witting P.K. Douglas D.J. Mauk A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20391-20398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we investigated the reaction of human Mb and its C110A variant to evaluate the role of the reactive sulfhydryl group in the reaction of this protein with H2O2. Similar to sperm whale and horse heart Mb, reaction of human Mb and H2O2 yielded radicals derived from Trp14 and from tyrosine residues Tyr103 and Tyr146. Our data also indicated that the reaction of human Mb and H2O2 differed from the corresponding reaction of other myoglobin species by formation of Cys110-derived thiyl radical and that bimolecular coupling of thiyl radicals can lead to formation of a Mb homodimer through intermolecular disulfide bond formation. The spin trapping agent DMPO readily reacted with both Tyr103-phenoxyl and Cys110-thiyl radicals where present in reactions of human Mb and H2O2. However, the precise mechanism for the formation of the Cys110-thiyl radical on wild type human Mb was not elucidated. We now report further studies of the mechanism of Cys110-thiyl radical formation in the reaction of human Mb and H2O2 by the combined use of site-directed mutagenesis, gel electrophoresis, and EPR spectroscopy. Horse heart Mb, iodoacetamide, trypsin (Type III, 10, 200 unit/mg protein), urea, EDTA, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPO), diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA), ammonium-d-camphor-10-sulfonate, 2-methyl-nitrosopropane (MNP), and DMPO were obtained from Sigma. DMPO was purified by stirring solutions (1 m in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) with activated charcoal (100 mg/ml) in the dark. After 30 min, the solution was filtered, and portions were stored at −80 °C prior to use (26Kotake Y. Reineke L.A. Tanigawa T. Koshida H. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 17: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). MNP was used without further purification. Solutions of MNP (500 mm in acetonitrile) were prepared immediately prior to use. Tryptone and yeast extract were from Becton Dickinson (Sparks, MD). Dithiothreitol and NaCl were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ). H2O2 was from Bio-Rad. Buffers were prepared from either glass distilled water or glass distilled water purified further by passage through a Barnstead Nanopure system. All buffers were stored over Chelex-100® (Bio-Rad) at 4 °C for at least 24 h to remove contaminating transition metals as verified by the ascorbate autoxidation analysis (27Buettner G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 125-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Organic solvents and all other chemicals employed were of the highest quality available. Restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs or Life Technologies, Inc. DNA manipulations were performed using procedures described in Ref. 28Zoller M.J. Smith M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 329-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar. Complementary oligomers were synthesized, and DNA sequence analysis was performed at the UBC Nucleic Acid and Protein Services Unit (University of British Columbia, Canada). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the pBluescript II KS (±) vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). DNA was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction with a high fidelity PfuTurbo® DNA polymerase (Stratagene). Point mutations were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis prior to protein expression in bacteria. Once the sequence was confirmed, the BamHI-HindIII fragment from the amplified DNA that also contained the mutant Mb coding was ligated to the BamHI-HindIII fragment from the vector pMb3 (29Ragavan V. Szabo A. Boxer S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5681-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) to yield the final expression vector. The circular plasmid was then transformed to the appropriate cell line for protein expression. TransformedEscherichia coli (strain AR68) containing plasmids for both the wild type recombinant human myoglobin and the C110A variant (29Ragavan V. Szabo A. Boxer S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5681-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) were obtained from Prof. S. G. Boxer. The DNA bearing the Y103F mutation was obtained by site-directed mutagenesis (above) and was used to transform E. coli DHB10 cells. For transformed bacteria (strain AR68), cells were grown at 28 °C in 10 × 2-liter flasks containing 2YT superbroth (1-liter flask: 16 g/liter tryptone, 10 g/liter yeast extract, and 5 g/liter NaCl) to an optical density (A600 nm) of 1.2–1.5. The expression of recombinant Mbs was induced by immersing each flask into a water bath (55 °C) for 5 min and then transferring the flask to an incubator operating at 42 °C. However, for the case of transformed DHB10 cells, cultures were grown at 28 °C in 10 × 2–1iter flasks containing 2YT superbroth to A600 = ∼3–4, and then the heat shock was applied in a similar fashion to that described for transformed AR68 cells. All cultures were subsequently incubated for a further 6–7 h, and the cells were harvested. Rapidly increasing the culture temperature in this manner was essential as simply increasing incubation temperature from 28 to 42 °C failed to induce protein expression. Myoglobin expressed by either cell line (isolated as a fusion product) was purified by anion exchange chromatography (Whatman DE52 resin) as described (29Ragavan V. Szabo A. Boxer S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5681-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The partially purified fusion protein(s) was reconstituted with excess hemin (heme:protein = ∼1.5) (Porphyrin Products, Logan, UT), treated with trypsin (final concentration, ∼0.1 μg/ml) to cleave the fusion segment and then further purified as described (29Ragavan V. Szabo A. Boxer S.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5681-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, recombinant myoglobin was isolated as metMb. When required, proteins were concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration (Centriprep-10 concentrators, Millipore). The yield of recombinant protein obtained from E. coli DH10B cells was significantly lower than for the original cell line used to express human Mb; however, we were forced to use the former because of unavailability of the Ar68 cells. As a result of the poor yields (≤2 mg of protein/liter of culture medium), several protein samples were pooled to obtain sufficient material for our various studies. X-band EPR spectra (293 or 77 K) were obtained with a Bruker ESP 300e spectrometer equipped with a Hewlett Packard microwave frequency counter. Mb solutions (∼0.5 mm in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) were treated with H2O2(H2O2:protein = ∼1.2–5 mol/mol) in both the presence and absence of the appropriate spin trap (spin trap:protein = 5–150 mol/mol). For spin trapping studies with MNP, the reagent was added from concentrated stock solutions to minimize effects of the organic solvent (final acetonitrile concentration in reaction mixtures, <5% v/v). Analyses of spin adducts were performed using samples (50 μl) of the reaction mixture transferred into capillary tubes with a glass pipette. The capillary was then placed into a quartz EPR tube, and the tube was transferred to the cavity for EPR analysis at 293 K. The limit of detection of a stable nitroxide (TEMPO) under identical conditions was determined to be ∼50 nm. Unless indicated otherwise, the time between removal of the sample, transfer to the appropriate cell, and tuning the spectrometer was consistently <30 s. EPR spectra were obtained as an average of 3–5 scans with modulation frequency 100 kHz and sweep time of 84 s. Microwave power, modulation amplitude, and scan range used for each analysis varied appropriately as indicated in the legends to the figures. Hyperfine couplings were obtained by spectral simulation using the simplex algorithm (30Duling D.R. J. Mag. Res. 1994; 104B: 105-110Crossref Scopus (900) Google Scholar) provided in the WINSIM program, which is available at the NIEHS, National Institutes of Health web site. All hyperfine couplings are expressed in units of mT. Simulations were considered acceptable if they produced correlation factors of R > 0.85. Peak areas were determined by integration with standard WINEPR software (Bruker). Yields of the DMPO-Cys110 and DMPO-Tyr103 adducts were determined by peak area comparison with 5 μm TEMPO prepared in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and measured under similar experimental conditions. DTPA (100 μm) was included in all Mb solutions prior to the addition of H2O2 to minimize the possibility of free transition metal-mediated decomposition of peroxide by Fenton chemistry. CD spectroscopy was performed using a JASCO model J-720 spectropolarimeter calibrated with ammonium-d-camphor-10-sulfonate as described (31Maurus R. Overall C.M. Bogumil R. Luo Y. Mauk A.G. Smith M. Brayer G.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1341: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Spectra (190–250 nm) were recorded for samples placed in a water-jacketed, cylindrical quartz cuvette (path length, 0.1 cm), and temperature was controlled with a NESLAB model RT 100 circulating water bath operated under computer control. The cuvette temperature was measured using a NESLAB RS-2 remote sensor interfaced into a computerized data acquisition system. Protein solutions (5–10 μm) were prepared in sodium phosphate buffer (10 mm, pH 7 and 8). Thermal denaturation curves were determined by monitoring ellipticity at 222 nm as temperature was increased from 25 to 85 °C (50 °C/h). Melting temperatures (Tm) are reported as the means ± S.D. from three measurements. Melting curves were transformed to ASCI text files for export to Scientist software (MicroMath, Salt Lake City, UT), which was used to calculate the first derivative of the curve for more accurate determination ofTm. The irreversibility of myoglobin folding under these conditions precluded determination of thermodynamic parameters consistent with a previous study using horse heart Mb (31Maurus R. Overall C.M. Bogumil R. Luo Y. Mauk A.G. Smith M. Brayer G.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1341: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Electronic spectra were obtained with a Cary 3E UV/Vis spectrophotometer. Mb solutions were prepared in sodium phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4), and Mb concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (ε408 nm = 188,000 m−1cm−1) (32Antonini E. Brunori M. Hemoglobin and Myoglobin in Their Reaction with Ligands. North Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam1971: 40-54Google Scholar). The pH-linked spectroscopic transitions of metMb were monitored between 280 and 700 nm from pH 6.3 to 10.5, and the corresponding pKa values were determined by fitting absorbance data obtained at 580 nm to the Henderson-Hasselbach equation with the program Scientist (MicroMath). Cross-linking experiments were performed by incubating solutions of either wild type human Mb or mixtures of the C110A and Y103F variants (protein concentration, 0.025–1 mm) with H2O2 (each in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) at a protein:H2O2 ratio of ∼5 mol/mol and 37 °C. All samples contained the iron chelator DTPA (100 μm) to minimize the possibility of Fenton-type chemistry. After 30 min, the reaction mixture was diluted with 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (final protein concentration, 25 μm), and each of the carefully matched samples was diluted further with nonreducing loading buffer (protein solution:loading buffer = ∼2 v/v). Nonreducing loading buffer was prepared by mixing 7 ml of 0.5 m Tris-Cl containing 0.4% SDS, 3.6 ml of glycerol, 1 g of SDS, and 1.2 mg of bromphenol blue, and finally water was added to 10 ml of final volume. Note that loading buffer did not contain either mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol because these reagents can reduce the dimeric product (25Witting P.K. Douglas D.J. Mauk A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20391-20398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Dilute protein samples were then heated at 90–100 °C (5 min) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) after staining with Coomassie Blue. Statistics were performed with Student's t test available in MS Excel (Microsoft), and significant difference was accepted at p < 0.05. To investigate the relationship between Tyr103-phenoxyl radicals and the formation of the Cys110-thiyl radical, we sought to prepare the Y103F variant of human Mb. It has been reported previously that the point mutation Y103F in recombinant sperm whale myoglobin destabilizes the protein sufficiently that isolation of the variant is precluded (13Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8827-8833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For this species of Mb, the destabilizing influence of the Y103F substitution can be offset by introduction of a second point mutation, K102Q (13Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8827-8833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, the expression of the corresponding Y103F variant of human Mb afforded a stable protein despite the presence of Lys102 (24Hubbard S.R. Hendrickson W.A. Lambright D.G. Boxer S.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) in the sequence for the human protein. In view of this difference in stability between these mammalian proteins to the alteration at Tyr103, we have further characterized the Y103F variant Mb by electronic absorption and CD spectroscopy and determined the pKa for titration of the water molecule coordinated to the ferric iron of the variant and wild type human proteins. The electronic spectrum obtained from solutions of the Y103F variant of human Mb exhibited Soret (409 nm) and visible bands (λmax= 505 and 631 nm) similar to those of the wild type protein (Fig.1 A), consistent with corresponding spectra reported for the wild type and Y103F/K102Q variant of sperm whale Mb (see Fig. 4 in Ref. 13Wilks A. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8827-8833Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The CD spectra for wild type human Mb and the Y103F variant of human Mb (10 mmphosphate buffer, pH 8) were also virtually identical (Fig.1 B) and indicated that the two proteins possess similar helical content at pH 7 (not shown). The melting curves for each protein afforded similar Tm values at pH 8:Tm = 77.3 ± 0.5 and 76 ± 1 °C (data represent means ± S.D., n = 3) for wild type Mb and the Y103F variant, respectively (Fig. 1 B,inset). Melting curves determined for the two proteins at pH 7 (10 mm phosphate buffer) also afforded similarTm values: Tm = 80 ± 1 and 78.1 ± 0.2 °C for wild type human and Y103F variant proteins, respectively (not shown). These Tmvalues were not significantly different independent of the pH of the buffer employed as judged by t test analyses (p≫ 0.05). On the other hand, the pKa determined for the Y103F variant was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than that of the wild type protein (8.26 ± 0.09 and 8.85 ± 0.03, respectively, mean ± SD, n = 3) (Fig.1 A, inset). This difference in pKa indicates that the Y103F point mutation probably induces some subtle change in the heme binding site that alters the binding of the water ligand. The crystal structure of a related (K45R/C110A) variant of human Mb (24Hubbard S.R. Hendrickson W.A. Lambright D.G. Boxer S.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) indicates that Tyr103resides near the surface of the protein and is the tyrosine residue nearest the heme group as is also the case for sperm whale Mb (34Takano T. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 110: 537-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). For the human protein, the point of closest approach is a phenyl carbon that is ∼3.44 Å from the edge of the heme group. Conceivably, a minor reorganization of the heme pocket that is not detected by electronic spectroscopy or by visible CD spectroscopy affords a lower pKa for the acid-base transition in the Y103F protein. Regardless of the basis for the difference in this pKa value, it is clear that the thermal stability and the electronic absorbance characteristics of the Y103F variant are comparable with that of the wild type protein. We next investigated the formation of globin⋅ in the reactions of wild type human Mb and both the C110A and Y103F variants with H2O2 using the spin traps DMPO and MNP. Addition of H2O2 to solutions of wild type human Mb containing DMPO at DMPO:protein ≤ 10 mol/mol consistently produced a product with an EPR spectrum comprised of a broad four-line signal (Fig.2 A, solid line). This broad signal was simulated well (Fig. 2 A, broken line) with hyperfine data previously reported for the trapping of thiyl radicals on human Mb at Cys110(DMPO-Cys110) (25Witting P.K. Douglas D.J. Mauk A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20391-20398Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The treatment of the C110A variant of human Mb with peroxide in the presence of DMPO under identical conditions, however, consistently gave a more complex EPR spectrum (Fig. 2 B, solid line). This complex signal was also detected in the corresponding reaction of horse heart Mb and H2O2 (Fig. 2 C) where the radical has been assigned previously as resulting from the DMPO adduct of a Tyr103-phenoxyl radical (DMPO-Tyr103) (20Gunther M.R. Tschirret-Guth R.A. Witkowska H.E. Fann Y.C. Barr D.P. Ortiz De Montellano P.R. Mason R.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1293-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Thus, the DMPO adduct derived from the reaction of C110A variant of human Mb and H2O2 was readily simulated (20Gunther M.R. Tschirret-Guth R.A. Witkowska H.E. Fann Y.C. Barr D.P. Ortiz De Montellano P.R. Mason R.P. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1293-1299Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) with the reported coupling values (Fig. 2 B, broken line), and the globin⋅ was assigned as a DMPO-Tyr103 adduct. These data support the conclusion that Cys110-thiyl radicals are thermodynamically stable end products following reaction of the wild type protein with hydrogen peroxide, whereas for Mb lacking Cys110, the Tyr103-phenoxyl radical is the most stable globin⋅produced. In marked contrast to the analogous reaction with wild type human Mb, no radical adducts were detected upon addition of H2O2 to a solutions containing the Y103F variant and DMPO (Y103F:H2O2:DMPO 1:5:≤10 mol/mol/mol) (Fig. 3 A). Furthermore, at the highest trap efficiency investigated (DMPO:H2O2:Y103F 1:5:∼100 mol/mol/mol), only a weak four-line EPR spectrum was obtained, and this spectrum exhibited hyperfine coupling identical to that for the DMPO adduct derived from trapping DMPO-Cys110 radicals (Fig. 3 B). Under these conditions, the corresponding reaction of wild type human Mb and H2O2 gave both DMPO-Cys110 and DMPO-Tyr103 adducts (e.g., see Fig. 2). Overall, the concentrations of DMPO-Cys110 radicals measured from the wild type and Y103F variant proteins varied by ∼130-fold as determined by double integration of the respective DMPO-Cys110 EPR signals from the two proteins. Collectively, these data independently confirm the alteration at Tyr103 in the Y013F variant. Radical adducts of protein-derived tyrosine phenoxyl radicals have also been reported to form with the nitroso spin trap MNP (20Gunther M.R. Tschirret-Guth R.A. Witkowska H.E. Fann Y.C. Barr D.P.

Therefore, to verify that replacement of Tyr103 resulted in the loss of the Tyr103-phenoxyl radical, MNP was employed in reactions of both the wild type and Y103F variant Mb with H2O2 (Mb:H2O2:MNP 1:5:20 mol/mol/mol). For the case of wild type human Mb, reaction mixtures treated with MNP afforded a radical with a three-line EPR spectrum after 2 min at 20 °C (Fig"
https://openalex.org/W1542417674,"We describe the molecular cloning and characterization of a novel myeloid inhibitory siglec, MIS, that belongs to the family of sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins. A full-length MIS cDNA was obtained from murine bone marrow cells. MIS is predicted to contain an extracellular region comprising three immunoglobulin-like domains (V-set amino-terminal domain followed by two C-set domains), a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail with two immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM)-like sequences. The closest relative of MIS in the siglec family is human siglec 8. Extracellular regions of these two siglecs share 47% identity at the amino acid level. Southern blot analysis suggests the presence of one MIS gene. MIS is expressed in the spleen, liver, heart, kidney, lung and testis tissues. Several isoforms of MIS protein exist due to the alternative splicing. In a human promonocyte cell line, MIS was able to bind Src homology 2-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatases, SHP-1 and SHP-2. This binding was mediated by the membrane-proximal ITIM of MIS. Moreover, MIS exerted an inhibitory effect on FcγRI receptor-induced calcium mobilization. These data suggest that MIS can play an inhibitory role through its ITIM sequences.

Leukocyte activation is controlled by a dynamic balance between stimulatory and inhibitory signals through activating and inhibitory receptors, respectively. Engagement of the B and T cell antigen receptors or Fc receptors on specific cells activates a cascade of biochemical events required for cellular activation. However, the termination of such activation signals also represents a critical component of the natural immune response. Deficiency in inhibitory pathways results in profound immune defects characterized by both decreased activation thresholds and hyperresponsive phenotypes, which often lead to autoimmunity and inflammation (1Nadler M.J.S.

In contrast, prevalence in signaling through an inhibitory receptor can result in abrogation of signal transduction and cell unresponsiveness (5Bachmann M.F. McKall-Faienza K. Schmits R. Bouchard D. Beach J. Speier D.E. Mak T.W. Ohashi P.S. Immunity. 1997; 7: 549-557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). Inhibitory receptors belong to either of two structural types, the immunoglobulin superfamily with type I membrane orientation or the C-type lectin superfamily with type II membrane orientation (reviewed in Ref. 6Vely F. Vivier E. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2075-2077PubMed Google Scholar). Some inhibitory receptors are ubiquitously expressed (7Kharitonenkov A. Chen Z. Sures I. Wang H. Schilling J. Ullrich A. Nature. 1997; 386: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (554) Google Scholar), while others display a more restricted pattern of expression (8Moretta A. Sivori S. Vitale M. Pende D. Morelli L. Augugliaro R.

Most inhibitory receptors contain one or more characteristic sequences (V/IXYXXL/V) in the cytoplasmic domain termed an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM)1 (6Vely F. Vivier E. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 2075-2077PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the tyrosine residue within the ITIM allows the binding of protein-tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and/or SHP-2 or the inositol phosphatase SHIP through their SH2 domains (12Gupta N. Scharenberg A.M. Burshtyn D.N. Wagtmann N. Lioubin M.N. Rohrschneider L.R. Kinet J.-P. Long E.O. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 13Maeda A. Kurosaki M.

Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). When recruited to the complex, these phosphatases act to block signal transduction by dephosphorylating key proteins or lipids of a signaling cascade. Thus, regardless of the structural type of an inhibitory receptor, the inhibitory mechanism is similar. The siglec family is composed of sialic acid-binding immunolgobulin-like type I lectins including sialoadhesin (siglec 1), CD22 (siglec 2), CD33 (siglec 3), MAG, myelin-associated glycoprotein (siglec-4a), the structurally and functionally related SMP, Schwann cell myelin protein (siglec 4b), and the recently cloned human siglecs 5, 6, 7/p75/AIRM1, and 8 (15Crocker P.R.

Siglec family members have variable numbers of extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains (ranging from two in CD33 to 17 in sialoadhesin) with the characteristic amino-terminal V-set domain followed by C2-set domains (23Kelm S. Schauer R. Crocker P.P. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 24May A.P. Robinson R.C. Vinson M. Crocker P.R. Jones E.Y. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 719-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The common feature of these proteins is their recognition of sialic acid residues on cell surface glycoproteins and glycolipids, which is mediated by the amino-terminal V-set domain of a siglec (23Kelm S. Schauer R. Crocker P.P. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 913-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 24May A.P. Robinson R.C. Vinson M. Crocker P.R. Jones E.Y. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 719-728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Although recognition of sialic acid residues is a hallmark feature of all siglecs, the specificity of binding has been shown for certain family members in terms of their preferences for the position of a sialic acid residue on N-linked oligosaccharides as well as in the binding of ligands expressed on different cell types (23Kelm S.

Moretta A. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 793-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), implying a specific function for each family member. Indeed, it is believed that sialoadhesin is involved in regulation of macrophage function (25Crocker P.R. Hartnell A. Munday J. Nath D. Glycoconj. J. 1997; 14: 601-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar); MAG is implicated in myelinogenesis (26Umemori H. Sato S. Yagi T. Aizawa S. Yamamoto T. Nature. 1994; 367: 572-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), while CD22 serves to inhibit signaling through the B-cell antigen receptor via binding of SHP-1 tyrosine phosphatase to its ITIMs (27Doody G.M. Justement L.B. Delibrias C.C. Matthews R.J. Lin J. Thomas M.L. Fearon D.T. Science. 1995; 269: 242-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 28Cyster J.G. Goodnow C.C. Immunity. 1997; 6: 509-517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and the lectin function of CD22 is thought to be important in recruiting CD22 to the B-cell antigen receptor (29Tedder T.F. Tuscano J. Sato S. Kehrl J.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 481-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Although the function of the other family members remains unknown, the presence of ITIM sequences in the cytoplasmic tails of some of human siglecs renders them potential inhibitory receptors. Recently, human CD33 has been characterized as an inhibitory receptor by virtue of its ability to bind tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 (30Ulyanova T. Blasioli J. Woodford-Thomas T.A. Thomas M.L. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 3440-3449Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 31Taylor V.C. Buckley C.D. Gouglas M. Cody A.J. Simmons D.L. Freeman S.D. J. Biol.

Although nine human siglec proteins have been discovered, the mouse siglec family has fewer members to date: sialoadhesin, MAG, SMP, CD22, and CD33. Structurally, sialoadhesin, MAG, SMP, and CD22 are very similar in mice and humans. In contrast, human and mouse CD33, although somewhat similar in their extracellular domains, are strikingly different in their transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions. Human CD33 contains two ITIM sequences in the cytoplasmic tail, whereas mouse CD33 does not. Recent characterization of several ITIM-containing human siglecs implies that there must be murine ITIM-containing siglecs. Here we describe the molecular cloning and characterization of a novel murine ITIM-containing myeloid cell-restricted inhibitory siglec, MIS. EL4 and WEHI231 cells, murine T and B cell lines, respectively, the human monocytic cell line, U937, and human epithelioid carcinoma cell line, HeLa, were obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA). The murine B cell line, A20, was a generous gift from Dr. A. C. Chan (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). Murine monocyte/macrophage cell lines, J774 and WEHI265.1, as well as NK cell lines, KY-1 and KY-2, and the P815 mastocytoma cell line were generous gifts from Dr. W. M. Yokoyama (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). The murine T cell hybridoma, 3A9H, was a generous gift from Dr. P. M. Allen (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). EL4, A20, WEHI231, J774, and p815 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 0.1 mm nonessential amino acids, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. WEHI265.1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS. KY-1 and KY-2 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/ml interleukin-2. All media were supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. U937 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS andl-glutamine. HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum andl-glutamine. Mouse bone marrow cells were obtained by flushing the femurs of euthanized mice with phosphate-buffered saline. Murine peritoneal macrophages were aspirated from the peritoneal cavity of the euthanized mice 2 days following intraperitoneal thioglycolate injection. Antibodies used in this study included an anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody (mAb), 4G10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Lake Placid, NY), the anti-Flag M2 mAb (Sigma), the anti-SHP2 mAb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), the anti-FcγRI mAb (Medarex, Inc., Annandale, NJ), rabbit anti-vesicular stomatitis virus serum (Access Biomedical, San Diego, CA), cross-linking goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA), and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Cappel Organon Teknika Corp., West Chester, PA). Rabbit anti-SHP-1 antiserum was previously described (32Plas D.R. Johnson R. Pingel J.T. Matthews R.J. Dalton M. Roy G. Chan A.C. Thomas M.L.

Total RNA was isolated from 1 × 107 mouse bone marrow cells, peritoneal macrophages, or various murine cell lines using RNAzolTM (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Three micrograms of isolated total RNA were reverse transcribed in 20 μl of buffer composed of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 75 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm dNTP mix, 500 ng of oligo(dT)12–18 primer (Life Technologies, Inc.) or 2 pmol of gene-specific primer, and 200 units of SuperScript transcriptase (Life Technologies). Three microliters of the resultant cDNA were used in each PCR containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.4, 50 mm KCl, 2.0 mm MgCl2, 0.2 μm dNTP mix, 10 pmol of each oligonucleotide primer, and 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Promega). PCR amplification was performed for 35 cycles. Each cycle consisted of denaturing at 94 °C for 1 min, annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, and elongation at 72 °C for 1.5 min. After the last cycle, the sample was maintained at 72 °C for 10 min. Amplification of cDNA ends was performed using 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers used in each PCR are listed in Table I. PCR-amplified cDNA fragments were cloned into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced.Table IOligonucleotide primers used for cloning and RT-PCR analysis of MISPrimerSequenceMurine CD33 primers1-aAll mCD33 primers correspond to mCD33A isoform.mCD33.1 (103–132)5′-AGGAGGGCCTATGTGTCCATGTGCCCTGCA-3′mCD33.2 (507–524)5′-GGGCTTGTGAGCAGGGG-3′mCD33.3 (779–761)5′-CCCAAGAATCAGGAGCTTG-3′MIS primersM1 (1539–1520)5′-CACAGAAGGAATGGCTCTGA-3′M2 (521–506)5′-GATGGCCAGCTTCAAG-3′M3 (370–352)5′-CTCTCTGATGTTCAGGGAG-3′M4 (1148–1165)5′-GTAAGATCCTACAGG-3′M5 (1–20)5′-TGAGAGCCTGAAGAGACAG-3′M6 (1496–1475)5′-CTAGGTGACTCTTTCCTTCTCC-3′M7 (94–113)5′-AGAGTTTTCACCCTGAATG-3′M8 (455–436)5′-GAGTCATCTTGTCCCACATG-3′M9 (745–716)5′-AGACGGATGGTCATTCTTGT-3′M10 (1065–1046)5′-AAAGTTGCACTGCTCTGTGG-3′Murine β-actin primersSense5′-GCTGTATTCCCCTCCATCGTG-3′Antisense5′-CACGGTTGGCCTTAGGGTTCAG-3′1-a All mCD33 primers correspond to mCD33A isoform. Open table in a new tab Genomic DNA was isolated from C57Bl/6 mouse tail according to standard methods. A 360-base pair PCR-amplified fragment of MIS corresponding to the first Ig-like domain of the molecule was labeled by random priming in the presence of [32P]dCTP and [32P]dGTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used as a probe. Hybridization was performed in 5× saline sodium citrate (SSC; 150 mm NaCl, 15 mm trisodium citrate), 5× Denhardt's solution, 1% (w/v) SDS, 50% (v/v) formamide, 100 μg/ml denatured herring sperm DNA at 42 °C. The blot was washed at 65 °C in 0.2× SSC and 0.1% (w/v) SDS. A mouse multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) was hybridized with the full-length radiolabeled MIS cDNA, a 0.7-kb SmaI fragment of mCD33A cDNA, and a murine β-actin cDNA control probe at 42 °C as described above. Following hybridization, the blot was washed at 65 °C in 0.2× SSC and 0.1% (w/v) SDS. The mouse SHP-1 (C453S) cDNA has been previously described (32Plas D.R. Johnson R. Pingel J.T. Matthews R.J. Dalton M. Roy G. Chan A.C. Thomas M.L. Science. 1996; 272: 1173-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). MIS constructs were made as fusion proteins composed of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSVG) and the cytoplasmic domain of MIS (amino acids 377–466). Substitutions of tyrosines by phenylalanines were introduced by PCR site-directed mutagenesis. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. SHP-1 and SHP-2 cDNAs were cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) behind the T7 promoter; CD33 cDNAs were cloned into pGEM-3Z (Promega) behind the T7 promoter. Transfection of HeLa cells was performed using LipofectAce (Life Technologies) as previously described (33Cahir McFarland E.D. Thomas M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28103-28107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). FLAG epitope tags were inserted at the amino terminus of MIS by PCR site overlap extension and into an MscI site at the carboxyl terminus of the MIS. MIS-Flag cDNA was cloned into the pLZRS retroviral GFP-containing vector (kindly provided by Dr. D. Link, Washington University). Ecotropic Phoenix cells were transfected with retroviral constructs using the calcium phosphate method, and cell supernatants were used to infect U937 cells. Green fluorescent protein-positive cells were purified by cell sorting (Cytomation). MIS-Flag cell surface expression was verified by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis following staining with biotinylated anti-Flag antibody followed by phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (Jackson Laboratories). Retrovirally transfected U937 cells overexpressing MIS and transfected HeLa cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and, where indicated, treated with 5 mm sodium pervanadate in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm NaEDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium molybdate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 5 mm iodoacetamide, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm phenylarsine oxide) on ice for 10 min. The lysates were precleared by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. An aliquot was removed as the crude lysate sample, and the reminder of the lysate was subject to immunoprecipitation with the appropriate antibody. Immunoprecipitates and crude lysates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions, and immunoblot analysis was performed. Proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to manufacturer recommendations. To ensure high expression of FcγRI receptors, parent U937 cells and those overexpressing MIS were treated with 300 units/ml of the recombinant human γ-interferon (a gift from Dr. R. Schreiber, Washington University, MO) for 72 h prior to the analysis. Cells were loaded with 3 mm Fura-2AM (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, OR) in RPMI 1640 plus 10% FCS for 40 min in the dark at 37 °C. Cells (6 × 106) were washed once and resuspended in RPMI 1640 plus 10% FCS. Primary antibody was added at a concentration of 8 μg/ml, and cells were incubated on ice for 40 min. Cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in 2 ml of calcium buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 125 mmNaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mmNa2HPO4, 1 mg/ml d-glucose, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2). Changes in fluorescence, using excitation wavelengths of 340 and 480 nm and the emission wavelength of 510 nm, were measured with a spectrofluorimeter (F-2000, Hitachi Instruments, Danbury, CT) equipped with a thermostatic cuvette holder maintained at 37 °C. Cells were warmed to 37 °C for 5 min prior to analysis. Secondary cross-linking goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (10 μg/ml) was added to the cuvette at 30 s. Intracellular calcium concentrations were calculated as described (34Rosales C. Brown E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5265-5271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Considering the sequence similarity between the extracellular domains of mouse and human CD33 and assuming at least partial similarity between the transmembrane regions of human CD33 and a hypothetical mouse inhibitory receptor, we performed a search within a mouse expressed sequence tag data base using the human CD33 transmembrane amino acid sequence in the query. The search resulted in the identification of one murine cDNA clone with 39% sequence identity to the transmembrane region of human CD33 (Fig.1 A). Moreover, there were two ITIMs in the sequence of the mouse clone similar to those of human CD33. The cDNA encoded for the transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of the protein and also contained a portion of the 3′-untranslated region. RT-PCR was used to obtain a full-length cDNA from murine bone marrow cells. The design of the forward primer (mCD33.1; Table I) was based upon highly homologous stretches of cDNA within the first Ig-like domain in mouse and human CD33. The reverse primer (M1; Table I) was based upon the sequence from the expressed sequence tag clone. A 1.4-kb PCR product was obtained and sequenced. To retrieve the 5′-untranslated region and leader peptide, a 5′-RACE strategy was employed using the M1 primer for the first strand cDNA synthesis followed by sequential two rounds of PCR amplification with a universal abridged primer and a set of nested primers, M2 and M3 (Table I). To obtain the 3′-end, 3′-RACE was performed using oligo(dT) primer for the first strand synthesis and M4 (Table I) and universal primer for the PCR amplification. In an independent experiment, the full-length cDNA was amplified from total RNA isolated from mouse bone marrow cells using M5 and M6 primers deduced from the 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE sequences (Table I). Sequence analysis of the full-length cDNA revealed that the protein had an extracellular domain of 331 residues, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain of 27 residues and a cytoplasmic tail of 93 amino acid residues (Fig. 1 B). The sequence begins with a putative hydrophobic signal peptide. The extracellular portion of the molecule contains three Ig-like domains consisting of an NH2-terminal V-set domain followed by two C2-set domains. In addition, there are 10 potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) in the extracellular region of the protein. The cytoplasmic tail contains two potential ITIM sequences. Considering (i) the myeloid cell-restricted pattern of expression of the newly isolated protein (see below), (ii) the similarity of its extracellular domain to the extracellular domains of siglec family members, and (iii) the presence of ITIM-like tyrosine-based signaling motifs, this protein was named MIS (a myeloid inhibitorysiglec). Phylogenetic analysis of the siglecs revealed that MIS, siglec 8, and siglec 7 cluster together, with MIS being most closely related to human siglec 8. The similarity between MIS protein and other family members ranges from 31% with mCD33 to 47% with human siglec 8. Amino acid sequence alignment of MIS and three other siglecs, human siglecs 3 and 8 and murine CD33, is shown in Fig.2 A. Although human siglec 8 is the closest relative of MIS and shares 57% identity with MIS in the extracellular portion of the molecule, their cytoplasmic tails are quite different. There are no ITIM sequences in the siglec 8 cytoplasmic region, whereas MIS possess two ITIM-like sequences. To this end, the cytoplasmic tail of MIS is more similar to those of the inhibitory human siglecs, siglecs 3, 5, 6, and 7 (33, 29, 29, and 33% identity, respectively) (Fig. 2 B). Thus, these data indicate that MIS belongs to the siglec family and represents a potential inhibitory receptor. To determine whether MIS belongs to a family of closely related genes or represents a single MISgene, genomic DNA from a C57BL/6 mouse was digested with a panel of restriction enzymes and subjected to Southern blot analysis. The probe employed represented an exon corresponding to the first V-set immunoglobulin-like domain of MIS. Only one band was observed for each enzyme digestion (Fig. 3), suggesting the presence of only one MIS gene in the mouse genome. To determine the expression pattern of MIS in adult mouse tissues, Northern blot analysis was performed using the full-length MIS cDNA as a probe. As shown in Fig. 4 A, four mRNA species of ∼1.6, 1.8, 2.2, and 3.0 kb were detected in different tissues. A transcript of 2.2 kb was expressed (in descending order) in spleen, liver, heart, kidney, and lung (in the latter two tissues this transcript could only be detected after prolonged exposure). In addition to the 2.2-kb transcript, two smaller transcripts were detected in these tissues. The 1.8-kb transcript was expressed in liver and kidney, whereas 1.6-kb transcript was expressed in the spleen and heart. When Northern blot analysis was performed using probes corresponding to the first and third MIS exons that code for the first and third Ig-like domains, respectively, only a 2.2-kb band was observed. Conversely, analysis with a probe corresponding to a cytoplasmic exon revealed multiple bands (data not shown). These data, together with the results of Southern blot analysis, indicate that there are several MIS variants due to alternative splicing of a singleMIS gene. One transcript of 3.0 kb was observed in testis. The MIS message could not be detected in murine brain and skeletal muscle. To determine the pattern of cell expression of MIS, a RT-PCR approach was utilized. cDNA was generated from different mouse cell lines, primary bone marrow cells, and peritoneal macrophages, and the expression of MIS, mCD33, and β-actin was analyzed using gene-specific sets of primers (Fig. 4 B). MIS was detected in bone marrow cells, peritoneal macrophages, and monocyte/macrophage cell lines (upper panel) but was not detected in lymphocytes including T cells (lanes 3 and4), B cells (lanes 5 and6), or NK cells (lanes 10 and11) or a mastocytoma, P815, cell line. The overall pattern of MIS expression was similar to that of mCD33 (middle panel). The efficiency of cDNA synthesis was equivalent in all of the samples as judged by the expression of β-actin (Fig.4 B, bottom panel). Hence, the expression of MIS is restricted to cells of myeloid origin. Alternative mRNA splicing is a common feature among Ig superfamily genes. Since Northern blot analysis of MIS suggested the existence of multiple mRNAs, we next examined the possibility that multiple isoforms of MIS did, indeed, exist. Mouse total RNA from bone marrow cells was reverse transcribed using the MIS-specific primer, M1, and then three differ"
https://openalex.org/W1510530195,"CC(A/T)6GG or serum response elements represent a common regulatory motif important for regulating the expression of many smooth muscle-specific genes. They are multifunctional elements that bind serum response factor (SRF) and are important for serum induction of genes, expression of muscle-specific genes, and differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells. In the current study, a yeast two-hybrid screen was used to identify proteins from mouse intestine that interact with SRF. A novel homeodomain-containing transcription factor, called Barx2b, was identified that specifically interacts with SRF and promotes the DNA binding activity of SRF. Northern blotting, RNase protection analysis, and Western blotting revealed that Barx2b mRNA and protein are expressed in several smooth muscle-containing tissues, as well as in skeletal muscle and brain. In vitro binding studies using bacterial fusion proteins revealed that the DNA-binding domain of SRF interacts with a region of Barx2b located amino-terminal of the homeobox domain. The results of these studies support the hypothesis that interaction of SRF with different homeodomain-containing proteins may play a critical role in determining the cell-specific functions of SRF.

The results of these studies support the hypothesis that interaction of SRF with different homeodomain-containing proteins may play a critical role in determining the cell-specific functions of SRF. Analysis of several smooth muscle-specific genes has, thus far, failed to identify any smooth muscle-restricted transcription factors that control their expression (reviewed in Ref. 1Owens G.K. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1998; 164: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Data have suggested that expression of a single smooth muscle-specific protein may be regulated by distinct response elements and distinct transcription factors in different smooth muscle tissues. For example, the telokin promoter was found to require an estrogen response element for high levels of expression in uterine smooth muscle, but this element is not required for expression in intestinal smooth muscle (2Smith A.F. Bigsby R.M. Word R.A. Herring B.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: C1188-C1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, several fragments of the SM22α promoter that have been shown to be sufficient to mediate expression in arterial smooth muscle do not result in detectable expression in visceral smooth muscle (3Li L. Miano J.M. Mercer B. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 849-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 4Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C. Parmacek M.S. Mol. Cell.

CC(A/T)6GG (CArG)1 or serum response elements (SREs) have been shown to be critical for the activity of most smooth muscle-specific promoters characterized (4Kim S. Ip H.S. Lu M.M. Clendenin C.

Chem. 2000; 275: 9814-9822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar); thus, it appears likely that CArG elements represent a common regulatory motif important for regulating the expression of smooth muscle-specific genes. CArG or SRE elements bind serum response factor (SRF), a protein that plays an important role in both the expression of muscle-specific genes and serum induction of genes (12Norman C. Runswick M. Pollock R. Treisman R. Cell. 1988; 55: 989-1003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Consistent with its role in regulating expression of muscle-specific genes, although SRF is widely expressed, it is present at the highest levels in skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle-containing tissues (13Belaguli N.S. Schildmeyer L.A. Schwartz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18222-18231Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating the activity of smooth muscle-specific promoters, SRF has also been directly shown to be required for the differentiation of proepicardial cells into coronary vascular smooth muscle cells (14Landerholm T.E. Dong X.R. Lu J. Belaguli N.S. Schwartz R.J. Majesky M.W. Development. 1999; 126: 2053-2062Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is likely that SRF bound to CArG elements in smooth muscle-specific genes may be interacting with other tissue-restricted factors to mediate tissue-specific gene expression. Given its broad pattern of expression, it seems likely that the interaction of SRF with other factors determines whether SRF functions to activate muscle-specific genes or to confer serum inducibility to a gene. For example the smooth muscle α-actin gene contains several CArG elements that are required for transcriptional activity; however, the endogenous gene or a reporter gene containing a 1063-bp fragment of the promoter is not induced by serum. In contrast, a truncated 191-bp α-actin promoter fragment is induced by serum (15Stoflet E.S. Schmidt L.J. Elder P.K. Korf G.M. Foster D.N. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), suggesting that within this single gene, the function of SRF bound to CArG elements is dependent on interactions with factors that bind to other elements within the gene. Similarly, although SRF has been shown to be required for telokin promoter activity, endogenous telokin is not induced by serum. 2B. P. Herring, unpublished observation. 2B. P. Herring, unpublished observation. In the current study, we have used a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins from mouse intestine that interact with SRF. These studies show that a novel homeodomain-containing transcription factor, Barx2b, specifically interacts with SRF and promotes the DNA binding activity of SRF. To identify proteins that interact with SRF, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a mouse intestine cDNA library using the yeast strain Y190 (Matchmaker Two-hybrid system; CLONTECH). This yeast strain containsLacZ and His3 reporter genes downstream of a minimal ADH promoter and three DNA binding sites for GAL4. The human cDNA for SRF (a generous gift from Dr. R. Prywes, Columbia University, New York, NY) was fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain in plasmid pGBT9 (CLONTECH). A cDNA library was constructed in pGAD10, from mouse intestinal mRNA, using a two-hybrid cDNA construction kit according to the manufacturer's directions (CLONTECH). The resultant cDNAs are fused to the carboxyl terminus of the GAL4 transcription activation domain. In the presence of 45 mm3-amino-1,2,4-triazole, the SRF-GAL4BD fusion protein did not result in colony growth or β-galactosidase activity. The identity of positive clones was determined by direct DNA sequencing. To verify that SRF interacted with the sequenced clones, these clones were reintroduced into yeast together with SRF-GAL4BD plasmid. True positive clones were identified by their ability to activate theLacZ reporter gene. The remaining cDNA obtained from construction of the mouse intestine pGAD10 cDNA library was ligated to EcoRI-digested and dephosphorylated λgt11 arms. The lambda library was packaged, amplified, and screened by standard procedures (16Stoflet E.S. Schmidt L.J. Elder P.K. Korf G.M. Foster D.N. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose filters were hybridized at 65 °C overnight with a 32P probe corresponding to the entire Barx2 clone obtained from the yeast library screen and to nucleotides 364–892 of the previously described mouse Barx2 cDNA. Filters were washed in 2× SSPE (1× SSPE = 180 mm NaCl, 10 mmNaH2PO4, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) + 1.0% SDS at room temperature for 10 min, 2× SSPE + 1.0% SDS at 65 °C for 10 min, and 0.2× SSPE + 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 10 min. Lambda DNA was isolated using Lambdasorb (Promega, Madison, WI) and digested with NotI, and the resulting fragments were subcloned into pGEM 5Z and sequenced by automated sequencing. Total RNA was isolated from adult tissues using a single-step guanidinium isothiocyanate procedure (16Stoflet E.S. Schmidt L.J. Elder P.K. Korf G.M. Foster D.N. Strauch A.R. Getz M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1073-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); 15 μg were separated on a 1.2% formaldehyde agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane under vacuum. Hybridization was carried out at 65 °C overnight with the same Barx2b probe used for lambda library screening. Final wash conditions were 2× SSPE + 1.0% SDS for 10 min at 65 °C. A 536-bp fragment of the Barx2b cDNA (corresponding to nucleotides 594–1122) was subcloned into pGEM 7Z (Promega). The plasmid was linearized with SmaI and a 32P-labeled antisense riboprobe generated using SP6 polymerase and a Maxi Script in vitro Transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer's directions. The Barx2b riboprobe was gel-purified on a 6% polyacrylamide/8m urea gel and eluted overnight at 37 °C. Ribonuclease protection assays were then performed according to the manufacturer's directions (Standard RPA II kit; Ambion). Briefly, 1 × 106 cpm of gel-purified Barx2b riboprobe was coprecipitated with 20 μg of RNA and hybridized overnight at 42 °C. Samples were digested with RNase A/T1 at a 1:150 dilution for 30 min at 37 °C and then inactivated and precipitated. Samples were solubilized in 8 μl of gel loading buffer, and half the volume was loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide/8 m urea gel run at 55 W for 2 h.35S sequencing reactions were run alongside samples to verify the size of the probe and protected fragments. To verify the integrity of each RNA sample, a control β-actin riboprobe (308 bases) was included in each of the hybridization mixes. A 245-base fragment of this probe is protected from RNase digestion by endogenous β-actin mRNA. To characterize the interaction between SRF and Barx2b in vitro, various fragments of each of the proteins were expressed as fusion proteins in bacteria. Wild type SRF and three deletion mutants were expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins. Deletion fragments were generated by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into pGEX4T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The following fragments of SRF were expressed: (a) deletion 1, encoding amino acids 1–338; (b) deletion2, encoding amino acids 1–222; and (c) deletion 3, encoding amino acids 1–132. Wild type Barx2b and six subfragments were expressed as fusion proteins with a His tag and T7 epitope tag at the amino terminus. Deletion fragments were generated by polymerase chain reaction or restriction digestion and subcloned into pET28 (Novagen, Madison, WI); all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Barx2b fragments expressed encode the following amino acids: (a) 1–283, wild type; (b) 34–283, deletion 1; (c) 124–283, deletion 2; (d) 1–133, deletion 3; (e) 26–215, deletion 4; (f) 1–123, deletion 5; and (g) 143–205, hox domain. For in vitro binding experiments, GST-SRF fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-agarose beads and then incubated with bacterial lysates containing Barx2b fusion proteins. GST and GST-SRF protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 1 h. Lysates were prepared by sonicating bacterial pellets in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Triton X-100, 500 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. Cleared lysates were incubated with glutathione-agarose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Bound proteins were collected by centrifugation and washed twice with 4 ml of lysis buffer before incubation with Barx2b lysates. Barx2b cleared lysates were prepared in the same manner as the GST-SRF lysates. After incubation at 4 °C for 1 h, glutathione-agarose-bound protein complexes were washed three times in lysis buffer without bovine serum albumin. Glutathione-agarose-bound proteins were then analyzed by Western blotting. In some experiments, SRF was expressed as a His-T7-tagged fusion protein, and Barx2b was expressed as a GST-fusion protein, and the binding experiments were carried out as described above. For generation of a polyclonal antibody to Barx2, an amino-terminal fragment of Barx2b extending from amino acid 1 to 133 was expressed in bacteria using the pET expression system (Novagen). This fragment exhibits very little homology to Barx1 and should thus produce antisera specific for Barx2. The resultant His-tagged fusion protein was purified to homogeneity using Talon beads (CLONTECH). The purified protein was used to generate polyclonal antiserum in rabbits by Covance Research Products (Richmond, CA). The specificity and titer of the anti-Barx2 antisera were confirmed by Western blotting. Western blotting of in vitro binding complexes and Barx2b expression in tissues and cells was carried out essentially as described previously (17Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P. Griffin S.A. Stull J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23936-23944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue extracts were prepared by homogenizing frozen pulverized tissue in radioimmune precipitation buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 100 units/ml aprotinin, and 0.01 m sodium phosphate pH 7.2). Mobility shift assays were performed in a final volume of 15 μl. Binding mixtures contained 0.2 ng (1.5 × 104 cpm) of end-labeled double-stranded DNA probe, 200 ng of salmon sperm DNA, 4.5 μg of bovine serum albumin, and various amounts of purified recombinant protein as indicated in a binding buffer containing 12 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 4 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. All binding reactions were incubated for 15 min at room temperature followed by 1 h at 5 °C, except where indicated. For antibody supershift experiments, antibody was added after the 15-min room temperature incubation. For experiments in which the time of incubation was varied, proteins were allowed to incubate in reaction buffer for 10 min at room temperature before the addition of probe. Incubations were then performed for the specified times, and the reactions were immediately loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel (containing 6.75 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 3.3 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, and 2.5% glycerol). Unlabeled competitor double-stranded oligonucleotides at 200-fold excess were included in some reactions as indicated in the figure legends. The sequences of the sense strand of each probe were as follows: (a) CArG probe, ACCCTATCCCTTTTATGGGAGCTGAAGGGA; (b) SRE probe, CAGGATGTCCATATTAGGACATCT; and (c) Barx2b probe, (two binding sites)CTAGCCATTAGCGAGATGTCCATTAGCGAGCTAG. Underlined nucleotides are not part of the natural sequences but were added for labeling purposes. Polyclonal antibodies to ets and SRF were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA.) For expression in mammalian cells, a fragment of the Barx2b cDNA encoding the coding region was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pcDNA 3.1 His C (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). This results in the expression of Barx2b as a fusion protein with amino-terminal 6xHis and X-press epitope tags. For some experiments, wild type Barx2b was expressed from our full-length cDNA without an additional epitope tag by subcloning the cDNA into the expression vector pCMV5. The resultant plasmids were sequenced to verify the integrity of the insert. All promoter reporter genes were constructed by cloning fragments of promoters into the pGL2B luciferase vector (Promega). The rabbit telokin promoter-luciferase reporter gene used includes nucleotides −256 to +147 of the telokin gene, as described previously (18Herring B.P. Smith A.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C1656-C1665Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The minimal TK promoter used comprised nucleotides −113 to +20 of the thymidine kinase gene; CArG-TK comprised two copies of the telokin CArG element upstream of the minimal TK promoter. Plasmids were transfected into rat A10 smooth muscle cells, REF52 fibroblasts, or COS cells using Fugene (Roche). A10 cells were grown in high-glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 20% fetal bovine serum. REF52 and COS cells were grown in media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells to be transfected were seeded at 1.4 × 105 cells/dish in 35-mm dishes. At 16–18 h after seeding, each dish was washed once with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, replaced with 2 ml of complete media, incubated with a total of 2 μg of plasmid DNA (1 μg of promoter-luciferase, 0.5 μg of Barx2b expression plasmid, and 0.5 μg of pRL-luciferase as an internal control) and 3 μl of Fugene in 0.1 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Twenty-four h later, 10-μl of extracts (400 μl/dish) were prepared for dual luciferase assays. Assays were performed using a dual luciferase reporter assay system according to the manufacturer's directions (Promega). Reporter gene luciferase activities were normalized to the luciferase activity of the internal control. For analysis of Barx2b protein expression, COS cell lysates were generated 36 h after transfection using radioimmune precipitation buffer and analyzed by Western blotting as described above. To identify proteins that interact with SRF, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a mouse intestine cDNA library in the yeast strain Y190 (Matchmaker Two-hybrid system;CLONTECH). In a screen of ∼107cDNAs, 2 of the β-galactosidase-positive colonies were identified as encoding a novel form of the homeodomain-containing protein Barx2 (19Smith D.M. Tabin C.J. Mech. Dev. 1999; 80: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 20Jones F.S. Kioussi C. Copertino D.W. Kallunki P. Holst B.D. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gene ( Amst. ). 2000; 250: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These clones were found to be dependent on SRF for activation of the reporter genes upon retransformation of plasmids into Y190 yeast cells. The nucleotide sequence of two cDNA clones isolated from the yeast two-hybrid screen of a mouse intestinal library spanned nucleotides 364–800 of the previously described mouse Barx2 cDNA (20Jones F.S. Kioussi C. Copertino D.W. Kallunki P. Holst B.D. Edelman G.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2632-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Both of the mouse intestinal cDNA clones have an insert of 84 nucleotides just 3′ of the homeobox domain (nucleotides 952–1041 in the intestinal clone, Fig.1 A) that is not present in the previously described Barx2 cDNA. The Barx2 clone isolated was used as a probe to screen a mouse intestine λgt11 cDNA library to isolate a full-length cDNA. Five cDNA clones were isolated from this screen, the longest of which was 1852 bp (Fig. 1 A). All of the cDNA clones isolated contained the same nucleotide insert as that found in the original clones identified by the two-hybrid screen. The longest clone extends the published Barx2 cDNA sequence an additional 240 nucleotides at the 5′ end and has a short poly(A) tail at the 3′ end. The 5′ region also contains an additional in-frame translation start site (Fig. 1 B). Because of the similarity between our clone and the previously published chicken Barx2b cDNA (19Smith D.M. Tabin C.J. Mech. Dev. 1999; 80: 203-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) (73% amino acid identity; Fig. 2) and the expression of both proteins in skeletal muscle (Fig.3), it is likely that our cDNA represents the mouse homologue of chicken Barx2b, hence we have referred to the protein encoded by our cDNA as mouse Barx2b. Human Barx2 also contains the inserted region present in mouse Barx2b and is homologous to the mouse protein (87% amino acid identity; Fig. 2) (21Hjalt T.A. Murray J.C.

A, Northern blot analysis of Barx2 expression. Adult mouse total RNA (15 μg) and polyadenylated RNA (1 μg) were run on a 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to a nylon membrane, and hybridized overnight at 65 °C with the 32P-labeled Barx2b riboprobe indicated in Fig. 1 (corresponding to nucleotides 662–1122).

RNA samples (20 μg (unless otherwise indicated)) and a yeast RNA control were hybridized for 16–18 h at 42 °C with a gel-purified32P-labeled antisense Barx2b cRNA probe (corresponding to nucleotides 662–1122). Samples were digested with RNase A/T1 (1:100), precipitated, run on 6% acrylamide/8 m urea gel, and visualized by autoradiography. The positions of the undigested Barx2b (524 bases) and β-actin probes (308 bases) and protected Barx2b transcripts (460 bases) and β-actin transcripts (245 bases) are indicated. It would be predicted that mRNA corresponding to the published mouse Barx2 cDNA would protect fragments of the probe of 290 and 81 bases. C, Western blot analysis of Barx2b expression in various mouse tissues and in COS cells transfected with either full-length Barx2b cDNA (rBARX2b) or empty vector (VECTOR). Tissue extracts were prepared from mouse heart, aorta, and lung and from transfected COS cells as described in “Materials and Methods.” Fifty μg of extracts was analyzed from each of the tissues, and 30 μg of extract was analyzed from the transfected cells. The positions of molecular mass markers are indicated to the left of the blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Although an open reading frame extends to the 5′ end of our clone, three lines of evidence support the designation of nucleotides 297–299 as the translation start site. First, there is a very high degree of sequence homology between the mouse and human Barx2 cDNAs 3′ of the predicted translation start site, but 5′ of this region, the sequences diverge (21Hjalt T.A. Murray J.C. Genomics. 1999; 62: 456-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 22Krasner A. Wallace L. Thiagalingam A. Jones C. Lengauer C. Minahan L. Ma Y. Kalikin L. Feinberg A.P. Jabs E.W. Tunnacliffe A. Baylin S.B. Ball D.W. Nelkin B.D. Gene ( Amst. ). 2000; 250: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Second, the size of the Barx2 mRNA estimated from Northern blots is 1.8 kb, similar to the size of the cDNA (Fig.3 A). Third, the recombinant protein expression without an epitope tag has the same apparent molecular mass as the protein present in tissues (Fig. 3 C). The expression pattern of Barx2b was examined by Northern blotting and by RNase protection analysis. Together, these data demonstrated that in the adult mouse, Barx2b mRNA is expressed at high levels in several smooth muscle-containing tissues including the ileum, stomach, uterus, aorta, and lung. It is also expressed at significant levels in skeletal muscle and brain, and no expression is detected in the spleen, kidney, liver or heart. During mouse embryonic development, there is a large increase in Barx2b expression between embryonic day 10 and embryonic day 15 (Fig. 3). Results from Western blotting experiments are generally consistent with the Northern blots and confirm that Barx2b protein is expressed in a tissue-restricted manner in adult mice (Fig. 3 C). However, it was noted that the levels of Barx2b protein and mRNA do not correlate perfectly, particularly in the lung and aorta, suggesting that Barx2b protein levels may also be regulated by posttranscriptional mechanisms. To confirm results obtained from the yeast two-hybrid analysis, GST pull-down assays were used to determine whether SRF interacts directly with Barx2b. Fig.4 shows that GST-SRF binds directly to Barx2b. This interaction was specific because no Barx2b bound to GST alone. To map the interaction between SRF and Barx2b, several deletion constructs were generated, expressed in bacteria, and used in GST pull-down assays (Figs. 4 and 5). Deletion of amino-terminal residues from Barx2b results in Barx2b mutants that still interact with SRF with high affinity (Fig.4 A, Δ1 andΔ2), suggesting that residues 1–124 are not required for binding to SRF. Similarly, carboxyl-terminal deletions to amino acid 215 or 133 did not prevent SRF binding to Barx2b (Fig.4 A, Δ4 andΔ3); however, deletion of the carboxyl terminus up to amino acid 123 dramatically decreased SRF binding (Fig. 4 A, Δ5). In addition, the Hox domain alone (amino acids 143–205) was not able to bind SRF. Analysis of Barx2b expression in the supernatants from GST pull-down assays confirmed that each of the deletion mutants was expressed at a similar level (data not shown). These data suggest that residues 123–133 amino-terminal of the Hox domain are important for the interaction of Barx2b with SRF. To determine whether the residues identified were sufficient to mediate SRF binding, amino acids 123–133 were expressed as a GST-fusion protein, and their ability to bind to SRF was determined. Results from this analysis demonstrate that GST-WT Barx2b, but not GST-Barx123–133 or GST alone, was able to bind to SRF (Fig. 4 B). These data suggest that residues 123–133 are necessary but not sufficient to mediate the binding of Barx2b to SRF.Figure 5Barx2b interacts with the MADS domain of SRF. Full-length wild type human SRF and three deletion mutants were expressed as GST-fusion proteins. GST-fusion proteins and GST alone were immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with bacterial lysates containing wild type Barx2b, as indicated. After extensive washing of the beads, bound protein complexes (PELLET) were dissolved in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-SRF antisera (top panels). The presence of Barx2b in each of the binding reactions was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of the supernatant fractions (SUP). The struc"

Many cargoes are motile only during certain cell cycle phases, suggesting that CD function may be under cell cycle control. Phosphorylation of the CD light intermediate chain (DLIC) has been suggested to play a crucial role in modulating CD function during theXenopus embryonic cell cycle, where CD-driven organelle movement is active in interphase but greatly reduced in metaphase. This down-regulation correlates with hyperphosphorylation of DLIC and release of CD from the membrane. Here we investigate the role of the key mitotic kinase, cdc2-cyclinB1, in this process. We show that DLIC within the native Xenopus CD complex is an excellent substrate for purified Xenopus cdc2-glutathioneS-transferase (GST) cyclinB1 (cdc2-GSTcyclinB1) kinase. Mass spectrometry of native DLIC revealed that a conserved cdc2 site (Ser-197) previously implicated in the metaphase modulation of CD remains phosphorylated in interphase and so is unlikely to be the key regulatory site. We also demonstrate that incubating interphase membranes with cdc2-GSTcyclinB1 kinase results in substantial release of CD from the membrane. These data suggest that phosphorylation of DLIC by cdc2 kinase leads directly to the loss of membrane-associated CD and an inhibition of organelle movement.

This movement is directed toward microtubule minus ends and allows CD to move and/or position other structures (cargo) within eukaryotic cells (1Paschal B.M. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1987; 330: 181-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar, 2Vallee R.B. Sheetz M.P. Science. 1996; 271: 1539-1544Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). CD is implicated in many important processes within eukaryotic cells during interphase, including vesicular transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus, centripetal movement of lysosomes, nuclear migration, and maintenance of organelle structure (3Lane J. Allan V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1376: 27-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). During cell division, it is likely that organelle movement is inactivated (4Robertson A. Allan V. Meijer L. Guidet S. Philippe M. Progress in Cell Cycle Research. 3. Plenum Press, New York1997: 59-75Google Scholar), while CD continues to function in the formation, alignment and maintenance of mitotic spindles, as well as the movement and positioning of chromosomes (5Suelmann R.

The CD complex consists of four distinct classes of proteins: heavy, intermediate, light-intermediate, and light chains. The ∼500-kDa cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain (DHC) is present in the complex as a dimer and is responsible for microtubule binding, ATP hydrolysis, and movement along microtubules. Two or three dynein intermediate chains (DICs) per CD complex bind to a specific region toward the N terminus of the DHC (7Habura A. Tikhonenko I. Chisholm R.L. Koonce M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15447-15453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The DIC also binds to the p150Glued protein, a subunit of another multi-protein complex called dynactin (reviewed in Ref. 8Allan V. Curr.

Four to five dynein light-intermediate chains (DLICs) are present per CD complex, binding to an N-terminal portion of the DHC near to the DIC binding site (15Tynan S.H. Gee M.A. Vallee R.B. J. Biol.

Funct. 1998; 23: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Little is known yet about the function of the DLICs. They are hyperphosphorylated in extracts made from Xenopus eggs arrested in meiotic metaphase (19Niclas J. Allan V.J. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In a well characterized in vitro motility assay (22Allan V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 879-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), this cell cycle-specific hyperphosphorylation of the DLIC correlated with a reduction in CD-driven membrane movement and a reduction in the amount of CD (and its accessory complex dynactin) on cargo membranes (19Niclas J. Allan V.J. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). On the basis of these data it has been postulated that DLICs have the following regulatory role. Mitotic hyperphosphorylation of the DLICs is proposed to cause CD to detach from cargo membranes, thus down-regulating membrane movement during mitosis. Dell et al. (23Dell K. Turck C. Vale R. Traffic. 2000; 1: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that purified cdc2 and cyclinB1 could phosphorylate recombinant chicken DLIC1 in vitro. They identified thein vitro phosphorylation site, a conserved cdc2-cyclinB1 phosphorylation motif, and showed that mutation of the phosphorylated serine residue caused the recombinant DLIC1 to become refractory to phosphorylation in meiotic cytosol (23Dell K. Turck C. Vale R. Traffic. 2000; 1: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Here we provide further evidence to support the hypothesis that phosphorylation of DLIC by a mitotically active kinase plays a key role in metaphase inhibition of membrane movement (19Niclas J. Allan V.J. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). First, we show that incubation with purified Xenopus cdc2-GSTcyclinB1 kinase removes CD from Xenopus interphase membranes in vitro. Second, we demonstrate for the first time thatXenopus DLIC within the native CD complex is specifically phosphorylated by Xenopus cdc2-GSTcyclinB1 kinase. Finally, we find that this phosphorylation occurs at a site distinct from that proposed by Dell et al. (23Dell K. Turck C. Vale R. Traffic. 2000; 1: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our results therefore implicate alternative conserved phosphorylation sites in the cell-cycle regulation of CD-driven membrane movement.

Zhang C. Hughes M. Goldberg M. Watton S. Clarke P. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3019-3030PubMed Google Scholar). The product was cloned into pBluescriptSK+ (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; plasmid pEB3), sequenced (Big-Dye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction, PE Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK), and found to encode part of a DLIC. The pEB3 insert was used as a probe to screen theXenopus oocyte cDNA library as per the manufacturer's instructions (Gene Images, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Four independent clones encoding all or part of the same novel DLIC sequence were obtained. Clone 70/1 was chosen for subsequent manipulations. Full-length N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged Xenopus DLIC1 (His6-XDLIC1) was constructed using primers BgNdLIC, 5′-gaagatctcatatggcatccgggcgtagc-3′, and rseq4, 5′-taaccagcttacagaggc-3′, and clone 70/1 as a template. The polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into pQE30 (Qiagen Ltd, Crawley, UK) to give pEB8. The BamHI/PstI fragment from pEB8 was replaced with the corresponding fragment from clone 70/1 to form pEB10, and the remaining polymerase chain reaction-generated DNA was sequenced. His6-XDLIC1 was purified from insoluble inclusion bodies under denaturing conditions using a His-Trap nickel column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The pEB3 insert was cloned into pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (plasmid pEB5a) to express an N-terminal GST fusion protein (GST-XDLIC1′). GST-XDLIC1′ was purified as per the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used to generate antibodies in sheep (Diagnostics Scotland, Carluke, UK). Crude serum from all bleeds (but not the pre-immune serum) recognized Xenopus DLICs. To remove contaminating anti-GST antibodies, serum was pre-absorbed over a GST column, then affinity-purified on a GST-XDLIC1′ column. Eluted fractions were stored at 4 °C (with 0.02% sodium azide) and used in immunoblotting experiments at dilutions of 1/500 to 1/1000. For experiments where it was critical to remove GST antibodies completely, an alternative, small scale affinity purification method was used. The C-terminal 382 amino acids of XDLIC1 were N-terminally His6-tagged in pQE31 (Qiagen Ltd; pEB7). The fusion protein (His6-XDLIC′) was enriched by isolation of insoluble inclusion bodies using B-PER (Pierce & Warriner (UK) Ltd., Chester, UK), subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Protran, Schleicher and Schuell), and visualized using Ponceau S (0.2% in 3% trichloroacetic acid). The His6-XDLIC′ band was excised and used to affinity purify anti-XDLIC antibodies as described (25Liu B. Cyr R.J. Palevitz B.A. Plant Cell. 1996; 8: 119-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Both types of affinity-purified antibody and the crude serum were able to immunoprecipitate Xenopus DLICs under denaturing conditions and the intact CD complex under native conditions. Internet sites (NCBI, CNRS, IMGEN, EXPASY) were used for sequence analysis (26-28). Interphase and meiotic metaphase II (cytostatic factor-arrested (CSF) extracts)Xenopus egg extracts were prepared as described (29Murray A. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 30Allan V.J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 339-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). CSF extracts were converted to interphase by incubation with 0.2 mm calcium and 100 μg/ml cycloheximide for 45 min (29Murray A. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar,30Allan V.J. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 298: 339-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Membranes were floated from 200 μl of interphase extract and collected in a volume of 50 μl, as described by Lane and Allan (31Lane J.D. Allan V.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1909-1922Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) except low salt acetate buffer (20 mm potassium acetate, 3 mm magnesium acetate, 2 mm EGTA, 5 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, with KOH) replaced acetate buffer where mentioned. For Fig. 2 B, membranes were floated from 40 μl of extract. CD was purified from interphase or CSF extracts as described previously (19Niclas J. Allan V.J. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Bacterially expressed GSTcyclinB1 was purified and used to isolate active cdc2-GSTcyclinB1 kinase fromXenopus egg extracts as described (32Mayr P.S.M. Allan V.J. Woodman P.G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For membrane incubation experiments cdc2-GSTcyclinB1 kinase was prepared similarly except that detergent was omitted from the final two washes and elution. Histone kinase activity was assayed as described (32Mayr P.S.M. Allan V.J. Woodman P.G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). cdc2-GSTcyclinB1 kinase (5 μl; histone kinase activity: 50–100 pmol of phosphate incorporated into histone per μl of kinase preparation per min) was incubated with 9 μl of purified CD at room temperature for 20 min in the presence of 250 μm ATP (containing 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP), 10 μg/ml protease inhibitors (PIs: stock solution 10 mg/ml leupeptin, pepstatin, chymostatin, and aprotinin in Me2SO) and 1 mm dithiothreitol in a total volume of 20 μl. Incubations were quenched with 1 ml of immunoprecipitation buffer (80 mm sodium β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Surfact-Amps X-100 (TX100; Pierce & Warriner (UK) Ltd.), 1 μg/ml PIs), incubated on ice for 10 min, then mixed with 7 μl of anti-dynein intermediate chain antibody 70.1 (Sigma) pre-bound to 40 μl of rProteinL-agarose (Actigen, Cambridge, UK). This was rotated at 4 °C for 2 h, then supernatant was removed, and beads were washed with immunoprecipitation buffer (4 × 500 μl), immunoprecipitation buffer containing 500 mmNaCl (1 × 500 μl), and 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, containing PIs and 1 mm dithiothreitol (1 × 500 μl). SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added to the final beads, samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the dry gel was exposed to x-ray film. Immunoprecipitation of CD from in vitro phosphorylation reactions was necessary because GSTcyclinB1 was autophosphorylated by the cdc2-GSTcyclinB1 kinase and runs close to DLICs on gradient gels. Interphase membranes (∼15 μg of total protein) were added to 1 μl of cdc2-GSTcyclinB1 kinase (activity ∼100 pmol/μl/min) in the presence of 1 mm ATP and 0.5 μm microcystin LR (Alexis Corp. Ltd, Nottingham, UK) in a total volume of 25 μl of low salt acetate buffer plus 150 mm sucrose and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Kinase elution buffer (32Mayr P.S.M. Allan V.J. Woodman P.G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 78: 224-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) without detergent was used in place of cdc2-GSTcyclinB1 kinase as a control. Each incubation was pipetted into 25 μl of ice-cold low salt acetate buffer containing 150 mm sucrose, 10 μg/ml PIs, and 1 mm dithiothreitol, then layered onto and pelleted through a 150-μl cushion (0.5 m sucrose in low salt acetate buffer containing 0.5 μm microcystin LR, 10 μg/ml PIs, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) in a TL-100 benchtop centrifuge (TLS55 rotor, 32,000 rpm, 4 °C, 5 min; Beckman Instruments). Pelleted membranes were collected by careful removal of the cushion and addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, then subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose. Immunoblotting was carried out with anti-dynein intermediate chain (monoclonal antibody 1618, Chemicon International Ltd., Harrow, UK; 1/4,000 dilution) and anti-ribophorin (CEL5C culture supernatant; a gift from Prof. Birgit Lane, University of Dundee, Dundee, UK; 1/20) followed by 35S-labeled anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Basingstoke, UK), which was diluted 1/250 in Tris-buffered saline (20 mmTris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.7) containing 1% TX-100 and 1% skimmed milk powder (Marvel, Premier Brands UK Ltd, Wirral, UK). Detection was carried out using a BAS2000 imager (Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan), then densitometric analysis was carried out (AIDA 200, Version 2.0). Standard curves for DIC and ribophorin antibodies were obtained using a dilution series of floated interphaseXenopus membranes, which were run beside each experiment. The relative amount of DIC in each test sample was calculated by comparison with the DIC standard curve, after which this value was normalized for the amount of membrane (calculated by comparison with the ribophorin standard curve). Tryptic digests of recombinant or endogenous DLIC were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) using a model VG TofSpec E mass spectrometer. Recombinant His6-XDLIC (∼15 μg) or purifiedXenopus CD prepared from interphase or CSF extracts were subjected to SDS-PAGE and silver-stained (33Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7807) Google Scholar), and the appropriate bands were excised from the gel. These were digested with trypsin (Promega Corp.), and the resulting peptides were processed for MALDI-MS as described (33Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7807) Google Scholar), except that products of the enzymatic digestion were passed over Poros resin (Applied Biosystems, Cheshire, UK) before spotting onto the metal target. To obtain larger amounts of DLIC peptides for this analysis we also immunoprecipitated CD directly from crude Xenopus egg extract using anti-XDLIC1 antibody. This was carried out essentially as described (19Niclas J. Allan V.J. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) except that rProteinG-agarose (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) was used to carry the antibody. The peptide profiles of DLIC immunoprecipitated from extracts were identical to those from purified CD. Multiple alignments of published DLIC sequences from rat (17Hughes S.M. Vaughan K.T. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 17-24PubMed Google Scholar), chicken (16Gill S.R. Cleveland D.W. Schroer T.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and human (GenBankTM accession number AAB88513) were used to design degenerate primers to the amino acid sequences EKDAVFIP and SKKTGSPG. These were used to amplify DLIC sequences from a Xenopusoocyte cDNA library (24Nicolás F. Zhang C. Hughes M. Goldberg M. Watton S. Clarke P. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 3019-3030PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting polymerase chain reaction product, which showed high similarity to published DLIC sequences, was used to screen the same cDNA library. Four independent clones were identified, all of which encoded part or all of the same sequence. This sequence, which was most closely related to DLIC1s from other organisms (Table I), was called XenopusDLIC1 (XDLIC1). The XDLIC1 sequence is presented in Fig.1 and is available under GenBankTM accession number AF317841.Table IXDLIC1 is most closely related to DLIC1 isoformsRDLIC1HDLIC1GDLIC1RDLIC2HDLIC28282826465XDLIC194856366RDLIC1856163HDLIC16367GDLIC191RDLIC2Published DLIC protein sequences were compared with XDLIC1 and each other using the SIM program at EXPASY.

Numbers represent percent amino acid identity between two sequences. We have previously observed a single DLIC species by SDS-PAGE that migrates more slowly by SDS-PAGE in metaphase than interphase samples (19Niclas J. Allan V.J. Vale R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), probably owing to increased levels of phosphorylation. Here we have examined the SDS-PAGE mobility pattern ofXenopus DLICs in more detail (Fig.2) using modified electrophoresis conditions that separate multiple DLIC bands and immunoblotting with an antibody to XDLIC1. Interphase extracts, prepared either by activating a meiotically arrested CSF extract with calcium (Fig. 2 A,aCSF) or by making extracts from interphase eggs (Fig.2 B, left lane, top panel), showed three DLIC bands from ∼63 to 67 kDa, with the middle band being the major species. This complex pattern is similar to that observed in species which have two DLIC isoforms, for example bovine (17Hughes S.M. Vaughan K.T. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 17-24PubMed Google Scholar), chick (16Gill S.R. Cleveland D.W. Schroer T.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1994; 5: 645-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), and rat (17Hughes S.M. Vaughan K.T. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 17-24PubMed Google Scholar). This may indicate the presence of twoXenopus DLIC isoforms even though a Xenopus DLIC2 was not found in our library screen. CSF extracts (arrested in meiotic metaphase II) showed a major DLIC band at 70–71 kDa and a minor band at 73 kDa (Fig. 2 A,CSF). Interphase Xenopus egg extracts can be driven into metaphase by the addition of recombinant GSTcyclinB1, which leads to an activation of cdc2 kinase within 60 min, as monitored by histone kinase activity (Fig. 2 B), and a shift in molecular weight of GSTcyclinB1 (see faint uppermost band in Fig. 2 B, upper panel, recognized by residual anti-GST antibodies in the anti-XDLIC1 preparation), probably owing to its phosphorylation by cdc2 kinase (34Borgne A. Ostvold A. Flament S. Meijer L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11877-11986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (56) Google Scholar). This metaphase state can be regarded as mitotic, since there is little remaining CSF activity (a characteristic of meiotic metaphase II extracts). In the presence of active cdc2-GSTcyclinB1 kinase, the DLIC migrated as a doublet of ∼71 and 68 kDa (Fig. 2 B, 60 min,upper panel), both forms migrating more slowly than the interphase species (0 min lane). The 68-kDa band was not observed in CSF extracts (Fig. 2 A), perhaps reflecting incomplete activation of cdc2 after a 60-min incubation with GSTcyclinB1 (Fig. 2 B) or, alternatively, that there are additional kinases active in CSF extracts such as MAP kinase (35Ferrell J. Wu M. Gerhart J. Martin G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1991; 11: 1965-1971Crossref Scopus (274) Google Scholar), which might also phosphorylate DLIC. Since the DLIC bands observed in both types of metaphase extracts had higher apparent molecular weights than the interphase bands, all Xenopus DLICs appear to be phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Because we observed a 68-kDa DLIC form after incubation of interphase extracts with GSTcyclinB1 (Fig. 2 B) but not in CSF extracts (Fig. 2 A), we wanted to determine whether the CD containing this phospho isoform was released from the membrane. Floated membrane samples were therefore prepared at various times after GSTcyclinB1 addition and analyzed by immunoblotting for DLICs. Thirty minutes after the addition of GSTcyclinB1, CD remained on the membrane with a completely interphase-like pattern of phosphorylation (Fig.2 B). By 60 min, histone kinase activity was high, DLIC migrated as ∼71 kDa and 68 kDa bands in the total extract (Fig.2 B, upper panel), and both forms of DLIC had been lost from the membranes (Fig. 2 B, lower panel). This indicated that release of CD requires cdc2 kinase activity and rules out a requirement for any other kinases that are active in meiotic but not in mitotic extracts. We next tested specifically whether Xenopus cdc2-GSTcyclinB1 kinase could phosphorylate Xenopus DLICs while they were part of the intact CD complex. Active cdc2-GSTcyclinB1 kinase was incubated with interphase CD (both purified from Xenopus egg extracts) in the presence of γ-32P-labeled ATP. Intact CD complex was immunoprecipitated from this reaction mixture using a monoclonal antibody to DIC and examined by SDS-PAGE. Fig.3 A shows that a strongly radioactive protein band was detected at ∼71 kDa corresponding to DLICs that had incorporated labeled phosphate. Despite possessing potential cdc2kinase phosphorylation sites (see “Discussion”), the other CD subunits were not substrates for cdc2-GSTcyclinB1 kinasein vitro. Immunoblotting for DLICs after incubation of CD with cdc2-GSTcyclinB1 kinase (Fig. 3 B) revealed two new bands at around 71 and 68 kDa, very like the pattern observed 60 min after GSTcyclinB1 was added to interphase extract (Fig. 2 B). None of the lowest mobility interphase DLIC remained, whereas some DLIC still co-migrated with the upper interphase DLIC form. We wondered whether this phosphorylation of DLICs in the CD complex by cdc2 kinase could be directly responsible for removal of CD from membranes as extracts enter metaphase. To test this in vitrowe incubated active Xenopus cdc2-GSTcyclinB1 with membranes isolated by flotation from interphase Xenopus egg extracts. We then pelleted membranes through a sucrose cushion and immunoblotted for the DIC (to show the amount of CD) and ribophorin (an integral membrane protein to control for equal amounts of membrane) using [35S]methionine-labeled secondary antibodies. We quantitated the blot signal very carefully versus a dilution series of membrane samples loaded on the same gel to provide a standard curve for both DIC and ribophorin antibody signals (see “Experimental Procedures”). Incubation with cdc2-GSTcyclinB1 kinase caused around half of the CD (51 ± 3.2%, n = 3 ±S.E.) to be displaced from membranes as compared with the buffer only control (Fig. 3 C). Dell et al. (23Dell K. Turck C. Vale R. Traffic. 2000; 1: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) identify a conserved cdc2 phosphorylation site (site 1; Fig.4 A) as being responsible for changes in DLIC mobility on SDS-PAGE gels after in vitroincubation of recombinant chick DLIC1 with cdc2-cyclinB1 (23Dell K. Turck C. Vale R. Traffic. 2000; 1: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The implication of this finding is that this site is involved in cell cycle regulation of CD function. However, by comparing the XDLIC1 sequence with other published DLIC sequences and using consensi described by Pearson and Kemp (36Pearson R.B. Kemp B.E. Sefton B.M. Hunter T. Protein Phosphorylation. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1998: 65-83Google Scholar), we have found three additional conserved potential cdc2 phosphorylation sites in DLICs (sites 2–4; Fig. 4 B). To try to determine whether any of these sites are phosphorylated by cdc2, we isolated native CD from metaphase and interphase extracts either by classical microtubule affinity and sucrose-gradient purification or by immunoprecipitation. The DLIC proteins (and bacterially expressed His6-XDLIC1 as a control) were excised from silver-stained"

More recently, ox-PAPC and its components have been shown to induce the synthesis of MCP-1 and IL-8 in HAEC, and the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator activator receptor-α (PPAR-α) was shown to play a role in the oxidized phospholipid-mediated induction of MCP-1 and IL-8 (18Lee H. Shi W. Tontonoz P. Wang S. Subbanagounder G. Hedrick C.C. Hama S. Borromeo C. Evans R.M. Berliner J.A. Nagy L. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 516-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). However, the details of signaling pathways and the elements responsible for ox-PAPC-mediated induction of MCP-1 and IL-8 remain to be elucidated. To study the functional changes that occur in endothelial cells exposed to ox-PAPC, we recently performed a subtraction screening procedure and cloned several ox-PAPC-induced genes from human aortic endothelial cells (HAEC). 2S. T. Reddy, V. Grijalva, S. Hama, K. H. Hassan, R. Mottahedeh, D. J. Wadleigh, M. Navab, and A. M. Fogelman, manuscript in preparation. One of the genes isolated is mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase 1 (MKP-1). MKP-1 belongs to a family of inducible nuclear dual-specificity phosphatases. The dual-specificity phosphatases are able to dephosphorylate both threonine/serine and tyrosine residues (20Guan K.L. Broyles S.S. Dixon J.E. Nature. 1991; 350: 359-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). MKP-1, the first identified mammalian dual-specificity phosphatase, was initially cloned and characterized as an oxidative stress and heat shock-inducible gene (21Keyse S.M. Emslie E.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 644-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). Since a number of kinases involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and stress-activated protein kinase pathways are regulated by phosphorylation of serine/threonine and tyrosine residues, MKP-1 and its family members are considered to play a regulatory role in the MAPK and stress-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. Although there is evidence both in vitroand in vivo that members of the family of MKP proteins can regulate MAPKs and stress-activated protein kinases, definitive proof is still lacking in mammalian systems. MKP-1 knockout mice develop normally and are fertile (22Dorfman K. Carrasco D. Gruda M. Ryan C. Lira S.A. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 925-931PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, cells cultured from MKP-1 knockout mice are not impaired in either MAPK activation or inactivation (22Dorfman K. Carrasco D. Gruda M. Ryan C. Lira S.A. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 925-931PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we report the characterization of MKP-1 expression and synthesis as an ox-PAPC-induced gene in HAEC. MKP-1 is rapidly and transiently induced after ox-PAPC addition to HAEC. Our data suggest that (i) MKP-1 activity is necessary for the production of monocyte chemotactic activity in ox-PAPC-treated HAEC and (ii) MKP-1 plays a role in the ox-PAPC-induced signaling pathways that result in the production of MCP-1 protein by ox-PAPC-treated HAEC. All cell culture reagents and oligonucleotides were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., and all laboratory chemical supplies were purchased from Fisher. PAPC was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Oxidized-PAPC (ox-PAPC) was prepared as described previously (5Watson A.D. Leitinger N. Navab M. Faull K.F. Horkko S. Witztum J.L. Palinski W. Schwenke D. Salomon R.G. Sha W. Subbanagounder G. Fogelman A.M. Berliner J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13597-13607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar). HAEC were isolated and cultured as described previously (17Navab M. Imes S.S. Hama S.Y. Hough G.P. Ross L.A. Bork R.W. Valente A.J. Berliner J.A. Drinkwater D.C. Laks H. Fogelman A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 2039-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) and were used at passage levels of four to six. Unless stated otherwise, 80% confluent HAEC were shifted to M199 medium containing 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum the day before the experiments. Monocytes were isolated by a modification of the Recalde method, as described previously (23Fogelman A.M. Sykes K. Van Lenten B.J. Territo M.C. Berliner J.A. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 1243-1247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), from the blood of normal volunteers after obtaining written consent under a protocol approved by the Human Research Subject Protection Committee of the University of California, Los Angeles. Reverse transcription of poly(A)+ RNA and generation of subtracted cDNA molecules were performed using the polymerase chain reaction Select cDNA subtraction kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Subsequent cloning and analysis of the subtracted cDNA library is detailed in a manuscript in preparation.2 Total RNA from cell cultures was purified using RNeasy kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Ten μg of total RNA was subjected to electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel, transferred to Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and hybridized with random-primed (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech)32P-labeled cDNA probes for human MKP-1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Electrophoresis and hybridization protocols were described previously (24Reddy S.T. Winstead M. Tischfield J.A. Herschman H.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 271: 13591-13596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (154) Google Scholar). HAEC were set up in 6-well plates. Phosphorothioate oligonucleotides were used at a final concentration of 100 nm for all antisense transfection experiments. Appropriate amounts of the oligonucleotides were diluted in 200 μl of serum-free M199 medium in 0.5-ml Eppendorf tubes. Three microliters of SuperFect reagent (Qiagen) was added to each tube and incubated at room temperature for 15 min to allow SuperFect reagent-DNA complex formation. During the incubation the HAEC were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and supplemented with 0.8 ml of complete M199 medium. The transfection complexes were added to the wells and incubated for 2 h. The cultures were washed in PBS and supplemented with complete M199 medium. 18 h later the transfection protocol was repeated, and cultures received 50 μg/ml ox-PAPC. Six hours later, supernatants were collected and tested for monocyte adhesion activity and monocyte chemotactic activity. Additionally, total cellular protein was isolated from each experimental condition and analyzed for MKP-1 as described below. The oligonucleotides used were: antisense, 5′-CCCACTTCCATGACCATGG-3′; sense, 5′-CCATGGTCATGGAAGTGGG-3′; and random, 5′-GCAGTGCCTGTTGTTGGATTG-3′. Protein samples (30–50 μg) were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels and electroblotted onto Hybond ECL nitrocellulose membranes using a semidry transfer apparatus (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline, 5% nonfat dried milk for 60 min, washed, and incubated with primary and secondary antibodies for 2 and 1 h, respectively. Antibodies to human MKP-1 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), was used at a 1:4000 dilution. The membranes were washed extensively with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween after secondary antibody incubation and detected using the ECL Western blotting kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's suggested protocol. HAEC were plated at 2 × 105 cells/cm2 in 48-well tissue culture plates and allowed to grow, forming a monolayer of confluent HAEC in 2 days. Cell culture supernatants (0.5 ml) from various experiments to be tested for monocyte adhesion were added to fresh HAEC monolayers and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The cells were washed, and a suspension of human peripheral blood monocytes (4 × 105/well) was added. After 10 min, loosely adherent monocytes were washed off, and the remaining monolayers were fixed in 0.1% glutaraldehyde. The adherent monocytes were counted in nine standardized high power microscopic fields and represented as mean ± S.D. Lipopolysaccharide was used as a positive control in all experiments. HAEC supernatants collected from various experimental conditions were tested for monocyte chemotactic activity as described previously (25Navab M. Hama S.Y. Cooke C.J. Anantharamaiah G.M. Chaddha M. Jin L. Subbanagounder G. Faull K.F. Reddy S.T. Miller N.E. Fogelman A.M. J. Lipid Res. 2000; 41: 1481-1494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the supernatants were added to a standard Neuroprobe chamber (Neuroprobe, Cabin John, MD). Monocytes (5 × 104/well) were added in the upper wells of the chamber and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The chamber was disassembled, and the nonmigrated monocytes were removed. The membrane was air-dried, fixed with 1% glutaraldehyde, and stained with 0.1% crystal violet dye. The number of migrated monocytes was determined microscopically and expressed as the mean ± S.D. of 12 standardized high power fields counted for quadruplicate wells. In all assays two to three different dilutions of the supernatants were used to determine the monocyte chemotactic activity. HAEC supernatants from antisense and phosphatase inhibitor experiments were concentrated ∼10-fold by centrifugation through Centricon (10 K) filters, desalted by gel filtration, and brought to 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for fractionation by HPLC. HPLC was performed on a C18 column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) equilibrated with acetonitrile/water/ trifluoroacetic acid (5% solvent B). Solvent A consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and solvent B consisted of 0.085% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. Ten minutes after injection, the sample was eluted with a linear gradient (5–100% B) for 80 min and monitored at 215 and 280 nm. A total of 144 fractions (0.5 ml) were collected for each HPLC run. Individual fractions were dried in a SpeedVac (Savant, Farmingdale, NY), resuspended in 250 μl of 0.1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, and assayed for monocyte chemotactic activity. In preliminary studies all 144 fractions were collected and analyzed for chemotactic activity. In subsequent experiments, only fractions (64) containing the expected peak of activity were dried by SpeedVac and tested for chemotactic activity. Peak chemotactic activity was found to elute at ∼50% B, in agreement with Valente et al. (26Valente A.J. Graves D.T. Vialle-Valentin C.E. Delgado R. Schwartz C.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4162-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). MCP-1 protein in HAEC culture supernatants was quantified by standard ELISA procedures. MCP-1 ELISA kit was purchased from BIOSOURCE International Inc. (Camarillo, CA), and the assays were performed according to the manufacturer's suggested protocols. All samples and standards were run in triplicate, and each experimental sample was measured in three different dilutions (1:5, 1:10, and 1:20 (v/v)). The amount of MCP-1 in the samples was determined from the standard curves obtained from the ELISA kits. Neutralizing monoclonal antibody to MCP-1 (Antigenix America Inc., Huntington Station, NY), neutralizing polyclonal antibody to MCP-1 (26Valente A.J. Graves D.T. Vialle-Valentin C.E. Delgado R. Schwartz C.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4162-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), preimmune rabbit serum (26Valente A.J. Graves D.T. Vialle-Valentin C.E. Delgado R. Schwartz C.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4162-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), or monoclonal antibody to apoJ (Quidel, San Diego, CA) were added to HAEC supernatants at 0.5 μg/ml and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. The samples were centrifuged for 1 min at 8000 × g and assayed for chemotactic activity. Pre-immune rabbit serum (26Valente A.J. Graves D.T. Vialle-Valentin C.E. Delgado R. Schwartz C.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4162-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and monoclonal antibody to apoJ were used as control antibodies for the MCP-1-neutralizing polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, respectively. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). Statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance. The analyses were first carried out in the “Excel” application program, followed by a paired Student'st test to identify significantly different means. Significance is defined as p < 0.05. To identify genes that are induced by ox-PAPC in HAEC, mRNA pooled from HAEC treated with 50 μg/ml of ox-PAPC for 1, 2, and 4 h was subtracted from mRNA pooled from HAEC treated with 50 μg/ml PAPC for 1, 2, and 4 h using the suppression subtractive hybridization technique (27Diatchenko L. Lau Y.F. Campbell A.P. Chenchik A. Moqadam F. Huang B. Lukyanov S. Lukyanov K. Gurskaya N. Sverdlov E.D. Siebert P.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6025-6030Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar). We identified several genes in HAEC that are induced by ox-PAPC,2 including MKP-1 and IL-8, which are highly induced by 4 h (Fig. 1 A). Control and PAPC treatment for 4 h does not show any expression of MKP-1 (Fig. 1 A). MKP-1 induction by ox-PAPC is seen as early as 15 min after induction, reaches a peak at 4 h (Fig.1 B), and then returns to control levels by 12 h (data not shown). MKP-1 induction measured at the 4-h time point is dose-dependent (Fig. 1 C), and MKP-1 expression is also detected at ox-PAPC concentrations of 10 and 25 μg/ml at longer exposures (data not shown). Moreover, among the three biologically active components of ox-PAPC, only POVPC and PEIPC induce MKP-1 expression in HAEC (Fig. 1 D). To determine whether MKP-1 plays a role in ox-PAPC-induced endothelial-monocyte interactions, we first examined the effect of sodium orthovanadate on the accumulation of monocyte chemotactic activity in ox-PAPC-treated HAEC culture supernatants. Sodium orthovanadate is a specific inhibitor of tyrosine phosphatases, including MKP-1 (28Gordon J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 29Charles C.H. Sun H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5292-5296Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 30Lin W. Hsu Y. Cell. Signalling. 2000; 12: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). HAEC were treated with either ox-PAPC alone or in the presence of sodium orthovanadate (10 μm) for 4 h. The supernatants were tested for monocyte chemotactic activity. Sodium orthovanadate prevents ox-PAPC-induced production of monocyte chemotactic activity by HAEC (Fig. 2). Supernatants from HAEC treated with sodium orthovanadate alone contain monocyte chemotactic activity similar to control HAEC supernatants (data not shown). We next examined the effect of selective inhibition of MKP-1 on the production of monocyte adhesion activity and monocyte chemotactic activity by ox-PAPC-treated HAEC. Antisense oligonucleotides targeted to different regions of rat MKP-1 cDNA have been previously used to successfully block the expression of rat MKP-1 protein in vascular smooth muscle cells (31Duff J.L. Monia B.P. Berk B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7161-7166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Two of the antisense oligonucleotides targeted to the translational start site and a 3′-untranslated region resulted in the best inhibition of rat MKP-1 expression. We designed antisense oligonucleotides targeted to the same two regions on the human MKP-1 cDNA sequence for our experiments. HAEC were pretreated with either sense or antisense oligonucleotides to MKP-1 and then incubated with or without ox-PAPC for 4 h. Untreated HAEC do not express MKP-1 message and protein; however, MKP-1 message and protein are induced after stimulation with ox-PAPC (Figs.1 A and 3 A). Pretreatment of HAEC with antisense oligonucleotides to MKP-1 inhibits the expression of MKP-1 protein in ox-PAPC-treated HAEC (Fig.3 A). Sense oligonucleotides do not effect MKP-1 protein expression in ox-PAPC-treated HAEC (Fig.3 A). In the absence of ox-PAPC, supernatants from control HAEC, HAEC pretreated with sense oligonucleotides MKP-1, and HAEC pretreated with antisense oligonucleotides to MKP-1 contain similar levels of monocyte adhesion activity (Fig. 3 B, upper panel) and monocyte chemotactic activity (Fig. 3 B,lower panel). The addition of ox-PAPC induces both monocyte adhesion activity (Fig. 3 B, upper panel) and monocyte chemotactic activity (Fig. 3 B, lower panel) in supernatants from control HAEC as well as in supernatants from HAEC pretreated with sense oligonucleotides to MKP-1. However, ox-PAPC does not induce monocyte adhesion activity (Fig.3 B, upper panel) or monocyte chemotactic activity (Fig. 3 B, lower panel) in HAEC pretreated with antisense oligonucleotides to MKP-1. We next examined ox-PAPC-induced synthesis of MCP-1 in HAEC in the presence of sodium orthovanadate or after pretreatment with antisense oligonucleotides to MKP-1. ox-PAPC induces the production of MCP-1 protein in HAEC. Sodium orthovanadate inhibits ox-PAPC-induced MCP-1 protein synthesis (Fig.4, upper panel). Furthermore, HAEC pretreated with antisense oligonucleotides to MKP-1 do not show an induction of MCP-1 protein after ox-PAPC treatment (Fig. 4, lower panel). Our data suggest that sodium orthovanadate and antisense oligonucleotides to MKP-1 inhibit monocyte chemotactic activity in ox-PAPC-treated HAEC by inhibiting the production of MCP-1 protein. We previously reported that antibodies to baboon aortic smooth muscle cell chemotactic factor block MM-LDL-induced production of monocyte chemotactic activity by artery wall co-cultures (17Navab M. Imes S.S. Hama S.Y. Hough G.P. Ross L.A. Bork R.W. Valente A.J. Berliner J.A. Drinkwater D.C. Laks H. Fogelman A.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 88: 2039-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Smooth muscle cell chemotactic factor was later shown to contain monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (26Valente A.J. Graves D.T. Vialle-Valentin C.E. Delgado R. Schwartz C.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4162-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). To determine whether MCP-1 is the major component of ox-PAPC-induced monocyte chemotactic activity in HAEC supernatants, we tested both the polyclonal antibodies to smooth muscle cell chemotactic factor as well as a commercially available neutralizing monoclonal antibody to MCP-1 for its ability to inhibit monocyte chemotactic activity in supernatants from ox-PAPC-treated HAEC. Preimmune rabbit serum (26Valente A.J. Graves D.T. Vialle-Valentin C.E. Delgado R. Schwartz C.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4162-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and monoclonal antibody to apoJ were used as control antibodies for the polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, respectively, and they did not change monocyte chemotactic activity in the supernatants tested (data not shown). Both the polyclonal antibody to smooth muscle cell chemotactic factor and the neutralizing monoclonal antibody to MCP-1 completely block monocyte chemotactic activity of recombinant human MCP-1 (1 ng/ml) (Fig.5). Monocyte chemotactic activity from ox-PAPC-treated HAEC supernatants is inhibited by more than 70% when incubated with the polyclonal antibody and more than 60% when incubated with the neutralizing monoclonal antibody to MCP-1 (Fig.5). We next examined whether monocyte chemoattractants other than MCP-1 present in the oxidized lipid-treated supernatants contribute to monocyte chemotactic activity. Supernatants from phosphatase inhibitor studies (Fig. 2) and antisense oligonucleotide experiments (Fig.3 B, lower panel) were subjected to HPLC fractionation. A total of 144 fractions were collected, and individual fractions were analyzed for monocyte chemotactic activity. Supernatants from ox-PAPC-treated HAEC give a single peak for monocyte chemotactic activity between fractions 64 and 70 (data not shown) corresponding to the elution profile for MCP-1 protein under conditions documented by Valente et al. (26Valente A.J. Graves D.T. Vialle-Valentin C.E. Delgado R. Schwartz C.J. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 4162-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that (i) MCP-1 is the main chemoattractant factor responsible for the monocyte chemotactic activity present in ox-PAPC-treated HAEC supernatants, and (ii) MKP-1 is required for the production of active MCP-1 protein by ox-PAPC-treated HAEC. The migration of circulating monocytes into the vessel wall is an important step in the pathology of atherosclerosis. There is considerable evidence that oxidized lipids present in MM-LDL play an important role in the recruitment of monocytes in the aortic environment (1Navab M. Berliner J.A. Watson A.D. Hama S.Y. Territo M.C. Lusis A.J. Shih D.M. Van Lenten B.J. Frank J.S. Demer L.L. Edwards P.A. Fogelman A.M. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). Ox-PAPC and its biologically active components, POVPC, PGPC, and PEIPC, play a major role in MM-LDL-mediated activation of endothelial cells as well as MM-LDL-mediated promotion of endothelial/monocyte interactions. However, the molecular mechanisms by which MM-LDL and ox-PAPC bring about these important changes are not well understood. We recently performed a subtraction cloning procedure and identified several genes whose expression is induced by ox-PAPC in HAEC.2 Interestingly, the types of genes induced by ox-PAPC include signaling molecules, transcription factors, extracellular matrix protein, chemokines, and several unknown genes. MKP-1 is one of the genes we isolated from our screen whose expression is rapidly (within 15 min after ox-PAPC addition) and transiently induced. In an attempt to characterize the functional relevance of MKP-1 in ox-PAPC-mediated functional changes in endothelial cells, we studied the effect of both a chemical inhibitor of MKP-1 activity (sodium orthovanadate) as well as antisense oligonucleotides targeted to MKP-1 on the induction of monocyte chemotactic activity by ox-PAPC-treated HAEC. Our data suggest that MKP-1 plays a significant role in the early signaling events mediated by ox-PAPC. Moreover, these studies also provide evidence for the first time that a nuclear non-receptor type dual-specificity phosphatase plays a role in the production of MCP-1. MKP-1 is the archetypal member of the dual-specificity protein phosphatase family. MKP-1 expression is rapidly induced by growth factors in quiescent fibroblasts (32Lau L.F. Nathans D. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3145-3151Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar), cellular stress (28Gordon J.A.

Kijima M. Hattori A. Kodama T. Nagayama K.I. Honda T. Infect. Immun. 2000; 68: 2791-2796Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). MKP-1 thus appears to play a central role in a number of signal transduction pathways. Furthermore, the induction of MKP-1 has been shown to be dependent on the protein kinase C pathway (33Valledor A.F. Xaus J. Marques L. Celada A. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2452-2462PubMed Google Scholar, 35Metzler B. Li C. Hu Y. Sturm G. Ghaffari-Tabrizi N. Xu Q. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1999; 19: 1862-1871Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The family of dual-specificity protein phosphatases can be further classified into two sub-groups (40Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). MKP-1 belongs to the sub-group of dual-specificity phosphatases, which are inducible nuclear dual-specificity phosphatases encoded by immediate early genes (40Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). The second sub-group is characterized by their constitutive and cytoplasmic expression (40Keyse S.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). Since a number of kinases involved in the MAPK and stress-activated protein kinase pathways are regulated by phosphorylation of serine/threonine and tyrosine residues, MKP family members are considered to play a regulatory role in the MAPK and stress-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. Although there is evidence both in vitro and in vivo that members of the sub-group of MKP proteins that are not inducible and are cytoplasmic regulate MAPKs and stress-activated protein kinases, definitive proof is still lacking in mammalian systems for the MKP-1 sub-group. Blocking MKP-1 activity with sodium orthovanadate or blocking MKP-1 synthesis using antisense oligonucleotides inhibits the production of monocyte chemotactic activity (Figs. 2 and 3) and MCP-1 (Fig. 4) by ox-PAPC-treated HAEC. Sodium orthovanadate can also block the activity of other tyrosine phosphatases, and therefore its effect on the monocyte chemotactic activity and MCP-1 protein synthesis may be mediated by more than one phosphatase. However, the level of inhibition of monocyte chemotactic activity and MCP-1 protein in the antisense oligonucleotide experiments is similar to that we obtained using sodium orthovanadate, suggesting that MKP-1 may be the main phosphatase involved in ox-PAPC-induced MCP-1 production. We noted an interesting difference in MKP-1 induction by the individual biologically active components of ox-PAPC. Although all three oxidized phospholipids, POVPC, PGPC, and PEIPC, are capable of inducing monocytes to bind to endothelial cells (9Leitinger N. Tyner T.R. Oslund L. Rizza C. Subbanagounder G. Lee H.

A. 1999; 96: 12010-12015Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), only POVPC and PEIPC induce MKP-1 expression, and PGPC has no effect (Fig.1 D). On the other hand, unlike POVPC and PEIPC, PGPC induces neutrophils to bind to endothelial cells (9Leitinger N. Tyner T.R. Oslund L. Rizza C. Subbanagounder G. Lee H. Shih P.T. Mackman N. Tigyi G. Territo M.C. Berliner J.A. Vora D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12010-12015Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). POVPC inhibits lipopolysaccharide-mediated induction of neutrophil binding and expression of E-selectin protein and mRNA in a protein kinase A-dependent manner, resulting in down-regulation of NF-κB-dependent transcription (9Leitinger N. Tyner T.R. Oslund L. Rizza C. Subbanagounder G. Lee H. Shih P.T. Mackman N. Tigyi G. Territo M.C. Berliner J.A. Vora D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12010-12015Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). PGPC, on the other hand, induces the expression of both E-selectin and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in endothelial cells (9Leitinger N. Tyner T.R. Oslund L. Rizza C. Subbanagounder G. Lee H. Shih P.T. Mackman N. Tigyi G. Territo M.C. Berliner J.A. Vora D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12010-12015Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The authors of these studies conclude that POVPC and PGPC might act through different receptors (9Leitinger N. Tyner T.R. Oslund L. Rizza C. Subbanagounder G. Lee H. Shih P.T. Mackman N. Tigyi G. Territo M.C. Berliner J.A. Vora D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12010-12015Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Therefore, the signaling mechanisms and resulting activation of chemotactic factors may be different between POVPC and PGPC. MCP-1 and IL-8 play important roles in a number of cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis (41Sasayama S. Okada M. Matsumori A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2000; 45: 267-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). MCP-1 is induced in a number of cell types including endothelial cells (42Cushing S.D. Berliner J.A. Valente A.J. Territo M.C.

Among the three distinct MAPK pathways (extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, and p38 kinase), the p38 kinase pathway has been shown to be critical for tumor necrosis factor α-induced expression of MCP-1 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (46Goebeler M. Kilian K. Gillitzer R. Kunz M. Yoshimura T. Brocker E.B. Rapp U.R. Ludwig S. Blood. 1999; 93: 857-865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and IL-1-induced expression of MCP-1 in human mesangial cells (44Rovin B.H. Wilmer W.A. Danne M. Dickerson J.A. Dixon C.L. Lu L. Cytokine. 1999; 11: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). More interestingly, recent findings suggest that direct binding of MKP-1 to p38 promotes the catalytic activation of MKP-1 both in vitro and in vivo (19Hutter D. Chen P. Barnes J. Liu Y. Biochem. J. 2000; 352: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Since MKP-1 is necessary for MCP-1 protein synthesis in ox-PAPC-treated HAEC (Fig. 4 B), we are currently studying the effect of p38 kinase inhibitors on MKP-1 activation and MCP-1 production in ox-PAPC-treated HAEC. We are also investigating the role of MKP-1 in the production of IL-8 by ox-PAPC-treated HAEC. The signal transduction mechanisms utilized by MM-LDL and ox-PAPC are not known and are currently under investigation in our laboratory. Future studies directed at the role of MKP-1 in the p38 kinase pathway might determine the mechanisms by which ox-PAPC induces MCP-1 synthesis. Moreover, endothelial and other cell types derived from the viable and fertile MKP-1 knockout mouse (22Dorfman K. Carrasco D. Gruda M. Ryan C. Lira S.A. Bravo R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 925-931PubMed Google Scholar) would also be valuable tools to further our understanding of the signal transduction pathways involved in oxidized lipid-induced signaling. In summary, our data suggest that MKP-1 is necessary for ox-PAPC-induced induction of monocyte chemotactic activity by HAEC. The majority of the monocyte chemotactic activity in ox-PAPC-treated HAEC is mediated by MCP-1, and MKP-1 is required for the synthesis of MCP-1 protein. Understanding the signaling and molecular mechanisms underlying this paradigm and identification of selective MKP-1 inhibitors will result in major therapeutic targets for a number of inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis."
https://openalex.org/W1615954049,"Transient state kinetic studies indicate that substrate phosphorylation in protein kinase A is partially rate-limited by conformational changes, some of which may be associated with nucleotide binding (Shaffer, J., and Adams, J. A. (1999)Biochemistry 38, 12072–12079). To assess whether specific structural changes are associated with the binding of nucleotides, hydrogen-deuterium exchange experiments were performed on the enzyme in the absence and presence of ADP. Four regions of the protein are protected from exchange in the presence of ADP. Two regions encompass the catalytic and glycine-rich loops and are integral parts of the active site. Conversely, protection of probes in the C terminus is consistent with nucleotide-induced domain closure. One protected probe encompasses a portion of helix C, a secondary structural element that does not make any direct contacts with the nucleotide but has been reported to undergo segmental motion upon the activation of some protein kinases. The combined data suggest that binding of the nucleotide has distal structural effects that may include stabilizing the closed state of the enzyme and altering the position of a critical helix outside the active site. The latter represents the first evidence that the nucleotide alone can induce changes in helix C in solution.

The latter represents the first evidence that the nucleotide alone can induce changes in helix C in solution. Protein kinases are the essential enzymes that direct protein phosphorylation in the cell. The results of this posttranslational modification on protein structure and function can have extraordinary effects ranging from changes in carbohydrate and neurotransmitter metabolism to organelle trafficking and cell division. Given the general role that protein phosphorylation plays in these and many other signal transduction pathways, understanding how these enzymes process substrates has become key to understanding cell function. The insights derived from biophysical studies will support the intense consideration that this enzyme family is now being given as chemotherapeutic targets (1Cohen P. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). As essential components for normal cell function, protein kinases are tightly regulated through a broad host of processes including phosphorylation (2Johnson L.N. Lowe E.D. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), second messengers such as cAMP and Ca2+, fatty acylation, protein-protein and domain-domain interactions, and localization through scaffolding and adaptor proteins (3Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar, 4Newlon M.G. Roy M. Morikis D. Hausken Z.E. Coghlan V. Scott J.D. Jennings P.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 222-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). These processes ensure that the correct protein kinase is activated or repressed at the appropriate time and at the correct location in the cell. Indeed, mutations in protein kinases that alter their regulation are frequently linked to disease (5Chan A.C. Kadlecek T.A. Elder M.E. Filipovich A.H. Kuo W.L. Iwashima M. Parslow T.G. Weiss A.

Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 265-271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Protein kinases possess a well conserved core composed of a small ATP binding domain and a larger substrate binding domain as exemplified in Fig. 1 for the catalytic subunit (C-subunit)1 of protein kinase A (PKA) (11Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (814) Google Scholar, 12Knighton D.R. Zheng J.H. Ten Eyck L.F. Ashford V.A. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Science. 1991; 253: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar). The active site lies between these two domains with ATP embedded deep within the pocket and the substrate fixed toward the periphery. Protein kinases are conformationally dynamic, and several movements within the core kinase structure have been observed. For example, PKA has been crystallized in both open and closed (Fig.1) forms that differ primarily by domain rotation (13Zheng J. Knighton D.R. Xuong N.H. Taylor S.S. Sowadski J.M. Ten Eyck L.F. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1559-1573Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Small angle x-ray scattering methods suggest these conformational dynamics may also occur in solution (14Olah G.A. Mitchell R.D. Sosnick T.R. Walsh D.A. Trewhella J. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3649-3657Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation of the activation loop segment in Cdk2 and the kinase domain of insulin receptor kinase lowers B factors and causes an ordering of this region (15De Bondt H.L. Rosenblatt J. Jancarik J. Jones H.D. Morgan D.O. Kim S.H. Nature. 1993; 363: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 16Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J.

Biol. 1996; 3: 696-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). While it is unlikely that the activation loop serves the universal function of an autoinhibitor (18Adams J.A. McGlone M.L. Gibson R. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2447-2454Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar,19Saylor P. Hanna E. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17875-17881Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), loop motion has been linked to other interesting changes in structure that may have a general role in regulation. For protein kinase structures that have been solved in both phosphorylated (active) and dephosphorylated (inactive) states, the ordering of the activation loop upon phosphorylation results in a notable shift in helix C (16Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massague J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar,20Canagarajah B.J. Khokhlatchev A. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J.

This is thought to be a key element in kinase activation, since this movement places a conserved glutamate in this helix (Glu91 in PKA) within hydrogen bonding distance of a conserved lysine (Lys72 in PKA) residue in the active site. This lysine chelates either the β or the α/β phosphates of ATP and upon mutation results in a low activity mutant (22Carrera A.C. Alexandrov K. Roberts T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 442-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 23Gibbs C.S. Zoller M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8923-8931Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Robinson M.J. Harkins P.C. Zhang J. Baer R. Haycock J.W. Cobb M.H. Goldsmith E.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 5641-5646Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Based upon these findings, it is thought that protein kinase regulation through activation loop phosphorylation is linked to the formation of this essential glutamate-lysine dyad. Detailed kinetic studies of the paradigm protein kinase, PKA, reveal that conformational changes not only are part of normal catalysis but also may be slow relative to turnover and provide a means of regulating enzyme function. Two conformational changes (one before and one after the phosphoryl transfer step) partially controlkcat in wild-type PKA under physiological concentrations of magnesium (25Shaffer J. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12072-12079Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Shaffer J. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5572-5581Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). At least one of these steps appears to be linked to nucleotide binding. Stopped-flow experiments performed on a fluorescently labeled mutant of PKA demonstrate that turnover is partially limited by a conformational change occurring after the phosphoryl transfer step (27Lew J. Taylor S.S. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6717-6724Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). That some of these structural changes are linked to nucleotide binding is further supported by stopped-flow binding studies using fluorescently labeled mant derivatives of ATP and ADP (28Ni Q. Shaffer J. Adams J.A. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1818-1827Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The binding of mant-ADP is accompanied by slow conformational changes that are close in value to the turnover rate. In this paper, we now describe structural methods for attaining a molecular description of these conformational changes. By applying hydrogen-deuterium (H-D) exchange techniques coupled with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric detection (29Mandell J.G. Falick A.M. Komives E.A. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 3987-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), we have shown that four distinct polypeptide regions in PKA alter their protection from amide proton exchange upon ADP binding. Two of these regions are located in the active site, while two are distal to the nucleotide pocket. The latter regions contain part of the C-terminal tail and helix C, the secondary structural element containing one essential member of the glutamate-lysine dyad, namely Glu91. The data suggest that when nucleotides bind to PKA, helix C changes conformation, perhaps causing formation or strengthening of the dyad, and the closed form of the enzyme is stabilized. PD10 columns for buffer exchange were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Dipotassium-ADP was obtained from ICN Biomedicals Inc. D2O (99.9% deuterium) was obtained from ISOTEC Inc. Pepsin immobilized on 6% beaded agarose was obtained from Pierce. Trifluoroacetic acid and acetonitrile were obtained from Fisher and were of peptide synthesis grade and optima grade, respectively. α-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid was obtained from Aldrich and recrystallized once from ethanol. ATP, Mops, lactate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase, reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH), and phosphoenolpyruvate were purchased from Sigma. The substrate peptide, LRRASLG (Kemptide), was synthesized at the USC Microchemical Core Facility using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry and purified by C-18 reverse phase HPLC. The C-subunit of murine PKA was expressed in E. coli and purified as previously described (30Herberg F.W. Bell S.M. Taylor S.S. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Isozyme I, the first isoform eluting from the cation exchange column, was used for all experiments. The buffer was changed to 100 mm KPi, pH 7.0, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol on a PD10 column, and the protein was concentrated to 192 μm. The protein was stored at 4 °C and used in the experiments without lyophilizing. The activity of the C-subunit was measured using a spectrophotometric coupled enzyme assay (31Cook P.F. Neville Jr., M.E. Vrana K.E. Hartl F.T. Roskoski Jr., R. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5794-5799Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). The C-subunit was preequilibrated with 1 mm ATP and 11 mm MgCl2 in 100 mm Mops (pH 7), and the reaction was initiated with 0.5 mm Kemptide. All exchange mixtures for the C-subunit contained the following: 16 μm C-subunit, 40 mm KPi, 50 mm KCl, and 10 mm MgCl2. Final pH* was 6.9, and final percentage of D2O was 87.5%. Exchange experiments performed in the presence of nucleotide included 1 mm ADP and 11 mm MgCl2. The C-subunit was preequilibrated with ADP in H2O before starting the deuterium exchange by diluting into D2O. The D2O mixtures were prepared as follows (numbers are per 12-μl aliquot). The amounts of 100 mm KPi and 4 m KCl needed were mixed, dried in a Speedvac, dissolved in D2O, and mixed with D2O solutions of ADP and MgCl2. The final volume was 10.5 μl, and it contained 36 mm KPi, 57 mm KCl, and either 10 mm MgCl2 or 1 mm ADP and 11 mm MgCl2. The H2O mixtures (1.5 μl per 12-μl aliquot) contained 128 μm C-subunit, 67 mm KPi, and either 10 mmMgCl2 or 1 mm ADP and 11 mmMgCl2. The deuterium exchange was initiated by combining the H2O and D2O solutions. The solutions were incubated at 20 °C. At various times a 12-μl aliquot was added to an ice-cold tube containing 36 μl of 0.19% trifluoroacetic acid and 25 μl of pepsin bead slurry (previously washed two times in 1 ml of cold 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid). This brought the pH* of the C-subunit solution down to 2.5 and quenched the deuterium exchange. The mixture was incubated on ice with occasional mixing for 5 min to facilitate pepsin proteolysis of the C-subunit. The mixture was then centrifuged for 20 s at 12,000 × g at 4 °C to remove the pepsin beads, and the solution was divided in aliquots and frozen in liquid N2. The samples were stored at −80 °C until MALDI-TOF MS analysis. The mixtures for deuterium exchanging C-subunit at pH* 5.9 were prepared similarly to the pH* 6.9 samples. A predetermined amount of phosphoric acid that would bring the solution to pH* 5.9 was added together with KCl and KPi before drying in the Speedvac. The concentration of trifluoroacetic acid used to quench the reaction was adjusted accordingly to reach pH* 2.5. In-exchange of deuterium under quench conditions was measured by adding the protein solution directly to a mix of the D2O solution, quench solution, and pepsin and performing the remaining procedure as normal. This sample corresponds to time point 0. The back-exchange occurring during the procedure was measured essentially as in Ref. 32Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar by using a previously pepsin-digested protein sample, drying it completely, redissolving it in labeling buffer, and incubating at 20 °C for 1 h to achieve complete exchange of backbone amide protons for deuterium. To assess the amount of label lost during sample workup (back-exchange) the deuterated samples were treated to quench and MALDI-TOF MS analysis as described above. This control measures, for each peptide, the maximal experimental mass that corresponds to a fully exchanged peptide. MALDI-TOF MS was performed essentially as described previously (29Mandell J.G. Falick A.M. Komives E.A. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 3987-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), under which conditions the H-D exchange is kept at a minimal rate. Samples were kept on finely crushed dry ice, and target plates were kept at 4 °C. The matrix solution consisted of 5 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 1:1:1 acetonitrile, ethanol, 0.52% trifluoroacetic acid (final pH 2.0). The samples were thawed quickly, and 5 μl were mixed with a 5-μl aliquot of 4 °C matrix solution. One μl was spotted on the target plate at 4 °C and dried in 1.5 min under moderate vacuum. Mass spectra were acquired on a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager DE STR MALDI-TOF. Data were acquired at a 2-GHz sampling rate, 100,000 data channels, with a 20,000-V accelerating voltage, 78% grid voltage, and 0.012% guide wire voltage and using delayed extraction with a 100-ns pulse delay. 256 scans were averaged in ∼3 min. The mass spectra were calibrated in the software GRAMS using the 1194.6485 and 1793.9704 mass peptides. The spectra were then base line-corrected, and centroids of each peak were determined using in-house software (29Mandell J.G. Falick A.M. Komives E.A. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 3987-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The number of deuteriums in-exchanged at time t was calculated as in Ref. 33Zhang Z. Smith D.L. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 522-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar using Equation1, D(t)=m(t)−m(0)m(100)−m(0)×NEquation 1 where m(t) is the observed centroid mass of a peptide at time point t, m(0) is the observed mass at time point 0 (in-exchange control), m(100) is the observed mass of a fully exchanged digest (with consideration to back-exchange; see above), and N is the total number of peptide amide protons in the peptide. The data presented here originate from a single incubation experiment. Similar results have been obtained in four previous experiments. H-D exchange reactions are exquisitely sensitive to changes in structure and dynamics that accompany protein folding, ligand binding, or formation of protein-protein interactions. H-D exchange in small proteins can be monitored at the residue-specific level by combining H-D exchange with NMR detection. In the case of PKA, a 40-kDa protein, we utilize a medium resolution method that gives region-specific information by combining H-D exchange, pepsin fragmentation, and MALDI-TOF MS detection. A schematic for this technique is displayed in Fig. 2. The C-subunit, preequilibrated with or without the nucleotide, is incubated in D2O up to 3 h. After designated time periods, the exchange is quenched at pH* 2.5, and the protein is digested with pepsin. During the exchange reaction, the nucleotide concentration is ∼100-fold higher than the Ki for ADP (25Shaffer J. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 12072-12079Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), assuring more than 99% binding at all times. In addition, the observed association rate for ADP is estimated to be 2000 s− 1 (34Adams J.A. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8516-8522Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), whereas the average intrinsic H-D exchange rate is slower (3.4 and 0.34 s− 1 at 20 °C and pH* 6.9 and 5.9, respectively (35Bai Y. Milne J.S. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1993; 17: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar)), ensuring that H-D exchange does not outcompete the ligand binding reaction. The peptides appearing in the mass spectrum after pepsin fragmentation (Fig. 3) have been assigned to the amino acid sequence of the C-subunit. They cover ∼65% of the primary structure (29Mandell J.G. Falick A.M. Komives E.A. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 3987-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Due to the nature of our exchange protocol, we monitored a subset of these peptides (TableI). The incorporation of deuterium necessarily broadens the peaks (Fig. 3, lower panel) with resulting lower signal-to-noise ratio.

Open table in a new tab The average mass of each peptide was determined by integrating over the full envelope of peaks (29Mandell J.G. Falick A.M. Komives E.A. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 3987-3995Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and the mass was converted into number of in-exchanged deuteriums using Equation 1. The in- and back-exchange controls set the zero and infinite time points for D(t). The in-exchange controls ranged from 13–20% (16% average), whereas the back-exchange controls ranged from 73 to 91% (83% average) for the specific peptides. Since each peptide fragment can contain a number of ligand-sensitive exchangeable protons, with different intrinsic exchange rates, a visual inspection of the curves was used to evaluate the data. The C-subunit is not stable for more than a day under our experimental conditions, which excludes measurement of the slowest exchanging protons that are only exposed with the global unfolding of the protein. For deuterium in-exchange experiments (Fig. 2), an apparent equilibrium is generally observed after 100–200 min (Fig.4), as has also been reported for other systems (32Resing K.A. Ahn N.G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 463-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 33Zhang Z. Smith D.L. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 522-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (902) Google Scholar, 36Wang F. Blanchard J.S.

Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 1660-1668Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, the focus of this study is the specific identification of structural elements that display differences in exchange when the C-subunit has ADP bound. The extent of deuteration of each peptide probe was followed as a function of time at pH* 6.9. Fig. 4 is a presentation of several probes typical of the results obtained. Over the time course of the exchange experiments, the masses of the probes tend to increase in a biphasic manner. The presence of ADP either has no effect or protects amide protons from H-D exchange compared with the apoenzyme, as is evident in the decreased level of label incorporation. The amide protons within probes covering residues 92–100 and 164–174 are clearly protected from H-D exchange over a 3-h period in the presence of ADP (Fig. 4, A and B, and Table I). In comparison, many probes are largely unaffected by nucleotide within experimental error (Fig. 4, C and D, and TableI). At pH* 6.9, a total of three probes covering two regions in the C-subunit displays altered solvent accessibility in the presence of nucleotide. The results for all probes are summarized in Table I. Given the experimental error in the technique, we designate a probe as protected if the mass is 1 or more units lower compared with the free C-subunit after 3 h of exchange. The previously described experiments were performed at pH* 6.9, where the average half-life for exchange of an amide proton is ∼200 ms (35Bai Y. Milne J.S. Mayne L. Englander S.W. Proteins. 1993; 17: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar). We repeated the experiments with the pH* of the H-D exchange reaction lowered by 1 unit, which decreases the intrinsic H-D exchange rate by 10-fold. Thus, more subtle differences in amide exchange protection can be detected over the same time period. Lowering the pH value further is not possible due to instability of the C-subunit at pH* values below 5.5. Fig. 5 displays several exchange studies at pH* 5.9. As shown in Fig. 5 E and summarized in Table I, exchange protection by ADP is observed at pH* 5.9 for all probes that are also protected by the nucleotide at pH* 6.9 (i.e. probes encompassing residues 92–100, 163–172, and 164–174 are protected from exchange by ADP at pH* 5.9 and 6.9). Most, but not all, other regions displayed no difference in H-D exchange in the presence or absence of nucleotide at pH* 5.9 (Fig. 5 F, Table I). However, at the lower pH, additional nucleotide-protected regions are apparent. As shown in Fig. 5, A–D, two new regions of the protein, covered by a total of four probes, are protected from exchange by ADP. These probes include residues 41–54, 44–54, 303–326, and 303–327 (Table I). These additional regions displaying exchange protection with nucleotide at pH* 5.9 are not likely to be due to changes in structure at low pH for several reasons. The steady-state kinetic parameters, Km for ATP andkcat, are identical over a wide pH range, which includes the two pH values of this study (38Yoon M.Y. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4118-4125Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The rate of phosphoryl transfer, measured in pre-steady-state kinetic studies, is constant from pH 6 to 9 (39Zhou J. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2977-2984Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Finally, PKA does not undergo a time-dependent inactivation within the time frame of our experiments. The specific activity of the C-subunit was followed at pH* 5.9 and 6.9 over 3 h, and it was found that the C-subunit did not lose more than 5% of its original activity (data not shown). Probing hydrogen bonding and structural dynamics in proteins with hydrogen exchange was initiated by Linderstrøm-Lang nearly 50 years ago (40Linderstrøm-Lang K. Neuberger A. Symposium on Protein Structure. Methuen, London1958: 23-34Google Scholar).

The conformational flexibility of apoA-I can also play a role in the interaction and lipid exchange of HDL with membranes. It was hypothesized (46Johnson W.J. Mahlberg F.H. Rothblatt G.H. Phillips M.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1085: 273-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar, 47Rothblat G.H. Mahlberg F.H. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1091-1097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that the interaction of HDL discs with membranes may involve helices of apoA-I that can swing away from lipid contact on the disc to insert into the phospholipid bilayer, thus facilitating cholesterol exchange. In spherical HDL, this apoA-I domain would be interacting with the particle lipids and would not be able to interact with membranes (47Rothblat G.H. Mahlberg F.H. Johnson W.J. Phillips M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1091-1097Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to this hypothesis the morphologic change from disc to sphere or the enrichment in cholesteryl ester would reduce the affinity of HDL particles for membranes, allowing the liberation of spherical α-HDLs to the circulation. The major problem of this hypothesis is that the morphologic change from disc to sphere requires LCAT whose activity is very low in lymph and interstitial fluid (48Wong L. Curtiss K. Huang J. Mann C.J. Maldonado B. Roheim P.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2370-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) but high only in plasma (6Fielding C.J. Fielding P.E. J.

Biophys. 2000; 380: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) we suggested, as a possible alternative to this mechanism, that the increase in size or in the cholesterol content in the discs could cause, independently of LCAT activity, a conformational change in apoA-I that decreases the affinity for membranes. Then large cholesterol-rich discs would be liberated into circulation and transformed into α-HDL by LCAT in plasma. This alternative hypothesis is supported by the fact that the increase of size and cholesterol content in the discs modifies apoA-I conformation (45Bergeron J. Frank P.G. Scales D. Meng Q.H.

Biophys. 2000; 380: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) with lipid vesicles. The interaction of discoidal complexes of apoA-I with lipid vesicles produces a transient leakage of the internal aqueous contents, which is faster compared with the leakage produced by lipid-free apoA-I (49Tricerri M.A. Córsico B. Toledo J.D. Garda H.A. Brenner R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1391: 67-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and suggests the penetration of an apoA-I domain into the bilayer of the lipid vesicles. It was also shown that apoA-I discs are able to interact with lipid monolayers by increasing their lateral pressure (70Tricerri M.A. Interacción Lipido Proteína en Lipoproteinas de Alta Densidad , Ph.D. thesis. Facultad de Ciencias Exactas Universidad Nacional de La Plata, Argentina1998Google Scholar). To gain further insight into the mechanism of this interaction, we have used two photoactivable reagents to obtain information on the lipid-bound regions of apoA-I in discoidal complexes and to identify the apoA-I region involved in the interaction of discoidal complexes with membranes. The reagents used were: 3-(trifluoromethyl)-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)diazirine (125I-TID) and 1-O-hexadecanoyl-2-O-(9-[[(2-[125I]iodo-4-(trifluoromethyl-3-H-diazirin-3-yl)benzyl]oxy]carbonyl]nonanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (125I-TID-PC) (Fig. 2). Upon photolysis, the trifluoromethyl diazirine group of these reagents is rapidly converted to carbene, which is capable of reacting with the full range of functional groups occurring in biomolecules, including paraffinic carbon-hydrogen bonds (51Weber T. Brunner J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3084-3095Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In membranes or lipoproteins, the environment of carbene consists largely of acyl chains and protein segments inserted into or in contact with the hydrophobic region of the phospholipid. Membrane inserted domains of several proteins (52Weber T. Paesold G. Galli C. Mischler R. Semenza G. Brunner J. J. Biol.

These photoreagents exhibit very different monomer solubility in water, with one of the factors determining intermembrane exchange/transfer rates and the spontaneous incorporation in preformed membranes or lipoprotein structures (51Weber T. Brunner J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3084-3095Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar,52Weber T. Paesold G. Galli C. Mischler R. Semenza G. Brunner J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18353-18358Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 125I-TID is easily incorporated into the lipid phase of preformed structures such as membranes or lipoproteins with a partition coefficient highly favorable to the lipid phase (39,000 bound ligands × μl external solution/free ligand × mg of lipids) (57Bisson R. Montecucco C. Techniques for the Analysis of Membrane Proteins. Chapman and Hall, London1985: 153-184Google Scholar). It is supposed to be uniformly distributed across the hydrophobic region of the phospholipid bilayer, being a good candidate for the analysis of the apoA-I regions directly in contact with the acyl chains in discoidal complexes. On the other hand, phospholipid vesicles containing the phospholipid analog 125I-TID-PC, which does not undergo significant intermembrane transfer (51Weber T. Brunner J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3084-3095Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and should locate the active diazirine group very deep into the lipid bilayer, were used to identify the apoA-I region able to penetrate into the vesicle bilayer: 125I-TID (10 μCi/nmol) was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. 125I-TID-PC was prepared by radioiodination of its nonradioactive tin-containing precursor 1-O-hexadecanoyl-2-O- (9-[[[2-(tributylstannyl)-4-(trifluoromethyl-3-H-diazirin-3-yl)benzyl]oxy]carbonyl] nonanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phospho-choline according to Weber and Brunner (51Weber T. Brunner J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 3084-3095Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The tin precursor was generously donated by Prof. J. Brunner from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (Zurich, Switzerland). The dried tin-containing precursor (∼20 nmol) was dissolved in 10 μl of acetic acid in a 1-ml Reacti-Vial (Pierce). [125I]NaI (1 mCi) was added, and the iodination was started by the addition of peracetic acid (2 μl of a 32% solution in acetic acid). After 2 min at room temperature, the reaction was quenched with 50 μl of 10% Na2S2O5. Then 40 μl of CHCl3/methanol (2:1) was added and vortexed. The organic phase was collected and concentrated using a charcoal filter to adsorb volatile radioactivity. The residue was dissolved in 20 μl of methanol/CHCl3/H2O (9:1:1) and subjected to reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography using the same solvent and a 208HS54 C8 column (Vydac) in a Merck-Hitachi instrument with UV detection at 254 nm. The flow rate was 1 ml/min, and fractions of 0.5 ml were collected. 125I-TID-PC eluted at ∼20 min, whereas the excess of tin-containing precursor eluted at ∼40 min. An aliquot (5 μl) of each fraction in the elution region of125I-TID-PC was analyzed by TLC on silica gel plates (LK6D, 60 Å; Whatman, Clifton, NJ) and subjected to autoradiography. Fractions containing radioactivity were pooled and concentrated by co-evaporation with toluene/ethanol (1:1). 125I-TID-PC was stored at −20 °C and dissolved in ethanol/toluene (1:1) at ∼1 mCi/ml. 1-Palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL). Cholesterol and sodium cholate were from Sigma.l-α-Dipalmitoyl-[2-palmitoyl-9,10-3H(N)]-phosphatidylcholine ([3H]PC), [4-14C]cholesterol ([14C]FC), and [125I]NaI were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. ApoA-I was purified from the HDL fraction of human serum (kindly donated by the Banco de Sangre del Instituto de Hemoterapia de la Provincia de Buenos Aires, La Plata, Argentina), according to the procedure previously described (58Tricerri M.A. Garda H.A.

[3H]PC and [14C]FC were included to allow PL and FC quantification. Differently sized rHDL were separated by gel filtration fast protein liquid chromatography (49Tricerri M.A. Córsico B. Toledo J.D.

The purity and size of the isolated rHDL were determined by nondenaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (41Ji Y. Jonas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11290-11297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and their composition was obtained by measuring the protein content by Lowry's method (59Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PL and FC contents were measured by scintillation counting. Large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) of POPC or POPC/FC (4/1 mol/mol) were prepared (0.5 mm in POPC) by extrusion through polycarbonate membranes with pore diameters of 100 nm (Avestin Inc., Otawa, Canada). Lipids in CHCl3 were mixed, dried under a stream of N2, and resuspended in 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm N3Na (buffer A) by vortexing. Then lipid suspensions were passed 11 times through the polycarbonate filters by using a Liposofast-extruder system (Avestin). To incorporate125I-TID into the LUV, 10 μCi of the photoactivable reagent in ethanol were added to 0.2 ml of the LUV suspension and incubated with stirring for at least 2 h at room temperature until use. On the other hand, to prepare the LUV containing125I-TID-PC (200 μCi/μmol of POPC), the photoreagent was mixed with the lipids in CHCl3 previous to the LUV preparation. The photoreagent-containing LUV (25 nmol of POPC) were incubated with the rHDL complexes or with lipid-free apoA-I (1 nmol of apoA-I) in buffer A containing 50 mm glutathione at room temperature. After the indicated times, mixtures (0.3 ml) in glass cuvettes were irradiated for 30 s with a Xenon lamp (450 Watts) at a distance of 25 cm. As a control, the photoreagent-containing LUV were also irradiated before mixing with apoA-I. 125I-TID was directly incorporated into the rHDL complexes by adding the reagent (1.5 μCi) in ethanolic solution to the rHDL suspension (1 nmol of apoA-I) in buffer A with 50 mm glutathione and incubating for at least 4 h with stirring before the irradiation. After irradiation, 3 volumes of CHCl3/methanol (2:1) were added and vortexed, and the organic phase was discarded. ApoA-I was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid and redissolved as indicated below for chemical cleavage or in 25 μl of sample buffer for direct analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). For cleavage with NH2OH, samples were dissolved and incubated at 45 °C for 4 h in 50 μl of 2m NH2OH, 2 m urea, 0.2m K2CO3, pH 9.0. For cleavage with CNBr, samples were dissolved in 50 μl of 70% formic acid, and CNBr was added in a 30:1 ratio (CNBr: protein w/w) and incubated at 25 °C under a N2 atmosphere for 24 h. Then the samples were dried in a Speed Vac system and redissolved in 20 μl of sa"

Kinetics of cleavage of this derivative by prothrombinase are identical to those of wild-type prothrombin. Cleavage is coincident with a 50% increase in fluorescence intensity and the product is catalytically inactive. Thus, it allows convenient monitoring of prothrombin activation without generating active thrombin. The kinetics of inhibition of factor Xa (FXa) by antithrombin (AT) and AT-heparin were measured by monitoring activation of II(S525C)-fluorescein and the hydrolysis of the chromogenic substrate S2222 in the presence of AT. With S2222 as the substrate the rate constant for inhibition of FXa, Ca2+, and unilamellar vesicles of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine (75:25) (PCPS) vesicles by AT was 3.51 × 103m−1 s−1; when factor Va (FVa) was included the rate constant was 1.55 × 103m−1 s−1. In the absence of FVa, II(S525C)-fluorescein had no effect on inhibition. When II(S525C)-fluorescein was the substrate, however, FVa at saturating concentrations profoundly protected FXa from inhibition by AT, increasing the half-life from 3 min with FXa, Ca2+, PCPS, and II(S525C)-fluorescein, to greater than 69 min when FVa was included. Thus, both FVa and prothrombin are necessary for this level of protection. In the absence of prothrombin, FVa decreased the second order rate constant for inhibition by the AT-heparin complex from 1.58 × 107m−1s−1, for FXa, Ca2+, and PCPS, to 7.72 × 106m−1 s−1. II(S525C)-fluorescein and factor Va together reduced the rate constant to less than 1% of that for FXa, Ca2+, and PCPS. At a heparin concentration of 0.2 unit/ml, this corresponds to a half-life increase from 1 s to 136 s.

Prothrombinase comprises the serine protease factor Xa, the activated protein cofactor factor Va, calcium ions, and an appropriate cell membrane or phospholipid surface (1Tracy P.B. Eide L.L.

Although factor Xa alone can slowly generate thrombin by an extremely inefficient reaction, the rate of thrombin generation is enhanced by several orders of magnitude by incorporation of the cofactor protein factor Va and the procoagulant surface (5Nesheim M.E. Taswell J.B. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 10952-10962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activities of the clotting serine proteases, such as thrombin, are regulated, in part, by plasma protease inhibitors of the serpin superfamily. Of these, antithrombin appears to be the most important. Antithrombin targets both the product of prothrombin activation, thrombin, and the enzyme responsible for the reaction, factor Xa. Inhibition of serine proteases by serpins occurs through the formation of a stable complex between the serpin and the active site of the serine protease. Inhibition by antithrombin is markedly enhanced by the glycosaminoglycan cofactor, heparin. Heparin accelerates rates of inhibition of both thrombin and factor Xa several thousand fold (6Jordon R. Beeler D. Rosenburg R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 2902-2913Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Upon binding, heparin induces a conformational change in antithrombin (7Olson S.T. Bjork I.

The acceleration of thrombin inhibition, however, is dependent on the formation of a ternary complex between heparin, antithrombin, and thrombin (10Nesheim M.E. J. Biol.

Several studies demonstrated that incorporation of factor Xa into the prothrombinase complex changes the ability of the antithrombin-heparin complex to inhibit it. Calcium ion accelerates the heparin catalyzed inactivation of factor Xa by antithrombin through a template mechanism (13Rezaie A.R. J. Biol.

The substrate prothrombin also plays an important role in the protection observed when factor Xa is incorporated into the prothrombinase complex (14Speijer H. Billy D. Willems G. Hemker H.C. Lindhout T. Thromb. Haemost. 1995; 73: 648-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Prothrombinase activity is usually inferred through measurements of thrombin activity over time. Therefore, studying heparin-dependent antithrombin inhibition of prothrombinase is challenging because the inhibitor recognizes both the product of the reaction, thrombin, and the enzyme component of prothrombinase, factor Xa. To resolve this problem in this study, a mutant form of prothrombin (II(S525C)), in which serine 525 (the active site serine of thrombin) is replaced with cysteine, was expressed in a mammalian expression system, isolated, and covalently labeled at Cys525with fluorescein. II(S525C)-fluorescein exhibits an increase in fluorescence intensity upon activation to thrombin but is catalytically inactive to both small and macromolecular substrates. Thus, it allows convenient monitoring of prothrombin activation in the presence of antithrombin without generating active thrombin. In this study inhibition of free factor Xa or factor Xa bound to vesicles and factor Va, by antithrombin or the antithrombin heparin complex was determined by monitoring over time the hydrolysis of the small factor Xa substrate S2222 or the activation of II(S525C)-fluorescein.

The resulting 393-bp fragment, encompassing nucleotides 1580–1973, was subcloned into pBluescript(SK+). Oligonucleotides 1 and 2 (TableI) were constructed to facilitate mutation of A1714 → T resulting in a serine to cysteine substitution at amino acid Ser525 in the expressed protein product. PCR using Pfu DNA Polymerase with oligonucleotide 1 and the T3 promoter primer (Stratagene) produced a 450-bp product (PCRI), whereas that with oligonucleotides 2 and the T7 promoter primer (Stratagene) produced a 217-bp product (PCRII). Each PCR product was ligated into the EcoRV site of pBluescript(SK+). PCRI and PCRII in pBluescript were digested withBspHI and XbaI, and BspHI andPstI, respectively. The resulting fragments were ligated at their corresponding BspHI sites and subcloned into pBluescript(SK+) digested with PstI and XbaI. The presence of mutations and correct PCR amplifications were verified by DNA sequence analysis using the T3 and T7 promoter primers (Stratagene). The mutated fragment was ligated back into full-length prothrombin cDNA to make II(S525C)-cDNA. For expression in mammalian cells, the II(S525C)-cDNA was excised from pBluescript(SK+) with XbaI, followed by incubation with T4 DNA Polymerase, and ligated into the pNUT vector (27Le Bonniec B.F.

Open table in a new tab BHK cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 nutrient mixture (1:1) supplemented with 5% newborn calf serum during transfection and selection. Transfection of II(S525C)-cDNA was carried out using the calcium phosphate co-precipitation technique (28Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). Sixteen hours after transfection, the medium was supplemented with 0.44 mmmethotrexate to select for pNUT. Fifteen days after transfection, individual colonies were screened for II(S525C) production by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-human prothrombin antibody. High expressing clones were seeded into 500-cm2 triple flasks for large scale production. At confluence, the growth medium was replaced by serum-free Opti-MEM I, supplemented with 50 μm ZnCl2, 10 μg/ml vitamin K1, and penicillin/streptomycin/Fungizone mixture. The medium was collected at 24-h intervals, supplemented with glutathione (1 mm), and stored at −20 °C. Stored medium was thawed at 4 °C and loaded onto XAD-2 (2.5 × 15 cm) and Q-Sepharose (1.4 × 8 cm) columns in tandem at either 4 °C or 21 °C. The Q-Sepharose column was then washed with 5 column volumes of 0.02m Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4 (TBS), followed by elution of II(S525C) with 0.02 m Tris-HCl, 0.5m NaCl. Protein containing fractions were identified using a Bio-Rad Assay and pooled. Fractions were collected until all protein was eluted from the column. Fluorescent labeling was performed directly on this pooled fraction by adding a 30 m excess of 5-IAF from a 20 mm stock solution of 5-IAF inN,N-dimethyl formamide and incubating the sample for 2 h at room temperature in the dark. The resulting II(S525C)-fluorescein was separated from the excess label by addition of sodium citrate to a final concentration of 0.025 m, followed by addition of a 1.0 m BaCl2 solution to a final concentration of 0.08 m. The solution was stirred at 4 °C for 1 h and centrifuged. The resulting pellet was washed with the supernatant from a parallel precipitation carried out in 0.02 m Tris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl. The adsorbed protein was eluted by dissolving the barium citrate pellet in 0.2 m EDTA, pH 8.0 (1/6 of the original volume). The sample was then dialyzed against TBS, at 4 °C, and subjected to anion-exchange chromatography on a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech fast-protein liquid chromatography Mono-Q HR 5/5 column at 4 °C. This step was carried out to resolve fully γ-carboxylated species from partially γ-carboxylated species of II(S525C)-fluorescein (26Côté H.C.F. Stevens W.K. Bajzar L. Banfield D.K. Nesheim M.E.

Bio/Technology. 1990; 8: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The protein was eluted with a 0–30 mmCaCl2 gradient in TBS (30-ml total volume, flow rate 0.5 ml/min). The first peak containing the fully γ-carboxylated II(S525C)-fluorescein eluted at 15.0 mm CaCl2, whereas the second eluted between 18 and 25 mmCaCl2. Fractions from the first peak were pooled, and protein concentrations and labeling efficiency values were determined by absorbance readings at 280 and 495 nm, respectively. II(S525C)-fluorescein (800 nm) was activated with 50 μm PCPS, 5 nm FVa, 0.1 nm FXa, and 5 mm CaCl2 in TBS. Fluorescence intensity was monitored at room temperature with an excitation wavelength of 495 nm and an emission wavelength of 535 nm, slit widths of 5 nm and 10 nm, respectively, and a 515-nm cut-off emission filter in place. Aliquots were removed from the reaction and added to an equal volume of 0.2 m acetic acid. Samples were concentrated and reduced and subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 5–15% minigel, which was subsequently photographed over UV light. II(S525C)-fluorescein or plasma prothrombin (800 nm) was activated in the presence 5 nm FVa with 50 μm PCPS, 0.1 nm FXa, and 5 mmCaCl2 in TBS, 0.01% Tween 80. The same reactions were carried out in the absence of FVa, with 10 nm FXa. Aliquots were removed from the reactions and subjected to SDS-PAGE, under reducing conditions, on 5–15% minigels, which were subsequently stained with Coomassie Blue. Densitometry was carried out to quantify the amount of prothrombin remaining at each time point. Reactions (200 μl) were set up containing 1.0 μm AT with 20 nm FXa alone, 20 nmFXa + 5 mm CaCl2, 20 nm FXa + 5 mm CaCl2 + 50 μm PCPS, 10 nm FXa + 5 mm CaCl2 + 50 μm PCPS + 50 nm FVa, or 20 nm FXa + 5 mm CaCl2 + 50 μm PCPS + 1 μm II(S525C)-fluorescein in TBS, 0.01% Tween 80. Reactions were started by the addition of FXa, and 10-μl aliquots were removed and diluted in a 96-well plate, which had been pretreated with TBS, 1% Tween 80. The wells contained TBS, 0.01% Tween 80, with S2222, and CaCl2 in sufficient amounts to reach final diluted concentrations of 400 μm and 5 mm, respectively. Absorbance at 405 nm was read over time in a Spectromax Plus spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at room temperature. Initial rates were calculated. The natural logarithms of these were then plotted against time and the corresponding slope was calculated to determine the second order rate constants of inhibition. Reactions containing S2222 at various concentrations (0–1000 μm), 2 nmFXa, and 5 mm CaCl2, in TBS, 0.01% Tween 80, were monitored at 405 nm to completion in a 96-well plate. Additional S2222 (250 μm) was then added, and the resulting reactions were monitored at 450 nm. Initial rates were determined and plotted versus [S2222 product], and aKP value for the inhibition of FXa by the product of S2222 hydrolysis was determined according to the following equation, where [P] is the concentration of S2222 product: r=κ[E]T[S]Km+[S]+KmKP×[P](Eq. 1) In Equation 1, r is the rate of hydrolysis of S2222,k is kcat, [E]T is the FXa concentration, [S] is the concentration of S2222 (250 μm),Km is the Michaelis-Menten constant for hydrolysis of S2222, KP is the Michaelis-Menten constant for the S2222 product, and [P] is the concentration of the S2222 product. The Km value for hydrolysis of S2222 was determined by measurements of initial reaction rates in the absence of product. Reactions containing S2222 at various concentrations, 0.1 nm FXa and 5 mm CaCl2 in TBS, 0.01% Tween-80, were monitored at 405 nm at room temperature. Initial rates were determined and plotted versus [S2222] to determine Km. Similar analyses were carried out for 0.1 nm FXa alone, 0.1 nm FXa + 5 mmCaCl2 + 50 μm PCPS, and 0.1 nmFXa + 5 mm CaCl2 + 50 μm PCPS + 20 nm FVa. The Km values were very similar for all conditions. In addition they were very similar to theKp value determined for one condition. Thus for all conditions the KP value was assumed to be identical to the Km value. Reactions containing 400 μm S2222 with 2 nm FXa alone, 2 nm FXa + 5 mmCaCl2, 2 nm FXa + 5 mmCaCl2 + 50 μm PCPS, 2 nm FXa + 5 mm CaCl2 + 50 μm PCPS + 25 nm FVa, or 2 nm FXa + 5 mmCaCl2 + 50 μm PCPS + 1 μmII(S525C)-fluorescein, in the presence and absence of 1.0 μm AT, were set up in a 96-well plate, which had been pretreated with TBS, 1% Tween 80. Reactions were started by addition of FXa and monitored at 405 nm to completion. End point data were analyzed to determine the pseudo first order rate constant. The following rationale was used, taking into account that the product of S2222 hydrolysis as well as AT inhibit the enzyme. In this analysis,E is the enzyme, S is the substrate, Pis the product, I is the inhibitor (AT), and α is the pseudo first order rate constant for inhibition of FXa by AT. α is equal to the second order rate constant (k2) multiplied by the inhibitor concentration.

Therefore, α=k[E]TKm/ln[S]o[S]f(Eq. 10) Consequently, α can be calculated fromk[E]T/Km and ln([S]o/[S]f), and k[E]T/Km can be determined from control experiments with no AT. With the assumption that Km= KP,−d[S]dt=k[E]T[S]Km+[S]o(Eq. 11) Integration of Equation 11 over time gives Equation 12,ln[S]o[S]=k[E]TtKm+[S]o(Eq. 12) Equation 12 is rewritten as Equation 13,ln[S]o[S]=β·t(Eq. 13) where β =k[E]T/(Km + [S]o). Raw data were subjected to nonlinear regression to Eq. 13 to find β. Elimination of k[E]T between Equations 10 and 13, yields Equation 14, from which the value of α was calculated.α=β[1+([S]o/Km)]ln([S]o/[S]f)(Eq. 14) The second order rate constant (k2) was then calculated usingk2=α[I](Eq. 15) End point reactions containing II(S525C)-fluorescein, and FVa at various concentrations (0–2 nm), were carried out in a 96-well plate, which had been pretreated with TBS 1%, Tween 80 and were monitored in a Spectra Max Gemini fluorescence plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 490 nm and 538 nm, respectively, with a 515-nm emission cut-off filter in place. Reactions were started by the addition of FXa. Raw data for control experiments, containing no AT, were fit to the integrated Michaelis-Menten equation: (Km/vmax)·(ln([S]o/[S]))/[P] + 1/vmax = t/[P], to determine Km and vmax values for each condition. Pseudo first order rate constants were then calculated using, α =k[E]T/Km/ln([S]o/[S]f), and the second order rate constants usingk2=α/[I]. To obtain II(S525C), stable BHK cell lines expressing II(S525C) were grown in serum-free medium (Opti-MEM) in triple flasks. Typically 4 liters of pooled conditioned media were used as the starting material for purification as outlined under “Methods.” II(S525C) behaved identically to wild-type recombinant prothrombin in all of the purification steps. II(S525C) was found to be present in conditioned media at a concentration of 5–10 mg/liter. Only 10% of it, however, was fully γ-carboxylated. II(S525C)-fluorescein was produced with a typical labeling efficiency of ∼50%. Purified II(S525C)-fluorescein comigrated with plasma prothrombin when subjected to SDS-PAGE (data not shown). Upon activation of II(S525C)-fluorescein, an increase in fluorescence intensity of ∼50% was observed, which was found to correlate well with cleavage (Fig. 1). The fluorescence intensity profile exhibited a transient maximum in intensity, which is indicative of the expected meizothrombin intermediate (26Côté H.C.F. Stevens W.K. Bajzar L. Banfield D.K.

Chem. 1986; 261: 8977-8984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, upon cleavage, the band that retains the fluorescent properties corresponds to the B-chain of thrombin, which contains the active site serine. This confirms that the fluorescein moiety attaches specifically to Cys525 (Fig.1). When compared with plasma prothrombin, II(S525C)-fluorescein activated at similar rates in both the presence and absence of FVa (Fig. 2). The thrombin generated from activation of II(S525C)-fluorescein was catalytically inactive toward small substrates, as determined by S2238 hydrolysis, in which II(S525C)-fluorescein was observed to have at least 130,000-fold less activity (data not shown). II(S525C)-fluorescein was also catalytically inactive toward macromolecular substrates such as Factor V, fibrinogen, and itself (data not shown).Figure 2Activation of II(S525C)-fluorescein compared with plasma prothrombin in the presence and absence of FVa.A, 800 nm II(S525C)-fluorescein (open circles) or plasma prothrombin (closed circles) were activated with 50 μm PCPS, 5 nm FVa, 0.1 nm FXa, and 5 mm CaCl2 in TBS, 0.01% Tween 80.

Two methods were employed. One involved subsampling at various intervals and measuring residual FXa activity with the substrate. The other involved monitoring the reactions containing the substrate to completion and calculating the value of the inhibition constants from the level of unconsumed substrate at the end of the reaction carried out in the presence of inhibitor. In the first method the time course of decay of enzymatic activity is directly measured; thus the results are unambiguous. In the second, the validity of the inferred value depends on the validity of the model used to interpret the data. The second method was used with this substrate in anticipation of the experiments with II(S525C)-fluorescein, in which the direct method would not be feasible because of the low levels of FXa used. Thus, the two types of measurements with S2222 were done to test the validity of the end point method. The analyses involving subsampling are shown in Fig. 3. Two time courses of the reactions, along with their controls without AT, carried out with the substrate included (end point analysis) are shown in Fig.4. In the subsampling experiments, plots of the natural logarithm of the residual activity versustime were linear and pseudo first order rate constants were measured from the slopes. In the end point analyses, reactions containing AT did not go to completion because the enzyme was consumed, which allowed determination of the pseudo first order rate constant for inhibition from the residual substrate concentration and thevmax/Km ratio for the control. Initial efforts to find thevmax/Km ratio by application of the integrated Michaelis-Menten equation were unsuccessful, because the time courses of product formation were first order, regardless of the initial substrate concentration, which is indicative of equal affinity binding of both the substrate and product to the enzyme. Thus, theKm was found by standard initial rate measurements and the KP for inhibition by product was found by measuring initial rates of substrate hydrolysis in the presence of the product at various concentrations (Fig.5). Km was determined to be the same regardless of the presence or absence of"

However, efficient rescue was not achieved by replacing deleted transmembrane segments with corresponding lengths of other hydrophobic amino acids. Mutations reported to diminish the dimerization of the transmembrane domain of syntaxin did not impair the interaction of full-length syntaxin with other proteins. Finally, we observed that membrane insertion and wild-type interactions with interacting proteins are not correlated.

In addition, insertion of the transmembrane region into membranes is required for cleavage of syntaxin by botulinum neurotoxin C1 (35Blasi J. Chapman E.R. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R.

We provide evidence that the TMD of syntaxin affects the ability of its cytoplasmic domain to engage partner proteins. The TMD fulfills this role in a length- and sequence-specific manner that is not dependent upon TMD-mediated dimerization. Furthermore, mutagenesis experiments demonstrate that membrane insertion and wild-type partner protein binding activity can be completely uncoupled. We propose that the TMD affects target protein interactions by affecting the conformation of the cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin.RESULTSPrevious studies indicated that removal of the transmembrane domain (TMD) of syntaxin impaired synaptotagmin, synaptobrevin, and α/β-SNAP binding activity (25Hanson P.I. Otto H. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16955-16961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 29Chapman E.R. Hanson P.I. An S. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23667-23671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Furthermore, syntaxin must be anchored into lipid bilayers via its C-terminal membrane-spanning domain to be cleaved by botulinum neurotoxin C (35Blasi J. Chapman E.R. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4821-4828Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar, 36Schiavo G. Shone C.C. Bennett M.K. Scheller R.H. Montecucco C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10566-10570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Finally, removal of the syntaxin TMD decreases the stability of fully assembled SNARE complexes (37Poirier M.A. Hao J.C. Malkus P.N. Chan C. Moore M.F. King D.S. Bennett M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11370-11377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Whereas these reports suggested that the TMD of syntaxin is important for protein-protein interactions, it was not clear whether complete removal of the transmembrane segment of syntaxin grossly affected the structure of the protein, or whether the TMD played a more specific or direct role in mediating protein-protein interactions. Therefore, we began to investigate the role of the transmembrane domain in protein-protein interactions by constructing more subtle truncations at the C terminus of the TMD. These constructs, shown in Fig. 1 A, were expressed as GST fusion proteins and used as affinity matrices for the binding of synaptotagmin I, α/β-SNAP, SNAP-25, and synaptobrevin II present in Triton X-100 extracts of rat brain membranes. As shown in Fig. 1 B, truncation of the TMD resulted in the progressive loss of synaptotagmin, α/β-SNAP, and synaptobrevin binding activity. Even removal of the last two amino acids of the TMD slightly, yet reproducibly, reduced synaptotagmin interactions. Truncation to amino acid 281, which would be predicted to lie within the opposite leaflet of the lipid bilayer relative to the cytoplasmic domain, dramatically reduced binding. These data suggest that the distal region of the TMD can affect the interaction of the H3 domain of syntaxin with target proteins. We note that in these experiments, and in experiments described below, similar results were observed using purified recombinant proteins as the “ligands” in the GST pull-down assays (data not shown). Thus, the interactions reported here are direct.In contrast to the diminished binding of synaptotagmin, α/β-SNAP, and synaptobrevin, we observed that SNAP-25 binding was enhanced by removal of the TMD, and this effect became apparent by truncating from amino acid 276 back to residue 271 (Fig. 1 B). These data suggest that truncation of the TMD does not result in gross misfolding, but rather can differentially affect the affinity of different interacting proteins; this effect is consistent with a model in which the TMD truncations can switch syntaxin between different conformations, discussed further below. We also compared the interactions of full-length and the cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin with native (Fig. 1 C) as well as recombinant rbSec1A/nsec-1/munc18 (Fig. 1 D). Analogous to SNAP-25, rbSec1A bound more efficiently to the cytoplasmic domain of syntaxin than to the full-length protein. Thus, removal of the TMD inhibits synaptotagmin, α/β-SNAP, and synaptobrevin binding and enhances SNAP-25 and rbSec1A binding.To determine whether the effects of the syntaxin TMD truncations were length- or position-sensitive, we shortened the TMD by internal deletions at the N-terminal end of the TMD (shown schematically in Fig.2 A). As shown in Fig.2 B, removal of only two amino acid residues at the N-terminal edge of the TMD reduced binding of synaptotagmin and α/β-SNAP. Binding of synaptotagmin was further reduced by progressively larger deletions of four and seven amino acids. Interestingly, synaptobrevin binding was largely unaffected by N-terminal TMD deletions, indicating that these deletions did not result in gross misfolding of syntaxin. Furthermore, SNAP-25 and rbSec1A again showed an increase in binding, and this increase required the removal of seven residues from the N-terminal side of the TMD. For comparison, increased SNAP-25 binding was not observed until more than twelve residues were removed from the C-terminal end of the syntaxin TMD. These data suggest that the role of the TMD in syntaxin binding interactions is complex and involves determinants other than simple length requirements.Figure 2Deletions within the N-terminal end of the syntaxin-transmembrane domain affect syntaxin protein-protein interactions. A, schematic of the deletions made within the N-terminal end of the syntaxin TMD. The structure of syntaxin 1A is as described in the legend to Fig. 1. B, effects of the deletion mutants on syntaxin protein-protein interactions. Deletion mutants were assayed for interacting protein binding activity as described in Fig. 1. Bound proteins were detected by immunoblot analysis and enhanced chemiluminescence. To assay for rbSec1A binding activity, recombinant rbSec1A (0.5 μm) was incubated with 30 μg of the indicated GST-syntaxin fusion protein for 2 h at 4 °C in 150 μl of Tris-saline pH 7.4 plus 1% Triton X-100. Samples were washed, and bound protein was visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue (note: the GST fusion proteins were cropped from the gel). 20% of the bound material was loaded onto the gel;Total corresponds to 1 μg of rbSec1A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We addressed this hypothesis via rescue experiments in which we tried to restore wild-type binding interactions with the 1–281 truncation and Δ265–270 deletion mutants by adding the appropriate number of amino acids onto the C-terminal tail of the TMD. To test whether the TMD must form an α-helix of a certain length, we added either a string of isoleucines, which can form an α-helix, or a string of alternating proline/phenylalanine residues (Pro/Phe), which cannot form an α-helix (shown schematically in Fig.3 A). As shown in Fig.3 B, the 1–281 mutant showed diminished synaptotagmin, α/β-SNAP, and synaptobrevin binding activity. Again, SNAP-25 binding was not impaired, providing a positive control for the folding of the mutants. Interestingly, addition of seven Ile residues to the end of the 281 mutant partially rescued α/β-SNAP and synaptobrevin binding, whereas the Pro/Phe sequence did not rescue binding of these proteins. These data indicate that α/β-SNAP and synaptobrevin binding require a full-length TMD with the ability to form an α-helix. In contrast, neither the Ile nor the Pro/Phe sequences rescued synaptotagmin binding, again indicating that the TMD fulfills different requirements for the binding of different interacting proteins. Similar experiments were conducted using the Δ265–270 deletion mutant. Consistent with the data in Fig. 2, this deletion did not affect synaptobrevin binding, but did affect the binding of all other proteins examined (Fig. 3 C). In this case, the Ile sequence failed to rescue synaptotagmin or α/β-SNAP binding whereas, surprisingly, very low levels of rescue were observed with the non-helix forming Pro/Phe sequence. For these interactions, the ability of added on residues to restore wild-type binding activity depended upon whether the TMD was truncated at the N- or C-terminal end, as well as on the content of the added-on sequence. In contrast, the enhanced binding of SNAP-25 to the deletion mutant was partially abrogated by both added-on sequence stretches. In summary, the data from these rescue experiments suggest that the length, primary sequence, and the position of the primary sequence of the TMD of syntaxin are all key factors in syntaxin-target protein interactions.Figure 3Rescue of syntaxin TMD truncation and deletion mutants by adding hydrophobic amino acids. A,schematic diagram of the syntaxin TMD rescue constructs. The structure of syntaxin 1A is as described in the legend to Fig. 1. For these experiments, the 1–281 truncation mutant and the Δ265–270 deletion mutant were lengthened to the same length as the wild-type protein (288 residues) by adding either seven or six amino acids, respectively. These extensions were comprised of either Ile residues or an alternating Pro/Phe sequence. B, effects of adding hydrophobic residues onto the 1–281 truncation mutant. α/β-SNAP and synaptotagmin interactions were altered in the 1–281 deletion mutant, SNAP-25 binding was unaffected. Addition of seven Ile residues did not rescue synaptotagmin interactions but partially rescued α/β-SNAP and synaptobrevin interactions. Addition of the Pro/Phe sequence did not affect either interaction. C, effects of adding hydrophobic residues onto the Δ265–270 deletion mutant. Experiments were carried out as described above. Deletion of residues 265–270 inhibits synaptotagmin and α/β-SNAP binding, facilitates SNAP-25 binding and does not affect synaptobrevin binding. Addition of six Ile residues or the Pro/Phe sequence did not rescue synaptotagmin or α/β-SNAP binding but did decrease SNAP-25 binding to the level observed with wild-type syntaxin. The Pro/Phe sequence was able to weakly rescue α/β-SNAP binding.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We further examined the sequence requirements of the syntaxin TMD by constructing two chimeric syntaxins that harbored TMDs from synaptobrevin II or synaptotagmin I (Fig.4 A). As shown in Fig.4 B, replacement of the syntaxin TMD with the synaptobrevin TMD resulted in a protein with wild-type, or stronger, synaptotagmin, α/β-SNAP, and synaptobrevin binding activity. In contrast, replacement with the synaptotagmin TMD resulted in only partial rescue of synaptotagmin, α/β-SNAP, and synaptobrevin binding activity. Because the TMDs of synaptobrevin and synaptotagmin are not homologous, these experiments demonstrate some degree of promiscuity in the sequence requirements within the TMD. These observations, coupled to the findings that mutations on the distal side of the membrane anchor (i.e. the N-terminal truncation mutants) can affect protein-protein interactions (Fig. 1 B), prompted us to investigate the possibility that the role of the TMD is to induce oligomerization of the H3 domain of syntaxin to drive normal interactions with other proteins. Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that the transmembrane domain of syntaxin mediates syntaxin homodimerization as well as binding to the TMD of synaptobrevin (18Margittai M. Otto H. Jahn R. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 19Laage R. Rohde J. Brosig B. Langosch D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17481-17487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The same may hold true of the TMD of synaptotagmin, which has been recently shown to contain a novel clustering site within the N-terminal half of the protein (43Bai J. Earles C.A. Lewis J.L. Chapman E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25427-25435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 44von Poser C. Zhang J.Z. Mineo C. Ding W. Ying Y. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G. J.

To determine whether this oligomerization activity lies within the TMD of synaptotagmin, we mapped the N-terminal clustering site. The constructs used for this analysis (shown schematically in Fig.5 A) were immobilized as GST fusion proteins and were assayed for their abilities to bind a His6-tagged fragment of synaptotagmin (residues 1–265). As shown in Fig. 5 B, the soluble synaptotagmin fragment bound to its immobilized counterpart in a Ca2+-independent manner. Removal of the luminal domain did not inhibit binding, however further truncation that removed the TMD strongly reduced binding activity. These data indicate that the TMD of synaptotagmin could directly mediate oligomerization of the protein, but it is also possible that the TMD enables another region of synaptotagmin to homo-oligomerize. We confirmed these results using native synaptotagmin from brain detergent extracts as the ligand (Fig. 5 C). However, in these experiments, Ca2+ facilitated binding, presumably because of Ca2+-triggered oligomerization of the C2B domain of the protein (Refs. 39Chapman E.R. An S. Edwardson J.M. Jahn R. J.

Previously, three cognate LPA GPCRs (LPA1/VZG-1/EDG-2, LPA2/EDG-4, and LPA3/EDG-7) were identified in mammals. By contrast, an unrelated GPCR, PSP24, was reported to be a high affinity LPA receptor in Xenopus laevis oocytes, raising the possibility that Xenopus uses a very different form of LPA signaling. Toward addressing this issue, we report two novel Xenopus genes,xlpA1 -1 andxlpA1 -2, encoding LPA1homologs (∼90% amino acid sequence identity with mammalian LPA1). Both xlpA1 -1 andxlpA1 -2 are expressed in oocytes and the nervous system. Overexpression of either gene in oocytes potentiated LPA-induced oscillatory chloride ion currents through a pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway. Injection of antisense oligonucleotides designed to inhibitxlpA1 -1 andxlpA1 -2 expression in oocytes eliminated their endogenous response to LPA. Furthermore, retrovirus-mediated heterologous expression ofxlpA1 -1 orxlpA1 -2 in B103 rat neuroblastoma cells that are unresponsive to LPA conferred LPA-induced cell rounding and adenylyl cyclase inhibition.

By contrast, an unrelated GPCR, PSP24, was reported to be a high affinity LPA receptor in Xenopus laevis oocytes, raising the possibility that Xenopus uses a very different form of LPA signaling. Toward addressing this issue, we report two novel Xenopus genes,xlpA1 -1 andxlpA1 -2, encoding LPA1homologs (∼90% amino acid sequence identity with mammalian LPA1). Both xlpA1 -1 andxlpA1 -2 are expressed in oocytes and the nervous system. Overexpression of either gene in oocytes potentiated LPA-induced oscillatory chloride ion currents through a pertussis toxin-insensitive pathway. Injection of antisense oligonucleotides designed to inhibitxlpA1 -1 andxlpA1 -2 expression in oocytes eliminated their endogenous response to LPA. Furthermore, retrovirus-mediated heterologous expression ofxlpA1 -1 orxlpA1 -2 in B103 rat neuroblastoma cells that are unresponsive to LPA conferred LPA-induced cell rounding and adenylyl cyclase inhibition. These results indicate that XLPA1-1 and XLPA1-2 are functionalXenopus LPA receptors and demonstrate the evolutionary conservation of LPA signaling over a range of vertebrate phylogenyAJ249843AJ249844. lysophosphatidic acid G protein-coupled receptor polymerase chain reaction guanosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) pertussis toxin green fluorescent protein enhanced GFP transmembrane domain(s) base pair(s) open reading frame kilobase(s) cytidine or thymidine adenosine or thymidine guanosine or cytidine adenosine or guanosine Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA1; 1-acyl-2-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate) is a simple phospholipid that exerts hormone- and growth factor-like effects in many organisms and organ systems. LPA can alter cell fates by inducing proliferation and differentiation or by preventing apoptosis in many cell types (1Moolenaar W.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). In addition, LPA can induce cytoskeletal reorganization that leads to cell rounding and stress fiber formation (1Moolenaar W.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 230-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 2Moolenaar W.H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 905: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 3Contos J.J. Ishii I. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1188-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Biological responses to LPA are elicited by activation of its specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Thus far, three genes (lpA1 , lpA2, andlpA3) encoding high affinity LPA receptors, LPA1/EDG-2, LPA2/EDG-4, and LPA3/EDG-7, have been identified in mammals (reviewed in Refs. 3Contos J.J. Ishii I.

Biological functions of these receptors have been characterized by overexpression and/or heterologous expression in mammalian cells (5Fukushima N. Kimura Y. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All three LPA receptors can mediate adenylyl cyclase inhibition, increases in intracellular calcium, inositol phosphate production, and MAP kinase activation. LPA1 and LPA2 can also induce cell rounding via activation of the small GTPase, Rho. Pharmacological studies suggest that both LPA1 and LPA2 couple to at least three types of G proteins, Gi/o, G12/13, and Gq, whereas LPA3 couples with Gi/o and Gq but not with G12/13 (13Ishii I. Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Genetic deletion of LPA1 in mice demonstrated that LPA1 is at least in part responsible for LPA signaling in vivo and is essential for normal development (14Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Weiner J.A. Kaushal D. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13384-13389Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). A molecularly different LPA receptor was reported in studies onXenopus oocytes (15Guo Z. Liliom K. Fischer D.J. Bathurst I.C. Tomei L.D. Kiefer M.C. Tigyi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14367-14372Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Guo et al. (15Guo Z. Liliom K. Fischer D.J. Bathurst I.C. Tomei L.D. Kiefer M.C. Tigyi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Overexpression of PSP24 in oocytes potentiated maximal LPA-induced oscillatory chloride ion (Cl−) currents, whereas injection of antisense oligonucleotide against PSP24 inhibited endogenous responses to LPA. Based on these observations, the authors concluded that PSP24 is a high affinity receptor for LPA. However, subsequent studies by others were inconsistent with this conclusion. Heterologous expression of PSP24 did not mediate LPA responses in yeast, whereas LPA1 did (7Erickson J.R. Wu J.J. Goddard J.G. Tigyi G. Kawanishi K. Tomei L.D. Kiefer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1506-1510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition, mammalian orthologs of PSP24 did not mediate responses to LPA in assays such as [35S]GTPγS binding, [3H]LPA binding, MAP kinase activation, [3H]thymidine incorporation, adenylyl cyclase inhibition, and increases in intracellular calcium (16Kawasawa Y. Kume K. Izumi T. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 957-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 17Marchese A. Sawzdargo M. Nguyen T. Cheng R. Heng H.H. Nowak T. Im D.S. Lynch K.R. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. Genomics. 1999; 56: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Mouse, human, and Xenopus homologs of PSP24 share ≥55% amino acid sequence identity with one another (18Kawasawa Y. Kume K. Nakade S. Haga H. Izumi T. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 952-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). These PSP24s have comparatively little amino acid sequence identity (≤20%) with members of the mammalian LPA receptor family (4Chun J. Contos J.J.A. Munroe D. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 30: 213-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). They instead show closest similarity to receptors for a bioactive peptide, cholecystokinin (4Chun J. Contos J.J.A. Munroe D. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 30: 213-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The dissimilarity between mammalian andXenopus LPA receptors was surprising based on the phylogenetic conservation of many other GPCRs for a single ligand. This disparity raises the question of whether Xenopus might use a fundamentally different LPA receptor system or might also express and use LPA receptors homologous to those found in mammals. Here, we report identification and characterization of two novel XenopusGPCRs that show 89–90% amino acid sequence identity with mammalian LPA1.

Retrovirus expression vector (LZRS-EGFP) and Phoenix ecotropic retrovirus producer cell lines were gifts from Dr. Garry P. Nolan (Stanford University, Stanford, CA). Y-27632 was a gift from Welfide Pharmaceutical Industries (Saitama, Japan). Trizol and all cell culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Anti-GFP antibody was obtained from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Forskolin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody, and other reagents were purchased from Sigma, unless otherwise noted. mRNA was prepared fromXenopus oocytes using the Oligotex direct mRNA kit (Qiagen, Valentia, CA) as described by Ferby et al. (20Ferby I. Blazquez M. Palmer A. Eritja R. Nebreda A.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2177-2189Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). First strand cDNA was synthesized from 500 ng of mRNA using oligo(dT) primers and the SUPERSCRIPT first-strand synthesis system (Life Technologies, Inc.). This cDNA was used as a template for PCR with degenerate primers designed toward sequences in transmembrane domains (TMD) II and VII conserved among members of the GPCR family (21Buck L. Axel R. Cell. 1991; 65: 175-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3647) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence for the TMD II primer is 5′-CCIATGTAYYTITTYYTYWSGAATTCIWSITTI-3′, and the sequence for the TMD VII primer is 5′-AARTCIGGRSWICGISARTAIATSAIIGGRTT-3′. The PCR condition was 40 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 45 °C for 1.5 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. After electrophoresis on agarose gels, three prominent bands of the expected size range (400–1300 base pairs (bp)) were recovered from the gel and re-amplified by PCR under the same conditions. The final PCR products were cloned into pCR 2.1 using TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and sequenced. To obtain full-length cDNAs for the PCR products, we screened aXenopus oocyte cDNA library (a gift from Dr. John Shuttleworth, University of Birmingham, UK) using a32P-labeled 560-bp PCR fragment as a probe. Two different full-length Xenopus LPA receptor isoforms were isolated as XLPAR-1 and XLPAR-10. XLPAR-1 contains 2053 bp, with 321 bp of 5′ untranslated region and 631 bp of 3′ untranslated region followed by a poly(A) tail. XLPAR-10 contains 1941 bp and lacks a poly(A) tail. These cDNA sequences were deposited in the EMBL data base with the accession numbers AJ249843 (XLPAR-1) and AJ249844(XLPAR-10). In view of their high degree of homology to mammalian LPA1, they are referred to here as XLPA1-1 and XLPA1-2 for XLPAR-1 and XLPAR-10, respectively. Nucleic acid and amino acid alignment was performed using the Clustal W multiple sequence alignment program found on the Web page of the DNA Data Bank of Japan. Tissues were quickly removed from female Xenopus, and total RNA was isolated from each tissue using Trizol according to the manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). Northern blotting was performed as described previously (6Hecht J.H. Weiner J.A. Post S.R. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 13Ishii I. Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), and membranes were analyzed with a Bio-Imaging analyzer BAS2500. Open reading frames (ORFs) of xlpA1 -1 and -2 were subcloned into BamHI-XhoI sites of the pBluescript SK(+) vector (Stratagene). Constructs were linearized withKpnI digestion and used as a template in in vitroRNA transcription using mMESSAGE mMACHINE Kits (Ambion, Austin, TX).Xenopus oocyte preparation, cRNA injection, and electrophysiology were performed as described previously (22Kimura H. Schubert D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7508-7512Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, stage V and VI oocytes from adult females were injected with 50 nl of appropriate cRNA (1 μg/μl) for overexpression and incubated at 16 °C for 3–5 days in modified Barth saline (88 mmNaCl, 1 mm KCl, 0.33 mmCa(NO3)2, 0.41 mmCaCl2, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 2.4 mm NaHCO3, 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4)) before recording. Oocytes were impaled by two microelectrodes filled with 3 m KCl and voltage-clamped at −50 mV. Only oocytes with resting potentials of less than −30 mV were used. Oocytes were continuously superfused with Ringer's solution (120 mmNaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 0.1% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin) in the presence of LPA. For antisense oligonucleotide studies, injection of oocytes with 50 nl of oligonucleotides (2 μg/μl) was performed 3–5 days before recording. The antisense oligonucleotides were designed to complement 11–12 nucleotides 5′ and 3′ to the initiation codon for xlpA1 -1 orxlpA1 -2. All oligonucleotides were phosphorothioated near 5′ and 3′ ends (*) to prevent degradation (23Dagle J.M. Walder J.A. Weeks D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 4751-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Antisense oligonucleotide sequences were 5′-G*A*A*A*GAGAAGCCAUUUUAGC*C*C*A*G-3′ forxlpA1 -1 and 5′-G*A*A*A*GCGAAGUCAUUUUAG*C*C*C*A*G-3′ forxlpA1 -2. Because the antisense oligonucleotides differed by only two nucleic acids, a single sense-orientation oligonucleotide corresponding to the region targeted for xlpA1 -1 and -2 was used as a negative control (5′-C*U*G*G*GCUAAAAUGGCUUCGC*U*U*U*C-3′). For the PTX experiments, Xenopus oocytes were incubated with 2 μg/ml PTX in modified Barth saline for 48 h before recording. The entire ORFs forxlpA1 -1 and -2 were subcloned into HindIII and XbaI sites of a pFLAG-CMV-1 mammalian expression vector (Eastman Kodak Co.) to introduce preprotrypsin-leader/FLAG-tag sequences into amino-terminal extracellular regions of each receptor for immunocytochemical detection of the receptor proteins. These constructs were then subcloned intoBamHI and XhoI sites of a Moloney murine leukemia retroviral vector, LZRS-EGFP (24Dardalhon V. Noraz N. Pollok K. Rebouissou C. Boyer M. Bakker A.Q. Spits H. Taylor N. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 5-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Sequences of internal ribosomal entry sites in the vector enable concomitant expression of EGFP and FLAG-tagged receptors within the single cell (13Ishii I. Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The inserts of the constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Retrovirus supernatants were prepared using a Phoenix cell line, as described previously (13Ishii I. Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). For the cell rounding assay, B103 cells were seeded onto glass coverslips coated with Cell-Tak (Becton Dickinson Labware, Bedford, MA) and infected with viral supernatants (13Ishii I. Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). After treatment with LPA, cells were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and incubated with the blocking solution (0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 0.25% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline). EGFP protein was visualized by incubation with anti-GFP polyclonal antibody, followed by incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). FLAG-tagged receptor was visualized by incubating cells with anti-FLAG antibody, followed by incubation with Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Cells were observed with a Zeiss Axiophot and a Plan-Neofluor × 40 objective (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) or a confocal laser-scanning microscope TCS NT and a PL APO 63 × 1.20 water-immersion objective (Leica, Deerfield, IL). For stress fiber formation assays, fixed RH7777 cells were immunostained for FLAG and polymerized actin, as previously described (5Fukushima N. Kimura Y. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6151-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). For measurement of intracellular cAMP contents, retrovirus-infected B103 cells were stimulated with LPA in the presence of 1 μm forskolin and 0.5 mm3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Intracellular cAMP contents were measured using a cAMP enzyme-immunoassay system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data shown are the means ± S.E. from replicate samples from replicate experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's t test. To identify novel GPCRs inXenopus oocytes, we performed a PCR-based screen using degenerate oligonucleotide primers designed against TMD II and VII (6Hecht J.H. Weiner J.A. Post S.R. Chun J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1071-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 21Buck L. Axel R. Cell. 1991; 65: 175-187Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3647) Google Scholar). The PCR amplifications resulted in three faint bands in the expected size range for the region between TMD II and TMD VII of GPCRs (400–1300 bp) that were re-amplified and cloned. DNA sequencing identified two fragments with 90% identity in predicted amino acid sequences to those of the mammalian LPA1 receptor. These PCR fragments were then used as probes to screen a Xenopus oocyte cDNA library, and two different cDNAs (xlpA1 -1 andxlpA1 -2) were cloned, which encoded GPCRs consisting of 366 amino acids that differed by 6 amino acids (Fig.1, A and B). The comparison of nucleic acid sequences showed thatxlpA1 -1 was 96% identical in the predicted ORF with xlpA1 -2, whereas there was much less identity in their 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (69 and 61%, respectively; Fig. 1 A). Because the nucleotides that differ between xlpA1 -1 and -2are distributed throughout the entire ORFs,xlpA1 -1 and -2 were probably encoded by different genes rather than produced by alternative splicing.Figure 1Comparative sequences ofxlpA1-1 andxlpA1-2.

At the nucleic acid level,xlpA1 -1 was 75% identical to mouse lpA1 and 77% identical to humanlpA1, whereas xlpA1 -2was 78% identical to mouse lpA1 and 77% identical to human lpA1. A comparison of predicted amino acid sequences indicated that both clones were 89–90% identical to both mouse and human LPA1 (Fig. 1 B). The amino acids were least conserved between Xenopus clones and mammalian LPA1s in the first 24 amino acids of the amino-terminal regions (5 of 22 amino acids were identical). To examine expression ofxlpA1 -1 and -2 inXenopus, total RNA from various tissues was isolated and analyzed by high stringency Northern blot analysis (Fig.2). The strongest signal was observed in oocytes, where a band of ∼2.2 kb was observed. In addition, brain and spinal cord samples expressed this 2.2-kb band but also expressed larger species of ∼5.8 and 11 kb (Fig. 2). Because the nucleic acid sequences of xlpA1 -1 differed by only 3% from xlpA1 -2 and were dispersed throughout the ORFs, attempts to differentiate the forms by Northern blot analysis were unsuccessful. xlpA1 -1and -2 expression was highest in oocytes, at lower levels in brain and spinal cord, and below detection in lung, heart, kidney, liver, muscle, stomach, and intestine. Application of LPA is known to evoke oscillatory inward Cl− currents in native Xenopus oocytes, an indication that oocytes endogenously express LPA receptors (25Tigyi G. Miledi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21360-21367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Durieux M.E. Salafranca M.N. Lynch K.R. Moorman J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C896-C900Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Fernhout B.J. Dijcks F.A. Moolenaar W.H. Ruigt G.S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1992; 213: 313-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To examine whether XLPA1-1 or XLPA1-2 could function as high affinity LPA receptors, each was overexpressed by cRNA injection into oocytes, and the Cl− currents in response to LPA were recorded (Figs. 3 and 4). Control (diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water)-injected oocytes did not show any response to 3 nm LPA, whereas overexpression of eitherxlpA1 -1 orxlpA1 -2 elicited LPA-induced Cl− currents at this concentration (data not shown). At higher LPA concentrations (10 nm), application of LPA on control oocytes induced small Cl− currents averaging 50 nA (Figs. 3 A and 4A). Overexpression of eitherxlpA1 -1 orxlpA1 -2 significantly potentiated the LPA-induced Cl− currents (Figs. 3 A and 4A). Sphingosine 1-phosphate, a structurally related bioactive lysophospholipid, did not evoke Cl− currents in either control or xlpA1 -1- and/orxlpA1 -2-overexpressing oocytes (data not shown). If XLPA1-1 and/or XLPA1-2 mediate endogenous LPA responses, a reduction in receptor expression could result in decreased Cl− currents in response to LPA. To address this, sense (as a control) or antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized as 23–24-mers designed to block the initiation codon and thus inhibitxlpA1 -1 and -2 translation. When these oligonucleotides were injected into oocytes, only injection of antisense oligonucleotides completely blocked Cl−currents evoked by 10 nm LPA (Figs. 3 B and 4B). InXenopus oocytes, endogenous LPA-evoked Cl− currents have been documented to be unaffected by preincubation with PTX, consistent with the involvement of Gq pathways (28Kakizawa K. Nomura H. Yoshida A. Ueda H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 61: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Thus, we further examined whether XLPA1 might produce PTX-insensitive Cl− currents.xlpA1 -1-injected oocytes were preincubated with PTX and electrophysiologically examined. As shown in Figs. 3 C and 4C, PTX did not significantly affect LPA-evoked Cl− currents. This observation demonstrated the involvement of PTX-insensitive G proteins in XLPA1-mediated responses in Xenopus oocytes. To examine additional signaling properties of XLPA1-1 and -2 as compared with the known properties of mammalian LPA1, each was expressed in B103 rat neuroblastoma cells (19Schubert D. Heinemann S. Carlisle W. Tarikas H. Kimes B. Patrick J. Steingach J.H. Culp W. Brandt B.L. Nature. 1974; 249: 224-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar) by infection with receptor-expressing recombinant retrovirus. The B103 cell line was chosen because it does not express any known LPA receptors and lacks endogenous responses to LPA, but does express appropriate α subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (Gi/o, Gq, and G12/13subtypes) that can couple with LPA receptors (5Fukushima N. Kimura Y. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6151-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 13Ishii I. Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Retroviral infection was used to introduce receptors into B103 cells to permit high efficiency expression and low cytotoxicity compared with conventional transfection methods (13Ishii I. Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether XLPA1-1 or -2 was expressed in infected B103 cells, immunohistochemistry was used to identify the epitope (FLAG)-tagged receptors. FLAG-tagged protein was detected as punctate labeling in both soma and neurites (Fig.5, E, H, and K). Consistent with retroviral mediated protein expression (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 13Ishii I. Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), EGFP protein was also strongly and ubiquitously expressed in all receptor-expressing cells (Fig. 5, A, D, G, and J). Because the cells expressing EGFP proteins completely overlapped the cells expressing FLAG proteins (Fig. 5 and Ref. 13Ishii I. Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), EGFP fluorescence was used to monitor the infection efficiency before all functional assays. Typical infection percentages approximated 70–90%.Figure 5Confocal microscopy of cells heterologously expressing XLPA1-1 and XLPA1-2. Confocal laser-scanning microscopy of B103 cells infected with control retrovirus (vector control) (A–C), XLPA1-1-expressing retrovirus (D–F), XLPA1-2-expressing retrovirus (G–I), and mouse LPA1-expressing retrovirus (J–L). Cells were treated with 1 μm LPA for 15 min (C, F, I, and L). After fixation, cells were double-immunostained for EGFP (fluorescein isothiocyanate (green) in A, C, D, F, G, I, J, and L) and FLAG epitope (Cy3 (red) in B, E, H, and K). Cells expressing LPA1s (XLPA1-1, XLPA1-2, and mouse LPA1) showed a marked increase in cell rounding in response to LPA as compared with controls.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mouse LPA1 mediates LPA-induced cytoskeletal reorganization including cell rounding in B103 cells and stress fiber formation in RH7777 rat hepatoma cells (5Fukushima N.

To examine whether XLPA1-1 and XLPA1-2 also mediate cell rounding, B103 cells were infected, treated with various concentrations of LPA for 15 min, double-immunostained against EGFP and FLAG-tagged proteins, and observed by fluorescence microscopy. Without treatment, B103 cells had neurites protruding from the cell body (Fig. 5, A, D, G, and J), and after LPA stimulation, cells infected with control virus did not change their shapes (Figs. 5 C and 6A). In contrast, B103 cells expressing XLPA1-1 or XLPA1-2 and exposed to LPA resulted in an increase in rounded cells with retracted neurites (Figs. 5, F and I, and 6A). The maximal effects and EC50 values (∼10 nm) for LPA were comparable with those observed for cells expressing mouse LPA1 (Figs. 5 L and 6A). LPA-induced cell rounding in cells expressing XLPA1-1 or XLPA1-2 was completely inhibited by pretreatment with a Rho kinase inhibitor, Y-27632 (29Uehata M. Ishizaki T. Satoh H. Ono T. Kawahara T. Morishita T. Tamakawa H. Yamagami K. Inui J. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Nature. 1997; 389: 990-994Crossref PubMed Scopus (2527) Google Scholar), but not with PTX pretreatment (data not shown). As with B103 cells, RH 7777 cells neither express any known LPA receptors nor show endogenous response to LPA (5Fukushima N. Kimura Y. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6151-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). However, heterologous expression of mouse LPA1 in these cells produces LPA-dependent stress fiber formation (5Fukushima N. Kimura Y. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6151-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Heterologous expression of XLPA1-1 or XLPA1-2 increased the percentage of cells with stress fibers following LPA stimulation (1.9% in control cells, 29.1% in XLPA1-1-expressing cells, and 32.0% in XLPA1-2-expressing cells). This effect was comparable in extent and completely indistinguishable from the stress fibers produced in previous studies of mouse LPA1-expressing cells (5Fukushima N. Kimura Y. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6151-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Mouse LPA1 mediates LPA-induced inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in B103 cells (13Ishii I. Contos J.J. Fukushima N.

Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 881-888Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Infected B103 cells were incubated with forskolin (1 μm) in the absence or presence of various concentrations of LPA for 15 min. Intracellular cAMP content was measured by enzyme immunoassay. Forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation in B103 cells expressing XLPA1-1 or XLPA1-2 was inhibited by LPA treatment (Fig.6 B). Maximal inhibition in both was ∼32% and was smaller than that observed in cells expressing mouse LPA1(∼63%). However, the EC50 values for inhibition were comparable among XLPA1-1, XLPA1-2, and mouse LPA1 (∼10 nm). This inhibition was completely blocked by PTX pretreatment (data not shown). In this study, we identified and characterized two novelXenopus GPCRs, XLPA1-1 and XLPA1-2. Based on nucleotide and amino acid sequence similarities, endogenous expression in Xenopus tissues, and their function in both oocytes and mammalian cells, XLPA1-1 and XLPA1-2 are functional Xenopus homologs of the mammalian high affinity LPA receptor LPA1. A comparison of nucleic acid sequences, including divergent untranslated regions, and predicted amino acid sequences ofxlpA1 -1 andxlpA1 -2 indicates that they are derived from two distinct genes rather than generated by alternative splicing of a single gene. The existence of multiple genes for a given function is not uncommon for Xenopus laevis (20Ferby I. Blazquez M. Palmer A. Eritja R. Nebreda A.R.

Baker M.A. Wilson A.C. Haji-Azimi I. Fischberg M. Science. 1977; 195: 785-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). xlpA1 -1 and/or -2 mRNA was expressed at high levels in oocytes and at lower levels in brain and spinal cord among the various Xenopus tissues examined. Alignment of amino acid sequences revealed that both XLPA1-1 and XLPA1-2 were highly similar to mammalian LPA1 (∼89% identity) (3Contos J.J. Ishii I. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1188-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 4Chun J. Contos J.J.A. Munroe D. Cell Biochem.

By contrast, no signal was detected after Northern blot hybridization with mouse LPA2 or LPA3 probes under conditions allowing detection of XLPA1-1 and XLPA1-2 using mouse LPA1 (data not shown). This result suggests thatXenopus homologs of mammalian LPA2 or LPA3 do not exist in the Xenopus tissues examined or, at least, not those with the same degree of similarity as between mouse and Xenopus LPA1. In Xenopus oocytes, endogenous LPA-evoked Cl−currents have been reported to be mediated through the activation of Gq and phospholipase C, based on studies using pharmacological or antisense oligonucleotide approaches (28Kakizawa K. Nomura H. Yoshida A. Ueda H. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1998; 61: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 36Noh S.J. Kim M.J. Shim S. Han J.K. J. Cell. Physiol. 1998; 176: 412-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In studies of mammalian LPA1, it was recently reported that LPA stimulates phospholipase C through Gq pathways (13Ishii I. Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Combined with data from the present study including PTX-insensitive augmentation of LPA-evoked Cl− currents byxlpA1, we conclude that endogenous LPA responses probably are mediated by Gq activation via XLPA1s. In addition to Gq activation, both XLPA1s stimulate Rho (perhaps through G12/13) and Gipathways, resulting in cell rounding and stress fiber formation, and inhibition of cAMP accumulation, respectively. All responses are similar to those observed directly in previous studies of mammalian LPA1 (5Fukushima N. Kimura Y. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6151-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 13Ishii I. Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The EC50 of LPA for cytoskeletal changes, as well as adenylyl cyclase inhibition in cells expressing XLPA1, is below 10 nm, which is comparable with that of mouse LPA1 (5Fukushima N. Kimura Y. Chun J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6151-6156Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 13Ishii I. Contos J.J. Fukushima N. Chun J. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). These results strongly support the identification of XLPA1-1 and -2 as LPA receptors inXenopus. Xenopus oocytes appear to express both high and low affinity receptors for LPA based on electrophysiological studies of LPA-dependent Cl− currents (25Tigyi G. Miledi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21360-21367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Liliom K. Bittman R. Swords B. Tigyi G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 616-623PubMed Google Scholar, 38Liliom K.

Kiefer M.C. Tigyi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14367-14372Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) have reported a high affinity site for LPA with an EC50 of 12 nm and a low affinity site of 1 μm. Here, we observed that overexpression of XLPA1-1 or -2 potentiated the Cl− currents evoked by application of low concentrations (3–10 nm) of LPA. Injection of antisense oligonucleotide designed to inhibit expression of endogenous XLPA1-1 and -2 completely inhibited the Cl− currents evoked by the application of 10 nm LPA. Combined with the data from heterologous expression, we conclude that XLPA1-1 and XLPA1-2 are high affinity LPA receptors inXenopus oocytes. It should be noted that a different gene, PSP24, was previously reported to encode Xenopus high affinity LPA receptor, based on the potentiation of LPA-evoked Cl− currents in oocytes following its overexpression (15Guo Z. Liliom K. Fischer D.J. Bathurst I.C. Tomei L.D. Kiefer M.C. Tigyi G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14367-14372Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Xenopus PSP24 is dissimilar to mammalian LPA receptors, having less than 20% amino acid sequence identity with mammalian LPA1 (4Chun J. Contos J.J.A. Munroe D. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 30: 213-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Moreover, heterologous expression ofXenopus PSP24 in yeast and of mammalian orthologs of PSP24 in mammalian cells does not mediate LPA responses (7Erickson J.R. Wu J.J. Goddard J.G. Tigyi G. Kawanishi K. Tomei L.D. Kiefer M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1506-1510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 16Kawasawa Y. Kume K. Izumi T. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 957-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Our data did not directly address the role of PSP24, because experimental results focused on XLPA1-1 and XLPA1-2 were sufficient to account for measured LPA responses in Xenopus oocytes. It is possible that an indirect relationship exists between XLPA1-1 and XLPA1-2 and PSP24, although we note the existence of technical difficulties in examining altered gene expression or post-translational changes in single, injected, and electrophysiologically characterized oocytes. The precise mechanism for LPA-evoked effects related to PSP24 in oocytes remains for future work, along with the question of what receptor mechanisms mediate the low affinity LPA interactions, which were not addressed in this study. In summary, we have identified and characterized two high affinityXenopus LPA receptors, both of which are similar in structure and function to mammalian LPA1 receptors. The existence of XLPA1s provides a more evolutionarily frugal mechanism for LPA signaling that appears to be conserved fromXenopus through humans."

One such factor is SHARP-1, initially identified on the basis of its sequence similarity to hairy. Unlikehairy, and atypically for bHLHs, SHARP-1 is expressed late in development, suggestive of a role in terminal aspects of differentiation. Nevertheless, the role of SHARP-1 and the identity of its target genes remain unknown. During the course of a one-hybrid screen for transcription factors that bind to regulatory domains of the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor gene, we isolated the bHLH transcription factor SHARP-1. In this study, we investigated the functional role of SHARP-1 in regulating transcription. Fusion proteins of SHARP-1 tethered to the gal4 DNA binding domain repress both basal and activated transcription when recruited to either a TATA-containing or a TATAless promoter. Furthermore, we identified two independent repression domains that operate via distinct mechanisms. Repression by a domain in the C terminus is sensitive to the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A, whereas repression by the bHLH domain is insensitive to TSA. Furthermore, overexpression of SHARP-1 represses transcription from the M1 promoter.

Neurobiol. 1995; 10: 75-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 5Fisher A.L. Caudy M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1931-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar, 6Campuzano S. Modolell J. Trends Genet. 1992; 8: 202-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Some, such as Mash-1 (mouse a chaete s cute homologue), are transcriptional activators and act as positive regulators of neurogenesis, whereas others, such as HES-1 (homologue of H airy and E nhancer of S plit), are transcriptional repressors and act as negative regulators of neurogenesis. Structurally, bHLH proteins share a number of common features. The HLH domain mediates homomeric or heteromeric dimerization (7Murre C. McCaw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1862) Google Scholar), and the adjacent basic region mediates DNA binding. Three groups of bHLH proteins can be recognized, according to the target binding site they recognize (8Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 9Dang C.V. Dolde C. Gillison M.L. Kato G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Class A and Class C bHLHs function as transcriptional activators and repressors, respectively, whereas class B bHLH proteins can be either activators or repressors. Recently, the cDNA for SHARP-1, a novel bHLH protein, was isolated on the basis of its homology to Hairy and Enhancer of Split (11Rossner M.J. Dorr J. Gass P. Schwab M.H. Nave K.A. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1997; 10: 460-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, sequence alignment showed that SHARP-1 is only distantly related to these proteins, exhibiting 37–42% sequence identity within the bHLH domain. Unlike most bHLH proteins, SHARP-1 is not expressed in neuronal progenitor cells or early differentiating neurons but is restricted to a subset of neurons of the postnatal central nervous system (11Rossner M.J. Dorr J. Gass P. Schwab M.H. Nave K.A. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1997; 10: 460-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), suggestive of a role in terminal neuronal differentiation rather than in neural determination. Unlike all other HAIRY/E(spl)/HES proteins, SHARP-1 lacks the hallmark WRPW domain, which binds the co-repressor GROUCHO (or GROUCHO-like proteins) and is required for both transcriptional repression and suppression of neurogenesis. Absence of the WRPW motif suggests that SHARP-1 functions by recruiting transcriptional machinery other than GROUCHO. All class B bHLH proteins contain an arginine at position 13 in the basic region, essential for these proteins to bind to class B sites. The presence of an arginine at this position in SHARP-1 suggests that it belongs in this group, but because this group contains both activators and repressors, SHARP-1 function cannot be predicted on the basis of protein sequence. At present, almost nothing is known about the role of bHLH proteins in differentiated neurons, and in common with many other bHLH proteins, no target genes of SHARP-1 are known. In the present study, we ascribe a transcriptional function to SHARP-1 and identify the M1muscarinic acetylcholine receptor gene as a target gene. We show that SHARP-1 is able to repress transcription of both TATA-containing and TATAless promoters when recruited via a Gal4 DNA binding domain (DBD). Repression occurs when SHARP-1 is bound either proximally or more distally to the promoter. Furthermore, we show that repression by SHARP-1 is bimodal. One mode of repression requires the bHLH domain and is insensitive to the histone deacetylase inhibitor, TSA, whereas the other is mediated via the C-terminal domain and represses transcription through a TSA-sensitive mechanism. We also show that overexpression of SHARP-1 represses transcription of a reporter construct containing the M1 promoter. These results show that within the HAIRY-related/HES family, SHARP-1 is unique in its combination of presumed biological function and transcriptional mechanism.

Hartley D.A. Cellular Interactions in Development: A Practical Approach. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 153-179Google Scholar). This yeast strain was then transformed with DNA from an adult rat brain cDNA yeast expression library (CLONTECH), using the protocol of Schiestl and Gietz (17Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1776) Google Scholar), and transformants were grown on complete supplement mixture −His/−Leu/−Trp (Bio 101, Vista, CA), containing 5 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (Sigma) to select for interactions. Library candidates were tested for their ability to specifically activate the M1-containing reporter plasmid by retransforming back into SFY526. Library plasmids producing interacting proteins were sequenced for identification. RNA was extracted from cell lines and brain tissue using Tri reagent (Sigma) and reverse-transcribed using oligo(dT) and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). Oligonucleotides used to amplify the SHARP-1 gene were as follows: SHARP-1.125s, 5′-AGGATACCTACAAATTACCGC; and SHARP-1.441a, 5′-CGCGAGGTATTGCAAGAC. Numbers are relative to the translation start site of SHARP-1. The oligonucleotides used to amplify the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) gene were as follows:hprt 231s, 5′-CCTGCTGGATTACATTAAAGCACTG; and hprt567a, 5′-CCTGAAGTACTCATTATAGTCAAGG. Aliquots of the reaction mixture were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel. Cell lines were cultured in 5% CO2 at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 6 g/liter penicillin, 10 g/liter streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Qiagen column-purified DNA was transfected into cells using Tfx™ 50 (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were plated onto 10-mm wells to a density of 50%. For IMR32 and 3T3 cells, 750 ng of plasmid (for amounts of individual plasmids see the figure legends), 3 ng of pRL-CMV, and 1.5 μl of Tfx™ 50 were mixed and made up to a total volume of 200 μl with Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) and applied to cells for 3–4 h. For Neuro 2a cells, 250 ng of plasmid (for amounts of individual plasmids see the figure legends), 1 ng of pRL-CMV, and 0.5 μl of Tfx™ 50 were used. Cells were harvested 24 h later into 60 μl Passive lysis buffer (Promega), of which 30 μl were used in the Promega DLR™ assay system. Luminescence was measured using a Mediators PhL 1.8 luminometer, firefly luciferase was normalized to Renilla luciferase, and the results were expressed as a percentage of normalized expression in the presense of pMT G4. For transfections in the presence of TSA (Wako Chemical), cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of TSA for 24 h prior to transfection and fed with media containing TSA for 24 h. Neuro 2a cells were plated onto 10-cm plates to a density of 50%. Cells were incubated for 3–4 h with 10 μg of DNA and 22.5 μl of Tfx™ 50 in a final volume of 4.8 ml. Cells were harvested after 2 days into 1 ml of 1× phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and protease inhibitors Block (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), sonicated for 90 s, and centrifuged at maximum speed for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was precleared for 2 h with 80 μl of protein G-Sepharose. For each immunoprecipitation, half of the total sample was incubated with 3 μl of Gal4 DBD antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight. Beads were added, and samples were incubated for an additional 2 h. Samples were washed four times with 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and 0.1% SDS. Proteins were eluted with 15 μl of loading dye. Samples were run on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel and blotted onto a Hybond C+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membrane was subjected to Western blot analysis using a 1/1000 dilution ofc-myc antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). In our previous studies, we have shown that transcription of the M1muscarinic acetylcholine receptor gene is regulated by several domains within the first exon (12Pepitoni S. Wood I.C. Buckley N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17112-17117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18Wood I.C. Garriga-Canut M. Palmer C.L. Pepitoni S. Buckley N.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In particular, the region between +166 and +412 (relative to the transcription start site) appears to contain both enhancer and repressor elements. To identify transcription factors that bind to this region of the M1 gene we used the yeast one-hybrid approach (19Wang R. Reed R. Nature. 1993; 364: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 20Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Arai J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G. Cell. 1995; 80: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar). Using the +166/+417 domain as bait to screen an adult rat brain cDNA library, we isolated two independent positive clones (Fig.1 a, colonies 3 and 10). Digestion of the isolated clones showed that they both contain an insert of 1.5 kilobases (Fig.1 b). Sequencing of the inserts in these clones showed that they were identical and contained the entire open reading frame of the previously identified transcription factor SHARP-1 (11Rossner M.J. Dorr J. Gass P. Schwab M.H. Nave K.A. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1997; 10: 460-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Growth of yeast on plates containing 10 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole was dependent upon the binding of SHARP-1 to the M1 sequence, because no growth was seen in the absence of either bait or SHARP-1 (Fig. 1 a). SHARP-1 was originally isolated during the course of a search for mammalian bHLH proteins expressed in differentiated neurons (11Rossner M.J. Dorr J. Gass P. Schwab M.H. Nave K.A. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1997; 10: 460-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Although SHARP-1 was isolated by homology to hairy andEnhancer of Split, sequence alignment with these proteins shows that they are quite distantly related, sharing only 37–42% homology within the bHLH domain (11Rossner M.J. Dorr J. Gass P. Schwab M.H. Nave K.A. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1997; 10: 460-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). As a first step toward identification of a function for SHARP-1, we carried out a data base search for proteins with homology to SHARP-1 and identified three proteins: SHARP-2, Stra13, and DEC1 (Fig.2). SHARP-2 is a bHLH protein isolated in the same screen as that used to identify SHARP-1 (11Rossner M.J. Dorr J. Gass P. Schwab M.H. Nave K.A. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1997; 10: 460-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), and its function is also unknown. Stra13 was isolated as a retinoic acid-inducible gene in mouse P19 embryonic carcinoma cells and has been shown to be able to repress the thymidine kinase promoter when fused to Gal4 DBD (21Boudjelal M. Taneja R. Matsubara S. Bouillet P. Dolle P. Chambon P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2052-2065Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Finally, DEC1 is a protein that was cloned by subtractive hybridization to identify mRNAs expressed in cAMP-differentiated human embryo chondrocytes (22Shen M. Kawamoto T. Yan W. Nakamasu K. Tamagami M. Koyano Y. Noshiro M. Kato Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 236: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Again, no function for DEC1 has been reported. Inspection of amino acid sequences shows that SHARP-2, Stra13, and DEC1 contain 411 or 412 amino acids, of which 366 are conserved, showing a sequence identity between them of 89%, suggesting that they are, in fact, rat, mouse, and human homologues. SHARP-1 is more divergent and contains only 253 amino acids. The highest sequence identity is seen in the bHLH domain and in helices 3 and 4 (also called Orange domain (23Dawson S.R. Turner D.L. Weintraub H. Parkhurst S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6923-6931Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar,24Giebel B. Campos-Ortega J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6250-6254Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar)), whereas within the C-terminal domain only two stretches of 8 and 11 amino acids are conserved. All bHLH proteins dimerize to bind DNA (25Murre C. McCaw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Lassar A.B. Cell. 1989; 58: 537-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar). Because SHARP-1 was identified in the present study using a yeast one-hybrid screen, it seemed likely that SHARP-1 could either homodimerize or heterodimerize with a yeast partner. To distinguish between these possibilities, we carried out an immunoprecipitation assay using differentially tagged recombinant SHARP-1. Neuro 2a cells were transfected with either a combination of myc-tagged SHARP-1 (pMT SHARP-1) and myc-tagged Gal4 DBD (pMT G4) (Fig.3, lanes 1 and 3) or a combination of myc-tagged SHARP-1 (pMT SHARP-1) and amyc-tagged fusion of Gal4 DBD and SHARP-1 (pMT G4 SHARP-1) (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 4). Cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with Gal4 DBD antiserum and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the results were visualized by Western blot analysis using c-myc antiserum. An antibody to Gal4 was able to co-immunoprecipitate SHARP-1 only in the presence of a GAL4-SHARP-1 fusion protein (Fig. 3, compare lanes 4 and3), demonstrating that SHARP-1 is able to homodimerize. It has been shown previously that expression of SHARP-1 is largely restricted to differentiated neurons in the postnatal central nervous system, predominantly in the cerebellum and hippocampus, although it is also detectable at a reduced level in heart, muscle, and lung (11Rossner M.J. Dorr J. Gass P. Schwab M.H. Nave K.A. Mol. Cell Neurosci. 1997; 10: 460-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). We examined expression of SHARP-1 in different cell lines and cerebellum using reverse transcription-PCR. As seen in Fig.4 a, SHARP-1 is highly expressed in IMR32 cells, a human neuroblastoma cell line that also expresses M1, Neuro 2a cells, and NB4 1A3, two mouse M1 non-expressing neuroblastoma cell lines. Low levels of expression were detected in the 3T3 fibroblast cell line. PCR was carried out using hprt primers as a cDNA loading control (Fig.4 b). bHLH proteins can act as transcriptional activators or repressors (reviewed in Ref. 1Kageyama R. Ishibashi M. Takebayashi K. Tomita K. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1389-1399Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Because the transcriptional function of SHARP-1 is unknown, we assessed its ability to (a) regulate transcription from both TATA-containing and TATAless promoters, (b) regulate transcription when bound either proximally or distally, and (c) regulate basal and activated transcription. IMR32, 3T3, and Neuro 2a cells were transfected with plasmids expressing SHARP-1 fused to Gal4 DBD with each of the reporter genes showed in Fig. 5. pTRE UAS TATA contains seven TRE and five Gal4 binding sites 21 base pairs upstream of the E1b TATA box. pGL3 UAS TRE TATA contains five Gal4 binding sites (placed 350 base pairs from the TATA box) and seven TRE upstream of the TATA box. In pGL3 TRE UAS Inr, the TATA box from pGL3 TRE UAS TATA, was replaced by the adenovirus major late promoter initiator. Expression values of all reporter constructs were normalized to expression in the presence of Gal4 DBD alone. SHARP-1 was able to repress transcription of a TATA-containing promoter when bound proximally to the transcription start site in all cell lines (Fig. 5 a,left). SHARP-1 was also able to repress activated transcription by Tet-VP16 (activation domain of the herpes simplex virus transcriptional activator VP-16 fused to the binding domain of the tetracycline-responsive factor) in all cell lines (Fig.5 a, right). In addition, SHARP-1 was able to repress both basal and activated transcription from a TATA-containing promoter when bound distally to the transcription start site (Fig.5 b). We also tested the ability of SHARP-1 to regulate transcription from a TATAless promoter. As can be seen in Fig.5 c, SHARP-1 can repress basal and activated transcription from a TATAless promoter. We therefore conclude that SHARP-1 acts as a repressor of both basal and activated transcription of both TATA-containing and TATAless promoters. In the case of a TATA-containing promoter, repression is evident when SHARP-1 is bound either proximally or distally to the promoter, although the degree of repression is more marked when SHARP-1 is tethered proximally. To map the domain(s) responsible for the repression function of SHARP-1, we generated deletion mutants of the Gal4-SHARP-1 fusion protein. The ability of these fusion proteins to repress transcription was analyzed using the reporter gene driven by a TATA-containing promoter with five Gal4 binding sites proximal to the transcription start site (pTRE UAS TATA) in Neuro 2a cells (Fig.6). Results were normalized to expression of the reporter gene in the presence of Gal4 DBD alone. Western blot analysis showed that all constructs were expressed at similar levels (data not shown). Deletion of the C-terminal domain of SHARP-1 (to give pMT G4 NbHO-SHARP-1) slightly relieved repression by SHARP-1, but the C-terminal domain (residues 174–253) of SHARP-1 fused to Gal4 DBD (pMT G4 C-SHARP-1) was able to repress transcription as robustly as full-length SHARP-1. Therefore, it would appear that SHARP-1 must contain at least two independent repression domains, one in the C-terminal domain and another in the remaining fragment. To map the second repression domain of SHARP-1, more deletion mutants were examined. Deletion of the Orange domain and C-terminal domain to give pMT G4 NbH-SHARP-1 still gave robust repression, but further deletion of the bHLH domain to leave only the N-terminal domain (pMT G4 N-SHARP-1) led to relief of most of the repression activity, suggesting that the bHLH domain also mediates repression. This was confirmed by analysis of two further constructs. Fusion of the Orange domain and flanking sequence (residues 103–173) and the Gal4 DBD (pMT G4 O-SHARP-1) showed some degree of repression, but fusion of the bHLH domain (residues 43–102) and Gal4 DBD (pMT G4 bH-SHARP-1) indicated that the bulk of repression in this second region was mediated by the bHLH domain. In summary, we identified two independent repression domains in SHARP-1, one in the bHLH domain and the other in the C terminus. Recent studies have shown that many transcriptional repressors exert their action through recruitment of histone deacetylase activity (see Ref. 26Ayer D.E. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 193-198Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar for review). To test whether SHARP-1 represses transcription through such a mechanism, we treated Neuro 2a cells with the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA (27Yoshida M. Horinouchi S. Beppu T. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 423-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (667) Google Scholar) and examined the effect on SHARP-1-mediated repression (Fig.7). For each concentration of TSA used, expression values of the reporter gene were normalized to those obtained in the presence of Gal4 DBD alone, and results were expressed as fold over untreated cells. Repression by full-length SHARP-1 is partially relieved by TSA, because expression of the reporter gene was derepressed 4-fold in the presence of 100 nm TSA. Deletion of the C-terminal domain of SHARP-1 (to give pMT G4 NbHLHO-SHARP-1) showed that repression mediated by the bHLH domains was much less sensitive to TSA, resulting in a 1.6-fold derepression by 100 nm TSA. However, repression by the C-terminal domain alone was relieved by 6.5-fold with 100 nm TSA, and 2-fold derepression could be seen in the presence of 10 nm TSA. These results show that the C-terminal domain of SHARP-1 represses transcription via a mechanism that is likely to involve histone deacetylase activity but that the bHLH domain represses transcription in a histone deacetylase-independent manner. To test the functional effect of SHARP-1 on M1 expression, IMR32, 3T3, and Neuro 2a cells were transfected with a reporter vector containing the region of the M1 gene between −372 and +602 (relative to the transcription start site). This construct has been shown before to be capable of driving expression in IMR32 cells, a neuronal cell line that expresses the M1 gene (18Wood I.C. Garriga-Canut M. Palmer C.L. Pepitoni S. Buckley N.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The same construct does not drive expression in the non-M1-expressing neuronal cell line Neuro 2a and drives only low levels of expression in 3T3 cells (18Wood I.C. Garriga-Canut M. Palmer C.L. Pepitoni S. Buckley N.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 475-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SHARP-1 (pSHARP-1 myc) had no effect on expression of the promoterless reporter vector pGL3 basic but reduced expression driven by the M1 promoter by 55% in IMR32 cells (Fig.8 a). A similar effect was seen in 3T3 cells (Fig. 8 b). No effect was seen in Neuro 2a, the neuronal cell line that does not express M1 (data not shown). These results show that SHARP-1 is able to repress expression of the M1 gene in an M1-expressing cell line. bHLH proteins are key players that regulate many aspects of development and differentiation in all tissues and phyla. To date, no target genes or function of SHARP-1 has been identified. SHARP-1 is unusual in two respects. First, SHARP-1 is related to, but distinct from, HAIRY/E(spl)/HES bHLH proteins. Second, expression of SHARP-1 appears to be restricted to postnatal neurons of the central nervous system, rather than neural progenitors, implying a role in late neuronal differentiation rather than neurogenesis. These features suggested that SHARP-1 may affect transcriptional regulation and target promoters distinct from those used by other members of the HAIRY/E(spl)/HES bHLH family. SHARP-1 contains an Arg in position 13 of the basic region present in all class B bHLH proteins. This residue is essential for class B proteins to bind the consensus sequence CA(C/T)GTG (9Dang C.V. Dolde C. Gillison M.L. Kato G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis of the region between +166 and +417 of the M1 gene does not indicate the presence of any known recognition consensus motif (class A, B, or C) for bHLH (8Blackwell T.K. Weintraub H. Science. 1990; 250: 1104-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar, 9Dang C.V. Dolde C. Gillison M.L. Kato G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

https://openalex.org/W1541289810,"Upon infection to the Escherichia coli cell, the genome of bacteriophage λ either replicates to form new progenies (lytic growth) or integrates into the host chromosome (lysogenization). The λ CII protein is a key determinant in the lysis-lysogeny decision. It is a short-lived transcription activator for the λ genes essential for lysogeny establishment. In this study, we isolated a new class of hfl (high frequency lysogenization) mutants of E. coli, using a new selection for enhancement of CII-stimulated transcription. The gene affected was termed hflD, which encodes a protein of 213 amino acids. AnhflD-disrupted mutant indeed showed an Hfl phenotype, indicating that HflD acts to down-regulate lysogenization. HflD is associated peripherally with the cytoplasmic membrane. Its interaction with CII was demonstrated in vitro using purified proteins as well as in vivo using the bacterial two-hybrid system. Pulse-chase examinations demonstrated that the HflD function is required for the rapid in vivo degradation of CII, although it interfered with FtsH-mediated CII proteolysis in an in vitro reaction system using detergent-solubilized components. We suggest that HflD is a factor that sequesters CII from the target promoters and recruits it to the membrane where the FtsH protease is localized.

When bacteriophage λ infects to the Escherichia colicell, it undergoes either lytic growth or lysogenization (1McAdams H.H. Shapiro L. Science. 1995; 269: 650-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The establishment of λ lysogenization requires sufficient accumulation of the repressor protein, CI, before the lytic cycle is initiated. Transcription of the cI gene from the pRE promoter is positively regulated by the CII protein, which also activates the pI promoter for the int gene expression required for the prophage integration, as well as the pAQ promoter for the antisense RNA that inhibits the synthesis of the Q protein required for late lytic gene expression. Thus, increased activity of CII leads to preferential lysogenization.It is known that the intracellular concentration of CII is controlled at the levels of not only transcription but also protein stability. CII is short-lived, having a half-life of about 2 min in λ-infected wild-type cells (2Gottesman S. Gottesman M. Shaw J.E. Pearson M.L.

The mutation first isolated by Belfort and Wulff (4Belfort M. Wulff D.L. Hershey A.D. The Bacteriophage Lambda.

Genetics. 1974; 77: 435-448PubMed Google Scholar) were mapped at the hflA locus of the chromosome, which was later shown to comprise three genes, hflX,hflK, and hflC (6Noble J.A.

The hflA mutations affect either hflK or hflC (7Banuett F. Herskowitz I. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 4076-4085Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Kihara A. Ito K. J. Biol.

Both HflK and HflC have a signal-anchor sequence at the N terminus, which is followed by the main body of protein exposed to the periplasmic space (8Kihara A. Ito K. J. Biol.

FtsH is a zinc metalloprotease, which is membrane-bound and ATP-dependent (reviewed in Ref. 16Schumann W. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1999; 23: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Its cytoplasmic domain includes an evolutionarily conserved AAA ATPase domain (reviewed in Ref. 17Neuwald A.F. Aravind L. Spouge J.L. Koonin E.V. Genome Res. 1999; 9: 27-43Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteolytic substrates of this enzyme include both soluble and membrane proteins. The actions of FtsH against soluble and membrane-bound substrates are differentially affected by the HflKC complex (18Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Some substrates may require additional factors for optimal proteolysis. For instance, ς32 requires the DnaK chaperone for its degradation in vivo (19Tilly K. Spence J. Georgopoulos C. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 1585-1589Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, FtsH may be subject to modulation by multiple factors that interact either with the substrates or FtsH itself. In this study, we addressed the question of whether any additional host factors exist that affect the λ CII protein with respect to its stability or function. A new factor, termed HflD, was thus identified as a negative regulator of λ lysogenization. HflD is a peripheral membrane protein, which interacts with CII. It is positively required for the degradation of CII in vivo. We propose that HflD holds CII on the membrane surface, away from the target promoters but close to FtsH.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmidspKH198 and pKH191 carry ftsH andhflK-hflC, respectively, under the lac promoter (11Kihara A.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Tetracycline-resistant mutants (which appeared at a frequency of ∼4 × 10−4) were selected on L-tetracycline medium (12.5 μg/ml)-agar (23Davis R.W. Bostein D. Roth J.R. Advanced Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1980Google Scholar) at 37 °C. From four independently mutagenized pools, we saved a total of 15 mutants that were Hfl. We isolated a transposon insertion namedzcg-2002::Tn5 that was co-transducible with the hflD33 mutation at about 50%, by a combination of random Tn5 transposition and P1 transduction (18Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 175-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Using this transposon, each hflD mutation was introduced into strain AD16 by P1 transduction. The isogenic strains thus constructed were AK2035 (hflD33), AK2036 (hflD11), AK2037 (hflD13), AK2038 (hflD24), AK2039 (hflD28), AK2040 (hflD45), AK2041 (hflD48), and AK2033 (hflD +).Construction of the hflD::tet StrainA blunt-ended 1.5-kb XbaI-AvaI tetfragment of pACYC184 was inserted into hflD(BseRI site) within the 7.2-kb SalI fragment, originally from pKH422 but now on pTWV228 (this plasmid was named pKH443). The 7.4-kb PvuII-XhoI fragment of pKH443 was then introduced into FS1576 (recD −; Ref.24Stahl F.W. Kobayashi I. Thaler D. Stahl M.M.

One of them was confirmed for the disrupted hflDgene by polymerase chain reaction, and itshflD::tet marker was P1-transduced into AD16, yielding AK2149.E. coli Two-hybrid Assay (25Karimova G.

After washing, bound proteins were eluted with 20 mm reduced glutathione in 100 mm Hepes·NaOH (pH 8.0) containing 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm DTT. GST-HflD was then treated with bovine plasma thrombin (1 mg/ml, Sigma) at 4 °C for 10 h, and the products were purified by a Mono S HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with washing with 50 mm Hepes·NaOH (pH 8.0) containing 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mmDTT and elution with 0–1 m NaCl gradient in the same buffer.Purification of the CII ProteinStrain BL21(DE3) (27Studier F.W.

Soluble fractions in 50 mm Hepes·NaOH (pH 8.0) containing 10% glycerol, 1 m NaCl, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol were applied to a Ni-NTA-agarose column, washed, and eluted with 50 mm Hepes·NaOH (pH 8.0) containing 10% glycerol, 200 mm NaCl, 250 mmimidazole, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol.

The sample was finally purified by a Mono S HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with elution with 100–500 mm NaCl gradient in the same buffer.Other Methods and MaterialsHfl phenotypes were assessed by measuring lysogenization frequency of λ+ (12Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5544-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) as well as by examining bacterial growth after infection with λc17 phage (12Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5544-5549Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Transduction using P1vir was done by the established procedures (22Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation (28Taura T. Baba T. Akiyama Y. Ito K. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7771-7775Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), immunoblotting (8Kihara A. Ito K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29770-29775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), and cross-linking (11Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6122-6131Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) were done essentially as described previously. Rabbit antiserum against HflD was prepared using a synthetic peptide for residues 76–91 and affinity-purified using the immobilized peptide. Anti-CII serum was prepared using a synthetic peptide for residues 77–93. Antisera against a proton-ATPase subunit, F0 a (29Futai M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Annu. Rev.

Chem. 1994; 269: 5218-5224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were described previously.RESULTSIsolation of a New Class of Mutations that Elevates CII-dependent TranscriptionIn the original mutant isolation, only one hfl allele (hflB29) was isolated at the hflB locus (4Belfort M. Wulff D.L. Hershey A.D. The Bacteriophage Lambda. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1971: 739-742Google Scholar, 5Gautsch J.W. Wulff D.L. Genetics. 1974; 77: 435-448PubMed Google Scholar), raising a question as to whether genes involved in λ lysogenization control have been all identified. We revisited this question using a “modernized” approach. A plasmid (pKH394) was constructed in which the tetracycline resistance gene (tet) was placed under the control of a CII-controlled promoter, pI (Fig.1 A). This plasmid also contained the cII gene itself and the lacZαgene, which are expressed by read-through transcription from the chloramphenicol resistance gene (cat). The cIIgene contained the silent cy42 base substitution (31Wulff D.L. Beher M. Izumi S. Beck J. Mahoney M. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 209-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), which reduces the CII binding to the reverse-oriented pRE promoter withincII (32Kobayashi T. Kishigami S. Sone M. Inokuchi H. Mogi T. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Adad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11857-11862Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), thus minimizing complication due to the presence of two CII-responding promoters of different orientations. Model experiments showed that thezgj-525::IS1A mutation, which reduces the expression level of ftsH (21Kihara A. Akiyama Y. Ito K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4532-4536Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), indeed conferred tetracycline resistance to the pKH394-bearing cells (Fig.1 B).To isolate a new class of hfl mutations, pKH394 was introduced into mutagenized cells, and tetracycline-resistant mutants were selected. Among 15 mutants, three had mutations at 69 min, whereftsH is located, and five had mutations at 95 min, wherehflK-hflC are located. The remaining seven mutations, named hflD33, hflD11,hflD13, hflD24, hflD28,hflD45, and hflD48, were examined further. After mutant cells had been cured of the plasmids, they were examined for an Hfl phenotype. They indeed failed to support growth of λc17 mutant phage (14Banuett F. Hoyt M.A. McFarlane L. Echols H. Herskowitz I. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 187: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar).Identification of hflDTo map one of the mutations,hflD33, we isolated a Tn5 insertion (termedzcg-2002::Tn5) that was P1 co-transducible with hflD33 at a frequency of about 50% (Fig. 2). We then cloned a chromosomal segment together with the kan region of the Tn5insertion. Sequence analysis of one such plasmid (pKH402) showed that the Tn5 insertion was located at 26.2 min on the E. coli genome. In P1 transduction,zcg-2002::Tn5 was co-transducible withdsbB::cat (located at 26.6 min; 32) at a frequency of about 40%, but hflD33 was not. Thus, the order ofhflD33-zcg-2002::Tn5-dsbBwas suggested. Although some E. coli K-12 strains possess a defective prophage e14 (33Brody H. Hill C.W. J. Bacteriol. 1988; 170: 2040-2044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in this chromosomal region (Fig. 2), the strains we used in this study did not contain e14 (data not shown).The clone 7F9 of the E. coli genomic library (34Kohara Y. Akiyama K. Isono K. Cell. 1987; 50: 495-508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar) covers this region, from which we subcloned several DNA fragments intolac promoter vectors (Fig. 2). pKH422, pKH428, and pKH429 complemented the hflD33 mutant, allowing the growth of λc17. pKH429 carried ycfC/orf-23(GenBankTM accession number X59307; Ref. 35Green S.M. Malik T. Giles I.G. Drabble W.T. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 3219-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) as the sole intact chromosomal gene, which we designated hflDhereafter (Fig. 2). The complementation ability of pKH429 was IPTG-dependent. In contrast, pKH422 and pKH428 complementedhflD33 IPTG independently. It was suggested then thattrmU, hflD, and purB comprise a single transcription unit (35Green S.M. Malik T. Giles I.G. Drabble W.T. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 3219-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).The remaining six hfl mutations also proved to be P1 co-transducible with zcg-2002::Tn5. We determined the nucleotide sequence for each of the mutanthflD genes (Table I). Four of them (hflD24, hflD28, hflD45, and hflD48) contained a non-sense mutation, whereas two (hflD33 and hflD11) contained a missense mutation within the hflD open reading frame. The remaining mutant (hflD13) had a base change in the putative Shine-Dalgarno sequence for hflD. We thus identifiedhflD as a new gene affecting the CII function of bacteriophage λ.Table Ihfl gene status and lysogenization frequency of λStrainRelevant genotypehflD base changeHflD amino acid changeλ+ Lysogenization frequency%Exp.

Open table in a new tab HflD Down-regulates λ LysogenizationThe hflDgene is expected to encode a protein of 213 amino acids (35Green S.M. Malik T. Giles I.G. Drabble W.T. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 3219-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Its homologs exist in several bacterial species including Hemophilus influenzae, Vivrio cholerae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (GenBankTM accession numbers, respectively, I64155, B82237, and D83317). No physiological role has been assigned for this dispensable gene (35Green S.M. Malik T. Giles I.G. Drabble W.T. Microbiology. 1996; 142: 3219-3230Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We also constructed a strain in which chromosomal hflD was disrupted bytet. No obvious growth phenotype was observed for any of thehflD mutants without λ infection. Four non-sense (hflD24, hflD28, hflD45, andhflD48) and one missense (hflD33) mutation as well as the tet disruption of hflD increased the lysogenization frequency of λ by 25–50-fold (Table I, Experiment I), whereas zgi-525::IS1Adid so by about 100-fold (Table I, Experiment II). One missense mutation (hflD11) and the noncoding region mutation (hflD13) gave ∼5-fold increases in the lysogenization frequency. When hflD was overexpressed from a plasmid in a wild-type strain, the λ lysogenization frequency was lowered by 10-fold (Table I, Exp. III). These results indicate that thehflD gene product actively participates in keeping the lysogenization frequency low.We then examined whether overexpression of hflD could suppress the Hfl phenotypes associated with other classes ofhfl mutations. When a plasmid overexpressing hflD15–30-fold was introduced into thehflD::tet, thezgj-525::IS1A and theΔhflK-hflC::kan strains, these bacteria were converted to be completely sensitive to λc17 (data not shown). Thus, HflD overproduction channels the cell to a more lysis-oriented status.Identification of the HflD Protein and Its Peripheral Association with the MembraneThe wild-type and the mutant hflDgenes were expressed in the hflD::tetstrain, and their products were examined by immunoblotting, using antiserum against an HflD synthetic peptide. A protein with an apparent molecular mass of 23 kDa was detected for the wild-type gene (Fig.3 A, lane 1). This product was missing for the non-sense mutants (Fig. 3 A,lanes 4, 5, and 8) except forhflD45, which produced a smaller fragment (Fig.3 A, lane 7). The hflD33 missense mutation also gave a band of faster electrophoretic mobility (Fig.3 A, lane 6), suggesting its instability. ThehflD13 mutation markedly lowered the expression level of HflD (Fig. 3 A, lane 2), consistent with a lowered translation initiation. In wild-type cells without plasmid, HflD was detected as a faint band at the 23-kDa position (data not shown).Figure 3Identification and cellular localization of HflD.

Only very recently, the Int/attP site-specific recombination system from λ phage has proven to work successfully in plants (9Zubko E. Scutt C. Meyer P. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 442-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Moreover, there are relatively few reports on the combined use of these systems (10Meyers E.N. Lewandoski M. Martin G.R. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). It thus becomes important to study and characterize other site-specific recombination systems (SSR)1that could be used as an alternative to or in combination with existing ones. %-Recombinase from the Gram-positive plasmid pSM19035 induces specific intramolecular recombination in mammalian cells, both in episomal plasmids and in chromatin-associated substrate structures (11Diaz V. Rojo F. Martinez A.C. Alonso J.C. Bernad A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6634-6640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Plasmid pSM19035 has an unusual structure, because almost 80% of the molecule consists of a repeated sequence and two replication origins (12Rojo F. Weise F. Alonso J.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 328: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because replication of this plasmid follows the classical theta model, a mechanism must exist to ensure its complete replication (inversion) and maximization of plasmid segregation (resolution). The development of an in vitro recombination system based on the use of purified %-recombinase demonstrated both inversion and deletion activities associated to the protein (13Rojo F. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), delimited the sequences required for directing the SSR reactions (13Rojo F. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 14Rojo F. Alonso J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3181-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and characterized the requirements for both reactions (13Rojo F. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Unlike Cre and Flp, which belong to the Int recombinase family, %-recombinase is included in the family of resolvases/invertases and has the interesting property of catalyzing exclusively intramolecular recombination events (13Rojo F. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Alonso J.C. Weise F. Rojo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2938-2945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). At difference from Cre and Flp site-specific recombinases, which do not require additional factors (reviewed in Refs. 16Kilby N.J. Snaith M.R. Murray J.A. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 413-421Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar and 17Landy A. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1993; 3: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), %-recombinase requires for deletions a supercoiled substrate and a chromatin-associated protein (e.g. bacterial Hbsu or eukaryotic HMG1 proteins) (14Rojo F. Alonso J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3181-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 15Alonso J.C. Weise F. Rojo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2938-2945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18Alonso J.C. Gutierrez C. Rojo F. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). We showed previously that the mammalian cell environment can provide such a host factor and that nuclear genomic DNA supercoiling is suitable for %-recombinase function (11Diaz V. Rojo F. Martinez A.C. Alonso J.C. Bernad A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6634-6640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To obtain additional insights regarding %-recombinase system application for the manipulation of eukaryotic genomes, we have developed a recombination-activated gene expression (RAGE) system dependent on %-recombinase activity that consists of thelacZ reporter gene separated from the promoter by thepac gene flanked (sixed) by two minimalsix sites (19Canosa I. Rojo F. Alonso J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2712-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) in direct orientation, equivalent to those described for other models (1Metzger D. Feil R. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1999; 10: 470-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 2Sauer B. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 521-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 3Sauer B. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 890-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 20Pichel J.G. Lakso M. Westphal H. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3333-3342PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we have also obtained and characterized a novel hybrid protein, composed of %-recombinase fused through its C-terminal end to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) from Aequorea victoria. As for the Cre-loxP system (21Gagneten S. Le Y. Miller J. Sauer B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3326-3331Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), combination of these two approaches results in a simple, rapid way to enrich cell clones that have undergone the desired recombination event after %-EGFP transient expression, using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). This approach may be suitable for increasing the efficiency of locus-specific recombination events during the generation of mouse conditional knock-out approaches or for the deletion of the positive selection cassette in mouse conventional knock-out models, which might alter or influence the final phenotype (10Meyers E.N. Lewandoski M. Martin G.R. Nat. Genet. 1998; 18: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar, 22Hogan B. Costantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1986Google Scholar). Using these novel approaches we have studied the host protein factor requirement for %-recombinase protein in mammalian cells. In previous works, several proteins were demonstrated to replace in vitro the chromatin-associated factor required by %-recombinase reaction (15Alonso J.C. Weise F. Rojo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2938-2945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18Alonso J.C. Gutierrez C. Rojo F. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). More precisely, histone-like proteins Hbsu and HU can efficiently contribute to the recombination process. The identity of this host factor in eukaryotic environments is still unknown, although different HMG1-like proteins of mammalian and plant origin have the ability to facilitate the formation of nucleoprotein structures to different extents, because they can efficiently replace a bacterial chromatin-associated protein required for the site-specific %-mediated recombination (15Alonso J.C. Weise F. Rojo F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2938-2945Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 18Alonso J.C. Gutierrez C. Rojo F. Mol.

HMG1/2, which are abundant components of the eukaryotic nucleus, bind any linear DNA with moderate affinity and no sequence specificity (25Bianchi M.E. Beltrame M. Paonessa G. Science. 1989; 243: 1056-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar) but bind with high affinity to DNA that is already sharply bent (26Travers A.A. Ner S.S. Churchill M.E. Cell. 1994; 77: 167-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 27Ura K. Nightingale K. Wolffe A.P.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar); thus they are considered structural chromatin proteins expressed in all eukaryotic cell types. However, recent evidences have demonstrated that HMG1/2 are also recruited to DNA by interactions with proteins required for basal and regulated transcription (29Shykind B.M. Kim J. Sharp P.A. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1354-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 30Sutrias-Grau M. Bianchi M.E. Bernues J. J. Biol.

Falciola L. Citterich M.H. Mavilio F. Bianchi M.E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4981-4991Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and for SSR machinery, as the RAG/V(D)J recombination system (reviewed in Ref. 35Fugmann S.D. Lee A.I. Shockett P.E. Villey I.J. Schatz D.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 495-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar), the major determinant for diversity generation of antibody and T-cell receptor. These novel data strongly suggest an additional role as expression regulator of specific gene families or physiological molecular events mediated by the recombination machinery (36Calogero S. Grassi F. Aguzzi A. Voigtlander T. Ferrier P. Ferrari S. Bianchi M.E. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Therefore, HMG1 and other closely related mammalian proteins (i.e. HMG2 and HMG4) are potential candidates to act as host factors in %-recombinase reactions in mammalian cells, although HMG2 is expressed at a much lower level than HMG1 (37Bustin M. Reeves R. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1996; 54: 35-100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and HMG4 is almost exclusively expressed during embryonic stages of development (38Vaccari T. Beltrame M. Ferrari S. Bianchi M.E. Genomics. 1998; 49: 247-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Here we show that overexpression of HMG1 does not induce a significant enhancement on %-mediated recombination both on episomal plasmid-based targets or chromatin-integrated constructs. Furthermore, %-mediated recombination is efficiently performed in a HMG1 knock-out cell line. These data clearly suggest that in eukaryotic environments there are other chromatin-associated proteins that could act as helpers in %-mediated reactions, and therefore it is expected that those reactions could occur in most cell types and tissues. In conclusion, the results presented highly support the future usefulness of the %/six system as a new tool for conditional modification of eukaryotic genomes. Plasmids pBT233 and pCB103 have been previously described (12Rojo F. Weise F. Alonso J.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 328: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 19Canosa I. Rojo F. Alonso J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2712-2717Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Plasmids pEGFP-N1, p%gal-Basic and pPur (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), and pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI) were from commercial sources. Plasmid pHMG1 (36Calogero S. Grassi F. Aguzzi A. Voigtlander T. Ferrier P. Ferrari S. Bianchi M.E. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. M. Bianchi (Milan, Italy). To fuse the %-recombinase gene to EGFP in the pEGFP-N1 vector, we introduced appropriate 5′ HindIII and 3′ EcoRI sites on the % gene from pBT233. Using primers %Hind5 (5′-GAGAGAAAGCTTGGTTGAAAATGGCT-3′) and %Eco3C (5′-ACTATCCCTCTTTCCC-3′), we performed PCR amplification (30 cycles at 94 °C 1 min, 48 °C 1 min, 72 °C 1 min, followed by one cycle of elongation at 72 °C 5 min). The 635-bp amplification product was joined to HindIII/EcoRI-digested pEGFP-N1 following standard cloning procedures. The resulting plasmid, p%-EGFP, was purified for transfection experiments with Qiagen columns. For recombination-activated gene expression, we designed a set of three vectors that were obtained as follows. A 93-bp sixsite was obtained by PCR amplification from pCB103, for which we used the pUC reverse primer and a primer containing a novelSmaI/XmaI site needed for further cloning which we called 103M (5′-CAGTGCCAAGCTTCCCGGGCTGCAGG-3′). The amplified product was purified and cloned using the pGEM-T Easy system, giving rise to the pGEM-T/103M plasmid. This was digested with KpnI and HindIII, and the resulting fragment containing thesix site was cloned in the same restriction sites of the p%gal-Basic vector, resulting in the psixgal vector containing thelacZ gene downstream of a six site. TheBamHI fragment containing the six-lacZ cassette from this vector was cloned in pPur vector (CLONTECH), resulting in the pPursixgal plasmid, the negative control vector used in all experiments (see Fig.2 A). The last six site was obtained from psixgal by digestion with XmaI and cloned in the AgeI site from pPursixgal to obtain Recombiner, the substrate for recombination used in this study (see Fig. 2 A). The pgal vector (positive control) was obtained by in vitrorecombination essentially as described (12Rojo F. Weise F. Alonso J.C. FEBS Lett. 1993; 328: 169-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 13Rojo F. Alonso J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 238: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), using 1 μg ofRecombiner as substrate, 320 nm purified %-recombinase, and 100 nm Hbsu. The resulting reaction was digested with SacII, which only cuts inRecombiner molecules but not in pgal. Transformation of this restriction reaction rendered pgal containing bacterial colonies for further purification of this plasmid. For retroviral transduction of the HMG1-defective cell line, the %-EGFP open reading frame from p%-EGFP plasmid was cloned in pLZR-CMV-GFP retroviral vector (39Yang S. Delgado R. King S.R. Woffendin C. Barker C.S. Yang Z.Y. Xu L. Nolan G.P. Nabel G.J. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) upon digestion withBamHI and NotI restriction enzymes and subsequent ligation. The resulting plasmid, pLZR-%-EGFP, was further packaged in retroviral particles as described below. NIH/3T3 cell line was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL-1658). 293T cells were originally called 293tsA1609ne (40DuBridge R.B. Tang P. Hsia H.C. Leong P.M. Miller J.H. Calos M.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) and derived from 293 cells, which are a human embryonic kidney cell line. HMG1 KO and wt counterpart cell lines were a gift from Dr. M. Bianchi (36Calogero S. Grassi F. Aguzzi A. Voigtlander T. Ferrier P. Ferrari S. Bianchi M.E. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). All cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Cultek, Madrid, Spain) and 2 mml-glutamine (Merck). To obtain stable transformants of the %-EGFP fusion or the recombination activable Recombiner construct, plasmid DNA (20 μg) was introduced in NIH/3T3 cells by electroporation of 2 × 106 cells at a concentration of 107 cells/ml in supplemented Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, pulsed at 220 V, 950 microfarads (Bio-Rad Gene Pulser). Cells were replated, and after 48 h of further culture, selection antibiotics were added to the medium. For selection of stable clones bearing the %-EGFP fusion construct we used 1 mg/ml G418, and for the Recombinerconstruct, 2 μg/ml puromycin. Clones were collected and analyzed 10–15 days after electroporation. Transient transfection was done in all cases using Superfect reagent (Qiagen), according to manufacturer's instructions. FACS analysis and %-Gal detection were performed 48 h after transfection. Packaging of pLZR-%-EGFP retroviral vector was performed transiently in 293T as described (39Yang S. Delgado R. King S.R. Woffendin C. Barker C.S. Yang Z.Y. Xu L. Nolan G.P. Nabel G.J. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Viral supernatants were titrated on NIH-3T3 cells on the basis of GFP fluorescence. 35–40 TU/cell were used to transduce both HMG1-defective cells and the corresponding +/+ control cell line. Cells expressing %-EGFP protein were purified by sorting and recultured for transfection with Recombiner construct. Plasmidic DNA fraction was purified for PCR analysis 48 h after transfection using Qiagen miniprep purification kit. In vivoexpression of %-EGFP fusion was easily detected by direct observation of cultures in a phase-contrast microscope equipped with a fluorescent lamp and blue filter. Indirect immunostaining was performed after fixing cells with 3% formaldehyde, 5% Triton X-100 for 20 min at room temperature. Blocking was performed with 100 mmNH4Cl in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min. Anti-%-recombinase rabbit antibody (11Diaz V. Rojo F. Martinez A.C. Alonso J.C. Bernad A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6634-6640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) was used at a 1:500 dilution. Secondary Cy3-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) antibody was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and used at 1:400 dilution. For Hoechst 33258 staining, cells were incubated with 0.8 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 5 min, immediately after second antibody incubation. Samples were mounted and analyzed using a Leitz DMINB epifluorescence microscope and a Leica TCSNT confocal scanning microscope. Images were noise-filtered, corrected for background, and processed using Adobe Photoshop. FACS analysis using an EPICS Elite sorter was performed on transfected cells that were trypsin-treated, centrifuged, and resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Once isolated, each population was recultured in 100-mm dishes with antibiotics, which were eliminated after 2 days. Isolated clones normally appeared 7–10 days post-sorting. Isolated clones were harvested from 24-well plates when they reached confluence, resuspended in 1× PCR buffer with MgCl2 containing 0.5% Tween-20 and 100 μg/ml proteinase K and incubated 45 min at 56 °C. Proteinase K was heat inactivated (10 min, 95 °C) and 1/10 of the resulting reaction was used for PCR detection in a Perkin Elmer thermocycler under the following conditions: 94 °C, 5 min; 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and final elongation at 72 °C for 5 min. Primers used for PCR detection were sixUP (5′-GCCCAGTTCCGCCCATTCTC-3′) and sixDO (5′-CCAGACCGGCAACGAAAATC-3′). Although in the unrecombined substrate a 1.5-kb product could be obtained, our PCR protocol was optimized for the exclusive amplification of the recombination-diagnostic product corresponding to a 0.4-kb band, which must result specifically from the presence of recombined molecules. For normalization of PCR reactions, an internal (351 bp) fragment of the LacZ gene was amplified, using the following primers: lacZ-1 (5′-GTGGTGGTTATGCCGATCG-3′) and lacZ-2 (5′-TACCACAGCGGATGGTTCGG-3′). The reaction conditions were the same as described for sixUP and sixDO primers. Detection of THS% gene as internal template loading control was performed using primers THS%UP (5′-TCCTCAAAGATGCTCATTAG-3′) and THS%LO (5′-GTAACTCACTCATGCAAAGT-3′) under the following conditions: 94 °C for 2 min and 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s, and final elongation at 72 °C for 5 min. Quantitative PCR was performed on a LightCyclerTM system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Samples were amplified during 40 cycles in the same conditions described above, adding SYBR green dye to the reaction. The amount of recombination product (template for sixUP/sixDO primers) was calculated using a duplicate standard curve of 10-fold dilutions of the pgal plasmid, and the results were normalized after subtracting the nontemplate control, by the amount of total lacZ template (see above). Three independent transfection experiments were analyzed, and for each one, at least four amplification reactions were performed. Southern analysis of PCR products was performed by blotting DNA separated on agarose gels onto nylon membranes (Hybond-N+; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Filters were hybridized at 65 °C in Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), using supplier's recommendations. Southern analysis of genomic DNA was performed after overnight digestion with EcoRV and StuI (Roche) of 10 μg of genomic DNA obtained following standard procedures (41Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and subsequent agarose gel separation and blotting. The specific probe for hybridization was obtained by digestion ofRecombiner with ClaI and EcoRV and purification of the resulting 289-bp DNA fragment. Probes were radiolabeled using the Rediprime kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA from transfected cells was extracted using Tri-Reagent (Sigma) using conditions recommended by supplier. 1 μg from each condition was treated with RNase-free DNase (Promega) to avoid contamination from genomic and/or plasmid DNA from the transfection. RT reaction was performed using Superscript II RT kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the supplier conditions. HMG1 cDNA detection was detected by PCR using the specific primers HMG1RTUP (5′-CCTCGCGGAAAATCAAC-3′) and HMG1RTLO (5′-CAAAAACCAAACTACTGTCC-3′). PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 4 min and 25 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and final elongation at 72 °C for 5 min. Loading controls were performed upon detection of GAPDH gene under the same conditions, using the primers GAPDH5′ (5′-CATCACCATCTTCCAGGAGC-3′) and GAPDH3′ (5′-CATGAGTCCTTCCACGATACC-3′). Total RNA from transiently transfected cells was extracted using Tri-Reagent (Sigma), according manufacturer's instructions, and 40 μg from each condition were loaded on agarose gels (1× MOPS, 37% paraformaldehyde). Once separated electrophoretically, the RNAs were transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond-N+, Amersham). Blotting and labeling of the specific probe was performed as for Southern hybridizations. Cells transfected in 35-mm dishes were harvested after 48 h. Proteins were extracted using the luminescent %-Gal detection kit from CLONTECH. Total protein was quantified, and equal amounts of each extract were analyzed. Luminescence was measured in a scintillation counter (Wallac, EG&G Instruments, Madrid, Spain). The %-recombinase open reading frame was cloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector to fuse this gene with the 5′ end of the EGFP gene. The resulting p%-EGFP plasmid was transiently transfected in NIH/3T3 cells. In contrast to transfections with pEGFP-N1, fluorescence microscopy showed a nucleus-restricted pattern in the transfected cells (Fig.1 A). This nuclear signal was observed more clearly using confocal microscopy (Fig. 1 B). The nuclear pattern is not homogeneous, because %-EGFP recombinase localizes in heterochromatin regions. This compartmentalization was confirmed by counterstaining other gene products that localize in these regions (not shown). Furthermore, living mitotic cells expressing the fusion protein show brighter signals in the centromeric areas of the chromosomes (Fig. 1 B), which have been assigned to heterochromatin (42Lica L.M. Narayanswami S. Hamkalo B.A. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1145-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The %-EGFP signal was confirmed by immunostaining with anti-%-recombinase specific antibodies (not shown). These results confirm and extend our previous observation on the spontaneous subcellular localization of %-recombinase in eukaryotic cells (11Diaz V. Rojo F. Martinez A.C. Alonso J.C. Bernad A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6634-6640Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To assess the feasibility of stable %-EGFP fusion protein expression in living cells, plasmid p%-EGFP was transfected in NIH/3T3 cells, and stable clones were obtained. Different levels of expression of %-EGFP were observed when analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig.1 C, clones B3, D3, and D4) and by cytometry (Fig.1 C, lane 3). We were unable to obtain clones with very high expression levels, suggesting a deleterious effect of either high doses of %-recombinase or EGFP expr"
https://openalex.org/W2161365804,"CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP)-binding motifs have been identified in the promoter regions of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and platelet-derived growth factor-α receptor (PDGFαR). Recently, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) have been suggested to be important immunomodulatory mediators. Although many studies have demonstrated that the interaction between C/EBPs and PPARs plays a central role in lipid metabolism, expression and function of these factors are unknown in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). In the present study, we clarified a functional relationship between C/EBPs and PPARγ in the regulation of IL-1β-induced PDGFαR expression in VSMCs. PPARγ activators, troglitazone and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-prostaglandin J2, inhibited IL-1β-induced PDGFαR expression and suppressed PDGF-induced proliferation activity of VSMCs. Electromobility shift and supershift assays for a C/EBP motif in the PDGFαR promoter region revealed that PPARγ activators suppressed IL-1β-induced DNA binding activity of C/EBPδ and β. PPARγ activators also suppressed IL-1β-induced C/EBPδ expression. In contrast, overexpression of C/EBPδ reversed the suppressive effect of PPARγ activators on PDGFαR expression almost completely. From these results, we conclude that the inhibitory effect of PPARγ activators on PDGFαR expression is mainly mediated by C/EBPδ suppression. Regulation of C/EBPδ by PPARγ activators probably plays critical roles in modulating inflammatory responses in the arterial wall."
https://openalex.org/W2061104266,"CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) ε is a critical transcription factor for differentiation of myeloid cells. Structural and functional relationships of C/EBPε were explored by recombinant protein studies, gene mutation, and transactivation assays. Evidence strongly suggested that C/EBPε does not have disulfide bonds. Transactivation analysis of C/EBPε having mutations of each of three conserved cysteines (C345, C148S, and C280S) indicated that the three mutant proteins had almost the same activity as the wild type. Dimer formation of C/EBPε was not detected using both reducing and non-reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with Western blot analysis from either bacterial or mammalian expressed C/EBPε. Furthermore, C/EBPε mutant C280S gave a gel band similar to that for wild type, suggesting that this C-terminal, conserved cysteine is not involved in disulfide bond formation in vivo, even though previous data for C/EBPβ suggested that dimers may formin vitro utilizing this conserved cysteine residue. Mutational studies of conserved residues in the activating domain 1 (ADM1) and ADM2 of the amino region of the gene indicated that negative charge is critical for transactivational activity of C/EBPε. Mutational analyses of hydrophobic amino acids in ADM1 suggested that these residues do not play a key role in transactivational activity. Further mutational studies indicated that, although the N-terminal 32-amino acid peptide of C/EBPε isoform p32 did not greatly influence the transactivation activity compared with p30 isoform, this peptide does modulate transactivation activity. Domain swapping experiments substituting the ADM1 domain of various C/EBPs for C/EBPε showed that the C/EBPα and -δ but not -β ADM1 markedly enhanced the chimeric C/EBPε transcriptional activity. Based on mutational data and possible mRNA structure, we hypothesized about the effect of mRNA structure on translation of the two major C/EBPε isoforms: p32 and p30. The data suggested a very stable 8-base pair double helical structure with one strand sequence including the initial codon for p32 and complementary strand with the initial codon for p30."
