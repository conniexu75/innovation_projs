This sensitive and specific technique, which measures the primary interaction between DNA and antibody to DNA, is based on the observation that free DNA is soluble in 50-percent saturated ammonium sulfate whereas antibody-bound DNA is insoluble."
https://openalex.org/W1549802820,"Abstract A 10% rat liver homogenate in 0.25 m sucrose-10-3 m ethylenediaminetetraacetate was fractionated into mitochondria, microsomes, and a supernatant fraction. Liver mitochondria derived from rats injected with leucine-3H and with phosphate-32P or with glycerol-14C were incubated with nonlabeled microsomes in the presence of supernatant or of sucrose-EDTA. Labeled microsomes were similarly exposed to nonlabeled mitochondria. 32P or glycerol-14C was used to measure exchange of phospholipid; 3H was used to correct for contamination of mitochondria by microsomes. After 90 min at 37° 30 to 40% of the phospholipid in the particulate fractions had exchanged while at 0° 10% exchange took place. Phosphatidyl choline appeared to exchange to a greater extent than phosphatidyl ethanolamine, whereas cardiolipin of the mitochondrial fraction did not exchange. The extent of exchange was reduced 50 to 60% when sucrose-EDTA was substituted for the supernatant fraction as incubation medium."

The diverticular form of the langur stomach permits a bacterial fermentation of the leafy diet, which results in important contributions to the nutrition of these primates. The demonstration of a ruminant-like digestion in langurs extends the known taxonomic distribution of this digestive adaptation."

https://openalex.org/W1561641325,"Abstract An intensive study of glycosidases in nervous tissue was done. An existing method, utilizing 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-glycosides, was modified to permit the assay of a given glycosidase in as little as 1 µg of nervous tissue. The distribution of β-galactosidase, β-glucuronidase, and β-glucosidase was studied by this method in various discrete regions of the nervous system. The relative distributions of β-galactosidase and β-glucuronidase were the same in cerebellar layers, the granular layer having the highest activity. In contrast, the molecular layer exhibited the greatest activity for β-glucosidase. All three enzymes showed a maximal concentration in the 12,000 and 18,000 x g sediments in sucrose homogenates with only 5 to 10% of their activities in the microsomes and cell sap. β-Galactosidase and β-glucuronidase were 50% soluble in aqueous media, whereas β-glucosidase was less than 10% soluble. The two former enzymes were completely active after homogenization in water, whereas treatment with a detergent almost doubled the total activity of β-glucosidase. The pH optima were lower for β-galactosidase and β-glucuronidase (4.0 in monkey and 3.75 in rat for the former, and 3.3 to 3.75 in both species for the latter) than for β-glucosidase (5.4 in both species). At high inhibitor concentrations each aldonolactone inhibited its corresponding enzyme without affecting the other two, further indicating that in nervous tissue these are at least three separate and distinct enzymes."
https://openalex.org/W1618765077,"Abstract Phosphomannose isomerase isolated from brewers' yeast was found to be inhibited in a time-dependent process by 8-hydroxyquinoline, ethylenediaminetetraacetate, o-phenanthroline, α,α-dipyridyl, cysteine, and dithiothreitol. The effectiveness of these agents in bringing about inhibition paralleled their ability to bind zinc, and the inhibition could be prevented by blocking the coordination sites of the metal-binding agents. An instantaneous reversal of inhibition occurred upon the addition of metals to the EDTA-inhibited enzyme, and the extent of reversal or prevention of inhibition was proportional to the ability of the added metals to form a complex with EDTA. Metal analyses, performed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, yielded a metal content of 1 g atom of zinc per mole of enzyme (molecular weight, 45,000). Other metals were found to be either absent or present only in stoichiometrically insignificant concentrations. From inhibition data and metal analyses before and after inhibition, it is concluded that EDTA forms the inactive apoenzyme by removal of zinc from the active metalloenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1838781226,"Abstract A rapid and selective efflux of 75 to 80% of the intramitochondrial adenine nucleotides (AdN) has been obtained by incubation with 5 mm Mg++ and 10 mm inorganic phosphate in the presence of 1 mm ethylenediaminetetraacetate, with little or no decrease in the P:O ratio, active respiratory state, or size of the pyridine nucleotide pool. The initial rate of AdN efflux is 5 nmoles per mg of protein per min at 30°. The efflux is a linear function of the [Pi] but with increasing [Mg++] exhibits an apparent Km for Mg++ of 0.6 mm with mitochondria incubated in the presence of 0.1 mm EDTA. The rate of efflux of AdN is considerably reduced by respiratory inhibitors and uncouplers, including rotenone-malonate, dinitrophenol, arsenate, and oligomycin, or by an activator of ion transport such as valinomycin. All of these agents cause an increase in the proportion of AMP or ADP, or both, within the mitochondrion. Pi competitively reverses the inhibition of AdN efflux by arsenate and concomitantly increases the proportion of mitochondrial ATP. The Mg++-Pi-induced efflux of AdN can be prevented by adding sufficient exogenous ADP to maintain an intra- to extramitochondrial AdN ratio of about 20. The omission of Mg++ or replacement by 1 mm Ca++ has little effect on the rate of AdN efflux, but lowers markedly the intra- to extramitochondrial AdN equilibrium ratio to 3.1 and 1.6, respectively. Addition of atractyloside to Mg++- and Pi-treated mitochondria completely reverses the inhibitory effect of exogenous ADP on the efflux of AdN, but is without effect on the Ca++-treated mitochondria. It is concluded that the efflux of AdN from rat liver mitochondria under atractyloside sensitive conditions is associated with the AdN translocation site and is selective for ATP, while AMP and probably ADP are inert. The mechanism of action of Pi, Mg++, and EDTA on AdN efflux is presented in terms of their effect on ion transport and mitochondrial integrity."
https://openalex.org/W1533065308,"Abstract The fraction and distribution of DNA complementary to ribosomal RNA and preribosomal RNA was investigated by the technique of molecular hybridization with the DNA of isolated nucleoli and nuclei of rat liver. Nuclear DNA complementary to ribosomal 18 S RNA and 28 S RNA was 0.014% and 0.032%, respectively. Nucleolar DNA complementary to ribosomal 18 S RNA and 28 S RNA was 0.10% and 0.22%, respectively. About 75% of the ribosomal RNA cistrons were contained in the DNA of isolated nucleoli. Nucleolar DNA complementary to nucleolar 28 S RNA, 35 S RNA, 45 S RNA, and 55 S RNA was 0.44%, 0.44%, 0.52%, and 0.53%, respectively. The absence of competition between ribosomal 18 S RNA and 28 S RNA for the DNA of isolated nucleoli and nuclei indicated that there were distinct sequences of DNA complementary to the two ribosomal RNAs. The existence of competition between ribosomal RNAs and preribosomal RNAs for the DNA of isolated nucleoli indicated that the two ribosomal RNAs shared base sequences in common with nucleolar 28 S RNA, 35 S RNA, and 45 S RNA, and suggested that the latter may contain base sequences similar to ribosomal 18 S RNA that are not converted to either of the two ribosomal RNAs. The analyses for the base composition of preribosomal RNAs indicated that the conversion of nucleolar 45 S RNA to nucleolar 28 S RNA was accompanied by a progressive increase in the content of adenine and a decrease in the content of uracil. The nucleolar DNA fraction contained a major band of buoyant density in CsCl of 1.700 g per cm3, a light satellite component of 1.692 g per cm3, and a heavy satellite component of 1.708 g per cm3. The heavy satellite, which comprised 8% of the total nucleolar DNA, contained a major part of the DNA complementary to ribosomal 18 S RNA and nucleolar 28 S RNA, 35 S RNA, and 45 S RNA, and a smaller percentage of the DNA complementary to ribosomal 28 S RNA. The base composition of nucleolar DNA differed from nuclear DNA in a disparity between the content of adenine (30%) and the content of thymine (27%)."

https://openalex.org/W2033999100,"HAND preferences have been recorded for 137 of the 150 monkeys used in behaviour experiments during 1958 to 1968. Eighty-seven of the 137 monkeys, however, were trained to make discriminations only in one sense-modality, or else were insufficiently assessed for hand preferences in two modalities. The following conditions obtain for all the remaining fifty monkeys: (1) no account was taken of an animal's first discrimination task (for which hand preferences tend to be atypical) unless the learning score exceeded five hundred trials; (2) treating the first task as described, discriminations were learnt at least twice in each of two sense-modalities (by thirty-nine monkeys through vision and touch, by eleven through vision and hearing); (3) hand preferences were systematically assessed during criterion performance on at least four training periods, distributed as described. Of the fifty monkeys adequately assessed in two sense-modalities thirty-eight preferred the same hand in both modalities, and (discounting the first task) eight changed preference within one or both modalities. The remaining four animals (that is, 8 per cent) showed regular alternations of preferences with change of modality from touch to vision. These alternations were to some extent transient in two, but have persisted unchanged in the other two monkeys."
https://openalex.org/W1533228207,"Abstract A mutant of Bacillus megaterium has been obtained which lacks the enzyme that condenses pyruvate and aspartic semialdehyde to form dihydrodipicolinate. The effect of the mutation is pleiotropic. In addition to manifesting a requirement for diaminopimelate and lysine, the organism is unable to make dipicolinate and cannot sporulate. Dipicolinate added to cultures of the mutant restores the ability to produce heat-stable refractile spores. It is concluded that the same isomer of dihydrodipicolinate participates in both dipicolinate and lysine biosynthesis. Further, the enzyme that produces dihydrodipicolinate during vegetative growth also functions as the source of this compound for dipicolinate synthesis during sporulation."
https://openalex.org/W1546158790,"Abstract An average of 17% of rabbit reticulocyte ribosomes are closely bound to the cell membrane. Evidence is presented to indicate that membrane binding of reticulocyte ribosomes is not an artifact. Membrane-bound reticulocyte ribosomes differ in physical and chemical properties from free reticulocyte ribosomes in having a high coefficient of sedimentation (greater than 400 S) and a high protein to RNA ratio (greater than 5:1) and in being relatively resistant to breakdown by deoxycholate. The protein to RNA ratio of the rapidly sedimenting ribonucleoprotein aggregates varies with the degree of maturity of the cell, being greatest in older cells. Membrane-bound ribosomes are active in protein synthesis both in the intact cell and the cell-free system, but the degree of activity is less than that of free ribosomes. Their susceptibility to inhibitors of protein synthesis, such as puromycin, 10-3 m, or sodium fluoride, 10-2 m, is less than that of free ribosomes. Membrane-bound ribosomes do not break down to subunits after exposure to EDTA, and are relatively resistant to degradation by pancreatic ribonuclease. Binding to the cell membrane is not dependent upon magnesium ion concentration, an RNA component susceptible to ribonuclease action or the presence of peptidyl-transfer RNA on the ribosomes. The data suggest that membrane binding of reticulocyte ribosomes may be involved in the mechanism of ribosomal degradation in the erythroid cell."

https://openalex.org/W184703344,"Abstract A modification of the analytical method employing the appropriate 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-glycoside as substrate and measuring the fluorescence of the 4-methylumbelliferone freed by hydrolysis permitted the measurement of β-galactosidase, β-glucuronidase, and β-glucosidase in individual anterior horn cell bodies, in individual dorsal ganglion cell bodies, and in pieces of anterior horn neuropil approximately equivalent in weight (0.01 µg) to one individual cell body. Incubation for 18 hours was necessary to measure the two latter enzymes in a single cell, whereas it was necessary to incubate β-galactosidase for only 4 hours because of its higher activity. When incubation was for 18 hours, the fall-off of activity for β-glucuronidase was negligible, but for β-galactosidase the fall-off in activity was about 57%. The results for β-glucosidase were somewhat anomalous in that the fall-off activity with time for cerebellar molecular layer was very different (over 10-fold) from the fall-off for nerve cells, neuropil, or other cerebellar layers (average of 2.5-fold). The concentration of each of these three enzymes was extremely rich in nerve cell bodies when compared with the neuropil in the cord, varying from 14- to 27-fold for dorsal ganglion cell bodies, and from 8- to 10-fold for anterior horn cell bodies. These results contrast strikingly with those found by others and ourselves in which levels of carbohydrate-metabolizing enzymes, glutamate-metabolizing enzymes, and a dipeptidase in nerve cell bodies were found to be equal to or lower than the levels in neuropil and in other parts of the nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W1533742690,"Abstract Chymotrypsin, trypsin, and Novo and Carlsberg subtilisins undergo a reversible, time-dependent inhibition by phenylarsonates. The inhibition of these enzymes by p-nitro-, p-tolyl-, p-aminophenyl-, and phenylarsonate was studied in detail, as a function of pH and inhibitor concentration, by a variety of approaches. Ki values were determined for the inhibition of chymotrypsin and the subtilisins by these compounds. Active site titrations and dye displacement experiments were used to show that the inhibition results from the interaction of the arsenicals with the active sites of these enzymes. The pH dependence of the inhibition of both chymotrypsin and the subtilisins followed the theoretical curve for the protonation of a group on the enzymes with a pK' value of 7.15. The results obtained in this study, taken in conjunction with earlier scattered reports in the literature, suggest that the phenylarsonates are general inhibitors of serine esterases. Possible mechanisms for such inhibition are discussed."
