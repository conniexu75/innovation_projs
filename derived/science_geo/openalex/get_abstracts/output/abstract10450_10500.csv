https://openalex.org/W2069573006,"Using the poly(dA-dT) ""connector"" method (Lobbanand Kaiser, 1973), a population of annealed hybrid circular DNAs was constructed in vitro; each hybrid DNA circle contained one molecule of poly(dT)-tailed Col El-DNA (LRI) annealed to any one of a collection of poly(dA)-tailed linear DNA fragments, produced originally by shearing total E. coli DNA to an average size of 8.5 x 10(6) daltons. This annealed DNA preparation (12 mug) was used to transform an F+ recA E. coli strain (JA200), selecting transformants by their resistance to colicin El. A collection or ""bank"" pf pver 2000 colicin El-resistant clones was thereby obtained, 70% of which were shown to contain hybrid Col El DNA (E. coli) plasmids. This colony bank is large enough to include hybrid plasmids representative of the entire E. coli genome. Individual plasmids have been readily identified by replica mating the collection onto plates seeded with cultures of various F- auxotrophic recipients, selecting for complementation of the auxotrophic markers by F-mediated transfer of hybrid plasmids to the F- recipients. In this manner, over 80 hybrid Col El-DNA (E. coli), plasmid-bearing clones have been identified in the colony bank, and about 40 known E. coli genes have been tentatively assigned to these various plasmids. The hybrid plasmids are transferred efficiently from F+ donors to appropriate F- recipients. The use of this method to establish similar colony banks in E. coli containing hybrid plasmids representative of various simple eucaryotic genomes is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2092221199,"In this article, we have described various detailed features of the conformation of yeast tRNA(Phe) revealed by recent refinement analysis of x-ray diffraction data at 2.5 A resolution. The gross features of the molecule observed in the unrefined version have been largely confirmed and a number of new features found. The unique role of the ribose 2' hydroxyl groups in maintaining a series of nonhelical conformations in this RNA molecule has become apparent. Many of these features are a direct consequence of the geometry of the ribose phosphate backbone of RNA molecules, and these may also be found in structured regions of other RNA species as well. Special attention has been directed toward two conformational motifs revealed by this analysis. These include the striking similarity between the TpsiC and anticodon hairpin turns in the polynucleotide chain, which are stabilized by the participation of uridine in the U turn. In addition, there is frequent occurrence of an arch conformation in the polynucleotide chian which is stabilized by hydrogen bonds from 2' hydroxyl residues to phosphate groups across the base of the arch. The importance of the 2' hydroxyl interactions in defining tertiary structure is illustrated by the fact that, in the nonhelical regions, almost half of the ribose residues are involved in O2' hydrogen-bonding interactions which stabilize the conformation of the molecule."

https://openalex.org/W1991080184,"The mechanism of action of botulinum toxin was analyzed by the use of calcium ionophores and black widow spider venom. Addition of calcium ionophores to nerve-muscle preparations blocked by botulinum toxin did not increase the frequency of miniature end plate potentials. However, the spider venom elicited a barrage of miniature end plate potentials after blockade by botulinum. Electron micrographs of preparations treated with botulinum toxin and then the spider venom revealed clumping of synaptic vesicles at release sites in the otherwise depleted nerve terminals. These findings indicate that the action of botulinum toxin is not due to deficient storage of acetylcholine in vesicles or blockade of calcium entry into nerve terminals. They suggest that the toxin interferes with the acetylcholine release process itself, possibly by blocking exocytosis at the release sites."
https://openalex.org/W1556041268,"A procedure for large scale isolation of Escherichia coli RI endonuclease in high yield has been developed. The purified enzyme is homogeneous as judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analytical sedimentation. The denatured and reduced form of the enzyme has a molecular weight of 28,500 +/- 500. In solution the enzyme exists as a mixture of dimers and tetramers of molecular weights 57,000 and 114,000, respectively. We estimate the dissociation constant for tetramer to dimer transition to be less than or approximately equal to 1 x 10-7 M. Steady state kinetic analysis of the endonuclease with ColE1 DNA as substrate showed that the enzyme obeys Michaelis-Menten kinetics. At 37 degrees the turnover number is four double strand scissons per min, and the Km for ColE1 molecules is 8 x 10(-9) M. At 0 degrees the major product of endonuclease action contains only one single strand break in the RI site, and such molecules can dissociate from the enzyme. In contrast, at 30 degrees to 37 degrees, two single strand breaks are introduced into the RI sequence prior to dissociation of the enzyme. A transient enzyme-bound intermediate containing only one break in the RI site was observed in studies of a single turnover at 30 degrees. Kinetic analysis of this reaction indicates that the first break is introduced into the RI site with the first order rate constant of at least 40 min-1, while the second cleavage occurs with a rate constant of 14 min-1. Since the turnover number of the enzyme at 30 degress is only 0.72 min-1, these results indicate that the rate-limiting step is release of endonuclear from its DNA product."

https://openalex.org/W2130530673,"The ATP-energy transducing system in membranes of Escherichia coli is inhibited by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The protein component of this complex with which carbodiimides covalently react to inhibit function was previously identified by labeling wild type and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-resistant mutants with dicyclohexyl[14C]carbodiimide (Fillingame, R. H. (1975) J. Bacteriol. 124, 870-883). This specific carbodiimide-reactive protein has now been purified. The protein was extracted from the membrane with chloroform:methanol and chromatographed on DEAE-cellulose and hydroxypropyl Spehadex G-50 in this sulvent mixture. The resultant 700-fold purification yielded a protein that was homogeneous on dodecyl sulfate-acrylamide gel electrophoresis and virtually free of phospholipid. It remained soluble in neutral chloroform:methanol throughout the purification procedure. The amino acid composition of the purified protein was extraordinary in that only 16% of the amino acids present could be considered polar. Histidine, serine, cysteine, and tryptophan were not found. Abnormally high contents of methionine, glycine, alanine, and leucine were present. One mole of lysine and threonine were found/mole of dicyclohexyl[14C]carbodiimide bound. The minimum molecular weight based on the amino acid composition was 8400. The specific carbodiimide-reactive protein has also been purified without prior modification by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide. The unmodified protein eluted from DEAE-cellulose at a higher salt concentration than the dicyclohexylcarbodiimide-modified form, which suggested that the reaction with the carbodiimide neutralized the negative charge. Only one-third of the total carbodiimide-reactive protein in the membrane was modified by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide under conditions which maximally inhibited adenosine triphosphatase activity. These results rais the possibility that the carbodiimide-reactive protein may be present as an oligomer in the energy-transducing complex. The purification of the unmodified carbodiimide-reactive protein should permit assessment of tis biological function, particularly its role in the protein-translocation process that is catalyzed by this energy-transducing complex."

https://openalex.org/W1932743503,"The bacterial phosphotransferase system (PTS) catalyzes the transfer of the phosphoryl group from phosphoenolpyruvate to its sugar substrates, PTS sugars, concomitant with the translocation of these sugars across the bacterial membrane. The phosphorylation of a given sugar requires four proteins, two general proteins, Enzyme I, and the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein of the PTS (HPr), used for all sugars, and a pair of proteins specific for that sugar, designated an Enzyme II complex. The phosphotransferase system has been implicated in regulating the induction of synthesis of some catabolic enzyme systems required for the utilization of sugars that are not substrates of the phosphotransferase system, and this and the accompanying reports are concerned with this phenomenon in Salmonell typhimurium and Escherichia coli. Mutants defective in Enzyme I (ptsI), HPr (ptsH), and certain Enzymes II were isolated, and their abilities to ferment and grow on a wide range of sugars and other compounds were determined. The mutants showed the expected properties on PTS sugars, but in addition, ptsH and tight ptsI mutants were unable to utilize certain non-PTS sugars, including maltose, melibiose, glycerol, glycerol-P, mannose-6-P, and, in E. coli, lactose. Leaky Enzyme I mutants could utilize these carbohydrates, but were unable to use them in the presence of a PTS sugar such as methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside. In accord with the results reported by other laboratories, the inability of the mutants to utilize the non-PTS sugars was explained by the fact that these cells could not be normally induced to synthesize the corresponding catabolic enzyme systmes. This phenomenon is designated PTS-mediated repression. PTS-mediated repression was also observed in wild type cells, but by comparing wild type and leaky pts mutants it was shown that the sensitivity to repression by PTS sugars was greatest in mutants containing the lowest levels of Enzyme I or HPr. Furthermore, ptsI mutants containing a second site mutation in a gene for an Enzyme II were not repressed by the sugar substrate of that Enzyme II, although repression by other PTS sugars was not affected. Transport and other studies further indicated that neither appreciable uptake nor metabolism of the PTS sugars was required for these compounds to effect repression. The ptsH mutants showed the same phenotypic properties as the ptsI mutants with some important exceptions. First, they could ferment and grow on a PTS sugar, fructose. Second, after growth on fructose, (and to a lesser extent on glucose or mannose), such mutants were capable of utilizing other PTS sugars for a few generations. Third, growth of the ptsH mutants on fructose relieved PTS-mediated repression; after growth on fructose, but not on lactate, the mutants could grow for several generations on non-PTS sugars. Preliminary experiments indicated that growth on fructose resulted in the formation of one or more proteins that could substitute for HPr in the utilization of both PTS and non-PTS sugars."

Infusion of 107 (C57BL/Ka × Balb/c)F1 bone marrow cells after total lymphoid irradiation further prolonged C57BL/Ka skin graft survival to more than 120 days. Total lymphoid irradiation may eventually prove useful in clinical organ transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W1543812260,"The bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS) can repress the synthesis of certain catabolic enzyme systems in Salmonelly typhimurium and Escherichia coli. The present studies are concerned with an explanation of PTS-mediated repression by studying induction of the catabolic systems required for utilization of the non-PTS sugars glycerol, maltose, melibiose, and lactose. Repression of synthesis of these enzyme systems by various concentrations of PTS sugars was studied in wild type cells, in pts mutants, and in pts crr double mutants described in the accompanying reports (Saier, M. H., Jr., Simoni, R. D., and Roseman, S (1976) J. Biol. Chem. 251, 6584-6597: Saier, M. H., Jr., and Roseman, S. (1976) J. Biol. Chem., 6598-6605). The extent of repression was found to correlate with the degree of inhibition of uptake of the inducing non-PTS sugars. In both uninduced cells and cells fully induced for the respective transport system listed above, PTS sugars inhibited these transport systems. With both induced and uninduced cell types pts mutants were much more sensitive than wild type cells, while pts crr double mutants were completely resistant to the effects of the PTS sugars. Kinetic studies with the fully induced cells indicated that inhibition of transport by PTS sugars was reversible, that it affected the Vmax rather than the Km of entry, and that PTS sugars did not inhibit the efflux of the non-PTS sugars. These and other results indicate that inhibition did not result from competition between the PTS and non-PTS sugars for the transport systems, nor to competition for metabolic energy. Inhibition appears to require interaction of the PTS sugar with its membrane-bound Enzyme II complex, but whether concomitant uptake and phosphorylation of trace quantities of the PTS sugars is also required remains to be determined."
https://openalex.org/W2100959763,"Sea urchin (S. purpuratus) histone DNA of constructed plasmid chimeras cloned in E. coli was cleaved with the restriction endonucleases Eco RI, Hind III, Sal I, Bam I, and Hha I. The resulting fragments were ordered and isolated directly from agarose gels or cloned into other plasmids. Each fragment hybridized to one or another of the five histone mRNAs and elucidated the order of the histone genes in each of the cloned fragments. Some DNA did not hybridize to histone mRNAs and was identified as spacer DNA located between coding regions. Total sea urchin DNA was cleaved with restriction endonucleases, fractionated on agarose gels, and hybridized to histone mRNAs or histone DNA. The results revealed the order of the five histone genes in the histone gene repeat unit and demonstrate that the histone spacer DNAs have little sequence homology to other genes. Exonuclease III digestion of specific linear chimeric histone DNA plasmids followed by hybridization with mRNAs demonstrated the existence of all five histone genes on one strand of DNA and the 5′-3′ polarity of that strand. These results, in conjunction with the data of Wu et al. (1976), allow us to construct a map of coding and spacer sequences in the transcribed strand of the S. purpuratus histone gene repeat unit:"

https://openalex.org/W1549381426,"Alpha-D-Glucose is known to exert more marked insulinotropic action than B-D-glucose. Both anomers are phosphorylated at the same rate by rat islet homogenates. The islet glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase displays a preferential affinity towards beta-D-glucose-6-phosphate, and this coincides with a higher sorbitol content in the islets exposed to beta-D-glucose. On the contrary, the islet phosphoglucose isomerase is stereospecific for alpha-D-glucose 6-phosphate and, hence, the concentration of glucose 6-phosphate is lower and that of the alpha-anomer to lactate and CO2 is also higher than that of beta-D-glucose. This increased glycolytic flux is associated with a more marked inhibitory action on 14Ca efflux, a more pronounced stimulation of 45Ca net uptake and a higher rate of insulin release in the islets exposed to alpha-D-glucose. The more marked insulinotropic action of alpha- as a distinct from beta-D-glucose is thus compatible with the view that glycolysis represents the key component of the sensor device through which glucose is identified in the pancreatic B-cell as a stimulus for insulin release."
https://openalex.org/W1595583440,"The accompanying report describes phosphotransferase system-mediated repression in mutants of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli defective in Enzyme I and histidine-containing phosphate carrier protein (HPr), the general proteins of the phosphotransferase system (PTS). Such repression prevented the cells from synthesizing the catabolic systems required for utilization of the non-PTS compounds glycerol, maltose, melibiose, mannose 6-phosphate, and alpha-glycerol phosphate. This defect can be overcome by introducing a single mutation, designated crr, into the pts mutants. The pts crr double mutants can be induced to synthesize the non-PTS catabolic systems and can therefore grow on the non-PTS sugars. The crr gene is closely linked to but not part of the pts operon, and may be a regulatory gene for the operon. Assay of the PTS proteins in crr mutants showed that the only component detectably affected was a sugar-specific protein of the PTS, Factor IIIG1c, involved in the phsophorylation of glucose (and methyl alpha-glucoside). In some crr mutants Factor IIIG1c was not detected, whereas in others it was present at reduced levels. Thus the crr gene appears to code for or regulate the synthesis of this protein. In addition to the general crr mutants, several classes of sugar-specific crr mutants were isolated. For example, maltose-, melibiose-, and glycerol-specific crr mutants were isolated, each being inducible for the corresponding catabolic enzyme system but not for the others. Unlike the general crr gene, the sugar-specific crr genes do not map near the pts operon."

https://openalex.org/W2018859984,"Gentle lysis of E. coli cells in the presence of a DNA counterion (either 1.0 M NaCl or 5 mM spermidine) permits the isolation of the folded intact bacterial chromosome associated with membrane fragments. Most of the proteins in these chromosomes are also found in purified membrane preparations, and they can be identified as belonging to either the inner or the outer bacterial membrane. Ultraviolet irradiation of the membrane-attached chromosomes causes the formation of a stable complex between two inner membrane proteins (molecular weight 80,000 and 56,000 daltons) and 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-substituted DNA. The photochemical attachment of BrdU-substituted DNA to specific membrane proteins suggests that these proteins may be bound to the DNA in vivo. Such DNA-membrane-binding proteins may have a role in the attachment of the folded chromosome to the bacterial envelope."

Immunostaining indicated that over 85 percent of these PAS-purple cells were gonadotrophs containing both follicle stimulating and luteinizing hormone. Reproducible cell cultures could be obtained on poly-L-lysine coated dishes. As early as the second day in culture, the secretion of both follicle stimulating and luteinizing hormone was highly stimulated by luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone. The effect on FSH was as marked as that on LH. The data suggest that the isolated gonadotrophs are a specific functional subtype."
https://openalex.org/W2077988774,Sulfamethoxazole and other sulfa drugs are moderately potent inhibitors of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase. They also significantly potentiate the inhibition of this enzyme by trimethoprim. The molecular basis for inhibition potentiation is the simultaneous binding of trimethoprim and sulfa by the enzyme. This potentiation may explain the synergism observed when these drugs are used in antibacterial chemotherapy.
https://openalex.org/W1847150206,"The NADH dehydrogenase of the Escherichia coli respiratory chain has been identified by the following properties: (a) its location in membrane vesicles; (b) its inhibition by AMP in a fashion similar to that of the NADH oxidase; (c) its specificity for NADH, but not NADPH, with the same Km for NADH as that of the NADH oxidase; (d) its sensitivity when membrane-bound to inhibition by dicoumarol, rotenone, and 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline-N-oxide, which are also inhibitors for the NADH oxidase. The NADH-dehydrogenase of the cytosol fraction (assayed as NADH-dichlorphenolindophenol reductase activity) differs substantially from the membrane-bound activity both in substrate specificity and in the inhibitors of the reaction. The respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase was extracted from isolated membrane vesicle preparations by solubilization in Triton X-100, and was purified in buffers containing that detergent. The purification employed chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, precipitation by 30% ethanol, and chromatography on hydroxyalapatite and DEAE-agarose. The most highly purified preparations of the enzyme were homogeneous in migration on polyacrylamide gels containing Triton X-100, at pH 9.5, where one band accounted for all of the protein and activity. Electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecul sulfate showed 1 band of molecular weight 38,000, which accounted for over 75% of the protein on the gel. Because of requirements for either Triton X-100 or phospholipid for activity of the purified enzyme, it is difficult to estimate the level of purification achieved over isolated membrane vesicles. However, we estimate that the enzyme was purified some 30-fold over membrane vesicles, or some 300-fold over whole cells."

https://openalex.org/W1518165602,"Carbamyl phosphate and succinate each bind to six sites in the hexameric aspartate transcarbamylase from Escherichia coli when both ligands are present in saturating concentrations. Their respective dissociation constants are 2.4 and 1400 muM. Positive homotropic interaction, shown earlier for the association of succinate with the enzyme in the presence of carbamyl phosphate (Changeux, J.-P., Gerhart, J.C., and Schachamn, H.K. (1968) Biochemistry 7, 513-538), is also found for carbamyl phosphate binding in the presence of succinate. Apparent half-of-the-sites saturation, previously described for carbamyl phosphate binding in the absence of succinate (Rosenbusch, J.P., and Griffin, J.H. (1973) J. Biol, Chem. 248, 5063-5066), also occurs when succinate binds to the enzyme in the absence of carbamyl phosphate. A second class of three low affinity sites for carbamyl phosphate could be detected in the enzyme when succinate was absent. These results indicate that aspartate transcarbamylase exists in an asymmetric state under several defined conditions. The results reported were obtained with a highly sensitive filter bonding assay, modified to allow the study of the protein-ligand interactions with dissociation constants in the millimolar range. The assay is described in detail. Its validity is demonstrated by the good correlation of the results obtained with those observed with independent methods."

The enzyme had an absolute requirement fo a divalent cation which could be satisfied by Mg2+, Mn2+ or Co2+. In contrast to the Escherichia coli enzyme, we have found no evidence to implicate Zn2+ in the action of rabbit liver tRNA nucleotidyltransferase. We have also identified a second cation requirement which was satisfied by divalent or monovalent cation or polyamines. The polyamines, spermine and spermidine, were most effective leading to 3-fold higher rates of nucleotide incorporation than could be obtained at any concentration of the other cations. However, the polyamines were not an absolute requirement for enzyme activity. The polyamine stimulation of tRNA nucleotidyltransferase was not due to alteration of the pH or ionic strength of the reaction mixture or reactivation of denatured tRNA or enzyme. Polyamines also had no effect on the apparent Km values of the substrates. Spermine increased the specificity of the enzyme for tRNA substrates and also inhibited the reverse action. Our results suggest that polyamines may be the normal counterions for tRNA in vivo, and that they affect the rate-limiting step in tRNA nucleotidyltransferase catalysis."

https://openalex.org/W1566557181,"D-Serine apodehydratase from Escherichia coli is rapidly inactivated by butanedione in K+ borate buffer or by phenylglyoxal in K+ phosphate buffer at pH 8, 25 degrees. Pyridoxal-P protects against the inactivation. Modification of the apoenzyme abolishes its ability to bind the cofactor, pyridoxal-P, but the apparent Km for the substrate, D-serine, is not altered. The concentration dependence of the rate of butanedione inactivation in K+ borate buffer indicates that it is a two-step process with one butanedione bound per molecule of apoenzyme to give an inactive complex; half-maximal rate of inactivation is obtained at 37 mM butanedione. Butanedione inactivation is fully reversed following removal of excess reagent and borate. Similar studies with [14C]phenylglyoxal show that in the presence of pyridoxal-P at least 2 arginine residues may be modified without loss of activity. In the absence of pyridoxal-P modification of a single additional arginine residue results in loss of activity. Results with both inactivating reagents thus demonstrate that a critical arginine residue participates in binding of the coenzyme, pyridoxal-P. The stoichiometry of phenylglyoxal incorporation into the enzyme is different in the presence and absence of borate. Under both conditions incorporated phenylglyoxal is slowly lost on dialysis at neutral pH. A possible explanation of these effects is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1605242012,"The structural organization of the complex of Escherichia coli Ile-tRNA synthetase and tRNA Ile has been studied by isotope labeling of purine units in the tRNA. Free or bound tRNA is incubated in tritiated water for 5 to 15 h at 37 degrees in order to incorporate tritium into the C-8 positions of purine units. (Previous work has shown that the labeling rate of a purine is very sensitive to its microenvironment.) Under conditions where exchange-out does not occur, the nucleic acid is digested with nucleases and purines are subsequently isolated from known locations in the structure. Four purines are substantially perturbed by bound Ile-tRNA synthetase; in each case, the rate of labeling is retarded in the presence of the synthetase. The four purines occur at or near the 3' terminus and at the interface of the dihydrouridine stem and loop. These bases occur in segments of the tRNA that previous photochemical cross-linking studies have identified as important for synthetase-tRNA interactions. It appears that the effects observed on these sites are caused by their direct interaction with or shielding by the bound synthetase. In addition, two other sites, one in the anticodon and one in the amino acid acceptor-T psi C helix, appear to be perturbed (retarded labeling rates) by the bound enzyme. The data also suggest there is no significant conformational change in the tRNA upon binding to the synthetase."
https://openalex.org/W1535642366,"3,4-Dihydroxy[3-(3)H]butyl-1-phosphonate, and analogue of glycerol 3-phosphate, is incorporated into a very polar lipid material by cultures of Escherichia coli strain 8 and in vitro by CDP-diglyceride:sn-glycerol-3-phosphate phosphatidyltransferase. These labeled lipids have been fractionated by column chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, revealing that only one labeled compound is formed in vitro, while four are synthesized in vivo. The main component of the material formed by intact cells has been shown to be identical with that produced enzymatically. This species has been identified as the phosphonic acid analogue of phosphatidylglycerophosphate [(1,2-diacyl)-sn-glyceryl-D-4'-phosphoryloxy-3'-hydroxybutyl-1'-phosphonate]. Hydrolysis of this novel lipid with phospholipase C resulted in the production of diglyceride and a water-soluble derivative of 3,4-dihydroxybutyl-1-phosphonate and inorganic phosphate in a molar ratio of 1.03/1. Enzymatic analysis of the phosphonate liberated in this manner showed it to be the D enantiomer, thereby confirming the proposed structure of the lipid analogue. The analogue of phosphatidylglycerophosphate did not turn over and appeared to have no precursor-product relationship to the other labeled lipids derived from 3,4-dihydroxy[3-(3)H]butyl-1-phosphonate in vivo. Analysis of the other three labeled products revealed the tritium to be present on glycerol 3-phosphate and not intact phosphonate, indicating some metabolic degradation of the latter. Examination of cell components other than lipids revealed little incorporation of label, while a significant amount of tritium was found to be present in a distillable form, 3H2O. Experiments with mutants of E. coli lacking the known glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenases indicated that these enzymes are not responsible for the removal of tritium from from 3,4-dihydroxy[3-(3)H]butyl-1-phosphonate in vivo. Indirect evidence suggests that the inhibition of cell growth by this analogue is not due to its catabolic products."
https://openalex.org/W1554021829,"The binding of adenosine diphosphate-ribosylated elongation factor 2 (ADPRib-EF-2) to ribosomes was inhibited both in the presence and absence of GTP in proportion to the amounts of unmodified EF-2 added. Concomitant with this inhibition, an increase in the activity of ribosome-bound EF-2 in polyphenylalanine synthesis was observed. On the other hand, the addition of ADPRib-EF-2 reduced the rate of poly(Phe) synthesis observed in the presence of a saturating amount of EF-2 and increased the amount of EF-2 required for the half-maximal rate of poly(Phe) synthesis. Phe-tRNA, nonenzymatically bound to the ribosome in the presence of poly(U), inhibited the subsequent binding of ADPHRib-EF-2. The same ribosomal population appeared to preferentially bind either aminoacyl-tRNA or ADPRib-EF-2. The Scatchard plot of the binding of ADPRib-EF-2 to the ribosome in the presence of GTP revealed the presence of two ribosomal binding sites (or ribosomal populations) with apparent different affinities for the modified factor (K371 degrees d,1 = 6.6 nM and K37 degrees d,2 = 126 nM). At saturating concentrations of ADPRib-EF-2, a maximum of about 1 molecule of the factor was bound per ribosome. The binding of ADPRib-EF-2 to the ribosome was stimulated by GTP. The binding of radioactive GTP to the ribosome was observed concomitantly with the binding of ADPRib-EF-2. One mole of GTP was bound per mole of ADPRib-EF-2. No significant difference could be found in the binding of GTP to ribosome required in the presence of either EF-2 or ADPRib-EF-2. The binding of ADPRib-EF-2 to the ribosome required the presence of Mg2+ and reached a maximum at 5 mM. The binding was greatest at K+ concentrations below 20 mM. ADPRib-EF-2 was bound primarily to the large ribosomal subunit. A slight, but reproducible binding to the 40 S subunit was also observed. The addition of 40 S to 60 S subunits stimulated the binding of ADPRib-EF-2. GTP displayed a stimulatory effect on the binding only in the presence of recombined subunits. Human ADPRib-EF-2 was bound to rat liver ribosomes as efficiently as to human tonsil ribosomes, while the binding to Escherichia coli ribosomes was insignificant."
https://openalex.org/W1570612175,"The conformations of aminoacyl- and deacylated tRNA Phe (yeast) have been compared by using the steroid progesterone and the tetranucleotides U-C-C-C and C-G-A-A as probes of transfer RNA ordered structure. U-C-C-C is complementary to G18-G19-G20-A21 in the dihydrouridine loop and C-G-A-A is complementary to T54-psi55-C56-G57 in the ribosylthymine loop. None of the probes bound to deacylated tRNA Phe but all three bound to phenylalanyl-tRNA Phe, with molar association constants of the order of 10(4) M-1. The oligonucleotide binding data imply that the tertiary hydrogen bonds between G18 and psi55, G19 and C56, T54 and m1A58, and A21 and the ribose of U8 (Quigley, G. J., Wang, A. H. J., Seeman, N. C., Suddath, F. L., Rich, A., Sussman, J. L., and Kim, S. H., (1975) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 72, 4866-4870) are destabilized or broken on aminoacylation, unmasking the sequence T-psi-C-G thought to be involved in ribosome binding of aminoacyl-tRNA. The presumed progesterone binding site is G18-G19-G20, which is part of the binding site for U-C-C-C. Competition was not, however, observed between these two probes; model building has shown that they could, theoretically, bind simultaneously. Since progesterone bound to N-acetyl-Phe-tRNA Phe, the introduction of the additional positive charge on aminoacylation is not sufficient per se to explain the conformational change. The association of progesterone with peptidyl-tRNA Phe was similar to that with aminoacyl-tRNA Phe, implying that no further conformational change takes place in the region of the steroid binding site on formation of a peptide bond."
https://openalex.org/W1596848240,"The control of the synthesis of ribosomal proteins L7L12 (which lack histidine) was examined during growth and histidine starvation of stringent and relaxed histidine mutants. Since no ribosomes are synthesized during starvation, these proteins, in both the stringent and relaxed organisms, accumulated in the supernatant and were shown to possess both biological and physical characteristics typical of normal L7L12. However, the rate and extent of synthesis of these proteins during starvation is greater in the relaxed strain than in the stringent. These data suggest that the regulation of the synthesis of these proteins, similar to that of ribosomal RNA is regulated by the stringent control system. It was also shown that during normal growth of both organisms, L7L12 is also found in the supernatant as well as on the ribosomes. The L7L12 found in the supernatant under these conditions, however, appears to be different than ribosomal L7L12."
https://openalex.org/W1556919838,"Polyriboadenylate polymerase was isolated from Escherichia coli PR7 (RNase I-, pnp) in good yield and high purity. The enzyme catalyzes the polymerization of ATP and ADP. These polymerizations show an initial lag which can be removed by the addition of poly(A). However, poly(A) does not function as a primer. UDP and CDP can also serve as substrates but with decreased efficiency. The polymerization of CDP is enhanced by the presence of an oligonucleotide which again does not function as a primer. Polymerization of [gamma-32P]ATP or [beta-32P]ADP result in products with no radioactivity. The product formed from [alpha-32P]ATP on hydrolysis with alkali yields labeled pAp and 2',3'-AMP; thus the enzyme synthesizes poly(A) chains de novo. During the polymerization of ATP, no burst of free ADP can be detected and the time course of phosphate release from ATP ro ADP follows very closely the kinetics of polymerization. dATP and dADP are effective inhibitors of poly(A) synthesis from either ATP or ADP. Sulfhydryl reagents inhibit only the polymerization of ATP and the inhibition is fully reversed by dithiothreitol. However, the enzyme can be protected from sulfhydryl reagents by preincubation with either ATP or ADP in the absence of Mg2+ which is required for polymerization. Studies using acrylamide gel electrophoresis indicate that the polymerization activity with either ATP or nucleoside diphosphates resides in the same protein. The enzyme catalyzes the following exchanges: 32Pi into ADP, 32Pi into ATP, and [14C] ADP into ATP in the presence of phosphate. While the enzyme catalyzes the phosphorolysis of its own product, (pAp-(Ap)nA), it fails to cleave the dephosphorylated product, (Ap(Ap)nA), or ribosomal RNA or tRNA in the presence of inorganic phosphate. The differences and similarities between poly(A) polymerase and polynucleotide phosphorylase are discussed. Based on the 32P exchange studies and other properties of poly(A) polymerase, a plausible mechanism for its action is proposed."

https://openalex.org/W1551121604,"The energetics of the binding of thiodigalatoside onto vesicles of Escherichia coli containing M protein is described. The Kd determined from equilibrium dialysis was 5-10(-5) M. The enthalpy change (deltaH) was measured by calorimetry. The derived deltaG and deltaH values allowed estimation of the entropic change associated with the binding reaction. The control experiments were made with membranes from cells that were not induced for the lac system. All the experiments were carried out in presence of 10(-2) M sodium azide to prevent any concentration of thiodigalactoside into the vesicles. It was concluded that such membrane vesicles which are in a de-energized state are able to bine thiodigalactoside specifically with a Kd corresponding to the Km of the entry of beta-galactoside measured with intact, active cells."

https://openalex.org/W1606639514,"An unsaturated fatty acid auxotroph lacking D-lactate dehydrogenase activity has been isolated from Escherichia coli ML 308-225 dld-3. While NADH oxidase activity in membrane vesicles prepared from the mutant cells grown in a variety of unsaturated fatty acids is comparable to that of previously isolated fatty acid auxotrophs, D-lactate oxidase activity is absent. However, D-lactate oxidase ativity can be restored when vesicles are incubated with a purified preparation of D-lactate dehydrogenase obtained from wild type cells. The effect of altering the fatty acid composition of the membrane on the reconstitution of D-lactate oxidase activity was examined. Binding of purified D-lactate dehydrogenase was not affected by either the lipid composition of the membrane vesicles or the temperature during reconstitution. However, the reconstitution of D-lactate oxidase activity was strongly influenced by the fatty acid composition of the membrane lipids. The temperature dependence of the reconstituted activity was analyzed. Temperature transitions were not observed with membrane vesicles supplemented with oleic or linolenic acid but palmitelaidic acid-enriched vesicles exhibited a transition temperature at 30 degrees. Attempts to reconstitute the elaidic-supplemented vesicles at temperatures below 30 degrees failed to yield active D-lactate oxidase and the vesicles aggregated. At 42 degrees, aggregation did not occur and D-lactate oxidase activity was obtained to a level of 10% of that found with membranes from the parent strain (ML 308-225). These results suggest that although binding of D-lactate dehydrogenase is independent of the physical state of the membrane, reconstitution of the D-lactate oxidase activity in membrane vesicles is dependent upon the fatty acid composition of the phospholipid, hence the physical state of the membrane."

https://openalex.org/W2055304069,"STRAINS of Campylobacter, a genus of microaerophilic bacteria, have been isolated by various workers from the gut and faeces of several animal species including man1, but as far as we know, there have been no reports of their isolation from rodents. The continuing importance of diseases of farm animals involving campylobacters, for example infectious infertility and sporadic abortion in cattle2, abortion in sheep2 and dysentery in pigs3, and the paucity of information on the source of outbreaks of some of these diseases prompted us to investigate whether campylobacters were present in the faeces of bank voles (Clethrionomys glariolus), short tailed field voles (Microtus agrestis) and long tailed field mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) from their natural habitat. These species are common throughout mainland Great Britain4 and were being trapped as part of an investigation into the distribution of pathogenic bacteria and viruses in small wild rodents. Bank voles and field mice are commonly found in woodland and scrub, and short tailed field voles are found in grassland, therefore all three species might provide a source of infection for domestic animals. We report here that bank voles carry campylobacters."
https://openalex.org/W1608742868,"Studies on the effect of the temperature requirement for RNA chain initiation by Escherichia coli RNA polymerase on DNA, chromatin, and reconstituted were carried out in order to better understand the nature of the initiation process. Varying the temperature or ionic strength during preincubations had little effect on the formation of stable preinitiation complexes (RS complexes) between RNA polymerase and chromatin. This observation was in marked ocntrast to similar studies performed on native DNA and indicates that initiation sites for RNA synthesis on are different from those on double-stranded DNA and resemble more closely initiation of RNA synthesis on single-stranded DNA. These results suggest that the local unwinding of the initiation region which is required for RNA chain initiation on native DNA may not be a prerequisite for RNA initiation on chromatin. The results of studies on reconstituted devoid of different classes of proteins demonstrate that both histone and nonhistone fractions are essential in maintaining the characteristics inherent to initiation of RNA synthesis on chromatin. Removal of either moderatley lysine-rich histone or arginine-rich histone fractions led to the complete loss of the characteristic chromatin type initiation pattern for RNA synthesis, whereas, removing lysine-rich (Fi) histone had no effect. Single strand specific and double strand specific antibodies to DNA and a single strand specific nuclease were used as probes to examine the structure of sites for initiation of RNA synthesis. Their effects on RNA synthesis suggest that initiation sites on are not located in freely accessible single-stranded or double-stranded regions of DNA."
