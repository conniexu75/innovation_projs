https://openalex.org/W2030932324,"TRYPTAMINE is a normal constituent of human urine1–5; about 30–120 µg of the amine are excreted per 24 h. In blood, tryptamine has hitherto been demonstrated only qualitatively and under pathological conditions in a carcinoid patient6. There is no information about an occurrence of N,N-dimethyltryptamine in human beings. N,N-dimethyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (= Bufotenin) was demonstrated qualitatively as a constituent of normal human urine4,7; in children an excretion of 0–0.03 µg amine/100 mg creatinine has been found with, at most, semi-quantitative methods4. Apparently, N,N-dimethyl-5-hydroxytryptamine was still not demonstrated in blood. 5-Methoxytryptamine has been found in the urine of patients with rheumatic fever8, and that in an order of magnitude of 30–210 µg/24 h."

https://openalex.org/W2044160058,"AMONG various biological active amines, bufotenine and 3,4-dimethoxyphenylethylamine have recently been given special attention in the psychiatric field because of their structural similarities to normal metabolites as well as their psychotomimetic properties. The presence of a bufotenine-like compound in ‘schizophrenic’ urine was first reported by Fischer et al.1. Recently Perry et al.2 identified bufotenine in the normal urine from children with or without the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitor, and Brune et al.3 reported that they had confirmed the presence of bufotenine in ‘schizophrenic’ urine. Since Friedhoff et al.4 reported the frequent occurrence of 3,4-dimethoxyphenylethylamine in ‘schizophrenic’ urine samples, the existence, the non-existence and/or the significance of this compound has been discussed5–7 and is still open to discussion."

https://openalex.org/W1993297748,"IN this communication some suggestions as to nomenclature of polymorphic protein systems are considered. For these, primarily those of blood, the number of recognized systems increases rapidly in both man and animals. The techniques for detecting and characterizing such systems vary. This bears some influence on the problem of nomenclature. If we, for example, have a system recognized by serological methods only, the common practice has been to name the first-found character A (or a)1, the next B (or b) and so on. The letters therefore merely show the order of detection. After the characters have been classified into genetic systems, letter designations, usually two, have been ascribed to each system. Such a nomenclature is sufficient if characters belonging to the same system do not show a second order of relationship which is contradictory to the alphabetical order. This often happens with polymorphic proteins characterized by their different rates of migration as determined by, for example, the technique of electrophoresis."

https://openalex.org/W2052130722,"THE marked, anti-complementary effect of fresh fowl serum on guinea-pig complement and its reduction by heating to 56° C are well known1,2. Treatments of fowl serum by methods other than heating which reduced this effect also resulted in a decrease in its own haemolytic activity3, suggesting that the anti-complementary effect of fowl serum may be related to its own complement content. More recently, it has been shown that the euglobulin fraction of fowl serum, corresponding to the midpiece or first component of fowl complement, is the fraction which reduces the haemolytic titre of guinea-pig complement4,5. This heat-labile euglobulin fraction appears to be the same as the ‘normal chicken factor’ reported to be necessary for the specific fixation of guinea-pig end-piece by fowl antibody/antigen complexes4,6. Its anti-complementary effect on guinea-pig complement was also mentioned, but it was stated that this could be removed by dissolving the fraction in heated normal fowl serum to give a ‘concentrated normal chicken factor’5. Orlans, Rose and Clapp3 investigated this factor and found that, with certain concentrations of fowl serum, it could produce reductions in the haemolytic activity of guinea-pig complement, simulating specific fixation by antigen/antibody mixtures. We have now compared the effects of fowl serum, before and after various treatments, on the haemolytic activities of both fowl and guinea-pig complements."
