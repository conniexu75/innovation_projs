https://openalex.org/W2132188221,"Over 50% of all human cancers lose p53 function. To evaluate the role of aggregation in cancer, we asked whether wild-type (WT) p53 and the hot-spot mutant R248Q could aggregate as amyloids under physiological conditions and whether the mutant could seed aggregation of the wild-type form. The central domains (p53C) of both constructs aggregated into a mixture of oligomers and fibrils. R248Q had a greater tendency to aggregate than WT p53. Full-length p53 aggregated into amyloid-like species that bound thioflavin T. The amyloid nature of the aggregates was demonstrated using x-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, FTIR, dynamic light scattering, cell viabilility assay, and anti-amyloid immunoassay. The x-ray diffraction pattern of the fibrillar aggregates was consistent with the typical conformation of cross β-sheet amyloid fibers with reflexions of 4.7 Å and 10 Å. A seed of R248Q p53C amyloid oligomers and fibrils accelerated the aggregation of WT p53C, a behavior typical of a prion. The R248Q mutant co-localized with amyloid-like species in a breast cancer sample, which further supported its prion-like effect. A tumor cell line containing mutant p53 also revealed massive aggregation of p53 in the nucleus. We conclude that aggregation of p53 into a mixture of oligomers and fibrils sequestrates the native protein into an inactive conformation that is typical of a prionoid. This prion-like behavior of oncogenic p53 mutants provides an explanation for the negative dominance effect and may serve as a potential target for cancer therapy.

Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), deaths from cancer will reach 11 million annually by 2030. Biomedical research has provided a great deal of information about cancer, but the molecular mechanisms that lead to cancer remain poorly understood. The role of the tumor suppressor protein p53 is regarded as vital, as p53 is a nuclear phosphoprotein that induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to cellular stress, particularly DNA damage. Moreover, mutations in the p53 gene (TP53) are strongly associated with increased susceptibility to cancer (1Vousden K.H. Lane D.P. p53 in health and disease.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (1728) Google Scholar). p53 is a tetrameric flexible protein containing 393 residues. The N-terminal activation domain is able to interact with a number of proteins, whereas the C-terminal domain is responsible for tetramerization. The central region or core domain (p53C) of the protein constitutes the sequence-specific DNA-binding region (2Joerger A.C. Fersht A.R. Structural biology of the tumor suppressor p53.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2008; 77: 557-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar) and is the segment most involved in mutant-related tumors. Previously, we showed that the core domain of p53 forms β-sheet-rich fibrillar aggregates under mild denaturing conditions (hydrostatic pressure) (3Ishimaru D. Andrade L.R. Teixeira L.S. Quesado P.A. Maiolino L.M. Lopez P.M. Cordeiro Y. Costa L.T. Heckl W.M. Weissmüller G. Foguel D. Silva J.L.

Res. 2010; 43: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). At that time, our group hypothesized that p53 aggregation could lead to cancer (3Ishimaru D. Andrade L.R. Teixeira L.S. Quesado P.A. Maiolino L.M. Lopez P.M. Cordeiro Y. Costa L.T. Heckl W.M. Weissmüller G. Foguel D. Silva J.L. Fibrillar aggregates of the tumor suppressor p53 core domain.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9022-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In support of this view, it has been reported that p53 regions other than the DNA-binding domain may undergo aggregation under physiological conditions (5Galea C. Bowman P. Kriwacki R.W.

In addition, the largely unstructured N-terminal transactivation domain aggregates into fibrils when incubated at low pH (7Rigacci S. Bucciantini M. Relini A. Pesce A. Gliozzi A. Berti A. Stefani M.

We found that small cognate DNAs stabilize the core domain and full-length p53 and have the potential to rescue aggregated, misfolded species (8Ishimaru D. Ano Bom A.P. Lima L.M. Quesado P.A.

Cognate DNA stabilizes the tumor suppressor p53 and prevents misfolding and aggregation.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 6126-6135Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated that mutant p53 co-localizes with amyloid-like protein aggregates in cancer biopsies (9Levy C.B. Stumbo A.C. Ano Bom A.P. Portari E.A. Cordeiro Y. Silva J.L. De Moura-Gallo C.V. Co-localization of mutant p53 and amyloid-like protein aggregates in breast tumors.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2011; 43: 60-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Finally, aggregated mutant p53 induces co-aggregation of wild-type p53 and its paralogs p63 and p73 (10Xu J. Reumers J. Couceiro J.R. De Smet F. Gallardo R. Rudyak S. Cornelis A. Rozenski J.

Biol. 2011; 7: 285-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). Therefore, the hypothesis that p53 aggregation may participate in some cancers similarly to the situation in Alzheimer and Parkinson disease (11Chiti F. Dobson C.M.

The two faces of Janus: functional interactions and protein aggregation.Curr. Opin. Struct.

Structure, function, and aggregation of the zinc-free form of the p53 DNA binding domain.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2396-2403Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), we know little about the molecular mechanisms involved and its potential relevance to the tumorigenic process (14Antony H Wiegmans A.P. Wei M.Q. Chernoff Y.O. Khanna K.K. Munn A.L. Potential roles for prions and protein-only inheritance in cancer.Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2011; 31: 1-19Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The most frequent p53 mutation found in cancers is the hot-spot mutation R248Q, which renders the protein unable to bind cognate DNA and exert its proper functions (15Hollstein M. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Harris C.C. p53 mutations in human cancers.Science. 1991; 253: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (7452) Google Scholar, 16Olivier M. Hollstein M. Hainaut P. TP53 mutations in human cancers: origins, consequences, and clinical use.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2: a001008Crossref PubMed Scopus (1155) Google Scholar). Here, we asked whether wild-type p53 and R248Q could form aggregates under physiological conditions, what the properties of these aggregates would be and whether mutant p53 aggregates could seed aggregation of the wild-type isoform. The morphology, structure, kinetics, and toxicity of the aggregates were characterized at pH 7.2 and 5.0 for the first time using electron microscopy, dot-blots, x-ray diffraction, FTIR, and LIVE/DEAD viability assays. We found that full-length p53 undergoes amyloid aggregation in a pattern similar to that of the p53 core domain. In addition, we performed immunofluorescence co-localization assays and found positive amyloid aggregation in a tumor sample bearing the R248Q mutant and in breast cancer tumoral cell lines. This result corroborates our in vitro finding that R248Q has a higher propensity to aggregate than wild-type p53. Most interestingly, a mixture of amyloid oligomers and fibrils of R248Q were found to seed the aggregation of wild-type p53 in a prion-like fashion. This prion-like aggregation behavior would explain the negative dominance of mutant p53, and this knowledge may help in developing new therapeutic strategies to prevent or control cancer progression. All reagents were of analytical grade. Distilled water was filtered and deionized through a Millipore water purification system. p53C (comprising amino acid residues 94 to 312) subcloning, expression, and purification were performed as previously described (3Ishimaru D. Andrade L.R. Teixeira L.S. Quesado P.A. Maiolino L.M. Lopez P.M. Cordeiro Y. Costa L.T. Heckl W.M. Weissmüller G. Foguel D. Silva J.L. Fibrillar aggregates of the tumor suppressor p53 core domain.Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 9022-9027Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Three aggregation procedures were employed using 5 μm of p53C, as follows. The HT aggregate procedure consisted of subjecting proteins to increasing temperatures, varying from 25 to 60 °C, at 5 °C increments and allowing the proteins to remain at each temperature for 10 min. The 37T aggregate procedure consisted of incubating p53C at 37 °C for 2 h. The HP aggregate procedure consisted of pressure-induced aggregation performed at 37 °C, in which proteins were submitted to increasing pressures up to 3 kbar in ∼500-bar increments, and the samples were incubated for 8 min at each pressure. The pressure cell was purchased from ISS (Champaign, IL). All measurements were performed using 50 mm Tris, pH 7.2 or 70 mm sodium acetate pH 5.0 as buffers, and both buffers contained 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, and 5% (v/v) glycerol. CD experiments were carried out using a Jasco J-715 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Corporation, Japan) and a 0.01-cm path length quartz cuvette. Far-UV spectra of 25 μm for WT or R248Q p53C were monitored from 200 to 260 nm and averaged over 3 scans. The buffer (50 mm Tris pH 7.2 or 70 mm sodium acetate pH 5.0, both containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm DTT, and 5% (v/v) glycerol) baselines were subtracted from their respective sample spectra. Thioflavin T (ThT) 3The abbreviations used are: ThTthioflavin TDLSdynamic light scatteringFTIRFourier transformed infraredTEMtransmission electron microscopyPrPprion proteinSECsize-exclusion chromatographyTTRtransthyretin. fluorescence was acquired using an ISS-PC1 spectrofluorimeter (ISS, Champaign, IL) with excitation at 450 nm and emitted light collected in the 470 to 530 nm range. p53C (5 μm) was incubated with 50 μm ThT, and the temperature or pressure was increased to obtain the HT or HP aggregates, respectively. To measure the aggregation kinetics, soluble p53C (5 μm) was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h (37T aggregate) with 25 μm ThT. ThT emission was collected over time at 480 nm (the excitation was set at 450 nm). p53 samples were routinely centrifuged at 14,000 rpm/15 min prior to the experiments to eliminate any background aggregation signal. thioflavin T dynamic light scattering Fourier transformed infrared transmission electron microscopy prion protein size-exclusion chromatography transthyretin. DLS data of soluble oligomeric species (obtained after centrifugation of p53C aggregates at 14,000 rpm/15min) were acquired using a DynaPro NanoStar instrument (Wyatt Technology) with three independent acquisitions of 10 measurements each. After aggregation, the samples were dialyzed against water and further lyophilized and were then deposited directly on the ATR surface of a Nicolet 6700 IR instrument (Thermo Corp.). The amide I region (1700–1600 cm−1) was deconvoluted using OMNIC software (Thermo Corp.), and the secondary structure components were assigned as previously described (17Cordeiro Y. Kraineva J.

The ultrastructure of the p53C aggregates (HT aggregate, 37T aggregate and HP aggregate) was analyzed using TEM in a Jeol 1200 EM operated at 80 kV using negative staining. Samples were adhered to a carbon-coated grid and stained with a 2% solution of uranyl acetate prepared in water. Aggregates of WT p53C and mutant R248Q at pH 7.2 or 5.0 were placed onto a nitrocellulose membrane at a concentration of 50 μm in a final volume of 10 μl. The membrane was blocked with TBS-T (10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.15 m NaCl pH 8.0, 0.1% Tween 20) + 5% nonfat milk for 2 h at room temperature and incubated for 18 h at 4 °C with the primary antibody A11 (which recognizes several types of amyloid oligomers (19Glabe C.G. Conformation-dependent antibodies target diseases of protein misfolding.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 542-547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar)) at a 1:1,000 dilution (Chemicon, CA). The membrane was then washed with TBS-T and incubated with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody at a 1:10,000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature in TBS-T + 5% nonfat milk. After five washes with TBS, the membrane was developed using an ECL kit (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). We used bovine serum albumin (BSA) and soluble WT p53C as negative controls. The aggregate of the amyloidogenic protein TTR (transthyretin) was used as a positive control. x-ray diffraction of fibrils was measured using the D03B-MX1 beamline at the National Laboratory of Synchrotron Light (Campinas, SP, Brazil). The wavelength used was λ = 1.488 Å, the distance between the sample and the CCD detector (MarResearch) was 100 mm, and the image was acquired at a fixed angle for 15 min and recorded using AutoMar software (MarResearch). Vero cells were maintained in DMEM-high glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. After reaching 80% confluence, cells were plated in 24-well plates, and the aggregates were added at a 4 μm final concentration. After 48 h, the cells were tested with the LIVE/DEAD Viability/Cytotoxicity Assay kit (Invitrogen). Cell fluorescence was visualized under an LSM 510 meta fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss International, Oberkochen, Germany). The buffers used included the following: 10 mm Tris and 10 mm NaCl, pH 7.2; or 10 mm MES and 10 mm NaCl, pH 5.0. Evaluation of Congo red binding to p53 aggregates was carried out according to Lai et al. (20Lai Z. Colón W. Kelly J.W. The acid-mediated denaturation pathway of transthyretin yields a conformational intermediate that can self-assemble into amyloid.Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6470-6482Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). Briefly, after protein aggregation in CRBB (Congo red binding buffer), containing 5 mm phosphate, 150 mm KCl, pH 7.5, 1 μm p53C samples were incubated with Congo red (Sigma) at 10 μm. After 30 min, the absorbance of the suspension at 477 and 540 nm was measured, and the amount of Congo red bound to amyloid fibrils (mol of Congo red bound/liter of suspension) was calculated with the following formula: A540 nm/25,295-A477 nm/46,306. For polarization microscopy (21Howie A.J. Brewer D.B. Howell D. Jones A.P. Physical basis of colors seen in Congo red-stained amyloid in polarized light.Lab. Invest. 2008; 88: 232-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), these aggregates were washed three times with CRBB and the ressuspended pellets were transferred to glass slides and cover slides. p53C aggregates stained with Congo red were analyzed using a Olympus BX51 light microscope equipped with polarizers. Paraffin-embedded tumor biopsies from five breast cancer cases diagnosed as invasive ductal carcinoma and previously analyzed for TP53 mutational status were obtained from the Department of Pathology at the Fernandes Figueira Institute (IFF-FIOCRUZ) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Briefly, tumor sections were incubated in 10 mm citrate buffer at pH 6.0 and 55 °C for 20 min for antigen retrieval, and nonspecific antigenic sites were blocked with PBS/BSA 5%. Next, sections were labeled with the A11 primary antibody (1:2,000) and then incubated with a donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated secondary antibody. Next, these labeled sections were incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-human p53 protein DO-1 primary antibody (1:200), which was followed by incubation with a donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibody. In both cases, the primary antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C, and the secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in a moist and dark chamber. The samples were washed and mounted and analyzed under a confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 510 META, Carl Zeiss Inc.). The study was approved by the local research ethics committee. The human breast carcinoma cell lines MCF-7 (wild-type p53) and MDA-MB 231 (mutated p53 - p.R280K.) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). MCF-7 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 1.0 g/liter glucose supplemented with 2.0 g/liter HEPES, 3.7 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 5 μg/ml bovine insulin. MDA-MB 231 cells were cultured in DMEM containing 4.5 g/liter glucose supplemented with 2.0 g/liter HEPES, 3.7 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, and 10% fetal bovine serum. A total of 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin were added to the culture plates prior to the experiments. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. To analyze the degree of p53 aggregation in cell lines, we have lysed both MCF-7 (WT) and MDA-MB-231 (R280K) cells in a buffer containing Tris-HCl 5 mm, NaCl 150 mm, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) using liquid nitrogen. The lysate was centrifuged for 5 min at 3,000 rpm and 250 μl of the supernatant was immediately loaded onto a Superdex S200 HR10/30 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, pH 7.5) using a 0.4 ml/min flow in a Shimadzu Ultra Fast Liquid Chromatograph. The eluted fractions were precipitated with trichloroacetic acid and washed with acetone. Cell extract fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10%) and the separated proteins transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes. The membranes were blocked overnight at 4 °C in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) and 5% nonfat milk and incubated for 2 h with the primary antibody anti-p53 (DO-1) (1:10,000). Next, the membranes were washed with TBS-T and incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:5,000) for 1 h. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL Western blotting Detection System (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The human breast epithelial carcinoma cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB 231 were washed twice with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline), fixed with formaldehyde solution (3.7%) and permeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.5%). The cells were then incubated with 5 mm ammonium chloride for 30 min, and nonspecific antigenic sites were blocked with PBS/BSA 3% (phosphate saline buffer/bovine serum albumin) for 2 h. The cells were simultaneously labeled with a mouse monoclonal anti-human p53 protein DO-1 primary antibody (1:200) and an anti-oligomer A11 primary antibody (1:1,000) for 2 h at room temperature. Next, the cells were incubated with anti-mouse Texas Red 561 and anti-rabbit IRDye® 680LT-conjugated secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature in a dark chamber. The cells were washed and analyzed using confocal laser scanning microscopy (LSM 510 Meta, Carl Zeiss Inc.). Previous studies have reported the buildup of p53 in tumor cells (9Levy C.B. Stumbo A.C.

To evaluate the mechanism of p53C aggregation in different environments, we initially characterized the aggregation kinetics of the wild-type and R248Q mutant forms of p53C at 37 °C and pH 7.2 or 5.0 (37T aggregate, Fig. 1). The aggregation into amyloid structures was monitored by measuring the binding of the protein to thioflavin T (ThT) (Fig. 1A), as ThT is known to bind both amyloid oligomers and fibrillar aggregates. Our results show that p53C is prone to form aggregates when incubated for 2 h at 37 °C (37T aggregate). The R248Q mutant aggregates to a larger extent than wild-type p53C when incubated at pH 7.2. Accordingly, there was higher Congo red binding of aggregated R248Q p53C than aggregated WT p53C at pH 7.2 (Fig. 2A). In addition, Congo red birefringence analysis evidenced the amyloid character of WT p53C and R248Q p53C aggregates (Fig. 2, B and C). However, both proteins aggregated less at pH 5.0 (Fig. 1, inset). The studies at low pH were prompted by our previous findings that p53 (mutant and wild-type) proteins form molten globules at pH 5.0 (24Bom A.P. Freitas M.S. Moreira F.S. Ferraz D. Sanches D.

https://openalex.org/W2073910094,"Past studies have shown that amplified insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)/IGF1 receptor (IGF1-R) signalling has an important role in colorectal cancer (CRC) development, progression and resistance to treatment. In this report, we demonstrate that downregulation of microRNA-497 (miR-497) as a result of DNA copy number reduction is involved in upregulation of IGF1-R in CRC cells. MiR-497 and miR-195 of the miR-15/16/195/424/497 family that share the same 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) binding seed sequence and are predicted to target IGF1-R were concurrently downregulated in the majority of CRC tissues relative to paired adjacent normal mucosa. However, only overexpression of miR-497 led to suppression of the IGF1-R 3′UTR activity and downregulation of the endogenous IGF1-R protein in CRC cells. This was associated with inhibition of cell survival, proliferation and invasion, and increased sensitivity to apoptosis induced by various stimuli including the chemotherapeutic drugs cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil, and the death ligand tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand. The biological effect of miR-497 on CRC cells was largely mediated by inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt signalling, as overexpression of an active form of Akt reversed its impact on cell survival and proliferation, recapitulating the effect of overexpression of IGF1-R. Downregulation of miR-497 and miR-195 appeared to associate with copy number loss of a segment of chromosome 17p13.1, where these miRs are located at proximity. Similarly to miR-195, the members of the same miR family, miR-424 that was upregulated, and miR-15a, miR-15b and miR-16 that were unaltered in expression in CRC tissues compared with paired adjacent normal mucosa, did not appear to have a role in regulating the expression of IGF1-R. Taken together, these results identify downregulation of miR-497 as an important mechanism of upregulation of IGF1-R in CRC cells that contributes to malignancy of CRC."

Methods/Principal Findings We performed a phase II, double blind, multicentre, placebo controlled trial of pioglitazone in ALS patients under riluzole. 219 patients were randomly assigned to receive 45 mg/day of pioglitazone or placebo (one: one allocation ratio). The primary endpoint was survival. Secondary endpoints included incidence of non-invasive ventilation and tracheotomy, and slopes of ALS-FRS, slow vital capacity, and quality of life as assessed using EUROQoL EQ-5D. The study was conducted under a two-stage group sequential test, allowing to stop for futility or superiority after interim analysis. Shortly after interim analysis, 30 patients under pioglitazone and 24 patients under placebo had died. The trial was stopped for futility; the hazard ratio for primary endpoint was 1.21 (95% CI: 0.71–2.07, p = 0.48). Secondary endpoints were not modified by pioglitazone treatment. Pioglitazone was well tolerated. Conclusion/Significance Pioglitazone has no beneficial effects on the survival of ALS patients as add-on therapy to riluzole.

Two of these, Sll1214 and Sll1874 from the cyanobacterium Synechocystis 6803, were FLAG-tagged in vivo and used as bait in separate pulldown experiments. Mass spectrometry identified Ycf54 as an interaction partner in each case, and this interaction was confirmed by a reciprocal pulldown using FLAG-tagged Ycf54 as bait. Inactivation of the ycf54 gene (slr1780) in Synechocystis 6803 resulted in a strain that exhibited significantly reduced Chl levels. A detailed analysis of Chl precursors in the ycf54 mutant revealed accumulation of very high levels of Mg-protoporphyrin IX methyl ester and only traces of protochlorophyllide, the product of the cyclase, were detected. Western blotting demonstrated that levels of the cyclase component Sll1214 and the Chl biosynthesis enzymes Mg-protoporphyrin IX methyltransferase and protochlorophyllide reductase are significantly impaired in the ycf54 mutant. Ycf54 is, therefore, essential for the activity and stability of the oxidative cyclase. We discuss a possible role of Ycf54 as an auxiliary factor essential for the assembly of a cyclase complex or even a large multienzyme catalytic center."
https://openalex.org/W2090937459,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) programs are essential in promoting breast cancer invasion, systemic dissemination and in arousing proliferative programs in breast cancer micrometastases, a reaction that is partially dependent on focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Many functions of FAK are shared by its homolog, protein tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2), raising the question as to whether Pyk2 also participates in driving the metastatic outgrowth of disseminated breast cancer cells. In addressing this question, we observed Pyk2 expression to be (i) significantly upregulated in recurrent human breast cancers; (ii) differentially expressed across clonal isolates of human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in a manner predictive for metastatic outgrowth, but not for invasiveness; and (iii) dramatically elevated in ex vivo cultures of breast cancer cells isolated from metastatic lesions as compared with cells that produced the primary tumor. We further show that metastatic human and murine breast cancer cells robustly upregulate their expression of Pyk2 during EMT programs stimulated by transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β). Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of Pyk2 demonstrated that the activity of this protein tyrosine kinase was dispensable for the ability of breast cancer cells to undergo invasion in response to TGF-β, and to form orthotopic mammary tumors in mice. In stark contrast, Pyk2-deficiency prevented TGF-β from stimulating the growth of breast cancer cells in 3D-organotypic cultures that recapitulated pulmonary microenvironments, as well as inhibited the metastatic outgrowth of disseminated breast cancer cells in the lungs of mice. Mechanistically, Pyk2 expression was inversely related to that of E-cadherin, such that elevated Pyk2 levels stabilized β1 integrin expression necessary to initiate the metastatic outgrowth of breast cancer cells. Thus, we have delineated novel functions for Pyk2 in mediating distinct elements of the EMT program and metastatic cascade regulated by TGF-β, particularly the initiation of secondary tumor outgrowth by disseminated cells."
https://openalex.org/W2129030385,"Despite the key role in neuronal development of a deficit in the methyl donor folate, little is known on the underlying mechanisms. We therefore studied the consequences of folate deficiency on proliferation, differentiation, and plasticity of the rat H19-7 hippocampal cell line. Folate deficit reduced proliferation (17%) and sensitized cells to differentiation-associated apoptosis (+16%). Decreased production (–58%) of S-adenosylmethionine (the universal substrate for transmethylation reactions) and increased expression of histone deacetylases (HDAC4,6,7) would lead to epigenomic changes that may impair the differentiation process. Cell polarity, vesicular transport, and synaptic plasticity were dramatically affected, with poor neurite outgrowth (–57%). Cell treatment by an HDAC inhibitor (SAHA) led to a noticeable improvement of cell polarity and morphology, with longer processes. Increased homocysteine levels (+55%) consecutive to folate shortage produced homocysteinylation, evidenced by coimmunoprecipitations and mass spectrometry, and aggregation of motor proteins dynein and kinesin, along with functional alterations, as reflected by reduced interactions with partner proteins. Prominent homocysteinylation of key neuronal proteins and subsequent aggregation certainly constitute major adverse effects of folate deficiency, affecting normal development with possible long-lasting consequences.—Akchiche, N., Bossenmeyer-Pourié, C., Kerek, R., Martin, N., Pourié, G., Koziel, V., Helle, D., Alberto, J.-M., Ortiou, S., Camadro, J.-M., Léger, T., Guéant, J.-L., Daval, J.-L.

https://openalex.org/W2019686407,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the commonest soft-tissue sarcoma in childhood and is characterized by expression of myogenic proteins, including the transcription factors MyoD and myogenin. There are two main subgroups, embryonal RMS and alveolar RMS (ARMS). Most ARMS are associated with chromosomal translocations that have breakpoints in introns of either PAX3 or PAX7, and FOXO1A. These translocations create chimeric transcription factors termed PAX3/FOXO1A and PAX7/FOXO1A respectively. Upon ectopic PAX3/FOXO1A expression, together with other genetic manipulation in mice, both differentiating myoblasts and satellite cells (the resident stem cells of postnatal muscle) can give rise to tumours with ARMS characteristics. As PAX3 and PAX7 are part of transcriptional networks that regulate muscle stem cell function in utero and during early postnatal life, PAX3/FOXO1A and PAX7/FOXO1A may subvert normal PAX3 and PAX7 functions. Here we examined how PAX3/FOXO1A and PAX7/FOXO1A affect myogenesis in satellite cells. PAX3/FOXO1A or PAX7/FOXO1A inhibited myogenin expression and prevented terminal differentiation in murine satellite cells: the same effect as dominant-negative (DN) Pax3 or Pax7 constructs. The transcription of MyoD-target genes myogenin and muscle creatine kinase were suppressed by PAX3/FOXO1A or PAX7/FOXO1A in C2C12 myogenic cells again as seen with Pax3/7DN. PAX3/FOXO1A or PAX7/FOXO1A did not inhibit the transcriptional activity of MyoD by perturbing MyoD expression, localization, phosphorylation or interaction with E-proteins. Chromatin immunoprecipitation on the myogenin promoter showed that PAX3/FOXO1A or PAX7/FOXO1A did not prevent MyoD from binding. However, PAX3/FOXO1A or PAX7/FOXO1A reduced occupation of the myogenin promoter by RNA polymerase II and decreased acetylation of histone H4, but did not directly bind to the myogenin promoter. Together, these observations reveal that PAX3/FOXO1A and PAX7/FOXO1A act to prevent myogenic differentiation via suppression of the transcriptional activation of MyoD-target genes."
https://openalex.org/W2068825318,"Background Fibromyalgia (FM) is a disorder characterized by chronic widespread pain and frequently associated with other symptoms. Patients with FM commonly report cognitive complaints, including memory problem. The objective of this study was to investigate the differences in neural correlates of working memory between FM patients and healthy subjects, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methodology/Principal Findings Nineteen FM patients and 22 healthy subjects performed an n-back memory task during MRI scan. Functional MRI data were analyzed using within- and between-group analysis. Both activated and deactivated brain regions during n-back task were evaluated. In addition, to investigate the possible effect of depression and anxiety, group analysis was also performed with depression and anxiety level in terms of Beck depression inventory (BDI) and Beck anxiety inventory (BAI) as a covariate. Between-group analyses, after controlling for depression and anxiety level, revealed that within the working memory network, inferior parietal cortex was strongly associated with the mild (r = 0.309, P = 0.049) and moderate (r = 0.331, P = 0.034) pain ratings. In addition, between-group comparison revealed that within the working memory network, the left DLPFC, right VLPFC, and right inferior parietal cortex were associated with the rating of depression and anxiety? Conclusions/Significance Our results suggest that the working memory deficit found in FM patients may be attributable to differences in neural activation of the frontoparietal memory network and may result from both pain itself and depression and anxiety associated with pain."
https://openalex.org/W1991173066,"Ubiquitination of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is required for downregulation of the receptor by endocytosis. Impairment of this pathway results in constitutively active EGFR, which is associated with carcinogenesis, particularly in lung cancer. We previously demonstrated that the deubiquitinating enzyme ubiquitin-specific protease 2a (USP2a) has oncogenic properties. Here, we show a new role for USP2a as a regulator of EGFR endocytosis. USP2a localizes to early endosomes and associates with EGFR, stabilizing the receptor, which retains active downstream signaling. HeLa cells transiently expressing catalytically active, but not mutant (MUT), USP2a show increased plasma membrane-localized EGFR, as well as decreased internalized and ubiquitinated EGFR. Conversely, USP2a silencing reverses this phenotype. Importantly, USP2a prevents the degradation of MUT in addition to wild-type EGFR. Finally, we observed that USP2a and EGFR proteins are coordinately overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancers. Taken together, our data indicate that USP2a antagonizes EGFR endocytosis and thus amplifies signaling activity from the receptor. Our findings suggest that regulation of deubiquitination could be exploited therapeutically in cancers overexpressing EGFR."
https://openalex.org/W1981877284,"GABA(A) receptors (GABA(A)-Rs) are localized at both synaptic and extrasynaptic sites, mediating phasic and tonic inhibition, respectively. Previous studies suggest an important role of γ2 and δ subunits in synaptic versus extrasynaptic targeting of GABA(A)-Rs. Here, we demonstrate differential function of α2 and α6 subunits in guiding the localization of GABA(A)-Rs. To study the targeting of specific subtypes of GABA(A)-Rs, we used a molecularly engineered GABAergic synapse model to precisely control the GABA(A)-R subunit composition. We found that in neuron-HEK cell heterosynapses, GABAergic events mediated by α2β3γ2 receptors were very fast (rise time ∼2 ms), whereas events mediated by α6β3δ receptors were very slow (rise time ∼20 ms). Such an order of magnitude difference in rise time could not be attributed to the minute differences in receptor kinetics. Interestingly, synaptic events mediated by α6β3 or α6β3γ2 receptors were significantly slower than those mediated by α2β3 or α2β3γ2 receptors, suggesting a differential role of α subunit in receptor targeting. This was confirmed by differential targeting of the same δ-γ2 chimeric subunits to synaptic or extrasynaptic sites, depending on whether it was co-assembled with the α2 or α6 subunit. In addition, insertion of a gephyrin-binding site into the intracellular domain of α6 and δ subunits brought α6β3δ receptors closer to synaptic sites. Therefore, the α subunits, together with the γ2 and δ subunits, play a critical role in governing synaptic versus extrasynaptic targeting of GABA(A)-Rs, possibly through differential interactions with gephyrin."
https://openalex.org/W2031321072,"It is well known that an important step toward understanding the functions of a protein is to determine its subcellular location. Although numerous prediction algorithms have been developed, most of them typically focused on the proteins with only one location. In recent years, researchers have begun to pay attention to the subcellular localization prediction of the proteins with multiple sites. However, almost all the existing approaches have failed to take into account the correlations among the locations caused by the proteins with multiple sites, which may be the important information for improving the prediction accuracy of the proteins with multiple sites. In this paper, a new algorithm which can effectively exploit the correlations among the locations is proposed by using gaussian process model. Besides, the algorithm also can realize optimal linear combination of various feature extraction technologies and could be robust to the imbalanced data set. Experimental results on a human protein data set show that the proposed algorithm is valid and can achieve better performance than the existing approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2040900595,"Activation of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels is facilitated in vivo by direct binding of the second messenger cAMP. This process plays a fundamental role in the fine-tuning of HCN channel activity and is critical for the modulation of cardiac and neuronal rhythmicity. Here, we identify the pyrimidine cyclic nucleotide cCMP as another regulator of HCN channels. We demonstrate that cCMP shifts the activation curves of two members of the HCN channel family, HCN2 and HCN4, to more depolarized voltages. Moreover, cCMP speeds up activation and slows down deactivation kinetics of these channels. The two other members of the HCN channel family, HCN1 and HCN3, are not sensitive to cCMP. The modulatory effect of cCMP is reversible and requires the presence of a functional cyclic nucleotide-binding domain. We determined an EC50 value of ∼30 μm for cCMP compared with 1 μm for cAMP. Notably, cCMP is a partial agonist of HCN channels, displaying an efficacy of ∼0.6. cCMP increases the frequency of pacemaker potentials from isolated sinoatrial pacemaker cells in the presence of endogenous cAMP concentrations. Electrophysiological recordings indicated that this increase is caused by a depolarizing shift in the activation curve of the native HCN current, which in turn leads to an enhancement of the slope of the diastolic depolarization of sinoatrial node cells. In conclusion, our findings establish cCMP as a gating regulator of HCN channels and indicate that this cyclic nucleotide has to be considered in HCN channel-regulated processes.

https://openalex.org/W1971787902,"The diet of free-ranging carnivores is an important part of their ecology. It is often determined from prey remains in scats. In many cases, scat analyses are the most efficient method but they require correction for potential biases. When the diet is expressed as proportions of consumed mass of each prey species, the consumed prey mass to excrete one scat needs to be determined and corrected for prey body mass because the proportion of digestible to indigestible matter increases with prey body mass. Prey body mass can be corrected for by conducting feeding experiments using prey of various body masses and fitting a regression between consumed prey mass to excrete one scat and prey body mass (correction factor 1). When the diet is expressed as proportions of consumed individuals of each prey species and includes prey animals not completely consumed, the actual mass of each prey consumed by the carnivore needs to be controlled for (correction factor 2). No previous study controlled for this second bias.Here we use an extended series of feeding experiments on a large carnivore, the cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus), to establish both correction factors. In contrast to previous studies which fitted a linear regression for correction factor 1, we fitted a biologically more meaningful exponential regression model where the consumed prey mass to excrete one scat reaches an asymptote at large prey sizes. Using our protocol, we also derive correction factor 1 and 2 for other carnivore species and apply them to published studies. We show that the new method increases the number and proportion of consumed individuals in the diet for large prey animals compared to the conventional method.Our results have important implications for the interpretation of scat-based studies in feeding ecology and the resolution of human-wildlife conflicts for the conservation of large carnivores."
https://openalex.org/W1993380739,"Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) progresses from a chronic to a blastic phase where the leukemic cells are proliferative and undifferentiated. The CML is nowadays successfully treated with BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors as imatinib and dasatinib. In the CML-derived K562 cell line, low concentrations of imatinib induce proliferative arrest and erythroid differentiation. We found that imatinib upregulated the cell cycle inhibitor p27(KIP1) (p27) in a time- and -concentration dependent manner, and that the extent of imatinib-mediated differentiation was severely decreased in cells with depleted p27. MYC (c-Myc) is a transcription factor frequently deregulated in human cancer. MYC is overexpressed in untreated CML and is associated to poor response to imatinib. Using K562 sublines with conditional MYC expression (induced by Zn(2+) or activated by 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen) we show that MYC prevented the erythroid differentiation induced by imatinib and dasatinib. The differentiation inhibition is not due to increased proliferation of MYC-expressing clones or enhanced apoptosis of differentiated cells. As p27 overexpression is reported to induce erythroid differentiation in K562, we explored the effect of MYC on imatinib-dependent induction of p27. We show that MYC abrogated the imatinib-induced upregulation of p27 concomitantly with the differentiation inhibition, suggesting that MYC inhibits differentiation by antagonizing the imatinib-mediated upregulation of p27. This effect occurs mainly by p27 protein destabilization. This was in part due to MYC-dependent induction of SKP2, a component of the ubiquitin ligase complex that targets p27 for degradation. The results suggest that, although MYC deregulation does not directly confer resistance to imatinib, it might be a factor that contributes to progression of CML through the inhibition of differentiation."

Hepatic G5G8 is transcriptionally regulated by a number of factors implicated in the development of insulin resistance and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Therefore, we hypothesized that G5G8 may influence the development of diet-induced obesity phenotypes independently of its role in opposing phytosterol absorption. G5G8 knock-out (KO) mice and their wild type (WT) littermates were challenged with a plant sterol-free low fat or high fat (HF) diet. Weight gain and the rise in fasting glucose were accelerated in G5G8 KO mice following HF feeding. HF-fed G5G8 KO mice had increased liver weight, hepatic lipids, and plasma alanine aminotransferase compared with WT controls. Consistent with the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, macrophage infiltration, the number of TUNEL-positive cells, and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines were also increased in G5G8 KO mice. Hepatic lipid accumulation was associated with increased peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ, CD36, and fatty acid uptake. Phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eiF2α) and expression of activating transcription factor 4 and tribbles 3 were elevated in HF-fed G5G8 KO mice, a pathway that links the unfolded protein response to the development of insulin resistance through inhibition of protein kinase B (Akt) phosphorylation. Phosphorylation of Akt and insulin receptor was reduced, whereas serine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 was elevated."
https://openalex.org/W2085401216,"Packaging of viral genomes into preformed procapsids requires the controlled and synchronized activity of an ATPase and a genome-processing nuclease, both located in the large terminase (L-terminase) subunit. In this paper, we have characterized the structure and regulation of bacteriophage P22 L-terminase (gp2). Limited proteolysis reveals a bipartite organization consisting of an N-terminal ATPase core flexibly connected to a C-terminal nuclease domain. The 2.02 Å crystal structure of P22 headful nuclease obtained by in-drop proteolysis of full-length L-terminase (FL-L-terminase) reveals a central seven-stranded β-sheet core that harbors two magnesium ions. Modeling studies with DNA suggest that the two ions are poised for two-metal ion-dependent catalysis, but the nuclease DNA binding surface is sterically hindered by a loop-helix (L(1)-α(2)) motif, which is incompatible with catalysis. Accordingly, the isolated nuclease is completely inactive in vitro, whereas it exhibits endonucleolytic activity in the context of FL-L-terminase. Deleting the autoinhibitory L(1)-α(2) motif (or just the loop L(1)) restores nuclease activity to a level comparable with FL-L-terminase. Together, these results suggest that the activity of P22 headful nuclease is regulated by intramolecular cross-talk with the N-terminal ATPase domain. This cross-talk allows for precise and controlled cleavage of DNA that is essential for genome packaging."
https://openalex.org/W1965771646,"JunB, an activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factor component, acts either as a tumor suppressor or as an oncogene depending on the cell context. In particular, JunB is strongly upregulated in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) where it enhances cell proliferation. Although its overexpression is linked to lymphomagenesis, the mechanisms whereby JunB promotes neoplastic growth are still largely obscure. Here, we show that JunB undergoes coordinated phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitylation during the G2 phase of the cell cycle. We characterized a critical consensus phospho-degron that controls JunB turnover and identified GSK3 and SCFFBXW7 as, respectively, the kinase and the E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for its degradation in G2. Pharmacological or genetic inactivation of the GSK3-FBXW7-JunB axis induced accumulation of JunB in G2/M and entailed transcriptional repression of the DNA helicase DDX11, leading to premature sister chromatid separation. This abnormal phenotype due to dysregulation of the GSK3β/JunB/DDX11 pathway is phenocopied in ALK-positive ALCL. Thus, our results reveal a novel mechanism by which mitosis progression and chromatid cohesion are regulated through GSK3/SCFFBXW7-mediated proteolysis of JunB, and suggest that JunB proteolysis in G2 is an essential step in maintaining genetic fidelity during mitosis."
https://openalex.org/W2031067320,"The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor is a major target of ethanol in the brain. Previous studies have identified positions in the third and fourth membrane-associated (M) domains of the NMDA receptor GluN1 and GluN2A subunits that influence alcohol sensitivity. The predicted structure of the NMDA receptor, based on that of the related GluA2 subunit, indicates a close apposition of the alcohol-sensitive positions in M3 and M4 between the two subunit types. We tested the hypothesis that these positions interact to regulate receptor kinetics and ethanol sensitivity by using dual substitution mutants. In single-substitution mutants, we found that a position in both subunits adjacent to one previously identified, GluN1(Gly-638) and GluN2A(Phe-636), can strongly regulate ethanol sensitivity. Significant interactions affecting ethanol inhibition and receptor deactivation were observed at four pairs of positions in GluN1/GluN2A: Gly-638/Met-823, Phe-639/Leu-824, Met-818/Phe-636, and Leu-819/Phe-637; the latter pair also interacted with respect to desensitization. Two interactions involved a position in M4 of both subunits, GluN1(Met-818) and GluN2A(Leu-824), that does not by itself alter ethanol sensitivity, whereas a previously identified ethanol-sensitive position, GluN2A(Ala-825), did not unequivocally interact with any other position tested. These results also indicate a shift by one position of the predicted alignment of the GluN1 M4 domain. These findings have allowed for the refinement of the NMDA receptor M domain structure, demonstrate that this region can influence apparent agonist affinity, and support the existence of four sites of alcohol action on the NMDA receptor, each consisting of five amino acids at the M3-M4 domain intersubunit interfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1982448421,"The RNA-binding protein (RBP) RNPC1 is a target of the p53 family and forms a feedback regulatory loop with the p53 family proteins. The murine double minute-2 (MDM2) oncogene, a key negative regulator of p53, has a critical role in a variety of fundamental cellular processes. MDM2 expression is found to be regulated via gene amplification, transcription, protein translation and protein stability. In the current study, we reported a novel regulation of MDM2 by RNPC1 via mRNA stability. Specifically, we found that overexpression of RNPC1 decreases, whereas knockdown or knockout of RNPC1 increases, the level of MDM2 transcript and protein independent of p53. To uncover the underlying mechanism, we found that RNPC1 is able to destabilize the MDM2 transcript via binding to multiple AU-/U-rich elements in MDM2 3′untranslated region (3′UTR). Consistent with this, we showed that RNPC1 inhibits expression of exogenous MDM2 from an expression vector as long as the vector contains an AU-/U-rich element from MDM2 3′UTR. Finally, we showed that the RNA-binding activity of RNPC1 is required for binding to MDM2 transcript and consequently, for inhibiting MDM2 expression. Together, we uncover a novel regulation of MDM2 by the RBP RNPC1 via mRNA stability."
https://openalex.org/W2060505007,"The DNA damage response encompasses a complex series of signaling pathways that function to regulate and facilitate the repair of damaged DNA. Recent studies have shown that the repair of transcriptionally inactive chromatin, named heterochromatin, is dependent upon the phosphorylation of the co-repressor, Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain-associated protein (KAP-1), by the ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase. Co-repressors, such as KAP-1, function to regulate the rigid structure of heterochromatin by recruiting histone-modifying enzymes, such HDAC1/2, SETDB1, and nucleosome-remodeling complexes such as CHD3. Here, we have characterized a phosphorylation site in the HP1-binding domain of KAP-1, Ser-473, which is phosphorylated by the cell cycle checkpoint kinase Chk2. Expression of a nonphosphorylatable S473A mutant conferred cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents and led to defective repair of DNA double-strand breaks in heterochromatin. In addition, cells expressing S473A also displayed defective mobilization of the HP1-β chromodomain protein. The DNA repair defect observed in cells expressing S473A was alleviated by depletion of HP1-β, suggesting that phosphorylation of KAP-1 on Ser-473 promotes the mobilization of HP1-β from heterochromatin and subsequent DNA repair. These results suggest a novel mechanism of KAP-1-mediated chromatin restructuring via Chk2-regulated HP1-β exchange from heterochromatin, promoting DNA repair."
https://openalex.org/W1998895310,"N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are glutamate ionotropic receptors that play critical roles in synaptic transmission, plasticity, and excitotoxicity. The functional NMDA receptors, heterotetramers composed mainly of two NR1 and two NR2 subunits, likely pass endoplasmic reticulum quality control before they are released from the endoplasmic reticulum and trafficked to the cell surface. However, the mechanism underlying this process is not clear. Using truncated and mutated NMDA receptor subunits expressed in heterologous cells, we found that the M3 domains of both NR1 and NR2 subunits contain key amino acid residues that contribute to the regulation of the number of surface functional NMDA receptors. These key residues are critical neither for the interaction between the NR1 and NR2 subunits nor for the formation of the functional receptors, but rather they regulate the early trafficking of the receptors. We also found that the identified key amino acid residues within both NR1 and NR2 M3 domains contribute to the regulation of the surface expression of unassembled NR1 and NR2 subunits. Thus, our data identify the unique role of the membrane domains in the regulation of the number of surface NMDA receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2094378947,"Protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 14 (PTPN14) is frequently mutated in a variety of human cancers. However, the cell signaling pathways regulated by PTPN14 largely remain to be elucidated. Here, we identify a list of potential substrates of PTPN14 using a phospho-proteomic approach. We show that p130 Crk-associated substrate (p130Cas) is a direct substrate of PTPN14 and that PTPN14 specifically regulates p130Cas phosphorylation at tyrosine residue 128 (Y128) in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. We engineered CRC cells homozygous for a p130Cas Y128F knock-in mutant and found that these cells exhibit significantly reduced migration and colony formation, impaired anchorage-independent growth, slower xenograft tumor growth in nude mice and have decreased phosphorylation of AKT. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SRC phosphorylates p130Cas Y128 and that CRC cell lines harboring high levels of pY128Cas are more sensitive to SRC family kinase inhibitor Dasatinib. These findings suggest that p130Cas Y128 phosphorylation may be exploited as a predictive marker for Dasatinib response in cancer patients. In aggregate, our studies reveal a novel signaling pathway that has an important role in colorectal tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2000678583,"Dual specificity protein kinases (DSPKs) are unique enzymes that can execute multiple functions in the cell, which are otherwise performed exclusively by serine/threonine and tyrosine protein kinases. In this study, we have characterized the protein kinases Bas2152 (PrkD) and Bas2037 (PrkG) from Bacillus anthracis. Transcriptional analyses of these kinases showed that they are expressed in all phases of growth. In a serendipitous discovery, both kinases were found to be DSPKs. PrkD was found to be similar to the eukaryotic dual specificity Tyr phosphorylation-regulated kinase class of dual specificity kinases, which autophosphorylates on Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues and phosphorylates Ser and Thr residues on substrates. PrkG was found to be a bona fide dual specificity protein kinase that mediates autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation on Ser, Thr, and Tyr residues. The sites of phosphorylation in both of the kinases were identified through mass spectrometry. Phosphorylation on Tyr residues regulates the kinase activity of PrkD and PrkG. PrpC, the only known Ser/Thr protein phosphatase, was also found to possess dual specificity. Genistein, a known Tyr kinase inhibitor, was found to inhibit the activities of PrkD and PrkG and affect the growth of B. anthracis cells, indicating a possible role of these kinases in cell growth and development. In addition, the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase was found to be phosphorylated by PrkD on Ser and Thr residues but not by PrkG. Thus, this study provides the first evidence of DSPKs in B. anthracis that belong to different classes and have different modes of regulation."

Development of a test to detect acute infection at the point-of-care is urgent.Volunteers enrolled in a prospective study of HIV incidence in four African cities, Kigali in Rwanda and Ndola, Kitwe and Lusaka in Zambia, were tested regularly for HIV by rapid antibody test and p24 antigen ELISA. Five subgroups of samples were also tested by the Determine Ag/Ab Combo test 1) Antigen positive, antibody negative (acute infection); 2) Antigen positive, antibody positive; 3) Antigen negative, antibody positive; 4) Antigen negative, antibody negative; and 5) Antigen false positive, antibody negative (HIV uninfected). A sixth group included serial dilutions from a p24 antigen-positive control sample. Combo test results were reported as antigen positive, antibody positive, or both.Of 34 group 1 samples with VL between 5x105 and >1.5x107 copies/mL (median 3.5x106), 1 (2.9%) was detected by the Combo antigen component, 7 (20.6%) others were positive by the Combo antibody component. No group 2 samples were antigen positive by the Combo test (0/18). Sensitivity of the Combo antigen test was therefore 1.9% (1/52, 95% CI 0.0, 9.9). One false positive Combo antibody result (1/30, 3.3%) was observed in group 4. No false-positive Combo antigen results were observed. The Combo antigen test was positive in group 6 at concentrations of 80 pg/mL, faintly positive at 40 and 20 pg/mL, and negative thereafter. The p24 ELISA antigen test remained positive at 5 pg/mL.Although the antibody component of the Combo test detected antibodies to HIV earlier than the comparison antibody tests used, less than 2% of the cases of antigen-positive HIV infection were detected by the Combo antigen component. The development of a rapid point-of-care test to diagnose acute HIV infection remains an urgent goal."

PTPN11 encodes SHP2, an Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase that positively modulates RAS function. Here, we characterized functionally all possible amino acid substitutions arising from single-base changes affecting codons 62 and 63 to explore the molecular mechanisms lying behind the largely invariant occurrence of the Y62D and Y63C substitutions recurring in Noonan syndrome. We provide structural and biochemical data indicating that the autoinhibitory interaction between the N-SH2 and protein-tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) domains is perturbed in both mutants as a result of an extensive structural rearrangement of the N-SH2 domain. Most mutations affecting Tyr63 exerted an unpredicted disrupting effect on the structure of the N-SH2 phosphopeptide-binding cleft mediating the interaction of SHP2 with signaling partners. Among all the amino acid changes affecting that codon, the disease-causing mutation was the only substitution that perturbed the stability of the inactive conformation of SHP2 without severely impairing proper phosphopeptide binding of N-SH2. On the other hand, the disruptive effect of the Y62D change on the autoinhibited conformation of the protein was balanced, in part, by less efficient binding properties of the mutant.

SHP2 is composed of two tandemly arranged N-terminal Src homology 2 (SH2) domains (N-SH2 and C-SH2), a catalytic domain (PTP), and a C-terminal tail with a role that is still not well characterized. The N-SH2 and C-SH2 domains control the subcellular localization and functional regulation of SHP2, with the former acting as an allosteric switch with two spatially nonoverlapping sites involved in an intramolecular inhibitory interaction with the PTP domain and in binding to phosphotyrosyl- (pY-) containing signaling partners (7Hof P.

In most cases, lesions affect residues involved in the N-SH2/PTP interdomain binding network that stabilizes SHP2 in its autoinhibited state and up-regulate the function of SHP2 by perturbing the switching between the active and inactive conformations, favoring a shift in the equilibrium toward the former. There are, however, mutations affecting residues located far from the N-SH2/PTP-interacting surface. Among them, a few involve residues placed in the phosphopeptide-binding cleft of each SH2 domain and promote a gain of function of the enzyme by increasing binding affinity for pY-containing signaling partners or alter their binding specificity to those proteins. Of note, there are mutations that affect residues located within the PTP domain contributing to the stability of the catalytically inactive conformation but also participating in catalysis or controlling substrate specificity. For some of these NS-causing defects, biochemical data indicate that those substitutions favor protein activation by promoting dissociation of the N-SH2 and PTP domains without any substantial perturbing effect on catalysis.

Such an invariant occurrence of mutations can be ascribed to diverse driving forces due to either selection-by-function or site-specific increased mutability (11Martinelli S. Torreri P. Tinti M.

Here, by determining the biochemical behavior of all possible substitutions arising from single-base changes affecting codons 62 and 63, we explored the molecular mechanisms lying behind the largely invariant occurrence of the NS-causing Y62D and Y63C amino acid changes. We show that the autoinhibitory interaction between the N-SH2 and PTP domains is perturbed in both mutants as a result of an unanticipated extensive structural rearrangement of the N-SH2 domain rather than a consequence of a local effect. Our data also indicate that replacement of Tyr63 has an unexpected disruptive effect on the structure of the N-SH2 phosphopeptide-binding pocket implicated in the interaction of SHP2 with signaling partners and that the disease-causing mutation is the only substitution among all possible amino acid changes at that codon that perturbs the stability of the inactive conformation of SHP2 without severely impairing proper binding of N-SH2 to the phosphopeptide. On the other hand, the Y62D change is the only substitution at that codon destabilizing the autoinhibited conformation of SHP2, although such disruptive effect is balanced, in part, by less efficient binding properties of the mutant. Overall, our findings document that the selection-by-function mechanism acting as driving force for mutations affecting codon 62 and 63 implies the existence of counteracting effects operating on the allosteric control of the function of SHP2. The full-length human polyHis-tagged PTPN11 cDNA was cloned in a pET-26b vector (Novagen) using the HindIII and XhoI restriction sites.

The linearized Poisson-Boltzmann equation was solved by the automatically configured sequential focusing multigrid algorithm, considering a dielectric constant of 2 and 78.54 for the solute and the solvent, respectively, with single Debye-Hückel boundary conditions, a probe radius of 1.4 Å, and a temperature of 300 K. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed using GROMACS 4.0.4 (22Hess B. Kutzner C. van der Spoel D. Lindahl E.

Rotamers with the lowest energy score were selected. The N and C termini of the protein were assumed to be charged. Protein was centered in a triclinic box and hydrated with more than 5,000 water molecules. The system equilibration was performed by a two-step energy minimization, first restraining all protein atoms to their positions and then removing the restraints. Following initial energy minimizations and a 100-ps MD run during which the protein atoms were position-restrained, the temperature of solute and solvent was raised to 300 K in a stepwise manner, performing four MD runs, 50 ps each, at different temperatures (50, 100, 200, and 250 K). Electrostatic interactions were calculated using the particle mesh Ewald method and a 1.2-nm cut-off radius for the real part calculation. van der Waals interactions were calculated using a cut-off radius (1.2 nm). The simple point charge model was used for water (25Berendsen H.J. Postma J.P. van Gunsteren W.F. Hermans J. Interaction Models for Water in Relation to Protein Hydration.in: Pullman B. Intermolecular Forces. Reidel Publishing Company, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1981: 331-342Crossref Google Scholar), and water geometry was constrained with the SETTLE algorithm (26Miyamoto S.

A Berendsen thermostat, with a coupling constant of 0.1 ps, was applied in all simulations (27Berendsen H.J. Postma J.P. van Gunsteren W.F. Di Nola A. Haak J.R. Molecular dynamics with coupling to an external bath.J. Chem. Phys. 1984; 81: 3684-3690Crossref Scopus (23436) Google Scholar), and the reference temperature was set to 300 K, except where stated otherwise. Pressure coupling was applied employing the Berendsen scheme, with a time constant of 1.0 ps, a reference pressure of 1 bar, and a compressibility of 4.5 10−5 bar−1. Bond lengths were constrained with the LINCS algorithm (28Hess B. Bekker H. Berendsen H.J. Fraaije J.G. LINCS: a linear constraint solver for molecular simulations.J. Comp. Chem. 1997; 18: 1463-1472Crossref Scopus (11560) Google Scholar). Simulations were run with a 2-fs time step and were at least 100 ns long. Translational and rotational motions of the protein were removed by least square fitting the positions of the Cα carbon atoms of the most rigid residues in the protein (residues 6–8, 27–32, 42–46, 52–57, 75–80, and 97–102) to their starting coordinates. To evaluate the conformational variations of loop DE (residues 60–63), the distance between the center of mass of the DE loop backbone and the center of mass of the backbone of residues 75–77 of helix B was calculated. Root mean square positional fluctuations of Cα atoms were calculated according to standard definitions, between 15 and 100 ns. Molecular graphics were obtained with MOLMOL (29Koradi R. Billeter M.

Intrinsic fluorescence spectra were measured on a Fluoromax 2 fluorometer (Horiba), with excitation at 295 nm and 3-nm band pass. Emission spectra were collected between 305 and 400 nm, and background was subtracted. The protein was dissolved in a 5 mm HEPES buffer, 75 mm NaCl (pH 7.2), at a 5 μm concentration, in a 3 × 3-mm path length cell. Temperature was controlled with a thermal bath to 20.0 ± 0.1 °C. After the addition of the chaotropic agent guanidinium chloride (Fluka), equilibration of the system was ensured by acquiring multiple spectra until no further changes were observed. Surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed using a BIAcoreX instrument (BIAcore International AB) equipped with two flow-cell sensor chips. Biotinylated BTAM peptide (100 μg/ml) or the monophosphorylated N-terminal portion of that peptide (GGGGDIT(pY)ADLNLPKGKK) was resuspended in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P20 and injected over a streptavidin-coated sensor chip, at a flow rate of 10 ml/min for 2 min, to obtain an immobilization level of 800 resonance units. The biotin molecule was linked to the N terminus of the peptide by a stretch of polyglycine. Wild-type and mutant polyHis-tagged N-SH2 domains were resuspended in the same buffer and applied at a concentration of 500 nm, with a flow rate of 30 ml/min. The amount of protein bound to the sensor chip was monitored by the change in refractive index, given in arbitrary response units, at 25 °C, as a function of time. At the end of the sample plug, the buffer was passed over a sensor surface to allow dissociation. The sensor surface was regenerated for the next sample using a 2-μl pulse of 35 mm NaOH. As a control, no binding was observed when polypeptides were run on the flow-cell sensor chip with immobilized biotin. Chip arrays used to characterize the N-SH2 recognition specificity consisted of 6,057 13-mers, each displaying a phosphorylated tyrosine residue at position 7 (31Sacco F. Tinti M. Palma A. Ferrari E.

https://openalex.org/W1979445595,"Metastatic cell migration and invasion are regulated by altered adhesion-mediated signaling to the actin-based cytoskeleton via activated Src-FAK complexes. Src-suppressed C-kinase substrate (SSeCKS, the rodent orthologue of human Gravin/AKAP12), whose expression is downregulated by oncogenic Src and in many human cancers, antagonizes oncogenic Src pathways including those driving neovascularization at metastatic sites, metastatic cell motility and invasiveness. This is likely manifested through its function as a scaffolder of F-actin and signaling proteins such as cyclins, calmodulin, protein kinase C and A. Here we show that in contrast to its ability to inhibit haptotaxis, SSeCKS increased prostate cancer cell adhesion to fibronectin and type I collagen in a FAK-dependent manner, correlating with a relative increase in FAK(poY397) levels. In contrast, SSeCKS suppressed adhesion-induced Src activation (Src(poY416)) and phosphorylation of FAK at Y925, a known Src substrate site. SSeCKS also induced increased cell spreading, cell flattening, integrin β1 clustering and formation of mature focal adhesion plaques. An in silico analysis identified a Src-binding domain on SSeCKS(aa 153-166) that is homologous to the Src-binding domain of caveolin-1, and this region is required for SSeCKS-Src interaction, for SSeCKS-enhanced Src activity and sequestration to lipid rafts and for SSeCKS-enhanced adhesion of MAT-LyLu and CWR22Rv1 prostate cancer cells. Our data suggest a model in which SSeCKS suppresses oncogenic motility by sequestering Src to caveolin-rich lipid rafts, thereby disengaging Src from FAK-associated adhesion and signaling complexes."

We investigated the role of P2 purinoreceptors in the induction of BDNF expression in synovial fibroblasts (SF) of OA and RA patients. Cultured SF from patients with symptomatic knee OA and RA were stimulated with purinoreceptor agonists ATP, ADP, or UTP. The expression of BDNF mRNA was measured by quantitative TaqMan PCR. BDNF release into cell culture supernatants was monitored by ELISA. P2X4 expression in synovial tissue was detected by immunohistochemistry. Endogenous P2X4 expression was decreased by siRNA transfection before ATP stimulation. Kinase pathways were blocked before ATP stimulation. BDNF mRNA expression levels in OASF were increased 2 h and 5 h after ATP stimulation. Mean BDNF levels in cell culture supernatants of unstimulated OASF and RASF were 19 (±9) and 67 (±49) pg/ml, respectively. BDNF levels in SF supernatants were only elevated 5 h after ATP stimulation. BDNF mRNA expression in OASF was induced both by P2X receptor agonists ATP and ADP, but not by UTP, an agonist of P2Y purinergic receptors. The ATP-induced BDNF mRNA expression in OASF was decreased by siRNA-mediated reduction of endogenous P2X4 levels compared to scrambled controls. Inhibition of p38, but not p44/42 signalling reduced the ATP-mediated BDNF mRNA induction. Here we show a functional role of the purinergic receptor P2X4 and p38 kinase in the ATP-induced expression and release of the neurotrophin BDNF in SF."
https://openalex.org/W2148489701,"Hyper-IgM syndrome type 2 stems from mutations in activation-induced deoxycytidine deaminase (AID) that abolish immunoglobulin class-switch recombination, causing an accumulation of IgM and absence of IgG, IgA, and IgE isotypes. Although hyper-IgM syndrome type 2 is rare, the 23 missense mutations identified in humans span almost the entire gene for AID resulting in a recessive phenotype. Using high resolution x-ray structures for Apo3G-CD2 as a surrogate for AID, we identify three classes of missense mutants as follows: catalysis (class I), substrate interaction (class II), and structural integrity (class III). Each mutant was expressed and purified from insect cells and compared biochemically to wild type (WT) AID. Four point mutants retained catalytic activity at 1/3rd to 1/200th the level of WT AID. These ""active"" point mutants mimic the behavior of WT AID for motif recognition specificity, deamination spectra, and high deamination processivity. We constructed a series of C-terminal deletion mutants (class IV) that retain catalytic activity and processivity for deletions ≤18 amino acids, with ΔC(10) and ΔC(15) having 2-3-fold higher specific activities than WT AID. Deleting 19 C-terminal amino acids inactivates AID. WT AID and active and inactive point mutants bind cooperatively to single-stranded DNA (Hill coefficients ∼1.7-3.2) with microscopic dissociation constant values (K(A)) ranging between 10 and 250 nm. Active C-terminal deletion mutants bind single-stranded DNA noncooperatively with K(A) values similar to wild type AID. A structural analysis is presented that shows how localized defects in different regions of AID can contribute to loss of catalytic function."
https://openalex.org/W1971981919,"In yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and plant roots (Arabidopsis thaliana) zinc enters the cells via influx transporters of the ZIP family. Since zinc is both essential for cell function and toxic at high concentrations, tight regulation is essential for cell viability. We provide new insight into the underlying mechanisms, starting from a general model based on ordinary differential equations and adapting it to the specific cases of yeast and plant root cells. In yeast, zinc is transported by the transporters ZRT1 and ZRT2, which are both regulated by the zinc-responsive transcription factor ZAP1. Using biological data, parameters were estimated and analyzed, confirming the different affinities of ZRT1 and ZRT2 reported in the literature. Furthermore, our model suggests that the positive feedback in ZAP1 production has a stabilizing function at high influx rates. In plant roots, various ZIP transporters play a role in zinc uptake. Their regulation is largely unknown, but bZIP transcription factors are thought to be involved. We set up three putative models based on: an activator only, an activator with dimerization and an activator-inhibitor pair. These were fitted to measurements and analyzed. Simulations show that the activator-inhibitor model outperforms the other two in providing robust and stable homeostasis at reasonable parameter ranges."
https://openalex.org/W1993191575,"Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (ARMS) is an aggressive childhood cancer of striated muscle characterized by the presence of the PAX3–FOXO1A or PAX7–FOXO1A chimeric oncogenic transcription factor. Identification of their targets is essential for understanding ARMS pathogenesis. To this aim, we analyzed transcriptomic data from rhabdomyosarcoma samples and found that P-cadherin expression is correlated with PAX3/7–FOXO1A presence. We then show that expression of a PAX3 dominant negative variant inhibits P-cadherin expression in ARMS cells. Using mouse models carrying modified Pax3 alleles, we demonstrate that P-cadherin is expressed in the dermomyotome and lies genetically downstream from the myogenic factor Pax3. Moreover, in vitro gel shift analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation indicate that the P-cadherin gene is a direct transcriptional target for PAX3/7–FOXO1A. Finally, P-cadherin expression in normal myoblasts inhibits myogenesis and induces myoblast transformation, migration and invasion. Conversely, P-cadherin downregulation by small hairpin RNA decreases the transformation, migration and invasive potential of ARMS cells. P-cadherin also favors cadherin switching, which is a hallmark of metastatic progression, by controlling N- and M-cadherin expression and/or localization. Our findings demonstrate that P-cadherin is a direct PAX3–FOXO1A transcriptional target involved in ARMS aggressiveness. Therefore, P-cadherin emerges as a new and attractive target for therapeutic intervention in ARMS."

The reconstructed GalNAc/GalN utilization pathways include multiple novel genes with specific functional roles. Most of the pathway variations were attributed to the amino sugar transport, phosphorylation, and deacetylation steps, whereas the downstream catabolic enzymes in the pathway were largely conserved. The predicted GalNAc kinase AgaK, the novel variant of GalNAc-6-phosphate deacetylase AgaA(II) and the GalN-6-phosphate deaminase AgaS from Shewanella sp. ANA-3 were validated in vitro using individual enzymatic assays and reconstitution of the three-step pathway. By using genetic techniques, we confirmed that AgaS but not AgaI functions as the main GalN-6-P deaminase in the GalNAc/GalN utilization pathway in Escherichia coli. Regulons controlled by AgaR repressors were reconstructed by bioinformatics in most proteobacterial genomes encoding GalNAc pathways. Candidate AgaR-binding motifs share a common sequence with consensus CTTTC that was found in multiple copies and arrangements in regulatory regions of aga genes.

https://openalex.org/W2104500888,"Cancer patients often suffer from local tumor recurrence after radiation therapy. Some intracellular and extracellular factors, such as activity of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), cell cycle status and oxygen availability, have been suggested to affect DNA damage responses and eventual radioresistant characteristics of cancer cells. But when, where, and how these factors affect one another and induce cellular radioresistance is largely unknown. Here, we analyzed mechanistic and spatio-temporal relationships among them in highly heterogeneous tumor microenvironments. Experiments in vitro demonstrated that a decrease in the glucose concentration reduced the transcriptional activity of HIF-1 and expression of a downstream gene for the cell cycle regulator p27(Kip1) even under hypoxic conditions. Then, the proportion of cells in the radioresistant S phase increased, whereas that in the radiosensitive G1 phase decreased, significantly. Immunohistochemical analyses showed that cancer cells in perinecrotic hypoxic regions, which should be under low-glucose conditions, expressed little HIF-1α, and therefore, were mainly in S phase and less damaged by radiation treatment. Continuous administration of glucagon, which increases the blood glucose concentration and so improves glucose availability in perinecrotic hypoxic regions, induced HIF-1α expression and increased radiation-induced DNA damage. Taken all together, these results indicate that cancer cells in perinecrotic regions, which would be under low-glucose and hypoxic conditions, obtain radioresistance by decreasing the level of both HIF-1 activity and p27(Kip1) expression, and adjusting their cell cycle to the radioresistant S phase."
https://openalex.org/W1981389970,"Several models have been designed to predict survival of patients with heart failure. These, while available and widely used for both stratifying and deciding upon different treatment options on the individual level, have several limitations. Specifically, some clinical variables that may influence prognosis may have an influence that change over time. Statistical models that include such characteristic may help in evaluating prognosis. The aim of the present study was to analyze and quantify the impact of modeling heart failure survival allowing for covariates with time-varying effects known to be independent predictors of overall mortality in this clinical setting.Survival data from an inception cohort of five hundred patients diagnosed with heart failure functional class III and IV between 2002 and 2004 and followed-up to 2006 were analyzed by using the proportional hazards Cox model and variations of the Cox's model and also of the Aalen's additive model.One-hundred and eighty eight (188) patients died during follow-up. For patients under study, age, serum sodium, hemoglobin, serum creatinine, and left ventricular ejection fraction were significantly associated with mortality. Evidence of time-varying effect was suggested for the last three. Both high hemoglobin and high LV ejection fraction were associated with a reduced risk of dying with a stronger initial effect. High creatinine, associated with an increased risk of dying, also presented an initial stronger effect. The impact of age and sodium were constant over time.The current study points to the importance of evaluating covariates with time-varying effects in heart failure models. The analysis performed suggests that variations of Cox and Aalen models constitute a valuable tool for identifying these variables. The implementation of covariates with time-varying effects into heart failure prognostication models may reduce bias and increase the specificity of such models."
https://openalex.org/W1975473788,"The L-selectin glycoprotein receptor mediates the initial steps of leukocyte migration into secondary lymphoid organs and sites of inflammation. Following cell activation through the engagement of G-protein-coupled receptors or immunoreceptors, the extracellular domains of L-selectin are rapidly shed, a process negatively controlled via the binding of the ubiquitous eukaryotic calcium-binding protein calmodulin to the cytoplasmic tail of L-selectin. Here we present the solution structure of calcium-calmodulin bound to a peptide encompassing the cytoplasmic tail and part of the transmembrane domain of L-selectin. The structure and accompanying biophysical study highlight the importance of both calcium and the transmembrane segment of L-selectin in the interaction between these two proteins, suggesting that by binding this region, calmodulin regulates in an ""inside-out"" fashion the ectodomain shedding of the receptor. Our structure provides the first molecular insight into the emerging new role for calmodulin as a transmembrane signaling partner."
https://openalex.org/W1985333251,"The Chlamydia trachomatis type three-secreted effector protein CT694 is expressed during late-cycle development yet is secreted by infectious particles during the invasion process. We have previously described the presence of at least two functional domains within CT694. CT694 was found to interact with the human protein Ahnak through a C-terminal domain and affect formation of host-cell actin stress fibers. Immunolocalization analyses of ectopically expressed pEGFP-CT694 also revealed plasma membrane localization for CT694 that was independent of Ahnak binding. Here we provide evidence that CT694 contains multiple functional domains. Plasma membrane localization and CT694-induced alterations in host cell morphology are dependent on an N-terminal domain. We demonstrate that membrane association of CT694 is dependent on a domain resembling a membrane localization domain (MLD) found in anti-host proteins from Yersinia, Pseudomonas, and Salmonella spp. This domain is necessary and sufficient for localization and morphology changes but is not required for Ahnak binding. Further, the CT694 MLD is able to complement ExoS ΔMLD when ectopically expressed. Taken together, our data indicate that CT694 is a multidomain protein with the potential to modulate multiple host cell processes."
https://openalex.org/W2151017816,"The existing literature is inconsistent about the psychosocial functioning of children and adolescents with Unilateral Congenital Below Elbow Deficiency (UCBED). The objective of this qualitative study was to explore the psychosocial functioning of children and adolescents with UCBED in terms of their feelings about the deficiency and what helps them to cope with those feelings. Additionally, the perspectives of prosthesis wearers and non-wearers were compared, as were the perspectives of children, adolescents, parents and health professionals. Online focus group interviews were carried out with 42 children and adolescents (aged 8–12, 13–16 and 17–20), 16 parents and 19 health professionals. Questions were asked about psychosocial functioning, activities, participation, prosthetic use or non-use, and rehabilitation care. This study concerned remarks about psychosocial functioning. Children and adolescents with UCBED had mixed feelings about their deficiency. Both negative and positive feelings were often felt simultaneously and mainly depended on the way people in the children’s environment reacted to the deficiency. People staring affected the children negatively, while support from others helped them to cope with the deficiency. Wearing a prosthesis and peer-to-peer contact were also helpful. Non-wearers tended to be more resilient than prosthesis wearers. Wearers wore their prosthesis for cosmetic reasons and to prevent them from negative reactions from the environment. We recommend that rehabilitation teams make parents aware of their great influence on the psychosocial functioning of their child with UCBED, to adjust or extend the currently available psychosocial help, and to encourage peer-to-peer contact."
https://openalex.org/W2064634024,"Objective To analyze the short and long term safety and efficacy of ureteroscopic evaluation and management of chronic unilateral hematuria. Methods We retrospectively reviewed patients with chronic unilateral hematuria from 1987 to 2008. The distal to middle ureter was evaluated with a semi-rigid ureteroscope without a guidewire. Subsequently, the flexible ureteroscope was advanced into the upper ureter to the renal pelvis using a low-pressure automated irrigant system (Uromat™). Lesions identified ureteroscopically were treated with diathermy fulguration. Results One hundred and four (56 male, 48 female) patients were identified, with a median age of 37 (14–80) years and median follow-up of 139 (34–277) months. The median preoperative duration of gross hematuria was 5 (1–144) months. Endoscopic findings included 61 (56%) minute venous rupture (MVR; a venous bleeding without clear abnormalities), 21 (20%) hemangioma (vascular tumor-like structure), 3 (3%) varix (tortuous vein), 1 (1%) calculus and 18 (17%) no lesions. The incidence of “no lesions” was less in the recent 12 years (9%) than the first 10 years (27%), while the incidence of MVR increased from 40 to 66% (p<0.05). All patients were treated endoscopically. Immediate success rate was 96% (100% in the recent 12 years). Long-term recurrent gross hematuria rate was 7%. Six resolved spontaneously and only 1 required ureteroscopy, revealing a different bleeding site. Conclusion Ureteroscopy and diathermy fulguration is highly useful for evaluation and treatment of chronic unilateral hematuria. Sophisticated technique and improved instrumentation contributes to a better outcome."
https://openalex.org/W2080942850,"The use of sequence alignments to understand protein families is ubiquitous in molecular biology. High quality alignments are difficult to build and protein alignment remains one of the largest open problems in computational biology. Misalignments can lead to inferential errors about protein structure, folding, function, phylogeny, and residue importance. Identifying alignment errors is difficult because alignments are built and validated on the same primary criteria: sequence conservation. Local covariation identifies systematic misalignments and is independent of conservation. We demonstrate an alignment curation tool, LoCo, that integrates local covariation scores with the Jalview alignment editor. Using LoCo, we illustrate how local covariation is capable of identifying alignment errors due to the reduction of positional independence in the region of misalignment. We highlight three alignments from the benchmark database, BAliBASE 3, that contain regions of high local covariation, and investigate the causes to illustrate these types of scenarios. Two alignments contain sequential and structural shifts that cause elevated local covariation. Realignment of these misaligned segments reduces local covariation; these alternative alignments are supported with structural evidence. We also show that local covariation identifies active site residues in a validated alignment of paralogous structures. Loco is available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/locoprotein/files/"

https://openalex.org/W1995344781,"Background NK cells express several specialized receptors through which they recognize and discriminate virally-infected/tumor cells efficiently from healthy cells and kill them. This ability to lyse is regulated by an array of inhibitory or activating receptors. The present study investigated the frequency of various NK receptors expressed by NK cell subsets from HIV-infected TB patients. The effect of IL-15+IL-12 stimulation on the expression of NK receptors was also studied. Methodology/Principal Findings The study included 15 individuals each from normal healthy subjects, pulmonary tuberculosis patients, HIV-infected individuals and patients with HIV and tuberculosis co-infection. The expression of NK cell receptors was analyzed on two NK cell subsets within the peripheral blood: CD16+CD3− and CD56+CD3− using flow cytometry. The expression of inhibitory receptors (CD158a, CD158b, KIRp70, CD85j and NKG2A) on NK subsets was increased in HIV, when compared to NHS. But the response in HIV-TB was not uniform. Stimulation with IL-15+IL-12 dropped (p<0.05) the expression of CD85j and NKG2A in HIV. The basal expression of natural cytotoxicity receptors (NKp30 and NKp46) on NK cell subsets was lowered (p<0.05) in HIV and HIV-TB as compared to NHS. However, the expression of NKp44 and NKG2D was elevated in HIV. Enhanced NKp46 and NKG2D expression was observed in HIV with IL-15+IL-12 stimulation. The coreceptor NKp80 was found to be expressed in higher numbers on NK subsets from HIV compared to NHS, which elevated with IL-15+IL-12 stimulation.

https://openalex.org/W2024995301,"The focal adhesion adapter protein p130cas regulates adhesion and growth factor-related signaling, in part through Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of p130cas. AND-34/BCAR3, one of three NSP family members, binds the p130cas carboxyl terminus, adjacent to a bipartite p130cas Src-binding domain (SBD) and induces anti-estrogen resistance in breast cancer cell lines as well as phosphorylation of p130cas. Only a subset of the signaling properties of BCAR3, specifically augmented motility, are dependent upon formation of the BCAR3-p130cas complex. Using GST pull-down and immunoprecipitation studies, we show that among NSP family members, only BCAR3 augments the ability of p130cas to bind the Src SH3 domain through an RPLPSPP motif in the p130cas SBD. Although our prior work identified phosphorylation of the serine within the p130cas RPLPSPP motif, mutation of this residue to alanine or glutamic acid did not alter BCAR3-induced Src SH3 domain binding to p130cas. The ability of BCAR3 to augment Src SH3 binding requires formation of a BCAR3-p130cas complex because mutations that reduce association between these two proteins block augmentation of Src SH3 domain binding. Similarly, in MCF-7 cells, BCAR3-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the p130cas substrate domain, previously shown to be Src-dependent, was reduced by an R743A mutation that blocks BCAR3 association with p130cas. Immunofluorescence studies demonstrate that BCAR3 expression alters the intracellular location of both p130cas and Src and that all three proteins co-localize. Our work suggests that BCAR3 expression may regulate Src signaling in a BCAR3-p130cas complex-dependent fashion by altering the ability of the Src SH3 domain to bind the p130cas SBD.

The focal adhesion protein p130cas (Crk-associated substrate) was first identified as a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein in p47 v-Crk and p60 v-Src transformed cell lines (1Sakai R. Iwamatsu A.

Integrin signaling also enhances CrkII association through its SH3 domain with the atypical Rac GDP exchange factor DOCK180, thus assembling a p130cas complex that serves as a molecular switch for cell migration (5Klemke R.L.

Although p130cas substrate domain tyrosine phosphorylation is clearly of importance to regulation of cell motility, the precise mechanism by which Src is activated to carry out such phosphorylation remains controversial. “Pull-down” studies using glutathione S-transferase (GST)-Src SH2 and GST-Src SH3 domains have demonstrated that a carboxyl-terminal region of p130cas designated the “Src-binding domain” (SBD) contains binding sites for both the Src SH2 domain at Tyr-762 and for the Src SH3 domain at an adjacent RPLPSPP motif (8Nakamoto T.

Whereas in rat 3Y1 fibroblast cells Src SH2 domain association with p130cas required co-expression of v-Crk or v-Src, association of the Src SH3 domain with p130cas in these cells was constitutive. Mutation of the RPLPSPP motif to RLGSSPP resulted in a marked reduction in p130cas-associated kinase activity in v-Crk-transformed cells, suggesting that Src associated with the p130cas SBD may contribute to p130cas substrate domain phosphorylation (8Nakamoto T.

In contrast to these results, work by another group in COS-7 cells reported that mutation of the RPLPSPP motif to RAAASPP failed to alter the ability of transfected FAK and n-Src to induce p130cas tyrosine phosphorylation. In these studies, p130cas substrate domain phosphorylation was instead shown to require Src binding to phosphorylated FAK Tyr-397 (10Ruest P.J. Shin N.Y. Polte T.R. Zhang X. Hanks S.K.

Because BCAR3 and p130cas both can regulate cell motility and breast cancer cell line estrogen-independent cell growth, formation of the BCAR3-p130cas complex would be expected to be required for BCAR3-mediated signaling. Surprisingly, in recent studies utilizing an R743A mutant form of BCAR3 that is unable to form a complex with p130cas, we found that many characterized downstream events associated with BCAR3 overexpression are independent of such complex formation (24Vanden Borre P. Near R.I. Makkinje A. Mostoslavsky G. Lerner A. BCAR3/AND-34 can signal independent of complex formation with CAS family members or the presence of p130cas.Cell.

Chem. 2003; 278: 28264-28273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) described above, BCAR3-induced Src activation was reported to occur independently of BCAR3 association with p130cas. In contrast, BCAR3-induced augmentation of cellular motility is reduced in fibroblasts expressing the complex formation-defective BCAR3 R743A (24Vanden Borre P. Near R.I. Makkinje A. Mostoslavsky G.

The molecular mechanisms underlying BCAR3-p130cas complex-dependent and -independent signaling remain unresolved. In a study examining a BCAR3-induced reduction in p130cas PAGE migration, we determined that BCAR3 expression regulates late phase adhesion-dependent p130cas phosphorylation in an actin filament-dependent manner (26Makkinje A. Near R.I. Infusini G. Vanden Borre P. Bloom A. Cai D. Costello C.E. Lerner A. AND-34/BCAR3 regulates adhesion-dependent p130cas serine phosphorylation and breast cancer cell growth pattern.Cell. Signal. 2009; 21: 1423-1435Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Three sites of p130cas serine phosphorylation were identified, one of which was located within the previously characterized Src SH3 domain binding site, RPLPSPP. Given this observation, we sought to determine whether expression of BCAR3 could alter the ability of the Src SH3 domain to bind to p130cas. Here, we report that BCAR3 expression augments both Src SH3 domain binding to p130cas and tyrosine phosphorylation of the p130cas substrate domain in a BCAR3-p130cas complex-dependent manner.

Transient transfection of cultured cells were performed by mixing plasmid DNA with Lipofectamine 2000 (ratio 1:3 (μg of DNA/μl of Lipofectamine)) in quantities needed to treat duplicate 100-mm culture plates with a subconfluent growth of cells. After 18 h of growth in transfection medium, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Cell lysates were prepared by scraping cell monolayers on duplicate plates into 750 μl of buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm PMSF) on ice. Cell lysates were clarified of Triton X-100-insoluble debris by centrifuging samples at 20,800 × g for 30 min at 5 °C. Protein concentrations of the clarified cell lysates were measured using Bradford reagent (Bio-Rad). For immunoprecipitation, pull-down assays, and expression analysis, lysates were normalized to approximately equal concentration of protein. For immunoprecipitation, 500 μg of cellular protein was mixed end-over-end with 10–20 μl of protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) and designated antibodies for 3 h at 5 °C. Sepharose beads were collected by centrifuging samples at 1000 × g and discarding the supernatants. Sample pellets were washed three times with ice-cold buffer A (see above), suspended in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Heat-denatured protein samples were separated using SDS-PAGE, Western transfer, and immunoblotting methods described previously (26Makkinje A. Near R.I. Infusini G. Vanden Borre P. Bloom A. Cai D.

A pGEX plasmid encoding the SH3 domain of p130cas was from Dr. Kathrin Kirsch (Boston University School of Medicine). The SH3 domain of mouse p85α was amplified from expression vector pRSV-Myc-p85α, a gift from Dr. Zhijun Luo (Boston University School of Medicine), using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), forward primer (5′-AGTGCAGAGGGCTACCAG-3′) and reverse primer (5′-TGAAATTCTTTTCCTTCCAATG-3′). p85α SH3 forward and reverse primers also had BamHI and NotI restriction enzyme sequences at their 5′ termini, respectively. The PCR product was digested with BamHI-NotI (New England Biolabs) and ligated into BamHI-NotI-digested pET-6P-1 (Invitrogen). Plasmids encoding GST and GST-tagged recombinant SH3 and SH2 domain proteins were used to transform Escherichia coli strain DH5α (Invitrogen) as recommended by the manufacturer. Transformed bacteria were cultured in LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin to midphase of linear growth, upon which time isopropyl-1-thiol-β-galactopyranoside was added to the culture to a concentration of 0.5 mm to induce recombinant protein expression. Isopropyl-1-thiol-β-galactopyranoside-treated bacterial cultures were grown at room temperature overnight. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, and bacterial pellets were lysed using a lytic, non-mechanical method. Bacterial pellets were suspended in lysis buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, containing 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT). Egg white lysozyme (1 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich) was added, and the mixtures were incubated on ice for 45 min. MgCl2 (10 mm) and DNase I (25 μg/ml) were added and incubated on ice for 20 min. The cytoplasmic fraction of bacterial lysates were prepared by centrifugation at 100,000 × g and mixed with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) resin for 3 h. After mixing, Sepharose resins were washed sequentially with buffer C (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm benzamidine), high salt buffer D (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm PMSF, and 1 mm benzamidine), and buffer E (20 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm PMSF). Proteins bound to washed Sepharose resins were eluted with 0.2 m reduced glutathione (Sigma) in buffer E. Eluants were transferred to dialysis tubing (Spectra/Por®; molecular mass cut-off 12–14 kDa), dialyzed overnight against two changes of buffer C containing 50% glycerol, and kept at −20 °C for long term storage. Protein concentrations of the dialysates were determined using Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Purity of the protein in the dialysates was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and assessed to be >97% by Coomassie Blue staining. Protein lysates prepared from non-transfected, transiently transfected, or transduced cells were normalized to equal concentrations of 1 mg of protein/ml in lysis buffer. GST pull-down samples were assembled by suspending 10–20 μl of GSH-Sepharose beads with 1 ml of protein lysate (1 mg) to which 15 μg of designated GST-tagged protein was added. Samples were tumbled end-over-end for 2 h at 5 °C. Proteins complexed to GSH-Sepharose beads were recovered by centrifuging samples at 1000 × g for 5 min at 5 °C. Supernatants of the samples were discarded, and Sepharose pellets were washed three times in lysis buffer and three times in lysis buffer containing 250 mm NaCl and suspended in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Samples were heat-denatured at 100 °C for 5 min and applied to wells of SDS-polyacrylamide gels prepared with 8 and 12% discontinuous resolving acrylamide gels, ⅔ and ⅓ length, respectively. After electrophoretic separation, proteins in the 8% acrylamide resolving gels were Western transferred onto PVDF membranes for immunoblot analysis as described above, and proteins retained in the 12% acrylamide resolving gels were stained with Coomassie Blue G-250 (Sigma-Aldrich).

This construct plus packaging plasmids were transfected into HEK-293T cells in 10-cm plates at 50–70% confluence using Fugene 6 (Roche Applied Science). Medium containing packaged phage particles was harvested, and phage particles were concentrated by centrifugation (SW28 Beckman rotor 1.5 h at 16,500 rpm). For lentiviral transduction, 50 μl of the concentrated lentiviral supernatants was added with Polybrene (final concentration 8 μg/ml) to MCF-7 and BCAR3/MCF-7 cells cultured in 6-well plates, followed by centrifugation of the plates at 800 × g for 45 min. The transduced cells were trypsinized and resuspended in DMEM with 3% FCS and sorted for dTomato in a MoFlo apparatus (Beckman Coulter). Src overexpression was confirmed by Western analysis. For immunofluorescence studies, cell lines were cultured on fibronectin-coated coverslips (BD Biosciences) as described previously and fixed using 3.7% paraformaldehyde at 37 °C (24Vanden Borre P.

Following incubation with primary antibodies, including anti-c-Src polyclonal antibodies, anti-p130cas mouse monoclonal antibody, and anti-HA mouse monoclonal antibody, cells were probed with Alexa Fluor 350 goat anti-rabbit and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Invitrogen). All antibodies were diluted 1:100 in TBS with 2% BSA. After incubation with the antibodies, cells were rinsed several times in TBS prior to being mounted on slides with either Prolong Gold anti-fade reagent with DAPI or Slow Fade Gold without DAPI (Invitrogen) and allowed to cure overnight. Imaging was performed on either a Nikon TE2000-E microscope or a Zeiss LSM 710 Live Duo scan confocal microscope. Images were captured using NIS Elements (Nikon) software and processed using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health) and Photoshop (Adobe). To examine the effect of BCAR3 expression on Src domain interaction with p130cas, purified GST, GST-Src SH2 domain, or GST-Src SH3 domain were incubated with lysates from MCF-7 cells or a stable HA-BCAR3 transfectant of MCF-7, BCAR3/MCF-7 cells. Only GST-Src SH3 associated with endogenous p130cas, and this occurred only in the presence of HA-BCAR3 expression in BCAR3/MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1A). As expected, given that BCAR3 induces phosphorylation of p130cas that results in reduced mobility in low bisacrylamide gels, the predominant form of endogenous p130cas brought down by GST-Src SH3 domain in BCAR3/MCF-7 cells migrated more slowly than the endogenous predominant form of p130cas present in MCF7 cells (Fig. 1A) (26Makkinje A.

https://openalex.org/W1995139950,"Complex systems involving many interacting elements often organize into patterns. Two types of pattern formation can be distinguished, static and dynamic. Static pattern formation means that the resulting structure constitutes a thermodynamic equilibrium whose pattern formation can be understood in terms of the minimization of free energy, while dynamic pattern formation indicates that the system is permanently dissipating energy and not in equilibrium. In this paper, we report experimental results showing that the morphology of elements plays a significant role in dynamic pattern formation. We prepared three different shapes of elements (circles, squares, and triangles) floating in a water-filled container, in which each of the shapes has two types: active elements that were capable of self-agitation with vibration motors, and passive elements that were mere floating tiles. The system was purely decentralized: that is, elements interacted locally, and subsequently elicited global patterns in a process called self-organized segregation. We showed that, according to the morphology of the selected elements, a different type of segregation occurs. Also, we quantitatively characterized both the local interaction regime and the resulting global behavior for each type of segregation by means of information theoretic quantities, and showed the difference for each case in detail, while offering speculation on the mechanism causing this phenomenon."

Here, we characterize the modifications of C1942 and C1962 in Thermus thermophilus 23 S rRNA as 5-methylcytidines (m5C) and identify the two associated methyltransferases. The methyltransferase modifying C1942, named RlmO, has not been characterized previously. RlmO modifies naked 23 S rRNA, but not the assembled 50 S subunit or 70 S ribosomes. The x-ray crystal structure of this enzyme in complex with the S-adenosyl-l-methionine cofactor at 1.7 Å resolution confirms that RlmO is structurally related to other m5C rRNA methyltransferases. Key residues in the active site are located similar to the further distant 5-methyluridine methyltransferase RlmD, suggestive of a similar enzymatic mechanism. RlmO homologues are primarily found in mesophilic bacteria related to T. thermophilus.

Despite the different modification systems, there is a significant degree of phylogenetic conservation of modification site and modification nature in large ribosomal subunit rRNAs. This is exemplified by three pseudouridines (Ψ) in helix 69 (E. coli secondary structure nomenclature and nucleotide numbering used as default in this work) and ribose methylations of G2251 and U2552, which are found across all domains of life (6Ofengand J.

Furthermore, a high resolution x-ray crystallography structure of TTHA1493, which 5-methylates C1942, is reported. The T. thermophilus HB8 loci encoding TTHA1280 and TTHA1493 were PCR-amplified from genomic DNA based on the genome sequence (GenBankTM accession number NC_006461.1). General information on the cloning has been reported in Ref. 29Demirci H. Larsen L.H. Hansen T. Rasmussen A. Cadambi A. Gregory S.T. Kirpekar F. Jogl G. Multisite-specific 16 S rRNA methyltransferase RsmF from Thermus thermophilus.RNA. 2010; 16: 1584-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar; gene-specific details were as follows. The PCR primers for TTHA1280 amplifications were CTTAGCATATGAGGATTCAGGTC and GCCTCCAGATCTGAGGACC with conditions for PCR as in Ref. 29Demirci H. Larsen L.H. Hansen T. Rasmussen A. Cadambi A.

The TTHA1493 gene was PCR-amplified in a two-step nested primer approach with the first set of primers having the sequences CCGAGGAAGAGGGCGAGGGC and CCTGAGGCCCCGGCGAGG, respectively. The 50-μl PCR contained 270 ng of chromosomal DNA, 0.25 mm of each primer, 0.25 mm dNTP, 8% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), 1 μl of Herculase II fusion DNA polymerase (Agilent Technologies), and 1× Herculase II fusion DNA polymerase buffer. The PCR temperature profile was 98 °C/180 s; 30× (98 °C/20 s, 60 °C/20 s, and 72 °C/35 s); 72 °C/180 s. 60 ng of this PCR product served as template for the second round of PCR with the primers GCAGGCATATGCTGGGGCC and GTGGGGCGAGATCTGAGGGG that introduced the restriction enzyme site for the subsequent cloning CR (reaction mixture otherwise identical to the first round of PCR). The second PCR temperature profile was 98 °C/180 s; 30× (98 °C/20 s, 59 °C/20 s, and 72 °C/30 s); 72 °C/180 s. The plasmids containing the PCR-amplified genes were named pLJ102-TTHA1280 and pLJ102-TTHA1493, respectively. Inactivation of genes in T. thermophilus by insertion of a kanamycin resistance-conferring gene by homologous recombination has been described (29Demirci H. Larsen L.H. Hansen T. Rasmussen A. Cadambi A. Gregory S.T. Kirpekar F. Jogl G. Multisite-specific 16 S rRNA methyltransferase RsmF from Thermus thermophilus.RNA. 2010; 16: 1584-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Specifically, the heat-tolerant kanamycin resistance gene was inserted into a BbvCI restriction enzyme site in TTHA1280 and a BsrGI restriction enzyme site in TTHA1493. The correctness of the gene disruptions was assayed by PCR and DNA sequencing. These purifications were in most instances done as described previously (32Andersen T.E. Porse B.T. Kirpekar F. A novel partial modification at C2501 in Escherichia coli 23 S ribosomal RNA.RNA. 2004; 10: 907-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The DNA oligonucleotides for purification of 23 S rRNA subfragments were GGAACTTACCCGACAAGGAATTTCGCTACCTTAGGACCGTTATAGTTACGGCC and GCGCTCCGGTCGTTACGCTTTTCGTGCAGGTCGGAACTTACCCG, which were complementary to positions 1906–1958 and 1947–1990 (E. coli numbering throughout), respectively, of T. thermophilus 23 S rRNA. For the nucleoside analyses, the following procedure for purification of T. thermophilus total RNA was used. 200 ml of an overnight culture of T. thermophilus HB8 in Thermus medium (2 g/liter NaCl, 4 g/liter yeast extract, 8 g/liter Polypeptone; adjusted to pH 7.5 with NaOH) was cooled on ice and harvested by centrifugation at 6000 rpm/4 °C for 10 min with a Beckman JA14 rotor. The cell pellet was washed with 50 ml of Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2,10 mm NH4Cl, 100 mm KCl), centrifuged again, and resuspended in 8 ml of Buffer A. The cells were lysed by sonication (8 × 30 s with 30 s on ice in between), and cell debris was removed by 2× centrifugation at 16,000 rpm/4 °C for 10 min with a microcentrifuge. The supernatant was adjusted to 0.5% SDS, 40 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and 10 mm EDTA followed by the addition of 160 mg of proteinase K and incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. The aqueous phase was extracted five times with phenol, two times with phenol/chloroform, and once with chloroform. The RNA was precipitated with 1/10 volume of 3 m sodium acetate/3 volumes of 96% ethanol, washed with 70% ethanol, and redissolved in 220 μl of water. 23 S rRNA subfragments were isolated directly from the total RNA preparation. RNase A and RNase T1 digestions followed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric analysis were done as described previously (33Douthwaite S. Kirpekar F. Identifying modifications in RNA by MALDI mass spectrometry.Methods Enzymol. 2007; 425: 1-20Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Digestion of rRNA into nucleosides and subsequent nano-Chip liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MSn) was done according to Giessing et al. (34Giessing A.M. Scott L.G. Kirpekar F. A nano-Chip-LC/MSn based strategy for characterization of modified ribonucleic acids using reduced porous graphitic carbon as a stationary phase.J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. 2011; 22: 1242-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Nucleosides were base line-separated on a graphitic carbon chip under reduced conditions and identified by automatic tandem mass spectrometry (up to MS5) in real time. Reactions contained 50 pmol of 23 S rRNA, 50 S subunits, or 70 S ribosomes from the T. thermophilus ΔTTHA1493 mutant as substrate in a total volume of 100 μl containing 100 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, 40 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 6 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 10% glycerol (prepared as a 2× concentrated stock solution), 1.5 mm S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet), and 2 μg of recombinantly expressed TTHA1493 (see below). Water and stock buffer were mixed and left at room temperature for 15 min. Then substrate, enzyme, and AdoMet were added and incubated at 70 °C for 1 h. Reactions were stopped by phenol/chloroform extraction, and the rRNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation before purification of the 23 S rRNA subfragment with the oligonucleotide CGTGCAGGTCGGAACTTACCCGACAAGGAATTTCGCTACCTTAGGACCG (complementary to positions 1919–1967 of the 23 S rRNA) as described above. Control reactions without enzyme or AdoMet were carried out in all instances. Details can be found in a previous study (29Demirci H. Larsen L.H. Hansen T. Rasmussen A. Cadambi A. Gregory S.T. Kirpekar F. Jogl G. Multisite-specific 16 S rRNA methyltransferase RsmF from Thermus thermophilus.RNA. 2010; 16: 1584-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In brief, wild type and ΔTTHA1493 T. thermophilus were co-cultured at 60, 70, or 80 °C in Thermus medium (see above). After growth for 24 h, each culture was transferred to fresh 5 ml of medium and incubated at the respective temperatures for another 24 h. This was repeated in independent triplicates for seven cycles. Samples were collected at each dilution; half was spread on plates without antibiotic, and the other half was spread on plates with 30 μg/ml kanamycin. Plates were incubated at 70 °C until colonies became visible. E. coli BL21 (DE3) (Invitrogen) containing pLJ102-TTHA1493 was grown to mid-log phase in LB medium at 37 °C in the presence of 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Protein expression was induced at 20 °C with 400 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were pelleted after 18 h by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C and lysed by ultrasonication on ice in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 5% glycerol. Cell debris and membranes were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Soluble C-terminally hexahistidine-tagged T. thermophilus TTHA1493 was further purified by affinity chromatography with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). Untagged proteins were removed with washing buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 250 mm NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole (pH 8.5). Recombinant TTHA1493 was then eluted with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 250 mm NaCl, and 150 mm imidazole. The protein was then purified by anion exchange chromatography at pH 8.5, using a linear gradient of 10 mm to 1 m NaCl. TTHA1493 fractions were pooled and concentrated and applied to a size-exclusion S200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) and 200 mm NaCl. Purified TTHA1493 was concentrated to 10 mg/ml for crystallization trials. The C-terminal hexahistidine tag was not removed for crystallization. Crystals of TTHA1493 were obtained by sitting drop vapor diffusion at 4 °C. 1 μl of protein solution was mixed with a reservoir solution containing 50 mm citrate, pH 5.0, 10–12% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, and 5 mm AdoMet-Cl. Crystals were cryo-protected in a buffer solution containing 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 5.0, 25% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, and 5 mm AdoMet-Cl and flash-frozen by plunging into liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data to 1.7 Å resolution were collected on an Area Detector Systems Corp. Quantum Q4 detector at the X4A beamline of the National Synchrotron Light Source in the Brookhaven National Laboratory at a wavelength of 0.979 Å and −180 °C. Crystals belong to space group P21 with cell dimensions a = 63.8 Å, b = 46.0 Å, c = 129.4 Å, and β = 96.8 Å. Diffraction images were integrated and scaled with the HKL2000 package (35Otwinowski Z.

Open table in a new tab We previously showed that C1942 and C1962 (C1963 and C1983 in T. thermophilus) of 23 S rRNA in T. thermophilus are singly methylated (16Mengel-Jørgensen J. Jensen S.S. Rasmussen A. Poehlsgaard J. Iversen J.J. Kirpekar F. Modifications in Thermus thermophilus 23 S ribosomal RNA are centered in regions of RNA-RNA contact.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22108-22117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), but did not determine the precise location of the methyl groups on the two nucleotides. To clarify these points, we isolated the modified cytidines separately by purification of two 23 S rRNA subfragments (positions 1906–1958 and positions 1947–1990, respectively) followed by total hydrolysis into nucleosides. The nucleosides were subjected to LC-MSn on an ion trap mass spectrometer, and the identity of the methylated cytidines was determined from a combination of the chromatographic retention time on a graphite column combined with the MS4 fragmentation pattern (34Giessing A.M. Scott L.G. Kirpekar F. A nano-Chip-LC/MSn based strategy for characterization of modified ribonucleic acids using reduced porous graphitic carbon as a stationary phase.J. Am. Soc. Mass. Spectrom. 2011; 22: 1242-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 demonstrates that each of the 23 S rRNA subfragments harbors cytidines methylated at carbon-5 of the nucleobase, where the retention time and mass spectrometric fragmentation pattern (not shown) are identical to that of an m5C standard. Our analysis additionally confirmed a 2′-O-ribose cytidine methylation (Cm), which we have previously mapped to C1920. Hence, C1942 and C1962 are 5-methylated. A 5-methyl modification of C1962 is also found in E. coli 23 S rRNA, synthesized by the enzyme RlmI (24Purta E. O'Connor M. Bujnicki J.M. Douthwaite S. YccW is the m5C methyltransferase specific for 23 S rRNA nucleotide 1962.J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 383: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We used the sequence of the E. coli RlmI protein to perform a BLAST search against all potential T. thermophilus proteins to obtain candidates for methyl transferases that target C1942 and C1962. Our working hypothesis was that m5C methyltransferases, which target nucleotides that are located close to each other in both secondary and three-dimensional conformation (see Fig. 6D), and that they will exhibit significant sequence homology because they likely recognize similar RNA structures. The search returned the hypothetical protein TTHA1280 as the top match with an expected value of 10−61, followed by TTHA1493 with an expected value of 10−46. The genes encoding the two proteins were cloned into an expression vector (44Andersen N.M. Douthwaite S. YebU is a m5C methyltransferase specific for 16 S rRNA nucleotide 1407.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 777-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) and also used to construct gene knock-outs in T. thermophilus through insertion of a kanamycin resistance cassette (45Hashimoto Y. Yano T. Kuramitsu S. Kagamiyama H. Disruption of Thermus thermophilus genes by homologous recombination using a thermostable kanamycin-resistant marker.FEBS Lett. 2001; 506: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). 23 S rRNA subfragments encompassing C1942 or C1962 were purified from the two T. thermophilus knock-out strains. The rRNA subfragments were digested with either RNase A or RNase T1, and digestion products were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Fig. 2 shows that ΔTTHA1493 gives a C1942-encompassing RNase T1 digestion product 14.0 Da less in mass than the wild type T. thermophilus. However, this RNase T1 digestion product also contains a methylated U1939 (16Mengel-Jørgensen J. Jensen S.S. Rasmussen"

Therapy-induced increases in CD4+ cell counts can control inflammation, as shown by decreases of coagulation and inflammation markers during efficacious therapy. Maraviroc, a CCR5-antagonist, has resulted in larger increases in CD4+ counts both in naïve and experienced subjects compared to traditional antiretroviral therapy. Objectives and Methods To examine if a member of the protein C anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory pathway, and marker of coagulation and inflammation, the soluble endothelial protein C receptor, is modified by infection and therapy-related variables in patients treated with Maraviroc. Endothelial protein C receptor, together with other established markers of inflammation and coagulation (CRP, IL-6, D-dimer and soluble thrombomodulin) was studied in 43 patients on traditional antiretroviral therapy and in 45 on Maraviroc during 48 weeks of follow-up. Results Soluble endothelial protein C receptor was the only marker that could discriminate at least partially between patients with a good response to Maraviroc and patients who did not respond with an adequate increase in CD4+ cell counts (more than 500 cells/µL by week 48). Conclusions Elevated levels of soluble endothelial protein C receptor, a sensitive marker of endothelial damage, indicated a low level of inflammation and coagulation activation in Maraviroc treated patients not picked up by other widely used markers. Persistent elevated levels of this marker at 48 weeks from beginning of treatment with Maraviroc were related to a poor increase in CD4+ cells."
https://openalex.org/W2032606516,"Select plasma membrane proteins can be marked as cargo for inclusion into clathrin-coated pits by common internalization signals (e.g. YXXΦ, dileucine motifs, NPXY) that serve as universal recognition sites for the AP-2 adaptor complex or other clathrin-associated sorting proteins. However, some surface proteins, such as the Kir2.3 potassium channel, lack canonical signals but are still targeted for clathrin-dependent endocytosis. Here, we explore the mechanism. We found an unusual endocytic signal in Kir2.3 that is based on two consecutive pairs of hydrophobic residues. Characterized by the sequence ΦΦXΦΦ (a tandem di-hydrophobic (TDH) motif, where Φ is a hydrophobic amino acid), the signal shows no resemblance to other endocytic motifs, yet it directly interacts with AP-2 to target the Kir2.3 potassium channel into the endocytic pathway. We found that the tandem di-hydrophobic motif directly binds to the ασ2 subunits of AP-2, interacting within a large hydrophobic cleft that encompasses part of the docking site for di-Leu signals, but includes additional structures. These observations expand the repertoire of clathrin-dependent internalization signals and the ways in which AP-2 can coordinate endocytosis of cargo proteins."

https://openalex.org/W2014001712,"Three years after federal restrictions on human embryonic stem cell (hESC) research were eased, advocates are again battling to defend the work from the threat of political upheaval. The progress made since 2009, when President Obama overturned restrictions on publicly funded hESC research enacted by the Bush administration, could be jeopardized in a pen-stroke if a Republican president takes office, and at the state level, a flurry of “personhood” initiatives seeking to grant legal rights to embryos could shut down research efforts around the country. Stem cell research has largely escaped the spotlight in this Presidential campaign so far, but it's far from a comfortable silence, according to advocates. They say the field is in great jeopardy, both from the socially conservative movement that's swept to prominence over recent months, and a legal challenge to federal funding for the work. As the election looms, advocacy groups are fighting back with stronger networks and new tools and strategies to rally support and leverage their influence on Capitol Hill and beyond. “This field is on shaky ground,” says Bernard Siegel, founder and executive director of the Florida-based Genetics Policy Institute (GPI), which supports stem cell research through advocacy, education, and strategic collaborations, and produces the annual World Stem Cell Summit and World Stem Cell Report. “The situation is much more serious than it was 4 years ago. There's a sense of urgency in the advocacy community.” “The political climate right now is quite concerning,” says Eleanor “Ellie” Dehoney, vice president of public policy and programs at Research!America, an alliance of more than 100 member organizations that promotes funding and awareness for medical and health research. “There's definitely a sense of urgency.” Mitt Romney has voiced his opposition to federally funded hESC research, as have the other Republican candidates, and if he is elected president, he could easily reverse the executive order that allows federal funding for the work. He hasn't always taken such a conservative stance, though—during his run for governor of Massachusetts, Romney supported research using surplus embryos, and public funding for such work—and his past change of heart gives some stem cell advocates hope that if elected president, Romney could soften his stance. “I think you could reason with him,” Dehoney says. “He may become more moderate.” It's not only political perils that have stem cell advocates on edge, however. There's the lingering menace of an unresolved lawsuit, “Sherley v. Sebelius,” that in 2010 temporarily halted NIH involvement in the field. The suit, filed by two adult stem cell researchers, alleges that federally funded hESC work violates a law concerning research in which human embryos are destroyed or harmed. “We have a hangover from the past administration's restrictions and we still have a cloud over us in the form of that lawsuit,” Siegel says. The latest appeal in the case—the plaintiffs' challenge to a 2011 district court ruling in the government's favor—was recently heard by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The GPI and the Coalition for the Advancement of Medical Research (CAMR), which represents more than 100 patient organizations, universities, scientific societies, and foundations, filed an amicus brief with the court, supporting the government. It could be months before there's a ruling in the appeal, although Siegel, a lawyer who left behind a 30-year career in the courtroom to establish the GPI in 2003, says the case could take years to resolve if it's appealed again. Prompted in part by the lawsuit, Siegel launched the Stem Cell Action Coalition (SCA), a GPI initiative uniting 75 organizations, including patient groups, academic institutes, medical philanthropies, and science and medical societies to advocate for publicly funded hESC research, and foster public awareness and support for the work. The coalition has developed a strong online presence, distributing news updates, commentary, and action alerts though Twitter, Facebook, and other social networks, as well as operating in other venues to build support at public events and community gatherings and serving as a resource for media. Like other large advocacy groups, SCA is making the most of the new tools of cyber advocacy to expand their reach and to energize and empower supporters, be they patients, researchers, or investors. Alliances have also been forged between some of the most powerful advocacy groups like Research!America and CAMR, and they're tapping into the strength of advocacy groups focused on conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and spinal cord injury, which could benefit from stem cell therapies. By linking established networks, hESC advocates have expanded and strengthened their influence and are able to respond more deftly to the challenges and opportunities of an election year. “We're working harder this year,” says Dehoney. “We're on the Hill more.” In particular, Research!America has continued to push for an increase in funding for the National Institutes of Health—the group was “instrumental” in the successful effort to double the agency's budget in 1995, Dehoney says—by building support among members of the appropriations committees. “It's true that the squeaky wheel gets the grease,” Dehoney says. “You have to fight loudly and consistently to make a difference.” For CAMR, the battleground is usually D.C., where the organization has established a high profile since it was founded in 2001. “We go where the action is,” says CAMR president Amy Comstock Rick. “If it's legislation, if it's an amicus brief, if it's an executive order.” This election year, CAMR has also been busy responding to so-called “personhood” initiatives that have caused controversy in states around the country, from Virginia to Mississippi to Nevada. These antiabortion measures would prohibit hESC research as well as in vitro fertilization, some forms of birth control, and even cancer treatment that could endanger an embryo. “When people hear that these personhood provisions would have all these unintended, not even thought-through impacts,” Rick says, “they have a very negative view of that.” CAMR, she says, has reached out to its member organizations to ask them to disseminate information on the far-reaching effects of the proposed measures. “There are trip wires out there in all these states,” Siegel remarks. “We try to stay ahead of the curve so that if we hear about something happening in Mississippi or Oklahoma we're not caught flat-footed.” The personhood movement could ultimately benefit the stem cell cause by rousing “groups that are natural allies in the effort to promote and defend hESC research,” Siegel adds. “We are going to continue to broadcast what's going on. The patient movement and the scientific community have to understand that this is a threat.” Research!America hopes to engage more researchers in the cause, although Dehoney notes that, “It's notoriously challenging to engage scientists in advocacy. …I think it's going to happen. Grant rates are so low that they're starting to feel the pinch. It's really important that researchers not just work in silos and that they understand that an attack on any field of scientific research is an attack on all scientific research. We rely on the scientific community to be our expert witnesses.” While organizations like GPI, CAMR, and SCA fight to defend federal funding for hESC research, a relatively new group, the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine (ARM), is focused on the translational agenda. Formed in 2009, ARM promotes legislative, regulatory, and reimbursement initiatives that help move regenerative medicine technologies toward the clinic. “We thought there needed to be an organization in Washington that represented all the stakeholders in the regenerative medicine community,” says ARM Executive Director Michael Werner, an attorney. “When we go and talk to Congress we can say, ‘Look at our makeup, we really represent everyone.’” “We have to lend our support to the translational agenda,” Siegel says. “I think the advocacy movement needs to get involved with a broader range of issues.” ARM, which now represents 110 regenerative medicine companies, research institutions, investors, and patient groups in the U.S. and farther afield, recently held its annual Legislative Day on Capitol Hill. More than 100 ARM representatives and others in the hESC field met with members of Congress and administration officials. “We found Congress to be quite receptive to hearing about regenerative medicine,” Werner said. “The more people become educated about the field, the more they become supportive.” To try to convince politicians and the public of the value of hESC work, Research!America is now broadening the discussion of its benefits beyond the promise of clinical advances to also highlight, “how this actually affects jobs and the economy at the state and federal level,” Dehoney says. “Some people think, oh, it's just a few lab jobs for people with Ph.D.s, it's nothing to do with me, but it has everything to do with them. Public sector dollars fuel private innovation.” “Some people were skeptical that the economic factor would have impact, but it does,” Dehoney adds. Surveys by Research!America suggest it's a particularly persuasive argument at a time when Americans are concerned that the country is losing its global edge in science, technology and healthcare. A recent poll by the group found that only 23% of Americans consider the U.S. first in medical and health research today, and that an overwhelming majority (91%) say it's important for the country to maintain its world leadership role. Research!America has been gauging public attitudes toward medical, health, and scientific research since 1992, and polling Americans on stem cell research since 2002. “Our polling has said for years that the majority of Americans favor hESC research,” Dehoney says, a finding that stem cell advocates say underscores the importance of educating the public and politicians about the research. “The more people learn and understand about the technology, the more they support it,” says Werner. Research!America regards polling as a key part of its strategy, Dehoney says, and the results have fueled the alliance's efforts to highlight the gap between public opinion and political will. “We know representatives listen to their constituents,” Dehoney says. “If Congress wants to roll back to Bush and beyond, I'd say it's going to be a steep climb.” Research!America also runs voter education initiatives that ask presidential and congressional candidates where they stand on the matter of hESC research, and call on voters to press candidates for answers. “There's so much support for hESC research I have trouble imagining anyone tolerating it going backward,” Rick adds. “There's so much exciting work going on that I can't imagine Congress putting a halt to it. I think there'd be an outcry.”"
