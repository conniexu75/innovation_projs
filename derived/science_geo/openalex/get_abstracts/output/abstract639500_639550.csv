https://openalex.org/W2972517993,"Fibrosis is observed in nearly every form of myocardial disease1. Upon injury, cardiac fibroblasts in the heart begin to remodel the myocardium by depositing excess extracellular matrix, resulting in increased stiffness and reduced compliance of the tissue. Excessive cardiac fibrosis is an important factor in the progression of various forms of cardiac disease and heart failure2. However, clinical interventions and therapies that target fibrosis remain limited3. Here we demonstrate the efficacy of redirected T cell immunotherapy to specifically target pathological cardiac fibrosis in mice. We find that cardiac fibroblasts that express a xenogeneic antigen can be effectively targeted and ablated by adoptive transfer of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. Through expression analysis of the gene signatures of cardiac fibroblasts obtained from healthy and diseased human hearts, we identify an endogenous target of cardiac fibroblasts-fibroblast activation protein. Adoptive transfer of T cells that express a chimeric antigen receptor against fibroblast activation protein results in a significant reduction in cardiac fibrosis and restoration of function after injury in mice. These results provide proof-of-principle for the development of immunotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of cardiac disease."
https://openalex.org/W2972524623,"Early human embryonic development involves extensive lineage diversification, cell-fate specification and tissue patterning1. Despite its basic and clinical importance, early human embryonic development remains relatively unexplained owing to interspecies divergence2,3 and limited accessibility to human embryo samples. Here we report that human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in a microfluidic device recapitulate, in a highly controllable and scalable fashion, landmarks of the development of the epiblast and amniotic ectoderm parts of the conceptus, including lumenogenesis of the epiblast and the resultant pro-amniotic cavity, formation of a bipolar embryonic sac, and specification of primordial germ cells and primitive streak cells. We further show that amniotic ectoderm-like cells function as a signalling centre to trigger the onset of gastrulation-like events in hPSCs. Given its controllability and scalability, the microfluidic model provides a powerful experimental system to advance knowledge of human embryology and reproduction. This model could assist in the rational design of differentiation protocols of hPSCs for disease modelling and cell therapy, and in high-throughput drug and toxicity screens to prevent pregnancy failure and birth defects."

https://openalex.org/W2972371855,"The cellular stress response has a vital role in regulating homeostasis by modulating cell survival and death. Stress granules are cytoplasmic compartments that enable cells to survive various stressors. Defects in the assembly and disassembly of stress granules are linked to neurodegenerative diseases, aberrant antiviral responses and cancer1-5. Inflammasomes are multi-protein heteromeric complexes that sense molecular patterns that are associated with damage or intracellular pathogens, and assemble into cytosolic compartments known as ASC specks to facilitate the activation of caspase-1. Activation of inflammasomes induces the secretion of interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 and drives cell fate towards pyroptosis-a form of programmed inflammatory cell death that has major roles in health and disease6-12. Although both stress granules and inflammasomes can be triggered by the sensing of cellular stress, they drive contrasting cell-fate decisions. The crosstalk between stress granules and inflammasomes and how this informs cell fate has not been well-studied. Here we show that the induction of stress granules specifically inhibits NLRP3 inflammasome activation, ASC speck formation and pyroptosis. The stress granule protein DDX3X interacts with NLRP3 to drive inflammasome activation. Assembly of stress granules leads to the sequestration of DDX3X, and thereby the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Stress granules and the NLRP3 inflammasome compete for DDX3X molecules to coordinate the activation of innate responses and subsequent cell-fate decisions under stress conditions. Induction of stress granules or loss of DDX3X in the myeloid compartment leads to a decrease in the production of inflammasome-dependent cytokines in vivo. Our findings suggest that macrophages use the availability of DDX3X to interpret stress signals and choose between pro-survival stress granules and pyroptotic ASC specks. Together, our data demonstrate the role of DDX3X in driving NLRP3 inflammasome and stress granule assembly, and suggest a rheostat-like mechanistic paradigm for regulating live-or-die cell-fate decisions under stress conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2972961341,"The accumulation of DNA in the cytosol serves as a key immunostimulatory signal associated with infections, cancer and genomic damage1,2. Cytosolic DNA triggers immune responses by activating the cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS)–stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway3. The binding of DNA to cGAS activates its enzymatic activity, leading to the synthesis of a second messenger, cyclic guanosine monophosphate–adenosine monophosphate (2′3′-cGAMP)4–7. This cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) activates STING8, which in turn activates the transcription factors interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), promoting the transcription of genes encoding type I interferons and other cytokines and mediators that stimulate a broader immune response. Exogenous 2′3′-cGAMP produced by malignant cells9 and other CDNs, including those produced by bacteria10–12 and synthetic CDNs used in cancer immunotherapy13,14, must traverse the cell membrane to activate STING in target cells. How these charged CDNs pass through the lipid bilayer is unknown. Here we used a genome-wide CRISPR-interference screen to identify the reduced folate carrier SLC19A1, a folate–organic phosphate antiporter, as the major transporter of CDNs. Depleting SLC19A1 in human cells inhibits CDN uptake and functional responses, and overexpressing SLC19A1 increases both uptake and functional responses. In human cell lines and primary cells ex vivo, CDN uptake is inhibited by folates as well as two medications approved for treatment of inflammatory diseases, sulfasalazine and the antifolate methotrexate. The identification of SLC19A1 as the major transporter of CDNs into cells has implications for the immunotherapeutic treatment of cancer13, host responsiveness to CDN-producing pathogenic microorganisms11 and—potentially—for some inflammatory diseases. A genome-wide CRISPR-interference screen is used to identify the reduced folate carrier SLC19A1 as the major transporter of cyclic dinucleotides in human cells, with potential roles in immunotherapeutic treatment of cancer, immune responses to pathogens and inflammatory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2973046581,"The first nuclear excited state of $^{229}$Th offers the unique opportunity for laser-based optical control of a nucleus. Its exceptional properties allow for the development of a nuclear optical clock which offers a complementary technology and is expected to outperform current electronic-shell based atomic clocks. The development of a nuclear clock was so far impeded by an imprecise knowledge of the energy of the $^{229}$Th nuclear excited state. In this letter we report a direct excitation energy measurement of this elusive state and constrain this to 8.28$\pm$0.17 eV. The energy is determined by spectroscopy of the internal conversion electrons emitted in-flight during the decay of the excited nucleus in neutral $^{229}$Th atoms. The nuclear excitation energy is measured via the valence electronic shell, thereby merging the fields of nuclear- and atomic physics to advance precision metrology. The transition energy between ground and excited state corresponds to a wavelength of 149.7$\pm$3.1 nm. These findings set the starting point for high-resolution nuclear laser spectroscopy and thus the development of a nuclear optical clock of unprecedented accuracy. A nuclear clock is expected to have a large variety of applications, ranging from relativistic geodesy over dark matter research to the observation of potential temporal variation of fundamental constants."

https://openalex.org/W2973094225,"The RAG endonuclease initiates Igh V(D)J assembly in B cell progenitors by joining D segments to JH segments, before joining upstream VH segments to DJH intermediates1. In mouse progenitor B cells, the CTCF-binding element (CBE)-anchored chromatin loop domain2 at the 3′ end of Igh contains an internal subdomain that spans the 5′ CBE anchor (IGCR1)3, the DH segments, and a RAG-bound recombination centre (RC)4. The RC comprises the JH-proximal D segment (DQ52), four JH segments, and the intronic enhancer (iEμ)5. Robust RAG-mediated cleavage is restricted to paired V(D)J segments flanked by complementary recombination signal sequences (12RSS and 23RSS)6. D segments are flanked downstream and upstream by 12RSSs that mediate deletional joining with convergently oriented JH-23RSSs and VH-23RSSs, respectively6. Despite 12/23 compatibility, inversional D-to-JH joining via upstream D-12RSSs is rare7,8. Plasmid-based assays have attributed the lack of inversional D-to-JH joining to sequence-based preference for downstream D-12RSSs9, as opposed to putative linear scanning mechanisms10,11. As RAG linearly scans convergent CBE-anchored chromatin loops4,12–14, potentially formed by cohesin-mediated loop extrusion15–18, we revisited its scanning role. Here we show that the chromosomal orientation of JH-23RSS programs RC-bound RAG to linearly scan upstream chromatin in the 3′ Igh subdomain for convergently oriented D-12RSSs and, thereby, to mediate deletional joining of all D segments except RC-based DQ52, which joins by a diffusion-related mechanism. In a DQ52-based RC, formed in the absence of JH segments, RAG bound by the downstream DQ52-RSS scans the downstream constant region exon-containing 3′ Igh subdomain, in which scanning can be impeded by targeted binding of nuclease-dead Cas9, by transcription through repetitive Igh switch sequences, and by the 3′ Igh CBE-based loop anchor. Each scanning impediment focally increases RAG activity on potential substrate sequences within the impeded region. High-resolution mapping of chromatin interactions in the RC reveals that such focal RAG targeting is associated with corresponding impediments to the loop extrusion process that drives chromatin past RC-bound RAG. V(D)J recombination in B cells involves cohesin-mediated extrusion of chromatin loops to present DNA targets for cleavage and joining."
https://openalex.org/W2972842164,"In the past two decades, high amplitude electromagnetic outbursts have been detected from dormant galaxies and often attributed to the tidal disruption of a star by the central black hole. X-ray emission from the Seyfert 2 galaxy GSN 069 (2MASX J01190869-3411305) at redshift z = 0.018 was first detected in 2010 July and implies an X-ray brightening of more than a factor of 240 over ROSAT observations performed 16 years earlier. The emission has smoothly decayed over time since 2010, possibly indicating a long-lived tidal disruption event. The X-ray spectrum is ultra-soft and can be described by accretion disc emission with luminosity proportional to the fourth power of the disc temperature during long-term evolution. Here we report observations of X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions from the nucleus of GSN 069 over the course of 54 days, 2018 December onwards. During these eruptions, the X-ray count rate increases by up to two orders of magnitude with event duration of just over 1 hour and recurrence time of about 9 hours. These eruptions are associated with fast spectral transitions between a cold and a warm phase in the accretion flow around a low-mass black hole (of approximately 4x10$^5$ solar masses) with peak X-ray luminosity of ~ 5x10$^{42}$ ergs per second. The warm phase has a temperature of about 120 eV, reminiscent of the typical soft X-ray excess, an almost universal thermal-like feature in the X-ray spectra of luminous active nuclei. If the observed properties are not unique to GSN 069, and assuming standard scaling of timescales with black hole mass and accretion properties, typical active galactic nuclei with more massive black holes can be expected to exhibit high-amplitude optical to X-ray variability on timescales as short as months or years."
https://openalex.org/W2972563556,"The Galactic Centre contains a supermassive black hole with a mass of 4 million suns within an environment that differs markedly from that of the Galactic disk. While the black hole is essentially quiescent in the broader context of active galactic nuclei, X-ray observations have provided evidence for energetic outbursts from its surroundings. Also, while the levels of star formation in the Galactic Centre have been approximately constant over the last few hundred Myr, there is evidence of elevated short-duration bursts, strongly influenced by interaction of the black hole with the enhanced gas density present within the ring-like Central Molecular Zone at Galactic longitude |l| < 0.7 degrees and latitude |b| < 0.2 degrees. The inner 200 pc region is characterized by large amounts of warm molecular gas, a high cosmic ray ionization rate, unusual gas chemistry, enhanced synchrotron emission, and a multitude of radio-emitting magnetised filaments, the origin of which has not been established. Here we report radio imaging that reveals bipolar bubbles spanning 1 degree x 3 degrees (140 parsecs x 430 parsecs), extending above and below the Galactic plane and apparently associated with the Galactic Centre. The structure is edge-brightened and bounded, with symmetry implying creation by an energetic event in the Galactic Centre. We estimate the age of the bubbles to be a few million years, with a total energy of 7 x 10^52 ergs. We postulate that the progenitor event was a major contributor to the increased cosmic-ray density in the Galactic Centre, and is in turn the principal source of the relativistic particles required to power the synchrotron emission of the radio filaments within and in the vicinity of the bubble cavities."
https://openalex.org/W2972437901,"Mixed community or environmental DNA marker gene sequencing has become a commonly used technique for biodiversity analyses in freshwater systems. Many cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) primer sets are now available for such work. The purpose of this study is to test whether COI primer choice affects the recovery of arthropod richness, beta diversity, and recovery of target assemblages in the benthos kick-net samples typically used in freshwater biomonitoring. We examine six commonly used COI primer sets on samples collected from six freshwater sites. Biodiversity analyses show that richness is sensitive to primer choice and the combined use of multiple COI amplicons recovers higher richness. Thus, to recover maximum richness, multiple primer sets should be used with COI metabarcoding. In ordination analyses based on community dissimilarity, samples consistently cluster by site regardless of amplicon choice or PCR replicate. Thus, for broadscale community analyses, overall beta diversity patterns are robust to COI marker choice. Recovery of traditional freshwater bioindicator assemblages such as Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera, Plectoptera, and Chironomidae as well as Arthropoda site indicators were differentially detected by each amplicon tested. This work will help future biodiversity and biomonitoring studies develop not just standardized, but optimized workflows that either maximize taxon-detection or the selection of amplicons for water quality or Arthropoda site indicators."
https://openalex.org/W2973040234,"Despite major progress in defining the functional roles of genes, a complete understanding of their influences is far from being realized, even in relatively simple organisms. A major milestone in this direction arose via the completion of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene-knockout collection (YKOC), which has enabled high-throughput reverse genetics, phenotypic screenings and analyses of synthetic-genetic interactions1-3. Ensuing experimental work has also highlighted some inconsistencies and mistakes in the YKOC, or genome instability events that rebalance the effects of specific knockouts4-6, but a complete overview of these is lacking. The identification and analysis of genes that are required for maintaining genomic stability have traditionally relied on reporter assays and on the study of deletions of individual genes, but whole-genome-sequencing technologies now enable-in principle-the direct observation of genome instability globally and at scale. To exploit this opportunity, we sequenced the whole genomes of nearly all of the 4,732 strains comprising the homozygous diploid YKOC. Here, by extracting information on copy-number variation of tandem and interspersed repetitive DNA elements, we describe-for almost every single non-essential gene-the genomic alterations that are induced by its loss. Analysis of this dataset reveals genes that affect the maintenance of various genomic elements, highlights cross-talks between nuclear and mitochondrial genome stability, and shows how strains have genetically adapted to life in the absence of individual non-essential genes."
https://openalex.org/W2912317099,"Thorium-229 is a unique case in nuclear physics: it presents a metastable first excited state Th-229m, just a few electronvolts above the nuclear ground state. This so-called isomer is accessible by VUV lasers, which allows transferring the amazing precision of atomic laser spectroscopy to nuclear physics. Being able to manipulate the Th-229 nuclear states at will opens up a multitude of prospects, from studies of the fundamental interactions in physics to applications as a compact and robust nuclear clock. However, direct optical excitation of the isomer or its radiative decay back to the ground state has not yet been observed, and a series of key nuclear structure parameters such as the exact energies and half-lives of the low-lying nuclear levels of Th-229 are yet unknown. Here we present the first active optical pumping into Th-229m. Our scheme employs narrow-band 29 keV synchrotron radiation to resonantly excite the second excited state, which then predominantly decays into the isomer. We determine the resonance energy with 0.07 eV accuracy, measure a half-life of 82.2 ps, an excitation linewidth of 1.70 neV, and extract the branching ratio of the second excited state into the ground and isomeric state respectively. These measurements allow us to re-evaluate gamma spectroscopy data that have been collected over 40~years."

https://openalex.org/W2972521387,"Background Obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS) are associated with high risk of cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. We assessed the effect of obesity and metabolic health status on left ventricular (LV) structure and function in subjects without overt heart disease. Methods In 789 subjects (58.8±13.0 years, 50.7% males) without overt heart disease, LV morphology and function were compared among 6 groups stratified by body mass index (BMI) (normal weight, overweight and obese) and metabolic health status (meeting ≤1 criterion of MetS excluding waist circumference defined as metabolically healthy; otherwise, metabolically unhealthy). Results LV ejection fraction (LVEF) was not different among the 6 groups (P>0.05). However, high BMI and poor metabolic health were associated with poorer global longitudinal strain (GLS), higher LV mass index (LVMI) and higher E/e′ (P<0.001). Poor metabolic health status was associated with greater adverse changes in LV structure and function than obesity, and among MetS components, high systolic blood pressure (SBP) showed the greatest impact. Higher SBP, BMI and triglycerides were independently associated with worse GLS, and higher SBP was also associated with worse LVMI and E/e´. GLS, LVMI and E/e´ worsened in proportion to the number of MetS criteria or continuous MetS scores. Adverse myocardial changes associated with obesity were significant in the metabolically healthy group, but not in the metabolically unhealthy group. Conclusions Obesity and poor metabolic health status were associated with subclinical decrement in LV systolic and diastolic function, and higher LV mass, but not with LVEF, in subjects without overt heart disease."
https://openalex.org/W2972959062,"Environmental and endogenous factors under genetic predisposition are considered to initiate the human intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. DNA methylation is an essential mechanism to ensure cell-specific gene expression for normal development and tissue stability. Aberrant epigenetic alterations play a pivotal role in several diseases, including osteoarthritis. However, epigenetic alternations, including DNA methylation, in IVD degeneration have not been evaluated. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively compare the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles of human IVD tissues, specifically nucleus pulpous (NP) tissues, with early and advanced stages of disc degeneration.Human NP tissues were used in this study. The samples were divided into two groups: early stage degeneration (n = 8, Pfirrmann's MRI grade: I-III) and advanced stage degeneration (n = 8, grade: IV). Genomic DNA was processed for genome-wide DNA methylation profiling using the Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip array. Extraction of raw methylation data, clustering and scatter plot of each group values of each sample were performed using a methylation module in GenomeStudio software. The identification of differentially methylated loci (DMLs) and the Gene Ontology (GO) analysis were performed using R software with the ChAMP package.Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed that early and advanced stage degenerated IVD samples segregated into two main clusters by their DNA methylome. A total of 220 DMLs were identified between early and advanced disc degeneration stages. Among these, four loci were hypomethylated and 216 loci were hypermethylated in the advanced disc degeneration stage. The GO enrichment analysis of genes containing DMLs identified two significant GO terms for biological processes, hemophilic cell adhesion and cell-cell adhesion.We conducted a genome-wide DNA methylation profile comparative study and observed significant differences in DNA methylation profiles between early and advanced stages of human IVD degeneration. These results implicate DNA methylation in the process of human IVD degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W2973121798,"Although doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiomyopathy causes lethal heart failure (HF), no early detection or effective treatment methods are available. The principal mechanisms of cardiotoxicity are considered to involve oxidative stress and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. However, the effect of DOX on cardiac fibroblasts at non-lethal concentrations remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the direct effect of doxorubicin on the activation of cardiac fibroblasts independent of cell death pathways. We first found that DOX induced α-SMA expression (marker of trans-differentiation) at a low concentration range, which did not inhibit cell viability. DOX also increased MMP1, IL-6, TGF-β and collagen expression in human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs). In addition, DOX promoted Akt and Smad phosphorylation. A Smad inhibitor prevented DOX-induced α-SMA and IL-6 protein expression. An PI3K inhibitor also prevented MMP1 mRNA expression in HCFs. These findings suggest that DOX directly induces fibrotic changes in HCFs via cell death-independent pathways. Furthermore, we confirmed that these responses are organ- and species-specific for HCFs based on experiments using different types of human and murine fibroblast cell lines. These results suggest potentially new mechanisms of DOX-induced cardiotoxicity from the viewpoint of fibrotic changes in cardiac fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2972507833,"The inactivation of antibiotic resistant Escherichia coli (Gram negative) and Staphylococcus aureus (Gram positive) seeded in greywater by bimetallic bio-nanoparticles was optimized by using response surface methodology (RSM). The bimetallic nanoparticles (Cu/Zn NPs) were synthesized in secondary metabolite of a novel fungal strain identified as Aspergillus iizukae EAN605 grown in pumpkin medium. Cu/Zn NPs were very effective for inhibiting growth of E. coli and S. aureus. The maximum inactivation was optimized with 0.028 mg mL-1 of Cu/Zn NPs, at pH 6 and after 60 min, at which the reduction of E. coli and S. aureus was 5.6 vs. 5.3 and 5.2 vs. 5.4 log reduction for actual and predicted values, respectively. The inactivation mechanism was described based on the analysis of untreated and treated bacterial cells by Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy (EDS), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) revealed a damage in the cell wall structure due to the effect of Cu/Zn NPs. Moreover, the Raman Spectroscopy showed that the Cu/Zn NPs led to degradation of carbohydrates and amino structures on the bacteria cell wall. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis confirmed that the destruction take place in the C-C bond of the functional groups available in the bacterial cell wall. The techno economic analysis revealed that the biosynthesis Cu/Zn NPs is economically feasible. These findings demonstrated that Cu/Zn NPs can effectively inhibit pathogenic bacteria in the greywater."
https://openalex.org/W2972740711,"Sepsis remains a significant health care burden, with high morbidities and mortalities. Patients with sepsis often require general anesthesia for procedures and imaging studies. Knowing that anesthetic drugs can pose immunomodulatory effects, it would be critical to understand the impact of anesthetics on sepsis pathophysiology. The volatile anesthetic sevoflurane is a common general anesthetic derived from ether as a prototype. Using a murine sepsis model induced by cecal ligation and puncture surgery, we examined the impact of sevoflurane on sepsis outcome. Different from volatile anesthetic isoflurane, sevoflurane exposure significantly improved the outcome of septic mice. This was associated with less apoptosis in the spleen. Because splenic apoptosis was largely attributed to the apoptosis of neutrophils, we examined the effect of sevoflurane on FasL-induced neutrophil apoptosis. Sevoflurane exposure significantly attenuated apoptosis. Sevoflurane did not affect the binding of FasL to the extracellular domain of Fas receptor. Instead, in silico analysis suggested that sevoflurane would bind to the interphase between Fas death domain (DD) and Fas-associated DD (FADD). The effect of sevoflurane on Fas DD-FADD interaction was examined using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). Sevoflurane attenuated FRET efficiency, indicating that sevoflurane hindered the interaction between Fas DD and FADD. The predicted sevoflurane binding site is known to play a significant role in Fas DD-FADD interaction, supporting our in vitro and in vivo apoptosis results.-Koutsogiannaki, S., Hou, L., Babazada, H., Okuno, T., Blazon-Brown, N., Soriano, S. G., Yokomizo, T., Yuki, K. The volatile anesthetic sevoflurane reduces neutrophil apoptosis via Fas death domain-Fas-associated death domain interaction."
https://openalex.org/W2973085537,"Neural correlates of mind wandering The ability to detect mind wandering as it occurs is an important step towards improving our understanding of this phenomenon and studying its effects on learning and performance. Current detection methods typically rely on observable behaviour in laboratory settings, which do not capture the underlying neural processes and may not translate well into real-world settings. We address both of these issues by recording electroencephalography (EEG) simultaneously from 15 participants during live lectures on research in orthopedic surgery. We performed traditional group-level analysis and found neural correlates of mind wandering during live lectures that are similar to those found in some laboratory studies, including a decrease in occipitoparietal alpha power and frontal, temporal, and occipital beta power. However, individual-level analysis of these same data revealed that patterns of brain activity associated with mind wandering were more broadly distributed and highly individualized than revealed in the group-level analysis. Mind wandering detection To apply these findings to mind wandering detection, we used a data-driven method known as common spatial patterns to discover scalp topologies for each individual that reflects their differences in brain activity when mind wandering versus attending to lectures. This approach avoids reliance on known neural correlates primarily established through group-level statistics. Using this method for individual-level machine learning of mind wandering from EEG, we were able to achieve an average detection accuracy of 80–83%. Conclusions Modelling mind wandering at the individual level may reveal important details about its neural correlates that are not reflected when using traditional observational and statistical methods. Using machine learning techniques for this purpose can provide new insight into the varieties of neural activity involved in mind wandering, while also enabling real-time detection of mind wandering in naturalistic settings."
https://openalex.org/W2972397351,"Within the world's oceans, regionally distinct ecological niches develop due to differences in water temperature, nutrients, food availability, predation and light intensity. This results in differences in the vertical dispersion of planktonic foraminifera on the global scale. Understanding the controls on these modern-day distributions is important when using these organisms for paleoceanographic reconstructions. As such, this study constrains modern depth habitats for the northern equatorial Indian Ocean, for 14 planktonic foraminiferal species (G. ruber, G. elongatus, G. pyramidalis, G. rubescens, T. sacculifer, G. siphonifera, G. glutinata, N. dutertrei, G. bulloides, G. ungulata, P. obliquiloculata, G. menardii, G. hexagonus, G. scitula) using stable isotopic signatures (δ18O and δ13C) and Mg/Ca ratios. We evaluate two aspects of inferred depth habitats: (1) the significance of the apparent calcification depth (ACD) calculation method/equations and (2) regional species-specific ACD controls. Through a comparison with five global, (sub)tropical studies we found the choice of applied equation and δ18Osw significant and an important consideration when comparing with the published literature. The ACDs of the surface mixed layer and thermocline species show a tight clustering between 73-109 m water depth coinciding with the deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM). Furthermore, the ACDs for the sub-thermocline species are positioned relative to secondary peaks in the local primary production. We surmise that food source plays a key role in the relative living depths for the majority of the investigated planktonic foraminifera within this oligotrophic environment of the Maldives and elsewhere in the tropical oceans."
https://openalex.org/W2973077705,"Background Resource allocation decisions for disease categories can be informed by proper estimates of the magnitude and distribution of total spending. In the backdrop of a high burden of Non-Communicable Diseases and Injuries (NCDI) in India, and a paucity of estimates on government spending on NCDI, this paper attempts to analyse public sector expenditure on NCDI spending in India. Methods Various recent budget documents of the Centre and States/Union Territories have been used to extract expenditure on NCDI. The aggregates thus arrived at have been analysed to estimate aggregate and state level per capita spending. State level spending have been compared against disease burden using DALYs. Patterns of spending on NCDI across states were also analysed together with state level poverty to observe possible patterns. Findings The total spending on NCDI by the government is low at less than 0.5% of GDP. NCDI spending is little more than one-fourth of total health spending of the country and most spending takes place at the state level (80%). The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare’s share in Central spending on NCDI is around 65%, and currently it spends 20% of its total health spending on NCDI. The gap between spending and DALYs is the most for the economically vulnerable states. Also, the states with high poverty levels also have low per capita expenditure on NCDI Interpretation India does not depend on donor funding for health. It will have to step up domestic funding to address the increasing disease burden of NCDIs and to reduce the high out-of-pocket expenditure on NCDI. Policies on NCDI need to focus on UHC, service integration and personnel gaps."

Different from existing deep learning-based method which mainly extracting black-box features from the raw sensor data, we propose a hierarchical multi-view aggregation network based on multi-view feature spaces. Specifically, we first construct various views of feature spaces for each individual sensor in terms of white-box features and black-box features. Then our model learns a unified representation for multi-view features by aggregating views in a hierarchical context from the aspect of feature level, position level and modality level. We design three aggregation modules corresponding to each level aggregation respectively. Based on the idea of non-local operation and attention, our fusion method is able to capture the correlation between features and leverage the relationship across different sensor position and modality. We comprehensively evaluate our method on 12 human activity benchmark datasets and the resulting accuracy outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches."

Thus, the objective of this study was to identify miRNAs selectively expressed in HCC with gross VI and investigate their prognostic significance. Materials and methods Eligible two datasets (accession number: GSE20594 and GSE67140) were collected from the National Center for Biotechnology Information’s (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to compare miRNAs expression between HCC with and without gross VI. Differentially expressed miRNAs were externally validated using expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Prognostic significance and predicted functions of selected miRNAs for HCC were also investigated. Results Thirty-five miRNAs were differentially expressed between HCC with and without gross VI in both datasets. Among them, three miRNAs were validated using TCGA database. miR-99a, miR-100, and miR-148a were downregulated to a greater extent in patients with HCC and gross VI than in those with HCC but no gross VI. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed discriminatory power of these miRNAs in predicting gross VI. Multivariate survival analysis revealed that types of surgery, advanced tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage, and low expression of miR-100-5p were independently associated with tumor recurrence. It also revealed that types of surgery, advanced TNM stage, low expression of miR-100-5p and miR-148a-3p were independent risk factors for overall survival (OS) after hepatic resection for HCC. A text mining analysis revealed that these miRNAs were linked to multifaceted hallmarks of cancer, including “invasion and metastasis.” Conclusions Low expressions of miR-100-5p and miR-148a-3p were associated with gross VI and poor survival of patients after hepatic resection for HCC."

Results A total of 83 patients were included. Corneal astigmatism induction was 2.65 ± 2.52 D (0.4–11.8). The impact of pterygium on the ocular surface parameters compared to matched controls was seen in: conjunctival hyperemia (control 1.55±0.39/pterygium 2.14±0.69; p = 0.0001), tear meniscus height (control 0.24±0.05 mm/pterygium 0.36±0.14mm; p 0.0002), meiboscore lower eyelid (control 0.29±0.64/pterygium 1.38±0.95; p 0.0001) and meiboscore upper eyelid (control 0.53±0.62/pterygium 0.98±0.75; p = 0.0083). We found a high number of pterygium patients (88%) presented meibomian gland alterations. Interestingly, meibomian gland loss was coincident to the localization of the pterygium in 54% of the upper and 77% lower lids. Conclusion Pterygium greatly impacts on ocular surface by inducing direct alterations in the pattern of meibomian glands besides corneal irregularities, conjunctival hyperemia and lacrimal film alterations, inducing significant symptoms and potential signs of dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W2972308769,"In haplodiplontic lineages, sexual reproduction occurs in haploid parents without meiosis. Although widespread in multicellular lineages such as brown algae (Phaeophyceae), haplodiplontic gametogenesis has been little studied at the molecular level. We addressed this by generating an annotated reference transcriptome for the gametophytic phase of the sugar kelp, Saccharina latissima. Transcriptional profiles of microscopic male and female gametophytes were analysed at four time points during the transition from vegetative growth to gametogenesis. Gametogenic signals resulting from a switch in culture irradiance from red to white light activated a core set of genes in a sex-independent manner, involving rapid activation of ribosome biogenesis, transcription and translation related pathways, with several acting at the post-transcriptional or post-translational level. Additional genes regulating nutrient acquisition and key carbohydrate-energy pathways were also identified. Candidate sex-biased genes under gametogenic conditions had potentially key roles in controlling female- and male-specific gametogenesis. Among these were several sex-biased or -specific E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases that may have important regulatory roles. Females specifically expressed several genes that coordinate gene expression and/or protein degradation, and the synthesis of inositol-containing compounds. Other female-biased genes supported parallels with oogenesis in divergent multicellular lineages, in particular reactive oxygen signalling via an NADPH-oxidase. Males specifically expressed the hypothesised brown algal sex-determining factor. Male-biased expression mainly involved upregulation of genes that control mitotic cell proliferation and spermatogenesis in other systems, as well as multiple flagella-related genes. Our data and results enhance genome-level understanding of gametogenesis in this ecologically and economically important multicellular lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2972542920,"Medical experts are one of the main sources used by journalists in reporting on medical science. This study aims to 1) identify problems that medical experts encounter in contacts with the media representatives, 2) elucidate their attitudes about interactions with journalists and 3) reflect on solutions that could improve the quality of medical journalism. By using in-depth interviews, focus groups and a survey directed to 600 medical experts in 21 countries, this cohort study elucidates medical experts’ experiences and views on participating in popular media. A strong interest in interacting with the media was identified among the experts, where nearly one fifth of the respondents in the survey claimed that they contacted the media more than 10 times per year. Six obstacles for improving the quality of medical reporting in the media were found: deadlines, headlines, choice of topic or angle, journalist’s level of medical knowledge, differences in professional culture and colleagues’ opinions. The main concern among experts was that short deadlines and exaggerated headlines could harm journalistic quality. It is possible that this is partly due to ongoing changes in the media landscape with many new platforms and less control functions. Nevertheless, for several reasons many experts have great interest in interacting with the media, something that could contribute to better communication and fewer misunderstandings. Our results highlight factors like expert networks, media training for scientists and regular meetings that may facilitate communication between medical experts and medical reporters."
https://openalex.org/W2972956061,"Snake venoms are complex protein mixtures with different biological activities that can act in both their preys and human victims. Many of these proteins play a role in prey capture and in the digestive process of these animals. It is known that some snakes are resistant to the toxicity of their own venom by mechanisms not yet fully elucidated. However, it was observed in the Laboratory of Herpetology of Instituto Butantan that some Bothrops moojeni individuals injured by the same snake species showed mortalities caused by envenoming effects. This study analyzed the biochemical composition of 13 venom and plasma samples from Bothrops moojeni specimens to assess differences in their protein composition. Application of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) showed distinct venom protein profiles, but very homogeneous plasma profiles. Western Blotting (WB) was performed with plasma samples, which were submitted to incubation with the respective venom. Some individuals showed an immunorecognized band zone around 25 kDa, indicating interaction between the same individual plasma and venom proteins. Crossed-WB assay using non-self-plasma and venom showed that this variability is due to venom protein composition instead of plasma composition. These venoms presented higher caseinolytic, collagenolytic and coagulant activities than the venoms without these regions recognized by WB. Mass spectrometry analyses performed on two individuals revealed that these individuals present, in addition to higher protein concentrations, other exclusive proteins in their composition. When these same two samples were tested in vivo, the results also showed higher lethality in these venoms, but lower hemorrhagic activity than in the venoms without these regions recognized by WB. In conclusion, some Bothrops moojeni specimens differ in venom composition, which may have implications in envenomation. Moreover, the high individual venom variability found in this species demonstrates the importance to work with individual analyses in studies involving intraspecific venom variability and venom evolution."
https://openalex.org/W2972434605,"We evaluated the durability of cadmium telluride (CdTe) solar cells upon proton beam irradiation as well as the possibility of achieving a dosimeter usable in proton beam therapy by applying 100 MeV of pencil beam scanning (PBS) irradiation. Specifically, a 100 MeV proton PBS beam was applied at irradiation doses of 0, 1012, 1013, 1014, and 1015 cm-2. According to the results, the remaining factors (defined as the ratio of the degraded value to the initial value) of open-circuit voltage (Voc), short-circuit current (Jsc), fill-factor (FF), and efficiency (ƞ) which are solar cell performance parameters, were approximately 89%, 44%, 69%, and 30%, respectively, compared to those of the reference cell (without irradiation) at the highest dose of 1×1015 cm-2. In particular, the conversion efficiency, which is the main factor, was approximately 70% of that of the reference cell even at a high fluence of 1×1014 cm-2. In addition, we observed the projected range of the hydrogen atoms based on the PBS beam energy using the Tool for Particle Simulation software and assessed the amount of fluence accumulated in a CdTe cell. As the energy increased, the fluence accumulated inside the cell tended to decrease owing to the characteristics of the Bragg peak of the proton. Thus, the radiation damage to the cell induced by the proton beam was reduced. The results of this study are expected to provide valuable reference information for research on dosimetry sensors composed of thin-film solar cells, serving as the basis for future application in proton beam therapy with CdTe solar cells."
https://openalex.org/W2972643862,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeted to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) have been demonstrated to be effective for lung cancer patients with an ALK fusion gene. Application of liquid biopsy, i.e., detection and quantitation of the fusion product in plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA), could improve clinical practice. To detect ALK fusions, because fusion breakpoints occur somewhere in intron 19 of the ALK gene, sequencing of the entire intron is required to locate breakpoints.We constructed a target sequencing system using an adapter and a set of primers that cover the entire ALK intron 19. This system can amplify fragments, including breakpoints, regardless of fusion partners. The data analysis pipeline firstly detected fusions by alignment to selected target sequences, and then quantitated the fusion alleles aligning to the identified breakpoint sequences. Performance was validated using 20 cfDNA samples from ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer patients and samples from 10 healthy volunteers. Sensitivity and specificity were 50 and 100%, respectively.We demonstrated that PCR-based target sequencing using a tiling primer set and two-step mapping/alignment quantitatively detected ALK fusions in cfDNA from lung cancer patients. The system offers an alternative to existing approaches based on hybridization capture."
https://openalex.org/W2972324445,"The South American plains vizcacha, Lagostomus maximus inhabits primarily the Pampean and adjoining Espinal, Monte and Chaquenean regions of Argentina. In order to study the population genetic structure of L. maximus, a fragment of 560 bp of the mitochondrial DNA hypervariable region 1from 90 individuals collected from the 3 subspecies and 8 groups along Argentina was amplified and analyzed. We found 9 haplotypes. The haplotype network did not show an apparent phylogeographical signal. Although low levels of genetic variation were found in all the subspecies and groups analyzed, a radiation of L. maximus would have occurred from the North and Center of the Pampean region toward the rest of its geographic range in Argentina. Low levels of genetic diversity, the existence of a single genetically distinct population in Argentina and changes of its effective size indicate that metapopulation processes and changes in human population dynamics during the late-Holocene were important factors shaping the population genetic structure of L. maximus in Argentina."
https://openalex.org/W2973177986,"Marital conflict is integral to children's psychosocial well-being. Extant research has shown that the effects of marital conflict on children are likely to vary by gender, indicating that gender plays a significant and complex role in the relationship between marital conflict and child adjustment. Focusing on gender, this study investigates the link between specific marital conflict tactics and children's mental health symptoms in families in which the parents live together.This study gathered data from 799 children and their parents in Japan by means of a questionnaire focusing on marital conflict and child behavioral problems. Marital conflict (verbal aggression, physical aggression, stonewalling, avoidance-capitulation, child involvement, and cooperation) was assessed using a Conflict and Problem-Solving Scale. Children's behavioral problems (externalizing and internalizing symptoms) were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire.The findings highlight the significant impact of specific interparental conflict on children's behavioral problems, demonstrating that there are differences according to the child's gender. More specifically, multivariate analyses targeting boys revealed that cooperation was significantly inversely associated with externalizing problems and internalizing problems, while avoidance-capitulation and verbal aggression were significantly positively associated with externalizing problems. In contrast, multivariate analyses targeting girls revealed that cooperation was significantly inversely associated with externalizing problems and internalizing problems, while avoidance-capitulation and stonewalling were significantly positively associated with internalizing problems.This study reveals that interparental conflict is associated with children's behavioral problems. Constructive marital conflict was significantly inversely associated with externalizing and internalizing problems in both boys and girls. Meanwhile, destructive marital conflict (i.e., avoidance-capitulation and verbal aggression) was significantly positively associated with externalizing problems in boys and significantly positively associated with internalizing problems in girls. These findings contribute to the substantial literature demonstrating the relationship between family processes and the development of disruptive behavior disorders in children."
https://openalex.org/W2973211354,"Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is biodegradable and renewable and thus considered as a promising alternative to petroleum-based plastics. However, PHB production is costly due to expensive carbon sources for culturing PHB-accumulating microorganisms under sterile conditions. We discovered a hyper PHB-accumulating denitrifying bacterium, Zobellella denitrificans ZD1 (referred as strain ZD1 hereafter) capable of using non-sterile crude glycerol (a waste from biodiesel production) and nitrate to produce high PHB yield under saline conditions. Nevertheless, the underlying genetic mechanisms of PHB production in strain ZD1 have not been elucidated. In this study, we discovered a complete pathway of glycerol conversion to PHB, a novel PHB synthesis gene cluster, a salt-tolerant gene cluster, denitrifying genes, and an assimilatory nitrate reduction gene cluster in the ZD1 genome. Interestingly, the novel PHB synthesis gene cluster was found to be conserved among marine Gammaproteobacteria. Higher levels of PHB accumulation were linked to higher expression levels of the PHB synthesis gene cluster in ZD1 grown with glycerol and nitrate under saline conditions. Additionally, a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas type-I-E antiviral system was found in the ZD1 genome along with a long spacer list, in which most of the spacers belong to either double-stranded DNA viruses or unknown phages. The results of the genome analysis revealed strain ZD1 used the novel PHB gene cluster to produce PHB from non-sterile crude glycerol under saline conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2972530432,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying genetic variants associated with complex diseases. However, association analyses between genotypes and phenotypes are not straightforward due to the complex relationships between genetic and environmental factors. Moreover, multiple correlated phenotypes further complicate such analyses. To resolve this complexity, we present an analysis using structural equation modeling (SEM). Unlike current methods that focus only on identifying direct associations between diseases and genetic variants such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), our method introduces the effects of intermediate phenotypes, which are related phenotypes distinct from the target, into the systematic genetic study of diseases. Moreover, we consider multiple diseases simultaneously in a single model. The procedure can be summarized in four steps: 1) selection of informative SNPs, 2) extraction of latent variables from the selected SNPs, 3) investigation of the relationships among intermediate phenotypes and diseases, and 4) construction of an SEM. As a result, a quantitative map can be drawn that simultaneously shows the relationship among multiple SNPs, phenotypes, and diseases. In this study, we considered two correlated diseases, hypertension and type 2 diabetes (T2D), which are known to have a substantial overlap in their disease mechanism and have significant public health implications. As intermediate phenotypes for these diseases, we considered three obesity-related phenotypes-subscapular skin fold thickness, body mass index, and waist circumference-as traits representing subcutaneous adiposity, overall adiposity, and abdominal adiposity, respectively. Using GWAS data collected from the Korea Association Resource (KARE) project, we applied the proposed SEM process. Among 327,872 SNPs, 24 informative SNPs were selected in the first step (p<1.0E-05). Ten latent variables were generated in step 2. After an exploratory analysis, we established a path diagram among phenotypes and diseases in step 3. Finally, in step 4, we produced a quantitative map with paths moving from specific SNPs to hypertension through intermediate phenotypes and T2D. The resulting model had high goodness-of-fit measures (χ2 = 536.52, NFI = 0.997, CFI = 0.998, GFI = 0.995, AGFI = 0.993, RMSEA = 0.012)."
https://openalex.org/W2972594612,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a cancer therapy that capitalizes on cancer-specific porphyrin accumulation. We have investigated this phenomenon to propose the following three conclusions: 1) the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is closely related to both nitric oxide (NO) and heme carrier protein-1 (HCP-1), 2) NO inactivates ferrochelatase, and thus, the intracellular porphyrin levels in the cells are increased by the administration of an NO donor after 5-aminolevulinic acid treatment, 3) HCP-1 transports not only heme but also other porphyrins. Since NO stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α, resulting in the upregulation of heme biosynthesis, HCP-1 expression can be increased by HIF-1α stabilization. In this study, we determined whether NO regulates HCP-1 expression by stabilizing HIF-1α expression. For this purpose, rat gastric cancer cell line RGK36 was treated with L-arginine or N6-(1-iminoethyl)-L-lysine (L-NIL). L-arginine treatment increased the intracellular NO concentration, and both HCP-1 and HIF-1α expression, while L-NIL treatment decreased them. Cytotoxicity of PDT was enhanced by L-arginine, following intracellular hemato-porphyrin dihydrochloride (HpD) accumulation. Both Cytotoxicity of PDT and HpD accumulation were decreased by L-NIL. The HCP-1 and HIF-1α expression, intracellular HpD accumulation and PDT cytotoxicity were decreased by 2-methoxyestradiol, which is a HIF-1α inhibitor. Moreover, these phenomena were not increased by a combination of both L-arginine and 2-Me. Thus, HCP-1 can be a downstream target of HIF-1α. These effects were also induced in the human gastric cancer cell line MKN45. Taken together, we conclude that HCP-1 expression is regulated by NO via HIF-1α stabilization."

For these individuals it is essential to find novel, cost-effective solutions to meet their needs. Service dogs are dogs that are specially trained to assist individuals with functional impairments and may be able to improve these individuals' quality of life at a reasonable cost, i.e. be cost effective. Cost-effectiveness analyses are used to illustrate the cost of an intervention in relation to its effects and provide important input to decision-makers when setting priorities.The aim of this study is to assess the cost effectiveness of a certified physical service dog and a diabetes alert dog compared to a regular companion dog.Costs, life years and quality-adjusted life years were estimated over a 10-year time horizon using a decision-analytic model built upon evidence from the""service and hearing dog project"". The primary outcome was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio expressed as cost per gained quality-adjusted life year. The analysis was conducted from a societal perspective. Costs and effects were discounted with 3% per annum and reported in USD.Compared to a regular companion dog, a physical service dog is cost saving [-6,000 USD] and gives the dog owner more quality-adjusted life years [0.28]. The diabetes alert dog is also cost effective in comparison with a regular companion dog [-4,500 USD, 0.06 QALYs].This study indicates that a certified service dog is cost saving in comparison with a regular companion dog for individuals with functional impairments or chronic diseases. The uncertainty of the analysis implies that further studies are needed in order to confirm these results. Nevertheless, physical service dogs and diabetes alert dogs show potential to be a valuable support and decision analytic models are useful tools to provide this information."
https://openalex.org/W2972306017,"Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a major cause of birth defects ranging from developmental disorders to stillbirth. Most newborns affected by CMV do not present with symptoms at birth but are at risk of sequelae at later stages of their childhood. Stored dried blood spots (DBS) taken at birth can be used for retrospective diagnosis of hereditary diseases, but detection of pathogens is challenged by potentially low pathogen concentrations in the small blood volume available in a DBS. Here we test four different extraction methods for optimal recovery of CMV DNA from DBS at low to high CMV titers. The recovery efficiencies varied widely between the different extractions (from 3% to 100%) with the most efficient method extracting up to 113-fold more CMV DNA than the least efficient and 8-fold more than the reference protocol. Furthermore, we amplified four immunomodulatory CMV genes from the extracted DNA: the UL40 and UL111A genes which occur as functional knockouts in some circulating CMV strains, and the highly variable UL146 and US28 genes. The PCRs specifically amplified the CMV genes at all tested titers with sufficient quality for sequencing and genotyping. In summary, we here report an extraction method for optimal recovery of CMV DNA from DBSs that can be used for both detection of CMV and for genotyping of polymorphic CMV genes in congenital CMV infection."

Corneal higher-order aberrations (HOAs) for the right eye were measured with a wavefront analyzer (KR-1W, Topcon) and calculated for the central 6.0-mm zone. Corneal curvature radius (CR), corneal astigmatism, and axial length (AL) were also measured and their correlation with corneal SA was assessed.The right eyes of 657 participants (336 male, 321 female) were analyzed. The mean age of the subjects was 57.2 ± 10.3 years (mean ± SD). The mean corneal SA (Zernike spherical aberration coefficient C40) was 0.188 ± 0.095 μm (-0.242 to 0.613). The SAs in about three-quarters of all subjects were between 0.10 and 0.30 μm. The root mean squares of total corneal HOAs and the third- and fourth-order aberrations were 0.629 ± 0.250 μm, 0.539 ± 0.236 μm, and 0.269 ± 0.110 μm, respectively. Corneal SA showed weak significant correlations with CR (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, r = -0.177, p < 0.001), corneal astigmatism (r = -0.142, p < 0.001), AL (r = -0.168, p < 0.001), and age (r = -0.085, p < 0.05).This finding may be beneficial for selecting aspheric intraocular lens in this population."

In a sample of 1818 participants (52% female, mean age 54±12 years) global longitudinal peak systolic strain (GL-PSS, n = 1218), systolic (GL-SSR, n = 1506), and early (GL-EDSR, n = 1506) and late diastolic strain rates (GL-LDSR, n = 1500) were derived from 2D speckle tracking analysis. From a subgroup of 323 individuals without any cardiovascular risk factor, sex- and age-specific reference values were computed. GL-PSS, GL-SSR, and GL-EDSR were associated with sex, GL-EDSR decreased and GL-LDSR increased with age. In the total sample, dyslipidemia was associated with altered GL-PSS, GL-SSR, and GL-EDSR in women but not in men, whereas obesity was associated with less favorable GL-PSS and GL-EDSR in either sex. Hypertension impacted more adversely on systolic and diastolic myocardial deformation in women compared to men (all p<0.01).The female myocardium appeared more vulnerable to high blood pressure and dyslipidemia when compared to men, while obesity was associated with adverse myocardial deformation in either sex. The reference values for echocardiographic myocardial deformation provided for a non-diseased population and their here reported associations with cardiovascular risk factors will inform future observational and intervention studies regarding i) effect sizes and power calculation, ii) cross-study comparisons, and iii) categorization of myocardial deformation in specific patient groups."

Our aim is to evaluate the posterior part of CW in association with different size of vertebral arteries (VA) in healthy volunteers.The present study was based on a sample of 923 healthy volunteers who were examined from 2013 through 2018. The duplex ultrasonographic examination of the extracranial vertebral (VA) and carotid arteries was performed. VA was defined as hypoplastic (VAH) when VA diameter in the entire course was less than 2.5 mm. All the participants underwent magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) examination. All the component vessels of the circle of Willis were assessed in each individual. We classified the posterior communicating artery (PCoA) as presence PCoA, absence/hypoplastic PCoA and fetal-type posterior circle of Willis (FCW) in which the major stem of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) arises from ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA). The comparison of the posterior part of CW was made in subjects with normal VA and VAH of a different degree (communicating with basilar artery (VAH-BA) and not communicating with the basilar artery (VAH-PICA)).FCW was found in 15.9% of subjects, bilaterally-in 2.3%. FCW was more frequent in individuals with VAH than in those with normal VA (accordingly, 28.8% vs. 13.5%, p<0.001. Moreover FCW was recorded in 50% of the subjects with VA-PICA in comparison with 13.5% of those with normal VA and 22.8% with VAH-BA, p<0.005. On the contrary, absence/hypoplasia of both PCoA was mostly found in the group with normal VA in comparison with VAH-BA and VAH-PICA (accordingly, 50.7%, 38.6% and 12.5%, p<0.01).Individuals with VAH have a different pattern of the posterior part of CW in comparison with those with normal VA. With the increasing degree of VAH, the proportion of FCW increases, while the proportion of absence/hypoplastic of both PCoA decreases."
https://openalex.org/W2972873175,"Alkaline-Surfactant-Polymer (ASP) flooding is an efficient chemical enhanced oil recovery (EOR) method gaining popularity in the industry. In this paper, the characteristics of three flooding systems with alkyl aryl sulfonate surfactants and a weak alkali concentration, strong alkali concentration and no alkali concentration were investigated. The emulsification, interfacial tension, viscosity, stability, adsorption resistance as well as the oil displacement effect for the flooding systems and simulated oil of the fourth plant of the Daqing Oilfield were measured. The results show that the three alkyl aryl sulphonates surfactants have different emulsification indexes with the weak and strong alkali concentrations possessing the best and worst indexes at 67.00% and 55.17% respectively, and the combination of surfactant and no alkali concentration with an emulsification index of 63.03%. The interfacial tension between the three flooding systems and the simulated oil of the fourth plant of Daqing Oilfield gets as low as 10−3 mN/m, and reduces as far as 10-4mN/m in certain points detected, all with good anti-dilution performance. In terms of interfacial tension stability, the three flooding systems are seen to reach ultra-low interfacial tension within 90 days. For viscosity stability, the addition of a strong alkali and a weak alkali further hydrolyzes the polymer, leading to an initial rise in viscosity and viscosity retention rates above 80%. In terms of adsorption resistance, ultra-low interfacial tension occurs adsorption is reduced by five times for the strong and weak alkali systems, and reduced by four times for the alkali-free system. These results show that all three combination flooding systems have good adsorption resistance. In the evaluation of oil displacement effect, the average chemical flooding recovery rate (33.83%) of the weak alkali-surfactant-polymer (ASP) system is nearly three percent higher (31.34%) than that of the surfactant-polymer (SP) system, and over seven percent higher (26.71%) than that of the strong ASP system."

https://openalex.org/W2973162005,"Visual and proprioceptive information is used differently at different phases of a reach. The time at which a target perturbation occurs during a reach therefore has a significant impact on how an individual can compensate for this perturbation though online control. With healthy ageing, there are notable changes to both sensory and motor control that impact motor performance. However, how the online control process changes with age is not yet fully understood. We used a target perturbation paradigm and manipulated the time at which a target perturbation occurred during the reach to investigate how healthy ageing impacts sensorimotor control. We measured how the latency of the correction and the magnitude of the corrective response changed with perturbation time and quantified the difference across groups using a percentage difference measure. For both groups, online corrections to early perturbations were more easily accounted for than those to late perturbations, despite late perturbations eliciting faster correction latencies. While there was no group difference in accuracy, older participants were slower overall and produced a correction to a change in target location proportionally less often despite similar correction latencies. We speculate that the differences in the time during the reach that the correction is first identified may explain the differences in correction latencies observed between the perturbation time conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2972981503,"Introduction Genome-Wide Association Studies suggest glutathione S transferase C terminal domain (GSTCD) may play a role in development of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. We aimed to define the potential role of GSTCD in airway inflammation and contraction using precision cut lung slice (PCLS) from wild-type (GSTCD+/+) and GSTCD knockout mice (GSTCD-/-). Methods PCLS from age and gender matched GSTCD+/+ and GSTCD-/- mice were prepared using a microtome. Contraction was studied after applying either a single dose of Methacholine (Mch) (1 μM) or different doses of Mch (0.001 to 100 μM). Each slice was then treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or vehicle (PBS) for 24 hours. PCLS contraction in the same airway was repeated before and after stimulation. Levels of TNFα production was also measured. Results There were no differences in contraction of PCLS from GSTCD+/+ and GSTCD-/- mice in response to Mch (EC50 of GSTCD+/+ vs GSTCD-/- animals: 100.0±20.7 vs 107.7±24.5 nM, p = 0.855, n = 6 animals/group). However, after LPS treatment, there was a 31.6% reduction in contraction in the GSTCD-/- group (p = 0.023, n = 6 animals). There was no significant difference between PBS and LPS treatment groups in GSTCD+/+ animals. We observed a significant increase in TNFα production induced by LPS in GSTCD-/- lung slices compared to the GSTCD+/+ LPS treated slices. Conclusion GSTCD knockout mice showed an increased responsiveness to LPS (as determined by TNFα production) that was accompanied by a reduced contraction of small airways in PCLS. These data highlight an unrecognised potential function of GSTCD in mediating inflammatory signals that affect airway responses."
https://openalex.org/W2972457728,"In low-level perceptual tasks and reading tasks, deaf individuals show a redistribution of spatial visual attention toward the parafoveal and peripheral visual fields. In the present study, the experiment adopted the modified flanker paradigm and utilized a lexical decision task to investigate how these unique visual skills may influence foveal lexical access in deaf individuals. It was predicted that irrelevant linguistic stimuli presented in parafoveal vision, during a lexical decision task, would produce a larger interference effect for deaf college student readers if the stimuli acted as distractors during the task. The results showed there was a larger interference effect in deaf college student readers compared to the interference effect observed in participants with typical levels of hearing. Furthermore, deaf college student readers with low-skilled reading levels showed a larger interference effect than those with high-skilled reading levels. The current study demonstrates that the redistribution of spatial visual attention toward the parafoveal visual regions in deaf students impacts foveal lexical processing, and this effect is modulated by reading skill. The findings are discussed in relation to the potential effect that enhanced parafoveal attention may have on everyday reading for deaf individuals."
https://openalex.org/W2973016723,"Fluorescent cytometry refers to the quantification of cell physical properties and surface biomarkers using fluorescently-tagged antibodies. The generally preferred techniques to perform such measurements are flow cytometry, which performs rapid single cell analysis by flowing cells one-by-one through a channel, and microscopy, which eliminates the complexity of the flow channel, offering multi-cell analysis at a lesser throughput. Low-magnification image-based cytometers, also called “cell astronomy” systems, hold promise of simultaneously achieving both instrumental simplicity and high throughput. In this magnification regime, a single cell is mapped to a handful of pixels in the image. While very attractive, this idea has, so far, not been proven to yield quantitative results of cell-labeling, mainly due to the poor signal-to-noise ratio present in those images and to partial volume effects. In this work we present a cell astronomy system that, when coupled with custom-developed algorithms, is able to quantify cell intensities and diameters reliably. We showcase the system using calibrated MESF beads and fluorescently stained leukocytes, achieving good population identification in both cases. The main contribution of the proposed system is in the development of a novel algorithm, H-EM, that enables inter-cluster separation at a very low magnification regime (2x). Such algorithm provides more accurate brightness estimates than DAOSTORM when compared to manual analysis, while fitting cell location, brightness, diameter, and background level concurrently. The algorithm first performs Fisher discriminant analysis to detect bright spots. From each spot an expectation-maximization algorithm is initialized over a heterogeneous mixture model (H-EM), this algorithm recovers both the cell fluorescence and diameter with sub-pixel accuracy while discriminating the background noise. Finally, a recursive splitting procedure is applied to discern individual cells in cell clusters."
https://openalex.org/W2973051192,"This paper describes the process of adapting the Stanford Coreference resolution module to the Basque language, taking into account the characteristics of the language. The module has been integrated in a linguistic analysis pipeline obtaining an end-to-end coreference resolution system for the Basque language. The adaptation process explained can benefit and facilitate other languages with similar characteristics in the implementation of their coreference resolution systems. During the experimentation phase, we have demonstrated that language-specific features have a noteworthy effect on coreference resolution, obtaining a gain in CoNLL score of 7.07 with respect to the baseline system. We have also analysed the effect that preprocessing has in coreference resolution, comparing the results obtained with automatic mentions versus gold mentions. When gold mentions are provided, the results increase 11.5 points in CoNLL score in comparison with results obtained when automatic mentions are used. The contribution of each sieve is analysed concluding that morphology is essential for agglutinative languages to obtain good performance in coreference resolution. Finally, an error analysis of the coreference resolution system is presented which have revealed our system’s weak points and help to determine the improvements of the system. As a result of the error analysis, we have enriched the Basque coreference resolution adding new two sieves, obtaining an improvement of 0.24 points in CoNLL F1 when automatic mentions are used and of 0.39 points when the gold mentions are provided."
