https://openalex.org/W2335950049,"Numerous clinical and population studies have demonstrated that increased serum bilirubin levels protect against cardiovascular and metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. Bilirubin is a potent antioxidant, and the beneficial actions of moderate increases in plasma bilirubin have been thought to be due to the antioxidant effects of this bile pigment. In the present study, we found that bilirubin has a new function as a ligand for PPARα. We show that bilirubin can bind directly to PPARα and increase transcriptional activity. When we compared biliverdin, the precursor to bilirubin, on PPARα transcriptional activation to known PPARα ligands, WY 14,643 and fenofibrate, it showed that fenofibrate and biliverdin have similar activation properties. Treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with biliverdin suppressed lipid accumulation and upregulated PPARα target genes. We treated wild-type and PPARα KO mice on a high fat diet with fenofibrate or bilirubin for seven days and found that both signal through PPARα dependent mechanisms. Furthermore, the effect of bilirubin on lowering glucose and reducing body fat percentage was blunted in PPARα KO mice. These data demonstrate a new function for bilirubin as an agonist of PPARα, which mediates the protection from adiposity afforded by moderate increases in bilirubin."
https://openalex.org/W2341259444,"The endothelial cells that form capillaries in the brain are highly specialized, with tight junctions that minimize paracellular transport and an array of broad-spectrum efflux pumps that make drug delivery to the brain extremely challenging. One of the major limitations in blood-brain barrier research and the development of drugs to treat central nervous system diseases is the lack of appropriate cell lines. Recent reports indicate that the derivation of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (hBMECs) from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may provide a solution to this problem. Here we demonstrate the derivation of hBMECs extended to two new human iPSC lines: BC1 and GFP-labeled BC1. These hBMECs highly express adherens and tight junction proteins VE-cadherin, ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-5. The addition of retinoic acid upregulates VE-cadherin expression, and results in a significant increase in transendothelial electrical resistance to physiological values. The permeabilities of tacrine, rhodamine 123, and Lucifer yellow are similar to values obtained for MDCK cells. The efflux ratio for rhodamine 123 across hBMECs is in the range 2–4 indicating polarization of efflux transporters. Using the rod assay to assess cell organization in small vessels and capillaries, we show that hBMECs resist elongation with decreasing diameter but show progressive axial alignment. The derivation of hBMECs with a blood-brain barrier phenotype from the BC1 cell line highlights that the protocol is robust. The expression of GFP in hBMECs derived from the BC1-GFP cell line provides an important new resource for BBB research."

However, little is known about the resistance of Miscanthus spp. to cadmium (Cd). To determine any differences in resistance of Miscanthus to Cd, we examined plant growth, net photosynthetic rate (Pn), activities of anti-oxidant and C4 photosynthetic enzymes, concentrations of Cd in leaves and roots, and observed the chloroplast structure in three Miscanthus species treated with 0, 10, 50, 100 or 200 μM Cd in solutions. Miscanthus sinensis showed more sensitivity to Cd, including sharp decreases in growth, Pn, PEPC activity and damage to chloroplast structure, and the highest H2O2 and Cd concentrations in leaves and roots after Cd treatments. Miscanthus sacchariflorus showed higher resistance to Cd and better growth, had the highest Pn and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) activities and integrative chloroplast structure and the lowest hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and leaf and root Cd concentrations. The results could play an important role in understanding the mechanisms of Cd tolerance in plants and in application of phytoremediation."
https://openalex.org/W2336631222,"Peripheral nerve injury induces proliferation of microglia in the spinal cord, which can contribute to neuropathic pain conditions. However, candidate molecules for proliferation of spinal microglia after injury in rats remain unclear. We focused on the colony-stimulating factors (CSFs) and interleukin-34 (IL-34) that are involved in the proliferation of the mononuclear phagocyte lineage. We examined the expression of mRNAs for macrophage-CSF (M-CSF), granulocyte macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF), granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF) and IL-34 in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and spinal cord after spared nerve injury (SNI) in rats. RT-PCR and in situ hybridization revealed that M-CSF and IL-34, but not GM- or G-CSF, mRNAs were constitutively expressed in the DRG, and M-CSF robustly increased in injured-DRG neurons. M-CSF receptor mRNA was expressed in naive rats and increased in spinal microglia following SNI. Intrathecal injection of M-CSF receptor inhibitor partially but significantly reversed the proliferation of spinal microglia and in early phase of neuropathic pain induced by SNI. Furthermore, intrathecal injection of recombinant M-CSF induced microglial proliferation and mechanical allodynia. Here, we demonstrate that M-CSF is a candidate molecule derived from primary afferents that induces proliferation of microglia in the spinal cord and leads to induction of neuropathic pain after peripheral nerve injury in rats."
https://openalex.org/W2336352211,"Metabolic profiles of amniotic fluid and maternal blood are sources of valuable information about fetus development and can be potentially useful in diagnosis of pregnancy disorders. In this study, we applied 1H NMR-based metabolic profiling to track metabolic changes occurring in amniotic fluid (AF) and plasma (PL) of healthy mothers over the course of pregnancy. AF and PL samples were collected in the 2nd (T2) and 3rd (T3) trimester, prolonged pregnancy (PP) until time of delivery (TD). A multivariate data analysis of both biofluids reviled a metabolic switch-like transition between 2nd and 3rd trimester, which was followed by metabolic stabilization throughout the rest of pregnancy probably reflecting the stabilization of fetal maturation and development. The differences were further tested using univariate statistics at α = 0.001. In plasma the progression from T2 to T3 was related to increasing levels of glycerol, choline and ketone bodies (3-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate) while pyruvate concentration was significantly decreased. In amniotic fluid, T2 to T3 transition was associated with decreasing levels of glucose, carnitine, amino acids (valine, leucine, isoleucine, alanine, methionine, tyrosine, and phenylalanine) and increasing levels of creatinine, succinate, pyruvate, choline, N,N-dimethylglycine and urocanate. Lactate to pyruvate ratio was decreased in AF and conversely increased in PL. The results of our study, show that metabolomics profiling can be used to better understand physiological changes of the complex interdependencies of the mother, the placenta and the fetus during pregnancy. In the future, these results might be a useful reference point for analysis of complicated pregnancies."
https://openalex.org/W2337025637,"Recent metagenomic studies have demonstrated that the overall functional potential of the intestinal microbiome is rather conserved between healthy individuals. Here we assessed the biological processes undertaken in-vivo by microbes and the host in the intestinal tract by conducting a metaproteome analysis from a total of 48 faecal samples of 16 healthy adults participating in a placebo-controlled probiotic intervention trial. Half of the subjects received placebo and the other half consumed Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG for three weeks (1010 cfu per day). Faecal samples were collected just before and at the end of the consumption phase as well as after a three-week follow-up period, and were processed for microbial composition and metaproteome analysis. A common core of shared microbial protein functions could be identified in all subjects. Furthermore, we observed marked differences in expressed proteins between subjects that resulted in the definition of a stable and personalized microbiome both at the mass-spectrometry-based proteome level and the functional level based on the KEGG pathway analysis. No significant changes in the metaproteome were attributable to the probiotic intervention. A detailed taxonomic assignment of peptides and comparison to phylogenetic microarray data made it possible to evaluate the activity of the main phyla as well as key species, including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Several correlations were identified between human and bacterial proteins. Proteins of the human host accounted for approximately 14% of the identified metaproteome and displayed variations both between and within individuals. The individually different human intestinal proteomes point to personalized host-microbiota interactions. Our findings indicate that analysis of the intestinal metaproteome can complement gene-based analysis and contributes to a thorough understanding of the activities of the microbiome and the relevant pathways in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2336176844,"The molecular pathogenesis of avian influenza infection varies greatly with individual bird species and virus strain. The molecular pathogenesis of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) or the low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) infection in avian species remains poorly understood. Thus, global immune response of chickens infected with HPAI H5N1 (A/duck/India/02CA10/2011) and LPAI H9N2 (A/duck/India/249800/2010) viruses was studied using microarray to identify crucial host genetic components responsive to these infection. HPAI H5N1 virus induced excessive expression of type I IFNs (IFNA and IFNG), cytokines (IL1B, IL18, IL22, IL13, and IL12B), chemokines (CCL4, CCL19, CCL10, and CX3CL1) and IFN stimulated genes (OASL, MX1, RSAD2, IFITM5, IFIT5, GBP 1, and EIF2AK) in lung tissues. This dysregulation of host innate immune genes may be the critical determinant of the severity and the outcome of the influenza infection in chickens. In contrast, the expression levels of most of these genes was not induced in the lungs of LPAI H9N2 virus infected chickens. This study indicated the relationship between host immune genes and their roles in pathogenesis of HPAIV infection in chickens."
https://openalex.org/W2338668830,"Ethanol induces brain damage and neurodegeneration by triggering inflammatory processes in glial cells through activation of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling. Recent evidence indicates the role of protein degradation pathways in neurodegeneration and alcoholic liver disease, but how these processes affect the brain remains elusive. We have demonstrated that chronic ethanol consumption impairs proteolytic pathways in mouse brain, and the immune response mediated by TLR4 receptors participates in these dysfunctions. We evaluate the in vitro effects of an acute ethanol dose on the autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP) on WT and TLR4-/- mouse astrocytes and neurons in primary culture, and how these changes affect cell survival. Our results show that ethanol induces overexpression of several autophagy markers (ATG12, LC3-II, CTSB), and increases the number of lysosomes in WT astrocytes, effects accompanied by a basification of lysosomal pH and by lowered phosphorylation levels of autophagy inhibitor mTOR, along with activation of complexes beclin-1 and ULK1. Notably, we found only minor changes between control and ethanol-treated TLR4-/- mouse astroglial cells. Ethanol also triggers the expression of the inflammatory mediators iNOS and COX-2, but induces astroglial death only slightly. Blocking autophagy by using specific inhibitors increases both inflammation and cell death. Conversely, in neurons, ethanol down-regulates the autophagy pathway and triggers cell death, which is partially recovered by using autophagy enhancers. These results support the protective role of the ALP against ethanol-induced astroglial cell damage in a TLR4-dependent manner, and provide new insight into the mechanisms that underlie ethanol-induced brain damage and are neuronal sensitive to the ethanol effects."
https://openalex.org/W2339873482,"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common inherited hemoglobinopathy worldwide. Our previous results indicate that the reduced oxidative stress capacity of sickle erythrocytes may be caused by decreased expression of NRF2 (Nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2), an oxidative stress regulator. We found that activation of NRF2 with sulforaphane (SFN) in erythroid progenitors significantly increased the expression of NRF2 targets HMOX1, NQO1, and HBG1 (subunit of fetal hemoglobin) in a dose-dependent manner. Therefore, we hypothesized that NRF2 activation with SFN may offer therapeutic benefits for SCD patients by restoring oxidative capacity and increasing fetal hemoglobin concentration. To test this hypothesis, we performed a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation study of SFN, contained in a broccoli sprout homogenate (BSH) that naturally contains SFN, in adults with SCD. The primary and secondary study endpoints were safety and physiological response to NRF2 activation, respectively. We found that BSH was well tolerated, and the few adverse events that occurred during the trial were not likely related to BSH consumption. We observed an increase in the mean relative whole blood mRNA levels for the NRF2 target HMOX1 (p = 0.02) on the last day of BSH treatment, compared to pre-treatment. We also observed a trend toward increased mean relative mRNA levels of the NRF2 target HBG1 (p = 0.10) from baseline to end of treatment, but without significant changes in HbF protein. We conclude that BSH, in the provided doses, is safe in stable SCD patients and may induce changes in gene expression levels. We therefore propose investigation of more potent NRF2 inducers, which may elicit more robust physiological changes and offer clinical benefits to SCD patients.

https://openalex.org/W2339871018,"Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) affects 2.1–24% of women. Frequently, no underlying pathology is identified, and the pain is difficult to manage. Gabapentin is prescribed for CPP despite no robust evidence of efficacy. We performed a pilot trial in two UK centres to inform the planning of a future multicentre RCT to evaluate gabapentin in CPP management. Our primary objective was to determine levels of participant recruitment and retention. Secondary objectives included estimating potential effectiveness, acceptability to participants of trial methodology, and cost-effectiveness of gabapentin. Women with CPP and no obvious pelvic pathology were assigned to an increasing regimen of gabapentin (300-2700mg daily) or placebo. We calculated the proportion of eligible women randomised, and of randomised participants who were followed up to six months. The analyses by treatment group were by intention-to-treat. Interviews were conducted to evaluate women’s experiences of the trial. A probabilistic decision analytical model was used to estimate cost-effectiveness. Between September 2012–2013, 47 women (34% of those eligible) were randomised (22 to gabapentin, 25 to placebo), and 25 (53%) completed six-month follow-up. Participants on gabapentin had less pain (BPI difference 1.72 points, 95% CI:0.07–3.36), and an improvement in mood (HADS difference 4.35 points, 95% CI:1.97–6.73) at six months than those allocated placebo. The majority of participants described their trial experience favorably. At the UK threshold for willingness-to-pay, the probabilities of gabapentin or no treatment being cost-effective are similar. A pilot trial assessing gabapentin for CPP was feasible, but uncertainty remains, highlighting the need for a large definitive trial. Trial registration Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN45178534"
https://openalex.org/W2340181169,"Fat waste discarded from butcheries was used as a cosubstrate in the anaerobic codigestion of sewage sludge (SS). The process was evaluated under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions. The codigestion was successfully attained despite some inhibitory stages initially present that had their origin in the accumulation of volatile fatty acids (VFA) and adsorption of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA). The addition of a fat waste improved digestion stability and increased biogas yields thanks to the higher organic loading rate (OLR) applied to the reactors. However, thermophilic digestion was characterized by an effluent of poor quality and high VFA content. Results from spectroscopic analysis suggested the adsorption of lipid components onto the anaerobic biomass, thus disturbing the complete degradation of substrate during the treatment. The formation of fatty aggregates in the thermophilic reactor prevented process failure by avoiding the exposure of biomass to the toxic effect of high LCFA concentrations."
https://openalex.org/W2339371539,"Cohesin, a multi-subunit protein complex involved in chromosome organization, is frequently mutated or aberrantly expressed in cancer. Multiple functions of cohesin, including cell division and gene expression, highlight its potential as a novel therapeutic target. The SMC3 subunit of cohesin is acetylated (ac) during S phase to establish cohesion between replicated chromosomes. Following anaphase, ac-SMC3 is deacetylated by HDAC8. Reversal of SMC3 acetylation is imperative for recycling cohesin so that it can be reloaded in interphase for both non-mitotic and mitotic functions. We blocked deacetylation of ac-SMC3 using an HDAC8-specific inhibitor PCI-34051 in MCF7 breast cancer cells, and examined the effects on transcription of cohesin-dependent genes that respond to estrogen. HDAC8 inhibition led to accumulation of ac-SMC3 as expected, but surprisingly, had no influence on the transcription of estrogen-responsive genes that are altered by siRNA targeting of RAD21 or SMC3. Knockdown of RAD21 altered estrogen receptor α (ER) recruitment at SOX4 and IL20, and affected transcription of these genes, while HDAC8 inhibition did not. Rather, inhibition of HDAC8 delayed cell cycle progression, suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. We conclude that HDAC8 inhibition does not change the estrogen-specific transcriptional role of cohesin in MCF7 cells, but instead, compromises cell cycle progression and cell survival. Our results argue that candidate inhibitors of cohesin function may differ in their effects depending on the cellular genotype and should be thoroughly tested for predicted effects on cohesin’s mechanistic roles.

In addition to ac-SMC3, acetylated p53 is a target of HDAC8. In inv(16)+ AML, chemical inhibition of HDAC8 prevented p53 deacetylation, leading to restoration of p53-induced apoptosis of leukemia-initiating cells (28Qi J. Singh S. Hua W.-K. Cai Q. Chao S.-W.

PCI-34051 was found to be a highly selective and potent inhibitor of HDAC8 in 2008, where it was shown to induce apoptosis in T cell-derived but not solid tumor cell lines (29Balasubramanian S.

Based on these findings, PCI-34051 has the potential to be a cohesin inhibitor. Previously, we showed that cohesin is essential for normal transcription of a subset of estrogen-responsive genes in MCF7 breast cancer cells, via DNA looping and the recruitment of estrogen receptor α (ER) (15McEwan M.V. Eccles M.R. Horsfield J.A. Cohesin is required for activation of MYC by estradiol.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7e49160Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 18Antony J. Dasgupta T. Rhodes J.M. McEwan M.V. Print C.G. O'Sullivan J M. Horsfield J.A. Cohesin modulates transcription of estrogen-responsive genes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 24 (00311–00313)Google Scholar). Here, we sought to determine if HDAC8 inhibition leading to accumulated ac-SMC3 blocks the estrogen-specific transcriptional role of cohesin in MCF7 breast cancer cells. We found that HDAC8 inhibition impedes cell growth, but is not functionally equivalent to RAD21 or SMC3 siRNA-based abrogation of cohesin. Our results suggest that the effectiveness of targeting cohesin’s transcription regulatory function via inhibition of HDAC8 might depend on cell type. MCF7 cells (ATCC HTB-22) of low passage number (p9-p15) were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Life Technologies or Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in a humidified cell culture incubator at 37 °;C and 5% CO2. Hormone deprivation, 17-β-estradiol stimulation and RAD21 depletion using siRNA in MCF7 cells were carried as previously described (15McEwan M.V. Eccles M.R. Horsfield J.A.

Horsfield J.A. Cohesin modulates transcription of estrogen-responsive genes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 24 (00311–00313)Google Scholar). To deplete SMC3 in MCF7 cells, we used the ON-TARGET plus siRNA smart pool LU-006834-00-0005 (GE Dharmacon). The non-targeting control siRNA smart pool D-001810-10-05 (GE Dharmacon) was used as a negative control. SMC3 and control siRNAs were used at final concentrations of 20 nm. Cells were reverse-transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Life Technologies) following 24 h of hormone depletion. After transfection, cells were cultured in hormone-depleted conditions for a further 48 h prior to estradiol stimulation. Estrogen deprivation for PCI-34051 experiments was carried out as for the siRNA transfections, except that the siRNA was replaced by 48 h PCI-34051 treatment (Cayman Chemical) and for controls we used dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent. Total RNA was isolated, reverse-transcribed into cDNA, and analyzed by quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) as described previously (15McEwan M.V. Eccles M.R. Horsfield J.A.

For G1-S phase cell synchronization experiments, MCF7 cells (3 × 105 cells per well of a 6-well plate) were cultured in full growth medium and allowed to grow to 25–30% confluence. Double thymidine block was carried out as follows: 18 h incubation with 2 mm thymidine, 9 h release and then 17 h of incubation with 2 mm thymidine. Following the second block, cells were released and treated with PCI-34051 as indicated. Floating and adherent cells were harvested by adding phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 0.1% EDTA solution, and centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °;C. Cell pellets were washed in PBS, 1% FBS solution, resuspended in ice-cold PBS, and fixed in 96% ethanol overnight at 4 °;C. Fixed cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 2000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °;C and washed in PBS, 1% FBS solution. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in propidium iodide (10 μg/ml) with RNase A (250 μg/ml), and incubated at 37 °;C for 30 min. Samples were analyzed on a Beckman Coulter Gallios Flow Cytometer (Beckman Coulter), and cell cycle profiles were generated using the acquisition interface software. Data were analyzed using the FlowJo software (version 9.7, Tree Star). Primary antibodies used are as follows: anti-RAD21 (Ab992, Abcam), ER (HC-20, sc-543, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), total-SMC3 (D47B5, Cell Signaling Technology), ac-SMC3 (Custom antibody kindly donated by Dr. Katsuhiko Shirahige, University of Tokyo, Japan), γ-tubulin (T5326, Sigma), and α-tubulin (T6199, Sigma). ChIP for RAD21 and ER was performed as described previously (15McEwan M.V. Eccles M.R. Horsfield J.A.

Primer sequences were: SOX4 primer 1 forward: 5′-CGCTAGGAAATGACCCGAGA-3′; SOX4 primer 1 reverse: 5′-TTCAGTTTGACCGTGAACCC-3′; SOX4 primer 2 forward: 5′-ATTCCAATTTATTTCCTCCCTGT-3′; SOX4 primer 2 reverse: 5′-GCTTAAGCTCGCCAAGGATT-3′; SOX4 primer 3 forward: 5′-GGCTTGTAACGCTGGCTTAG-3′; SOX4 primer 3 reverse: 5′-CCCGTTGTTGCAATTACAGTT-3′ and IL20 primer 1 forward: 5′-CACCCAGGAGTGCCTGACTA-3′; IL20 primer 1 reverse: 5′-GCAAGACGTGATGGGCAAT-3′. Proteins were quantified using the PierceTMBCA protein assay kit, and equal amounts of protein (20–60 μg) were loaded onto SDS-PAGE gels. Immunoblotting analyses were carried out as described previously using the LI-COR Odyssey® infrared detection system and quantified using LI-COR Image Studio software (18Antony J. Dasgupta T. Rhodes J.M. McEwan M.V. Print C.G. O'Sullivan J M. Horsfield J.A. Cohesin modulates transcription of estrogen-responsive genes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 24 (00311–00313)Google Scholar). Primary antibodies used were: total-SMC3 (1:1000), ac-SMC3 (1:500), ER (1:1000), and γ-tubulin (1:5000). MCF7 cells were grown on sterile coverslips (6.25 × 104 cells per well of a 24-well plate). Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Fisher Chemical) solution for 10 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.3% (for α-tubulin) or 0.5% (for total and ac-SMC3) Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 10 min at room temperature. Cells were blocked in PBS containing 10% FBS for 1–1.5 h. Primary antibodies were diluted in blocking buffer, and incubation was carried out at room temperature for 1.5 h (α-tubulin, 1:500) or overnight at 4 °;C (total SMC3, 1:200 and ac-SMC3 1:100). Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with the secondary antibodies and 1 μg/ml of Hoechst 33342 at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were then washed and mounted onto microscope slides using ProLong Gold Anti-fade (Life Technology) mounting medium. Immunostained cells were visualized on a Nikon C2 confocal microscope; z-series images were taken using the NIS elements software, digitally zoomed, z-stacked, and processed using FIJI software. Secondary antibodies used were: anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (1:2000, Life Tecnologies), anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 (1:2000, Life Technologies). Cells were seeded in quadruplet into 96-well plates at a density of 9900 cells for days 1 and 3, 6250 cells for day 5 and 4000 cells for day 7 incubation times. The next day, cells were treated with varying concentrations of PCI-34051. On the day of the assay, 0.25 mg/ml of MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium) was added to each well, and plates were incubated at 37 °;C for 3–4 h. Culture medium was then removed, and reaction was stopped with 100 μl of DMSO. Absorbance was read at 570 nm on a microtiter plate reader (BioRad). Cells were seeded and dosed as above. After PCI-34051 addition, plates were immediately placed in the IncuCyte FLR chamber. Using the IncuCyte FLR’s 10× objective, images were acquired every 3 h. At the end of each treatment period, kinetic growth curves were generated, and cell proliferation was quantified using IncuCyte’s confluence-based automated analysis software. YOYO-1 dye assay (Life Technologies) was used to measure cell viability following PCI-34051 treatment. Cells were seeded as described above and the next day, YOYO-1 (1:10,000 dilution) was added to the culture medium, simultaneously with PCI-34051, and fluorescence was monitored in real time on the IncuCyte FLR and quantified using the IncuCyte software. GraphPad Prism (version 6, GraphPad software Inc.) was used to graph and analyze the data. Previously, 25 μm of PCI-34051 was shown to inhibit HDAC8 and block SMC3 deacetylation in HeLa cells (25Deardorff M.A. Bando M. Nakato R. Watrin E. Itoh T. Minamino M. Saitoh K. Komata M. Katou Y. Clark D. Cole K.E. De Baere E. Decroos C. Di Donato N. Ernst S. et al.HDAC8 mutations in Cornelia de Lange syndrome affect the cohesin acetylation cycle.Nature. 2012; 489: 313-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). To determine whether a similar effect occurs in MCF7 breast cancer cells, we used immunofluorescence with specific antibodies to examine the status of total SMC3 and ac-SMC3 post-PCI-34051 treatment. MCF7 cells were synchronized in the G1-S phase and treated with 10, 25, and 50 μm of PCI-34051 or vehicle control for 6 or 12 h (Fig. 1, A and B). At both time points and at all concentrations, PCI-34051 caused an accumulation of acetylated SMC3 compared with vehicle controls, whereas total SMC3 remained unchanged. Immunoblot analysis on protein lysates from asynchronized MCF7 cells treated with PCI-34051 for 48 (Fig. 1, C and D) or 72 (data not shown) hours showed a dose-dependent increase in acetylated SMC3 relative to total SMC3. Levels of acetylated SMC3 increased by ∼1.5-fold with 10 μm PCI-34015, ∼2-fold with 25 μm, and ∼2.5-fold with 50 μm. The increase in acetylated SMC3 indicates that, consistent with previous observations in HeLa cells, PCI-34051 blocks HDAC8-mediated deacetylation of SMC3. We previously had identified ER target genes that were regulated by cohesin in breast cancer cells (15McEwan M.V. Eccles M.R. Horsfield J.A. Cohesin is required for activation of MYC by estradiol.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7e49160Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 18Antony J. Dasgupta T. Rhodes J.M. McEwan M.V. Print C.G. O'Sullivan J M. Horsfield J.A. Cohesin modulates transcription of estrogen-responsive genes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2014; 24 (00311–00313)Google Scholar). To determine whether HDAC8 inhibition alters cohesin’s gene regulatory function, we compared the expression of 10 ER-regulated genes following knockdown of the cohesin subunits RAD21 or SMC3 with PCI-34051 treatment, following 6 h of estradiol stimulation in MCF7 cells. Immunostaining of estradiol-starved MCF7 cells treated with 10 and 25 μm PCI-34051 confirmed robust accumulation of ac-SMC3, while no changes were visible for total SMC3 (Fig. 2). We previously described ∼70% depletion of RAD21 protein levels by siRNA (15McEwan M.V. Eccles M.R. Horsfield J.A. Cohesin is required for activation of MYC by estradiol.PLoS ONE. 2012; 7e49160Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 18Antony J. Dasgupta T. Rhodes J.M. McEwan M.V. Print C.G. O'Sullivan J M.

Depletion of SMC3 was confirmed by qRT-PCR (data not shown) and immunoblotting with anti-SMC3 antibody showed a decrease in protein levels by 73–78% (Fig. 3A).FIGURE 3Effects of cohesin depletion or HDAC8 inhibition on ER protein levels in MCF7 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2339389883,"Herbicide-resistant Palmer amaranth is a widespread issue in row-crop production in the Midsouthern US. Palmer amaranth is commonly found on roadside habitats in this region, but little is known on the degree of herbicide resistance in these populations. Herbicide resistance in roadside Palmer amaranth populations can represent the spread of an adaptive trait across a selective landscape. A large-scale survey was carried out in the Mississippi Delta region of eastern Arkansas to document the level of resistance in roadside Palmer amaranth populations to pyrithiobac and glyphosate, two important herbicides with broad history of use in the region. A total of 215 Palmer amaranth populations collected across 500 random survey sites were used in the evaluations. About 89 and 73% of the surveyed populations showed >90% survival to pyrithiobac and glyphosate, respectively. Further, only 3% of the populations were completely susceptible to glyphosate, while none of the populations was completely controlled by pyrithiobac. Among the 215 populations evaluated, 209 populations showed multiple resistance to both pyrithiobac and glyphosate at varying degrees. Dose-response assays confirmed the presence of high levels of herbicide resistance in the five selected populations (≥ 25-fold compared to a susceptible standard). Results demonstrate the prevalence of multiple-herbicide resistance in roadside Palmer amaranth populations in this region. Growers should be vigilant of Palmer amaranth infestation in roadsides adjacent to their fields and implement appropriate control measures to prevent likely spread of herbicide resistance into their fields."

Moreover we proposed to measure by photoacoustic imaging the intratumoral hypoxia, which is a crucial parameter responsible for resistance to therapies. Finally, we compared ultrasound data to x-ray micro computed tomography and volumetric measurements to validate the relevance of this approach on the NCI-H460 human orthotopic lung tumor.This study demonstrates the ability of ultrasound imaging to detect and monitor the in vivo orthotopic lung tumor growth by high resolution ultrasound imaging. This approach enabled us to characterize key biological parameters such as oxygenation, perfusion status and vascularization of tumors.Such an experimental approach has never been reported previously and it would provide a nonradiative tool for assessment of anticancer therapeutic efficacy in mice. Considering the absence of ultrasound propagation through the lung parenchyma, this strategy requires the implantation of tumors strictly located in the superficial posterior part of the lung."
https://openalex.org/W2338828861,"Despite the large number of studies that have examined the acute effects of different warm up modalities (WU) on physical performance, none of them have documented the time course of potential performance recovery in tennis players. The aim of this study was twofold: (a) to analyze and compare the acute effects of two different WU modalities (traditional WU [TWU] and dynamic WU [DWU]) on physical performance (i.e., CMJ, sprint, serve speed and accuracy) in elite junior players, as well as (b) to monitor the time course of any WU-induced changes after 30 and 60 min of simulated match-play. Twelve junior elite players completed both WUs modalities (TWU and DWU) in a counterbalanced order on separate days. In each experimental session, counter movement jump (CMJ), 20-m sprint, tennis serve speed and accuracy tests were performed before (immediately after TWU or DWU) during (30 min) and after 60 min of a simulated match play. Measures were compared via four factorial (WU intervention and time) repeated measures ANOVAs. There were main effects of WU (TWU and DWU) throughout the time for all the variables analysed. The results indicate that DWU routine led to significantly faster 20 m sprint times and higher CMJs as well as faster and more accurate tennis serves at both post warm-up and 30 min match-play testing moments in comparison with the scores reported by the TWU routine (p < 0.05; positive effects with a probability of >75-99%). No significant intergroup differences were found at 60-min match-play testing moment in any variable (except for the 20 m sprint). Therefore, the findings of this study recommend for optimal performance in these elite tennis players, DWU routines should be performed prior to formal training and competition rather than TWU routines."

We aimed to develop and validate a score to predict type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in a rural adult Chinese population. Data for a cohort of 12,849 participants were randomly divided into derivation (n = 11,564) and validation (n = 1285) datasets. A questionnaire interview and physical and blood biochemical examinations were performed at baseline (July to August 2007 and July to August 2008) and follow-up (July to August 2013 and July to October 2014). A Cox regression model was used to weigh each variable in the derivation dataset. For each significant variable, a score was calculated by multiplying β by 100 and rounding to the nearest integer. Age, body mass index, triglycerides and fasting plasma glucose (scores 3, 12, 24 and 76, respectively) were predictors of incident T2DM. The model accuracy was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), with optimal cut-off value 936. With the derivation dataset, sensitivity, specificity and AUC of the model were 66.7%, 74.0% and 0.768 (95% CI 0.760-0.776), respectively. With the validation dataset, the performance of the model was superior to the Chinese (simple), FINDRISC, Oman and IDRS models of T2DM risk but equivalent to the Framingham model, which is widely applicable in a variety of populations. Our model for predicting 6-year risk of T2DM could be used in a rural adult Chinese population."

https://openalex.org/W2339770566,"In this study, we investigate the translational potential of a novel combined construct using an FDA-approved decellularized porcine small intestinal submucosa extracellular matrix (SIS-ECM) seeded with human or porcine mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for cardiovascular indications. With the emerging success of individual component in various clinical applications, the combination of SIS-ECM with MSCs could provide additional therapeutic potential compared to individual components alone for cardiovascular repair. We tested the in vitro effects of MSC-seeding on SIS-ECM on resultant construct structure/function properties and MSC phenotypes. Additionally, we evaluated the ability of porcine MSCs to modulate recipient graft-specific response towards SIS-ECM in a porcine cardiac patch in vivo model. Specifically, we determined: 1) in vitro loading-capacity of human MSCs on SIS-ECM, 2) effect of cell seeding on SIS-ECM structure, compositions and mechanical properties, 3) effect of SIS-ECM seeding on human MSC phenotypes and differentiation potential, and 4) optimal orientation and dose of porcine MSCs seeded SIS-ECM for an in vivo cardiac application. In this study, histological structure, biochemical compositions and mechanical properties of the FDA-approved SIS-ECM biomaterial were retained following MSCs repopulation in vitro. Similarly, the cellular phenotypes and differentiation potential of MSCs were preserved following seeding on SIS-ECM. In a porcine in vivo patch study, the presence of porcine MSCs on SIS-ECM significantly reduced adaptive T cell response regardless of cell dose and orientation compared to SIS-ECM alone. These findings substantiate the clinical translational potential of combined SIS-ECM seeded with MSCs as a promising therapeutic candidate for cardiac applications."
https://openalex.org/W2336397920,"While susceptibility to hypersensitive reactions is a common problem amongst humans and animals alike, the population structure of certain animal species and breeds provides a more advantageous route to better understanding the biology underpinning these conditions. The current study uses Exmoor ponies, a highly inbred breed of horse known to frequently suffer from insect bite hypersensitivity, to identify genomic regions associated with a type I and type IV hypersensitive reaction. A total of 110 cases and 170 controls were genotyped on the 670K Axiom Equine Genotyping Array. Quality control resulted in 452,457 SNPs and 268 individuals being tested for association. Genome-wide association analyses were performed using the GenABEL package in R and resulted in the identification of two regions of interest on Chromosome 8. The first region contained the most significant SNP identified, which was located in an intron of the DCC netrin 1 receptor gene. The second region identified contained multiple top SNPs and encompassed the PIGN, KIAA1468, TNFRSF11A, ZCCHC2, and PHLPP1 genes. Although additional studies will be needed to validate the importance of these regions in horses and the relevance of these regions in other species, the knowledge gained from the current study has the potential to be a step forward in unraveling the complex nature of hypersensitive reactions."

We examined the early behavioral and anatomical changes as well as molecular changes in mice prenatally exposed to VPA (VPA mice). In this study, we first showed that VPA mice showed developmental delays as assessed with self-righting, eye opening tests and impaired social recognition. In addition, we provide the first evidence that primary cultured neurons from VPA-treated embryos present an increase in dendritic spines, compared with those from control mice. Mutations in phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) gene are also known to be associated with autism, and mice with PTEN knockout show autistic characteristics. Protein expression of PTEN was decreased and the ratio of p-AKT/AKT was increased in the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus, and a distinctive anatomical change in the CA1 region of the hippocampus was observed. Taken together, our study suggests that prenatal exposure to VPA induces developmental delays and neuroanatomical changes via the reduction of PTEN level and these changes were detectable in the early days of life."
https://openalex.org/W2338179302,"Flavobacterium psychrophilum is a fish pathogen in salmonid aquaculture worldwide that causes cold water disease (CWD) and rainbow trout fry syndrome (RTFS). Comparative genome analyses of 11 F. psychrophilum isolates representing temporally and geographically distant populations were used to describe the F. psychrophilum pan-genome and to examine virulence factors, prophages, CRISPR arrays, and genomic islands present in the genomes. Analysis of the genomic DNA sequences were complemented with selected phenotypic characteristics of the strains. The pan genome analysis showed that F. psychrophilum could hold at least 3373 genes, while the core genome contained 1743 genes. On average, 67 new genes were detected for every new genome added to the analysis, indicating that F. psychrophilum possesses an open pan genome. The putative virulence factors were equally distributed among isolates, independent of geographic location, year of isolation and source of isolates. Only one prophage-related sequence was found which corresponded to the previously described prophage 6H, and appeared in 5 out of 11 isolates. CRISPR array analysis revealed two different loci with dissimilar spacer content, which only matched one sequence in the database, the temperate bacteriophage 6H. Genomic Islands (GIs) were identified in F. psychrophilum isolates 950106-1/1 and CSF 259–93, associated with toxins and antibiotic resistance. Finally, phenotypic characterization revealed a high degree of similarity among the strains with respect to biofilm formation and secretion of extracellular enzymes. Global scale dispersion of virulence factors in the genomes and the abilities for biofilm formation, hemolytic activity and secretion of extracellular enzymes among the strains suggested that F. psychrophilum isolates have a similar mode of action on adhesion, colonization and destruction of fish tissues across large spatial and temporal scales of occurrence. Overall, the genomic characterization and phenotypic properties may provide new insights to the mechanisms of pathogenicity in F. psychrophilum."
https://openalex.org/W2338698079,"In intensive agricultural systems runoff is one of the major potential diffuse pollution pathways for pesticides and poses a risk to surface water. Ditches are common in the Po Valley and can potentially provide runoff mitigation for the protection of watercourses. The effectiveness depends on ditch characteristics, so there is an urgent need for site-specific field trials. The use of a fugacity model (multimedia model) can allows recognition of the mitigation main processes. A field experiment was conducted in order to evaluate the mitigation capacity of a typical vegetated ditch, and results were compared with predictions by a fugacity model. To evaluate herbicide mitigation after an extreme runoff, the ditch was flooded with water containing mesotrione, S-metolachlor and terbuthylazine. Two other subsequent floods with uncontaminated water were applied 27 and 82 days later to evaluate herbicides release. Results show that the ditch can immediately reduce runoff concentration of herbicides by at least 50% even in extreme flooding conditions. The half-distances were about 250 m. As a general rule, a runoff of 1 mm from 5 ha is mitigated by 99% in 100 m of vegetated ditch. Herbicides retention in the vegetated ditch was reversible, and the second flood mobilized 0.03-0.2% of the previous one, with a concentration below the drinking water limit of 0.1 μg L-1. No herbicide was detected in the third flood, because the residual amount in the ditch was too low. Fugacity model results show that specific physical-chemical parameters may be used and a specific soil-sediment-plant compartment included for modelling herbicides behaviour in a vegetated ditch, and confirm that accumulation is low or negligible for herbicides with a half-life of 40 days or less. Shallow vegetated ditches can thus be included in a general agri-environment scheme for the mitigation of pesticides runoff together with wetlands and linear buffer strips. These structures are present in the landscape, and their environmental role can be exploited by proper management."
https://openalex.org/W2340216922,"Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is a significant factor in the pathogenesis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, especially in the undifferentiated carcinoma of nasopharyngeal type (UCNT, World Health Organization type III), which is the dominant histopathological type in high-risk areas. The major EBV oncogene is latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1). LMP1 gene shows variability with different tumorigenic and immunogenic potentials. EBV nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1) regulates progression of EBV-related tumors; however, the influence of EBNA1 sequence variability on tumor pathogenesis is controversial. The aims of this study were to characterize polymorphisms of EBV genes in non-endemic nasopharyngeal carcinoma biopsies and to investigate potential sequence patterns that correlate with the clinical presentation of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In total, 116 tumor biopsies of undifferentiated carcinoma of nasopharyngeal type (UCNT), collected from 2008 to 2014, were evaluated in this study. The genes EBNA2, LMP1, and EBNA1 were amplified using nested-PCR. EBNA2 genotyping was performed by visualization of PCR products using gel electrophoresis. Investigation of LMP1 and EBNA1 included sequence, phylogenetic, and statistical analyses. The presence of EBV DNA was significantly distributed between TNM stages. LMP1 variability showed six variants, with the detection of the first China1 and North Carolina variants in European nasopharyngeal carcinoma biopsies. Newly discovered variants Srb1 and Srb2 were UCNT-specific LMP1 polymorphisms. The B95-8 and North Carolina variants are possible predictors for favorable TNM stages. In contrast, deletions in LMP1 are possible risk factors for the most disfavorable TNM stage, independent of EBNA2 or EBNA1 variability. A newly discovered EBNA1 subvariant, P-thr-sv-5, could be a potential diagnostic marker, as it represented a UCNT-specific EBNA1 subvariant. A particular combination of EBNA2, LMP1, and EBNA1 polymorphisms, type 1/Med/P-thr was identified as a possible risk factor for TNM stage IVB or progression to the N3 stage."
https://openalex.org/W2339077455,"Background Data from the Chinese police service suggest substantial reductions in road traffic injuries since 2002, but critics have questioned the accuracy of those data, especially considering conflicting data reported by the health department. Methods To address the gap between police and health department data and to determine which may be more accurate, we conducted a simulation study based on the modified Smeed equation, which delineates a non-linear relation between road traffic mortality and the level of motorization in a country or region. Our goal was to simulate trends in road traffic mortality in China and compare performances in road traffic safety management between China and 13 other countries. Results Chinese police data indicate a peak in road traffic mortalities in 2002 and a significant and a gradual decrease in population-based road traffic mortality since 2002. Health department data show the road traffic mortality peaked in 2012. In addition, police data suggest China’s road traffic mortality peaked at a much lower motorization level (0.061 motor vehicles per person) in 2002, followed by a reduction in mortality to a level comparable to that of developed countries. Simulation results based on health department data suggest high road traffic mortality, with a mortality peak in 2012 at a moderate motorization level (0.174 motor vehicles per person). Comparisons to the other 13 countries suggest the health data from China may be more valid than the police data. Conclusion Our simulation data indicate China is still at a stage of high road traffic mortality, as suggested by health data, rather than a stage of low road traffic mortality, as suggested by police data. More efforts are needed to integrate safety into road design, improve road traffic management, improve data quality, and alter unsafe behaviors of pedestrians, drivers and passengers in China."
https://openalex.org/W2339052731,"Prostate smooth muscle tone and hyperplastic growth are involved in the pathophysiology and treatment of male lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Available drugs are characterized by limited efficacy. Patients’ adherence is particularly low to combination therapies of 5α-reductase inhibitors and α1-adrenoceptor antagonists, which are supposed to target contraction and growth simultaneously. Consequently, molecular etiology of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and new compounds interfering with smooth muscle contraction or growth in the prostate are of high interest. Here, we studied effects of p21-activated kinase (PAK) inhibitors (FRAX486, IPA3) in hyperplastic human prostate tissues, and in stromal cells (WPMY-1). In hyperplastic prostate tissues, PAK1, -2, -4, and -6 may be constitutively expressed in catecholaminergic neurons, while PAK1 was detected in smooth muscle and WPMY-1 cells. Neurogenic contractions of prostate strips by electric field stimulation were significantly inhibited by high concentrations of FRAX486 (30 μM) or IPA3 (300 μM), while noradrenaline- and phenylephrine-induced contractions were not affected. FRAX486 (30 μM) inhibited endothelin-1- and -2-induced contractions. In WPMY-1 cells, FRAX486 or IPA3 (24 h) induced concentration-dependent (1–10 μM) degeneration of actin filaments. This was paralleled by attenuation of proliferation rate, being observed from 1 to 10 μM FRAX486 or IPA3. Cytotoxicity of FRAX486 and IPA3 in WPMY-1 cells was time- and concentration-dependent. Stimulation of WPMY-1 cells with endothelin-1 or dihydrotestosterone, but not noradrenaline induced PAK phosphorylation, indicating PAK activation by endothelin-1. Thus, PAK inhibitors may inhibit neurogenic and endothelin-induced smooth muscle contractions in the hyperplastic human prostate, and growth of stromal cells. Targeting prostate smooth muscle contraction and stromal growth at once by a single compound is principally possible, at least under experimental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2340417920,"White Nose Syndrome (WNS) greatly increases the over-winter mortality of little brown (Myotis lucifugus), Indiana (Myotis sodalis), northern (Myotis septentrionalis), and tricolored (Perimyotis subflavus) bats. It is caused by a cutaneous infection with the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd). Big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) are much more resistant to cutaneous infection with Pd, however. We thus conducted analyses of wing epidermis from hibernating E. fuscus and M. lucifugus to determine their fatty acid compositions, and laboratory Pd culture experiments at 4.0-13.4°C to determine the effects of these fatty acids on Pd growth. Our analyses revealed that the epidermis of both bat species contain the same 7 fatty acid types (14:0, 15:0, 16:0. 16:1, 18:0, 18:1, & 18:2), but the epidermis of M. lucifugus contains: a) more stearic (18:0) acid, b) less palmitoleic (16:1) acid, c) less myristic (14:0) acid, and, d) less oleic (18:1) acid than that of E. fuscus. The growth of Pd was inhibited by: a) myristic and stearic acids at 10.5-13.4°C, but not at 4.0-5.0°C, b) oleic acid at 5.0-10.6°C, c) palmitoleic acid, and, d) linoleic (18:2) acid at 5.0-10.6°C. One set of factors that enables E. fuscus to better resist cutaneous P. destructans infections (and thus WNS) therefore appears to be the relatively higher myristic, palmitoleic, and oleic acid contents of the epidermis."
https://openalex.org/W2339899799,"Periampullary adenocarcinoma, including pancreatic cancer, is a heterogeneous group of tumours with dismal prognosis, for which there is an urgent need to identify novel treatment strategies. The human epithelial growth factor receptors EGFR, HER2 and HER3 have been studied in several tumour types, and HER-targeting drugs have a beneficial effect on survival in selected types of cancer. However, these effects have not been evident in pancreatic cancer, and remain unexplored in other types of periampullary cancer. The prognostic impact of HER-expression in these cancers also remains unclear. The aim of this study was therefore to examine the expression and prognostic value of EGFR, HER2 and HER3 in periampullary cancer, with particular reference to histological subtype. To this end, protein expression of EGFR, HER2 and HER3, and HER2 gene amplification was assessed by immunohistochemistry and silver in situ hybridization, respectively, on tissue microarrays with tumours from 175 periampullary adenocarcinomas, with follow-up data on recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) for up to 5 years. EGFR expression was similar in pancreatobiliary (PB) and intestinal (I) type tumours, but high HER2 and HER3 expression was significantly more common in I-type tumours. In PB-type cases receiving adjuvant gemcitabine, but not in untreated cases, high EGFR expression was significantly associated with a shorter OS and RFS, with a significant treatment interaction in relation to OS (pinteraction = 0.042). In I-type cases, high EGFR expression was associated with a shorter OS and RFS in univariable, but not in multivariable, analysis. High HER3 expression was associated with a prolonged RFS in univariable, but not in multivariable, analysis. Neither HER2 protein expression nor gene amplification was prognostic. The finding of a potential interaction between the expression of EGFR and response to adjuvant chemotherapy in PB-type tumours needs validation, and merits further study."

Particulate matter is a potent source of inflammation and oxidative stress. These processes are known to influence stroke progression through recruitment of marginally viable penumbral tissue into the ischemic core. nPM was collected in an urban area in central Los Angeles, impacted primarily by traffic emissions. Re-aerosolized nPM or filtered air was then administered to mice through whole body exposure chambers for forty-five cumulative hours. Exposed mice then underwent middle cerebral artery occlusion/ reperfusion. Following cerebral ischemia/ reperfusion, mice exposed to nPM exhibited significantly larger infarct volumes and less favorable neurological deficit scores when compared to mice exposed to filtered air. Mice exposed to nPM also demonstrated increases in markers of inflammation and oxidative stress in the region of the ischemic core. The findings suggest a detrimental effect of urban airborne particulate matter exposure in the setting of acute ischemic stroke."

Cox regression analysis was used to identify predictors for developing TB.The incidence rate of tuberculosis was 4.2 per 100 child-years. Incidence of tuberculosis was higher for subjects who were not on cotrimoxazole preventive therapy, were not on isoniazid preventive therapy, had delayed motor development, had a CD4 cell count below the threshold, had hemoglobin level less than 10 mg/dl and were assessed as World Health Organization (WHO) clinical stage III or IV.Incidence of TB in children living with HIV was high. This study reaffirmed that isoniazid preventive therapy is one of the best strategy to reduce incidence of TB in children living with HIV. All children living with HIV should be screened for TB but for children with delayed motor development, advanced WHO clinical stage, anemia or immune suppression, intensified screening is highly recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2336911173,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is frequently characterized by neuronal, axonal and myelin loss, reactive gliosis and neuroinflammation, often associated with functional deficits. Endogenous repair mechanisms include production of new neurons from precursor cells, but usually the new neurons fail to integrate and survive more than a few weeks. This is in part mediated by the toxic and inflammatory environment present in the injured brain which activates precursor cells to proliferate and differentiate but limits survival of the newborn progeny. Therefore, an understanding of mechanisms that regulate production and survival of newborn neurons and the neuroinflammatory response after brain injury may lead to therapeutic options to improve outcomes. Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 2 (SOCS2) promotes hippocampal neurogenesis and survival of newborn neurons in the adult brain and regulates anti-inflammatory responses in the periphery, suggesting it may be a useful candidate to improve outcomes of TBI. In this study the functional and cellular responses of SOCS2 over-expressing transgenic (SOCS2Tg) mice were compared to wildtype littermates following mild or moderately severe TBI. Unlike wildtype controls, SOCS2Tg mice showed functional improvement on a ladder test, with a smaller lesion volume at 7d post injury and increased numbers of proliferative CD11b+ microglia/macrophages at 35d post-injury in the mild injury paradigm. At 7d post-moderately severe injury there was an increase in the area covered by cells expressing an anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype marker (CD206+) but no difference in cells with a pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype marker (CD16/32+). No effect of SOCS2 overexpression was observed in production or survival of newborn neurons, even in the presence of the neuroprotective agent erythropoietin (EPO). Therefore, SOCS2 may improve outcome of TBI in mice by regulating aspects of the neuroinflammatory response, promoting a more anti-inflammatory environment, although this was not sufficient to enhance survival of newborn cortical neurons."

We further show that miR-127 promotes mesendoderm differentiation through the nodal pathway, a determinative signaling pathway in early embryogenesis. Using luciferase reporter assay, left-right determination factor 2 (Lefty2), an antagonist of nodal, is identified to be a novel target of miR-127. Furthermore, the role of miR-127 in mesendoderm differentiation is attenuated by Lefty2 overexpression.

https://openalex.org/W2340896512,"Purpose The purpose of this exploratory and descriptive study is to contribute to the sparse return-to-work literature on head and neck cancer (HNC) survivors. Interview participants were asked to reflect upon their work-related experience with cancer by answering two specific questions: (1) What advice would you give someone who has been newly diagnosed with head and neck cancer? (2) What advice would you give to employers of these people? Methods Data were gathered through 10 individual semi-structured in-depth interviews with HNC clinic patients at a regional cancer center’s head and neck clinic in Ontario, Canada. A constant comparative method of theme development was used. Codes identified in and derived from the data were discussed by research team members until consensus was reached. Codes with similar characteristics were grouped together and used to develop overarching themes. Results Work-related advice for peers focused on personal self-care and interactions within workplaces. Work-related advice to employers focused on demonstrating basic human values as well as the importance of communication. Discussion The study results suggest HNC clinic patients should be proactive with employers and help to set reasonable expectations and provide a realistic plan for work to be successfully completed. HNC clinic patients should develop communication skills to effectively disclose their cancer and treatment to employers. Conclusions In this exploratory study, HNC clinic patients’ advice was solution-focused underscoring the importance of self-care and pro-active communication and planning with employers. Employers were advised to demonstrate core human values throughout all phases of the work disability episode beginning at diagnosis."

We are investigating the mechanisms regulating the cell death that occurs on treatment of mouse cancer cell-line FM3A with antitumor 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FUdR): necrosis occurs for the original clone F28-7, and apoptosis for its variant F28-7-A. Here we report that a microRNA (miR-351) regulates the cell death pattern. The miR-351 is expressed strongly in F28-7-A but only weakly in F28-7. Induction of a higher expression of miR-351 in F28-7 by transfecting an miRNA mimic into F28-7 resulted in a change of the death mode; necrosis to apoptosis. Furthermore, transfection of an miR-351 inhibitor into F28-7-A resulted in the morphology change, apoptosis to necrosis, in this death-by-FUdR.

Multiple logistic regressions were used to identify correlates of ""ever tested for HIV"" among the sexually active participants.Of the 295 sexually active participants, 27.3% reported ""ever tested for HIV;"" 65.4% ""did not consistently use condom;"" and 61.7% ""had at least 2 lifetime partners."" We found that ""self-efficacy"" (AOR, 4.92; CI, 1.22-19.73); ""perception that it is easy to find a location nearby to test for HIV"" (AOR, 4.67; CI, 1.21-18.06); ""having at least 2 lifetime sexual partners"" (AOR, 2.05; CI, 1.09-3.85); and ""ever been pregnant or made someone pregnant"" (AOR, 4.06; CI, 2.69-9.15); were associated with increased odds of having ever been tested. On the other hand, ""fear of HIV test results"" (AOR, 0.21; CI, 0.08-0.57) was associated with lower odds of ever having been tested for HIV.The main finding is that a substantially high proportion of Thai youth is engaged in risky sexual behaviors--yet reports low rates of ever having been tested for HIV. This highlights an urgent need to develop appropriate interventions--based on the identified correlates of HIV testing. There is also an urgent need to enhance HIV testing and to promote safer sexual behaviors among young Thai people--particularly those who are out-of-school."

In the Netherlands, a bivalent vaccine, composed of recombinant L1 proteins from HPV-16 and -18, is used to prevent cervical cancer since 2009. Long-term vaccination could lead to changes in HPV-16 and -18 virus population, thereby hampering vaccination strategies. We determined the genetic diversity of the L1 gene in HPV-16 and -18 viral strains circulating in the Netherlands at the start of vaccination in order to understand the baseline genetic diversity in the Dutch population. Methods DNA sequences of the L1 gene were determined in HPV-16 (n = 241) and HPV-18 (n = 108) positive anogenital samples collected in 2009 and 2011 among Dutch 16- to 24-year old female and male attendees of the sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinics. Phylogenetic analysis was performed and sequences were compared to reference sequences HPV-16 (AF536179) and HPV-18 (X05015) using BioNumerics 7.1. Results For HPV-16, ninety-five single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) were identified, twenty–seven (28%) were non-synonymous variations. For HPV-18, seventy-one SNPs were identified, twenty-nine (41%) were non-synonymous. The majority of the non-silent variations were located in sequences encoding alpha helix, beta sheet or surface loops, in particular in the immunodominant FG loop, and may influence the protein secondary structure and immune recognition. Conclusions This study provides unique pre-vaccination/baseline data on the genetic L1 diversity of HPV-16 and -18 viruses circulating in the Netherlands among adolescents and young adults."
https://openalex.org/W2339775526,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is an emerging, noninvasive technique of neurostimulation for treating pain. However, the mechanisms and pathways involved in its analgesic effects are poorly understood. Therefore, we investigated the effects of direct current stimulation (DCS) on thermal and mechanical nociceptive thresholds and on the activation of the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) and the dorsal horn of the spinal cord (DHSC) in rats; these central nervous system areas are associated with pain processing. Male Wistar rats underwent cathodal DCS of the motor cortex and, while still under stimulation, were evaluated using tail-flick and paw pressure nociceptive tests. Sham stimulation and naive rats were used as controls. We used a randomized design; the assays were not blinded to the experimenter. Immunoreactivity of the early growth response gene 1 (Egr-1), which is a marker of neuronal activation, was evaluated in the PAG and DHSC, and enkephalin immunoreactivity was evaluated in the DHSC. DCS did not change the thermal nociceptive threshold; however, it increased the mechanical nociceptive threshold of both hind paws compared with that of controls, characterizing a topographical effect. DCS decreased the Egr-1 labeling in the PAG and DHSC as well as the immunoreactivity of spinal enkephalin. Altogether, the data suggest that DCS disinhibits the midbrain descending analgesic pathway, consequently inhibiting spinal nociceptive neurons and causing an increase in the nociceptive threshold. This study reinforces the idea that the motor cortex participates in the neurocircuitry that is involved in analgesia and further clarifies the mechanisms of action of tDCS in pain treatment."

In MM, the increase was larger in healthy subjects when compared to patients with PAF (p<0.05).Intrathoracic pressure swings through simulated obstructive sleep apnea increase P-wave duration and Pd in healthy subjects and in patients with PAF. Our findings imply that intrathoracic pressure swings prolong the intra-atrial and inter-atrial conduction time and therefore may represent an independent trigger factor for the development for PAF."
https://openalex.org/W2339608716,"Brr2 is an RNA-dependent ATPase required to unwind the U4/U6 snRNA duplex during spliceosome assembly. Mutations within the ratchet helix of the Brr2 RNA binding channel result in a form of degenerative human blindness known as retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The biochemical consequences of these mutations on Brr2's RNA binding, helicase, and ATPase activity have not yet been characterized. Therefore, we identified the largest construct of Brr2 that is soluble in vitro, which truncates the first 247 amino acids of the N terminus (Δ247-Brr2), to characterize the effects of the RP mutations on Brr2 activity. The Δ247-Brr2 RP mutants exhibit a gradient of severity of weakened RNA binding, reduced helicase activity, and reduced ATPase activity compared with wild type Δ247-Brr2. The globular C-terminal Jab1/Mpn1-like domain of Prp8 increases the ability of Δ247-Brr2 to bind the U4/U6 snRNA duplex at high pH and increases Δ247-Brr2's RNA-dependent ATPase activity and the extent of RNA unwinding. However, this domain of Prp8 does not differentially affect the Δ247-Brr2 RP mutants compared with the wild type Δ247-Brr2. When stimulated by Prp8, wild type Δ247-Brr2 is able to unwind long stable duplexes in vitro, and even the RP mutants capable of binding RNA with tight affinity are incapable of fully unwinding short duplex RNAs. Our data suggest that the RP mutations within the ratchet helix impair Brr2 translocation through RNA helices."
https://openalex.org/W2342266110,"The response of microbial respiration from soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition to environmental changes plays a key role in predicting future trends of atmospheric CO2 concentration. However, it remains uncertain whether there is a universal trend in the response of microbial respiration to increased temperature and nutrient addition among different vegetation types. In this study, soils were sampled in spring, summer, autumn and winter from five dominant vegetation types, including pine, larch and birch forest, shrubland, and grassland, in the Saihanba area of northern China. Soil samples from each season were incubated at 1, 10, and 20°C for 5 to 7 days. Nitrogen (N; 0.035 mM as NH4NO3) and phosphorus (P; 0.03 mM as P2O5) were added to soil samples, and the responses of soil microbial respiration to increased temperature and nutrient addition were determined. We found a universal trend that soil microbial respiration increased with increased temperature regardless of sampling season or vegetation type. The temperature sensitivity (indicated by Q10, the increase in respiration rate with a 10°C increase in temperature) of microbial respiration was higher in spring and autumn than in summer and winter, irrespective of vegetation type. The Q10 was significantly positively correlated with microbial biomass and the fungal: bacterial ratio. Microbial respiration (or Q10) did not significantly respond to N or P addition. Our results suggest that short-term nutrient input might not change the SOC decomposition rate or its temperature sensitivity, whereas increased temperature might significantly enhance SOC decomposition in spring and autumn, compared with winter and summer."
https://openalex.org/W2340475380,"Models that represent the mechanisms that initiate and sustain atrial fibrillation (AF) in the heart are computationally expensive to simulate and therefore only capture short time scales of a few heart beats. It is therefore difficult to embed biophysical mechanisms into both policy-level disease models, which consider populations of patients over multiple decades, and guidelines that recommend treatment strategies for patients. The aim of this study is to link these modelling paradigms using a stylised population-level model that both represents AF progression over a long time-scale and retains a description of biophysical mechanisms. We develop a non-Markovian binary switching model incorporating three different aspects of AF progression: genetic disposition, disease/age related remodelling, and AF-related remodelling. This approach allows us to simulate individual AF episodes as well as the natural progression of AF in patients over a period of decades. Model parameters are derived, where possible, from the literature, and the model development has highlighted a need for quantitative data that describe the progression of AF in population of patients. The model produces time series data of AF episodes over the lifetimes of simulated patients. These are analysed to quantitatively describe progression of AF in terms of several underlying parameters. Overall, the model has potential to link mechanisms of AF to progression, and to be used as a tool to study clinical markers of AF or as training data for AF classification algorithms."
https://openalex.org/W2336884549,"Aim This study set out to investigate whether cognitive coping strategies that match participants’ preferred coping style effectively reduce pain intensity and situational anxiety in a population of people with chronic pain. Method Chronic pain patients (N = 43) completed questionnaires on coping style, pain intensity, self-efficacy, and situational/trait anxiety. Participants were classified as Monitors (n = 16) or Blunters (n = 19) based on their Miller Behavioural Style Scale score. Participants were then provided with an audiotaped intervention in which they were instructed to focus on pain sensations or to engage in a distraction task and then to rate the pain intensity and their anxiety during and after the attentional focus and distraction conditions. The two interventions were each completed by all participants, having been presented in counterbalanced order. Results Findings revealed that Monitors’ level of anxiety decreased following a congruent (i.e., sensation-focused) intervention. No effects were obtained in terms of perceived pain. For blunters, however, their perceived levels of anxiety and pain did not attenuate following a congruent, distraction-focused intervention. Conclusion Among persons experiencing chronic pain, tailoring coping strategies to match an individual’s preferred coping style–in particular, those with a high level of monitoring–may enhance the benefit of psychological approaches to management of anxiety."
https://openalex.org/W2340303790,"DNA replication in eukaryotic cells requires minimally three B-family DNA polymerases: Pol α, Pol δ, and Pol ɛ. Pol δ replicates and matures Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand of the replication fork. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pol δ is a three-subunit enzyme (Pol3-Pol31-Pol32). A small C-terminal domain of the catalytic subunit Pol3 carries both iron-sulfur cluster and zinc-binding motifs, which mediate interactions with Pol31, and processive replication with the replication clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), respectively. We show that the entire N-terminal domain of Pol3, containing polymerase and proofreading activities, could be effectively replaced by those from bacteriophage RB69, and could carry out chromosomal DNA replication in yeast with remarkable high fidelity, provided that adaptive mutations in the replication clamp PCNA were introduced. This result is consistent with the model that all essential interactions for DNA replication in yeast are mediated through the small C-terminal domain of Pol3.

The chimeric polymerase carries out processive replication with PCNA in vitro; however, in yeast, it requires an increased involvement of the mutagenic translesion DNA polymerase ζ during DNA replication. Replication of genomic DNA during each cell cycle requires the action of replicative DNA polymerases. To ensure faithful transmission of genomic information from the parent to the daughter cells, these polymerases must work efficiently and with very high fidelity (1Drake J.W.

Furthermore, under certain conditions, such as those of replication restart following DNA recombination, Pol δ carries out substantial DNA synthesis of both strands (10Miyabe I. Mizuno K.

The fourth B-family enzyme, Pol ζ, is required for translesion synthesis in response to DNA damage, which results in the bulk of damage-induced mutagenesis in eukaryotes (11Nelson J.R. Lawrence C.W.

B-family DNA polymerases are ubiquitous; they are found in eukaryotes, bacteria, archaea, and in both bacterial and eukaryotic DNA-based viruses (13Johansson E. Dixon N. Replicative DNA polymerases.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5a012799 Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). All B-family enzymes contain three conserved domains: a structural N-terminal domain (NTD), a 3′-5′ exonuclease domain, and the polymerase domain containing the palm, finger, and thumb sub-domains. The NTD is highly conserved, but a specific function for this domain has been assigned only to some archaeal enzymes, in which the NTD recognizes template uracil residues and inhibits continued replication by the DNA polymerase (14Fogg M.J.

The exonuclease domain serves to carry out proofreading of polymerase errors in most enzymes. However, eukaryotic Pol α and Pol ζ, while maintaining this structural domain, lack exonuclease activity. The polymerase domain carries out high-fidelity DNA synthesis, with the notable exception of the translesion synthesis enzyme Pol ζ (16Haracska L. Prakash S. Prakash L.

The cellular eukaryotic members of the B-family are structurally more complex in that they are multi-subunit enzymes, and secondly, they uniquely contain an additional, small C-terminal domain (CTD) in the polymerase subunit, which mediates interactions with these accessory subunits (13Johansson E.

Interactions between Pol3 and Pol31 occur through the Pol3 CTD and require an intact iron-sulfur cluster (21Netz D.J. Stith C.M. Stümpfig M. Köpf G. Vogel D. Genau H.M. Stodola J.L. Lill R.

Pol δ alone is a low-processivity enzyme, replicating only a few nucleotides before dissociating from DNA. This problem is overcome through interactions with the replication clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (33Tan C.K. Castillo C. So A.G. Downey K.M.

PCNA is a donut-shaped homotrimeric protein that is loaded onto DNA template-primer termini by replication factor C (RFC) in an ATP-dependent manner (34Majka J. Burgers P.M.

We were interested in understanding what structural domains of Pol δ are required for efficient replication of the budding yeast genome. Although mutations that inactivate polymerase activity cause lethality in yeast (41Pavlov Y.I. Shcherbakova P.V. Kunkel T.A. In vivo consequences of putative active site mutations in yeast DNA polymerases α, ɛ, δ, and ζ.Genetics. 2001; 159: 47-64PubMed Google Scholar), mutations that abrogate exonuclease activity are viable but cause fidelity defects (42Simon M.

The 3′ to 5′ exonuclease activity located in the DNA polymerase δ subunit of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is required for accurate replication.EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2165-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that structural determinants in the NTD, or in the two catalytic domains, may be essential for replisome activity. The overall structure of these three domains is conserved in B-family DNA polymerases, as shown by the superimposition of the structure of bacteriophage Rb69 DNA polymerase with that of the same domains of Pol3 (see Fig. 1A). Lacking from the Pol3 structure is its CTD, which mediates interactions with the accessory subunits and, both directly and indirectly, with PCNA. We hypothesized that the essential factors enabling Pol δ to act in a eukaryotic setting are the ability to bind its accessory subunits and PCNA. To test this hypothesis, we created a chimeric polymerase subunit by replacing the Pol3 NTD and catalytic core domains with those from the structurally homologous bacteriophage RB69 DNA polymerase. Rb69 and T4 are closely related bacteriophages that use a polymerase processivity model similar to Pol δ, containing a homotrimeric clamp and an ATP-dependent clamp loader (gp45 and gp44/62, respectively) (43Moarefi I. Jeruzalmi D. Turner J. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Crystal structure of the DNA polymerase processivity factor of T4 bacteriophage.J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 1215-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). We found that fusing the 104-kDa RB69 DNA polymerase to the 13-kDa CTD of Pol3 was sufficient to form a three-subunit polymerase complex with Pol31 and Pol32 in yeast. The processivity of this polymerase complex was stimulated by PCNA, but processivity was compromised as compared with Pol δ. We obtained more robust stimulation of this engineered form of Pol δ when we introduced two adaptive mutations in PCNA, and this genetic arrangement conferred growth in yeast that contained the fusion polymerase as the only source of Pol δ. Remarkably, when we eliminated fidelity-lowering contributions made by the mutagenic Pol ζ, the fidelity of the engineered Pol δ approximated that of the native enzyme. Strains were derived from PY227 by integration of the appropriate gene deletion cassettes. The strains used were PY227 (MATα his3Δ-1 leu2-3,112 trp1-Δ ura3-52 pol3Δ::KANMX4 + pBL304 (POL3 URA3)); PY236 (PY227 but leu2::pBL248-rb2 (LEU2, pol30-rb2 (pol30-Q29H,K31R))); PY237 (PY236 but rev3Δ::NATMX4); PY238 (PY236 but rad30Δ::HIS3); PY239 (PY236 but rev3Δ::NATMX4 rad30Δ::HIS3); and PY343 (PY236 but pol32Δ::HIS3). The plasmids used were pBL248 (LEU2, POL30); pBL248-rb2 (as pBL248 but pol30-rb2 (pol30-Q29H,K31R)); pBL249 (POL30 in pRS315 (CEN ARS LEU2)); pBL249-rb2 (as pBL249 but pol30-rb2 (pol30-Q29H,K31R)); pBL304 (POL3 in yCP50 (CEN ARS URA3)); pBL309 (POL3 in pRS314 (CEN6 ARSH1 TRP1)); pBL325 (2-μm origin TRP1 GAL1-[GST-3C-RbPol-POL3CTD]), containing a fusion of the GST gene to a rhinoviral 3C protease recognition site, followed by the RbPol(1–896)-POL3(981–1097) fusion gene; pBL326 (RbPol(1–896)-POL3(981–1097) fusion under control of the attenuated ADH1 promoter, in pRS424 (TRP1 2-μm origin)); and pBL341 (2-μm origin URA3 GAL1-POL31 GAL10-POL32). All strains and plasmids and their sequences are available from the corresponding author upon request. Pol δ, Rb69 DNA polymerase (RbPol), PCNA, RFC, Replication Protein A, FEN1, and DNA ligase I were purified as described (2Wang J. Sattar A.K. Wang C.C. Karam J.D. Konigsberg W.H. Steitz T.A.

To obtain RbPol δ, yeast strain BJ2168 (MATa ura3-52 trp1-289 leu2-3,112 prb1-1122 prc1-407 pep4-3) was transformed with plasmids pBL341 and pBL325. Growth and galactose induction and extract preparation were as described, and RbPol δ was purified by glutathione affinity purification and, following removal of the GST tag with rhinoviral 3C protease, by Mono S chromatography similar to the process described for Pol δ (45Fortune J.M. Pavlov Y.I. Welch C.M. Johansson E. Burgers P.M. Kunkel T.A. Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA polymerase δ: high fidelity for base substitutions but lower fidelity for single- and multi-base deletions.J.

To make yeast strains containing a chromosomal copy of the pol30-rb2 allele, integrating plasmid pBL248-rb2, pBL248 as control was cut with HpaI, which cuts once in the LEU2 gene, and transformed into the appropriate leu2-3,112 strains to leucine prototrophy. To determine phenotypes of the pol3-69 allele, the appropriate pol3Δ strains, containing pBL304 as complementing plasmid, were transformed with pBL326, or pBL309 as positive control, with Trp selection, and transformants were passed over 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA)-containing medium to evict complementing plasmid pBL304 (POL3 URA3). DNA damage sensitivity assays were carried out using standard protocols. Fluctuation analyses to determine spontaneous mutation rates were carried out in triplicate with 15–20 independent cultures, and then analyzed by the median (46Lea D.E. Coulson C.A. The distribution of the number of mutants in bacterial populations.J. Genet. 1948; 49: 264-285Crossref Scopus (1082) Google Scholar). The POL30 gene in pBL249 was PCR-mutagenized as described (47Cadwell R.C. Joyce G.F. Randomization of genes by PCR mutagenesis.PCR Methods Appl. 1992; 2: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). The library was transformed into PY227 containing both pBL304 and pBL326 and then plated onto SC-Leu medium (where SC stands for “synthetic complete”), and after 2 days of growth, replica-plated onto SC-Leu plates containing 5-FOA to evict the pBL304 plasmid. Plasmid DNA was isolated from positive colonies and reapplied to the same screen. The pBL249 isolates from the second screen that allowed yeast growth without pBL304 were sequenced. The most robust suppressor pol30-rb1 carried six non-synonymous mutations (F12Y, D17A, Q29H, K31R, I52M, I100T). Each mutation was separately reverted back to wild type, and loss of suppression was assessed. From this analysis, we determined that the Q29H mutation was essential for suppression and that K31R increased suppression. Therefore, pol30-rb2 contains only the Q29H and K31R mutations. Assays contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 1 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 0.5 mm ATP, 100 μm each of dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 10 mm of [α-32P]dATP, 100 mm NaCl, 3.5 nm single-stranded Bluescript DNA, singly primed at positions 592–621, either with a 30-mer DNA primer or with a 5′-RNA8DNA22 primer, 400 nm Replication Protein A, and PCNA or pcna-rb2 as indicated. PCNA was loaded onto the primed DNA by incubation with 7 nm RFC at 30 °C for 1 min prior to reaction initiation. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 7 nm Pol δ or RbPol δ. In the assays in Fig. 2D, 7 nm FEN1 and 14 nm DNA ligase I were added together with the polymerase. Aliquots were taken at various time points and stopped with 50 mm EDTA and 0.2% SDS final concentration. Reactions were resolved either on a 1% alkaline agarose gel (see Fig. 2B) or on a 1% neutral agarose gel containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide. Gels were dried and documented by PhosphorImager analysis (GE Healthcare). Alternatively, 1 ml of 10% trichloroacetic acid was added to stopped replication samples. After 10 min on ice, the mixture was filtered over a GF/C filter, and then the filter was washed twice with 2 ml of 1 m HCl and 0.05 m sodium pyrophosphate, rinsed with ethanol, dried, and counted in counting fluid in a liquid scintillation counter. All assays were carried out in duplicate or triplicate, and either representative gels are presented or standard errors are shown (see Fig. 2C). Bacteriophage T4 expresses a replication elongation apparatus consisting of a B-family DNA polymerase, a homotrimeric replication clamp gp45, which is the orthologue of eukaryotic PCNA, and an ATP-dependent clamp loader. Although extensive biochemical and genetic DNA replication studies are available for the T4 system (48Kreuzer K.N. Brister J.R.

https://openalex.org/W2341410220,"Collective decision making often benefits both the individuals and the group in a variety of contexts. However, for the group to be successful, individuals should be able to strike a balance between their level of competence and their influence on the collective decisions. The hormone oxytocin has been shown to promote trust, conformism and attention to social cues. We wondered if this hormone may increase participants’ (unwarranted) reliance on their partners’ opinion, resulting in a reduction in collective benefit by disturbing the balance between influence and competence. To test this hypothesis we employed a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled design in which male dyads self-administered intranasal oxytocin or placebo and then performed a visual search task together. Compared to placebo, collective benefit did not decrease under oxytocin. Using an exploratory time dependent analysis, we observed increase in collective benefit over time under oxytocin. Moreover, trial-by-trial analysis showed that under oxytocin the more competent member of each dyad was less likely to change his mind during disagreements, while the less competent member showed a greater willingness to change his mind and conform to the opinion of his more reliable partner. This role-dependent effect may be mediated by enhanced monitoring of own and other’s performance level under oxytocin. Such enhanced social learning could improve the balance between influence and competence and lead to efficient and beneficial collaboration."
https://openalex.org/W2340030521,"The specific molecular mechanisms involved in somatic reprogramming remain unidentified. Removal of the oocyte genome is one of the primary causes of developmental failure in cloned embryos, whereas intact oocyte shows stronger reprogramming capability than enucleated oocyte. To identify the reason for the low efficiency of cloning and elucidate the mechanisms involved in somatic reprogramming by the oocyte nucleus, we injected pig cumulus cells into 539 intact MII oocytes and 461 enucleated MII oocytes. Following activation, 260 polyploidy embryos developed to the blastocyst stage whereas only 93 traditionally cloned embryos (48.2% vs. 20.2%, P < 0.01) reached blastocyst stage. Blastocysts generated from intact oocytes also had more cells than those generated from enucleated oocytes (60.70 vs. 46.65, P < 0.01). To identify the genes that contribute to this phenomenon, two early embryos in 2-cell and 4-cell stages were collected for single-cell RNA sequencing. The two kinds of embryos were found to have dramatically different transcriptome profiles. Intact oocyte nuclear transfer embryos showed 1,738 transcripts that were up-regulated relative to enucleated cloned embryos at the 2-cell stage and 728 transcripts that were down-regulated (|log2Ratio| ≥ 5). They showed 2,941 transcripts that were up-regulated during the 4-cell stage and 1,682 that were down-regulated (|log2Ratio| ≥ 5). The most significantly enriched gene ontology categories were those involved in the regulation of binding, catalytic activity, and molecular transducer activity. Other genes that were notably up-regulated and expressed in intact oocyte nuclear transfer embryos were metabolic process. This study provides a comprehensive profile of the differences in gene expression between intact oocyte nuclear transfer embryos and traditional nuclear transfer embryos. This work thus paves the way for further research on the mechanisms underlying somatic reprogramming by oocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2341120475,"When a dataset is imbalanced, the prediction of the scarcely-sampled subpopulation can be over-influenced by the population contributing to the majority of the data. The aim of this study was to develop a Bayesian modelling approach with balancing informative prior so that the influence of imbalance to the overall prediction could be minimised. The new approach was developed in order to weigh the data in favour of the smaller subset(s). The method was assessed in terms of bias and precision in predicting model parameter estimates of simulated datasets. Moreover, the method was evaluated in predicting optimal dose levels of tobramycin for various age groups in a motivating example. The bias estimates using the balancing informative prior approach were smaller than those generated using the conventional approach which was without the consideration for the imbalance in the datasets. The precision estimates were also superior. The method was further evaluated in a motivating example of optimal dosage prediction of tobramycin. The resulting predictions also agreed well with what had been reported in the literature. The proposed Bayesian balancing informative prior approach has shown a real potential to adequately weigh the data in favour of smaller subset(s) of data to generate robust prediction models."
https://openalex.org/W2342314145,"High-throughput sequencing continues to produce an immense volume of information that is processed and assembled into mature sequence data. Data analysis tools are urgently needed that leverage the embedded DNA sequence polymorphisms and consequent changes to restriction sites or sequence motifs in a high-throughput manner to enable biological experimentation. CisSERS was developed as a standalone open source tool to analyze sequence datasets and provide biologists with individual or comparative genome organization information in terms of presence and frequency of patterns or motifs such as restriction enzymes. Predicted agarose gel visualization of the custom analyses results was also integrated to enhance the usefulness of the software. CisSERS offers several novel functionalities, such as handling of large and multiple datasets in parallel, multiple restriction enzyme site detection and custom motif detection features, which are seamlessly integrated with real time agarose gel visualization. Using a simple fasta-formatted file as input, CisSERS utilizes the REBASE enzyme database. Results from CisSERS enable the user to make decisions for designing genotyping by sequencing experiments, reduced representation sequencing, 3'UTR sequencing, and cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) molecular markers for large sample sets. CisSERS is a java based graphical user interface built around a perl backbone. Several of the applications of CisSERS including CAPS molecular marker development were successfully validated using wet-lab experimentation. Here, we present the tool CisSERS and results from in-silico and corresponding wet-lab analyses demonstrating that CisSERS is a technology platform solution that facilitates efficient data utilization in genomics and genetics studies."
https://openalex.org/W2336757378,"Dental modifications in the Caribbean are considered to be an African practice introduced to the Caribbean archipelago by the influx of enslaved Africans during colonial times. Skeletal remains which exhibited dental modifications are by default considered to be Africans, African descendants, or post-contact indigenous people influenced by an African practice. Individual E-105 from the site of Canímar Abajo (Cuba), with a direct 14C AMS date of 990-800 cal BC, provides the first unequivocal evidence of dental modifications in the Antilles prior to contact with Europeans in AD 1492. Central incisors showing evidence of significant crown reduction (loss of crown volume regardless of its etiology) were examined macroscopically and with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to determine if the observed alterations were due to deliberate modification or other (unintentional) factors considered: postmortem breakage, violent accidental breakage, non-dietary use of teeth, and wear caused by habitual or repeated actions. The pattern of crown reduction is consistent with deliberate dental modification of the type commonly encountered among African and African descendent communities in post-contact Caribbean archaeological assemblages. Six additional individuals show similar pattern of crown reduction of maxillary incisors with no analogous wear in corresponding mandibular dentition."
https://openalex.org/W2341443671,"Abstract Wealthy schools appoint better qualified teachers, less wealthy schools under qualified teachers. Added to this mix is a powerful teacher’s union whose policies attempt to entrench the job security of teachers in the less wealthy schools irrespective of whether they can teach their subjects or not. Can one isolate these effects from that of other socio-demographic factors that may also be affecting the performance of students when they enrol for a degree at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN)? An outcome variable that subtracts the number of courses that have been failed from the number of courses that have been passed, dividing this by the total number of years that they have spent studying for a particular degree will be used as a response variable for this paper. Objectives The system of secondary education in South Africa is highly polarized. On the one hand, we have a group of mainly Black African students, forming about 80% of the total student population, that come from a vastly under-resourced rural or township based community. On the other hand, we have a group of predominantly White and Indian students who are able to attend a far better resourced set of private schools. Added to this mix, we have 240,000 of South Africa’s total number of 390,000 primary and secondary school teachers who belong to a powerful teacher’s union which enjoys a strong political alliance with the ruling party in South Africa. With most of their union members teaching in the less wealthy schools in South Africa, `school background’ now includes a politically motivated component that focuses on teacher self–interest rather than the education of the child. What sort of effect does school background have on the performance of students when they enter an institution of higher learning? More importantly, can one isolate the effect of school background from that of other possibly confounding factors such as gender, financial aid and the receipt of some form of residence based accommodation that will also impact on their performance while at university? Method A total of 6,183 students enrolling for a degree at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) over the period 2008 to 2012 were used a dataset for this study. Permission to use this dataset was given by the Teaching and Learning Office at UKZN. The database that was used for this study was obtained from the Division of Management Information (DMI) office at UKZN. The percentage based marks that students have managed to record for Mathematics, English, Biology and Accounting in their school leaving exams together with some other important but observable socio-economic factors were included in a regression model to determine how students will perform at UKZN. Socio-economic variables relating to gender, race and whether they have receivd some form of financial aid or residence based accommodation while studying at university were also included as predictor variables in our regression based model structure. Results and Conclusions An interaction effect associated with being a Black African student who has been privileged enough to attend a quintile five school was found to be significant. A main effect associated with being able to attend a more privileged quintile 5 school however was found to be nonsignificant even after an adjustment has been made for gender, race, the receipt of some form of financial aid and residence based accommodation. Given that UKZN already has a number of bridging programs in place that target students who have come from a less privileged background, for university based policymakers, this result may help to justify the targeted selection of Black African students from the less privileged schools that is taking place. Because some of the disparity in matric performance that we are observing may also be associated with teacher competency and the protective influence of a powerful teacher’s union, this paper may also help to highlight some of the economic costs related with having under-prepared students. “A mind is a terrible thing to waste”–United Negro College Fund."
