https://openalex.org/W1970090817,"In yeast, the transmembrane protein kinase/endoribonuclease Ire1p activated by endoplasmic reticulum stress cleaves HAC1 mRNA, leading to production of the transcription factor Hac1p that activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). In mammals, no Hac1p counterpart has yet been discovered despite the presence of Ire1p homologs in the endoplasmic reticulum. Instead, the transcription factor ATF6 specific to the mammalian UPR is regulated by intramembrane proteolysis. Here, we identified the transcription factor XBP1, a target of ATF6, as a mammalian substrate of such an unconventional mRNA splicing system and showed that only the spliced form of XBP1 can activate the UPR efficiently. Our results reveal features of the UPR conserved during evolution and clarify the relationship between IRE1- and ATF6-dependent pathways."

The IMF has been estimated from low-mass brown dwarfs to very massive stars. Combining IMF estimates for different populations in which the stars can be observed individually unveils an extraordinary uniformity of the IMF. This general insight appears to hold for populations including present-day star formation in small molecular clouds, rich and dense massive star-clusters forming in giant clouds, through to ancient and metal-poor exotic stellar populations that may be dominated by dark matter. This apparent universality of the IMF is a challenge for star formation theory, because elementary considerations suggest that the IMF ought to systematically vary with star-forming conditions."

Here, we report the production of four live pigs in which one allele of the α-1,3-galactosyltransferase locus has been knocked out. These pigs were produced by nuclear transfer technology; clonal fetal fibroblast cell lines were used as nuclear donors for embryos reconstructed with enucleated pig oocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1989011389,"We have examined posttranslational regulation of clock proteins in mouse liver in vivo. The mouse PERIOD proteins (mPER1 and mPER2), CLOCK, and BMAL1 undergo robust circadian changes in phosphorylation. These proteins, the cryptochromes (mCRY1 and mCRY2), and casein kinase I epsilon (CKIepsilon) form multimeric complexes that are bound to DNA during negative transcriptional feedback. CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers remain bound to DNA over the circadian cycle. The temporal increase in mPER abundance controls the negative feedback interactions. Analysis of clock proteins in mCRY-deficient mice shows that the mCRYs are necessary for stabilizing phosphorylated mPER2 and for the nuclear accumulation of mPER1, mPER2, and CKIepsilon. We also provide in vivo evidence that casein kinase I delta is a second clock relevant kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2150589615,"Wnt signaling via the Frizzled (Fz) receptor controls cell polarity and movement during development, but the molecular nature of Wnt/Fz polarity signal transduction remains poorly defined. Here we report that in human cells and during Xenopus embryogenesis, Wnt/Fz signaling activates the small GTPase Rho, a key regulator of cytoskeleton architecture. Wnt/Fz activation of Rho requires the cytoplasmic protein Dishevelled (Dvl) and a novel Formin homology protein Daam1. Daam1 binds to both Dvl and Rho, and mediates Wnt-induced Dvl-Rho complex formation. Inhibition or depletion of Daam1 prevents Wnt/Fz activation of Rho and of Xenopus gastrulation, but not of beta-catenin signaling. Our study illustrates a molecular pathway from Wnt/Fz signaling to Rho activation in cell polarity signal transduction."

https://openalex.org/W1965843055,"The unfolded protein response (UPR) is a transcriptional and translational intracellular signaling pathway activated by the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). We have used C. elegans as a genetic model system to dissect UPR signaling in a multicellular organism. C. elegans requires ire-1-mediated splicing of xbp-1 mRNA for UPR gene transcription and survival upon ER stress. In addition, ire-1/xbp-1 acts with pek-1, a protein kinase that mediates translation attenuation, in complementary pathways that are essential for worm development and survival. We propose that UPR transcriptional activation by ire-1 as well as translational attenuation by pek-1 maintain ER homeostasis. The results demonstrate that the UPR and ER homeostasis are essential for metazoan development."
https://openalex.org/W1571012087,"Existing phenol production processes tend to be energy-consuming and produce unwanted by-products. We report an efficient process using a shell-and-tube reactor, in which a gaseous mixture of benzene and oxygen is fed into a porous alumina tube coated with a palladium thin layer and hydrogen is fed into the shell. Hydrogen dissociated on the palladium layer surface permeates onto the back and reacts with oxygen to give active oxygen species, which attack benzene to produce phenol. This one-step process attained phenol formation selectivities of 80 to 97% at benzene conversions of 2 to 16% below 250 degrees C (phenol yield: 1.5 kilograms per kilogram of catalyst per hour at 150 degrees C)."
https://openalex.org/W2086600191,"Initial water deposition on the moderately reactive precious metal surface Ru(0001) has been thought to produce an ice-like bilayer. However, calculations from first principles show that the wetting layer observed on Ru(0001) cannot be formed of undissociated water molecules. An energetically favorable alternative, consistent with the remarkable observation that the wetting layer's oxygen atoms are nearly coplanar, is a half-dissociated monolayer wherein water molecules and hydroxyl fragments are hydrogen-bonded in a hexagonal structure and hydrogen atoms bind directly to the metal."
https://openalex.org/W2028732731,"We derive joint probability density distributions for three key uncertain properties of the climate system, using an optimal fingerprinting approach to compare simulations of an intermediate complexity climate model with three distinct diagnostics of recent climate observations. On the basis of the marginal probability distributions, the 5 to 95% confidence intervals are 1.4 to 7.7 kelvin for climate sensitivity and -0.30 to -0.95 watt per square meter for the net aerosol forcing. The oceanic heat uptake is not well constrained, but ocean temperature observations do help to constrain climate sensitivity. The uncertainty in the net aerosol forcing is much smaller than the uncertainty range for the indirect aerosol forcing alone given in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Third Assessment Report."
https://openalex.org/W2026920679,"To permit direct functional analyses of neural circuits, we have developed a method for stimulating groups of genetically designated neurons optically. Coexpression of the Drosophila photoreceptor genes encoding arrestin-2, rhodopsin (formed by liganding opsin with retinal), and the alpha subunit of the cognate heterotrimeric G protein--an explosive combination we term ""chARGe""--sensitizes generalist vertebrate neurons to light. Illumination of a mixed population of neurons elicits action potentials selectively and cell-autonomously in its genetically chARGed members. In contrast to bath-applied photostimulants or caged neurotransmitters, which act indiscriminately throughout the illuminated volume, chARGe localizes the responsiveness to light. Distributed activity may thus be fed directly into a circumscribed population of neurons in intact tissue, irrespective of the spatial arrangement of its elements."
https://openalex.org/W1975673533,"Tumstatin is a 28-kilodalton fragment of type IV collagen that displays both anti-angiogenic and proapoptotic activity. Here we show that tumstatin functions as an endothelial cell–specific inhibitor of protein synthesis. Through a requisite interaction with αVβ3 integrin, tumstatin inhibits activation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and it prevents the dissociation of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E protein (eIF4E) from 4E-binding protein 1. These results establish a role for integrins in mediating cell-specific inhibition of cap-dependent protein synthesis and suggest a potential mechanism for tumstatin's selective effects on endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2133097845,"The silencing of gene expression by segments of DNA present in excess of the normal number is called cosuppression in plants and quelling in fungi. We describe a related process, meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA (MSUD). DNA unpaired in meiosis causes silencing of all DNA homologous to it, including genes that are themselves paired. A semidominant Neurospora mutant, Sad-1, fails to perform MSUD. Sad-1 suppresses the sexual phenotypes of many ascus-dominant mutants. MSUD may provide insights into the function of genes necessary for meiosis, including genes for which ablation in vegetative life would be lethal. It may also contribute to reproductive isolation of species within the genus Neurospora. The wild-type allele, sad-1(+), encodes a putative RNA-directed RNA polymerase."
https://openalex.org/W1978855399,"Cellulose synthesis in plants requires beta-1,4-glucan chain initiation, elongation, and termination. The process of chain elongation is likely to be distinct from the process of chain initiation. We demonstrate that a CesA glucosyltransferase initiates glucan polymerization by using sitosterol-beta-glucoside (SG) as primer. Cotton fiber membranes synthesize sitosterol-cellodextrins (SCDs) from SG and uridine 5'-diphosphate-glucose (UDP-Glc) under conditions that also favor cellulose synthesis. The cellulase encoded by the Korrigan (Kor) gene, required for cellulose synthesis in plants, may function to cleave SG from the growing polymer chain."
https://openalex.org/W2155060440,"Repertoires of grooming behaviors critical to survival are exhibited by most animal species, including humans. Genes that influence this complex behavior are unknown. We report that mice with disruptions of Hoxb8 show, with 100% penetrance, excessive grooming leading to hair removal and lesions. Additionally, these mice excessively groom normal cagemates. We have been unable to detect any skin or PNS abnormalities in Hoxb8 mutants. These observations suggest that the excessive, pathological grooming exhibited by these mice results from CNS abnormalities. Consistent with this interpretation, we demonstrate Hoxb8 expression in regions of the adult mouse CNS previously implicated in the control of grooming. The aberrant behavior observed in Hoxb8 mutants is not unlike that of humans suffering from the OC-spectrum disorder, trichotillomania. Interestingly, Hoxb8 is expressed in regions of the CNS known as the ""OCD-circuit."""
https://openalex.org/W2046221312,"The chaperonin GroEL drives its protein-folding cycle by cooperatively binding ATP to one of its two rings, priming that ring to become folding-active upon GroES binding, while simultaneously discharging the previous folding chamber from the opposite ring. The GroEL-ATP structure, determined by cryo-EM and atomic structure fitting, shows that the intermediate domains rotate downward, switching their intersubunit salt bridge contacts from substrate binding to ATP binding domains. These observations, together with the effects of ATP binding to a GroEL-GroES-ADP complex, suggest structural models for the ATP-induced reduction in affinity for polypeptide and for cooperativity. The model for cooperativity, based on switching of intersubunit salt bridge interactions around the GroEL ring, may provide general insight into cooperativity in other ring complexes and molecular machines."
https://openalex.org/W2087575288,"The JAK/STAT signaling pathway, renowned for its effects on cell proliferation and survival, is constitutively active in various human cancers, including ovarian. We have found that JAK and STAT are required to convert the border cells in the Drosophila ovary from stationary, epithelial cells to migratory, invasive cells. The ligand for this pathway, Unpaired (UPD), is expressed by two central cells within the migratory cell cluster. Mutations in upd or jak cause defects in migration and a reduction in the number of cells recruited to the cluster. Ectopic expression of either UPD or JAK is sufficient to induce extra epithelial cells to migrate. Thus, a localized signal activates the JAK/STAT pathway in neighboring epithelial cells, causing them to become invasive."
https://openalex.org/W2025999411,"Many human cancers originate from defects in the DNA damage response (DDR). Although much is known about this process, it is likely that additional DDR genes remain to be discovered. To identify such genes, we used a strategy that combines protein-protein interaction mapping and large-scale phenotypic analysis in Caenorhabditis elegans. Together, these approaches identified 12 worm DDR orthologs and 11 novel DDR genes. One of these is the putative ortholog of hBCL3, a gene frequently altered in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Thus, the combination of functional genomic mapping approaches in model organisms may facilitate the identification and characterization of genes involved in cancer and, perhaps, other human diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2127535708,"Slit proteins have previously been shown to regulate axon guidance, branching, and neural migration. Here we report that, in addition to acting as a chemorepellant for cortical axons, Slit1 regulates dendritic development. Slit1 is expressed in the developing cortex, and exposure to Slit1 leads to increased dendritic growth and branching. Conversely, inhibition of Slit-Robo interactions by Robo-Fc fusion proteins or by a dominant-negative Robo attenuates dendritic branching. Stimulation of neurons transfected with a Met-Robo chimeric receptor with Hepatocyte growth factor leads to a robust induction of dendritic growth and branching, suggesting that Robo-mediated signaling is sufficient to induce dendritic remodeling. These experiments indicate that Slit-Robo interactions may exert a significant influence over the specification of cortical neuron morphology by regulating both axon guidance and dendritic patterning."
https://openalex.org/W2019832209,"Pseudouridine (Psi) synthases catalyze the isomerization of specific uridines in cellular RNAs to pseudouridines and may function as RNA chaperones. TruB is responsible for the Psi residue present in the T loops of virtually all tRNAs. The close homolog Cbf5/dyskerin is the catalytic subunit of box H/ACA snoRNPs. These carry out the pseudouridylation of eukaryotic rRNA and snRNAs. The 1.85 A resolution structure of TruB bound to RNA reveals that this enzyme recognizes the preformed three-dimensional structure of the T loop, primarily through shape complementarity. It accesses its substrate uridyl residue by flipping out the nucleotide and disrupts the tertiary structure of tRNA. Structural comparisons with TruB demonstrate that all Psi synthases are descended from a common molecular ancestor."

Here, we show that withdrawal of coenzyme Q (Q) from the diet of wild-type nematodes extends adult life-span by approximately 60%. The longevity of clk-1, daf-2, daf-12, and daf-16 mutants is also extended by a Q-less diet. These results establish the importance of Q in life-span determination. The findings suggest that Q and the daf-2 pathway intersect at the mitochondria and imply that a concerted production coupled with enhanced scavenging of reactive oxygen species contributes to the substantial life-span extension."
https://openalex.org/W2084194105,"Post-translational modifications of histones, in general, and acetylation/deacetylation, in particular, can dramatically alter gene expression in eukaryotic cells. In humans, four highly homologous class I HDAC enzymes (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8) have been identified to date. Although HDAC3 shares some structural and functional similarities with other class I HDACs, it exists in multisubunit complexes separate and different from other known HDAC complexes, implying that individual HDACs might function in a distinct manner. In this current study, to understand further the cellular function of HDAC3 and to uncover possible unique roles this protein may have in gene regulation, we performed a detailed analysis of HDAC3 using deletion mutations. Surprisingly, we found that the non-conserved C-terminal region of HDAC3 is required for both deacetylase and transcriptional repression activity. In addition, we discovered that the central portion of the HDAC3 protein possesses a nuclear export signal, whereas the C-terminal part of HDAC3 contributes to the protein's localization in the nucleus. Finally, we found that HDAC3 forms oligomers in vitro and in vivo and that the N-terminal portion of HDAC3 is necessary for this property. These data indicate that HDAC3 comprises separate, non-overlapping domains that contribute to the unique properties and function of this protein.

Because class I HDACs are ubiquitously expressed, whereas most class II HDACs are tissue-specific, it has been proposed that the class I enzymes may be important in the regulation of housekeeping genes (13Yang W.M.

Because of the high degree of sequence similarity between HDAC1 and HDAC2, together with the fact that they often coexist in the same complexes, it is difficult to assess the functional differences between these two enzymes. Human HDAC3 was first cloned based on sequence similarities to HDAC1 and HDAC2 (13Yang W.M. Yao Y.L. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. J. Biol.

Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of HDAC3 revealed an open reading frame of 428 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 49 kDa. The HDAC3 protein is 50% identical in DNA sequence and 53% identical in protein sequence compared with the previously cloned human HDAC1. Comparison of the HDAC3 sequence with human HDAC2 also yielded similar results, with 51% identity in DNA sequence and 52% identity in protein sequence. Unlike HDAC1/2, HDAC3 is present in a unique large protein complex that contains members of the nuclear receptor corepressor family and the transducin β-like I protein, whose gene is mutated in human sensorineural deafness (26Wen Y.D.

Therefore, it appears that some functions of HDAC3 may be distinct from HDAC1 and HDAC2 and possibly all other HDACs. Early studies indicate that HDAC3 mRNA is up-regulated in PHA-activated T cells and down-regulated by granulocyte macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (25Dangond F. Hafler D.A. Tong J.K. Randall J.

Furthermore, overexpression of HDAC3 in transfected THP-1 or HeLa cells leads to an accumulation of cells in G2/M phase, with an increase in cell size and aberrant nuclear morphology (25Dangond F.

To facilitate the functional studies of HDAC3 and possibly identify novel structural-functional motifs, we constructed a series of HDAC3 deletion mutants and assayed for 1) their abilities to deacetylate core histones, 2) their abilities to repress transcription, 3) their nuclear/cytoplasmic localization, and 4) their abilities to oligomerize. Our results indicate that different activities reside in independent, non-overlapping domains within HDAC3. FLAG-HDAC3 serial deletion mutants were made by digesting the HDAC3 cDNA using appropriate restriction enzyme sites to generate the deletion mutants, which were then fused in-frame into the pME18S-FLAG or pCEP4F vector (13Yang W.M. Yao Y.L. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28001-28007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The FLAG-HDAC3 serial deletion mutant insertion fragments were subsequently subcloned into the Gal4 expression plasmid pM1, which contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) (36Sadowski I. Bell B. Broad P. Hollis M. Gene. 1992; 118: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Gal4-HDAC3 point mutants were constructed by using adapter oligonucleotides. GFP-HDAC1, GFP-HDAC2, and GFP-HDAC3 were constructed by inserting the HDAC1, HDAC2, or HDAC3 cDNA in-frame into the vector pEGFP-C3 (CLONTECH). HDAC3-GFP was made by inserting the HDAC3 cDNA in-frame into the pEGFP-N2 vector (CLONTECH), where the stop codon was eliminated by PCR. GFP-HDAC3 deletion mutants were made by digesting the HDAC3 cDNA with appropriate restriction enzymes and subsequently cloning the restriction fragments into pEGFP-C3. HA-hCRM1 was constructed by subcloning the human cDNA of CRM1 (37Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1724) Google Scholar) into a modified pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) vector, which contains an HA epitope. FLAG-HDAC1, FLAG-HDAC2, and FLAG-HDAC3 have been described previously (13Yang W.M. Yao Y.L. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. J. Biol.

Mammalian expression plasmid GST-HDAC3 was made by subcloning the human HDAC3 cDNA into the mammalian GST expression vector pCMV-GST (38Tsai R.Y. Reed R.R. BioTechniques. 1997; 23: 794-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Bacterial expression plasmids GST-HDAC3, GST-HDAC2, GST-HDAC8, and GST-NCoR-(1–293) have been described (13Yang W.M.

Human cDNAs for TAFII55 and TBP were subcloned into GST expression vectors pGSTag (40Yang W.M. Inouye C. Zeng Y. Bearss D. Seto E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12845-12850Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) and pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), respectively. HA-HDAC3 was made by subcloning the human HDAC3 cDNA into a modified pcDNA3.1 vector, described above. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis. Deacetylase activity was determined using hyperacetylated core histones purified from HeLa cells, as described (41Carmen A.A. Rundlett S.E. Grunstein M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15837-15844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), with incubation overnight at room temperature. HeLa and 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). For transfections, 5 μg of an effector plasmid and, in some cases, 5 μg of a Gal4 luciferase reporter plasmid were introduced into cells by calcium phosphate precipitation (42Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6463) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection for further analysis. Luciferase activity was determined using the dual-luciferase assay system (Promega). Anti-FLAG, anti-HA, and anti-Gal4 antibodies were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co., BAbCO, and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, respectively. Immunoprecipitations were performed under low stringency conditions, as described previously (16Laherty C.D. Yang W.M. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1997; 89: 349-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (835) Google Scholar), using whole cell extracts derived from HeLa or 293 cells transfected with different plasmids. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by electrophoresis using 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and membranes were probed with the indicated antibodies. In some experiments, deacetylase activity assays were performed using the immunoprecipitated products. 293 cells were grown on charged slides inside 100-mm tissue culture plates for 24 h and then transfected with 5 μg each of plasmids expressing various GFP fusion proteins. Two days later, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, rinsed again with phosphate-buffered saline, and dried. Coverslips were applied with one drop of anti-fade mounting medium with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenyl-indole (Vector) before analysis under a fluorescence microscope. GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (40Yang W.M. Inouye C. Zeng Y. Bearss D. Seto E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12845-12850Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar).35S-Labeled HDAC3 protein was prepared from pGEM7Zf-HDAC3 using T7 RNA polymerase and the coupled transcription-translation rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (Promega). Equal molar quantities of either GST or GST fusion proteins on glutathione-Sepharose beads were incubated with labeled proteins. Binding reactions, washing conditions, and analyses by electrophoresis followed by autoradiography were done exactly as described (40Yang W.M. Inouye C. Zeng Y. Bearss D. Seto E. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Each reaction was performed at room temperature in buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 200 mmNaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 20% glycerol. The reactions were terminated by addition of 100 mm glycine. A series of plasmids that express different portions of the HDAC3 protein fused to FLAG epitope tags were used to identify the domains on HDAC3 necessary for its histone deacetylase activity. Anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates prepared from lysates of transfected HeLa cells were used for histone deacetylase assays. As shown in Fig. 1(A and F), a full-length HDAC3 possesses histone deacetylase enzymatic activity, whereas a mutant that lacks the last 27 residues of HDAC3-(1–401) had a significantly lower activity. Further C-terminal deletions of HDAC3 reduced activity to background levels. These results suggest that the extreme C-terminal of HDAC3 is required for full deacetylase activity. In four independent experiments, all fusion proteins could be detected by Western blots using a monoclonal antibody specific for the FLAG epitope (Fig. 1 B), ruling out the possibility that the truncated fusion proteins failed to deacetylate histones, because they were unstable and failed to accumulate within transfected cells. We have previously shown that HDAC3 can repress transcription when bound upstream of a basal promoter (13Yang W.M. Yao Y.L. Sun J.M. Davie J.R. Seto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28001-28007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). To determine if the region of HDAC3 that is necessary for deacetylase enzymatic activity correlates with a domain responsible for repression, we prepared plasmids that express Gal4-HDAC3 fusion proteins. To assay for repression, HeLa cells were cotransfected with these plasmids and a luciferase reporter plasmid containing Gal4-DNA binding sites upstream of a minimal thymidine kinase promoter. Results from several independent experiments were averaged and are presented in Fig. 1 (C andF). Whereas full-length HDAC3 (pGal4-HDAC3-(1–428)) repressed transcription efficiently, 1–401 and all other C-terminal deletion mutants did not. The Gal4 fusion proteins were expressed and active as determined by Western blots and by deacetylase assays (Fig.1, D and E; data not shown). Thus, the portion of HDAC3 that is important for histone deacetylase enzymatic activity (consisting of at least amino acids 401–428) overlaps with the region that is critical for transcriptional repression. This correlation supports the view that histone deacetylation by HDAC3 is closely linked to transcriptional repression. To further analyze the contribution of the C-terminal of HDAC3 to repression and deacetylation, we prepared three HDAC3 point mutants with one to three amino acid substitutions in this critical area. As shown in Fig. 1 (C and D), although a deletion of residues 401–428 of HDAC3 severely compromised its transcriptional and enzymatic activities, the particular point mutations we made in this region did not result in similar effects. Unlike HDAC1 and HDAC2, which are located exclusively in the nucleus (44, 45; Fig.2 A), immunofluorescence studies using anti-HDAC3 antiserum revealed that HDAC3 is located in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of DT40 cells (31Takami Y. Nakayama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16191-16201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). A similar subcellular distribution was observed using an antibody against the FLAG epitope in COS cells transfected with an expression plasmid encoding FLAG-tagged HDAC3 (46McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Lu J. Olson E.N. Nature. 2000; 408: 106-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that the previous findings resulted from antibody cross-reactivity or an artifact generated by the FLAG epitope, we expressed HDAC3 fused to the green fluorescence protein (GFP) in 293 cells and determined the protein's localization by fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2(A and C), N-terminally GFP-fused HDAC3 (GFP-HDAC3) and C-terminally GFP-fused HDAC3 (HDAC3-GFP) were present both in the nucleus and cytoplasm of 293 cells, thus confirming previous findings.Figure 2Subcellular localization of HDAC3 and its interaction with CRM1.

In contrast, a C-terminal deletion mutant, GFP-HDAC3-(1–313), showed that the last 116 residues of HDAC3 are crucial for nuclear localization of the HDAC3 protein. This is confirmed by the observation that GFP-HDAC3-(180–313) is predominantly cytoplasmic and is consistent with the finding that 313–428 is sufficient to direct cytoplasmically located GFP into the nucleus. To determine if the cytoplasmic location of HDAC3 is due to an inhibition of nuclear import or the presence of a nuclear export mechanism, we transfected 293 cells with plasmids that express different GFP-HDAC3 fusion proteins and treated the cells with Leptomycin B (LMB), an inhibitor of the CRM1/exportin1-related export pathway (47Fukuda M.

As shown in Fig. 2 (A and C), LMB treatment caused GFP-HDAC3, HDAC3-GFP, GFP-HDAC3-(122–428), GFP-HDAC3-(180–428), GFP-HDAC3-(1–313), and GFP-HDAC3-(180–313) to redistribute entirely into the nucleus, indicating that, in addition to its nuclear localization sequences, HDAC3 contains an NES located in residues 180–313.

Immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody followed by immunoblotting with anti-HA revealed that hCRM1 coprecipitates with HDAC3 (Fig. 2 B, lane 1). The HDAC3-hCRM1 interaction is specific, because an unrelated protein, FKBP25, fused to FLAG, did not coprecipitate with hCRM1 (lane 9). Furthermore, fragments of HDAC3 that contain the putative NES (1–401, 1–373, 1–313, 122–428) coprecipitate with hCRM1 but not fragments that do not contain this sequence (1–265, 1–180, 1–122). A fragment of HDAC3 containing 180–313 alone specifically coprecipitates with hCRM1 (lane 10). Collectively, our data support the idea that the subcellular localization of HDAC3 is regulated at least in part by a CRM1/exportin 1-related export pathway. During our structure-function analysis of HDAC3, we consistently found that epitope-tagged HDAC3 coprecipitates with the cellular endogenous HDAC3 protein, suggesting that the protein very likely forms oligomers in vivo. Specifically, immunoprecipitates of an extract prepared from cells that express FLAG-HDAC3, but not extracts from cells that express FLAG-HDAC1 or FLAG-HDAC2, as detected by immunoblotting with an anti-HDAC3 antibody, contained two bands that correspond to the molecular masses of FLAG-HDAC3 and HDAC3 (Fig. 3 A, compare lane 1 with lanes 2 and 3). Similarly, GST-HDAC3 coprecipitates with FLAG-HDAC3 in cells that express both proteins (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 1and 3). The anti-FLAG antibody used in this experiment did not cross-react with GST-HDAC3 (lane 2). To confirm a physical self-association of HDAC3, we employed a GST affinity matrix to capture the HDAC3 protein. Bacterially expressed GST or GST fusion proteins were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads and incubated with 35S-labele"

The PI3K inhibitors Ly294002 and wortmannin reduced p21Cip1 protein abundance in human umbilical vein EC. However, mutation of the AKT site Thr-145 into aspartate (T145D) did not increase its protein half-life. We therefore investigated whether a kinase downstream of AKT regulates p21Cip1 protein levels. In various cell types, AKT phosphorylates and inhibits glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). Upon serum stimulation of EC, GSK-3β was phosphorylated at Ser-9. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed that GSK-3 in vitrophosphorylated p21Cip1 specifically at Thr-57 within the Cdk binding domain. Overexpression of GSK-3β decreased p21Cip1 protein levels in EC, whereas the specific inhibition of GSK-3 with lithium chloride interfered with p21Cip1 degradation and increased p21Cip1protein about 10-fold in EC and cardiac myocytes (30 mm,p < 0.001).

Thus, complex formation processes involving the C terminus of p21Cip1, which directly binds to the 20 S proteasome (6Touitou R. Richardson J. Bose S. Nakanishi M. Rivett J. Allday M.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2367-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), have been implicated in the regulation of p21Cip1 turnover, particularly via interaction with the DNA adapter protein, PCNA1 (7Cayrol C. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2437-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Because p21Cip1 is a phosphoprotein targeted for post-translational modification by various kinases, phosphorylation of p21Cip1 may regulate the interaction of p21Cip1with its binding partners and, thus, could also affect p21Cip1 stability. Importantly, phosphorylation of p21Cip1 at Ser-146 and at Thr-145 was shown to modulate the p21Cip1-PCNA complex formation in vitro (8Scott M.T. Morrice N. Ball K.L. J. Biol.

Liao Y. Xia W. Spohn B. Lee M.-H. Hung M.-C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar) as well as in native human endothelial cells (9Rössig L. Jadidi A.S.

Functionally, signaling via PI3K/AKT is involved in the regulation p21Cip1, because PI3K inhibitors prevent p21Cip1 accumulation in response to DNA damage in fibroblasts and leukemia cells (15Fukuchi K. Watanabe H. Tomoyasu S. Ichimura S. Tatsumi K. Gomi K. Biochim. Biophys.

However, it is unknown how AKT controls p21Cip1 protein levels. Therefore, we investigated the signaling pathways underlying the regulation of p21Cip1 protein turnover by PI3K/AKT-dependent signaling. We have identified p21Cip1 as a substrate for GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation, the inhibition of which stabilizes p21Cip1 protein. This interaction provides a novel post-translational regulatory element coupling AKT to p21Cip1.

Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (2992) Google Scholar). For experiments, cells were used at the third passage. Ly294002 was from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany), lactacystin was bought from Calbiochem, and wortmannin and cycloheximide were from Sigma. Following cell lysis, HUVEC homogenates were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, which were then incubated with antibodies against c-myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), actin (Sigma), phospho-GSK-3α/β (Ser-21/Ser-9) (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA), or p21 (BD Transduction Laboratories). The plasmid encoding human p21Cip1 was cloned by PCR into the pcDNA3.1-Myc-His vector (InVitrogen). To engineer various p21Cip1 constructs defective in potential acceptor sites for GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation, threonines and serines were changed by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) to alanines as indicated. The plasmid encoding bovine AKT was kindly donated by Dr. J. Downward and subcloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector as described (18Dimmeler S. Fisslthaler B. Fleming I. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (2992) Google Scholar). To engineer a constitutively active AKT construct (AKT S/T), Ser-473 and Thr-308 were changed to aspartic acid by site-directed mutagenesis. GSK-3β was cloned into the pcDNA3.1 vector. Clones with verified sequences were used to transfect HUVEC (3.5 × 105cells/6 cm well, 3 μg of plasmid DNA, 25 μl of Superfect) or COS-7 cells (3.8 × 105 cells/6 cm plate, 8 μg of plasmid DNA, 30 μl Superfect) as described previously (18Dimmeler S. Fisslthaler B. Fleming I. Hermann C. Busse R. Zeiher A.M. Nature. 1999; 399: 601-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (2992) Google Scholar). For detection of GSK-3 phosphorylation of p21Cip1 in vitro, COS-7 cells were transfected with myc-tagged p21Cip1 wild type or p21Cip1 constructs, and overexpressed p21Cip1-myc was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates (500 μg/sample) using antibodies against themyc tag. Then, p21Cip1 immunoprecipitates were incubated with recombinant GSK-3β (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 30 °C in 30 μl of a kinase reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 μm ATP, and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was terminated by the addition of SDS-sample dye, and samples were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by autoradiography. Similarly, myc-tagged and overexpressed p27Kip1 was immunoprecipitated and assayed for GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation. For quantification of cell proliferation rates, cells were incubated with 10 μmbromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) for 1 h, and incorporated BrdUrd was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). To distinguish between individual cell cycle phases, HUVEC were incubated with BrdUrd and subsequently stained with anti-BrdUrd fluorescent antibodies (BD PharMingen) as well as with the DNA dye 7-amino-actinomycin D according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then, flow cytometry of these cells was performed using a FACSCalibur cell sorter (Becton Dickinson). Data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. from at least three independent experiments. Two treatment groups were compared by the independent samples t test and three or more groups by one-way analysis-of-variance followed by post hocanalysis adjusted with an LSD correction for multiple comparisons (SPSS). p21Cip1 stabilization upon DNA damage depends on the activity of the PI3K (15Fukuchi K. Watanabe H. Tomoyasu S. Ichimura S. Tatsumi K. Gomi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Likewise, in human EC, the PI3K inhibitor Ly294002 time-dependently decreased p21Cip1 protein levels (Fig.1 A). Similar results were obtained with another inhibitor of PI3K, wortmannin (data not shown). Coincubation with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin completely prevented the PI3K inhibitor-induced decrease in p21Cip1protein (Fig. 1 A), suggesting that the down-regulation of p21Cip1 following PI3K inhibition involved proteasomal degradation processes. Because we and others have recently demonstrated that AKT phosphorylates p21Cip1 in native EC (9Rössig L. Jadidi A.S. Urbich C. Badorff C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5644-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar) as well as in an HER-2/neu-overexpressing cell line (14Zhou B.-P. Liao Y. Xia W. Spohn B. Lee M.-H. Hung M.-C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the phosphorylation of p21Cip1 by AKT regulates p21Cip1 protein half-life following inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide (CHX). Under serum-containing conditions, the protein half-life of the AKT-phosphomimetic p21Cip1 construct, in which Thr-145 was changed to Asp (T145D), was not increased compared with p21Cip1 wild type (Fig. 1, B and C). These data suggest that direct phosphorylation by AKT at Thr-145 does not account for the PI3K-dependent p21Cip1 protein stabilization. Therefore, we hypothesized that signaling events downstream of AKT might mediate the observed effect of PI3K inhibition on p21Cip1 protein levels. In various cell types, AKT phosphorylates and inhibits the kinase activity of GSK-3 (11Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4288) Google Scholar), which regulates the proteasomal degradation of cyclin D (13Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar). To explore whether GSK-3 could also be involved in the regulation of p21Cip1 protein expression, we investigated whether GSK-3 phosphorylates p21Cip1. Recombinant GSK-3β induced p21Cip1 phosphorylation in vitro (Fig.2 A). Mutagenesis of the AKT-phospho-acceptor site, Thr-145, had a minor effect on GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation (Fig. 2 A). Likewise, p21Cip1 phosphorylation by GSK-3 was unchanged by replacement of the reported phospho-acceptor site for PKC-dependent phosphorylation, Ser-146 (8Scott M.T. Morrice N. Ball K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11529-11537Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 A), indicating that an amino acid different from the already described phosphorylation sites of p21Cip1 serves as acceptor site for GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation. To identify the specific site for GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation, we further analyzed the GSK-3 kinase activity toward two constructs of p21Cip1in which the two potential sites for GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation within the p21Cip1 amino acid sequence matching the reported GSK-3 consensus sequence, (S/T)XXX P(S/T),i.e. Ser-114 and Ser-27, were mutated to alanine (underlined characters indicate the actual acceptor amino acids for phosphorylation). As shown in Fig. 2 B, GSK-3 equally phosphorylated these constructs when compared with p21Cip1wild type, excluding Ser-114 and Ser-27 as the p21Cip1acceptor site for GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation. Therefore, we took a systematic approach to find the specific GSK-3 phosphorylation site and engineered a C-terminally truncated p21Cip1 construct consisting of amino acids 1–109 only, which was still phosphorylated by recombinant GSK-3 (data not shown), indicating an N-terminal site for GSK-3 phosphorylation. We then systematically changed the remaining N-terminal 10 serines and threonines to alanine and found that only the mutation of Thr-57 to Ala resulted in a complete lack of phosphorylation by GSK-3 (Fig. 2,B and C). We conclude, therefore, that GSK-3 specifically phosphorylates p21Cip1 at Thr-57. Because the N-terminal sequence of p21Cip1 shares a great homology with p27Kip1, we tested whether GSK-3 also phosphorylates amyc-tagged p27Kip1 construct. However, as shown in Fig. 2 C, GSK-3 selectively phosphorylates p21Cip1 but not p27Kip1. Next, we investigated whether GSK-3 is subject to phosphorylation in EC exposed to stimuli that are known to activate AKT. Cells were starved in a growth factor-depleted medium, which time-dependently reduced GSK-3α and-β phosphorylation at Ser-21 and Ser-9, respectively (data not shown). Serum readmission induced a marked increase in both phosphorylated GSK-3α and β isoforms (Fig. 3 A), which was completely suppressed in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor Ly294002 (Fig. 3 A). Thus, serum stimulation of EC induces the PI3K-dependent phosphorylation of GSK-3. We then explored whether GSK-3 is involved in the regulation of p21Cip1protein expression in EC. Overexpression of GSK-3β wild type decreased p21Cip1 protein expression (Fig. 3, Band C). Likewise, transfection of the GSK-3β S9A construct, which cannot be phosphorylated at the phospho-acceptor site for AKT-dependent phosphorylation, Ser-9, and thus cannot be inhibited by AKT-coupled signaling, significantly suppressed endogenous p21Cip1 protein levels in EC (Fig.3 B). These data suggest that GSK-3 regulates p21Cip1 protein expression downstream of PI3K/AKT in EC. To investigate whether phosphorylation by GSK-3 mediates the GSK-3-dependent regulation of p21Cip1, we determined the effect of the specific GSK-3 inhibitor, lithium chloride (LiCl) (19Stambolic V. Ruel L. Woodgett J.R. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1664-1668Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Klein P.S. Melton D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8455-8459Crossref PubMed Scopus (2055) Google Scholar), on p21Cip1protein expression. LiCl (1–30 mm) led to a dose- and time-dependent increase in endogenous p21Cip1protein levels in EC (Fig. 4,A–D). This finding indicates that interference with GSK-3 activity in EC increases p21Cip1 protein expression. A similar increase in p21Cip1 protein levels occurred following LiCl treatment of freshly isolated rat cardiomyocytes, whereas p21Cip1 protein remained unchanged following LiCl treatment of SV40-transformed COS-7 cells (Fig. 4 E). Because p21Cip1 is a target for direct phosphorylation by GSK-3, we determined whether the observed increase in p21Cip1resulted from a post-translational effect on p21Cip1protein stability when protein synthesis was blocked by the addition of CHX. LiCl treatment significantly increased protein stability rate of p21Cip1 in EC (Fig. 5,A and B). Likewise, LiCl also stabilized p21Cip1 degradation in the presence of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D (Fig. 5 C), suggesting that the observed effect of LiCl on p21Cip1 protein levels is mainly due to the post-transcriptional stabilization of p21Cip1. Importantly, LiCl treatment also increased the stability of the AKT-phosphomimetic p21Cip1 T145D construct (Fig.5 D). To determine the contribution of GSK-3-dependent Thr-57 phosphorylation to the regulation of p21Cip1 degradation, we overexpressed the p21Cip1 T57A construct in HUVEC. As shown in Fig.5 E, interference with Thr-57 phosphorylation significantly reduced p21Cip1 degradation following 1.5 and 3 h of cycloheximide treatment (p < 0.01). Thus, GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation regulates p21Cip1post-transcriptionally at the level of protein stabilization.Figure 5Stabilization of p21Cip1 protein by lithium chloride.

The increase in p21Cip1 protein following LiCl treatment at concentrations of 3 or 10 mmLiCl was not associated with a marked decrease in proliferation rates as assessed by BrdUrd incorporation as well as by flow cytometry (Fig.6, A and B). However, 30 mm LiCl arrested EC specifically in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (Fig. 6, A andB). Overexpression of constitutively active AKT completely reversed the cell cycle inhibitory activity of LiCl even at a concentration of 30 mm (Fig. 6 C), confirming previous data on the modulation of the cell cycle regulatory properties of p21Cip1 by AKT-dependent phosphorylation (9Rössig L. Jadidi A.S. Urbich C. Badorff C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5644-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Morphological analysis by phase contrast microscopy revealed a hypertrophic appearance of the cells following an 18-h incubation with LiCl (30 mm, not shown). Herein we have investigated the regulation of p21Cip1by PI3K/AKT-dependent signaling in EC. Pharmacological inhibition of PI3K reduces p21Cip1 protein levels, confirming previously published data from human leukemia and mouse primary embryo fibroblasts (15Fukuchi K. Watanabe H. Tomoyasu S. Ichimura S. Tatsumi K. Gomi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21Collado M. Medema R.H. Garcia-Cao I. Dubuisson M.L. Barradas M. Glassford J. Rivas C. Burgering B.M. Serrano M. Lam E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21960-21968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, direct phosphorylation of p21Cip1 by AKT, which is known to abrogate p21Cip1 binding to PCNA, did not significantly affect protein degradation. In contrast, phosphorylation by GSK-3, which undergoes PI3K-dependent inhibitory phosphorylation in response to serum stimulation, regulates protein turnover of p21Cip1 because 1) pharmacological inhibition of GSK-3 dramatically increases p21Cip1 protein half-life, and 2) phospho-negative mutagenesis of the GSK-3 phosphorylation site Thr-57 interferes with p21Cip1 degradation. The GSK-3 phosphorylation site, Thr-57, does not match the reported consensus motif for GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation characterized by a priming phosphorylation at amino acid +4 upstream of the GSK-3-phosphorylated acceptor site. This finding is consistent with previous reports describing GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation of target substrates at regions different from the (S/T)XXX P(S/T) motif (13Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar, 22Boyle W.J. Smeal T. Defize L.H. Angel P. Woodgett J.R. Karin M. Hunter T. Cell. 1991; 64: 573-584Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Roach (see Ref. 23Roach P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14139-14142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar for review) has proposed previously that any phosphorylated amino acid may in dependence on the tertiary protein structure sterically relate to a potential phospho-acceptor site to enhance its affinity toward phosphorylation by GSK-3. Others have reported that GSK-3 may, in addition to this so-called “priming substrate concept,” also act as a proline-directed kinase. Therefore, although our data do not exclude an initial phosphorylation anywhere at the molecule by another kinase, proline at position 58 of the p21Cip1 amino acid sequence neighboring Thr-57 suggests that GSK-3 could indeed act on p21Cip1 as a proline-directed kinase rather than via “processive” phosphorylation. Because GSK-3 is phylogenetically closely related to the cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) and the herein reported GSK-3 phosphorylation site, Thr-57, is located within the Cdk-binding region of p21Cip1, one might also speculate that a potential interaction between p21Cip1 and GSK-3 could facilitate GSK-3 phosphorylation of p21Cip1. Such a mechanism has previously been reported to underlie the phosphorylation of axin and β-catenin by GSK-3 (24Ikeda S. Kishida S. Yamamoto H. Murai H. Koyama S. Kikuchi A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1371-1384Crossref PubMed Scopus (1087) Google Scholar). Currently, experiments are being carried out to characterize the molecular interaction between p21Cip1 and GSK-3 more in detail. Interestingly, the GSK-3 phosphorylation site, Thr-57, is highly conserved among various mammalian species. However, although the N-terminal domains of p21Cip1 and p27Kip1 share close homology, Thr-57 is not present in p27Kip1, suggesting that the post-translational interaction of p21Cip1 with GSK-3 could contribute to the functional diversity of both cell cycle regulatory proteins. The GSK-3 phosphorylation site, Thr-57, is located in the Cdk binding region of p21Cip1. Cayrol and Ducommun (7Cayrol C. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2437-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) have previously reported that a p21Cip1 construct defective in Cdk binding is characterized functionally by an increased half-life because of a reduced sensitivity toward proteasome-mediated hydrolysis. Indeed, co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate decreased Cdk4 binding by the p21Cip1 T57A construct, 2L. Rössig, unpublished results. suggesting a potential mechanism that could underlie the stabilization of p21Cip1 toward proteasomal degradation following GSK-3 inhibition. In addition, protein-protein interactions involving the C terminus of p21Cip1 were previously suggested to regulate its proteasomal turnover rate (6Touitou R. Richardson J. Bose S. Nakanishi M. Rivett J. Allday M.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2367-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). In particular, a p21Cip1construct defective in PCNA binding (M147A) was shown to undergo accelerated turnover compared with native p21Cip1 (6Touitou R. Richardson J. Bose S. Nakanishi M. Rivett J. Allday M.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2367-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 7Cayrol C. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2437-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our finding that AKT-phosphomimetic mutation (p21Cip1 T145D), which results in PCNA release from complex formation with p21Cip1 (9Rössig L. Jadidi A.S. Urbich C. Badorff C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5644-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), did not increase p21Cip1 half-life compared with overexpressed wild type. Only recently, the capability of p21Cip1 to bind with its C terminus to the C8 interaction domain of the 20 S proteasome has been shown to be of major relevance for the regulation of p21Cip1 protein degradation, proving that mechanisms beyond PCNA binding are dominant over the stabilizing influence of PCNA on p21Cip1 half-life (6Touitou R. Richardson J. Bose S. Nakanishi M. Rivett J. Allday M.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 2367-2375Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Although we show that GSK-3 directly phosphorylates p21Cip1 at its N-terminal domain, this post-translational modification could also sterically influence the C terminus and thus trigger p21Cip1 degradation via modulation of the interaction of p21Cip1 with the proteasome. Thereby, a concept of phosphorylation-dependent regulation of p21Cip1 turnover resembles the mechanism by which GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation triggers both nuclear exit and subsequently the ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of another regulator of G1 cell cycle progression, cyclin D (13Diehl J.A. Cheng M. Roussel M.F. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3499-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (1837) Google Scholar, 25Alt J.R. Cleveland J.L. Hannink M. Diehl J.A. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3102-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). While preparing this manuscript, Mao et al. (26Mao C.D. Hoang P. DiCorleto P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26180-26188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) published that LiCl stabilized p53 and thereby transcriptionally increased p21Cip1 mRNA and protein in endothelial cells. In contrast, another study (27Chen R.W. Chuang D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6039-6042Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar) reported that p53 mRNA expression is down-regulated following long-term treatment with LiCl. Our data clearly demonstrate that LiCl up-regulates p21Cip1 protein expression in the presence of the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D as well as when protein translation was inhibited by CHX. Moreover, LiCl also increased the levels of transfected p21Cip1, suggesting that LiCl can regulate p21Cip1 independently of p53. Further investigations are warranted to explore the detailed molecular mechanisms coupling GSK-3-dependent phosphorylation at Thr-57 to the regulation of p21Cip1protein stability. Recent findings have linked AKT signaling to the regulation of p21Cip1. 1) PI3K post-transcriptionally regulates p21Cip1 accumulation in response to DNA damage (15Fukuchi K. Watanabe H. Tomoyasu S. Ichimura S. Tatsumi K. Gomi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1496: 207-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). 2) p21Cip1 is required for the induction of smooth muscle cell proliferation in response to the AKT-coupled platelet-derived growth factor (28Weiss R.H. Joo A. Randour C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10285-10290Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). 3) Overexpression of AKT induces p21Cip1 in muscle cells (16Lawlor M.A. Rotwein P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 17Lawlor M.A. Rotwein P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8983-8995Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). 4) AKT directly phosphorylates p21Cip1 in HER-2/neu-overexpressing (14Zhou B.-P. Liao Y. Xia W. Spohn B. Lee M.-H. Hung M.-C. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar) as well as in native human endothelial cells (9Rössig L. Jadidi A.S. Urbich C. Badorff C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5644-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), and 5) AKT phosphorylation regulates p21Cip1 binding to PCNA (9Rössig L. Jadidi A.S. Urbich C. Badorff C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5644-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Here, we show that AKT-coupled activation regulates p21Cip1 protein half-life as a summary effect. Via phosphorylation and thus inhibition of GSK-3, AKT indirectly interferes with the degradation-triggering p21Cip1 phosphorylation by GSK-3, which may compensate for and even prevail over the destabilizing effect of PCNA release (7Cayrol C. Ducommun B. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2437-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) associated with the direct phosphorylation of p21Cip1by AKT in vivo (9Rössig L. Jadidi A.S. Urbich C. Badorff C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5644-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). But what is the physiological effect of p21Cip1 protein up-regulation in response to AKT? We have recently provided evidence that direct phosphorylation of p21Cip1 at Thr-145 by AKT modulates the cell cycle regulatory properties of p21Cip1 as Thr-145-phosphomimetic p21Cip1 does not any longer bind to PCNA, less readily engages in the inhibitory complex formation with Cdk2, and importantly, promotes the activating assembly of Cdk4 with cyclin D that leads to exit of the cell cycle out of G0 (9Rössig L. Jadidi A.S. Urbich C. Badorff C. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5644-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Thus, AKT activation modifies p21Cip1 function to cooperate with cyclin D, which AKT also up-regulates, to allow for G1 progression. Taking into account the function of p21Cip1 in DNA repair and genome stability, by ensuring sufficient amounts of p21Cip1, cell cycle progression under AKT control might represent a safe-guarded mode of proliferation compared with p21Cip1-deficient proliferating cells, which are prone to apoptosis (29Stivala L.A. Riva F. Cazzalini O. Savio M. Prosperi E. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Preliminary data indeed suggest that AKT-dependent phosphorylation of p21Cip1 also regulates the accessibility of Dnmt1 for DNA.2 In summary, our data show that under resting conditions, endogenous GSK-3β kinase activity reduces p21Cip1 levels by phosphorylation-dependent degradation of p21Cip1. Inhibition of GSK-3 upon PI3K/AKT activation abrogates GSK3-mediated p21Cip1 phosphorylation at Thr-57 and increases p21Cip1 half-life, providing a novel post-translational interaction coupling AKT to p21Cip1. We are grateful to Rebeca Salguero Palacios, Christiane Mildner-Rihm, and Susanne Ficus for expert technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2160364430,"Serine/threonine kinase Akt is thought to mediate many biological actions toward anti-apoptotic responses. Screening of drugs that could interfere with the Akt signaling pathway revealed that Hsp90 inhibitors (e.g. geldanamycin, radicicol, and its analogues) induced Akt dephosphorylation, which resulted in Akt inactivation and apoptosis of the cells. Hsp90 inhibitors did not directly affect Akt kinase activity in vitro. Thus, we examined the effects of Hsp90 inhibitors on upstream Akt kinases, phosphatidylinositide-3-OH kinase (PI3K) and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1). Hsp90 inhibitors had no effect on PI3K protein expression. In contrast, treatment of the cells with Hsp90 inhibitors decreased the amount of PDK1 without directly inhibiting PDK1 kinase activity. We found that the kinase domain of PDK1 was essential for complex formation with Hsp90 and that Hsp90 inhibitors suppressed PDK1 binding to Hsp90. PDK1 degradation mechanisms revealed that inhibition of PDK1 binding to Hsp90 caused proteasome-dependent degradation of PDK1. Treatment of proteasome inhibitors increased the amount of detergent-insoluble PDK1 in Hsp90 inhibitor-treated cells. Therefore, the association of PDK1 with Hsp90 regulates its stability, solubility, and signaling. Because Akt binding to Hsp90 is also involved in the maintenance of Akt kinase activity, Hsp90 plays an important role in PDK1-Akt survival signaling pathway. Serine/threonine kinase Akt is thought to mediate many biological actions toward anti-apoptotic responses. Screening of drugs that could interfere with the Akt signaling pathway revealed that Hsp90 inhibitors (e.g. geldanamycin, radicicol, and its analogues) induced Akt dephosphorylation, which resulted in Akt inactivation and apoptosis of the cells. Hsp90 inhibitors did not directly affect Akt kinase activity in vitro. Thus, we examined the effects of Hsp90 inhibitors on upstream Akt kinases, phosphatidylinositide-3-OH kinase (PI3K) and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1). Hsp90 inhibitors had no effect on PI3K protein expression. In contrast, treatment of the cells with Hsp90 inhibitors decreased the amount of PDK1 without directly inhibiting PDK1 kinase activity. We found that the kinase domain of PDK1 was essential for complex formation with Hsp90 and that Hsp90 inhibitors suppressed PDK1 binding to Hsp90. PDK1 degradation mechanisms revealed that inhibition of PDK1 binding to Hsp90 caused proteasome-dependent degradation of PDK1. Treatment of proteasome inhibitors increased the amount of detergent-insoluble PDK1 in Hsp90 inhibitor-treated cells. Therefore, the association of PDK1 with Hsp90 regulates its stability, solubility, and signaling. Because Akt binding to Hsp90 is also involved in the maintenance of Akt kinase activity, Hsp90 plays an important role in PDK1-Akt survival signaling pathway. phosphatidylinositide-3-OH kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3 poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinases pleckstrin homology benzyloxycarbonyl-Asp-CH2OCO-2,6-dichlorobenzene benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-CH2OCO-2,6-dichlorobenzene heat-shock protein 90 benzyloxycarbonyl-Ile-Glu(OBut)-Ala-Leu-aldehyde N-α-tosyl-l-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone N-α-tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium phosphate-buffered saline cytomegalovirus hemagglutinin monoclonal antibody mitogen-activated protein kinase 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid acetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamyl-l-valyl-l-aspart-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin protein kinase A, G and C c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase stress-activated protein kinase benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Leu-aldehyde The characterization of the survival signal transduction pathways stimulated by growth factors and cytokines has revealed that phosphatidylinositide-3-OH kinase (PI3K)1 is involved in the pathway (1Scheid M.P.

PI3K is a heterodimeric lipid kinase, which consists of an 85-kDa regulatory subunit and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit. After stimulation with growth factors and cytokines, PI3K is activated by the interaction of the 85-kDa subunit with phosphotyrosines of activated intracellular domain of growth factor receptors or with the receptor-associated adapter proteins. Subsequently, PI3K associates with the plasma membrane where the 110-kDa catalytic subunit phosphorylates phosphoinositides. The generated phospholipid second messenger molecule, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), raises a diverse set of cellular responses (4Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J.

Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). The major targets of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 are pleckstrin homology (PH) domain-containing proteins, including serine/threonine kinase Akt (also known as protein kinase B (PKB) or RAC-PK) (7Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar, 8Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). The interaction of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 with the PH domain of Akt recruits Akt to the plasma membrane, where it is phosphorylated at two key regulatory residue sites, Thr308 and Ser473. Phosphorylation at both residues is necessary for full activation of Akt and the subsequent regulation of many PI3K-regulated biological responses, including glucose uptake, protein synthesis, and apoptosis inhibition (7Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar, 8Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 is catalyzed by the ubiquitously expressed 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) (9Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P. Holmes A.B. Gaffney R.P.J.

(12Balendran A. Casamayor A. Deak M. Paterson A. Gaffney P. Currie R. Downes C.P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 393-404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) reported that interaction of the fragment of protein kinase C-related kinase-2 with PDK1 converted PDK1 from a kinase that could phosphorylate only the Thr308 residue of Akt to one that could phosphorylate both Thr308 and Ser473residues. Akt itself was reported to be associated with the Akt phosphorylation at the Ser473 residue (13Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). The 90-kDa heat-shock protein (Hsp90) was highly conserved and played an important role in refolding certain denatured proteins under stress conditions. Unlike the more general Hsp70 and Hsp60 chaperones, Hsp90 appeared to have substrate-specific folding activity. Hsp90 has an additional role in the conformational regulation of certain signal transduction molecules, such as steroid hormone receptors and some kinases. Recent reports, including ours, indicated that Hsp90 is involved in the inhibition of apoptosis by suppressing cytochromec-mediated oligomerization of Apaf-1 (14Pandey P. Saleh A. Nakazawa A. Kumar S. Srinivasula S.M. Kumar V. Weichselbaum R. Nalin C. Alnemri E.S. Kufe D. Kharbanda S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4310-4322Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar) or by stabilizing Akt kinase activity (15Sato S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10832-10837Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). These data suggest that Hsp90 plays an important role in cell survival. This notion was supported by the facts that Hsp90 inhibitors could induce apoptosis in various types of cell lines (reviewed in Refs. 16Neckers L. Mimnaugh E. Schulte T.W. Drug Resist. Updates. 1999; 2: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar and 17Neckers L. Schulte T.W. Mimnaugh E. Invest. New Drugs. 1999; 17: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). We thus investigated whether Hsp90 inhibitors (i.e.geldanamycin, radicicol, and oxime derivatives of radicicol) possess the ability to modulate the Akt signaling pathway. We found that Hsp90 inhibitors induced Akt dephosphorylation and inactivation in vivo, although they had no direct effects on Akt kinase activityin vitro. Recent reports also documented the down-regulation of phospho-Akt level and Akt signaling by Hsp90 inhibitors (18Hostein I. Robertson D. DiStefano F. Workman P. Clarke P.A. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 4003-4009PubMed Google Scholar, 19Nimmanapalli R. O'Bryan E. Bhalla K. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1799-1804PubMed Google Scholar). We then examined the effects of Hsp90 inhibitors on the upstream Akt kinases, PDK1 and PI3K, and found that they down-regulated the expression level of PDK1 but did not affect the amount of PI3K. Hsp90 inhibitors had no direct effects on PDK1 kinase activity in vitro. Because binding to Hsp90 has been shown to prevent some signaling proteins from self-association or becoming insoluble (16Neckers L. Mimnaugh E. Schulte T.W. Drug Resist. Updates. 1999; 2: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,17Neckers L. Schulte T.W. Mimnaugh E. Invest. New Drugs. 1999; 17: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), we investigated the binding capability of PDK1 to Hsp90. We found that PDK1 bound to Hsp90 via its kinase domain and that Hsp90 inhibitors suppressed the binding. Inhibition of PDK1 binding to Hsp90 led to the proteasome-dependent degradation of PDK1. Therefore, we concluded that Hsp90 is involved in the signaling and stability of PDK1. Radicicol, oxime derivatives of radicicol (KF25706 and KF58333), and UCN-01 were kindly provided by Kyowa Hakko Kogyo (Tokyo, Japan). Geldanamycin and LY294002 were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.

The recombinant human active PDK1, active Akt1, and inactive SGK proteins were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Human embryonic kidney 293T, human fibrosarcoma HT1080, and African green monkey kidney COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Nissui, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Mouse colon adenocarcinoma NL-17 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Human prostate cancer PC-3 cells were cultured in Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 7% FBS. Human wild-type akt1 cDNA (WT-Akt) in a pFLAG-CMV-2 vector was established previously in our laboratory (20Rokudai S. Fujita N. Hashimoto Y. Tsuruo T. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 182: 290-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The active form of akt cDNA, E40K-akt, was generated by converting Glu40 codon to Lys codon in WT-akt cDNA using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (21Nakashio A. Fujita N. Rokudai S. Sato S. Tsuruo T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5303-5309PubMed Google Scholar). The Myc- and (His)6-epitope-tagged NH2-terminal myristoylated active mouse akt1 cDNA (myr-Akt) in a pUSEamp vector was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. The Myc-tagged human wild-type PDK1 cDNA (WT-PDK1) in a pCMV3 vector was kindly provided by Drs. P. Hawkins and K. Anderson (The Babraham Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom) (22Anderson K.E. Coadwell J. Stephens L.R. Hawkins P.T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 684-691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). Several PDK1 fragments that encompassed residues 1–556 (WT-PDK1), 52–556 (ΔN51-PDK1), 156–556 (ΔN155-PDK1), and 224–556 (ΔN223-PDK1) were generated by PCR with WT-PDK1 cDNA as the template or by reverse transcription-PCR with 293T mRNA as the template and then subcloned into pFLAG-CMV-2 vector.

Thelen (Istituto di Ricerca in Biomedicina, Switzerland) (23Didichenko S.A. Tilton B. Hemmings B.A. Ballmer-Hofer K. Thelen M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1271-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The V5- and (His)6-epitope-tagged human wild-typehsp90β cDNA (WT-hsp90) in a pcDNA3.1/GS vector was purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA) (15Sato S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10832-10837Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). All the plasmid DNAs for transfection were purified using a Qiagen plasmid Maxi kit, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Cells were transfected with appropriate plasmids using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturers' instructions. For immunoprecipitation, cells were harvested and solubilized in lysis buffer for immunoprecipitation (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1.5 mm magnesium chloride, 137 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 12 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm aprotinin). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 30 min. Then the supernatants were incubated with agarose conjugated with an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) (anti-FLAG M2-agarose, Sigma), agarose conjugated with an anti-Myc mAb (clone 9E10) (anti-Myc agarose, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), agarose conjugated with an anti-HA mAb (clone F-7) (anti-HA-agarose, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or protein G-agarose that had been conjugated with control sheep IgG (Upstate Biotechnology) or sheep anti-PDK1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitated proteins were subjected to kinase assays or electrophoresed in a 4–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel. The electrophoresed proteins were transblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking, the membrane was subjected to Western blot analysis, as described below. Western blot analysis was performed, as described previously with a slight modification (15Sato S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10832-10837Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar, 21Nakashio A. Fujita N. Rokudai S. Sato S. Tsuruo T. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 5303-5309PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, cells were solubilized with lysis buffer for Western blot (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5% Triton X-100, 3 mm EGTA, 12 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 150 mm sodium chloride, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm aprotinin, and 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol). The cell lysates were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were electrophoresed and transblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane. In some experiments, the supernatants were recovered as soluble fractions, and the precipitates were solubilized by directly adding the diluted SDS sample buffer to obtain insoluble fractions (24Miyata Y. Ikawa Y. Shibuya M. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21841-21848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). After blocking, the membranes were incubated with one of the following: antibodies to phospho-Akt (Thr308), PI3K p85 subunit, or GSK3 (Upstate Biotechnology); antibodies to Akt, phospho-Akt (Ser473), 89-kDa cleaved fragment of PARP, or phospho-GSK3β (Ser9) (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA); an antibody to phospho-MAPK (Promega, Madison, WI); an antibody to PARP (PharMingen, San Diego, CA); antibodies to PDK1 or c-Raf-1 (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY); antibodies to MAPK, Myc tag, or HA tag (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); an antibody to Hsp90 (Stressgen, Victoria, Canada); an antibody to V5 tag (Invitrogen); or an antibody to FLAG tag (Sigma). Blots were scanned with an Epson ES-2200 scanner supported by Adobe Photoshop 5.5 and quantified with IMAGE 1.62 software (National Institutes of Health). HT1080 cells were transfected with a pFLAG-CMV-2 vector containing WT-akt cDNA and were cultured for 24 h in medium containing inhibitors. Akt kinase activity of the immunoprecipitated FLAG-tagged Akt was estimated with GSK3 peptide (RPRAATF) as a substrate using an Akt kinase assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology). In some experiments, recombinant human active Akt (Upstate Biotechnology) was incubated with inhibitors for 30 min at 30 °C and was then subjected to Akt kinase assay. We measured PDK1 kinase activity using an assay kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Upstate Biotechnology). Briefly, recombinant human active PDK1 (Upstate Biotechnology) protein was first incubated with inhibitors for 30 min at 30 °C, following incubation with inactive SGK for 30 min at 30 °C. Then the PDK1-dependent SGK kinase activity was estimated by incubating the reaction with GSK3 peptide as a substrate for 10 min at 30 °C in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. To examine the direct effects of Hsp90 inhibitors on PI3K activity, we transfected pcDNA3-p110αCAAX and pcDNA3-p110αCAAX-KD into 293T cells. Then HA-tagged p110α-CAAX or p110α-CAAX-KD protein was immunoprecipitated with agarose conjugated with anti-HA-agarose following incubation with Hsp90 inhibitors or LY294002 for 30 min at 30 °C. Next, the immunoprecipitated PI3K was subjected to PI3K assay in the presence of these drugs, as described previously (23Didichenko S.A. Tilton B. Hemmings B.A. Ballmer-Hofer K. Thelen M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1271-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). 293T cells were transiently transfected with pCMV3-PDK1 plasmid, as described above. After 24 h of incubation, the culture medium was replaced with methionine/cysteine-free DMEM (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) containing 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, and cells were incubated with or without 1 μm KF58333 for 2 h. Then cells were labeled with [35S]methionine/[35S]cysteine in fresh methionine/cysteine-free DMEM with or without 1 μm KF58333 for an additional 2 h. Radioactive medium was removed, and cells were further incubated in nonradioactive, complete medium for various times indicated before lysis. Exposure to KF58333 was maintained in the treated culture. The amount of radiolabeled PDK1 was determined by immunoprecipitation with anti-Myc agarose and SDS-PAGE. The relative amounts of incorporated radioactivity were visualized and quantified with a BAS1500 Bio-Imaging analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). The caspase activity in the cell lysates was measured, as described previously (15Sato S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10832-10837Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were harvested and lysed with lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, and 5 mmdithiothreitol). The cell lysate (5 μg) was then incubated with 20 μmacetyl-l-aspartyl-l-glutamyl-l-valyl-l-aspart-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (DEVD-AMC) (Peptide Institute) in ICE buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 10% glycerol, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) for 1 h at 37 °C. The aminomethylcoumarin released from the fluorogenic substrates was excited at 380 nm, and the emission was measured at 460 nm using an Hitachi fluorescence spectrophotometer, model F-2000 (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). We have recently identified that Akt is associated with Hsp90 (15Sato S. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10832-10837Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar). To clarify the role of Hsp90 on apoptosis and Akt survival signaling pathway, we examined the effects of several inhibitors of Hsp90. We used benzoquinone ansamycin geldanamycin (16Neckers L. Mimnaugh E. Schulte T.W. Drug Resist. Updates. 1999; 2: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 17Neckers L. Schulte T.W. Mimnaugh E. Invest. New Drugs. 1999; 17: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), antifungal antibiotic radicicol (25Schulte T.W. Akinaga S. Soga S. Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Toft D. Neckers L.M. Cell Stress Chaperones. 1998; 3: 100-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar), and analogues of radicicol, KF25706 and KF58333 (26Soga S. Neckers L.M. Schulte T.W. Shiotsu Y. Akasaka K. Narumi H. Agatsuma T. Ikuina Y. Murakata C. Tamaoki T. Akinaga S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2931-2938PubMed Google Scholar, 27Shiotsu Y. Neckers L.M. Wortman I. An W.G. Schulte T.W. Soga S. Murakata C. Tamaoki T. Akinaga S. Blood. 2000; 96: 2284-2291Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), as Hsp90 inhibitors. When 293T cells were treated with Hsp90 inhibitors, 293T cells underwent apoptosis with nuclear fragmentation (data not shown). The caspase family of aspartate-specific cysteine proteases has been demonstrated to be critical mediators in the cell death pathway (28Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 299-306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2181) Google Scholar). Among the members of the caspase family, caspase-3/CPP32/Yama/Apopain is a common and important effector of the apoptotic process. To clarify the activation of caspase-3 in vivo, we performed Western blot analysis using antibodies specifically recognizing the p85 cleaved fragment of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). PARP was one of the substrates of caspase-3 and produced the 85-kDa fragment after caspase-3-mediated cleavage (29Nicholson D.W. Ali A. Thornberry N.A. Vaillancourt J.P. Ding C.K. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Griffin P.R. Labelle M. Lazebnik Y.A. Munday N.A. Raju S.M. Smulson M.E. Yamin T.-T. Yu V.L. Miller D.K. Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3796) Google Scholar, 30Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2277) Google Scholar). Treatment of 293T cells with 10 μmgeldanamycin or 1 μm radicicol, KF25706, or KF58333 for 24-h increased the amount of cleaved fragment of PARP (Fig.1 A), indicating that caspase-3 is activated in vivo in 293T cells after inhibition of Hsp90 function. We further examined the activity of caspase-3 (-like) proteases in the KF58333-treated human HT1080 cells using fluorogenic-labeled tetrapeptide DEVD-AMC. KF58333 promoted the activation of caspase-3 (-like) proteases in HT1080 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). The PARP cleavage in HT1080 cells was also induced by KF58333 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). Activation was suppressed by adding caspase inhibitors Z-Asp and Z-VAD (data not shown). These results indicate that inhibition of Hsp90 can initiate the cells to undergo apoptosis. Hsp90 inhibitors were known to suppress MAPK signaling pathway by down-regulation of Raf-1 protein expression (31Schulte T.W. Blagosklonny M.V. Romanova L. Mushinski J.F. Monia B.P. Johnston J.F. Nguyen P. Trepel J. Neckers L.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5839-5845Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, transfection of active MEK1 could not diminish the Hsp90 inhibitor-induced apoptosis (data not shown). Therefore, inhibition of one or more other signaling pathways might be critical for the induction of apoptosis by Hsp90 inhibitors. Akt is recently reported to suppress apoptosis by phosphorylating some apoptosis-relating proteins (i.e. pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bad at Ser136, caspase family member caspase-9 at Ser196, the Forkhead transcription factor protein family, and IκB kinase) (7Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar, 8Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). We thus examined the Akt kinase activity after treatment with Hsp90 inhibitors. Akt was continuously phosphorylated at Ser473 residue when 293T cells were cultured in serum-containing medium. Incubation of 293T cells with radicicol, KF25706, or KF58333 induced the dephosphorylation of endogenous Akt at Ser473 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 A). The decrease in endogenous phospho-Akt (at Ser473) level was also found in human fibrosarcoma HT1080 and mouse colon adenocarcinoma NL-17 cells treated with KF58333 (data not shown), suggesting that Akt dephosphorylation induced by Hsp90 inhibitors is not restricted to one particular cell line. We also examined the change of phospho-Akt (Thr308) level in 293T cells. Because the anti-phospho-Akt (Thr308) antibody is not sensitive enough to detect the phosphorylated form of endogenous Akt protein in 293T cells, we transfected the FLAG-tagged akt cDNA into 293T cells and then examined the effects of KF58333 on phospho-Akt (Thr308) levels. KF58333 treatment promoted the dephosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 residue in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2 B). These results indicate that Hsp90 inhibitors suppress the phosphorylation at both Thr308 and Ser473 residues, although they also slightly down-regulate the expression of Akt protein itself (Fig. 2,A and B). To confirm that the dephosphorylation of Akt was associated with the decrease in Akt-mediated signaling, we investigated the change of phosphorylated form of GSK3. Akt is known to phosphorylate GSK3α at the Ser21 residue and GSK3β at the Ser9residue (7Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar, 8Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis using an anti-phospho-GSK3β (Ser9) antibody revealed that treatment of 293T cells with Hsp90 inhibitors decreased the endogenous phospho-GSK3β level (Fig.2 C), consistent with the decrease in phospho-Akt level (Fig.2, A and B). We also confirmed the decrease in Akt kinase activity by measuring the activity by immunoprecipitating FLAG-tagged Akt from 293T cells that had been transfected with the FLAG-tagged akt cDNA. The transfected 293T cells were treated with Hsp90 inhibitors for 24 h and then harvested. As shown in Fig. 2 D, treatment of Hsp90 inhibitors suppressed the Akt kinase activity. Examination of the change of phospho-Akt level by Western blotting confirmed that both geldanamycin and KF58333 almost completely dephosphorylate Akt at the Thr308 residue. These results indicate that Hsp90 inhibitors down-regulate not only phospho-Akt level but also Akt kinase activity in vivo. Because Akt itself was reported to be associated with phosphorylation of Akt at the Ser473 residue (13Toker A. Newton A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8271-8274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), we examined the direct effect of KF58333 on Akt kinase activity. The recombinant active Akt protein, which had previously been activated by PDK1, was incubated with KF58333 for 30 min at 30 °C in vitro before estimating its kinase activity. We could not observe the inhibitory effects of KF58333 on Akt kinase activity in vitro (Fig.2 E). This result indicates that Akt dephosphorylation and inactivation induced by Hsp90 inhibitors is not the cause of direct inhibition of Akt kinase activity. Because treatment of Hsp90 inhibitors down-regulate the phospho-Akt level, Hsp90 inhibitors might interfere with the kinase activity of the upstream Akt kinases PI3K and PDK1. We first examined the change of endogenous PI3K and PDK1 protein expression after drug treatment. As shown in Fig.3 A, the treatment of 293T cells with KF58333 decreased the amount of endogenous PDK1 but not p85 subunit of PI3K protein. Down-regulation of PDK1 protein expression was found when 293T cells were treated with KF58333 from the concentration of 30 nm. Raf-1 is well known to interact with Hsp90, and the inhibition of Hsp90-Raf-1 binding results in the decrease in Raf-1 protein expression (31Schulte T.W. Blagosklon"
https://openalex.org/W2067484466,"At the cerebellar synapses between parallel fibers (PFs) and Purkinje cells (PCs), long-term depression (LTD) of the excitatory synaptic current has been assumed to be independent of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation because PCs lack NMDA receptors. However, we now report that LTD is suppressed by NMDA receptor antagonists that act on presynaptic NMDA receptors of the PFs. This effect is still observed when the input is restricted to a single fiber. Therefore, LTD does not require the spatial integration of multiple inputs. In contrast, it involves a temporal integration, since reliable LTD induction requires the PFs to fire two action potentials in close succession. This implies that LTD will selectively depress the response to a burst of presynaptic action potentials."
https://openalex.org/W2088964796,"Hippocampal mossy fiber long-term potentiation (LTP) is expressed presynaptically, but the exact mechanisms remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate the involvement of the hyperpolarization-activated cation channel (Ih) in the expression of mossy fiber LTP. Established LTP was blocked and reversed by Ih channel antagonists. Whole-cell recording from granule cells revealed that repetitive stimulation causes a calcium- and Ih-dependent long-lasting depolarization mediated by protein kinase A. Depolarization at the terminals would be expected to enhance transmitter release, whereas somatic depolarization would enhance the responsiveness of granule cells to afferent input. Thus, Ih channels play an important role in the long-lasting control of transmitter release and neuronal excitability."
https://openalex.org/W2019282049,"GIRK (Kir3) channels are activated by neurotransmitters coupled to G proteins, via a direct binding of G(beta)(gamma). The role of G(alpha) subunits in GIRK gating is elusive. Here we demonstrate that G(alpha)(i) is not only a donor of G(beta)(gamma) but also regulates GIRK gating. When overexpressed in Xenopus oocytes, GIRK channels show excessive basal activity and poor activation by agonist or G(beta)(gamma). Coexpression of G(alpha)(i3) or G(alpha)(i1) restores the correct gating parameters. G(alpha)(i) acts neither as a pure G(beta)(gamma) scavenger nor as an allosteric cofactor for G(beta)(gamma). It inhibits only the basal activity without interfering with G(beta)(gamma)-induced response. Thus, GIRK is regulated, in distinct ways, by both arms of the G protein. G(alpha)(i) probably acts in its GDP bound form, alone or as a part of G(alpha)(beta)(gamma) heterotrimer."

https://openalex.org/W1554325855,"GABARAP recognizes and binds the γ2 subunit of the GABAA receptor, interacts with microtubules and the N-ethyl maleimide sensitive factor, and is proposed to function in GABAA receptor trafficking and postsynaptic localization. We have determined the crystal structure of human GABARAP at 1.6 Å resolution. The structure comprises an N-terminal helical subdomain and a ubiquitin-like C-terminal domain. Structure-based mutational analysis demonstrates that the N-terminal subdomain is responsible for tubulin binding while the C-terminal domain contains the binding site for the GABAA. A second GABARAP crystal form was determined at 1.9 Å resolution and documents that GABARAP can self-associate in a head-to-tail manner. The structural details of this oligomerization reveal how GABARAP can both promote tubulin polymerization and facilitate GABAA receptor clustering."

Polη discriminates poorly between the correct and incorrect nucleotide at both the initial nucleotide binding step and at the subsequent induced-fit conformational change step, which precedes the chemical step of phosphodiester bond formation. This property enables Polη to bypass lesions with distorted DNA geometries, and it bestows upon the enzyme a low fidelity."
https://openalex.org/W2066654584,"Many N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) channel blockers that have therapeutic potential can be trapped in the closed state. Using a combination of the substituted cysteine accessibility method and open channel blockers, we found that the M3 segment forms the core of the extracellular vestibule, including a deep site for trapping blockers. The M3 segment, as well as more superficial parts of the extracellular vestibule, undergo extensive remodeling during channel closure, but do not define the activation gate, which is located deeper in the pore. Rather, the pore walls lining the extracellular vestibule constrict during channel closure. This movement is essential for coupling ligand binding to activation gate opening and accounts for the different mechanisms of open channel block, including trapping."

This paper characterizes the modulatory effects of point of regard in three-dimensional space on responsiveness of visual cortical neurons in areas V1, V2, and V4. Such modulatory effects are both common, affecting 85% of cells, and strong, frequently producing changes of mean firing rate by a factor of 10. The prevalence of neurons in area V4 showing a preference for near distances may be indicative of the involvement of this area in close scrutiny during object recognition. We propose that eye-position signals can be exploited by visual cortex as classical conditioning stimuli, enabling the perceptual learning of systematic relationships between point of regard and the structure of the visual environment."

The R1-R6 subclass connects to the first optic ganglion, the lamina, and relies upon glial cells as intermediate targets. Conversely, R cells promote glial cell development including migration of glial cells into the target region. Here, we show that the JAB1/CSN5 subunit of the COP9 signalosome complex is expressed in R cells, accumulates in the developing optic lobe neuropil, and through the analysis of a unique set of missense mutations, is required in R cells to induce lamina glial cell migration. In these CSN5 alleles, R1-R6 targeting is disrupted. Genetic analysis of protein null alleles further revealed that the COP9 signalosome is required at an earlier stage of development for R cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2043857209,"Modulation of Ca2+ channels by neurotransmitters provides critical control of neuronal excitability and synaptic strength. Little is known about regulation of the Ca2+ efflux pathways that counterbalance Ca2+ influx in neurons. We demonstrate that bradykinin and ATP significantly facilitate removal of action potential-induced Ca2+ loads by stimulating plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases (PMCAs) in rat sensory neurons. This effect was mimicked in the soma and axonal varicosities by phorbol esters and was blocked by antagonists of protein kinase C (PKC). Reduced expression of PMCA isoform 4 abolished, and overexpression of isoform 4b enhanced, PKC-dependent facilitation of Ca2+ efflux. This acceleration of PMCA4 underlies the shortening of the action potential afterhyperpolarization produced by activation of bradykinin and purinergic receptors. Thus, isoform-specific modulation of PMCA-mediated Ca2+ efflux represents a novel mechanism to control excitability in sensory neurons."

Statistical tests of neutral evolution showed that a few haplotypes predominate in the 200-kilobase polymorphic region. Finally, contrary to the expectation of no recombination, we identified six recombination events within the chromosome. Thus, positive Darwinian selection and recombination have affected the evolution of this chromosome."
https://openalex.org/W2034822533,"Calcium-triggered exocytosis at the synapse is suppressed by addition of calcium chelators, but the effects of endogenous Ca2+ buffers have not been tested. We find that 80% of Ca2+ binding sites in the synaptic terminal of retinal bipolar cells were associated with mobile molecules that suppressed activation of Ca2+-sensitive K+ channels with an efficiency equivalent to ∼1.2 mM BAPTA. Removing these buffers caused a 30-fold increase in the number of vesicles released by Ca2+ tail currents lasting ∼0.5 ms and a 2-fold increase in the rapidly releasable pool of vesicles (RRP). The effects of BAPTA and EGTA indicate that vesicles comprising the RRP were docked at variable distances from Ca2+ channels. We propose that endogenous Ca2+ buffers regulate the size of the RRP by suppressing the release of vesicles toward the periphery of the active zone."

Furthermore, the DNA-tracking domain of SpoIIIE inhibited SpoIIIE complex assembly in the forespore.

Recent studies demonstrated that HPR1 expression is increased in a variety of malignancies and may play a critical role in tumor metastases. The HPR1 gene and its genomic structure have been recently cloned and characterized. To understand the mechanisms of HPR1 gene expression and regulation, we first mapped the transcription start site of the HPR1 gene and found that HPR1 mRNA was transcribed from the nucleotide position 101 bp upstream of the ATG codon. A 3.5-kb promoter region of the HPR1 gene was cloned. Sequence analysis revealed that the TATA-less, GC-rich promoter of theHPR1 gene belongs to the family of housekeeping genes. This 3.5-kb promoter region exhibited strong promoter activity in two thyroid tumor cell lines. Truncation analysis of theHPR1 promoter identified a minimal 0.3-kb region that had strong basal promoter activity. Truncation and mutational analysis of the HPR1 promoter revealed three Sp1 sites and four Ets-relevant elements (ERE) significantly contributing to basalHPR1 promoter activity. Binding to the Sp1 sites by Sp1 and to the ERE sites by GA-binding protein (GABP) was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and competition and supershift electrophoretic mobility shift assays.

The secondary PCR was conducted using antisense gene-specific primer 2 (GSP2; (5′-GCAGGCTTCGAGCGCAGCAGCATCTTG-3′, complementary to nucleotides +23 to −4) and inner adapter primer 2 (AP2). The PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 2 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s or 1.5 min; and 72 °C for 7 min. Me2SO (5% final concentration) was added to the primary PCR to facilitate amplification of the GC-rich region of the 5′-end region of theHPR1 cDNA. Dong et al. (20Dong J. Kukula A.K. Toyoshima M. Nakajima M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 253: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) recently suggested that HPR1gene transcription may be initiated from two different sites. To explore this possibility, we conducted RLM-RACE using a second set of the HPR1 gene-specific primers. The primary PCR was conducted using GSP2 and AP1. The PCR conditions were as follows: 94 °C for 2 min; 35 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min; and 72 °C for 7 min. The secondary PCR was conducted using GSP3 (5′-GAGAGTCGAGAGCTCTAGCACTTCCTC-3′ (complementary to nucleotides −45 to −71) and AP2. The same PCR conditions as described above were used. The PCR products were analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel, and the DNA band was excised, extracted, and used as a template in the sequencing reactions. The HPR1 promoter was cloned using the GenomeWalker kit (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). PCRs were conducted using two sense primers supplied with the kit and two synthesized antisense oligonucleotides (GSP2 and GSP3) complementary to the 5′-untranslated region ofHPR1 cDNA. Me2SO (5% final concentration) was added to the primary and secondary PCRs to facilitate amplification of the GC-rich HPR1 promoter. An ∼3.5-kb PCR product from the PvuII library and an ∼0.7-kb PCR product from the DraI library were obtained. The PCR fragments were then treated with Pfu DNA polymerase to polish the 3′-end overhang, phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase, and ligated to SmaI-digested and calf intestine phosphatase-treated pGL3/Basic reporter construct. The ligation reaction was used to transform competent Escherichia coliDH5α cells. Plasmid DNA was extracted, and the orientation was identified by MluI digestion. DNA sequencing was conducted in the University of Chicago Cancer Research Center. The nucleotide sequence of the HPR1 promoter has been submitted to the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank under accession numberAF461265. The D3 construct was generated by digesting pGL3/HPR-3.5 DNA with BamHI, followed by treatment with Pfu DNA polymerase to make a blunt end. The DNA fragment was then digested with BglII to produce a 300-bp fragment, which was then ligated to SmaI- andBglII-digested pGL3/Basic vector. The D2 con- struct was generated by digesting the D3 construct with the BglI restriction enzyme, followed by mung bean nuclease treatment to blunt the 5′-protruding end. The linearized fragment was then digested with HindIII (a HindIII site is in the pGL3/Basic vector), and an ∼200-bp fragment was extracted from the agarose gel and ligated to SmaI- andHindIII-digested pGL3/Basic. To generate the D3.2, D3.1, D2.1, and D2.2 constructs, four HindIII-tagged oligonucleotides flanking the sequence starting from 268, 239, 113, and 98 bp upstream of the ATG codon were synthesized and used in the PCRs to amplify the truncated HPR1 promoters with sizes of 268, 239, 113, and 98 bp, respectively. The D2M and D2.1M constructs were similarly generated using two oligonucleotides (5′-GAAGGTACCAGGCGGTTCGGGGTTGGATTGG-3′ and 5′-AAAGGTACCGTAACGGTTCGGAGGAAAGGAG-3′) with mutated Sp1 sites flanking nucleotides −209 and −113, respectively. The D3M1, D3M2, D3M3, D3M4, D3M5, D3M6, and D3M7 constructs were generated using the PCR-based QuikChange kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the ERE site-mutated primers listed in Fig. 7 A following the manufacturer's instruction. The D4 construct was generated by digesting the D3 construct with the BglI restriction enzyme, followed by mung bean nuclease treatment to blunt the 5′-protruding end. The linearized fragment was then digested with MluI (anMluI site is present in the original pGL/Basic vector), and an ∼100-bp fragment was extracted from the agarose gel and ligated toSmaI- and MluI- digested pGL3/Basic. Thyroid tumor cell lines and SL-2 cells were grown in 24-well plates. Upon 80% confluence, the cells were transfected with pGL3/Basic or HPR1 promoter-driven luciferase plasmid using FuGENETM 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) following the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, 100 μl of serum-free medium was premixed with 4.5 μl of FuGENETM 6 transfection reagent, incubated at room temperature for 5 min, and then transferred to a tube containing 1 μg of luciferase reporter construct plus 0.5 μg of pCMV/SPORT as an internal control. The DNA/FuGENETM 6 mixture was aliquoted to six wells (16 μl/well) and incubated for 24 h. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested. Cell lysates were prepared. Luciferase activity was quantitated using a luciferase substrate kit (Promega) and read in a Packard luminometer. Nuclear extracts were prepared from thyroid tumor cell lines (1 × 107/ml) following a standard protocol as previously described (21Li X.R. Chong A.S. Wu J. Roebuck K.A. Kumar A. Parrillo J.E.

Double-stranded oligonucleotides were end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. The labeled probes were separated by NucTrap probe purification columns. The sequences of two canonical Sp sites derived from the promoter of the HPR1gene are 5′-GGGCAGGCGGGGCGGGGTTGGGAT-3′ (Sp1-B) and 5′-GGCGTAACGGGGCGGAGGAAAGG-3′ (Sp1-A). The sequence of a non-canonical Sp1 site (Sp1-C) is 5′-TCCCGGCCATCTCCGCACCCTTCAAGTGGGTGTGGGTGAT-3′. The sequences of two canonical Sp1 sites with mutation of the Sp1 site are 5′-GGGCAGGCGGTTCGGGGTTGGGAT-3′ (Sp1-Bm) and 5′-GGCGTAACGGTTCGGAGGAAAGG-3′ (Sp1-Am) (mutated nucleotides are shown in boldface). The sequence of a consensus Sp1 probe is 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′. An unrelated oligonucleotide (interferon-γ activation site) was synthesized with the sequence 5′-ATTTTCCCCGAAAT-3′ and used as a negative control in competition EMSA. The sequences of the oligonucleotides containing ERE sites were synthesized and used for EMSA as well as for mutation of the ERE site (see Fig. 7 A). A consensus nuclear fac- tor-κB probe (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) and GABP probe (5′-AGCTTGCGGAACGGAAGCGGAAACCGCCGGATCG-3′) derived from theICP4 gene of human herpes simplex virus-1 were synthesized and used as negative and positive controls in competition EMSA (see Fig. 8), respectively. Labeled oligonucleotide (20,000–50,000 cpm) was incubated at room temperature for 20 min with 2 μg of nuclear extract protein. The DNA binding buffer contained 4% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 μg/ml poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), and 1 μg of bovine serum albumin/reaction. For competition EMSA, nuclear extract (2–5 μg/reaction) was preincubated with 5-, 20-, 100-fold molar excesses of unlabeled oligonucleotide at 4 °C for 30 min, and then labeled probes were added and incubated at room temperature for 20 min. For supershift EMSA, the32P-labeled probe (30,000 cpm/sample) was incubated with 2 μg of nuclear extract from KAT-4 cells (see Fig. 4 B) or NPA87 cells (see Fig. 7 B) at room temperature for 20 min. Antibody against Sp1, Sp3 (1 μg/sample), GABPα, and/or GABPβ was added and incubated on ice for 30 min. Normal mouse IgG and normal goat IgG were included as negative controls. The reactions were separated on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The dried gel was exposed to X-Omat film.Figure 4Binding activity of three putative Sp1 sites in the HPR1 promoter.

Med. 1999; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), using a traditional RACE assay, identified the 5′-end of the HPR1 gene at the nucleotide position 99 bp upstream of the translation start site, whereas a recent study by Dong et al. (20Dong J. Kukula A.K. Toyoshima M. Nakajima M. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 253: 171-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) suggested thatHPR1 mRNA transcribed in two different splicing forms could result from differential transcription initiation. Here we employed a modified RLM-RACE method to map the 5′-end of theHPR1 gene. Unlike the classic RACE, which has no selection for amplification of the full-length mRNA or degraded mRNA, but rather favors amplification of the degraded mRNA, RLM-RACE selectively amplifies the DNA fragment from the capped full-length mRNA. Two sets of antisense primers complementary to the three locations of the HPR1 gene were synthesized and used in two RLM-RACE reactions (Fig. 1 A). As shown in Fig. 1 B, RLM-RACE using GSP1 and GSP2 produced a PCR product of ∼160 bp (lane 4), whereas RLM-RACE with GSP2 and GSP3 produced a PCR product of ∼90 bp (lane 2). The PCR product derived from the RLM-RACE reaction with GSP1 and GSP2 was extracted from the agarose gel and used as the template in a sequencing reaction. Sequence analysis revealed that transcription of the HPR1 gene started at the nucleotide position 101 bp upstream of the ATG site (Fig. 2), which is two nucleotides upstream of the 5′-end previously identified by Vlodavsky et al. (13Vlodavsky I. Friedmann Y. Elkin M. Aingorn H. Atzmon R. Ishai-Michaeli R. Bitan M. Pappo O. Peretz T. Michal I. Spector L. Pecker I. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar) using classic RACE. Prolonging the extension time in the primary and secondary PCRs did not result in amplification of a larger PCR product (data not shown). These results indicate that the transcription start site of theHPR1 gene in both KAT-4 and MRO87 cell lines is located at the nucleotide position 101 bp upstream of the ATG site. A 3.5-kb DNA fragment of the HPR1 promoter was amplified using the GenomeWalker kit with two HPR1 gene-specific primers derived from the 5′-untranslated region of the HPR1 cDNA (Fig. 2). The final PCR product was polished by Pfu DNA polymerase and then blunt-ligated to SmaI-digested pGL3/Basic luciferase reporter vector. Computer analysis of the 3′-HPR1 promoter (Fig. 2) revealed a highly GC-rich content in its proximal promoter region. A GRAIL search identified a CpG island of 396 bp with a GC content of 58.83% in the first 700-bp region. A BLAST search of known sequences in the GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank was used to identify DNA homology. No significant homologous sequence was present. The HPR1 promoter lacks a typical TATA or CCAAT box, as seen with many GC-rich promoters. The TESS search program predicted a number of potential transcription factor-binding sites near or upstream of the major putative transcription initiation site, including E47, Max1, N-Myc, E74A, NCFI-C, Sp1, and p300.4. To map the minimal promoter region of the HPR1 gene required for initiating its gene transcription, we conducted functional analysis on this 3.5-kbHPR1 promoter. Three luciferase reporter constructs in Fig.3 A, containing 3.5-, 0.7-, and 0.3-kb fragments of the HPR1 promoter, respectively, were transduced into KAT-4 and MRO87 cells. After incubation for 24 h, the cells were harvested and analyzed for their luciferase activity. As shown in Fig. 3 B, KAT-4 and MRO87 cells transfected with the 3.5-kb HPR1 promoter-driven luciferase reporter construct expressed high-level luciferase activity. Deletion of theHPR1 promoter up to 0.7 kb upstream of the ATG translation initiation site did not reduce luciferase activity, but rather increased it by ∼2–3-fold. Further truncation to the 0.3-kb length only slightly reduced luciferase activity compared with that observed in cells transfected with the 0.7-kb promoter-driven luciferase reporter gene. These results suggest that the cis-regulatory elements required for the basal promoter activity of theHPR1 gene are mainly located in a 0.3-kb region upstream of the ATG initiation site. Sequence analysis revealed that several putative Sp1 sites and EREs with the core sequence GGAA are present in the proximal HPR1promoter region (Fig. 2). We first tested whether truncation or mutation of two canonical Sp1 sites, Sp1-A and Sp1-B, affected basalHPR1 promoter activity. A panel of the luciferase reporter constructs driven by various mutated or truncated HPR1promoters (Fig. 3 C) were transduced into KAT-4 and MRO87 cells. Transient expression of the luciferase reporter gene was analyzed by quantitating luciferase activity. As shown in Fig.3 D, deletion of a 105-bp fragment from −310 to −205 (D2 construct) reduced luciferase activity by ∼50% in both KAT-4 and MRO87 cells compared with the activity seen in cells transfected with the D3 construct. These results suggest that besides two putative Sp1 sites, a third cis-regulatory element is present at nucleotides −310 to −205. Mutation (D2M) or truncation (D2.1) of the Sp1-B site in the HPR1 promoter further reduced luciferase activity by 50% compared with the activity in cells transfected with D2. Mutation (D2.1M) or truncation (D2.2) of the Sp1-A site in theHPR1 promoter reduced luciferase activity by 3–5-fold compared with the activity in cells transfected with D2.1. These results collectively suggest that both the Sp1-B and Sp1-A sites are"

https://openalex.org/W2015490799,"The formation of stars is one of the most fundamental problems in astrophysics, as it underlies many other questions, on scales from the formation of galaxies to the formation of the solar system. The physical processes involve the turbulent behavior of a partially ionized medium containing a non-uniform magnetic field. Current debate centers around the time taken for turbulence to decay and the relative importance of the roles played by magnetic fields and turbulence. Technological advances such as millimeter-wave cameras have made possible observations of the temperature and density profiles, and statistical calculations of the lifetimes, of objects collapsing under their own self-gravity and those on the verge of collapse. Increased computing power allows more complex models to be made that include magnetic and turbulent effects. No current model can reproduce all of the observations."

We also observe them to be forming in a wide variety of environments, ranging from nearby giant molecular clouds to the supergiant molecular clouds found in starburst and merging galaxies. The typical star in our galaxy and probably in others formed as a member of a star cluster, so star formation is an intrinsically clustered and not an isolated phenomenon. The greatest challenge regarding clustered star formation is to understand why stars have a mass spectrum that appears to be universal. This review examines the observations and models that have been proposed to explain these fundamental issues in stellar formation."

https://openalex.org/W2141091281,"We model the development of the functional circuit of layer 4 (the input-recipient layer) of cat primary visual cortex. The observed thalamocortical and intracortical circuitry codevelop under Hebb-like synaptic plasticity. Hebbian development yields opponent inhibition: inhibition evoked by stimuli anticorrelated with those that excite a cell. Strong opponent inhibition enables recognition of stimulus orientation in a manner invariant to stimulus contrast. These principles may apply to cortex more generally: Hebb-like plasticity can guide layer 4 of any piece of cortex to create opposition between anticorrelated stimulus pairs, and this enables recognition of specific stimulus patterns in a manner invariant to stimulus magnitude. Properties that are invariant across a cortical column are predicted to be those shared by opponent stimulus pairs; this contrasts with the common idea that a column represents cells with similar response properties."

PCR analysis showed that this isoform is most abundant in the liver, kidney, and pancreas. In HepG2 cells, overexpressed AFXζ induced reporter gene activity through the insulin-responsive sequences of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), IGFBP-1, andG6Pase promoters.

Therefore, human forkhead factors FKHR and/or AFX may be downstream targets of the insulin-activated PI3K-PKB signaling pathway and also may be responsible for mediating insulin regulation of gene expression (12Kimura K.D.

The gene for AFX consists of three exons and is reported to encode a protein of 501 amino acids (25Borkhardt A. Repp R. Haas O.A. Leis T. Harbott J. Kreuder J. Hammermann J. Henn T. Lampert F. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). It is expressed ubiquitously with high levels in placenta and skeletal muscle (19Parry P. Wei Y. Evans G. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1994; 11: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). AFX binds the IRS element from IGFBP-1 and induces a pronounced increase in the activity of a reporter gene under the control of theIGFBP-1 promoter. This transcriptional activation requires an intact IRS, and insulin treatment suppresses the activation through the PI3K-PKB signaling pathway (26Kops G.J. De de Ruiter N.D. Vries-Smits A.M. Powell D.R. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 1999; 398: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Indeed, AFX contains three putative PKB phosphorylation sites and can be phosphorylated by PKB both in vitro and in vivo (23Takaishi H. Konishi H. Matsuzaki H. Ono Y. Shirai Y. Saito N. Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Kasuga M. Kikkawa U. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11836-11841Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 26Kops G.J. De de Ruiter N.D. Vries-Smits A.M. Powell D.R. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 1999; 398: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation by PKB alters the nuclear import of AFX, shifting its localization from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and thereby inhibiting AFX transcriptional activity (27Brownawell A.M. Kops G.J. Macara I.G. Burgering B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3534-3546Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). The PI3K-PKB pathway is an important but not unique route by which the activity of forkhead transcription factors are regulated (28Kops G.J. Burgering B.M. J. Mol. Med. 1999; 77: 656-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 29Tomizawa M. Kumar A. Perrot V. Nakae J. Accili D. Rechler M.M. Kumaro A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7289-7295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A PI3K inhibitor or a dominant-negative PKB mutant decreases but does not abolish insulin-induced phosphorylation of AFX (26Kops G.J. De de Ruiter N.D. Vries-Smits A.M. Powell D.R. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 1999; 398: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar), suggesting the existence of an alternate signaling pathway. A candidate for this alternative pathway is the mammalian AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) cascade. AMPK influences many metabolic processes that become dysregulated in the diabetic state (30Winder W.W. Hardie D.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: E1-E10PubMed Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which AMPK modulates transcriptional activity is unknown due to the fact that the transcription factor(s) involved remains unidentified. In this study, we investigated the involvement of AFX in the mammalian insulin signaling pathway. We discovered a novel AFX isoform, AFXζ, characterized its tissue distribution, DNA binding ability, and transcriptional activity. Reporter gene assays demonstrated that AFXζ is a potent transcription activator with properties distinct from those of the previously described isoform, AFXα, and that AFXζ is regulated by the insulin signaling pathway and by an agent known to affect AMPK activity. AFXζ may represent an integration point of the insulin signaling and AMPK pathways, allowing these pathways to regulate downstream gene expression cooperatively. Oligonucleotides for AFX amplification were based on the sequence in GenBankTM accession number X93996. All primers were synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc. The sequences added to facilitate cloning are represented in lowercase: 5–1: 5′-GAAGACTGGCAGGAATGTGCCTCCTGG-3′; 3–1: 5′-CGCCTGGCTCCACATCTGAAGCAGG-3′; 5–2: 5′-gacgtcgacctATGGATCCGGGGAATGAG-3′; 3–2: 5′-gacgtcgacTCAGGGATCTGGCTCAAAG-3′; 5–3: 5′-CTGTGGCAGGCTTCACTGAAC-3′; and 3–3: 5′-GCAAGTGTCAGTCGCTTCTC-3′. AFX cDNA was amplified using primers 5–1 and 3–1 from Marathon-Ready human liver and heart cDNA libraries (CLONTECH). Nested primers 5–2 and 3–2 were used to perform a second round PCR. Conditions for the PCR reactions were: 94 °C for 1 min; 94 °C for 15 s, 68 °C for 2 min, repeat for 30 cycles; and 68 °C for 3 min and dwell at 15οC. The PCR products were digested withSalI and cloned into the XhoI site of pcDNA6/His A (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and separately into theSalI site of pET-30a (Novagen, Madison, WI). The sequences of the constructs were confirmed using dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kits on an ABI 377 machine (Applied Biosystems). Human genomic DNA from four individuals were kindly provided by Dr. Chack Yung Yu (Columbus, Ohio). Human MTC cDNA panels I and II were purchased from CLONTECH. The Expand High Fidelity PCR System (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) was used to perform PCR amplifications with primers 5–3 and 3–3. PCR products were separated on 2% agarose gels. DNA was stained with Vistra Green and was visualized on the Storm FluorImager system (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The sequences of genomic PCR products were analyzed using programs in the GCG package. His-tagged AFXζ was expressed in an Escherichia coli BL21 strain after induction by 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 30 °C for 4 h. The bacterial fusion protein was purified using TALON metal affinity columns (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's instructions. AFXα and AFXζ proteins were translated in vitro from pcDNA6/His-AFXα and pcDNA6/His-AFXζ templates, respectively. The TNT T7 quick coupled transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI) was utilized according to the manufacturer's protocol. One microgram of the expression construct was used in each reaction. The DNA binding abilities of in vitro translated AFXα, AFXζ and purified bacterial fusion protein His-tagged AFXζ were tested in a gel shift assay system (Promega). IRS elements from PEPCK,IGFBP1, and G6Pase promoters were used as probes. Briefly, oligonucleotides for the sense and antisense strand of each IRS were annealed, and double-stranded fragments were end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The manufacturer's protocol was followed except that [γ-33P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA) was used in substitution of the suggested [γ-32P]ATP to label the DNA fragment. About 2 × 104-cpm probe was used in each binding reaction. For competition experiments, a 50 molar excess of each corresponding unlabeled oligonucleotide was added to the reaction. One hundred nanograms of in vitro translated AFX protein or 200 ng of purified His-tagged AFXζ was used in each binding reaction. The DNA-protein complexes were separated on 6% DNA retardation gel (Invitrogen). Gels were dried prior to autoradiography. Double-stranded DNA fragments containing each of the IRS elements from the promoters ofPEPCK, IGFBP-1, and G6Pase were cloned into the NheI/BglII site of the pSEAP2-promoter vector (CLONTECH). Dissected fragments of thePEPCK and IGFBP-1 IRS elements, referred to asPEPCK-a and PEPCK-b, and IGFBP-1a andIGFBP-1b, respectively, were cloned into the same site of the pSEAP2-promoter. In addition, a 501-bp fragment corresponding to the human PEPCK 5′ regulatory sequence (−458–+43 relative to the transcription start site, abbreviated as PEPCK p) was cloned into the BglII/EcoRI site of the same vector. The human hepatoma cell line HepG2 was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies). Transient transfection experiments were performed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (HyClone Laboratories) in 24-well plates. HepG2 cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies) with 0.2 μg (unless otherwise specified) of an appropriate SEAP reporter construct, CMV-β, and either pcDNA6/His-AFXα or -AFXζ expression plasmid. Each set of reporter assays includes a transfection in which no AFX expression construct was added. In experiments where PKB effects were tested, 0.2 μg of myr-Akt1 in pUSEamp(+) (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY), which expresses constitutively activated PKB, was included. For experiments in which the cells were treated with soluble agents, the medium was changed 24 h after the transfection and was replaced with medium containing appropriate concentrations of bpV (potassium bisperoxo(1,10-phenanthroline) oxovanadate, Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA), porcine insulin, or AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-d-ribofuranoside, Sigma) for another 15–18 h. Secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) and β-galactosidase activities were measured using Phospha-Light and Galacto-Star systems (Tropix Inc., Bedford, MA), respectively. HepG2 cells were grown in 100-mm dishes and were transfected with 4 μg of pCDNA6/His-AFXζ and/or myr-Akt1 or were treated for 12 h with insulin (100 nm). Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, were removed gently from the plate by scraping, and were pelleted by centrifugation. Cells were lysed for 1 min on ice in 0.2 ml of mild extraction buffer (10 mmHEPES, pH 8, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmKCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, complete protease inhibitor mixture (Boehringer), and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate.) The lysate was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and was spun for 3 min on setting 3 in a Eppendorf 5415C Microfuge. The resulting supernatant was collected and labeled the cytosolic fraction, and the residual nuclear pellet was resuspended in 0.1 ml of nuclear extraction buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 8, 25% glycerol, 420 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm EDTA, complete protease inhibitor mixture, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and placed on ice for 15 min. The tubes subsequently were spun for 10 min in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed, and the resulting nuclear extract was transferred to a new tube for storage. Protein concentrations were determined using the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). For Western blotting, 20 μg of cellular extract was subjected to SDS-PAGE with subsequent blotting to nitrocellulose. AFXζ and phospho-AFXζ proteins were detected using an AFX antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology sc5224) or a phospho-AFX (Ser-193) antibody (NEB 9471) according to the manufacturers' recommendations. We amplified AFX cDNAs by PCR from a human liver cDNA library using a primer set based on GenBankTM sequence X93996 (25Borkhardt A. Repp R. Haas O.A. Leis T. Harbott J. Kreuder J. Hammermann J. Henn T. Lampert F. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In all cloned amplicons, a single A nucleotide was found to be absent 20 nucleotides downstream of the previously designated initiation codon (Fig.1 B). This same “deletion” was also identified in PCR products using human heart cDNA library as DNA template. Using primers 5–3 and 3–3, we amplified the identical sequence from four independent human genomic DNA samples. Further confirmation for the absence of this A nucleotide comes from GenBankTM sequence Y11284, the gene sequence of human AFX exon 1. Correction of the sequence leads to slight changes of the predicted amino acid sequence of the protein N terminus as the initiation codon is shifted upstream (Fig. 1 B, sequence 2) to the most likely initiation codon as predicted by the ATGpr program (31Salamov A.A. Nishikawa T. Swindells M.B. Bioinformatics. 1998; 14: 384-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The coding region of human AFX thus encodes 505 amino acids (Fig. 1 C). The predicted forkhead domain is located at amino acids 97–184 of the revised sequence. Further analyses of the cloned AFX cDNAs revealed the presence of a shorter splice variant that encodes a shorter protein lacking amino acids 58–112 (Fig.1 C); we designate this alternate form as AFXζ and will refer to the longer form as AFXα. As shown in Fig. 1 A, the termini of the 165-bp cDNA region that is not present in AFXζ conform to the consensus sequences of splice junctions, suggesting that this deletion represents a cryptic intron. The amino acids previously identified as PKB phosphorylation sites in AFXα are retained in AFXζ as Thr-32, Ser-142, and Ser-207, but the Myb DNA binding homology domain of AFXα is absent in AFXζ. To investigate the tissue distribution of the AFXζ alternate splice form, PCR reactions were performed on first-strand cDNAs from different tissues using primer set 5–3 and 3–3 (Fig. 1 D) that generates a 424-bp product for AFXα and a 259-bp product for AFXζ. Among PCR amplifications from 16 different tissues, the 424-bp fragment representing AFXα was ubiquitous, while the 259-bp fragment from AFXζ was more tissue-specific. The greatest expression of AFXζ was observed in liver, kidney, and pancreas RNA (lanes 6,8 and 9). It was also readily detectable in heart and placenta (lanes 2 and 4). Lung, skeletal muscle, spleen, thymus, and small intestine expressed AFXζ at lower levels (lanes 5, 7, 10, 11, and 15). AFXζ transcripts were not detected in RNA samples from brain, prostate, testis, ovary, colon, and leukocyte (lanes 3, 12, 13, 14, 16, and17). Because part of the forkhead DNA binding domain (amino acids 97–184 in AFXα, Fig. 1 C) is absent in AFXζ, we examined whether AFXζ protein can bind DNA fragments that harbor IRSs. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, a His-tagged AFXζ bacterial fusion protein bound the IRS elements from the PEPCK (Fig. 2 B,lane 2), IGFBP1 (lane 5) andG6Pase (lane 8) promoters. A single DNA-protein complex was detected in each experiment. Corresponding unlabeled DNA fragments competed for binding of the probes (lanes 3,6, and 9). In vitro translated proteins for AFXζ (Fig. 2 C) and AFXα (Fig.2 D) were also used as the protein sources for gel shift assays, and a variety of shifted bands were observed. Multiple DNA-protein complexes have been shown previously in the binding of GST-AFXα and Trx-AFXα to an IRS within the IGFBP-1promoter (26Kops G.J. De de Ruiter N.D. Vries-Smits A.M. Powell D.R. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 1999; 398: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar, 32Furuyama T. Nakazawa T. Nakano I. Mori N. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 629-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Therefore, AFXζ protein binds IRS fragments even though it lacks the first 16 amino acids of the forkhead domain as identified in AFXα. To test the transcriptional activity of AFXα and AFXζ, cellular assay systems were developed. Reporter constructs were generated by inserting the fragments spanning the IRS elements of the PEPCK,IGFBP-1, and G6Pase promoters (Fig.2 A) or an expanded DNA fragment of the PEPCK p (−458–+43) regulatory sequence into the pSEAP2-promoter vector. First, we determined the transcriptional role of AFXζ on the expression of a reporter driven by the PEPCK IRS (−425–−399) and the full-length promoter (−458–+43) ofPEPCK (PEPCK p). Fig.3 A shows that in HepG2 cells, AFXζ activated both PEPCK IRS and PEPCKp-enhanced reporter transcription in a dose-dependent manner and to a similar extent, suggesting that transactivation at this single IRS accounts for the entire stimulation. We next compared the ability of AFXζ and AFXα to activate reporters containing previously characterized IRSs in HepG2 cells. As shown in Fig. 3 B, AFXα expression activated the IGFBP-1reporter ∼4-fold. This result is consistent with previous observations that AFXα induces a 6-fold increase of reporter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity when under the control of the IGFBP-1 promoter (26Kops G.J. De de Ruiter N.D. Vries-Smits A.M. Powell D.R. Bos J.L. Burgering B.M. Nature. 1999; 398: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). AFXα failed to activate the reporters containing the IRS elements fromPEPCK and G6Pase promoters or the reporter containing the extended PEPCK promoter region (−458–+43). On the other hand, AFXζ not only stimulated IGFBP-1reporter transcription to a high level (∼7-fold, Fig. 3 B), AFXζ also increased transcription of the IRS containingPEPCK and G6Pase and extended thePEPCK promoter constructs to 7–9-fold. Therefore, AFXζ appeared to have a broader and more potent ability to activate transcription when compared with AFXα. The PEPCK IRS overlaps with the consensus binding sequences for HNF3 and C/EBP; the IGFBP-1 IRS also overlaps with an HNF3 site (33Imai E. Stromstedt P.E. Quinn P.G. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.A.

Commun. 1994; 203: 1835-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). To investigate in more detail the sequence elements mediating transcriptional activation by both AFXα and AFXζ, a number of reporter constructs were generated by inserting dissectedPEPCK and IGFBP-1 IRS fragments (Fig.2 A) into the pSEAP2-promoter vector. These reporter constructs were cotransfected into HepG2 cells with either the AFXα or the AFXζ expression plasmids. Again, AFXζ activated all reporter constructs tested to a degree greater than that achieved with AFXα (Fig. 3 B). It is noteworthy that AFXζ activated bothPEPCK-a (IRS and HNF-3 sites) and PEPCK-b (IRS and C/EBP sites) ∼4-fold, while the effect on PEPCK (all three sites) appeared to be higher (∼8-fold). This suggested that AFXζ, unlike AFXα, can act cooperatively with factors binding at both the HNF3 and C/EBP sites. In the case of the IGFBP-1promoter, AFXα appeared to require both IRS sites to mediate transcriptional activation. These observations suggested that AFXζ may be less stringent or have altered DNA binding affinity compared with AFXα. We tested whether the transactivational properties of AFXζ respond to insulin treatment. In HepG2 cells, AFXζ activated the reporter transcription under the control of PEPCKpromoter (Fig. 3). When the cells were treated with increasing concentrations of insulin, the induced PEPCKp-SEAP activity decreased to 50% compared with the untreated cells (Fig. 4 A). Insulin also inhibited the AFXζ-induced PEPCK IRS-SEAP activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4 B), decreasing reporter activity to the basal level at 200 nminsulin. Additionally, we observed that insulin repressedPEPCK IRS-SEAP in cells in which exogenous AFXζ had not been introduced (data not shown). Because reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that the AFXζ mRNA splice variant is expressed in HepG2 cells (data not shown), this insulin-dependent inhibition may be exerted through endogenous AFXζ. Our data suggest that insulin suppressesPEPCK expression and that AFXζ can mediate this effect through IRS. We also investigated the effect of bisperoxovanadate (bpV), an inhibitor of phosphatases (37Gordon J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) that can deactivate components of the insulin signaling pathway by dephosphorylation (38Wijkander J. Holst L.S. Rahn T. Resjo S. Castan I. Manganiello V. Belfrage P. Degerman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21520-21526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Similar to the effect seen with insulin, bpV reduced the AFXζ-induced PEPCK p-SEAP activity in a dose-dependent manner(Fig.5 A). The addition of bpV repressed reporter gene activity at concentrations as low as 0.5 μm. More significantly, the reporter activity was diminished by 5 μm bpV to below the basal level. We observed toxicity of bpV in HepG2 cells above 5 μm as evidenced by the reduction of the control β-galactosidase activity. The data suggest that the suppressive effect of insulin on the transcriptional activity of AFXζ may be mediated through a phosphatase-sensitive pathway. To assess the role of the PI3K/PKB insulin signaling pathway in the suppression of AFXζ transactivation, a plasmid encoding constitutively active PKB was cotransfected with an AFXζ expression construct and the PEPCK p-SEAP reporter construct.

Addition of 2 mm MgADP induced a slightly greater blue shift and a slight increase in intensity over those observed with 1:1 MgADP. However, addition of 2 mm MgAMP-PNP or MgATP induced a much greater blue shift and substantially enhanced fluorescence intensity over those observed in the presence of stoichiometric MgADP or MgAMP-PNP. It is clear from these results that the fluorescence spectrum of the introduced tryptophans in the βF155W mutant of TF1 does not respond in regular increments at any wavelength as catalytic sites are filled with nucleotides. The fluorescence spectrum observed after entrapping MgADP-fluoroaluminate complexes in two catalytic sites of the βF155W subcomplex indicates that the fluorescence emission spectrum of the enzyme is maximally perturbed when nucleotides are bound to two catalytic sites.

Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2719) Google Scholar), the α and β subunits are arranged alternately in an (αβ)3 hexamer, the central cavity of which is occupied with a coiled-coil composed of the α-helical amino and carboxyl termini of the γ subunit. In the crystal structure of the bovine enzyme, non-catalytic sites are located at α/β interfaces and contain bound MgAMP-PNP. In contrast, the three catalytic sites, located at different α/β interfaces, are heterogeneously liganded. One, designated βT, contains MgAMP-PNP; another, designated βD, contains MgADP; and the third, designated βE, is empty. In the crystal structure, α subunits, which contain most of the amino acid side chains that interact with bound MgAMP-PNP, are in closed conformations. The conformations of βT and βD, which contain most of the amino acid side chains that interact with MgAMP-PNP and MgADP, respectively, are also closed and are very similar to the closed conformation of α subunits. In contrast, βEexists in an open conformation that is substantially different from the nearly common conformation of βT and βD. As pointed out earlier, the amino acid side chains that interact with bound Mg2+ or the anionic oxygens of bound nucleotides in βT and βD in the crystal structure of MF1 are rearranged to a great extent in the open conformation of βE compared with the closed conformations of βD and βT (4Allison W.S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 819-826Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Substantial experimental evidence accumulated by Boyer (5Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar, 6Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar) before the crystal structure of MF1 was determined suggested that the three catalytic sites of F1 fire sequentially during ATP synthesis and hydrolysis. From these observations and asymmetry seen in early electron micrographs of F1-ATPases (7Boekema E.J. Berden J. van Heel M.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 851: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 8Gogol E.P. Aggeler R. Sagermann M. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 4717-4724Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), it was predicted that the minor subunits (later shown for the Escherichia coli enzyme to include the γ and ε subunits) rotate with respect to the hexameric arrangement of α and β subunits (5Boyer P.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1140: 215-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar, 6Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar). Experiments designed on the basis of the crystal structure of MF1 demonstrated that the γ subunit does indeed rotate in a counterclockwise direction when F1 hydrolyzes ATP (9Noji H. Yasuda R. Yoshida M. Kinosita K. Nature. 1997; 386: 299-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (1925) Google Scholar, 10Yasuda R. Noji H. Kinosita K. Yoshida M.

A. 2001; 98: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Although several models have been proposed, a generally accepted, detailed mechanism for coupling ATP synthesis and hydrolysis to rotation of the γ subunit has not been described. Until Weber et al. (13Weber J. Wilke-Mounts S. Lee R.S.-F. Grell E. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20126-20133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the βY345W mutant 2Residue numbers of MF1 are used throughout. In MF1, βPhe155 is equivalent to βPhe157 of TF1 and βPhe148 of EF1; βPhe326 is equivalent to βPhe322 of TF1 and βPhe312 of EF1; and βTyr345 is equivalent to βTyr341 of TF1 and βTyr331 of EF1. 2Residue numbers of MF1 are used throughout. In MF1, βPhe155 is equivalent to βPhe157 of TF1 and βPhe148 of EF1; βPhe326 is equivalent to βPhe322 of TF1 and βPhe312 of EF1; and βTyr345 is equivalent to βTyr341 of TF1 and βTyr331 of EF1. of Escherichia coli F1-ATPase (EF1) does not catalyze ATP hydrolysis at significant rates until the third catalytic site of the enzyme binds ATP, the bisite binding change model of Boyer (6Boyer P.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 717-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar) was generally accepted as a working hypothesis for the molecular mechanism of ATP synthesis and hydrolysis catalyzed by F0F1. Subsequently, Weber et al. (14Weber J. Bowman C. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18711-18718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) proposed a trisite model for ATP hydrolysis that takes into account their findings with the βY345W mutant of EF1 and the different responses of the fluorescence emission spectrum of the βF155W mutant of EF1 on binding MgAMP-PNP as opposed to binding MgADP to catalytic sites. From the latter analysis, it was concluded that, during steady-state ATP hydrolysis by the βF155W mutant, MgADP is bound to two catalytic sites, and MgATP is bound to a single catalytic site. However, this model predicts that the product Pi is released from a catalytic site in one catalytic cycle, whereas the product ADP is released in the next catalytic cycle. Consequently, as Senior et al. (15Senior A.E. Nadanaciva S. Weber J. J. Exp. Biol. 2000; 203: 35-40PubMed Google Scholar) have pointed out, simply reversing the arrows in the four-step model does not provide a mechanism for ATP synthesis. This is in conflict with the intermediate H2O ⇆ Pi oxygen exchange reaction observed when isolated F1-ATPases hydrolyze ATP, indicating that ATP synthesis and hydrolysis share a common transition state (16Boyer P.D. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2164-2178Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Whether the fluorescence spectrum of the introduced tryptophans of the βF155W mutant of EF1 accurately reports occupancy of catalytic sites with MgADP and ATP is also questionable for the following reasons. Weber and Senior (17Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33210-33215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) subsequently reported that the fluorescence spectrum of the introduced tryptophans indicated that MgATP is entrapped in three catalytic sites when the ATPase activity of the βF155W mutant of EF1 is inhibited with azide. However, substantial evidence reported from several laboratories indicates that inhibition of ATPase activity by azide is turnover-dependent and entraps a stabilized form of inhibitory MgADP in a catalytic site (18Vasilyeva E.A. Minkov I.B. Fitin A.F. Vinogradov A.D. Biochem. J. 1982; 202: 15-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 19Kalasnikova T.Y. Milgrom Y.M. Murataliev M.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 177: 213-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20Murataliev M.B. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12885-12892Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21Jault J.-M. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1558-1566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, it is not obvious from inspection of the crystal structure of MF1 why the fluorescence spectrum of the introduced tryptophans in the βF155W mutant should report occupancy of catalytic sites with MgADP and MgATP during steady-state ATP hydrolysis. Fig.1 illustrates that, in the original crystal structure of MF1 (3Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2719) Google Scholar), the phenyl side chain of βPhe155 in βT points away from the γ-phosphate of bound AMP-PNP. The phenyl side chain and amide nitrogen of βPhe155 are 12.5 and 9 Å, respectively, from the nearest oxygen in the γ-phosphate of bound AMP-PNP. In βD, the phenyl side chain and amide nitrogen of βPhe155 are separated from the nearest oxygen in the β-phosphate of bound ADP by about the same distances. In the original crystal structure of bovine F1, the closest neighbor of the phenyl ring of βPhe155 is the phenyl ring of βPhe326 in all three β subunits. Whereas the Cζ atoms in the phenyl rings are 3.5 Å apart and point toward each other in βE, the rings are stacked in βT and βD, where they are 3.5 and 3.4 Å apart, respectively. The phenyl rings of these residues have similar orientations in βT and βD in the recently reported crystal structure of MF1 containing MgADP-fluoroaluminate bound to two catalytic sites present in fully closed conformations and MgADP plus sulfate bound to the catalytic site (designated βE) that is in the half-closed conformation. In this crystal structure, the stacked phenyl rings in βTand βD are 3.7 and 3.8 Å apart, respectively, and the Cζ atoms of the rings are end-to-end and 3.4 Å apart in the half-closed β subunit containing MgADP and sulfate (22Menz R.I. Walker J.E. Leslie A.G.W. Cell. 2001; 106: 331-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). The close proximity of the phenyl rings of βPhe155 and βPhe326 in the crystal structures of MF1suggests that the responses of the introduced tryptophans in the βF155W mutant of EF1 induced by binding nucleotides to catalytic sites might reflect changes in the orientation of the indole of the introduced tryptophans at βPhe155 with respect to the phenyl rings of βPhe326. To test this possibility, we have prepared the α3β3γ subcomplexes of thermophilic Bacillus PS3 F1-ATPase (TF1) containing the βF155W and βF326W substitutions. The responses of the fluorescence emission spectrum of each mutant upon binding nucleoside di- and triphosphates to catalytic sites as well as the catalytic characteristics of the mutant enzymes have been examined in detail. The results and conclusions drawn from these experiments are reported here. Enzymes, biochemicals used in assays, and ingredients of buffers were purchased from Sigma. Sodium azide was purchased from Aldrich; aluminum chloride was from Fisher; and lauryl dimethylamine oxide was from Calbiochem. The primers for generating the α3(βF155W)3γ and α3(βF326W)3γ mutant subcomplexes using the polymerase chain reaction were purchased from Invitrogen. Ecoscint from National Diagnostics, Inc. was used to detect radioactivity with a Packard 1600 TR scintillation counter. Plasmid pKK, which carries the genes encoding the α, β, and γ subunits of TF1, was used for mutagenesis and gene expression (23Matsui T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Mutant expression plasmids were prepared by the polymerase chain reaction using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. The primers and their corresponding complements (not shown) that were used to incorporate the base changes for the βF155W and βF326W substitutions into pKK were as follows: 5′-GGC GGA AAA ATC GGT TTG TGG GGC GGC G-3′ and 5′-GCT CCG GCC ACG ACG TGG TCG CAC TTG GAT GCG-3′, respectively. The base changes are underlined. The plasmid DNA was purified using the Wizard Plus miniprep system (Promega). After confirming the mutations by sequence analysis, the pKK mutant plasmids were expressed in JM103 (unc−). After expression, the wild-type and mutant α3β3γ subcomplexes were purified to homogeneity as described by Matsui and Yoshida (23Matsui T. Yoshida M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1231: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and were stored at 4 °C as precipitates in 70% ammonium sulfate. Solutions of the subcomplexes used for kinetic and fluorescence measurements were freed of endogenous nucleotides by treatment with CDTA as described in detail previously (24Jault J.-M. Dou C. Grodsky N.B. Matsui T. Yoshida M. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28818-28824Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The CDTA-treated preparations were shown to be free of ATP and contained <0.05 mol of ADP/mol of enzyme as determined by anion-exchange high pressure liquid chromatography on a TSK DEAE-5PW column. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar). The α3(βF155W)3γ subcomplex at 2.8 μm in 100 μl of 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) was incubated with 2.8 μm ADP to generate the 1:1 MgADP-fluoroaluminate complex or with 10 μm [3H]ADP to generate the 2:1 Mg[3H]ADP-fluoroaluminate complex in the presence of 1 mm MgCl2 for 30 min before adding AlCl3 and NaF to final concentrations of 200 μm and 5 mm, respectively, to initiate inactivation. Samples of the reaction mixtures were assayed for ATPase activity as described previously until >90% inactivation was observed (26Dou C. Grodsky N.B. Matsui T. Yoshida M. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3719-3727Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture prepared with 10 μm[3H]ADP was passed through a 1-ml centrifuge column of Sephadex G-50 equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) to remove [3H]ADP that was not bound as the Mg[3H]ADP-fluoroaluminate complex. In duplicate samples, it was found that 1.8 and 2.0 mol of [3H]ADP remained bound to the mutant subcomplex after gel-permeation chromatography. The fluorescence emission spectra were recorded from 310 to 410 nm using a Spex Fluoromax-2 spectrofluorometer when the α3(βF155W)3γ, α3(βF326W)3γ, and α3(βY345W)3γ subcomplexes at 50 nm were excited at 295 nm in 50 mm Tris-Cl (pH 8.0) containing the additions indicated in the figure legends. Fig.2 compares the effects of increasing Mg2+ concentration on the rate of hydrolysis of 2 mm ATP by the mutant and wild-type enzymes. With the wild-type enzyme and the βF326W mutant, the maximal rates of hydrolysis were observed when the ATP/Mg2+ ratios were ∼1.8:1 and 2.0:1, respectively. In each of these cases, the rate of hydrolysis decreased significantly as the ATP/Mg2+ ratio decreased below the optimal concentration, indicating that free Mg2+ is inhibitory. In contrast, free Mg2+ in the assay medium did not affect the rate of hydrolysis of 2 mm ATP by the βF155W mutant. Thek cat values calculated for hydrolysis of 2 mm ATP at the optimal ATP/Mg2+ ratio by the wild-type and βF155W and βF326W mutant enzymes are 245, 432, and 419 s−1, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3, hydrolysis of 2 mm ATP catalyzed by the two mutant enzymes was less sensitive to inhibition by azide than hydrolysis catalyzed by the wild-type enzyme. Whereas the wild-type subcomplex was inhibited by 80% in the presence of 100 μm NaN3, the βF155W and βF326W mutants were inhibited by 20 and 45%, respectively, under the same conditions. The wild-type and mutant enzymes also responded differently to increasing concentrations of lauryl dimethylamine oxide in the assay medium during hydrolysis of 2 mm ATP. Whereas the wild-type enzyme was stimulated ∼4-fold in the presence of 0.05–0.20% lauryl dimethylamine oxide, the βF326W mutant was stimulated by only 50%. In contrast, hydrolysis of 2 mm ATP by the βF155W mutant enzyme was inhibited by ∼30% in the presence of 0.05–0.20% lauryl dimethylamine oxide in the assay medium. Weber et al. (14Weber J. Bowman C. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18711-18718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) showed that the introduced tryptophans in the βF155W mutant of EF1 fluoresced with an emission maximum at ∼340 nm. They also showed that, in the presence of 2 mm MgADP, fluorescence was quenched and blue-shifted between 325 and 390 nm, with maximal quenching occurring at 350 nm. In contrast, they showed that, in the presence of 2 mm AMP-PNP, minor quenching was observed between 350 and 390 nm, whereas fluorescence was enhanced and blue-shifted between 310 and 348 nm, with maximal enhancement occurring at 325 nm (see Fig. 3 of Ref. 14Weber J. Bowman C. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18711-18718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). When the EF1 mutant was titrated with 0.1–2000 μm MgADP, the biphasic fluorescence quenching observed at 350 nm fit a theoretical curve, suggesting that MgADP binding to a single catalytic site of higher affinity caused 50% quenching and that the remainder of the 12% quenching observed at saturation was caused by binding MgADP to the two catalytic sites of lower affinity. In contrast, when the mutant enzyme was titrated with 0.1–2000 μm MgAMP-PNP, the fluorescence enhancement observed at 325 nm fit a theoretical curve, indicating a single catalytic site of higher affinity and two catalytic sites of lower affinity, with each site contributing equally to the 14% enhancement observed at saturation (see Fig. 4 of Ref. 14Weber J. Bowman C. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18711-18718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows that, in the absence of nucleotides, the fluorescence emission spectrum of the βF155W mutant subcomplex was very similar to that reported for the βF155W mutant of EF1. However, the fluorescence spectrum of the βF155W subcomplex of TF1 responded differently upon binding MgADP or MgAMP-PNP to catalytic sites. Fig. 4 A illustrates the shifts in the fluorescence emission spectrum accompanying addition of stoichiometric MgADP, on the one hand, and 2 mm MgADP, on the other, to the mutant enzyme. The emission maximum shifted from 343 to 337 nm when stoichiometric MgADP was added to the mutant enzyme. This was accompanied by 16% fluorescence quenching at 337 nm, the new emission maximum, and 19% quenching at 343 nm, the original emission maximum. A significant blue shift was also observed between 355 and 400 nm. Following addition of 2 mm MgADP to the βF155W mutant, the emission maximum also shifted from 343 to 337 nm. This was accompanied by significantly less quenching (9% at 337 nm and 13% at 343 nm) than observed after addition of stoichiometric MgADP. Essentially the same blue shift was observed between 355 and 400 nm when stoichiometric or 2 mm MgADP was added to the βF155W mutant. However, a significantly greater blue shift was observed between 315 and 330 nm following addition of 2 mm MgADP compared with that observed when stoichiometric MgADP was added. It is clear from the comparisons illustrated in Fig. 4 A that the fluorescence spectrum of the introduced tryptophans in the βF155W mutant subcomplex did not respond in regular increments at any wavelength as the number of catalytic sites occupied with MgADP increased. The responses of the fluorescence spectrum of the introduced tryptophans induced by addition of stoichiometric and 2 mmMgAMP-PNP to the βF155W mutant enzyme in separate experiments are illustrated in Fig. 4 B. The shift in the emission spectrum accompanying addition of stoichiometric MgAMP-PNP was very similar to the shift observed when stoichiometric MgADP was added, as illustrated in Fig. 4 A, except that addition of stoichiometric MgAMP-PNP induced slightly less quenching at 337 nm and a less pronounced blue shift between 355 and 400 nm. In contrast, the change in fluorescence accompanying addition of 2 mm MgAMP-PNP to the mutant enzyme shown in Fig. 4 B differed considerably from the response accompanying addition of 2 mm MgADP illustrated in Fig. 4 A. Following addition of 2 mm MgAMP-PNP, the emission maximum shifted from 343 to 328 nm. This was accompanied by substantially augmented fluorescence over that observed in the absence of nucleotides. Addition of stoichiometric MgAMP-PNP to the mutant enzyme had essentially no effect on fluorescence emission at 328 nm, whereas following addition of 2 mm MgAMP-PNP to the mutant enzyme, fluorescence emission at this wavelength increased by 42%. As observed when MgADP bound to catalytic sites of the βF155W mutant, the fluorescence spectrum of the introduced tryptophans in the mutant enzyme did not respond in regular increments at any wavelength as the number of catalytic sites occupied with MgAMP-PNP increased. Fig. 4 (C and D) compares the shifts in the fluorescence emission spectrum observed after addition of 2 mm ADP or ATP, respectively, to the βF155W mutant enzyme in the absence of Mg2+. As shown in Fig. 4 C, only slight quenching of fluorescence accompanied addition of stoichiometric ADP to the mutant enzyme, indicating that the first catalytic site occupied has low affinity for ADP in the absence of Mg2+. This is consistent with the nucleotide binding properties of the βY345W mutant of EF1 summarized in Ref.1Weber J. Senior A.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1319: 19-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar. In contrast, Fig. 4 C illustrates that the shift in the fluorescence emission spectrum following addition of 2 mmADP to the mutant enzyme in the absence of Mg2+ was very similar to the shift observed when 2 mm ADP was added in the presence of Mg2+, as shown in Fig. 4 A. The shift in the emission spectrum of the βF155W mutant enzyme observed when stoichiometric or 2 mm ATP was added is illustrated in Fig. 4 D. Addition of stoichiometric ATP caused minor fluorescence quenching between 330 and 340 nm. The shift in the fluorescence emission spectrum observed after adding 2 mmATP to the mutant enzyme qualitatively resembled the shift observed following addition of 2 mm AMP-PNP in the presence of Mg2+ (Fig. 4 B) in that similar blue shifts were generated. However, the increase in fluorescence at 330 nm over that observed in the control not containing nucleotides was ∼2-fold greater in the case of 2 mm AMP-PNP in the presence of Mg2+. Fig. 5 illustrates the fluorescence spectra observed after forming MgADP-fluoroaluminate complexes in one or two catalytic sites of the βF155W mutant enzyme. Comparison of the spectra illustrated in Figs. 4 A and 5 shows that conversion of MgADP bound to a single catalytic site (Fig. 4 A,dashed curve) of the βF155W mutant enzyme to the MgADP-fluoroaluminate complex (Fig. 5, dotted curve) was accompanied by a small increase in fluorescence at the emission maximum (337 nm) and a significant red shift between ∼355 and 390 nm. In contrast, conversion of Mg[3H]ADP bound to multiple catalytic sites of the βF155W mutant enzyme (Fig. 4 A,dotted curve) to Mg[3H]ADP-fluoroaluminate complexes bound to two catalytic sites (Fig. 5, dashed curve) as described under “Experimental Procedures” generated a fluorescence spectrum qualitatively similar to the spectrum illustrated in Fig. 4 B (dotted curve) that was generated after addition of 2 mm MgAMP-PNP to the mutant enzyme. The fluorescence at the 328 nm emission maximum observed after adding 2 mm MgAMP-PNP to the mutant enzyme (Fig.4 B, dotted curve) was ∼15% greater than the fluorescence emission exhibited at the same wavelength after converting MgADP bound at two catalytic sites to Mg[3H]ADP-fluoroaluminate complexes (Fig. 5, dashed curve). Essentially the same emission spectrum (data not shown; illustrated in Fig. 5, dashed curve) was obtained when the βF155W mutant was inactivated by addition of Al3+ and F− after incubation with a 20-fold higher concentration of MgADP (200 μm). Based on the following indirect evidence, catalytic sites should be saturated with MgADP before addition of Al3+ and F− to initiate formation of the fluoroaluminate complexes in this experiment. AK m value of 75 μm was determined for ATP hydrolysis by the βF155W mutant from Lineweaver-Burk plots not illustrated. The nucleotide binding parameters of the α3(βY345W)3γ subcomplex of TF1 determined from Lineweaver-Burk analysis and fluorescence titrations revealed a K m value of 70 μm and K d values of 14 and 21 μm for MgADP and MgATP binding, respectively, to the catalytic site of lowest affinity (27Ren H. Allison W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10057-10063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that only two catalytic sites contribute to the fluorescence spectrum induced when MgADP-fluoroaluminate complexes are formed in two catalytic sites when the mutant enzyme is treated with Al3+and F− in the presence of 200 μm MgADP, whereas the third catalytic site containing MgADP does not contribute. When irradiated at 295 nm, the α3(βY345W)3γ mutant subcomplex fluoresces with an emission maximum at 353 nm (28Dou C. Fortes P.A.G. Allison W.S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16757-16764Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Fig.6 A illustrates that the emission spectrum of the introduced tryptophans in the βY345W mutant subcomplex was quenched in nearly identical increments as its three catalytic sites were filled with nucleotides. Following addition of stoichiometric MgAMP-PNP, fluorescence at the emission maximum decreased by ∼30%, whereas addition of 2 mm MgAMP-PNP led to complete quenching of the fluorescence of the introduced tryptophans. When two catalytic sites of the βY345W mutant subcomplex were loaded with the MgADP-fluoroaluminate complex (Fig. 6 A,dash/dot curve) as described under “Experimental Procedures”, ∼68% of the fluorescence of the introduced tryptophans was quenched. Fig. 6 B shows that the introduced tryptophans in the βF326W mutant subcomplex fluoresced with an emission maximum at 346 nm when irradiated at 295 nm. Fluorescence emission was not quenched in linear increments as the number of catalytic sites occupied with nucleotides increased. About 9% quenching of"

In his Perspective, [Rees][1] highlights the report by [ Abel et al .][2], who report three-dimensional calculations of star formation in the core of a collapsing primordial cloud. The first stars began to form just 100 million years after the Big Bang; only one atom in a thousand got incorporated into first-generation stars. It will be an even greater challenge to compute the complicated internal gas dynamics and feedback in later, more complex systems.

https://openalex.org/W1988929245,"Eons before Jerry Lee Lewis recorded his ground-shaking 1957 tune “Great Balls of Fire,” human beings were pondering the stars. Lewis's single (released, aptly enough, by Sun Records) revolutionized popular music and set three generations jumping and gyrating. Astrophysicists and astronomers have had their share of hits, too. Yet they are still learning the dance by which the real balls of fire in the night sky came into being. Did luminous matter in the universe start with a single star or with a cluster of stars? Did later stars come into being through variants on a common theme (such as the collapse of molecular clouds) or in a seething mosh pit of disparate forces and mechanisms? No one knows.

Still, progress is being made. In the past few years, advances in computing power and numerical techniques, as well as millions of stellar observations have improved our understanding of the mechanisms needed to initiate star formation, the physical and chemical environment in which stars form, and the evolution and clustering of stars in space and time over the history of the universe. This special section synthesizes and reviews what scientists have recently learned about star formation and what this knowledge can teach us about our solar system, other planetary systems, galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and large-scale luminous structure in the universe.

In perhaps the simplest scenario, a star of a few solar masses forms in isolation from other stars. Ward-Thompson (p. [76][1]) reviews the first two stages of such stellar development, from the formation of a gravitationally bound core in a cloud dominated by molecular hydrogen to the collapse of this core under self-gravity. The trickiest part is getting the core to collapse to form a protostar despite interference from turbulence and magnetic fields. Recent simulations by Abel et al. (p. 93 and the accompanying Perspective by Rees, p. [51][2]) and others suggest that a much more massive single star may have been the first luminous object in the universe to form by the collapse of a molecular cloud.

Pudritz (p. 68) reviews the formation of clusters of stars. Many experts think most stars form in clusters rather than singly, so that effects such as stellar winds and shock waves from nearby supernovae need to be considered in star-formation scenarios. Pudritz argues that the first stars formed in such turbulent cluster environments. The argument for simplicity gained force recently when astronomers synthesized data on the initial mass function; the spatial distribution of stars of a specific mass range in a given volume of space. Kroupa (p. [82][3]) reviews the initial mass function for stars in a wide range of masses. He shows that all of them, regardless of their age or environment, have similar initial mass functions. This unexpected uniformity suggests that all stars form by some common mechanism.

To round out the section, News writer Robert Irion describes how two very different residents of the cosmic menagerie may shed light on broader processes of star formation. Brown dwarfs and other very-low-mass dim objects of uncertain origin are showing unexpected similarities to their more conspicuous stellar cousins. At the other end of the size and age scales lurk the ancient Population III stars; huge masses of pristine hydrogen and helium whose sheer simplicity may help astrophysicists unscramble their secrets.

There's more. An online supplement to this issue ([www.sciencemag.org/feature/data/starformation/index.shtml][4]) includes links to previous Science reviews, articles, and special issues related to star formation, as well as to a wide variety of other Web resources.

Star-formation researchers may still be waiting for the great hit single that will set their field ablaze, but Science readers don't have to wait. Ladies and gentlemen, let's rock and roll.
