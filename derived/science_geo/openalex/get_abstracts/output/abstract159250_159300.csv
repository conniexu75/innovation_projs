We studied the interaction between theras oncogene and hypoxia in up-regulating glut1mRNA levels using Rat1 fibroblasts transformed with H-ras (Rat1-ras). Transformation with H-ras led to a substantial increase in glut1mRNA levels under normoxic conditions and additively increasedglut1 mRNA levels in concert with hypoxia. Using a luciferase reporter construct containing 6 kilobase pairs of theglut1 promoter, we showed that this effect was mediated at the transcriptional level. Promoter activity was much higher in Rat1-ras cells than in Rat1 cells and could be down-regulated by cotransfection with a dominant negative Ras construct (RasN17). A 480-base pair (bp) cobalt/hypoxia-responsive fragment of the promoter containing a HIF-1 binding site showed significantly higher activity in Rat1-ras cells than in Rat1 cells, suggesting that Ras might mediate its effect through HIF-1 even under normoxic conditions. Consistent with this, Rat1-ras cells displayed higher levels of HIF1-α protein under normoxic conditions. In addition, a promoter construct containing a 4-bp mutation in the HIF1 binding site showed lower activity in Rat1-ras cells than a construct with an intact HIF1 binding site. The activity of the latter construct but not the former could be down-regulated by RasN17, supporting the importance of the HIF1 binding site in regulation by Ras. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY29004 down-regulated glut1 promoter activity and mRNA levels under normoxia and also decreased HIF1α protein levels in these cells. Collectively these results indicate that H-Ras up-regulates theglut1 promoter, at least in part, by increasing HIF-1α protein levels leading to transactivation of promoter through the HIF-1 binding site.

An increased rate of glucose transport is among the most characteristic biochemical markers of the transformed phenotype. The Glut1 glucose transporter is one of the proteins responsible (reviewed in Ref. 2Mueckler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar). A number of oncogenes, including fps, src, and rashave been shown to increase glucose transport and to up-regulateglut1 mRNA and protein levels (3Flier J.S. Mueckler M.M. Usher P. Lodish H.F. Science. 1987; 235: 1492-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 4Birnbaum M.J. Haspel H.C. Rosen O.M. Science. 1987; 235: 1495-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 5Racker E.

Because hypoxia and oncogenic mutations are both commonly present in tumors, we set out to examine the interaction between the two in up-regulating glut1 mRNA levels. Mutations in Ras are seen in a third of human cancers (6Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, as our model system we used Rat1 fibroblasts transformed with H-ras. Transformation with H-ras led to a substantial increase in glut1mRNA levels under normoxic conditions and additively increasedglut1 mRNA levels in concert with hypoxia. Our results indicate that a HIF-1 binding site located in the glut1promoter is important in its regulation by Ras. We further show that oncogenic H-Ras leads to increased promoter activity by up-regulating the steady-state level of HIF-1α protein and that this involves the PI3K pathway, known to be downstream of Ras (7Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3557) Google Scholar). Rat1 cells were maintained in culture in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals) and cultured in a humidified 95% air/5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. To establish stable cell lines, Rat1 cells were transfected with an H-ras plasmid using Fugene (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, Rat1 cells were plated into a 100-mm dish 24 h before transfection. Cells were transfected using 6 μl of Fugene and 2 μg of the plasmid pAL8-H-ras, which contains the H-ras genomic DNA and a neomycin-resistance gene. Transfected cells were selected in DMEM supplemented with 400 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) for 1 week. Colonies were isolated using cloning cylinders, trypsinized, then expanded as cell lines. The expression of the H-ras gene was confirmed by Western blotting with an anti-H-Ras monoclonal antibody. Twelve G418-resistant colonies were expanded, all of which expressed high levels of H-Ras protein compared with the Rat1 parental cells. We used clone 12, which expressed approximately 10-fold the level of H-Ras as the parental Rat1 cells (data not shown) for most of our experiments. Rat1-ras cell lines were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 400 μg/ml G418. PD098059 and LY294002 (from Alexis Biochemicals, San Diego, CA) were dissolved in Me2SO at stock concentrations of 100 mm and 40 mm, respectively. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol (Life Technologies Inc.) following the manufacturer's instructions. 5–10 μg of total RNA was run on a 0.9% agarose gel containing formaldehyde, transferred to a Duralon-UV membrane (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), and UV cross-linked prior to hybridization. Labeling of radioactive DNA probes was performed using [32P]dCTP and a Prime-It kit (Stratagene). Hybridization was carried out at 65 °C, after which the membranes were washed to a stringency of 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. Autoradiography was carried out at −80 °C with intensifying screens. A 400-bp mouse glut1cDNA fragment (from M. Birnbaum, University of Pennsylvania) was used to make radioactive probes. For protein isolation, cells were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm EDTA, then solubilized by adding lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm orthovanadate, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) directly on the cells. Lysates were transferred into 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were transferred to a fresh tube and frozen on dry ice. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA Protein Assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). For Western blotting, an equal amount of total protein was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. After completion of gel electrophoresis, protein was transferred onto a Transblot nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) using a blotting apparatus. For detection of H-Ras protein, we used a anti-human H-Ras monoclonal antibody (Quality Biotech, Camden, NJ) at a dilution of 1:1000 followed by a secondary goat anti-mouse antibody (Bio-Rad) at a dilution of 1:2000. For detection of the HIF-1α protein, we used an anti-HIF-1α antibody (clone H1α67, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) at a dilution of 1:1000 followed by a secondary goat anti-mouse antibody (Bio-Rad). Antibody binding was detected by chemiluminescence using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). For hypoxia experiments, 5–7 × 105 cells were plated on day 1 into 60-mm Permanox dishes (Nunc) and maintained in a 5% CO2 incubator. Permanox plastic was used because of its high permeability to oxygen, permitting the efficient evacuation of oxygen from the dishes before hypoxia induction. On day 2, immediately before the induction of hypoxia, standard media was replaced with media containing 50 mmHEPES, 0.15% (w/v) glucose, and 10 mm NaOH to maintain pH. Dishes were then placed into airtight aluminum chambers. The oxygen concentration was decreased by sequentially replacing a given percentage of the total gas within a chamber with 95% nitrogen/5% CO2 using a precision vacuum gauge. The oxygen concentration was reduced from 21% to 5% with one gas exchange, from 5% to 1% with a second gas exchange, then with an additional gas exchange to 0.2%. The aluminum chambers were then placed on an orbital shaker in a warm room maintained at 37 °C. A series of constructs containing various fragments from the 5′-flanking region of the rat glut1 gene were used. Constructs A, C, E, and K are described elsewhere (8Murakami T. Nishiyama T. Shirotani T. Shinohara Y. Kan M. Ishii K. Kanai F. Nakazuru S. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9300-9306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 (see below), constructs A, C, and E contain, respectively, 6, 3.5, and 3 kbp of the 5′-flanking region of the rat glut1 gene. Construct K contains a 480-base pair sequence from the 5′-region of the rat glut1 promoter located at −3.5 to −3.0 kbp relative to the transcription start site (GenBank™ accession number U82755). This 480-bp enhancer contains a potential HIF-1 binding site at nucleotides +398 to +401. Construct N was made by PCR amplification in the following manner. The primer pair (1A, 5′-TAATAGGTACCCAACAGAGCCTTTTC-3′; 2B, 5′-TAATAGGCTAGCGAGCTCCCAGGAACTTG-3′) was used for amplifying using construct K as a template. Construct N contains 184 bp of theglut1 promoter located at approximately −3.2 to −3.0 kbp relative to the transcription start site (from nucleotides +297 to +480; GenBank™ accession number U82755). These primers were chosen to eliminate the SRE (at nucleotides +287 to +296), which has been shown to have a positive role in stimulation of the glut1 promoter (8Murakami T. Nishiyama T. Shirotani T. Shinohara Y. Kan M. Ishii K. Kanai F. Nakazuru S. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9300-9306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while retaining the potential HIF-1 binding site (nucleotides +398 to +401). Primer 1A has incorporated within it a KpnI restriction site and primer 2B an NheI restriction site, so the PCR product could be restricted with these two enzymes and subcloned into the KpnI/NheI sites of the reporter plasmid pGL3-Promoter. pGL3-Promoter contains its own SV-40 promoter, which was required because the fragment that was PCR-amplified lacks the glut1 TATA box and transcription start site. Construct M was made using a two-step overlapping PCR strategy. In step one, two separate pairs of primers were used in PCR amplification, primer 1A (listed above) and primer 1B, 5-TGCGTGTCAGCCAGACATCCTGTG-3′ in one reaction, and primer 2A, 5′CACAGGATGTCTGGCTGACACGCA-3′ and primer 2B (listed above) in the second. Primers 1B and 2A overlapped the HIF-1 binding site but introduced a 4-bp mutation, which isunderlined. After the first PCR amplification with these two sets of primers in separate reactions, the product was then amplified using primers 1A and 2B to generate a 184-bp fragment containing the desired mutation, which was restricted withKpnI/NheI and subcloned into the pGL3-Promoter vector. The amplified sequence is shown in Fig. 2 B (see below). For reporter gene assays, transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, cells were plated into 60-mm dishes so that 24 h later they were ∼50% confluent. Cells in each dish were transfected using 10–15 μl of LipofectAMINE, 2 μg of reporter plasmid, and 1 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase (Promega, Madison, WI) to control for transfection efficiency. 24 h later, cells were harvested by removing the media, washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and directly adding 100 μl of lysis buffer per dish. Of this lysate, an aliquot was used for luciferase assays and another aliquot for β-galactosidase determination. Luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed using the LucLite kit (Packard Instrument Co.) and the β-galactosidase Enzyme Assay System (Promega, Madison WI), respectively. Luciferase readings were performed on a TopCount Microplate scintillation and luminescence counter (Packard Instrument Co.). To examine how oncogenic transformation by human H-ras affects expression of the glut1 gene, we stably transfected Rat1 cells with an H-ras expression vector. We compared the expression of glut1 mRNA in Rat1 cells relative to Rat1-ras cells. Rat1 cells expressed very low levels of glut1 mRNA but exhibited a 2.8-fold increase in glut1 mRNA levels after 6 h of hypoxia (Fig.1; lanes 1 versus 3). In contrast, Rat1-ras cells exhibited increased levels of glut1 mRNA under normoxic conditions (2.5-fold over Rat1 cells; lanes 2 versus 1) and showed an additional 2-fold induction after 6 h of hypoxia (lanes 4 versus 2). Thus, H-ras overexpression both increases the basal level ofglut1 mRNA and interacts with hypoxia to additively increase the level of this message. Similar results were obtained using a second independent H-ras transformed subclone (data not shown). To investigate whether the increased expression of glut1mRNA by H-ras and hypoxia was due to increased promoter activity, we transfected a rat glut1 promoter-luciferase construct (construct A; “A” in Fig.2) into Rat1-ras and Rat1 cells. 24 h after transfection, half the dishes were subjected to hypoxia (0.2% oxygen) for 6 h and half were maintained in 21% oxygen. Subsequently cells from all the dishes were harvested and assayed for luciferase activity. In Rat1 cells there was a 2.2-fold induction of the glut1 promoter by hypoxia (Fig.3 A). Rat1-ras cells showed a 9-fold higher luciferase activity than Rat1 cells under normoxic conditions and exhibited a further 3.3-fold increase when exposed to hypoxia (Fig. 3 A). To demonstrate that theglut1 promoter activity in Rat1-ras cells was specifically due to the effect of H-Ras, we cotransfected a construct expressing dominant negative RasN17 into these cells, which resulted in a decrease in glut1 promoter activity (Fig. 3 B). Thus, the activity of the glut1 promoter is increased in Rat1-ras cells compared with Rat1 cells, and it can be further increased by hypoxia. To better characterize the elements in the 5′-flanking region of the ratglut1 gene responsive to H-Ras, a series of deletion mutants of the promoter was used in transient transfection experiments in both Rat1 and Rat1-ras cells under normoxia and hypoxia (Fig.4). glut1 promoter activity was weak in the Rat1 parental cells with all of the constructs tested. There was approximately a 2-fold induction of promoter activity by hypoxia with constructs A, C, and K, but only a 1.3-fold induction with construct E, which lacks a potential HIF-1 binding site. Similar to results shown in Fig. 3, in Rat1-ras cells, the basal level of glut1 promoter activity with construct A was 5-fold greater than in Rat1 cells, and hypoxia led to a 3.5-fold induction of activity compared with normoxia in Rat1-ras cells. Construct K gave a higher level of expression in Rat1-ras cells under normoxia or hypoxia that either construct A or C, possibly due to the fact that construct K contains a minimal c-fospromoter instead of the native glut1 TATA box and transcription start site found in constructs A and C. The basal level of expression of construct E was higher in Rat1-ras cells than Rat1 cells; the reason for this is unknown. However, as expected, there was no significant induction of the glut1 promoter activity by hypoxia with construct E in Rat1-ras cells. Theglut1 promoter is known to contain a HIF-1 binding site, which is required for its transactivation by hypoxia through the transcription factor HIF-1 (9Ebert B.L. Firth J.D. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29083-29089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). To test whether this site is important for transactivation of the promoter by H-Ras under normoxic conditions we made a pair of reporter constructs, construct N, which contains 184 bp of the promoter, including the HIF-1 binding site, and construct M, which is identical except for a 4-bp mutation, which abolishes the HIF-1 binding site (Fig. 2). As expected, construct N (Fig.5 A) but not construct M (Fig.5 B) was inducible by hypoxia. We performed transient transfections of both constructs into Rat1-ras cells with and without cotransfection of a dominant negative RasN17 expression vector. Fig. 5 C shows that the basal promoter activity using construct M, which has a mutated HIF-1 binding site, was 37% less than that of construct N, which has an intact HIF-1 binding site. In two additional independent experiments we found the promoter activity of construct M to be 27 and 33% less than the activity of construct N (data not shown). Fig. 5 C also shows that promoter activity is inhibited by ∼40% in cells cotransfected with construct N and RasN17, whereas RasN17 had no effect on luciferase expression in cells transfected with construct M. These results support the premise that H-Ras exerts a positive effect on the glut1 promoter transcription through the HIF-1 binding site. Having found that the HIF-1 binding site in theglut1 promoter was important for its regulation by H-Ras, we speculated that H-Ras might increase the level of the HIF-1α protein. We found that Rat1-ras cells contained higher levels of the protein under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions than did Rat1 cells (Fig. 6). This figure also shows that cobalt chloride, which is a hypoxia mimic, leads to higher steady-state levels of HIF-1α in Rat1-ras cells than Rat1 cells. Both the PI3K and MAP kinase pathways have been show to be activated by Ras (7Schlessinger J. Cell. 2000; 103: 211-225Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3557) Google Scholar). Therefore, to define the signal transduction pathways through which expression of Glut1 is regulated by Ras, we transiently transfected cells with glut1promoter/luciferase constructs (either construct A or K), then treated them with either a PI3K inhibitor (LY294002) or an inhibitor of MAP kinase (PD098059) under normoxic or hypoxic conditions before harvesting cells for luciferase assays. PD098059 and LY294002 both down-regulated glut1 promoter activity using construct A in Rat-ras cells under normoxic conditions, and both inhibited the induction of glut1 mRNA by hypoxia (Fig.7). Similar results were obtained using construct K (Fig. 7). Therefore, both PI3K and MAP kinase inhibition have a negative effect on the glut1 promoter. To determine whether they have an effect on glut1 mRNA levels, Rat1-ras cells were treated with either inhibitor under normoxic or hypoxic conditions before harvesting cells for RNA. Under normoxic conditions, treatment with either inhibitor led to a decrease in glut1 mRNA levels (Fig. 8; compare lanes 3 and 4 with lane 2), and treatment with both drugs led to a greater decrease in the level (Fig. 8; comparelane 5 with 2). We also treated Rat1-ras cells with bisindolylmaleimide I, a protein kinase C inhibitor, and found that this had no effect on VEGF mRNA levels (data not shown). We then treated Rat1-ras cells with the inhibitors prior to exposure to hypoxia. Neither drug alone had a detectable effect on glut1 message level (Fig. 8; comparelanes 8 or 9 with lane 7); however, using both drugs together reduced glut1 mRNA levels by ∼30% (Fig. 8; compare lane 10 with lane 7). To determine whether the effect of PD098059 and LY294002 in decreasingglut1 mRNA levels in normoxia might be mediated through HIF-1α, we examined HIF-1α levels in Rat1-ras cells after drug treatment. Fig. 9 shows that treatment with LY294002 led to a decrease in the level of HIF-1α, whereas treatment with PD098059 had no such effect. Two additional independent experiments confirmed this result (data not shown). For decades it has been known that tumors display numerous metabolic changes compared with normal cells. Tumors frequently display increased glycolytic metabolism even under aerobic conditions, an effect named after Warburg who originally described it (10Warburg O. The Metabolism of Tumors. Constable and Co., London1930Google Scholar). To keep up with this increased glycolysis, there must be an increased uptake of the substrate, glucose. Human tumors have been shown to have increased glucose uptake in vivo compared with normal tissues (see Ref. 11Holm E. Hagmuller E. Staedt U. Schlickeiser G. Gunther H.J. Leweling H. Tokus M. Kollmar H.B. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1373-1378PubMed Google Scholar and references within). One of the proteins responsible for the uptake of glucose into cells is Glut1, which was the first of a family of glucose transporters to be cloned (12Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. Lodish H.F. Science. 1985; 229: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1149) Google Scholar). Glut1 is expressed in most normal tissues and is responsible for basal glucose transport. Numerous factors have been shown to regulate glut1 mRNA expression, including phorbol esters, oncogenes, hypoxia, growth factors, and mitogens (reviewed in Refs. 2Mueckler M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 219: 713-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar and 13Merrall N.W. Plevin R. Gould G.W. Cell. Signalling. 1993; 5: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Over a decade ago it was observed that transformation of rodent fibroblasts by Fujiyama sarcoma virus (4Birnbaum M.J. Haspel H.C. Rosen O.M. Science. 1987; 235: 1495-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) or by the ras or src oncogenes (3Flier J.S. Mueckler M.M. Usher P. Lodish H.F. Science. 1987; 235: 1492-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar) resulted in a marked increase in glucose uptake, which was accompanied by an increase in Glut1 protein and mRNA expression. In the case of Fujiyama sarcoma virus, it was shown that the increase inglut1 mRNA occurred at the level of transcription (4Birnbaum M.J. Haspel H.C. Rosen O.M. Science. 1987; 235: 1495-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Glut1 levels have been found to be increased in a variety of human cancers (14Younes M. Lechago L.V. Somoano J.R. Mosharaf M. Lechago J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1164-1167PubMed Google Scholar, 15Yamamoto T. Seino Y. Fukumoto H. Koh G. Yano H. Inagaki N. Yamada Y. Inoue K. Manabe T. Imura H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 170: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). One study found that Glut1 expression increased with increasing grade of malignancy in human colon cancers and was associated with a higher proportion of lymph node metastases (14Younes M. Lechago L.V. Somoano J.R. Mosharaf M. Lechago J. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1164-1167PubMed Google Scholar). Cells subjected to hypoxia must undergo metabolic adaptations to survive. Hypoxia induces the expression of many genes to allow for this to occur (reviewed in Refs. 16Semenza G.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 88: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar and 17Zhu H. Bunn H.F. Respir. Physiol. 1999; 115: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Part of this adaptation to hypoxia involves up-regulation of genes that encode the enzymes required for anaerobic glycolysis, thus allowing cells to switch to this form of metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation. Under hypoxic conditions there is also a parallel increase in glucose uptake, which is facilitated by up-regulation of Glut1 expression. Hypoxia is a potent stimulus for glut1 mRNA induction in a variety of tissue types, including endothelial cells (18Loike J.D. Cao L. Brett J. Ogawa S. Silverstein S.C. Stern D. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C326-C333Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), hepatic cells (19Behrooz A. Ismail-Beigi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5555-5562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), various tumor cell lines (9Ebert B.L. Firth J.D. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29083-29089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), and alveolar epithelial cells (20Ouiddir A. Planes C. Fernandes I. VanHesse A. Clerici C. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 21: 710-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The mechanism of glut1 message induction by hypoxia is complicated and is dually controlled by low oxygen concentrationsper se and by inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation (19Behrooz A. Ismail-Beigi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5555-5562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The former can be mimicked by cobalt chloride and the latter by sodium azide. The cobalt-responsive element in the rat glut1promoter has been mapped and is homologous to the mouse Enhancer-1 sequence (9Ebert B.L. Firth J.D. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29083-29089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar, 19Behrooz A. Ismail-Beigi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5555-5562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Transactivation through this element in the promoter is mediated by HIF-1 (9Ebert B.L. Firth J.D. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29083-29089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar) a heterodimeric transcription factor that binds to a specific DNA consensus sequence, 5′-RCGTG-3′, found in the promoters of many hypoxia-inducible genes (for review see Ref. 16Semenza G.L. J. Appl. Physiol. 2000; 88: 1474-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1503) Google Scholar). The HIF-1 transcription factor consists of two subunits, HIF-1α and HIF-1β, both of which are basic helix-loop-helix proteins. HIF-1β is a component of several transcription factors, and its protein level is not significantly induced by hypoxia. In contrast, HIF-1α protein, which is unique to the HIF-1 complex, is rapidly degraded in oxygenated cells by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (21Huang L.E. Gu J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). HIF-1α protein is specifically induced by hypoxia in a graded response dependent on the oxygen concentration (22Jiang B.H. Semenza G.L. Bauer C. Marti H.H. Am. J.

Although the mechanism by which hypoxia increases glut1mRNA expression through HIF-1 is relatively well understood, it is less clear how oncogenes such as Ras increase glut1 mRNA levels. The phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, which activates protein kinase C, is known to increase glut1 mRNA levels (23Hiraki Y. Rosen O.M. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13655-13662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); however, Glut1 induction by growth factors and oncogenes such as K-ras occurs via a protein kinase C-independent pathway (23Hiraki Y. Rosen O.M. Birnbaum M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13655-13662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,24Hiraki Y. McMorrow I.M. Birnbaum M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1989; 3: 1470-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). We were interested in understanding how a specific oncogene, mutant H-ras, led to increased glut1 mRNA levels and in studying its interaction with hypoxia in regulating message expression. For our model system we used Rat1 cells transformed with this oncogene. We found that H-ras transformation increased the basal level of glut1 mRNA under normoxia compared with Rat1 cells, consistent with what others have found using other oncogenes (3Flier J.S. Mueckler M.M. Usher P. Lodish H.F. Science. 1987; 235: 1492-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 4Birnbaum M.J. Haspel H.C. Rosen O.M. Science. 1987; 235: 1495-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). We also found that H-ras interacts additively with hypoxia to increase mRNA expression (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the effect of Ras on glut1 mRNA levels is mediated at the level of the promoter, since the promoter activity is greater in Rat1-ras cells than in Rat1 cells (Fig.3 A). In analyzing the 5′-flanking region of the glut1 gene using deletion constructs in transient transfection experiments, we found that construct K, which contains a HIF-1 binding site, was sufficient to mediate up-regulation of promoter activity by H-ras. However, construct K contains a 480-base pair sequence from the 5′-region of the rat glut1 promoter located between −3.5 and −3.0 kbp relative to the transcription start site. In addition to a HIF-1 binding site (nucleotides +398 to +401; GenBank™ accession numberU82755), this 480-bp stretch contains sites for several other transcription factors, including AP-1 binding sites (at nucleotides +248 to +254 and +320 to +327) and an SRE (at nucleotides +287 to +296), which have been previously implicated in the regulation of this promoter (8Murakami T. Nishiyama T. Shirotani T. Shinohara Y. Kan M. Ishii K. Kanai F. Nakazuru S. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9300-9306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to rigorously test the importance of the HIF-1 binding site, we created reporter constructs M and N, neither of which contain the SRE. These constructs contain 184 bp of theglut1 promoter located from approximately −3.2 to −3.0 kb relative to the transcription start site (from nucleotide +297 to +480; GenBank™ accession number U82755). Constructs M and N are identical except that the former contains a 4-base pair mutation of the HIF-1 binding site. Therefore, as expected, construct N was inducible by hypoxia, but not construct M. Both constructs showed activity in Rat1-ras cells under normoxic conditions, but a key difference is that the activity of construct N, but not construct M, could be down-regulated by mutant RasN17. Therefore, this strongly suggests the HIF-1 binding site is important in regulation by H-Ras. Construct M also exhibited lower basal luciferase activity in Rat1-ras cells than did construct N, between 25 and 40% less. We speculate that the reason that the difference is not greater is because both of these constructs (M and N) are driven by an SV40 minimal promoter rather than the TATA box intrinsic to theglut1 promoter; therefore, there is a high basal level of activity. The 480-bp sequence for the rat glut1 5′-region shows significant homology to the 5′-Enhancer-1 region of the mouseglut1 gene that was cloned by Murakami et al.(8Murakami T. Nishiyama T. Shirotani T. Shinohara Y. Kan M. Ishii K. Kanai F. Nakazuru S. Ebina Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9300-9306Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This group found that the mouse glut1 Enhancer-1 was inducible by H-Ras. They showed that the SRE and two AP-1 sites within this enhancer were important in promoter activity, although they did not specifically examine the role that these sites played in regulation by Ras. However, they found that these three elements were insufficient for full basal activity of Enhancer-1. Subsequently, the HIF-1 binding site within the mouse glut1 Enhancer-1 was identified (9Ebert B.L. Firth J.D. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29083-29089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that this HIF-1 binding site is important in the regulation of the rat glut1 promoter by H-Ras. Of note, activation of the mouse glut1 promoter by oxidative stress in L6 myotubes was shown to involve both the SRE and the AP-1 binding sites in Enhancer-1 but was independent of the Ras/MAP kinase pathway (25Kozlovsky N. Rudich A. Potashnik R. Ebina Y. Murakami T. Bashan N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33367-33372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). How does H-Ras regulate activity of the HIF-1 binding site in theglut1 promoter? One mechanism is by increasing the level of HIF-1α protein. Rat1-ras cells contain higher levels of the protein than do Rat1 cells under both hypoxic and normoxic conditions. Although HIF-1α was originally described as a transcription factor, which was undetectable under normoxic conditions and inducible only under hypoxia (26Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5105) Google Scholar), there is accumulating evidence that it is also important in gene regulation under normoxic conditions.Src-transformed cells have been found to contain higher levels of HIF-1α under normoxic conditions than nontransformed parental cells (27Jiang B.H. Agani F. Passaniti A. Semenza G.L. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5328-5335PubMed Google Scholar). HIF-1α has been found to be induced in tumor cell lines by a variety of hormones and growth factors, including epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, insulin, and angiotensin II (28Richard D.E. Berra E. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26765-26771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Zhong H. Chiles K. Feldser D. Laughner E. Hanrahan C. Georgescu M.M. Simons J.W.

Both inhibitors of the MAP kinase and the PI3K pathways led to decreased glut1 promoter activity and glut1mRNA levels under normoxia. In contrast, neither drug by itself appeared to block the induction of glut1 mRNA by hypoxia, although the two together did have an inhibitory effect. This apparent discrepancy between the effects of these inhibitors onglut1 message under normoxia and hypoxia might be explained by the fact that the induction of glut1 mRNA by hypoxia involves mRNA stabilization in addition to transactivation of the promoter (19Behrooz A. Ismail-Beigi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5555-5562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Therefore, in transfection experiments using promoter constructs, we are specifically examining transcriptional regulation, whereas in the Northern blots, the results are complicated by the fact that RNA stabilization, which may be independent of PI3K and MAP kinase, also plays a role. Even though we found that both MAP kinase and PI3K inhibitors decreasedglut1 mRNA promoter activity, only the latter led to a detectable decrease in HIF-1α protein levels. A possible role for the PI3K pathway in regulating HIF-1α protein levels has been suggested in the context of PTEN expression in glioblastoma cells (32Zundel W. Schindler C. Haas-Kogan D. Koong A. Kaper F. Chen E. Gottschalk A.R. Ryan H.E. Johnson R.S. Jefferson A.B. Stokoe D. Giaccia A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 391-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and epidermal growth factor stimulation in prostate carcinoma cells (29Zhong H. Chiles K. Feldser D. Laughner E. Hanrahan C. Georgescu M.M. Simons J.W. Semenza G.L. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 1541-1545PubMed Google Scholar). In regard to MAP kinase, both p42 and p44 MAP kinase have been shown to phosphorylate HIF-1α in vitro and to stimulate HIF-1α transcription activity without affecting the level of the protein (33Richard D.E. Berra E. Gothie E. Roux D. Pouyssegur J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32631-32637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that the drug PD098059 might decreaseglut1 mRNA levels and promoter activity through an effect on HIF-1α function without affecting the level of the protein itself. Our results suggest a link between H-ras transformation, HIF-1α up-regulation, and glut1 mRNA transactivation. In the future we plan to pursue this path of investigation to understand how H-Ras leads to HIF-1α up-regulation. Although we have examined the expression of a specific gene, glut1, as a downstream target of H-Ras, it is likely that the up-regulation of other hypoxia-inducible genes such as VEGF occurs by a similar mechanism. A number of groups have shown that mutant Ras leads to increased VEGF levels in diverse cell types (34Grugel S. Finkenzeller G. Weindel K. Barleon B. Marme D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25915-25919Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 35Mazure N.M. Chen E.Y. Yeh P. Laderoute K.R. Giaccia A.J.

In NIH3T3 cells, activated H-Ras has been postulated to increase VEGF reporter expression only when an intact HIF-1 binding site is present (37Mazure N.M. Chen E.Y. Laderoute K.R. Giaccia A.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 3322-3331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, mutations in H-ras can not only lead to transformation but may also help cells survive in a hypoxic environment by increasing the expression of specific genes through up-regulation of HIF-1α.

After tyrosine phosphorylation IRS is recognized by Src homology 2 domain-containing proteins for metabolic and glucose transport control, or activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathway and mitogenic control (1White M.F.

In type 2 diabetes target cells of the hormone are not fully responsive, which is compensated temporarily by enhanced insulin secretion. The pathogenic mechanisms for this insulin resistance are not known, but an important common feature appears to be a reduced activation/tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 (5Virkamäki A. Ueki K. Kahn C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar). The insulin receptors are sequestered in the caveolae microdomains of the plasma membrane in adipocytes, and caveolae appear to be critical for insulin control (6Gustavsson J. Parpal S. Karlsson M.

By thin-section electron microscopy, caveolae appear as omega-shaped invaginations of 50–100 nm diameter in the plasma membrane (7Westermann M. Leutbecher H. Meyer H.W. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1999; 111: 71-81Google Scholar). Caveolae invaginations are found in the plasma membrane of many cell types, but are particularly abundant in adipocytes where they increase in number in conjunction with the differentiation of 3T3-L1 fibroblasts to mature adipocytes (8Fan J.Y. Carpentier J.-L. Obberghen E.v. Grunfeld C. Gorden P. Orci L. J. Cell Sci. 1983; 61: 219-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Kandror K.V. Stephens J.M. Pilch P.F. J.

A number of proteins, in addition to the insulin receptor, involved in signal transduction are localized to caveolae, which suggests that they may be involved in cellular signaling and control (reviewed in Refs. 13Anderson R.G.W.

Caveolae are rich in cholesterol and sphingolipids. Caveolae may indeed form from cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich rafts in the membrane in a process requiring the caveolae-specific structural protein caveolin. Caveolin is found in the plasma membrane and intracellularly, but in the plasma membrane is confined to caveolae; it is therefore used as a marker for these structures. The function of caveolae is dependent on a sufficient level of cholesterol in the plasma membrane and caveolae (12Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Pinney E. Allard J. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 1217-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (772) Google Scholar, 17Chang W.-J. Rothberg K.G. Kamen B.A. Anderson R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated a critical dependence of the insulin receptor signal transduction on cholesterol; depletion of cholesterol from the plasma membrane of rat adipocytes reversibly inhibited insulin stimulation of glucose transport and metabolic protein phosphorylation control (6Gustavsson J.

The importance of caveolae for insulin receptor signaling is further indicated by a consensus binding site for interaction with caveolin (18Couet J. Li S. Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Lisanti M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6525-6533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), and coprecipitation of the receptor with caveolin (4Nyström F.H. Chen H. Cong L.-N. Li Y. Quon M.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2013-2024Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicates that the interaction may be physiological. Moreover, the insulin receptor appears to phosphorylate caveolin (19Mastick C.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20706-20714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), whereas caveolin was shown to activate the isolated receptor, although the physiological relevance of this is not known (20Yamamoto M.

Herein we examine in detail the dependence of the insulin receptor on caveolae for signal transduction: the effects of cholesterol depletion on plasma membrane and caveolae morphology, on the insulin receptor and on the downstream propagation of the insulin signal. In short, the insulin receptor is unaffected, but interaction with the immediate downstream mediator molecule IRS-1 and metabolic control is inhibited by cholesterol depletion and caveolae destruction, while insulin signaling via the MAP kinase pathway remains intact.

The homogenate was then adjusted to 45% sucrose in 12 mm Mes, pH 6.5, 75 mm NaCl, 0.25m Na2CO3 and loaded under a 5–35% discontinuous sucrose gradient in the same buffer solution and centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 16–20 h in a SW41 rotor (Beckman Instruments). The light-scattering band, enriched in caveolae, at the 5–35% sucrose interface was collected. Enrichment of caveolae was demonstrated by the enrichment of caveolin (7-fold) and cholesterol (3-fold) compared with the intact plasma membrane fraction; by electron microscopy and immunogold labeling of caveolin, between 50% and 70% of the isolated membranes constituted caveolae (6Gustavsson J. Parpal S. Karlsson M. Ramsing C. Thorn H. Borg M. Lindroth M. Peterson K.H. Magnusson K.-E. Strålfors P. FASEB. J. 1999; 13: 1961-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). For insulin treatment of isolated caveolae, the caveolae-enriched fraction was suspended in the Krebs-Ringer Hepes-buffered cell incubation medium (above) with 0.01% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm NaF, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm ATP. Insulin or vehicle was added as indicated and the suspension sonicated with the probe sonifier five times for 3 s each time (the sonication was necessary, presumably for insulin to gain access to the interior of caveolae vesicles) on ice, and then incubated for 10 min at 37 °C. Equal amounts of caveolae protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Total cell protein was prepared for SDS-PAGE as described (23Strålfors P. Honnor R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar); cells were immediately spun through dinonylphthalate and frozen. The cell cake was thawed by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample solution (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207129) Google Scholar). IRS-1 tyrosine-specific phosphorylation, phosphoprotein kinase B, or phospho-ERK1/2 was thus determined by immunoblotting after SDS-PAGE of total cell protein (23Strålfors P. Honnor R.C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 182: 379-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of cells were loaded within each experiment. For immunoprecipitation cells were rapidly rinsed in Krebs-Ringer solution without serum albumin (with or without insulin). Cells were lysed in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 2 mm Na3VO4, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μm aprotinin, 1 μm pepstatin, 10 μm leupeptin, 1% Nonidet P-40 with or without 100 μm genistein (Calbiochem). The solubilized cell lysate was filtered through a 0.22-μm pore size filter to remove fat. Equal amounts of protein were incubated with antibodies for 14 h at 4 °C, when Sepharose G-Plus (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added for 1 h at 4 °C with constant mixing (turning over). The beads were washed and boiled with SDS-PAGE sample solution and subjected to SDS-PAGE. After SDS-PAGE (7–11% acrylamide), separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride blotting membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) (27Gustavsson J. Parpal S. Strålfors P. Mol. Med. 1996; 2: 367-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and then incubated with indicated antibodies. Bound antibodies were detected according to the ECL+ protocol and reagents from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech or Renaissance+ from PerkinElmer Life Sciences, using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG as secondary antibodies. Blots were quantitated by chemiluminescence imaging (Las 1000, Fuji, Japan) and Image Gauge software (Fuji). Total and phosphoamino acid-specific phosphorylation of IRS-1 was determined after immunoprecipitation of IRS-1 from cells preincubated with [32P]phosphate for 1 h (28Alemany S. Mato J.M. Strålfors P. Nature. 1987; 330: 77-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid identification was by electrophoresis on thin-layer silica plates at pH 1.9 (29Strålfors P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1988; 171: 199-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) after partial acid hydrolysis in 5.7 m HCl at 110 °C for 2 h, using authentic internal standards (Sigma) that were identified by ninhydrin staining. Glucose transport was determined in 3T3-L1 adipocytes as uptake of 2-deoxy-d-[1-3H]glucose (21Frost S.C. Kohanski R.A. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9872-9876Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown on 13-mm plastic coverslips (Thermanox coverslips, Nunc Inc., Copenhagen, Denmark) in 24-well culture dishes. 2-Deoxy-d-[1-3H]glucose was added to a final concentration of 50 μm (0.3 μCi/ml), and the cells were incubated for 9 min. Glucose uptake was stopped by rinsing the coverslips in three successive solutions of ice-cold buffer. Nonspecific uptake was determined in the presence of 25 μm cytochalasin B. Coverslips were transferred to scintillation vials and the cells were dissolved in 1% SDS. Radioactivity was measured after adding 5 ml of scintillant (Ready Gel, Beckman). For determination of cholesterol content, membranes were pelleted and lipids were extracted with 2-propanol. Cholesterol was then quantitated spectrofluorometrically by measuring the amount of H2O2 produced by cholesterol oxidase (30Heider J.G. Boyett R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 515-518Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Protein was determined by Coomassie Blue binding (31Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216033) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Here we in detail examine effects of cholesterol depletion on caveolar structure in relation to insulin signaling. We have chosen to study cultured 3T3-L1 adipocytes because their plasma membranes can be prepared intact for electron microscopic examination (6Gustavsson J. Parpal S. Karlsson M. Ramsing C. Thorn H. Borg M. Lindroth M. Peterson K.H. Magnusson K.-E. Strålfors P. FASEB. J. 1999; 13: 1961-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Incubation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes with increasing concentrations of β-cyclodextrin in a dose-dependent manner reduced the cholesterol content of the plasma membrane (Fig.1). Concomitantly the structural integrity of caveolae in the plasma membrane was progressively corrupted, as revealed by transmission electron microscopy of isolated plasma membranes (Fig. 2). Control membranes incubated with vehicle typically displayed an abundance of caveolar structures of 50–100 nm diameter (Fig. 2 a), identified by labeling with antibodies against the caveolar structural protein caveolin (6Gustavsson J. Parpal S. Karlsson M. Ramsing C. Thorn H. Borg M. Lindroth M. Peterson K.H. Magnusson K.-E. Strålfors P. FASEB. J. 1999; 13: 1961-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Incubation with 2 mm β-cyclodextrin had no visible effect on caveolar morphology (data not shown), whereas 5 mm β-cyclodextrin was seen to clearly have an effect on the caveolae, which became flattened, less distinct, and reduced in number (Fig. 2 b; cf. Refs. 32Rothberg K.G. Heuser J.E. Donzell W.C. Ying Y.-S. Glenney J.R. Anderson R.G.W. Cell. 1992; 68: 673-682Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1866) Google Scholar and 33Fujimoto T. Fujimoto K. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 595-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). At 10 mm β-cyclodextrin, caveolae invaginations have almost vanished and may be discerned as minor irregular structures at the membrane surface (Fig. 2 c); after 20 mmβ-cyclodextrin treatment, no invaginations were seen (data not shown).Figure 2Effect of cholesterol depletion on caveolar structure in the plasma membrane. 3T3-L1 adipocytes were incubated with 0 (a), 5 mm (b), or 10 mm (c) β-cyclodextrin for 50 min, when cells were prepared for transmission electron microscopy as under “Experimental Procedures.” Arrows indicate insulin receptor labeling. Scale bars = 100 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Immunogold labeling of caveolin showed that the caveolin protein remained clustered, indicating that underlying caveolar structures existed in the membrane after 50% reduction of the amount of plasma membrane cholesterol by treatment of the cells with 10 mmβ-cyclodextrin (Fig. 2 c), perhaps reflecting flattened caveolar patches or “rafts” remaining in the membrane after the extensive but partial cholesterol depletion (34Anderson R.G.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 199-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (1725) Google Scholar). The cholesterol depletion concomitantly also inhibited progressively the ability of insulin to enhance glucose uptake (Fig.3 a). The extent of insulin stimulation of glucose transport was correlated to the amount of cholesterol, and hence to degree of caveolar intactness, in the plasma membrane of the cells (Fig. 3 b). By immunogold labeling and electron microscopy examination, it appeared that the insulin receptors remained associated with the caveolin clusters and hence with the underlying caveolar remains or rafts after the depletion of cholesterol (Fig. 2). This was affirmed by immunoprecipitation of the insulin receptor, which coprecipitated caveolin to the same extent with or without prior cholesterol depletion (data not shown). We used competitive125I-insulin binding to isolated rat adipocytes to determine the effect of cholesterol depletion on the accessibility of insulin receptors at the cell surface (Fig.4). Cholesterol depletion (with 10 mm β-cyclodextrin, which reduced plasma membrane cholesterol concentration by ∼60% (Ref. 6Gustavsson J. Parpal S. Karlsson M. Ramsing C. Thorn H. Borg M. Lindroth M. Peterson K.H. Magnusson K.-E. Strålfors P. FASEB. J. 1999; 13: 1961-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar)) did not affect the time taken for steady state binding of insulin (Fig. 4 a). We subsequently incubated the cells with 125I-insulin for 30 min when near-maximal binding was obtained. Specific insulin binding was not affected by prior cholesterol depletion (Fig. 4 b). We used nonlinear regression to fit a one-site binding equation (GraphPad Software, Inc.) to the data in Fig. 4 b, to determine the effect on number of insulin receptors and on the dissociation constant for insulin binding. Neither the number of receptors nor the binding affinity was significantly affected by the cholesterol depletion. After subcellular fractionation of rat adipocytes and isolation of the plasma membranes, SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with antibodies against the insulin receptor indicated that the total amount of receptor protein in the plasma membrane fraction was not affected by the 10 mm β-cyclodextrin treatment (Fig.5 a). This agrees well with the electron microscopy and 125I-insulin binding results. Similarly, the amount of caveolin in the plasma membrane fraction was not affected by treatment with up to 10 mm β-cyclodextrin (Fig. 5 b), also in agreement with the electron microscopic findings. The β-cyclodextrin depletion of cholesterol from the isolated rat adipocytes did not affect the ability of subsequent insulin treatment to stimulate tyrosine-specific receptor autophosphorylation (Fig. 6 a). Nor did 10 mm β-cyclodextrin extraction of cholesterol from the isolated caveolae preparation affect the subsequent ability of insulin to stimulate receptor autophosphorylation in the caveolae fraction (Fig. 6 b). We concluded that cholesterol depletion does not adversely affect the number of insulin receptors at the cell surface, the insulin receptor's interaction with or activation by insulin, or its ability to autophosphorylate. We therefore next examined the ability of the receptor to tyrosine phosphorylate an immediate downstream target for insulin's metabolic control, IRS-1. After cholesterol depletion of rat adipocytes, the tyrosine-specific phosphorylation of IRS-1 in response to insulin treatment was severely reduced (Fig. 7). The depletion of cholesterol inhibited the 1 nm insulin-stimulated increase in IRS-1 phosphorylation by 71 ± 6% (mean ± S.E.,n = 10). Cholesterol or intact caveolae are apparently required for signal transfer from the insulin receptor to IRS-1. As an expected consequence of the inhibition of IRS-1 phosphorylation, cholesterol depletion also completely blocked insulin stimulation to phosphorylation/activation of the further downstream protein kinase B (Akt) (Fig. 8).Figure 8Effects of cholesterol depletion on insulin stimulation of protein kinase B phosphorylation. Isolated rat adipocytes were incubated without or with 10 mmβ-cyclodextrin for 50 min when the cells were incubated with or without 1 nm insulin for another 10 min. After SDS-PAGE the state of protein kinase Bα phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting with antibodies against the phosphorylated form of the protein. The experiment has been repeated three times with the same result.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) It has been suggested that serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 acts to inhibit the insulin receptor (35Hotamisligil G.S.

Both can stimulate chemotaxis and promote proliferation in endothelial cells and fibroblasts in culture and induce neovascularization in vivo. Encoded by inducible immediate early genes, Cyr61 and CTGF are synthesized upon growth factor stimulation in cultured fibroblasts and during cutaneous wound healing in dermal fibroblasts. Recently, we have shown that adhesion of primary human fibroblasts to immobilized Cyr61 is mediated through integrin α6β1 and cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) (Chen, N., Chen, C.-C., and Lau, L.F.

We show in this study that CTGF also mediates fibroblast adhesion through the same mechanism and demonstrate that fibroblasts adhesion to immobilized Cyr61 or CTGF induces distinct adhesive signaling responses consistent with their biological activities. Compared with fibroblast adhesion to fibronectin, laminin, or type I collagen, cell adhesion to Cyr61 or CTGF induces 1) more extensive and prolonged formation of filopodia and lamellipodia, concomitant with formation of integrin α6β1-containing focal complexes localized at leading edges of pseudopods; 2) activation of intracellular signaling molecules including focal adhesion kinase, paxillin, and Rac with similar rapid kinetics; 3) sustained activation of p42/p44 MAPKs lasting for at least 9 h; and 4) prolonged gene expression changes including up-regulation of MMP-1 (collagenase-1) and MMP-3 (stromelysin-1) mRNAs and proteins sustained for at least 24 h. Together, these results establish Cyr61 and CTGF as bona fide adhesive substrates with specific signaling capabilities, provide a molecular basis for their activities in fibroblasts through integrin α6β1 and HSPG-mediated signaling during attachment and indicate that these proteins may function in matrix remodeling through the activation of metalloproteinases during angiogenesis and wound healing.

The recent emergence of the CCN family of angiogenic regulators has called attention to their functional versatility and mechanisms of actions (1Lau L.F. Lam S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). This family of secreted proteins consists of six members:Cyr61,CTGF1,Nov, WISP-1, WISP-2, and WISP-3 (1Lau L.F. Lam S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 2Brigstock D.R. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 189-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar), with the first three members of the family identified providing the acronym CCN. These structurally conserved proteins share four modular domains with sequence similarities to insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins, von Willebrand factor type C repeat, thrombospondin type 1 repeat, and growth factor cysteine knots (1Lau L.F. Lam S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 3Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 327: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). Each of these domains is encoded by a separate exon, suggesting that CCN genes arose through exon shuffling of preexisting genes to form proteins with multiple functional domains. Cyr61 and CTGF are both encoded by immediate early genes and are coinduced by serum, bFGF, platelet-derived growth factor, and TGF-β1 in fibroblasts (4O'Brien T.P. Yang G.P. Sanders L. Lau L.F. Mol.

Thus, Cyr61 and CTGF may participate in wound repair by acting as angiogenic inducers upon endothelial cells and by acting as chemotactic, proliferative, and matrix remodeling factors upon fibroblasts. Through what mechanism(s) might Cyr61 and CTGF act to execute such a diversity of biological functions? Inasmuch as CTGF was first identified as a growth factor (8Bradham D.M. Igarashi A. Potter R.L. Grotendorst G.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 1285-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), it has been tempting to postulate that it might function as a classical growth factor, although a cell surface receptor for CTGF that resembles a classical growth factor receptor has not been identified to date. By contrast, both Cyr61 and CTGF share characteristics of ECM-associated signaling proteins in several compelling ways (1Lau L.F. Lam S.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 44-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar, 22Bornstein P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar): 1) they are heparin-binding, ECM-associated proteins; 2) they contain sequence similarities to matrix proteins including von Willebrand factor and thrombospondin; and 3) they regulate cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, differentiation, and survival, all functions that can be modulated through cell and matrix interactions, especially through integrin receptors (23Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar, 24Hynes R.O. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Indeed, we have demonstrated that Cyr61 and CTGF are ligands of, and bind directly to, the integrins αVβ3 and αIIbβ3(25Kireeva M.L. Lam S.C.T. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3090-3096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 26Jedsadayanmata A. Chen C.C. Kireeva M.L. Lau L.F. Lam S.C. J. Biol.

Recently, we showed that Cyr61 supports the attachment, or the early phase of cell adhesion, of human skin fibroblasts through integrin α6β1 and HSPGs (27Chen N. Chen C.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24953-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To understand their mechanism of actions, we have investigated the cellular responses to and signaling consequences of cell adhesion to immobilized Cyr61 and CTGF. We present herein the first conclusive evidence that Cyr61 and CTGF function as adhesive signaling molecules. In the absence of any other stimulus, fibroblast adhesion to either protein is sufficient to generate signaling events resulting in morphological changes, activation of intracellular kinases, and activation of gene expression consistent with the biological activities of these CCN proteins. These findings establish Cyr61 and CTGF as inducible, ECM-associated adhesive substrates capable of signaling through integrin-mediated pathways, provide a mechanistic interpretation for the chemotactic and mitogenic activities of these proteins, point to unique signaling capabilities of integrin α6β1 and HSPGs, and indicate a potential function for Cyr61 and CTGF in matrix remodeling through the activation of metalloproteinases during angiogenesis and wound healing. Normal human fibroblasts (1064SK) from skin biopsy of healthy newborn were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC; number CRL-2076).

Briefly, 96-well microtiter plates (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were coated with test proteins diluted in PBS (137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mmKCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.4 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.3) at 50 μl/well, incubated at 4 °C for 16 h, and blocked with 1% BSA at room temperature for 1 h. 1064SK fibroblasts were harvested in PBS with 2.5 mm EDTA and resuspended in IMDM with 0.5% BSA at 5 × 105 cells/ml and allowed to adhere to protein-coated wells at 50 μl/well. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, wells were washed twice with PBS. Adherent cells were fixed with 10% formalin, stained with methylene blue, and quantified by dye extraction and measurement of absorbance at 620 nm (28Oliver M.H. Harrison N.K. Bishop J.E. Cole P.J. Laurent G.J. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 92: 513-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Where indicated, EDTA or peptides were mixed with cells prior to plating. Antibodies were incubated with cells at room temperature for 1 h before plating. Inhibition of glycosaminoglycan sulfation was achieved by growing cells in medium containing sodium chlorate (40 mm) for 24 h; cells were then detached and plated for cell adhesion assays as described above (29Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). To show the specificity of sulfation blockage, 10 mm sodium sulfate was included in the culture medium together with sodium chlorate. Murine Cyr61 and CTGF proteins were synthesized in a Baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) using Sf9 cells and purified from serum-free insect cell conditioned medium on Sepharose-S columns as described (10Kireeva M.L.

BSA, heparinase I (EC 4.2.2.7), chondroitinase ABC (EC 4.2.2.4), and heparin (sodium salt, from porcine intestinal mucosa) were from Sigma. Synthetic peptides GRGDSP and GRGESP were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Function-blocking mAbs against various integrins were purchased from Chemicon, Inc. (Temecula, CA), including JB1A (anti-β1), FB12 (anti-α1), P1E6 (anti-α2), P1B5 (anti-α3), P1H4 (anti-α4), JBS5 (anti-α5β1), GoH3 (anti-α6), and LM609 (anti-αvβ3). For immunofluorescence microscopy studies, mAbs against talin (clone 8d4) and paxillin (clone 349) were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (San Diego, CA); mAbs against phosphotyrosine (clone PY-20) and human β1-integrin (clone DE9) were from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY); and mAb against human integrin α6-subunit (clone 4F10) was from Chemicon. mAbs against human MMP-1 (clone 41-1ES), MMP-2 (clone 42-5D11), and MMP-3 (clone 55-2A4) were from Oncogene Research Products (Cambridge, MA). Anti-Rac mAb (cone 23A8), anti-FAK mAb (clone 2A7), and anti-phosphotyrosine mAb used in immunoblotting studies (clone 4G10) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Immunofluorescence microscopy was carried out as described (30Turner C.E. Glenney J.R.J. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). Cells adhered to coverslips were incubated with monoclonal antibodies against phosphotyrosine (clone PY-20), anti-α6 integrin (4F10), anti-β1integrin (clone DE9), anti-talin (clone 8d4), or anti-paxillin (clone 349) at 10 μg/ml, 50 μl/slip, and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Samples were washed four times with PBS plus 0.5% BSA and then incubated with fluorescein-conjugated horse anti-mouse IgG (20 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min. To visualize actin cytoskeleton, cells were stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) at 10 μg/ml, 100 μl per slip, and washed four times with PBS plus 0.5% BSA after incubation at room temperature for 1 h. For studies on intracellular signaling (see Figs. 5 and 6), 100-mm nontissue culture plastic dishes were precoated with various proteins at 10 μg/ml, 4 ml per dish, at 4 °C for 16 h, followed by blocking with 1% BSA at room temperature for 1 h. Cells were serum-starved and collected as described above. Protein-coated 100-mm dishes were kept at 37 °C and cells were plated at 2–3 ×106 cells/dish in 4 ml of 0.5% BSA-IMDM. Dishes and media were prewarmed at 37 °C, which helped to ensure consistent results with respect to cell adhesion and spreading within 5–15 min after plating.Figure 6Cyr61 and CTGF activate the small GTPase Rac in human skin fibroblasts. 1064SK fibroblasts were serum-starved, collected, and resuspended in serum-free IMDM and plated at 2–3 × 106 cells/100-mm dish precoated with Cyr61 (10 μg/ml) or CTGF (10 μg/ml) for various times as indicated. The dishes were prewarmed to 37 °C immediately before use. Time 0 indicates cells kept in suspension. Adherent cells were lysed at the indicated times, and activated Rac was affinity-precipitated and then immunoblotted with mAb against Rac protein. 50 μl of the clarified lysate from each sample was reserved for immunoblotting of total Rac protein. Data shown are representative of two independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) After incubation, cells were washed and lysed in a buffer (50 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, 135 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride); immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were carried out according to standard protocols (31Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988: 488-510Google Scholar). To determine total FAK or paxillin in each sample, blots were stripped in a buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) at 60 °C and then reprobed with mAbs against FAK or paxillin. To study protein secreted by cells adhered on various substrates (as in Fig. 8), the conditioned media were collected after 24 h of cell incubation. The media were first centrifuged to remove cellular debris. Protein in the media was concentrated using Centricon YM-10 (molecular mass cut-off 10 kDa). An equal amount of conditioned media was loaded on SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with monoclonal antibodies against human MMP-1 (clone 41–1ES), MMP-2 (clone 42–5D11), and MMP-3 (clone 55–2A4). 1064SK fibroblasts were serum-starved for 24 h, harvested, and plated on 35-mm dishes precoated with proteins as described above. Total cell lysates were prepared and applied on SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotting was carried out using rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the dually phosphorylated active form p42/p44 MAPK (Thr(P)183/Tyr(P)185) at a 1:5000 dilution as suggested by the manufacturer (Promega, Madison, WI). 1064SK fibroblasts were serum-starved for 24 h, harvested, and plated on plastic dishes precoated with various proteins as described above. The Rac activation assay was done using Rac activation kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). 1064SK fibroblasts were serum-starved 24 h, mildly trypsinized, and replated on protein-coated 100-mm plastic dishes in serum-free IMDM as described above. After incubation at 37 °C for various times, total cellular RNA was isolated and subjected to RNA blot analysis using various [32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA probes (32Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994Google Scholar). Human MMP-1 and MMP-2 full-length cDNA clones were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. MMP-3 probe was generated using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction with a primer pair corresponding to human MMP-3 cDNA nucleotides 1493–1521 and 1736–1763. The blots were washed at high stringency (0.2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C) and analyzed by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). We previously showed that adhesion of primary human skin fibroblasts to Cyr61 is mediated through both integrin α6β1 and cell surface HSPGs (27Chen N. Chen C.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24953-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Given that CTGF is also a heparin-binding protein with strong sequence homology with Cyr61, we surmised that CTGF may also support fibroblast adhesion through a similar mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we prepared microtiter wells coated with purified recombinant CTGF onto which primary human skin fibroblasts were allowed to adhere under serum-free conditions. Fibroblast adhesion to CTGF was dose-dependent and saturable and was completely abrogated by the presence of 2 μg/ml heparin in the plating medium (Fig.1 A). These results suggest that occupancy of the CTGF heparin-binding site by soluble heparin may prevent its interaction with cell surface HSPGs, thus inhibiting cell adhesion. To test this possibility, we cultured human fibroblasts in the presence of sodium chlorate, an inhibitor of 3-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate synthesis, to block sulfation of proteoglycans (29Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). Adhesion to CTGF was inhibited under this condition, whereas adhesion of the same cells to fibronectin and vitronectin was unaffected (Fig.1 B). The inhibitory effects of sodium chlorate on cell adhesion to CTGF was reversed by the inclusion of 10 mmNa2SO4 in the culture medium, verifying that this inhibitory effect is mediated through a sulfation block (29Rapraeger A.C. Krufka A. Olwin B.B. Science. 1991; 252: 1705-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar). To substantiate the finding that cell surface sulfated proteoglycans are required for cell adhesion to CTGF, fibroblasts were treated with heparinase I, an enzyme that targets highly sulfated heparan sulfate proteoglycans (33Lawler J. Weinstein R. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 34Feitsma K. Hausser H. Robenek H. Kresse H. Vischer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 9396-9402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Heparinase I-treated cells were unable to adhere to CTGF, whereas the same treated cells adhered to fibronectin or vitronectin indifferently (Fig. 1 C). Treatment of fibroblasts with chondroitinase ABC had no effect. These results show that CTGF, like Cyr61, requires cell surface HSPGs to mediate adhesion of fibroblasts. Fibroblast adhesion to CTGF was inhibited by the presence of EDTA or Ca2+ in the assay media, but not by Mg2+ (Fig.2 A). In control experiments, cell adhesion to type I collagen showed the same divalent cation sensitivity as to CTGF, whereas cell adhesion to vitronectin was not inhibited by Ca2+, as previously observed (27Chen N. Chen C.C. Lau L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24953-24961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). This divalent cation sensitivity of fibroblasts adhesion to CTGF is consistent with the involvement of an integrin receptor. To help distinguish the specific integrin involved, we examined the inhibitory effects of RGD-containing peptides. The peptide GRGDSP was unable to inhibit fibroblast adhesion to CTGF even when present at 2 mm, a concentration that abrogated cell adhesion to either fibronectin or vitronectin, ligands of the integrin α5β1 and the αV integrins, respectively (Fig. 2 B). The control peptide GRGESP was unable to inhibit cell adhesion to any substrate. Thus, adhesion of fibroblasts to CTGF is unlikely to be mediated through the major RGD-sensitive integrins in these cells, namely the αVintegrins and integrin α5β1. To define the specific integrin that mediates cell adhesion to CTGF, we tested the ability of a panel of function-blocking mAbs to inhibit adhesion. Preincubation of cells with mAbs against integrin subunits α1, α2, α3, or α4 or the integrins α5β1(JBS5) and αVβ3 (LM609) had no effect on fibroblast adhesion to CTGF (data not shown). By contrast, mAb against integrin α6 subunit (GoH3) completely abrogated cell adhesion to CTGF, whereas adhesion to fibronectin was not affected (Fig. 2 C). Adhesion to laminin, a known ligand for integrin α6β1, was only minimally affected. This is most likely because skin fibroblasts utilize α2β1, rather than α6β1, as the major receptor for laminin (35Lange T.S. Bielinsky A.K. Kirchberg K. Bank I. Herrmann K. Krieg T. Scharffetter-Kochanek K. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 214: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Likewise, mAb against the integrin β1 subunit strongly inhibited cell adhesion to CTGF but not to vitronectin (Fig.2 D). Similar inhibitory effect was observed in adhesion to type I collagen, a known substrate for β1 integrins. Together, these results show that adhesion of human skin fibroblasts to CTGF, like adhesion to Cyr61, requires both integrin α6β1 and cell surface HSPGs. Interaction of integrins and their adhesive ligands leads to intracellular signaling, resulting in a range of cellular responses including cytoskeletal reorganization, focal adhesion complex formation, and cell spreading (36Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E. Science. 1999; 285: 1028-1032Crossref PubMed Scopus (3809) Google Scholar, 37Jockusch B.M. Bubeck P. Giehl K. Kroemker M. Moschner J. Rothkegel M. Rudiger M. Schluter K. Stanke G. Winkler J. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 379-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Fibroblasts adhered to matrix proteins such as fibronectin or laminin are known to transiently form filopodia, lamellipodia, and pseudopod extensions indicative of cell motility, although these structures usually retreat within 30 min after plating, both in reports by others and in our own observations (38Bloom L. Ingham K.C. Hynes R.O. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1521-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To understand the signaling responses as cells adhere to Cyr61 and CTGF, we have examined the morphological changes and signaling responses in cells adhered to these proteins. More than 90% of cells attached to and spread on coverslips coated with Cyr61 or CTGF within 10 min after plating, as was the case when cells were allowed to adhere to fibronectin or laminin, whereas cells plated on coverslips coated with BSA never spread even after 1 h of incubation (Fig.3). Adherent fibroblasts were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and stained with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin to reveal their actin cytoskeleton structures. Fluorescence microscopy showed that 30 min after plating, fibroblasts adhered to Cyr61 or CTGF had numerous extended pseudopods (Fig. 3). Arrays of actin filaments existed inside the cells, and microspikes of actin filaments protruded from the cell surface in actin-containing membrane ruffling, typical of filopodia and lamellipodia (39Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3274) Google Scholar, 40Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1308) Google Scholar). These structures became even more prominent at later times, and by 60 min after plating, cells displayed complex contours due to their abundance. In contrast, filopodia and lamellipodia formed in fibroblasts plated on fibronectin or laminin are fewer in number and more transient in nature,"
https://openalex.org/W2093241596,"We have cloned a new human matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-28, epilysin) from human keratinocyte and testis cDNA libraries. Like most MMPs, epilysin contains a signal sequence, a prodomain with a PRCGVTD sequence, a zinc-binding catalytic domain with an HEIGHTLGLTH sequence, and a hemopexin-like domain. In addition, epilysin has a furin activation sequence (RRKKR) but has no transmembrane sequence. The exon-intron organization and splicing pattern of epilysin differ from that of other MMP genes. It has only 8 exons, and 5 exons are spliced at sites not used by other MMPs. Another novel feature of epilysin is that exon 4 is alternatively spliced to a transcript that does not encode the N-terminal half of the catalytic domain. Northern hybridization of tissue RNA indicated that epilysin is expressed at high levels in testis and at lower levels in lungs, heart, colon, intestine, and brain. RNase protection assay with various cell lines indicated that epilysin was selectively expressed in keratinocytes. Recombinant epilysin degraded casein in a zymography assay, and its proteolytic activity was inhibited by EDTA and by batimastat, a selective MMP inhibitor. Immunohistochemical staining showed expression of epilysin protein in the basal and suprabasal epidermis of intact skin. In injured skin, prominent staining for epilysin was seen in basal keratinocytes both at and some distance from the wound edge, a pattern that is quite distinct from that of other MMPs expressed during tissue repair. These findings suggest that this new MMP functions in several tissues both in tissue homeostasis and in repair.AF219624 We have cloned a new human matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-28, epilysin) from human keratinocyte and testis cDNA libraries.

Parks W.C. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego1998: 1-14Crossref Google Scholar). MMPs, or matrixins, are a subgroup of the much larger metalloproteinase superfamily, which also includes astacin and ADAM proteinases, among others. To date 23 different MMPs have been cloned, and additional members continue to be identified (2Nagase H. Woessner Jr., J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 21491-21494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3827) Google Scholar). To be classified as a matrix metalloproteinase, a protein must have conserved features of two domains, namely the prodomain and the catalytic domain. The prodomain of a typical MMP is about 80 amino acids, and all MMPs, except MMP-23 (3Velasco G. Pendas A.M. Fueyo A. Knauper V. Murphy G. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4570-4576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), contain the consensus sequence PRCXXPD. As for all metalloproteinases, the catalytic domain contains an active site Zn2+ that binds three conserved histidines in the sequence HEXXHXXGXXH(S/T)XXXXXXM, which also contains a conserved methionine to the carboxyl side of the zinc-binding site (metzincins) (4Bode W. Reinemer P. Huber R. Kleine T. Schnierer S. Tschesche H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1263-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). In an inactive state, the conserved cysteine residue in the prodomain provides the fourth coordination site for the catalytic zinc ion. In addition, with the exception of matrilysin (MMP-7), endometase/matrilysin-2 (MMP-26), and MMP-23, MMPs have a hinge region, which is often proline-rich, and a so-called hemopexin-like C-terminal domain (3Velasco G.

For example, four membrane-type MMPs (MMP-14, -15, -16, and -24) have transmembrane and cytosolic domains, whereas MT4-MMP and MT6-MMP (MMP-17 and -25, respectively) have C-terminal hydrophobic extensions that act as a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchoring signal (7Itoh Y.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 480: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The two gelatinases (MMP-2 and MMP-9) have gelatin-binding domains. MMP-23 lacks the hemopexin domain and has a novel cysteine array motif and an immunoglobulin-like C2-type fold domain (3Velasco G. Pendas A.M. Fueyo A. Knauper V. Murphy G. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol.

In addition to a common domain structure, MMPs share a similar gene arrangement suggesting that they were generated by duplications of an ancestor gene. At least eight of the known human MMP genes (MMPs 1, 3, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13, and 20) are clustered on chromosome 11 at 11q21–23. Other known MMP genes are scattered along chromosomes 1, 8, 12, 14, 16, 20, and 22 (3Velasco G. Pendas A.M. Fueyo A. Knauper V. Murphy G. Lopez-Otin C. J. Biol.

Genomics. 1999; 62: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). MMPs are secreted or bound or anchored to the cell membrane, and all function extracellularly or within the secretion pathway. As demonstrated in defined in vitro studies, almost all MMPs can cleave or degrade some protein components of the extracellular matrix, and many are able to act on a wide variety of proteins (13Birkedal-Hansen H.

Notable exceptions to this rule are stromelysin-3 (MMP-11) and MMP-23, which have no known extracellular matrix substrates (3Velasco G. Pendas A.M. Fueyo A. Knauper V. Murphy G. Lopez-Otin C. J.

For example, matrilysin is responsible for activation of the pro-form of α-defensins (15Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. López-Boado Y.S. Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M.

In addition, several MMPs, such as MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, and -11, among others, directly modulate the activity of several growth factors, such as tumor necrosis factor-α, insulin-like growth factor-1, epidermal growth factors, and fibroblast growth factors (19Haro H.

Many of the secreted MMPs, including MMPs 1, 3, 9, 10, 11, and 13, are not expressed in normal, healthy resting tissues, and with some exceptions, their production and activity are maintained at nearly undetectable levels. In contrast, some level of MMP expression is seen in any repair or remodeling process, in any diseased or inflamed tissue, and in essentially any cell type grown in culture (25Parks W.C. Sudbeck B.D.

BioEssays. 1992; 14: 455-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (1321) Google Scholar). Although the qualitative pattern and quantitative levels of MMPs vary among tissues, diseases, tumors, inflammatory conditions, and cell lines, a reasonably safe generalization is that activated cells express MMPs. Some MMPs, including MMPs 7, 19, 24, 25, and 26, are expressed in healthy tissues (27de Coignac A.B. Elson G. Delneste Y. Magistrelli G. Jeannin P. Aubry J.P. Berthier O. Schmitt D. Bonnefoy J.Y.

In the present study, we report on the cloning and initial characterization of a novel human MMP, MMP-28, which we call epilysin. We isolated the cDNA for this protein from keratinocyte and testis libraries, and we show that it has the essential domains of a prototypic MMP, as well as several unique features. Because of its ability to degrade a protein substrate was fully inhibited by EDTA and a hydroxamate MMP inhibitor, epilysin, is indeed a metalloenzyme. Our data suggest that epilysin is expressed in intact tissues and up-regulated in response to injury. Thus, this new MMP may function in both tissue homeostasis and tissue repair. A search of the GenBankTM data base with the peptide string FDGXXXXLAHAXXPGXXXXGDXHFDXXEXW, which is conserved among MMPs, returned a homologous sequence within an 82-kb human genomic DNA clone (GenBankTM accession numberAC006237). Nested primers were designed to amplify a 161-bp cDNA fragment by RT-PCR using HT-1080 human fibrosarcoma line RNA as a template. The amplified product corresponds to bases 726–886 (see Fig.1). By screening a human foreskin keratinocyte cDNA library (HL1110b, CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) by plaque hybridization with the 32P-labeled 161-bp cDNA fragment, we obtained three positive clones, which were then sequenced. The longest clone of 1.5 kb contained exons 3–8 of epilysin (see below for exon numbering). This cDNA clone was then used to screen a pooled human testis cDNA library (HL5033t,CLONTECH). Among the more than 20 positive clones was a clone that contained the coding regions of exons 1 and 2. Exon-intron boundaries were determined by comparing the cDNA sequences with the genomic sequence in data base. Screening of GenBankTM data base was performed using the TBLASTN program and the NCBI server (32Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar). Epilysin signal peptide was identified, and its cleavage site was predicted using the SignalP server (33Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. Heijne G.V. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4911) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of human MMPs 1, 3, 11, 14, and 19 were aligned with epilysin using ClustalW (34Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (54908) Google Scholar). A phylogenetic tree was drawn based on a ClustalW alignment of the amino acid sequences of the catalytic domains of all known human MMPs. Human foreskin fibroblasts, immortalized human keratinocytes (HaCaT) (35Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 106: 761-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (3395) Google Scholar), and human fibrosarcoma HT-1080 cells (CCL-121, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown to confluence in Eagle's minimal essential medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Human colon adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells (HTB38, ATCC) were maintained in RPMI medium. MMP expression was stimulated by treatment with 16 nm phorbol ester (PMA, Sigma) for 24 h. Primary human keratinocytes were isolated from normal full thickness adult skin and cultured on collagen-coated dishes as described (36Sudbeck B.D. Parks W.C. Welgus H.G. Pentland A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30022-30029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). U937 cells (ATCC, CRL 1593), a human monocyte-like cell line, were cultured and differentiated to stimulated macrophage-like cells by a 24-h treatment with 4 nm PMA and 5 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (Sigma) as described (37Saarialho-Kere U.K. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17354-17361Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated using RNAzol B (Tel-Test, Friendswood, TX). Nylon filters containing 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA from various human tissues (CLONTECH) were prehybridized with ExpressHyb® hybridization solution (CLONTECH) and then hybridized in the same solution with32P-labeled epilysin probe, generated by random priming using a 1.5-kb cDNA fragment as a template. Loading was normalized by hybridization with a β-actin cDNA probe. Hybridization and washes were performed according to manufacturer's instructions. Expression of epilysin mRNA in cultured cells was analyzed by ribonuclease protection technique using Direct Protect kit (Ambion Inc., Austin, TX) and two different RNA probes. A PCR fragment of 161 bp (bases 726–886 in epilysin cDNA) and another fragment of 539 bp (bases 370–908) were cloned to pGEM-T-Easy (Promega), and plasmid DNA was linearized with SalI. Antisense RNAs of 257 and 635 nt, respectively, were transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of [α-32P]UTP and hybridized with 10 μg of total cellular RNA. After an overnight hybridization, unpaired RNA was degraded by treatment with RNase A and RNase T1 (10 and 400 units/ml, respectively) at 37 °C for 30 min followed by isopropyl alcohol precipitation. Protected RNA fragments were fractionated by 5% SDS-PAGE containing 6 m urea and visualized by autoradiography. Alternative splicing was first detected when RT-PCRs to amplify regions containing bases 370–960 and 440–960 (forward primers 5′-GTGGGTGTCCCAGCTACCTGTC-3′ and 5′-TGCGGGGTTACAGATACCAACAG-3′, reverse primer 5′-CTCTTGTAGTAGGGCGCCATGAG-3′) using HaCaT cDNA as a template gave three specific products of different size. Specificity of the amplification products was determined by Southern blotting using a [γ-32P]ATP-labeled internal oligonucleotide probe 5′-GCGGCGAAGCGCACTTCGACCAAGATGAGC-3′, and the amplification products were purified from gel and sequenced. The presence of alternatively spliced mRNA in HaCaT cells was verified by RNase protection analysis using the 635-nt RNA probe described above. For generation of recombinant protein, nucleotides 536–1732 of epilysin cDNA, coding for amino acids 123–520 of epilysin protein were amplified using primers 5′-CGGGATCCGACGATGACGATAAGTTTGCAAAGCAAGGTAACAAATGGTACAAGC-3′ (forward, epilysin sequence underlined) and 5′-CGGAATTCTCAGAACAGGGCGCTCCCCGAGTTG-3′ (reverse). The amplification product was digested with BamHI andEcoRI and cloned into the pAcSecG2T baculovirus transfer vector (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). The resulting expression construct codes for a fusion protein of Schistosoma japonicumglutathione S-transferase (GST) and amino acid residues 123–520 of epilysin corresponding to the putative furin-activated enzyme. This vector also provides the signal peptide from the baculovirus protein gp67 to direct secretion of the fusion protein. Sf9 cells were transfected with the construct and BaculoGold DNA (Phar- Mingen) to produce recombinant baculovirus. Following two rounds of virus amplification, High Five insect cells (Stratagene) were infected and harvested along with conditioned medium 5 days later. Cell pellets were lysed in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 130 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mmNaF, 10 mm NaPi, and 10 mmNaPPi. GST-epilysin fusion protein was purified from cell lysates and conditioned medium by glutathione-Sepharose affinity chromatography according to manufacturer's protocol (PharMingen). Protein eluting from the affinity resin was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with a rabbit polyclonal anti-GST antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Unexpectedly, most of the GST-epilysin fusion protein was found in cell pellets and not in the conditioned medium. To express a fusion protein consisting of S. japonicum glutathione S-transferase (GST) and the pro- and catalytic domains of epilysin (amino acid residues 23–284, see Fig. 1) in Escherichia coli, a 802-bp fragment of the MMP-28 cDNA was amplified by PCR using primers 5′-CGGGATCCCAGCCCGCGGAGCGCGGA-3′ (forward, epilysin sequence underlined) and 5′-GGAATTCTCACCCATACAGGCTCTGCACGGCCAGC-3′ (reverse), and the PCR product was digested with BamHI andEcoRI and cloned into the pGEX-6P-2 vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The resulting expression vector was then transformed into BL21(DE3)pLys strain of E. coli. Overnight bacterial culture derived from a single bacterial colony was diluted 1:10 and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. Expression of the fusion protein was then induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (0.5 mm final concentration) followed by further incubation at 25 °C for 4 h. Recombinant protein obtained in inclusion bodies was solubilized by sonication in the presence ofN-lauroylsarcosine and affinity-purified with glutathione-Sepharose as described (38Fragioni J. Neel B. Anal. Biochem. 1993; 210: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (825) Google Scholar). Recombinant fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose was then digested with PreScission protease according to manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to remove the GST tag. Between the GST domain and epilysin, the fusion protein has the recognition sequence (LEVLFQGP) for PreScission Protease. Recombinant epilysin (pro- and catalytic domains) was then eluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 500 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Brij-35. Caseinolytic activity was measured by zymography using a 4–16% SDS-PAGE blue casein zymogram gel (NOVEX, San Diego, CA) according to manufacturer's protocol. After electrophoresis, the zymogram gel was washed and incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 1–2.5% Triton X-100 and either 1) 10 mm EDTA, or 2) both 5 mm CaCl2 and 1 μm ZnCl2, or 3) 10 μmbatimastat in the presence of 5 mm CaCl2 and 1 μm ZnCl2. An 8-chain branching multiple antigenic peptide of 16 amino acids, DQDERWSLSRRRGRNL, corresponding to the middle of the catalytic domain of epilysin (amino acid residues 219–234, see Fig.1), was used as an antigen (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). Rabbits were first immunized with 0.5 mg of the peptide in complete Freund's adjuvant, and three booster injections with 0.5 mg of the peptide in incomplete Freund's adjuvant were given 2, 6, and 8 weeks later by a commercial operation (Research Genetics). Antibodies were purified from whole serum, harvested at 10 weeks after primary injection, by affinity chromatography with the peptide coupled toN-hydroxysuccinimide-Sepharose 4B according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoblotting, confluent cultures of HaCaT cells were washed with serum-free medium and were incubated under serum-free conditions for an additional 48 h. The medium was then collected and concentrated 70-fold using a Centricon microconcentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA). 10 μl of concentrated conditioned medium was mixed with an equal amount of Laemmli sample buffer containing 10% β-mercaptoethanol and resolved by SDS-PAGE through a 4–15% gradient gel. Recombinant baculoviral GST-epilysin fusion protein was used as a positive control. Proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell) using a semi-dry blotting apparatus at 2.5 mA/cm2 for 30 min. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in PBS/Triton X-100 (0.5%) and incubated with 0.15 μg/ml of affinity-purified antibodies in 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, pH 8.5. After five washes in the same buffer, the bound antibodies were detected using biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies and peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Dakopatts, Copenhagen, Denmark) and enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (39Taipale J. Koli K. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 268: 25378-25384Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were transfected with a cDNA construct coding for epilysin with a C-terminal 10-aa influenza virus hemagglutinin tag under transcriptional control by cytomegalovirus promoter in pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). 24 h after transfection, transfected cell clones were selected for neomycin resistance as described (40Lohi J. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17602-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). For immunofluorescence staining, a pool of transfected cells was plated on glass coverslips, and 3 days later, the cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 0.14 m NaCl in 10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). After fixing the coverslips were washed three times with PBS and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min. Affinity-purified epilysin antibody was then added (1:100 dilution) in 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS and incubated 1 h at room temperature with mild shaking. After three washes with the same buffer, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgGs (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) were added and incubated for 1 h. Coverslips were then washed 5 times with PBS and mounted on glass slides using Vectashield anti-fading agent (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Individual, 4-mm-wide, full thickness biopsies of human skin used for keratinocyte culture were placed into the wells of 6-well cluster dishes and covered with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing antibiotics. 24 h later, tissues were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and processed for paraffin embedding. Deparaffinized 5-μm sections were processed for immunohistochemistry using alkaline phosphatase as described (41Saarialho-Kere U.K. Kovacs S.O. Pentland A.P. Olerud J. Welgus H.G. Parks W.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2858-2866Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked by incubation in 0.3% H2O2 for 30 min at room temperature. Affinity-purified anti-human epilysin antibody was diluted 1:1000. Bound antibody was detected using a Vectastain ABC Elite kit (Vector Laboratories) following the manufacturer's instructions. Peroxidase activity was detected using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as chromogenic substrate. Sections were counterstained with Harris hematoxylin. For negative controls, sections were processed with preimmune serum. To identify undiscovered MMPs, we searched the GenBankTM data base using the TBLASTN program and a peptide query sequence FDGXXXXLAHAXXPGXXXXGDXHFDXXEXW, which defines a partial consensus sequence of a metalloproteinase catalytic domain. Among the more than 100 hits was a human genomic DNA clone (GenBankTM accession number AC006237) that was submitted by Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research and had been sequenced as a part of the Human Genome Project sequencing chromosome 17. There was no annotation that the sequence would code for proteins. After translation of the genomic DNA in three forward reading frames, several peptide sequences typical of MMPs, including a propeptide sequence PRCGVTD and a catalytic domain sequence HEIGH, were identified, and these sequences were separated by putative intronic sequences. To assess if this genomic region was transcribed to an mRNA, two sets of primers were designed; the forward and reverse primers were directed to different suspected exons. As a source of RNA, we used the human fibrosarcoma cell line HT-1080, as these cells are known to express a wide variety of MMPs (40Lohi J. Keski-Oja J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17602-17609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 42Westermarck J. Lohi J. Keski-Oja J. Kähäri V.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 1205-1213PubMed Google Scholar). cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer primers and was amplified by PCR. Two-stage PCR with nested primers produced an amplified DNA fragment of expected size (161 bp), and the nucleotide sequence of this fragment was identical to that of presumed exonic portions of the genomic sequence (data not shown). To obtain the full-length cDNA for this novel MMP, we screened a human keratinocyte cDNA library using the PCR product as a probe. (RNase protection analysis of various cell lines revealed that epilysin is expressed in cultured human keratinocytes; see Fig. 6.) Among the three positive clones, we isolated and characterized a 1.5-kb cDNA that contained sequence coding for part of the prodomain, the entire catalytic and hemopexin-like domains, a stop codon TGA, and 85 bp of 3′-untranslated region. To determine the 5′ end of this MMP transcript, we screened a testis cDNA library with a probe corresponding to the 5′ end of the 1.5-kb keratino"

Here we show that instead a novel enzyme activity, fructose-6-phosphate aldolase, is encoded by this open reading frame, which is the first report of an enzyme that catalyzes an aldol cleavage of fructose 6-phosphate from any organism. We propose the name FSA (forfructose-six phosphatealdolase; gene name fsa). The recombinant protein was purified to apparent homogeneity by anion exchange and gel permeation chromatography with a yield of 40 mg of protein from 1 liter of culture. By using electrospray tandem mass spectroscopy, a molecular weight of 22,998 per subunit was determined. From gel filtration a size of 257,000 (± 20,000) was calculated. The enzyme most likely forms either a decamer or dodecamer of identical subunits. The purified enzyme displayed a Vmax of 7 units mg−1 of protein for fructose 6-phosphate cleavage (at 30 °C, pH 8.5 in 50 mm glycylglycine buffer). For the aldolization reaction a Vmaxof 45 units mg−1 of protein was found;Km values for the substrates were 9 mmfor fructose 6-phosphate, 35 mm for dihydroxyacetone, and 0.8 mm for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. FSA did not utilize fructose, fructose 1-phosphate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, or dihydroxyacetone phosphate. FSA is not inhibited by EDTA which points to a metal-independent mode of action. The lysine 85 residue is essential for its action as its exchange to arginine (K85R) resulted in complete loss of activity in line with the assumption that the reaction mechanism involves a Schiff base formation through this lysine residue (class I aldolase). Another fsa-related gene,talC of Escherichia coli, was shown to also encode fructose-6-phosphate aldolase activity and not a transaldolase as proposed earlier.

Wong C.-H. Angew. Chem. Intl. Ed. Engl. 2000; 39: 1352-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Aldol condensation and cleavage reactions play crucial roles in the central sugar metabolic pathways of all organisms. For instance in glycolysis, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is reversibly cleaved into the triose dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, whereas in gluconeogenesis, the bisphosphate is formed through action of aldolase (fructose-1,6-bisphosphate or FBP aldolase,1 EC 4.1.2.13). FBP aldolases and other aldolases can be broadly divided into two groups according to their reaction mechanisms. Class I aldolases are characterized by a covalent intermediate, which is a protonated Schiff base formed between a lysine residue and the carbonyl carbon of the substrate (2Rutter W.J. Fed. Proc. 1964; 23: 1248-1257PubMed Google Scholar, 3Horecker B.L. Tsolas O. Lai C.Y. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 7. Academic Press, New York1972: 213-258Google Scholar, 4Marsh J.J. Lebherz H.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 110-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Class II aldolases have an absolute requirement for a divalent metal ion that stabilizes the reaction intermediates by polarization of the substrate carbonyl (5Mildvan A.S. Kobes R.D. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 1191-1204Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Class I and II aldolases vary in other criteria such as subunit structure, pH profile, and substrate affinity. They share little if any sequence homology and are apparently of different evolutionary origins (2Rutter W.J. Fed. Proc. 1964; 23: 1248-1257PubMed Google Scholar). Class II aldolases prevail in bacteria, in fungi, and algae (4Marsh J.J. Lebherz H.G. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 110-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Class I FBP aldolases are mainly distributed in higher eukaryotes including animals, plants, protozoa, and algae; they generally are tetramers (4Marsh J.J. Lebherz H.G. Trends Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6812-6821Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) or a very weak substrate (less than 0.01% relative activity compared with FBP); however, no aldol formation from dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde-3-P was reported (12Richards O.C. Rutter W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 3185-3192Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Muscle and plant chloroplast FBP aldolases are reported to split sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphate (13Horecker B.L. Smyrniotis P.Z. Hiatt H.H. Marks P.A. J. Biol.

To our best knowledge, no aldol cleavage of fructose 6-phosphate has been reported so far from any organism (1Machajewski T.D. Wong C.-H. Angew. Chem. Intl. Ed. Engl. 2000; 39: 1352-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). Transaldolases (EC 2.2.1.2) are class I aldolases that serve in transfer reactions in the pentose phosphate cycle. Transaldolases use fructose-6-P as donor and transfer a dihydroxyacetone group to acceptor compounds as erythrose-4-P or glyceraldehyde-3-P (3Horecker B.L. Tsolas O. Lai C.Y. Boyer P.D.

As a side reaction, formation of fructose-6-P from dihydroxyacetone and glyceraldehyde-3-P is known, but the corresponding aldol cleavage reaction has not been documented (3Horecker B.L. Tsolas O. Lai C.Y. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. 3rd Ed. 7. Academic Press, New York1972: 213-258Google Scholar). Recently, a group of gene sequences presumably encoding transaldolase-like proteins (19Reizer J. Reizer A. Saier M.H. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) has been reported as outcome of total genome analyses of various Eubacteria and Archaebacteria. We have cloned two of these sequences (mipBand talC) from the genome of E. coli K-12. During the course of characterization of the gene products, however, we noticed that the corresponding proteins did not act as transaldolases. Instead, they perform a novel reaction, cleavage, or formation of fructose 6-phosphate as shown in Reaction 1. Here we present results in the characterization of fructose-6-phosphate aldolase encoded by the gene fsa(formerly termed mipB). Sugar phosphates, antibiotics, and other fine chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. Aldehydes and erythrose were from Fluka (Neu-Ulm, Germany).

The E. coli mipB gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using primers MipB5 (5′ GATGTGCGTCGACTGTTCAGAGAGTTTTCCC 3′) and MipB3 (5′ GAGGCTGCAGAACGTCCGGTTAAATCGACG 3′) corresponding to base pairs 862,865 to 862,896 (5′-end) and 863,497 to 863,527 bps (3′-end), respectively, of the sequence deposited at EMBL/GenBankTM (Isomura and coworkers, 2M.

The resulting 0.7-kilobase pair PCR fragment was purified, cleaved withPstI plus SalI, and ligated with pUC18 which had been opened likewise. Strain JM109 was used for transformations; resulting clones were checked for their integrity by restriction analyses and DNA sequencing using an automatic nonradioactive system (LI-COR, MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out using the Chameleon Double-stranded Site-directed Mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Mutagenesis primers were 5′ GGCGGTCACCGGAACGCGCACCACGATATCCGC 3′ and 5′ CATCATTGGAAAACGCTCTTCGGGGCG 3′. Data bank searches were done using the NCBI Blast server with the program of Altschul et al. (25Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (58771) Google Scholar). Preliminary sequence data were obtained from The Institute for Genomic Research. FSA (formerly MipB) aldolase from recombinant strain JM109/pUC18fsa was purified by the following procedure; all operations were carried out at 4 °C in glycylglycine buffer (50 mm; pH 8.0; 1 mm dithiothreitol). A single colony was inoculated into 50 ml of LB + ampicillin and incubated overnight at 37 °C with shaking. This culture served as starter for the main culture that was performed in three 2-liter Erlenmeyer flasks (400 ml of LB + ampicillin medium each) with shaking at 37 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation (yield of 24 g wet weight). After washing with glycylglycine buffer, pellets were broken by ultrasonic treatment (Branson Sonifier, Danbury, CT) eight times for 30 s at 40 watts under cooling in an ethanol/ice bath. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g, the supernatant was used as cell-free extract. Cell-free extract was dissolved in 240 ml of buffer and directly applied onto a Q-Sepharose HP anion exchange column (XK 26/20; 26 × 200 mm). At a flow rate of 1 ml/min, FSA was eluted in a linear NaCl gradient at a concentration of 352–380 mmNaCl. Active fractions were pooled, diluted 4-fold with buffer, and passed over a gel filtration column (Superdex G-200, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was carried out in the presence of 1% SDS on 12% vertical polyacrylamide gels using the buffer system of Laemmli (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar). Gels were run at room temperature in a Bio-Rad MiniProteanII chamber with a LKB 2297 Macrodrive 5 power supply at a constant voltage of 100 V. For native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, gradient gels were run for 6 h with a constant voltage of 125 V. Protein bands were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. By using different reference marker proteins, the subunit mass of the FSA was calculated from a plot of the log of the molecular mass versus the relative mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Purified FSA was blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P from Millipore) in a semi-dry blot apparatus and stained with Amido Black. The protein band was cut out and subjected to N-terminal sequenation. Electrospray tandem mass spectroscopy was carried out as described (27Rai D.K. Alvelius G. Landin B. Griffiths W.J. Rapid Commun. Mass Spectrom. 2000; 14: 1184-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) using a Q-TOF (Micromass, Manchester, UK). Two different assays for fructose-6-phosphate aldolase activity were used (all at 30 °C in a Shimadzu UV160A spectrophotometer with a thermostated cuvette holder at a wavelength of 340 nm). (i) Cleavage of fructose 6-phosphate (Fru-6-P, 50 mm) was followed using the auxiliary enzymes triose-phosphate isomerase and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to detect formation ofd-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The oxidation of NADH (0.5 mm) was monitored and 1 μmol of NADH oxidized was set equivalent to 1 μmol of Fru-6-P cleaved. Enzyme activities are given in units (μmol/min). The standard buffer was glycylglycine (50 mm, pH 8.5) including 1 mm dithiothreitol in a total volume of 1 ml. (ii) By using the same buffer system as in i, the formation of Fru-6-P from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone (3 and 50 mm, respectively) was monitored by the combined enzymes phosphoglucose isomerase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The reduction of NADP (0.5 mm) was followed. A prereaction of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate with the auxiliary enzymes and NADP was run until no further NADPH formation occurred. Influence of possible inhibitors of aldolase activity was measured by aldolase assays I and II. Glycerol was added at different concentrations up to 230 mm; inorganic phosphate was added up to 5 mm,and EDTA was added at 10 mm. Transaldolase activity was determined as described earlier (16Sprenger G.A. Schörken U. Sprenger G. Sahm H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5930-5936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A dye-binding method (28Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211983) Google Scholar) was used to estimate the concentration of protein in solution. During a data bank search for transaldolase-like proteins in the genome of E. coli K-12 strain MG1655 (Ref. 24Blattner F.R. Plunkett III, G. Bloch C.A. Perna N.T. Burland V. Riley M. Collado-Vides J. Glasner J.D. Rode C.K. Mayhew G.F. Gregor J. Davis N.W. Kirkpatrick H.A. Goeden M.A. Rose D.J. Mau B. Shao Y. Science. 1997; 277: 1453-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (5935) Google Scholar; GenBankTM accession number U00096), we found two open reading frames (ORFs) that showed a degree of identical amino acid residues in the range of 25% to the derived peptide sequence of talB (TableII; see Ref. 16Sprenger G.A. Schörken U. Sprenger G. Sahm H. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 5930-5936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One of the putative ORFs (“talC”) had been classified earlier by Saier and co-workers (19Reizer J. Reizer A. Saier M.H. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 961-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) as a transaldolase, albeit without experimental evidence. The other (mipB) was originally proposed as a transaldolase-like protein (29Thorell S. Gergely Jr., P. Banki K. Perl A. Schneider G.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 155: 335-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar) using chromosomal DNA of strain MC4100 as template and by using specific primers with engineered unique restriction sites (see Fig. 1 and “Experimental Procedures” for details). The amplification product (about 700 bp of DNA) was cloned into the expression vector pUC18. In crude extracts from strains carrying the gene on high copy number vectors, an extra protein band at 24,000 Da (± 1000) appeared on SDS-PAGE. This protein band could be further augmented by addition of the inducer IPTG to recombinant cells in the exponential phase and was estimated to constitute up to 10% of the total soluble protein content of the crude extract (Fig. 2); thus a rapid and high yield enzyme purification could be undertaken. The purification strategy using recombinant strain JM109/pUC18fsa is described under “Experimental Procedures.” A total of about 40 mg of pure enzyme was obtained from 1 liter of culture, with an overall yield of 38% corresponding to a purification factor of 5.2 (Table III). The degree of purity was monitored with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar).Figure 2SDS-PAGE analysis of the E. colialdolase purification.

Instead, we noticed that a fructose 6-phosphate cleaving activity was present and further enriched by subsequent steps of protein purification. In the homogeneous state, a fructose-6-phosphate aldolase activity (at 30 °C in glycylglycine buffer, pH 8.5) of 7 units per mg of protein was found (TableIV). No fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase or transaldolase activity could be detected in the gel filtration fractions (data not shown). As a literature search did not reveal evidence for a previous description of a fructose-6-phosphate aldolase from any organism, we like to term the novel activity as fructose-6-phosphate aldolase. Furthermore, we propose to rename the corresponding gene (formerly mipB) as fsa(mnemonic for fructose-six phosphatealdolase); the enzyme is abbreviated as FSA.Table IVKinetics of fructose-6-P aldolase FSASubstrateKmVmaxmmunits/mgFructose 6-phosphate97Dihydroxyacetone3545Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate0.845 Open table in a new tab To verify that the novel enzyme activity was the true product of thefsa (mipB) gene, the purified protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and stained with Amido Black. The first 10 amino acid residues were determined by an automated Edman degradation and analyzed by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography. The sequence was determined as H2N-(Met)-Glu-Leu-Tyr-Leu-Asp-Thr-Ser-Asp-Val. The formyl methionine was cleaved off in a portion of the sample. The N-terminal amino acid sequence was in full agreement with the sequence submitted by Isomura and co-workers2 (EMBL entry ECD188; SwissProt entry P78,055). Examination of the comparative SDS-gel electrophoretic mobility of the novelE. coli recombinant aldolase with a number of known reference proteins indicated a subunit mass for the purified protein of 24,000 ± 1,000 (Fig. 2). By using a Q-TOF electrospray tandem mass spectrometer, the molecular mass of FSA was determined to 22,998 (Fig. 3). This was in excellent agreement with the mass calculated from the deduced protein sequence (including the initial f-Met) of 22,997 Da (SwissProt entry P78,055). The molecular mass of native E. coli recombinant aldolase was judged by gel filtration with reference proteins of known molecular masses ranging from 12 to 400 kDa. Active aldolase was eluted at a volume of 152 ml of buffer. In a logarithmic plot of elution volumeversus molecular mass an average mass of 257,000 ± 20,000 Da was calculated. This points to either a decameric or dodecameric structure of E. coli Fru-6-P aldolase, consisting of 10 or 12 identical subunits, respectively. The influence of different buffer substances, pH values, and temperature on the activity of the enzyme as well as the storage stability were analyzed using enzyme assay I (see “Experimental Procedures”). The auxiliary enzymes were first checked for activity under the different reaction conditions and were added to the reaction mixture in excess. As buffer substances, Tris, glycylglycine, Hepes, imidazole, 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid, or phosphate were used. Of these, glycylglycine (50 mm) was the best buffer compound. Optimal activity was found around pH 8.5, with a broad range of activity in buffers from pH 6.0–12.0. FSA displayed a broad temperature optimum and was active in the range from 20 to 75 °C. Although no significant loss of activity was detected after 600 h of incubation at 45 °C (in glycylglycine buffer, pH 8.0), the respective half-lives of the enzyme were 200 h at 55 °C, 30 h at 65 °C, and 16 h at 75 °C. A significant loss in activity was found in Tris buffers at concentrations higher than 10 mm pointing to a reaction of Tris with the enzyme. The purified protein could be stored frozen at −20 °C in the presence of 1 mm dithiothreitol with a loss of activity of about 20–40%. At 4 °C in glycylglycine buffer, the loss of activity was 20% per month. Alternatively, the enzyme could be lyophilized and stored at −20 °C for several months. FSA was inhibited by glycerol, inorganic phosphate, and arabinose 5-phosphate but not by EDTA (at 10 mm). Rapid loss of activity was seen if kept in contact with glycerol (see Fig.4 a). After 10 min of incubation in the presence of 20% glycerol, a decrease of more than 70% of enzyme activity was found. This inhibition was fully reversible (by dilution or removal through ultrafiltration) and appeared to be of the uncompetitive type. Inorganic phosphate was a competitive inhibitor with an apparent Ki value of 0.22 mm(see Fig. 4 b). Arabinose 5-phosphate was a competitive inhibitor (Ki of 0.07 mm; data not shown). The kinetic constantsKm and Vmax were determined in 50 mm glycylglycine buffer, at pH 8.5 and 30 °C. The cleavage of fructose 6-phosphate was monitored by enzyme assay I (see “Experimental Procedures”). When aldolase activities with different donor and acceptor compounds were compared, theVmax values of the standard reaction with Fru-6-P were determined each time as a control and were set 100%. No cleavage products were obtained from fructose, fructose 1-phosphate, glucose 6-phosphate, sedoheptulose 1,7-bisphosphate, xylulose 5-phosphate, ribulose 5-phosphate, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (up to 100 mm final concentrations). Neither were these compounds inhibitors of the standard reactio"

We reported previously thatRce1-deficient mice died during late gestation or soon after birth. We hypothesized that Icmt deficiency might cause a milder phenotype, in part because of reports suggesting the existence of more than one activity for methylating isoprenylated proteins. To address this hypothesis and also to address the issue of other methyltransferase activities, we generatedIcmt-deficient mice. Contrary to our expectation,Icmt deficiency caused a more severe phenotype thanRce1 deficiency, with virtually all of the knockout embryos (Icmt−/−) dying by mid-gestation. An analysis of chimeric mice produced from Icmt−/− embryonic stem cells showed that the Icmt−/− cells retained the capacity to contribute to some tissues (e.g. skeletal muscle) but not to others (e.g. brain). Lysates from Icmt−/− embryos lacked the ability to methylate either recombinant K-Ras or small molecule substrates (e.g. N-acetyl-S-geranylgeranyl-l-cysteine).

G., Ambroziak, P., Kim, E., Clarke, S., The Enzymes, 3rd Ed., Tamanoi, F., Sigman, D. G., 21, 2001, 156, 213, Academic Press, San Diego, CA.Google Scholar). Several groups have hypothesized that inhibiting the endoprotease or the methyltransferase might retard the growth of tumors caused by mutation-activated Ras proteins (1Young, S. G., Ambroziak, P., Kim, E., Clarke, S., The Enzymes, 3rd Ed., Tamanoi, F., Sigman, D. G., 21, 2001, 156, 213, Academic Press, San Diego, CA.Google Scholar, 2Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J.

No specific high affinity inhibitors suitable for animal testing have been developed, either for the endoprotease or for the methyltransferase. Just as importantly, neither the spectrum of substrates nor the physiologic importance of the two processing steps has been explored fully. This is particularly the case for the methyltransferase. To define the physiologic relevance of the post-isoprenylation processing steps, our laboratory generated and characterized mice lacking the endoprotease Rce1 (8Kim E. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Taylor B. Ashby M. Shannon K. Casey P.J. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8383-8390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Membranes fromRce1-deficient embryos and cells were completely unable to carry out the endoproteolytic processing of Ras and a host of other CAAX proteins. Surprisingly, the consequences of knocking out Rce1 in the mouse were relatively mild. Although most of the Rce1 knockout mice died before birth, the embryos remained viable until late in gestation, and as late as embryonic day 18.5 many were normal in size, appeared healthy, and had no obvious histologic abnormalities. A few of the Rce1 knockout mice were born and lived for a few weeks. A methyltransferase for mammalian CAAX proteins, isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (Icmt), has been identified recently (5Dai Q. Choy E. Chiu V. Romano J. Slivka S.R. Steitz S.A. Michaelis S. Philips M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15030-15034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) and shown to be located in the endoplasmic reticulum (5Dai Q.

We used gene-targeting techniques to produce a mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell line lacking both Icmt alleles and documented that membranes from those cells lacked the ability to methylate recombinant K-Ras (10Bergo M.O. Leung G.K. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Casey P.C. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17605-17610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It is important to note, however, that existing reports have raised the possibility that certain isoprenylated proteins might be methylated by other enzymatic activities, at least in some cell types. For example, Giner and Rando (11Giner J.-L. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15116-15123Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) concluded that there were distinct methyltransferase activities for the two classes of carboxyl-methylated isoprenylated proteins, the CAAX proteins and the CXC Rab proteins (11Giner J.-L. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15116-15123Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). That conclusion was based on a variety of reciprocal inhibition studies with different methyltransferase substrates and inhibitors. The goal of the current study was to generate Icmt knockout mice, both to define the physiologic consequences of Icmtdeficiency and to further define biochemical roles of Icmt. Based in part on the report of an additional methyltransferase activity (11Giner J.-L. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15116-15123Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), our a priori prediction was that Icmt-deficient mice might be affected less severely than the Rce1-deficient mice and might even be viable. We also predicted thatIcmt-deficient cells might retain the capacity to methylate the CXC-containing Rab proteins. As outlined in this report, both of those expectations were dashed by our experimental results. A sequence replacement gene-targeting vector designed to replace exon 1 of the mouseIcmt gene with a neomycin-resistance gene (10Bergo M.O. Leung G.K. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Casey P.C. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17605-17610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) was electroporated into 129/SvJae ES cells, and targeted cells (Icmt+/−) were identified on Southern blots with a 5′-flanking probe (10Bergo M.O.

Two clones, each with a single neointegration, were used to produce Icmt+/− mice. Timed matings of Icmt+/− mice were performed to assess the viability of homozygotes (Icmt−/−) at different stages of development. The genotype of each embryo was determined by Southern blot analysis (10Bergo M.O. Leung G.K. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Casey P.C. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17605-17610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Icmt−/− fibroblasts were produced from mouse embryos as previously described (8Kim E. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Taylor B. Ashby M. Shannon K. Casey P.J. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8383-8390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To assess the contribution of Icmt-deficient ES cells to different tissues, two independent lines of Icmt−/− ES cells (10Bergo M.O. Leung G.K. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Casey P.C. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17605-17610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts. Ten male chimeric mice were obtained; all were 35–75% chimeras as judged by coat color. At 8 weeks of age, the mice were sacrificed, and genomic DNA was purified from multiple tissues and analyzed by Southern blot with a 32P-labeled Icmt probe. The ratio ofIcmt− to Icmt+ bands in each tissue was determined by phosphorimager. Embryos were harvested and immediately placed in ice-cold buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl), supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The embryos were homogenized with a Polytron and then centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min to remove debris. The protein concentration of the homogenate was determined with a Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). To measure Icmt activity, lysates (40–100 μg) were incubated with 10 μm S-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14C]methionine (55 Ci/mol, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and 50 μm of eitherN-acetyl-S-geranylgeranyl-l-cysteine (AGGC, Biomol) orN-acetyl-S-farnesyl-l-cysteine (AFC, Biomol). Recombinant farnesyl-K-Ras (7Otto J.C. Kim E. Young S.G. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8379-8382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) and recombinant geranylgeranyl-Rab proteins (described below) were also tested as methyl-accepting substrates. The total volume for the methylation reactions was 50 μl. After a 30-min incubation at 37 °C, the methylation reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of 1.0 mNaOH containing 0.1% SDS. Most of the reaction mixture (90 μl) was spotted onto a pleated 2 × 8-cm filter paper wedged in the neck of a 20-ml scintillation vial containing 5 ml of scintillation fluid (ScintiSafe Econo 1, Fisher). The vials were capped and incubated at room temperature for 5 h to allow the [14C]methanol (formed by base hydrolysis of methyl esters) to diffuse into the scintillation fluid (4Clarke S. Vogel J.P. Deschenes R.J. Stock J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4643-4647Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The filter papers were then removed, and the vials were counted for radioactivity. Methyltransferase activity (pmol/mg total cell protein/min) was calculated after subtracting the background level of methylation in control reactions (lysates andS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14C]methionine but no isoprenylated substrates). For the Rab methylation assays, control reactions also contained Rab1A, a CC Rab protein that does not undergo carboxyl methylation (12Smeland T.E. Seabra M.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10712-10716Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Recombinant Rab proteins, Rab escort protein (REP), and Rab geranylgeranyltransferase (RabGGTase) were purified as previously described (13Armstrong S.A. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Seabra M.C. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 257: 30-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 14Cremers F.P.M. Armstrong S.A. Seabra M.C. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2111-2117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Seabra M.C. James G.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 84: 251-260PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, bovine Rab3B, murine Rab3D, and human Rab6 were expressed as N-terminal histidine-tagged fusion proteins inEscherichia coli with pET14b (Novagen, Madison, WI) as the expression vector for Rab3B and Rab6 and pRSET (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for Rab3D. The proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using a Ni2+-Sepharose resin. RabGGTase was expressed in Sf9 insect cells by coinfection with baculoviruses coding for both the α- and β-subunits and then purified by cation exchange chromatography followed by gel filtration chromatography. REP was also expressed in Sf9 cells as a C-terminal histidine-tagged fusion protein and was purified by Ni2+-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Geranylgeranylated Rab·REP complexes (REP·RabGG) were formed in vitro by incubating Rab proteins with RabGGTase, and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) in the presence of limiting amounts of REP (16Pereira-Leal, J. B., Gomes, A. Q., and Seabra, M. C. (2001) Methods Mol. Biol., in press.Google Scholar). Rab protein (10 μm) was incubated with 2.5 μm REP1, 0.7 μmRabGGTase, and 20 μm unlabeled GGPP (Sigma) in a 50 mm sodium HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, containing 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.05 mm protein-grade Nonidet P-40 (Calbiochem). The 50 μl reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 45 min. The complexes were stored at 4 °C with 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin as a carrier protein. To determine the efficiency of geranylgeranylation, parallel reactions were performed in the presence of [3H]GGPP ([1-3H] all-trans-GGPP, 15–30 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and the incorporated [3H]GG was measured by scintillation after filtration through glass fiber filters (15Seabra M.C. James G.L. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 84: 251-260PubMed Google Scholar). A 262-base pair32P-labeled Icmt cDNA probe (spanning exons 1–3 of the Icmt gene) was hybridized to a mouse multiple-tissue poly(A)+ RNA blot (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA); hybridization and washing were performed as described previously (7Otto J.C. Kim E. Young S.G. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8379-8382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The blot was exposed to x-ray film for 72 h at −80 °C. To assess the level of methylation substrates within cells, whole-cell lysates (Icmt+/+, Icmt+/−, andIcmt−/−) were incubated withS-adenosyl-l-[methyl-14C]methionine and recombinant Ste14p (10 μg of membrane protein from Sf9 cells that overexpress yeast STE14) (7Otto J.C. Kim E. Young S.G. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8379-8382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The amount of base-labile methylation was quantified as described above. Icmt+/− mice were produced from two independent lines of ES cells. Genotyping of 21-day-old offspring fromIcmt+/− intercrosses revealed that about two-thirds (58 of 82) were heterozygotes, and the remainder were wild-type. Genotyping of embryos revealed that Icmt−/− embryos constituted 25% of the litter until embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5, Fig.1 B). By E11.5, there were only a few viable Icmt−/− embryos; those embryos had beating hearts and red blood cells but were far smaller than heterozygous and wild-type mice (Fig. 1 C). Virtually all of theIcmt−/− mice died by E12.5, several days before the first of the homozygous Rce1 knockout embryos started to die (8Kim E. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Taylor B. Ashby M. Shannon K. Casey P.J. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8383-8390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Histologic studies of Icmt−/− embryos did not reveal a specific cause of death. To gain insights into the importance of Icmt in the formation of different organs, we generated male chimeric mice (n = 10) with two lines of Icmt−/− ES cells (10Bergo M.O. Leung G.K. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Casey P.C. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17605-17610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and performed Southern blots to assess the relative capacities of Icmt+/+ and Icmt−/− cells to populate different tissues (Fig.2 A). The Icmt−/− cells contributed significantly to the development of skeletal muscle, as shown by the 1:1 ratio of Icmt− and Icmt+ band intensities in the genomic DNA of that tissue but made a negligible contribution to the formation of the brain. TheIcmt− band was virtually undetectable in brain, and theIcmt+/Icmt− band ratio was about 8:1. HighIcmt+/Icmt− ratios were also present in liver and testis. Interestingly, the extent to which Icmt−/− cells contributed to the formation of each tissue appeared to be inversely correlated with the normal levels of Icmtexpression in that tissue. Thus, as documented by a Northern blot (Fig.2 B), Icmt expression in wild-type mice was quite low in skeletal muscle, but high in the brain and liver. Measurements of enzyme activity in wild-type mice were in general agreement with the Northern blot results, with high activity levels in the brain, testis, and liver and low levels in skeletal muscle (Fig. 2 C). To determine whether Icmt−/− embryos retained the capacity to methylate isoprenylated proteins, perhaps through a redundant enzymatic activity, we tested the capacity of lysates ofIcmt−/− embryos to methylate farnesyl-K-Ras (Fig.3 A). No enzymatic activity above background levels was identified. We considered the possibility that a redundant enzymatic activity might not be able to methylate K-Ras and therefore tested the ability of Icmt−/− lysates to methylate two small molecule substrates,N-acetyl-S-geranylgeranyl-l-cysteine andN-acetyl-S-farnesyl-l-cysteine (Fig. 3 B). The results of those studies were identical to the results of the K-Ras experiments, loss of activity in lysates ofIcmt−/− embryos. We also measured methyltransferase activity against small molecule substrates in lysates fromIcmt+/− embryos and tissues from adult Icmt+/− mice (liver, brain, and heart). Activities were invariably reduced by 50% (data not shown), not less than 50%, as would be the case if there were redundant methyltransferase activities. Consistent with the apparent absence of a redundant methyltransferase activity, there was a substantial accumulation of methyltransferase substrates in lysates from Icmt−/− embryos (i.e. an accumulation of cellular proteins that could be methylated by the yeast ortholog of Icmt, Ste14p, Fig.3 C). An earlier study (11Giner J.-L. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15116-15123Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) concluded that distinctS-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase activities were responsible for the methylation of the CAAXand CXC groups of isoprenylated proteins. That result would predict that lysates from Icmt−/− embryos would retain the ability to methylate CXC Rab proteins. This was not the case. Lysates from Icmt−/− cells were incapable of methylating three different CXC Rab proteins, although those proteins were readily methylated by lysates fromIcmt+/+ cells (Fig. 4). The importance of Rab methylation by Icmt remains obscure, but one obvious possibility is that it is important for membrane targeting. In preliminary experiments, we have used cell fractionation experiments and the expression of GFP·Rab fusions to assess the localization of Rab6 (a Golgi CXC Rab protein) in Icmt−/− andIcmt+/+ cells but did not observe noticeable differences (data not shown). Icmt catalyzes the formation of a carboxyl methyl ester on the isoprenylcysteine of CAAX proteins. The methylation reaction is the last of three sequential CAAX-box modifications and the most subtle, at least from the perspective of the primary structure of the protein. Methylation changes the molecular mass of the protein by a mere 14 daltons versus several hundred for both the isoprenylation and endoprotease steps. We had predicted thatIcmt-deficiency might produce a relatively mild phenotype. First, deletion of the methyltransferase gene in yeast (i.e. STE14) has little impact apart from its effect on the mating pheromone a-factor (17Hrycyna C.A. Sapperstein S.K. Clarke S. Michaelis S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1699-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), and a-factor apparently does not exist in mammals. Second, Rce1 deficiency produced a relatively mild phenotype, with some knockout mice surviving for a few weeks after birth. Thus, we expected that murine Icmt deficiency would produce a similarly mild phenotype, or perhaps even milder given the studies suggesting the existence of additional Icmt-like activities in mammalian cells (11Giner J.-L. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 15116-15123Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 18Philips M.R. Staud R. Pillinger M. Feoktistov A. Volker C. Stock J.B. Weissmann G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2283-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Our a prioriprediction was not upheld. Icmt deficiency yielded a more severe phenotype, with most Icmt−/− embryos dying between E10.5 and E11.5. Importantly, our biochemical studies with embryo lysates did not uncover a residual or redundant Icmt-like activity, and the lysates manifested a striking increase in Ste14p substrates. The Icmt−/− embryos probably died becauseIcmt-deficient cells failed to grow and contribute to the formation of various organs. Southern blots of tissues from chimeric mice generated with Icmt−/− cells revealed thatIcmt-deficient cells are severely defective in their capacity to contribute to the formation of certain organs (e.g. liver and brain) although they retained the ability to contribute to the formation of others (e.g. skeletal muscle). 2Although no Southern blots were performed on skin DNA, the percentage of brown fur on the chimeric animals suggested that Icmt-deficient ES cells are fairly robust in contributing to the formation of the hair follicles. We doubt that this finding was spurious, for several reasons. First, similar results were obtained with two lines of Icmt−/− ES cells. Second, there was a reasonably strong inverse correlation between normal levels ofIcmt expression and the ability of Icmt−/− ES cells to contribute to the formation of a tissue. Third, theIcmt chimeric mouse experiments were performed in parallel with studies with Zmpste24−/− ES cells, 3Zmpste24 is the mouse ortholog ofAFC1 (STE24) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 27Fujimura-Kamada K. Nouvet F.J. Michaelis S. J.

Why were the developmental abnormalities more severe inIcmt−/− embryos than in Rce1−/− embryos? One possibility is simply that Icmt has more substrates than Rce1. Indeed, our experiments revealed for the first time that the CXC Rab proteins (which are not processed by Rce1) are methylated by Icmt. Rab proteins terminating in CXC and CC are geranylgeranylated at both cysteines (12Smeland T.E. Seabra M.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10712-10716Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The CXC Rab proteins, but not the CC Rab proteins, are then carboxyl-methylated (12Smeland T.E. Seabra M.C. Goldstein J.L.

For example, Rab3a and Rab4, which terminate in Cys-Ala-Cys and Cys-Gly-Cys, respectively, are carboxyl methylated (19Li G. Stahl P.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 471-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,20Farnsworth C.C. Kawata M. Yoshida Y. Takai Y. Gelb M.H. Glomset J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6196-6200Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), whereas Rab1A and Rab2, which terminate in Cys-Cys, are not (12Smeland T.E. Seabra M.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10712-10716Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar,23Wei C. Lutz R. Sinensky M. Macara I.G. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 467-473PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, replacement of the CXC terminus of Rab3a with CC abolishes methylation, whereas the opposite result is obtained when the CC terminus of Rab1A is replaced with a CXC sequence (12Smeland T.E. Seabra M.C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 10712-10716Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our current studies show that the methylation of the CXC Rab proteins is carried out by Icmt, the same methyltransferase that is responsible for CAAX protein methylation. Thus, Icmt almost certainly has more substrates than Rce1, which has no role in Rab protein processing. If these additional substrates (i.e. the Rab proteins) lie at the root of the more severe developmental defects in Icmt deficiency, one might predict that the methylation of Rab proteins has a significant impact on their function. In the case of Rab6, we did not observe a detectable effect of methylation on the intracellular localization of the protein, but we caution against overinterpreting those results. Those experiments did not assess other potential effects of Rab methylation such as effects on protein function or stability. A second potential explanation for the more severe developmental problems in the Icmt−/− embryos is that the positioning of the carboxylate anion on CAAX proteins has a profound influence on the binding of isoprenylated proteins to membranes, protein partners, or both. Both Rce1 and Icmtdeficiency eliminate the carboxyl methylation of CAAXproteins and thereby leave the protein with a C-terminal carboxylate anion rather than an α-methyl ester. However, the position of the carboxylate anion differs, being within the isoprenylcysteine residue in the setting of Icmt deficiency and located three amino acids downstream in the setting of Rce1 deficiency. Methylation itself is clearly important for membrane binding: methylatingN-acetyl-S-farnesyl-l-cysteine increases the partitioning of that molecule into the organic phase of an n-octanol/water mixture (24Parish C.A. Rando R.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8473-8477Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and methylating farnesylated CAAX peptides increases their binding to synthetic liposomes (25Silvius J.R. l'Heureux F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3014-3022Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The impact of carboxylate anion positioning (i.e. on the prenylcysteine or on the end of the C-terminal tripeptide) on lipid-binding properties has not been studied in a similar fashion. However, it is easy to imagine that a more vicinal carboxylate anion (i.e. with Icmt deficiency) might be more potent in inhibiting the association of the isoprenyl lipid with membranes. The positioning of the carboxylate anion might also affect prenylation-dependent protein-protein interactions. Chenet al. (26Chen Z. Otto J.C. Bergo M.O. Young S.G. Casey P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 41251-41257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) have shown that the binding of K-Ras to microtubules is dependent on the structure of the C terminus. Farnesylated K-Ras binds to microtubules, but this binding is eliminated by the Rce1-mediated release of the last three amino acids. Binding to microtubules is restored by carboxyl methylation. Thus, in the case of K-Ras, the precise structure of the C terminus affects protein-protein interactions. These data, along with the aforementioned considerations regarding membrane binding, have made the “carboxylate anion positioning” hypothesis quite intriguing. Of course, the effect of carboxylate anion positioning could differ for different CAAX proteins. A third potential explanation for the more severe phenotype inIcmt-deficient mice compared with Rce1-deficient mice is that some CAAX proteins might undergo endoproteolytic processing in the absence of Rce1. According to this hypothesis, the milder phenotype of Rce1 deficiency could reflect the fact that Rce1 processes fewer CAAXprotein substrates than Icmt. This possibility is reasonable, given that a second yeast protein, Afc1p (Ste24p),3 assists Rce1p in the removal of the -AAX from the farnesylated mating pheromone a-factor. Thus far, however, there has been no direct demonstration that the murine ortholog of AFC1,Zmpste24,3 has any role in CAAXprotein processing (1Young, S. G., Ambroziak, P., Kim, E., Clarke, S., The Enzymes, 3rd Ed., Tamanoi, F., Sigman, D. G., 21, 2001, 156, 213, Academic Press, San Diego, CA.Google Scholar). The development and characterization of Icmt-deficient mice has clarified the role of Icmt in mouse development and in the processing of isoprenylated proteins. Just as importantly, these studies have suggested new hypotheses. For example, it will now be of interest to determine the importance of methylation in Rab protein function and to test the carboxylate anion positioning hypothesis. In addition, the production of Icmt-deficient fibroblasts opens the door to addressing the importance of carboxyl methylation in the transformation of fibroblasts by mutation-activated forms of the Ras proteins.

https://openalex.org/W2110822551,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae takes up siderophore-bound iron through two distinct systems, one that requires siderophore transporters of the ARN family and one that requires the high affinity ferrous iron transporter on the plasma membrane. Uptake through the plasma membrane ferrous iron transporter requires that the iron first must dissociate from the siderophore and undergo reduction to the ferrous form. FRE1 and FRE2 encode cell surface metalloreductases that are required for reduction and uptake of free ferric iron. The yeast genome contains five additional FRE1 and FRE2 homologues, four of which are regulated by iron and the major iron-dependent transcription factor, Aft1p, but whose function remains unknown. Fre3p was required for the reduction and uptake of ferrioxamine B-iron and for growth on ferrioxamine B, ferrichrome, triacetylfusarinine C, and rhodotorulic acid in the absence of Fre1p and Fre2p. By indirect immunofluorescence, Fre3p was expressed on the plasma membrane in a pattern similar to that of Fet3p, a component of the high affinity ferrous transporter. Enterobactin, a catecholate siderophore, was not a substrate for Fre3p, and reductive uptake required either Fre1p or Fre2p. Fre4p could facilitate utilization of rhodotorulic acid-iron when the siderophore was present in higher concentrations. We propose that Fre3p and Fre4p are siderophore-iron reductases and that the apparent redundancy of the FRE genes confers the capacity to utilize iron from a variety of siderophore sources."

We find here that MEK5 and ERK5 cooperate with the RafBXB effectors MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 to induce foci. To further understand MEK5-ERK5-dependent signaling, we examined potential MEK5-ERK5 effectors that might influence focus-forming activity. Consistent with results from our focus-formation assays, constitutively active variants of MEK5 and MEK1 synergize to activate NF-κB, and MEK5 and ERK5 are required for activation of NF-κB by RafBXB. The MEK5-ERK5 pathway is also sufficient to activate both NF-κB and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase. Our results support the hypothesis that NF-κB and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase are involved in MEK5-ERK5-dependent focus formation and may serve as integration points for ERK5 and ERK1/2 signaling.

Cell Res. 1999; 253: 255-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar). These cascades consist of a MEK kinase, or MEKK, that phosphorylates and activates a MAP/ERK kinase, or MEK. The dual specificity MEKs phosphorylate MAP kinases on tyrosine and threonine residues, which substantially increases the activity of the MAP kinases. The active MAP kinases subsequently phosphorylate transcription factors, downstream kinases, and other substrates. The currently known members of the MAP kinase family include ERKs 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7, and multiple c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38 isoforms. ERK5, with its 816 amino acids, is close to twice the size of many of the other MAP kinases (3Zhou G. Bao Z.Q. Dixon J.E. J. Biol.

Comm. 1995; 213: 715-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The difference in size is because of a stretch of ∼400 amino acids C-terminal to the kinase domain that do not display any sequence similarity to known proteins and have no known function. On the other hand, the catalytic domain, located at its N terminus, is ∼50% identical to ERK2. ERK5 is regulated by a wide variety of mitogens and cell stresses by mechanisms that sometimes involve Ras or Src (5Abe J.-I. Kusuhara M. Ulevitch R.J. Berk B.C. Lee J.-D. J. Biol.

Although its activity is not sufficient to activate ERK5, Raf-1 appears to be involved in regulation of ERK5 by oncogenic Ras in 293 cells (7English J.M. Pearson G. Baer R. Cobb M.H. J. Biol.

The ability of ERK5 to activate MEF2 isoforms appears to allow it to positively regulate intracellular concentrations of c-Jun (14Chiariello M. Marinissen M.J. Gutkind J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1747-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that increasing the activity of the ERK5 pathway by expression of MEK5DD, an activated mutant of MEK5, in NIH3T3 cells is not sufficient to stimulate the formation of foci (8English J.M.

We were, however, able to uncover a role for the ERK5 pathway in focus formation when observed in a RafBXB-dependent signaling background. Foci induced by RafBXB are increased in number by enhancing the activity of the ERK5 pathway and are decreased in number by disruption of MEK5 or ERK5 function (8English J.M. Pearson G.

Thus, under some conditions, MEK5 and ERK5 can impact growth and morphological transformation. Transfection of RafBXB into cells alters the activity and localization of a large repertoire of signaling molecules including ERK1/2 (15Naumann U. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Rapp U.R. Recent Res. Cancer Res. 1997; 143 (., 237–244): 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 17Monia B.P. Anti-cancer Drug Des. 1997; 12: 327-339PubMed Google Scholar). Our focus assays with RafBXB and MEK5DD suggested that Raf activates the ERK1/2 pathway to produce the synergy in focus formation observed with MEK5 and ERK5 (8English J.M. Pearson G. Hockenberry T.

In support of this idea, we now find that MEK5DD and MEK1R4F, an active mutant of MEK1, cooperate to form foci of growth and morphologically transformed NIH3T3 cells. In addition, we explore potential mechanisms by which the MEK5-ERK5 pathway might influence focus formation. We find that MEK5DD and MEK1R4F synergize to activate an NF-κB-sensitive reporter, MEK5 and ERK5 are involved in RafBXB activation of NF-κB, and that the MEK5-ERK5 pathway is sufficient to activate NF-κB.

Focus assays were performed as described previously (21Mineo C. Anderson R.W. White M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10345-10348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A primary mediator of Raf-dependent signaling is the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 MAP kinase cascade. However, Raf-1 coordinates the activities of signaling pathways that are independent of ERK1/2 (22Pearson G. Bumeister R. Henry D.O. Cobb M.H. White M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37303-37306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Despite the fact that Raf-1 does not apparently activate MEK5, our earlier results demonstrate that ERK5 and MEK5 are required for formation of foci of growth and morphologically transformed cells induced by the activated Raf variant RafBXB (8English J.M. Pearson G. Hockenberry T. Shivakumar L. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31588-31592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the ERK5 pathway is one of the other Raf-1-dependent pathways. To define further the other Raf-mediated events that allow MEK5 and ERK5 to influence focus formation, we tested the cooperativity of ERK5 and ERK1/2 pathways to induce cellular transformation. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with vector alone, MEK5DD, an active mutant of MEK1 (MEK1R4F), or MEK5DD and MEK1R4F together. MEK5DD alone, as expected, did not induce foci. MEK1R4F clearly induced foci (Fig.1), although much less efficiently than RafBXB (not shown; see Ref. 8English J.M. Pearson G. Hockenberry T. Shivakumar L. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31588-31592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The combination of MEK5DD and MEK1R4F produced significantly more foci than MEK1R4F alone (Fig. 1). These findings indicate that the ERK1/2 and ERK5 pathways can act synergistically to induce foci of growth and morphologically transformed cells. SRE, integration points for ERK1/2, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, and p38 signaling are present in many serum-induced genes, notably that of the proto-oncogene c-Fos (23Gille H. Sharrocks A.D. Shaw P.E. Nature. 1992; 358: 414-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar, 24Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J.

The SRE is regulated by both serum response factors and ternary complex factors, including Elk-1 and Sap1a. ERK5 might influence SRE activity, because it has been shown to phosphorylate and activate Sap1a (9Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). It is possible then that a synergistic enhancement in the transcription of SRE-sensitive genes could occur when MEK5DD and MEK1R4F are coexpressed, which might contribute to the cooperation seen in our focus assays. We tested this possibility by transfecting NIH3T3 cells with an SRE-driven reporter and empty vector, MEK5DD, MEK1R4F, or MEK5DD and MEK1R4F together. MEK5DD neither significantly influenced the SRE reporter by itself, nor did it enhance MEK1R4F activation of the reporter (Fig. 2 A). It seems unlikely then that the MEK5-ERK5 pathway influences morphological transformation through genes containing serum response elements. NF-κB activity is influenced by MAP kinases and is required for focus formation induced by oncogenic Ras and RafBXB (28Finco T.S. Westwick J.K. Norris J.L. Beg A.A. Der C.J. Baldwin Jr., A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24113-24116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 29Baumann B. Weber C.K. Troppmair J. Whiteside S. Israel A. Rapp U.R. Wirth T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4615-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Using a luciferase reporter linked to a multimerized NF-κB-sensitive element, we tested the ability of MEK5DD and MEK1R4F to synergize in activating NF-κB family transcription factors. NIH3T3 cells were cotransfected with the NF-κB reporter and vector alone, MEK5DD, MEK1R4F, or MEK5DD plus MEK1R4F. MEK5DD was unable to activate the NF-κB-dependent reporter on its own; however, it did enhance NF-κB reporter activity stimulated by MEK1R4F (Fig.2 B). These results are consistent with the idea that MEK5DD may influence MEK1R4F-stimulated focus formation by enhancing activation of NF-κB by MEK1R4F. We have previously found that the MEK5-ERK5 module influences RafBXB-stimulated transformation of NIH3T3 cells. Although neither MEK5 nor ERK5 is activated directly by RafBXB, focus assays indicate that MEK5 and ERK5 participate in a subset of RafBXB-stimulated molecular events (8English J.M. Pearson G. Hockenberry T. Shivakumar L. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31588-31592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Our current data indicate that the MEK5-ERK5 pathway influences NF-κB activity and, therefore, may also be involved in activation of NF-κB by RafBXB. To test this possibility we assayed the effects of MEK5KM, ERK5KM, and ERK5CatKM (a truncated variant containing amino acids 1–451 of ERK5) on activation of the NF-κB reporter by RafBXB. MEK5KM and ERK5KM inhibited RafBXB activation of the NF-κB reporter (Fig.3 A). Interestingly, deletion of amino acids 452–816 renders ERK5 unable to influence NF-κB activity (Fig. 3 A). Consistent with this result, ERK5CatKM does not inhibit RafBXB-induced focus formation (not shown). MEK5KM and ERK5KM do not affect the ability of the NIK (Fig. 3 B) or MEKK1 (not shown) to activate the NF-κB reporter, which suggests that the ability of MEK5-ERK5 to influence NF-κB activation is pathway-specific. Activation of the serum response element by RafBXB often correlates with focus formation (30Kortenjann M. Thomae O. Shaw P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4815-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether the expression of dominant negative MEK5 or ERK5 affects RafBXB activation of a luciferase reporter gene fused to the SRE. Neither dominant negative MEK5 nor ERK5 had an effect on the ability of RafBXB to activate the SRE-dependent reporter under conditions in which they do inhibit RafBXB activation of NF-κB (Fig. 3 C). The failure of the MEK5-ERK5 kinase-dead proteins to interfere with SRE activation is a measure of their failure to block RafBXB-dependent activation of ERK1/2, as shown using a Raf mutant that cannot activate ERK1/2 (22Pearson G. Bumeister R. Henry D.O. Cobb M.H. White M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37303-37306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Based on these results we conclude that dominant negative MEK5 and ERK5 are able to inhibit a subset of RafBXB-stimulated transcriptional responses, such as NF-κB activation; the inhibition of NF-κB activity may be one of the factors that results in a decreased number of foci. In NIH3T3 cells the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway stimulates NF-κB through the production of autocrine factors, possibly HbEGF, which act on the EGF receptor (31Troppmair J. Hartkamp J. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). MEK1R4F likely utilizes a similar pathway based on epistasis. Consistent with this possibility, increases in ERK1/2 activity correlate with the production of HbEGF (32McCarthy S.A. Samuels M.L. Pritchard C.A. Abraham J.A. McMahon M. Genes Dev. 1995; : 1953-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), a potential convergence point for MEK5DD and MEK1R4F signaling. We used a luciferase reporter gene linked to the mouse HbEGF promoter to monitor the effects of MEK5DD and MEK1R4F on HbEGF transcription. We found that MEK5DD did not enhance MEK1R4Fdependent activation of the HbEGF reporter (Fig. 4). Thus, the effect of MEK5DD on NF-κB activity is most likely not manifested at the level of HbEGF production. We and others have found that coexpression of ERK5 with MEK5DD enhances the activation of a luciferase reporter driven by GAL-MEF2C beyond that induced by MEK5DD alone (10Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Thus, we tested the possibility that coexpression of ERK5 with MEK5DD may increase the activity of the NF-κB reporter. Coexpression of MEK5DD and ERK5 did stimulate a modest activation of the NF-κB luciferase reporter (Fig. 5). These findings are consistent with the conclusion that activation of ERK5 is sufficient to stimulate NF-κB. A number of kinases, including RSKs 1–3, mitogen-activated protein kinase-associated protein kinase 2, Msk, and Mnk, are regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation (1Lewis T.S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 3854-3860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), a role for ERK5 in the regulation of these kinases has not been explored. p90 RSK has been implicated in the regulation of NF-κB (36Ghoda L. Lin X. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21281-21288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 37Schouten G.J. Vertegaal A.C. Whiteside S.T. Israel A. Toebes M. Dorsman J.C. van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3133-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), in addition to its ability to phosphorylate effectors, such as c-Fos, (38Rivera V.M. Miranti C.K. Misra R.P. Ginty D.D. Chen R.H. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6260-6273Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) which might impact morphological transformation. To test the possibility that p90 RSK may be a target of MEK5-ERK5 signaling, Cos-7 cells were transfected with cDNAs encoding HA-RSK with MEK5DD alone, ERK5 alone, or MEK5DD plus ERK5. We found that coexpression of MEK5DD and ERK5 resulted in an approximately 4-fold increase in RSK activity when compared with the activity of RSK cotransfected with empty vector, MEK5DD (Fig. 6), or ERK5 (not shown). Proliferation and differentiation require the function of a diverse array of signaling pathways. Molecules, such as Raf, that can induce these events must coordinate the actions of multiple downstream effector pathways (15Naumann U. Eisenmann-Tappe I. Rapp U.R. Recent Res. Cancer Res. 1997; 143 (., 237–244): 237-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16Joneson T. Bar-Sagi D. J. Mol. Med. 1997; 75: 587-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). We have previously demonstrated a requirement for MEK5 and ERK5, in addition to ERK1/2, in the induction of foci by RafBXB (8English J.M. Pearson G. Hockenberry T. Shivakumar L. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31588-31592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Here we show that MEK1RF4 and MEK5DD supply complementary activities to promote bypass of contact inhibition of growth. In most cases, focus formation correlates with formation of tumors in nude mice. We have explored possible mechanisms through which MEK5 and ERK5 might impact focus formation. We find that MEK5 and ERK5 are required for Raf stimulation of NF-κB, and MEK5DD synergizes with MEK1R4F to activate NF-κB. We also find that when coexpressed, MEK5 and ERK5 are sufficient for activation of NF-κB and p90 RSK. Deregulated NF-κB activity, and abnormalities in NF-κB-encoding genes or their expression, have been identified in a number of different human tumors (39Rayet B. Gelinas C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6938-6947Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). Consistent with these clinical findings, disrupting NF-κB activity is sufficient to reduce the number of foci induced by oncogenic Ras and RafBXB in NIH3T3 cells (28Finco T.S. Westwick J.K.

Whiteside S. Israel A. Rapp U.R. Wirth T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 4615-4620Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). NF-κB may influence tumor formation and focus formation through promoting cell survival and cell cycle entry (40Mayo M.W. Wang C.Y. Cogswell P.C. Rogers-Graham K.S. Lowe S.W. Der C.J. Baldwin A.S.J. Science. 1997; 278: 1812-1815Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 41Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar). ERK1/2 has been suggested to stimulate NF-κB through the production of HbEGF (31Troppmair J. Hartkamp J. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 685-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Increasing ERK5 activity, however, has no effect on HbEGF transcription, suggesting that ERK5 may modulate NF-κB through a novel mechanism. The observation of synergy between MEK1R4F and MEK5DD in activating NF-κB further suggests that ERK5 influences NF-κB by a distinct mechanism from that used by ERK1/2. p90 RSK activity is increased by oncogenes in cell culture systems (42Nebreda A.R. Gavin A.C. Science. 1999; 286: 1309-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar,43Xing J. Ginty D.D. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1996; 273: 959-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (1086) Google Scholar) and, like NF-κB, may play a multifunctional role in the formation of foci. p90 RSK is involved in the stabilization of the proto-oncogene c-Fos and can inhibit apoptosis through the phosphorylation of Bad or transcription of Bcl-2 and may stimulate chromatin remodeling in a histone 3-dependent manner (42Nebreda A.R. Gavin A.C. Science. 1999; 286: 1309-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In addition, p90 RSK phosphorylates serine 32 of IκB, a required site of phosphorylation for proteosome-mediated degradation of IκB, in response to phorbol ester treatment and overexpression of v-Src (36Ghoda L. Lin X. Greene W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21281-21288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 37Schouten G.J. Vertegaal A.C. Whiteside S.T. Israel A. Toebes M. Dorsman J.C. van der Eb A.J. Zantema A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3133-3144Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Activating both ERK5 and ERK1/2, based on their known substrate profiles, broadens the range of transcription factors and other downstream effectors that may be targeted. A coordinated increase in the activity of both kinase pathways may also result in a more pronounced effect on individual signaling activities involved in focus formation than can be generated by either pathway alone. For instance, NF-κB and p90 RSK may be integration points for two distinct activating signals. The MEK5DD and MEK1R4F activation signals could converge at a regulatory site upstream of NF-κB, or alternatively, on the NF-κB homo-and heterodimers themselves. Previous reports suggest that p90 RSK can integrate the direct phosphorylation of distinct sites by ERK1/2 and phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase to achieve a high activity state (44Williams M.R. Arthur J.S. Balendran A. van der Kaay J. Poli V. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). The MEK5-ERK5 and MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathways may increase p90 RSK activity through a similar integration mechanism. Further study will be necessary to discern whether MEK5DD influences MEK1R4F-dependent cellular effects by enhancing the activity of factors regulated by MEK1R4F, through activation of additional factors, or a combination of both.

Hyperacetylation of histones increases local accessibility of chromatin templates, enabling subsequent activation or repression of transcription by gene-specific factors, while deacetylation is frequently linked with chromatin condensation and gene silencing. Most histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs)1 are enzymes that do not bind DNA directly; instead, they are recruited to chromatin through association with distinct proteins in multiprotein complexes (3Knoepfler P.S. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1999; 99: 447-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). One of the conserved proteins that serve as an organizer for the assembly of histone deacetylases with multiple polypeptides in yeast and mammalian cells is Sin3 (4Ayer D.E. Lawrence Q.A.

The abundance and relative stability of both Sin3 and HDAC1 proteins have led to the proposal that the “core” Sin3 repressor complexes are pre-assembled and available for recruitment by transient association with gene-specific transcription factors, including Mad, MeCP2, Ikaros, p53, PLZF, nuclear hormone receptors, and yeast Ume6 whose abundance and activities are regulated (3Knoepfler P.S.

The ING1 (inhibitor of growth1) gene was recently identified as a candidate tumor suppressor in a genetic screen aimed at isolation of human genes whose expression is suppressed in cancer cells (9Garkavtsev I. Kazarov A. Gudkov A. Riabowol K. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). The ING1 gene was localized to chromosome 13q33–34 (10Garkavtsev I. Demetrick D. Riabowol K. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1997; 76: 176-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,11Toyama T. Iwase H. Watson P. Muzik H. Saettler E. Magliocco A. DiFrancesco L. Forsyth P. Garkavtsev I.

Doglioni C. Gasparotto D. Vukosavljevic T. Sulfaro S. Barzan L. Boiocchi M. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 1146-1150PubMed Google Scholar). Deregulated expression and mutations of ING1 gene were found in breast carcinomas (11Toyama T. Iwase H. Watson P. Muzik H. Saettler E. Magliocco A. DiFrancesco L. Forsyth P. Garkavtsev I. Kobayashi S. Riabowol K. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 5187-5193Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and in squamous cell carcinomas (13Gunduz M. Ouchida M. Fukushima K. Hanafusa H. Etani T. Nishioka S. Nishizaki K. Shimizu K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3143-3146PubMed Google Scholar), respectively. Ectopic expression of the originally isolated ING1 cDNA or suppression of the ING1 gene expression by antisense RNA demonstrated that ING1 is a negative regulator of cell proliferation involved in the p53 growth regulatory pathway (9,14). It has been subsequently found that the ING1 gene encodes several differentially initiated and spliced mRNAs, which have common 3′ exon and encode at least two distinct proteins in mouse (15Zeremski M. Hill J.E. Kwek S.S. Grigorian I.A. Gurova K.V. Garkavtsev I.V. Diatchenko L. Koonin E.V. Gudkov A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32172-32181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and possibly three distinct proteins in human cells (p47ING1a, p33ING1b, and p24ING1c) (13Gunduz M. Ouchida M. Fukushima K. Hanafusa H. Etani T. Nishioka S. Nishizaki K. Shimizu K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3143-3146PubMed Google Scholar,16Garkavtsev I. Nat.

Genet. 2000; 45: 177-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). All the known or anticipated ING1 protein isoforms share an identical C-terminal domain with a conserved PHD finger motif. The PHD finger motif was thought to facilitate DNA binding of proteins otherwise unrelated to ING1 (18Aasland R. Gibson T.J. Stewart A.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 56-59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar), suggesting that ING1 proteins might directly interact with DNA. Significantly, missense mutations were detected within the PHD finger and the nuclear localization motif of ING1 in some head and neck squamous cell carcinomas with allelic loss at the 13q33–34 region, suggesting that the PHD finger and the nuclear function of ING1 is important for its tumor suppressor function (13Gunduz M. Ouchida M. Fukushima K. Hanafusa H. Etani T. Nishioka S. Nishizaki K. Shimizu K. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 3143-3146PubMed Google Scholar). All functional analysis of the biological effects of ectopically expressed ING1 was so far done only with the cDNA encoding p24ING1c due to the lack of information on the alternative forms of ING1. Owing to a cloning error, the cDNA that suppressed cell growth was incorrectly termed p33ING1 in the original studies (9,14). One candidate mechanism that was proposed to be responsible for the growth suppressor function of the ING1 locus is cooperation with the p53 tumor suppressor (14Garkavtsev I. Grigorian I.A. Ossovskaya V.S. Chernov M.V. Chumakov P.M. Gudkov A.V. Nature. 1998; 391: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Neither p53 nor ING1 can cause growth inhibition when the other one is suppressed, and the p24ING1c expression has been shown to be required for transcriptional activation of the p21WAF1 promoter, a key mechanism of p53-mediated growth control. Recent analysis of mouse ING1gene structure and function suggests that the shortest of ING1 protein isoforms, the mouse equivalent of human p24ING1c, is required for the activation of p53-responsive genes. In contrast, overexpression of the longer form p37ING1, an equivalent of the human p33ING1b protein, interferes with the activation of p53-dependent promoters when p53 is stabilized after DNA damage (15Zeremski M. Hill J.E. Kwek S.S. Grigorian I.A. Gurova K.V. Garkavtsev I.V. Diatchenko L. Koonin E.V. Gudkov A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32172-32181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It appears that isoforms of ING1 protein may have different roles in growth control and that their unique N-terminal sequences may determine differences in their function. In a search for mechanisms of function of the ING1 protein, we explored ING1 associated proteins in human cells. We found differential association of p33ING1b and p24ING1c with nuclear proteins. p33ING1b resides in a complex of ∼1–2 MDa, whereas p24ING1c does not. Among p33ING1b-associated proteins are known components of the mSin3 transcriptional corepressor complex, including HDAC1. Consistently, p33ING1b is functionally associated with HDAC-dependent transcriptional repression, in reporter gene expression assays in vivo, and in histone deacetylation assays in vitro. We demonstrate that the mSin3-mediated HDAC1-dependent transcriptional repression requires the unique N-terminal 99-amino acid sequence characteristic of the p33ING1b protein, therefore defining a new, p33ING1b-specific mechanism for the function of the ING1 locus. Rabbit anti-ING1 antibodies were generated using recombinant His-epitope-tagged human p33ING1b protein prepared from Escherichia coli. Goat anti-ING1 antibodies were from Santa Cruz (sc-7566). Mouse monoclonal anti-RbAp48 antibodies were from GeneTex (MS-RBP14-PX1), and rabbit anti-Sin3A antibodies were from Santa Cruz (sc-767). Rabbit anti-HDAC1 and anti-SAP30 antibodies were generous gifts of Dr. Glen Humphrey and Dr. Robert Eisenman, respectively. Anti-FLAG M2-agarose affinity gel was from Sigma (A-1205). The FLAG epitope-tagged p33ING1b used for mammalian expression were constructed by subcloning the full-length cDNA with the tagged sequence into the pCIN4 vector (19Gu W. Malik S. Ito M. Yuan C.X. Fondell J.D. Zhang X. Martinez E. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 97-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). H1299 cells (1 × 106) were transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation on a 10-cm plate essentially as previously described with minor modifications. Five μg of pCIN4-Flag-ING1 expression plasmid with 15 μg of carrier DNA (pGEM-3) were used for transfections on each plate. Thirty hours after transfection, the cells were transferred to the same Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1000 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for selection. After 2 months' selection, single colonies were picked and expanded for Western blot analysis. The tagged cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1000 μg/ml G418, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously. Forty milliliters of the nuclear extract prepared from different cell lines was adjusted to 200 mm NaCl and 0.2% Nonidet P-40 by addition of 5m NaCl and 10% Nonidet P-40, and incubated with 300 μl of M2-agrose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C for 10 h by rotation. After five washes with BC200 with 0.2% Nonidet P-40, proteins were eluted from beads by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min with 300 μl of BC100 with 0.2% Nonidet P-40 plus 0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide. Large scale immunoprecipitation for mass spectrometric analysis was carried out with 10 mg of crude or fractionated nuclear extracts and 100 μg of affinity-purified rabbit anti-ING1 antibodies, with an excess of the purified p33ING1b antigen as a negative control. Immune complexes were isolated by binding to 100 μl of Sepharose-Protein A beads, washed five times with 100 volumes of NETN buffer, eluted, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Protein sequencing using mass spectrometry was carried out as described (20Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schlitz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Tryptic peptides that were recovered from in-gel digested protein bands were analyzed using an electrospray ion trap mass spectrometer (LCQ, Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA) coupled on-line with a capillary high performance liquid chromatography (Magic 2002, Michrom BioResources, Auburn, CA). Data derived from the mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry spectra were used to search a compiled protein data base that was composed of the protein data base NR and a six-reading frame translated expressed sequence tag data base to identify the protein using the program PROWL, which is publicly available on the World Wide Web. Immunoprecipitations were done by incubating 1 mg of HeLa nuclear protein extracts prepared according to the Dignam method, with 5–10 μg of the appropriate antibodies for 2 h at 4 °C, followed by isolation of the immune complexes on Protein A beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.). Immune complexes were washed three times with 1 ml of NETN buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) prior to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Immunoblottings were done after low voltage protein transfer (30 V, 12 h) from polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose in Tris-glycine buffer, pH 8.0, with 5% methanol. Membranes were blocked with 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20), incubated with 1:200–1:1000 dilution of the primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, washed, and incubated with 1:25000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Antibody detection was with ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies from Santa Cruz. Histone deacetylase activity was measured using acid-soluble histones that were isolated from [3H]acetate-labeled HeLa cells, by a published procedure (21Ausio J. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1421-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 22Carmen A.A. Rundlett S.E. Grunstein M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15837-15844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C with 40,000 cpm of 3H-labeled histones (∼2000 cpm/μg) in a total volume of 200 μl of HD buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2.5% glycerol). Reactions were stopped by addition of 50 μl of STOP buffer (1 m HCl, 0.16m acetic acid), extracted with two volumes of ethyl acetate, and the supernatant was counted in a scintillation counter. Assays were carried out with or without 10 mm sodium butyrate, as indicated in the figure legends. NIH3T3 cells (1 × 106) were transfected using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technologies, Inc.) with a combination of 1 μg of luciferase reporter plasmids 2Py-Luc or 6AP-Luc and 100 ng of the LacZ reporter construct (pCMV-LacZ) to normalize transfection efficiency. One hundred ng ofras expression vector (v-Ha-ras cDNA cloned in pLXSN vector under the control of the LTR promoter) and 50 ng of each of the test expression vectors FNE2DBD, pCINE2DBD:En, FN-lINGE2DBD, and FN-sINGE2DBD (shown in Fig. 4 A as1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively) were cotransfected with the reporter plasmids. Cells were harvested for luciferase and β-galactosidase assays 40 h after transfection. The luceferase and β-galactosidase enzyme activities from the extracts of transfected NIH3T3 cells were measured according the Promega protocols. Polymerase chain reaction-derived DNA fragments encoding either human p33ING1 or p24ING1 were fused individually to the N terminus of the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (amino acids 1–94). 293T cells (1 × 106, in 2.5-cm plate), were transiently cotransfected using GenePORTER (Gene Therapy Systems) with 0.5 μg of appropriate pING1-GAL4 expression vector and 1.5 μg of reporter plasmid. The reporter plasmid carried secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) gene under the control of the constitutively active SV40 early promoter with five Gal4 binding sites. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were incubated with 50 ng/ml trichostatin A (TSA), where indicated, and 12 h later cells were harvested and assayed. Expression of the GAL4 fusion proteins was determined by Western blotting with the anti-Gal4 antibody. To acquire an insight to mechanisms of ING1 function, we sought to isolate ING1-associated proteins in human cells. We fractionated HeLa nuclear extracted on a DEAE column and immunoprecipitated the endogenous ING1 protein from the 0.2m KCl fraction, which contains most of the cellular p33ING1b protein. We used mass spectrometry to identify RBP1, Sin3, and HDAC1 along others as ING1-associated proteins (Fig. 1 A.). To facilitate protein purification and to alleviate the interference of the antibody, we created an H1299-derived cell line, which stably expressed a FLAG epitope-tagged p33ING1b (19Gu W. Malik S. Ito M. Yuan C.X. Fondell J.D. Zhang X. Martinez E. Qin J. Roeder R.G. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 97-108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The FLAG-p33ING1b was overexpressed by 5–10-fold compared with the endogenous p33ING1b protein by Western. The recombinant FLAG-p33ING1b protein complex was isolated from nuclear extracts prepared from the stable line using affinity chromatography. Colloidal Coomassie Blue staining of a SDS-PAGE gel containing the p33ING1b complex revealed that ∼10 polypeptides specifically copurify with the FLAG-p33ING1b on the affinity column (Fig.1 B). More bands that were masked by antibody are clearly detected in the recombinant complex. We identified proteins that copurified with p33ING1b in the recombinant p33ING1b complexes using capillary liquid chromatography ion trap mass spectrometry (20Ogryzko V.V. Kotani T. Zhang X. Schlitz R.L. Howard T. Yang X.J. Howard B.H. Qin J. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1998; 94: 35-44Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometric analysis of the p33ING1b complexes identified the mSin3 corepressor and the HDAC1/2 histone deacetylases, as well as RbAp48, RbAp46, and SAP30. These proteins are components of a biochemically purified mSin3 complex (6Zhang Y. Iratni R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). We also identified RBP1 (23Fattaey A.R. Helin K. Dembski M.S. Dyson N. Harlow E. Vuocolo G.A. Hanobik M.G. Haskell K.M. Oliff A. Defeo-Jones D. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3149-3156PubMed Google Scholar) and two novel proteins, p42 and p35, which were not reported as components of the mSin3 complex. RbAp48, RbAp46, SAP30, and p42 were masked by antibody in the endogenous ING1 complex. These data demonstrate that p33ING1b is a component of a Sin3 containing histone deacetylase complex, thus suggesting a role for p33ING1b in transcriptional repression. We confirmed the association of Sin3 and HDAC1 with p33ING1b by reciprocal immunoblotting of the endogenous p33ING1b, HDAC1, and Sin3 immune complexes from HeLa cells (Fig.2 A). Although the polyclonal rabbit antibodies that we used in these experiments reacted with both p33ING1b and p24ING1c proteins (Fig. 2 A, lane 3), due to their identical C-terminal end, only p33ING1b was detected in the Sin3 and HDAC1 immune complexes (Fig.2 A, lines 1 and 2). Pre-incubation of the anti-ING1 antibodies with an excess of purified recombinant His-tagged p33ING1b protein prevented precipitation of the endogenous p33ING1b and p24ING1c as well as Sin3A and HDAC1 (Fig. 2 B), demonstrating specificity of the observed associations. Approximately the same amounts of Sin3A, the Sin3A-directly associated protein SAP30 (7Zhang Y. Sun Z.W. Iratni R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Hampsey M. Reinberg D. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 1021-1031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) and p33ING1b were present in either Sin3A or ING1 immune complexes of the endogenous proteins, suggesting that p33ING1b is a stoichiometric component of the Sin3A/SAP30 complex in vivo. Moreover, both p33ING1b and Sin3A immune complexes had similar amounts of histone deacetylase HDAC1 and the histone H4-binding protein RbAp48. Gel filtration analysis of partially purified p33ING1 complexes demonstrated that p33ING1b, Sin3A, HDAC1, and RbAp48 proteins coelute in complexes of an apparent size of 1–2 MDa (Fig.2 C), as reported previously for the Sin3 complex (6Zhang Y. Iratni R. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Reinberg D. Cell. 1997; 89: 357-364Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether the previously biochemically purified mSin3 complex is a stable subcomplex of this larger p33ING1bcomplex. It is possible that extensive column fraction may disrupt weaker associations to yield the stable core mSin3 complex. To establish that p33ING1b associates with functional HDAC1, we prepared the endogenous ING1 immune complexes from HeLa cells, as presented on Fig. 2 A, and assayed them for histone deacetylase activity. We found that ING1 complexes were active in deacetylating 3H-labeled histones in vitro, and this activity was comparable with the activity of HDAC1 immune complexes when assays were performed with similar HDAC1 amounts (Fig.2 D, bars 2 and 4). Addition of 10 mm sodium butyrate, an inhibitor of histone deacetylase activity (24Candido E.P. Reeves R. Davie J.R. Cell. 1978; 14: 105-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar), inhibited the reaction in both HDAC1 and ING1 immune complexes to the level of nonenzymatic [3H]acetyl release (Fig. 2 D, bars 3 and 5, compare with bar 1). In contrast, the control immunoprecipitates with various amounts of rabbit preimmune serum alone did not catalyze histone deacetylation (Fig. 2 D, bars 6 and7). Therefore, p33ING1b associates with enzymatically active HDAC1 complexes, suggesting that p33ING1b may act with Sin3 to mediate transcriptional repression by a mechanism that involves targeted recruitment of histone-modifying activity. Our analysis of endogenous proteins from HeLa cells suggest that, although we can detect and immunoprecipitate both p33ING1b and p24ING1c isoforms, only p33ING1b associates with Sin3/HDAC1 complexes (Fig. 2). p24ING1c is identical to p33ING1b except for lacking the N-terminal 99 amino acids that are characteristic of the p33ING1b isoform (16Garkavtsev I. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 373Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting that the N-terminal fragment of p33ING1b controls its assembly with the Sin3 complex. However, p24ING1c appears to be less abundant than p33ING1b in a variety of cell lines that we tested, and immunodetection of the endogenous p24ING1c in protein extracts was generally poorer or negative (Figs. 2 A, lane 5and 3 A), unless the extracts were enriched in p24ING1c by partial purification (Fig. 2 C). To eliminate the possibility that lower abundance of the p24ING1c protein rather than its different protein structure is responsible for the observed differences in the assembly pattern, we analyzed p24ING1c assembly under the condition of its overexpression, using stably transfected HT1080 fibroblasts (14Garkavtsev I. Grigorian I.A. Ossovskaya V.S. Chernov M.V. Chumakov P.M. Gudkov A.V. Nature. 1998; 391: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Quantitative Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts prepared from the transfected and untransfected HT1080 cells demonstrates that the recombinant p24ING1c was at least as abundant as the endogenous p33ING1b (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 4–6 withlanes 1–3). However, overproduction did not force p24ING1c assembly into large protein complexes (Fig. 3 B). Identical results were also obtained from stably transfected MCF7 cells. Therefore, the association with Sin3 complexes is specific to the p33ING1b isoform and is defined by its unique N-terminal sequence. We used one reporter system to test whether p33ING1b is functionally associated with transcriptional repression in vivo. In this system, the DNA binding domain (DBD) of the transcription factor Ets2 is fused with the mouse p37ING1 and p26ING1, which are human homologues of p33ING1b and p24ING1c, respectively. The structures of expression constructs are shown schematically in Fig. 4 A. A previously described fusion protein containing Ets2 DBD and the repressor domain of the Engrailed protein of Drosophila melanogaster was used as a positive control (construct 2 in Fig. 4 A) (25Li J. Thurm H. Chang H.W. Iacovoni J.S. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10885-10888Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 26Han K. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2723-2733Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The reporter plasmid contains the luciferase gene under the control of the minimal promoter of the ras-responsive c-fos gene and oncogene regulatory elements as described previously (27Galang C.K. Der C.J. Hauser C.A. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2913-2921PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 B). The reporter (2Py-luc) contains a tandem repeat of a combination of Ets and Ap1 binding sites from the enhancer of polyoma virus. The 6AP-Luc reporter plasmid containing six tandem AP-1 binding sites was used as a control. Both reporters are ras-responsive if cotransfected with ras-expressing plasmid into NIH 3T3 cells, but 6AP-Luc is insensitive to Ets. Expression plasmids were coexpressed in NIH3T3 cells with activated ras, serving as an activator of Ets-directed transcriptional activation of reporter constructs. Protein levels of the chimeric proteins were normalized using a LacZgene reporter. The results of luciferase assays are shown in Fig. 4(C and D). The long form of ING1 fused with Ets2 DBD works as a potent repressor similar to the positive control of the Engrailed repressor domain fused to Ets2 DBD (lanes 5 and 4). In contrast, the short form of ING1 exhibits a moderate repression (lane 6), which is similar to that of the Ets2 DBD alone (lane 3). This moderate repression may be due to competition with the endogenous Ets2 protein. Both ING1 fusion proteins and Ets2 DBD are similarly active in gel mobility shift assays with the oligonucleotide corresponding to the Ets2 DNA binding site (data not shown). The repressor effect is specific to Ets2 since none of the plasmids tested show any effect on the control reporter construct (6AP-luc) lacking Ets2-binding sequences (Fig. 4 D). We obtained similar results using another reporter system, in which the activity of SEAP was used as a reporter of transcription from a constitutively active SV40 promoter that was cloned next to five Gal4 binding sites. In this system, the chimeric GAL4-p33ING1b fusion protein also mediates transcriptional repression (Fig. 4 E, compare lane 3 and lane 1). The repression is specific to p33ING1b, because the GAL4-p24ING1c fusion protein has little effect on the SV40 promoter. Moreover, treatment of transfected cells with TSA, a specific inhibitor of histone deacetylases, restores the reporter activity, indicating that the transcriptional repression mediated by p33ING1b requires active HDAC. Western blot analysis confirmed that both GAL4-p33ING1b and GAL-p24ING1c fusion proteins were expressed in comparable amounts, regardless of the presence or absence of TSA (Fig.4 E). Therefore, tethering p33ING1b to an artificial promoter in vivo can confer HDAC-dependent transcriptional repression in reporter gene expression systems. Our finding of differential association of the products of the alternative transcripts of p33ING1b and p24ING1c with the mSin3 transcriptional corepressor complex provides a basis for a molecular mechanism of ING1 function as a growth regulator and a candidate tumor suppressor. It also introduces novel aspects into the understanding of the Sin3/HDAC1-mediated transcriptional repression, by identifying new components that might serve as a link to regulation of growth and cell division. Our data suggest that p33ING1b is the predominant isoform among ING1 proteins that is associated with the Sin3/HDAC1-mediated transcriptional repression. This is based on the observation that the N-terminal 99 amino acids, which are unique to p33ING1b, are required for: 1) the assembly with Sin3/HDAC1 complexes, and 2) the HDAC1-dependent transcriptional corepressor activity in reporter gene assays. p24ING1c, which is otherwise identical to p33ING1b except for missing the N-terminal domain, does not seem to interact with the Sin3/HDAC1 complexes even when overproduced. The p47ING1a isoform has a unique N-terminal fragment that is distinct from that of p33ING1b. Although in this study we did not rigorously examine the assembly of p47ING1a, the putative endogenous p47ING1a protein that we can detect with the affinity purified polyclonal anti-ING1 antibodies does not coelute with the Sin3/HDAC1 complexes in gel filtration experiments. Moreover, p47ING1a cannot be immunoprecipitated by Sin3 and HDAC1 (data not shown). This suggests that p47ING1a may associate with different protein partners, but the nature and roles of the p47ING1a assembly remain to be determined. The cooperation of ING1 with p53 was the first mechanism that was proposed to account for the growth suppressor function of ING1 (14Garkavtsev I. Grigorian I.A. Ossovskaya V.S. Chernov M.V. Chumakov P.M. Gudkov A.V. Nature. 1998; 391: 295-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Recent analysis of the ING1 isoforms in mouse suggests that the equivalent of the human p24ING1c homologue is required for the activation of p53-dependent promoters. In contrast, the mouse equivalent of the human p33ING1b isoform interferes with the activation of the p53-dependent responses (15Zeremski M. Hill J.E. Kwek S.S. Grigorian I.A. Gurova K.V. Garkavtsev I.V. Diatchenko L. Koonin E.V. Gudkov A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32172-32181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This result is consistent with our finding that p33ING1b functions in transcriptional repression, not activation. Moreover, Sin3-mediated HDAC1 activity was recently indicated in the repression of p53-responsive genes (15Zeremski M. Hill J.E. Kwek S.S. Grigorian I.A. Gurova K.V. Garkavtsev I.V. Diatchenko L. Koonin E.V. Gudkov A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32172-32181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). It will be important to test whether p33ING1b plays a role in the negative regulation of the p53-responsive genes in cooperation with Sin3/HDAC1. A model for the function of the ING1 locus can be envisaged from our data and previous studies that the interplay of the ING1 isoforms in collaboration with p53 sets the transcriptional program that determines cell proliferation or arrest. We propose that p33ING1b together with the mSin3 corepressor machinery represses p53-responsive genes that halt cell cycle progression and that p24ING1c serves as an antagonist to relieve this repression. The relative ratio of p33ING1b and p24ING1c thus may determine the proliferate potential of the cell. Work from a number of laboratories demonstrated that Sin3 serves as scaffold protein for the assembly of multiprotein complexes, which target histone deacetylase activities to selected genes by interacting with specific transcription factors. These complexes facilitate transcriptional repression through a mechanism of induction of local rearrangements of the chromatin structure (3Knoepfler P.S. Eisenman R.N. Cell. 1999; 99: 447-450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). In contrast to Sin3 and HDAC1, which are relatively stable proteins and do not seem to be cell cycle-regulated, ING1 is cell cycle-regulated. p24ING1c accumulates in cells that are quiescence or senescence and overexpression of p24ING1c in primary fibroblasts arrests cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle (28Garkavtsev I. Riabowol K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2014-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). p33ING1b also accumulates in quiescence, but induction of cell division by addition of mitogens leads to rapid decline of the p33ING1b protein. 2K. V. Gurova and A. V. Gudkov, unpublished data. In light of our data presented in this paper, these observations suggest that p33ING1b may serve as a regulatory subunit of the mSin3 complex and together with mSin3 might be involved in repression of some essential cell cycle regulatory genes. The identities of those genes are not known, but our identification of RBP1 as a presumptive subunit of the p33ING1b/Sin3 complex suggests that among possible candidates are genes that are regulated by the Rb/E2F pathway through an interaction of RBP1 with Rb. This intriguing possibility agrees with the observation that HDAC1 interacts with the Rb protein and that the HDAC1 activity is required for full transcriptional repression of some of the Rb-regulated genes (29Luo R.X. Postigo A.A. Dean D.C. Cell. 1998; 92: 463-473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar,30Magnaghi-Jaulin L. Groisman R. Naguibneva I. Robin P. Lorain S. Le Villain J.P.

We recently found that JAM interacts with ZO-1 and cingulin and that such associations may favor the junctional recruitment of occludin (4Bazzoni G. Martinez-Estrada O.M. Orsenigo F. Cordenonsi M.

While searching for potential molecular partners of JAM, we noticed that a sequence at the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of JAM fits a consensus motif for binding type II PSD95/dlg/ZO-1 (PDZ) domains (6Songyang Z.

PDZ domains are protein-binding modules involved in the assembly of transmembrane molecules and signaling complexes at specialized domains of the plasma membrane (7Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Membrane-associated guanylate kinases, a subfamily of modular PDZ domain-containing proteins, are found at intercellular junctions, neuronal synapses, and polarized membrane domains (8Stevenson B.R. Keon B.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 89-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Based on a peptide library study that defined the binding specificity of several PDZ domains (6Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that calcium/calmodulin-dependent serine protein kinase (CASK) might be a ligand for the carboxyl terminus of JAM. The membrane-associated guanylate kinase protein CASK is composed of a Ca2+-calmodulin kinase, a PDZ, an SH3, and a guanylate kinase domain. Although predominantly expressed at the neuronal presynaptic membrane (where it binds neurexins), CASK is also expressed in epithelial cells (9Hata Y. Butz S. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In nematodes, the CASK homolog LIN-2 is an essential component of a multiprotein complex that targets the Let-23 receptor tyrosine kinase to the basolateral membrane of vulval precursors (10Kaech S.M.

Mouse anti-human JAM mAb BV16, rat anti-murine JAM mAb BV12, and rabbit anti-JAM serum were produced as described previously (1Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M.

Human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells were cultured in DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum and split 1:3 every week.

Production of mJAM and mJAM ΔFLV has been described previously (4Bazzoni G. Martinez-Estrada O.M. Orsenigo F. Cordenonsi M. Citi S. Dejana E. J. Biol.

Confluent Caco-2 cells were lysed with lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, and protease inhibitors (pH 7.5)). Lysates were precleared with protein A-Sepharose and immunoprecipitated with antibodies coupled to protein A-Sepharose. Immunocomplexes were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and finally analyzed by Western blot, as described previously (4Bazzoni G. Martinez-Estrada O.M. Orsenigo F. Cordenonsi M.

To study protein partitioning in the Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions, in some experiments lysates were centrifuged (14,000 × g for 10 min) to separate the supernatant (soluble fraction) from the pellet. The pellet was incubated with 0.02% SDS in lysis buffer, resuspended by gentle pipetting, and centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected (insoluble fraction). In control experiments, Western blot analysis of the remaining pellet (i.e. material insoluble in 0.02% SDS) did not reveal the presence of JAM, whereas a minor fraction of CASK (between 5% and 10% of total CASK) was still detectable in the pellet, both in cells with mature junctions and during junction assembly. To produce the soluble PDZ domain of CASK, Caco-2 cell RNA was reverse-transcribed according to standard procedures. Human cDNA encoding the CASK PDZ domain was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the sense oligonucleotide 5′-GCGGATCCAGAGTTCGGCTGGTACAGTTTC-3′ (which introduces theunderlined BamHI site upstream of nucleotide 1459) as forward primer and antisense oligonucleotide 5′-GGAAGCTTTCAGCGGTAACTTGGCACAA TCTTG-3′ (which introduces a stop codon and the underlined HindIII site downstream of nucleotide 1716) as reverse primer. TheBamHI-HindIII fragment was inserted in the pQE30 vector (Qiagen), which adds an amino-terminal hexahistidine sequence, and used to transform competent M15 Escherichia coli. The protein (6HisCASK-PDZ) was purified on a Ni2+-nitriloacetic acid resin. For the binding assay, 6HisCASK-PDZ was immobilized on Ni2+-NTA-Sepharose beads. After blocking with 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Tween 20, beads (20 μl) were diluted in binding buffer and incubated with either GST-JAM or GST as fluid-phase ligands (60 min at 4 °C, with rotation). Beads were washed five times, resuspended with 20 μl of sample buffer, and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were analyzed by Western blot using an anti-GST antibody (Biotech). Cells were grown on glass coverslips and fixed with methanol. Mowiol 488-mounted coverslips were analyzed by confocal microscopy (with Kalman filtering), using an MRC 1024 Bio-Rad microscope equipped with a krypton/argon laser (13Perego C. Bulbarelli A. Longhi R. Caimi M. Villa A. Caplan M.J. Pietrini G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6584-6592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). To study the association of JAM with CASK, JAM was first immunoprecipitated from Caco-2 lysates using the anti-JAM mAb BV16. Immunoprecipitates were then resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by Western blot with the anti-CASK mAb C63120. mAb BV16 coprecipitated a protein with an apparent relative mass of ∼110 kDa that was recognized in Western blot by the anti-CASK antibody (Fig.1 A, lane 1). The coprecipitated protein displayed the same electrophoretic mobility of authentic CASK when the latter was analyzed in parallel by Western blot in lysates from either Caco-2 cells (lane 2) or rat brain (lane 3). To define the molecular determinants of the JAM-CASK association, the cytoplasmic domain of JAM (from Gly256 to the carboxyl-terminal residue Val300) was expressed as a fusion protein with GST (GST-JAM) and immobilized onto glutathione-Sepharose beads. GST-JAM (but not GST) bound CASK in Caco-2 lysates as assessed by Western blot analysis with the anti-CASK antibody, indicating that the association of JAM with CASK is mediated the cytoplasmic tail of JAM (Fig. 1 B). As mentioned above, the cytoplasmic domain of JAM contains a putative PDZ-binding motif. To test its involvement in the association with CASK, we produced a deletion mutant of murine JAM lacking the carboxyl-terminal residues Phe298-Leu299-Val300 (mJAM ΔFLV). Caco-2 cells were then transfected with either mJAM ΔFLV or full-length murine JAM (mJAM). As evaluated by fluorescence-activated cell-sorting analysis, mJAM and mJAM ΔFLV were expressed at comparable levels at the cell surface (26.4% and 26.9% positive cells, respectively). Endogenous human JAM and transfected murine JAM (both mJAM and mJAM ΔFLV) were first immunoprecipitated using anti-human BV16 and anti-murine BV12 mAbs, respectively. Then, the association with CASK was tested by Western blot using the anti-CASK mAb C63120 (Fig. 1 C). As expected, mAb BV16 coprecipitated CASK together with endogenous human JAM in both mJAM (lane 2) and mJAM ΔFLV transfectants (lane 4). At variance, mAb BV12 only coprecipitated CASK in mJAM (lane 1) and not in mJAM ΔFLV transfectants (lane 3). Preliminary experiments had shown that the FLV deletion does not impair the ability of mAb BV12 to immunoprecipitate mJAM ΔFLV (4Bazzoni G. Martinez-Estrada O.M. Orsenigo F. Cordenonsi M. Citi S. Dejana E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 20520-20526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). We then evaluated whether the association of JAM with CASK is mediated by the PDZ domain of CASK. To this end, the PDZ domain (from Arg487 to Arg572) was produced as a polyhistidine-tagged soluble protein (6HisCASK-PDZ), immobilized onto Ni2+-NTA-Sepharose beads, and used in a binding assay as solid-phase ligand. Either GST-JAM or GST alone was used as fluid-phase ligand. Bound GST proteins were then eluted and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot using an anti-GST antibody. As shown in Fig. 1 D, GST-JAM was specifically bound by immobilized 6HisCASK-PDZ (lane 4), whereas no binding of either GST to 6HisCASK-PDZ-coated beads (lane 2) or GST-JAM to beads alone (lane 3) was detectable. The distribution of JAM and CASK in Caco-2 cells was analyzed by confocal laser microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2, both CASK (Fig.2 A) and JAM (Fig. 2 B) distributed and colocalized (Fig. 2 C) at intercellular contacts. In vertical sections, CASK and JAM colocalized at the lateral region of the plasma membrane with minimal overlap at the apical-most portion of the latter (Fig. 2,a–c). Localization of either molecule at the apical surface was never observed. To define JAM distribution in greater detail, JAM was costained with either the basolateral marker Na+,K+-ATPase or the tight junction component cingulin. ATPase (Fig. 2, D and d) and JAM (Fig.2, E and e) codistributed at intercellular contacts (Fig. 2 F) and colocalized along the lateral surface (Fig. 2 f), confirming the localization of JAM at the lateral domain of the plasma membrane. At variance, a subpopulation of intercellular JAM (Fig. 2 G) localized to the apical-most region of the lateral membrane (Fig. 2 g) and colocalized (Fig. 2, I and i) with cingulin, which exclusively decorated tight junctions (Fig. 2, H andh). Because several cytoplasmic PDZ-proteins determine the subcellular localization of transmembrane partners (7Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), we tested whether association with CASK was required for recruitment of JAM to intercellular contacts. To this end, confluent monolayers of Caco-2 cells were incubated in the low calcium medium minimum essential medium for suspension cultures (S-MEM) to disrupt junctions and then switched back to DMEM, which contains physiological calcium concentrations, to induce junction reassembly. Junctional staining of both JAM and CASK was evaluated at different time points after calcium addition. We found that JAM was recruited to the junctions as early as 10 min after calcium addition, whereas CASK recruitment was only observed at 6 h (Fig.3 A). In additional experiments, junctional staining of CASK was not yet detectable at 2 h after calcium addition (data not shown), indicating that junctional recruitment of CASK occurs between 2 and 6 h under these experimental conditions. At variance with CASK, junctional staining of cingulin, ZO-1, and AF-6 was already detectable at 30 min after calcium addition (Fig. 3 B). Temporal dissociation in the junctional recruitment of JAM and CASK suggests that JAM localizes to intercellular junctions independently of its association with CASK. The suggestion is further supported by the observation that the deletion mutant mJAM ΔFLV did localize to intercellular junctions in transfected Caco-2 cells (data not shown). To test the hypothesis that the association of JAM with CASK may be modulated by the state of maturation of intercellular adhesive complexes, confluent Caco-2 monolayers were first incubated (for 18 h) in low calcium medium to disrupt junctions and then incubated for additional 2 h in medium containing physiological calcium concentrations and finally lysed with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Fig.4, JUNCTION ASSEMBLY). As a control, Caco-2 cells were maintained in the presence of physiological calcium levels throughout the assay (Fig. 4, MATURE JUNCTIONS). Upon lysis, both Triton-soluble and -insoluble fractions were analyzed for the presence of JAM and CASK, either alone (by Western blot with the respective antibodies) or in complex (by immunoprecipitation with anti-JAM and Western blot with anti-CASK antibodies). Compared with mature junctions, JAM distribution in the two fractions was unchanged during junction assembly, as assessed by Western blot analysis, with JAM being much more abundant in the soluble fraction. Notably, detection of biotin-labeled JAM suggests that JAM was expressed at the cell surface in both fractions (Fig.4 B). In contrast, partitioning of CASK between the two fractions was severely affected because much lower amounts of CASK were detected in the insoluble fraction during junction assembly as compared with mature junctions. Similarly, the amount of CASK coprecipitated with JAM in the insoluble fraction was reduced during the assembly, as evaluated by immunoprecipitation and Western blot (Fig. 4 B; see also Fig. 4 C for a quantitative analysis). The major findings of this study are: (i) JAM association with CASK requires the PDZ domain of CASK and the putative PDZ-binding motif F-L-V of JAM, (ii) the two proteins colocalize at the lateral surface in epithelial cells, (iii) association with CASK is not required for recruitment of JAM to the junctions, and (iv) junction assembly is accompanied by decreased amounts of JAM-CASK complexes in the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of cell lysates. These data suggest that binding of JAM with CASK is dynamically regulated during junction assembly. The molecular association was determined by independent and complementary assays. First, CASK was coimmunoprecipitated with JAM. Second, CASK coeluted with the GST-JAM fusion protein. Third, the 6HisCASK-PDZ protein interacted with GST-JAM in a direct binding assay. Hence, the association requires the cytoplasmic tail of JAM (in particular, the carboxyl-terminal residues Phe-Leu-ValCOOH, as demonstrated by the inability of mJAM ΔFLV to coprecipitate CASK) and the PDZ domain of CASK. Crystal structure (14Daniels D.L. Cohen A.R. Anderson J.M. Brunger A.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar) and peptide binding studies (6Songyang Z.

Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1219) Google Scholar) have established that CASK is a type II PDZ protein. Members of this class of PDZ domains bind transmembrane proteins bearing the carboxyl-terminal consensus sequence Phe/Tyr-X-Φ (X, any residue; Φ, hydrophobic). The preferred binding motif of CASK was predicted to be Phe-Phe-Val(Phe/Ala), and ligands known to interact with its PDZ domain, i.e. syndecan-2 (11Cohen A.R. Wood D.F. Marfatia S.M. Walther Z. Chishti A.H. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and neurexin (9Hata Y. Butz S. Südhof T.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 2488-2494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), terminate in Phe-Tyr-Ala and Tyr-Tyr-Val, respectively. The data reported here confirm the prediction that JAM is a ligand for the PDZ domain of CASK and that binding requires the Phe-Leu-ValCOOH residues, which are conserved in all the sequences determined thus far, such as human, bovine (15Ozaki H. Ishii K. Horiuchi H. Arai H. Kawamoto T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kita T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 553-557PubMed Google Scholar), murine, and rat JAM (1Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar), and which mediate JAM binding to the PDZ proteins ZO-1 (4Bazzoni G. Martinez-Estrada O.M. Orsenigo F. Cordenonsi M. Citi S.

Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27979-27988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Molecular interaction of JAM and CASK is mirrored by their colocalization at the lateral surface of the plasma membrane. Whereas the lateral distribution of CASK (11Cohen A.R. Wood D.F. Marfatia S.M. Walther Z. Chishti A.H. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and human JAM (16Liu Y. Nusrat A. Schnell F.J. Reaves T.A. Walsh S. Pochet M. Parkos C.A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2363-2374Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has been reported previously, murine JAM was shown to codistribute with tight junction-specific molecules in cell lines and to concentrate to the tight junction-containing segment of the intercellular cleft in tissue sections (1Martin-Padura I. Lostaglio S. Schneemann M. Williams L. Romano M. Fruscella P. Panzeri C. Stoppacciaro A. Ruco L. Villa A. Simmons D. Dejana E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). Conceivably, differences in animal species, antibodies, cell type, and maturation state of cell junctions are likely determinants of such discrepancy. Data reported here indicate the existence of two distinct subpopulations of JAM in Caco-2 cells. The former decorates the lateral cell surface and colocalizes with the basolateral membrane marker Na+,K+-ATPase. The latter concentrates more apically and codistributes with the tight junction marker cingulin. Interestingly, the transmembrane protein occludin is also distributed both at basolateral membrane and at tight junctions, perhaps reflecting differences in the maturation of intercellular contacts (17Sakakibara A. Furuse M. Saitou M. Ando-Akatsuka Y. Tsukita S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1393-1401Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). In our experimental system, CASK colocalized with both lateral JAM and (albeit to a much lesser extent) junctional JAM. Whereas a putative localization of CASK at epithelial tight junctions requires further analysis, it is noteworthy that CASK is a molecular component of the neuronal presynaptic plaque, another junctional specialization of the plasma membrane (18Hsueh Y.-P. Yang F.-C. Kharazia V. Naisbitt S. Cohen A.R. Weinberg R.J. Sheng M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 139-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Several PDZ proteins are instrumental in recruiting transmembrane ligands to specific domains of the plasma membrane (7Fanning A.S. Anderson J.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 432-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Among the immunoglobulin-like cell adhesion molecules known to interact with PDZ proteins, fasciclin II and nectin are recruited to neuromuscular and adherens junctions by the PDZ molecules discs-large and afadin, respectively (19Zito K. Fetter R.D. Goodman C.S. Isacoff E.Y. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1007-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 20Takahashi K. Nakanishi H. Miyahara M. Mandai K. Satoh K. Satoh A. Nishioka H. Aoki J. Nomoto A. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 539-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). However, a role for CASK in recruiting JAM is questioned by the observations that JAM localizes to the junctions earlier than CASK and that deletion of the CASK-interacting sequence Phe-Leu-ValCOOH does not abolish JAM recruitment to the junctions. CASK-independent targeting of JAM to intercellular junctions might be attributable to other intercellular molecules (such as ZO-1, cingulin, and AF-6) that, in contrast to CASK, localized to the junctions at early time points of junction assembly. A calcium switch protocol that induces disassembly and subsequent reassembly of cadherin-based intercellular junctions (21Rajasekaran A.K. Hojo M. Huima T. Rodriguez-Boulan E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 22Anderson J.M. Van Itallie C.M. Peterson M.D. Stevenson B.R. Carew E.A. Mooseker M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1047-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) was used to evaluate whether junction assembly modulates the interaction of JAM with CASK. Junction assembly strikingly influenced partitioning of CASK (either alone or in association with JAM) between soluble and insoluble fractions of Triton X-100 lysates, with enrichment of CASK in the soluble fraction and reduction of JAM-CASK complexes in the insoluble fraction. Because CASK interacts with protein 4.1 (11Cohen A.R. Wood D.F. Marfatia S.M. Walther Z. Chishti A.H. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), it is conceivable that the enhanced solubility reflects a transient loss of CASK interactions with the cortical F-actin cytoskeleton, even if the molecular interaction(s) primarily responsible for the observed effect remains unknown. Regardless of the precise molecular mechanism, we propose a dynamic model for the regulation of the JAM-CASK interaction during junction assembly (Fig. 5). In mature junctions, CASK is found in association with JAM and can be coprecipitated in both Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions of cell lysates. Triton-insoluble JAM-CASK complexes are likely to be associated with the actin cytoskeleton, possibly via protein 4.1 (11Cohen A.R. Wood D.F. Marfatia S.M. Walther Z. Chishti A.H. Anderson J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 129-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). At variance, upon junction assembly, CASK is released from its cytoskeletal associations, and JAM-CASK complexes are almost exclusively detectable in the Triton-soluble fraction outside of the junctions, whereas another subpopulation of JAM likely associates at the junctions with other proteins, such as AF-6 (5Ebnet K. Schulz C.U. Meyer-zu-Brickwedde M.K. Pendl G.G. Vestweber D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27979-27988Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar), ZO-1, and cingulin (4Bazzoni G.

We speculate that the interaction with JAM might be instrumental in preventing CASK from being prematurely assembled into nascent junctional complexes."

The Fc domain induced the dimerization and oligomerization of the chimeric protein leading to receptor phosphorylation and activation, thus mimicking the effect of ligand binding, whereas the wild type ALK remained as a monomeric nonphosphorylated protein. Expression of the chimera, but not that of the wild type ALK or of a kinase inactive form of the chimera, induced the differentiation of PC12 cells.

Following ligand binding, the RTK dimerizes and autophosphorylates (1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4594) Google Scholar). The activated RTK initiates signal transduction cascades through binding of SH2 domain-containing proteins to specific receptor phosphotyrosine residues (2Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2222) Google Scholar). RTKs can regulate a wide variety of cellular processes involved in cell division, differentiation, survival, and motility. A number of RTKs play essential roles during the development of the nervous system by contributing to neuronal differentiation, survival, and function (reviewed in Ref. 3Henderson C.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Most of these receptors have specific or shared ligands called neurotrophic factors that have been identified (reviewed in Ref. 3Henderson C.E. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1996; 6: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). However, for some of them, named orphan receptors, their ligands are still unknown (4Ben-Neriah Y. Bauskin A.R. Nature. 1988; 333: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 5Morris S.W. Naeve C. Mathew P. James P.L. Kirstein M.N. Cui X. Witte D.P.

Oncogene. 1997; 14: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a novel orphan neuronal receptor, was originally identified as a member of the insulin receptor subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases that acquires transforming capability when truncated and fused in the t(2;5) chromosomal rearrangement associated with the non-Hodgkin lymphoma (7Morris S.W. Kirstein M.N. Valentine M.B. Dittmer K.G. Shapiro D.N. Saltman D.L. Look A.T. Science. 1994; 263: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar). This translocation produces a fusion gene that encodes a soluble chimeric transforming protein comprised of the N-terminal portion of the phosphoprotein nucleophosmin (NPM), a highly conserved RNA-binding nucleolar protein, linked to the cytoplasmic portion of ALK (7Morris S.W. Kirstein M.N. Valentine M.B. Dittmer K.G. Shapiro D.N. Saltman D.L. Look A.T. Science. 1994; 263: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1943) Google Scholar). The NPM-ALK fusion protein was localized within both the cytoplasm and the nucleoplasm and also within the nucleoli of t(2;5)-translocation-positive lymphoma cells (8Bischof D. Pulford K. Mason D.Y. Morris S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2312-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). However, whereas the NPM sequence is essential for the transforming activity (9Fujimoto J. Shiota M.

Cell. 1989; 56: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the NPM portion was responsible for the dimerization of the fusion protein leading to the constitutive activation of the kinase and to the transforming activity (8Bischof D. Pulford K. Mason D.Y. Morris S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2312-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Human and mouse cDNAs encoding full-length ALK have been characterized (5Morris S.W. Naeve C. Mathew P. James P.L. Kirstein M.N. Cui X. Witte D.P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2175-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 6Iwahara T. Fujimoto J. Wen D. Cupples R. Bucay N. Arakawa T. Mori S. Ratzkin B. Yamamoto T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). The deduced amino acid sequences revealed that ALK is a novel RTK having an extracellular domain, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular domain containing the tyrosine kinase activity. The open reading frame encodes a 1620-amino acid protein that is most closely related to leukocyte tyrosine kinase (4Ben-Neriah Y. Bauskin A.R. Nature. 1988; 333: 672-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 12Bernards A. de la Monte S.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2279-2287Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Surface labeling studies indicated that the mature form of the receptor is a 200-kDa glycoprotein exposed at the cell membrane (5Morris S.W. Naeve C. Mathew P. James P.L. Kirstein M.N. Cui X. Witte D.P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2175-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar), consistent with the prediction that ALK serves as the receptor for yet unidentified ligand(s). In situ hybridization analysis showed that ALK RNA is essentially and transiently expressed in specific regions of the central and peripheral nervous systems such as the thalamus, mid-brain, olfactory bulb, and peripheral ganglia and that it localizes mostly in neuronal cells (5Morris S.W. Naeve C. Mathew P. James P.L. Kirstein M.N. Cui X. Witte D.P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2175-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). The neonatal brain showed the highest expression, suggesting a possible involvement of ALK in development of the nervous system when axon sprouting and retraction are occurring. Because ALK expression is maintained, albeit at a lower level, in the adult brain, it may also play a role in synapse formation and maintenance (5Morris S.W. Naeve C. Mathew P. James P.L. Kirstein M.N. Cui X. Witte D.P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2175-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Thus, ALK is a novel orphan receptor tyrosine kinase that might play an important role in the normal development and function of the nervous system. The ligand of ALK is unknown. Therefore, to investigate whether ALK can play a role in neuronal differentiation, we generated a constitutively active transmembrane form of ALK by substituting the extracellular domain of the receptor by the Fc fragment of mouse IgG 2b. We show here that the ALK.Fc protein expressed in PC12 cells dimerized, oligomerized, and was tyrosine-phosphorylated. Furthermore, we show that transient expression of ALK.Fc induced neuronal differentiation through the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway.

The cDNA, cut with XhoI-NotI and blunt-ended, was inserted at the EcoRV site of the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands) generating the pcDNA-ALK.wt construct. The cDNA, 6226 bp, covered the entire coding sequence of the protein. The ATG start codon is located at nucleotide position 912, the sequence coding for the transmembrane domain is located between nucleotides 4020 and 4083, and the stop codon is at position 5774. There is a HincII site at position 1079 and a PshAI site at position 3892. These sites were used to delete a major part of the ALK extracellular domain to generate the pcDNA-ALK.Fc construct (see below). The 864-bp PstI-EcoRV fragment of the mouse IgG 2b cDNA corresponding to the Fc fragment (GenBank™ accession number MMIGG7) in pBluescript was a gift from Dr. N. Doyen (Institut Pasteur, Paris). To construct the cDNA coding for the chimeric protein (pcDNA-ALK.Fc) containing extracellularly the mouse IgG 2b Fc domain linked to the membrane-spanning segment and the whole cytoplasmic domain of ALK, a polymerase chain reaction product corresponding to the entire sequence of the Fc fragment, flanked at the 5′-region with a HincII site and at the 3′-region with aPshAI site was produced and inserted at the same sites in the pcDNA-ALK.wt with its HincII-PshAI segment deleted. We prepared a kinase-defective form of the chimera (designated ALK*.Fc, and the corresponding construct was pcDNA-ALK*.Fc) in which the invariant lysine residue located in the ATP-binding portion of the catalytic domain was changed to arginine. This lysine residue, originally identified as residue 210 of the NPM-ALK fusion protein (7Morris S.W. Kirstein M.N. Valentine M.B. Dittmer K.G. Shapiro D.N. Saltman D.L. Look A.T.

The mutation was generated with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene Europe, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) using the sense oligonucleotide primer CTGCAAGTGGCTGTGAGGACGCTGCCTGAAGTG (in which theunderlined G replaced an A in the non-mutated sequence), together with the corresponding antisense oligonucleotide primer and the pcDNA-ALK.Fc construct as the template. This single base mutagenesis was verified by sequencing (Genset, Paris, France). The PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cell line (13Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4839) Google Scholar), purchased from ATCC, was grown, unless otherwise specified, in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. PC12 cells were electroporated using the EasyJect Plus apparatus (Equibio, United Kingdom) as recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, 5 × 106 cells in 0.8 ml of OptiMEM (Life Technologies) were mixed with 30 μg of DNA and then pulsed (260 V, 950 microfarads). Cells were immediately transferred to fresh culture media and cultivated on gelatin-coated dishes. In experiments involving pharmacological inhibitors and β-mercaptoethanol, these supplements were added daily along with fresh culture media. For experiments with growth factors, PC12 cells were grown for 48 h in the presence of either 25 ng/ml NGF or 50 ng of bFGF. Cultures were photographed and neurite-bearing cells counted using an inverted microscope after an incubation period of 48 or 72 h, respectively. Following electroporation, cells were grown for 48 h in medium with 10% horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum, then for 24 h in medium with only 0.5% horse serum. Cell extracts were prepared by lysing the cells in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mmsodium orthovanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and protease inhibitor mixture). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation and subjected to either immunoprecipitation or immunoblotting. For immunoprecipitation, 0.5 mg of total proteins was incubated at 4 °C in a rotating shaker with protein A-Sepharose beads on which a rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine antibody had been previously bound. After 4 h of incubation, the beads were washed with lysis buffer and the bound proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. For Western blotting, cell extracts (20 μg) or immunoprecipitated material were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking the membranes in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 0.1% Tween 20, 5% powdered milk, they were probed with the antibodies at appropriate dilutions for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then washed in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20 and incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) for 1 h. After washing in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, the proteins were visualized using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK). PC12 cells transiently transfected with the different constructs (pcDNA, pcDNA-ALK.wt, pcDNA-ALK.Fc, or pcDNA-ALK*.Fc) were grown on glass coverslips for 72 h, washed in PBS, fixed for 10 min at room temperature with 4% formaldehyde in PBS, and then washed 3 × 5 min with PBS, 50 mm NH4Cl. After 1 h of blocking in PBS, containing 3%BSA, cells were incubated in the same buffer with an FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1/500 dilution; Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA) to visualize ALK.Fc- or ALK*.Fc-expressing cells. After washing 5 × 5 min with PBS, cells were mounted in Citifluor (UKC Chemical Laboratory, Canterbury, UK) before viewing on a conventional fluorescence microscope (Provis, Olympus). To analyze and localize SCG10, a rabbit anti-SCG10 antibody was added to the cells after blocking with PBS, 3% bovine serum albumin, 0.05% saponin for 1 h at room temperature. After washing 3 × 5 min with PBS, 0.05% saponin, cells were incubated with an FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA) for 1 h, washed 5 × 5 min in PBS, mounted, and visualized as described above. Because the ALK ligand is unknown, we generated a constitutively active form of ALK to study the biological function(s) of this receptor. We thus chose a strategy in which the extracellular domain of ALK was substituted by the mouse IgG 2b Fc domain that we expected would dimerize the resulting chimeric protein through disulfide bond formation between cysteine residues of the Fc domain. Fig. 1 shows the structures of the pcDNA-ALK.wt, pcDNA-ALK.Fc, and pcDNA-ALK*.Fc constructs. The pcDNA-ALK.wt construct encodes the membrane-bound wild type receptor (see introduction and below). The pcDNA-ALK.Fc construct codes for a transmembrane protein that contains the 30 N-terminal amino acids of ALK, the Fc fragment and a juxtamembrane portion of the extracellular domain (42 amino acids), the transmembrane, and the entire intracellular domains of ALK. The pcDNA-ALK*.Fc construct codes for a kinase-defective form of the chimera in which the invariant lysine residue located in the ATP-binding portion of the catalytic domain was changed to arginine (see “Materials and Methods”). This point mutation has been previously shown to completely inhibit the transforming capability of NPM-ALK (8Bischof D. Pulford K. Mason D.Y. Morris S.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2312-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). The pcDNA-ALK.wt and the pcDNA-ALK.Fc constructs were transiently expressed in PC12 cells, and the proteins they encoded were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with anti-ALK antibody or anti-mouse IgG (Fig. 2). Under both reducing and nonreducing conditions, the ALK.wt receptor migrated as a single 200-kDa band, in agreement with previous reports (5Morris S.W. Naeve C. Mathew P. James P.L. Kirstein M.N. Cui X. Witte D.P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2175-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). In contrast, the ALK.Fc protein migrated as a single band of 120 kDa under reducing conditions and mainly as a doublet of about 240 and 360 kDa under nonreducing conditions. The 120-kDa band is consistent with that of the predicted 965-amino acid protein encoded by the pcDNA-ALK.Fc construct, whereas the 240- and 360-kDa proteins detected in nonreducing conditions correspond probably to dimers and oligomers (at least trimers), respectively. It is important to note that the anti-ALK antibody detected both the ALK.wt and the ALK.Fc proteins, whereas the anti-mouse IgG revealed only the ALK.Fc protein. These results indicate that the ALK receptor existed as a monomer and that the Fc fragment allowed the ALK.Fc chimera to dimerize and oligomerize through disulfide bond formation. PC12 cells transiently expressing the pcDNA-ALK.Fc construct exhibited neurite extensions, whereas cells expressing the pcDNA-ALK.wt construct, or those that were transfected with the pcDNA-ALK*.Fc vector or the empty pcDNA3 vector, did not (Fig.3 A). The neurites were visible as soon as 24 h post-electroporation and reached the size of severalfold the cell body size at 48 h post-electroporation. To visualize cells overexpressing the ALK.Fc protein, immunofluorescence staining was performed with an FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. As shown in Fig. 3 B, only neurite-bearing cells stained with the antibody and were therefore expressing ALK.Fc. Immunostaining for the neuronal marker SCG10 (Fig. 3 C) revealed an increased expression and a perinuclear localization of the protein (probably in the Golgi network) of the neurite-bearing cells as previously demonstrated for PC12 cells induced to differentiate with NGF (14Stein R. Orit S. Anderson D.J. Dev. Biol. 1988; 127: 316-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 15DiPaolo G. Lutjens R. Pellier V. Stimpson S.A. Beuchat M.H. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5175-5182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In contrast, cells expressing the ALK*.Fc kinase-inactive form of the chimera ALK.Fc failed to extend neurites, although they clearly expressed the corresponding protein, as demonstrated by immunostaining with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Fig. 3 B). One can note that the staining appeared concentrated at the periphery of the transfected cells, suggesting a plasma membrane localization of the protein. No specific immunoreactivity was detected in cells electroporated with both the pcDNA vector or the pcDNA-ALK.wt construct (not shown). When cells transiently transfected with the pcDNA-ALK.Fc construct were maintained in the presence of 500 μm of the reducing agent β-mercaptoethanol, the neurite extension process was almost completely blocked (Fig. 4, Aand B). This indicated that the neurite outgrowth process was due to ALK.Fc receptor dimerization and oligomerization through disulfide bond formation, because neurite extension stimulated by either bFGF or NGF was not affected by the presence of β-mercaptoethanol in the culture medium. These results demonstrate that overexpression of ALK.Fc induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. We were unable to isolate stable transfectants from pcDNA-ALK.Fc-transfected cultures, probably because sustained activation of ALK leads essentially to neuronal differentiation and not to cell proliferation in PC12 cells. However, we easily isolated stable transfectants from pcDNA-ALK.wt cultures (not shown). These cells could be good tools for the isolation of the ALK ligand(s) and for further studies on the neurotrophic activity of ALK. To analyze the signal transduction cascade involved in the neuronal differentiation process induced by ALK.Fc, we used pharmacological inhibitors targeting the major signaling pathways coupled to RTKs. The MEK1 (a MAP kinase kinase) inhibitor PD98059, at a concentration of 10 μm, completely blocked the neurite outgrowth process induced by ALK.Fc (Fig. 5, A and B). In contrast, the Phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitor wortmannin and the phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) inhibitor ET-18-OCH3, used at their active concentrations, 20 nm for each inhibitor, had no apparent effect on this process (Fig. 5, Aand B). Thus, these data indicate that the PC12 neuronal differentiation induced by ALK.Fc involves mainly the MAP kinase pathway. To determine whether ALK.Fc was autophosphorylated and tyrosine phosphorylated downstream signaling molecules, cell extracts from PC12 cells transiently electroporated with the empty vector, the pcDNA-ALK.wt, or the pcDNA-ALK.Fc constructs were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine antibody, and the immunoprecipitated proteins were visualized by Western blotting with the same antibody. Although the ALK.Fc protein was highly tyrosine-phosphorylated, the ALK.wt protein showed no apparent phosphorylation (Fig.6 A), indicating that dimerization and/or oligomerization of the receptor via the Fc fragment induced its autophosphorylation on tyrosines. Several other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, most probably downstream signaling molecules, with molecular masses in the range 50–110 kDa coimmunoprecipitated with ALK.Fc (Fig. 6 A). To confirm the activation of the MAP kinase cascade by ALK.Fc, cell extracts from PC12 cells transiently electroporated by the empty vector, the pcDNA-ALK.wt, or the pcDNA-ALK.Fc DNAs were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-phospho-MAP kinase antibody (i.e. an antibody reacting with the active forms of MAP kinases). The results in Fig. 6 B show indeed that the amount of active forms of the MAP kinases (phospho-ERK1 and -ERK2) were higher in cell extracts from PC12/ALK.Fc cells than in extracts from PC12/ALK.wt and PC12/pcDNA cells. Thus activation of the ALK receptor induced by the Fc fragment led to the activation of the MAP kinase pathway. ALK is a novel orphan receptor tyrosine kinase that is essentially and transiently expressed in the nervous system (mostly in neuronal cells), suggesting an important role for this receptor during normal development and function of the nervous system. However, because the ligand of this receptor has not yet been identified, the normal biological functions of ALK 'are still unknown. In particular, it remains to be shown whether it could act as a functional membrane receptor and whether activation of its kinase activity could induce neuronal differentiation. To answer these questions, and to study the signal transduction pathways involved in the potential neurotrophic activity of ALK, we established a model system that allowed us to mimic the normal activation of this receptor. We generated an ALK.Fc chimera containing extracellularly the mouse IgG 2b Fc domain linked to the membrane-spanning segment and the whole cytoplasmic domain of ALK and expressed it into PC12 cells. PC12 cells are a widely used and well established in vitro model system for the study of neuronal differentiation, because they can differentiate to neuron-like cells upon exposure to neurotrophic factors (16Teng K.K. Greene L.A. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 2624-2635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ALK.Fc chimera expressed in PC12 cells had, under reducing conditions, an apparent molecular mass of about 120 kDa, which was in good agreement with that of the predicted 965-amino acid protein encoded by the pcDNA-ALK.Fc construct. In agreement with previous reports (5Morris S.W. Naeve C. Mathew P. James P.L. Kirstein M.N. Cui X. Witte D.P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2175-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar, 6Iwahara T. Fujimoto J. Wen D. Cupples R. Bucay N. Arakawa T. Mori S. Ratzkin B. Yamamoto T. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) the wild type ALK appeared as a 200-kDa protein. As expected, this strategy led to a forced dimerization and oligomerization of the chimera induced by inter-chain disulfide bridges of the Fc domains, whereas the ALK.wt did not dimerize or oligomerize. Western blot studies showed that ALK.Fc was hyperphosphorylated on tyrosines, whereas ALK.wt was not, indicating that the dimerized receptor was activated. To our knowledge, this is the first time that this strategy has been used to produce a constitutively activated form of a RTK. Thus it could be applied to other RTKs but also to other types of membrane-bound receptors that need to be dimerized and/or oligomerized as a first step of their activation. Transient expression of the pcDNA-ALK.Fc construct in PC12 cells, but not of the pcDNA-ALK.wt and pcDNA-ALK*.Fc constructs, induced neurite extensions in a large majority of ALK.Fc-expressing cells, indicating a direct relationship between expression of the chimeric receptor and the biological effect observed. The neurite extension process was visible as soon as 24 h post-electroporation, consistent with the time necessary for high expression of the oligomerized receptor. This process was specifically induced by dimerization and oligomerization of the chimeric receptor, because inhibition of disulfide bond formation strongly prevented neurite extensions induced by ALK.Fc but did not affect those induced by NGF or bFGF. In parallel to the morphological differentiation, overexpression of ALK.Fc induced expression and localization of the neuronal marker SCG10 in a pattern similar to that induced by NGF (14Stein R. Orit S. Anderson D.J. Dev. Biol. 1988; 127: 316-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar,15DiPaolo G. Lutjens R. Pellier V. Stimpson S.A. Beuchat M.H. Catsicas S. Grenningloh G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5175-5182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The fact that the expression of the ALK*.Fc kinase-inactive form of the chimera did not induce neurite outgrowth practically eliminates the possibility that the dimerized constitutively active form (ALK.Fc) simply serves as a docking site for some other kinase that could be responsible for the effect observed with ALK.Fc. The neuronal differentiation induced by the ALK.Fc expression is due to the intrinsic activation of the kinase activity of this chimera. Additional proof for the specificity of the neurite elongation process driven by ALK.Fc in PC12 cells was given by transient expression of the pcDNA-ALK.Fc construct in epithelial COS cells. COS cells electroporated with pcDNA-ALK.Fc expressed similar levels of phosphorylated dimerized and oligomerized ALK.Fc chimera than PC12 cells but did not exhibit any neurite-like extensions (data not shown). It has been reported that ectopic expression of the insulin (17Dikic I. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 702-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), epidermal growth factor (EGF) (18Traverse S. Seedorf K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cohen P. Ullrich A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), and platelet-derived growth factor (19Vetter M.L. Bishop J.M. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 168-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) receptors induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells only when they are activated by their cognate ligands. In agreement with these results, overexpression of the wild type ALK did not induce neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells, this receptor being monomeric and inactive in the absence of its ligand. In contrast, the ALK.Fc was permanently active. Altogether, these reports and our data stress the importance of the activation of the tyrosine kinase activity of the RTKs for the neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. The cytoplasmic molecules that mediate downstream signaling by ALK are presently unknown. However, analysis of the amino acid sequence of the intracellular portion of ALK revealed potential sites for binding of substrates such as Shc, PI3K, rasGAP, IRS1, Grb2, and PLCγ (5Morris S.W. Naeve C. Mathew P. James P.L. Kirstein M.N. Cui X. Witte D.P. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2175-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Coimmunoprecipitation studies with the NPM-ALK revealed a physical association of the fusion protein with IRS1, Grb2, Shc, and PLCγ (9Fujimoto J. Shiota M. Iwahara T. Seki N. Satoh H. Mori S. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4181-4186Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar,20Bai R.Y. Dieter P. Peschel C. Morris S.W. Duyster J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6951-6961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutants of NPM-ALK that were defective for binding to and phosphorylation of Shc or IRS-1 could transform NIH3T3 (9Fujimoto J. Shiota M. Iwahara T. Seki N. Satoh H. Mori S. Yamamoto T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4181-4186Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) cells, indicating that these signaling molecules are not essential for cell transformation. Finally, PLCγ appeared to be an important downstream target of NPM-ALK that contributes to its mitogenic activity and is likely to be important in the pathogenesis of large-cell anaplastic lymphomas, since knock-out of this single pathway was sufficient to significantly impair NPM-ALK-mediated oncogenicity in lymphocytes (20Bai R.Y. Dieter P. Peschel C. Morris S.W. Duyster J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6951-6961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Using pharmacological inhibitors of the classic pathways coupled to RTKs, we found that the ALK.Fc-induced neurite extension process requires the MAP kinase but not the PI3K and PLCγ activities. Studies at the molecular level confirmed the activation of the MAP kinase pathway, because the amount of active forms of EKR1 and ERK2 was found to be higher in PC12 cells expressing the pcDNA-ALK.Fc constructversus the pcDNA-ALK.wt construct. Thus, these results indicated for the first time that the MAP kinase pathway can be involved in ALK signaling and that it was necessary for the promotion of neurite extension induced by this receptor. In addition, these data call several remarks: First of all, sustained activation of the MAP kinase signaling cascade seems to be essential for the differentiation processes induced by various neurotrophic factors in PC12 cells (21Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4225) Google Scholar). For instance, stimulation of PC12 cells with NGF or bFGF led to sustained activation of MAP kinase and to neuronal differentiation (22Qui M.S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). In contrast, stimulation of the same cells with insulin or EGF triggered transient activation of MAP kinase and did not lead to neuronal differentiation but to cell proliferation (22Qui M.S. Green S.H. Neuron. 1992; 9: 705-717Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 23Dahmer M.K. Perlman R.L. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 2109-2113Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 24Mark M.D. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17238-17244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 25Hwang J.J. Kwon J.H. Hur K.C. Mol. Cells. 1997; 7: 438-443PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, when insulin or EGF receptors were overexpressed, sustained activation of MAP kinase and neuronal differentiation was obtained with the respective ligands (17Dikic I. Schlessinger J. Lax I. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 702-708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar,18Traverse S. Seedorf K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cohen P. Ullrich A. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 694-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar), indicating that the level of receptor expression is critical for the induction of a marked and sustained activation of MAP kinase and neuronal differentiation. In our experiments, the constitutive activation of ALK.Fc probably led to sustained activation of MAP kinase. The fact that we were able to detect MAP kinase activation as late as 72 h post-electroporation supports this assertion. Second, the PI3K pathway has been shown to be nonessential for neuronal differentiation (26Obermeier A. Bradshaw R.A. Seedorf K. Choidas A. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and has been proposed to be required for the prevention from apoptosis (27Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1290) Google Scholar) but not for neurite extension (28Powers J.F. Shahsavari M. Tsokas P. Tischler A.S. Cell Tissue Res. 1999; 295: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar,29Klesse L.J. Meyers K.A. Marshall C.J. Parada L.F. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2055-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) promoted by NGF. Thus, these results are consistent with our data showing that PI3K is not involved in the neurite extension induced by ALK.Fc. Third, mutations at either the PLCγ or Shc binding site on TrkA (the high affinity NGF receptor) showed no defects in NGF-induced neurite outgrowth and MAP kinase activation, but mutations at both sites did (30Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). These results indicate that both PLCγ and Shc trigger the MAP kinase cascade and that they can substitute for each other in NGF signaling. In agreement with our data, these results point to a pivotal role of the MAP kinase cascade in neuritogenesis and can explain why the sole inhibition of PLCγ activity with ET-18-OCH3 did not block the neurite extension process induced by ALK.Fc. Therefore, it seems that PLCγ activation is crucial for the mediation of the oncogenic potential of NPM-ALK (see above) (20Bai R.Y. Dieter P. Peschel C. Morris S.W. Duyster J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6951-6961Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but nonessential for the neuronal differentiating activity of ALK. In conclusion, our results showed that activation of the ALK receptor tyrosine kinase led to neuronal differentiation and this differentiating effect was mainly achieved through the MAP kinase signaling pathway. Thus, these results suggest that ALK could be involved in neuronal differentiation and present the first example for a biological role assigned to ALK. We thank Dr. N. Doyen (Institut Pasteur, Paris) for providing us with the mouse IgG2b cDNA. We are grateful to M. Lambert for helpful discussions and to Drs. A. Sobel and R. Rotundo for comments on the manuscript."

These results suggested that the activity of human EGF receptor family members regulates hnRNP K expression by extracellular growth promoting signals and that therapeutic humanized antibodies against EGFR and HER2 can effectively block this function. human epidermal growth factorreceptor heregulin-β1 epidermal growth factor EGF receptor anti-EGF receptor antibody monoclonal antibody anti-HER2 recombinant-derived humanized mAb. hnRNP K, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K gene discovery array K homology polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis transforming growth factor Growth factors and their receptors play an important role in regulating proliferation of epithelial cells. Abnormalities in the expression, structure, or activity of their proto-oncogene products contribute to the development and pathogenesis of cancer. For example, the human epidermal growth factorreceptor, HER1,1is overexpressed in a large number of epithelial tumor cells (1Ullrich A. Schlessinger J.

https://openalex.org/W2002835408,"Pro-phenoloxidase (proPO) in insects is implicated in the defense against microbes and wounding. The presence of proPO in the cuticle was suggested more than 30 years ago, but it has not been purified. The extract of cuticles of the silkworm,Bombyx mori, was shown to contain two proPO isoforms (F-type and S-type proPOs, which have slightly different mobilities in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions). The two isoforms were purified to homogeneity. From hemolymph of the same insect, two types of proPO with the same electrophoretic mobilities as those of cuticular isoforms were separated and were shown to be different at five amino acid residues in one of their subunits. The isoforms in the hemolymph and cuticle were activated by a specific activating enzyme. The resulting active phenoloxidases exhibited almost the same substrate specificities and specific activities towardo-diphenols. The substrate specificities and the susceptibilities to inhibitors, including carbon monoxide, indicated that the purified proPO isoforms were not zymogens of laccase-type phenoloxidase. The proPO in hemolymph was shown to be transported to the cuticle. This demonstration was corroborated by the failure to detect proPO transcripts by Northern analysis of total RNA from epidermal cells. In reversed-phase column chromatography, cuticular and hemolymph proPOs gave distinct elution profiles, indicating that some yet to be identified modification occurs in hemolymph proPO and results in the formation of cuticular proPO. There was little transportation of cuticular proPO to the cuticle when it was injected into the hemocoel. The nature of the modification is described in the accompanying paper (Asano, T., and Ashida, M. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 11113–11125). Pro-phenoloxidase (proPO) in insects is implicated in the defense against microbes and wounding. The presence of proPO in the cuticle was suggested more than 30 years ago, but it has not been purified. The extract of cuticles of the silkworm,Bombyx mori, was shown to contain two proPO isoforms (F-type and S-type proPOs, which have slightly different mobilities in polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under nondenaturing conditions). The two isoforms were purified to homogeneity. From hemolymph of the same insect, two types of proPO with the same electrophoretic mobilities as those of cuticular isoforms were separated and were shown to be different at five amino acid residues in one of their subunits. The isoforms in the hemolymph and cuticle were activated by a specific activating enzyme. The resulting active phenoloxidases exhibited almost the same substrate specificities and specific activities towardo-diphenols. The substrate specificities and the susceptibilities to inhibitors, including carbon monoxide, indicated that the purified proPO isoforms were not zymogens of laccase-type phenoloxidase. The proPO in hemolymph was shown to be transported to the cuticle. This demonstration was corroborated by the failure to detect proPO transcripts by Northern analysis of total RNA from epidermal cells. In reversed-phase column chromatography, cuticular and hemolymph proPOs gave distinct elution profiles, indicating that some yet to be identified modification occurs in hemolymph proPO and results in the formation of cuticular proPO. There was little transportation of cuticular proPO to the cuticle when it was injected into the hemocoel. The nature of the modification is described in the accompanying paper (Asano, T., and Ashida, M. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 11113–11125). pro-phenoloxidase phenoloxidase S-type cuticular proPO F-type cuticular proPO S-type hemolymph proPO F-type hemolymph proPO pro-phenoloxidase-activating enzyme polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography octadecyl acetonitrile lysylendopeptidase Coomassie Brilliant Blue R- 250 l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine dopamine N-acetyldopamine polymerase chain reaction kilobase pair(s) The outer surface of arthropods, including the insect, is covered by a protective armor, the cuticle. The cuticle is a nonliving matrix of carbohydrates and proteins secreted by the underlying monolayer of epithelial cells (1Wigglesworth V.B. The Principles of Insect Physiology. 7th Ed. Chapman and Hall, London1972Crossref Google Scholar). Because of its strategic localization between the environment and internal organs, the cuticle has been considered to be the first line of defense that is indispensable to safeguard the homeostasis against unfavorable environmental factors such as infectious microbes and drought. At the same time, it has often been evaluated only as a nonliving physical barrier. This view, however, is changing dramatically because of the recent demonstration of active participation of the cuticle in the defense reaction against microbial invasion and in the storage of proteins (2Csikós G. Molnár K. Borhegyi N. Talián G.Cs. Sass M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2113-2124PubMed Google Scholar, 3Brey P.T. Lee W.J. Yamakawa M. Koizumi Y. Perrot S. Francois M. Ashida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1993; 90: 6275-6279Google Scholar). The cuticle has been shown to have a certain mechanism to sense the presence of bacteria and fungi in an injured part and to relay signals to the underlying epithelial cells to direct the synthesis of a bacteriocidal peptide and its secretion to the cuticular matrix (3Brey P.T. Lee W.J. Yamakawa M. Koizumi Y. Perrot S. Francois M. Ashida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1993; 90: 6275-6279Google Scholar). However, it is still not clear what kind of mechanism is involved in the signaling in the cuticle. Interestingly, the existence of a pro-phenoloxidase (proPO)1cascade (proPO-activating system) in the cuticle of the silkworm,Bombyx mori, has been reported (4Ashida M. Brey P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10698-10702Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). In the 1980s, this cascade has been shown to be present also in the hemolymph of this insect and to be composed of recognition proteins with specific affinity to microbial cell wall components, serine protease zymogens and proPO (5Ashida M. Brey P.T. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects. Chapman & Hall, London1997: 135-172Google Scholar). The cascade is triggered by very minute amounts of cell wall components such as peptidoglycan, β-1,3-glucan and possibly lipopolysaccaride. It is considered to be one of the recognition systems for bacteria and fungi (5Ashida M. Brey P.T. Brey P.T. Hultmark D. Molecular Mechanisms of Immune Responses in Insects. Chapman & Hall, London1997: 135-172Google Scholar). Once the proPO cascade is triggered, one of the results is activation of proPO. Active phenoloxidase (PO) is a key enzyme for oxidation of phenolic substances such as tyrosine, DOPA, and dopamine to melanin (6Mason H.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1965; 34: 595-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). During the oxidation, quinones are formed in the melanized cell layers surrounding the encapsulated microbes, which are too big to be phagocytosed (7Götz P. Brehélin M. Immunity in Invertebrates. Springer-Verlag, New York1986: 153-170Crossref Google Scholar). These quinones are thought to be cytotoxic and facilitate the killing of encapsulated microbes. It is possible that the cascade in the cuticle also plays a similar role (4Ashida M. Brey P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10698-10702Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Epithelial cells underneath the cuticle secrete proteins. The secretion is directed apically to the cuticular matrix or basolaterally to the hemolymph or bidirectionally to the cuticle and hemolymph (8Sass M. Kiss A. Locke M. J. Insect Physiol. 1994; 40: 407-421Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition to this secretion, the epithelial cells have been shown to be capable of transcytosis of proteins, a process in which the epithelial cells take up proteins from the hemolymph and secrete them apically to the cuticle or vice versa. Thus, the cuticle has been shown to function as a reservoir of proteins (2Csikós G. Molnár K. Borhegyi N. Talián G.Cs. Sass M. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2113-2124PubMed Google Scholar). What are the underlying mechanisms by which these physiological functions of the cuticle and the epithelial cells are exhibited? How are the components playing roles in the cuticular functions organized in the cuticular matrix? Almost nothing is known at present about these mechanisms. Several years ago, one of the authors of this paper reported that immunogold staining of proPO displays an orderly arrayed pattern in the cuticular matrix of the silkworm, B. mori, and that proPO may be transported from the hemolymph to the cuticle through epithelial cell layer (4Ashida M. Brey P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10698-10702Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). To understand the function of the cuticular proPO, the properties of the proenzyme and the enzymatic properties of its active form must be determined. Furthermore, a clear demonstration of transport of hemolymph proPO to the cuticle and a comparison of the properties of cuticular and hemolymph proPOs should provide clues to understand the mechanism by which hemolymph proteins are transported to the cuticle. The principal aim of the present paper and the accompanying paper (9Asano T. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276 ()): 11113-11125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) is to get keys for solving the mechanism of transepithelial protein transport in insects by using proPO as a probe. Our knowledge on molecular properties of proPOs and their active forms has not reached to the level compatible with the purpose. Neither homogeneous cuticular proPO nor its active enzyme (PO) has been characterized (10Barrett F.M. Binnington K. Retnakaran A. Physiology in the Insect Epidermis. CSIRO Publications, Australia1991: 195-210Google Scholar), since the original suggestion of the presence of proPO in insect cuticle by Lai-Fook (11Lai-Fook J. J. Insect Physiol. 1966; 12: 195-226Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). With regard to the hemolymph proPO of lepidopteran insects, the presence of two isoforms has been indicated (12Yasuhara Y. Koizumi Y. Katagiri C. Ashida M. Arch. Biochemi. Biophys. 1995; 320: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 13Jiang H. Wang Y. Ma C. Kanost M.R. Insect Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 27: 835-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), but they have yet to be isolated and characterized. Here, we report the purification and characterization of isoforms of cuticular and hemolymph proPOs and some enzymatic properties of the active forms. We also present evidence of transport of hemolymph proPO to the cuticle and of modification occurring in the cuticular proenzymes. On the other hand, we found that cuticular proPO was not transported when it was injected into the hemocoel, indicating that the mechanism for recognition of subtle differences between cuticular and hemolymph proPOs operates in the process for the transport. Silkworm larvae (Kinsyu × Showa) were reared on the artificial diet Silkmate 2M (Kyodo Shiryo, Tokyo) at 25 °C under a 12-h photoperiod. Crude PPAE preparation referred to as PPAE (AS-salt) and purified PPAE preparation were obtained from larval cuticles of silkworms as previously reported (14Satoh D. Horii A. Ochiai M. Ashida M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7441-7453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The activity of PO was assayed by the spectrophotometric method that had originally been reported by Pye (15Pye A.E. Nature. 1974; 251: 610-613Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and has subsequently been used in our laboratory with modifications (16Yoshida H. Ashida M. Insect Biochem. 1986; 16: 539-545Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Briefly, PO was incubated at 30 °C for 5 min in 1.25 ml of a reaction mixture containing 80 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 8 mm 4-methylcatechol, and 8 mm4-hydroxyproline ethylester. The increase in absorbance at 520 nm was measured with a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, model UV-240). One unit of enzyme was defined as the amount causing an increase in absorbance of 0.01 under the above conditions. PO was assayed by this method throughout the present study, unless otherwise specified. The amount of proPO was quantified by assaying the PO activity after the conversion of proPO to PO by PPAE (AS-salt) at pH 7.5 as described previously (16Yoshida H. Ashida M. Insect Biochem. 1986; 16: 539-545Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar). One unit of proPO was defined as the amount of the protein that had 1 unit of PO activity upon activation. Cuticular proteins were extracted as described previously (4Ashida M. Brey P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10698-10702Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Briefly, each cuticle of fifth instar larvae reared to day 5–6 was subjected to extraction of proteins on ice for 1 h by using 1 ml of 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.2, containing 10 mm EDTA and 33.3 μm p-amidinophenyl-methanesulfonylfluoride (Sigma). The extract was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove the flocculent materials. Purification, except for column chromatography, was carried out at 4 °C. Column chromatography was performed at room temperature (20–25 °C). Cuticles from 70 larvae were subjected to extraction as described above, and the combined extracts were applied to a CM-Toyopearl (Toso) column (15 × 120 mm) equilibrated with 50 mm acetate buffer, pH 5.2, containing 10 mm EDTA. After application to the column, the nonadsorbed proteins were eluted with 60 ml of the same buffer as that used for the equilibration. During the chromatography, the flow rate was maintained at 2 ml/min. The flow-through fraction was saved, and the pH was adjusted to around 7.5 with 7 ml of 1m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, followed by dialysis against 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.1 mmEDTA. The dialyzed solution was stored at 4 °C and used as a CM-Toyopearl fraction. The CM-Toyopearl fraction was applied to a Super Q-Toyopearl (Toso) column (18 × 180 mm) equilibrated with10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. After washing the column with 20 ml of the buffer, adsorbed proteins were eluted with two consecutive linear gradients of NaCl (0–100 mm/10 min and 100–250 mm/120 min) established in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. 5-ml fractions were collected. Fractions eluted between 120 and 150 mm NaCl were pooled and dialyzed against 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. The dialyzed solution was applied to a hydroxyapatite (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) column (8.5 × 50 mm). Adsorbed proteins were eluted with two consecutive linear gradients (10–65 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5/110 min and 65–300 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5/50 min) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. Fractions of 1.5 ml were collected. Fractions eluted between 30 and 50 mm potassium phosphate were diluted 3-fold with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and applied to a Mono Q column HR5/5 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with the same buffer. Adsorbed proteins were eluted at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/min with two consecutive linear NaCl gradients (0–100 mm/20 min and 100–200 mm/120 min) established in 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5. Monitoring the absorbance at 280 nm of the effluent, 0.5–1-ml fractions were collected manually. Cuticular proPO was eluted from the column in two fractions: fraction I between 160 and 166 mm NaCl and fraction II between 169 and 175 mm NaCl. These two fractions were rechromatographed separately on the Mono Q column under the same eluting conditions as those described above. In the rechromatography, proPOs in fractions I and II were eluted between 163 and 167 mm NaCl and between 169 and 175 mmNaCl, respectively. The purified proPOs originating from fractions I and II were designated proPO-CS and proPO-CF, respectively. The collection of hemolymph from silkworm larvae and the first ammonium sulfate fractionation of the hemolymph proteins were performed according to the method of Ashida (17Ashida M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1971; 144: 749-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Column chromatography was carried out at room temperature (20–25 °C), and other purification procedures were performed at 4 °C, unless otherwise specified. Hemolymph (275 ml) was subjected to ammonium sulfate fractionation during which pH of the hemolymph was maintained at pH 6.5 by the addition of 0.1% ammonia water. The precipitate that appeared between 0.4 and 0.5 saturation of ammonium sulfate was dissolved in 30 ml of 0.2 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, which contained 20% (v/v) of saturated ammonium sulfate solution. The volume of the resulting slurry was adjusted to 80 ml by adding saturated ammonium sulfate solution. After being stirred for 1 h, the slurry was centrifuged at 8000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was added to 0.5 ml of 33.3 mm ofp-amidinophenyl-methanesulfonylfluoride and dialyzed for 20 h against 3 liters of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 mm EDTA and 150 mm NaCl. 71% of proPO precipitated between 0.4 and 0.5 saturation in the first ammonium sulfate fractionation was recovered in the dialyzed solution (data not shown). The dialyzed solution was incubated at 50 °C for 5 min and centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was dialyzed against 3 liters of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 mm EDTA. ProPO in one-third of the dialyzed solution was purified by chromatography on a Super Q-Toyopearl column, a hydroxyapatite column, and first and second chromatography on a Mono Q column in the same way as the cuticular proPO isoforms were purified. In the first Mono Q column chromatography, proPO was eluted in two fractions, fractions III and IV, at NaCl concentrations between 164 and 170 mm and between 173 and 180 mm, respectively. Fractions III and IV were separately subjected to the second Mono Q column chromatography. The proPOs purified from fractions III and IV were designated proPO-HS and proPO-HF, respectively. 10 μg of each proPO isoform in 0.1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, was added to 1 μg of purified PPAE in 10 μl of 3.5 mm N,N′-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-glycine buffer, pH 7.5, containing 35 mm KCl. The mixtures were incubated on ice for 30 min to complete the conversion of proPOs to POs. The active POs thus obtained from proPO-HS, proPO-HF, proPO-CS, and proPO-CF were designated PO-HS, PO-HF, PO-CS, and PO-CF, respectively. Substrate specificity of the POs was assessed at a fixed concentration (0.33 mm) of substrate as described by Andersen (18Andersen S.O. Insect Biochem. 1978; 8: 143-148Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100–500 units of POs were incubated at 25 °C in 2 ml of 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.33 mm of substrate and 7.5 × 10−4% (w/v) ascorbate. The substrates used were N-acetyldopamine (NADA), dopamine (DA), l-DOPA, methylhydroquinone, and hydroquinone. The decrease in absorbance at 265 nm was monitored. The intervals of the monitoring were from 5 to 30 s depending on the kind of substrate and the amount of the enzyme used for the particular assay. From the change in absorbance decreasing linearly with time, the oxidation rates of substrates were determined. Michaeris-Menten (Km) constants of POs for NADA, DA, and l-DOPA were examined as follows: 70–400 units of POs were incubated at 25 °C in 2 ml of a reaction mixture containing 100 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, and 0.0375–15 mm of each substrate. The rates of the initial absorbance changes were monitored at 390, 430, and 475 nm for NADA, DA, andl-DOPA, respectively (19Aso Y. Kramer K.J. Hopkins T.L. Whetzel S.Z. Insect Biochem. 1984; 14: 463-472Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The results were graphically analyzed according to the method of Lineweaver and Burk (20Lineweaver H. Burk D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1934; 56: 658-666Crossref Scopus (7890) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of carbon monoxide on the PO activity, the reaction mixture (0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, containing 0.5 mm of l-DOPA) for the enzyme assay was equilibrated with a gas of which the composition was 80% CO and 20% O2. After equilibration, PO was added to the reaction mixture, and the activity was assayed by measuring the rate of the initial absorbance change at 475 nm. As a control, a gas with 80% N2 instead of CO was used. Subunits of each proPO isoform were separated on an octadecyl (ODS) column (YMC-Pac ODS-AP; pore size, 300 Å; column size, 4.6 × 250 mm) as described previously (12Yasuhara Y. Koizumi Y. Katagiri C. Ashida M. Arch. Biochemi. Biophys. 1995; 320: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified proPO isoforms were diluted 5-fold with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and applied separately to the ODS column equilibrated with 5% acetonitrile (AcCN) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Adsorbed polypeptides were eluted with two consecutive AcCN gradients (5–30%/5 min and 30–65%/65 min) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Separated proPO subunits were lyophilized and stored at −20 °C until use. The isolated subunits of each isoform were named by adding suffixes such as pI, pI*, or pII, where the p stands for polypeptide and Roman numerals, including that with an asterisk, indicate the lengths of retention times of subunits of the proPO isoform in RP-HPLC, being shorter in the order of I, I*, and II. The following proPO subunits were isolated from proPO isoforms: proPO-HS-pI and proPO-HS-pII from proPO-HS; proPO-HF-pI and proPO-HF-pII from proPO-HF; proPO-CS-pI, proPO-CS-pI*, and proPO-CS-pII from proPO-CS; and proPO-CF-pI, proPO-CF-pI*, and proPO-CF-pII from proPO-CF. 100–300 μg of each proPO subunit was dissolved in 200 μl of 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.2, containing 5 m guanidine-HCl and 5 mm EDTA. 10 μl of 10 mg/ml dithiothreitol was added to the solution, and the solution was incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Then 4 μl of 4-vinylpyridine was added to the solution, and the solution was incubated at room temperature for 6 h. After the addition of 20 μl of formic acid, the solution was desalted by ODS column chromatography and then subjected to lyophilization. The lyophilized S-pyridylethylated proPO subunits were stored at −20 °C until use. Each of the S-pyridylethylated proPO subunits was dissolved in 0.15 ml of 0.2 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 8 m urea. The solution was diluted 2-fold with 0.2 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, and incubated with 1–3 μg of lysylendopeptidase (Lys-C) (Wako Pure Chemical Industries) at 37 °C for 6 h. The incubated solution was applied to the same ODS column as that used for the separation of proPO subunits. The adsorbed peptides were eluted with a linear gradient (5–65% AcCN/120 min) in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Peptides eluted in well separated peaks were lyophilized and stored at −20 °C until use. SDS-PAGE was performed in a 1-mm-thick slab gel according to the method of Laemmli (21Laemmli D.E. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar), with 14% acrylamide in the separating gel. Proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (CBB). Phosphorylase a (92.5 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66.2 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (31 kDa), soybean trypsin inhibitor (21.5 kDa), and lysozyme (14.4 kDa) were used as molecular mass standards. PAGE under nondenaturing conditions was performed by adopting the buffer system of Davis (22Davis B.J. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1964; 121: 404-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (15912) Google Scholar) in a 1-mm-thick slab gel with 4.5% acrylamide in the separating gel. In the case of crude proPO samples, proPO was converted to PO in the gel after the electrophoresis and localized by the method of Asada et al. (23Asada N. Fujimoto K. Tanaka M. Ohnishi E. Jpn. J. Genet. 1993; 68: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The molecular masses of native cuticular proPO isoforms were determined using a Superose 12 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as previously reported (12Yasuhara Y. Koizumi Y. Katagiri C. Ashida M. Arch. Biochemi. Biophys. 1995; 320: 14-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, 50 μg of proPO-CS or proPO-CF was applied to the column equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm KCl. The column was calibrated by the chromatography of a mixture of molecular mass standards (Combithek Calibration Proteins II, Roche Diagnostics) consisting of ferritin (450 kDa), catalase (240 kDa), aldolase (158 kDa), bovine serum albumin (68 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), α-chymotrypsin (25 kDa), and cytochromec (12.5 kDa). Electrospray ionization mass spectra of peptides were obtained using a JEOL JMS-SX102A mass spectrometer (JEOL Co., Ltd.). The peptides were subjected to analyses at the concentration of 1 pmol/μl in a solvent containing 1% acetic acid and 50% AcCN. The spectrometer was operated at the source voltage of 65 V and source temperature of 100 °C. Samples were scanned over a mass range of 700–1600 Da. The instrument was calibrated using bovine insulin (5733.5 Da). Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometric analyses were performed using a Kompact MALDI IV (Shimadzu Corp.). Sinapinic acid, α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, or gentisic acid was used as a matrix. The saturated matrix solution was prepared in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid containing 50% AcCN. 100–300 pmol of each sample was dissolved in 0.1 ml of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid containing 50% AcCN. After 1 μl of the matrix solution had dried and the matrix crystals had formed on a sample slide, 1 μl of the sample solution was applied on the matrix crystals and dried. Forty laser shots were applied to each sample, and a spectrum was obtained as a sum of 40 spectra observed after each laser shot. Substance P (1347.6 Da), bovine insulin (5733.5 Da), horse heart myoglobin (16,950.9 Da), and bovine serum albumin (66,430 Da) were used as mass number standards for calibration of the instrument. Peptides were sequenced according to the method of Edman and Begg (24Edman P. Begg G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 1: 80-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2410) Google Scholar) using an automated protein sequencer PPSQ-10 (Shimadzu Corp.). Poly(A)+ mRNAs were obtained from silkworm hemocytes as described previously (25Kawabata T. Yasuhara Y. Ochiai M. Matsuura S. Ashida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7774-7778Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). A hemocyte cDNA library was constructed using a λZap II cDNA Synthesis kit (Stratagene) and Gigapack III Goldpacking Extract (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A 1.9-kbp EcoRI fragment of a cDNA clone, pPO-17, which was described in our previous paper (25Kawabata T. Yasuhara Y. Ochiai M. Matsuura S. Ashida M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7774-7778Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using a Ready-To-Go-DNA Labeling kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). About 5000 clones of the cDNA library were screened at high stringency using the labeled 1.9-kbp fragment as a probe. Eight positive clones were detected. They were investigated for the presence of variants of pPO-17 with PCR and the susceptibility of the PCR products to the restriction enzyme, SmaI. Primers, 5′-ATGGCTGACGTTTTTGAAAGCCTCGAGTTG-3′ and 5′-CATGGGAGGGTTCCGTGGGTTAGGTTCGG-3′, were synthesized to obtain a PCR product that covers the entire open reading frame of the cDNA of pPO-17. The PCR products were all 2.1 kbp, corresponding to the size of the entire open reading frame of pPO-17. The amino acid sequence Asn12-Pro13-Gly14 found in the peptide fragment, 12c from proPO-HF-pII (see Table II), was judged to correspond to the nucleotide sequence of 5′-AACCCGGGC-3′ in pPO-17. On the other hand, in the peptide fragment, 12d from proPO-HS-pII, the Pro residue in the sequence of Asn12-Pro13-Gly14 was displaced by Gln (see Table II). The cDNA sequence encoding the sequence Asn-Gln-Gly was thought to have mutated at least in one of two ways, to 5′-AACCAGGGC-3′ or 5′-AACAAGGGC-3′. The nucleotide sequence 5′-AACCCGGGC-3′ in the sequence of pPO-17 contains the sequence (5′-CCCGGG-3′) recognized by the restriction endonucleaseSmaI, but the 5′-AACCAGGGC-3′ and 5′-AACAAGGGC-3′ sequences do not. Based on these observations and reasoning, the PCR products were treated with SmaI. Five of eight PCR products were cleaved by SmaI to give two fragments, the 1.3-kbp fragment and the 0.8-kbp fragment. The other three PCR products were not cleaved by the enzyme. The cDNA clones that had been the templates of the three PCR products were subcloned into pBbluescipt SK. Three clones (pPO-21, pPO-22, and pPO-23) with 2.3-kbp inserts were obtained. The inserts were sequenced and found to have identical sequences, although the lengths of their noncoding regions on the 5′ side varied. One of them (pPO-23; accession number AB048761) was used as a clone containing the cDNA encoding proPO-HS-pII in the present study.Table IIN-terminal sequences and molecular masses of some lysylendopeptidase fragments of proPO subunits, proPO-HS-pII and proPO-HF-pIIFragment 2-aFragments 12c and 14c originated from proPO-HF-pII. 12d and 14d originated from proPO-HS-pII.

https://openalex.org/W1973227020,"Studies in non-neuronal cells show that c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) play a key role in apoptotic cell death. In some neurons JNK is also thought to initiate cell death by the activation of c-Jun. JNK inhibition has been achieved pharmacologically by inhibiting upstream kinases, but there has been no direct demonstration that inhibition of JNK can prevent neuronal death. We have therefore examined whether the JNK binding domain (JBD) of JNK-interacting protein-1 (JIP-1, a scaffold protein and specific inhibitor of JNK) can inhibit c-Jun phosphorylation and support the survival of sympathetic neurons deprived of NGF. We show that expression of the JBD in >80% of neurons was sufficient to prevent the phosphorylation of c-Jun and its nuclear accumulation as well as abrogate neuronal cell death induced by NGF deprivation. JBD expression also preserved the capacity of mitochondria to reduce MTT. Interestingly, although the PTB domain of JIP was reported to interact with rhoGEF, expression of the JBD domain was sufficient to localize the protein to the membrane cortex and growth cones. Hence, JNK activation is a key event in apoptotic death induced by NGF withdrawal, where its point of action lies upstream of mitochondrial dysfunction."

S3a and S3b bound to insoluble collagen, but S2 did not, thus indicating that S3 forms a collagen-binding domain (CBD). Because S3a+S3b showed the most efficient binding to substrate, cooperative binding by both domains was suggested for the enzyme.

They are the most abundant proteins in mammals, constituting a quarter of their total weight. Collagens are not only structural proteins with a high tensile strength but also affect cell differentiation, migration, and attachment. Nineteen different types are known to date, and type I collagen is the major species in higher vertebrates. In the endoplasmic reticulum of fibroblasts, collagen precursor peptides are hydroxylated by various dioxygenases (prolyl hydroxylases and a lysyl hydroxylase), glycosylated at the hydroxylysine residues, and folded into a triple helix. HSP47 associates with procollagen during this modification and/or folding processes and is assumed to function as a collagen-specific molecular chaperone (1Nagata K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 22-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). The precursor is secreted into the extracellular space, and its N- and C-terminal propeptides are removed by procollagen peptidases. Cleavage triggers the arrangement of collagen monomers into a staggered array called fibrils, which are insoluble macromolecular assemblies having lengths up to a few hundred micrometers. One can observe 67-nm-wide cross striations (overlap and gap zones) on the fibrils by electron microscopy, which are formed by the regular arrangement of collagen monomers. Each collagen monomer consists of collagenous and noncollagenous regions. The former have a regular amino acid sequence, which is a repeat (338 times in type I collagen) of the Gly-X-Y triplet, forming a long (300 nm in type I collagen) triple-helical domain. Proline and hydroxyproline residues are most common in the X andY positions, respectively, and this combination stabilizes the helix to the highest extent (2Ramshaw J.A. Shah N.K. Brodsky B. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 122: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The latter regions lack the sequence and conformation characteristic of the former, and are named telopeptides, because they are located at the N and C termini of the collagenous region. Clostridium histolyticum is a strictly anaerobic Gram-positive bacterium that is one of the causative agents of gas gangrene. The pathogen produces a variety of collagenases in large quantity, which efficiently degrade collagen in connective tissue. Although the enzyme has been widely used in biological experiments, its detailed biochemical characteristics have not been fully understood (3Worthington C.C. Worthington Enzyme Manual: Collagenase. Worthington Biochemical Co., Freehold, NJ1988Google Scholar). Previously, we have shown that C. histolyticum has two divergent collagenase genes (colG and colH) in its chromosome, which encode two distinct enzymes; class I collagenase (ColG)1 and class II collagenase (ColH) (4Matsushita O. Jung C.-M. Katayama S. Minami J. Takahashi Y. Okabe A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 923-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Yoshihara K. Matsushita O. Minami J. Okabe A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6489-6496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their deduced amino acid sequences showed no significant similarity to those of eukaryotic matrix metalloproteases. Comparison of the ColG and ColH sequences revealed their segmental structure; S1+S2+S3a+S3b for ColG and S1+S2a+S2b+S3 for ColH as shown in Fig. 1 A (see below). A truncated ColH consisting of only S1 showed full hydrolytic activity on a peptide substrate (6Matsushita O. Jung C.-M. Minami J. Katayama S. Nishi N. Okabe A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3643-3648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). When a consensus motif for zinc proteases, HEXXH, present in S1 was altered, catalytic activity was drastically reduced (7Jung C.-M. Matsushita O. Katayama S. Minami J. Sakurai J. Okabe A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2816-2822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, S1 was assumed to contain the catalytic domain. However, an isolated C-terminal fragment, S2b+S3 from ColH, bound to lyophilized insoluble collagen to the same extent as full-length ColH (6Matsushita O. Jung C.-M. Minami J. Katayama S. Nishi N. Okabe A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3643-3648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This observation lead us to conclude that this C-terminal fragment contains the collagen-binding domain (CBD). Considering the complex macromolecular structure of collagen fibrils, however, the structure of the substrate molecule/moiety recognized by CBD is not fully understood. It could be even a disparate molecule closely associated with collagen fibrils. For applications, we have shown that the CBD can be used to anchor peptide-signaling molecules to collagen-containing tissues (8Nishi N. Matsushita O. Yuube K. Miyanaka H. Okabe A. Wada F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7018-7023Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Fusion proteins between growth factors and S2b+S3 bound not only to insoluble collagen in vitro but to connective tissue in vivo. A fusion protein carrying basic fibroblast growth factor joined to the N terminus of S2b+S3 remained in type I collagen-rich tissue when injected subcutaneously into nude mice and exerted a growth-promoting effect at the sites of injection much longer than basic fibroblast growth factor alone. To apply the findings more widely to drug delivery systems, it is essential to diminish the antigenicity of the CBD. One straightforward approach is to synthesize mimics of the CBD by rational drug design, based on its molecular structure. To achieve this objective, detailed information is needed,i.e. the minimal region for collagen binding, the minimal receptor moiety, and the structure of the bimolecular complex. Furthermore, elucidation of the molecular mechanism of collagen binding provides insights to understand the biosynthesis and degradation of extracellular matrix proteins. Thus, we carried out binding experiments using various C-terminal fragments of class I collagenase (ColG) and subcomponents or mimics of human type I collagen. Restriction endonucleases were purchased from Takara Shuzo Co. (Kyoto, Japan), Toyobo (Osaka, Japan), and New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). The DNA ligation kit was a product of Takara Shuzo. All recombinant DNA procedures were carried out as described by Sambrook et al. (9Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). All constructs were sequenced to confirm the reading frame on an automated nucleotide sequencer (model ABI PRISM 377, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Foster City, CA). A Thermo Sequenase fluorescence-labeled primer cycle sequencing kit with 7-deaza-dGTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK) and −21M13 or M13 reverse dye primer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used for sequencing the constructs in the pT7Blue T-vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). An ABI PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing ready kit with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase, FS (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and pGEX primers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) were used for sequencing the GST fusion constructs. The segmental boundaries of C. histolyticum class I collagenase (ColG) were determined from an alignment of the amino acid sequences of three clostridial collagenases (4Matsushita O. Jung C.-M. Katayama S. Minami J. Takahashi Y. Okabe A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 923-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nucleotide fragments encoding the C-terminal segments were obtained by PCR using either pCHG5 or pCHG51 (4Matsushita O. Jung C.-M. Katayama S. Minami J. Takahashi Y. Okabe A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 923-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) plasmid DNA as the template and the following pairs of synthetic primers; 5′-CCCGGGACAGATAATGCGGATATTAG-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGTTAATCTTCGTTCTTTATTTCTA-3′ for segment 2 (S2, Thr677-Asp772); 5′-CCCGGGACAACAACACCTATAACTAA-3′ (S3a-5′ primer) and 5′-CTCGAGCTATTTCTCGTTACCTAATCCTT-3′ for segment 3a (S3a, Thr773-Lys896); 5′-CCCGGGAACGAGAAATTGAAGGAAAA-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGTTATTTATTTACCCTTAACT-3′ (S3b-3′ primer) for segment 3b (S3b, Asn894-Lys1008); and S3a-5′ primer and S3b-3′ primer for segments 3a and 3b (S3a3b, Thr773-Lys1008). These fragments were cloned into the pT7Blue T-vector. After their correct nucleotide sequences were confirmed, they were inserted into pGEX-4T-2 vector DNA between the SmaI and XhoI sites to express the C-terminal fragments as GST fusion proteins. Escherichia coliDH5α-competent cells were transformed with each ligation mixture by electroporation. After the nucleotide sequence of each fusion gene was confirmed, E. coli BL21 was transformed with the recombinant plasmids. Each clone was grown in 100 ml of 2YT-G medium to an optical density at 600 nm of 2.5. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.1 mm, and cells were grown for further 2 h. Purification of the fusion protein was performed with a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (bed volume, 0.5-ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described by the manufacturer. To confirm that each fusion protein was produced as designed, the proteins were cleaved by incubation with thrombin (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 10 units/mg of fusion protein) for 10 h at room temperature. Two hundred picomoles of the cleavage products was separated on a 12.5% SDS gel and transferred onto a sheet of polyvinylidene diflouride membrane (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) by electroblotting (10Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44924) Google Scholar). The membrane was briefly washed with distilled water, and stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R as described by the manufacture. Bands corresponding to the C-terminal fragments were cut out and subjected to the amino acid sequencing using a protein sequencer (model 492, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The sequence was determined up to the 20th residue for each fragment. The thrombin-cleaved protein fractions were dialyzed three times against 1 liter of phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C to remove glutathione. The N-terminal GST fragment was removed by applying the fraction to a glutathione-Sepharose 4B column (bed volume, 0.5 ml). To measure the molecular mass of the purified C-terminal fragment, the sample was diluted with distilled water, mixed with 3,5-dimethoxy-4-hydroxycinnamic acid solution (10 mg/ml 50% ethanol), and analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS, model Kompact MALDI IV, Kratos, Manchester, UK) in the positive linear mode with time-delayed extraction and sperm whale myoglobin as an internal standard. S2, S3a, S3b, and S3a3b were dissolved at concentrations of 50 μg/ml in 50 mm Tris-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2 (pH 7.5, CB buffer) containing varying concentration (0–9 m) of urea. Fluorescence was measured by using an excitation wavelength of 290 nm with emission at 350 nm on a fluorescence spectrophotometer (model F-2000, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were measured from 300 μg of protein in 300 μl of CB buffer in a 1-mm cell in a spectropolarimeter (model J600, Jasco, Tokyo, Japan). The spectra for denatured proteins were obtained by dissolving the same amount of lyophilized protein in the same volume of CB buffer containing 9 m urea. A nucleotide fragment corresponding to the reading frame encoding mature ColG (Ile1-Lys1008) was prepared by PCR usingC. histolyticum genomic DNA and a pair of oligonucleotide primers: 5′-CCCCAAGCTTGCTAGCATAGCGAATACTAATTCTGAG-3′ and 5′-GGATCCTTATTTATTTACCCTTAACT-3′. The amplified fragment was inserted into pT7Blue T-vector DNA. A recombinant plasmid carrying an insert with the correct nucleotide sequence was chosen. To express the collagenase, a pET-11a vector (Novagene, Madison, WI) was employed. A unique EcoRI site in the vector was deleted by the fill-in reaction using Klenow enzyme prior to use (pET-11aΔRI). ThecolG fragment was inserted into the vector betweenNheI and BamHI sites, and E. coliBL21-CodonPlus(DE3)-RIL (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was transformed with the resultant plasmid (pEG101). The cells were grown in 2 liter of LB broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 30 μg/ml chloramphenicol to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.7. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cells were grown for 2 more hours. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7000 ×g for 15 min at 4 °C, suspended in 40 ml of CB buffer, and disrupted two times in a French pressure cell at 10,000 p.s.i. Ammonium sulfate was added to the cleared lysate to 60% saturation, and the precipitate was dissolved in 7 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). The sample (approximately 8.5 ml) was applied to a size exclusion column (Sephacryl S-200, 2.2 × 85 cm). Enzyme activity in the eluate was monitored by the Azocoll assay as described previously (11Matsushita O. Yoshihara K. Katayama S.-I. Minami J. Okabe A. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 149-156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pooled fraction was then applied to an ion exchange column (Q-Sepharose, 2.5 × 5.5 cm) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and proteins were eluted with a 400-ml gradient of 0–0.5 m NaCl in 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5). Activity eluted around 0.2 m NaCl. The pooled fraction was dialyzed two times against 1 liter of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). It was divided into six aliquots, and each was applied to an ion-exchange fast protein liquid chromatography column (MonoQ, bed volume 1 ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The column was pre-equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient of the same buffer as described above. The combined active fractions were divided into nine aliquots, and each was applied to a size exclusion fast protein liquid chromatography column (Superose 12 10/30, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) pre-equilibrated with 10 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2. A glutamate residue in the putative catalytic center,413HEYTH417, was mutated to a glutamine by site-directed mutagenesis. PCR was carried using pCHG4 (4Matsushita O. Jung C.-M. Katayama S. Minami J. Takahashi Y. Okabe A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 923-933Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) plasmid DNA, and two mutagenic primers; 5′-GAAGAATTGTTTAGACATCAATATACTCACTATTTACAA-3′ and 5′-TTGTAAATAGTGAGTATATTGATGTCTAAACAATTCTTC-3′. After the mutation was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing, the insert EcoRI fragment (0.80 kilobase) was used to replace the corresponding fragment in pEG101. The mutant collagenase, rColG(E414Q), was produced and purified in the same manner as the wild type. Specific activity against insoluble collagen was measured as described previously (7Jung C.-M. Matsushita O. Katayama S. Minami J. Sakurai J. Okabe A. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 2816-2822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity equals 1 μmol ofl-leucine equivalents liberated from collagen in 5 h at 37 °C under the specified conditions. The N-terminal amino acid sequence up to the 20th residue was determined as described above. The molecular mass was determined by MALDI-TOF MS. Binding of the CBD to type I collagen was determined as follows; 10 mg of collagen (acid-soluble collagen, Sigma type I) was incubated in 100 μl of protein mixture at room temperature for 30 min. The basal mixture (100 μl) contained 5 μg of bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 5 μg of chicken ovalbumin (Sigma), 5 μg of horse myoglobin (Sigma), 5.42 μg (0.2 nmol) of S3a3b (ColG), and 2.76 μg (0.2 nmol) of S3b (ColG) in CB buffer. The water phase was examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). When necessary, the salt concentration in CB buffer was modified (0, 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 m). To alter the pH of the buffer, Tris-HCl was replaced with 0.1 mBisTris-HCl (pH 6.0 or 7.0) or Tris-HCl (pH 7.0, 8.0, or 9.0). The effect of divalent cations was examined by replacing CaCl2with 1 mm EGTA or 1 mm EGTA plus 2 mm CaCl2. Semi-quantitative measurements of binding were carried out as described previously (6Matsushita O. Jung C.-M. Minami J. Katayama S. Nishi N. Okabe A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3643-3648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), where the amount of the unbound fusion protein was quantitated by GST assay using 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene as the substrate. Size exclusion chromatography experiments were performed at room temperature on a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system equipped with a Superdex 75 column (1 × 30 cm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. S3b (20 μg) was dissolved in 50 μl of CB buffer or the same buffer containing 1 mm EGTA instead of Ca2+, and chromatographed. The following proteins were used as molecular mass standards: γ-globulins, 158 kDa; bovine serum albumin (BSA), 68 kDa; chicken ovalbumin, 44 kDa; and cytochrome c, 12.5 kDa. The measurements were carried out in triplicate. The hydrodynamic radius of S3b was measured at 20 °C using a dynamic laser light-scattering instrument (model DynaPro 99, Protein Solutions, Charlottesville, VA). S3b was dissolved in CB buffer or CB buffer containing 1 mmEGTA instead of Ca2+ at a concentration of 5.66 mg/ml. The samples were filtrated through a 0.02-μm filter before analysis. Bovine skin atelocollagen was purchased from Koken (Tokyo, Japan). To remove the water-soluble fraction, atelocollagen was treated with water-soluble carbodiimide prior to use. Ten milligrams of atelocollagen powder were washed in 1 ml of ice-cold 0.1 m potassium phosphate (pH 5.5) three times. It was suspended in 1 ml of the same buffer, and solid 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC, Pierce, Rockford, IL) was added to the suspension to a final concentration of 0.1 m. The suspension was incubated at 4 °C for 24 h with gentle shaking. Atelocollagen was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min and washed with 1 ml of CB buffer three times. The pretreated atelocollagen was transferred into an Ultrafree microcentrifugal device with a 0.22-μm low binding Durapore membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA), which was placed in a microcentrifuge tube. The buffer was removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 5 min. The atelocollagen precipitate was incubated in 100 μl of the basal protein mixture for 30 min at room temperature. The water phase was collected by centrifugation and examined by SDS-PAGE. Telopeptides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 432A peptide synthesizer using the standard fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl method on 4-hydroxymethyl phenoxyacetamidomethyl resin. Their amino acid sequences, based on those of human type I collagen (GenBank™ accession numbers,P02452 and P08123) were as follows; QLSYGYDEKSTGGISVP (17 aa residues) for α1(I) N-telopeptide; SAGFDFSFLPQPPQEKAHDGGRYYRA (26 aa residues) for α1(I) C-telopeptide; QYDGKGVGLGP (11 aa residues) for α2(I) N-telopeptide; and GGGYDFGYDGDFYRA (15 aa residues) for α2(I) C-telopeptide. These peptides were cleaved off from the resin, deprotected by the supplier's standard procedure, and purified by reversed phase chromatography on a Shimadzu HPLC system using a Tosoh ODS-80TM column. The purity of the final peptide fractions was greater than 95% estimated by the same HPLC system. Identity of the peptides was confirmed by amino acid sequencing using an Applied Biosystems 492 protein sequencer. Collagenous peptides, (PPG)5, (PPG)10, (POG)5, and (POG)10, were purchased from Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). The synthesis and purification of the other collagenous peptides were described elsewhere (12Koide T. Asada S. Nagata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34523-34526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Peptides were dried under vacuum before weighing to prepare solutions in 0.2m NaHCO3, 1 m NaCl (pH 8.3). The peptide solutions (6 mg/ml) were incubated at 4 °C for 48 h prior to use. To prepare 150 μl of the peptide-coupled gel beads, 43 mg of CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) powder was suspended in 1 ml of 1 mm HCl and incubated for 5 min. The suspension was centrifuged at 500 × g for 1 min to remove the water phase. This washing was repeated a total of three times. The gel was washed once with 1 ml of distilled water in the same way, and was suspended in 500 μl of the peptide solution. The suspension was incubated on a rotary shaker for 2 h. The peptide solution was removed by centrifugation, and the gel was incubated in 1 ml of 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) over night on a rotary shaker to block any remaining active groups. The gel was sequentially washed with 1 ml each of 0.1 m NaHCO3, 0.5m NaCl (pH 8.3, Coupling buffer); 0.1 m sodium acetate, 0.5 m NaCl (pH 4.5); and Coupling buffer. CB buffer was added to the gel to obtain the final suspension (1 ml). All the above procedures were carried out at room temperature (25 ± 1 °C), and the suspension was stored at 4 °C. Gelatin-Sepharose 4B was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B powder (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was rehydrated and washed with distilled water as described by the supplier. 2-O-α-d-Glucopyranosyl-d-galactose (5 mg, Glc-Gal) was purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, ON, Canada) and dissolved in 150 μl of 0.1 m NaOH prior to use. The swollen gel beads (75 μl) were mixed with all the carbohydrate solution. After the suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 16 h with gentle mixing, the beads were washed with 300 μl of 0.1 m NaOH and subsequently with 400 μl of 1m ethanolamine-HCl (pH 8.0). The beads were suspended in 400 μl of 1 m ethanolamine-HCl (pH 8.0) at 45 °C for 10 h to block any remaining active groups. The gel was sequentially washed alternatively with 0.4 ml each of 0.1 msodium acetate, 0.5 m NaCl (pH 4.5) and 0.1 mTris-HCl, 0.5 m NaCl (pH 8.0) three times. The beads were washed with 0.4 ml of CB buffer three times and used for the binding assay. A suspension containing 50 μl of Sepharose beads coupled with peptides, gelatin, or disaccharide was added to an 0.5-ml microcentrifuge tube. The gel was centrifuged at 500 × g for 1 min and washed once with 0.4 ml of CB buffer. Then it was suspended in 100 μl of the above protein mixture. The suspension was incubated at 25 ± 1 °C for 30 min on a rotary shaker, and the water phase was collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 1 min. The sample (30 μl) was mixed with 4× SDS reducing dye (10 μl), boiled for 3 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE using 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (13Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207231) Google Scholar). To examine the bound fraction, the gel beads were washed twice with 0.4 ml of CB buffer and suspended in 50 μl of 2× SDS reducing dye. The suspension was boiled for 3 min to solubilize the bound protein(s). After centrifugation, the water phase (40 μl) was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Binding of S3b, S3a3b, and rColG(E414Q) to a collagenous peptide was measured by surface plasmon resonance using a BIACORE apparatus (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden). A peptide, G(POG)8, was dissolved in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 6.0), and the solution was incubated at 4 °C for 48 h prior to use. The peptide was covalently immobilized to a biosensor chip CM5 through the α-amino group following the supplier's protocol. To minimize interaction between multiple ligands and a single protein molecule (“bridging”), the peptide was used at a low concentration (0.1 mg/ml) to achieve a low ligand density (432.5 RU). Resonance was measured in 10 mm Na-HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.005% Tween 20 with a flow rate of 20 μl/min at 25 °C. After each cycle the chip was regenerated with a 180-s pulse of 0.1 m HCl. Values for apparent dissociation constants, KD (app), were calculated from equilibrium binding data at eight protein concentrations (100 nm to 300 μm) for S3b, and at eight protein concentrations (30 nm to 100 μm) for S3a3b. Data were directly fit using the following equation by least square method, cRU=KA×cRUmax×[protein]/(1+KA×[protein])Equation 1 where cRU is the response at equilibrium corrected for bulk refractive index errors using a sham-coupled flow cell blocked with ethanolamine, [protein] is the analyte concentration, andKA is the association constant.KD (app) is the reciprocal ofKA. Various C-terminal segments (S2, S3a, S3b, and S3a3b) of C. histolyticum class I collagenase (ColG) were expressed as GST fusion proteins (Fig.1 B). The C-terminal fragments were cleaved off from the N-terminal carrier by thrombin, and their N-terminal amino acid sequences were determined. For each fragment, the initial 20 amino acid residues coincided with the expected sequence. The carrier was removed by affinity chromatography, and each C-terminal fragment was purified to homogeneity. Although the molecular masses calculated for S2, S3a, S3b, and S3a3b were 10,769, 14,223, 13,787, and 27,055 Da, the values estimated by SDS-PAGE were 16.5, 23.0, 16.5, and 38.0 kDa, respectively. To determine whether these discrepancies were due to abnormal mobility, the molecular masses were measured by time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The observed values were 10,758, 14,208, 13,776, and 27,070, for the respective fragments, coinciding well with the calculated values. Binding of GST fusion proteins to collagen was examined semi-quantitatively using lyophilized type I collagen, which is insoluble at neutral pH. As shown in TableI, the fusion protein containing S3 bound while that containing S2 did not. The fusion proteins were cleaved at the linker by thrombin, and the binding of the C-terminal fragments was measured together with N-terminal GST as a control (Fig.1 C). Folding of the purified C-terminal fragments was analyzed by measurement of fluorescence and CD in the presence and absence of urea. The fluorescence intensity of S2 at 350 nm started to increase at 7 m urea, whereas that of S3a, S3b, and S3a3b increased at 5 m urea. The latter proteins all gave similar curves (Fig. 2 A). Because all the proteins seemed to be unfolded in the presence of 9 murea, CD spectra were also recorded in this condition (Fig. 2,B–E). In the absence of urea, the spectrum was characteristic for the respective protein, but the uniqueness was lost in the presence of urea. The molar ellipticity profile of S3a3b (Fig.2 E) correlated well to the averaged pattern for S3a (Fig.2 C) and S3b (Fig. 2 D). Binding of monomeric (S3b) and tandem (S3a3b) S3 to type I collagen were measured in various buffers. Neither addition of sodium chloride up to 1 m(Fig. 3 A) or alteration of the pH within a range between 6.0 and 9.0 (Fig. 3 B) affected binding significantly. However, addition of 1 mm EGTA instead of Ca2+ inhibited binding significantly (Fig.3 C). The effect of the chelator was reversed by the addition of a 1 mm excess of Ca2+. The apparen"

The ability of eNOS to generate nitric oxide (NO) has traditionally been ascribed to agonist-stimulated calcium-dependent activation. However, during recent years several groups have demonstrated that activation of eNOS, both in conjunction with and independent of intracellular calcium flux, occurs through the allosteric binding of eNOS with neighboring regulatory proteins (4Ju H.

Here we demonstrate that pools of eNOS and dynamin bind within cells in a manner regulated by ionic stringency and intracellular signals and that in vitro the proteins bind directly in a stoichiometric and high affinity manner. Additionally, the interaction of dynamin with eNOS potentiates eNOS catalysis in cells and in vitro. These studies identify a new NOS-associated protein and provide a novel function for dynamin-2. All tissue culture and transfection reagents were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. eNOS mAb and pAb were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Golgi 58-kDa protein was obtained from Sigma. The dynamin-2 pAb (dyn2T) has been previously described (12Henley J. Krueger E. Oswald B. McNiven M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 85-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). This antibody recognizes the proline-rich COOH-terminal tail unique to dynamin-2 and specifically precipitates this dynamin isoform from brain lysates. Calcium ionophore, A23187, was obtained from Sigma.3H-Labeled l-arginine and35S-labeled methionine were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC), Clone 9 cells (rat hepatocyte cell line) (14Jones S. Howell K. Henley J. Cao H. McNiven M.

The BAEC used in this study were between P2 and P5 and were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). BAEC were cultured in EGM, Clone 9 cells in Ham's F-12K medium, and ECV 304 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 400 μg/ml G418. Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine (1 mm), penicillin (100 IU/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml). For transfections, Clone 9 cells were plated on glass coverslips in 12-well plates and cotransfected with a bovine eNOS expression vector (pcDNA3) and a rat dynamin-2 expression vector (pEGFP-N1) (22Cao H.

Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Thirty six hours after transfection, Clone 9 cells were prepared for immunofluorescence microscopy, and eNOS-GFP ECV 304 cells (21Sowa G. Liu J. Papapetropoulos A. Rex-Haffner M. Hughes T. Sessa W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22524-22531Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) were prepared for NOS activity assay and immunoprecipitation analysis. Recombinant eNOS protein was purified fromEscherichia coli as described previously (23Martasek P. Liu Q. Liu J. Roman L. Gross S. Sessa W. Masters B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 24Roman L. Sheta E. Martasek P. Gross S. Liu Q. Masters B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In brief, bovine eNOS in the plasmid, pCW was coexpressed with pGroELS plasmid into protease-deficient E. coli. eNOS was purified from extracts using a 2′,5′-ADP Sepharose 4B column. Typically 2.5–4 mg of eNOS was recovered from each preparation, yielding a single major band as determined by SDS-PAGE. Purified eNOS was stabilized withl-arginine (0.5 mm) and 5-fold molar excess of BH4. A cDNA construct encoding full-length GST-dynamin-2 fusion protein was created by subcloning dynamin-2 cDNA into the GST fusion protein vector, pGEX-1. GST-dynamin and GST constructs were transformed into BL21 (DE3) and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) overnight and lysed by sonication with lysozyme 200 μg/ml in a buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.2), 100 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μm leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF. Samples were resonicated after addition of Triton X-100 to a final concentration of 1%. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation, and supernatant was mixed with glutathione-Sepharose beads and agitated for 2 h at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 500 rpm, and pellets were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline with 1% Triton X-100. Specificity and quality of GST-dynamin was assessed by Coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE gels and Western blotting of transferred proteins as depicted in Fig. 4 A. [35S]Methionine eNOS was translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates using the TnT Coupled Reticulocye Lysate System (Promega, Madison, WI). The reaction mix, containing bovine eNOS DNA (or alternatively negative control containing empty vector), SP6 RNA polymerase promoter, and [35S]methionine, was incubated at 30 °C for 90 min. Translation products were examined by SDS-PAGE analysis and autoradiography of dried gels. Binding assays using [35S]methionine eNOS were performed as described below. BAEC and Clone 9 cells (48 h after cotransfection with eNOS and GFP-dynamin) were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde. Double-labeling immunofluorescence was performed in BAEC as previously described in liver endothelial cells (25Shah V. Haddad F. Garcia-Cardena G. Frangos J. Mennone A. Groszmann R. Sessa W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2923-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), by incubating cells with eNOS pAb and Golgi 58-kDa protein mAb, dynamin pAb and Golgi 58-kDa protein mAb, or alternatively eNOS mAb and dynamin pAb. Immunofluorescence in Clone 9 cells transfected with GFP-dynamin was performed by incubating cells in eNOS mAb only. Primary antibodies were detected using fluorescein isothiocyanate- and Texas Red-coupled secondary antibodies. Washes were performed with phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% bovine serum albumin after both primary and secondary antibody incubation. Cells were mounted in Anti-fade (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and visualized using a confocal microscope (LSM 510, Zeiss, Germany). BAEC were homogenized in a lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 μmleupeptin, 1 mm PMSF, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% deoxycholate (pH 7.5)). In some experiments, BAEC were incubated in media containing 10 μm A23187 or equal volume of vehicle (Me2SO) for 10 min prior to lysis. Protein quantification of samples was performed using the Bio-Rad protein assay. eNOS immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating 1-ml aliquots of detergent-soluble protein lysate with excess eNOS mAb overnight (1:200 dilution) or alternatively with equal concentration of mouse IgG after preclearing of samples with Pansorbin as previously described (26Shah V. Toruner M. Haddad F. Cadelina G. Papapetropoulos A. Sessa W. Groszmann R. Gastroenterology. 1999; 117: 1222-1228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Alternatively, dynamin immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating lysates with excess dynamin pAb (5 μg/ml) overnight. Immunocomplexes were bound by incubating protein samples with protein A beads for 1 h at 4 °C. Triplicate samples of bound proteins were extensively washed in a buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 μm leupeptin, 1 mm PMSF) containing 0 mm NaCl, 100 mm NaCl, or alternatively 1m NaCl. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling samples in Laemmli loading buffer. Gel electrophoresis of proteins and Western blotting were performed as previously described (25Shah V. Haddad F. Garcia-Cardena G. Frangos J. Mennone A. Groszmann R. Sessa W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2923-2930Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), using eNOS mAb and dynamin pAb. Membranes were stained with Ponceau S or gels with Coomassie Blue to confirm equal protein loading. Densitometric analysis of autoradiographs was performed using Scion Image from the National Institutes of Health. Increasing concentrations of recombinant eNOS proteins (60–300 nm) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with GST-dynamin beads or, alternatively, GST beads alone in immunoprecipitation buffer in the absence of detergents. Bound proteins were washed in a buffer containing 50 mmTris (pH 7.7), 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA (8Garcia-Cardena G. Martasek P. Masters B.S. Skidd P.M. Couet J. Li S. Lisanti M.P. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25437-25440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). Bound proteins were eluted with Laemmli buffer and used for gel electrophoresis. In vitro binding of GST-dynamin with35S-eNOS was examined by incubating GST-dynamin beads (60–600 nm) or GST beads alone, with a fixed concentration of in vitro translated eNOS (3 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate) or, alternatively, by incubating increasing concentrations ofin vitro translated eNOS (1–12 μl of rabbit reticulocyte lysate) with a fixed concentration of GST-dynamin beads, in 300 μl of a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA overnight. Bound proteins were washed three times with a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 200 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA and then eluted and used for gel electrophoresis. Binding studies with GST-dynamin and recombinant eNOS were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis, whereas binding studies with GST-dynamin and 35S-eNOS were examined by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography of dried gels. Quantification of autoradiographs was performed by densitometric analysis using Scion Image. Estimation of equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was performed by incubating a fixed concentration of GST-dynamin beads (5 nm) with purified recombinant eNOS (0–320 nm) premixed with proportionate volume of 35S-eNOS (0–16 μl) used as a radiolabel tracer (the protein concentration of the radiolabel tracer is negligible compared with the protein concentration of the recombinant protein). Bound radioactive counts were measured directly by scintillation counting. Quantitation of bound and free 35S-eNOS allowed for determination of bound and free recombinant eNOS.Kd was calculated by Scatchard plot analysis of bound and free levels of recombinant eNOS. NOS activity from recombinant eNOS protein and eNOS-GFP EVC 304 cell lysates was assessed by measuring the conversion of 3H-labeled l-arginine to3H-labeled l-citrulline in the presence and absence of l-nitroarginine methyl ester (l-NAME) as described previously (6Garcia-Cardena G.

GST-dynamin or, alternatively, GST alone was eluted from glutathione-Sepharose beads with reduced glutathione, and the eluted protein was incubated with 15 pmol of purified recombinant eNOS protein in molar ratios of 0:1, 0.5:1, 1:1, and 2:1 as described by Ju et al.

Cell lysates were prepared from eNOS-GFP ECV 304 cells cotransfected with 3 or 6 μg of dynamin-2 DNA using the buffer described above for Western blot and separated into 200-μg aliquots for NOS assay. To determine NOS activity, triplicate samples of recombinant proteins or duplicate samples of cell lysate were incubated with a buffer containing 1 mm NADPH, 3 μmtetrahydrobiopterin, 100 nm calmodulin, 2.5 mmCaCl2, 10 μm l-arginine andl-[3H]arginine (0.2 μCi) at 37 °C for 20 min in the presence and absence of 1 mm l-NAME. The reaction mix was terminated by the addition of 1 ml of cold stop buffer (20 mm Hepes, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA (pH 5.5)) and passed over a Dowex AG 50WX-8 resin column. Radiolabeled counts per min of generatedl-citrulline were measured and used to determinel-NAME inhibitable NOS activity. All data are given as mean ± S.E. Data were analyzed using paired and unpaired Student'st tests and one-way analysis of variance. Both eNOS and dynamin appear to reside within similar subcellular compartments based on previous studies examining subcellular localization of each of the proteins (2Garcia-Cardena G. Oh P. Liu J.

To determine whether eNOS and dynamin colocalize within cells, we performed confocal immunofluorescence microscopy in Clone 9 cells heterologously expressing eNOS and dynamin as well as in BAEC which express both proteins endogenously. As seen in Fig.1 A, in Clone 9 cells transiently transfected with eNOS and GFP-dynamin, NOS protein is detected predominantly in a perinuclear distribution. GFP-dynamin is also detected in a perinuclear distribution with additional fluorescent signal detected within distinct punctate areas within the cytoplasm and plasma membrane (Fig. 1 B). As seen in the merged image (Fig.1 C), there is colocalization of the two proteins in a perinuclear distribution. To examine the subcellular distribution and colocalization of endogenously expressed eNOS and dynamin, we next performed double labeling immunofluorescence microscopy in BAEC. In BAEC, eNOS is detected in a perinuclear pattern with some protein detected within distinct regions of plasma membrane (Fig.1 D). In Fig. 1 E, immunolocalization of dynamin in BAEC demonstrates a similar distribution of protein as observed in Clone 9 cells, and as observed in the merged image in Fig.1 F, colocalization of the two proteins in BAEC is observed in predominantly a perinuclear pattern (small arrow) as well as in specific domains of plasma membrane (large arrow). Next, we further examined the nature of this prominent perinuclear area of colocalization in BAEC by examining the colocalization of eNOS and alternatively dynamin, with the Golgi marker, Golgi 58-kDa protein. eNOS and Golgi 58-kDa protein (Fig. 1, G and H, respectively) are detected in a perinuclear distribution and colocalization of proteins is detected, indicating that pools of eNOS protein reside within Golgi membranes as previously noted (Fig.1 I, small arrow) (1Sessa W.C. Garcia-Cardena G. Liu J. Keh A. Pollock J.S. Bradley J. Thiru S. Braverman I.M. Desai K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17641-17644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 27Andries L. Brutsaert D. Sys S. Circ. Res. 1998; 82: 195-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Note that distinct pools of eNOS in plasma membrane do not colocalize with Golgi 58-kDa protein, demonstrating the specificity of Golgi 58-kDa protein mAb (Fig. 1 I, large arrow). Next we examined localization of dynamin (Fig. 1 J) and Golgi 58-kDa protein (Fig. 1 K) in BAEC. As seen in Fig. 1 L, pools of dynamin also colocalize with Golgi 58-kDa protein. No fluorescence was detected in negative control slides in which serum was substituted for the primary antibody or in cells incubated with secondary antibody alone (data not shown). These studies suggest that eNOS and dynamin colocalize predominantly within Golgi membranes of cells. Based on the prominent colocalization of eNOS and dynamin particularly within BAEC, we next examined whether the two proteins interact biochemically. For this purpose, detergent-soluble lysates were prepared from BAEC, and eNOS protein was immunoprecipitated under nondenaturing conditions. As seen in Fig. 2 A, immunoprecipitation of eNOS coimmunoprecipitates dynamin (lane labeled 0 mm NaCl). As seen in Fig. 2 B, immunoprecipitation of dynamin conversely coimmunoprecipitates eNOS from BAEC extracts (lane labeled0 mm NaCl). As observed in Fig. 2, Aand B, coprecipitation of eNOS and dynamin is maintained in the presence of an increase in the ionic strength of the wash buffer to 100 mm NaCl (lane labeled 100 mm NaCl). However, when beads are washed in the presence of 1 m NaCl, the interaction between the two proteins is markedly diminished suggesting an ionic strength protein-protein interaction (lane labeled 1m NaCl). We next examined the specificity of binding and pools of bound protein in cells, by substituting nonimmune sera for eNOS mAb during the immunoprecipitation and by comparing the pools of dynamin bound to eNOS with the total pool of dynamin in the lysate, respectively. As seen in Fig. 2C, ∼5% of the dynamin pool contained in the post-immunoprecipitation lysate (lane labeledpost IP that contains 20 μl from the 1 ml of lysate) is bound to eNOS (lane IP) as assessed by the similar dynamin Western blot signal intensity in these two lanes. (Similar results were obtained when the pre-IP lysate (not shown) was analyzed for dynamin in place of the post-IP lysate as the total pool of dynamin is not markedly reduced by eNOS immunoprecipitation.) Also, as seen in lane NIS, neither eNOS nor dynamin is detected when mouse IgG is substituted for eNOS mAb during the immunoprecipitation procedure. These studies indicate that fractions of eNOS and dynamin coexist in a complex within cells. To determine whether binding between eNOS and dynamin within cells is regulated by intracellular signals, we stimulated BAEC with the calcium ionophore, A23187 (10 μm), an agonist which promotes NO release (1Sessa W.C. Garcia-Cardena G. Liu J. Keh A. Pollock J.S. Bradley J. Thiru S. Braverman I.M. Desai K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17641-17644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Control cells were treated with vehicle. Detergent-soluble lysates were prepared, and eNOS protein was quantitatively immunoprecipitated. As seen in lanes labeled IP, from the representative blot (Fig. 3 A), eNOS immunoprecipitated from lysates of BAEC incubated with the ionophore coimmunoprecipitate markedly greater levels of dynamin as compared with equal amounts of eNOS immunoprecipitated from cells treated with vehicle (compare the intensity of the dynamin Western blot signal in lanes labeled IP under vehicle and A23187). As seen in the lanes labeled Post IP, after immunoprecipitation, eNOS is barely detected within 20 μl of the remaining supernatant, whereas the majority of the cellular pool of dynamin remains unbound to eNOS. In Fig. 3 B, when the series of experiments (n = 3) are examined as a group by densitometric analysis, a significant increase in dynamin bound to eNOS is detected after stimulation of cells with A23187 (* indicatesp < 0.05). Coprecipitation between eNOS and dynamin from cell lysates may occur directly or through an adapter protein. To determine whether eNOS and dynamin are able to bind directly, we next examined whether eNOS in solution binds to dynamin in the form of a GST fusion protein. Fig.4 A demonstrates the purity and specificity of the GST dynamin fusion protein. In the left panel, enrichment of a single 26-kDa protein eluted from GST beads, and the enrichment of a 130-kDa protein eluted from GST-dynamin beads is observed by Coomassie staining of an SDS-PAGE gel. Theright panel of Fig. 4 A demonstrates the specific Western blot signal for dynamin that is detected from purified GST-dynamin beads but not GST beads alone. To determine whether eNOS and dynamin bind directly in vitro and to quantify the relative pools of bound protein, we incubated GST dynamin beads or alternatively GST beads alone with increasing concentrations of purified recombinant eNOS protein in solution (60–300 nm). As seen in the representative Western blot in Fig. 4 B, left panel, specific binding of purified eNOS with GST dynamin is detected, whereas GST beads alone do not coprecipitate eNOS from solution. Additionally, at a 1:1 molar ratio of GST-dynamin to eNOS (lane labeled 150 nm eNOS in Fig. 4 B), a majority of the pool of available eNOS protein is bound to dynamin (compare lane labeled 150 nm eNOS to lane input,which represents the available eNOS protein in the 150 nmsample). Further increase in the available concentration of eNOS results in a smaller increase in eNOS binding (compare lanelabeled 300 nm eNOS to lane 150 nm cm;1 eNOS). These observations are quantified in Fig. 4 B, right panel, in which the"

We have therefore compared the signaling pathways for mIMCD-3 cell morphogenesis in response to EGF and HGF. Inhibition of the p42/44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway with the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MKK1) inhibitor PD98059 (50 μm) markedly inhibits HGF-induced cell migration with only partial inhibition of EGF-induced cell motility. Similarly, HGF-dependent, but not EGF-dependent, branching morphogenesis was more greatly inhibited by the MKK1 inhibitor. Examination of EGF-stimulated cells demonstrated that extracellular-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) was activated in response to EGF but not HGF, and that activation of ERK5 was only 60% inhibited by 50 μm PD98059. In contrast, the MKK inhibitor U0126 markedly inhibited both ERK1/2 and ERK5 activation and completely prevented HGF- and EGF-dependent migration and branching process formation. Expression of dominant negative ERK5 (dnBMK1) likewise inhibited EGF-dependent branching process formation, but did not affect HGF-dependent branching process formation. Our results indicate that activation of the ERK1/ERK2 signaling pathway is critical for HGF-induced cell motility/morphogenesis in mIMCD-3 cells, whereas ERK5 appears to be required for EGF-dependent morphogenesis.

Two cell types commonly utilized to examine renal epithelial morphogenesis are murine mIMCD-3 collecting duct cells and canine MDCK tubular cells. In mIMCD-3 cells, both the c-met receptor ligand hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)1 and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands, transforming growth factor-α and epidermal growth factor (EGF), are capable of mediating branching morphogenesis (1Barros E.J.

Physiol. 1996; 271: F1103-F1113Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, despite the presence of the EGFR in both cell types, only HGF is capable of mediating branching morphogenesis in MDCK cells, suggesting that these two receptors initiate morphogenesis utilizing similar, but not identical, signaling pathways. Upon activation, both the c-met receptor and the EGFR are tyrosine-phosphorylated and subsequently interact with GRB-2 and GAB1 (GRB-2-associated binding protein) (3Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M.

We have found that activation of the PI3K results in an increase in receptor-mediated activation of PLCγ and that these signaling pathways then mediate PKC activation as an important component of the cell migratory response (11Derman M.P.

However, the role of MAPK signaling in epithelial cell motility and tubulogenesis, independent of its role in cell proliferation, is not as well defined. Studies examining the importance of MAPK activation in cell motility in mammalian cells have had conflicting results. Some researchers conclude that cell motility involves only pathways independent of the MAPK cascade (13Nagamine K. Shibamoto S. Takeuchi K. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. Chatani Y. Kohno M. Ito F.

Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 615-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas other studies indicate that MAPK activity is required for cell motility (17Graf K. Xi X. Yang D. Fleck E. Hsueh W. Law R. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 334-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Groskopf J. Syu L. Saltiel A. Linzer D. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2835-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 19Herrera R. J.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 57-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This discrepancy may be due to differences in the cell types studied and/or growth factors utilized. For example, Anand-Apte et al. (21Anand-Apte B. Zetter B. Viswanathan A. Qiu R. Chen J. Ruggieri R. Symons M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30688-30692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) examined PDGF- and fibronectin-stimulated migration in fibroblasts and determined that they were differentially regulated by Rac and MAPK. Their results indicated that the fibronectin pathway requires ERK1/2 activity for cell motility but the PDGF pathway does not. They concluded that different receptor classes in response to different ligands differentially utilize Rac and ERK pathways in cell migration. There have been few studies to date examining the role of MAPK activation specifically in HGF- and/or EGF-dependent cell migration and tubulogenesis. One study of MAPK signaling in EGF-induced cell motility argues that MAPK activation may not be critical for this response in fibroblasts (22Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). These investigators found that two truncation mutants of the EGFR (lacking the tyrosine residues C-terminal to the kinase domain), which activate ERK1/2 do not support normal EGF-dependent cell migration, suggesting that activation of the MAPK pathway is not sufficient for cell migration. In a three-dimensional assay, Wang et al. (23Wang F. Weaver V.M. Petersen O.W. Larabell C.A. Dedhar S. Briand P. Lupu R. Bissell M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14821-14826Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar) found that T4-2 breast carcinoma cells expressing abnormally high levels of the EGFR had an exaggerated MAPK response to EGF associated with an overly proliferative, invasive morphology (23Wang F. Weaver V.M. Petersen O.W. Larabell C.A. Dedhar S. Briand P. Lupu R. Bissell M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14821-14826Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). This abnormal morphogenesis was completely suppressed by the MEK inhibitor PD98059. In contrast, Polk et al. (24Polk D.B. Tong W. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C1149-C1159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found no effect of MAPK inhibition on EGF-induced epithelial cell motility. An investigation of the role of MAPK signaling in HGF-stimulated MDCK cells recently demonstrated that the scattering response (a phenotype unique to HGF/c-met, which requires dissolution of existing cell-cell interactions followed by random cell migration) and tubulogenesis (a prolonged assay dependent on both cell morphogenesis and division) was prevented by the MEK inhibitor PD98059, suggesting that MAPK activation plays an important role in morphogenesis in these cells (25Khwaja A. Lehmann K. Marte B. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18793-18801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for these conflicting results is that activation of MAPK may be a ubiquitous requirement for cell morphogenesis, but that different growth factor receptors utilize different MAPK pathways. For example, it has been recently demonstrated that the EGFR utilizes ERK5 (also called Big MAPK (BMK1)) for mitogenic signaling rather than ERK1/2 (26Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In the present study, we utilized mIMCD-3 cells to compare signaling pathways downstream of the c-met and EGFR in cell migration and early branching morphogenesis assays. Both receptors were found to require activation of the PI3K and PLCγ for a normal motility response, whereas the c-met receptor appears to utilize the ERK1/2 signaling pathway during cell migration and branching morphogenesis and EGF-dependent cell morphogenesis is primarily dependent on ERK5 activation. Immortalized mIMCD-3 (27Rauchman M. Nigam S. Delpire E. Gullans S. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F416-F424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cells were grown in DMEM/F12 media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The response of these cells to HGF and EGF has been extensively studied in both cell migration assays and three-dimensional matrix assays (1Barros E.J. Santos O.F. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Nigam S.K.

Subconfluent mIMCD-3 cells were serum-starved for 24 h prior to stimulation with either HGF (40 ng/ml, Sigma) or EGF (20 ng/ml, Upstate Biotechnology Inc.) for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were then washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in ice-cold 0.5% Igepal lysis buffer (137 mm NaCl, 20 mm Trizma base, 1 mm MgCl, 1 mm CaCl, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Igepal CA-630, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 25 μg/ml antipain) and vortexed vigorously. Nonsolubilized debris was removed by microcentrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. In the MEK inhibitor experiments, the cells were preincubated with the appropriate concentration of PD98059 (Calbiochem) or U0126 (Promega) for 20 min prior to stimulation with growth factor. Protein content was determined using the Bio-Rad assay, and 40 μg of each supernatant was resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon (Millipore). Activated ERK1 and ERK2 were probed using the antibody to phospho-MAPK (New England BioLabs) at a 1:1000 dilution and a chemiluminescence detection system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). ERK5 was detected in mIMCD-3 cells by cell lysis as described above followed by immunoprecipitation with anti-ERK5 antibody (StressGen, Canada). To determine the phosphorylation state of ERK5, anti-ERK5 immunoprecipitates were resolved on 7.5% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with either the ERK5 antibody (to detect phosphorylation-dependent gel mobility retardation) or an antibody specific for MEK5-phosphorylated ERK5 (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA). For kinase assays of endogenous ERK5, near confluent mIMCD-3 cells were serum-starved for 48 h and then treated with or without stimuli (HGF, 40 ng/ml, or EGF, 20 ng/ml, for 10 min), in the presence or absence of 50 μm PD98059 or 20 μm UO126. Cells were then washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, collected in 500 μl of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 5 mm EGTA, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 25 mmsodium fluoride), vortexed, and incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Protein assay was performed on the supernatant, and 1 mg of protein was incubated with 40 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (VWR Scientific Products) and 3 μg of goat-anti ERK5 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 3 h at 4 °C. The immune complex was then washed twice with the lysis buffer followed by two washes in reaction buffer (20 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mm EGTA, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 25 mmsodium fluoride) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C with 20 μg of myelin basic protein (Sigma) in a buffer containing 20 mmTris-Cl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 μm ATP, and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The supernatant was separated by SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylation of MBP was analyzed via autoradiography. The bands were cut out of the membrane and counted in a scintillation counter to quantify the kinase activity. To compare values from separate experiments, counts from each experiments were normalized to their respective control. Cell migration assays were performed using a modified Boyden chamber assay as previously described (8Derman M.P. Cunha M.J. Barros E.J.G. Nigam S. Cantley L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F1211-F1217PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, a 48-well bottom plate (Neuro Probe, Cabin John, MD) was filled with DMEM/F12 media containing the appropriate growth factor. The well was overlaid with a rat tail collagen type I (Collaborative Biomedical)-coated polycarbonate filter with 8-μm pores (Nucleopore). The top compartment was connected, and 1.5 × 104cells suspended in DMEM/F12 were added to the top of each well. After 4 h of incubation at 37 °C, the filters were removed and stained with Diff-Quik (Baxter Healthcare), and the cells remaining on the top of the membrane mechanically were scraped off. Cells that had passed through the pores were counted to determine the number of cells/mm2 of membrane. Each well represents an nvalue of 1, and each experiment was repeated at least three separate times. p values were determined using an unpaired Student's t test. For experiments using signaling inhibitors, cells were trypsinized and counted as before, then separated into vehicle control and inhibitor aliquots. Cells were then rocked in suspension in the presence of the appropriate inhibitor for 10 min (50 μm PD98059, 20 μm U0126, 100 nm wortmannin (Sigma), or 1 μmU73122 (Calbiochem)) prior to loading on the collagen-coated membrane. Inhibitor at the appropriate concentration was also included in the bottom well of the migration assay. The inhibitor doses for wortmannin and U73122 were chosen based on our previous experience with these inhibitors in mIMCD-3 cells (9Derman M.P. Chen J.Y. Spokes K.C. Songyang Z. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4251-4255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). mIMCD-3 cells were trypsinized, and isolated cells were resuspended in type I collagen and cultured in the presence or absence of the desired growth factor as previously described (29Kjelsberg C. Sakurai H. Spokes K. Birchmeier C. Drummond I. Nigam S. Cantley L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F222-F228PubMed Google Scholar). After a 24-h period of incubation at 37 °C 30–40 single cells were scored for the number of branching tubular processes. Quantitation of branching process formation was performed by counting 40 random individual cells and dividing the number of branches by the total number of cells counted. Each well represents an nvalue of 1, and each experiment was repeated at least three separate times. pcDNA3 expression vectors (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) encoding for wild-type or dominant negative BMK1 (ERK5) were kindly provided by Dr. J. D. Lee. Dominant negative BMK1 contains a threonine to alanine substitution at position 218 and a tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation at position 220 in the MEK5 dual phosphorylation site (30Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). mIMCD-3 cells were transfected with 4 μg of the appropriate ERK5-expressing plasmid and 1 μg of pEGFP (CLONTECH) in 90-mm plastic dishes using LipofectAMINE Plus as previously described (29Kjelsberg C. Sakurai H. Spokes K. Birchmeier C. Drummond I. Nigam S. Cantley L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F222-F228PubMed Google Scholar). 24 h following transfection, cells were trypsinized and branching morphogenesis assays performed as described above. Cells transiently expressing the appropriate ERK5 construct or the empty pCDNA3 vector were detected and counted as described above using inverted fluorescence microscopy to identify only GFP-positive cells. The 60× confocal images shown in Fig. 5 A were acquired with a Bio-Rad MRC1024ES attached to a immunofluorescence microscope To determine whether HGF- and EGF-dependent morphogenesis required activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway, we utilized the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 in both cell migration and branching morphogenesis assays. A dose-response curve for inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was performed in the presence of either HGF or EGF stimulation (Fig. 1 A). At 50 μm, PD98059 inhibited HGF-induced phosphorylation of ERK2 by 100% (the small degree of basal ERK2 phosphorylation seen in these cells was inhibited as well) and EGF-induced ERK2 phosphorylation by 92%. This dose was then chosen for further experiments. In later experiments, the more potent MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 was utilized (31Favata M.F. Horiuchi K.Y. Manos E.J. Daulerio A.J. Stradley D.A. Feeser W.S. Van D.yk D.E. Pitts W.J. Earl R.A. Hobbs F. Copeland R.A. Magolda R.L. Scherle P.A. Trzaskos J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18623-18632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2754) Google Scholar). A similar dose-response curve demonstrated 100% inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation at a dose between 10 and 50 μm U0126 (Fig. 1 B). Based on this result, 20 μm U0126 was used in subsequent experiments. To examine the importance of ERK1/2 activation in the cell migratory response to HGF and EGF, a modified Boyden chamber assay was performed. Inhibition of the p42/44 ERK pathway with 50 μm PD98059 blocked HGF-induced cell migration by 75% (Fig.2 A) while causing only 37% inhibition of EGF-induced cell migration (control: 10.2 ± 1.3 cells/mm2; 50 μm PD98059: 20.2 ± 2.4; HGF: 114.9 ± 8.5; HGF + 50 μm PD98059: 36.0 ± 4.2; EGF: 228 ± 12.5; EGF + 50 μm PD98059: 145.7 ± 5). Of note, in different experiments, the inhibitory effect of PD98059 on EGF-dependent cell migration varied between 0 and 50% depending on the supplier. In prior studies, we and others have demonstrated that activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and phospholipase Cγ are required for PDGF-induced cell motility (8Derman M.P. Cunha M.J. Barros E.J.G. Nigam S. Cantley L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F1211-F1217PubMed Google Scholar, 9Derman M.P. Chen J.Y. Spokes K.C. Songyang Z. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4251-4255Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To determine whether these pathways were also differentially required in HGF- and EGF-dependent cell migration, we utilized the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin and the PLC inhibitor U73122. As compared with inhibition of MEK1, inhibition of phospholipase C equally inhibited HGF- and EGF-induced cell motility (control, 6.33 ± 0.84; U73122, 10.6 ± 3.3; HGF, 211.8; HGF + U73122, 13.5 ± 1.88; EGF, 180.4 ± 20.1; EGF + U73122, 9.67 ± 1.63)(Fig.2 B). Similarly, inhibition of the PI3K equally inhibited both HGF- and EGF-induced motility by ∼60% (control, 10.2 ± 1.3 cells/mm2; wortmannin, 9.17 ± 0.91; HGF, 309 ± 24; HGF + wortmannin, 127 ± 12.6; EGF, 327 ± 26.9; EGF + wortmannin, 128.7 ± 6.12) (Fig. 2 C). This partial inhibition of cell motility with wortmannin is comparable to that seen in PDGF-dependent migration (8Derman M.P. Cunha M.J. Barros E.J.G. Nigam S. Cantley L.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F1211-F1217PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that, although activation of the PI3K and PLCγ are equally important for HGF- and EGF-mediated cell migration, ERK1/2 activation appears to be differentially required for HGF- and EGF-dependent motility. The recent observation that activation of the EGFR results in activation of ERK5 and that ERK5 plays a critical role in EGF-dependent cell proliferation (26Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) led us to test whether EGF activates ERK5 in mIMCD-3 cells and whether this alternate MAPK member might be important in EGF-dependent cell migration. The activation of ERK5 occurs following MEK5 phosphorylation of ERK5 on both threonine and tyrosine, similar to that seen for MEK1 phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (30Kato Y. Kravchenko V.V. Tapping R.I. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7054-7066Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 32English J.M. Pearson G. Hockenberry T. Shivakumar L. White M.A. Cobb M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31588-31592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 33Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). To investigate the ability of either HGF and/or EGF to activate ERK5, we initially utilized a gel shift assay. We detected a marked gel shift of a fraction of the immunoprecipitated ERK5 following EGF but not HGF stimulation (Fig. 3 A). This reduced gel mobility is consistent with the classically described decrease in gel mobility of ERK1/2 following its threonine/tyrosine dual site phosphorylation by MEK1 and with the results of Katoet al. (26Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) examining ERK5 activation by EGF. With prolonged exposure of the immunoblot, we could observe a modest level of phosphorylated ERK5 detected in the HGF-stimulated cells (data not shown). The EGF-induced gel shift was not prevented by pretreatment with 50 μm PD98059 but was completely inhibited by the more potent MEK inhibitor U0126. We further investigated this differential activation of ERK5 by HGF and EGF using an antibody specific for the threonine-tyrosine dual phosphorylation site on ERK5 and detected phospho-ERK5 in mIMCD-3 lysates following EGF stimulation that was completely inhibited by U0126 and partially inhibited by PD98059 (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, HGF failed to stimulate ERK5 phosphorylation (Fig. 3 B). Examination of ERK5 kinase activity revealed a significant activation of ERK5 by EGF and not by HGF (Fig. 3 C). When the data from four kinase assays was quantified, we observed a 3-fold increase in ERK5 activation by EGF and no significant activation by HGF (Fig.3 D). EGF-induced activation was 62% inhibited by PD98059, whereas UO126 blocked EGF-dependent activation of ERK5 by 97%. As noted for the effects on cell migration, inhibition of ERK5 activation by PD98059 varied greatly in these assays. Thus, ERK1 and -2 were activated by both HGF and EGF, whereas only EGF significantly activates ERK5. Furthermore, U0126 markedly inhibits the activation of both MAPK signaling pathways, whereas PD98059, used at doses that completely inhibit ERK1/2 activation, is a less potent inhibitor of ERK5 activation in mIMCD-3 cells. We next examined HGF- and EGF-dependent cell migration using the U0126 compound to inhibit both ERK1/2 and ERK5 activation. As compared with the previously demonstrated 37% inhibition by PD98059, preincubation with U0126 inhibited EGF-dependent cell migration by 82% and HGF mediated cell migration by 97% (control, 2.82 ± 0.35; U0126, 2.80 ± 0.57; HGF, 30.65 ± 2.46; HGF + U0126, 3.78 ± 0.46; EGF, 54.06 ± 3.52; EGF + U0126, 11.94 ± 0.42) (Fig.4 A). These results suggest that EGF-dependent cell migration may be largely dependent on ERK5 activation. mIMCD3 cells grown in a three-dimensional collagen matrix in the presence of HGF or EGF/transforming growth factor-α exhibit elongated branching process formation as an early precursor to multicellular tubulogenesis (1Barros E.J. Santos O.F. Matsumoto K. Nakamura T. Nigam S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4412-4416Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 28Cantley L.G. Barros E.J.G. Gandhi M. Rauchman M. Nigam S.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: F271-F280PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if MAPK activation is necessary for this process, mIMCD3 cells were suspended in a type 1 collagen and treated with HGF or EGF in the presence of the MEK inhibitors PD98059 or U0126 and the number of processes/cell was then determined 24 h following matrix polymerization. Similar to the results observed with cell migration, HGF-induced branching process formation was inhibited 76% by the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059, whereas EGF receptor-induced morphogenesis was inhibited only 23% (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, U0126 entirely inhibited both HGF- and EGF-induced branching process formation (control, 0.72 ± 0.13 processes/cell; PD98059, 0.91 ± 0.08; U0126, 0.12 ± 0.14; HGF, 3.63 ± 0.25; HGF + PD98059, 1.41 ± 0.27; HGF + U0126, 0.25 ± 0.06; EGF, 2.59 ± 0.13; EGF + PD98059, 2.15 ± 0.49; EGF + U0126, 0.35 ± 0.05). Again, this result suggests that HGF-dependent morphogenesis is primarily dependent on ERK1/2 activation whereas EGF-induced branching process formation is ERK5-dependent. To more carefully examine the role of ERK5 in EGF-dependent morphogenesis, we transiently expressed dominant negative ERK5 (dnBMK1) in mIMCD-3 cells. Using cotransfection with enhanced GFP to specifically identify cells expressing dnBMK1, we compared the effects of expression of wild-type ERK5 and dominant negative ERK5 on HGF- and EGF-dependent branching process formation. Cotransfection with pCDNA3 + pEGFP was found to have no effect on either HGF- or EGF-induced branching process formation (Fig. 5 A, left panels). In contrast, expression of dominant negative ERK5 resulted in a marked decrease in EGF-induced process formation with no detectable change in HGF-dependent branching (Fig.5 A, right panels). Quantitation of cell processes using fluorescence microscopy was performed (Fig. 5 B) and confirmed that expression of dnBMK1 caused complete inhibition of EGF-induced process formation (control (pCDNA3 + pEGFP), 0.54 ± 0.05 processes/cell; wild-type ERK5 (pcDNA3-BMK1 + pEGFP), 0.66 ± 0.12; dominant negative ERK5 (pcDNA3-dnBMK1 + pEGFP), 0.48 ± 0.06; HGF, 1.80 ± 0.11; HGF + wild-type ERK5, 1.53 ± 0.04; HGF + dominant negative ERK5, 1.76 ± 0.12; EGF, 1.64 ± 0.13; EGF + wild-type ERK5, 1.56 ± 0.12; EGF + dominant negative ERK5, 0.42 ± 0.07). Thus, ERK5 appears to be critical for the EGF-dependent morphogenesis but plays little or no role in this response to HGF. There is a rapidly enlarging literature in regards to a role for MAPK activation in cell morphogenesis. In yeast, the MAPK pathway has been found to be critical for the morphogenic events necessary for hyphae formation and budding, specifically mediated by the G-protein-coupled Ste20/MEKK upstream activators of MEK and MAPK (34Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). In mammalian endothelial cells, proliferin can induce cell motility and angiogenesis (an event similar to epithelial tubulogenesis) via the G-protein-linked insulin-like growth factor-II receptor, and Groskopfet al. (18Groskopf J. Syu L. Saltiel A. Linzer D. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2835-2840Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) have found that proliferin-mediated chemotaxis is blocked by the MEK inhibitor PD98059. Similarly, Graf et al. (17Graf K. Xi X. Yang D. Fleck E. Hsueh W. Law R. Hypertension. 1997; 29: 334-339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that either inhibition of MEK with PD98059 or down-regulation of MAPK expression with antisense oligodeoxynucleotides resulted in a 70–80% inhibition of PDGF-mediated cell migration in vascular smooth muscle cells. It has been recently demonstrated that HGF-dependent tubulogenesis in MDCK cells (a 7- to 10-day assay of multicellular tubule formation requiring cell division) was inhibited by the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 (25Khwaja A. Lehmann K. Marte B. Downward J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18793-18801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Because cell proliferation requires MAPK activation, we chose to utilize a 4-h cell migration assay and a 24-h single cell branching morphogenesis assay to eliminate the role of cell division in this process and thereby specifically examine regulation of cell morphology. In the present study, we find that hepatocyte growth factor-dependent cell migration and branching process formation are blocked by PD98059, demonstrating that these morphogenic responses are dependent on activation of the MEK1 substrates ERK1 and/or ERK2. In contrast to the results observed with HGF, we found that EGF-dependent morphogenesis in mIMCD-3 cells was only modestly inhibited by doses of PD98059 that resulted in >90% inhibition of ERK1/2 activation. Thus it appears that the classical ERK1/2 MAPK pathway is critical for HGF- but not EGF-dependent cell migration and branching process formation. Of note, the dependence of EGF-induced cell migration on activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase and phospholipase C was nearly indistinguishable from that demonstrated for HGF. To determine a mechanism for the differential MAPK dependence, we tested the ability of HGF and EGF to activate the MEK5/ERK5 MAPK pathway that has been found to be critical for EGF-dependent mitogenesis (26Kato Y. Tapping R.I. Huang S. Watson M.H. Ulevitch R.J. Lee J.D. Nature. 1998; 395: 713-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). In mIMCD-3 cells, EGF was found to activate ERK5 kinase activity 3-fold, whereas HGF failed to activate ERK5. In work by Kamakura et al. (33Kamakura S. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26563-26571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar) using COS cells transfected with tagged ERK5, EGF activation of ERK5 was found to be fully inhibited by both PD98059 and U0126. In the present study examining the kinase activity of native ERK5 in mIMCD-3 cells, we found that concentrations of PD98059 that are sufficient to fully inhibit EGF-dependent ERK1/2 activation only inhibited ERK5 activation by 60%. In contrast, the alternate MEK inhibitor U0126 fully inhibited both pathways. The difference in our result as compared with the work by Kamakura and coworkers may be due to differences in cell type, differences in the native versus overexpressed protein, or differences in the PD98059 itself. It has been our experience that the apparent Ki for MEK varies with different lots of PD98059. Of note, in one series of experiments, ERK5 activation was more fully inhibited in our cells by ≥100 μm PD98059 (data not shown). Our observations, i.e. that EGF (but not HGF) activates ERK5 and that 50 μm PD98059 (which inhibits ERK1/2 activation fully but ERK5 activation by only 60%) inhibited HGF-dependent morphogenesis in a much greater fashion than EGF-dependent morphogenesis, suggested to us that EGF utilizes the MEK5/ERK5 MAPK pathway for initiation of morphogenesis. To test this possibility, we expressed dominant negative ERK5 in mIMCD-3 cells. In our experience, LipofectAMINE transfection of mIMCD-3 or MDCK cells typically results in ∼25–35% transfection efficiency. Therefore, to identify those cells that were expressing the dnBMK1 construct, we performed cotransfection with a plasmid expressing GFP, allowing us to quickly identify and count transfected cells based on fluorescence. By utilizing one-fourth of the amount of cDNA for GFP as compared with dnERK5, cells expressing GFP are expected to be cotransfected with the dnBMK1 construct. We found that, although expression of enhanced GFP (EGFP) with the pcDNA3 control vector or wild-type ERK5 had no effect on HGF- or EGF-dependent branching process formation, expression of dominant negative ERK5 in mIMCD-3 cells selectively prevented EGF-induced branching process formation without inhibiting HGF-mediated morphogenesis. Unfortunately, background fluorescence of the chemotaxis membrane prevented utilization of this approach for examination of cell migration assays. However, based on our results with U0126, we believe that both EGF-mediated cell migration and branching process formation in mIMCD-3 cells are ERK5-dependent. In fibroblasts, Slack et al. (35Slack J.K. Catling A.D. Eblen S.T. Weber M.J. Parsons J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27177-27184Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) have recently described that EGF-mediated migration was blocked by either PD98059 or U0126, suggesting that inhibition of ERK1/2 alone may be sufficient to prevent migration in these cells. Interestingly, examination of their results reveals that, although PD98059 inhibited their EGF-dependent cell migration index from 1.9 to 1.2, U0126 produced a 2-fold greater inhibition from 1.9 to 0.2, again consistent with a role for a non-ERK1/2 MAPK family member in EGF-dependent fibroblast migration. Their detection of significant inhibition of EGF-mediated fibroblast migration by the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 may reflect relative differences in the dependence of the EGFR on ERK1/2 versus ERK5 in fibroblasts as compared with epithelial cells or may reflect the ability of PD98059 to significantly inhibit ERK5 activation in their cells at the doses utilized. The requirement of these fairly rapid cell morphologic changes for ERK activation suggests that there may be ERK phosphorylation targets involved other than the classically described nuclear transcriptional regulatory proteins. We have recently found that, following HGF or EGF stimulation of mIMCD-3 cells, activated ERK1/2 associates with and phosphorylates the receptor docking protein GAB1 (36Roshan B. Kjelsberg C. Spokes K. Eldred A. Crovello C.S. Cantley L.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 36362-36368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This protein is of particular interest, because it has been found to associate with both the activated EGFR (4Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (603) Google Scholar) and c-met (3Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) and mediate signaling interactions with the PI3K, PLCγ, and SHPTP. Overexpression of either the GAB1 c-met receptor binding domain (3Weidner K.M. Di Cesare S. Sachs M. Brinkmann V. Behrens J. Birchmeier W. Nature. 1996; 384: 173-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar) or a truncated GAB1 construct missing the PH1 domain that mediates membrane localization (37Maroun C.R. Holgado-Madruga M. Royal I. Naujokas M.A. Fournier T.M. Wong A.J. Park M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1784-1799Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) results in a dominant negative phenotype for HGF-induced epithelial tubulogenesis. Thus, this docking protein appears to be a critical signaling intermediate in induction of the tubulogenic phenotype. Examination of the GAB1 sequence reveals multiple potential ERK phosphorylation sites (PX(S/T)P), including sites immediately adjacent to the potential SH2 interaction sites of the PI3K, suggesting that ERK phosphorylation of GAB1 might regulate the degree or duration of signaling activation following receptor stimulation. In addition, activated ERK may play a direct role in regulating the cellular machinery required for morphogenesis. For example, Xie et al. (16Xie H. Pallero M.A. Gupta K. Chang P. Ware M.F. Witke W. Kwiatkowski D.J. Lauffenburger D.A. Murphy-Ullrich J.E. Wells A. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 615-624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) found that EGF-mediated disassembly of focal adhesions was dependent on ERK activation and Klemke et al. (38Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A.L. Gallagher P.J. de Lanerolle P. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar) have found that activated ERK can associate with and phosphorylate myosin light chain kinase, thereby increasing its kinase activity and enhancing cell migration. More recently, Chen et al. (39Chen Y. Lu Q. Schneeberger E.E. Goodenough D.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 849-862Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) have found that the assembly of the tight junctional proteins claudin-1 and ZO-1 was regulated by MAPK activation. Whether ERK5 can mediate these functions downstream of EGFR activation remains to be explored. In conclusion, HGF-mediated cell migration and branching process formation requires the coordinate activation of the PI3K, PLCγ, and ERK1/2. Although EGF-dependent morphogenesis appears to have similar requirements for PI3K and PLCγ activation, this receptor pathway utilizes the alternative MEK5/ERK5 MAPK pathway for cell morphogenesis. This differential signaling in growth factor-induced morphogenesis may help to further explain how cell types expressing identical growth factor receptors can demonstrate divergent morphogenic responses.

https://openalex.org/W2016388851,"We identified the rat Sam68-like mammalian protein (rSLM-2), a member of the STAR (signal transduction and activation of RNA) protein family as a novel splicing regulatory protein. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, coimmunoprecipitations, and pull-down assays, we demonstrate that rSLM-2 interacts with various proteins involved in the regulation of alternative splicing, among them the serine/arginine-rich protein SRp30c, the splicing-associated factor YT521-B and the scaffold attachment factor B. rSLM-2 can influence the splicing pattern of the CD44v5, human transformer-2β and tau minigenes in cotransfection experiments. This effect can be reversed by rSLM-2-interacting proteins. Employing rSLM-2 deletion variants, gel mobility shift assays, and linker scan mutations of the CD44 minigene, we show that the rSLM-2-dependent inclusion of exon v5 of the CD44 pre-mRNA is dependent on a short purine-rich sequence. Because the related protein of rSLM-2, Sam68, is believed to play a role as an adapter protein during signal transduction, we postulate that rSLM-2 is a link between signal transduction pathways and pre-mRNA processing."

These structures confirmed that the enzyme is organized in the following two separate domains as proposed previously (4Gehring A.M. Lees W.J. Mindiola D.J. Walsh C.T. Brown E.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 5Mengin-Lecreulx D. van Heijenoort J. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5788-5795Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar): (i) an N-terminal uridyltransferase (PPase) domain, comprising Asn-3 to Arg-227, resembling the dinucleotide binding Rossmann fold, first reported in the lactate dehydrogenase family (6Rossmann M.G. Liljas A. Branden C.-I. Bansazak L.J. Boyer P.D. The Enzymes. Academic Press, New York1975: 61-102Google Scholar), and containing the signature motif G-X-G-T-(R/S)-(X)4-P-K, found in the majority of pyrophosphorylases, and (ii) a C-terminal acetyltransferase domain, containing the hexapeptide repeat (L/I/V)-(G/A/E/D)-X 2-(S/T/A/V)-X, a signature of the unusual left-handed β-helix (LβH) structural motif, typically found in other bacterial acetyl- and acyltransferases (7Vuorio R. Hirvas L. Vaara M. FEBS Lett. 1991; 292: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). Furthermore, the GlmU-Tr·UDP-GlcNAc complex structure identified the precise location of the uridyltransfer reaction, the pyrophosphorylase activity of GlmU-Tr being retained. However, acetyltransferase activity was lost because of spontaneous truncation during purification, confirming that the bifunctional enzyme possesses indeed two distinct active sites located in separate domains, with the acetyltransferase activity residing in the C-terminal portion of the enzyme (4Gehring A.M. Lees W.J. Mindiola D.J. Walsh C.T. Brown E.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although the crystal structure of the E. coli enzyme, coupled to mutagenesis studies, has revealed some residues crucial for pyrophosphorylase activity (3Brown K. Pompeo F. Dixon S. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4096-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar), the catalytic machineries responsible for both pyrophosphorylase and acetyltransferase activity remain to be elucidated. Here we present the crystal structures of full-length GlmU from the pathogenic organism Streptococcus pneumoniae in its unbound form and in complex with AcCoA and both AcCoA and the product UDP-GlcNAc. These structures define the precise location of the acetyltransferase active site, reveal substantial conformational changes occurring both upon AcCoA and UPD-GlcNAc binding, and highlight the structural elements responsible for substrate recognition and catalysis in the two distinct active sites of this bifunctional enzyme. The coding region of SpGlmU was amplified from S. pneumoniae strain R 800 DNA by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into the bacterial expression plasmid PQE30 (Qiagen). Recombinant SpGlmU was overexpressed in M15 cells and purified to homogeneity by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose and gel filtration chromatography. Enzyme activity has been tested and found similar to that of full-length E. coli GlmU (3Brown K. Pompeo F. Dixon S. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4096-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Crystals were grown at 20 °C by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method by mixing equal volumes of protein solution (13 mg/ml) with reservoir solution composed of 26% (v/v) PEG 400, 50 mm NaCl, and 300 mmCaCl2 at pH 8.0 by TRIS-HCl. Small rhombohedral crystals with a typical size of 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.1 mm appeared within 1 week. Crystals belong to space group R3 and contain two molecules per asymmetric unit. As molecular replacement with GlmU-Tr (Protein Data Bank entry 1FXJ) failed, selenomethionine-substituted enzyme was produced using the same bacterial strain grown in minimum medium and supplemented, before induction, with selenomethionine and amino acids known to inhibit methionine biosynthesis (8Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar). The yield of selenomethionine substitution was about 50% as judged by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectroscopy analysis. Crystals of bigger dimensions and higher diffraction quality were obtained for the selenomethionine-substituted enzyme under the same crystallization conditions as adopted for the native protein. Crystals for the AcCoA complex were obtained by incubating the enzyme with 20 mm AcCoA prior to crystallization and lowering the PEG 400 concentration to 18% (v/v). AcCoA·UDP-GlcNAc complex crystals were obtained by cocrystallization with 20 mm AcCoA followed by harvesting into a stabilizing solution made of 30% (v/v) PEG 400, 50 mm NaCl, 300 mm CaCl2 at pH 8.0 by TRIS-HCl and supplemented with 10 mm UDP-GlcNAc. All data sets were collected at 100 K on flash-frozen crystals. Cryosolutions were of the same composition as the crystallization/harvesting solutions with the addition of an increasing amount of PEG 400 and supplemented with 5% (v/v) glycerol. A 3-wavelength multiple anomalous dispersion data set for selenomethionine-substituted SpGlmU was collected on beamline BM14 (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France), a data set for native SpGlmU and data for the AcCoA complex were collected on beamlines ID14-EH2, and data for the AcCoA·UDP-GlcNAc complex were collected on beamline ID14-EH3 (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility, Grenoble, France). Data were indexed and integrated with DENZO (9Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter J.C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar), and all further computing was carried out with the CCP4 program suite (10CCP4 Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab The SpGlmU structure was solved using the program SOLVE (11Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). The initial multiple anomalous dispersion phases had a mean figure of merit of 0.340- to 2.8-Å resolution and were improved by density modification with the program DM (12Cowtan K. Joint CCP4 and ESF-EACMB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1994; 31: 34-38Google Scholar) and extended to the resolution of the native data set (2.3 Å). Because of the low yield of selenomethionine incorporation only a few of these residues could be located in the experimental electron density maps, which were of mediocre quality. Non-crystallography symmetry averaging and phase combination techniques were of great help in overcoming these problems, and a preliminary model could be constructed for most of the LβH domain and the core of the N-terminal PPase domain using the program TURBO-FRODO (13Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics Corp., Mountain View, CA1991: 81Google Scholar). However, most of the loop regions, some of the α-helixes in the N-terminal domain, and the last 25 C-terminal residues turned out to be extremely disordered, if visible at all. A striking improvement of the map quality was observed for the AcCoA complex. A continuous model could be built comprising residues Ser-2–Gln-459. A crystal lattice rearrangement occurred upon soaking of AcCoA complex crystals in the solution containing UDP-GlcNAc, and the structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program AMoRe (14Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5030) Google Scholar). Refinement was carried out with the programs REFMAC (15Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr.

Automated correction of the model and solvent building were performed with the program ARP/wARP (17Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct.

The apo-SpGlmU, SpGlmU-AcCoA, and SpGlmU-AcCoA·UDP-GlcNAc structures were refined to 2.3, 2.5, and 1.75 Å, respectively, and have good stereochemistry. The apo-SpGlmU structure consists of residues Ser-2 to Val-142 and Val-149 to Glu-447. The surface loop Arg-143–Glu-148, located in the pyrophosphorylase domain, and the last 12 residues of the acetyltransferase domain, Tyr-448–Gln-459, could not be built because of lack of electron density. The two complex structures, SpGlmU·AcCoA· and SpGlmU·AcCoA·UDP-GlcNAc, consist of residue Ser-2 to Gln-459, and clear unbiased electron density could be observed for both AcCoA and UDP-GlcNAc prior to the incorporation in the refinement (Fig. 2 a). The SpGlmU molecule assembles into a trimeric arrangement with overall dimensions of 89 × 85 × 90 Å (Fig. 2 b). The LβH domains (Val-252–Ile-437) are tightly packed against each other in a parallel fashion, an α-helical linker (Arg-229–Met-248) sits on top of each β-helix and projects the globular pyrophosphorylase domain (Ser-2–Asn-227) far away from the trimer interface. The SpGlmU apo-structure, except for the two missing regions Arg-143–Glu-148 and Tyr-448–Gln-459, is highly similar to the SpGlmU·AcCoA complex structure, with a root mean square deviation of 0.450 Å for 440 Cα positions (Fig. 2 c). The SpGlmU-AcCoA complex structure, in turn, is almost identical to the SpGlmU·AcCoA·UDP-GlcNAc complex structure in the acetyltransferase domain (root mean square deviation of 0.17 Å for 208 Cα positions). However, the two complex structures differ greatly in the pyrophosphorylase domain, as discussed further below. The SpGlmU overall fold for residues Ser-2 to His-330 is similar to theE. coli-truncated enzyme (3Brown K. Pompeo F. Dixon S. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4096-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, the relative arrangement of the pyrophosphorylase and the acetyltransferase domain differs between the crystal structures of SpGlmU and E. coliGlmU-Tr (Fig. 3 a). Indeed, the two GlmU structures present a 20° deviation in the direction of the α-helical linker, indicating that this is, in fact, a flexible hinge. A direct consequence of this deviation are major differences between GlmU-Tr and SpGlmU occurring in the regions of the pyrophosphorylase domain neighboring the N-cap of the α-helical linker. These conformational changes, together with a high overall mobility of the pyrophosphorylase domain, as opposed to the acetyltransferase domain, suggest that the presented structures may represent only snapshots of a highly dynamic system. The SpGlmU PPase domain can be divided into two lobes separated by the active site pocket. The first hundred residues, containing the consensus sequence motif G-X-G-T-(RS)-(X)4-P-K, form the nucleotide binding lobe, whereas the second lobe, responsible for recognition of the sugar moiety, encompasses the remaining residues of the N-terminal domain (Fig. 3 B). Striking differences exist between the PPase domains of apo-SpGlmU and the SpGlmU·AcCoA·UDP-GlcNAc complex (root mean square deviation of 2.2 Å for 226 Cα atoms), indicating that the enzyme undergoes a substantial conformational change upon substrate/product binding. In the absence of UDP-GlcNAc (apo-SpGlmU and SpGlmU·AcCoA), SpGlmU adopts an open conformation, whereas in the UDP-GlcNAc complex two regions within the sugar binding lobe move toward each other giving rise to a closed conformation (Fig. 3 B). Upon product binding the entire region encompassing residues Thr-132–Lys-166 moves as a rigid body, making a 20° tilt resulting in a 7-Å movement of the β5b-β6 surface loop. The melting of the last turn of the α-helix α5, facing the β5b-β6 loop, transforms the following α5-α6 surface loop (Asn-191–Tyr-197) into an extended thumb-shaped hairpin. These movements bring the two above surface loops close to each other, such that in the UDP-GlcNAc complex the Ala-192 N hydrogen bonds Asp-157 OD1 (Fig. 3 b), whereas in the unbound form these two residues are 14 Å apart. This suggests that the two surface loops function like a pair of tongs, closing up upon substrate binding and anchoring the sugar deep into the active site pocket thereby shielding it from solvent. The “breathing” of the PPase domain of SpGlmU could not be observed for the E. coli GlmU-Tr enzyme, where the crystal structures reveal a closed conformation for both the apo- and UDP-GlcNAc complexed forms (3Brown K. Pompeo F. Dixon S. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4096-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, analysis of the crystal packing in the E. coli GlmU-Tr structures reveals that the pyrophosphorylase domain is constrained into its closed conformation in both the apo-form and the GlmU-Tr·UDP-GlcNAc complex by the packing environment, whereas no such constraints exist in apo- or complexed SpGlmU crystals. The interactions of the enzyme with the nucleotide and the sugar are largely conserved within the complex crystal structures from S. pneumoniae and E. coli GlmU, yet significant differences reside in the surroundings of the pyrophosphate moiety. Whereas in the GlmU-Tr·UDP-GlcNAc complex both phosphates are solvent-exposed, in the SpGlmU·AcCoA·UDP-GlcNAc complex the α-phosphate is stabilized through weak hydrogen bonds to the side chains of sequence-conserved Arg-15 and Lys-22, located within the signature motif. Moreover, both phosphate groups interact through a calcium ion with Asp-102 and Asn-227, situated in the β4-α4 hairpin and in the N-cap of the long α-helical linker, respectively (Fig.3 c). This calcium ion exhibits the octahedral coordination geometry characteristic of Mg2+ ions and thus mimics the catalytically important Mg2+ ion. Arg-15 presents static disorder, with the conformation of minor occupancy contacting the β-phosphate (Fig. 3 B). This disorder, together with the weak hydrogen bond to Lys-22, indicates that instead of stabilizing the product Arg-15 and Lys-22 must have a role either in substrate recognition or transition-state stabilization during the single displacement reaction (22Sheu K.F. Frey P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 3378-3780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with mutagenesis data of theE. coli GlmU enzyme (3Brown K. Pompeo F. Dixon S. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4096-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Surprisingly in the crystal structure of the E. coliGlmU-Tr·UDP-GlcNAc complex the functional residues Arg-18, Lys-25, Asp-105, and Asn-227 are located far away from the pyrophosphate group. These residues are carried by three structural elements in intimate contact with each other, with the α-helical arm, and with the acetyltransferase domain of a neighboring subunit. As mentioned above, the E. coli GlmU-Tr structures differ from the SpGlmU structures in the relative arrangement of the acetyltransferase and pyrophosphorylase domains, probably because of enzyme truncation. Consequently in E. coli GlmU-Tr, the α-helical arm pushes the signature motif Gly-14–Lys-25 away from the substrate binding pocket of the pyrophosphorylase domain, which might explain the 2-fold reduction in the k cat value of E. coli GlmU-Tr, as compared with the wild-type enzyme (3Brown K. Pompeo F. Dixon S. Mengin-Lecreulx D. Cambillau C. Bourne Y. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4096-4107Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The C-terminal acetyltransferase LβH domain resembles an equilateral prism, with the three sides formed by three parallel β-sheets composed of short β-strands (Fig.2 B). The 50-Å long β-helix of full-length SpGlmU consists of 10 regular coils, whereas the E. coli GlmU-Tr structure is truncated after the fourth coil. The buried surface area to a 1.6-Å probe radius of a SpGlmU subunit upon trimer formation is 4690 Å2, a value in the highest range when compared with other homologous trimeric LβH structures. The regularity of the prism is interrupted only at the seventh coil by a single insertion loop, encompassing the sequence-conserved region Asn-385 to Lys-393, which projects from one of the vertices of the prism and flanks an adjacent subunit (Fig. 2 B). The dominant and striking feature of the SpGlmU trimeric assembly is the domain exchange of the C-terminal region. Although this is a novel feature within the family of bacterial acetyltransferases, such a domain exchange has been reported for a number of proteins and is referred to as three-dimensional domain swapping (23Schlunegger M.P. Bennett M.J. Eisenberg D. Adv. Protein Chem. 1997; 50: 61-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After 10 1/3 complete turns the peptide chain is exchanged with an adjacent subunit, thus forming the unique antiparallel β-strand of an additional coil within the LβH domain. Therefore, together with the α-helical linker sitting on top of the LβH domain, the C-terminal domain exchange contributes to the stabilization of the SpGlmU trimeric assembly. At residue Glu-447 the anti-parallel β-strand reaches the vertex of the prism of a neighboring subunit. At this point the polypeptide chain inserts between two neighboring subunits and coils backwards in the direction of the N terminus, forming two successive 310-helices and ending in intimate contact with the insertion loop Asn-385–Lys-393 of an adjacent subunit. An 8-Å long and very narrow tunnel is formed in this way, enclosing bound AcCoA located at the interface of two subunits, and closed from the outside by the exchanged C-terminal arm of the third subunit and the insertion loop Asn-385–Lys-393 (Fig.4 A), revealing that the trimeric assembly is required for the acetyltransferase activity. To our knowledge, such an active site architecture located at the junction of three subunits is novel and exemplifies how an oligomeric assembly, coupled to a domain exchange, can create a specific binding site. The C-terminal region past residue Glu-447 could not be observed in the apo-structure, suggesting that this region is highly flexible and becomes only structured upon AcCoA binding. No other major structural rearrangements occur upon AcCoA binding in the acetyltransferase domain, except maybe for the insertion loop Asn-385–Lys-393, which is highly disordered in the apo-structure, as indicated by a main chain average B-factor of 74 Å2 as compared with an average main chain B-factor of 35 Å2 for the rest of the acetyltransferase domain. Major stabilization of the AcCoA cofactor is ensured by stacking of the adenine group between the side chains of Ile-437 and Arg-441, hydrogen bonds from the 3′-phosphate group to Lys-445 NZ and Tyr-448 OH, and electrostatic interactions with Arg-439. Additional stabilization arises from hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bonds from the β-mercaptoethylamine moiety to main-chain atoms of Asn-385, Ser-404, and Ala-422. The pyrophosphate is exposed to the solvent and does not interact with the protein. Structural comparison of the SpGlmU·AcCoA complex with other related bacterial acetyltransferases reveals a common location of the AcCoA binding site. Indeed, AcCoA adopts a conformation very similar to the fishhook-like conformation observed for CoA in the tetrahydrodipicolinate N-succinyltransferase (24Beaman T.W. Blanchard J.S. Roderick S.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10363-10369Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), bent at the pyrophosphate group and with an extended pantetheine arm running parallel to the LβH domain (Fig. 4 A). Although the C-terminal domain exchange, from which the AcCoA binding site emerges, is novel and dissimilar to other related bacterial acetyltransferases, structuring of the C-terminal portion upon CoA binding has been previously reported for tetrahydrodipicolinateN-succinyltransferase (24Beaman T.W. Blanchard J.S. Roderick S.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10363-10369Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Acetyltransferases utilizing AcCoA as substrate donor transfer the acetyl group, loosely bound through the weak thioester linkage, either to a cysteine residue, forming a covalent acetyl-enzyme intermediate, or directly to the substrate (25Cheon H.G. Hanna P.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1992; 43: 2255-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar,26De Angelis J. Gastel J. Klein D.C. Cole P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3045-3050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). In the light of the first of these two mechanisms, the role of the four cysteine residues in the E. coli enzyme was investigated by site-directed mutagenesis studies (27Pompeo F. van Heijenoort J. Mengin-Lecreulx D. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4799-4803Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, none of the cysteine residues are conserved between known GlmU sequences, and acetyltransferase activity was dramatically decreased only by the Ala mutant of Cys-307, which is disulfide-bridged and points toward the interior of the LβH domain in the E. coli GlmU-Tr structure. SpGlmU contains only one single cysteine residue, Cys-369, located 10 Å apart from the active site, excluding thus the hypothesis of a covalent acetyl-cysteine enzyme intermediate. Inspection of the SpGlmU active site points rather toward a direct acetyl group transfer, based on a catalytic triad formed by the conserved residues His-362, Glu-348, and Ser-404 (Fig. 4 B). His-362 is the only residue located in close proximity of the thioester, which may function as a general base catalyst, activating the C-2 amine of glucosamine-1-P for nucleophilic attack. Hydrogen bonding of His-362 ND1 to Glu-348 OE1 ensures the proper tautomeric form of the imidazole, lacking one proton on NE2. Ser-404, located behind the thioester, is well positioned to stabilize, together with the main-chain nitrogen atom of Ala-379, the negative charge building up on the thioester carbonyl at the transition state. The sequence-conserved Asn-385 residue, within hydrogen bond distance to the sulfur, could have a role in proton transfer at the end of the catalytic cycle. The importance of His-362 is highlighted by a superimposition of SpGlmU with the crystal structure of tetrahydrodipicolinate N-succinyltransferase, which positions SpGlmU His-362 similarly to tetrahydrodipicolinateN-succinyltransferase Asp-141, a residue proposed to function as the general base (24Beaman T.W. Blanchard J.S. Roderick S.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 10363-10369Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A histidine, His-79, has been suggested to function as the general base, as well, in the related hexapeptide xenobiotic acetyltransferase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (28Beaman T.W. Sugantino M. Roderick S.L. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 6689-6696Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In absence of a complex with GlcN-1-P, we have modeled GlcN-1-P into the small pocket containing the catalytic triad and surrounded by bulky side chains protruding from two neighboring subunits and the insertion loop Asn-385–Lys-393. The orientation of GlcN-1-P is constrained by a cluster of sequence-conserved electropositive residues (Arg-332, Lys-350, and Lys-391), candidates for binding the C-1 phosphate group, a hypothesis supported by earlier kinetic studies showing that GlcN is a very poor substrate compared with GlcN-1-P for the acetyltransfer reaction (4Gehring A.M. Lees W.J. Mindiola D.J. Walsh C.T. Brown E.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In our model the acceptor amino group on C-2 is within hydrogen binding distance from the proposed catalytic base (NE2 of His-362) and ideally poised to make a nucleophilic attack on the thioester (Fig. 4 B). The three crystal structures of SpGlmU in unbound and complexed form described in this paper highlight novel structural features necessary to achieve the acetyltransferase reaction and define a structural template to design new antibiotics. A detailed dissection of the two distinct GlmU catalytic mechanisms must await further crystallographic investigations of substrate and inhibitor complexes.

To characterize the oligomeric forms of the renal brush border Na+-H+ exchanger in more detail, we performed membrane fractionation studies. We found that similar amounts of NHE3 were present in microvilli and a nonmicrovillar membrane domain of high density (dense vesicles). Horseradish peroxidase-labeled endosomes were not prevalent in the dense membrane fraction. However, megalin, which localizes primarily to the intermicrovillar microdomain of the brush border, was enriched in the dense vesicles, implicating this microdomain as the likely source of these membranes. Immunolocalization of NHE3 confirmed that a major fraction of the transporter colocalized with megalin in the intermicrovillar region of the brush border. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that in microvilli the majority of NHE3 was not bound to megalin, while in the dense vesicles most of the NHE3 coprecipitated with megalin. Moreover, sucrose velocity gradient centrifugation experiments revealed that most NHE3 in microvilli sedimented with an S value of 9.6, while the S value of NHE3 in dense vesicles was 21. Finally, we examined the functional state of NHE3 in both membrane fractions. As assayed by changes in acridine orange fluorescence, imposing an outwardly directed Na+ gradient caused generation of an inside acid pH gradient in the microvilli, indicating Na+-H+exchange activity, but not in the dense vesicles. Taken together, these data demonstrate that renal brush border NHE3 exists in two oligomeric states: a 9.6 S active form present in microvilli and a 21 S, megalin-associated, inactive form in the intermicrovillar microdomain of the apical plasma membrane. Thus, regulation of renal brush border Na+-H+ exchange activity may be mediated by shifting the distribution between these forms of NHE3.

Several laboratories have presented evidence suggesting that NHE3 is regulated by posttranslational mechanisms that may include membrane trafficking between an intracellular compartment and the plasma membrane (7Block R.D.

Such models predict that NHE3 must be localized in a nonmicrovillar membrane compartment, which functions as a store of transporter, as well as on the microvillar membrane where NHE3 is active.We have recently reported an association between NHE3 and the putative scavenger receptor megalin in renal brush border membranes (1Biemesderfer D. Nagy T. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17518-17524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Moreover, we found that renal brush border NHE3 exists in two states with distinct sedimentation coefficients, a 9.6 S megalin-free form and a 21 S megalin-bound form (1Biemesderfer D. Nagy T. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17518-17524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The purpose of the present study was to use membrane fractionation methods to determine whether these two oligomeric forms of NHE3 are expressed in distinct microdomains of the renal brush border and, if so, to compare the functional activity of NHE3 in these microdomains. Our findings are consistent with a model in which the 9.6 S form of NHE3 is present in the microvillar membrane and is active, whereas the 21 S megalin-associated form is concentrated in the intermicrovillar microdomain of the brush border and is inactive. Thus, regulation of renal brush border Na+-H+exchange activity may be mediated by shifting the distribution between these forms of NHE3.DISCUSSIONThis study describes the localization of two oligomeric forms of NHE3 to distinct microdomains of the renal brush border. Using density centrifugation combined with specific brush border antibodies, we have shown that a 9.6 S oligomer of NHE3 is predominately expressed on microvilli, while a 21 S, megalin-associated form is concentrated in the intermicrovillar region of the brush border. As shown by Rodmanet al. (32Rodman J.S. Seidman L. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), this is a distinct microdomain of the apical plasma membrane of the proximal tubule. In addition, transport studies indicate that NHE3 is active in microvilli but inactive in intermicrovillar membranes.The mAb to NHE3 (2B9) that was used in this study is specific to a region within the C terminus of the transporter that lies between amino acids 702 and 756 (10Biemesderfer D. Rutherford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A.K. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F289-F299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This region of NHE3 is blocked from antibody binding when the transporter is complexed with megalin (1Biemesderfer D. Nagy T. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17518-17524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The fact that epitopes within the C-terminal region of NHE3 are blocked when NHE3 is complexed with megalin raises questions regarding the interpretation of previous immunocytochemical studies using antibodies made to the C terminus of NHE3.

Nephrol. 1999; 10: 935-942PubMed Google Scholar) of these studies localized NHE3 largely to the microvillar membrane. In fact, when used for immunoelectron microscopy, our mAbs failed to label the intermicrovillar microdomain of the renal brush border (10Biemesderfer D. Rutherford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A.K. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F289-F299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the apparent discrepancy between previous immunocytochemical studies and the present membrane fractionation study, showing large amounts of NHE3 in intermicrovillar membranes, may have resulted from the masking of C-terminal epitopes on NHE3 when the transporter is complexed with megalin. Our present immunocytochemical studies using antigen retrieval show this to be the case. When kidney sections were denatured during the antigen retrieval procedure, we visualized a large pool of NHE3 that colocalized with megalin in the intermicrovillar region of the brush border, consistent with our membrane fractionation data showing a major pool of NHE3 in megalin-rich, nonmicrovillar (and nonendosomal) dense membranes. Immunocytochemical localization of this pool of NHE3 was not an artifact of the antigen retrieval procedure, since similar staining was found without antigen retrieval by use of a polyclonal anti-NHE3 antibody raised to a peptide encompassing the C-terminal 22 amino acids of NHE3 (12Kim G.-H. Ecelbarger C. Knepper M.A. Packer R.K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 935-942PubMed Google Scholar).Previous studies have localized Na+/H+ exchange activity (35Sabolic I. Brown D. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 258: F1245-F1253PubMed Google Scholar) and NHE3 protein (10Biemesderfer D. Rutherford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A.K. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F289-F299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) within endosomes in the proximal tubule. In contrast, the data presented here indicate that the membranes enriched in the NHE3-megalin complex are derived from the intermicrovillar region of the brush border (apical plasma membrane) and not from an endosomal compartment. Since the present study did not directly examine the NHE3 protein present in endosomes, the relationship between endosomal NHE3 and that found in the intermicrovillar microdomain of the brush border remains unclear. However, because the NHE3 antibodies that we used in a previous study to detect NHE3 in endosomes (10Biemesderfer D. Rutherford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A.K. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F289-F299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) do not react with the NHE3-megalin complex (1Biemesderfer D. Nagy T. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17518-17524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), it seems likely that endosomal staining with these mAbs was due to the presence of the 9.6 S form of NHE3 in the endosomes and not the NHE3-megalin complex.Our finding that the 21 S megalin-associated form of NHE3 concentrated in the intermicrovillar membrane is inactive raises the possibility that association with megalin may play a role in regulating NHE3 activity in response to physiological stimuli. For example, it is possible that the association of NHE3 with megalin causes inactivation of transport activity. However, it is known that phosphorylation of NHE3 by protein kinase A causes inhibition of NHE3 activity (36Kurashima K., Yu, F.H. Cabado A.G. Szabo E.Z. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28672-28679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 37Cabado A.G., Yu, F.H. Kapus A. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3590-3599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It is possible that phosphorylation of NHE3 causes both its inactivation and its association with megalin. In addition, endocytosis of NHE3 in response to protein kinase A-induced phosphorylation has been described in cultured cell models (38Chow C.W. Khurana S. Woodside M. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37551-37558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 39Fan L. Wederkehr M.R. Collazo R. Wang H. Crowder L.A. Moe O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11289-11295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It is therefore also possible that phosphorylation of NHE3 leads to association with megalin and sequestration in the coated pits as a prelude to endocytosis in proximal tubule cells.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that renal brush border NHE3 exists in two oligomeric states: a 9.6 S active form present in microvilli and a 21 S, megalin-associated, inactive form in the intermicrovillar microdomain. Future studies will be needed to examine whether regulation of renal brush border Na+-H+exchange activity may be mediated by shifting the distribution between these forms of NHE3. In the kidney, the activity of the Na+-H+exchanger isoform NHE3, located on the apical microvillar membrane of the proximal tubule, plays a major role in mediating transepithelial bicarbonate and NaCl reabsorption (2Ambuhl P.M.

Physiol. 1997; 273: F289-F299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) do not react with the NHE3-megalin complex (1Biemesderfer D. Nagy T. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17518-17524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), it seems likely that endosomal staining with these mAbs was due to the presence of the 9.6 S form of NHE3 in the endosomes and not the NHE3-megalin complex.Our finding that the 21 S megalin-associated form of NHE3 concentrated in the intermicrovillar membrane is inactive raises the possibility that association with megalin may play a role in regulating NHE3 activity in response to physiological stimuli. For example, it is possible that the association of NHE3 with megalin causes inactivation of transport activity. However, it is known that phosphorylation of NHE3 by protein kinase A causes inhibition of NHE3 activity (36Kurashima K., Yu, F.H. Cabado A.G. Szabo E.Z. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J. Biol.

It is possible that phosphorylation of NHE3 causes both its inactivation and its association with megalin. In addition, endocytosis of NHE3 in response to protein kinase A-induced phosphorylation has been described in cultured cell models (38Chow C.W. Khurana S. Woodside M. Grinstein S. Orlowski J. J.

It is therefore also possible that phosphorylation of NHE3 leads to association with megalin and sequestration in the coated pits as a prelude to endocytosis in proximal tubule cells.In conclusion, we have demonstrated that renal brush border NHE3 exists in two oligomeric states: a 9.6 S active form present in microvilli and a 21 S, megalin-associated, inactive form in the intermicrovillar microdomain. Future studies will be needed to examine whether regulation of renal brush border Na+-H+exchange activity may be mediated by shifting the distribution between these forms of NHE3. This study describes the localization of two oligomeric forms of NHE3 to distinct microdomains of the renal brush border. Using density centrifugation combined with specific brush border antibodies, we have shown that a 9.6 S oligomer of NHE3 is predominately expressed on microvilli, while a 21 S, megalin-associated form is concentrated in the intermicrovillar region of the brush border. As shown by Rodmanet al. (32Rodman J.S. Seidman L. Farquhar M.G. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 77-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), this is a distinct microdomain of the apical plasma membrane of the proximal tubule. In addition, transport studies indicate that NHE3 is active in microvilli but inactive in intermicrovillar membranes. The mAb to NHE3 (2B9) that was used in this study is specific to a region within the C terminus of the transporter that lies between amino acids 702 and 756 (10Biemesderfer D. Rutherford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A.K. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F289-F299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This region of NHE3 is blocked from antibody binding when the transporter is complexed with megalin (1Biemesderfer D. Nagy T. DeGray B. Aronson P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17518-17524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The fact that epitopes within the C-terminal region of NHE3 are blocked when NHE3 is complexed with megalin raises questions regarding the interpretation of previous immunocytochemical studies using antibodies made to the C terminus of NHE3.

Nephrol. 1999; 10: 935-942PubMed Google Scholar) of these studies localized NHE3 largely to the microvillar membrane. In fact, when used for immunoelectron microscopy, our mAbs failed to label the intermicrovillar microdomain of the renal brush border (10Biemesderfer D. Rutherford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A.K. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F289-F299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the apparent discrepancy between previous immunocytochemical studies and the present membrane fractionation study, showing large amounts of NHE3 in intermicrovillar membranes, may have resulted from the masking of C-terminal epitopes on NHE3 when the transporter is complexed with megalin. Our present immunocytochemical studies using antigen retrieval show this to be the case. When kidney sections were denatured during the antigen retrieval procedure, we visualized a large pool of NHE3 that colocalized with megalin in the intermicrovillar region of the brush border, consistent with our membrane fractionation data showing a major pool of NHE3 in megalin-rich, nonmicrovillar (and nonendosomal) dense membranes. Immunocytochemical localization of this pool of NHE3 was not an artifact of the antigen retrieval procedure, since similar staining was found without antigen retrieval by use of a polyclonal anti-NHE3 antibody raised to a peptide encompassing the C-terminal 22 amino acids of NHE3 (12Kim G.-H. Ecelbarger C. Knepper M.A. Packer R.K. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 935-942PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies have localized Na+/H+ exchange activity (35Sabolic I. Brown D. Am. J.

Physiol. 1997; 273: F289-F299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) within endosomes in the proximal tubule. In contrast, the data presented here indicate that the membranes enriched in the NHE3-megalin complex are derived from the intermicrovillar region of the brush border (apical plasma membrane) and not from an endosomal compartment. Since the present study did not directly examine the NHE3 protein present in endosomes, the relationship between endosomal NHE3 and that found in the intermicrovillar microdomain of the brush border remains unclear. However, because the NHE3 antibodies that we used in a previous study to detect NHE3 in endosomes (10Biemesderfer D. Rutherford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A.K. Aronson P.S. Am. J.

To identify the domain in recombinant iPLA2β (riPLA2β) underlying this interaction, multiple techniques were employed. First, we identified calcium-activated CaM induced alterations in the kinetics of proteolytic fragment generation during limited trypsinolysis (i.e. CaM footprinting). Tryptic digests of riPLA2β (83 kDa) in the presence of EGTA alone, Ca+2 alone, or EGTA and CaM together resulted in the production of a major 68-kDa protein whose kinetic rate of formation was specifically attenuated in incubations containing CaM and Ca+2 together. Western blotting utilizing antibodies directed against either the N- or C-terminal regions of riPLA2β indicated the specific protection of riPLA2β by calcium-activated CaM at a cleavage site ≈15 kDa from the C terminus. Moreover, calcium-activated calmodulin increased the kinetic rate of tryptic cleavage near the active site of riPLA2β. Second, functional characterization of products from these partial tryptic digests demonstrated that ≈90% of the 68-kDa riPLA2β tryptic product (i.e. lacking the 15-kDa C-terminus) did not bind to a CaM affinity matrix in the presence of Ca2+, although >95% of the noncleaved riPLA2β as well as a 40-kDa C-terminal peptide bound tightly under these conditions. Third, when purified riPLA2β was subjected to exhaustive trypsinolysis followed by ternary complex CaM affinity chromatography, a unique tryptic peptide (694AWSEMVGIQYFR705) within the 15-kDa C-terminal fragment was identified by RP-HPLC, which bound to CaM-agarose in the presence but not the absence of calcium ion. Fourth, fluorescence energy transfer experiments demonstrated that this peptide (694) bound to dansyl-calmodulin in a calcium-dependent fashion.

Kambe T. Shimbara S. Kudo I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3103-3115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). To gain insight into the biochemical mechanisms responsible for the activation of iPLA2 in stimulated cells, an early observation was re-explored that demonstrated that the addition of calcium ion to myocardial cytosol inhibited iPLA2 activity (1Wolf R.A. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 7295-7303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, this inhibition was shown to be due to a protein factor that was identified as calmodulin after purification to homogeneity (13Wolf M.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20989-20992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). These results were confirmed by reconstitution of calcium-dependent iPLA2 inhibition utilizing authentic calmodulin (13Wolf M.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20989-20992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Through detailed analysis of the interaction of myocardial iPLA2 with CaM, we demonstrated the formation of a catalytically inactive ternary complex of CaM·Ca2+·iPLA2 that could be reversibly dissociated by chelation of calcium ion with EGTA to regain full catalytic activity. Subsequent work demonstrated that agents that deplete intracellular calcium ion pools (e.g. thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid), even in the absence of receptor occupancy or alterations in cytosolic calcium ion concentration, resulted in arachidonic acid release in intact cells (10Wolf M.J. Wang J. Turk J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1522-1526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Furthermore, agents that inhibited the interaction of calmodulin with its target proteins through prevention of calcium-induced conformational changes in calmodulin (e.g. W-7) resulted in the release of [3H]arachidonic acid in resting A-10 smooth muscle cells (10Wolf M.J. Wang J. Turk J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1522-1526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the majority of iPLA2 activity in cells is tonically inhibited and that dissociation of calmodulin from iPLA2 is the major mechanism that transforms a calcium-independent catalytic activity into an enzyme that is responsive to alterations in intracellular calcium ion homeostasis. Collectively, these results gave rise to the hypothesis of “calcium pool depletion-mediated iPLA2activation” (10Wolf M.J. Wang J. Turk J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1522-1526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To further define the physiologic relevance of this hypothesis, it became important, from both a mechanistic perspective as well as a therapeutic strategy, to determine the site(s) of interaction of iPLA2β with calmodulin. Since the first x-ray crystal structure (14Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A. Science. 1992; 257: 1251-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (942) Google Scholar) and NMR solution structure (15Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1179) Google Scholar) of CaM·peptide complexes became available, it was apparent that calcium-induced conformationally activated calmodulin interacted with its regulatory targets at multiple contact points. No universal consensus sequences mediating the interaction of calmodulin with its extremely diverse protein targets have been identified, although the importance of positionally conserved hydrophobic and basic amino acid residues has been demonstrated in some cases (16O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar, 17James P. Vorherr T. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 38-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 18Crivici A. Ikura M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol.

Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Accordingly, unambiguous identification of the loci of interaction of CaM with iPLA2β cannot be recognized a priori from comparisons of the iPLA2β primary sequence with other known calmodulin-regulated target proteins. To identify the site of interaction of calcium-activated calmodulin with iPLA2β, analysis of direct protein-protein interactions (protein footprinting), functional interactions (ternary complex affinity chromatography), and biophysical interactions (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) were pursued. Herein, we demonstrate that incubation of iPLA2β with trypsin in the presence of calmodulin and calcium ion protects against tryptic cleavage at a C-terminal site (at or near residue 630) and increases hydrolytic cleavage near the active site of riPLA2β. Moreover, complete tryptic digestion of riPLA2β resulted in a peptide within this 15-kDa C-terminal region (AWSEMVGIQYFR corresponding to residues 694–705) that binds to CaM in a calcium-dependent manner. Collectively, these results identify the 15-kDa C-terminal region of riPLA2β as necessary and sufficient for the calcium-induced binding of calmodulin to riPLA2β and conformational alteration of riPLA2β near the active site. The peptide corresponding to residues 23–42 (CRVKEISVADYTSHERVREEG) near the N terminus of iPLA2β (GenBank accession number I15470) was synthesized by Alpha Diagnostic International (San Antonio, TX). The peptide corresponding to residues 731–744 (CTEVYIYEHREEFQK) near the C terminus of iPLA2β was synthesized by the Protein Chemistry Laboratory at Washington University. Both peptides contain N-terminal cysteine residues for covalent linkage to maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin as a carrier protein for generating antibodies as well as to activated thiol-Sepharose 4B for subsequent affinity purification of the antibodies. The synthetic 12-amino acid peptide (AWSEMVGIQYFR) corresponding to amino acid residues 694–705 of the iPLA2β sequence was synthesized by Research Genetics. Sequencing grade modified trypsin used for trypsinolysis of iPLA2β was purchased from Promega. Kaleidoscope prestained SDS-PAGE protein standards were obtained from Bio-Rad. The μRPC C2/C18 SC 2.1/10 column, CNBr-activated Sepharose resin, and ECL reagents were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.l-α-1- Palmitoyl-2-[1-14C]arachidonyl-phosphatidylcholine, used for measurements of riPLA2β activity, was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. High purity bovine brain calmodulin was purchased from Calbiochem. Calmodulin-agarose and most other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Recombinant calcium-independent phospholipase A2β was purified to homogeneity from an Sf9 cell expression system by sequential affinity chromatographic steps with ATP-agarose and CaM-agarose affinity resins as described previously (21Hazen S.L. Stuppy R.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10622-10630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wolf M.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol.

Affinity purified polyclonal antibodies directed against riPLA2β were prepared by initial injection of 50 μg of purified riPLA2β in 0.5 ml of Freund's complete adjuvant and boosted every 2 weeks with 50 μg of riPLA2β in Freund's incomplete adjuvant until seroconversion was detected by immunoblotting. Purified riPLA2β was coupled to CNBr-activated Sepharose according to the manufacturer's instructions to generate an affinity column to purify the anti-iPLA2β antibodies. Immunoreactive rabbit serum was loaded onto an riPLA2β Sepharose column, and nonspecifically bound protein was removed from the column by exhaustive washing with 10 column volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 150 mm NaCl. Anti-iPLA2β antibody was eluted by sequential application of solutions containing either 4.9 mMgCl2 or 100 mm glycine, pH 2.5. After elution, the antibody was dialyzed against ammonium bicarbonate buffer prior to lyophilization for storage at −20 °C. Antibodies directed against the peptides corresponding to residues 23–42 (N-terminal) and residues 731–744 (C-terminal) regions of iPLA2β were generated by immunizing rabbits with conjugates of the peptides with keyhole limpet hemocyanin. Briefly, maleimide-activated keyhole limpet hemocyanin (2 mg) was reacted with each peptide (2 mg) according to the manufacturer's instructions and dialyzed against 83 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 0.9 m NaCl. Rabbits were immunized/boosted with the conjugates using Freund's complete/incomplete adjuvants as described above. For affinity purification of the antibodies, each peptide (2 mg) was covalently linked to activated thiol-Sepharose 4B (1 ml) in the presence of an equal volume of 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 4.5. Following an overnight incubation with mixing at room temperature, the extent of the reaction was monitored spectrophotometrically by the displacement of the 2-pyridyl groups as 2-thiopyridone (ε343 = 8.08 × 103m−1 cm−1). Immunoreactive rabbit antisera were diluted 1:10 with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, prior to application to the appropriate affinity resin equilibrated with the same buffer. The resins were extensively washed with 10 column volumes of 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5) containing 500 mm NaCl prior to elution of bound antibodies with 0.1m glycine, pH 2.5, into collection tubes containing 1m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0 (1:10 fraction volume), for investigation. Antibodies were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline and stored at 4 °C prior to use. Purified recombinant iPLA2β (9 μg) in 25 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, containing 100 mm NaCl and 2 mm DTT was partially digested with N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone-modified trypsin (1:30 w/w trypsin:iPLA2β) in the presence (1 mm CaCl2) or absence (1 mm EGTA) of calcium ion and/or CaM (9 μg, 5-fold molar excess of CaM:iPLA2β) at room temperature. Each reaction was terminated at the indicated time intervals (i.e. 1, 3, and 9 min) by the addition of SDS-PAGE loading bromophenol buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.025% bromphenol blue, and 100 mm DTT). The proteolyzed iPLA2β products were subsequently separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels according to the method of Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar), transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes by electroelution in 100 mm CAPS buffer, pH 11, and analyzed by ECL Western blotting with polyclonal antibodies directed against the iPLA2β holoprotein, the N-terminal region of iPLA2β, or the C-terminal region of iPLA2β in conjunction with an anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate. Purified recombinant iPLA2β (50 μg) was partially digested with trypsin (1:30 w/w trypsin:iPLA2β) for 4–20 min at room temperature in 25 mm imidazole buffer, pH 8.0, containing 0.1 mmEGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 50–150 mm NaCl. The reaction was terminated by addition of 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzene-sulfonylfluoride. Calcium chloride was added to a final concentration of 5 mm, and the sample was applied to a 0.5-ml CaM-agarose column equilibrated with 25 mmimidazole, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm CaCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 150 mm NaCl. The column was then washed with equilibration buffer containing 10-fold less (0.5 mm) CaCl2, followed by elution of the bound proteins with equilibration buffer (without CaCl2) containing 10 mm EGTA. Column fractions were analyzed by Western analysis as described above using polyclonal antibodies directed against the iPLA2β holoprotein. A 25-μg sample of highly purified riPLA2β was exhaustively digested with 1 μg of N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone-modified trypsin in 1.5 ml of 25 mm imidazole buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 mm EGTA for 18 h at 37 °C. The resultant proteolytic fragments were adjusted to a final calcium ion concentration of 5 mm and loaded onto a 0.5-ml column of CaM-agarose. The column was washed with 5 column volumes of a buffer containing 25 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and 0.5 mm CaCl2 prior to the elution of bound peptides with a buffer containing 25 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and 4 mm EGTA. Aliquots of the tryptic peptides (50 μl) in the CaM-agarose load and void fractions were directly analyzed by RP-HPLC utilizing a μRPC C2/C18 SC 2.1/10 Smart System column with UV absorbance detection at 215 nm. The peptides from the EGTA eluent of the CaM-agarose column (2.0 ml) were concentrated by lyophilization, resuspended in 100 μl of deionized H2O containing 0.075% trifluoroacetic acid (buffer A), and loaded onto a μRPC C2/C18 SC 2.1/10 RP-HPLC column. Peptides were resolved utilizing a discontinuous linear gradient from 0 to 38% buffer B (80% acetonitrile and 0.06% trifluoroacetic acid) for 60 min, 38 to 75% buffer B for 30 min, and 75 to 100% buffer B for 15 min. The affinity purified peptide from the RP-HPLC purification of the calmodulin-agarose eluent (denoted in Fig.4 B) was collected, lyophilized, and sequenced by automated Edman degradation utilizing an Applied Biosystems Procise Sequencer. RP-HPLC of the synthetic 12-amino acid peptide corresponding to the obtained sequence (vida infra) was conducted employing the chromatographic conditions described above. Experiments employing dansyl-calmodulin were conducted utilizing an Aminco SLM 4800C fluorescence spectrometer (SLM Instruments, Inc.) using established methods (24Kincaid R.L. Vaughan M. Osborne Jr., J.C. Tkachauk V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10638-10643Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Johnson J.D. Wittenauer L.A. Biochem.

Briefly, the indicated amounts of synthetic peptide were added to a 3-ml cuvette containing 2 ml of dansyl-CaM (1 μg/ml) in the presence of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 130 mm KCl, and 500 μm CaCl2or 1 mm EGTA. Emission spectra were recorded from 400 to 550 nm utilizing an excitation wavelength of 340 nm. Mutants of iPLA2β were prepared by polymerase chain reaction-directed mutagenesis techniques as previously described (28Delidow B.C. White B.A. Methods in Molecular Biology: PCR Protocols: Current Methods and Applications. 15. Humana, Totowa, NJ1993: 217-228Google Scholar). Three truncated mutants of iPLA2β containing amino acid residues 1–381, 1–600, and 1–690 were prepared. Briefly, antisense primers containing a stop codon after amino acids 381, 600, and 690 followed by an SphI restriction site were prepared for use in polymerase chain reaction with a sense primer containing anEcoRI restriction site prior to the ATG start site of the iPLA2β coding sequence.EcoRI/SalI-digested polymerase chain reaction products were cloned into similarly digested pFAST vectors for expression of recombinant protein in the baculovirus expression system as previously described (22Wolf M.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30879-30885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). All constructs were sequenced on both strands to ensure fidelity of the sequence within the constructs prior to use in the baculoviral expression system. Previous work has demonstrated that riPLA2β reversibly binds to calmodulin through a ternary complex comprised of calcium, calmodulin, and unidentified domains of riPLA2β (22Wolf M.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30879-30885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we sought to identify the specific regions of riPLA2β involved in calmodulin binding and modulation of iPLA2β enzymic activity. Historically, one approach through which protein-protein contact points have been identified is through binding of the regulatory protein to the target protein and protection of the target protein from proteolysis at the binding site (i.e. protein footprinting). Accordingly, we analyzed the kinetics of the production of individual proteolytic fragments formed during timed incubations of trypsin with riPLA2β, calcium, and calmodulin. Incubation of trypsin with riPLA2β produced six major proteolytic fragments (A-F) within 9 min under the conditions employed (Fig.1). Similar kinetic analysis of tryptic digests of riPLA2β in the presence of EGTA alone, Ca+2 alone, or CaM and EGTA together produced similar amounts and ratios of proteolysis products. Remarkably, tryptic digests of riPLA2β in the presence of CaM and calcium together resulted in the nearly complete disappearance of the major proteolytic product at 68 kDa and the increased intensity of the band at 40 kDa (Fig. 1, band E). These results demonstrate that calcium-activated CaM specifically protected riPLA2β from trypsinolysis at a single cleavage site within ∼15 kDa of either its N or C terminus. Moreover, they suggest that a site near the center of riPLA2β (i.e. near the active site) undergoes a conformational alteration in the presence of calcium and calmodulin together but not with either alone. To determine the locus of the protected site, immunoaffinity purified polyclonal antibodies directed against either the N- or C-terminal regions of iPLA2β were generated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Western blotting of the products from the limited trypsinolysis of riPLA2β using the N-terminal antibody demonstrated bands at 83 kDa (starting material) and fragments at 68, 59, and 43 kDa (Fig.2 A). In contrast, Western blotting with the C-terminal antibody identified the 83-kDa (starting material) as well as 53- and 40-kDa proteolyzed products (Fig.2 B). These results demonstrate that calcium-activated CaM tightly binds iPLA2β at a specific site ≈15 kDa from the C-terminal region (i.e. the production of the 68-kDa product was dramatically attenuated in the presence of calcium-activated CaM but not with calmodulin or calcium ion alone). Furthermore, the results also demonstrate the conformational modification of iPLA2β by calcium-activated CaM at a site 40 kDa from the C terminus (i.e. near the active site).Figure 2Time course analysis of the effect of Ca2+· CaM on limited trypsinolysis of riPLA2β. Purified recombinant iPLA2β (9 μg) was incubated with trypsin in 25 mm imidazole buffer, pH 8.0 (containing 100 mmNaCl and 1 mm DTT) with either Ca+2 (1 mm CaCl2), EGTA (1 mm), EGTA (1 mm) and CaM (9 μg) or Ca+2 (1 mm) + CaM (9 μg). Aliquots from each reaction were taken at the indicated times, boiled in SDS-PAGE buffer, electrophoresed, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes as described above. Immunoreactive bands were detected by ECL utilizing immunoaffinity-purified polyclonal antibodies directed against either the iPLA2β N terminus (residues 23–42) (A) or the iPLA2β C terminus (residues 731–744) (B) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The first lane is riPLA2β alone incubated in buffer containing EGTA for 9 min at 22 °C in the absence of trypsin (−T). Similar results were obtained in three independent preparations.

Previously, it has been established that riPLA2β (both crude and purified) binds to CaM in the presence of calcium ion and that it can be reversibly dissociated by EGTA (22Wolf M.J. Gross R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30879-30885Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the specific interactions engendered from ternary complex calmodulin affinity chromatography were utilized to discriminate between the proteolytic products of riPLA2β that retained calcium-activated CaM binding elements and those that did not. Two approaches were employed. In the first approach, partial tryptic digests of riPLA2β (4 min) were prepared in the absence of calcium-activated CaM to generate (predominantly) the 68-kDa polypeptide cleaved at or near residue 630. Following the addition of calcium ion, the partially trypsinized mixture was loaded onto a CaM-agarose affinity column previously equilibrated with buffer containing 5 mm CaCl2. After washing, the column was eluted with buffer containing 10 mm EGTA. Western analysis of column eluates of proteolytic fragments from the 4-min digestion reaction demonstrated that the overwhelming majority (∼90%) of the 68-kDa polypeptide did not bind to the affinity matrix, whereas >95% of the holoenzyme (83 kDa) avidly bound to the CaM column (Fig. 3 A). Interestingly, the 40-kDa fragment (band E in Figs. 1 and2 B) corresponding to the C-terminal half of riPLA2β containing the active site appeared to bind as tightly to the Ca+2·CaM resin as did the 83-kDa holoprotein (Fig. 3 A). The small residual amount of binding of the 68-kDa fragment could be due to the presence of iPLA2β heteromultimers, which still possess at least one intact C-terminal portion of iPLA2β (either as an intact 83-kDa component or as a noncovalently associated C-terminal fragment). To further address this issue, riPLA2β was trypsinized for 20 min to eliminate (as muc"

Phenotypic analysis of deletion and point mutations, in conjunction with a yeast two-hybrid assay, revealed that Nam1p, a protein involved in RNA processing and translation in mitochondria, binds specifically to this domain. The significance of this interaction in vivo was demonstrated by the fact that the temperature-sensitive phenotype of a deletion mutation (rpo41Δ2), which impinges on this amino-terminal domain, is suppressed by overproducing Nam1p. In addition, mutations in the amino-terminal domain result specifically in decreased steady-state levels of mature mitochondrial CYTBand COXI transcripts, which is a primary defect observed inNAM1 null mutant yeast strains. Finally, one point mutation (R129D) did not abolish Nam1p binding, yet displayed an obviousCOX1/CYTB transcript defect. This mutation exhibited the most severe mitochondrial phenotype, suggesting that mutations in the amino-terminal domain can perturb other critical interactions, in addition to Nam1p binding, that contribute to the observed phenotypes. These results implicate the amino-terminal domain of mtRNA polymerases in coupling additional factors and activities involved in mitochondrial gene expression directly to the transcription machinery.

These results implicate the amino-terminal domain of mtRNA polymerases in coupling additional factors and activities involved in mitochondrial gene expression directly to the transcription machinery. kilobase pair polymerase chain reaction amino acids Expression of the mitochondrial genome occurs in the organelle matrix and involves both nuclear- and mtDNA-encoded factors. In addition to mRNAs (which usually encode protein subunits of the enzyme complexes involved in oxidative phosphorylation), mtDNA in many organisms also contains genes for tRNAs and ribosomal RNAs that are necessary for mitochondrial translation. The remaining factors required for expression and replication of the mitochondrial genome are encoded in the nucleus and imported into the organelle. Mitochondrial transcripts are often polycistronic and thus a large number of RNA processing reactions is required to liberate mature RNA species (1Shadel G.S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 65: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, RNA processing events have been implicated in the initiation of mtDNA replication (2Shadel G.S. Clayton D.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 409-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (816) Google Scholar). Thus, a complete understanding of mitochondrial gene expression and mtDNA replication requires broader understanding of how these RNA processing events are accomplishedin vivo. The mitochondrial transcription machinery in the budding yeast,Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is well characterized (3Jaehning J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1993; 8: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 4Shadel G.S. Clayton D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16083-16086Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and involves a nucleus-encoded mtRNA polymerase (sc-mtRNA polymerase, encoded by the RPO41 gene) that is homologous to the single subunit Escherichia coli bacteriophage RNA polymerase (5Greenleaf A.L. Kelly J.L. Lehman I.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3391-3394Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 6Masters B.S. Stohl L.L. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1987; 51: 89-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar) and a transcription initiation factor sc-mtTFB (7Jang S.H. Jaehning J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22671-22677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Shadel G.S. Clayton D.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2101-2108Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 9Xu B. Clayton D.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1053-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In addition, factors involved in mtRNA processing have also been identified in this organism, including those involved in liberating tRNAs, rRNAs, and mRNAs from polycistronic transcripts and excising introns from certain messages (see Ref. 10Dieckman C.L. Staples R.R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1994; 152: 145-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar for review). One such factor, Nam1p (also known as Mtf2p), was initially identified as a high copy suppressor of mtDNA point mutations that affect splicing of introns from the mitochondrial COX1 and CYTB messages (11Asher E.B. Groudinski O. Dujardin G. Altamura N. Kermorgant G. Slonimski P.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 215: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and independently as a temperature-sensitive mutation affecting mitochondrial transcript levels (12Lisowsky T. Michaelis G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Nam1p is localized to the mitochondrial matrix (13Wallis M.G. Groudinski O. Slonimski P.P. Dujardin G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 222: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and characterization of NAM1 null mutant strains has confirmed its involvement in COX1 andCYTB intron removal and elucidated potential roles for this protein in overall mitochondrial translation capacity andATP6/8 mRNA processing and/or stability (14Groudinsky O. Bousquet I. Wallis M.G. Slonimski P.P. Dujardin G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1993; 240: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, crude mitochondrial transcription complexes isolated from oneNAM1 mutant strain remain competent for transcription but exhibit an altered DNA binding activity profile (12Lisowsky T. Michaelis G. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 219: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), suggesting a potential link between Nam1p function and the mitochondrial transcription machinery. We had shown previously that an amino-terminal domain of yeast mtRNA polymerase is dispensable for transcription initiation in vivo but nonetheless is required for stability and maintenance of the mitochondrial genome, suggesting that additional activities may be coupled to the transcription process in mitochondria (15Wang Y. Shadel G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8046-8051Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These studies implicated amino acids 29–208 of mtRNA polymerase as a minimal portion of the protein that harbors an independent functional domain of the enzyme. Here we have characterized this domain further and demonstrate that one of its functions is to provide an interaction point for Nam1p, that may provide the means to couple factors involved in additional aspects of RNA metabolism directly to the transcription machinery in yeast mitochondria. In principal, such a coupling phenomenon in mitochondria may be analogous to mechanisms of gene expression in the nucleus, where many aspects of mRNA processing are coupled functionally to transcription via interactions involving the carboxyl-terminal domain of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (16Neugebauer K.M. Roth M.B. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3279-3285Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 17Steinmetz E.J. Cell. 1998; 89: 491-494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Wild-type and mutated alleles ofRPO41 used in the plasmid shuffle assay were expressed in yeast from the plasmid pGS348 (15Wang Y. Shadel G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8046-8051Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which contains a 7.2-kb,1 RPO41gene-containing, SalI-SpeI restriction fragment of yeast genomic DNA cloned into the shuttle vector pRS314 (18Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Construction of the rpo41Δ2- andrpo41Δ3-containing versions of pGS348 has been described elsewhere (15Wang Y. Shadel G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8046-8051Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). All of the yeast two-hybrid bait plasmids utilized in this study are derivatives of pAS1 (19Bai C. Elledge S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), which express theRPO41 reading frame as amino-terminal fusions to the Gal4p DNA-binding domain. Two parental RPO41-bait plasmids were used, pAS1-RPO and pAS1-RPO-FL, that contained amino acids 27–633 and amino acids 27–1351 of sc-mtRNA polymerase, respectively (numbered according to Ref. 6Masters B.S. Stohl L.L. Clayton D.A. Cell. 1987; 51: 89-99Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). To construct the corresponding mutatedRPO41-bait plasmids, restriction fragments containing the mutated versions of RPO41 were isolated from PCR products (or from the corresponding pGS348 derivatives) and ligated into either pAS1-RPO or pAS1-RPO-FL (Table I). The plasmid used to overproduce Nam1p (pYES/GS-NAM1) was obtained from Invitrogen (Genestorm clone yDL044cy). This plasmid contains a V5 epitope-tagged version of theNAM1 gene under control of a galactose-inducible promoter.Table IResults of a yeast two-hybrid analysis of the interaction of Nam1p with the amino-terminal domain of sc-mtRNA polymeraseRPO41-bait plasmidmtRNA polymerase amino acids presentLacZ assaypAS1-RPO-FL27–1351PositivepAS1-RPO27–633Positive1-aAlso shown in Fig.3 A.pAS1-RPOΔ2118–633PositivepAS1-RPOΔ3212–633NegativepAS1-RPOΔ4400–633Negative 1-aAlso shown in Fig.3 A.pAS1-RPO (E119A/C121A)27–633PositivepAS1-RPO (R129D)27–633PositivepAS1-RPO-FL (N152A/Y154A)27–1351NegativepAS1-RPO-FL (E179A)27–1351Positive1-a Also shown in Fig.3 A. Open table in a new tab Specific point mutations in theRPO41 gene were generated by a two-step, megaprimer PCR protocol as follows. The PCR template (pBS348) consisted of a 2.1-kbSalI-BamHI restriction fragment from pGS348, which contains the amino-terminal extension of RPO41 and upstream sequences, cloned into pBSII KS+ (Stratagene, Inc). Promoters for T7 and T3 RNA polymerase flank the RPO41 insert in this plasmid. For each mutation, a PCR was performed that utilized a specific mutagenic oligonucleotide (synthesized by Midland Certified Reagent Co., Midland, TX) as one primer and an oligonucleotide corresponding to the T7 promoter as the second primer to generate an ∼500-base pair product. This PCR product was gel-purified and used as the source of a megaprimer (after denaturation, the 500-nucleotide strand containing the T7 primer sequence serves as the megaprimer) in a second PCR in conjunction with a T3 primer. The 2.2-kb product of this second PCR, which now had the desired mutation fixed in theRPO41 gene, was digested with SalI andBamHI and ligated into pGS348 to form a full-length mutatedRPO41 allele that can be expressed in yeast. All PCRs were performed using Pfu Turbo DNA Polymerase (Stratagene, Inc.) in the buffer supplied by the manufacturer and typically consisted of 25–30 amplification cycles (95 °C, 30 s; 55 °C, 1 min; 68 °C, 8 min) followed by a 12-min, 68 °C extension period at the end of the last cycle. In all cases, the nucleotide sequence of the portion of RPO41 open reading frame in pGS348 that was amplified during the mutagenesis protocol was determined to ensure that the desired site-directed mutation was the only mutation introduced during the PCR procedure. Routine growth and transformation of yeast strains, as well as standard growth media preparation, were accomplished as described by Sherman (20Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar). The yeast strain GS112 (α his3-Δ200 leu2-3,-112 ura3-52 trp1-Δ1 ade2, rpo41Δ1::HIS3 +pGS347 (URA3, RPO41)) was used to analyze RPO41 gene mutations by plasmid shuffle (21Sikorski R.S. Boeke J.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 302-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (495) Google Scholar). After transformation of GS112 with the desired mutant RPO41 allele on a pGS348 plasmid, two rounds of growth on synthetic dextrose (SD) medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid were used to select for strains that express the mutated version of theRPO41 gene as their only source of mtRNA polymerase, as described previously (15Wang Y. Shadel G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8046-8051Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To characterize the growth phenotypes of the mutant strains in detail, serial 10-fold dilutions were plated onto solid YPD (glucose-containing medium) and YPG (glycerol-containing medium) using a 48-pin multiplex plating tool (“Frogger,” Dankar, Inc.) and grown at both 30 and 37 °C. Growth on YPG medium requires mitochondrial respiration, whereas growth on YPD does not; therefore, defective growth on YPG medium was scored as a mitochondrial petite phenotype. The yeast strain Y190 (a gal4 gal80 his3 trp1-901 ade2-101 ura3-52 leu2-3, -112 + URA3::GAL-lacZ + LYS2::GAL-HIS3 cyh r) was used for all two-hybrid analyses. This strain contains two Gal4p-inducible reporter genes integrated in its genome that allow two-hybrid positives to be selected based on a His+ growth phenotype and screened using a blue color-generating β-galactosidase (LacZ) assay (19Bai C. Elledge S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Y190 was transformed with pAS1-RPO to generate anRPO41-bait strain for the initial two-hybrid screen for proteins that interact with an intact amino-terminal domain. The resulting strain, Y190 (pAS-RPO), was subsequently transformed with a library of yeast cDNA fragments fused to the Gal4p activation domain in the LEU2 plasmid pACT (19Bai C. Elledge S.J. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 283: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Leu+, His+ colonies were selected on SD medium supplemented with adenine (20 mg/liter) and containing 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (Sigma) at 30–50 mm. We pooled the Leu+, His+colonies from a screen of ∼70,000 library plasmid transformants and isolated plasmids from these strains en masse using a smash and grab protocol (22Hoffman C.S. Winston F. Gene ( Amst. ). 1989; 57: 267-272Crossref Scopus (2043) Google Scholar). In this manner, an enriched library of potential positives (library plasmids that yielded a His+phenotype) was generated. This library was used to transform the yeast strain Y190 pAS1-RPOΔ4 that contains an RPO41-bait plasmid specifically missing the amino-terminal domain. Leu+transformants from this transformation were replica-plated onto both Leu−, His+ medium and Leu−, His− medium to select for strains that were Leu+ (i.e. contained a library plasmid), yet His− due to lack of interaction with the amino-terminal truncated bait. The 52 strains that met all the above criteria were kept for further analysis. Next, the library plasmid from each of these strains was isolated and used to transform a fresh Y190 (pAS1-RPO) strain. A LacZ color assay (19Bai C. Elledge S.J.

Plasmids that conferred a blue color in Y190 (pAS1-RPO) but not in Y190 (pAS1-RPOΔ4) were subjected to nucleotide sequence analysis to determine the identity of the gene implicated in the interaction. A 7-ml culture of each yeast strain analyzed was grown at 30 °C in YPG medium to stationary phase. This culture was used to inoculate 450 ml of SD medium supplemented with leucine (100 mg/liter), adenine (20 mg/liter), and uracil (20 mg/liter) to a starting A 600 of 0.025. This culture was subsequently grown at 37 °C on an orbital shaker (200 rpm) to a final A 600 of 0.8. Yeast cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in spheroplasting buffer (1.35m sorbitol, 0.1 m EDTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.4). Zymolyase 20T (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) was added to a concentration of 3 mg/g wet weight of cells and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min. Six volumes of 1 msorbitol were added to the sample, and the resulting spheroplasts were harvested by centrifugation (3000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C). The spheroplast pellet was then resuspended in 2 volumes of MT buffer (400 mm mannitol, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4). An equal volume of glass beads was added, and the spheroplasts were lysed by vortexing (two 30-s pulses separated by a 1-min incubation on ice). The resulting cell lysate was removed from the glass beads and transferred to a fresh centrifuge tube, and 10 volumes of MT buffer were added. The lysate was then subjected to a low speed centrifugation (1900 × g for 5 min at 4 °C) to remove cellular debris and nuclei. The resulting supernatant was transferred to a fresh centrifuge tube and subjected to a final high speed centrifugation (10,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) to pellet mitochondria. RNA was extracted immediately from this mitochondrial pellet as described (23Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar) and purified further using RNeasy columns (Qiagen). Five μg of column-purified mitochondrial RNA from each sample was separated on a 1.3% agarose-formaldehyde gel as described (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory, Cold Springs Harbor, NY1989: 7.37-7.51Google Scholar). Northern blotting was performed essentially as described (15Wang Y. Shadel G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8046-8051Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), except the random prime radiolabeled probes used for these experiments were generated using PCR products corresponding to the mitochondrial COX1,COX3, and COB genes as templates. The PCR products used as probe templates were generated using purified yeast mtDNA as a template and the following gene-specific primers:COX1, 5′-CCATTAATAATTGGAGCTACAG-3′ and 5′-CCAAAGAATCAAAATAAATGCTCG-3′; COB, 5′-GGCATTTAGAAAATCAAATGTG-3′ and 5′-CTGTCCATAAACACAACAATAACC-3′;COX3, 5′-ATGACACATTTAGAAAGAAGTAG-3′ and 5′-TTAGACTCCTCATCAGTAGAAGA-3′. The mtRNA polymerase of S. cerevisiae is related to bacteriophage RNA polymerases (e.g. T7, T3, and SP6) but contains a unique amino-terminal extension (Fig.1). In an earlier study (15Wang Y. Shadel G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8046-8051Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we reported the analysis of a series of RPO41 deletion mutations that had no effect on protein stability or localization, and ultimately revealed the existence of a functional amino-terminal domain in mtRNA polymerase between amino acids 28 and 208 that is required for mtDNA maintenance and can function in trans. Whereas mtRNA polymerases from most species contain significant amino acid identity in those regions involved in catalytic activity (i.e. the bacteriophage T7 family-like domains), the amino-terminal extensions are not well conserved between species. However, we were able to align the amino acid sequence of the amino-terminal extension of the S. cerevisiae enzyme with that from two other fungal species,Neurospora crassa and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and found that the most conserved region corresponded to amino acids 110–205 of the S. cerevisiae mtRNA polymerase (Fig. 1). In particular, the region encompassing amino acids 117–155 exhibited 18% amino acid identity (identical residues in all three species) and 38% amino acid similarity (identical or similar amino acids in all three species). The degree of similarity in this region is emphasized further if pairwise comparisons are made. For example, the S. cerevisiae and N. crassa proteins are 35% identical and 56% similar in this region. To test the hypothesis that the conserved region of the mtRNA polymerase amino-terminal extension composes all or part of the important functional domain (aa 28–208) we identified previously (15Wang Y. Shadel G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8046-8051Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), we made a series of point mutations in the S. cerevisiae RPO41 gene by site-directed mutagenesis that changed residues that are conserved in all three of the fungal mtRNA polymerases (Fig. 1). The mitochondrial phenotype (assessed by growth on YPG medium) of each of these mutations was determined using a standard plasmid-shuffle strategy, and the effects of these mutations were compared with the phenotypes of two previously characterized deletion mutations in this region (rpo41Δ2 andrpo41Δ3, Fig.2 A). Two individual point mutations were introduced to generate two mutant RPO41alleles, arginine 129 changed to aspartic acid (denoted R129D) and E179A. In addition, two double point mutant alleles were created, E119A/C121A and N152A/Y154A. Both double-point mutant alleles, as well as the R129D allele, exhibited a mitochondrial petite phenotype (slow growth on YPG medium) at both 30 and 37 °C, whereas the E179A mutations resulted in no discernible phenotype. Of the three mutant strains that had a mitochondrial phenotype, the E119A/C121A mutant was the only one capable of sustained growth on YPG at 37 °C, although its growth rate was still markedly reduced compared with the wild-type strain at both 30 and 37 °C. This growth phenotype was almost identical to that observed for the rpo41Δ2mutation. The N152A/Y154A mutant strain grew slowly on YPG at 30 °C and was dramatically impaired on YPG at 37 °C. This growth phenotype was similar to that observed for the rpo41Δ3mutation. The R129D mutation was the most severe mutation, resulting in the slowest growth rate on YPG at 30 °C and virtually no growth on YPG at 37 °C. It is also noted that two of the point mutations (R129D and N152A/Y154A) exhibited a more severe phenotype than therpo41Δ3 mutation, suggesting that this domain when present and mutated perturbs mtRNA polymerase function more severely than a mutation that deletes this region altogether. To confirm that the observed phenotypes of the point mutations were not due to altered protein stability, the expression level of each of the mutant proteins was analyzed by western analysis (Fig. 2 B). All of these proteins were expressed at levels similar to that of the wild-type protein. Again, these results are consistent with our earlier analysis of the rpo41Δ3 mutation that removes this domain completely but does not affect protein localization or stability (15Wang Y. Shadel G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8046-8051Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The observed phenotypes of the amino-terminal domain mutations suggest that this region of the protein is involved in coupling some critical function to the transcription process in mitochondria (15Wang Y. Shadel G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8046-8051Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This coupling capacity could occur directly, by virtue of a structural or catalytic role for this domain, or indirectly through the binding of other mitochondrial regulatory factors, or perhaps both. To test the hypothesis that other mitochondrial factors are involved, we screened a library of yeast genomic DNA fragments for proteins that bind to the amino-terminal portion of yeast mtRNA polymerase using a yeast two-hybrid assay. Our strategy was to identify proteins that interact specifically with the amino-terminal domain of mtRNA polymerase that was implicated here and in our previous studies (15Wang Y. Shadel G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8046-8051Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). To accomplish this, we created two yeast two-hybrid bait plasmids. The first, pAS-RPO, contained RPO41 sequences that encompassed an intact amino-terminal domain (encoding aa 27–633) and the second, pAS-RPOΔ4, that does not encodes the amino-terminal domain but does contain other RPO41 sequences (encoding aa 392–633). The screen involved several steps that ultimately selected for plasmids encoding proteins that exhibited an interaction specifically with the amino-terminal portion of sc-mtRNA polymerase (see “Experimental Procedures”). From an initial screen of ∼70,000 transformants, four library plasmids were identified that met all selection criteria. The yeast genomic DNA fragment in each of these was determined by sequencing both ends of the insert and using this information to search the Saccharomyces Genome Database. Two of these isolates contained the same insert containing the entire NAM1 open reading frame (Fig.3), a gene encoding a mitochondrial matrix protein involved in mtRNA processing and/or translation (11Asher E.B. Groudinski O. Dujardin G. Altamura N. Kermorgant G. Slonimski P.P. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1989; 215: 517-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 12Lisowsky T. Michaelis G. Mol. Gen.

Genet. 1993; 240: 419-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The specificity of the Nam1p interaction for the amino-terminal extension of sc-mtRNA polymerase is shown in Fig. 3 A. The other two isolates corresponded to YTA5 (orRPT2), an ATPase component of 26 S of the proteasome complex, and YGL037c, a yeast ORF of unknown function. We believe thatYTA5 is probably of no functional significance because proteasome subunits are commonly found as false positives in yeast two-hybrid screens, and our preliminary experiments with YGL037c suggest that this gene product does not localize to mitochondria (data not shown). For these reasons, and because Nam1p exhibits characteristics compatible with a protein that might interact with mtRNA polymerase, we focused our attention on NAM1. In our initial two-hybrid screen, the bait plasmid used (pAS-RPO) encoded only amino acids 27–633 of mtRNA polymerase, which primarily contains just the amino-terminal extension of mtRNA polymerase. To ensure that Nam1p interacts with full-length mtRNA polymerase, we constructed a two-hybrid bait plasmid (pAS-RPO-FL) that encodes the entire mature protein (amino acids 27–1351), and we tested it for the interaction with Nam1p in the two-hybrid assay. We found that Nam1p was able to interact with its amino-terminal target in the context of an intact mtRNA polymerase as well (TableI), thus this interaction could be analyzed using either the amino-terminal extension alone or in the context of the full-length mtRNA polymerase. We next determined the effect of the amino-terminal domain mutations on the ability of mtRNA polymerase to bind Nam1p in the two-hybrid assay (Table I). Therpo41Δ2 mutant, which retains a largely intact amino-terminal domain (Fig. 1), exhibited a reduced, yet significant, ability to interact with Nam1p, whereas therpo41Δ3 mutant, which is deleted for the amino-terminal domain altogether, did not interact in this assay (TableI). Of the point mutated proteins, the N152A/Y154A mutant was the only one that did not interact with Nam1p to some degree in this assay. All of the mutated RPO41 fusion proteins shown in Table I were expressed at least as well as the wild-type fusion protein (data not shown); thus those mutations reported to disrupt the Nam1p interaction did not dramatically affect expression or stability of the two-hybrid bait protein. To determine whether the Nam1p interaction with the amino-terminal domain of mtRNA polymerase that we identified by two-hybrid analysis is of physiological significance, we next tested whether overexpression of Nam1p could rescue the phenotype of mutations in the amino-terminal domain. To accomplish this we utilized a high copy plasmid (pYES/GS-NAM1) that expresses an epitope-tagged version of the NAM1 gene from a galactose-inducible promoter (see “Experimental Procedures”). Expression levels of the tagged version of Nam1p from this promoter, even without galactose induction, are capable of complementing a chromosomal NAM1 disruption, confirming that the tagged Nam1p is functional in vivo (data not shown). Introduction of this Nam1p-overproducing plasmid resulted in significant rescue of the temperature-sensitive phenotype of therpo41Δ2 mutation but not that of therpo41Δ3 mutation (Fig. 3 B). These results are consistent with the fact that therpo41Δ2-encoded mtRNA polymerase is still capable of interacting with Nam1p to some extent in the two-hybrid assay, whereas that encoded by rpo41Δ3 is not (Table I). None of the amino-terminal domain point mutations was suppressed by overproducing Nam1p under these conditions (data not shown). In the case of the N152A/Y154A protein, this result is consistent with an inability to interact with Nam1p in the two-hybrid assay. However, the E119A/C121A and R129D proteins still interact with Nam1p"

To begin to explore the mechanisms underlying the distinct phenotypes mediated by the two collagen/laminin receptors, we re-expressed either the full-length α2 integrin subunit (X2C2) or a chimeric integrin α-chain composed of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the α2-subunit fused to the cytoplasmic domain of the α1-subunit (X2C1) in a variant subclone of the NMuMG cell line, which lacks endogenous expression of either the α1β1 or the α2β1 integrin. As reported earlier, the X2C2 and X2C1 transfectants both effectively adhered, spread, and formed focal adhesion complexes on type I collagen matrices (16Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Wu J.E. Wakatsuki T. Dickeson S.K. Elson E.L. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 927-940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). However, the X2C2 transfectants, but not the X2C1 transfectants, developed elongated branches and tubules in three-dimensional collagen gels and migrated on type I collagen in response to a chemotactic gradient of epidermal growth factor (EGF).1 In this study we demonstrate that α2-cytoplasmic domain-dependent migration required activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade. The α2-cytoplasmic domain, but not the α1-cytoplasmic domain, led to p38 MAPK activation. Additionally, expression of constitutively active Rac1(Val-12) rescued p38 MAPK activation and EGF-stimulated chemotactic migration in the X2C1 transfectants. The murine NMuMG cell line was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and insulin (5 μg/ml). The variant NMuMG subclone NMuMG-3, lacking α1β1 and α2β1integrin receptors, was derived by limiting dilution techniques and has been described in detail elsewhere (16Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Wu J.E.

The chimeric integrin cDNA containing the extracellular domain of α2 and the cytoplasmic domain of α1 was constructed, as previously described (16Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Wu J.E. Wakatsuki T.

The full-length and chimeric cDNA constructs were subcloned into the expression vector pSRα (a gift from Dr. Andrey S. Shaw, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO) that contains a cytomegalovirus promoter. All constructs were transfected into the NMuMG-3 clonal cell line using calcium phosphate transfection methodology. Clonal cell lines were selected and maintained in geneticin (850 μg/ml) and evaluated by Southern blot analysis for integration site determination to ensure that distinct clones were evaluated. The X2C2- and X2C1-expressing clonal cell lines were cotransfected with FLAG-tagged wild-type or dominant negative (DN) p38α MAPK cDNA clones, or DN c-Jun N-terminal kinase cDNA clones (gifts from Dr. Aubrey R. Morrison, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO), or HA-tagged constitutively active Rac1(Val-12) or dominant negative Rac1(Asn-17) cDNA clones (gifts from Dr. Margaret Chou, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia) and the Selecta Vecta-Hyg plasmid (Novagen) using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Clonal and nonclonal cell lines were selected and maintained in media containing only geneticin (850 μg/ml) or geneticin plus hygromycin (448 μg/ml). Selected cell lines were evaluated for the expression of the epitope tag using either the goat polyclonal anti-FLAG tag (OctA-probe) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or the mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody (12 CA5) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell migration assays were performed using a modification of the protocol described previously (25Santoro S.A. Zutter M.M. Wu J.E. Staatz W.D. Saelman E.U.M. Keely P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 245: 147-183Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cells were serum-starved in media containing 0.4% serum and insulin (5 μg/ml) for 48 h and then in media containing insulin (5 μg/ml) for 24 h. Cells were removed from flasks with trypsin/EDTA and washed twice before being replated in transwell chambers. Briefly, 12-mm transwell chambers (Corning Costar Corp.) containing polycarbonate membrane with 12-μm pores were coated overnight at 4 °C with type I collagen (25 μg/ml) (Collaborative Biomedical Products) or fibronectin (25 μg/ml) (Sigma Diagnostics Inc.). The filters were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and air-dried. The bottom chamber was filled with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) and Mg2+ (2 mm). Cells were placed in the top chamber at 1.5 × 105 cells/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin and Mg2+ (2 mm) and allowed to migrate for 5 h at 37° in a humidified CO2 incubator. In experiments in which recombinant human EGF was included, EGF (10 ng/ml) was placed in either the lower chamber only or in both the upper and lower chambers as a control for chemotaxis. In experiments where inhibitors were used, the cells were incubated with inhibitors for 15 min. Inhibitors were included in both the upper and lower chambers of the transwell device. After the 5-h incubation, cells remaining on the upper surface of the transwell filter were removed by mechanical scraping. Cells migrating to the lower surface of the filter were detected by fixation and staining with Gill's hematoxylin and eosin solution (Sigma). The number of cells migrating to the lower surface was determined by counting the number of cells in 10 random high power (× 40) fields. Data presented represent the mean ± S.E. of at least three separate experiments. Statistical analyses were carried out by unpairedt tests using GraphPad Prism version 2.01. Cells were serum-starved and treated as described for the migration assays but were plated onto Petri dishes coated with either type I collagen (25 μg/ml) or fibronectin (25 μg/ml) and lysed at defined time points in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 250 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 100 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 40 mm NaF, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5 mm o-vanadate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). Total protein concentration was determined by the Pierce protein assay (Fisher). For immunoblot analyses, equivalent amounts of protein lysate were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Fisher). Immunoblots were blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin or 5% dried milk in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20 and incubated overnight with an appropriate dilution of primary antibody at 4 °C. Secondary antibody incubation was performed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG or anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 2 h at room temperature. The ECL Chemiluminescence System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for visualization. For immunoprecipitation analyses, equivalent amounts of protein lysate were pre-cleared with rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.) and immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-EGF receptor antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). Immunoprecipitated protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto Immunobilon-P transfer membrane (Fisher), and immunoblotted with the appropriate dilution of either monoclonal anti-PY99 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and subsequently with polyclonal anti-EGF receptor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Polyclonal anti-total p38 MAP kinase antibody, polyclonal anti-phospho-p38 MAP kinase antibody (New England Biolabs), monoclonal anti-HA antibody (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), and polyclonal anti-Jun kinase antibody (New England Biolabs) were used for immunoblot analysis. We recently reported that an integrin collagen receptor containing the α2 integrin cytoplasmic domain, but not the α1 integrin cytoplasmic domain, supported EGF-stimulated chemotaxis on a matrix of type I collagen (16Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Wu J.E. Wakatsuki T. Dickeson S.K. Elson E.L. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 927-940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In agreement with these recent observations, NMuMG-3 subclones, lacking endogenous α1β1 and α2β1integrins, but expressing the full-length α2 integrin subunit cDNA construct (X2C2), migrated on type I collagen when stimulated by a chemotactic gradient of EGF (10 ng/ml). In contrast, NMuMG-3 transfectants expressing a chimeric integrin subunit consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of the α2integrin subunit fused to the cytoplasmic domain of the α1 integrin subunit (X2C1) migrated poorly on type I collagen in response to EGF (Fig.1 A), a finding also in agreement with our previous study. Since the vector-only control transfectants did not adhere to collagen substrates, their migration could not be evaluated. To determine whether EGF-stimulated migration was unique to α2β1 integrin-mediated adhesion to collagen substrates or was a more general accompaniment of integrin-mediated adhesion, we assessed the ability of EGF to stimulate migration of the transfectants on fibronectin. The NMuMG-3 cell line and the transfectants expressed similar levels of the α5β1 integrin. The level of expression of the α5β1 integrin on these cells was comparable to the level of the α2β1expression by the transfectants (16Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Wu J.E. Wakatsuki T. Dickeson S.K. Elson E.L. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 927-940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Although the X2C2 and X2C1 transfectants adhered to fibronectin, both transfectants failed to migrate on fibronectin in response to EGF (Fig. 1, B andC). The differences in EGF-stimulated migration were not due to differences in the expression or the extent of phosphorylation of the EGF receptor on the two different clonal cell lines (Fig.1 D). Similar results were obtained with multiple clones (see Ref. 16Zutter M.M. Santoro S.A. Wu J.E. Wakatsuki T. Dickeson S.K. Elson E.L. Am. J. Pathol. 1999; 155: 927-940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar and data not shown). To dissect the pathways responsible for EGF-stimulated α2integrin subunit cytoplasmic domain-dependent chemotaxis, we determined the ability of inhibitors of different signaling pathways to inhibit chemotactic migration. As shown in Fig.2 A, inhibition of either the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) or the p38 MAPK pathways completely inhibited α2 integrin-dependent EGF-stimulated chemotaxis on type I collagen. Inhibition of chemotactic migration by the p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor SB203580 was concentration-dependent, as shown in Fig. 2 B. Surprisingly, the MEK-specific inhibitor of the MAPK/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway PD98059 (50 μm) failed to inhibit migration. Although rapamycin (5 pm), the p70 S6 kinase-specific inhibitor, has been shown to inhibit migration of endothelial cells and leukocytes (26Poon M. Marx S.O. Gallo R. Badimon J.J. Taubman M.B.

Pharmacol. 1993; 110: 1381-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), it failed to inhibit α2-cytoplasmic domain-dependent migration. Since the PI3K pathway is important for stimulating migration through a number of different integrins (29Keely P.J. Westwick J.K. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Parise L.V. Nature. 1997; 390: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 30Shaw L.M. Rabinovitz I. Wang H.H. Toker A. Mercurio A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 949-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), we focused on the role of the p38 MAPK pathway in mediating signals downstream of the α2β1 integrin that may lead to chemotactic migration. To evaluate the role of p38 MAPK activation by the X2C2 and X2C1 transfectants, we evaluated the time course of activation and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK resulting from adhesion to type I collagen. The X2C2 and X2C1 transfectants were serum-starved in a manner identical to that described for the chemotactic migration assays, plated on type I collagen (25 μg/ml) in the absence or presence of EGF (10 ng/ml), and lysed at defined time points. Adhesion of the X2C2 transfectants to type I collagen resulted in phosphorylation of p38 MAPK within 15 min (Fig. 3). Low level p38 MAPK phosphorylation was maintained at 1 h and then declined to base-line levels by 3 and 6 h. The presence of EGF slightly augmented p38 MAPK phosphorylation at 15 min and 1 h. Adhesion to collagen by the X2C1 transfectants stimulated only minimal p38 MAPK phosphorylation at 15 min; phosphorylated p38 MAPK was undetectable after 1 h. EGF slightly augmented phosphorylation of p38 MAPK by the X2C1 transfectant at 15 min but not at later time points (Fig. 3). These findings demonstrate that in a cell line that expressed no endogenous α1β1 or α2β1 integrin, so that adhesion to collagen was entirely dependent upon the transfected collagen receptor, adhesion to type I collagen activated p38 MAPK in a manner that was dependent upon the presence of an α2-cytoplasmic domain. In contrast, EGF only slightly augmented phosphorylation of p38 MAPK when the X2C1 transfectants were adherent to type I collagen. To examine further the requirement of the p38 MAPK pathway in α2-cytoplasmic domain-dependent EGF-stimulated chemotaxis, the X2C2 transfectants were cotransfected with either epitope-tagged wild-type or dominant negative (DN) p38 MAPK cDNA constructs and the Selecta Vecta-Hyg plasmid. Clonal cell lines were selected in geneticin plus hygromycin, and expression of the epitope tag was evaluated by immunoblot analysis (Fig.4 A). Only clonal cell lines expressing low levels of FLAG-tagged DN p38 MAPK were obtained (Fig.4 A), possibly due to toxicity at higher levels of DN p38 MAPK expression. As shown in Fig. 4 B, expression of wild-type p38 MAPK failed to augment unstimulated or EGF-stimulated chemotactic migration. In contrast, expression of the DN p38 MAPK cDNA markedly reduced migration on type I collagen, when cells were either unstimulated (Control) or stimulated by a gradient of EGF (EGF) (Fig. 4 B). Unstimulated migration of the X2C1 transfectants and the X2C2 DN p38 MAPK cotransfectants was significantly less than the unstimulated migration of the X2C2 transfectants (p< 0.008). EGF-stimulated chemotaxis of the X2C1 transfectants and the X2C2 DN p38 MAPK cotransfectants was significantly less than the EGF-stimulated chemotaxis of the X2C2 transfectants (p< 0.01). These results suggest that the p38 MAPK pathway was necessary for α2 integrin cytoplasmic domain-dependent migration on type I collagen in the absence and presence of EGF. However, increased levels of wild-type p38 MAPK protein alone failed to augment migration. The failure of wild-type p38 MAPK protein to increase migration suggests that activation of the p38 MAPK but not simply increased protein expression was necessary to stimulate cell migration. The upstream signals required for p38 MAP kinase activation include activation and phosphorylation of a cascade of protein kinases including SEK (31Ludwig S. Hoffmeyer A. Goebeler M. Kilian K.

Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Since Rac1 is responsible for stimulating invasion of malignant breast cancer and colon cancer cell lines, the role of Rac1 in α2-cytoplasmic domain-mediated migration was evaluated (29Keely P.J. Westwick J.K. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Parise L.V. Nature. 1997; 390: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 30Shaw L.M. Rabinovitz I. Wang H.H. Toker A. Mercurio A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 949-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). The X2C2 transfectants were cotransfected with either HA-tagged constitutively active Rac1(Val-12) or dominant negative Rac1(Asn-17) cDNA constructs and the Selecta Vecta-Hyg plasmid, and clonal cell lines were selected in geneticin plus hygromycin (Fig. 5 A). The unstimulated and EGF-stimulated migration of clonal cell lines expressing constitutively active or dominant negative Rac1 was evaluated. Constitutively active Rac1(Val-12) significantly augmented unstimulated migration (p < 0.05) and increased EGF-stimulated chemotaxis (although not statistically significant) of the X2C2 transfectants on type I collagen (Fig. 5 B). In contrast, dominant negative Rac1(Asn-17) failed to inhibit unstimulated migration but significantly decreased (p < 0.05) chemotactic migration in response to EGF when compared with the X2C2 transfectants (Fig. 5 B). Expression of dominant negative Rac1(Asn-17) reduced p38 MAPK phosphorylation following adhesion to type I collagen (Fig. 5 C). The lack of a significant diminution in unstimulated migration is likely due to the very low level of migration in the absence of EGF. Constitutively active Rac1(Val-12) and dominant negative Rac1(Asn-17) failed to alter migration on fibronectin (data not shown). To address the ability of Rac1(Val-12) to rescue X2C1 migration, the X2C1 transfectants were cotransfected with HA-tagged, constitutively active Rac1(Val-12) and Selecta Vecta-Hyg plasmid, and cells expressing high levels of HA-Rac1(Val-12) were selected in geneticin and hygromycin (Fig. 5 A). Expression of Rac1(Val-12) rescued the ability of the X2C1 transfectants to migrate on type I collagen in the presence or absence of EGF, as shown in Fig.6 A. Unstimulated and EGF-stimulated migration of the X2C2 transfectants and the X2C1Rac1(Val-12) cotransfectants was significantly greater than unstimulated or EGF-stimulated migration of the X2C1 transfectants (p < 0.005 or p < 0.02, respectively). In fact, the X2C1 Rac1(Val-12) cotransfectants migrated in a manner similar to the X2C2 transfectants in the presence or absence of EGF. Migration of the X2C1 Rac1(Val-12) cotransfectants, as well as the X2C2 transfectants was completely inhibited by addition of SB203580, the p38 MAPK inhibitor (Fig. 6 B). The X2C1 Rac1(Val-12) cotransfectants were evaluated for their ability to phosphorylate p38 MAPK following adhesion to type I collagen. Expression of Rac1(Val-12) augmented p38 MAPK phosphorylation by the X2C1 transfectants (Fig. 6 C). These findings suggest that signals downstream of the α2, but not the α1, integrin cytoplasmic domain stimulated migration via the p38 MAPK pathway. Rac1(Val-12) rescued the ability of the X2C1 transfectants to migrate in both an unstimulated and EGF-stimulated manner and to phosphorylate p38 MAPK. Rac1(Val-12)-stimulated migration was inhibited by the p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor. Since Rac1 activates both p38 MAPK and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), we evaluated the short term time course of phosphorylation of JNK resulting from adhesion to type I collagen. Following serum starvation, the X2C2 and X2C1 transfectants were plated on type I collagen (25 μg/ml) in the absence and presence of EGF (10 ng/ml) and lysed at defined time points. Adhesion of the X2C2 transfectants to type I collagen resulted in rapid and robust phosphorylation of JNK (Fig. 7 A). EGF augmented the phosphorylation of JNK at all time points. Adhesion of the X2C1 transfectants stimulated weak phosphorylation of JNK that was only slightly augmented by EGF. To discern whether JNK activation was in part responsible for α2-cytoplasmic domain-dependent migration, the X2C2 transfectants were cotransfected with the dominant negative (DN) JNK cDNA construct, and the Selecta Vecta-Hyg plasmid and cells overexpressing DN JNK were selected in geneticin and hygromycin. X2C2 cotransfectants expressing DN JNK at levels (Fig. 7 B) comparable to the level of DN p38 MAPK kinase expressed by the X2C2 DN p38 MAPK cotransfectants migrated at a rate similar to the X2C2 transfectants (Fig. 7 C). Expression of DN JNK failed to alter significantly EGF-stimulated α2-cytoplasmic domain-dependent migration, indicating that Rac1 activation of p38 MAPK, but not JNK, is required for EGF-stimulated chemotaxis of the X2C2 transfectants. Data from a number of laboratories have suggested that although the α1β1 and α2β1 integrins are structurally similar and both function as adhesion receptors for collagens and/or laminins, the two receptors mediate profound differences on cell phenotype (11–22,35Gardner H. Broberg A. Pozzi A. Laato M. Heino J. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 263-272Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Pozzi A. Wary K.K. Giancotti F.G. Gardner H.A. J.

Chem. 1995; 270: 13548-13552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). The results reported here demonstrate that the α2, but not the α1, integrin cytoplasmic domain mediated signals, via the p38 MAP kinase pathway, that lead to a migratory phenotype. Expression of a constitutively active small G protein, Rac1, augmented p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation and migration of the X2C2 transfectants in the absence and presence of EGF. In addition, expression of constitutively active Rac1 by the X2C1 transfectants restored activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway and a migratory phenotype. Thus, the activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway that occurs upon adhesion to collagen is uniquely dependent on the α2 domain, but not the α1-cytoplasmic domain, and is required for cell migration, either unstimulated or stimulated by EGF. Our earlier work, using complementary “gain-of-function” and “loss-of-function” models indicated that the α2β1 integrin was required for epithelial morphogenesis and branching in three-dimensional collagen gels (15Zutter M.M.

Shearer M. Taylor-Papadimitriou J. J. Cell Sci. 1991; 102: 437-446Crossref Google Scholar). The ability of epithelial cells to branch and to form glandular structures was not supported by the α1β1 integrin. These results were the first to suggest that these two receptors mediate distinctly different cell phenotypes when expressed in epithelial cells. Other laboratories (17Langholz O. Rockel D. Mauch C.

The α1β1and α2β1 integrins have also been shown to mediate distinctly different signals that promote cell cycle progression (20Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G.

Zutter, unpublished data. adhesion of cells expressing the α2β1 integrin does not result in shc phosphorylation. Under similar conditions, adhesion of cells expressing the α1β1integrin produced shcphosphorylation. 3P. A. Klekotka, S. A. Santoro, and M. M. Zutter, unpublished data. These results indicate that both the α1β1 and the α2β1 integrins mediate downstream signals but do so by distinctly different mechanisms. Our results suggest that the α2 integrin subunit utilizes the cytoplasmic domain for signaling specificity that results in activation of the p38 MAP kinase pathway. The ability of different integrin α- and β-subunit cytoplasmic domains to respond to different inside-out or outside-in signaling pathways is poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that EGF-stimulated migration on type I collagen requires α2-cytoplasmic domain-dependent p38 MAP kinase activation and not p42/44 MAP kinase activation. EGF failed to stimulate α5β1-mediated migration on fibronectin. R-Ras-stimulated migration has a number of similarities with EGF-stimulated migration (42Keely P.J. Rusyn E.V. Cox A.D. Parise L.V. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1077-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The effect of R-Ras was dependent on the α2- and not the α5-cytoplasmic domain. In addition, R-Ras-stimulated migration was independent of MEK/MAPK kinase activation. MEK and MAPK kinase activation has been implicated in cell migration of a number of cell types (43Klemke R.L. Cai S. Giannini A.L. Gallagher P.J. de Lanerolle P. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 481-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar), and EGF stimulation of the EGF receptor activates the p42/44 MAP kinase (44Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14553-14556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Blenis J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5889-5892Crossref PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). Initially, we were somewhat surprised that EGF-stimulated α2-cytoplasmic domain-dependent migration was independent of the p42/44 MAP kinase pathway. These results suggest the potential cross-talk between the R-Ras pathway and the EGF-stimulated α2-cytoplasmic domain-dependent migration. During completion of the study reported here, Ivaska et al.(22Ivaska J. Reunanen H. Westermarck J. Koivisto L. Kahari V.M. Heino J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 401-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) reported that α2β1 integrin-mediated up-regulation of collagen gene expression in three-dimensional collagen gels was mediated by p38 MAP kinase and required the α2-cytoplasmic domain. Our findings support an important and unique role for the α2-cytoplasmic domain in mediating activation of p38 MAP kinase activation. Our findings extend the earlier studies to include a role for p38 MAP kinase in mediating cellular migration on two-dimensional collagen substrates. Our results demonstrate that the collagen-α2β1 integrin interaction is sufficient to mediate p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation. Changes in cell shape are not sufficient for p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation and activation since both the X2C2 and X2C1 transfectants spread in a similar manner. One attractive model by which the α2-tail may activate p38 MAPK places the α2-cytoplasmic domain upstream of the small G proteins Cdc42 and/or Rac1. Ivaska et al. (22Ivaska J. Reunanen H. Westermarck J. Koivisto L. Kahari V.M. Heino J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 401-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) suggested that Cdc42 was responsible for α2-cytoplasmic domain-stimulated p38 MAP kinase phosphorylation. Since both Cdc42 and Rac1 have been shown to activate the p38 MAP kinase pathway and stimulate carcinoma cell invasion and migration (29Keely P.J. Westwick J.K. Whitehead I.P. Der C.J. Parise L.V. Nature. 1997; 390: 632-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (650) Google Scholar, 30Shaw L.M. Rabinovitz I. Wang H.H. Toker A. Mercurio A.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 949-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar), we evaluated the role of both Cdc42 and Rac1 in α2β1integrin-dependent migration on collagen. Migration studies using a series of stable cell lines expressing either constitutively active or dominant negative Cdc42 or Rac1 identified Rac1 as an important mediator of cell migration. In contrast to the findings of Ivaska et al. (22Ivaska J. Reunanen H. Westermarck J. Koivisto L. Kahari V.M. Heino J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 401-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) expression of either constitutively active or dominant negative Cdc42 failed to significantly alter α2-cytoplasmic domain-dependent unstimulated or EGF-stimulated migration (data not shown). On the other hand, expression of constitutively active Rac1 augmented migration and activation of p38 MAP kinase. Furthermore, expression of dominant negative Rac1 greatly diminished the EGF-stimulated chemotaxis. Dominant negative Rac1 had no effect on low level, unstimulated α2-cytoplasmic domain-dependent migration. In the alternative model to that proposed by Ivaska et al.(22Ivaska J. Reunanen H. Westermarck J. Koivisto L. Kahari V.M. Heino J. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 401-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), Rac1 would act, not as a downstream effector of the α2-cytoplasmic domain to p38 MAPK, but in a parallel pathway that also activates p38 MAPK. In this case, Rac1 synergizes with the α2-cytoplasmic domain to stimulate migration of epithelial cells in a manner similar to that by which lysophosphatidic acid activation of Rho synergizes with EGF and platelet-derived growth factor to stimulate migration of fibroblasts (46Sakai T. de la Pena M. Mosher D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15480-15486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cooperative signals from the extracellular matrix and growth factors are required for cells to progress through the cell cycle and to migrate (47Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O.

In contrast myoblasts expressing the α5 integrin subunit or the α6-extracellular domain/α5-cytoplasmic domain subunit (X6C5) proliferated but failed to differentiate in response to serum or growth factors (49Sastry S.K.

In the chorioallantoic membrane model, basic fibroblast growth factor or tumor necrosis factor-α-induced angiogenesis depends on the αvβ3 integrin, but vascular endothelial cell growth factor, transforming growth factor-α, or phorbol ester-induced angiogenesis depend on the αvβ5 integrin (51Friedlander M.

Vascular endothelial cell growth factor-induced angiogenesis requires members of thesrc kinase family, whereas basic fibroblast growth factor signals do not (41Eliceiri B.P. Paul R. Schwartzberg P.L.

Therefore, in angiogenesis, responses to specific growth factors are linked to and are dependent upon the expression of specific integrin receptors. In summary, the results reported here demonstrate that the ability of the α2β1 integrin to mediate a migratory phenotype requires the cytoplasmic domain of the α2-subunit. Signals uniquely mediated by the α2-, but not the α1, cytoplasmic domain lead to phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase and Jun kinase. This study is the first to demonstrate the activation of the p38 MAP kinase and not the Jun kinase pathway is necessary for α2β1 integrin-mediated cell migration and EGF-stimulated chemotaxis. The α1 integrin cytoplasmic domain did not mediate these signals, but migratory activity and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK was rescued by expression of constitutively active Rac1 in the X2C1 transfectants. These results begin to dissect the complex mechanisms by which the α1 and α2 integrin cytoplasmic domains, in concert with signals from growth factors, exert profound influences on cell phenotype.

In Rat1 and Balb/c3T3 fibroblasts and in neurons the IGF-I receptor is coupled to an inhibitory G protein, Gi, which mediates Gβγ-dependent MAP kinase activation. The present study determined whether in normal human intestinal smooth muscle cells the IGF-I receptor activates a heterotrimeric G protein and the role of G protein activation in mediating IGF-I-induced growth. IGF-I elicited IGF-I receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, resulting in the specific activation of Gi2. Gβγ subunits selectively mediated IGF-I-dependent MAP kinase activation; Gαi2 subunits selectively mediated IGF-I-dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase actvity. IGF-I-stimulated MAP kinase activation and growth were inhibited by pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of Gi/Goactivation. Cyclic AMP inhibits growth of human intestinal muscle cells. IGF-I inhibited both basal and forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels. This inhibition was attenuated in the presence of pertussis toxin. IGF-I stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation, in contrast to MAP kinase activation, occurred independently of Gi2 activation. These data suggest that IGF-I specifically activates Gi2, resulting in concurrent Gβγ-dependent stimulation of MAP kinase activity and growth, and Gαi2-dependent inhibition of cAMP levels resulting in disinhibition of cAMP-mediated growth suppression.

Three proteins have been identified which are rapidly recruited to the membrane after IGF-I receptor tyrosine phosphorylation: insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1/2, Src-homology/collagen (Shc), and CT-10-regulated kinase (8Hernandez-Sanchez C.

Through these substrates IGF-I mediates activation of two main signaling cascades, the MAP kinase and PI 3-kinase pathways, which can act either in conjunction, in opposition, or individually to mediate the response to IGF-I whether proliferative, transforming, or anti-apoptotic (6Parrizas M.

In Rat1 fibroblasts IGF-I activates a pertussis toxin (PTx)-sensitive heterotrimeric G protein leading to Gβγ-mediated, Ras-dependent MAP kinase stimulation (13Luttrell L.M. van Beisen T. Hawes B.E.

The signal is transmitted by Gβγ subunits dissociated from an IGF-I-activated inhibitory (PTx-sensitive) G protein. This mechanism of ras-dependent MAP kinase activation is shared by both the IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinases and G protein-coupled receptors, such as the lysophosphatidic acid receptors (13Luttrell L.M. van Beisen T.

Activation of either receptor tyrosine kinases or the G protein-coupled receptors induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of docking proteins, e.g. Shc and Grb2, which function as membrane scaffolds for the recruitment of Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factors, e.g. mSOS, that regulate Ras activity. The regulation of Ras activity by this pathway has further been shown to involve the participation of either Src family nonreceptor tyrosine kinases or focal adhesion kinases depending on the ligand and the cell type examined (15Selbie L.A.

IGF-II acting through its cognate IGF-II/mannose 6-phosphate receptor stimulates growth and metabolic effects. Coupling of this receptor to the inhibitory heterotrimeric G protein, Gi2, has also been described in both membranes derived from mouse Balb/3T3 fibroblasts and COS cells transfected with IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor cDNA (17Nishimoto I. Muruyama Y. Katada T. Ui M. Ogata E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14029-14038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Okamoto T. Nishimoto I. Muruyama Y. Ohkuni Y. Ogata E. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1995; 270: 29224-29228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation by IGF-II, but not by Man-6-P, the activated IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor interacts with Gi2 through the Arg2410-Lys2423 sequence in its C-terminal intracellular domain (19Ikezu T. Okamoto T. Giambarella U. Yokota T. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29224-29228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In contrast to IGF-I-induced IGF-I receptor activation where MAP kinase stimulation is Gβγ-dependent, IGF-II-induced activation of the IGF-II/Man-6-P receptor results in Gαi2-dependent inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity, an effect only potentiated by the Gβγ subunits derived from Gi2activation (19Ikezu T.

Human intestinal smooth muscle cells produce IGF-I, which plays a autocrine role in the regulation of growth in culture (20Kuemmerle J.F. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 817-824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In these cells IGF-I-stimulated growth is mediated by activation of distinct MAP kinase-dependent and PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling cascades (21Kuemmerle J.F. Bushman T.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 175: G151-G158Google Scholar). Whether IGF-I-stimulated MAP kinase activation and growth in these cells involve the activation of a heterotrimeric G protein, and the roles of the G protein subunits in mediating this effect are not known. The specific G protein activated by IGF-I and the roles of the α and βγ subunits derived from G protein activation on growth have not been examined. In the present study we show that IGF-I specifically activates the PTx-sensitive inhibitory G protein, Gi2. Gi2activation results in concurrent Gβγ-dependent stimulation of MAP kinase activity and growth, and Gαi2-dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activation, cAMP production and results in disinhibition of cAMP-mediated growth suppression. Muscle cells were isolated from the circular muscle layer of human jejunum as described previously (20Kuemmerle J.F. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 817-824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 21Kuemmerle J.F. Bushman T.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 175: G151-G158Google Scholar). Segments of normal jejunum were obtained from patients undergoing surgery according to a protocol approved by the Institutional Committee on the Conduct of Human Research. Briefly, muscle cells were isolated by enzymatic digestion for 60 min at 31 °C in a medium containing 0.2% collagenase (CLS type II) and 0.1% soybean trypsin inhibitor. The medium consisted of (in mm): 120 NaCl, 4 KCl, 2.6 KH2PO4, 2 CaCl2, 0.6 MgCl2, 25 HEPES, 14 glucose, and 2.1% Eagle's essential amino acid mixture. Primary cultures of human intestinal muscle cells were initiated and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (DMEM-10) and containing 200 units/ml penicillin, 200 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 μg/ml gentamycin, and 2 μg/ml amphotericin B. The cells were plated at a concentration of 5 × 105 cells/ml and incubated in a 10% CO2 environment at 37 °C. All subsequent studies were performed in first passage cultured cells after 7 days, at which time the cells were confluent. Proliferation of smooth muscle cells in culture was measured by the incorporation of [3H]thymidine as described previously (20Kuemmerle J.F. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 817-824Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 21Kuemmerle J.F. Bushman T.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 175: G151-G158Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed free of serum and incubated for 24 h in DMEM-0. After a 24-h incubation in the absence of serum, the cells were incubated for an additional 24 h with a maximally effective concentration of IGF-I (100 nm) in the presence and absence of various test agents. During the final 4 h of this incubation period, 1 μCi/ml [3H]thymidine was added to the medium. [3H]Thymidine incorporation into the perchloric acid-extractrable pool was used as a measure of DNA synthesis. DNA content was measured fluorometrically using Hoescht 33528 with excitation at 356 nm and emission at 492 nm. Calf thymus DNA was used as a standard. [3H]Thymidine incorporation was expressed as cpm/ng DNA. G proteins selectively activated by IGF-I were identified by the method of Okamotoet al. (22Okamoto T. Ikezu T. Muruyama Y. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. FEBS Lett. 1992; 305: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) as described previously by us (23Murthy K.S. Coy D.H. Makhlouf G.M. J. Biol.

Confluent human intestinal muscle cells growing in 100-mm dishes were scraped off the plate and homogenized in 20 mm HEPES medium (pH 7.4) containing 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, and 2 mm dithiothreitol. After centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 15 min, the crude membranes were solubilized for 60 min at 4 °C in 20 mmHEPES medium (pH 7.4) containing 2 mm EDTA, 240 mm NaCl, and 1% CHAPS. The membranes were incubated for 20 min with 60 nm [35S]GTPγS in a solution containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 100 μm EDTA, and 10 mm MgCl2. The reaction was stopped with 10 volumes of 100 mm Tris-HCl medium (pH 8.0) containing 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 20 μm GTP, and the mixture was placed in wells precoated with specific G protein antibodies. After incubation for 2 h on ice, the wells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, and radioactivity from each well was counted. Coating with G protein antibodies (1:1,000) was done after the wells were coated with anti-rabbit IgG (1:1,000) for 2 h on ice. The selective IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, tyrphostin AG 1024 (100 μm) (26Parrizas M. Gazit A. Levitzki A. Wertheimer E. LeRoith D. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1427-1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), was used to identify to role of IGF-I receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation in G protein activation. Binding of IGF-I to the IGF-I receptor results in tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-I receptor β subunit (IGF-IRβ). Tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-IRβ was measured by immunoprecipitation of the IGF-IRβ and subsequent Western blotting of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins. Confluent muscle cells growing in 100-mm plates were incubated in serum-free DMEM for 72 h. The cells were stimulated for 2 min with increasing concentrations (1–100 nm) of IGF-I, IGF-II, and del(1–6)IGF-II, a synthetic IGF-II agonist that does not interact with IGF-binding proteins (33Francis G.L. Aplin S.E. Milner S.J. McNeil K.A. Ballard F.J. Wallace J.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 293: 719Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer consisting of phosphate-buffered saline with added 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% (w/v) aprotinin, and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Cell lysates containing equal amounts of protein were incubated with 2 μg/ml antibody to the IGF-IRβ for 2 h at 4 °C. 20 μl of protein A/G-agarose was added, and the incubation was continued overnight. The resulting immune complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed four times in immunoprecipitation buffer. The final pellet was resuspended in 40 μl of electrophoresis sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 10% gels under reducing conditions and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were incubated overnight with a 1:1,000 dilution of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) and then for 90 min with a 1:2,000 dilution of goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase. The bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence and quantitated with densitometry. MAP kinase activity was measured as described previously (21Kuemmerle J.F. Bushman T.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 175: G151-G158Google Scholar). Briefly, confluent muscle cells growing in six-well plates were incubated in serum-free DMEM for 72 h. The cells were stimulated with 100 nm IGF-I for various time periods, 0–240 min, in the presence and absence of test agents. The cells were lysed in a buffer containing (in mm): 10 Tris (pH 7.4), 150 NaCl, 2 EGTA, 2 dithiothreitol, 1 orthovanadate, 1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, with added 10 μg/ml leupeptin and 10 μg/ml aprotinin. Cellular debris in the lysates was precipitated by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. MAP kinase activity was measured in duplicate in aliquots of cell lysate containing equal amounts of protein by the incorporation of phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP (1 μCi/30 μl of reaction volume) into a synthetic MAP kinase substrate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for a 30-min incubation at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated, and phosphorylated peptide substrate was separated using phosphocellulose microfuge spin tubes (Pierce). The results are expressed in pmol of phosphate incorporated/min/mg of protein. Confluent muscle cells growing in 100-mm dishes were permeabilized by modification of techniques described previously (23Murthy K.S. Coy D.H. Makhlouf G.M. J. Biol.

The effects of specific G protein subunits were investigated by immunoneutralization using selective antibodies to specific G protein subunits as described previously. This technique has been validated previously and used to identify the signaling mechanisms and functional effects mediated via specific G protein subunits activated by somatostatin, opioid, and muscarinic receptors on intestinal smooth muscle cells (23Murthy K.S.

Briefly, muscle cells were released from the culture plate by treatment with 0.5% (w/v) trypsin containing 0.53 mm EDTA. The cells were washed free of enzymes by centrifugation at 150 ×g and resuspended in a cytosol-like buffer containing (in mm): 20 NaCl, 100 KCl, 1 MgSO4, 25 NaHCO3, 1 EGTA, 0.18 Ca2+, and 1% IGF-I-free bovine serum albumin. Cells were permeabilized by incubation with 35 μg/ml saponin at 31 °C for 10 min. The cells were washed free of saponin by centrifugation at 150 × g and resuspended in the same medium with 1.5 mm ATP and ATP-regenerating system (5 mm creatine phosphate and 10 units/ml creatine phosphokinase). The cells were incubated for 1 h with neutralizing antibody to Gαi2 (10 μg/ml) or Gβ (10 μg/ml). The reaction was initiated by addition of 100 nm IGF-I and terminated after 10 min by placing the cells on ice. The cells were rapidly centrifuged at 150 ×g and 4 °C and the supernatant removed. The cells were resuspended in MAP kinase lysis buffer (see above), and MAP kinase activity was measured by in vitro kinase assay as described above. PI 3-kinase activity was measured by a modification of the method of Higaki et al. (28Higaki M. Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Kasuga M. Shimokodo K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29342-29346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) as described previously (21Kuemmerle J.F. Bushman T.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 175: G151-G158Google Scholar). Briefly, muscle cells grown to confluence in 100-mm dishes were incubated in serum-free DMEM for 72 h. Cells were stimulated for 10 min with 100 nm IGF-I in the presence and absence of various test agents. The cells were lysed in a buffer consisting of (in mm): 50 Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 NaCl, 1 Na2VO3, 2 EDTA, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, and 30 nm leupeptin, with added 1% (w/v) trasylol and 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. Aliquots of cell lysate containing equal amounts of protein were incubated with 25 μl of anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) coupled to agarose beads with gentle mixing for 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and washed three times with lysis buffer and two times with kinase assay buffer. Kinase assay buffer consisted of (in mm): 50 Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 50 NaCl, 2 MgCl2, and 0.5 EDTA. After the final washing the beads were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase assay buffer to which 10 μl of sonicated 1 mg/ml phosphatidylinositol was added. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 5 μl of 50 mm ATP containing 0.5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and continued for 10 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.5 ml of 1 n HCl and 2 ml of chloroform-methanol (2:1, v/v). Phospholipids were recovered from the lower organic phase and dried under N2 gas. The dried phospholipids were dissolved in chloroform and spotted on Silica H Gel TLC plates impregnated with 1% potassium oxalate. Chromatograms were developed in chloroform, methanol, 28% NH3, water (70:100:15:25, v/v). The plates were air dried and phospholipids visualized with autoradiography. The spots corresponding to authentic phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate were scraped off the plates and incorporated 32P quantified by β-scintillation counting. Results are expressed as the increase in 32P incorporation into PI-3-P in cpm above basal values. Adenylyl cyclase activity was measured by the method of Salomon et al. (29Salomon Y. Londos S. Rodbell M. Anal. Chem. 1974; 58: 541-548Google Scholar). Briefly, a 0.1-mg sample of membrane protein was incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 1 nmATP, 2 mm cAMP, 0.1 mm GTP, 0.1 mmisobutylmethylxanthine, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm creatine phosphate, 50 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 4 × 106 cpm of [3H]ATP. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2% SDS, 45 mm ATP, and 1.5 mm cAMP. [3H]cAMP was separated from [3H]ATP by sequential chromatography on Dowex AG50W-4X and alumina columns. The results were expressed as pmol of cAMP/mg of protein/min. cAMP production was measured by modification of methods described previously (23Murthy K.S. Coy D.H. Makhlouf G.M. J. Biol.

Briefly, confluent muscle cells growing in six-well plates were incubated in serum-free DMEM for 72 h. Cells were incubated for 10 min in 1 μm isobutylmethylxanthine. cAMP in the cells was stimulated by activation with 10 μm forskolin, and 100 nm IGF-I was added for an additional 5 min. The reaction was terminated using ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid in which the cells were incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were extracted three times with water-saturated diethyl ether. The resulting aqueous phase was frozen and lyophilized. The samples were reconstituted for radioimmunoassay in 500 μl of 50 mmsodium acetate (pH 6.2) and acetylated with triethylamine/acetic anhydride (3:1 v/v) for 30 min. cAMP was measured in duplicate using 100-μl aliquots and expressed as pmol/mg of protein. Values given represent the mean ± S.E. of n experiments where n represents the number of experiments on cells derived from separate primary cultures.

Phosphatidylinositol and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. IGF-I increased [3H]thymidine incorporation by 289 ± 9% above basal (basal, 34 ± 2 cpm/ng DNA) (Fig.1). The growth elicited by IGF-I was partially inhibited, 35 ± 5%, in the presence of 200 ng/ml PTx. We have shown previously that IGF-I-induced growth is mediated jointly by activation of distinct MAP kinase-dependent, PI 3-kinase-independent and a MAP kinase-independent, PI 3-kinase-dependent pathways (21Kuemmerle J.F. Bushman T.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 175: G151-G158Google Scholar). To determine whether PTx-sensitive growth elicited by IGF-I was mediated by activation of the MAP kinase-dependent or the PI 3-kinase-dependent pathways, cells were incubated with the MAP kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 (10 μm) or the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (10 μm). We have shown previously that at the concentrations used these inhibitors selectively block activation of MAP kinase and PI 3-kinase, respectively, in these cells (21Kuemmerle J.F. Bushman T.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 175: G151-G158Google Scholar). Thymidine incorporation in response to 100 nmIGF-I was partly inhibited (42 ± 4%) by the MAP kinase kinase inhibitor, partly inhibited (52 ± 3%) by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, and partly inhibited (35 ± 5%) by PTx (Fig. 1) (21Kuemmerle J.F. Bushman T.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 175: G151-G158Google Scholar,30Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The MAP kinase kinase inhibitor had only a minor additive effect to that of PTx (MAP kinase kinase inhibitor + PTx: 42 ± 10% inhibition versus PTx alone: 35 ± 5% inhibition,p = not significant) on growth stimulated by IGF-I (Fig. 1). In contrast, the addition of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor and PTx was fully additive, strongly inhibiting growth stimulated by IGF-I (PI 3-K inhibitor + PTx: 90 ± 2% versus PTx alone: 35 ± 5%, p < 0.01) (Fig. 1). These results suggest that the portion of IGF-I-induced growth mediated by activation of the MAP kinase pathway was sensitive to PTx, whereas the portion mediated by activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway was insensitive to PTx. IGF-II and insulin were also examined for their ability to stimulate growth of these cells. 100 nm IGF-II increased [3H]thymidine incorporation by 40 ± 25% above basal, and 100 nm insulin increased [3H]thymidine incorporation by 35 ± 15% above basal values. The increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation elicited by IGF-II or insulin, however, was not inhibited in the presence of PTx (38 ± 8 and 36 ± 20% above basal, respectively). The rank order of potency of these three peptides to stimulate growth, IGF-I > IGF-II > insulin, implied that the growth stimulated by IGF-I reflected predominantly activation of its cognate IGF-I receptor. The ability of IGF-I and IGF-II to stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of the IGF-IRβ was examined in anti-phosphotyrosine Western blots of IGF-IRβ immunoprec"

Overexpression of the retinoblastoma protein together with YY1 blocked this effect. In growth-arrested cells, YY1 resides in a complex with the retinoblastoma protein, but the complex is not detected in serum-stimulated S phase cultures, indicating that the interaction of the retinoblastoma protein and YY1 is cell cycle-regulated. Recombinant retinoblastoma protein directly interacts with YY1, destabilizing the interaction of YY1 with DNA and inhibiting its transcription initiator function <i>in vitro</i>. We conclude that in differentiated cells elevation of the nuclear level of YY1 protein favors progression into the S phase, and we propose that this activity is regulated by its interaction with the retinoblastoma protein."

Information, however, regarding the physical properties of cationic lipid-DNA complexes necessary for efficient transfection of cells both in vitro and in vivo is incomplete. Characterization of the size and electrokinetic potential of these complexes has resulted in some understanding of their colloidal properties as they relate to the efficiency of transfection (6Birchall J.C.

Results from these studies suggest the formation of multilammellar, liquid crystalline phases of the lipid, with DNA sandwiched in between.

FTIR and Raman scattering have the potential to provide significant detail about the fine structure of both cationic lipids and DNA upon complexation without the use of extrinsic probes. In the case of lipids, these vibrationally based spectroscopic techniques have been used to characterize the degree of conformational disorder of the apolar region of membranes (21Mendelsohn R.

In general, the potential utility of vibrational methods to characterize complexes of cationic lipids with DNA is probably greater than other spectroscopic techniques because of reduced effects of light scattering, applicability to heterogeneous systems, and the plethora of resolvable peaks from each component. No such studies, however, have yet been reported. Therefore, we have used FTIR spectroscopy to characterize the interaction of cationic and helper lipids with DNA. DOTAP, DDAB, DOPE, and Chol (Fig.1) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. (Alabaster, AL) and used without further purification. Plasmid pMB113 (>95% supercoiled) encoding the wild-type cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator was obtained from Valentis, Inc. (Burlingame, CA). The concentration of DNA was determined by UV absorbance at 260 nm using an extinction coefficient of 0.02 (mg/ml)−1 cm−1 Cationic lipids were deposited on the wall of glass vials from chloroform solutions by evaporating the solvent under a stream of nitrogen gas. The film obtained was then placed under vacuum for 2 h prior to being hydrated in 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4, at a temperature above the T c of the lipid for 30–60 min (Room temperature for DOTAP and 70 °C for DDAB). Vesicles were then extruded 10 times through 100 nm Nuclepore membranes (Whatman, Clifton, NJ). Liposomes were stored at 4 °C and used within 3 days of preparation. Lipid-DNA complexes were prepared in a total volume of 0.6 ml using various weight ratios of lipid to DNA. Complexes were prepared by mixing equal volumes of solutions containing lipid or DNA (2 mg/ml), with the solution containing the lesser molar concentration of charge (DNA phosphate or cationic lipid) being added to the solution in charge excess. The resulting complexes were continuously stirred for 10 min and equilibrated at room temperature for 20 min before measurement. FTIR spectra were obtained with a Nicolet Magna-IR 560 spectrometer equipped with a mercury-cadmium-telluride detector (Nicolet, Madison, WI). Samples were measured by an attenuated total internal reflectance method in which the sample in solution was placed directly in a zinc selenide trough (Thermal A.R.K., SpectraTech, Shelton, CT). Although the use of attenuated total internal reflectance opens up the possibility that the material observed near the surface of the attenuated total internal reflectance element may be structurally perturbed by surface adsorption, spectra obtained in a conventional transmittance cell were found to be very similar. Spectra were obtained under dry air purge by coaddition of 256 interferograms. The interferograms were apodized using the Happ-Genzel function, with no zero filling, to give a final resolution of 4 cm−1. For attenuated total internal reflectance experiments, the association band of water around 2200 cm−1 was used as a reference for subtraction of water from the spectra (28Alex S. Dupuis P. Inorg. Chim. Acta. 1989; 157: 271-281Crossref Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Base-line correction (1804 to 904 cm−1) and seven point Satvitsky-Golay smoothing were applied to all spectra. Peak positions were assigned using a peak finding algorithm provided with the OmnicTM software. Spectra were obtained from several, independently prepared sample preparations (including at least three different lots of DNA and lipid) and averaged. Error bars reflect the standard error of the mean (n = 6–9 samples). A Brookhaven (Holtsville, NY) BI-200SM system with a 50 mW HeNe laser was used for all measurements. Measurements were taken at 90° to the incident light. Samples were prepared by diluting the samples prepared for FTIR measurements 10-fold with Tris buffer that had been exhaustively filtered through a 0.2-μm filter (AcrodiscTM). Data were collected over a period of 3 min. An electronic “dust filter” was used to exclude 2-s intervals of data whose average intensity differed by 30% of the average for the 3-min interval. The mean diffusion coefficients were obtained from the autocorrelation function using the method of cumulants (29Koppel D.E. J. Chem. Phys. 1962; 57: 4814Crossref Scopus (2730) Google Scholar). The effective diameter was calculated using the Stokes-Einstein equation. A ZetaPALS instrument (Brookhaven) was used to measure the electrophoretic mobility of the complexes using samples prepared as above. Measurements were obtained using an electric field strength of 14–16 V/cm, which was reversed at a frequency of 3–5 Hz. Data were averaged over 30 cycles. The ζ potential of the particles was calculated from the electrophoretic mobility using the Smoluchowski approximation. Approximately 35 well defined DNA absorption bands occur in the region from 1800–700 cm−1 (30Taillandier E. Liquier J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 307-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). A representative spectrum of the plasmid used in these studies is shown in Fig. 2. Several bands in this spectrum are representative of B-form DNA. The guanine/thymidine carbonyl stretching band at 1715 cm−1, indicative of interstrand base pairing, the asymmetric phosphate stretching band at 1223 cm−1, and the band at 970 cm−1, resulting from a 2′-endo deoxyribose conformation, are the most prominent and consistent indicators of B-form DNA in our hands. Additionally, bands at 1328, 1281, and 897 cm−1(the latter not shown) further support the conclusion that the plasmid remains in the B-form (30Taillandier E. Liquier J. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 307-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Despite water subtraction, the spectral regions between 1700 and 1600 cm−1 and below ∼850 cm−1 are still partially obscured by the presence of the O-H bending vibrations of water. Although some data regarding base pairing/stacking is unavailable in the spectral regions dominated by water, a significant amount of data is still available in the region above 1700 cm−1 and between 1600 and 850 cm−1. We have found most useful the changes in three DNA vibrational bands related to the base carbonyls (1715 cm−1), the imidazole nitrogen of guanine (1492 cm−1), and the phosphate backbone (1223 cm−1). The spectrum of the cationic lipid DOTAP is also shown in Fig. 2(A and B). As seen from the structure of DOTAP in Fig. 1, the main structural features include an unsaturated hydrocarbon side chain resulting in asymmetric and symmetric methylene C-H stretching bands at 2924 and 2854 cm−1 (Fig.2 A) and various methylene bending bands between 1470 and 1100 cm−1 (Fig. 2 B). The ester portion of DOTAP gives rise to a carbonyl stretching band at 1739 cm−1, while the trimethylammonium headgroup produces a weak band at 1489 cm−1 (asymmetric C-N stretching). Because these were key structural changes, the methylene C-H and carbonyl stretching bands were followed upon formation of complexes with DNA. Similarly, DDAB, the cationic lipid found in the transfection reagent LipofectACETM was also studied. As predicted from the structure of DDAB (Fig. 1), a much simpler spectrum is observed because of the absence of C-O vibrations (compare Fig. 2, B–D). Additionally, DDAB contains saturated alkyl chains that increase its Lβ to Lα phase transition to between 40 and 50 °C. DDAB vesicles show the methylene C-H stretching vibrations at 2918 (asymmetric) and 2850 cm−1 (symmetric) (Fig.2 C). Other major bands observed include methylene bending vibrations from 1470 to 1100 cm−1 and a characteristic C-N asymmetric stretching band at 1489 cm−1 from the ammonium group (Fig. 2 D). Again, because of their sensitivity to DNA binding, methylene C-H stretching bands were followed to monitor complex formation between DDAB and DNA. Given the distinct assignments of the signals from the DNA and lipid discussed above, several bands were monitored as cationic lipids were added to a fixed amount of DNA at various weight ratios. Representative spectra of several complexes at various weight ratios are shown in Fig. 2 (A andB). Changes in the vibrational bands of DNA were followed as the ratio of DOTAP to DNA was varied. The carbonyl stretching band, reflecting interstrand hydrogen bonding, manifests a quasi-linear increase from 1715 to 1719 cm−1 with a discontinuity in the trend observed around a 0.5 weight ratio (Fig.3 D). The guanine/cytosine vibration at 1492 cm−1 shows a linear decrease to 1489.5 cm−1, saturating at a weight ratio of 0.6 as increasing amounts of DOTAP are added (Fig. 3 E). The DNA asymmetric phosphate stretching band manifests a saturable increase in frequency as DOTAP is added, going from 1223 to 1226.5 cm−1 with the spectral shift complete at a ratio of 0.5 (Fig. 3 F). In contrast, the frequency of the symmetric phosphate stretching vibration remains constant at ∼1089 cm−1 (data not shown). Although distinct changes in several of the DNA vibrations are noted, the presence of bands around 1715 and 1223 and at 1328, 1281, and 970 cm−1 all suggest that DNA remains in a B conformation. Several reproducible spectral changes were also observed in DOTAP vibrational modes upon complexation with DNA (Figs. 2, A andB, and 3, A–C). Both the asymmetric and symmetric methylene C-H stretching bands show identical trends exhibiting subtle increases in frequency compared with that of DOTAP alone (2923.7 and 2854 cm−1, respectively; Fig. 3,A and B). Less systematic but reproducible variations in peak positions are also seen at lower charge ratios. The carbonyl stretching vibration of DOTAP shows a gradual decrease from 1743.5 to 1737 cm−1 with increasing lipid, which saturates above a 0.7 weight ratio (Fig. 3 C). When DDAB is added to DNA at various weight ratios, discrete changes are also observed in the vibrational frequencies of several bands from both the lipid and DNA (Figs. 2, C and D, and 3, G–K). As seen with DOTAP, the spectral features of the DNA around 1715, 1223, 1328, 1281, and 970 cm−1 suggest that the DNA remains in the B-form at all ratios of DDAB to DNA. Several trends for the DNA signals parallel those seen for complexes of DOTAP and DNA (Fig. 3,I–K). The frequency of the base pairing sensitive carbonyl stretching band shows a slight increase as DNA is titrated with increasing amounts of DDAB (Fig. 3 I), albeit to a much lesser extent than observed for DOTAP complexes (Fig. 3 D). The most distinctive feature is a small optimum in frequency shift of ∼1 cm−1 seen at low weight ratios (∼0.5; Fig.3 I). The band at 1492 cm−1 is strongly altered at low lipid-DNA weight ratios, dropping 3 cm−1 to 1489 cm−1 at a 0.5 ratio, followed by a more gradual decline (Fig. 3 J). The phosphate asymmetric stretching band shows a trend similar to that observed for DOTAP complexes, in which it gradually increases from 1223 to 1225 cm−1 as DDAB is added up to a ratio of 0.5–0.7 (Fig. 3 K). Both the asymmetric and symmetric C-H stretching bands of DDAB show a decrease in frequency beginning at low lipid ratios (0.2 to 0.25) from 2921 to 2919 cm−1 and 2852 to 2851 cm−1, respectively (Fig. 3, G and H). Helper lipids such as Chol and DOPE have been shown to significantly improve the transfection efficiency of vectors employing cationic lipids (3Crook K. Stevenson B.J. Dubouchet M. Porteous D.J. Gene Ther. 1998; 5: 137-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 4Liu Y. Mounkes L.C. Liggitt H.D. Brown C.S. Solodin I. Heath T.D. Debs R.J. Nat.

This effect is presumably due to the altered membrane properties upon addition of helper lipid. Therefore, the effect of these lipids on the cationic membrane structure itself, as well as on the interaction of these binary lipid bilayers with DNA, was monitored using FTIR spectroscopy by varying the amount of helper lipid included in the lipid dispersion prior to complexation. For complexes of lipid with DNA, a constant 1:1 weight ratio of cationic lipid to DNA was used in all cases. Overall, the incorporation of Chol or DOPE into either DOTAP or DDAB liposomes did not appear to alter the DNA conformation from that of the B-form as evidenced by the presence of the marker bands at 1715, 1328, 1281, 1223, and 970 cm−1, but discrete changes in several lipid and DNA signals were observed (Fig. 4, solid lines). The effects of Chol on the spectral properties of liposomes alone are also shown (Fig. 4, dashed lines). The spectral properties of DNA in complexes with DOTAP exhibited minor changes when the mole fraction of Chol is increased (Fig. 4, D–F). For DDAB-DNA complexes containing Chol, only the DNA carbonyl band shows a substantial change in frequency as a function of Chol content (Fig. 4 I). Changes in vibrations arising from the lipids as a function of the molar ratio of Chol to cationic lipid are also shown in Fig. 4. For lipid vesicles alone, as the Chol to DOTAP molar ratio is increased, the asymmetric C-H stretching band increased from 2924 to 2926 cm−1 and appears to saturate at a very small amount of Chol in the bilayer (<0.1 Chol:DOTAP; Fig. 4 A). The complementary symmetric stretching vibration showed a similar sharp increase from 2853.3 to 2854.5 cm−1, followed by a gradual decrease to 2853.5 cm−1 at a molar ratio of 1 (Fig.4 B). The DOTAP carbonyl stretching vibration at 1739 cm−1 showed a similar trend to that seen in the C-H asymmetric stretching band, with an increase in frequency of ∼3 cm−1 upon addition of Chol to the membrane (Fig.4 C). When complexes with DNA were prepared at a 1:1 weight ratio with DOTAP using liposomes with varying amounts of Chol, the lipid carbonyl band was shifted to lower frequencies, whereas the C-H stretching bands were relatively unaffected. Incorporating Chol into DDAB vesicles also results in frequency changes in lipid C-H stretching bands as shown in Fig. 4 (G andH, dashed lines). Upon addition of as little as 10 mol% of Chol into the vesicles, an increase of ∼1 cm−1 in the C-H stretching bands was observed, similar to that seen for DOTAP (Fig. 4, A and B). Further incorporation of Chol results in an additional increase in the frequency of the asymmetric C-H stretching band from 2919 to 2921 cm−1, whereas the symmetric stretching band shows a minimal increase of 0.5 cm−1 up to a Chol/DDAB molar ratio of 1. The trends are comparable when the vesicles are complexed with DNA, with the notable exception of complexes formed in the absence of Chol. Of the bands arising from DNA, only the frequency of the guanine/thymidine carbonyl stretching band showed a significant change with increasing mole fraction of DOPE for both cationic lipids used (Fig. 5, D–J). Although a 2-cm−1 increase was observed in this band for DOTAP complexes, a 4.5-cm−1 increase in frequency was observed for DDAB complexes, with both shifts saturating at 1720 cm−1. The effect of DOPE on the C-H stretching bands for DOTAP vesicles is seen as a distinct 2-cm−1 increase in frequency to 2925 and 2854.2 cm−1. (Fig. 5, A and B). DOPE alone displays these vibrational modes at 2924 and 2853.4 cm−1 (data not shown), suggesting a slight increase in the mobility of the alkyl groups of the lipids. As observed previously with Chol, the addition of DNA did not cause any further shifts for all ratios of DOPE to DOTAP examined with the exception of the complex formed in the absence of DOPE (compare solid anddashed lines in Fig. 5, A and B). An upward shift in the frequency of the lipid carbonyl stretching band was observed with increasing amounts of DOPE incorporated into the DOTAP vesicles (Fig. 5 C). These results are somewhat confounded by the fact that DOPE possesses a carbonyl stretching band itself. This band is located around 1737 cm−1 for a dispersion of DOPE alone, which is 5 cm−1 lower than the frequencies observed here. Upon complexation of the DOTAP-DOPE vesicles with DNA, a consistent decrease in the frequency of this band of 1–2 cm−1 was observed at all ratios. The effect of incorporating DOPE into DDAB vesicles is shown in Fig. 5(G–I). The methylene C-H stretching bands of the lipid show increases in frequency to 2853 and 2924 cm−1 once DOPE is added above a molar ratio of 0.25 (Fig. 5, G andH). The presence of DNA at a 1:1 weight ratio with DDAB does not affect these bands significantly. The carbonyl stretching vibration of the DOPE is observed at 1736 cm−1 when it is added to DDAB vesicles at a molar ratio of 0.1 (Fig. 5 I). An abrupt increase in frequency was seen at ratios above 0.5, indicating lipid mobility comparable with that seen for DOPE alone (1737 cm−1). When complexed to DNA, the DOPE carbonyl stretching band shows an overall decrease in frequency relative to free lipid as the ratio of DOPE to DOTAP, and hence DOPE to DNA phosphate, is increased (Fig. 5 I). This decrease in frequency is similar to the trend observed for the lipid carbonyl stretching vibration in DOTAP complexes in which the ratio of DOTAP to DNA is increased (compare Figs. 5 I and 3 C). To further follow the assembly of the complexes formed between cationic lipids and DNA under the conditions of the FTIR studies, the mean hydrodynamic diameter and ζ potential of the particles were monitored by dynamic light scattering and phase analysis light scattering, respectively (Fig. 6,A and B). The size of complexes of DOTAP with DNA remains fairly constant (150 nm) until a ratio of 0.33 is reached, at which point a gradual increase in size is observed up to a weight ratio of 1.5 (Fig. 6 A). This size increase appears to occur in two phases with the second phase initiated at a weight ratio of 0.5. Beyond this point, the complexes have an estimated size much greater than 1 μm, making it immposible to accurately determine the hydrodynamic radius by dynamic light scattering. Fortunately, complexes prepared at ratios above 1.5 could be examined by phase analysis light scattering to determine ζ potential. Phase analysis light scattering analysis of these complexes indicates a fairly constant negative ζ potential between −40 and −60 mV up to a weight ratio of 2 (Fig.6 B). Beyond this ratio, the ζ potential gradually increases to values of +20 mV at a ratio of 4. These data demonstrate that the DOTAP-DNA complexes studied by FTIR spectroscopy all possess negative ζ potentials. The size and ζ potential of DDAB-DNA complexes were also determined (Fig. 6, A and B). The size of DDAB-DNA complexes remains relatively constant at around 220 nm as lipid is added up to a 0.6 weight ratio (Fig. 6 A). Above this point, aggregation of the complexes occurs resulting in particles greater than 1 μm in diameter. The ζ potential shows a similar trend to that observed for DOTAP complexes. It is interesting that despite the larger hydrodynamic size of the DDAB-DNA complexes, their ζ potentials are very similar to that of DOTAP-DNA complexes. The colloidal properties of complexes upon incorporation of the helper lipids Chol and DOPE are shown in Fig. 6 (C–F). For DOTAP complexes, addition of Chol results in only a minor increase in size from 185 to 215 nm (Fig. 6 C). DDAB-Chol complexes demonstrate an average diameter that is roughly twice as large as the DOTAP-Chol complexes (compare Fig. 6, E and C). As the amount of Chol increases, the colloidal stability of the DDAB complexes is greatly increased, i.e. in the absence of Chol, DDAB complexes form particles greater than 1 μm in diameter. Above a Chol to DDAB molar ratio of 0.5, the size appears to decrease from 400 nm to around 300 nm (Fig. 6 E). When DOPE-DOTAP vesicles are complexed with DNA, a smaller particle size is observed (Fig.6 C). The size remains fairly constant up to a DOPE to DOTAP ratio of 0.75, above which the diameter gradually increases. In contrast, the size of DDAB-DOPE complexes remains between 150 and 180 nm for all ratios of DOPE to DDAB, again showing a marked stabilizing effect of helper lipid on the DDAB-DNA complexes. In general, complexes of cationic lipid and DNA (in the absence of helper lipid) at a 1:1 weight ratio possess negative ζ potentials (Fig. 6 B). The ζ potential of complexes containing both cationic and helper lipid all show similar trends regardless of the cationic or helper lipid used (Fig. 6, D–F). Surprisingly, as the amount of helper lipid in the complex is increased, the ζ potential decreases despite constant quantities of cationic lipid. The greatest decrease occurs for DDAB-DOPE complexes that exhibit a 2-fold decrease in the magnitude of the ζ potential. Attempts to study the helical conformation of DNA upon complexation with cationic lipids using ultraviolet circular dichroism have led to the suggestion by several authors that upon complexation with cationic lipids, DNA adopts a form (e.g. C conformation) rather than the native B conformation (31Akao T. Fukumoto T. Ihara H. Ito A. FEBS Lett. 1996; 391: 215-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Possible spectral contributions of chiral supramolecular aggregates (18Zuidam N.J. Barenholz Y.

SNAREs associate by formation of a parallel four-helix bundle, and it has been suggested that formation of this complex promotes membrane fusion.

Eukaryotic cells transport cargo between different intracellular compartments, and release selective cargo into the extracellular space. This task requires that transport vesicles bud from the membranes of organelles and fuse specifically with target membranes. An extensively studied example of this process is synaptic vesicle exocytosis, in which neurotransmitter-filled vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane of a presynaptic neuron to release neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft (1Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 3250-3262Crossref Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). The process of directed docking and fusion of vesicles is mediated by several proteins; these include the soluble NSF 1The abbreviations used are:NSFN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factorSNARESNAP receptorv-SNAREvesicle SNAREt-SNAREtarget SNAREβ-Meβ-mercaptoethanolMADmultiwavelength anomalous dispersionPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisCDcircular dichroismGSTglutathione S-transferaser.m.s.d.root mean square deviationSNAPsoluble NSF attachment protein attachment proteins (SNAPs), the SNAP receptor proteins (SNAREs) NSF, Sec1 proteins, and the Rab small GTPases.

SNAREs are associated with vesicle (v-SNARE) and target (t-SNARE) membranes and can interact with each other by forming stable four-helix bundles (SNARE complexes). The synaptic vesicle v-SNARE VAMP2 contains a small cytoplasmic domain followed by a C-terminal transmembrane anchor, and the cytoplasmic domain is largely unstructured in isolation (2Fasshauer D. Otto H. Eliason W.K. Jahn R. Brunger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28036-28041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 3Hazzard J. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 14: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The t-SNARE SNAP-25 is attached to the plasma membrane via palmitoylation of four cysteine residues and displays a significant amount of disorder in isolation in solution (2Fasshauer D. Otto H.

Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4582-4590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). However, both VAMP2 and SNAP-25 adopt helical conformations when part of the SNARE complex. The t-SNARE syntaxin 1a consists of an N-terminal domain termed Habc, a region of ∼9 kDa termed H3, and a C-terminal transmembrane anchor. The Habc domain is a three-helix bundle (5Fernandez I. Ubach J. Dulubova I. Zhang X. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J. Cell. 1998; 94: 841-849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 6Lerman J.C. Robblee J. Fairman R. Hughson F.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8470-8479Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and the H3 region forms an amphipathic helix that associates with either partner SNAREs or the Habc domain (7Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar, 8Misura K.M.S. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). The three SNARE proteins have a modest affinity for each other in binary complexes (∼1 μm), but the ternary SNAP-25·VAMP2·syntaxin 1a SNARE complex is extremely stable (9Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). The x-ray crystal structure of the “core” SNARE complex, which consists of the cytoplasmic portion of VAMP2, two fragments of SNAP-25, and the H3 region of syntaxin 1a, reveals that these three proteins form a 110-Å-long parallel four-helix bundle (7Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). Syntaxin 1a H3 and VAMP2 each contribute one helix to the complex, and SNAP-25 contributes two helices. When bound to the regulatory protein nSec1, syntaxin 1a exists as a four-helix bundle (8Misura K.M.S. Scheller R.H. Weis W.I. Nature. 2000; 404: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). The N-terminal half of H3 contributes one helix to the bundle, and the C-terminal half consists of a mixture of short helices and random coils. Because only the H3 region participates in the ternary 7 S complex, it has been proposed that syntaxin 1a must undergo large conformational changes to allow Habc to dissociate from H3, and allow syntaxin 1a to bind VAMP2 and SNAP-25 (10Rice L.M. Brennwald P. Brunger A.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 11Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernendez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). It has also been observed that syntaxin 1a can form stable binary complexes with SNAP-25 in vitro and that these complexes may be a precursor to SNARE complex assembly (4Fasshauer D. Bruns D. Shen B.

Acta. 1997; 1357: 155-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and it is possible that other conformations of the protein exist but have not yet been observed. To better understand the role of syntaxin 1a in membrane fusion, we have determined the x-ray crystal structure of the H3 region of syntaxin 1a. The structure reveals that H3 forms a homotetramer, and suggests that a conserved phenylalanine residue may determine the orientation of the four helices with respect to each other. Mutation of this phenylalanine to alanine or leucine confer different properties on the H3 oligomeric assembly, as assessed through gel filtration chromatography, chemical cross-linking, and circular dichroism spectroscopy. The structure also suggests mechanisms for SNARE complex assembly and may provide a model for SNARE precursor complexes. The H3 region of syntaxin 1a (residues 191–267) was cloned into the vector pGEX-KG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (16Kee Y. Scheller R.H. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 1975-1981Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the vector was transformed into the AB1899 strain of Escherichia coli. The cells were grown in LB broth at 37 °C for ∼1 h in the presence of 1 mm ampicillin and then induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and lysed by French press in the presence of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The lysate was mixed with glutathione-agarose beads (2 ml of 50% beads for each liter of cells) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed with buffer containing 250 mm NaCl, 2 mmCaCl2, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol (β-Me), 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, and the fusion protein was cleaved with Thrombin (Sigma Chemical Co.). The supernatant was applied to a Mono Q HR10/30 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column at 4 °C (10 mm or 1 m NaCl, 2 mm β-Me, and 15 mm Tris, pH 8.4). For crystallization, the Mono Q fractions were concentrated to ∼15 mg/ml using Centriprep concentrators with a molecular mass cutoff of 3 kDa (Amicon). Crystals of the wild type and Y257C mercury-derivatized (see below) syntaxin 1a H3 region were obtained by hanging drop vapor diffusion at 25 °C by mixing equal volumes of purified protein in a buffer containing 300 mm NaCl and 15 mm Tris, pH 8.4, and reservoir solution containing 750 mm sodium/potassium tartrate, 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0–5.3. Crystals appeared within 1 week and grew to an average size of 0.25 × 0.25 × 0.10 mm3 within 2 weeks. The crystals belong to space group P3221 and have approximate unit cell dimensions a = b= 88.5 Å, c = 58.4 Å. The asymmetric unit contains two copies of the H3 molecule with a 65% solvent content, which represents half of the four-helix bundle. Typically, the crystals were nonmosaic (∼0.5°) and diffracted to an average resolution of 3.2 Å, however, the Y257C mutant protein crystals generally diffracted to higher resolution (3.0-Å Bragg spacings). The diffraction patterns for both the wild type and mutant proteins contained systematically weak reflections, indicating the possible presence of multiple lattices or pseudo-symmetry. A second crystal form, similarly packed but with a doubled c axis (a = b = 88.5 Å, c = 115.9 Å) to give the enantiomorphic space group P3121, was also obtained. This crystal form was not reproducible, but did provide the high resolution native data (2.4-Å Bragg spacings) used for refinement. The asymmetric unit of this crystal contains four copies of H3, corresponding to the entire four-helix bundle. Diffraction data were measured from crystals rapidly transferred from mother liquor to 30% ethylene glycol and then flash-frozen at 100 K. Native and mercury derivative diffraction data were measured on an R-AXIS IIC imaging plate detector (Rigaku) using CuKα radiation from a rotating anode (Rigaku; 50 kV, 90 mA, graphite monochromator, 0.3-mm collimator). MAD data were measured at four wavelengths at beamline 5.02 of the Advanced Light Source, using a Quantum4 charge-coupled device detector (Area Detector Systems Corp.). Friedel pairs were systematically measured using inverse beam geometry. All data were collected at 100 K and processed and scaled with Denzo/Scalepack (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

To obtain phases for structure determination, selenomethionine-substituted protein was prepared, but this protein failed to crystallize. Over 150 experiments to prepare derivatives by soaking native crystals in many different heavy atom compounds failed. It is likely that the low pH and high salt conditions of the crystals prevented heavy atom binding, but the crystals could not be adapted into significantly different conditions. To combat this problem, single cysteine substitutions were introduced into the H3 protein using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) to allow for covalent attachment of mercury atoms. Of 35 constructs containing single-cysteine substitutions, 15 failed to yield significant amounts of protein when expressed in BL21, JM109, or M15 E. colihost strains. Purification and expression of the remaining 20 mutant proteins proceeded as for the native protein. Only three of these mutant proteins (K252C, V255C, and Y257C) crystallized, so these three proteins were used for derivatization experiments. Crystals of the mutant proteins were soaked in several different mercurial compounds, but again binding was not observed. A successful strategy was to react the purified mutant proteins in solution (12 h, 4 °C in a buffer of 300 mm NaCl, 15 mm Tris, pH 8.2) with mercury compounds, and then apply the proteins to a gel filtration column (Sephadex G15 resin) to remove unbound mercury compounds. Covalent attachment of the mercury atom was assayed by mass spectrometry (data not shown). The only successful heavy atom derivative was obtained by reacting 2,6-bischloromercuri-4-nitrophenol with the Y257C mutant protein. A difference Patterson synthesis calculated between the 2,6-bischloromercuri-4-nitrophenol derivative of theY257C mutant protein and native H3 data sets revealed a single mercury site. Refinement of this site using the program SOLVE 2T. C. Terwilliger and J. Berendzen, Los Alamos National Laboratory; available on the Web. gave SIRAS phases to 3.3-Å Bragg spacings. The resulting electron density maps revealed the helical backbone but were not of sufficient quality to assign the sequence. A multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) experiment was then carried out on the same derivatized crystal, and phases to 2.7 Å were calculated using SOLVE with the edge (λ3)-positive Friedel data used as a reference. The phases were improved using solvent flattening and histogram matching as implemented in the program DM (19Cowtan K.D. Main P. Acta Cryst. 1996; D52: 43-48Google Scholar), with an estimated solvent content of 60%. The improved phases and increased resolution produced an interpretable electron density map. The asymmetric unit contains two parallel helices, which associate with a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry-related pair to form the four-helix bundle.

The derivatized cysteine is present in a disordered portion of the polypeptide chain, but the mercury was bound in a surface pocket of a crystal lattice neighbor. Before refinement, a random subset (∼8%) of the data was removed and used as a test set for cross-validation. The model was first subjected to simulated annealing with a maximum likelihood target (22Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1996; 52: 659-668Crossref Scopus (319) Google Scholar) using amplitudes against the 2.7-Å mercury edge data set. After 5 cycles of refinement and manual rebuilding, the model was refined against the 2.4-Å native data set with a maximum likelihood target using amplitudes. In this form, the c axis is doubled, so that the 2-fold axis that generates the tetramer is noncrystallographic. Consideration of the relationship of the two crystal forms allowed the partially refined model to be placed into the larger unit cell by rigid-body refinement. Subsequent rounds of model building using ςA-weighted (2Fo −Fc) maps, conjugate gradient minimization, and individual thermal factor refinement were then carried out using the native data set to produce the final model. Several strong water molecules were identifiable, and additional water molecules were placed in areas that contained positive difference Fourier peaks greater than 3ς and that exhibited a sensible chemical environment. The final model contains residues 190–256 for copy A, 193–254 for copy B, 190–255 for copy C, 193–253 for copy D, 53 water molecules, and one tartaric acid molecule.

Open table in a new tab H3 protein was purified on a Superdex 200 column HR 26/60 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 150 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris, pH 8.4. Peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed into 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, for cross-linking reactions. SulfoEGS, SulfoDST, and BS3 (Pierce) were made up as 5 mg/ml stock solutions and diluted to various protein:cross-linker ratios. H3 protein concentrations ranged from 20 to 100 μm. Reaction volumes were 30 μl for each cross-linker concentration tested, and cross-linking reactions were carried out at 25 °C for 30 min. Reactions were quenched by adding an equal volume of buffer containing 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 15% glycerol, 15 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2% Coomassie Blue dye and 125 mm Tris, pH 6.9, and then boiled for 5 min. Samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE using 15% acrylamide. To determine the oligomeric state of the wild type and mutant F216A and F216L syntaxin 1a H3 proteins, fractions containing ∼95% pure protein (as determined by SDS-PAGE, data not shown) were applied to a Superdex 200 HR10/30 or Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-Me, and 20 mmTris, pH 8.0, or 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5. The peak elution volume was compared with protein standards of known molecular weight (Sigma). Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and melting temperature experiments were performed on fast protein liquid chromatography-purified protein dialyzed against a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl and 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, or 150 mm NaCl and 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5. The protein concentration for all samples was 126 μm (1.1 mg/ml). Data were collected using an AVIV 62 A DS CD spectrometer. The higher molar ellipticity values for some of the samples result from differences in helical content and not differences in protein concentration. To determine thermal stabilities (Tm values), α-helical signals were monitored by the ellipticity at 222 nm while the sample was heated from 4 °C to 90 °C. All apparent Tm values were taken as the maximum of the first derivative of the melting curve. Wavelength spectra and temperature melt data were acquired using a 1-mm path length quartz cuvette. For thermal unfolding experiments, a 1° step size and 30-s equilibration time were used. The F216L mutant was annealed by raising the temperature of the protein sample to 45 °C in 10° increments and equilibrating for 10 min at each temperature. The sample was then cooled by lowering the temperature to 4 °C in 5° increments, with a 5-min equilibration time at each temperature. The H3 region of rat syntaxin 1a, consisting of residues 191–267, was expressed in E. coli as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein and purified after thrombin cleavage of the GST tag. Crystals were obtained in the pH range 5.0–5.3 from a precipitant containing a mixture of tartrate and acetate salts. Most crystals grew in a trigonal space group that contained two molecules in the asymmetric unit, which typically diffracted to 3.2 Å. The final model, discussed below, was refined against a native data set to 2.4-Å resolution obtained from a related but nonreproducible crystal form that contains four copies of the H3 peptide in the asymmetric unit. Data collection, phasing, and refinement statistics are given in TablesI, II, andIII. Each of the four copies of H3 in the asymmetric unit of the crystal forms an extended, amphipathic α helix along the majority of the polypeptide chain (Fig.1). A parallel dimer formed by two helices associates in an anti-parallel orientation with another parallel dimer. The hydrophobic faces of the helices form both the parallel and anti-parallel interfaces. This packing arrangement produces a four-helix bundle with approximate dimensions 100 × 35 × 35 Å (Fig. 1). The topology of the bundle is unusual, because other anti-parallel four-helix bundles are arranged with adjacent helices anti-parallel to one another, with the two parallel helices located across the diagonal (23Murzin A.G. Lo Conte L. Ailey B.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T.J.P. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5588) Google Scholar). The topology observed in the H3 tetramer represents yet another mode by which helices can associate into a tetrameric assembly. There are slight conformational differences among the four helices in the H3 tetramer. Copies A and B are parallel, as are C and D. Copies A and C are more ordered at their N and C termini, with electron density visible for residues 190–256 and 190–255, respectively. In addition, copy C contains an interruption in the α-helical backbone at residue 212. Copies B and D are shorter (residues 196–254 and 194–253, respectively). The N-terminal ends of copies B and D are significantly straighter than their C-terminal ends, and as a result the ends of the four-helix bundle are not as tightly assembled as the central region. The fact that the H3 region forms an extended helical assembly makes it of interest to compare the H3 homotetramer structure with the core SNARE complex structure (7Sutton R.B. Fasshauer D. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. Nature. 1998; 395: 347-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (1912) Google Scholar). The most obvious difference between these two structures is that all of the long helices are parallel to each other in the core SNARE complex, whereas the H3 tetramer consists of anti-parallel pairs of parallel helices. Another difference is that the H3 region in the core complex structure is structured further toward the C terminus. The last ordered syntaxin 1a residue seen in the crystal structure of the core SNARE complex is 259 or 261 (seen in different copies in the asymmetric unit), whereas in the H3 tetramer the last visible residue is either 253 or 256. Both crystal structures show more order at the C terminus than NMR solution studies of full-length syntaxin like proteins (11Dulubova I. Sugita S. Hill S. Hosaka M. Fernendez I. Sudhof T.C. Rizo J.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4372-4382Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 24Fiebig K.M. Rice L.M. Pollock E. Brunger A.T. Nature Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 117-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), in which the H3 region is disordered from residues 226–267. This discrepancy may arise from the fact that in full-length syntaxin, the interaction with Habc stabilizes the first half of the H3 peptide, leaving the rest disordered. Alternatively, the high local concentration of the H3 peptide in the crystal, the nature of the crystallization conditions, or preferential incorporation of the more helical population into the crystal lattice may make the present structure more ordered than the ensemble present in solution. Electron density maps calculated from data measured from crystals diffracting to a lower resolution reveal that the C terminus of each copy of H3 is less well ordered from residues 247 to 256 than in the structure presented here, again suggesting that these residues are ordered only under limited conditions. Copy A from the H3 tetramer superimposes on VAMP from the core SNARE complex with an r.m.s.d. of 2.3Å, and copy B from the H3 tetramer superimposes on H3 from the core SNARE complex with an r.m.s.d. of 0.4Å on Cα positions"
https://openalex.org/W2061611744,"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) exerts its effect by two distinct signaling pathways. It can trigger cytotoxicity in sensitive target cells. TNF-alpha can also promote nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity and regulate the expression of genes that interfere with apoptosis and thus conferring resistance to several apoptotic stimuli. We have observed that interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) sensitizes human ovarian carcinoma cell lines to TNF-alpha-mediated apoptosis and further, IFN-gamma induces the expression of the inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) and the generation of nitric oxide (NO). This study examines the role of NO in the sensitization of the ovarian carcinoma cell line AD10 to TNF-alpha-mediated cytotoxicity. Treatment of AD10 cells with the NOS inhibitor l-NMA blocked the IFN-gamma-dependent sensitization whereas NO donors (S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine) sensitized these cells to TNF-alpha cytotoxicity. Analysis of the activation status of NF-kappaB upon treatment with NO donors confirmed the inhibitory role of NO on both the NF-kappaB DNA-binding property and its activation. Moreover, the inhibition of NF-kappaB nuclear translocation by NO donors directly correlated with the intracellular concentration of H(2)O(2) and was reversed by the addition of exogenous H(2)O(2). These findings show that NO might interfere with TNF-alpha-dependent NF-kappaB activation by interacting with O(2) and reducing the generation of H(2)O(2), a potent NF-kappaB activator. Therefore, NO-mediated disruption of NF-kappaB activation results in the removal of anti-apoptotic/resistance signals and sensitizes tumor cells to cytotoxic cytokines like TNF-alpha."

Neutrophils and neutrophilic HL60 cells contain both βI and βII-PKC, isotypes that are derived by alternate splicing. βI-PKC-positive and βI-PKC null HL60 cells generated equivalent amounts of O⨪2 in response to fMet-Leu-Phe and phorbol myristate acetate. However, antisense depletion of βII-PKC from βI-PKC null cells inhibited ligand-initiated O⨪2generation. fMet-Leu-Phe triggered association of a cytosolic NADPH oxidase component, p47phox, with βII-PKC but not with RACK1, a binding protein for βII-PKC.

Therefore spatial considerations are a key element in defining a role for β-PKC in signal transduction for a particular response. β-PKC must be directed to different locations in the cell for each function, suggesting a role for scaffold proteins or PKC-binding proteins in β-PKC-based signaling for activation of O⨪2 generation (20Sim A.T.R.

When peptide I is injected into Xenopusoocytes, it inhibits insulin-induced translocation of β-PKC and oocyte maturation (25Souroujon M.C. Mochly-Rosen D. Nat.

RACK1 is a binding protein for βII-PKC (31Ron D. Jiang Z. Yao L. Vagts A. Diamond I. Gordon A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27039-27046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). In this study we have assessed the roles of the PKC isotypes βI-PKC and βII-PKC in O⨪2 generation and, secondly, the role of RACK1 in β-PKC-based signaling for O⨪2 generation. A βI-PKC null subclone of HL60 cells (32Hocevar B.A. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 28-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and depletion of βII-PKC by an antisense strategy was used to demonstrate that βII-PKC, but not βI-PKC, is necessary for activation of O⨪2 generation. rhβII-PKC bound to a number of endogenous HL60 proteins in a cofactor-dependent manner, including RACK1 and p47phox. Depletion of RACK1 by an antisense strategy and electroporation of cells with a peptide that inhibits the RACK1-βII-PKC interaction enhanced fMet-Leu-Phe- and PMA-induced O⨪2 generation. Therefore RACK1 is not essential in signaling for activation of the NADPH oxidase but may down-regulate βII-PKC-based signaling either by diverting the βII-PKC to another signaling pathway or by sequestering βII-PKC as part of a down-regulation step in O⨪2 generation. Human promyelocytic HL60 leukemia cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The cells were grown in suspension culture in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 1% minimal essential medium vitamin solution, 1% nonessential amino acids, 0.1% gentamicin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. The cell cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified atmosphere. The initial culture was positive for α-PKC, βI-PKC, βII-PKC, δ-PKC, and ζ-PKC. A clone that was protein null for βI-PKC but positive for α-PKC, βII-PKC, δ-PKC, and ζ-PKC was selected (32Hocevar B.A. Fields A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 28-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). An antisense oligonucleotide was designed against the translation start site of human RACK1 using the commercial primer analysis software Oligo (National Biosciences). A 20-mer sequence was chosen that was without significant self-complimentarity and was optimized for maximalTm to promote high affinity binding to mRNA; aTm of 64.6 °C was calculated at 150 mm salt and 37 °C. The 20-mer oligonucleotides had the following sequences: RACK1 antisense (RACK1 AS): 5′-T GCC ACG AAG GGT CAT CTG C-3′; RACK1 sense: 5′-G CAG ATG ACC CTT CGT GGC A-3′. A scrambled missense oligonucleotide of the RACK1 AS was used as a control. The unique nature of these sequences was confirmed by searching the GenBankTM data base. For depletion of β-PKC, a 19-mer oligonucleotide having the sequence β-PKC antisense (βAS), 5′-AGC CGG GTC AGC CAT CTT G-3′, and a scrambled missense oligonucleotide β-PKC missense (βMS) were used as previously described (8Korchak H.M. Rossi M.W. Kilpatrick L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27292-27299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Antisense and scrambled control oligonucleotides to RACK1 and β-PKC were synthesized by the PENN Nucleic Acid Facility as the phosphorothioate derivatives and purified by high performance liquid chromatography. In all oligonucleotides, the internucleoside linkages were completely phosphorothioate-modified. Delivery of the oligonucleotides was enhanced with the cationic lipid 1,2-dimyristoyloxypropyl-3-dimethylhydroxyethyl ammonium bromide/cholesterol (DMRIE-C) (1:1 (m/m)) (Life Technologies, Inc.). HL60 cells were cultured in the presence of 1.3% Me2SO for 4 days to initiate differentiation to a neutrophil-like phenotype before treatment with the oligonucleotide. On day 4, the cells were washed and resuspended in Opti-MEM I reduced serum medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a cell concentration of 25 × 106 cells/well. Oligonucleotides RACK1 AS, RACK1 MS, βAS, or βMS were suspended in Optimem at a final concentration of 100–1000 nm and mixed with the cationic lipid DMRIE-C (4 μg/ml). The cationic lipid/oligonucleotide mixture was added to the cells and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. An equal volume of RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum plus Me2SO (1.3% final concentration) was then added, and the cells were cultured for 20 h. On day 5, the cells were washed and resuspended in fresh Opti-MEM medium and treated again with the cationic lipid/oligonucleotide mixture. After a 4-h incubation, an equal volume of RPMI 1640 medium containing 20% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum plus Me2SO (1.3% final concentration) was then added, and the cells were cultured for an additional 24 h. The cells were harvested and suspended in Hepes buffer (pH 7.5) having the composition 150 mm Na+, 5 mm K+, 1.29 mm Ca2+, 1.2 mmMg2+, 155 mm Cl−, and 10 mm Hepes (8Korchak H.M. Rossi M.W. Kilpatrick L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27292-27299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Lysates of dHL60 cells (1 × 106 cells/sample) were prepared by heating the cells at 95 °C for 5 min in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were briefly sonicated (12 s) to reduce viscosity. The dHL60 cell lysates were run on a 4–12% gradient SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane, and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.5) containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 1% BSA, 3% casein. To identify the different PKC isotypes, the membrane was incubated with a panel of PKC antibodies followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. For detection of RACK1, the membrane was incubated with a monoclonal antibody to RACK1, followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by Pierce SuperSignal Ultra chemiluminescence substrate. The software SigmaProscan (Jandel/SPSS) was used for densitometric analysis. The generation of superoxide anion (O⨪2) by dHL60 cells was measured as superoxide dismutase inhibitable cytochrome c reduction by either a continuous recording method (33Korchak H.M. Vienne K. Rutherford L.E. Wilkenfeld C. Finkelstein M.C. Weissmann G. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4076-4082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or end point analysis. Cells were activated by 1 μm fMet-Leu-Phe in the presence of 5 μg/ml cytochalasin B or by 1 μg/ml PMA in the absence of cytochalasin B. dHL60 cells (50 × 106 cells/ml) were stimulated with either buffer alone or fMet-Leu-Phe (1 μm) for 1 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of cold immunoprecipitation buffer. Immunoprecipitation buffer consisted of 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) containing 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 0.027 trypsin inhibitory units/ml of aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 5 mg/ml BSA. The samples were then vortexed for 20 min to solubilize the membrane fraction, and the supernatant was collected after microcentrifuging for 5 min. A rabbit polyclonal antibody to p47phox or to βII-PKC was added, and the samples were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein A-agarose was added, and the samples were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with shaking. The reaction tubes were then microcentrifuged for 30 s, and the supernatants were discarded. The protein A-agarose pellet was washed four times with immunoprecipitation buffer, and the sample was eluted by incubation for 20 min at 65 °C in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The ability of rhβII-PKC to bind to endogenous proteins from dHL60 cells was assayed by an overlay procedure (30Ron D. Chen C-H. Caldwell J. Jamieson L. Orr E. Mochly-Rosen D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 839-843Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Lysates of dHL60 cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membrane strips were incubated with overlay block buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% polyethylene glycol, 0.2 m NaCl, and 3% BSA for 1 h. rhβII-PKC (0.1 ng) was bound to the membrane strip for 30 min at room temperature in an overlay incubation buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1% polyethylene glycol, 0.2m NaCl, 12 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% BSA, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soy bean trypsin inhibitor, 20 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride in the presence or absence of 0.1 mm CaCl2, 50 μg/ml PS, and 1 mg/ml DG. The membranes were washed three times for 15 min with phosphate-buffered saline/Tween (140 mm NaCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 3 mm KCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (pH 7.0)) and probed with antibodies to βII-PKC or RACK1. A method of electroporation was chosen that allows efficient incorporation of molecules of molecular mass <1000 Da and transient passage of molecules >1000Da. We chose a one-pulse protocol to optimize preservation of intracellular metabolites. The cells were electroporated once in a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser at 400 V and a capacitance of 500 microfarads. dHL60 cells were suspended in 800 ml of ice-cold Hepes buffer containing 1 mm ATP and 1 mm NADPH in the presence or absence of 200 μm peptide I. Previous studies using the fluorescent probe Dextran-Indo1 conjugate indicated that the attained intracellular concentration of peptides under these electroporation conditions is ∼10 μm (15Majumdar S. Kane L., H. Rossi M.W. Volpp B.D. Nauseef W.M. Korchak H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1176: 276-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as mean ± S.E. (n). Data were analyzed by Student's ttest. Cytochalasin B, cytochrome c, protease inhibitors (leupeptin, soy bean trypsin inhibitor, and aprotinin), BSA, PMA, fMet-Leu-Phe, and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride were purchased from Sigma. PMA was stored as a concentrated stock solution in Me2SO and diluted with Hepes Buffer before use. fMet-Leu-Phe was stored as a stock solution in ethanol and diluted in buffer before use. Peptide I, KGDYEKILVALCGGN, was purchased from Coast Scientific. Anti-peptide polyclonal antibodies to α-PKC, βI-PKC, βII-PKC, γ-PKC, and δ-PKC and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgM was obtained from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories. Mouse monoclonal antibodies to δ-PKC, ζ-PKC, and RACK1 and a rabbit polyclonal antibody to p47phox were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Protein A-agarose was obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. A clone of HL60 cells that contained the βII-PKC isotype of PKC as well as α-PKC, δ-PKC, and ζ-PKC was selected and probed for immunoreactivity to PKC antibodies (Fig.1 A). In comparison to the parent cell line, which contains βI-PKC, the βI-PKC protein null line contained no detectable amount of βI-PKC (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, both βI-PKC-positive and βI-PKC null cell lines contained equivalent amounts of α-PKC, δ-PKC, and ζ-PKC. Previous studies in which both βI-PKC and βII-PKC were depleted by an antisense strategy demonstrated a role for β-PKC in activation of the NADPH oxidase in dHL60 cells (8Korchak H.M. Rossi M.W. Kilpatrick L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27292-27299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To discriminate between roles for βI-PKC and βII-PKC in ligand-initiated activation of O⨪2generation, we compared fMet-Leu-Phe-triggered O⨪2 generation in βI-PKC null and βI-PKC-positive dHL60 cells. Generation of O⨪2 triggered by 1 μm fMet-Leu-Phe was 11.3 ± 1.9 (n = 12) nmol/106 cells/10 min in βI-PKC null dHL60 cells, a rate that was not significantly different from the rate of 11.2 ± 1.8 (n = 8) nmol/106 cells/10 min observed in βI-PKC-positive dHL60 cells (Fig. 1 B). Generation of O⨪2 in response to 1 μg/ml PMA was also similar in βI-PKC null and βI-PKC-positive dHL60 cells (Fig. 1 B). In βI-PKC-positive dHL60 cells, PMA triggered generation of 22.3 ± 4.1 (n = 5) nmol of O⨪2/106 cells/10 min, whereas in βI-PKC cells, PMA triggered generation of 21.2 ± 1.7 (n = 6) nmol of O⨪2/106 cells/10 min (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, βI-PKC was not essential for optimal PMA- or fMet-Leu-Phe-initiated generation of O⨪2 in dHL60 cells. βI-PKC null dHL60 cells were treated for 2 days with 400 nm of an antisense oligonucleotide to β-PKC (βPKC AS) or with 400 nm control missense oligonucleotide to β-PKC (βPKC MS) as described under “Materials and Methods.” Treatment with βPKC AS resulted in a reduction in the level of βII-PKC to 362 ± 47 (n = 4) density units (DU) as compared with a level of 603 ± 34 (n = 4) DU in control βPKC MS-treated cells (62.2 ± 10.0% control,p < 0.02) (Fig. 2,A and B). Treatment of the dHL60 cells with the antisense or missense oligonucleotides to β-PKC had no significant effect on the levels of α-PKC, δ-PKC, or ζ-PKC (Fig. 2,A and B) and as previously shown (8Korchak H.M. Rossi M.W. Kilpatrick L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27292-27299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The effect of depletion of βII-PKC on O⨪2 generation was determined in βI-PKC null cells treated with βPKC AS or βPKC MS. fMet-Leu-Phe (1 μm) triggered generation of 5.3 ± 1.5 (n = 6) nmol of O⨪2/106cells/10 min in βPKC AS-treated βI-PKC null cells, which was significantly less than the level of 12.2 ± 2.7 (n = 6) nmol/106 cells/10 min observed in control cells pretreated with βPKC MS (41.7 ± 9.5% control,p < 0.025) (Fig.3 A). The kinetics of fMet-Leu-Phe-activated O⨪2 generation are characterized by a rapid initial rate continuing for ∼2 min followed by a slow rate of generation that ceases by 5–10 min. In contrast, PMA triggers a sustained generation of O⨪2. The Vmax of fMet-Leu-Phe-induced O⨪2 generation, defined as the maximal rate of O⨪2 generation, was reduced in cells depleted of β-PKC. Calculation of the Vmax demonstrated that in control βPKC MS-treated cells activated by 1 μmfMet-Leu-Phe, the Vmax was 2.70 ± 0.44 (n = 6) nmol/min/106 cells; theVmax of β-PKC-depleted cells treated with βPKC AS was significantly reduced to 1.41 ± 0.74 (n = 6) nmol/min/106 cells (53.0 ± 7.2% control βPKC MS-treated cells (p < 0.01) (Fig.3 B). Similarly, activation of control βPKC MS-pretreated cells by 1 μg/ml PMA triggered generation of 16.6 ± 1.5 (n= 7) nmol of O⨪2/106 cells/10 min, an amount that was significantly greater than the generation of 8.2 ± 1.3 (n = 7) nmol of O⨪2/106 cells/10 min observed in dHL60 cells depleted of β-PKC by treatment with βPKC AS (48.7 ± 6.2% control, p < 0.01) (Fig.3 A). The Vmax of PMA-induced O⨪2 generation was also significantly decreased in β-PKC-depleted cells as compared with controls. TheVmax of O⨪2 generation decreased significantly from a rate of 3.12 ± 0.37 (n = 7) nmol/min/106 cells in control βPKC MS-treated cells to aVmax of 2.06 ± 0.27 (n = 8) nmol/min/106 cells in β-PKC-depleted cells (66.1 ± 8.2% control, p < 0.01) (Fig. 3 B). Thus, depletion of βII-PKC in βI-PKC null dHL60 cells resulted in inhibition of the rate of O⨪2 generation in response to both fMet-Leu-Phe and PMA, indicating an essential role for the βII isotype but not the βI isotype of PKC in signaling for O⨪2generation. β-PKC is capable of phosphorylating multiple proteins in vitro (15Majumdar S. Kane L., H. Rossi M.W. Volpp B.D. Nauseef W.M. Korchak H.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1176: 276-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). However, in the intact cell, scaffold proteins may provide added substrate specificity by targeting the kinase to a particular cellular location. RACK1 is a scaffold or escort protein that selectively binds to βII-PKC in the presence of the cofactors PS, DG, and Ca2+. To assess the presence of binding proteins for βII-PKC in dHL60 cells, we tested the ability of rhβII-PKC to bind to endogenous dHL60 proteins using an overlay assay. Lysates of βI-PKC null dHL60 cells were separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes, and the membranes were incubated with rhβII-PKC in the presence and absence of the PKC cofactors PS, DG, and Ca2+. Western blotting with an antibody to βII-PKC demonstrated that the exogenous rhβII-PKC bound to several endogenous proteins in a cofactor-dependent manner (Fig. 4 A). In the absence of exogenous rhβII-PKC and cofactors, a band at 80 kDa corresponding to the endogenous βII-PKC was observed (Fig.4 A, lane 1). rhβII-PKC in the absence of cofactors bound strongly only to a protein of 19 kDa (Fig.4 A, lane 2). However when rhβII-PKC was added in the presence of the cofactors PS, DG, and Ca2+, additional binding of rhβII-PKC to bands of 29, 32, 36, 39, 47, and 55 kDa was observed (Fig. 4 A, lane 3). Probing with an antibody to RACK1 (Fig. 4 A, lane 4) showed a strong band at 36 kDa, demonstrating the presence of RACK1 in dHL60 cells. Quantitation by densitometry demonstrated that the band at 80 kDa corresponding to endogenous βII-PKC was"

We investigated membrane topogenesis of PMP34 with six putative transmembrane segments, as a model peroxisomal membrane protein.

Transmembrane topology of PMP34 was determined by differential permeabilization and immunofluorescent staining of HeLa cells ectopically expressing PMP34 as well as of Chinese hamster ovary-K1 expressing epitope-tagged PMP34. As opposed to PMP47, PMP34 was found to expose its N- and C-terminal parts to the cytosol. Various deletion variants of PMP34 and their fusion proteins with green fluorescent protein were expressed in Chinese hamster ovary-K1 and were verified with respect to intracellular localization. The loop region between transmembrane segments 4 and 5 was required for the peroxisome-targeting activity, in which Ala substitution for basic residues abrogated the activity. Three hydrophobic transmembrane segments linked in a flanking region of the basic loop were essential for integration of PMP34 to peroxisome membranes.

Accordingly, to delineate mPTS and to establish a general paradigm for topogenesis of PMPs, more information is required. In the present study, we have chosen PMP34 as a model protein, to address these issues. PMP34 was recently cloned by expressed sequence tag data base search using C. boidinii PMP47 and was shown to be localized to peroxisomes (18Wylin T. Baes M. Brees C. Mannaerts G.P. Fransen M. Veldhoven P.P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We found that PMP34 is an integral membrane protein of peroxisomes. In contrast to PMP47, PMP34 exposes both N- and C-terminal parts to the cytosol. We also identified the loop region between TM4 and TM5 as a potential mPTS. This loop plus three TMs were essential for targeting and integration of PMP34. These results provide the first evidence for a functional mPTS for the topogenesis of a membrane protein that spans membranes multiple times in mammalian peroxisomes. Restriction enzymes and DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from Nippon Gene (Tokyo, Japan), Toyobo (Tokyo, Japan), and Takara (Tokyo, Japan). Fetal calf serum and Ham's F-12 were from Life Technologies, Inc. Anti-PMP34 antibody was raised in rabbits by immunizing with synthetic peptide comprising the C-terminal, 19-amino acid sequence of human PMP34, supplemented with cysteine at the N terminus that had been linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (19Tsukamoto T. Miura S. Fujiki Y. Nature. 1991; 350: 77-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Rabbit antibody against influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) was likewise raised using synthetic peptide, CYPYDVPDYASLRS-NH2. Guinea pig antibody to human catalase (Sigma) was raised by conventional subcutaneous injection. We also used rabbit antibodies to PTS1 peptide (20Otera H. Tateishi K. Okumoto K. Ikoma Y. Matsuda E.

Rabbit antibody to green fluorescent protein (GFP) (CLONTECH) and mouse monoclonal antibodies to flag (M2) and HA (12CA5) (Sigma) were purchased. CHO-K1 and HeLa cells were cultured in Ham's F-12 medium and RPMI 1640, respectively, both supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, under 5% CO2, 95% air (21Tsukamoto T. Yokota S. Fujiki Y. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 651-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Human PMP34 cDNA (HsPMP34) was cloned by PCR-based technique on the human liver cDNA library in pCMVSPORT (Life Technologies, Inc.) (22Tamura S. Okumoto K. Toyama R. Shimozawa N. Tsukamoto T. Suzuki Y. Osumi T. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 4350-4355Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), using a set of primer, HsPMP34F and HsPMP34R (Table I). Six independent cDNA clones were sequenced, all showing that nucleotide residue at position 315 in a codon (CTG) for Leu105 was G instead of CTC reported by Wylinet al. (18Wylin T. Baes M. Brees C. Mannaerts G.P. Fransen M. Veldhoven P.P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). HsPMP34 cDNA was cloned into theNotI-SalI site in pUcD2HygSRα (23Okumoto K. Shimozawa N. Kawai A. Tamura S. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. Moser H. Wanders R.J.A. Suzuki Y. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4324-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Tagging of epitopes, flag, and tandem HA (HA-HA) to the N and C terminus, respectively, of human PMP34 was conducted as follows. The full length of HsPMP34 was amplified using a pair of primers, HsPMP34F and PMP34RNhe. The PCR product was digested with NotI andNheI, then ligated into the NotI-NheI sites, upstream of a double-HA tag sequence, of pUcD2HygSRα·PEX16-HA (24Honsho M. Tamura S. Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y.

The NotI-SalI fragment of pBluescript SK(−)flag-PMP34-HA was subcloned into pUcD2HygSRα, termed pUcD2HygSRα·flag-HsPMP34-HA.

Open table in a new tab F (f) and R (r) indicate forward and reverse primers, respectively. N-terminal truncation mutants of PMP34 were generated by PCR, using as forward primers, ΔN30F, ΔN125F, ΔN186F, or ΔN204F, and a reverse primer PMP34RNhe. C-terminal deletion mutants were likewise constructed by PCR, using reverse primers, 204TerR and 186TerR, and a forward primer HsPMP34F. HA tagging at their C terminus was done as described above. To construct enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fusion proteins,SpeI site was introduced to the initiation codon of GFP-expression plasmid phGFP105-C1, a generous gift from T. Tsukamoto and T. Osumi (Himeji Institute of Technology, Himeji, Hyogo, Japan) by PCR using primers, GFPSpeF and GFPshortR. The resulting PCR fragment was digested with SpeI and SalI and introduced into the SpeI-SalI sites of pBluescript SK(−), termed pBluescript SK(−)GFP. SpeI-SalI fragment of pBluescript SK(−) GFP and NotI and NheI fragment of ΔN125, ΔN186, 204Ter, or 186Ter, cloned in pGEM/T-easy vector were introduced into the NotI-SalI site of pUcD2HygSRα. Chimera constructs for 30/204GFP and 86/204GFP were generated by PCR, using a forward primer ΔN30F or ΔN86F, and a reverse primer 204TerR. Fusion for 86/273GFP and 125/273GFP were likewise constructed, using a forward primer ΔN86F or ΔN125F, and a reverse primer 273TerR; GFP tagging was performed as above. Expression plasmid for 187/204GFP, the fourth loop domain of PMP34 fused to the N terminus of GFP, was constructed by PCR, using as a template pUcD2HygSRα·204GFP and as primers ΔN186F and GFPshortR. For construction of GFP187/204HA, BglII site was introduced by PCR on pUcD2HygSRα·204HA using BglII187F and pUcD2HygSRα reverse (D3R) as forward and reverse primers, respectively. The BglII and SalI fragments of187/204HA and NotI-BglII fragment of pBluescript SK(−) GFP were introduced into theNotI-SalI site of pUcD2HygSRα. Alanine substitution in the fourth loop domain between TM4 and TM5 of PMP34 was done by PCR using as a template pGEM/T-easy·204Ter and a forward primer HsPMP34F and a reverse primer 6Ar, 4Ar, 3Ar, or Ar. Construction 2A was done by PCR using as a template pGEM/T-easy·6A204Ter and a forward primer HsPMP34F and a reverse primer 2Ar. GFP tagging was performed as described above. DNA transfection was done using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.), as described (23Okumoto K. Shimozawa N. Kawai A. Tamura S. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. Moser H. Wanders R.J.A. Suzuki Y. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4324-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured for 36 h after transfecting the plasmid into the cells. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100, and peroxisomes were visualized by indirect immunofluorescence light microscopy, as described (26Shimozawa N. Tsukamoto T. Suzuki Y. Orii T. Fujiki Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1864-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Antigen-antibody complexes were detected under a Carl Zeiss Axioskop FL microscope, using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled sheep anti-mouse antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Tokyo, Japan), FITC-labeled sheep anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibody (Cappel), or Texas Red-labeled goat antibodies to guinea pig IgG (Vector Laboratories) and rabbit IgG (Leinco Technologies). GFP was directly observed by fluorescent microscopy with the use of the same filter for FITC after fixation (27Ghaedi K. Kawai A. Okumoto K. Tamura S. Shimozawa N. Suzuki Y. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 248: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Flag-PMP34-HA was detected using rabbit anti-HA antibody and mouse anti-flag antibody, in cells that had been fixed as above and then permeabilized with either 25 μg/ml digitonin or 1% Triton X-100 (23Okumoto K. Shimozawa N. Kawai A. Tamura S. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. Moser H. Wanders R.J.A. Suzuki Y. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4324-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 28Motley A. Hettema E. Distel B. Tabak H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with pUcD2HygSRα·HsPMP34. Cells were stained with rabbit anti-PMP34 C-terminal peptide antibody and guinea pig anti-human catalase antibody, after permeabilization for 5 min using either 25 μg/ml digitonin or for 2 min with 1% Triton X-100. HsPMP34-transfected CHO-K1 cells (1 × 107) were homogenized in 0.5 ml of a homogenizing buffer: 0.25 m sucrose, 25 mmammonium carbonate, pH 7.4, 20 μg/ml each of leupeptin and antipain, and 500 units/ml aprotinin, by 10 strokes of an Elvehjem-Potter homogenizer. A postnuclear supernatant (PNS) fraction was prepared by centrifugation of homogenates at 750 × g for 5 min. The PNS from 1 × 106 cells was treated with 2 μg ofStaphylococcus aureus V8 protease (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 25 °C for 1.5 h in 0.5 ml of the homogenizing buffer, in the absence or presence of 1% Triton X-100. The reaction was terminated by precipitation using trichloroacetic acid, and whole proteins were then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and immunoblot. Liver peroxisomes were isolated from a normal rat, as described (29Miura S. Kasuya-Arai I. Mori H. Miyazawa S. Osumi T. Hashimoto T. Fujiki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14405-14411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Western blot analysis was done using primary antibodies and a second antibody, donkey anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Antigen-antibody complex was visualized with ECL Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The intracellular localization of PMP34 was determined by ectopic expression of epitope-tagged HsPMP34 and immunofluorescence microscopy. In wild-type CHO-K1 cells expressing PMP34 tagged with HA at its C terminus, PMP34 was detected as a punctate staining pattern using anti-HA antibody. The staining pattern was superimposable with that obtained using anti-Pex14p antibody, thereby suggesting that PMP34-HA was targeted to peroxisomes (Fig.1 A). Similar results were obtained when HsPMP34 was expressed in HeLa cells and stained with anti-PMP34 peptide antibody (see Fig. 1 C). The rabbit antibody raised to the C-terminal peptide of human PMP34 specifically reacted with an endogenous, single protein with an apparent molecular mass of ∼34 kDa in immunoblot of rat liver peroxisomes (Fig. 1 B, left), confirming that PMP34 is a bona fide protein of peroxisomes. By sequence similarity to C. boidinii PMP47 (12Dyer J.M. McNew J.A. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 18Wylin T. Baes M. Brees C. Mannaerts G.P. Fransen M. Veldhoven P.P.V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 332-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), HsPMP34 is likely to be an integral membrane protein with six putative transmembrane segments. The integrity of PMP34 in peroxisomal membranes was verified by extraction with 0.1 m sodium carbonate, pH 11.3 (30Fujiki Y. Hubbard A.L. Fowler S. Lazarow P.B. J. Cell Biol. 1982; 93: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar). PMP34-HA expressed in CHO-K1 cells was not extracted with sodium carbonate (Fig. 1 B, right) and was recovered in membrane fraction at a similar level as in postnuclear supernatant fraction (data not shown). Pex14p, a peroxisomal membrane peroxin, was likewise in membrane pellet, whereas a matrix enzyme AOx was in soluble fraction. These data thereby indicated that PMP34 is integrated into membranes. Next, we determined transmembrane topology of PMP34 by the differential permeabilization/immunofluorescence microscopy method (28Motley A. Hettema E. Distel B. Tabak H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 31Okumoto K. Fujiki Y. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 265-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with HsPMP34. Upon treatment with 1% Triton X-100, which solubilizes all cellular membranes, a punctate staining pattern was observed using anti-PMP34 C-terminal peptide antibody, in a superimposable manner with catalase presumably representing peroxisomes (Fig. 1 C, a andc). Similar morphological pattern, PMP34-staining, was observed after permeabilization with 25 μg/ml digitonin, which selectively permeabilized plasma membranes (28Motley A. Hettema E. Distel B. Tabak H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 755-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 31Okumoto K. Fujiki Y. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 265-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 C, b), whereas none of the cells were stained with anti-catalase antibody under the same condition (Fig.1 C, d), indicating that peroxisomal matrix proteins are not accessible to antibody. Taken together, C-terminal part of PMP34 is most likely to be exposed to the cytosol. Moreover, the C-terminal part of PMP34 in HsPMP34-overexpressing CHO-K1 was likewise detected by the digitonin treatment, although requiring much higher concentration of digitonin under which conditions matrix proteins still remained inaccessible to antibodies (data not shown). We do not know the reason why PMP34 was visible only at higher concentration of digitonin in this particular case, as compared with that normally permeabilizing plasma membranes (4Shimizu N. Itoh R. Hirono Y. Otera H. Ghaedi K. Tateishi K. Tamura S. Okumoto K. Harano T. Mukai S. Fujiki Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12593-12604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 23Okumoto K. Shimozawa N. Kawai A. Tamura S. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. Moser H. Wanders R.J.A. Suzuki Y. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4324-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Membrane topology of PMP34 was also determined using N-terminally flag- and C-terminally HA-tagged PMP34. When flag-PMP34-HA-transfected CHO-K1 cells were permeabilized with 25 μg/ml digitonin, a punctate staining pattern was observed using both anti-flag and anti-HA antibodies (Fig. 1 D, b and f). In contrast, PTS1 proteins were not detectable under the same condition, indicating that lumenal proteins are not accessible to the antibody (Fig. 1 D, d). Upon treatment with Triton X-100, PTS1 proteins as well as PMP34 were discernible in numerous particles, peroxisomes (Fig. 1 D, a, c, ande). Therefore, it is apparent that N- and C-terminal portions are exposed to the cytosol. Of note, the topology of PMP34 contrasts with that of PMP47, which exposes both terminal parts to matrix of peroxisomes (12Dyer J.M. McNew J.A. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PMP34 expressed in CHO-K1 cells was resistant to the treatment with exogenously added S. aureus protease V8, as verified using PNS fraction, under which condition Pex14p was digested (Fig. 1 E, left panel). Matrix enzyme AOx was also fully protected from the digestion. Both PMP34 and AOx were no longer discernible after protease treatment in the presence of Triton X-100 (Fig. 1 E, lane 3). These results were interpreted to mean that multiple sites, C-terminal side of Glu, for cleavage by V8 protease locate inside of peroxisomes (Fig. 1 E, right panel). It is conceivable that three potential cleavable Glu sites may not be readily attacked by the protease, probably owing to their location close to the transmembrane-spanning segments. The data together support the notion described above that the N- and C-terminal parts of PMP34 are exposed to the cytosol. Although transmembrane topology of PMP34 is opposite to that of CbPMP47, amino acid sequence of the fourth intervening-loop region of PMP34 is similar to the one containing mPTS of PMP47 (12Dyer J.M. McNew J.A. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 3 A). To search for peroxisome targeting signal of PMP34, various mutants with deletion either from N or C terminus were constructed (Fig.2 A). Mutants ΔN30HA, ΔN125HA, ΔN186HA and ΔN204HA, lacking the sequence from N terminus to the first, third, and fourth transmembrane segments, and to the fourth loop domain, respectively, were HA-tagged at the C terminus. These truncation mutants were transfected into wild-type CHO-K1 cells and analyzed for intracellular localization by immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-HA antibody (Fig. 2 B). In the cells expressing ΔN30HA, punctate immunofluorescence pattern was observed and superimposable to that using anti-Pex14p antibody, thus indicating that ΔN30HA was localized to peroxisomes (Fig. 2 B,a and b). ΔN125HA was likewise detected in a superimposable manner to Pex14p, demonstrating peroxisomal localization (Fig. 2 B, c and d). In the case of ΔN186HA, punctate pattern was obtained, however, some signal did not correspond to that obtained from anti-Pex14p antibody (Fig.2 B, e and f, arrowheads). To confirm the intracellular localization of these two mutants, we also expressed GFP-tagged ΔN125 and ΔN186 and their peroxisomal localization were analyzed. The full-length PMP34 fused with GFP was localized to peroxisomes, as seen for PMP34-HA, when expressed in CHO-K1 cells (data not shown). Punctate signals were observed in the cells expressing ΔN125GFP, and colocalized with those noted using anti-Pex14p antibody (Fig. 2 B, g andh). In the case of ΔN186GFP, two types of punctate structures were found, where one type was superimposable with those seen using anti-Pex14p antibody and the other was not (Fig.2 B, i and j, arrowheads). ΔN204HA was apparently localized to endoplasmic reticulum-like structures in addition to peroxisomes (Fig. 2 B,k), thereby inferring a decrease in the topogenic activity. Together, these results suggest that 79-amino acid sequence between the loop domains 3 (L3) and 4 (L4) is required for localization of PMP34 to peroxisomes.Figure 2Functional and topogenic regions of PMP34.

https://openalex.org/W2033526943,"Insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) binds to insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and has been shown to inhibit or stimulate cellular responses to IGF-I in vitro. This capacity of IGFBP-1 to inhibit or stimulate IGF-I actions correlates with its ability to form stable high molecular weight multimers. Since the ability of some proteins to polymerize is dependent upon transglutamination, we determined if tissue transglutaminase could catalyze this reaction and the effect of polymerization of IGFBP-1 upon IGF-I action. Following incubation with pure tissue transglutaminase (Tg), IGFBP-1 formed covalently linked multimers that were stable during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using reducing conditions. Dephosphorylated IGFBP-1 polymerized more rapidly and to a greater extent compared with native (phosphorylated) IGFBP-1. Exposure to IGF-I stimulated transglutamination of IGFBP-1 in vitro. An IGFBP-1 mutant in which Gln66-Gln67 had been altered to Ala66-Ala67 (Q66A/Q67A) was relatively resistant to polymerization by Tg compared with native IGFBP-1. Tg localized in fibroblast membranes was also shown to catalyze the formation of native IGFBP-1 multimers, however, Q66A/Q67A IGFBP-1 failed to polymerize. Although the mutant IGFBP-1 potently inhibited IGF-I stimulated protein synthesis in pSMC cultures, the same concentration of native IGFBP-1 had no inhibitory effect. The addition of higher concentrations of native IGFBP-1 did inhibit the protein synthesis response, and this degree of inhibition correlated with the amount of monomeric IGFBP-1 that was present. In conclusion, IGFBP-1 is a substrate for tissue transglutaminase and Tg leads to the formation of high molecular weight covalently linked multimers. Polymerization is an important post-translational modification of IGFBP-1 that regulates cellular responses to IGF-I.

The mechanism(s) accounting for the appearance of these multimers have not been determined.Tissue transglutaminase (transglutaminase type II) is a calcium-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the formation of isopeptide cross-links between glutamine and lysine residues and also can attach primary amines to peptide-bonded glutamines. The isopeptide cross-links are stable and resistant to proteolysis, thereby increasing resistance to chemical, enzymatic, or mechanical disruption. Tissue transglutaminase (Tg) activity is widely distributed in many tissues and organs, and it has been localized to the cytoplasm (11Greenberg C.S. Birckbichler P.J. Rice R.H. FASEB. J. 1991; 5: 3071-3077Crossref PubMed Scopus (928) Google Scholar), cell surface (12Gaudry C.A. Verderio E. Jones R.A. Smith C. Griffin M. Exp.

Chem. 1991; 266: 22501-22509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of some proteins to polymerize and form covalently linked multimers is dependent upon this activity (14Folk J.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1980; 49: 517-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar, 15Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb Haemost. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculated that IGFBP-1 might be a substrate for tissue transglutaminase and that polymerization of IGFBP-1 might change its ability to modulate IGF-I actions in vitro. The current studies were undertaken to determine whether tissue transglutaminase could catalyze the polymerization of IGFBP-1, to identify the factors that enhanced or inhibited polymerization, and to analyze the effect of polymerization upon IGF-I actions.DISCUSSIONThe current studies demonstrate that IGFBP-1 is a substrate for tissue Tg and that Gln66-Gln67 is a one of the amine acceptor sites in IGFBP-1. This polymerization-resistant mutant form of IGFBP-1 potently inhibits IGF-I-stimulated protein synthesis into pSMC. In contrast, when polymerizable native IGFBP-1 was added, much higher concentrations were required to inhibit IGF-I action. The polymerization of IGFBP-1 by tissue Tg was also shown to be altered by the phosphorylation state of IGFBP-1 and by the presence of IGF-I in the incubation buffer.Numerous proteins have been demonstrated as substrates for Tg; however, a general consensus recognition sequence for transglutaminase has not been determined. Two directly adjacent glutamine residues have frequently been identified as amine-accepting sites. The γ-chain of fibrinogen (23Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr.

In addition, positively or negatively charged amino acid residues are often found near amine acceptor sites in the sequence of these proteins. Analysis of the sequences following Gln66-Gln67 in IGFBP-1 showed that both positively (Glu65) and negatively (His70) charged residues are present (Fig. 8). The positions of charged residues in several other substrates for tissue Tg are shown for comparison. Because of these similarities, we speculated that the adjacent glutamine residues in IGFBP-1 (Gln66-Gln67) could be amine acceptor sites. The Q66A/Q67A mutant form of IGFBP-1 that was generated was resistant to polymerization by pure tissue Tg and following exposure to cell cultures that contained tissue Tg in their membrane extracts. These findings strongly support the conclusion that tissue Tg is using these residues as amine acceptor sites for cross-linking in IGFBP-1.IGFBP-1, -2, -3, and -5 have been shown to stimulate or inhibit IGF-I actions in vitro (28Hochenadl C.

Most studies have shown that excess concentrations of IGFBP-1 inhibit the IGF-I actions in vitro, particularly if high concentrations of IGFBP-1 are added using serum-free conditions (2Ritvos O.

When platelet-poor plasma is added with IGF-I and dephosphorylated IGFBP-1, IGFBP-1 has been shown to potentiate the IGF-I-stimulated DNA synthesis in cultured fibroblasts and pSMC (1Elgin R.D. Busby W.H. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3254-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation state of IGFBP-1 was also shown to be an important determinant of this response, and dephosphorylated IGFBP-1 was much more effective than phosphorylated IGFBP-1 (1Elgin R.D.

Analysis of the cell culture supernatants at the end of these incubations showed that the added IGFBP-1 had polymerized. Therefore, the current studies were undertaken to determine whether IGFBP-1 polymerized as a result of exposure to transglutaminase, if its phosphorylation status of IGF-I affected its capacity to polymerize, and if polymerization would be associated with a decrease in the ability to inhibit IGF-I-stimulated protein synthesis.IGFBP-1 is a phosphoprotein that undergoes serine phosphorylation (9Jones J.I. Busby W.H. Wright G. Smith C.E. Kimack N.M. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1125-1131Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several phosphoisoforms of IGFBP-1 have been detected in serum, and the presence of highly phosphorylated forms of IGFBP-1 in physiologic fluids has been associated with conditions in which the target tissue actions of IGF-I are being inhibited (32Frost J.P.

Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1130-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Separation of phosphoisoforms of IGFBP-1 by anion exchange chromatography has shown that chromatographic fractions that contain phosphorylated forms inhibit IGF-I actions, whereas those that are enriched in nonphosphorylated forms did not inhibit IGF-I actions (9Jones J.I.

In this study, dephosphorylated IGFBP-1 polymerized to a much greater extent compared with phosphorylated IGFBP-1. Since the ability of IGFBP-1 to polymerize has also been shown to be related to the loss of its capacity to inhibit IGF-I actions, these results suggest that this may be one mechanism by which phosphorylation of IGFBP-1 may enhance its capacity to inhibit IGF-I actions.The results of several studies have shown that the loss of the ability of IGFBP-1, IGFBP-3, and IGFBP-5 to inhibit IGF-I actions is associated with a reduction in their affinities for IGF-I (9Jones J.I.

Therefore, factors such as dephosphorylation (3Jones J.I. D'Ercole A.J. Camacho-Hubner C. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7481-7485Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) or adherence to cell surfaces (18McCusker R.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 137: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), which lower their affinity for IGF-I, will reduce their capacity to inhibit IGF-I actions, and in some cases this has been associated with stimulation of IGF-I actions (1Elgin R.D. Busby W.H. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3254-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Our results showed that the multimeric form of IGFBP-1 (Fig. 7) that occurred following transglutamination had very low binding capacity for IGF-I and that polymerization was associated with a loss of IGFBP-1's inhibitory effect. Immunoblotting analysis at the end of incubation revealed that the concentration of monomeric IGFBP-1 correlated with the extent of inhibition of IGF-I action. This result suggests that polymerization is also an important mechanism by which the inhibitory effect of IGFBP-1 is attenuated.The N-terminal domain of IGFBP-3 and -5 contain a binding site for IGF-I (39Imai Y. Moralez A. Andog U. Clarke J.B. Busby W.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18188-18194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In IGFBP-5, the IGF-I binding site is contained within amino acids 49–74, and in IGFBP-3 it is between residues 50 and 75. For IGFBP-5, the charged residue Lys68 and the hydrophobic residues Pro69, Leu70, Leu73, and Leu74 are required for binding. In the IGFBP-1, residues Pro68, Leu69, and Leu70 are homologous, suggesting that this is also an important site in IGFBP-1 for IGF-I binding. Our results demonstrate that following transglutamination, which occurs through Gln66-Gln67, the affinity of IGFBP-1 is markedly reduced. This suggests that cross-linking through these sites alters the conformation of the adjacent IGF-I binding site such that IGF-I has reduced access.Our results also show that IGF-I stimulates the polymerization of IGFBP-1 by pure tissue Tg and by the Tg that was contained in fibroblast membrane extracts. The effect is direct and does not require the presence of some other component. Since IGF-I is probably binding to the region of IGFBP-1 that contains the amine acceptor sites, its presence may induce a conformational change in IGFBP-1 that stabilizes the conformation of the multimeric forms and facilitates cross-linking by tissue Tg.Recently, tissue Tg has been shown to associate with β1and β3 integrins, and it has been estimated that 5–40% of β1 integrins on the cell surface are complexed with tissue transglutaminase. Tissue Tg on the cell surface has been shown to increase cell adhesion and spreading on fibronectin (40Akimov S.S. Krylov D. Fleischman L.F. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). IGFBP-1 has been shown to bind to the α5β1 integrin and stimulate cell migration independently of IGF-I (41Frost R.A. Lang C.H. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3962-3970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand occupancy of α5β1 by IGFBP-1 has been shown to induce focal adhesion kinase and PI 3-kinase. Therefore, IGFBP-1 could form an IGFBP-1-tissue Tg complex with the β1integrin, and transglutamination of IGFBP-1 could potentially modulate the α5β1 integrin-linked signaling. Elucidation of the interaction between IGFBP-1 and tissue Tg will be a great help in further analysis of the biological significance of multiple IGFBP-1/IGF-I interactions that occur in vivo. Insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I and IGF-II)1 are associated with their specific binding proteins (IGFBPs) in extracellular fluids, and these binding proteins regulate IGF actions (1Elgin R.D.

Analysis of the sequences following Gln66-Gln67 in IGFBP-1 showed that both positively (Glu65) and negatively (His70) charged residues are present (Fig. 8). The positions of charged residues in several other substrates for tissue Tg are shown for comparison. Because of these similarities, we speculated that the adjacent glutamine residues in IGFBP-1 (Gln66-Gln67) could be amine acceptor sites. The Q66A/Q67A mutant form of IGFBP-1 that was generated was resistant to polymerization by pure tissue Tg and following exposure to cell cultures that contained tissue Tg in their membrane extracts. These findings strongly support the conclusion that tissue Tg is using these residues as amine acceptor sites for cross-linking in IGFBP-1.IGFBP-1, -2, -3, and -5 have been shown to stimulate or inhibit IGF-I actions in vitro (28Hochenadl C.

Therefore, the current studies were undertaken to determine whether IGFBP-1 polymerized as a result of exposure to transglutaminase, if its phosphorylation status of IGF-I affected its capacity to polymerize, and if polymerization would be associated with a decrease in the ability to inhibit IGF-I-stimulated protein synthesis.IGFBP-1 is a phosphoprotein that undergoes serine phosphorylation (9Jones J.I.

In this study, dephosphorylated IGFBP-1 polymerized to a much greater extent compared with phosphorylated IGFBP-1. Since the ability of IGFBP-1 to polymerize has also been shown to be related to the loss of its capacity to inhibit IGF-I actions, these results suggest that this may be one mechanism by which phosphorylation of IGFBP-1 may enhance its capacity to inhibit IGF-I actions.The results of several studies have shown that the loss of the ability of IGFBP-1, IGFBP-3, and IGFBP-5 to inhibit IGF-I actions is associated with a reduction in their affinities for IGF-I (9Jones J.I.

Therefore, factors such as dephosphorylation (3Jones J.I. D'Ercole A.J. Camacho-Hubner C. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7481-7485Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) or adherence to cell surfaces (18McCusker R.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 137: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), which lower their affinity for IGF-I, will reduce their capacity to inhibit IGF-I actions, and in some cases this has been associated with stimulation of IGF-I actions (1Elgin R.D. Busby W.H. Clemmons D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3254-3258Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Our results showed that the multimeric form of IGFBP-1 (Fig. 7) that occurred following transglutamination had very low binding capacity for IGF-I and that polymerization was associated with a loss of IGFBP-1's inhibitory effect. Immunoblotting analysis at the end of incubation revealed that the concentration of monomeric IGFBP-1 correlated with the extent of inhibition of IGF-I action. This result suggests that polymerization is also an important mechanism by which the inhibitory effect of IGFBP-1 is attenuated.The N-terminal domain of IGFBP-3 and -5 contain a binding site for IGF-I (39Imai Y. Moralez A. Andog U. Clarke J.B. Busby W.H. Clemmons D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18188-18194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In IGFBP-5, the IGF-I binding site is contained within amino acids 49–74, and in IGFBP-3 it is between residues 50 and 75. For IGFBP-5, the charged residue Lys68 and the hydrophobic residues Pro69, Leu70, Leu73, and Leu74 are required for binding. In the IGFBP-1, residues Pro68, Leu69, and Leu70 are homologous, suggesting that this is also an important site in IGFBP-1 for IGF-I binding. Our results demonstrate that following transglutamination, which occurs through Gln66-Gln67, the affinity of IGFBP-1 is markedly reduced. This suggests that cross-linking through these sites alters the conformation of the adjacent IGF-I binding site such that IGF-I has reduced access.Our results also show that IGF-I stimulates the polymerization of IGFBP-1 by pure tissue Tg and by the Tg that was contained in fibroblast membrane extracts. The effect is direct and does not require the presence of some other component. Since IGF-I is probably binding to the region of IGFBP-1 that contains the amine acceptor sites, its presence may induce a conformational change in IGFBP-1 that stabilizes the conformation of the multimeric forms and facilitates cross-linking by tissue Tg.Recently, tissue Tg has been shown to associate with β1and β3 integrins, and it has been estimated that 5–40% of β1 integrins on the cell surface are complexed with tissue transglutaminase. Tissue Tg on the cell surface has been shown to increase cell adhesion and spreading on fibronectin (40Akimov S.S. Krylov D. Fleischman L.F. Belkin A.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 825-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). IGFBP-1 has been shown to bind to the α5β1 integrin and stimulate cell migration independently of IGF-I (41Frost R.A. Lang C.H. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 3962-3970Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand occupancy of α5β1 by IGFBP-1 has been shown to induce focal adhesion kinase and PI 3-kinase. Therefore, IGFBP-1 could form an IGFBP-1-tissue Tg complex with the β1integrin, and transglutamination of IGFBP-1 could potentially modulate the α5β1 integrin-linked signaling. Elucidation of the interaction between IGFBP-1 and tissue Tg will be a great help in further analysis of the biological significance of multiple IGFBP-1/IGF-I interactions that occur in vivo. The current studies demonstrate that IGFBP-1 is a substrate for tissue Tg and that Gln66-Gln67 is a one of the amine acceptor sites in IGFBP-1. This polymerization-resistant mutant form of IGFBP-1 potently inhibits IGF-I-stimulated protein synthesis into pSMC. In contrast, when polymerizable native IGFBP-1 was added, much higher concentrations were required to inhibit IGF-I action. The polymerization of IGFBP-1 by tissue Tg was also shown to be altered by the phosphorylation state of IGFBP-1 and by the presence of IGF-I in the incubation buffer. Numerous proteins have been demonstrated as substrates for Tg; however, a general consensus recognition sequence for transglutaminase has not been determined. Two directly adjacent glutamine residues have frequently been identified as amine-accepting sites. The γ-chain of fibrinogen (23Jones J.I. Clemmons D.R. Endocr.

These PPIases consist of an NH2-terminal WW domain that binds to specific phosphoserine- or phosphothreonine-proline motifs present in a subset of phosphoproteins and a COOH-terminal PPIase domain that specifically isomerizes the phosphorylated serine/threonine-proline peptide bonds. Here, we describe the isolation of MdPin1, a Pin1 homologue from the plant species apple (Malus domestica) and show that it has the same phosphorylation-specific substrate specificity and can be inhibited by juglone in vitro, as is the case for Pin1. A search in the plant expressed sequence tag data bases reveals that the Pin1-type PPIases are present in various plants, and there are multiple genes in one organism, such as soybean (Glycine max) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum). Furthermore, all these plant Pin1-type PPIases, including AtPin1 inArabidopsis thaliana, do not have a WW domain, but all contain a four-amino acid insertion next to the phospho-specific recognition site of the active site. Interestingly, like Pin1, both MdPin1 and AtPin1 are able to rescue the lethal mitotic phenotype of a temperature-sensitive mutation in the Pin1 homologueESS1/PTF1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, deleting the extra four amino acid residues abolished the ability of AtPin1 to rescue the yeast mutation under non-overexpression conditions, indicating that these extra amino acids may be important for mediating the substrate interaction of plant enzymes. Finally, expression of MdPin1 is tightly associated with cell division both during apple fruit development in vivo and during cell cultures in vitro. These results have demonstrated that phosphorylation-specific PPIases are highly conserved functionally in yeast, animal, and plant species. Furthermore, the experiments suggest that although plant Pin1-type enzymes do not have a WW domain, they may fulfill the same functions as Pin1 and its homologues do in other organisms.

Cell. 1998; 92: 141-143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The PPIases are ubiquitous enzymes and have been shown to be involved in protein folding, protein translocation through biological membranes, and signal transduction (1Galat A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 216: 689-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar,4Matouschek A. Rospert S. Schmid K. Glick B.S. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2654-2662Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Three structurally distinct families of PPIases have been identified so far. Cyclophilins and FK506-binding proteins are two well characterized families of PPIases, which are targets for the immunosuppressive drugs cyclosporin A and FK506, respectively (2Schmid F.X. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 993-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 6Schreiber S.L. Science. 1991; 251: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar,7Fischer G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1994; 33: 1415-1436Crossref Scopus (327) Google Scholar). However, inhibition of the PPIase activity of cyclophilins and FK506-binding proteins is not required for the immunosuppressive property of cyclosporin A and FK506 (8Liu J. Farmer Jr., J.D. Lane W.S. Friedman J. Weissman I. Schreiber S.L. Cell. 1991; 66: 807-815Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3617) Google Scholar). Furthermore, despite their high conservation in various organisms, no member of the cyclophilin or FK506-binding protein families seems to be essential, because a yeast strain with deletions in all these PPIases is still viable (9Dolinski K. Muir S. Cardenas M. Heitman J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 13093-13098Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Thus, evidence for the biological importance of the isomerase activity in these two PPIase families has been limited. Recently, a third family of PPIases, with the Escherichia coli parvulin being the prototype, has been described. Among this family are the highly conserved Pin1-type PPIases (10Hanes S.D. Shank P.R. Bostian K.A. Yeast. 1989; 5: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 11Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar), which are the only PPIases that seem to be essential for cell survival, at least in budding yeast and HeLa cells. The Pin1-type PPIases, such as the human Pin1 (11Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar), Saccharomyces cerevisiae ESS1/Ptf1 (10Hanes S.D.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1315-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and others, consist of an amino-terminal WW domain and a carboxyl-terminal PPIase domain. WW domains, which are characterized by two invariant tryptophans, are present in a variety of signaling and regulatory proteins and were originally identified as protein interaction modules that bind to proline-rich regions in protein targets (18Sudol M. Chen H.I. Bougeret C. Einbond A. Bork P. FEBS Lett. 1995; 369: 67-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 19Sudol M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1996; 65: 113-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). The WW domain of Pin1 has recently been shown to function as a phosphoprotein-binding module that binds to specific phosphoserine- and phosphothreonine-proline (pSer/pThr-Pro) motifs (20Lu P.J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Because these motifs are targets for some proline-directed kinases in the cell cycle, activation of these kinases is thought to create the binding sites for the WW domain of Pin1 (21Zhou X.Z. Lu P.-J. Wulf G. Lu K.P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 788-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The PPIase domain of the Pin1-type proteins shows some homology to the E. coli parvulin (22Rahfeld J.U. Rucknagel K.P. Schelbert B. Ludwig B. Hacker J. Mann K. Fischer G. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) and the human parvulin homologue, hPar14 (23Uchida T. Fujimori F. Tradler T. Fischer G. Rahfeld J.U. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 278-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, in contrast to other parvulin-type PPIases, all members of the Pin1-type PPIases exhibit a very distinct substrate specificity. They specifically isomerize only phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro bonds, but not their nonphosphorylated counterparts (24Ranganathan R. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 25Yaffe M.B. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X.Z. Stukenberg P.T. Rahfeld J.U. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Fischer G. Cantley L.C. Lu K.P. Science. 1997; 278: 1957-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). As proposed earlier (26Landrieu I. De Veylder L. Fruchart J.S. Odaert B. Casteels P. Portetelle D. Van Montagu M. Inze D. Lippens G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10577-10581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the phosphorylation-specific eukaryotic PPIases have been designated Pin1-type PPIases for clarity throughout this article. Significantly, phosphorylation on Ser/Thr-Pro motifs further restrains the already slow cis/trans prolyl isomerization of peptide bonds (25Yaffe M.B. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X.Z. Stukenberg P.T. Rahfeld J.U. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Fischer G. Cantley L.C. Lu K.P. Science. 1997; 278: 1957-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 27Schutkowski M. Bernhardt A. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Reimer U. Rahfeld J.U. Lu K.P. Fischer G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5566-5575Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphorylation also renders pSer/pThr-Pro peptide bonds resistant to the catalytic action of other PPIases characterized so far (25Yaffe M.B. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X.Z. Stukenberg P.T. Rahfeld J.U. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Fischer G. Cantley L.C. Lu K.P. Science. 1997; 278: 1957-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Therefore, phosphorylation on Ser/Thr-Pro leads to a distinct structural feature that cannot be achieved by phosphorylation on other Ser/Thr sites that are not followed by a proline, and Pin1-type PPIases are unique isomerases that specifically isomerize phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro bonds (21Zhou X.Z. Lu P.-J. Wulf G. Lu K.P. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 788-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). As an essential mitotic regulator in budding yeast and HeLa cells, Pin1 binds to a defined subset of phosphoproteins, many of which are also recognized by the mitosis- and phospho-specific monoclonal antibody MPM-2, like Cdc25, tau, and the COOH-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II (25Yaffe M.B. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X.Z. Stukenberg P.T. Rahfeld J.U. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Fischer G. Cantley L.C. Lu K.P.

Furthermore, Pin1 regulates the functions of its binding proteins, including inhibiting the mitosis-promoting activity of Cdc25C (28Shen M. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Lu K.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar) and restoring the biological activity of Alzheimer-associated tau protein (29Lu P.J. Wulf G. Zhou X.Z. Davies P. Lu K.P. Nature. 1999; 399: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Depletion or mutations of Pin1 induce premature mitotic entry and mitotic arrest in yeast, HeLa cells, and Xenopus egg extracts (11Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar, 13Hani J. Schelbert B. Bernhardt A. Domdey H. Fischer G. Wiebauer K. Rahfeld J.U. J. Biol.

Pin1 is also required for the replication checkpoint in Xenopusextracts (16Winkler K.E. Swenson K.I. Kornbluth S. Means A.R. Science. 2000; 287: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in neurons of Alzheimer's disease patients, depletion of Pin1 is associated with hyperphosphorylated tau and neuronal loss (29Lu P.J. Wulf G. Zhou X.Z. Davies P. Lu K.P. Nature. 1999; 399: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). In addition, ESS1/PTF1 seems to play an important role in mRNA maturation, because its mutation leads to a defect in 3′-end formation of pre-mRNAs (13Hani J. Schelbert B. Bernhardt A. Domdey H. Fischer G. Wiebauer K. Rahfeld J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 108-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Recently, a link between ESS1/PTF1 and the general transcription machinery via its interaction with the phosphorylated COOH-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II has been described (30Wu X. Wilcox C.B. Devasahayam G. Hackett R.L. Arevalo-Rodriguez M. Cardenas M.E. Heitman J. Hanes S.D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3727-3738Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Recent results from our laboratory indicate that the phosphatase PP2A is conformation-specific, dephosphorylating only the trans isomer of its specific pSer/pThr-Pro targets. Interestingly, the dephosphorylation of a protein or peptide by PP2A can be dramatically influenced by the PPIase activity of Pin1, which apparently converts cispSer/pThr-Pro bonds in the substrate into PP2A-accessibletrans peptide bonds (31Zhou X.Z. Kops O. Werner A. Lu P.-J. Shen M. Stoller G. Küllertz G. Stark M. Fischer G. Lu K.P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a function in protein folding has been suggested for the N. crassa proteinSsp1, because it is able to accelerate the refolding of urea-denatured dihydrofolate reductase in vitro (15Kops O. Eckerskorn C. Hottenrott S. Fischer G. Mi H. Tropschug M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31971-31976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Recently, a new member of the Pin1-type PPIases, AtPin1, from the plantArabidopsis thaliana has been reported (26Landrieu I. De Veylder L. Fruchart J.S. Odaert B. Casteels P. Portetelle D. Van Montagu M. Inze D. Lippens G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10577-10581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). AtPin1 lacks an NH2-terminal WW domain but has significant homology to the PPIase domain of Pin1 and as such a strong substrate specificity toward phosphoserine-proline in a two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy PPIase assay (26Landrieu I. De Veylder L. Fruchart J.S. Odaert B. Casteels P. Portetelle D. Van Montagu M. Inze D. Lippens G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10577-10581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, it has not been described whether AtPin1 has any role in cell cycle progression. Here we describe the isolation and functional characterization of aMalus domestica Pin1 homologue, MdPin1, which has the characteristic Pin1-type PPIase domain but lacks the NH2-terminal WW domain. In the standard protease-coupled PPIase assay, MdPin1 exhibits the same phosphorylation-specific substrate specificity and can be inhibited by juglone, as is the case for human Pin1. A search in the plant EST data bases reveals that all plant Pin1-type PPIases do not contain a WW domain, but all contain a four-amino acid insertion next to the phospho-specific recognition site of the active site. Interestingly, like Pin1, both MdPin1 and AtPin1 are able to rescue the lethal mitotic phenotype of a temperature-sensitive mutation in the Pin1 homologueESS1/PTF1 gene in S. cerevisiae. In contrast, deleting the extra four amino acid residues abolished the ability of AtPin1 to rescue the yeast mutation. Finally, Northern blot analysis indicates that expression of MdPin1 is tightly associated with cell division of the plant cell in growing apple fruit in vivoand in suspension cell cultures in vitro. These results have demonstrated for the first time that the function of phosphorylation-specific prolyl isomerases is highly conserved in plants and have further suggested that although plant Pin1-type enzymes do not have a WW domain, they may fulfill the same functions as Pin1 and its homologues do in other organisms. The template cDNA was synthesized from poly(A) mRNA extracted from apple (M. domestica cv. Granny Smith) fruitlets harvested 2 days after pollination plus gibberellin treatment as described by Dong et al. (32Dong Y.H. Kvarnheden A. Yao J.L. Sutherland P. Atkinson R.G. Morris B.A. Gardner R.C. Sex. Plant Reprod. 1998; 11: 277-283Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). DNA fragments were amplified from the cDNA using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with the two degenerative primers MADS-4 (5′-CGTCTAGAATTCATGGCNMGNGGNAARAT) and MADS-5 (5′CGCTCGAGGATCCACRTTRTARTCNCCNYC) (M = AC). The primers were designed according to the conserved amino acid sequences MARGKI in the MADS-box domain and GGDYNV in the COOH-terminal region of an alignment of the three MADS-box genes APETALA3,pMADS1, and Deficiens. The underlinedEcoRI and BamHI sites were used for cloning the PCR product. The conditions for the PCR reaction were as follows: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 4 min; then 35 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 3 min; and a final extension of 5 min at 72 °C. The amplified DNA fragments of ∼600 bp were cloned into the Blueskript SK vector (Stratagene, San Diego, CA) using EcoRI and BamHI and sequenced. Using the sequence information, the gene-specific primer PPI-1 (5′-GGCATCGTGGAAGGATCCTGAAGG) was designed. The 3′ region of the MdPin1 gene was amplified using PPI-1, and the 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends primer (5′-GAGAGAGAACTAGTCTCGAG), which anneals to the adapter used in the cDNA library synthesis. The PCR conditions were the same as above. The amplified fragments were cloned into the pGEM-T EASY vector (Promega) and sequenced. A BamHI site in the primer PPI-1 was used to join the 5′ and 3′ clones to obtain a full-length cDNA. AtPin1 was amplified from A. thaliana using PCR based on a published sequence (26Landrieu I. De Veylder L. Fruchart J.S. Odaert B. Casteels P. Portetelle D. Van Montagu M. Inze D. Lippens G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10577-10581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and its deletion mutant was made using a PCR-based mutagenesis technique and confirmed by sequencing, as described previously (28Shen M. Stukenberg P.T. Kirschner M.W. Lu K.P. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 706-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 29Lu P.J. Wulf G. Zhou X.Z. Davies P. Lu K.P. Nature. 1999; 399: 784-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from young (1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks following hand pollination) and mature apple fruits using the methods of Chang et al. (33Chang S. Puryear J. Cairney J. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1993; 11: 113-116Crossref Scopus (2977) Google Scholar) and from cell suspension cultures using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.). The cell suspension cultures were derived from the cortex of apple fruit (34Barker L.D.P. Templeton M.D. Fergueson I.B. Planta. 1998; 207: 197-204Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and maintained in liquid medium with 4.5 μm2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (35Codron H. Latche A. Pech B. Nebie B. Fallot J. Plant Sci. Lett. 1977; 17: 29-35Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Because the cell growth in the liquid culture reaches the stationary phase after 7 days, 40 ml of these cultures were transferred into 100 ml of fresh medium every week to maintain growth. For RNA extraction, aliquots of the cell culture were sampled at day 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 11. Northern blots were prepared by transferring 10 μg of RNA from each time point to Hybond-N+ nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following agarose gel electrophoresis. The Northern blots were probed with [32P]dCTP-labeled MdPin1 cDNA. Membranes were hybridized in 0.5 m NaPO4 buffer (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, 7% SDS at 65 °C and washed using 0.4 × SSC, 0.2% SDS at 65 °C. Autoradiographs were exposed for 2 days at −70 °C. Recombinant MdPin1 protein was produced by subcloning the MdPin1 cDNA into the pGEX-2T vector. PPIase activity was assayed by monitoring the absorbance of released 4-nitroaniline at 390 nm at 4 °C in triplicate, as described (25Yaffe M.B. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X.Z. Stukenberg P.T. Rahfeld J.U. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Fischer G. Cantley L.C. Lu K.P. Science. 1997; 278: 1957-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Briefly, enzymes were pre-incubated with substrate in a buffer containing 35 mmHEPES, pH 7.8, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin for 5 min. The reaction was initiated by the addition of the protease stock solution. Measurement of the bimolecular rate constantskcat/Km for the PPIase-catalyzed isomerization was performed by a protocol modified from Fischer et al. (7Fischer G. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1994; 33: 1415-1436Crossref Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Because [S]0 ≪ Km was valid, absorbance data points were fitted to a first-order kinetics. Thekcat/Km values were calculated according to the equationkcat/Km = (kobs - ku)/[PPIase], whereku is the first-order rate constant for spontaneouscis/trans isomerization, andkobs is the pseudo-first-order rate constant forcis/trans isomerization in the presence of PPIase. Inhibition of PPIase activity by juglone was performed by pre-incubating enzymes with different concentrations of juglone for 4 h, followed by PPIase assay, as described previously (36Hennig L. Christner C. Kipping M. Schelbert B. Rucknagel K.P. Grabley S. Kullertz G. Fischer G. Biochemistry. 1988; 37: 5953-5960Crossref Scopus (263) Google Scholar). The coding sequence of MdPin1 was cloned into the vector pBC100, which allows for galactose-induced expression of hemagglutinin-tagged proteins, as described previously (11Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). YPM2 cells were grown overnight in YAPD medium (2% Difco Bacto-peptone, 1% Difco yeast extract, 2% glucose) at 23 °C and then transformed with MdPin1/pBC100 using the polyethylene glycol method (20Lu P.J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 31Zhou X.Z. Kops O. Werner A. Lu P.-J. Shen M. Stoller G. Küllertz G. Stark M. Fischer G. Lu K.P. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 873-883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The transformed cells were plated onto minimal medium containing 2% glucose but lacking the amino acid leucine to select for transformants and grown at 23 °C for 5–7 days. Colonies were then restreaked at least two times and incubated under the same conditions. For the spotting analysis, single yeast colonies were suspended in TE buffer 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA. The A600 was adjusted to 1, a 10-fold series dilution in TE buffer was made, and 5 μl of each dilution were spotted onto the plates. All plates were made of minimal media without leucine and contained 2% glucose (no induction), a mixture of 2% glucose and 2% galactose (partial induction), or 2% galactose (full induction). The plates were incubated for several days at 23 °C (permissive conditions) or 30 °C (restrictive conditions). The same procedure was used to isolate YPM2 cells expressing human Pin1, its PPIase domain AtPin1, or its deletion mutant. As controls, cells carrying either the pBC100 vector without insert or the construct yESS1/Yep451, which allows for constitutive expression of ESS1, were used. To check for protein expression, YPM2 cells with different pBC100 constructs were grown at 23 °C in minimal media without leucine but with 2% galactose to induce protein expression. The cells were harvested and lysed with glass beads, and 50 μg of total protein extract were separated on a 17.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. After Western blotting, the expressed proteins were detected using 12CA5 monoclonal antibody. The full-length cDNA of M. domestica Pin1 (MdPin1) and the deduced amino acid sequence are shown in Fig. 1. The cDNA was cloned in two steps. First, DNA fragments of ∼600 bp were amplified from an apple fruitlet cDNA library using the two degenerated PCR primers MADS-4 and MADS-5. The primers were originally designed to detectAPETALA3-like MADS-box genes. After sequencing nine random clones, we found that they contained the same DNA sequence, which had significant sequence homology to a part of the human Pin1 (11Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). Two clones represent an independent sequence that had an 8-bp deletion in the 5′ untranslated region when compared with the other seven sequences (Fig. 1). This indicates that at least two alleles of MdPin1 were expressed in apple fruit tissues. The missing 3′ region of MdPin1 was amplified in a second step using the specific primer PPI-1 and a 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends primer. Four independent PCR fragments were analyzed and found to contain the same sequence that overlapped with the original 600-bp fragments. The full-length cDNA was then assembled by joining the 5′ and 3′ clones at theBamHI site in the overlapping region. An alignment of the MdPin1 amino acid sequence with homologues of Pin1 from selected organisms is shown in Fig.2. Pin1 and ESS1 play significant roles in the cell cycle and consist of two functional domains, the WW domain and the PPIase domain. The Pin1 WW domain is a pSer/pThr-Pro-binding module (20Lu P.J. Zhou X.Z. Shen M. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar), and the PPIase domain catalyzes sequence-specific and phosphorylationdependent prolyl isomerization (25Yaffe M.B. Schutkowski M. Shen M. Zhou X.Z. Stukenberg P.T. Rahfeld J.U. Xu J. Kuang J. Kirschner M.W. Fischer G. Cantley L.C. Lu K.P. Science. 1997; 278: 1957-1960Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). MdPin1, however, lacks the WW domain and consists only of the Pin1-type PPIase domain (Fig. 2). The absence of the NH2-terminal WW domain in the MdPin1 cDNA is probably not due to a partial sequence, because an in-frame stop codon was identified in the 5′ untranslated region.

The large subunit of U2AF recognizes the intronic polypyrimidine tract, a sequence located adjacent to the 3′ splice site that serves as an important signal for both constitutive and regulated pre-mRNA splicing. The small subunit U2AF35 interacts with the 3′ splice site dinucleotide AG and is essential for regulated splicing. Like several other proteins involved in constitutive and regulated splicing, both U2AF65 and U2AF35 contain an arginine/serine-rich (RS) domain. In the present study we determined the role of RS domains in the subcellular localization of U2AF. Both U2AF65 and U2AF35 are shown to shuttle continuously between the nucleus and the cytoplasm by a mechanism that involves carrier receptors and is independent from binding to mRNA. The RS domain on either U2AF65 or U2AF35 acts as a nuclear localization signal and is sufficient to target a heterologous protein to the nuclear speckles. Furthermore, the results suggest that the presence of an RS domain in either U2AF subunit is sufficient to trigger the nucleocytoplasmic import of the heterodimeric complex. Shuttling of U2AF between nucleus and cytoplasm possibly represents a means to control the availability of this factor to initiate spliceosome assembly and therefore contribute to regulate splicing.

Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential step in eukaryotic gene expression that is often regulated in a cell type-specific or developmental manner. The splicing reaction takes place in the spliceosome, a multicomponent RNA-protein complex containing five uracil-rich small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP)1 and 50–100 non-snRNP protein splicing factors (1Krämer A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 2Will C.L. Lührmann R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). To ensure the precise excision of introns, components of the spliceosome recognize weakly conserved sequences in the pre-mRNA (3Burge C.B. Tuschl T.H. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R.F. Cech T.R. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar). The decision to splice a given pre-mRNA and the selection of splice sites takes place during the first stages of spliceosome assembly. These early steps are therefore crucial for splicing regulation (3Burge C.B. Tuschl T.H. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R.F. Cech T.R. Atkins J.F. The RNA World.

Dev. 1997; 7: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A significant advance in understanding splice site recognition was provided by the observation that exon sequences also play a critical role in splicing. Constitutive as well as regulated exon splicing enhancers have been identified (16Reed R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 17Hertel K.J. Lynch K.W. Maniatis T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). These sequences contain binding sites for SR proteins (18Fu X.-D. RNA ( N.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar), a family of essential splicing factors with a modular structure consisting of one or two RRMs and a C-terminal arginine/serine (RS)-rich domain, involved in protein-protein interactions (20Wu J.Y.

Nature. 1994; 368: 119-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). According to a current model, SR proteins may activate splice site choice by binding to an enhancer sequence and recruiting the splicing machinery to the adjacent intron (16Reed R. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Manley J.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 358-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar).The subcellular distribution of splicing factors has been shown to be complex and dynamic, and it is increasingly believed that it may play a role in the regulation of splicing. Splicing factors accumulate in the nucleus, concentrating in structures commonly designated as nuclear speckles (26Spector D.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 265-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that nuclear speckles represent sites where splicing factors accumulate when they are not actively engaged in the splicing reaction. By an as yet unknown mechanism, splicing factors are recruited from the speckles to the sites of transcription, where splicing of most introns takes place (27Misteli T. Spector D.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 322-331Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar).A major determinant of the subcellular localization of SR proteins is the RS domain. The RS domain can function as a NLS, and it is also thought to be responsible for targeting the proteins to the nuclear speckles (28Li H. Bingham P.M. Cell. 1991; 67: 335-342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 29Hedley M.L. Amrein H. Maniatis T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Changes in the phosphorylation of the RS domain are sufficient to alter the protein-protein interactions established by SR proteins (31Xiao S.H. Manley J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6359-6367Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 32Yeakley J.M. Tronchère H. Olesen J. Dyck J.A. Wang H.-Y. Fu X.-D. J.

Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 297-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Two novel transport receptors, termed transportin-SR and transportin-SR2, bind specifically to the phosphorylated RS domain of SR proteins (35Kataoka N. Bachorik J.L. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 36Lai M.C. Lin R.I. Huang S.I. Tsai C.W. Tarn W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7950-7957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Although splicing factors are predominantly detected in the nucleus, at least some members of the SR protein family have the ability to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (37Cáceres J.F. Screaton G.R. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). The RS domain has been shown to be necessary, but not sufficient, for export of the shuttling SR proteins to the cytoplasm (30Cáceres J.F. Misteli T. Screaton G.R. Spector D.L. Krainer A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Based on the observation that SR proteins can influence splice site selection in a concentration-dependent manner (19Manley J.L. Tacke R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar, 38Cáceres J.F. Stamm S. Helfman D.M. Krainer A.R.

Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2377-2386Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that transport to the cytoplasm may provide a way to control the nuclear availability of these proteins and, hence, contribute to regulate splicing (37Cáceres J.F. Screaton G.R. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 40van der Houven van Oordt W. Diaz-Meco M.T. Lozano J. Krainer A. Moscat J. Cáceres J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar).Although they are not members of the SR protein family, both U2AF65 and U2AF35 contain an RS-like domain (10Zamore P.D. Patton J.G. Green M.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 41Zhang M. Zamore P.D. Carmo-Fonseca M. Lamond A. Green M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8769-8773Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The RS domain of U2AF65 is located in the N-terminal region of the protein and has never been shown to mediate the establishment of protein-protein interactions. Rather, it facilitates base pairing between the U2 small nuclear RNA and the branch point (42Valcárcel J. Gaur R.K. Singh R. Green M.R. Science. 1996; 273: 1706-1709Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar) and plays a role in the targeting of this protein to active splicing sites (43Gama-Carvalho M. Krauss R.D. Chiang L. Valcárcel J. Green M.R. Carmo-Fonseca M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 975-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In human U2AF35, the RS domain is C-terminal and interacts with the RS domain of SR proteins (20Wu J.Y. Maniatis T. Cell. 1993; 75: 1061-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar).In the present work we analyzed the role of the RS domain in the subcellular distribution of the heterodimeric splicing factor U2AF. Despite the fact that RS residues in U2AF are more dispersed and have less periodicity than in SR proteins, the data presented here indicate that they play a similar role in subcellular localization. We show that the RS domain on either U2AF65 or U2AF35 acts as a nuclear and subnuclear localization signal. We also show that both U2AF65 and U2AF35 shuttle continuously between the nucleus and the cytoplasm by a mechanism that involves carrier receptors and is independent from binding to mRNA. Finally, we provide evidence suggesting that the presence of an RS domain in either U2AF subunit is sufficient to trigger the nucleocytoplasmic import of the heterodimeric complex. Taken together these results suggest that nucleocytoplasmic transport of RS-containing splicing factors may represent a common pathway to control the availability of these proteins to initiate spliceosome assembly and, therefore, contribute to regulate splicing.DISCUSSIONIn this work we show that the U2AF splicing factor shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm by a carrier-mediated pathway that is independent from mRNA traffic. Several other proteins associated with pre-mRNA processing exhibit shuttling activity, namely hnRNP A1, A2, D, E, I, and K proteins (56Piñol-Roma S. Dreyfuss G. Nature. 1992; 355: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar, 58Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Shuttling of hnRNPs most likely contributes to export of mRNA to the cytoplasm (58Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 62Michael W.M. Eder P.S. Dreyfuss G.

Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), whereas SR proteins appear to leave the nucleus as a cargo bound to the mRNAs (64Stutz F. Rosbash M. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3303-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In fact, the RS domain is necessary for export of SR proteins, but unlike the M9 signal of hnRNP A1 (58Michael W.M. Choi M. Dreyfuss G. Cell. 1995; 83: 415-422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar), it is not capable of promoting export of an unrelated protein (37Cáceres J.F. Screaton G.R. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Rather, the RS domain has to be coupled to a RNA binding domain to give rise to a shuttling protein (37Cáceres J.F. Screaton G.R. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Consistent with the view that SR proteins piggyback on mRNA to exit the nucleus, several members of this family have been shown to bind to exon sequences (18Fu X.-D. RNA ( N. Y. ). 1995; 1: 663-680PubMed Google Scholar, 19Manley J.L. Tacke R. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1569-1579Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar) and to accompany the mRNA molecules in transit to the nuclear pores (65Danhehold B. Cell. 1997; 88: 585-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The association of SR proteins with spliced mRNA could therefore serve as a guide for mature RNAs to cross the nuclear pores (66Le Hir H. Moore M.J. Maquat L.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1098-1108PubMed Google Scholar). Another possibility to be considered is that SR proteins remain bound to the mRNAs in the cytoplasm and play a role as regulators of mRNA stability or translation. Since the transport of SR proteins into the nucleus is mediated by specific import receptors (35Kataoka N. Bachorik J.L. Dreyfuss G. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 145: 1145-1152Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 36Lai M.C. Lin R.I. Huang S.I. Tsai C.W. Tarn W.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7950-7957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and regulated by phosphorylation and transcriptional activity (37Cáceres J.F. Screaton G.R. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 55-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 30Cáceres J.F. Misteli T. Screaton G.R. Spector D.L. Krainer A.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar), shuttling could at the same time provide a mechanism to control nuclear availability of splicing factors in response to external signals. This would allow a rapid tuning of splicing activity. Consistent with this view, cytoplasmic accumulation of the shuttling protein hnRNP A1 has been shown to occur in response to cellular stress and to correlate with changes in alternative splicing (40van der Houven van Oordt W. Diaz-Meco M.T. Lozano J. Krainer A. Moscat J. Cáceres J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar).In contrast with SR proteins, both U2AF subunits have been shown to bind only to intronic sequences of pre-mRNA during the early steps of spliceosome assembly (10Zamore P.D. Patton J.G. Green M.R. Nature. 1992; 355: 609-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 11Wu S. Romfo C.M. Nilsen T.W. Green M.R. Nature. 1999; 402: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 12Zorio D. Blumenthal T. Nature. 1999; 402: 835-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 13Merendino L. Guth S. Bilbao B. Martinez C. Valcárcel J. Nature. 1999; 402: 838-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and to be later replaced by the U5 snRNP (67Chiara M.D. Palandjian L. Kramer R.F. Reed R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4746-4759Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Thus, it is unlikely that U2AF exits the nucleus as a passive cargo bound to mature mRNA. In agreement with this view, our data indicate that transport of U2AF to the cytoplasm does not require binding to mRNA and continues in the absence of mRNA traffic.What function could U2AF shuttling perform? Very recent data indicate that U2AF35 interacts with the mRNA export factor TAP and associates with spliced messenger RNP complexes in the nucleus, suggesting that the factor participates in coupling of splicing with export of mRNA to the cytoplasm. 2A. Zolotukhin and B. Felber, personal communication. Another possibility is that U2AF plays an as yet undetermined role in the cytoplasm. Recent observations suggest that the supply of U2AF is regulated in the cell (68Shinozaky A. Arahata K. Tsukahara T. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1999; 31: 1279-1287Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 69Maeda T. Hinamura H. Jikko A. Carcinogenesis. 1999; 20: 2341-2344Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In this context, shuttling could also represent a rapid means of controlling the level of U2AF available in the nucleus for spliceosome assembly. A mechanism of U2AF regulation by retention has been recently proposed by MacMorris et al.(70MacMorris M.A. Zorio D.A. Blumenthal T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 36: 3813-3818Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The Caenorhabditis elegans U2AF65homologue gene gives rise to two alternatively spliced mRNAs, one encoding the U2AF protein and another containing an exon with premature stop codons. This alternative mRNA is retained in the nucleus and contains 10 repeats of the 3′ splice site consensus sequence. MacMorriset al. (70MacMorris M.A. Zorio D.A. Blumenthal T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 36: 3813-3818Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar) propose that U2AF is sequestered by these repeats and consequently becomes unavailable for splicing.A unique feature of the splicing factor U2AF is that it is composed of two subunits that bind tightly to each other and form a stable complex (9Zamore P.D. Green M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9243-9247Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Copurification of both subunits suggests that at least 90% of the protein present in HeLa nuclear extracts is in a heterodimeric complex (14Guth S. Martinez C. Gaur R.K. Valcárcel J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8263-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The interaction between the two subunits has also been shown to be essential in vivo (71Rudner D.Z. Kanaar R. Breger K.S. Rio D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1765-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The data presented here indicate that deletions of the RS domain of either U2AF subunit do not alter the distribution and shuttling capacity of the protein complex. Similar results are obtained after deletion of any of the other functional domains of U2AF65, suggesting that both nuclear import and export of this protein complex are mediated by redundant signals. Furthermore, when the two subunits cannot interact, each RS domain becomes important for nuclear import. Based on these results we propose that U2AF enters and leaves the nucleus as a heterodimer, with the RS domain of each subunit serving as a redundant nuclear import and export signal. In good agreement with this view, deletion of the RS domain in either U2AF subunit is viable in vivo, whereas deletion of the RS region in both subunits simultaneously is lethal (72Rudner D.Z. Breger K.S. Rio D.C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1010-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar).In summary, the work presented here reveals a novel property of the general splicing factor U2AF, i.e. shuttling between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The RS domain present in either of the two U2AF subunits is involved in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport and subnuclear targeting, similarly to what was previously established for SR proteins. Possibly, higher eukaryotes have evolved a common pathway to control the availability of RS-containing splicing factors in the nucleus. Future studies are needed to determine how shuttling of these factors may contribute to regulate splicing. Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential step in eukaryotic gene expression that is often regulated in a cell type-specific or developmental manner. The splicing reaction takes place in the spliceosome, a multicomponent RNA-protein complex containing five uracil-rich small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP)1 and 50–100 non-snRNP protein splicing factors (1Krämer A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 367-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 2Will C.L. Lührmann R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 320-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). To ensure the precise excision of introns, components of the spliceosome recognize weakly conserved sequences in the pre-mRNA (3Burge C.B. Tuschl T.H. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R.F. Cech T.R. Atkins J.F. The RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1999Google Scholar). The decision to splice a given pre-mRNA and the selection of splice sites takes place during the first stages of spliceosome assembly. These early steps are therefore crucial for splicing regulation (3Burge C.B. Tuschl T.H. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R.F. Cech T.R. Atkins J.F. The RNA World.

Dev. 1997; 7: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). A significant advance in understanding splice site recognition was provided by the observation that exon sequences also play a critical role in splicing. Constitutive as well as regulated exon splicing enhancers have been identified (16Reed R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1996; 6: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 17Hertel K.J. Lynch K.W.

According to a current model, SR proteins may activate splice site choice by binding to an enhancer sequence and recruiting the splicing machinery to the adjacent intron (16Reed R. Curr. Opin. Genet.

The subcellular distribution of splicing factors has been shown to be complex and dynamic, and it is increasingly believed that it may play a role in the regulation of splicing. Splicing factors accumulate in the nucleus, concentrating in structures commonly designated as nuclear speckles (26Spector D.L. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 265-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence suggest that nuclear speckles represent sites where splicing factors accumulate when they are not actively engaged in the splicing reaction. By an as yet unknown mechanism, splicing factors are recruited from the speckles to the sites of transcription, where splicing of most introns takes place (27Misteli T. Spector D.L. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 322-331Crossref Scopus (205) Google Scholar). A major determinant of the subcellular localization of SR proteins is the RS domain. The RS domain can function as a NLS, and it is also thought to be responsible for targeting the"

Under denaturing conditions (urea, guanidine hydrochloride, guanidine thiocyanate, organic solvent or elevated temperature) and in the presence of thiol initiator, α-LA denatures by shuffling its four native disulfide bonds and converts to a mixture of fully oxidized scrambled structures. Analysis by reversed-phase HPLC reveals that the denatured α-LA comprises a minimum of 45 fractions of scrambled isomers. Among them, six well populated isomers have been isolated and structurally characterized. Their relative concentrations, which represent the fingerprinting of the denatured α-LA, vary substantially under different denaturing conditions. These results permit independent plotting of the denaturation and unfolding curves of α-LA. Most importantly, unique isomers of partially unfolded α-LA were shown to populate at mild and selected denaturing conditions. Organic solvent disrupts preferentially the hydrophobic α-helical domain, generating a predominant isomer containing two native disulfide bonds at the β-sheet domain and two scrambled disulfide bonds at the α-helical region. Thermal denaturation selectively unfolds the β-sheet domain of α-LA, producing a prevalent isomer that exhibits structural characteristics of the molten globule state of α-LA.

Further understanding of the denatured state of α-LA and the molten globule state of α-LA will require fractionation of diverse populations of conformational isomers that constitute the denatured α-LA. In this report, the structure of denatured α-LA has been analyzed by the technique of disulfide scrambling (43Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which permits fractionation and quantitative analysis of the denatured isomers. In the presence of denaturant and thiol initiator, the native α-LA denatures by shuffling its native disulfide bonds and converts to a mixture of fully oxidized scrambled isomers that are trapped by non-native disulfide bonds. α-LA contains four disulfide bonds and may adopt 104 possible scrambled isomers. The technique of disulfide scrambling (43Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) presents numerous advantages for characterizing the structure of denatured α-LA. 1) Scrambled isomers of α-LA are not interconvertible in the absence of thiol catalyst or acidic pH. Because of their stability and diverse physicochemical properties, scrambled isomers of α-LA can be separated and purified by liquid chromatography and structurally characterized (43Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 44Chang J.-Y. Maerki W. Lai P.H.

This permits a more detailed description of the structure of denatured α-LA that is not attainable with conventional methods. 2) Scrambled isomers of α-LA contain different sizes of disulfide loops and adopt varied degree of unfolding. Compositional analysis of scrambled isomers allows evaluation of the extent of unfolding of the denatured α-LA (43Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 44Chang J.-Y. Maerki W. Lai P.H.

Chem. 2000; 275: 14205-14211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). 3) The process of denaturation of α-LA can be monitored in a time-course manner by acid trapping of unfolding intermediates. This permits identification and isolation of structurally defined intermediates present along the unfolding pathway of α-LA. Specifically, it will allow us to examine the structure of scrambled isomers that constitute the molten globule state of α-LA. Our specific aims are as follows: 1) to analyze the structure and heterogeneity of denatured α-LA, 2) to elucidate the unfolding pathway of α-LA denatured under increasing concentrations of selected denaturants, and 3) to characterize the molecular structure of the molten globule state of α-LA. Calcium-depleted bovine α-LA (L-6010) was used throughout this study and was obtained from Sigma. The protein was further purified by HPLC and was shown to be more than 97% pure. GdmCl, GdmSCN, urea, acetonitrile, and 2-mercaptoethanol were also purchased from Sigma with a grade purity of greater than 99%. The native α-LA (0.5 mg/ml) was dissolved in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m), pH 8.4, containing 2-mercaptoethanol (0.02–0.25 mm) and selected concentrations of denaturants (urea, GdmCl, GdmSCN, or acetonitrile). Denaturation was typically performed at 23 °C for 24–48 h. In the case of thermal denaturation, the sample (in the presence of 0.1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) was subjected to elevated temperature (45–65 °C) for a time period of up to 60 min. To monitor the kinetics and intermediates of unfolding, aliquots of the sample were removed in a time-course manner, quenched with an equal volume of 4% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, and analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC. The denatured sample was subsequently acidified with 4% trifluoroacetic acid and stored at −20 °C. The end point of denaturation, under a given denaturing condition, implies that conversion of the native species to the scrambled isomers has reached a state of equilibrium. This state of equilibrium also includes those among scrambled isomers. The major criteria to ensure that denaturation has reached equilibrium is time-course kinetics analysis, which indicates that conversion of the native α-LA to the scrambled species has reached a plateau, and the ratio of scrambled to the native species remains constant during prolonged sample incubation. Another method to verify the state of equilibrium of denaturation is to renature (refold) the extensively unfolded α-LA under the same conditions that denature the native α-LA, for instance, by allowing the sample denatured with 8m GdmCl to refold after dilution of the denaturant. Both renaturation and denaturation are expected to reach the same state of equilibrium and generate end products that consist of the same ratio of scrambled to native species (49Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar). A systematic study has shown that denaturation of α-LA by denaturants (in the presence of 0.1–0.25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) completed generally within 2 h (see Fig. 2). Nonetheless, the reaction has been routinely allowed to proceed overnight (24 h). On the other hand, completion of denaturation of α-LA by acetonitrile is relative slow and requires about 15 h. In the case of thermal denaturation, there are inherent risks of prolonged sample incubation because of the heat-induced decomposition of disulfide bonds. Experiments of thermal denaturation of α-LA were therefore performed only in a time-course manner within 60 min. The denatured α-LA may adopt varied degrees of unfolding. Denaturation and unfolding are therefore two distinct terms. Using the method of disulfide scrambling (43Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), it is possible to observe and follow simultaneously the process of denaturation and unfolding of α-LA. The extent of denaturation of α-LA is defined by the simple conversion of the native structure to non-native structures (scrambled isomers). There are 104 scrambled isomers of denatured α-LA versusone isomer of the native α-LA. Unfolding of α-LA is defined by the state of denatured α-LA and is structurally characterized by the composition (relative concentration) among the 104 scrambled isomers. The denaturation curve of α-LA was determined by the fraction (%) of the native α-LA converted to the scrambled isomers. Quantitative analysis of the relative yield of scrambled and the native isomer was based on the integration of HPLC peak areas. There are two types of denaturation curves: 1) kinetic denaturation curve was calculated and derived from samples denatured in a time-course manner under fixed denaturing conditions, and 2) thermodynamic denaturation curve was derived from those that have attained the end point (equilibrium) of denaturation under increasing concentrations of a selected denaturant. The unfolding curve of α-LA was determined by the ebb and flow of different scrambled isomers as fractions of the total denatured (scrambled) protein along the pathway of unfolding. Similar to the denaturation curve, the unfolding curve can be established as follows: 1) from samples denatured in a time-course manner by a defined denaturing condition (kinetic unfolding curve) or 2) from samples that have attained the end point of denaturation under increasing concentrations of a selected denaturant (thermodynamic unfolding curve). Calculation of the yield of scrambled isomers was based on the peak area integration. Because of the complexity of minor isomers, the data have a S.D. of ± 5%. Fractions of scrambled α-LA (∼10 μg) were isolated and treated with 1 μg of thermolysin in 30 μl ofN-ethylmorpholine/acetate buffer (50 mm), pH 6.4. Digestion was carried out at 37 °C for 16 h. Peptides were then isolated by HPLC and analyzed by amino acid sequencing and mass spectrometry to identify the disulfide-containing peptides. Amino acid sequence of disulfide-containing peptides were analyzed by automatic Edman degradation using a PerkinElmer Procise sequencer (Model 494) equipped with an online PTH-derivative amino acid analyzer. The molecular mass of peptides was determined by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Perkin-Elmer Voyager-DE STR). Scrambled species of α-LA are designated by the following formula: X-α-LA-(species assigned on HPLC), where X stands for scrambled. For instance, X-α-LA-a represents species “a” of scrambled α-LA. Denatured α-LA was shown to consist of at least 45 fractions of fully oxidized scrambled isomers. Their relative concentrations vary substantially under different denaturing conditions (see the following sections). Among them, six major fractions of scrambled α-LA were isolated and structurally characterized. They are X-α-LA-a, X-α-LA-b, X-α-LA-c, X-α-LA-d, X-α-LA-e, X-α-LA-h. After digestion with thermolysin, peptides were isolated by HPLC and were characterized by Edman sequencing and MALDI mass spectrometry to identify the peptides that contain disulfides (data available upon request). The disulfide structures are given in Fig.1. X-α-LA-a and X-α-LA-d contain, among the 104 possible isomers, the smallest sizes of disulfide loops and represent the most extensively unfolded structures of α-LA. These two isomers become well populated under strong denaturing conditions. Specifically, X-α-LA-a adopts the beads-form structure with disulfides formed by four consecutive pairs of neighboring cysteines. X-α-LA-b and X-α-LA-c are partially unfolded isomers, with X-α-LA-b possessing two native disulfide bonds within the β-sheet region and X-α-LA-c retaining two intact native disulfide bonds at the α-helical domain. Time-dependent kinetics denaturation of the native α-LA was first analyzed using 6 m urea and 4m GdmCl in the presence of varying concentrations of thiol initiator (0.02–0.25 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). These experiments were designed to establish conditions that would permit denaturation of α-LA to reach a state of equilibrium. The results are shown in Fig. 2. Both urea and GdmCl denature the native α-LA at similar rates (Fig. 2, right column). In the presence of 0.1–0.25 mm2-mercaptoethanol, denaturation of α-LA is completed within 2 h. The structure of α-LA denatured by 6 m urea comprises 4 major scrambled isomers (Fig. 2, left column). Thermodynamic denaturation of α-LA was subsequently performed in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol (0.1 mm) and increasing concentrations of urea, GdmCl and GdmSCN. Chromatograms of the denatured α-LA are shown in Fig. 3. At mild concentrations of GdmCl (1.75 m) and GdmSCN (0.75m), denatured α-LA was shown to consist of at least 45 fractions of scrambled isomers. Under strong denaturing conditions, the denatured α-LA comprises three predominant isomers (X-α-LA-a, X-α-LA-b, and X-α-LA-d). The thermodynamic denaturation curves (Fig. 4) reveal that GdmSCN is about 2- and 7-fold more potent than GdmCl and urea, respectively. In the presence of CaCl2 (5 mm), the potency of GdmCl and urea to denature the native α-LA was diminished by 2-fold. The thermodynamic unfolding curves (Fig. 5) further display the structures of denatured α-LA evolved under increasing concentrations of selected denaturants. Characteristically, the progressive unfolding of denatured α-LA is accompanied by an increasing yield of X-α-LA-a. For instance, the recovery of X-α-LA-a as a fraction of the total scrambled α-LA increases from 5 to 27% as the concentration of GdmSCN rises from 0.2 to 4m (Fig. 5). Similar phenomenon was observed with the urea and GdmCl denaturation of α-LA.Figure 4Thermodynamic denaturation curves of α-LA. These curves were derived from data presented in Fig. 3. In the case of GdmCl and urea denaturation, experiments were also performed in the presence of CaCl2 (5 mm).

These curves were derived from data presented in Fig. 3. The recoveries of seven major scrambled isomers were used to construct these curves.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Kinetic denaturation of α-LA by organic solvent was first carried out in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 m), pH 8.4, containing 40% acetonitrile. The experiments were performed both in the absence and presence of CaCl2 (5 mm, Fig.6). The results show that the rate of disulfide shuffling induced by acetonitrile is about 10-fold slower than those promoted by urea and GdmCl (Fig. 2). The reaction reaches equilibrium after about 15 h of incubation. In the absence of CaCl2 (Fig. 6, left column), unfolding of denatured α-LA proceeds through X-α-LA-c as a predominant intermediate, and the denatured sample consists of two major scrambled isomers, X-α-LA-a and X-α-LA-b. In the presence of CaCl2 (Fig. 6, right column), the yield of X-α-LA-c as unfolding intermediate diminishes drastically, and the denatured α-LA comprises one prevalent isomer, X-α-LA-b. Thermodynamic denaturation of the native α-LA was then performed with increasing concentrations of acetonitrile (10–50%, by volume). All reactions were allowed for 48 h to ensure the state of equilibrium. The experiments were also conducted in the absence and presence of CaCl2, and the results are presented in Fig.7. Abrupt denaturation of α-LA occurs at between 20 and 30% (1.82–3.64 m) acetonitrile. The thermodynamic unfolding curves demonstrate that in the absence of CaCl2, unfolding of denatured α-LA is characterized by an increasing yield of both X-α-LA-a and X-α-LA-b. (Fig.7 A). In the presence of CaCl2, the structure of denatured α-LA is dominated by the isomer X-α-LA-b (Fig.7 B). Thermal denaturation of disulfide-containing proteins can be practically performed only in a kinetic fashion. This is because prolonged incubation at high temperature in alkaline pH may lead to the decomposition of the disulfide bonds of scrambled isomers. The native α-LA was therefore denatured at 45–65 °C for up to 60 min. The rate of α-LA denaturation increases by 3- and 5-fold as the temperature rises from 45 to 55 °C and 65 °C, respectively (Fig.8). At 65 °C, the presence of CaCl2 (5 mm) reduces the rate of denaturation by a factor of about 3-fold (Fig. 8). Heat-denatured α-LA comprises many of the isomers found within the structures of α-LA denatured by GdmCl and GdmSCN (Fig.9). The most striking feature is the prevalence of X-α-LA-c during the early stage of thermal denaturation. Under selected denaturing conditions (e.g.65 °C, 2 min), the yield of X-α-LA-c may account for as much as 40% of the total content of the denatured α-LA. This is clearly demonstrated by the kinetic unfolding curves of thermal denaturation of α-LA (Fig. 9 A). The inclusion of CaCl2, which binds to the β-sheet domain of α-LA, inhibits not only the rate of thermal denaturation (Fig. 8) but also the prevalence of X-α-LA-c as the unfolding intermediate (Fig. 9, B and top right HPLC chromatograms). Structural analysis of denatured proteins is inherently difficult. Unlike the native protein, which usually adopts a well defined structure, a denatured protein comprises highly heterogeneous conformational isomers that generally exist in a state of equilibrium (30Dill K.A. Shortle D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 795-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar, 31Tanford C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 121-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar). It is a daunting task to attempt isolation and analysis of denatured conformational isomers, not only because of the exceedingly large number of isomers that may exist, but also because of their instability and rapid interconversion. Without isolation of conformational isomers, the structural property of a denatured protein has been typically concluded from the measurement of the collective isomers using various spectroscopic techniques (47Tanford C. Kawahara K. Lapanje S. Hooker Jr., T.M. Zarlengo M.H. Salahuddin A. Aune K.C. Takagi T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1967; 89: 5023-5029Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 48Kuwajima K. Ogawa Y. Sugai S. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 878-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 49Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar, 50Shortle D.

A. 1990; 87: 573-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar). This has been the case for the analysis of most denatured proteins, including α-LA. The technique of disulfide scrambling permits isomers of a denatured protein to be trapped by non-native disulfide bonds. Such stabilized isomers can be separated by liquid chromatography and structurally characterized (43Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). For a protein that contains four disulfide bonds, like α-LA, there exist 104 possible species of scrambled isomers. Denatured α-LA was shown to comprise about 50% of these possible isomers. The heterogeneity is dependent upon the denaturing conditions and is most evident for samples denatured at elevated temperature (Fig.9) or low concentrations of denaturants (Fig. 3). A similar extent of structural heterogeneity was observed with several three-disulfide models. In the case of hirudin (45Bulychev A. Chang J.-Y. J. Prot. Chem. 1999; 18: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), tick anticoagulant peptide (43Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor (46Chang J.-Y. Li L. Canals F. Aviles F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14205-14211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), about 50–80% of the possible scrambled isomers were demonstrated to constitute their denatured structures. Denaturation curves of α-LA have been determined here using the technique of disulfide scrambling (Fig. 4). They are comparable with those evaluated by the CD signal of α-LA (1Kuwajima K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 6: 87-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar). Both techniques reveal that α-LA (calcium-depleted) denatures precipitously at 1–2 m GdmCl. The signal for disulfide shuffling is as sensitive as that of fluorescence or CD spectra (49Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar) in measuring the denaturation curves of proteins. This was demonstrated in the case of RNase A (52Chang J.-Y. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 268: 147-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) and potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor (46Chang J.-Y. Li L. Canals F. Aviles F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14205-14211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Aside from α-LA, conformational stability of seven different disulfide proteins were similarly investigated using the technique of disulfide scrambling. Their relative stability is presented in TableI. The comparison is defined by the concentration of a denaturant required to achieve 50% of the protein denaturation thermodynamically. Among them, calcium-depleted α-LA represents the least stable protein. It is about 2-fold less stable than RNase A, a protein also containing four disulfide bonds and having a size almost identical to that of α-LA. However, calcium-bound α-LA exhibits stability similar to that of RNase A (Table I). The following can be concluded from evaluation of this data. 1) These results demonstrate and confirm that GdmSCN is typically 2–3-fold more potent than GdmCl, which in turn is an additional 2–3-fold more effective than urea (49Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar). 2) Ranking of protein stability depends upon the nature of denaturant. For example, based on the GdmSCN denaturation curves, IGF-1 is 1.5-fold more stable than tick anticoagulant peptide. This order is reversed when comparison of their stability is based on GdmCl denaturation curves (Table I). 3) Numerous proteins are barely denatured by 8 m urea, a condition that is general considered as being capable to fully denature proteins (31Tanford C. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 121-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (2414) Google Scholar). The most remarkable case is BPTI, which remains practically intact at 8m urea (53Chang J.-Y. Ballatore A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For hirudin and EGF, less than 15% is denatured under the same condition (45Bulychev A. Chang J.-Y. J. Prot. Chem. 1999; 18: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).Table IThe concentration of denaturant required to denature 50% of the proteinProteins 1-aDetermined by the method of disulfide scrambling between the native and scrambled isomers.

Open table in a new tab The unfolding curves of α-LA are derived from the structural analysis of denatured α-LA, which is characterized by the composition of its scrambled species. The structure of denatured α-LA varies, depending on the kinetics of denaturation, on the nature and strength of denaturant. Unfolding curves of α-LA thus can be obtained as follows: 1) from structural analysis of samples denatured by a fixed denaturing condition and quenched in a time-course manner (Fig. 9, kinetic unfolding curves) or 2) from samples that have reached equilibrium of denaturation under increasing concentrations of a selected denaturant (thermodynamic unfolding curves, see Figs. 5 and 7). These unfolding curves of α-LA, constructed from the relative recoveries of seven major scrambled isomers, display two important features about the mechanism of denaturation of α-LA. First, it demonstrates a general pathway for the unfolding of denatured α-LA-a involving progressive expansion and relaxation of the protein conformation toward the shape of a linear structure. Among the 104 possible scrambled isomers of α-LA, X-α-LA-a (beads-form isomer) and X-α-LA-d contain the smallest disulfide loops and presumably represent the most extensively unfolded structures. The yield of X-α-LA-a and X-α-LA-d are relative to the strength of the denaturing condition. This phenomenon is most evident with samples denatured with urea, GdmCl, GdmSCN, and acetonitrile. It can be measured quantitatively from thermodynamic unfolding curves presented in Figs. 5 and 7 A. As the concentration of urea increases from 3 to 8 m, the recovery of X-α-LA-a as a fraction of the total denatured protein grows from 9 to 32%. The same tendency was found with samples denatured by GdmCl and GdmSCN. Between 1 and 6m GdmSCN, the recovery of X-α-LA-d rises from 3 to 23%. α-LA is not alone in displaying this property. The predominance of beads-form isomer under strong denaturing conditions was similarly observed with the unfolding behaviors of tick anticoagulant peptide (43Chang J.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 123-128Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), insulin-like growth factor (44Chang J.-Y. Maerki W. Lai P.H. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 1463-1468Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), hirudin (45Bulychev A. Chang J.-Y. J. Prot. Chem. 1999; 18: 771-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), potato carboxypeptidase inhibitor, (46Chang J.-Y. Li L. Canals F. Aviles F.X. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14205-14211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (53Chang J.-Y. Ballatore A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For example, in the presence of 6 m GdmSCN, more than 63% of the denatured tick anticoagulant peptide and 55% of denatured BPTI were found to be the beads-form isomer. In the case of IGF-1, the content of the beads-form isomer also rises from 5 to 30% as the concentration of GdmSCN increases from 1 to 6 m. Second, it reveals the presence of a partially structured unfolding intermediate, which exhibits structural characteristics of the molten globule state of α-LA. One of the scrambled isomers, X-α-LA-c was found to contain two native disulfide bonds (Cys6–Cys120 and Cys28–Cys111) within the α-helical domain and two non-native disulfide bonds (Cys61–Cys73 and Cys77–Cys91) within the β-sheet (calcium-binding) domain (Fig. 1). The disulfide structure of X-α-LA-c implies that it is a partially unfolded α-LA with a largely intact α-helical domain and an unstructured, disordered β-sheet region. X-α-LA-c accumulates only under mild denaturing conditions. At low concentrations of GdmCl (1 m) and GdmSCN (0.2 m, see Fig. 5), X-α-LA-c constitutes ∼10% of the total denatured α-LA. However, prevalence of X-α-LA-c as an unfolding intermediate is most obvious with thermal denaturation (Fig.9) or acetonitrile as denaturant (Fig. 6). In both cases, X-α-LA-c may account for more than 40% of the denatured α-LA during the early stages of kinetic denaturation. The disulfide structure of X-α-LA-c is consistent with the properties of well characterized molten globule of α-LA. Structural elements that stabilize and characterize the structure of molten globule of α-LA have been investigated by many different laboratories (15Redfield C. Schulman B.A. Milhollen M.A. Kim P.S.

Schulman B.A. Peng Z.Y. Kim P.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 859-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). NMR analysis showed that the most persistent structure in the α-LA molten globule is localized at the helical domain. Kim and co-workers (29Schulman B.A. Kim P.S. Dobson C.M. Redfield C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 630-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) have demonstrated that the molten globule properties of α-LA are mainly confined to one of its two domains. The α-helical domain forms a helical structure with a native-like tertiary fold, whereas the β-sheet domain is essentially disordered (24Wu L.C. Peng Z.Y. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). These new findings differ somehow from the common definition of molten globule in which a fluctuated tertiary fold is believed to encompass the entire polypeptide chain (1Kuwajima K. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 6: 87-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1466) Google Scholar, 2Ptitsyn O.B. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 83-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data support the finding that the molten globule of α-LA is composed of a structured and an unstructured domain. Binding of Ca2+ is known to stabilize the conformation of α-LA (for review, see Ref. 54Permyakov E.A. Berliner L.J. FEBS Lett. 2000; 473: 269-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). Our data confirm this phenomenon. The GdmCl denaturation curves show that the stability of α-LA increases by 2-fold in the presence of 5 mmCaCl2 (Fig. 4). A similar outcome was observed when α-LA was denatured by acetonitrile in a thermodynamic fashion (Fig. 7). Binding of Ca2+ to α-LA also impedes the initial rate of its thermal denaturation by a factor of 3 (Fig. 8). Surprisingly, the binding of Ca2+ does not decelerate the kinetics of α-LA denaturation by acetonitrile (40%) (Fig. 6). Structural analysis of denatured α-LA reveals that binding of Ca2+ protects the two native disulfide bonds (Cys61–Cys77 and Cys73–Cys91) located within the β-sheet domain of α-LA. This is displayed by thermal denaturation of α-LA (Fig. 9) in which the binding of Ca2+ inhibits disulfide scrambling of Cys61–Cys77 and Cys73–Cys91 and suppresses the recovery of X-α-LA-c. However, this effect is most remarkable in the case of denaturation by acetonitrile. For example, α-LA denatured in the presence of 30% acetonitrile and CaCl2 (5 mm) comprises a single predominant scrambled isomers (X-α-LA-b) that retains two intact native disulfide bonds of the β-sheet domain (Fig.7).

https://openalex.org/W2147253857,"It is widely believed that the selectivity of voltage-dependent calcium channels is mainly controlled by amino acid residues contained within four p-loop motifs forming the pore of the channel. An examination of the amino acid sequences of high voltage-activated calcium channels reveals that their domain III S5–H5 regions contain a highly conserved motif with homology to known EF hand calcium binding proteins, hinting that this region may contribute to channel permeation. To test this hypothesis, we used site-directed mutagenesis to replace three conserved negatively charged residues in the N-type calcium channel α1Bsubunit (Glu-1321, Asp-1323, and Glu-1332) with positively charged amino acids (lysine and arginine) and studied their effect on ion selectivity using whole cell and single channel patch clamp recordings. Whereas the wild type channels conducted barium much more effectively than calcium, the mutant displayed nearly equal permeabilities for these two ions. Individual replacement of residue 1332 or a double substitution of residues 1321 and 1323 with lysine and arginine, respectively, were equally effective. Disruption of the putative EF hand motif through replacement of the central glycine residue (1326) with proline resulted in a similar effect, indicating that the responses observed with the triple mutant were not due to changes in the net charge of the channel. Overall, our data indicate that residues outside of the narrow region of the pore have the propensity to contribute to calcium channel permeation.

Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium cytomegalovirus The influx of calcium ions through voltage-gated calcium channels mediates a wide range of cellular responses, including the activation of calcium-dependent enzymes, gene transcription, muscle contraction, and the release of neurotransmitter. Under physiological conditions, calcium channels are highly selective for calcium; however, they are also capable of permeating other types of non-physiological cations such as barium and strontium (1Bourinet E.

Most types of high voltage-activated calcium channels (i.e. the L-, P/Q-, and N-types) conduct barium about 1.5- to 2-fold more effectively than calcium, whereas T-type and R-type calcium channels conduct calcium as well as, or slightly better than, barium (1Bourinet E.

Physiol. 1987; 386: 571-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The primary loci of ion selectivity in voltage-dependent calcium channels appear to reside within the p-loop motifs of each of the four transmembrane domains of the calcium channel α1 subunit (5Tang S. Mikala G. Bahinski A. Yatani A. Varadi G. Schwartz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13026-13029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Yang J. Ellinor P.T. Sather W.A. Zhang J.F. Tsien R.W.

Each of the p-loops contains a conspicuous glutamic acid residue that is conserved among all types of high voltage-activated calcium channels. Mutation of either of these residues severely impairs calcium permeation (5Tang S. Mikala G. Bahinski A. Yatani A. Varadi G. Schwartz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13026-13029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Yang J. Ellinor P.T. Sather W.A. Zhang J.F. Tsien R.W.

Physiol. 2000; 116: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and insertion of these glutamates at corresponding positions into a voltage-dependent sodium channel confers calcium selectivity (10Heinemann S.H. Terlau H. Stuhmer W. Imoto K. Numa S. Nature. 1992; 356: 441-443Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). However, the observations that R-type and other types of non-T-type calcium channels show opposing relative selectivities for barium and calcium ions cannot be easily explained by an exclusive involvement of the four glutamate residues, because they are entirely conserved in these channel subtypes. It is conceivable that the relative three-dimensional arrangement of the amino acid side chains within the four p-loops is not the same in all calcium channel subtypes and thus accounts for the different permeation profiles (11Wu X.S. Edwards H.D. Sather W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31778-31785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Alternatively, it is possible that voltage-dependent calcium channels contain an additional, yet to be identified locus that controls ion selectivity. For example, we have previously proposed that voltage-dependent calcium channels contain an extracellular calcium binding site that is linked to the activation gating machinery of the channel (12Zamponi G.W. Snutch T.P. Pflugers Arch. 1996; 431: 470-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and that may affect channel permeation. Here, we report that the domain III S5–H5 regions of all types of high voltage-activated calcium channels contain a putative EF hand motif, a central glycine residue flanked by three negatively charged residues, which is homologous to calcium binding domains of known calcium binding proteins. We show that substitution of these highly conserved negative charges with arginine/lysine or replacement of the central glycine by proline in the N-type calcium channel α1 subunit dramatically reduces the difference in barium and calcium conductance seen with the wild type channel. Thus, residues far outside the narrow region of the N-type calcium channel pore contribute in a significant manner to the permeation properties of the channel. Human embryonic kidney tsa-201 cells were maintained in a 37 °C CO2incubator in standard DMEM1supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 200 units/ml penicillin, and 0.2 mg/ml streptomycin. At 85% confluency, the cells were split with trypsin EDTA and plated on glass coverslips at 10% confluency. The cells were allowed to recover for 12 h at 37 °C. The medium was then replaced, and the cells were transiently transfected with cDNAs encoding for calcium channel α1B, β1b, and α2-δ subunits and enhanced green fluorescent protein at a 1:1:1:0.3 molar ratio, using a standard calcium phosphate protocol. After 12 h, the medium was replaced with fresh DMEM. The cells were allowed to recover for additional 12 h and subsequently stored at 28 °C in 5% CO2 for 1–2 days prior to recording. A 4.5-kilobaseSplI-AflII fragment was excised from the full-length α1B construct contained in a CMV expression vector and ligated into pSL1180. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on this construct via the Quik Change mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Successful mutagenesis and absence of undesired sequence errors was confirmed via DNA sequencing. Subsequently, the mutantSplI-AflII fragment was reintroduced into the full-length clone in CMV. Incorporation of the mutated fragment in the full-length clone was verified by restriction endonuclease digestion and DNA sequencing. Single channel recordings (cell attached) and whole cell patch clamp (ruptured) recordings were performed using an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) linked to a personal computer equipped with pClamp, Version 7.0. Patch pipettes (Sutter borosilicate glass, BF 150–86-15) were pulled using a Sutter P-87 microelectrode puller and subsequently fire polished using a Narashige microforge. For single channel recordings, pipettes were coated with sylgard and filled with solution containing 100 mm BaCl2(or CaCl2) and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 with CsOH). Pipette resistance was typically in the range of 10–20 megohms. Cells were transferred to a 3-cm culture dish containing solution comprised of 140 mm sodium gluconate, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 10 mm EGTA, and 10 mm glucose (pH 7.3 adjusted with KOH). Currents were elicited by stepping from a holding potential of −100mV (physiological) to various test depolarizations. Data were sampled at 5 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. For whole cell current recording, pipettes (in the range of 2–4 megohms) were filled with internal solution containing 108 mm cesium methanesulfonate, 4 mmMgCl2, 9 mm EGTA, 9 mm HEPES (pH 7.2 adjusted with tetraethylammonium hydroxide). The cells were transferred to a 3-cm culture dish containing recording solution comprised of 20 mm BaCl2 (or CaCl2), 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 40 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 10 mm glucose, 87.5 mm CsCl (pH 7.2 adjusted with tetraethylammonium hydroxide). Currents were elicited by stepping from a holding potential of −100 mV to various test potentials using Clampex software. Cadmium was dissolved in the external recording solution and perfused onto the cells at various concentrations using a gravity-driven perfusion system. Data were filtered at 1 kHz using a 4-pole Bessel filter and digitized at a sampling frequency of 2 kHz. Data were analyzed using Clampfit (Axon Instruments). Cadmium dose-response curves were fitted with the Hill equation. All curve fittings were carried out using Sigmaplot 4.0 (Jandel Scientific). Statistical analysis was carried out using SigmaStat 2.0 (Jandel Scientific). Differences between mean values from each experimental group were tested using a Student's ttest for two groups and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) for multiple comparisons. Differences were considered significant ifp < 0.05. Fig. 1 shows a sequence alignment of the domain III S5–H5 region of various high voltage-activated calcium channels (13Stea A. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. North R.A. Handbook of Receptors and Channels; Ligand- and Voltage-gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 113-141Google Scholar) with a common motif found in many types of calcium binding proteins, a central glycine residue flanked by three negative charges (14da Silva A.C. Reinach F.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 53-57Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). As is evident from the alignment, the central glycine residue is conserved in all types of high voltage-activated calcium channels. Furthermore, with the exception of the marine ray α1E and the human α1D channels, the three critical negatively charged residues are also conserved. This raises the possibility that certain types of high voltage-activated calcium channels may contain an EF hand calcium binding motif at a region close to the outer vestibule of the pore, which is illustrated in the proposed transmembrane topography of α1 subunit (15Catterall W.A. Cell Calcium. 1998; 24: 307-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). To determine whether this region of the channel could indeed be a major determinant of channel function, we used site-directed mutagenesis to replace the three conserved negative charges with a combination of arginine and lysine residues. As the template of choice, we used the N-type calcium channel α1B subunit, which carries glutamic acid residues in positions 1321 and 1332 and an aspartic acid residue in position 1323. Fig. 2,A and B displays macroscopic current-voltage relations of the wild type and the α1B(E1321K,D1323R,E1332R) triple mutant coexpressed in tsa-201 cells with the ancillary β1b and α2-δ subunits. Both the wild type and the mutant channel exhibited robust whole cell barium currents with similar half-activation and reversal potentials. Upon replacement of barium with calcium, both channels underwent a depolarizing shift in half-activation potential and an increase in peak current amplitude, but the latter effect was much more pronounced for the wild type channel compared with the triple mutant (see current records in Fig. 2). However, because of the calcium-induced shift in half-activation potential, absolute peak current values are not an ideal means of comparison. It is more accurate to compare the calcium-induced change in maximum slope conductance for the wild type and mutant channels. As shown in Fig. 2 C, the ability of calcium ions to decrease the whole cell conductance is greatly diminished in the triple mutant, consistent with the data shown in Fig.2, A and B. In contrast, the magnitude of the depolarizing shift in half-activation potential, which occurs when calcium is substituted for barium, was not significantly different between the wild type and the mutant channel (Fig. 2 D). Overall, these data indicate that the domain III S5–H5 region is an important determinant of the relative whole cell barium and calcium conductances. The whole cell conductance is a product of single channel conductance, the total number of channels, and the maximum open probability of each channel. Thus, the data shown in Fig. 2 do not allow a clear cut mechanistic interpretation of the results. We therefore carried out cell-attached patch single channel recordings on wild type and mutant N-type calcium channels with either 100 mm barium or 100 mm calcium as the charge carrier. Similar to that previously reported in the Xenopus oocytes expression system (1Bourinet E. Zamponi G.W. Stea A. Soong T.W. Lewis B.A. Jones L.P. Yue D.T. Snutch T.P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4983-4993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), wild type α1B (+β1b + α2-δ) channels display an ∼60% larger single channel conductance barium conductance compared with that obtained with calcium (Fig. 3, A and E). In contrast, the single channel conductance of the triple mutant channel was similar in barium and in calcium (Fig. 3, B andE). Thus, the effects observed at the whole cell level can largely be attributed to the dependence of the single channel conductance on the nature of the charge carrier. To determine the relative contributions of the negatively charged residues in the putative external EF hand motif, we created double (E1321K,D1323R) and a single (E1332R) mutant channels and examined their relative permeabilities for barium and calcium at the single channel level. As seen in Fig. 3, panels C, D, and E, either the double or the single substitution resulted in a reduction in the ratio of single channel barium to calcium conductance, with the single mutation having a slightly larger effect. Hence, a single amino acid substitution in the putative EF hand motif in the N-type calcium channel domain III S5–H5 region virtually abolishes the difference in barium and calcium permeability of the channel. The data shown in Figs. 2 and 3 involve the removal of negative surface charges near the outer mouth of the pore. Hence, it is conceivable that the observed effects of these mutations on N-type calcium channel permeation could be because of a simple change in the local surface potential near the mouth of the channel. To examine this possibility, we replaced the central glycine residue (G1326) with a proline, which should introduce a major disruption into the putative EF hand motif without changing the net charge. This mutant expressed well at the whole cell level, and showed half-activation and half-inactivation potentials that did not differ significantly from the wild type channels, indicating that the proline substitution did not affect the overall global conformation of the channel (not shown). Fig.4 A shows single channel current-voltage relations obtained from the G1326P mutant in either 100 mm barium or 100 mm calcium. As is evident from the figure, the proline substitution resulted in equal permeabilities of the N-type channel for barium and calcium ions, consistent with the hypothesis. Moreover, this effect appeared to be due to a selective increase in calcium permeability with no significant effect on barium permeation (Fig. 4 B), suggesting that the intact EF hand motif may selectively decrease calcium permeability. That the difference in calcium and barium conductance can be abolished by mutagenesis of four different residues in the putative EF hand motif suggests that this region is indeed an important factor in ion permeation of the N-type calcium channel. It has been widely accepted that the structural determinants that define the permeation characteristics of voltage-gated cation channels are localized within the four p-loop motifs of the channels (for review see Ref. 16Sather W.A. Yang J. Tsien R.W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Crystal structure data obtained from inward rectifier potassium channel clearly support a critical role of the p-loops in ion selectivity (17Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5770) Google Scholar), although the exact side chain orientation of the selectivity filter may differ between potassium and calcium channels (11Wu X.S. Edwards H.D. Sather W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31778-31785Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In calcium channels, a single glutamic acid residue within each of the four p-loop motifs has been shown to be critical for divalent cation permeation (5Tang S. Mikala G. Bahinski A. Yatani A. Varadi G. Schwartz A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13026-13029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Yang J. Ellinor P.T. Sather W.A. Zhang J.F. Tsien R.W.

It has been proposed that these glutamate residues cooperatively form two separate sites that allow a high affinity interaction between the channel and permeating ions and that electrostatic repulsion between the ions bound to those sites ultimately drives the ions across the pore (6Yang J. Ellinor P.T. Sather W.A. Zhang J.F. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1993; 366: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar, 8Ellinor P.T. Yang J. Sather W.A. Zhang J.F. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1121-1132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 18Hess P. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1984; 309: 453-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). In addition, amino acid residues near the glutamate residues in domain III appear to affect ion permeation (7Williamson A.V. Sather W.A. Biophys. J. 1999; 77: 2575-2589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, the four p-loop motifs appear to be the most essential structures involved in ion permeation. Our current data do not challenge this basic principle but rather suggest the presence of other structural determinants that modulate calcium channel permeation. The putative EF hand motif in domain III region begins 10 residues 3′ to the end of the S5 segment, and terminates 35 residues 5′ to the critical p-loop glutamate (13Stea A. Soong T.W. Snutch T.P. North R.A. Handbook of Receptors and Channels; Ligand- and Voltage-gated Ion Channels. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1995: 113-141Google Scholar), thus it seems unlikely that this region could be part of the narrow region of the channel pore. Point mutations in the putative EF hand domain did not affect the basic biophysical properties of the channels, such as channel kinetics or the voltage dependences of activation and inactivation, and in particular the G1326P mutation did not significantly affect barium conductance of the channel. Furthermore, the IC50 values for cadmium block of the triple E mutant (1.24 ± 0.1 μm,n = 5) and the G1326P mutant (1.69 ± 0.18 μm, n = 5) did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) from that obtained with the wild type channel (1.54 ± 0.17 μm, n = 5), indicating that the amino acid substitutions in the putative EF hand motif did not affect the narrow region of the pore. Overall, these considerations suggest that the mutations resulted in a localized structural disruption within the domain III S5–H5 region rather than mediating a global conformational change in the channel protein. We can also rule out an effect on the local electrostatic potential of the channel. Firstly, the proline mutation did not result in any change in net surface charge of the channel, and yet, calcium conductance was changed. Secondly, the net change in six charges occurring in the triple mutant increased the calcium conductance of the channel, which is opposite to that expected from a mechanism where the negative charges would serve to concentrate permanent divalent cations near the mouth of the pore. Furthermore, a diffuse surface charge effect should equally affect barium and calcium ions, but that was not observed. It is also unlikely that our observations are because of a purely allosteric effect of the point mutations on the pore region per se, because they selectively increased calcium conductance while leaving barium permeability relatively unaffected, and because different mutations spanning a stretch of 11 residues all had similar effects on permeation. The calcium channel α1 subunit has not yet been accessible to structural analysis via x-ray crystallography or NMR. In the absence of detailed structural information, it is difficult to unequivocally prove that the identified region serves as an EF hand calcium binding domain in the intact channel. Nonetheless, our data are consistent with a model in which the region could be allosterically linked to the permeation pathway of the channel. In this scenario, selective binding of calcium to the putative EF hand could result in a localized conformational change in the channel, ultimately resulting in a reduction in calcium conductance. Barium may either not bind to this region or may be incapable of changing channel conformation, thus lacking an antagonistic effect on permeation. Point mutations in this region would selectively remove the inhibitory effect of calcium ions, thus increasing calcium conductance to the levels observed with barium. Such a mechanism would support the observations that T-type calcium channels display approximately equal single channel conductances in barium and calcium, because T-type calcium channels lack the putative EF hand region (19Perez-Reyes E.

Pereverzev A. Klockner U. Schneider T. Perez-Reyes E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1912-1921Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, the putative EF hand motif is conserved in R-type (α1E) calcium channels, and yet calcium and barium permeate these channels equally well (1Bourinet E. Zamponi G.W. Stea A. Soong T.W. Lewis B.A. Jones L.P. Yue D.T. Snutch T.P. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 4983-4993Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, in different types of high voltage-activated calcium channels there is little sequence identity in the stretch of residues between the EF hand motif and the pore glutamate, and hence it is possible that a putative allosteric coupling between the EF hand and the pore region could be weaker or absent in α1E. Overall, our data can be explained by the involvement of a functional EF hand calcium binding region located at the extracellular side of the channel. Although detailed structural data will ultimately be required to substantiate the hypothesis, our data provide the first evidence of an involvement of non-pore residues in the permeation characteristics of voltage-dependent calcium channels."

It is difficult to evaluate the contribution of each mutation/or polymorphism to the phenotype as mutations in cis may act in concert to alter or reverse defective CFTR function and thus modify the CF phenotype (2Dork T. Wulbrand U. Richter T. Neumann T. Wolfes H. Wulf B. Maass G. Tummler B. Hum. Genet. 1991; 87: 441-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The recent discovery of severe CF associated with a ΔF508/R347H-D979A compound heterozygote genotype in two related patients suffering from pancreatic insufficiency and severe respiratory symptoms suggests that the R347H-D979A mutation has an important influence on CFTR processing and/or function (7Hojo S. Fujita J. Miyawaki H. Obayashi Y. Takahara J. Bartholomew D.W. Clin. Genet. 1998; 53: 50-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At least four CF-associated mutations have been identified in isolation at position 347 (R347C, R347H, R347L, and R347P) and two at position 979 (D979A and D979V), suggesting that Arg-347 and Asp-979 are important for CFTR structure and/or function. The mutation D979A was found in isolation in a patient with a congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (8Dörk, T., and Stuhrmann, M. (1996) Cystic Fibrosis Mutation, Data Base, http. //www.genet.sickkids.on.ca/cftr/.Google Scholar) and the R347H mutation in CF patients with pancreatic sufficiency, congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens, and no or mild pulmonary symptoms (7Hojo S. Fujita J. Miyawaki H. Obayashi Y. Takahara J. Bartholomew D.W. Clin. Genet. 1998; 53: 50-53Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As the R347H mutation is mostly associated with mild CF, it was suggested that the D979A mutation has a significant effect on CFTR function when combined in cis with R347H. Arg-347 lies within TM6 and is believed to line the pore (9Tabcharani J.A. Rommens J.M. Hou Y.X. Chang X.B. Tsui L.C. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1993; 366: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 10Cheung M. Akabas M.H. Biophys. J. 1996; 70: 2688-2695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), whereas Asp-979 is located in CL3 connecting TM8 and TM9 in the C-terminal half of CFTR. The mutations R347H and D979A replace positively charged (Arg) and negatively charged (Asp) residues with ones that are uncharged (His and Ala, respectively) at physiological pH. The present study investigates the structure-function relationships of the R347H-D979A double mutant, and as charged residues are involved in this complex genotype, single and double mutants with different charge combinations at residues 347 and 979 were constructed. All these mutants were transiently expressed in HeLa cells, and we analyzed CFTR processing by immunoprecipitation and chloride channel activity using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Our data show that R347H is associated with defective chloride channel activity and that the D979A defect leads to misprocessing. The mutant R347H-D979A combines both defects for a dramatic decrease in Cl− current. These studies also revealed that residue 979 is a critical location for both CFTR processing and Cl−channel activity. CFTR mutants were constructed in the expression plasmid pTCFwt, a vector designed for the visual detection of transfected mammalian cells by the green fluorescent protein (11Fanen P. Clain J. Labarthe R. Hulin P. Girodon E. Pagesy P. Goossens M. Edelman A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 452: 371-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), using the GeneEditor kit (Promega). HeLa cells (7.5 × 105) were grown on 60-mm diameter dishes at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 g/ml streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Inc.). Confluent cells (60%) were transfected by lipofection using 12 μl of LipofectAMINE and 8 μl of Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 2 μg of plasmid according to the manufacturer's instructions. Confluent monolayers were harvested and used 48 h post-transfection for functional assays or immunoprecipitation. The CFTR protein immunoprecipitation using the monoclonal antibody (mAb) 24–1 (R&D System), which recognizes the C terminus of CFTR, was already described (12Fanen P. Labarthe R. Garnier F. Benharouga M. Goossens M. Edelman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30563-30566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Briefly, cell lysates were mixed with 0.4 μg of mAb 24–1 and Pansorbin (Calbiochem). The resulting proteins were phosphorylated in vitro with 5 units of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Promega) and 10 μCi of [γ-33P]ATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), separated by 5% SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, dried, and autoradiographed. Radioactivity was quantitated by radioanalytic scanning (using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphoImager). Pulse-chase experiments were performed by incubating cells for 30 min in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium lacking cysteine and methionine and then for 15 min in the same medium containing 100 μCi/ml [35S]-labeled methionine and [35S]-labeled cysteine (Redivue Pro-mixTM [35S]; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). CFTR was immunoprecipitated from cell homogenates with the same mAb 24–1. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were performed at room temperature (20–25 °C) on isolated cells, 24 h after trypsinization and replating on plastic dishes at a low density. Before recording, the culture medium was replaced by the external solution to be used during the recording. This solution contained the following (in mm): 140 NaCl, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 Hepes, 10 glucose, and 25 sucrose; its final pH value was adjusted to 7.3 with NaOH. Patch-clamp micropipettes were made from hard glass (Kimax 51); their shank was covered with Sylgard, and their tip was fire-polished. They were filled with an internal solution containing the following (in mm): 30 CsCl, 113 NaCl, 10 Hepes, 1 MgCl2, and 0.5 EGTA. In some experiments the Cl− concentration of bath and pipette solutions was reduced to 32 mm by equimolar replacement with glutamate. The cells were voltage-clamped by an EPC7 List amplifier, controlled by a TANDON 38620 computer, via a Cambridge Electronic Design 1401 interface, using patch- and voltage-clamp software. The current monitor output of the amplifier was filtered at 0.5 kHz before being sampled on-line at 1 kHz, as described previously (13Fritsch J. Edelman A. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1996; 490: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The bath was connected to the ground via an agar bridge. The zero indicated on current traces and current plots is the absolute zero current level. To establish I-V curves of the response, a series of 9 voltage jumps (of 1-s duration each, separated by 10 s) of incrementing amplitude was applied from the holding potential (0 mV) toward a variable membrane potential between −80 and +80 mV. CFTR Cl− currents were activated with 200 μm8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cAMP sodium salt (CPT-cAMP). Results are expressed as the means ± S.E. of n observations. We used the Student's t test to compare mean values. Differences were considered statistically significant when the p value was <0.05. Many CF-associated mutations cause a loss of CFTR Cl− channel function because of misprocessing of the mutant protein so that it does not reach the cell membrane. We first studied the maturation of CFTR in HeLa cells to determine why patients with the R347H-D979A-CFTR allele suffered from severe CF. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with cDNA encoding the wild-type and mutated CFTR proteins. The processing of CFTR can be assessed by examining its glycosylation. In our experimental conditions, electrophoresis of immunoprecipitated wild-type CFTR gave two bands (Fig. 1 A). One was a diffuse band of an approximate molecular mass of 170 kDa (band C) that represented mature, fully glycosylated protein that has migrated through the Golgi complex to the cell membrane. The second was a thin band of about 140 kDa (band B) that represented the core-glycosylated protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum. Immunoprecipitation experiments show that both wild-type and CF-associated mutants R347H, D979A, and R347H-D979A-CFTR cells produced mature, fully glycosylated protein (Fig. 1 A; band C), whereas none of the mock-transfected cells produced CFTR (data not shown). However, the D979A and R347H-D979A mutants produced significantly less band C (59 and 56% of the total CFTR; ratio C/(B+C)) than wild-type and R347H-CFTR (92 and 91%; see Fig.1 B). This indicates that the R347H-D979A mutation caused a misprocessing defect. The turnover of immature and mature forms of wild-type and R347H-D979A-CFTR proteins was further investigated by pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 1 C). The kinetics of wild-type and R347H-D979A core-glycosylated and mature forms of CFTR were identical, whereas the efficiency of conversion to mature band C was lower for the mutant. Similar results were obtained with the D979A mutant (data not shown). This indicates a defect in the biosynthetic pathway, which accounts for the decreased amount of band C observed in the steady-state measurements. Other mutants were generated to further characterize the D979A defect. Asp-979 was changed to Val (small hydrophobic residue; D979V), Arg (positively charged residue; D979R), or Glu (negatively charged residue; D979E). D979V (also a naturally occurring mutant) and D979R had impaired processing similar to D979A, whereas D979E permitted the complete maturation of the protein (Fig. 1 B). Altogether, these results indicate that D979A is responsible for the defective processing of R347H-D979A-CFTR and that a negative charge at 979 residue is necessary for proper CFTR processing. We tested the cAMP-activated chloride channel activity of transfected HeLa cells using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. None of the mock-transfected cells displayed a Cl− current in either basal or cAMP-stimulated conditions (data not shown). By using 140 mm Cl− (symmetrically) and 200 μm cAMP agonist, cells expressing wild-type CFTR produced saturating whole-cell currents for clamp potentials above/below ± 40 mV. We therefore reduced Cl− (32 mmsymmetrically by replacement with glutamate) and cAMP agonist (50 μm) to characterize wild-type CFTR current. As shown in Fig. 2 A, there was little or no current under basal conditions, and application of CPT-cAMP activated large currents that reversed at the Cl−equilibrium potential (close to 0 mV with the solutions used). The currents were glibenclamide-sensitive and DIDS- and TS-TM-calix[4]arene-insensitive as expected for CFTR Cl− current (data not shown). These currents were activated a few seconds after stimulation and were slowly reversible after washout of CPT-cAMP. The current-voltage relationship exhibited a slight outward rectification (Fig. 2 B), as described when internal Cl− were replaced by large impermeant anions (14Linsdell P. Hanrahan J.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: C628-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We separated the contributions of the R347H and D979A mutations to R347H-D979A-CFTR whole-cell Cl− current production studying both single and double mutants. To maximize our ability to detect differences between mutants and to compare mutants with wild-type CFTR, we used 140 mm Cl− and 200 μm cAMP agonist, and data were analyzed at 20 mV. Current-voltage relationships of naturally occurring mutants are shown in Fig. 2 C. Mean changes in cAMP-activated currents recorded at 20 mV from R347H (29.4 ± 12.2 pA/pF; n = 8), D979A (67.9 ± 18.9 pA/pF; n = 5), and R347H-D979A (1.2 ± 0.8 pA/pF; n = 9) mutants were significantly different (p < 0.05) from wild-type (130.2 ± 34.7 pA/pF; n = 5), corresponding to 23, 52, and 1% of the wild-type Cl− current (Fig.2 D). R347H, D979A, and R347H-D979A were also significantly different from each other (p < 0.01). As R347H processing is similar to wild-type, the small Cl−current produced by R347H reflected defective channel properties, as demonstrated by single-channel studies (9Tabcharani J.A. Rommens J.M. Hou Y.X. Chang X.B. Tsui L.C. Riordan J.R. Hanrahan J.W. Nature. 1993; 366: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). The decreased whole-cell Cl− cAMP-dependent current observed with D979A probably reflected CFTR protein misprocessing, although we cannot firmly exclude altered channel properties. Thus these data indicate that the R347H-D979A double mutant combined at least D979A misprocessing and the R347H Cl− channel defect to produce a very severe phenotype. Taking into account the functional defects that result when Arg-347 and Asp-979 are each replaced with an uncharged amino acid such as His (uncharged at pH 7.3) and Ala (R347H and D979A), we constructed additional mutants with different charge combinations at residues 347 and 979, including the R347D-D979R double mutant in which the positive and negative charges were swapped. The processing of R347D was similar to those of R347H and the wild-type (Fig. 3, open bars). Thus, Arg-347 is not critical for processing, as the replacement of Arg by His or Asp permitted complete maturation of the protein. Surprisingly, the processing of D979R, R347H-D979R, and R347D-D979R was differently impaired (Fig. 3; gray bars). These data indicate that when residue 979 is positively charged, different CFTR processing efficiency occurred depending on the charge at residue 347. This suggests that 347 residue could interact directly or indirectly with Arg-979 (D979R). Whole-cell measurements indicated that D979R resulted in a much greater decrease in chloride current (4.5 ± 2.4 pA/pF; n= 6) than D979A (Fig. 2 D), although both proteins were processed similarly. These data suggest that residue 979 is also important for the chloride channel activity in transfected HeLa cells and that the requirements for channel processing and function are different. The Cl− current of R347D-D979R (2.8 ± 1.7 pA/pF; n = 9) was not significantly different from those of D979R and R347H-D979A (Fig. 2 D). This result is consistent with the poor amount of R347D-D979R protein at the cell surface. Complex alleles have been described clinically (R553Q-ΔF508, ΔF508-V1212I, and R334W-R1158X), and most of them are considered to reverse the phenotype, as they are associated with milder symptoms than the most common mutation in isolation. However, as these complex alleles are very rare, and epistatic or environmental factors may contribute to the CF phenotype, in vitro studies are of value to confirm the genotype-phenotype relationships and to understand the functional defects causing the disease. Clinical data suggested that R347H and D979A, two mild CF-associated mutations, can produce severe CF similar to that of ΔF508 homozygotes when combined in cis. We have determined the contribution of each mutant to the double-mutant phenotype. D979A reduces the amount of CFTR protein at the cell membrane, whereas R347H generates a defective Cl− channel. The mutant R347H-D979A combines both defects for a dramatic decrease in Cl−current. The magnitude of Cl− current in vitroparalleled the severity of the disease, with D979A (congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens) > R347H (mild CF) > R347H-D979A (severe CF). Manavalan et al. (15Manavalan P. Smith A.E. McPherson J.M. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) observed significant amino acid homology and length conservation in the CL regions between CFTR and other transporter proteins. It was then suggested that CLs may be important for channel function and/or the folding and processing of the CFTR protein, and extensive studies of CF-associated mutations in the four CLs have revealed channel properties and/or processing defects (16Xie J.

Our data strongly suggest that mutation D979R alters the properties of the chloride channel, and mutational analysis of 979 residue also confirmed that the requirements for channel processing and function are different, consistent with data for other residues (17Cotten J.F.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11966-11974Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), suggesting that the correct folding of CLs is important for proper maturation of the whole molecule. Our data support this view, as replacing Asp-979 by Ala, Val, or Arg significantly impaired processing. Based on mutational analysis of 970 residue, Seibertet al. (18Seibert F.S. Linsdell P. Loo T.W.

Chem. 1996; 271: 27493-27499Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) proposed that the “influence on folding may depend more on the location of the altered residue than the specific residue change.” We observed that the negatively charged Asp-979 could be replaced only by the negatively charged Glu-979 without affecting processing, indicating that a negative charge is important at that location. Moreover, Asp-979 is highly conserved throughout CFTR evolution (22Diamond G. Scanlin T.F. Zasloff M.A. Bevins C.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22761-22769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Tucker S.J. Tannahill D. Higgins C.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1992; 1: 77-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and belongs to a consensus sequence shared with other ABC transporters (15Manavalan P. Smith A.E. McPherson J.M. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). These observations all indicate a crucial role for Asp-979 and thus raised the following question: how might removal of the negative charge at position 979 affect CFTR processing? Little is known about how the CLs contribute to CFTR processing. Considering the highly hydrophilic composition and length of CFTR CLs (53–61 residues) (15Manavalan P. Smith A.E. McPherson J.M. J. Protein Chem. 1993; 12: 279-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), they could take part in physical interactions with other cytoplasmic domains of CFTR, solvent-accessible TM residues, or cytoplasmic proteins. First, several lines of experimental evidence indicate that there is probably no direct salt bridge between Arg-347 and Asp-979: (i) removal of either the positive charge at position 347 (R347H and R347D) or the negative charge at position 979 (D979A, D979V, and D979R) has different effects on CFTR processing; (ii) the double-neutral (R347H-D979A) and reversed-charged (R347D-D979R) replacements for Arg-347 and Asp-979 do not lead to the recovery of wild-type processing. Second, Asp-979 might interact with an as yet unidentified positively charged residue located either in a cytoplasmic part of CFTR or in a solvent-accessible part of a TM domain, stabilizing CL3 at a distance from residue 347. Removal of the negative charge at position 979 would disrupt this interaction and could direct CL3 to residue 347 and thus allow a charge-dependent interaction with residue 347. This is supported by the decrease in the processing efficiency of D979R mutants combined with positive, neutral, and negative charges at residue 347. Furthermore, a single charge can form salt bridges with several opposite charges. Given the highly hydrophilic nature of CLs, multiple ion pairs could maintain a conformation of the CLs favorable to proper maturation of the protein, which is supported by the multiple charge-disruption mutations in CLs affecting CFTR processing (17Cotten J.F.

However, interactions between charges exposed on the protein surface may do little to stabilize proteins, unlike buried ion pairs (24Yang A.S. Honig B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 40-45Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Rather than being engaged in intramolecular interactions, Asp-979 might interact with cytoplasmic proteins. Several proteins have recently been shown to interact directly with CFTR cytoplasmic domains (25Naren A.P. Nelson D.J. Xie W. Jovov B. Pevsner J. Bennett M.K. Benos D.J. Quick M.W. Kirk K.L.

In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of structure-function analysis of naturally occurring mutants for deciphering complex genotype and identifying residues important for CFTR processing and/or chloride channel activity. These results also have important implications for CF, as they show that two mutationsin cis can act in concert to alter dramatically CFTR function. This may contribute to the wide phenotypic variability of CF disease and points to the need to screen for all mutations.

Neither glycoconjugate nor free thiol group was detected in the protein. The primary structure deduced from the corresponding cDNA was confirmed using amino acid sequence determination, which supported the finding that SVS VII consists of 76 amino acid residues with five disulfide bridges. Accordingly, it has a theoretical molecular mass of 8538, which was proven using the mass spectrum of SVS VII. The CD spectrum of SVS VII in 50 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 appeared as one negative band arising from the β form at 217 nm and several fine structures due to nonpeptide chromophores including a prominent band for the disulfide bond at 250 nm. This, together with the predicted secondary structures, indicated no helices but a mixture of β form, β turn, and unordered form in SVS VII. A cytochemical study illustrated the presence of the SVS VII-binding region on the entire surface of mouse sperm. The SVS VII-sperm binding was inhibited by the dispersed sperm lipids. The results of TLC overlay assay for the binding of 125I-SVS VII to phospholipids and the interaction between SVS VII and phospholipid liposomes demonstrated a specific binding of this protein to both phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine. The SVS VII-sperm binding greatly enhanced sperm motility but did not induce sperm capacitation.

The CD spectrum of SVS VII in 50 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 appeared as one negative band arising from the β form at 217 nm and several fine structures due to nonpeptide chromophores including a prominent band for the disulfide bond at 250 nm. This, together with the predicted secondary structures, indicated no helices but a mixture of β form, β turn, and unordered form in SVS VII. A cytochemical study illustrated the presence of the SVS VII-binding region on the entire surface of mouse sperm. The SVS VII-sperm binding was inhibited by the dispersed sperm lipids. The results of TLC overlay assay for the binding of 125I-SVS VII to phospholipids and the interaction between SVS VII and phospholipid liposomes demonstrated a specific binding of this protein to both phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine. The SVS VII-sperm binding greatly enhanced sperm motility but did not induce sperm capacitation. Heating the protein solution for 10 min at 90 °C unfolded the protein molecule, and the unfolded SVS VII immobilized the sperm.AF134204 seminal vesicle secretion bovine serum albumin bovine seminal plasma polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine phosphatidylserine phosphatidylinositol seminal vesicle autoantigen phosphate-buffered saline The fertilization capabilities of spermatozoa are not permanent but rather transient (1Barros C. Rev. Microsc. Electron. 1977; 4: 107-113Google Scholar). It is well known that mammalian sperm display an intriguing sense of timing to undergo some modification during their transit in the reproductive tract before encountering an egg. This involves multiple steps, and their molecular mechanisms are far from understood. Identifying the molecular event(s) associated with the cell modifications becomes a prerequisite to unravel the puzzle. In this regard, studying how the materials in the lumen of the reproductive tract affect sperm function is an important subject. Seminal plasma of mammals is a complex biological fluid formed from the mixing of various fluids in the male reproduction tract. Factors that affect sperm motility have been reported in the seminal plasma of various mammals including boar (2Nichol R. Hunter R.H. de Lamirande E. Gagnon C. Cooke G.M. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1997; 110: 79-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 3Iwamoto T. Tsang A. Luterman M. Dickson J. de Lamirande E. Okuno M. Mohri H. Gagnon C. Mol. Reprod.

Biol. Reprod. 1996; 55: 813-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The fluid secreted from the seminal vesicle, an accessory reproductive gland in most male mammals, accumulates in the lumen of this reproductive gland after puberty. Upon ejaculation, seminal vesicle secretion (SVS)1 is discharged to constitute the major portion of seminal plasma. It was found that extirpation of the seminal vesicle from a mouse greatly reduced fertility (8Pang S.F. Chow P.H. Wong T.M. J. Reprod. Fertil. 1979; 56: 129-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 9Peitz B. Olds-Clarke P. Biol. Reprod. 1986; 35: 608-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), thus manifesting the importance of SVS in the sperm modification. Since rodents have proven to be good experimental animals for the molecular study of mammalian reproduction, attempts have been made to isolate the proteins involved in the cell modification from mouse SVS that contains several minor proteins and seven well defined major proteins designated SVS I–VII in decreasing order of molecular size according to their motilities in SDS-PAGE (10Chen Y.H. Pentecost B.T. McLachlan J.A. Teng C.T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1987; 1: 707-716Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recently, we demonstrated two of the minor proteins, a caltrin-like trypsin inhibitor/P12, which suppressed the Ca2+-uptake of sperm (11Chen L.Y. Lin Y.H. Lai M.L. Chen Y.H. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 1498-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and a seminal vesicle autoantigen, which served as a decapacitation factor (12Huang Y.H. Chu S.T. Chen Y.H. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 13Huang Y.H. Chu S.T. Chen Y.H. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 63: 1572-1576Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Here we present the protein structure, cDNA cloning, and function of SVS VII purified from mouse SVS. Bovine pancreatic chymotrypsin (type II) and trypsin (type III); chlortetracycline; phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho), lysophosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) from egg yolks; phosphatidic acid and lysophosphatidic acid from egg yolk lectin; phosphatidylinositol from pig livers, phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), and sphingomyelin from bovine brains; and fatty acid-free BSA were purchased from Sigma. Goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG, Percoll, and Sephadex G-50 (superfine) were procured from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. C4 300A column was from Waters Co. (Bedford, MA). The BCA protein assay reagent and IODO-BEADs were obtained from Pierce. The Ultraspec-II RNA isolation kit was purchased from Biotecx (Houston, TX). The Oligotex mRNA minikit was from Qiagen GmbH (Hilden, Germany). The cloning systems including the cDNA synthesis kit, ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit, and ZAP-cDNA gigapack III cloning kit were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). pGEM-T, Taq polymerase, T4 DNA ligase, the Prime-a-gene labeling system, and restriction enzymes were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Freund's adjuvants were from Life Technologies, Inc. Aluminum-backed silica gel TLC plates and GF/C glass microfiber were from Whatman. Outbred CD-1 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) and were maintained and bred in the animal center at the College of Medicine, National Taiwan University. Animals were treated according to the institutional guidelines for the care and use of experimental animals. They were housed under controlled lighting (14 h of light, 10 h of dark) at 21–22 °C and were provided with water and NIH 31 laboratory mouse chow ad libitum. Adult mice (8–12 weeks) were humanely killed by cervical dislocation. The seminal vesicles were carefully dissected to free them from the adjacent coagulating glands, and the secretions collected from 50 mice were expressed directly into 50 ml of ice-cold 5% acetic acid. After stirring for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was collected and fractionated initially by 35% saturation of ammonium sulfate precipitation at pH 2.0. The precipitate was removed using centrifugation at 8000 × g for 20 min, and the supernatant was dialyzed against 0.5% acetic acid and lyophilized. The dry sample was redissolved in a minimum volume of PBS and loaded onto a Sephadex G-50 column (1.5 × 120 cm) preequilibrated with PBS. The column was washed with PBS at a flow rate of 6 ml/h. Fractions (2 ml) were collected, and their absorbance at 280 nm was recorded (see Fig.1 A). The peak III fractions were resolved further using HPLC on a Waters C4 300 A column (3.9 × 300 mm, 15μ). The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 15–60% acetonitrile in 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min for 40 min (see Fig.1 B). SVS VII was identified in peak 2 using SDS-PAGE. In accordance with a method previously used (14Bellv'e A.R. Zheng W. Martinova Y.S. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 84-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar), a modified Tyrode's buffer, which consisted of 124.7 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm NaH2PO4, 5.6 mmglucose, 0.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 15 mmNaHCO3, 10 mm HEPES, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin, was adjusted to pH 7.3–7.4 by aeration with humidified air/CO2 (19:1) in an incubator for 48 h at 37 °C before use. The epididymides were removed and immersed in the medium. After they had been carefully dissected from the connective tissue, spermatozoa were extruded from the distal portion of the tissues for 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were gently filtered through two layers of nylon gauze, layered on top of a linear gradient of 20–80% Percoll (v/v), and centrifuged at 275 × g for 30 min at room temperature (15Ruiz-Romero J. Antich M. Bassas L. Andrologia. 1995; 27: 149-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 16Miyake M. Coney P. Iritani A. Kling O.R. Gamete Res. 1989; 24: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Three distinct cell layers formed. The lowest layer, which contained cells with progressive motility, was washed in three volumes of the medium and collected using centrifugation at 60 × g for 10 min at room temperature. The sperm were resuspended and centrifuged similarly twice more. The cell pellets were resuspended, and CaCl2 was added to the culture medium at a final concentration of 1.8 mm before the sperm was assayed. Antisera against SVS VII were raised in New Zealand White rabbits. Proteins were resolved using SDS-PAGE on a 15% gel slab (6.5 × 10.5 × 0.075 cm) by the method of Laemmli (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar). The proteins on the gel were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After transfer, the protein blots were immunodetected using Western blot procedures; the SVS VII-induced antisera was the primary antibody, and goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was the secondary antibody. The proteolysis of protein bands in the polyacrylamide gel was carried out following the method of Hanspal et al. (18Hanspal J.S. Bushell G.R. Ghosh P. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 123: 288-293Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar). After resolution of proteins using SDS-electrophoresis on a gel slab of 15% polyacrylamide copolymerized with 0.1% gelatin, the gel was gently washed three times in 100 ml of 2.5% (w/v) Triton X-100 for 45 min each to remove SDS. The gel was washed in distilled water for 45 min and incubated for 15 h at 37 °C in a solution containing chymotrypsin (1 N-benzoyl-l-tyrosine ethyl ester unit/ml) or trypsin (50N-benzoyl-l-arginine ethyl ester units/ml) in 0.1 m Tris-HCl and 20 mmCaCl2 at pH 8.0. The gel was washed similarly as above and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The total lipids of spermatozoa were extracted using a modified method of Folch et al. (19Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were suspended in 1.0 ml of 0.05 m KCl, sonicated in a Branson ultrasonic water bath (model B-52) for 5 min at room temperature, and extracted twice with 3.0 ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). The lipid extract was dried by flushing with N2 and redissolved in a suitable organic solvent for TLC. Meanwhile, the sperm lipid was dissolved in ethanol and injected through a 26-gauge needle into PBS (ethanol/PBS, 1:20, v/v). The suspension was repeatedly forced through the needle, sonicated for 1 h at room temperature, centrifuged at 18,000 × g, and used immediately in the study of the inhibitory effects on SVS VII-sperm binding. The pure phospholipids in the chloroform solution were evaporated under N2 and formed thin films in glass tubes. Liposomes of phospholipids were prepared following the method of Genge et al. (20Genge B.R. Wu L.N. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 10917-10921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A sufficient volume of incubation buffer composed of 10 mm HEPES and 100 mm KCl at pH 7.4 was added to give a final concentration of 2 mg of lipid/ml. The mixture was sonicated at full power for 10 min until the lipids formed a faintly opalescent suspension. A modified method developed by Markwell (21Markwell M.A. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 125: 427-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar) was followed to prepare 125I-SVS VII. In brief, 10 μl of Na125I (1.0 mCi) from a commercial source was mixed with 50 μg of SVS VII in 90 μl of PBS in the presence of IODO-BEADs. The radiolabeled protein was separated from free Na125I through a PD-10 column preequilibrated with PBS. 125I-SVS VII showed a single band and was indistinguishable from its parent protein by migration on SDS-PAGE. Spermatozoa (2.5 × 106 cells/ml) and 100 nm125I-SVS VII in 10 mm HEPES containing 138 mm NaCl and 3 mm KCl at pH 7.4 were incubated at specified conditions. The cells were collected on a Whatman GF/C glass microfiber filter using rapid filtration at a pressure of 50.66 kilopascals (0.5 atm). In accordance with the method described previously (11Chen L.Y. Lin Y.H. Lai M.L. Chen Y.H. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 1498-1505Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 22Thaler C.D. Cardullo R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23289-23297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the filter was blocked with 5% (v/v) nonfat skimmed milk in the buffer for 30 min and washed with the same ice-cold buffer before use to minimize the background. The filter was washed with six changes of 0.2 ml of the same ice-cold buffer, air-dried, and counted using a γ-counter. Sperm lipids and purified lipids were chromatographed on aluminum-backed silica gel TLC plates in chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4, v/v/v). The plates were treated according to the method developed by Desnoyers and Manjunath (23Desnoyers L. Manjunath P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10149-10155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plates were overlaid with 125I-SVS VII (100,000 cpm/ml) in a blocking buffer of PBS containing 5% nonfat skimmed milk (100 μl/cm2), incubated for 90 min at room temperature, washed five times each for 1–2 min with cold PBS, and then dried and exposed to x-ray film for 18–36 h. The lipids on duplicate plates were sprayed with phosphomolybdic acid solution to allow us to detect phospholipids (24Usui T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1963; 54: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). According to a modified method by Glenney (25Glenney J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 7247-7252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 10 μg of protein and 200 μg of liposomes in 200 μl of incubation buffer were gently mixed with or without 1.8 mm CaCl2 for 45 min at room temperature. Liposomes became sediment at 100,000 ×g for 30 min, and equivalent fractions of pellet and supernant were analyzed using SDS-PAGE. The chlortetracycline staining method developed by Ward and Storey (26Ward C.R. Storey B.T. Dev. Biol. 1984; 104: 287-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) was employed to score the population of mouse spermatozoa in the uncapacitated, capacitated, and acrosome-reacted stages. Briefly, a 5-μl sample of the sperm suspension was mixed on a slide with 5 μl of buffer containing 130 mm NaCl, 5 mmcysteine, 1 mm chlortetracycline, and 20 mmTris-HCl at pH 7.8. After 30 s, 1.0 μl of buffer containing 1.25% glutaraldehyde, 130 mm NaCl, 1.8 mmCaCl2, and 20 mm Tris-HCl at pH 7.8 was added. The samples were kept in a light-shielded environment until they were seen under a fluorescence microscope (AH3-RFCA; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Freshly prepared spermatozoa (106 cells/ml) were preincubated in a blocking solution (3% nonfat skimmed milk in PBS) for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were further incubated with 25 μm SVS VII for another 30 min. At the end of incubation, the cells were centrifuged, and the cell pellets were washed with PBS to remove the unbound ligands. The cells were air-dried on a glass slide and washed twice with PBS. The slides were incubated with the SVS VII-induced antiserum diluted 1:250 in the blocking solution for 30 min. The slides were washed three times with PBS to remove excess antibodies before they were incubated with fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG diluted to 1:100 in the blocking solution for 30 min. All of the slides were washed with PBS, covered with 50% (v/v) glycerol in PBS, and photographed with a microscope equipped with epifluorescence. Sperm motility was determined using computer-assisted sperm assays with a sperm motility analyzer (IVOS version 10; Hamilton-Thorne Research, Beverly, MA). A 7.0-μl sample was placed in a 10-μm-deep Makler chamber at 37 °C. The analyzer was set as follows: negative phase-contrast optics and recording at 60 frames/s, minimum contrast 40, minimum cell size 4 pixels, low size gate 0.2, high size gate 1.5, low intensity gate 0.5, high intensity gate 1.5, nonmotile head size 29, nonmotile head intensity 76, medium average path velocity 50 μm/s, low path velocity 7.0 μm/s, slow motile cells yes, and threshold straightness (STR) greater than 80%. Ten fields were assessed for each sample. The concentration of SVS VII was determined using the BCA protein assay (27Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18635) Google Scholar) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The amino acid sequence was determined using automated Edman degradation with a gas phase sequenator (492 protein sequencer with on line 140 C analyzer, (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). DNA sequencing was carried out by an ABI PRISM 377-96 DNA sequencer using the ABI PRISM BigDye Terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The CD spectra were measured with a Jasco J-700 spectropolarimeter under constant flushing with N2 at room temperature. The mean residue elipticity, [θ], was estimated from the mean residue weight, which was calculated from the primary structure. SVS VII dissolved in 50% acetonitrile containing 1% acetic acid at a final concentration of 10 μm was analyzed in the ESI source of a Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT Instruments Inc., San Jose, CA). Data were acquired using Bioworks software. Total cellular RNA was prepared from fresh tissue homogenates, using the Ultraspec-II RNA isolation kit. The polyadenylated fraction of total RNA was isolated using the procedures recommended for the Oligotex mRNA minikit. Preparation of double-stranded cDNAs, construction of orientation-specific cDNAs in Uni-ZAP XR vectors with theEcoRI/XhoI terminus, and packaging of the constructed vectors into phages generally followed the instructions of Stratagene. The recombinant phages were transfected into the bacterial host XL1-Blue MRF′ strain. The cDNA library efficiency was 2.5 × 105 plaque-forming units/μg of cDNA. Plaques from the cDNA library in the vectors were induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and immunochemically screened using the antiserum against SVS VII. Randomly chosen positives from different pools were purified. They were excised into phagemids using ExAssist interference-resistant helper phages and transformed into bacterial SOLRTM strain for DNA sequencing. In Northern blotting, total RNA samples were analyzed by separation in a denaturing 1.5% agarose/formaldehyde gel (28Lehrach H. Diamond D. Wozney J.M. Boedtker H. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 4743-4751Crossref PubMed Scopus (2402) Google Scholar) followed by capillary transfer to a nylon membrane and hybridization to a32P-labeled nucleotide probe. 32P-labeled random-primed probe for the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene was prepared with a Promega Prime-a-gene labeling kit using a cDNA segment of the mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene inserted into a pGEM-T vector as a template. According to the method developed by Lee et al. (29Lee C.C. Wu X.W. Gibbs R.A. Cook R.G. Muzny D.M. Caskey C.T. Science. 1988; 239: 1288-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar), incorporation of [α-32P]dATP to DNA was carried out using PCR, which was designed to amplify the whole reading frame of SVS VII cDNA in the constructed vector. SVS VII was purified from SVS through a series of isolation steps. The peak 2 sample in Fig.1 B shows that a single 8-kDa band has the same mobility as SVS VII on SDS-PAGE (cf. lanes 1 and 2 in Fig.2), which indicates that the protein was purified to homogeneity and was distinct from the peak 1 sample, which gave a single 6-kDa band that corresponds with P12 reported previously (30Lai M.L. Chen S.W. Chen Y.H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 265-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The antiserum against SVS VII showed high immunoaffinity to the antigen (Fig. 2, lane 4). Among the protein components of mouse SVS, the antiserum only immunoreacted with SVS VII (Fig. 2, lane 3), thus showing the high specificity of the SVS VII antibody in the antiserum. Therefore, we used the antiserum for the immunodetection of SVS VII throughout the study. The recombinant phages of the cDNA library were screened using the antiserum against SVS VII, and the positives were excised into phagemids. The SVS VII cDNA in the phagemid was sequenced to establish the gene structure that included a 5′-untranslated region of 5 base pairs, an open reading frame of 297 base pairs, which encoded 99 amino acid residues, and a 3′-untranslated region of 183 base pairs, which ended with a polyadenylated region (Fig.3 A). Automated Edman degradation of SVS VII for 18 cycles gave reliable data, which indicated Leu as the N-terminal residue and the amino acid sequence, LICNSCEKSRDSRCTMSQ, which was identical with the corresponding cDNA-deduced peptide sequence in all positions. Apparently, the post-translational cleavage occurred at the Gly-Leu peptide bond in the signal peptide that had 23 amino acid residues to produce a mature protein of 76 amino acid residues containing 10 cysteines. We found that SVS VII was not reactive to Ellman's reagent (31Ellman G.L. Courtney K.D. Valentino A.J. Featherstone R.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1961; 7: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (21475) Google Scholar), indicative of the absence of a free thiol group on the protein molecule. The protein also did not react with Ellman's reagent when the experiment was performed in the presence of 6.0 m urea. Apparently, there were no free cysteines that were partially or fully buried in the protein molecules. In addition, the SVS VII band in the polyacrylamide gel did not stain with periodic acid-Shiff reagent, which revealed that it was not a glycoprotein. Accordingly, the theoretical molecular mass was estimated to be 8538 from the cDNA-deduced protein sequence. This was proven in the electrospray mass spectral profile of SVS VII (Fig.4). The CD spectrum of SVS VII in 50 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 had at least seven bands in the wavelength region of 200–300 nm. Bands I–VI in the near-UV region arose from nonpeptide chromophores (Fig. 5, right side), and band VII in the UV region was mainly due to peptide chromophores (Fig. 5, left side). Band VII was negative with a minimum at 217 nm. In addition, a positive band would appear as the CD profile extended below 200 nm. The spectral profile had some resemblance to that of the β form of protein conformation (32Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Martinez H.M. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4120-4131Crossref PubMed Scopus (1906) Google Scholar, 33Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1964) Google Scholar, 34Chiang C.T. Wu C.S. Yang J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 35Perczel A. Park K. Fasman G.D. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 203: 83-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Using the criteria of the Chou and Fasman algorithm (36Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 222-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (2543) Google Scholar, 37Chou P.Y. Fasman G.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1978; 47: 251-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (2337) Google Scholar) or the GOR algorithm (38Garneir J. Osguthorpe D.J. Robson B. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 120: 97-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (3417) Google Scholar), we predicted the potentials for the formation of secondary structures in SVS VII (Fig.3 B). The helical formation by weak helix formers along the two peptide segments of residues 51–56 and 60–70 was overpredicted in view of our CD results. The predicted secondary structure, together with the position, sign and magnitude of band VII of SVS VII (Fig. 5), strongly supported the presence of some ordered structure other than the helix, probably a mixture of β-form, β-turn, and unordered form in the SVS VII molecule. There were two tyrosines, two phenylalanines, and five cystines but no tryptophan in the SVS VII molecule. According to the fine CD structures of nonpeptide chromophores of a protein near UV (39Chen Y.H. Tai J.C. Huang W.J. Lai M.Z. Hung M.C. Lai M.D. Yang J.T. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 2592-2600Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 40Beychok S. Breslow E. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 151-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), bands I–III arose from tyrosine residue(s), and band V, which appeared as a shoulder between the positive band VI and the negative band IV, may be attributable to phenylalanine residues, since the CD spectrum of this amino acid in a protein is usually weak. Band VI was the most prominent band among the CD fine structures of SVS VII. Based on the study of Beychok and Breslow (40Beychok S. Breslow E. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 151-154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), bands VI and IV were assigned to cystine residue(s). The description of bands I–VI to specific residues may be fortuitous. The CD data from site-specific mutagenesis for the protein may support the assignment in the future. The secondary structure of SVS VII was stable over a wide range of pH values. Even at pH 3 or 10, the profiles of CD band VII as well as the CD fine structures in the near-UV region remained virtually the same as in neutral solution (not shown). After heating the protein solution for 10 min at 90 °C, the protein conformation changed remarkably as evidenced by the disappearance of CD bands VI and VII of native protein and the appearance of a strong negative band below 200 nm (cf. solid and dashed linesof Fig. 5), which was the characteristic CD of a protein in a completely unordered form. The protein sample after heat treatment is referred to as SVS VIIh hereafter. The mouse SVS proteins resolved in a slab gel of polyacrylamide copolymerized with gelatin were digested with protease. The protein band of SVS VII remained in the gel after either the chymotrypsin- or trypsin-mediated proteolysis. According to previous methods (41DelMar E.G. Largman C. Brodrick J.W. Geokas M.C. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 99: 316-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar, 42Lottenberg R. Christensen U. Jackson C.M. Coleman P.L. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 341-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), we measured no inhibitory effects of SVS VII on the proteolytic activity of either chymotrypsin or trypsin (data not shown), suggesting that the cross-linkages of five disulfide bridges constrained this rather small protein molecule to hamper the proteolytic digestion or/and the release of peptide segment(s) that remained in the protein core after proteolytic degradation.

No fluorescence appeared on the epididymal spermatozoa after they immunoreacted successively with the SVS VII antiserum and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, manifesting the lack of SVS VII on the cell surface.

https://openalex.org/W1975078013,"Well-characterized pectin samples with a wide range of degrees of esterification (39–74%) were incubated with the solubilized pure α and γ isoforms of pectinmethylesterase, from mung bean hypocotyl (<i>Vigna radiata</i>). Enzyme activity was determined at regular intervals along the deesterification pathway at pH 5.6 and pH 7.6. It has been demonstrated that the distribution of the carboxyl units along the pectin backbone controls the activity of the cell wall pectinmethylesterases to a much greater extent than the methylation degree, with a random distribution leading to the strongest activity. Polygalacturonic acid was shown to be a competitive inhibitor of the α isoform activity at pH 5.6 and to inhibit the γ isoform activity at both pH 5.6 and pH 7.6. Under these conditions, the drop in enzyme activity was shown to be correlated to the formation of deesterified blocks of 19 ± 1 galacturonic acid residues through simulations of the enzymatic digestion according to the mechanisms established previously (Catoire, L., Pierron, M., Morvan, C., Herve du Penhoat, C., and Goldberg, R. (1998) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i>273, 33150–33156). However, even in the absence of inhibition by the reaction product, activity dropped to negligible levels long before the substrate had been totally deesterified. Comparison of α and γ isoform cDNAs suggests that the N-terminal region of catalytic domains might explain their subtle differences in activity revealed in this study. The role of pectinmethylesterase in the cell wall stiffening process along the growth gradient is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2110219642,"The structure of the tryptophan synthase α-subunit from Pyrococcus furiosus was determined by x-ray analysis at 2.0-Å resolution, and its stability was examined by differential scanning calorimetry. Although the structure of the tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex fromSalmonella typhimurium has been already determined, this is the first report of the structure of the α-subunit alone. The α-subunit from P. furiosus (Pf-α-subunit) lacked 12 and 6 residues at the N and C termini, respectively, and one residue each in two loop regions as compared with that from S. typhimurium (St-α-subunit), resulting in the absence of an N-terminal helix and the shortening of a C-terminal helix. The structure of the Pf-α-subunit was essentially similar to that of the St-α-subunit in the α2β2 complex. The differences between both structures were discussed in connection with the higher stability of the Pf-α-subunit and the complex formation of the α- and β-subunits. Calorimetric results indicated that thePf-α-subunit has extremely high thermostability and that its higher stability is caused by an entropic effect. On the basis of structural information of both proteins, we analyzed the contributions of each stabilization factor and could conclude that hydrophobic interactions in the protein interior do not contribute to the higher stability of the Pf-α-subunit. Rather, the increase in ion pairs, decrease in cavity volume, and entropic effects due to shortening of the polypeptide chain play important roles in extremely high stability in Pf-α-subunit.

The separate α- and β2-subunits catalyze inherent reactions termed α and β reactions, respectively. When the α- and β2-subunits combine to form the α2β2 complex, the enzymatic activity of each subunit is stimulated by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude (1Miles E.W. Subcell. Biochem. 1995; 24: 207-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The α2β2 complex has been studied as an excellent model system for seeking answers to important questions in protein-protein interaction, especially in multifunctional enzymes. In 1988 (2Hyde C.C. Ahmed S.A. Paduardo E.A. Miles E.W. Davies D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17857-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) the three-dimensional structure of the tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex from Salmonella typhimurium was determined by x-ray analysis. However, the structure of the α-or β2-subunit alone has not yet been determined. To elucidate the molecular basis of the mutual activation of the subunit interaction due to the formation of the α2β2 complex, we need to know the structures of the α- or β2-subunits alone as well as that of the complex. Although the crystallization of each subunit fromS. typhimurium and Escherichia coli has been tried for many years (3Schultz G.E. Creighton T.E. Euro. J. Biochem. 1969; 10: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), the report of the x-ray structure has not yet appeared. Recently, the structures of a number of proteins from hyperthermophiles have been successfully determined by x-ray analysis. This seems due to the facts that proteins from hyperthermophiles are unusually stable and more easily form better crystals. Therefore, thetrpA and trpB genes, coding for tryptophan synthase, were cloned from Pyrococcus furiosus and their products were overexpressed in E. coli. The purified α-subunit from P. furiosus easily grew a suitable crystal for x-ray analysis, and the crystal structure could be determined at a resolution of 2.0 Å as described in this paper. On the other hand, a fundamental understanding of the conformational stability of proteins still remains elusive. Proteins from hyperthermophiles should retain their native structures under extreme conditions, whereas the homologous proteins from mesophiles completely denature. Therefore, comparative studies of extremely thermostable proteins with their homologs might help us understand the stabilization mechanism of a general globular protein. Recently, structures and physicochemical properties of proteins from hyperthermophiles have been extensively studied. In several hyperthermophile proteins, an increased number of ion pairs and ion pair networks have been observed (4Day M.W. Hsu B.T. Joshua-Tor L. Park J.-B. Zhou Z.H. Adams M.W.W. Rees D.C.

In the case of the tryptophan synthase α-subunit from P. furiosus, many ion pairs were also found. However, the effect of a surface salt bridge on the stability remains controversial even today; some reports have shown little contribution of a surface salt bridge to stability (14Horovitz A.

There are also reports on some hyperthermophile proteins without additional ion pairs (25Macedo-Riberio S. Darimont B. Sterner R. Huber R.

Biol. 1996; 255: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The conformation of general globular proteins is marginally maintained by the combination of many positive (such as hydrophobic interaction and hydrogen bond) and negative (such as entropic effect and steric hindrance) factors for stabilization (29Pace C.N. Shirley B.A. Mcnutt M. Gajiwala K. FASEB. J. 1996; 10: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). The enhanced stability of hyperthermophile proteins might originate from several attractive forces (30Jaenicke R. Bohm G. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 738-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). However, it still remains unclear what causes the dramatic stabilization of proteins from hyperthermophiles. Understanding the molecular origin for stabilization of hyperthermophile proteins provides valuable insights into the problems of protein stability, protein folding, and protein engineering. In this paper, to elucidate the stabilization mechanism of a protein from a hyperthermophile, the stability of the α-subunit from P. furiosus(Pf-α-subunit)1was examined by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and its structure by x-ray crystallography. The DSC data indicated that the higher stability of this protein was not caused by an enthalpic factor as compared with homologous mesophile proteins. The stabilization mechanism of the Pf-α-subunit is discussed on thermodynamic grounds based on structural information from x-ray analysis. The α-subunit of tryptophan synthase from P. furiosus(Pf-α-subunit) was overexpressed in E. colistrain JM109/pα1974 containing only the trpA gene fromP. furiosus. 2M. Ishida, T. Oshima, and K. Yutani, manuscript in preparation.. TheE. coli strain was routinely grown in 15 liters of LB medium supplemented with ampicillin of 100 mg/liter of culture medium. The production of the Pf-α-subunit was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d(−)-thiogalactopyranoside at a concentration of 1 mm to the culture medium after 1-h incubation at 37 °C with shaking. Then the culture was continued for about 20 h at 37 °C with shaking. Pelleted cells (wet weight of about 25 g) collected by centrifugation (5000 rpm for 10 min) were suspended in 100 ml of 20 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 5 mm DTT. The cells were disrupted by sonication on ice for 5 min with cooling intervals for 10 min and repeating three times. The homogenized solution was heated in a water bath for 10 min at 75 °C (the temperature of the solution), under which the majority of the E. coli proteins precipitated, leaving the Pf-α-subunit in the soluble fraction. The resultant suspended solution was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris and denatured E. coliproteins. The supernatant solution was treated with ammonium sulfate of 40% saturation and centrifuged, and the precipitate was discarded. ThePf-α-subunit was precipitated by addition of ammonium sulfate at 90% saturation. The precipitate was dissolved in 50 ml of 25 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) with 1 mm EDTA and 5 mm DTT and dialyzed against the same buffer overnight at 4 °C. The dialyzed sample was applied on a column (2.5 × 20 cm) of DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech): the enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient (25–200 mm) of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 5 mmDTT. Active fractions of the eluted solutions were concentrated using an Amicon PM10 membrane filter. Next, the protein was separated by gel filtration (Superdex TM200 26/60, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The active fractions collected were finally purified by ion exchange chromatography (SP-Sepharose 26/16, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a linear gradient of 25–100 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 5 mm DTT. The purified protein showed a single band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein concentration was estimated from absorbance at 278.5 nm at pH 7.0, OD1% = 6.92, using a cell with a light path length of 1 cm. The value was determined based on a protein assay by the Lowry method using bovine serum albumin as a standard protein. DSC was carried out with a differential scanning calorimeter, MicroCal VP-DSC (Northampton) at a scan rate of 1 K/min. Prior to the measurements, the protein solution was dialyzed against the buffer used. The dialyzed sample was filtered through a 0.22-μm pore size membrane and then degassed in vacuum. The buffers used were 20 mm glycine-HCl in the acidic region and 20 mm glycine-KOH in the alkaline region. The protein concentrations under measurement were 0.4–1.4 mg/ml. The DSC curves were analyzed by the Origin software from MicroCal (Northampton). Crystals suitable for data collection were grown by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 10 °C from a reservoir solution containing 0.1 mMES-NaOH, pH 6.5, and 12% polyethylene glycol 20000. X-ray data from the native and mercury derivative crystals were collected at the beam line 18B of the Photon Factory, Tsukuba using a Weissenberg camera (32Sakabe N. Nucl. Instr. Methods Phys. Res. 1991; A303: 448-463Crossref Scopus (320) Google Scholar) at 293 K. The data set of the platinum derivative was collected on a Rigaku R-axis IV imaging plate using nickel-filtered double-mirror focused Cu-Ka radiation from a Rigaku RU-200. The native and derivative data were processed and integrated by DENZO and scaled by SCALEPACK (33Otwinowski Z. Minor W.

The space group isC2221, and the unit cell dimensions area = 73.013, b = 78.997, andc = 170.964 Å (see Table II below).

Open table in a new tab Native, mercury, and platinum data sets were used for phase calculation by MIRAS (see TableII). The mercury position was identified in the difference Patterson map. Heavy atom sites in the platinum derivative were found in the difference Fourier maps calculated by using the phases from the first derivative with the program MLPHARE (35Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr., 50, 1994, 760, 763.Google Scholar). The heavy atom parameters were refined, and the phases were calculated to 2.2 Å with the program SHARP (36de La Fortelle E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). The initial MIR phases were improved by solvent flattening and noncrystallographic 2-fold symmetry averaging at the same resolution with the program SOLOMON (37Abrahams J.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar). An initial model was built using the program O (38Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Several cycles of rigid-body refinement, positional refinement, and simulated annealing were performed at 2.2-Å resolution with X-PLOR (39Brunger A.T. X-plor Version 3.8.5.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar). The refinements were continued at 2.0 Å using CNS (40Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Cryst. 1998; D54: 905-921Crossref Scopus (16978) Google Scholar). Successive refinement with temperature factors and addition of solvents resulted in an R-value of 19.8% and anRfree of 24.9% for reflections in the resolution range 40–2.0 Å. Rfree was calculated with 5% of the reflections. During refinements NCS restraints were enforced. The current model includes residues 1–166, 174–248 for molecule a and 1–169, 173–248 for molecule b, and 421 water molecules. Model geometry was analyzed with PROCHECK (41Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Cryst. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and 96.4% of the nonglycine residues were in the most favorable region of the Ramachandran plot and 3.3% in the additionally allowed region. The final coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession number 1GEQ). The electrostatic free energy Gel of the protein-solvent system is generally described by a sum of the direct Coulombic energy and the dielectric shielding from the solvent due to the reaction field (42Nakamura H. Rev. Biophys. 1996; 29: 1-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), Gel=12∑i≠jqiqjεp‖ri−rj‖+12∑iqiϕreact(ri)Equation 1 The potential energy ϕreact(ri) due to the dielectric shielding at the ith charge positionri, can be given as the difference between the electrostatic potentials ϕsol(ri) and ϕvac(ri), both of which were calculated by numerically solving the Poisson equations, Δε(r)Δϕ(r)=−4π∑qiδ(r−ri)Equation 2 assuming εp = 10 and εp= εs = 80, respectively. Here, qi is theith charge and εp and εs are the dielectric constants ε(r) in the protein region and in the solvent region, respectively. εs in the solvent region was always assumed to be 80. The divergence of the electrostatic potential due to the self-Coulombic energy can be completely avoided, because the delta function in the right-hand side in eq. 2 is replaced by the smooth charge density in the actual numerical calculations (42Nakamura H. Rev. Biophys. 1996; 29: 1-90Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the continuum model for the native state, only the ionic charges were assumed as qi to be located on both carboxyl oxygen atoms of the side chains of Asp and Glu, on the Nζ atoms of Lys, on the Cζ atoms of Arg, and on an N atom of the N terminus, respectively. When a strong ion pair is formed within 3 Å between the two heavy atoms, −e charge was assumed on one of the two carboxyl oxygen atoms of Asp or Glu, which is the closest to the positively charged residue, and +e charge was on Nη1, Nη2, or Nε, which is the closest to the negatively charged residue, in the case of Arg. Then, the above Poisson equations were numerically solved twice for the different εp values. For the denatured state, the Coulombic term was calculated by using the root mean square distance 〈 r ij2〉1/2 between the ith and jth charges in the different residues as the distance between those charges. We evaluated the mean square distance between the corresponding Cα atoms for a simplified protein chain model, which was approximated by a Gaussian chain composed of only the connected Cα atoms, with the mean inter-Cα bond length 3.8 Å and the angle between the successive three Cα atoms 106.3° (43Levitt M. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 104: 59-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Adding the squared distances between the Cα atom and the charge position in each extended side chain for the ith andjth charges, respectively, r ij2 in the denatured state was estimated. As the value of (ϕsol(ri) − ϕvac(ri)) in the denatured state, the Poisson equations were solved for the models of the extended amino acid trimers, Ala-Xaa-Ala, where Xaa is Asp, Glu, Lys, or Arg. No charges were assumed on the N or C termini in the trimer models. The interaction term between the ith and jth charges in the reaction field calculation was neglected in the denatured states. A similar calculation was also performed for the N terminus using the extended Met-Ala model, assuming +e charge on the N atom of Met. To examine the thermal stability of thePf-α-subunit, DSC measurements were carried out at various pH values. Fig. 1 shows excess heat capacity curves of both the Pf-α-subunit and α-subunits from E. coli (Ec-α-subunit) near pH 9.5. The denaturation temperature of the Pf-α-subunit was about 33 °C higher than that of the Ec-α-subunit at the same conditions, indicating that the protein from a hyperthermophile has extremely high thermostability. In the acidic region from pH 3 to 4, the heat denaturation of the Pf-α-subunit was almost completely reversible, but the Ec-α-subunit was acid-denatured at room temperature. In Fig.2 the specific enthalpy changes upon denaturation (Δh, the enthalpy value per a gram of proteins) obtained from DSC curves of the Pf-α-subunit at various pH values are plotted against the denaturation temperature at each pH. Line (a) represents a least-square fit to the experimental points of the Pf-α-subunit. The slope corresponds to the specific heat capacity change of denaturation (Δcp). The Δcpvalue (0.52 J K−1 g−1) of thePf-α-subunit was slightly smaller than those of theEc-α-subunit and the α-subunit from S. typhimurium (St-α-subunit), which are similar to each other (0.64 J K−1 g−1 from the slope ofline 2 in Sugisaki et al.

The figure indicates that Δh values of the Pf-α-subunit were considerably lower than those of mesophile proteins at each temperature shown in the figure: for example, Δh was 10.3 J/g and 21.4 J/g for those from the Pf-α-subunit and mesophile proteins, respectively, at 60 °C. The thermodynamic parameters for heat denaturation as a function of temperature can be calculated using the following equations, Δh(T)=Δh(Td)−Δcp(Td−T)Equation 3 Δs(T)=Δh(Td)/Td−Δcpln(Td/T)Equation 4 Δg(T)=Δh(T)−TΔs(T)Equation 5 assuming that Δcp does not depend on temperature (45Privalov P.L. Khechinashvili N.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1974; 86: 665-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar). The temperature functions of Δg for thePf-α-subunit and the Ec-α-subunits at pH 9.5 obtained from eq. 5 are shown in Fig. 3, indicating that the Pf-α-subunit is more stable than theEc-α-subunit under all the temperatures shown. The difference in Δg was remarkable at higher temperatures. Because the denaturation enthalpies of the Pf-α-subunit under all the temperatures as shown in Fig. 2 are lower than those of the Ec-α-subunit, the increase in Δg ofPf-α-subunit comes from the decrease in Δs as shown in Fig. 3.Figure 2Specific enthalpy change upon denaturation for tryptophan synthase α-subunit from theP. furiosus as a function of denaturation temperature.

Here we show that LAR reduces the constitutive tyrosine autophosphorylation and kinase activity of RET-MEN2A but not RET-MEN2B, accompanying a significant decrease of phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ, AKT, and ERK1/2. Interestingly, LAR expression significantly decreased the levels of disulfide-linked RET-MEN2A dimerization. Moreover, reduced oncogenic activity of RET-MEN2A by overexpression of LAR was observed both by an in vitro colony formation assay and by in vivo tumorigenicity in scid mice.

Because many oncogenes encode PTKs, it was thought that PTPs might represent tumor suppressors, although it remains to be conclusively demonstrated. It has been shown that hemizygous deletions of the gene for PTPγ mapped to chromosome 3p21 have been detected in tumor cells of renal and pulmonary origin (2LaForgia S. Morse B. Levy J. Barnea G.

Leukocyte common antigen-related (LAR) protein-tyrosine-phosphatase is a prototypic member of the receptor-type PTP (RPTP) subfamily that is a transmembrane molecule composed of a 1234-amino acid extracellular receptor-like region and a 623-amino acid cytoplasmic region containing two tandemly repeated PTP domains (11Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Hall L.R. Schlossman S.F. Saito H. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 1523-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). The extracellular region is composed of three immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains and eight repeats of fibronectin type III domains and resembles neural-cell adhesion molecules (11Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Hall L.R. Schlossman S.F. Saito H. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 1523-1530Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar).

This hypothesis was supported by studies showing the reduced size of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons and loss of cholinergic innervations of the dentate gyrus inLAR-deficient transgenic mice (16Yeo T.T.

J. Clin. Oncol. 1999; 17: 380-393Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings led us to postulate that LAR may modulate the function of the RET-MEN2 proteins in human tumors. In this study, to explore the potential role of LAR for RET tyrosine kinase activities, we cotransfected LAR and RET with a MEN2Aor MEN2B mutation into the NIH 3T3 cells. As a result, we found that LAR reduced the levels of phosphorylation, tyrosine kinase activity, and oncogenic activity of RET-MEN2A but not RET-MEN2B. Activation levels of signaling molecules potentially downstream of RET kinase were also down-regulated to variable degrees. These results thus suggested that LAR could play a role in the regulation of the function of RET-MEN2A proteins. Anti-LAR, anti-PLCγ, and anti-AKT/PKB monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Anti-RET rabbit polyclonal antibody was developed against the C-terminal 19 amino acids of the RET long isoform as described previously (29Asai N. Murakami H. Iwashita T. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17644-17649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Anti-phospho-RET (tyrosine 1062)-specific polyclonal antibody was developed against with a synthetic peptide (IENKLpYGMSDP) corresponding to the residues around tyrosine 1062 of human RET. Anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake placid, NY). Anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204) and anti-phospho-AKT (serine 473) polyclonal antibodies were purchased from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA), and anti-ERK 2 polyclonal antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The construction of the Aptag-1 vector containing a full-length RET cDNA with aMEN2A (Cys-634 → Tyr) or MEN2B (Met-918 → Thr) mutation was described previously (30Iwashita T. Asai N. Murakami H. Matsuyama M. Takahashi M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 481-487PubMed Google Scholar). pMT LAR plasmid containing a full-length LAR cDNA was provided kindly by Dr. H. Saito (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). As a control, a truncated mutant LAR cDNA (LAR-ΔTP) was generated by ligating a 2638-bp EcoRI/NheI humanLAR cDNA fragment, resulting in the generation of a protein of 756 amino acids (Fig. 1a). NIH 3T3 cells (5 × 105 in a 6-cm-diameter dish) were cotransfected with 0.2–0.5 μg of RET-MEN2A orRET-MEN2B plasmid DNA and 1 μg ofLAR or LAR-ΔTP plasmid DNA, and stable clones resistant to 250 μg/ml hygromycin B were selected and maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Nissui Pharmaceutical, Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 8% bovine calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT). Cells were grown subconfluently in 60-mm dishes and serum-starved for 6 h. Then they were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (RIPA) (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation (15,000 × g) for 1 h and incubated with 1–2 μg of primary antibodies for 2 h, and the immunocomplexes were precipitated with protein A- or G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. After immunoprecipitation, beads were washed four times with RIPA buffer, suspended in sample buffer (2.0% (w/v) SDS, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2 mm EDTA, 10% (w/v) sucrose, and 20 μg/ml bromphenol blue) in the absence or presence of 80 mmdithiothreitol and boiled for 3 min. The lysates were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), separated on 5–10% gradient gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Nihon Millipore Kogyo KK, Tokyo, Japan) overnight at 100 mA. The transferred proteins on the membrane were treated with 0.5% (v/v) Tween-phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% (w/v) ovoalbumin for 1 h. Then, the membrane was incubated overnight at 4 °C with different primary antibodies. Secondary antibodies used for Western blotting were peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse (1:1000) or anti-rabbit (1:1000) immunoglobulins (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). The filters were washed four times with Tween-phosphate-buffered saline and examined by using a chemiluminescence ECL detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Tokyo). Before reprobing with different primary antibodies, the blots were stripped by incubation in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol) for 45 min at 55 °C. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. RET proteins were purified from 500 μg of cellular proteins by immunoprecipitation with anti-RET polyclonal antibody. The immunoprecipitated RET proteins were washed three times with the RIPA buffer and twice with the LAR protein-tyrosine-phosphatase (PTP) buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm Na2EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij-35) and divided into two portions. Then they were suspended in 30 μl of LAR PTP buffer containing 1 unit of purified LAR and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reactions were terminated by adding an equal volume of 2 × SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and subjected to immunoblotting as described above. Two hundred micrograms of total proteins was immunoprecipitated with 1 μg of anti-RET polyclonal antibody and incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads. The beads were washed twice with RIPA buffer (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate and three times with kinase buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mmMgCl2) and suspended in the kinase buffer with 2.0 μg of myelin basic protein (MBP) (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) as an exogenous substrate, and 370 kBq of [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Wilmington, DE). They were incubated for 20 min at 30 °C. The reactions were terminated by adding an equal volume of 2 × SDS sample buffer and loaded onto SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were incubated three times for 30 min in a fixing solution (20% methanol/10% acetic acid), dried, and visualized by autoradiography. A cDNA sequence corresponding to the LAR PTP domain (amino acids 1275–1881) was inserted into the BamHI site of the pGEX-2T plasmid (11Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Hall L.R. Schlossman S.F. Saito H. J.

Escherichia coli NM522 was transformed with the expression plasmids and grown at 24 °C, and protein synthesis was induced by the addition of 0.1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside. The bacterial pellet was suspended in ice-cold NETN buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl) and sonicated six times (each for 15 s). Bacterial debris was removed by centrifugation, and fusion proteins in the supernatant were bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), washed three times with 10 volumes of buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl), and resuspended in NETN buffer. The resulting cell lysates containing 400 μg of total cellular proteins were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with GST fusion proteins. The GST protein complexes were washed four times with RIPA buffer, and the beads were resuspended in 30 μl of Laemmli buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 20% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 20 μg/ml bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, and then fractionated on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels. Immunoblotting with anti-RET antibody was performed as described above. Soft agar assays were carried out in 6-cm dishes as described by Clark et al. (33Clark G.J. Cox A.D. Graham S.M. Der C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 395-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 104 cells were suspended in 0.3% agar in DMEM containing 10% CS and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and added on a bottom layer of 0.6% agar. The plates were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified 7.5% CO2 incubator for 2 weeks. The colonies were also stained with 500 mg/ml MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide], Sigma, Deisenhofen) for 2–3 h and counted with a microscope. All assays were done in quadruplicates. For tumorigenesis studies, 1 × 107 cells were washed twice, suspended in 0.2 ml of DMEM, and then inoculated subcutaneously into 10-week-old male scid mice (five mice/group). Local tumor growth was measured daily, and mice were sacrificed 16 days after injection to weigh the tumors. LAR is initially synthesized as a ∼200-kDa proprotein that is processed at a pentabasic site by an endogenous protease (a subtilisin-like protease), leading to a complex of two noncovalently associated subunits; the extracellular- or E-subunit (150 kDa) contains the cell adhesion molecule-like domain and the phosphatase or P-subunit (85 kDa) contains an 82-amino acid extracellular region and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (Fig.1a) (34Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Ariniello P.D. Tang M. Munro J.M. Blattler W.A. Adler D.A. Disteche C.M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 897-907Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). After cotransfection of NIH 3T3 cells with RET-MEN2A or RET-MEN2B andLAR or LAR-ΔTP, stable clones resistant to 250 μg/ml hygromycin B were selected and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 8% bovine calf serum. Immunoblotting of the lysates from cells transfected with the LAR gene demonstrated about 5-fold increase in the abundance of the LAR protein compared with that of the endogenous LAR protein in untransfected cells (Fig. 1b). The migration of the transfected LAR protein species, a ∼200-kDa precursor and a ∼150-kDa proteolytically cleaved extracellular domain subunit, was detected by anti-LAR monoclonal antibody directed against the LAR N terminus, whereas cells transfected with the truncatedLAR cDNA expressed a protein with an apparent molecular mass of ∼98 kDa (Fig. 1b). However, when the same filter was stripped and reprobed with anti-RET polyclonal antibody, there was no significant difference in the expression levels of the RET proteins in all cell lines examined (Fig. 1b). We first measured the levels of tyrosine phosphorylation and kinase activity of RET in the established cell lines. Equal protein amounts of their lysates (25 μg) were subjected to Western blotting with anti-phosphotyrosine monoclonal antibody, 4G10. As shown in Fig.2a, the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of the 175-kDa RET in RET-MEN2A/LAR cells was significantly lower than that in RET-MEN2A and RET-MEN2A/LAR-ΔTP cells, whereas there was no difference in the phosphorylation levels of RET among RET-MEN2B, RET-MEN2B/LAR, and RET-MEN2B/LAR-ΔTP cells. Because the decrease of tyrosine phosphorylation of the RET protein was observed in three independent RET-MEN2A/LAR clones (date not shown), we pooled them for the following experiments. In addition, this result was confined by immunoprecipitation of the lysates with anti-RET antibody, followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig.2b). We next measured the RET tyrosine kinase activity in each cell line. Equal amounts (250 μg) of lysates from the cell lines were immunoprecipitated with the anti-RET antibody and incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and MBP. Phosphorylated products were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by autoradiography (Fig.3a). The relative levels of catalytic activities were calculated by densitometric analyses of each band, and the results were plotted as percent decrease of phosphorylation levels relative to those in RET-MEN2A/LAR-ΔTP- expressing cells (Fig. 3, b andc). We found the RET autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of MBP that was used as an exogenous substrate were reduced by 80 and 70%, respectively, in RET-MEN2A/LAR cells compared with those in RET-MEN2A/LAR-ΔTP cells. Consistent with the previous results (35Carlomagno F. Melillo R.M. Visconti R. Salvatore G. De Vita G. Lupoli G., Yu, Y. Jing S. Vecchio G. Fusco A. Santoro M. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3613-3619Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar,36Bongarzone I. Vigano E. Alberti L. Borrello M.G. Pasini B. Greco A. Mondellini P. Smith D.P. Ponder B.A. Romeo G. Pierotti M.A. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2295-2301Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), the autophosphorylation of RET-MEN2B proteins from RET-MEN2B/LAR and RET-MEN2B/LAR-ΔTP cells was much lower than that of RET-MEN2A proteins. However, the inhibitory effects of LAR on RET-MEN2B autophosphorylation and kinase activity were not observed in RET-MEN2B/LAR cells (Fig. 3). These results confirmed that overexpression of LAR inhibited the tyrosine kinase activity of only RET-MEN2A. The above results suggest that RET may be a direct substrate of LAR. To test this possibility, phosphorylated RET was immunoprecipitated and incubated with purified LAR in vitro. As shown in Fig. 4, RET was efficiently and completely dephosphorylated, suggesting that RET is a preferred and efficient substrate of LAR tyrosine phosphatase in vitro. To investigate the mechanism of how LAR inhibits the RET-MEN2A kinase activity and reduces the level of its autophosphorylation, we examined whether LAR interacts with the RET proteins. Initially, cell extracts were incubated with anti-RET polyclonal antibody in the presence of PTP inhibitor (sodium vanadate). Proteins that bound to RET were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads and analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-LAR antibody. However, no LAR was detected by this approach, presumably because active LAR may rapidly dephosphorylate and dissociate the substrate in vivo despite the presence of phosphatase inhibitor (data not shown). To overcome this problem, we used mutant LAR in which Cys-1552 was changed to Ser (C1552S, abbreviated as CS). Because Cys-1552 is located in the catalytic center of LAR, the CS mutant has no phosphatase activity (31Smith M.R. Ryu S.H. Suh P.G. Rhee S.G. Kung H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 3659-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), whereas it should retain its affinity for the substrates. A physical association was observed between an analogous CS mutant of the 3CH134PTP and its putative substrate; p42 MAPK (37Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1027) Google Scholar). Equal protein amounts (250 μg) of the lysates prepared from each transfectant were incubated with GST, GST-LAR, and GST-LAR-CS immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads and then separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Immunoblot analysis with anti-RET antibody indicated that GST-LAR-CS but not GST-LAR bound to both RET-MEN2A and RET-MEN2B, suggesting that association of wild-type LAR with mutant RET proteins may be transient (Fig. 5). The effects of RET tyrosine kinase are mediated by the concerted activation of several signaling pathways, including SHC, phospholipase Cγ, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and MAPK (38Airaksinen M.S. Titievsky A. Saarma M. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1999; 13: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated whether all kinase-dependent events are affected to a similar degree by expression of LAR. To demonstrate these, we have analyzed some occurrences of RET-dependent intracellular signaling in the transfectants. First, equal amounts of the cell lysates (250 μg) were immunoprecipitated with anti-PLCγ, followed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody. Overexpression of LAR in RET-MEN2A cells caused an ∼80% reduction in the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ, compared with that in RET-MEN2A/LAR-ΔTP cells (Fig.6a). However, the tyrosine phosphorylation levels of PLCγ were approximately equal in RET-MEN2B/LAR and RET-MEN2B/LAR-ΔTP cells. After stripping this membrane, it was reprobed with anti-PLCγ antibody to verify equal protein loading (Fig. 6a, lower panel). We also tested the effect of LAR on ERK1/2 and AKT/PKB activation. Cell lysates (25 μg) from each cell line were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204) or anti-phospho-AKT (Ser-473). As shown in Fig. 6 (b andc, upper panels), the phosphorylation levels of both proteins significantly decreased in RET-MEN2A/LAR cells compare with those in RET-MEN2A/LAR-ΔTP cells. In contrast, no marked difference was observed between the RET-MEN2B/LAR-ΔTP and RET-MEN2B/LAR cells. Equal protein loading was verified by reprobing the membrane with anti-ERK 2 and anti-AKT antibodies (Fig. 6,b and c, lower panels). Because ERK1/2 and AKT are known to be activated through phosphorylated tyrosine 1062 in RET (39Hayashi H. Ichihara M. Iwashita T. Murakami H. Shimono Y. Kawai K. Kurokawa K. Murakumo Y. Imai T. Funahashi H. Nakao A. Takahashi M. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 4469-4475Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), we investigated its phosphorylated state using anti-phospho-RET (tyrosine 1062)-specific antibody. To define the specificity of this antibody, we established NIH 3T3 cells expressing RET-MEN2A proteins in which tyrosine 1062 was replaced with phenylalanine (designated Y1062F). As shown in Fig.6d, anti-phospho-RET (tyrosine 1062)-specific antibody detected tyrosine phosphorylation of RET-MEN2A proteins but not RET-MEN2A (Y1062F) proteins (upper panel), although there was no obvious difference in tyrosine phosphorylation between RET-MEN2A and RET-MEN2A (Y1062F) proteins (Fig. 6d, middle panel). As expected, LAR expression significantly reduced tyrosine-1062 phosphorylation in RET-MEN2A but not in RET-MEN2B (Fig.6e, upper panel). The levels of RET protein expression were comparable in each cell line (Fig. 6, d ande, lower panels). The MEN2A mutations activate RET by inducing its ligand-independent dimerization, whereas the MEN2B mutations activate RET without dimerization (30Iwashita T. Asai N. Murakami H. Matsuyama M. Takahashi M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 481-487PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, we investigated whether LAR expression affects the dimerization of the RET-MEN2A proteins. When the lysates from each transfectant were analyzed by immunoblotting under reducing or nonreducing conditions, LAR expression significantly decreased the dimerization and phosphorylation of RET-MEN2A proteins, demonstrating that their decreased kinase activity correlates with their decreased dimer formation (Fig.7). We examined whether LAR can reverse cell transformation by RET-MEN2A. RET-MEN2A/LAR-ΔTP cells were rounded, refractile, and highly transformed, whereas the RET-MEN2A/LAR cells resumed a more flattened morphology (Fig. 8,a–c).

Partial sequence analysis of the purified enzyme (DlPar13) revealed sequence homology to members of the parvulin family of PPIases. Similar to human Pin1 and yeast Ess1, it exhibits catalytic activity toward substrates containing (Thr(P)/Ser(P))-Pro peptide bonds and comparable inhibition kinetics with juglone. Unlike Pin1-type enzymes it lacks the phosphoserine or phosphothreonine binding WW domain. Western blotting with anti-DlPar13 serum recognized the endogenous form in nucleic and cytosolic fractions of the plant cells. Since thePIN1 homologue ESS1 is an essential gene, complementation experiments in yeast were performed. When overexpressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae DlPar13 is almost as effective as hPin1 in rescuing the temperature-sensitive phenotype caused by a mutation in ESS1. In contrast, the human parvulin hPar14 is not able to rescue the lethal phenotype of this yeast strain at nonpermissive temperatures. These results suggest a function for DlPar13 rather similar to parvulins of the Pin1-type.

Chem. Soc. Rev. 2000; 29: 119-127Crossref Scopus (278) Google Scholar). Regarding substrate specificity there exists the parvulin subfamily of the Pin1-type. Enzymes of this subfamily show a striking preference for peptide and protein substrates containing phosphorylated side chains of serine or threonine residues preceding the proline position (2Zhou X.Z.

Phosphorylation of (Ser/Thr)-Pro motifs by proline-directed proteine kinases occurs as part of regulatory processes during cell division and signal transduction events. For hPin1 a role in control of mitosis was suggested (2Zhou X.Z. Lu P.-J. Wulf G. Lu K.P. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 1999; 56: 788-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Consistent with the observed substrate specificity, hPin1 generates catalytically a substrate conformation of phosphoproteins productive in the dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 2A (7Zhou X.Z.

Besides the catalytic preference of hPin1 for phosphorylated substrates, the direct interaction with numerous mitotic phosphoproteins has been previously demonstrated (2Zhou X.Z. Lu P.-J. Wulf G.

Zhou X.Z. Shen M.H. Lu K.P. Science. 1999; 283: 1325-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar).

Most of other identified parvulins of the Pin1-type contain an N-terminal WW domain, e.g. Ess1/Ptf1 fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae (14Hanes S.D. Shank P.R. Bostian K.A.

For this enzyme a preference for phosphorylated oligopeptide substrates has been shown. However, currently there is no data concerning the physiological role of this enzyme. The function of Pin1-type parvulins appears to be conserved in several organisms. The only existing yeast homologue, Ess1/Ptf1, is encoded by an essential gene (14Hanes S.D. Shank P.R. Bostian K.A. Yeast. 1989; 5: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 15Hani J. Stumpf G. Domdey H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 198-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). A mutation leading to a single amino acid exchange in the protein causes a temperature-sensitive phenotype and cells exhibit terminal mitotic arrest at nonpermissive temperature. The lack of Ess1/Ptf1 function under this condition can be readily replaced by hPin1 (21Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 380: 544-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar) or by D. melanogaster Dodo (18Maleszka R. Hanes S.D. Hackett R.L. de Couet H.G. Miklos G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 447-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), supporting the idea of a related function. It remains an open question whether the WW domain is a crucial condition of the rescuing function. However, for the homologous protein xPin1 in X. laevis a requirement for proper function of the replication checkpoint has been demonstrated (19Winkler K.E. Swenson K.I. Kornbluth S. Means A.R. Science. 2000; 287: 1644-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Here we describe the isolation of a small parvulin from PEMs ofD. lanata according to its PPIase activity toward phosphorylated peptide substrates, which demonstrates for the first time the PPIase activity of an endogenous parvulin of the Pin1-type. The substrate specificity and inhibition kinetics were analyzed in more detail. Similar to other plant homologues such as the A. thaliana AtPin1 and the Malus domesticus MdPin1 (43Yao J-L. Kops O. Lu P-J. Lu K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13517-13523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) this enzyme does not comprise a WW or any other domain adjacent to the catalytical core. We therefore addressed the question if this special plant enzyme can also functionally replace the yeast Ess1/Ptf1. For general screening purposes the protease-coupled PPIase microplate assay was performed (22Kullertz G. Luthe S. Fischer G. Clin. Chem. 1998; 44: 502-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The specificity constants kcat/Kmwere determined according to Fischer et al. (23Fischer G. Bang H. Mech C. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1984; 43: 1101-1111PubMed Google Scholar).

The sensitivity of the PPIase assay was calculated with the equation [lowest detectable PPIase concentration] = 4*ko/kcat/KM), withko as the uncatalyzed first-order rate constant. The factor 4 results from both, the sample volume was half of the total volume and the limit of detection is the 2-fold ofko.

For RT-PCR the two degenerative primers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg, Germany), sense 5′-CGNGGCGGNGAYCTNGG-3′ and antisense 5′-TTRATGATGTGNACKCC-3′, were used. PCR amplification was performed under the following conditions: 5 min 95 °C, 35 cycles of 1 min 95 °C, 1 min 55 °C, and 1 min 72 °C, and at least 10 min at 72 °C. The resulting 128-base pair PCR fragment was cloned into a TOPO T/A-vector (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands), multiplied, and sequenced (33Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). A λ-ZAP cDNA library (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany) constructed from poly(A)+ RNA of PEMs of D. lanata served as a template for screening. Approximately 250,000 plaque-forming units were screened using the [α-32P]dATP-labeled PCR fragment described above as a probe. The three positive plaques were further purified by new rounds of plating and screening and afterward in vivo excised and sequenced. Further subcloning was performed using PCR to introduce a 5′KpnI and a 3′ HindIII site to the coding sequence. The construct was inserted in-frame with the coding sequence for an N-terminal hexahistidine tag into the pQE30 expression vector (Qiagen). Recombinant DlPar13 was purified according to the manufacturers instructions for His-tagged protein expression (Qiagen) and used for antiserum production in rabbit (pab-productions, Herbertshausen, Germany). Immunoblot analysis was performed with horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Sigma) and the ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Braunschweig, Germany). The yeast temperature-sensitive strain YPM2 (11Hani J. Schelbert B. Bernhardt A. Domdey H. Fischer G. Wiebauer K. Rahfeld J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 108-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) was transformed with the expression vector pBC100 containing the respective gene under the transcriptional control of a galactose inducible promoter. The coding sequence for DlPar13 was subcloned in-frame with the hemagglutinin epitope tag into a pBC100 vector. Simultaneous the humanPAR14 gene was subcloned into the pBC100 vector. Gene expression in the stably transformed YPM2 strains was controlled by Western blot analysis of the cell lysates from cultures grown in inducing medium at permissive temperature (23 °C) using a monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin epitope antibody (12CA5). For the complementation analysis cells of the respective strain selected on the appropriate medium at permissive temperature were resuspended in 10 mmTris buffer, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA and the optical density adjusted to A600 = 1.0. The suspensions (5 μl) and three 10-fold dilutions were applied to agar plates containing minimal media supplemented with the appropriate carbohydrate source to induce or repress gene expression. As controls two YPM2 strains transformed with the vector only and a hPin1 pBC100 construct, respectively, were used. The chromatographic isolation of a phospho-specific parvulin from cells grown as PEMs of D. lanata Ehrh. strain VIII was carried out by applying a sensitive PPIase assay for detection of phosphorylation-specific enzyme activity in crude protein solutions. According to the ratio of enzymatic activity toward the side chain phosphorylated substrate Ac-Ala-Ser(OPO3H2)-Pro-Tyr-NH-Np and the unphosphorylated counterpart, the phospho-specific protein was enriched 19-fold after anion exchange chromatography and dye affinity chromatography. This almost perfectly coincides with the purification factor of 22.7 calculated from the specific PPIase activity toward the phosphorylated substrate, indicating a very low probability of other phospho-specific PPIase activities in these cells. About 0.5 μg of homogenous DlPar13 was isolated from a single peak with the retention time of 17.2 min in the reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (nucleosil C18) using 320 mg of total cell protein as starting material. For identification, the molecular mass of the protein was determined at 12,846 Da by matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight mass spectrometry (data not shown). Since the N terminus was not accessible to Edman degradation the protein was digested with endoprotease Lys-C yielding eight proteolytic fragments (data not shown). A data base search using the obtained partial sequence information revealed homology to the catalytic domains of parvulins. The nuclear fraction and the mitochondrial, microsomal, ribosomal, and cytosolic supernatant fractions of the D. lanata PEMs extract were examined forDlPar13 content. Activities of three enzymes were used as subcellular markers. The DlPar13 was detectable in both nuclear and cytosolic fractions (Fig.1). The marker enzymes for mitochondrial (succinate dehydrogenase) and microsomal (cytochrome creductase) fractions indicate that both fractions contain a mixture of proteins of the particular compartment (TableII). By using Western blot analysis the amount of DlPar13 was negligible in the microsomal fraction but has a considerable magnitude in the mitochondrial fraction. The presence of mitochondrial marker enzymes in microsomal fractions has already been described for subcellular fractionating of A. thaliana preparations using a similar preparation technique (29Qi Q.

Our results indicate that DlPar13 does not occur in microsomes but could not definitively exclude a minor amount ofDlPar13 in mitochondria.Table IISubcellular distribution of DlPar13 and organelle marker enzyme activities in PEMs of D. lanataFractionsDlPar132-aPercentage ofDlPar13 in the particular fraction were derived from Western blot analysis.

Enzyme activities were expressed as percentage of the total activies. The total enzyme activities were determined in the pooled fractions. Using the obtained partial sequence data, oligonucleotide primers were designed and used for RT-PCR with D. lanata mRNA as template. With an amplified 128-base pair PCR fragment as probe a cDNA library derived from PEMs of D. lanata was screened. The resulting 354-base pair full-length cDNA clone encoding for 118 amino acids was subcloned into the procaryotic expression vector pQE30. Based on the amino acid composition a theoretical isoelectric point of 8.9 and a molecular mass of 12,834 Da was calculated. The amino acid sequence either derived from the cDNA clone (Fig. 2) or the 128-base pair PCR fragment was identical, but showed a deviation in three amino acid residues (S79P, D91E, and G95A) when compared with the original partial sequence of DlPar13. Since these data was verified in repeated experiments and sequencing errors can be excluded, the existence of two or more isoforms of this phosphorylation-specific parvulin in D. lanata is conceivable. As the complete amino acid sequence of the isolated DlPar13 is unknown we only can assume that more exchanges are likely to exist between the two suggested isoforms. The occurrence of multiple enzyme forms seem not to be unusual for plant parvulins because of the presence of several homologous EST sequences of parvulin genes in Lycopersicon esculentum (AW621901, AW621939, AW945046) and in Glycine max (AW308915, AW397670, AW761425, AI507774). Using a specific DlPar13 antibody raised against the recombinant protein, the concentration of the endogenousDlPar13 in the cell homogenates of PEMs was estimated at 5 ng of protein/mg of total protein by Western blot analysis using the recombinant protein as an internal standard (data not shown). Based on Northern blot analysis the transcription level of theDlPAR13 within a 2-year-old foxglove plant was compared (data not shown). In all analyzed tissues (1- and 2-year-old roots, stems, 1- and 2-year-old rosette leaves, flowers, and seedlings) the specific mRNA transcripts were detectable with similar concentrations. DlPar13 shares a high degree of homology to the parvulins of the Pin1-type (Fig. 2). This similarity is especially high with the plant enzyme AtPar13 (6Landrieu I. DeVeylder L. Fruchart J.S.

The degree of homology to the PPIase domains of other Pin1-like enzymes were found to be 53% with hPin1 (accession number Q13526 (21Lu K.P. Hanes S.D. Hunter T.

Less sequence homology exists to other parvulins with rather unspecific substrate recognition pattern including hPar14 with 28% identity (accession number AB009690 (34Uchida T. Fujimori F. Tradler T.

FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 180-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar)) with 32% identity to DlPar13. In both enzymes some amino acid residues of the supposed substrate binding pocket differ from the conserved region of the phosphorylation-specific proteins as illustrated in Fig. 2. Based on data of the crystal structure of hPin1 (5Ranganathan R. Lu K.P. Hunter T. Noel J.P. Cell. 1997; 89: 875-886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (607) Google Scholar) and site-directed mutagenesis experiments (11Hani J. Schelbert B. Bernhardt A. Domdey H. Fischer G. Wiebauer K. Rahfeld J.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 108-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), it was supposed that a basic cluster of the two arginine residues Arg68 and Arg69 coordinates the side chain phosphate group of the substrate. Both residues together with the third basic residue, Lys63 in hPin1, are conserved among the Pin1-type parvulins. In DlPar13 the specific sequence features exist as Lys14, Arg19, and Arg20. The substrate specificity of the recombinantDlPar13 toward a set of oligopeptide derivatives (Table I) indicates a preference for phosphorylated Ser or Thr side chains in the position preceding proline. For example, thekcat/Km value for the substrate Ac-Ala-Ser(OPO3H2)-Pro-Tyr-NH-Np was determined with 15.9 μm−1 s−1and hence is in the order of the specificity constants of other Pin1-related parvulins (3Yaffe M.B.

This is even less enzymatic activity than was determined for hPin1 and Ptf1 toward this unphosphorylated substrate. It should be mentioned that we observed the same ratio of catalytic activity toward both substrates for the authentic DlPar13. To further characterize this enzyme activity, inhibition studies with the parvulin-specific irreversible inhibitor juglone were performed (Fig. 3). The mechanism of enzyme inactivation comprises the covalent binding of the inhibitor molecule to a highly conserved cysteine resi"

LHCs can be divided into chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins found in green algae, euglenoids, and higher plants and into chlorophyll a/c-binding proteins of various algal taxa. LHC proteins from diatoms are named fucoxanthin-chlorophyll a/c-binding proteins (FCP). In contrast to chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins, there is no information so far about the way FCPs integrate into thylakoid membranes. The diatom FCP preproteins have a bipartite presequence that is necessary to enable transport into the four membrane-bound diatom plastids, but similar to chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins there is apparently no presequence present for targeting to the thylakoid membrane. By establishing an in vitro import assay for diatom thylakoids, we demonstrated that thylakoid integration of diatom FCP depends on the presence of stromal factors and GTP. This indicates that a pathway involving signal recognition particles (SRP) is involved in membrane integration just as shown for LHCs in higher plants. We also demonstrate integration of diatom FCP into thylakoids of higher plants and vice versa SRP-dependent targeting of LHCs from pea and Arabidopsis into diatom thylakoids. The similar SRP-dependent modes of thylakoid integration of land plant LHCs and FCPs support recent analyses indicating a common origin of chlorophyll a/b- and a/c-binding proteins.

The light-harvesting complexes (LHC)1 from eukaryotic algae and land plants probably evolved from a common ancestor that is not present in modern cyanobacteria (1Durnford D.G. Deane J.A. Tan S. McFadden G.I. Gantt E. Green B.R. J. Mol. Evol. 1999; 48: 59-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 2Grossman A.R. Bhaya D. Apt K.E. Kehoe D.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 231-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). They form a superfamily of thylakoid membrane-intrinsic chlorophyll-carotenoid proteins. The LHCs include the chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins from green algae and land plants as well as the chlorophyll a/c-binding proteins from chromophytic algae and dinoflagellates that may bind different carotenoids like fucoxanthin (FCPs in diatoms, phaeophytes, and others) and peridinin (intrinsic PCPs, many dinoflagellates) (2Grossman A.R. Bhaya D. Apt K.E. Kehoe D.M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1995; 29: 231-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Red algae only have chlorophyll a and use phycobilisomes as the major photosystem II antenna. The chlorophyll a-binding complexes isolated from the thylakoids of these organisms are also related to the LHCs of other eukaryotes (3Wolfe G.R. Cunningham Jr., F.X. Durnford D. Green B.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 566-568Crossref Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 4Tan S. Ducret A. Aebersold R. Gantt E. Photosynth. Res. 1997; 53: 129-140Crossref Google Scholar). To avoid confusion we will use the term “LHC protein” for the light harvesting complexes in general, and “CAB protein” will refer to the chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins of green algae and higher plants. The major PSII-associated chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins (LHCII) from higher plants have three α-helical, membrane-spanning regions as demonstrated by crystal structure analysis by Kühlbrandt and co-workers (5Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1542) Google Scholar). The first and the third helices are held together by ion pairs to ensure a compact complex to bring the carotenoids and the chlorophylls in close contact. Some CABs form trimeric homocomplexes (6Butler P.J.G. Kühlbrandt W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 85: 3797-3801Crossref Google Scholar). All genes encoding LHCs that are known so far reside in the nucleus. In plants, an N-terminal targeting signal (“transit peptide”) allows the transport of the preproteins into the plastid stroma (7Cline K. Henry R. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) and is exchangeable with other stroma-targeting sequences from plants (8Lamppa G.K. Abad M.S. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2641-2648Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Targeting to the thylakoid membrane is accomplished by the mature protein itself. The third transmembrane domain is probably involved in targeting of CAB proteins to the thylakoids, whereas all three helices are needed for correct membrane insertion (9Auchincloss A.H. Alexander A. Kohorn B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10439-10446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CAB proteins are inserted into the thylakoid membrane in a reaction requiring GTP and stromal factors (10Hoffman N.E. Franklin A.E. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 295-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The integration process of the LHCs from land plants into thylakoid membranes involves binding to a chloroplast signal recognition particle (SRP), which consists of at least two proteins named cpSRP54 and cpSRP43, and to a further protein, FtsY (11Li X.

Johnson A.E. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 87-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). Overexpression and integration experiments in Escherichia coli show that integration does not depend on binding of chlorophylls and carotenoids to the LHC proteins (15Kohorn B.D. Auchincloss A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12048-12052Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Diatoms are representatives of the heterokont algae, which are assumed to have evolved by secondary endocytobiosis. This means that a eukaryotic host cell took up a photoautotrophic eukaryotic cell, probably an ancestor of modern red algae, followed by transformation of the endosymbiont into a plastid (16Delwiche C.F. Palmer J.D. Plant Syst. Evol. Suppl. 1997; 11: 53-86Crossref Google Scholar, 17Cavalier-Smith T. Trends Plant Sci. 2000; 5: 174-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 18Kroth P.G. Strotmann H. Physiol. Plant. 1999; 107: 136-141Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This process resulted in plastids having four bounding membranes. It has been demonstrated that protein import into these so-called complex plastids depends on a bipartite presequence and occurs in at least two steps (19Lang M. Apt K.E. Kroth P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30973-30978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Although diatoms and other heterokont algae represent an essential part of aquatic ecosystems, contributing significantly to the total oxygen and biomass production, little is known about the photosystems of these organisms. Recent genetic analyses of Fcp genes show that similar to genes encoding CAB proteins Fcp genes belong to a multigene family. Several different Fcp genes have already been found in diatoms, and it is likely that there are even more present (20Bhaya D. Grossman A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 46: 71-78Google Scholar, 21Eppard M. Krumbein W.E. von Haeseler A. Rhiel E. Plant Biol. 2000; 2: 283-289Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). So far there are no reports about functional aspects of FCPs with respect to integration into thylakoid membranes and cooperation with the diatom photosystems. Therefore, the characterization of integration characteristics of FCP proteins might reveal the history and the relationship of FCPs with other carotenoid-binding light-harvesting proteins. Here we present the first data on thylakoid membrane integration of a member of the FCP family using a respective protein from the diatom Odontella sinensis. We have established anin vitro thylakoid import assay from purified diatom plastids enabling the study of FCP integration. Our results suggest that FCPs are integrated mainly by an SRP-dependent integration mechanism as found for LHCs. Complementary integration experiments were performed using LHC and FCP proteins as well as thylakoid membranes from land plant and diatom plastids. The Fcp gene was derived from a cDNA library of the diatom O. sinensisinserted as EcoRI and XhoI fragments into the vector λ ZAPII (22Kroth-Pancic P.G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 825-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). For a more effective expression theFcp gene was cloned downstream of the SP6 promoter of the pSP73 vector (Promega) using the BamHI and KpnI sites. The Lhc gene (psAB80) from pea in pSP64 was kindly provided by Prof. Kenneth Cline (University of Florida) (23Cline K. Fulsom D.R. Viitanen P.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14225-14232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TheLhca1 gene (Lhca1 is the gene encoding chlorophyll a/b-binding protein of LHCI, type 1) from Arabidopsis thaliana in pGEM4 was a gift from Dr. Bernhard Grimm (IPK Gatersleben, Germany). Deletions of coding regions from Fcp were made by polymerase chain reaction using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All modifications were verified by double-strand sequencing using the T7 sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The deletion of the signal sequence resulting in the intermediate FCP form, iFCP (FCPΔ1–15 F16M), was achieved by amplifying the Fcp gene including the vector and theFcp gene but excluding the coding region for the signal sequence (primers 5′GCATCGATCATGGCCCCGGCTCAGTCC3′ and 5′CATGATCGATGCAGAGCCGGCGAGGAG3′). For intramolecular ligation of the polymerase chain reaction product aClaI restriction site was introduced by the primers (underlined). For constructing the mature form of the FCP, mFCP (FCPΔ1–29), the cloned Fcp gene was cut with the restriction enzymes StuI and SmaI. After intramolecular ligation, the remaining gene was transferred intoBamHI and KpnI sites of SP72 (Promega). All modified Fcp constructs were transcribed with SP6 RNA polymerase. Within the primer for the intermediate Fcp form (iFCP) a new start codon was included (bold letters). For expression of the mFCP translation product, the original ATG codon at position 31 was utilized. Chloroplasts from pea were isolated (19Lang M. Apt K.E. Kroth P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30973-30978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) from 8- to 12-day-old seedlings. Posttranslational import reactions, washing, and subfractionation of the plastids were performed as described. For protease treatment thermolysin (Fluka) was added to a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml together with 2 mmCaCl2. Thylakoids were isolated according to Ref. 24Kim S.J. Jansson S. Hoffman N.E.

The diatoms O. sinensis and Coscinodiscus granii were cultured as described (25Wittpoth C. Kroth P.G. Weyrauch K. Kowallik K.V. Strotmann H. Planta. 1998; 206: 79-85Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Plastids were isolated by gentle breakage of the cells in a Yeda press and subsequent separation of broken and intact plastids by centrifugation on a 40% Percoll cushion. Chlorophyll concentrations were determined as described (25Wittpoth C. Kroth P.G. Weyrauch K. Kowallik K.V. Strotmann H. Planta. 1998; 206: 79-85Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Isolated plastids were routinely checked for integrity by measuring oxygen evolution under illumination (25Wittpoth C. Kroth P.G. Weyrauch K. Kowallik K.V. Strotmann H. Planta. 1998; 206: 79-85Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). For thylakoid preparations the plastids were collected by a short centrifugation step (3,000 × g, 1 min) and incubated subsequently for 2 min in HM medium (50 mm HEPES, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2) to break the plastids osmotically (at a concentration of 1 mg of chlorophyll/ml). Just before recovering the thylakoids by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 1 min, 1 volume of H2SM buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8, 680 mm sorbitol, 5 mm MgCl2) was added. The resulting supernatant (stromal fraction) was kept on ice. The pelleted thylakoids were washed two or three times in HSM buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8, 340 mm sorbitol, 5 mm MgCl2) to remove remaining stromal contaminations (15,000 × g, 1 min) and were thoroughly resuspended in the stroma fraction or in HSM buffer at a concentration of 1 mg of chlorophyll/ml. EDTA-washed thylakoids were obtained by osmotic breakage of the plastids with HME buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8, 5 mm MgCl2, EDTA 10 mm) and washing of the thylakoids with HSME (HSM plus 10 mm EDTA). Protease-treated thylakoids were obtained by incubating osmotically broken thylakoids in HSMC buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 8, 340 mm sorbitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2) including the protease thermolysin at a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml for 15 or 30 min. The protease was inactivated by adding 2.5 mm EGTA and was removed by washing in a larger volume of HSME2 (HSME including 2.5 mm EGTA). Genes encoding LHC and FCP proteins were transcribed and translated in a coupled transcription/translation system (TNT System, Promega) as described in the manufacturer's introductions using [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The conditions for the thylakoid integration experiments with pea or diatom thylakoids were similar except for the different osmotic conditions. For import experiments 45 μl of thylakoids (0.5–1 mg of chlorophyll/ml) and 10 μl of translation reaction were used. To distinguish between Sec- or SRP-dependent integration, thylakoids were resuspended in the stromal fraction. Inhibitors for different import pathways were added as described. ATP and GTP were supplied at concentrations of 8 mm. The integration reactions were started by adding the translated protein and incubating the assays at 25 (pea thylakoids) or 16–18 °C (diatom thylakoids) for 25–30 min. Some samples were illuminated (150 μmol of photons/m2 s). The reactions were stopped by placing the samples on ice. All samples were divided into three parts. The first part was used directly for electrophoretic analysis and was taken as control (100%). The second and third parts were centrifuged, and the thylakoids were resuspended in HSM or HSMC, respectively, depending on optional further protease treatment. The conditions for protease treatment were identical as for the preparation of protease-treated thylakoids. All nonintegrated proteins were digested by thermolysin during an incubation on ice for 30 min. After deactivation of the protease with 2.5 mm EGTA, the thylakoids were collected and immediately prepared for the electrophoresis. The third part of the import assay was washed in different solutions to verify the integration of LHC/FCP proteins. According to Breytonet al. (26Breyton C. de Vitry C. Popot J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7597-7602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the thylakoids were incubated with five volumes of 2 m KSCN, 2 m NaCl, 6.8 m urea, or 85 mm Na2CO3/DTT, respectively, for 10 min at room temperature, were vortexed, and were subjected to two freeze/thaw cycles including additional vortexing. The washed thylakoids were recovered by a 10-min centrifugation (22,000 ×g). To test the stability of FCP integration, this washing procedure was done three times, whereas in standard experiments all samples were washed once with 2 m KSCN. Afterwards, the thylakoids were washed in 100 μl of HSM to remove the potassium ions before preparing the samples for electrophoresis. To check the membrane specificity of FCP integration, 3 μl of translation mixture and 10 μl HSM were added to 4 μl of microsomes. After incubation at 18 °C for 30 min, the samples were washed with 100 μl of 2 m KSCN as described above. Before recovering the membranes the samples were diluted to 3.5 ml with washing buffer. The microsomes were washed by centrifugation at 115,000 ×g for 45 min. Samples were denatured by adding sample buffer and incubation for 3 min at 90 °C and analyzed on 15% SDS-PAGE (27Fling S.P. Gregerson D.S. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 155: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (787) Google Scholar). For visualization of the radioactively labeled proteins, the gels were fixed in 30% ethanol, 10% acetic acid and soaked in Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) before drying. Fluorographic signals were detected utilizing Kodak X-Omat x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Quantifications were performed on a PhosphorImager (fluoro-imager BAS-1800, Fuji). For calculation of integration efficiency, the protein bands in the control sample were set to 100%. Different constructs were made from the diatom FCP precursor protein by deleting regions of the Fcp gene coding for different parts of the presequence (Fig. 1). iFCP was constructed by deleting the signal peptide domain necessary for cotranslational transport across the chloroplast ER (the outermost of the four diatom plastid-bounding membranes) and therefore represents the putative intermediate preprotein possessing a transit peptide domain only. The position of the new start codon was chosen on the basis of prediction of possible signal peptidase cleavage sites according to the “−3,−1” rule of von Heijne (28von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4890Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar) indicating a cleavage site at Ala15 and Phe16. mFCP represents the mature form as found within the plastids (20Bhaya D. Grossman A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 46: 71-78Google Scholar). To analyze the integration mode of FCPs into the thylakoid membranes from diatoms, we established an in vitro import assay for diatom thylakoids. Functionally and morphologically intact plastids were isolated from the marine centric diatoms O. sinensis andC. granii and purified by centrifugation through a Percoll cushion as described (25Wittpoth C. Kroth P.G. Weyrauch K. Kowallik K.V. Strotmann H. Planta. 1998; 206: 79-85Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), followed by osmotic rupture of the plastids. The integrity of the resulting thylakoids was analyzed by measuring electron transport capabilities (the isolated thylakoids were routinely checked and typically yielded ∼80 μmol of O2·mg chlorophyll−1·min−1in the presence of methyl viologen and ADP/Pi) and the stability of the light-induced proton gradient using the fluorophore 9-aminoacridine (29Schuldiner S. Rottenberg H. Avron M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 25: 64-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The ΔpH-dependent fluorescence quench was measured as described (30Kothen G. Schwarz O. Strotmann H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 208-214Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The thylakoid membranes were able to build up a stable proton gradient after illumination. This proton gradient was sensitive to low amounts of the uncoupler nigericin (data not shown). One important factor for the ability of the thylakoids to build up a stable pH gradient are the conditions used for osmotic breakage of the plastids. We found that osmotic rupture of the plastids is possible with low osmotic buffer for 1 min, but subsequently the thylakoids need to be replaced in a buffer containing at least 300 mm sorbitol to avoid swelling and increase of proton permeability. LHC proteins do not get proteolytically processed during or after membrane integration; therefore, integration cannot be visualized by a shift in molecular mass. Structural comparisons between LHCs and FCPs indicate that this might be similar in FCPs as there is obviously no cleavable presequence present for thylakoid targeting (21Eppard M. Krumbein W.E. von Haeseler A. Rhiel E. Plant Biol. 2000; 2: 283-289Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In this study we used varying stringent washing procedures of the membranes, and we compared the results with protease protection assays. These procedures were established to distinguish between loosely membrane-bound protein and membrane-integrated protein. To exclude the possibility that parts of the presequence needed for plastid import might be involved in the integration reaction, we analyzed integration of mFCP as well as of iFCP. Both precursor proteins show similar integration characteristics. According to Breyton et al. (26Breyton C. de Vitry C. Popot J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7597-7602Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) we checked different procedures for removing peripheral proteins from thylakoid membranes at conditions where no FCP integration should occur (no addition of stromal extract and GTP). Fig.2 A demonstrates that urea and KSCN have the best potential to elute loosely bound FCP protein from diatom thylakoid membranes after incubation for 10 min followed by harsh vortexing and freeze/thaw cycles. After addition of radiolabeled FCP protein to the thylakoids and subsequent incubation, they were treated as indicated. The amount of residual protein was determined by separating thylakoid membrane proteins by SDS-PAGE and subsequent quantitative analysis of the residual radioactivity of the FCP band using a PhosphorImager. Thylakoids that were washed with buffer only served as control (100%). First experiments were performed by incubation of thylakoids and radiolabeled FCP protein without addition of further substrates, allowing only minor integration of FCP. Subsequent washing of the membranes with 6.8 m urea, 2m KSCN, and 2 m NaCl, respectively, resulted in a residual amount of radiolabeled FCP protein of 7–18% (mFCP) of thylakoid-associated protein (Fig. 2 A). In contrast washing with 85 mm Na2CO3/DTT was not suitable to extract loosely bound proteins (77% residual protein). To improve the KSCN washing procedure, we tested the integration stability of mFCP by additional washing steps including vortexing and freeze/thaw cycles (Fig. 2 B). First washing of the membranes with 2m KSCN resulted in a remaining radioactivity of 27%, whereas during the following washing steps only a marginal further extraction of the membrane protein occurred. Repeated washing steps with urea, however, resulted in a nearly complete removal of FCP probably due to membrane disintegration by the harsh conditions. None of the washing procedures resulted in a clearly defined amount of residual membrane-bound protein under varying conditions. Based on our results repeated washing steps with 2 m KSCN were the best choice to remove most of unspecifically bound proteins and to allow reproducible results for analyzing the effectiveness of FCP integration in the following experiments. In addition to the washing steps the incorporation of the FCPs into thylakoid membranes was monitored by utilizing the protease thermolysin. It has been demonstrated that some of the CAB proteins from higher plants are protected against the proteases trypsin and thermolysin when integrated into the thylakoid membrane (24Kim S.J. Jansson S. Hoffman N.E. Robinson C. Mant A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4715-4721Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In our experiments a limited incubation of thylakoids following FCP integration assays (0.2 mg/ml thermolysin, 2 mmCaCl2) on ice for 20 min was sufficient to degrade peripheral and free FCP, while leaving integrated protein intact (data not shown). Therefore protease protection assays were used to verify the results obtained by washing with KSCN. Factors needed for FCP integration into diatom thylakoids were analyzed by incubation of mFCP and iFCP, respectively, from O. sinensis with diatom thylakoids under a variety of different experimental conditions. Both proteins indicated identical integration features as shown for mFCP (Fig. 3). Comparable results were also obtained with thylakoid preparations from both diatoms O. sinensis and C. granii. By using the washing procedure with 2 m KSCN as described above, we found a low amount of membrane-integrated FCPs when only thylakoids and radioactively labeled FCP proteins were incubated. A clear enhancement of FCP integration was obtained by addition of stromal extracts and GTP (8 mm) during incubation, after washing, or protease treatment. In this case an average of 2.5–3 times higher amounts of FCP remained in the thylakoid membranes. Variations of the concentration of GTP during incubation show a clear GTP dependence of FCP integration (Fig.4). A GTP concentration of about 12 mm turned out to be sufficient for maximum FCP integration. Thylakoid washing and protease treatment resulted in comparable results (Fig. 3).Figure 4GTP dependence of FCP integration.Integration of mFCP from Odontella into thylakoids fromCoscinodiscus was measured by incubating thylakoids with radiolabeled FCP protein, stromal extract, and GTP concentrations as indicated. Thylakoids were subsequently washed with 2 mKSCN and separated on a 15% SDS gel. The amount of radioactively labeled proteins within the bands was analyzed by a PhosphorImager. Values show percentage of radioactivity compared with the residual activity of the control reaction without washing steps. Standard deviations are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Different integration conditions were checked to exclude the possibility that other known protein integration pathways might also be involved in FCP integration. The Sec system is involved in the import reaction of the lumenal OEE33 protein (31Robinson C. Hynds P.J. Robinson D. Mant A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 209-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and depends on the presence of stromal factors and of ATP. Addition of stromal extract and/or ATP to the integration assay did not result in an obvious enhancement of FCP integration above the level obtained without additions, which would be expected if the Sec system would also be involved (Fig. 3). To make sure that the low level of FCP integration obtained without any additions was not due to the presence of ATP or stromal factors carried over with the thylakoid preparation, we added an inhibitor of the Sec pathway, sodium azide (5 mm), as well as the ATP-hydrolyzing enzyme apyrase. In both cases integration was comparable to experiments without any additions. In land plants lumenal proteins like OEE23 and OEE16 are transported into the thylakoids by a pH gradient (31Robinson C. Hynds P.J. Robinson D. Mant A. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 209-221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Apparently there is no additional ΔpH-depending FCP integration because performing FCP integration in the light or in the dark as well as the addition of nigericin, which abolishes transmembrane proton gradients, did not show obvious effects. The integration of the FCPs is not disturbed by the presence of the N-terminal presequence which is necessary for targeting of pre-FCP into the plastids in vivo. The full-length FCP precursor integrates into the thylakoid membrane as well as the intermediate iFCP or the mature form mFCP. This is consistent with investigations of the higher plant LHCs (32Yalovsky S. Néman E. Schuster G. Paulsen H. Harel E. Nechushtai R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20689-20693Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After repeated washing steps or protease treatment as described above, we always found a ce"

None of these mutants had an effect on the agonist-induced phosphorylation of the hLHR, however. We conclude that, in contrast to the prevailing view of the relative importance of receptor phosphorylation in the internalization of G protein-coupled receptors, the phosphorylation of the hLHR is less important than the agonist-induced activation of the hLHR in the process of internalization.

G protein-coupled receptor G protein-coupled receptor kinase follitropin receptor lutropin receptor thyrotropin receptor chorionic gonadotropin wild type β2-adrenergic receptor Internalization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 is a ubiquitous response that follows agonist activation (reviewed in Refs. 1Lefkowitz R.J.

Although several GPCR internalization pathways can now be recognized (3Bünemann M. Hosey M.M. J. Physiol. 1999; 517: 5-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), the most common and best understood pathway is dependent on the G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK)-catalyzed phosphorylation of GPCRs and the subsequent formation of a complex between the agonist-activated and phosphorylated GPCRs and a family of proteins known as the nonvisual arrestins or β-arrestins. The nonvisual arrestins (arrestin-2 and -3) target the activated and phosphorylated GPCRs to clathrin-coated pits by virtue of their ability to bind with high affinity to clathrin and to adaptor protein-2 (4Goodman J., O.B.

Barak L.S. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23120-23126Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Once localized to clathrin-coated pits, the GPCRs are internalized by a process that requires the participation of dynamin, a GTPase involved in the fission of clathrin-coated pits (6Warnock D. Schmid S. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The follitropin, lutropin and thyrotropin receptors (FSHR, LHR, and TSHR, respectively) are members of the rhodopsin/β2-adrenergic-like subfamily of GPCRs (7Bockaert J. Pin J.P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1723-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1233) Google Scholar, 8Gether U. Endocrine Rev. 2000; 21: 90-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). They form a small subfamily of GPCRs, collectively known as the glycoprotein hormone receptors, that is characterized by the presence of relatively large extracellular domains composed of leucine-rich repeats (9Segaloff D.L. Ascoli M. Endocrine Rev. 1993; 14: 324-347PubMed Google Scholar, 10Simoni M., J., G. Nieschlag E. Endocrine Rev. 1997; 18: 739-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 11Rapoport B.

Additional leucine-rich repeat-containing G protein-coupled receptors that are homologous to the glycoprotein hormone receptors have been recently identified in mammals and other organisms, but their ligands and functions are not yet known (reviewed in Ref. 12Hsu S.Y. Hsueh A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Like many other GPCRs, the binding of agonist to the LHR triggers the internalization of the agonist-receptor complex via clathrin-coated pits by a pathway that is dependent on receptor activation and phosphorylation and requires the participation of the nonvisual arrestins and dynamin (13Ascoli M.

Whereas the model derived from the large number of studies on the β2-adrenergic receptor emphasizes the importance of GPCR phosphorylation on the process of internalization (1Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar, 2Carman C.V. Benovic J.L. Curr. Opin.

Physiol. 1999; 517: 5-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), recent mutagenesis studies suggest that the agonist-induced activation and phosphorylation of the human (h) LHR may play redundant roles in the agonist-induced internalization of this receptor (17Min L. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1797-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Additional studies on the LHR, FSHR, and TSHR have also uncovered an unusual, but as yet unexplained, role for their extracellular domains on the rate of internalization and/or the fate of the internalized receptors (18Nakamura K. Liu X. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25426-25432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 19Baratti-Elbaz C. Chinea N. Lahuna O. Loosfelt H. Pichon C. Milgrom E. Mol.

The studies presented herein describe a novel set of mutations of the LHR (all located in the second extracellular loop) that enhance or impair receptor activation but do not affect agonist-induced phosphorylation. These mutations affect the rate of internalization of agonist in a manner that parallels their effects on receptor activation and thus highlight the importance of receptor activation, as opposed to phosphorylation, in the agonist-induced internalization of the LHR.

Human embryonic kidney (293) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CRL 1573) and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm Hepes, 10% newborn calf serum, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin, pH 7.4. Cells were plated in 100-mm dishes or 35-mm wells that had been coated with gelatin and transfected with 0.5–1 μg of plasmid/35-mm well or 10 μg of plasmid/100-mm dish when 70–80% confluent using the calcium phosphate method of Chen and Okayama (27Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). After an overnight incubation, the cells were washed and incubated for an additional 24 h prior to use. The methods used to measure the internalization of 125I-hCG have been described (18Nakamura K. Liu X. Ascoli M. J. Biol.

Single point assays were done using a 30-min incubation for cells expressing the rLHR or a 10-min incubation for cells expressing the hLHR. The results of these experiments are expressed as an internalization index that is defined as the ratio of internalized/surface-bound hormone. The length of the incubations was different because the half-time of internalization of125I-hCG mediated by the rLHR (∼120 min) is much slower than that mediated by the hLHR (∼20 min) and the internalization index is linear as a function of time for ∼60 min for the rLHR and for ∼30 min for the hLHR (18Nakamura K.

Determinations of the rates of internalization were done using at least five different data points collected at 3–10-min intervals after the addition of 125I-hCG (depending on the construct transfected).

The hCG binding properties of the different receptor constructs were ascertained using intact cells cotransfected with dynamin-K44A to prevent internalization (see “Results”). Binding was measured in the cotransfected cells that had been incubated with seven different concentrations of 125I-hCG for 1 h at room temperature. All binding assays were corrected for nonspecific binding, which was measured in the presence of 50 IU/ml partially purified hCG (3,000 IU/mg). The binding data were fitted to a sigmoidal equation (33De Lean A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E97-E102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using DeltaGraph® software (Delta Point, Monterey, CA) to calculate the maximal amount of cell-associated hormone and the concentration of hCG required to attain half of this value (apparentK d). Hormonal responsiveness was assessed by measuring cAMP accumulation in intact transfected cells plated in gelatin-coated 35-mm wells (see above). Total cAMP was measured at the end of a 2-h incubation (37 °C) with increasing concentrations of hCG as shown in Fig. 3 or with a single concentration of cholera toxin (0.6 nm) known to be maximally effective (17Min L. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1797-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The parameters that describe these dose responses (i.e. EC50 and maximal response) were calculated by fitting the data obtained to a sigmoidal equation (33De Lean A. Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Am. J. Physiol. 1978; 235: E97-E102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as described above. Cells were plated in 100-mm dishes that had been coated with gelatin and were transfected as described above. After an overnight incubation, the cells were washed, trypsinized, and plated in gelatin-coated 100-mm dishes and in gelatin-coated 35-mm wells and incubated overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 mm Hepes, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin, pH 7.4. The cells plated in 35-mm wells were used to assess cell surface receptor expression by measuring the binding of a single, saturating concentration of125I-hCG during a 1-h incubation at room temperature as described above. The cells plated in the 100-mm dishes were lysed, and the crude lysates were immunoprecipitated and analyzed as described recently (17Min L. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1797-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS gels, the gels were visualized and quantitated using a PhosphorImager and the images were captured in a digital format for presentation. Purified hCG (CR-127, ∼13,000 IU/mg) was kindly provided by Dr. Al Parlow and the National Hormone and Pituitary Agency of the NIDDK, National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD). 125I-hCG was prepared as described elsewhere (34Ascoli M. Puett D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 99-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Partially purified hCG (∼3,000 IU/mg) was purchased from Sigma, and it was used only for the determination of nonspecific binding (see above). 125I-cAMP and cell culture medium were obtained from the Iodination Core and the Media and Cell Production Core, respectively, of the Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center of the University of Iowa. Other cell culture supplies and reagents were obtained from Corning and Life Technologies, Inc., respectively. All other chemicals were obtained from commonly used suppliers. Our interest on a potential role of the second extracellular loop of the LHR in the rate of internalization of hCG arose from two sets of studies. First, a recent analysis (35Kishi M. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 926-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) of a truncation of the rLHR (at residue 653 in the C-terminal tail) that was initially reported to impair the internalization of hCG revealed that the decrease in internalization was due to an additional mutation (V497A in the second extracellular loop) that was inadvertently introduced (and went unnoticed) during the construction of the original C-terminally truncated mutant. Second, other investigators have documented the potential involvement of this loop in modulation the hCG binding affinity and signaling properties of the rLHR (36Ryu K., H., L. Kim S. Beauchamp J. Tung C.S. Isaacs N.W. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6285-6291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Alanine scanning mutagenesis of each of the 20 residues present in the second extracellular loop of the rLHR confirmed that the V497A mutation decreases the internalization of hCG in the context of the full-length receptor and showed that the mutation of many other residues present in this loop also enhance or decrease internalization (Fig. 1,right panel). Four mutants of this receptor region (Y486A, I491A, C492A, and P494A) could not be analyzed for internalization because the binding of125I-hCG to cells transfected with these plasmids was very low or undetectable (these are marked with asterisks in Fig.1). The reduced or undetectable expression of the I491A, C492A, and P494A mutants is in agreement with the previous study cited above (36Ryu K., H., L. Kim S. Beauchamp J. Tung C.S. Isaacs N.W. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6285-6291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) involving alanine scanning mutagenesis of this region. We disagree on the expression of the S484A mutant, however. Ryu and co-workers (36Ryu K., H., L. Kim S. Beauchamp J. Tung C.S. Isaacs N.W. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6285-6291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) reported that cells expressing the S484A mutant had no detectable125I-hCG binding. In our experiments, however, the expression of this mutant was normal. Since the transient expression of the human (h) LHR is much more robust than that of the rLHR (16Nakamura K. Liu X. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 241-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17Min L. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1797-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and the rate of internalization of hCG mediated by the hLHR is faster than that mediated by the rLHR (16Nakamura K. Liu X. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 241-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), we reasoned that using the hLHR to examine the potential effect of mutations of the second extracellular loop may facilitate detection of changes in the rate of internalization and it would be a more amenable model system to examine these effects in more detail. The results of alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the second extracellular loop residues of the hLHR are shown in Fig. 1, left panel. 2Note that the amino acid sequences of the second extracellular loops of the rLHR and the hLHR are identical except for two residues (Leu493 and Ser499 in the rLHR are replaced by Phe515 and Thr521 in the hLHR). Additionally, note that the different numbers assigned to equivalent residues is artificially caused by differences in the numbering of amino acids. Since the N terminus of the mature hLHR is not known, residue number 1 is taken to the be the methionine present at the N terminus of the signal peptide. In contrast, since the N terminus of the mature rLHR is known, this residue (which corresponds to residue 23 of the hLHR) is taken to be residue number 1. Only one mutant of the hLHR (C514A, marked with an asterisk in Fig. 1 was not properly expressed and could not be analyzed for internalization. Alanine scanning of the remaining 19 residues, showed that only one residue (Glu520) had no effect on internalization. Of the remaining 18 residues, the mutation of 12 residues resulted in an increase in internalization and the mutation of 6 residues resulted in a decrease in internalization. Based on these results we chose two mutants that enhanced internalization and two that decreased internalization of the hLHR (see arrows in the left panelof Fig. 1) for more detailed studies. We first considered the possibility that the mutants in question were internalized by pathways that do not require the participation of the visual arrestins and/or dynamin. This was tested by measuring the rates of internalization of hCG in cells cotransfected with arrestin-3-(284–409), a dominant-negative mutant of the nonvisual arrestins (23Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32507-32512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), or with dynamin-K44A, a dominant-negative mutant of dynamin (24Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). These constructs have been previously shown to slow thet 12 of internalization of hCG mediated by the hLHR-wt (16Nakamura K. Liu X. Ascoli M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 241-247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17Min L. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1797-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As shown in Table I, dynamin-K44A was an effective inhibitor of the internalization of hCG mediated by the hLHR-wt and the four mutants tested. In contrast, arrestin-3-(284–409) inhibited the internalization of the hLHR-wt and the two mutants with a fast t 12 of internalization (F515A and T521A) but had little or no effect on the two mutants with a slow t 12 of internalization (S512A and V519A). Thus, it appears that the slow mutants internalize hCG by a pathway that is still dependent on dynamin but independent of the nonvisual arrestins. The data presented in Table I also show, however, that the slow rate of internalization of hCG mediated by these mutants can be rescued by overexpression of arrestin-3.Table IHalf-times of internalization of hCG mediated by the hLHR-wt, and mutants thereofReceptort1/2 of internalizationpcDNA3.1Arrestin-3(284–409)Dynamin-K44AArrestin-3minwt24 ± 167 ± 2 bp < 0.05 when compared to cells co-transfected with the same receptor plasmid and pcDNA 3.1.201 ± 17bp < 0.05 when compared to cells co-transfected with the same receptor plasmid and pcDNA 3.1.3 ± 1bp < 0.05 when compared to cells co-transfected with the same receptor plasmid and pcDNA 3.1.S512A163 ± 17ap < 0.05 when compared to cells co-transfected with hLHR-wt and pcDNA 3.1.169 ± 15272 ± 34bp < 0.05 when compared to cells co-transfected with the same receptor plasmid and pcDNA 3.1.29 ± 6bp < 0.05 when compared to cells co-transfected with the same receptor plasmid and pcDNA 3.1.F515A10 ± 3ap < 0.05 when compared to cells co-transfected with hLHR-wt and pcDNA 3.1.55 ± 2bp < 0.05 when compared to cells co-transfected with the same receptor plasmid and pcDNA 3.1.146 ± 10bp < 0.05 when compared to cells co-transfected with the same receptor plasmid and pcDNA 3.1.3 ± 1bp < 0.05 when compared to cells co-transfected with the same receptor plasmid and pcDNA 3.1.V519A118 ± 8ap < 0.05 when compared to cells co-transfected with hLHR-wt and pcDNA 3.1.117 ± 17235 ± 17bp < 0.05 when compared to cells co-transfected with the same receptor plasmid and pcDNA 3.1.24 ± 3bp < 0.05 when compared to cells co-transfected with the same receptor plasmid and pcDNA 3.1.T521A12 ± 1ap < 0.05 when compared to cells co-transfected with hLHR-wt and pcDNA 3.1.57 ± 8bp < 0.05 when compared to cells co-transfected with the same receptor plasmid and pcDNA 3.1.247 ± 27bp < 0.05 when compared to cells co-transfected with the same receptor plasmid and pcDNA 3.1.4 ± 1bp < 0.05 when compared to cells co-transfected with the same receptor plasmid and pcDNA 3.1.293 cells were transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of each of the indicated constructs and the t 1/2 of internalization of 125I-hCG was measured as described under “Materials and Methods.” The amount of arrestin-3, arrestin-3-(384–409), and dynamin K44A constructs transfected were chosen based on their maximal effects on internalization.

Since the agonist-induced phosphorylation of the hLHR is also important to the process of internalization (17Min L. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1797-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) we measured the phosphorylation of the four receptor mutants in cells incubated with or without hCG. These results are presented in Fig. 2 and show that the four mutations in question had little or no effect on basal or agonist-induced phosphorylation. The ability of the four extracellular loop mutants to bind hCG and to transduce the signal into cAMP accumulation were next measured. The results of the binding assays are presented in TableII and show that none of the mutants affected receptor expression at the cell surface. The apparentK d for hCG binding to cells expressing one of the mutants, S512A, was higher than that of cells expressing hLHR-wt, however. These data are somewhat different than those reported for mutations of the rLHR (36Ryu K., H., L. Kim S. Beauchamp J. Tung C.S. Isaacs N.W. Ji I. Ji T.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6285-6291Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the rLHR, mutations equivalent to S512A and T521A were reported to reduce the K d for hCG binding whereas mutations equivalent to F515A and V519A were reported to have no effect on hCG binding affinity.Table IIBinding of hCG to cells expressing the hLHR or mutants thereofReceptorApparentK dMaximal bindingnmmolecules/cellwt2.2 ± 0.6188,000 ± 16,000S512A8.5 ± 2.3aStatistically different (p < 0.05) from hLHR-wt.172,000 ± 31,000F515A4.3 ± 1.5188,000 ± 32,000V519A1.1 ± 0.2141,000 ± 16,000T521A1.2 ± 0.2188,000 ± 47,000293 cells were transiently transfected with 0.5 μg of each of the indicated constructs and dynamin K44A as described under “Materials and Methods” and in the legend to Table I.

A representative experiment documenting the ability of cells expressing each of these four mutants to respond to hCG with increases in cAMP accumulation is shown in Fig. 3 and a summary of several experiments is presented in TableIII. As pointed out before (17Min L. Ascoli M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1797-1810Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), there is some inherent variability associated with measuring the cAMP responses of transiently transfected cells and we attempted to correct for it by normalizing the basal and hCG-induced cAMP responses mediated by the different mutants to the cholera toxin-induced cAMP response measured in the same cells (see columns labeled basal/cholera toxin and hCG/cholera toxin in Table III). Thus, instead of using the absolute levels of cAMP, the responsiveness of cells expressing the different mutants shown in Table III is best compared by using these ratios.Table IIICyclic AMP responses of cells expressing the hLHR or mutant thereofReceptorBasal cAMPhCG-induced responseMaximal cholera toxin-induced responseResponse ratioEC50MaximalBasal/cholera toxinhCG/cholera toxinpmol/106 cellspmpmol cAMP/106 cellspmol cAMP/106 cellswt33 ± 5104 ± 2695 ± 53189 ± 320.18 ± 0.043.57 ± 0.29S512A30 ± 5312 ± 23aStatistically different (p < 0.05) from hLHR-wt.655 ± 96174 ± 80.17 ± 0.033.38 ± 0.67F515A37 ± 470 ± 5aStatistically different (p < 0.05) from hLHR-wt.483 ± 56212 ± 240.17 ± 0.022.21 ± 0.02aStatistically different (p < 0.05) from hLHR-wt.V519A30 ± 5278 ± 18 aStatistically different (p < 0.05) from hLHR-wt.735 ± 107191 ± 90.16 ± 0.033.37 ± 0.28T521A38 ± 770 ± 2a"

Unlike most cyclin-dependent kinase complexes, which are composed of a catalytic and a regulatory subunit, the yeast CTD kinase I complex contains three specific subunits: a kinase subunit (Ctk1), a cyclin subunit (Ctk2), and a third subunit (Ctk3) of unknown function that does not exhibit any similarity to known proteins. Like the Ctk2 cyclin that is regulated at the level of protein turnover, Ctk3 is an unstable protein processed through a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Interestingly, Ctk2 and Ctk3 physical interaction is required to protect both subunits from degradation, pointing to a new mechanism for cyclin turnover regulation. We also show that Ctk2 and Ctk3 can each interact independently with the kinase. However, despite the formation of CDK/cyclin complexes in vitro, the Ctk2 cyclin is unable to activate its CDK: both Ctk2 and Ctk3 are required for Ctk1 CTD kinase activation. The different specific features governing CTDK-I regulation probably reflect requirement for the transcriptional response to multiple growth conditions.

C-terminal domain cyclin-dependent kinase cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor hemagglutinin polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis glutathioneS-transferase polymerase chain reaction base pair(s) The C-terminal domain (CTD)1 of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II contains a repeated heptapeptide that is highly phosphorylated in a portion of the molecules in the cell. This domain plays an essential role in the control of mRNA synthesis, as well as RNA processing, and its phosphorylation is a key feature of its function (1Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19009-19012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). The formation of initiation complexes on promoter DNA involves RNA polymerase II molecules with unphosphorylated CTD, whereas the CTD becomes phosphorylated during or after the transition to elongation. Three CTD kinases are involved in the regulation of RNA polymerase II transcription in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, all being cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). The first yeast CTD kinase, Kin28 (2Valay J.-G. Simon M. Dubois M.-F. Bensaude O. Facca C. Faye G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 249: 535-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), is associated with cyclin Ccl1 (3Valay J.-G. Dubois M.-F. Bensaude O. Faye G. C. R. Acad. Sci.

Kin28 is an essential kinase that has been shown to phosphorylate the CTD only after the RNA polymerase II is associated with promoter DNA, thus promoting the elongation mode (8Hengartner C.J.

The second yeast CDK implicated in CTD phosphorylation, the nonessential Srb10/Ume5/Ssn3 kinase and its cyclin partner Srb11/Ume3/Ssn8, is a component of the holoenzyme (10Liao S.-M. Zhang J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 27823-27828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) reported that deletion of theCTK1 gene results in an increase in phosphorylation of serine in position 5 of the CTD repeat, indicating that CTDK-I negatively regulates CTD Ser5 phosphorylation.CTK1 deletion also eliminates the transient increase in CTD serine 2 phosphorylation observed during the diauxic shift, this latter defect being correlated with a defect in transcriptional induction during the diauxic shift, suggesting a role for CTDK-I in response to nutrient depletion. In humans, the closest kinase to Ctk1 is Cdk9 (for review, see Ref. 22Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2629-2634Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), a CTD kinase that was first described as a positive transcription elongation factor (23Marshall N.F. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12335-12338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar), and that interacts specifically with the human immunodeficiency virus-1 transactivator protein Tat, which acts to enhance the processivity of RNA polymerase II (24Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2622-2632Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar, 25Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.-M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell. 1998; 92: 451-462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1050) Google Scholar). How are these CTD kinases regulated? CDKs were first described as central regulators of the major transitions of the eukaryotic cell division cycle. Their activity is determined by cyclin binding, by both positive and negative regulatory phosphorylation and by CDK inhibitors (CKIs) (26Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar, 27Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1801) Google Scholar). An important aspect of CDK regulation is the rapid destruction of their cyclin partners (28King R.W. Deshaies R.J. Peters J.-M. Kirschner M.W. Science. 1996; 274: 1652-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1117) Google Scholar). Several studies both in yeast and in mammals have demonstrated that cell cycle cyclins are selectively degraded by ubiquitin-dependent proteasome pathways (29Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1899) Google Scholar, 30Deshaies R.J. Chau V. Kirschner M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 303-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 31Seufert W. Futcher B. Jentsch S. Nature. 1995; 373: 78-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 32Willems A.R. Lanker S. Patton E.E. Craig K.L. Nason T.F. Mathias N. Kobayashi R. Wittenberg C. Tyers M. Cell. 1996; 86: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Although exceptions have been described (33Pickart C.M. FASEB. J. 1997; 11: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 34Sheaff R.J. Singer J.D. Swanger J. Smitherman M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 403-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), proteasome substrates are usually marked for degradation by conjugation with several molecules of ubiquitin, a highly conserved 76-amino acid-long polypeptide (33Pickart C.M. FASEB. J. 1997; 11: 1055-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 35Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). The 26 S proteasome is a nuclear and cytosolic multicatalytic proteinase that breaks down targeted substrates to short peptides and recycles the ubiquitin molecules (36Hilt W. Wolf D.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 96-102Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). CDKs involved in transcriptional control are activated by C-type cyclins that constitute a divergent group of cyclins (37Léopold P. O'Farrell P.H. Cell. 1991; 66: 1207-1216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 38Lew D.J. Dulic V. Reed S.I. Cell. 1991; 66: 1197-1206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). C-type cyclins exhibit sequence conservation for the cyclin box,i.e. the kinase binding domain (39Kobayashi H. Stewart E. Poon R. Adamczewski J.P. Gannon J. Hunt T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1279-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 40Lees E.M. Harlow E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1194-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), but their expression does not seem to fluctuate during the cell cycle (41Molz L. Beach D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1723-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 42Cooper K.F. Mallory M.J. Smith J.B. Strich R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4665-4675Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), and little is known about their regulation. Cdk8·cyclin C phosphorylates cyclin H, resulting in down-regulation of TFIIH activities (43Akoulitchev S. Chuikov S. Reinberg D. Nature. 2000; 407: 102-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In yeast, it has been shown that the C-type cyclin Srb11/Ume3 is regulated at the level of its turnover. Srb11/Ume3 is destroyed by multiple and independent pathways when cultures are subjected to diverse stresses (42Cooper K.F. Mallory M.J. Smith J.B. Strich R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4665-4675Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 44Cooper K.F. Mallory M.J. Strich R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3338-3348Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We previously showed that the Ctk2 cyclin subunit is phosphorylated and rapidly degraded, in a growth-related fashion, by a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (45Hautbergue G. Goguel V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2527-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Interestingly, unlike what has been described for the G1cyclins, neither Ctk2 phosphorylation nor its destruction require its activated kinase. CDK complexes are minimally composed of a catalytic and a regulatory subunit. The vertebrate TFIIH kinase contains an additional component, Mat1, that exhibits a zinc-binding motif typical of C3HC4 RING finger domains likely to mediate protein·protein interactions (46Freemont P.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 684: 174-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Mat1 functions as an assembly factor, promoting a stable interaction between the Cdk7 kinase and the cyclin H that does not require Cdk7-activating phosphorylation (47Devault A. Martinez A.M. Fesquet D. Labbe J.C. Morin N. Tassan J.P. Nigg E.A. Cavadore J.C. Doree M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5027-5036Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 48Fisher R.P. Jin P. Chamberlin H.M. Morgan D.O.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5608-5617Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Also, association with Mat1 and core TFIIH modulates the activity of Cdk7 at the level of substrate specificity (50Yankulov K.Y. Bentley D.L. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1638-1646Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Although the yeast TFIIH complex contains Tfb3 that is 32.5% identical to Mat1 (51Faye G. Simon M. Valay J.-G. Fesquet D. Facca C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 52Feaver W.J. Henry N.L. Wang Z. Wu X. Svejstrup J.Q. Bushnell D.A. Friedberg E.C. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19319-19327Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), a Kin28·Ccl1·Tfb3 complex has never been identified (53Svejstrup J.Q. Feaver W.J. Kornberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 643-645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). However, Tfb3 has been implicated in transcription (51Faye G. Simon M. Valay J.-G. Fesquet D. Facca C. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1997; 255: 460-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and conditional alleles of TFB3 are severely defective in Kin28T132A kinase activity, suggesting that it might be the Mat1 ortholog (54Kimmelman J. Kaldis P. Hengartner C.J. Laff G.M. Koh S.S. Young R.A. Solomon M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4774-4787Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The function of the third component of the CTDK-I complex is unknown. The fact that deletion of each individual CTK gene generates cold-sensitive cells that display similar growth defects (19Sterner D.E. Moon Lee J. Hardin S.E. Greenleaf A.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5716-5724Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), suggests that Ctk3 is essential for the function of the complex. We studied Ctk3 expression in vivo, and we show that it is regulated at the protein level. Ctk3 contains a PEST motif involved in its degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Furthermore, binding of Ctk3 to the cyclin subunit is required for stabilization of both subunits. Ctk3 can directly interact with the kinase and is required, in addition to the cyclin, for its activation. It thus appears that, in contrast to other CDKs, the Ctk1 kinase is in fact regulated by a heterodimer composed of two unstable subunits. The yeast strains used in this study were WCG4a (MATaura3 leu2-3,112 his3-11, 15) and its isogenic pre1-1 pre2-2 derivative WCG4-11/22a constructed by Richter-Ruoffet al. (55Richter-Ruoff B. Wolf D.H. Hochstrasser M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 354: 50-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The Δctk strains (MATα ade2-1 can1-100 his3-11, 15 leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 ura 3-1,ctk::TRP1) are described in work by Hautbergue and Goguel (45Hautbergue G. Goguel V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2527-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Yeast cultures were grown at 30 °C to anA 600 of 0.8, unless otherwise stated, in SD medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco) supplemented with appropriate nutrients for auxotrophy and 2% glucose as a carbon source. For induction of the CUP1promoter, CuSO4 was added at 0.1 mm overnight. When indicated, cycloheximide (Sigma) was added to 100 μg/ml. Yeast transformations were performed by the LiCl method (56Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kumura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For Ctk2 overexpression, the pFL44-CTK2 plasmid was used (URA3 2 μm) (45Hautbergue G. Goguel V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2527-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). All the constructs were made via several PCR cloning steps. Briefly, 500-bp PCR fragments containing either the CTK1 or the CTK3 promoter were cloned into pFL36 (LEU2 CEN) (57Bonneaud N. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Li G. Labouesse M. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Lacroute F. Yeast. 1991; 7: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The different coding sequences were cloned downstream of sequences encoding two HAinfluenza virus hemagglutinin tags or a single c-Myc epitope tag prior to cloning downstream of their cognate promoter, yielding to the final constructs CTK1-HA, CTK1-Myc, CTK3-HA, and CTK3-Myc. The CTK2-HA construct (URA3 CEN) is described in Hautbergue and Goguel (45Hautbergue G. Goguel V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2527-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The Myc-tagged CTK2 coding sequence was inserted into pFL38-PrCTK2 (45Hautbergue G. Goguel V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2527-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), yielding the CTK2-Myc construct. The CTK3ΔPEST construct is identical to the wild type CTK3 construct except that 13 amino acids (see Fig. 1) are replaced by a leucine. CTK3ΔC50 contains a STOP codon in position 247 of the Ctk3 protein. The +C50 construct encodes a 100-amino acid peptide composed of 25 amino acids encoding two HA-tags/Ctk3 24 N-terminal amino acids/one leucine/Ctk3 50 C-terminal amino acids. All constructs containing PCR fragments were sequenced (the Ctk3ΔPEST and Myc-Ctk1 proteins each contain a single mutation, His58 → Leu and Pro35 → Leu, respectively). For expression of the Ctk proteins from the T7 promoter, the different epitope-tagged coding sequences were cloned either into the pRSET5d vector (58Schoepfer R. Gene. 1993; 124: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) or the pET14b (Novagen) to express the (His)6-HA tagged Ctk1 protein. The plasmid pMT1089 (TRP1 2 μm) encodes a (His)6-Myc-tagged ubiquitin under the control of the copper-inducible CUP1 promoter (32Willems A.R. Lanker S. Patton E.E. Craig K.L. Nason T.F. Mathias N. Kobayashi R. Wittenberg C. Tyers M. Cell. 1996; 86: 453-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from 15 ml of cells by hot acid-phenol treatment as described (59Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar). 30 μg were separated on a 1% agarose gel containing 6% formaldehyde, blotted to a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and rRNA was quantified by methylene blue staining. Hybridization to a PCR fragment containing the CTK3 coding sequence labeled with [α-32P]dATP by random priming (Appligene) was performed under standard methods. Proteins were extracted in trichloroacetic acid by mechanical lysis with glass beads and analyzed by Western immunoblotting as previously described (45Hautbergue G. Goguel V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2527-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Buffers described previously by Willems et al. (63Lanker S. Valdivieso M.H. Wittenberg C. Science. 1996; 271: 1597-1601Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) were supplemented with 15% (v/v) glycerol. Yeast pellets from 1.5 liters of cultures, with or without induction of the CUP1 promoter, were resuspended in G buffer and subjected to cellular lysis in an Eaton press. After ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h, total ubiquitinated species from 10 mg of yeast proteins were loaded onto 50-μl nickel columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) packed into micro-tips with G buffer. After elution, ubiquitinated species were analyzed by Western immunoblotting. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) were cotransformed with the pLysS vector (Novagen) and the plasmid coding for the protein of interest. Typically, cells were grown to an A 600 of 0.4 in 100 ml of LB medium. Expression of the T7 polymerase was then induced for 3 h with 250 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cell pellets were resuspended in 2 ml of BB100 (25 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 15% (v/v) glycerol) containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell disruption was completed by sonication. After ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g, levels of tagged proteins from the extracts were estimated by Western blot analyses. Immunoprecipitations from yeast extracts were performed as described previously (45Hautbergue G. Goguel V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2527-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins extracted with glass beads from 10 ml of cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with polyclonal antibody HA.11 (1/125, Babco) and protein G-immobilized on Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitations from bacterial or wheat germ extracts were performed in the BB100 buffer described above. Bacterial extract containing Myc-Ctk3 and HA-Ctk2 synthesized with [35S]methionine in coupled transcription/translation wheat germ extract (Promega) were mixed overnight at 10 °C. Immunoprecipitations were performed with HA-12CA5 antibody coupled to 20 μl of magnetic beads according to the manufacturer (Dynal). After a 2-h incubation on a wheel, proteins were eluted with Laemmli buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE prior to Western immunoblotting. 50 ml of yeast cells transformed with the CTK3-HA construct were grown in SD medium to anA 600 of 0.4. Cell labeling was achieved for 10 min at 30 °C with 1 mCi of Pro-Mix [35S]methionine/cysteine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After different times of chase by addition of 10× chase medium (10 mm methionine, 2 mm cysteine, 4% yeast extract, 25% glucose), 10-ml aliquots were added to 60 μl of STOP solution (0.5 m sodium azide, 0.5 m sodium fluoride) and centrifuged. Pellets were washed with water prior to freezing in liquid nitrogen. Protein extracts and immunoprecipitations were made following the in vivoimmunoprecipitation procedure described above. Totality of eluted proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE before analysis by autoradiography. Equal amounts of different bacterial extracts each containing a tagged protein were mixed and incubated for an hour at 15 °C. 15 μg of purified monoclonal HA-12CA5 antibodies were coupled overnight at 10 °C to 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads in phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 0.1% to 0.5% bovine serum albumin and 10% (v/v) glycerol. Typically, 30 μl of HA-coupled beads were packed into micro-tips. After equilibration with BB100 buffer, the different mixes of proteins were loaded three times consecutively on these mini-columns with one wash in between each. Native elutions of immunopurified complexes were performed in batch with 50 μl of BB100 buffer supplemented with 0.1 μg/μl HA peptide for 20 min at 37 °C. Extracts were either analyzed by SDS-PAGE or Western immunoblotting after addition of Laemmli buffer. Bacterial extracts containing HA-Ctk2 and Myc-Ctk3, respectively, were mixed and immunopurified on an HA mini-column as described above. 5 μl of bacterial extracts containing either HA-Ctk2 or Myc-Ctk3, or 50 μl of Ctk2·Ctk3 immunopurified complex, were applied on Superdex 75 PC 3.2/30 columns (SMART system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The flow rate during the chromatography was 40 μl/min of BB100 buffer, and at 0.95 ml of elution, 30-μl fractions were collected and analyzed by Western Immunoblotting. Purification of high amounts of Ctk complexes was performed by ion exchange and affinity chromatographies on a fast protein liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bacterial extract from 500 ml of cells expressing (His)6-HA-Ctk1 was loaded onto a 2-ml Bio-Rex 70 column (Bio-Rad) with PCα(100) buffer (25 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 15% glycerol; supplemented with 100 mm potassium acetate). After 5 column-volumes of washing, an excess of recombinant HA-Ctk2, HA-Ctk3, or HA-Ctk2+HA-Ctk3 extracts, were loaded on the column. After washing with 10 column-volumes of PCα(100) buffer, proteins eluted with a linear gradient (20 column-volumes) from 0.1 to 2 mpotassium acetate. Fractions containing Ctk proteins were determined by Western immunoblotting with HA antibodies, pooled, and loaded onto 1-ml Hi-TRAP/Ni2+ columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with PCα(650) buffer. After 5 column-volumes of washing with PCα(650) buffer, a linear gradient (5 column-volumes) from 650 to 100 mm potassium acetate was performed, and washing was achieved with 5 column-volumes of PCα(100) buffer. Proteins were eluted by step with BB100 buffer without dithiothreitol, supplemented with 0.3 m imidazole. Extracts from High5 cells (Invitrogen) infected with baculoviruses expressing the GST-CTD fusion protein (a gift from J. Acker) were treated with the PP2A phosphatase prior to inhibition with okadaic acid and loaded onto a Hi-TRAP/glutathione column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). GST-CTD elution was achieved by competition with 20 mm reduced glutathione in BB100 buffer. Activities from 40 μl of each purified complex (fraction 7, Fig. 7 C), or Ctk1 alone, were assayed by incubation of 2 μg of GST-CTD with 3 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in BB100 buffer. Enzymatic reactions took place for 1 h at 25 °C, before concentration on Strataclean beads (Stratagene) and further elution with Laemmli buffer. The totality of the eluted proteins was separated by SDS-PAGE before analysis by autoradiography. The subunits of the yeast CTDK-I complex are encoded by three genes: CTK1, encoding a cyclin-dependent kinase subunit; CTK2, encoding a C-type cyclin subunit; and CTK3, encoding a 296-amino acid subunit of unknown function. We have previously shown that Ctk2 is processed through a ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (45Hautbergue G. Goguel V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2527-2534Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). To analyze Ctk3 expression in vivo, its coding sequence was cloned on a single-copy plasmid under the control of its own promoter. The protein was fused at its N-terminal to either a c-Myc or two-HA epitope tags. The resulting constructs, CTK3-Myc and CTK3-HA, allowed expression of functional proteins, because each could restoreΔctk3 cell growth at the nonpermissive temperature (data not shown). Western blot analyses ofΔctk3 cell extracts expressing the Myc-tagged Ctk3 protein revealed a specific band of the expected size (Fig.1 A, lane 0′). To analyze Ctk3 stability, cycloheximide was added to cultures grown to anA 600 of 0.8 at 30 °C to block cytoplasmic protein synthesis, and Ctk3 level was monitored by immunodetection at various times after cycloheximide addition (Fig. 1 A). The half-life of Ctk3 was found to be relatively short (half-life, 30 min). Identical results were observed with the CTK3-HA construct (Fig.1 B). Because cycloheximide treatment might cause a stress affecting Ctk3 stability, we also performed a pulse-chase experiment. Cells were labeled with a [35S]methionine/cysteine mix for 10 min prior to HA-Ctk3 immunoprecipitation after different times of chase. We observed a decrease in Ctk3 levels similar to that observed after cycloheximide addition (Fig. 1 C). We conclude that, like the Ctk2 cyclin subunit, Ctk3 is an unstable protein in exponentially growing cells. A number of proteins with a fast turnover contain PEST sequences (60Rechsteiner M. Rogers S.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 267-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1405) Google Scholar). PEST regions are enriched in proline, glutamate, serine, threonine, and aspartate, these regions being uninterrupted by positively charged residues an"
https://openalex.org/W2079317055,"The T4 endoribonuclease RegB is involved in the inactivation of the phage early messengers. It cuts specifically in the middle of GGAG sequences found in early messenger intergenic regions but not GGAG sequences located in coding sequences or in late messengers. In vitro RegB activity is very low but is enhanced by a factor up to 100 by the ribosomal protein S1. In the absence of clear sequence motif distinguishing substrate and non-substrate GGAG-containing RNAs, we postulated the existence of a structural determinant. To test this hypothesis, we correlated the structure, probed by NMR spectroscopy, with the cleavage propensity of short RNA molecules derived from an artificial substrate. A kinetic analysis of the cleavage was performed in the presence and absence of S1. In the absence of S1, RegB efficiently hydrolyses substrates in which the last G of the GGAG motif is located in a short stem between two loops. Both strengthening and weakening of this structure strongly decrease the cleavage rate, indicating that this structure constitutes a positive cleavage determinant. Based on our results and those of others, we speculate that S1 favors the formation of the structure recognized by RegB and can thus be considered a “presentation protein.” The T4 endoribonuclease RegB is involved in the inactivation of the phage early messengers.

The expression of a gene depends strongly on its messenger concentration, which in turn is determined by the transcription efficiency, but also by the mRNA decay rate. Messengers, indeed, may have very different degradation susceptibilities. The half-lives of Escherichia colimRNAs, for example, range between 0.5 and 20 min and may change in response to various factors (1Coburn G.A. Mackie G.A. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1999; 62: 55-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). This could be very important for short-lived messengers, in particular, since small variations of their half-lives will temporarily induce very strong modifications in their abundance (2Ross J. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 171-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The factors controlling mRNA half-lives are far from being completely understood and are certainly different in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. In the former, in particular, the coupling of transcription and translation events together with the absence of 5′ → 3′ exonucleases impose specific constraints on the process (3Petersen C. Belasco J.G. Brawerlan G. Control of Messenger RNA Stability. Academic Press, Inc., New York1993: 117-145Crossref Google Scholar). However, in all cases, mRNA stability seems under the control not only of cis-acting but also of trans-acting factors (4Derrigo M. Cestelli A. Savettier G. Di Liegro I. Int. J. Mol. Med. 2000; 5: 111-123PubMed Google Scholar). Indeed, the importance of RNA-binding proteins in the control of mRNA decay rates is becoming more and more evident. It has recently been shown, for example, that the stability of the E. coli ompA mRNA is modulated by its interactions with the host factor I (HfqI) protein, whose concentration depends, in turn, on the growth rate of the bacteria (5Vytvytska O. Jakobsen J.S. Balcunaite G. Andersen J.S. Baccarini M. von Gabain A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 14118-14123Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Similarly, several families of proteins, such as the poly(A) or AU-rich sequence binding proteins, have been implicated in the control of eukaryotic messenger degradation (2Ross J. Trends Genet. 1996; 12: 171-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). In this context, the S1-RegB system appears to constitute a very interesting model. RegB, encoded in the bacteriophage T4 genome, is involved in the specific degradation of phage early messengers, including its own. Indeed, after infection by aregB − strain, the half-life of the early mRNAs is increased by a factor of three, whereas that of the middle and late mRNAs remains unaffected. Several studies have established that this effect is due to differences in the enzyme activity toward the three classes of messengers and not to its inactivation during the middle phase (6Sanson B. Hu R. Troitskaya E. Mathy N. Uzan M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). More precisely, it has been shown that RegB specifically cleaves between the G and A of GGAG sequences in the Shine-Dalgarno regions of the early messengers. Surprisingly, a few GGAG motifs carried by early and middle mRNA and all motifs carried by late mRNA escape RegB processing, as also do most tested motifs within coding sequences. This indicates that RegB recognizes not only the GGAG sequence but also another signal, which remains unknown to date. Another striking point is that the RegB activity determinedin vitro is very low in comparison with what can be inferred from the in vivo observations. Considering the specificity of the enzyme, it had been postulated that the ribosome might play a role (7Uzan M. Favre R. Brody E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8895-8899Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). This has been verified. In vitro it was demonstrated that RegB activity can be accelerate by a factor of up to 100 (depending on the substrate) by the addition of the ribosomal protein S1 to the reaction mix (8Ruckman J. Ringquist S. Brody E. Gold L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26655-26662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). S1 is the largest ribosomal protein (556 amino acids). It is composed of six repetitions of a conserved domain, called the S1 motif, known to be an RNA/DNA binding motif also found in many prokaryotic and eukaryotic proteins involved in RNA metabolism. Its presence is strictly required to initiate the translation of most mRNAs (9Sørensen M.A. Fricke J. Pedersen J. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 561-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), but its precise mechanism of action remains unknown. In our system, it seemed reasonable to postulate an interaction between S1 and the RNA, but this has not been demonstrated. In addition, the nature of S1 action has not been elucidated. It was possible to imagine a nonspecific role. S1, indeed, has been reported to be an unwinding protein (10Subramanian A.R. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1983; 28: 101-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), but this model was not completely satisfying. In particular, it did not explain the rate enhancement observed on small unstructured RNAs (8Ruckman J. Ringquist S. Brody E. Gold L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26655-26662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the contrary, we could imagine that S1 participates in enzyme specificity by selecting several targets. In this study, we have undertaken the identification of the molecular basis of RegB selectivity and the definition of the nature of the role of S1. In the absence of any clear sequence motif outside the GGAG, we speculate that RegB activity might be dependent on an RNA structural determinant. To test this hypothesis, we tried to correlate the structure of a series of RNA molecules, probed by NMR spectroscopy, with their cleavage susceptibility in the presence and absence of S1. Several simple substrates of RegB were obtained by the SELEX method (11Jayasena V.K. Brown D. Shtatland T. Gold L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2349-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We have chosen one of them, possessing two GGAG sites, one reported to be cleaved and the other not. From a comparison of the properties of these two sites in several variants of this molecule, we propose a model of the interactions between the RNA, S1, and RegB. The S1 protein was purified from anE. coli MRE600 strain by affinity chromatography on a poly(U)-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column as described (12Subramanian A.R. Rienhardt P. Kimura M. Suryanarayana T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 119: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It was stored at 4 °C in 10 mmol.liter−1 Tris-Cl (pH 7.4), 6 mmol.liter−1 magnesium acetate, 0.1 mmol.liter−1 EDTA, 1 mol.liter−1 NH4Cl, and 7.2 mmol.liter−1 β−mercaptoethanol. The RegB gene has been introduced in a pET-7b vector (6Sanson B. Hu R. Troitskaya E. Mathy N. Uzan M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 297: 1063-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Its toxicity prevents the transformation of any E. coli strain possessing the T7 polymerase gene. A JM101 strain was therefore used, and RegB production was induced by infecting the culture (at around 0.7A650) with a λCE6 phage (multiplicity of 10) carrying the T7 polymerase gene (13Studier F.W. Moffat B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). The protein was purified on a nickel nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) column. Strikingly, its complete elution required a very high (500 mmol.liter−1) imidazol concentration. After dialysis, the protein was stored at −20 °C in 20 mmol.liter−1 Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mmol.liter−1 NaCl, 0.2 mmol.liter−1 dithiothreitol, and 50% glycerol. DNA oligonucleotide templates were purchased from Eurogentec. Phenoxyacetyl β-RNA phosphoramidite were bought from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. RNA chemical synthesis was performed on a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Gene Assembler Plus apparatus. Most RNAs were produced using in vitro transcription according to the method developed by Uhlenbeck and co-workers (14Milligan J.F. Groebe D.R. Witherell G.W. Uhlenbeck O.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8783-8798Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). In addition, three (the S22cug, S22stem, and S22linear molecules, see under “Results”) were produced by chemical synthesis (15Wincott F. DiRenzo A. Shaffer C. Grimm S. Tracz D. Workmann C. Sweedler D. Gonzalez C. Scaringe S. Usman N. Nucleic Acid Res. 1995; 23: 2677-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). Transcription reactions were performed in 40 mmol.liter−1 Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mmol.liter−1 spermidine, 5 mmol.liter−1 dithiothreitol, 0.01% Triton X-100, 80 mg.ml−1 40% polyethylene glycol, 4–16 mmol.liter−1 MgCl2, 2 mmol.liter−1 each nucleotide, 400 nmol.liter−1 template, and 0.01 mg.ml−1 T7 RNA polymerase. Before large scale production, all transcriptions were tested on small volumes, and the products were analyzed by gel autoradiography to check the quality of the matrices and to optimize the conditions (the MgCl2concentration, in particular). In all cases, two major species were observed, one corresponding to the awaited product, the other having a much higher molecular weight. Similar observations have been reported by several authors and interpreted as the result of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity of the T7 polymerase (16Cazenave C. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6972-6976Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Different matrices and conditions were tested to try to eliminate this species, without success. To separate the full-length RNA molecule from the shorter species, the chemically synthesized fragments were purified using a Q-Sepharose high performance liquid chromatography column running on a Beckman system. Before RNA loading, the column was equilibrated with 80% buffer A and 20% buffer B (A: 5 mmol.liter−1 potassium phosphate (pH 6.5), 4 mol.liter−1 urea; B: same as A with 1 mol.liter−1 NaCl). All species could be separated using a linear gradient: 20% B → 80% B in 80 min. For of the transcription product, the RNA molecules could be separated from the DNA matrices, abortive fragments, and free nucleotides using a similar protocol. However, with this technique, it was impossible to separate the correct RNA fragment from the high molecular weight species. According to the interpretation above, the two products would have complementary sequences and would thus be able to form very stable double helices. Their separation could only be achieved by polyacrylamide (18%) gel electrophoresis using denaturing conditions (8 mol.liter−1 urea) and high temperature migration (60–80 °C). Typically, 2 mg of RNA could be loaded on a 3-mm gel. After migration, the bands were detected by UV-shadowing and cut from the gel, and the RNA was recovered using a Schleicher & Shuell electroelution apparatus. The elution buffer was 50 mmol.liter−1 Tris borate (pH 8.0), 1 mmol.liter−1 EDTA. The oligonucleotides were concentrated by lyophilization or ethanol precipitation and dialyzed twice, first against 20 mmol.liter−1 phosphate buffer (pH 6.4), 5 mmol.liter−1 EDTA, 100 mmol.liter−1 NaCl and then against pure H2O. Cleavage reactions were performed in 50 mmol.liter−1 Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mmol.liter−1 dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mmol.liter−1 EDTA at 37 °C. To compare the reaction rates, we always used the same conditions: 1 μmol.liter−1 32P-labeled RNA, 0.2 μmol.liter−1 RegB, and 0 or 0.4 μmol.liter−1 S1 in a final volume of 80 μl. 60 units of RNasin were added to prevent the eventuality of parasite cleavage by RNase A-like enzymes. In parallel with each reaction, a control was performed by incubating the RNA in the same conditions (buffer, S1, RNasin) without RegB. In addition, a ladder, obtained by a partial digestion of the substrate, was always added to obtain a measurement of the product lengths. The kinetics were generally followed for 2 h. Aliquots (5 μl) were typically taken at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 120 min. They were mixed with 3 μl of loading blue (8 mol.liter−1 urea, 20 mmol.liter−1 EDTA, 10% glycerol, and 0.05% bromophenol blue), heated 2 min at 98 °C, and put on ice. The substrates and products were separated by gel electrophoresis (18% polyacrylamide, 8 mol.liter−1 urea) and detected by autoradiography. The band intensities were quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Most reactions were repeated two or three times. In the case of the S22linear fragment, the results were so surprising (see under “Results”) that we repeated the whole process (synthesis, purification, and kinetic study twice). The percentages of residual substrate and product formed at a given time were evaluated from the ratio of the corresponding band to the sum of all band intensities. Simple phenomenological models were considered to represent the reactions: S → P or S → P1 → P2, according to the number (one or two) of cleavage sites. The corresponding equations were fitted to the experimental curves. It was not always possible to obtain a correct adjustment between the model and all data points. In these cases, only the first points were taken into account. All experiments were recorded on a Bruker DRX600 spectrometer equipped with a gradient TXI probe. The spectra were processed off line using the GIFA software (17Delsuc M.-A. Skilling J. Maximum Entropy and Bayesian Methods. Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1989: 285-290Crossref Google Scholar), and the data were analyzed using either GIFC (18Rouh A. Delsuc M.-A. Bertrand G. Lallemand J.-Y. J. Magn. Reson. 1993; 102: 357-359Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar) or XEASY (19Bartels C. Xia T.-h. Billeter M. Günter P. Wüthrich K. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (1601) Google Scholar) programs. H2O samples were prepared by dissolving the RNA in 400 μl of 90% H2O, 10% D2O. The pH was adjusted to about 6.5 by adding a small amount of NaOH. NaN3 (0.05%) was added to prevent bacterial growth. D2O samples were obtained by lyophilizing the corresponding H2O samples and dissolving them in D2O. Two further lyophilizations were generally performed to remove as much H2O as possible. Exchangeable proton assignments were obtained from the analysis of one-dimensional and two-dimensional NOE 1The abbreviations used are:NOEnuclear Overhauser enhancementTOCSYtotal correlation spectroscopyDQF-COSYdouble quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy experiments recorded in H2O. Typically, acquisition parameters were 2048 data points over a 12-kHz spectral range, 64–128 scans, and 2-s relaxation time. Generally, 512 increments were recorded in the two-dimensional experiments. The water was always suppressed using a jump and return reading pulse (20Plateau P. Guéron M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 7310-7311Crossref Scopus (1140) Google Scholar).

Commun. 1980; 95: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (2028) Google Scholar) experiments were also recorded in D2O. A MLEV17 sequence with a spin-lock time of 60 ms was used for the TOCSY. NOE spectroscopy was realized with mixing times between 70 and 500 ms. Acquisition parameters were similar to those used in H2O with the exception of the spectral width, reduced to 4.8 kHz. The residual HDO signal was presaturated during the relaxation delay. Considering the lack of any clear sequence motif distinguishing cleaved and uncleaved GGAG-containing oligonucleotides, we hypothesized that RegB might recognize a structural determinant. To test this, we decided to compare the three-dimensional structure of good and poor substrates. One possibility would have been to study two natural sequences, such asmotA (cleaved) and denV (uncleaved). However, this presented two major difficulties. First, we have no information about the relative position and distance between the GGAG and the putative signal. Thus, it would have been difficult to define the limits of the fragment to study. Second, the physiological role of the sequence might require the presence of structural features on its own. Differences between the cleaved and uncleaved sequences would thus have been difficult to interpret. We therefore took advantage of a published study carried out in the aim of selecting good RegB substrates by the SELEX method (11Jayasena V.K. Brown D. Shtatland T. Gold L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2349-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Two of the reported molecules (the 22nd and 40th) looked particularly attractive since both possess two GGAG sites, one cleaved, the other not. Using a secondary structure predicted by mfold software (24Zuker M. Mathews D.H. Turner D.H. Barciszewski J. Clark B.F.C. RNA Biochemistry and Biotechnology. NATO ASI series, Kluwer Academic Publishers Group, Dordrecht, Netherlands1999: 11-43Crossref Google Scholar), a short fragment (hereafter designed S22cug) compatible with NMR structural analysis and containing both sites, was isolated from the 22nd molecule. In addition, during the course of the study, we were led to design several variants (Fig. 1). The ends of the molecule were modified to obtain a better transcription yield (S22gg). The influence of the structural environment on the cleavage rate of the first site was studied with the series S26so (site one, in which the second site has been eliminated and the terminal loop shortened), S22turn (in which the terminal loop has been replaced by a GNRA turn), and S22stem (in which the internal loop has also been suppressed). Similarly, the second site alone was conserved in a simplified molecule S22two, placed in the middle of the terminal loop (S22twoloop) or in a linear fragment (S22linear). The RNA structures of five of these molecules, the S22linear, S22cug, S22gg, S26so, and S22stem, (Fig. 1) were probed by NMR spectroscopy. The secondary structure predictions were not sufficient for our purpose; in particular, they are unable to give information concerning possible structures adopted by the loop regions. The resonances of the imino protons (found between 9.5 and 14 ppm in spectra recorded in H2O) constitute a good probe of the oligonucleotide secondary structure. Their observation indicates, indeed, that the corresponding protons are involved in hydrogen bonds, generally due to the formation of base pairs. In case of S22linear, a resonance at 12 ppm is observed at 5 °C showing that at least one base pair is formed at this temperature (Fig.2). However, at 25 °C the spectrum is exempt of sharp peaks, and the only remaining signal present between 10.5 and 11 ppm is characteristic of unpaired imino protons, demonstrating the absence of structure in the conditions of the cleavage reaction (37 °C). In all other cases, resonances are observed in one-dimensional and two-dimensional spectra at both low and high temperature. In the latter case, the lines are broader due to the acceleration of the proton exchange rate. However, as shown in Fig. 2, even if some become very weak, the number of peaks remains constant throughout the explored temperature range. This is in agreement with the determination of fusion temperatures, which are always above 37 °C (from 45 °C for the S22cug to 85 °C for the S22stem), and indicates that the secondary structure observed at low temperature is probably conserved in the condition of the enzymatic study. The nucleotides involved in the secondary structure can be identified by means of one-dimensional and two-dimensional NOE spectroscopy experiments recorded in H2O. It is, in particular, easy to discriminate between the GC and AU base pairs, the latter being characterized by the presence of a strong NOE correlation between the U-imino resonance and the very narrow peak (around 7 ppm) of the A-H2 proton. In all cases analyzed, the observed number of GC and AU base pairs was in agreement with the predicted structures. The same experiments were also used when possible to assign the resonances by analysis of sequential connectivity. The S22stem molecule is predicted to form a long helical stem disrupted at the A position of the GGAG (Fig. 1). The two strands of the helix are joined by a short GUAA loop, believed to form a GNRA turn. The NOE pattern allows the identification of a segment that matches the predicted stem. In addition, one peak possesses a chemical shift (10 ppm) indicative of a hydrogen bond with an oxygen atom. Such a hydrogen bond is expected in the GNRA turn between the U-imino proton and an oxygen of the backbone. In case of S22cug and S22gg, a stem-loop-stem-loop organization is expected. The first stem has a predicted length of 5 (S22cug) or 6 (S22gg) residues, whereas the second is shorter (2 residues). The various spectra of the two molecules are nearly identical, indicating similar structure. Five (of seven) of the S22cug imino resonances were assigned. Their chaining matches that of the first predicted stem. The two remaining peaks present the characteristic features of GC base pairs but are so broad that it was impossible to observe any sequential connectivity. They probably correspond to the second short stem, its size and location between the two loops resulting in low stability and consequently in the observed peak broadening. The predicted structure of S26so is similar to that of S22cug, as are the results. Seven imino resonances (six C, one U) are observed. Their assignment was complicated by the small dispersion of the lines; however, by combining the results of different experiments performed at different temperatures, a chaining was identified corresponding to the first stem. The two remaining lines are very broad and present no sequential connectivity. As in the case of S22cug, we assumed that they correspond to the small GC/CG stem between the internal and terminal loops. The study of the S22cug molecule was carried further by looking at the nonexchangeable protons (Fig. 3). The analysis of the aromatic-H1′ correlations on the one hand and of the imino- and amino-aromatic correlations on the other hand confirmed the previously obtained results but could not provide any further assignment. In fact, a close examination of the spectra recorded in D2O reveals that all nontrivial signals involve the helix residues. This strongly suggests that the two loop regions are not structured. Interestingly, we also observed that the line width of the cytidine and uridine H5-H6 scalar correlations (as determined in a TOCSY experiment) varies with respect to the location of the residue (Fig. 4). These protons form a rigid system. Thus, all variations of their line shape reflect a variation of the residue dynamics (25Lane A.N. Lefèvre J.-F. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 596-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The five correlations corresponding to the residues of the first helix were assigned. As shown in Fig. 4, their line width increases regularly from the free end of the helix (C1) to the other end (C26). The four other correlations are located in the short helix (C8 and C21) and in the terminal and internal loops (C16 and C23, respectively). These peaks could not be assigned. However, two behave like the C26. The others are very broad, and their observation depends strongly on the temperature and on the spectrometer field (data not shown). The narrow lines correspond to residues in a single environment or, more likely here, to residues with a fast exchange rate (with respect to the chemical shift difference) between two conformations or environments. On the contrary, the widening or disappearance of the peaks reflects a slower (fast-intermediate or intermediate) exchange rate. The behavior of the various peaks thus confirms that the loop regions are in equilibrium between several conformations. The peak widening from the free end of the helix to the other end in particular could be interpreted as the result of an increasing perturbation of the corresponding residue environment due to the loops conformational exchange.Figure 4H6-H5 region of a TOCSY spectrum recorded on the S22cug molecule. The spectrum was recorded in D2O at 290 K. The contour plot of the two-dimensional TOCSY spectrum and the one-dimensional slices taken at the peak frequencies are reported. They readily indicate a variation of the peak width with the localization of the corresponding residues. The C1 and U2 residues at the free end of the long stem display the sharpest correlations. In contrast, the C26 residue (at the other end of the long stem) and the C8, C16, C21, and C23 residues (in the two loops and in the short stem) correspond to very broad peaks. This confirms that the two loops are in equilibrium between several conformations and indicates that the exchange rate between the conformations belongs to the fast-intermediate NMR domain.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A kinetic analysis of the cleavage reaction has been carried out on all substrates in the presence and absence of S1. To be able to compare the cleavage rates, all experiments were done rigorously in the same conditions. As an illustration of the quality of the data, the gel autoradiographs of the experiments with the S22, S26so, S22turn, and S22linear molecules are presented in Fig. 5. The different bands are well defined, and their sizes can be unambiguously determined by comparison with the ladder. In a few cases, a smear was observed in the middle region of the gel. Generally, it was very slight and did not interfere with the analysis. However, in case of the S22twoloop, the smear prevented the quantification of the bands. The control lanes always showed a unique spot corresponding to the full-length, indicating that there is neither degradation nor cleavage in absence of RegB. S22cug (Fig. 5 A) and S22gg correspond to a fragment of the initial SELEX molecule (11Jayasena V.K. Brown D. Shtatland T. Gold L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2349-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). They possess two GGAG sequences, but the first was thought to be resistant. Given that the molecules are labeled in 5′, two bands (corresponding to the full-length and one product) are thus expected. In fact, three are observed whose lengths are in agreement with cutting at both sites. The unexpected cleavage at the first site was studied with the S26so (Fig. 5 B), S22turn (Fig. 5 C), and S22stem molecules, which differ by the number of loops. The S26so (having an internal and a terminal loop) and S22turn (in which the terminal loop is replaced by a GNRA tetra loop) are c"
https://openalex.org/W2067734914,"Abstract The three-dimensional structures of the inactive conformations of Hck and Src, members of the Src protein-tyrosine kinase family, have recently been described. In both cases, the catalytic domain lies on the opposite face of the enzyme from the SH2 and SH3 domains. The active conformation of these enzymes has not yet been described. Given the known role of the SH2 and SH3 domains in promoting substrate binding, enzyme activation likely reorients the relative spatial arrangement between the SH2/SH3 domains and the active site region. We describe herein a series of “molecular rulers” and their use in assessing the topological and spatial relationships of the SH2 and active site regions of the Src protein-tyrosine kinase. These synthetic compounds contain sequences that are active site-directed (-Glu-Glu-Ile-Ile-(F5)Phe-, where (F5)Phe is pentafluorophenylalanine) and SH2-directed (-Tyr(P)-Glu-Glu-Ile-Glu-), separated by a sequence of variable length. The most potent bivalent compound, acetyl-Glu-Glu-Leu-Leu-(F5)Phe-(GABA)3-Tyr(P)-Glu-Glu-Ile-Glu-amide (where GABA is γ-aminobutyric acid), displays a >120-fold enhancement in inhibitory potency relative to the simple monovalent active site-directed species, acetyl-Glu-Glu-Leu-Leu-(F5)Phe-amide. The short linker length (3 GABA residues) between the active site- and SH2-directed peptide fragments suggests that the corresponding domains on the Src kinase can assume a nearly contiguous spatial arrangement in the active form of the enzyme."

Nature. 1984; 309: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). ssDNA forms a complex with RecA at site I known as a presynaptic filament. dsDNA then binds at a second site, site II. If the DNA sequences at site I and II are complementary, synapsis can occur, leading to strand exchange. ssDNA can also bind at site II (1Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14672-14682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), binding constants for the reaction of ssDNA with site II of RecA protein are unknown. We have recently (24Gourves A.S. Tanguy Le Gac N. Villani G. Boehmer P.E. Johnson N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10864-10869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) measured the equilibrium binding parameters for the reaction of ICP8, the ssDNA-binding protein of herpes simplex virus type I, with ssDNA using an approach that combines fluorescence anisotropy and macromolecular binding density function analysis (25Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 58-290Google Scholar). Here we employ this method to study the reaction between site II of the RecA nucleoprotein filament and a 5′-fluorescein-labeled ss 32-mer oligonucleotide. One of the reasons that equilibrium constants for this reaction have not previously been measured is that ss polynucleotides bind tightly to RecA in the presence of cofactor (26Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 27Kowalczykowski S.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 539-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Use of an oligonucleotide, which may bind less to RecA than do polynucleotides, was expected to overcome this difficulty. We chose an oligonucleotide known to be a substrate for RecA-catalyzed DNA strand exchange (8Mazin A.V. Kowalczykowski S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1161-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 9Mazin A.V. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10674-10678Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and labeled the 5′-extremity with fluorescein. It was necessary to 1) demonstrate that the protein formed a functional complex with the fluorescent oligonucleotide, 2) show that the anisotropy reflected protein binding rather than local effects near the fluorescein label, and 3) experimentally determine the relation between the anisotropy signal and fractional saturation for the reaction. These conditions were met, and we have characterized the equilibrium binding of ssDNA with site II of the RecA nucleoprotein filament in the presence of ATPγS. RecA protein was purified from E. coli as previously described (19Cazaux C. Larminat F. Villani G. Johnson N.P. Schnarr M. Defais M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8246-8254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was free of nuclease activity. Oligonucleotides1 (5′-F CCA TCC GCA AAA ATG ACC TCT TAT CAA AAG GA-3′, where F is fluorescein), 2 (5′-CCA TCC GCA AAA ATG ACC TCT TAT CAA AAG GA-3′), and 3 (5′-TCC TTT TGA TAA GAG GTC ATT TTT GCG GAT GG-3′) were synthesized by Genosys. To prepare double-stranded oligonucleotides 1/3 and2/3, an equimolar mixture of complementary oligonucleotides in 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.4, was heated to 90 °C and slowly cooled to ensure hybridization. Protein and oligonucleotide concentrations were determined by UV spectroscopy with ε280 = 2.17 × 104m−1 cm−1and ε260 = 8.64 × 103m−1 cm−1, respectively. Concentrations of ss oligonucleotides arem nt, and ds oligonucleotides are m base pairs. Strand exchange in vitro was carried out following published methods (8Mazin A.V. Kowalczykowski S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1161-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Presynaptic complexes were formed by reacting 15 μm RecA, 1 mm ATPγs, and 45 μm nt ss oligonucleotide 15 min at 37 °C in TMDG buffer (20 mm Tris acetate, 2 mmMg(CH3C00)2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol, pH 7.5). The Mg(CH3C00)2concentration was then increased to 12 mm, and after 5 min of incubation, strand exchange was initiated by the addition of ds oligonucleotide (45 μm base pairs). 10-μl aliquots were removed from the reaction at various times and deproteinized at room temperature by adding 50 mm EDTA, 1% SDS. After 5 min, 5 μl of glycerol/bromphenol blue were added, and samples were stored on ice prior to 20% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (0.1 mTris, 90 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.4) for 75 min at 150 V. Strand exchange was quantified from fluorescence intensities on wet gels using a PhosphorImager Storm 840 apparatus (Molecular Dynamics) in the Fluorescence Blue operating mode. The intensity of the signal from ds oligonucleotide was corrected for quenching (see “Results”). Fluorescence experiments were performed by a model MOS-400 spectrophotometer from Bio-Logic (Claix, France). Samples were excited at 490 nm and stirred continuously at various temperatures ± 1 °C in a 1.0 × 0.4-cm temperature-controlled cuvette with the 4-mm path oriented in the direction of the exciting light. Inner filter effects were negligible. The pH was measured at the beginning and end of control experiments to assure that it remained constant during titrations. Addition of RecA protein led to a 3-nm red shift, with no change in the shape of the fluorescence emission spectrum of oligonucleotide 1. Therefore, to optimize the sensitivity of the experiments, total spectral intensity was subsequently measured using a 515-nm cutoff filter. Fluorescence and fluorescence anisotropy were measured using a photoelectric modulator (Hinds) in λ/2 mode. Results are reported as eitherAobs or A =Aobs − A0(1 − θ′); Aobs is the observed anisotropy,A0 is the signal of the oligonucleotide alone, and θ′ is the estimated fraction of bound oligonucleotide, (Aobs −A0)/(Amax −A0), where Amax is the anisotropy of oligonucleotide complexed to RecA. We first determined whether RecA protein catalyzed the strand exchange reaction with the fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide. When the spontaneous background reaction was subtracted from the data, 47 ± 7% strand transfer was observed (Fig. 1), which required protein, ATPγS, and sequence homology (data not shown). The extent of this reaction was independent of the placement of the fluorescein label in the ss or ds substrate and identical for reactions carried out at 37 °C and 25 °C within experimental uncertainty (Fig.1 b). These results are consistent with the extent of strand exchange previously reported for the oligonucleotide without fluorescein label (8Mazin A.V. Kowalczykowski S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1161-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 9Mazin A.V. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10674-10678Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Hence, the fluorescein label did not appear to perturb the strand exchange reaction, and the subsequent fluorescence spectroscopy studies were carried out in reaction conditions where strand exchange takes place. The stoichiometry of the reaction was determined from the spectral changes observed during the titration of fluorescent ss oligonucleotide by RecA protein (Fig. 2). RecA quenched fluorescent oligonucleotide 1 by 30 ± 4%. The initial anisotropy of oligonucleotide, 0.027 ± 0.005, increased to 0.19 ± 0.01, indicating a decreased mobility of the protein-DNA complex. The extent of spectral changes was independent of ATPγS. Stoichiometry, determined from the ratio of oligonucleotide:protein necessary to saturate the signal, was 5.8 ± 0.3 nt/RecA. This value is in agreement with the results of previous studies showing that RecA protein has two sites with binding site sizes of 3 nt/RecA molecule (1Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Zlotnick A. Mitchell R.S. Steed R.K. Brenner S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22525-22530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of NaCl to the complex formed in the absence of cofactor increased the fluorescence and decreased the anisotropy (Fig.2 b). In both cases the final signal was equal to that of free oligonucleotide at these concentrations of NaCl, and the salt titration midpoint (STMP) was 115 ± 10 mm NaCl. In the presence of ATPγS (Fig. 2 d), addition of NaCl increased the fluorescence signal by 16 ± 5% (which can be accounted for by increased oligonucleotide fluorescence in the presence of salt (24Gourves A.S. Tanguy Le Gac N. Villani G. Boehmer P.E. Johnson N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10864-10869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar)) and decreased the anisotropy by 11 ± 6%. These results show that in the absence, but not in the presence, of ATPγS, NaCl can dissociate oligonucleotide from the complex formed with excess RecA. A similar effect of cofactor on the stability of complexes with polynucleotides has been reported, although STMP values are greater for polynucleotides than for oligonucleotides (26Menetski J.P. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 181: 281-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 27Kowalczykowski S.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. Biophys. Chem. 1991; 20: 539-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). The RecA protein has two DNA binding sites. In the previous experiments, oligonucleotide bound stoichiometrically to protein, and the complex formed in the presence of excess RecA, presumably binding at site I, was stable in the presence of high concentrations of NaCl. We wished to confirm this result and, if possible, to find equilibrium conditions for binding to the individual sites. To this end we attempted to make complexes with fluorescent oligonucleotide in either site I or site II and titrated them with various salts to find conditions where oligonucleotide bound incompletely to protein (Fig. 3). The anisotropy of the oligonucleotide alone increased with salt concentration, and this phenomenon was taken into account in the determination of the STMP. Reacting 1 μm RecA with 3 μm fluorescent oligonucleotide 1 formed a complex between oligonucleotide1 and site I (1Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Zlotnick A. Mitchell R.S. Steed R.K. Brenner S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22525-22530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anisotropy of this complex was 0.18 and decreased only slightly on addition of 800 mm NaCl (Fig.3 a). This result shows that ssDNA binding at site I was insensitive to NaCl, as suggested by the results in Fig. 2 d. However, when 6 or 9 μm oligonucleotide 2 was equilibrated with RecA prior to adding oligonucleotide 1,the fluorescence anisotropy decreased with addition of NaCl; the final anisotropy was the same as for oligonucleotide alone at these salt concentrations, indicating that all fluorescent oligonucleotide was displaced (STMP = 170 mm). Equilibration of 1 μm RecA with 1.5 or 3 μm nonfluorescent oligonucleotide 2 prior to addition of oligonucleotide1 gave comparable results, although fluorescent oligonucleotide was not completely displaced. The STMP was the same in all cases, indicating a second mode of binding to RecA, with different salt sensitivity than the complex with site I. In the case where 3 μm oligonucleotide 2 was equilibrated prior to addition of equimolar oligonucleotide 1, the fluorescent oligonucleotide could not be entirely removed by NaCl, showing that some oligonucleotide 1 was bound in site I; these results indicate that although stoichiometric binding at site I is insensitive to salt, it may be kinetically labile, at least at higher salt concentrations. Similar experiments were carried out using other salts (TableI). The STMP value of KCl, 170 mm, was the same as NaCl. Na(CH3C00) was less efficient (STMP = 240 mm). MgCl2 readily dissociated these complexes (STMP = 55 mm). High concentrations of MgCl2 also displaced oligonucleotide1 from site I (STMP = 450 mm) (Fig.3 b). To confirm this latter observation, 5 μmfluorescent oligonucleotide 1 was titrated with RecA as in Fig. 2; at the end of the titration, oligonucleotide was in the presence of excess RecA and therefore bound primarily at site I. This complex, which was insensitive to NaCl (Figs. 2 d and3 a), was nevertheless dissociated by MgCl2(STMP = 485 mm) (data not shown). Finally, MgCl2 disrupted a complex of 1 μm RecA, 1.5 μm oligonucleotide 2, and 3 μmoligonucleotide 1 by a two-step process (Fig.3 b).Table ISalt concentrations required for 50% dissociation of RecA-ss oligonucleotide complex (100 μm ATPγS, TMDG buffer; 25 °C)SaltSTMPSite ISite IImmNaCln.o. 1-aNot observed for salt concentrations less than 1 m.170 ± 8KCln.o.1-aNot observed for salt concentrations less than 1 m.170 ± 8Na(CH3COO)n.o.1-aNot observed for salt concentrations less than 1 m.240 ± 10MgCl2450 ± 4055 ± 81-a Not observed for salt concentrations less than 1 m. Open table in a new tab These results demonstrate the existence of two types of oligonucleotide binding to RecA, with different sensitivities to salts. Oligonucleotide binding at site I (3 nt/RecA protein) was stable in the presence of both monovalent cations studied. The second mode of binding, observed when site I was occupied by unlabeled oligonucleotide, was disrupted by salt (STMP = 170 mm NaCl). Stoichiometric analysis of the data is not possible because binding was not quantitative at high salt concentrations. It nevertheless seems reasonable to suppose that the second mode of binding corresponds to the reaction of oligonucleotide with site II. Based on these results, the equilibrium constant for binding of single-stranded oligonucleotide to site II of the RecA filament was determined at 25 °C in 150 mm NaCl, 100 μm ATPγS, pH 7.5. The formation of the presynaptic complex is quantitative in these reaction conditions (see above), and the concentration of unreacted RecA can be neglected at protein and DNA concentrations where bound and free oligonucleotides are present. Consequently, the titration can be described by the equilibrium (Fig.4 a) RN1+N⇔RN2REACTIONIwhere RN1 is the presynaptic complex, RN2 is the complex with ss oligonucleotides in both site I and site II, and N is the free nucleotide concentration (m nt). RT is equal to RN1 + RN2, which is the total protein concentration (mprotein monomer). Because RN2 has two DNA binding sites, this complex enters once into the equation of mass for the protein and twice in the expression for concentration of nucleotidesNT=N+Nb=N+n(RN1+2·RN2)Equation 1 where NT is the total nucleotide concentration, Nb is the bound nucleotide concentration (m nt), and n is the binding site size (nt/protein). The equilibrium constant,K = [RN2]/[RN1][N], was determined using the macromolecular binding density function method (25Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 58-290Google Scholar). This approach is based on the principle that all reaction conditions that produce the same fractional saturation, θ = Nb/NT = n(RN1 + 2·RN2)/NT, will have the same spectroscopic signal. Application of this approach to the RecA nucleoprotein filament assumes that the anisotropy signal is the same when fluorescent oligonucleotide is bound in either site (see “Discussion”). Combining the expressions for θ and RT yields Equation 2.RT=(θ/(2n))NT+(RN1)/2Equation 2 We titrated five concentrations of fluorescent oligonucleotide1 with RecA protein (Fig. 4 b). The observed signal was corrected for the anisotropy of unbound oligonucleotide (see “Experimental Procedures”). Each value of A gave five pairs of concentrations, {RT, NT}, which have the same fractional saturation. For anisotropy values in the range of 0.02 to 0.12, plots of RT as a function of NT for the sets {RT, NT} were linear (data not shown), and θ and RN1 were determined for each plot using Equation 2. Each value of θ calculated by this method corresponds to a unique anisotropy, and in this way the dependence of A on fractional saturation can be determined (Fig.5 a). Results forA < 0.1 were reproducible in three separate titrations. The variations observed above this value of Awere not a consequence of nonlinear plots of Equation 2. The plot ofA versus θ showed small significant positive curvature, indicating that the mobility of the fluorophore decreased to a greater extent at high levels of binding than at low levels, as was previously observed for ICP8 protein (24Gourves A.S. Tanguy Le Gac N. Villani G. Boehmer P.E. Johnson N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10864-10869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The graph of θ as a function of presynaptic filament concentration RN1 (Fig. 5 b) is a model-free binding isotherm that is independent of the relationship between A and θ (25Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 58-290Google Scholar). The model-free binding isotherm was fit using the simple two-state equilibrium described by Reaction I. For this model, θ = (C + 1)/(C + 1 +(1/(2n·K·RN1))), where C = RN1/(2·RN2). We first assumed that C could be ignored (C ≪ 1; (1/K) ≪ N) and fit the isotherm using Equation 3.θ=1/(1+(1/(2·n·K·RN1)))Equation 3 Theoretical curves for K = 1.5 × 106m−1,K = 1.25 × 106m−1, and K = 1.0 × 106m−1are shown in Fig. 5 b. Using these values, C ≪ 1 as long as the free nucleotide concentration N ≫ 1 μm, which appears to be the case at least for the titrations of 6, 9, 12, and 15 μm oligonucleotide by low concentrations of protein. To confirm this binding constant, we fit the titration curves (Fig.4 b). The calculated fractional saturation (Equation 3) was transformed into anisotropy using results in Fig. 5 a and a value for the plateau of the titration curve, θ = 1, ofA = 0.18. RecA concentration was determined using Equation 2, taking into account dilution of total nucleotide, NT, during titration. Theoretical curves using n = 3 nt/RecA protein and K = 1.5 ± 0.5 × 106m−1 fit experimental data well (Fig. 4 b). Reverse titrations of various concentrations of RecA protein with fluorescent oligonucleotide were also carried out, and the binding constant was determined. Binding isotherms (Fig.6) exhibited a plateau ofAobs = 0.175 ± 0.01 during the initial part of the titration curve. Plots of {RT, NT} corresponding to a constant anisotropy were linear for Aobs between 0.05 and 0.16 (data not shown), and the analysis of the reverse titration revealed the same relation between anisotropy and fractional saturation, θ, as that in Fig. 5 a. Values of RN1 calculated from the intercepts of these plots were small, as expected for high concentrations of oligonucleotide, and their uncertainty was too large to determine a model-free binding isotherm. However experimental curves for the reverse titration could be directly fit by the equilibrium used to describe the forward titration by RecA protein. The calculated fractional saturation was determined using Equation 3 and transformed into anisotropy as above; oligonucleotide concentration, NT, was calculated by Equation 2. It is worth noting that NT is proportional to binding site size, n (Equation1). Simulated titrations showed that K intervened primarily in the shape of the curve, whereas n displaced it to lower or higher oligonucleotide concentrations (data not shown). Hence both parameters were varied to fit experimental data. Satisfactory agreement was obtained by n = 2.8 ± 0.2 nt/RecA andK = 2.3 ± 0.7 × 106m−1, where uncertainties are the range of values used to obtain the best visual fits (Fig. 6). Hence forward and reverse titrations could be described by a simple two-state model (Fig. 4 a; Reaction I and Equations 2 and3) (K = 1.5 ± 0.5 × 106m−1); the binding site size determined by the reverse titration provided an independent confirmation of the results of stoichiometric binding experiments (Fig.2). The NaCl dependence of the equilibrium constant was estimated from the data for 6 and 9 μm oligonucleotide 2 in Fig.3 a. The signal at various salt concentrations was corrected for the anisotropy of unbound oligonucleotides usingA0 = 0.03 (see “Experimental Procedures”), and the resulting anisotropy was converted into fractional saturation using Fig. 5 a. The binding constant was calculated by assuming that the resulting anisotropy was due to oligonucleotide binding at site II only (K = (θ/(1 − θ))(1/n(RT − (θ/n)NT)))). The slope of the linear parts of the plots of log(K) versuslog([NaCl]), −3.5 ± 0.3, is a function of the electrostatic interactions per protein monomer contributing to the stability of the nucleoprotein filament (28Record Jr., T.M. Lohman T.M. De Haseth P. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). A similar calculation for Na(CH3C00) gave δlog(K)/δlog(Na(CH3C00)) = −2.7 ± 0.1, confirming the influence of anion on the equilibrium constant, which was suggested by the STMP (Table I). Finally, we investigated the effect of temperature on the reaction. The binding constant at 37 °C was determined using the macromolecular binding density function analysis (25Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 58-290Google Scholar) as above. Four concentrations of oligonucleotide (3–12 μm) were titrated with RecA protein in TMDG buffer, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. A slightly positively curved relation between anisotropy and θ was observed at 37 °C, similar to results at 25 °C (Fig. 5 a) (Amax = 0.18). This relationship was used to fit the experimental binding isotherms using the same method as in Fig. 4(K = 0.45 ± 0.15 × 106m−1). Binding of oligonucleotide to site II of the nucleoprotein filament was inhibited by NaCl, and δlog(K)/δlog([NaCl]) was the same at 25 and 37 °C. Because the relationship between A and θ appeared to be independent of temperature, titrations of 5 μmoligonucleotide 1 with RecA protein were carried out at various temperatures, and binding constants were determined by fitting the isotherms (Table II). In all cases, temperature was measured in the reaction solution before and after titration. Enthalpy and entropy were calculated from a van't Hoff plot of these data that was linear (Fig. 7) (ΔH = −22.4 ± 2.0 kcal/m; ΔS = −23.6 ± 3.3 cal/(K·m/ (K is degrees Kelvin).Table IIEquilibrium constants for the titration of RecA protein with oligonucleotide 1 (100 μm ATPγS, 150 mm NaCl, TMDG buffer, pH 7.5) at various temperaturesTemperatureK±1 °Cm−1222.5 × 106251.5 ± 0.5 × 106291.3 × 10634.55.0 × 105374.5 ± 1.5 × 105 Open table in a new tab Fluorescence anisotropy of 5′-fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotides appears to be a useful method to investigate the reaction of DNA with RecA protein under conditions where DNA strand exchange can occur. Using this technique we found that the stoichiometry of the nucleoprotein complex formed between fluorescent oligonucleotide1 and RecA protein was 5.8 ± 0.3 nt/RecA, independent of cofactor (Fig. 2), in agreement with previous results for polynucleotides (1Roca A.I.

Chem. 1991; 20: 539-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). These results show that the observed fluorescence anisotropy changes reflect DNA binding in the nucleoprotein filament. Finally, the oligonucleotide with fluorescein at its 5′-extremity was a substrate for RecA-catalyzed strand exchangein vitro (Fig. 1). The reaction required protein, ATPγS, and sequence homology, as expected. RecA protein carried out strand exchange with fluorescein-labeled oligonucleotide with an efficiency comparable with that with unlabeled oligonucleotides (8Mazin A.V. Kowalczykowski S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1161-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 9Mazin A.V. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10674-10678Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Hence the fluorescein label had no significant effect on protein-DNA interactions necessary for strand exchange. These results show that fluorescence anisotropy of this oligonucleotide can be used to study protein-DNA interactions in a productive RecA nucleoprotein filament. Fluorescence anisotropy is not proportional to fluorophore concentration (29Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Plenum Press, New York1983: 112-150Google Scholar), and it was important to experimentally determine the relationship between spectroscopic signal and fractional saturation, θ. Macromolecular binding density function analysis (25Lohman T.M. Bujalowski W. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 58-290Google Scholar) is a useful method to address this question (24Gourves A.S. Tanguy Le Gac N. Villani G. Boehmer P.E. Johnson N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10864-10869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The starting point of this approach is that the signal is a function of fractional saturation. RecA has two binding sites, and straightforward application of this method requires that the anisotropies of fluorescent oligonucleotide in sites I and II be the same. The following observation suggested that this was the case. The filament with two fluorescent oligonucleotides, RN2, (which is present when the anisotropy signal saturates in tight binding conditions) rearranged upon further addition of RecA to produce a filament with a single oligonucleotide in site I, RN1 (Fig. 2); the identification of this species as RN1 was consistent with its stability in NaCl and MgCl2 (Figs. 2 d and 3). The constant signal above saturating RecA concentrations indicates that fluorescent oligonucleotide had the same anisotropy in both filaments RN1 and RN2. Macromolecular binding density function analysis showed that the slight sigmoidal shape in the experimental binding isotherms (Fig.4 b) was a result of the nonlinear relation betweenA and θ (Fig. 5 a) and did not reflect a property of the binding process, such as cooperativity (30Kowalczykowski S.C. Leland S.P. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. McSwiggen J.A. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1226-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). During homologous recombination, RecA protein reacts with two DNA molecules, and it was proposed many years ago that the protein therefore has two functional DNA binding sites. Early studies showed that site I binds ssDNA to form a presynaptic filament and that site II binds complementary dsDNA (6Howard-Flanders P. West S.C. Stasiak A. Nature. 1984; 309: 215-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). In this model, site II would contain ssDNA after strand exchange, and tight binding of ss product DNA at this site may drive the reaction (9Mazin A.V. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10674-10678Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The amino acids corresponding to site II have been investigated. We recently observed that mutant RecA protein, RecAE207Q, with a single amino acid substitution in the L2 loop, lacked one of the two ssDNA binding sites of wild type protein; the remaining site was functional, and biochemical activities indicated that the mutant protein possessed an active primary site (20Cazaux C. Blanchet J.S. Dupuis D. Villani G. Defais M. Johnson N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28799-28804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Taken together with structural studies, cross-linking experiments, and properties of mutant RecA proteins (10–21), these results suggest that the L2 loop may be at or near the secondary binding site. The reaction between DNA and peptides representing the L2 loop has been studied (31Johnson N.P. Mazarguil H. Lopez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19675-19679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 32Selmane T. Wittung-Stafshede O. Maraboeuf F. Voloshin O.N. Norden B. Camerini-Otero D.R. Takahashi M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 30-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Here we report a thermodynamic analysis of ssDNA binding at site II of the protein. Site II can be distinguished from site I by its weaker DNA binding properties. It has previously been reported that, in the presence of ATPγS, ss oligonucleotides and E. coli ssDNA binding protein, SSB, displace ssDNA from site II of the filament but not from site I (8Mazin A.V. Kowalczykowski S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1161-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 9Mazin A.V. Kowalczykowski S.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10674-10678Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We report here evidence that ss oligonucleotide binding at site II is also more sensitive to salt than is binding at site I. Titration of RecA-oligonucleotide complexes with various salts revealed two binding modes, which differed by their stability at high salt concentrations (Figs. 2 and 3; Table I). Oligonucleotide binding at site I was shown to be insensitive to monovalent salts. Because RecA has two binding sites, 3 nt/protein monomer (Fig. 2; Refs. 1Roca A.I. Cox M.M. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1997; 56: 129-223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 7Zlotnick A. Mitchell R.S. Steed R.K. Brenner S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22525-22530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the salt-sensitive reaction corresponds to binding at site II. Quantitative binding of oligonucleotide to RecA at site I in the presence of ATPγS was not disrupted by 150 mm NaCl (Figs.2 and 3 a; Table I); therefore, in these solution conditions, when oligonucleotide concentration is sufficiently high so that free oligonucleotide is present, the concentration of unreacted RecA can be ignored, and equilibrium DNA binding can be described as a reaction between ssDNA and the presynaptic complex (Fig. 4 a). Fractional saturation was calculated from a two-state model for this equilibrium (Equation 3), assuming (1/K) ≪ N). Most of the titrations occurred in these limits, and a value for the binding constant of K = 1.5 ± 0.5 × 106m−1 gave a good fit for 3–15 μm oligonucleotide titrated with RecA at 25 °C (Figs. 4 b and 5 b). A similar binding constant was found for the reverse titration of RecA with oligonucleotide (Fig. 6). This reaction was favored by enthalpy and opposed by entropy. Similar results are reported for the reaction of single-stranded DNA-binding protein gp32 with DNA (34Kowalczykowski S.C. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 75-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). In contrast, both entropy and enthalpy contribute to the reaction of ssDNA with the herpes ssDNA-binding protein ICP8 (24Gourves A.S. Tanguy Le Gac N. Villani G. Boehmer P.E. Johnson N.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10864-10869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Displacement of positively charged counter-ions from the polynucleotide by positively charged proteins increases entropy and can stabilize protein-DNA interactions (28Record Jr., T.M. Lohman T.M. De Haseth P. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 107: 145-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (930) Google Scholar). Negative entropy indicates that this mechanism does not contribute significantly to our reaction. In support of this hypothesis, it is worth noting that the binding of ssDNA with the L2 loop peptide has only a small electrostatic contribution and is stabilized primarily by nonelectrostatic interactions (31Johnson N.P. Mazarguil H. Lopez A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19675-19679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Likewise, the different capacities of Cl− and CH3COO− anions to inhibit the reaction cannot be explained by displacement of positively charged counter-ions. Rather, these salt effects probably involve displacement of anions from the protein (33Menetski J.P. Varghese A. Kowalczykowski S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10400-10404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Kowalczykowski S.C. Lonberg N. Newport J.W. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 145: 75-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). These results imply that, in the intact presynaptic complex, anion-sensitive protein conformations or protein-protein interactions may be important for tight binding of ssDNA at site II. The techniques developed in this study should be useful for investigating the thermodynamic basis of homologous recombination. The simplest model of this reaction would be an equilibrium between a reactive filament (with ssDNA at site I and dsDNA at site II) and a product filament (with dsDNA at site I and ssDNA at site II). We report here the equilibrium constant for the reaction of ssDNA at site II of a nucleoprotein filament in which ssDNA also occupied site I. Work is in progress to extend this approach to RecA nucleoprotein filaments that are potential intermediates of the strand exchange reaction. We are grateful to Giuseppe Villani for helpful comments and discussions."

One of these is Hap46, also called BAG-1, which binds to the ATP-binding domain of hsp70 and its constitutively expressed, highly homologous counterpart hsc70, thereby affecting nucleotide binding, as well as protein folding properties, of these molecular chaperones. In an attempt to delineate the potential contact sites on hsp70/hsc70 involved in this interaction we made use of the following two independent approaches: (i) screening of membrane-bound peptide libraries based on the sequence of the ATP-binding domain and (ii) the phage-display technique with random dodecapeptides. These approaches yielded partially overlapping results and identified several possible contact regions. On the space-filling model of hsc70, the two major contact areas for Hap46 delineated in the present study are located on the same side of the molecule on either subdomain that border the central cleft harboring the nucleotide-binding site. We suggest that this bridging affects the conformation of the ATP-binding domain in a way similar to the opening of the nucleotide-binding cleft produced in the bacterial hsp70 homologue DnaK upon binding its regulatory protein GrpE.

Members of the hsp70 (70-kDa heatshock protein) family are among the most abundant soluble proteins in mammalian cells, most notably the constitutively expressed form, hsc70 (for reviews see Refs. 1Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2401) Google Scholar, 2Ellis R.J. Hartl F.-U. Curr. Opin. Struct.

They are involved in a great variety of functions,i.e. they prevent hydrophobic areas of proteins from aggregating, function in the folding and unfolding of protein structures, participate in transport into cellular organelles (4Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 5Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), deliver proteins for intracellular degradation (6Hayes S.A. Dice J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and play a role in the survival of cancer cells (7Jäättelä, M. (1999) Exp. Cell Res.30–43.Google Scholar). Often the activities of hsp70s, for example in protein folding reactions, are stimulated by hsp40 or other members of the DnaJ-like protein family (8Kelley W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Common to all hsp70 proteins is a highly conserved domain structure; the 44-kDa ATP-binding domain occupies more than the amino-terminal half of the molecule and is made up of two subdomains of about equal size and similar three-dimensional structure (9Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 10Sriram M. Osipiuk J. Freeman B.C. Morimoto R.I. Joachimiak A.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15392-15399Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Substrate binding employs the carboxyl-terminal part of the molecule that is composed of two very differently structured subdomains (12Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). One of the most interesting open questions at present is how these major hsp70 domains interact with each other to bring about the biological effects of hsp70 chaperones. Such interdomain interactions appear particularly relevant in situations when various accessory proteins are present that upon association modulate the functions of hsp70 molecular chaperones.In addition to cochaperones of the DnaJ/hsp40 family, several unrelated protein factors have been identified that specifically bind to mammalian hsp70s. The hsc70-interacting protein Hip, also called p48, was the first (13Höhfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.-U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 14Prapapanich V. Chen S. Nair S.C. Rimermann R.A. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 420-431PubMed Google Scholar). The hsp70/hsc70-associating protein Hap46, also known as BAG-1, has originally been detected by interaction screening approaches using as bait a nuclear receptor, the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, or a membrane receptor of the tyrosine kinase family (15Zeiner M.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 19Zeiner M. Gebauer M. Gehring U. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5483-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 20Takayama S.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Third is the hsp70-interacting protein HspBP1 (22Raynes D.A. Guerriero V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32883-32888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 23Raynes D.A. Guerriero V. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1490: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). All these factors are known to interact with the ATP-binding domain of hsp70 chaperones and have been found to affect their biochemical activities, albeit in different ways. By contrast, the carboxyl-terminal domain of hsp70s is involved in interactions with the hsp70/hsp90-organizing protein Hop/p60 (18Gebauer M. Zeiner M. Gehring U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 24Gebauer M. Zeiner M. Gehring U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6238-6244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 25Demand J. Lüders J. Höhfeld J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2023-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and the carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein CHIP (26Ballinger C.A. Connell P. Wu Y. Hu Z. Thompson L.J. Yin L.-Y. Patterson C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, DnaJ/hsp40 and CHIP affect the ATPase activity of hsp70s even though they bind to the distally located carboxyl-terminal part (18Gebauer M. Zeiner M. Gehring U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 25Demand J. Lüders J. Höhfeld J. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1999; 19: 4535-4545Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Moreover, the interaction of Hop/p60 is inhibited when Hap46 binds to the amino-terminal domain of hsc70 (24Gebauer M. Zeiner M. Gehring U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6238-6244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that there are intricate interrelationships between hsp70 domains and the proteins associating with them.In an attempt to achieve a better understanding of the molecular interactions between hsp70s and their accessory proteins we investigated the ATP-binding domain of mammalian hsc70 for contact sites with Hap46. To this end, we employed as complementary approaches (i) screening of membrane-bound peptides covering the sequence of the ATP-binding domain of hsc70 and (ii) the phage-display technique using random peptide libraries. Several potential contact sites were detected by these independent techniques. Our data suggest that Hap46 binds to hsc70 from one side of the ATP-binding domain by making use of two major contact areas.DISCUSSIONOver the past few years, Hap46/BAG-1 proteins have been described to associate with an enormous variety of completely unrelated mammalian proteins, like nuclear receptors and other transcription factors (15Zeiner M.

Chem. 2000; 275: 4613-4617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). However, the majority of these interactions appear to be mediated by molecular chaperones of the hsp70 type, which have the ability to promiscuously associate with all kinds of proteins, in particular if these are partially misfolded and/or contain hydrophobic areas exposed at the surface. On the other hand, Hap46 has also been established as a DNA-binding protein that has the potential to stimulate transcription (47Zeiner M. Niyaz Y. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10194-10199Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The amino-terminal end of Hap46, which contains clusters of positively charged amino acids, is involved in this activity (47Zeiner M. Niyaz Y. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10194-10199Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). By contrast, the carboxyl-terminal portion of Hap46/BAG-1 has been shown to be required for the interaction with hsp70s (20Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime-Sempe C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.I. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4887-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 32Takayama S. Xie Z. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 781-78633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). However, on the part of hsp70s, the interaction sites are rather ill-defined. In Far-Western blots both subdomains I and II of the ATP-binding domain of human hsp70 reacted with Hap46, but in the yeast two-hybrid system only one of these subdomains gave a positive result (18Gebauer M. Zeiner M. Gehring U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We therefore now turned to alternative and more sensitive methods with the aim of obtaining more detailed information about the contact areas within the ATP-binding domain of hsp70/hsc70.Membrane-bound peptide libraries designed according to the amino acid sequence of the ATP-binding domain of human hsc70 were screened with Hap46 and specific monoclonal antibodies. This resulted in detection of several potential regions of strong interactions (cf. TableI). All of these potential contact regions, depicted in bluein Fig. 2, are located on one side of the ATP-binding domain, except for region II, which is on the other side of the molecule (Fig. 2, panel B). We consider the latter region as unlikely to be of any significance for binding of Hap46 because of the fact that it contains a Trp residue and that tryptophanes were found to trigger artifactual protein-protein interaction, as described above. In any event, the peptide-scanning method is able to detect clusters of amino acids, probably because of the fact that a large number of peptide molecules is present in a single spot on the membrane in a densely packed array. Indeed, some of the potential contact regions obtained by peptide scanning look like patches on the surface of hsc70 (cf. Fig. 2)In a complementary approach, we used the phage-display technique with a random dodecapeptide library. In contrast to peptide scanning, phage M13 presents only a maximum of five peptide copies on the tip of each particle. Furthermore, detection of interaction sites is restricted by the limited complexity of the phage library itself, in particular if rather long polypeptide stretches are inserted, as in our study. In addition, a multitude of parameters (e.g. target concentration, phage valency, degree of background binding, and selection stringency) are known to greatly influence the panning procedure such that eventually only one binder may dominate the population of enriched phages (48Levitan B. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 893-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the phage-display technique may uncover rather complex interaction areas that would never show up as such in the peptide-scanning approach. This was indeed the case with region A (cf. Fig.2 H). It is a split epitope in that it is not contiguous within the amino acid sequence of hsp70 or hsc70, and the two polypeptide segments comprising it are of opposite polarity. On the surface of hsc70, region A represents an elongated array of amino acid residues (cf. Fig. 2 H).In the model of Fig. 3, we combined the results obtained with the membrane-bound peptide-scanning and phage-display techniques and show the ATP-binding domain of hsc70 in a front view (A) and turned around by roughly 90° (B). This presentation clearly shows that all interaction regions are on one side of the molecule, except for region II, which remains questionable (see above). The fact that the other side is void of interaction sites suggests specificity. Interestingly, region A identified by phage display overlaps on either end with regions I and IV obtained by peptide scanning (cf. Fig. 3, A andB). Regions A, I, and IV, together with neighboring region III, form a distinct structure including a prominent protuberance, best seen in Fig.3 B. We think that this area on the surface of hsc70 within subdomain I is very well suited for protein-protein interactions as it represents a remarkable structural feature and thus stands out as a major site of contact with Hap46. A second area of significant interaction is defined by regions V and VIlocated on subdomain II, i.e. on the other side of the central cleft of the ATP-binding domain. Located in between these major areas of contact but positioned somewhat to the lower portion of subdomain II is region VII (Fig. 3 A), which possibly contributes to a much lesser degree to the interaction with Hap46. Nevertheless, it is astonishing at first glance that interaction with Hap46 should involve such large surface areas of hsp70/hsc70, as outlined in Fig. 3, located on the same side of the molecule.The above considerations lead us to compare the potential contact areas on mammalian hsc70 for the associating protein Hap46 with the interaction sites on the ATP-binding domain of the bacterial hsp70 counterpart DnaK for its respective regulatory factor GrpE. These were established by x-ray structural analysis of the complex and showed several areas of close contact (49Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F.-U. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar) covering a significant surface area on one side of the molecule. The two largest of them are on the upper portions of subdomains I and II, respectively, on each side of the central cleft of the ATP-binding domain. Binding of GrpE was thus shown to produce a torsion of subdomain II with a relative opening of the cleft that harbors the ATP-binding site (49Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F.-U. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). This readily explained the large stimulation of the ADP/ATP exchange on DnaK upon association with GrpE (49Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F.-U. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar, 50Packschies L. Theyssen H. Buchberger A. Bukau B. Goody R.S. Reinstein J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3417-3422Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The experiments described in the present study disclosed two major contact areas on hsc70 for the associating factor Hap46, located on the same side of the ATP-binding domain. One of these (combined regions A, I, and IV) corresponds in parts to some of the contact areas on DnaK for binding of GrpE (49Harrison C.J. Hayer-Hartl M. Di Liberto M. Hartl F.-U. Kuriyan J. Science. 1997; 276: 431-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), as depicted in the side by side views of Fig.4. Most of the amino acid residues exposed to the respective surfaces are different with the exception of the peptide sequence Tyr-Leu-Gly within region IV, as highlighted in Fig. 5. The second contact area on hsc70 (regions V and VI) shows a limited degree of topological overlap with DnaK on the space-filling model (Fig. 4) but no similarities within the respective polypeptide sequences (Fig. 5). As the comparison of Fig. 4 shows, Hap46 and GrpE touch hsc70 and DnaK, respectively, at somewhat different areas on subdomain II. These differences are consistent with the fact that GrpE and Hap46 have no significant homologies in sequence and Hap46 does not bind to DnaK (19Zeiner M. Gebauer M. Gehring U. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5483-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), whereas GrpE is unable to interact with hsc70, 2B. Bukau, personal communication. just as antibiotic insect peptides bind to DnaK but not to eukaryotic hsp70 (51Otvos L. Insug O. Rogers M.E. Consolvo P.J. Condie B.A. Lovas S. Bulet P. Blaszczyk-Thurin M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14150-14159Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, we expect that Hap46 binding produces a similar opening of the central cleft in the ATP-binding domain of mammalian hsp70/hsc70, probably by grasping it on either subdomain, as GrpE does. In fact, the position of region V (Fig. 4 B) suggests that Hap46 partially reaches into the central cleft for binding. Recently, an alternative three-dimensional structure of the hsp70 ATP-binding domain has been identified that shows a distinct outward shift of the upper part of subdomain II (52Osipiuk J. Walsh M.A. Freeman B.C. Morimoto R.I. Joachimiak A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1105-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Binding of Hap46 to the hsp70/hsc70 molecular chaperone may then favor this more open conformation, which, however, can only be proven by a detailed analysis of crystals of the hsc70·Hap46 complex. Hap46 has been shown to enhance the nucleotide exchange reaction of hsc70 (21Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 24Gebauer M. Zeiner M. Gehring U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6238-6244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and in this respect it resembles GrpE. However, GrpE and Hap46 are certainly not equivalent regulators of hsp70 chaperones, as the former greatly stimulates protein refolding reactions involving DnaK in combination with DnaJ (49Harrison C.J.

Thus Hip/p48 was found to stabilize the ADP-bound state and to increase the refolding of a denatured model protein by hsc70 in concert with hsp40 (13Höhfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.-U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar) whereas Hap46 increases the exchange of ATP for ADP prebound to hsc70 and accelerates the hydrolysis of ATP in the presence of hsp40 (21Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 24Gebauer M. Zeiner M. Gehring U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6238-6244Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, Hap46 and Hip/p48 compete for binding to the ATP-binding domain (18Gebauer M. Zeiner M. Gehring U. FEBS Lett. 1997; 417: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar,21Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). Like Hap46, the accessory protein HspBP1 inhibits protein refolding mediated by hsp70 but, in contrast to Hap46, decreases ATP binding and inhibits the ATPase activity of hsp70 (22Raynes D.A. Guerriero V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32883-32888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the hsp70-binding proteins Hap46, Hip/p48, and HspBP1 interact very differently with the ATP-binding domain of hsp70s. It will thus be interesting to find out more about the contact sites for Hip/p48 and HspBP1 and to compare them with those described here for interaction with Hap46. Members of the hsp70 (70-kDa heatshock protein) family are among the most abundant soluble proteins in mammalian cells, most notably the constitutively expressed form, hsc70 (for reviews see Refs. 1Bukau B.

They are involved in a great variety of functions,i.e. they prevent hydrophobic areas of proteins from aggregating, function in the folding and unfolding of protein structures, participate in transport into cellular organelles (4Schatz G. Dobberstein B. Science. 1996; 271: 1519-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 5Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar), deliver proteins for intracellular degradation (6Hayes S.A. Dice J.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 255-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and play a role in the survival of cancer cells (7Jäättelä, M. (1999) Exp. Cell Res.30–43.Google Scholar). Often the activities of hsp70s, for example in protein folding reactions, are stimulated by hsp40 or other members of the DnaJ-like protein family (8Kelley W.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 222-227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Common to all hsp70 proteins is a highly conserved domain structure; the 44-kDa ATP-binding domain occupies more than the amino-terminal half of the molecule and is made up of two subdomains of about equal size and similar three-dimensional structure (9Flaherty K.M. DeLuca-Flaherty C. McKay D.B. Nature. 1990; 346: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar, 10Sriram M. Osipiuk J. Freeman B.C. Morimoto R.I. Joachimiak A.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15392-15399Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Substrate binding employs the carboxyl-terminal part of the molecule that is composed of two very differently structured subdomains (12Zhu X. Zhao X. Burkholder W.F. Gragerov A. Ogata C.M. Gottesman M.E. Hendrickson W.A. Science. 1996; 272: 1606-1614Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). One of the most interesting open questions at present is how these major hsp70 domains interact with each other to bring about the biological effects of hsp70 chaperones. Such interdomain interactions appear particularly relevant in situations when various accessory proteins are present that upon association modulate the functions of hsp70 molecular chaperones. In addition to cochaperones of the DnaJ/hsp40 family, several unrelated protein factors have been identified that specifically bind to mammalian hsp70s. The hsc70-interacting protein Hip, also called p48, was the first (13Höhfeld J. Minami Y. Hartl F.-U. Cell. 1995; 83: 589-598Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar, 14Prapapanich V. Chen S. Nair S.C. Rimermann R.A. Smith D.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 420-431PubMed Google Scholar). The hsp70/hsc70-associating protein Hap46, also known as BAG-1, has originally been detected by interaction screening approaches using as bait a nuclear receptor, the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, or a membrane receptor of the tyrosine kinase family (15Zeiner M.

One such signal is delivered via CD40; for instance, ligation of CD40 rescues B cells from BCR-induced apoptosis. Here we show that, in contrast to WEHI-231 cells, CD40 ligation did not reverse BCR-induced growth inhibition in the BAL-17 mature B cell line and CD40 ligation itself inhibited proliferation. This inhibitory signaling was not observed in CD45-deficient cells. Further analyses demonstrate that transfection of dominant-negative form of SEK1 or treatment with SB203580 strongly reduced CD40-induced inhibition of BAL-17 proliferation, suggesting a requirement for c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38 in CD40-induced inhibition of proliferation. Interestingly, CD40-initiated activation of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase and p38 was enhanced and sustained in CD45-deficient cells, and these phenotypes were reversed by transfecting CD45 gene. However, CD40-mediated induction of cell surface molecules was not affected in CD45-deficient cells.

Thus, CD40 may transmit both positive and negative signals depending upon the cell type, implying a complex regulation of CD40 signal transduction. Numerous studies have been performed in determining specific pathways of CD40-initiated positive signaling. CD40 ligation has been demonstrated to activate several different signaling pathways, for example, activation of tyrosine kinases (Lyn, Fyn, and Syk), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipase C-γ2, Jak3-signal transducer and activators of transcription 3, and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) (16Faris M.

Three MAPK members have been identified: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK, or stress-activated protein kinase), and the p38 MAPK. Although CD40-mediated activation of ERK is dependent on the cell types, JNK and p38 are activated in B cells and B cell lines by ligation via CD40 (30Berberich I. Shu G. Siebelt F. Woodgett J.R.

Shu G. Graves J.D. Saklatvala J. Krebs E.G. Clark E.A. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3225-3236PubMed Google Scholar). However, the molecular basis for the negative effects of CD40 remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we show that, in contrast to WEHI-231 cells, BCR-induced growth inhibition was not rescued by CD40 ligation in BAL-17 cells; indeed, CD40 ligation itself inhibited proliferation of BAL-17 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Significantly, in CD45-deficient cells, the CD40-induced inhibition of proliferation was not observed and activation of JNK and p38 was enhanced and sustained. The phenotype of CD45-deficient cells was reversed by transfecting CD45 cDNA, suggesting a decisive role for CD45 in these processes. Further analyses revealed that transfection of dominant-negative form of SEK1 into BAL-17 or treatment with a p38-specific inhibitor reduced CD40-induced inhibition of proliferation, suggesting that activation of JNK or p38 is crucial to CD40-initiated proliferative regulation. Additionally, induction of cell surface molecules upon CD40 ligation was not affected in CD45-deficient cells. Thus, these results suggest that CD45 critically regulates selective sets of signaling events induced by CD40 ligation, determining the fate of BAL-17 cells. The WEHI-231 and BAL-17 murine B cell lines and the BAL-17-derived, CD45-deficient clone 44 were all described previously (35Ogimoto M. Katagiri T. Mashima K. Hasegawa K. Mizuno K. Yakura H. Int.

All cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 50 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin (complete medium). Rat anti-mouse CD40 mAb (FGK46.5) was a gift from Dr. A. Rolink (Basel Institute for Immunology, Basel, Switzerland). F(ab′)2 fragments of goat anti-mouse IgM antibody (Ab) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated (FL) goat anti-IgM Ab were purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Aurora, OH). Rabbit polyclonal Abs against c-Src, ERK, JNK, and p38 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-phospho-JNK Ab and anti-phospho-p38 Ab were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI) and New England Biolab (Beverly, MA), respectively. FL-anti-mouse CD54 mAb, biotin-conjugated anti-mouse CD80 mAb, FL-anti-mouse CD86 mAb, and biotin-conjugated anti-mouse CD95 mAb were purchased from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Anti-I-Ad mAb (MK-D6) was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), and anti-mouse CD45 mAb (104) has been described elsewhere (37Yakura H. Shen F.-W. Bourcet E. Boyse E.A. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 157: 1077-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). SB203580 was obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Corp. (La Jolla, CA). Proliferation assay was performed as previously described (35Ogimoto M. Katagiri T. Mashima K. Hasegawa K. Mizuno K. Yakura H. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 36Ogimoto M. Katagiri T. Mashima K. Hasegawa K. Mizuno K. Yakura H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2265-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5–10 × 103cells were cultured in triplicates in 0.2 ml of complete medium with or without anti-CD40 mAb or anti-IgM Ab for 24–48 h. To assess DNA synthesis, 0.5 μCi (18.5 kBq) of [3H]thymidine were added to each well for the last 4 h. The cells were harvested on glassfiber filters with a semiautomatic Skatron harvester, and thymidine incorporation was measured using a Beckman liquid scintillation counter. To examine surface phenotypes, cells were incubated with specific Abs for 15 min on ice, washed, and incubated with FL-secondary Abs for 15 min on ice. FL-protein A (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Ltd., Uppsala, Sweden), FL-mouse anti-rat Igκ chain mAb (Zymed Laboratories Inc., San Francisco, CA) and FL-avidin (ICN Pharmaceuticals) were used as secondary Abs. The FL-labeled cells were then analyzed with an Epics ELITE flow cytometer (Coulter, Miami, FL). For induction of membrane protein expression, 5 × 104 cells were stimulated with anti-CD40 mAb for 2 days before staining. To introduce DNA into cells, 2 × 107 cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and suspended with 0.4 ml of cytomix buffer (120 mm KCl, 0.15 mm CaCl2, 10 mmK2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 7.6, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 2 mm EGTA, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, and 5 mm glutathione) containing 40 μg of DNA, and electroporated at 264 V, 950 microfarads. DNAs introduced were: the pcDLSRα expression vector containing Src-CD45 (a chimeric cDNA encoding the intracellular murine CD45 preceded by a short amino-terminal sequence from p60c-src) (38Volarevic S. Niklinska B.B. Burns C.M. June C.H. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 1993; 260: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) or the pcDLSRα empty vector (a gift from Dr. Y. Minami, Kobe University, Kobe, Japan), and pEFII expression vector containing a gene encoding a hemagglutinin-tagged dominant-negative SEK1 mutant (SEK-AL) (39Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) (a gift of Dr. Jim Woodgett, Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Canada), which had been excised from pcDNA3 Zeo, or the empty vector (a gift from Dr. G. Koretzky, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA). The cells were then resuspended in complete medium and incubated for 24–36 h. After removing dead cells by using Lympholyte-M (Cedarlane, Ontario, Canada), the remaining cells were subjected to functional assays. After incubation in complete medium for 1 h at 37 °C, 5–10 × 106 cells were stimulated with anti-CD40 mAb or anti-IgM Ab. The reactions were terminated with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm Na3VO4 and 2 mmEDTA. The cells were centrifuged and solubilized in lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 2 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The supernatants were separated on 7.5–10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were incubated with specific Abs for overnight at 4 °C in 0.5% gelatin-Tris buffered saline (20 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl) and then incubated with the corresponding secondary Abs for 1 h; secondary Abs included alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad), alkaline phosphatase-conjugated mouse anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc., West Grove, PA), horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, and HRP-conjugated swine anti-goat IgG (BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA). The membranes were visualized using alkaline phosphatase-conjugate substrate kit (Bio-Rad) or ECL detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Activation of JNK and p38 was examined by immunoblot analysis with rabbit anti-phospho-JNK and anti-phospho-p38 Abs. The protein amount of JNK and p38 was assessed by immunoblot with anti-JNK and anti-p38 Abs. To assess JNK activity, lysates were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with glutathioneS-transferase-c-Jun-Sepharose. The resultant precipitates were washed three times with a washing buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Triton X-100) and then rinsed once with kinase reaction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 20 mm MgCl2, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, and 2 mm dithiothreitol). The kinase reactions were elicited in 40 μl of the reaction buffer containing 20 μm cold ATP and 5 μCi (185 kBq) of [32P]ATP. The reactions were stopped by adding Laemmli sample buffer and boiling for 5 min. The samples were then separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and subjected to autoradiography. The signals were quantified as a function of the density of the bands using a Bio-Rad Imaging Densitometer; measurements were normalized to the quantities of proteins applied. To elucidate the function of CD40 in B cell signaling, we examined how CD40 ligation affects B cell behaviors using mature B cell line BAL-17, as compared with immature B cell line WEHI-231. WEHI-231 and BAL-17 cells were cultured with 1–20 μg/ml anti-CD40 mAb in the presence or absence of F(ab′)2 fragments of anti-IgM Ab for 48 h, and DNA synthesis was assayed. As shown in Fig.1, stimulation with 1–20 μg/ml anti-CD40 mAb did not significantly affect the proliferative capacity of WEHI-231 cells and completely reversed anti-IgM-induced growth arrest, as reported previously (9Tsubata T. Wu J. Honjo T. Nature. 1993; 364: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In BAL-17 cells, by contrast, anti-CD40 mAb stimulation did not rescue cells in anti-IgM-induced growth inhibition, but actually enhanced it. Moreover, CD40 ligation itself significantly and dose-dependently inhibited DNA synthesis of BAL-17 cells (Fig. 1). CD40 ligation is known to inhibit proliferation not only in B lineage cells (10Inui S. Kaisho T. Kikutani H. Stamenkovic I. Seed B. Clark E.A. Kishimoto T. Eur. J.

Med. 1996; 183: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 14Eliopoulos A.G. Dawson C.W. Mosialos G. Floettmann J.E. Rowe M. Armitage R.J. Dawson J. Zapata J.M. Kerr D.J. Wakelam M.J.O.

Schmitt D. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 144-152PubMed Google Scholar). However, mechanisms underlying these phenomena are still not completely understood. We attempted to examine the role of CD45 in CD40-mediated signaling in BAL-17 cells. For this purpose, we utilized a CD45-deficient clone previously generated from BAL-17 cells (36Ogimoto M. Katagiri T. Mashima K. Hasegawa K. Mizuno K. Yakura H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2265-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Flow cytometric analysis showed that, in clone 44 cells, expression of CD45 was completely absent, but that surface IgM levels and CD40 expression were comparable to those of the parent cells (Fig.2). Expression of other molecules including sIgD, MHC class I and class II, Src family protein-tyrosine kinases (Lyn, Fyn, Blk, Lck), and Syk was also comparable in clone 44 to that in parental cells (36Ogimoto M. Katagiri T. Mashima K. Hasegawa K. Mizuno K. Yakura H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2265-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). No significant differences in protein tyrosine phosphorylation induced by CD40 ligation were observed between BAL-17 and clone 44 cells (data not shown). We first asked whether CD40-evoked inhibition of DNA synthesis was observed in CD45-deficient, clone 44 cells, and as shown in Fig. 1, anti-CD40 mAb had no effect on their proliferation. In WEHI-231 cells, however, CD40-mediated effects on proliferation were not altered in CD45-deficient cells (data not shown). To confirm that the effect of anti-CD40 mAb in BAL-17 cells was mediated by CD45, we transiently transfected Src-CD45 cDNA or an empty vector back into clone 44 cells. We used Src-CD45 cDNA, because it has been demonstrated that Src-CD45 is sufficient for reconstituting the function of CD45-deficient T cell clones (38Volarevic S. Niklinska B.B. Burns C.M. June C.H. Weissman A.M. Ashwell J.D. Science. 1993; 260: 541-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and is more efficiently expressed than the full length. The transfectants efficiently expressed the CD45, as assessed by immunoblotting with anti-c-Src Ab (Fig.3 B). Control transfection with a vector containing enhanced green fluorescence protein revealed that transfection efficiency was 25–30%. Once CD45 gene was transfected, clone 44 cells were as susceptible to CD40-induced inhibition of proliferation as were BAL-17 cells (Fig. 3 A). Thus, in contrast to WEHI-231 cells, where CD40 transmits positive signals thereby reversing BCR-induced growth inhibition, in BAL-17 cells, CD40 exerts a negative effect on proliferation and on BCR-induced growth inhibition. More significantly, the data show that CD40-induced inhibition of BAL-17 proliferation was mediated through CD45. CD40 ligation by CD40 mAb has been shown to up-regulate a variety of cell surface molecules. Therefore, to investigate signaling pathways governed by CD45, we first examined the capacity of anti-CD40 mAb to induce cell surface molecules on BAL-17 and clone 44 cells. When the cells were cultured with 10 μg/ml anti-CD40 mAb for 2 days and changes in the expression of CD54, CD80, CD86, CD95, and I-A molecules were assessed by flow cytometry, no difference in the degree to which these molecules were up-regulated by CD40 ligation in CD45-positive and CD45-deficient cells were found (Table I). In addition, reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that induction of the dual-specificity phosphatase, Pac-1, was also not significantly different in BAL-17 and clone 44 cells (data not shown).Table IAnti-CD40-mediated induction of cell surface molecules in BAL-17 and its CD45-deficient cloneCD40 stimulationBAL-17Clone 44(−)(+)(−)(+)CD54 (ICAM-1)12.433.910.337.9CD80 (B7–1)7.311.99.013.8CD86 (B7–2)3.63.71.51.7CD95 (Fas)8.519.214.228.6I-Ad7.817.19.128.8BAL-17 cells and its CD45-deficient clone 44 were cultured for 2 days in the presence (+) or absence (−) of 10 μg/ml anti-CD40 mAb. After culture, cells were labeled with mAbs against CD54, CD80, CD86, CD95, and I-Ad, and then subjected to flow cytometric analysis. The results are expressed as mean fluorescence intensities and are representative of three separate experiments. Open table in a new tab BAL-17 cells and its CD45-deficient clone 44 were cultured for 2 days in the presence (+) or absence (−) of 10 μg/ml anti-CD40 mAb. After culture, cells were labeled with mAbs against CD54, CD80, CD86, CD95, and I-Ad, and then subjected to flow cytometric analysis. The results are expressed as mean fluorescence intensities and are representative of three separate experiments. To examine the extent to which CD45 regulates activation of MAPK family members, BAL-17 and clone 44 cells were cultured with 10 μg/ml anti-CD40 mAb for 5–60 min, and the lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with Abs against phosphorylated (activated) forms of ERK, JNK, and p38. CD40 ligation only marginally elevated ERK activation in BAL-17 cells (data not shown). However, as shown in Fig.4 A, CD40 ligation induced activation of JNK with a peak at 10 min in BAL-17. Significantly, CD40-induced activation of JNK was enhanced and sustained in clone 44 (Fig. 4 A). CD40 ligation also induced p38 activation in BAL-17 with a peak at 5 min. In CD45-deficient cells, however, activation peak was shifted to 20 min (Fig. 4 B). Thus CD45 appears to attenuate CD40-mediated activation of both JNK and p38, particularly at later phases. To further confirm that this negative effect is exerted by CD45, Src-CD45 cDNA was introduced into clone 44 cells (Fig.5). Twenty-four hours later, the transfected cells were cultured with 10 μg/ml CD40 mAb, after which the activation of JNK and p38 was assayed by kinase assays with glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun as a substrate and immunoblotting with anti-phospho-p38 Ab, respectively. As shown in Fig.5 A, in CD45 transfectants, enhanced CD40-mediated JNK activation was reduced to the level seen in BAL-17, whereas cells transfected with an empty vector were minimally affected. It was also observed that activation of p38 in CD45-deficient cells was decreased to the level of parental cells by transfecting CD45 cDNA (Fig.5 B). These results suggest that CD45 indeed exerts negative effects on CD40-induced activation of JNK and p38. To evaluate the direct contribution of JNK and p38 to CD40-induced inhibition of proliferation, BAL-17 cells were transfected with a plasmid containing a dominant-negative form of SEK1 (DN-SEK1) (39Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), an upstream activator of JNK, or an empty vector. Twenty-four hours later, the transfected cells were cultured with anti-CD40 mAb, and DNA synthesis and activation of JNK were assayed. Densitometric analysis revealed that introduction of DN-SEK1 reduced activation of JNK1 and JNK2 by 52% and 70%, respectively, as compared with vector control (Fig. 6 A). Under this condition, inhibition of DNA synthesis was also significantly attenuated in transfectants of DN-SEK1 but not in cells transfected with an empty vector (Fig. 6 B). We then examined the role of p38 using a specific inhibitor for p38, SB203580. BAL-17 cells were cultured with 5–20 μmSB203580 for 1 h, after which the inhibitor was removed and DNA synthesis of pretreated cells was assessed at 24 h after CD40 ligation. As shown in Fig. 6 C, the treatment with a p38-specific inhibitor blocked CD40-induced inhibition of proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Activation of p38 was inhibited 10%, 35%, and 50% by 5, 10, and 20 μm SB203580, respectively, as revealed by Western blot analysis with anti-phospho-p38 Ab (data not shown). Taken together, activation of JNK and p38 is required for CD40-initiated inhibition of proliferation in BAL-17 cells. There have been several reports that negative signaling evoked by CD40 ligation inhibits proliferation of B lymphoma cells (10Inui S. Kaisho T. Kikutani H. Stamenkovic I. Seed B. Clark E.A. Kishimoto T. Eur. J. Immunol. 1990; 20: 1747-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 11Heath A.W. Chang R. Harada N. Santos-Argumedo L. Gordon J. Hannum C. Campbell D. Shanafelt A.B.

Fanslow W.C. Spriggs M.K. Murphy W.J. Blood. 1994; 83: 2787-2794Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, compared with the role played by CD40 in B cell survival and rescue from apoptosis, the molecular mechanisms by which CD40 inhibits proliferation have not been extensively studied. In the present study, we demonstrated that, in contrast to WEHI-231 cells, CD40 ligation in the mature BAL-17 cells does not reverse BCR-initiated inhibition of proliferation, but instead inhibits proliferation further (Fig. 1). Interestingly, CD40 ligation itself induced inhibition of BAL-17 cell proliferation and such inhibition was not observed in CD45-deficient clone 44 cells (Fig. 1). Transfection of the CD45 gene into the clone reversed this phenotype (Fig. 3), indicating a decisive role for CD45 in CD40-induced inhibition of BAL-17 cell proliferation. To elucidate the mechanisms by which CD45 exerts its regulatory effects on CD40-induced inhibition of proliferation, we examined several signaling events mediated by CD40 ligation in BAL-17 and its CD45-deficient clone. As one of the activation events, CD40 ligation by anti-CD40 mAb was shown to up-regulate a number of cell surface molecules (24Lederman S. Yellin M.J. Inghirami G. Lee J.J. Knowles D.M. Chess L. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 3817-3826PubMed Google Scholar, 25Barrett T.B. Shu G. Clark E.A. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1722-1729PubMed Google Scholar, 26Ranheim E.A. Kipps T.J. J. Exp.

Immunol. 1994; 6: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and our findings suggest that CD45 is not involved in the CD40-induced up-regulation of CD54, CD80, CD86, CD95, and MHC class II (Table I). On the other hand, CD40-mediated activation of JNK and p38 was augmented and sustained in the CD45-deficient clone (Fig.4), and introduction of the CD45 gene resulted in recovery of the parental phenotype (Fig. 5). Thus, CD45 negatively regulates CD40-mediated activation of JNK and p38 in BAL-17 cells. The question now arises as to whether activation of JNK and p38 directly contributes to CD40-induced inhibition of proliferation in BAL-17 cells. Our results showed that inhibition of JNK and p38, respectively, by transfecting DN-SEK1 into BAL-17 cells and treatment with a p38-specific inhibitor, SB203580, blocks proliferation inhibition triggered by anti-CD40 mAb (Fig. 6), suggesting that activation of JNK or p38 is required for CD40-initiated inhibition of proliferation in BAL-17 cells. Given that CD40 ligation did not induce inhibition of proliferation in clone 44 cells, where JNK and p38 activities were enhanced and sustained, it is possible that the level and duration of JNK and p38 activation may need to fall within a narrow window for optimal CD40 signaling, meaning that CD40-induced inhibition of proliferation would be blocked when JNK and p38 are activated either above or below a certain threshold at a certain time. It has been shown that activation of JNK by CD40 ligation requires TRAF2 (40Reinhard C. Shamoon B. Shyamala V. Williams L.T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1080-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, 41Lee S.Y. Reichlin A. Santana A. Sokol K.A. Nussenzweig M.C. Choi Y. Immunity. 1997; 7: 703-713Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). One signaling cascade leading to JNK activation is believed to proceed from membrane proximal molecule, Rac → MEKK1 → SEK1/MKK4 → JNK; where and how the signal from TRAF2 converges into this pathway is still unknown. The signal from CD40 is also capable of activating NF-κB through TRAF2 and NF-κB inducing kinase to the IκB kinase/IκB complex (20Rothe M. Sarma V. Dixit V.M. Goeddel D.V.

Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar). In addition, MEKK1 has been reported to be a common upstream activator of both JNK and NF-κB (45Lee F.S. Hagler J. Chen Z.J. Maniatis T. Cell. 1997; 88: 213-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). It is thus also possible that CD45-generated signals leading to proliferation inhibition may not be mediated solely by JNK or p38 but by a concerted action of multiple signaling molecules including MAPKs and NF-κB, for example. Role of CD45 in CD40 signaling has been investigated previously using CD45 mAb. One such study demonstrated that cross-linking CD45 inhibits CD40-induced proliferation of human peripheral blood B cells and small tonsillar B cells, but has no effect on large tonsillar B cells (46Gruber M.F. Bjorndahl J.M. Nakamura S. Fu S.M. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 4144-4152PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that CD45 exerts its inhibitory effects on CD40-induced growth regulation in a cell type-dependent manner. Another study showed that CD45 mAb blocked tyrosine phosphorylation evoked by CD40 ligation in human Raji cells (16Faris M. Gaskin F. Parsons J.T. Fu S.M. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 179: 1923-1931Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, these experiments do not enable one to draw any conclusion as to how CD45 may affect CD40 signaling. It was reported recently that CD40-induced proliferation was partially impaired in splenic B cells isolated from CD45 knockout mice (47Byth K.F. Conroy L.A. Howlett S. Smith A.J.H. May J. Alexander D.R. Holmes N. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1707-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Given that CD45 is not involved in the regulation of CD40 signaling in WEHI-231 cells, the effect of CD45 on CD40 signaling may be dependent on the cell type or the maturational stage of B cells. One possible factor for differential effects is NF-κB. The NF-κB complexes in WEHI-231 and BAL-17 cells consist predominantly of c-Rel/p50 (48Miyamoto S. Chiao P.J. Verma I.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3276-3282Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and c-Rel/p65, 2Y. Arimura and H. Yakura, unpublished data. respectively, and the specific combination of NF-κB family members may strongly affect total transcriptional activity. Indeed, transcriptional activity was different between WEHI-231 and BAL-17 cells.2 Additionally, our preliminary studies indicate that CD40 ligation-mediated recruitment of TRAFs differs in WEHI-231 and BAL-17 cells. These differences may contribute to the final outcome of CD40 signaling in the two cell lines. In summary, our results demonstrate that, in mature BAL-17 B cells, CD40-mediated signaling is unable to reverse BCR-induced inhibition of proliferation, and that CD40 ligation itself inhibits proliferation. Such inhibition is strictly regulated by CD45. Furthermore, CD40-initiated growth inhibition is mediated through activation of JNK and p38 MAPK, and CD40-induced activation of JNK and p38, but not induction of cell surface molecules, is under strict control of CD45. Thus, CD45 is involved in the regulation of selective sets of CD40-induced signaling pathways, determining the final outcome of BAL-17 B cells. We thank Dr. A. Rolink for anti-CD40 mAb, Dr. J.

To understand the initial steps involved in the GutR-mediated transcription activation process and the physiological roles of glucitol, GutR was overproduced and purified. In the absence of glucitol, GutR exists as a monomer and binds directly to its binding site in the gut regulatory region. This binding site was mapped to a 29-base pair imperfect inverted repeat located between −78 and −50, and there is only one GutR binding site within the regulatory region. The kinetic parameters of the interaction between GutR and its binding site were monitored in real time using surface plasmon resonance. The half-life of the GutR-DNA complex in the absence of glucitol was estimated to be 6.8 min. In contrast, in the presence of glucitol, the half-life of the complex was extended to longer than 19 h by affecting only the off-rate but not the on-rate. This effect is glucitol-specific. These data indicate that glucitol binds to GutR and induces GutR to have an extremely tight binding at its binding site. The physiological relevance of this process in transcription activation is discussed. Glucitol induction in Bacillus subtilis requires a transcription activator, GutR, and a sequence located upstream of the gut promoter.

The physiological relevance of this process in transcription activation is discussed. base pair polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction glucitolutilization With the addition of glucitol to Bacillus subtilis, a set of glucitol-inducible genes is selectively turned on (1Chalumeau H. Delobbe A. Gay P. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 921-928Crossref Google Scholar). These inducible genes include gutA- and gutB-encoding glucitol permease and glucitol dehydrogenase, respectively. They are the members of the gut (glucitolutilization) operon and are arranged in the order fromgutB to gutA. This operon is subject to both negative and positive regulations at the transcription level with the positive regulation playing a major role in the induction process. The regulatory region of the gut operon can be divided into three parts (2Ye R. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3314-3320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The central portion is an unusual promoter with its −10 and −35 elements similar to those recognized by the major RNA polymerase (EςA) separated from each other by a 15-bp1 spacer rather than a typical 17-bp spacer. An inverted repeat sequence located downstream of the promoter serves as a negative regulatory element (2Ye R. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3314-3320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although deletion of this sequence does not result in the constitutive expression of the gut operon in the absence of glucitol, the induced expression from this system increases by almost 4-fold. A region (from −126 to −48 with the transcription start site as +1) located upstream of the promoter is required for glucitol induction and is suggested to contain binding sites for a transcription activator, GutR. The structural gene encoding GutR is located upstream of thegut operon and is transcribed in an opposite direction relative to that of the gut operon (3Gay P. Chalumeau H. Steinmetz M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 1133-1137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Ye R. Rehemtulla S.N. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3321-3327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inactivation of this gene abolishes the glucitol induction of the gutoperon. Several different motifs can be found in GutR, including a typical helix-turn-helix motif for DNA binding at the N-terminal region, motifs A and B for a nucleotide binding site, and tetratricopeptide repeats at the C-terminal region (4Ye R. Rehemtulla S.N. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3321-3327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To understand the regulatory mechanism of glucitol induction in B. subtilis, we report in this study the overproduction and purification of GutR. This protein indeed binds specifically to the regulatory region upstream of the gut promoter, and there is only a single GutR binding site in that region. The precise boundary of this binding site was mapped. Interestingly, GutR can form a complex with its binding site even in the absence of glucitol. However, in the presence of glucitol, the real-time kinetic measurement with a BIAcoreX biosensor demonstrates that GutR binds extremely tightly to its binding site and that this tight binding is the result of a change in the off-rate (dissociation rate constant) of the binding reaction. Molecules other than glucitol are unable to induce a similar effect. Possible steps involved in the initial stage of the GutR-mediated transcription are discussed. The expression vector used in this study is the B. subtilis pUB18-P43 vector (5Wu S.-C. Wong S.-L. J. Biotechnol. 1999; 72: 185-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This vector is a pUB110 derivative with a kanamycin resistance marker and a strong, constitutively expressed B. subtilis promoter P43 to drive the transcription of genes of interest inserted in the polylinker region located downstream of the promoter. gutR was obtained from pU1 (4Ye R. Rehemtulla S.N. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3321-3327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which carries the chromosomal gutR region by ScaI andBamHI digestion. The resulting gutR gene was inserted into the polylinker region of SmaI/BamHI double-digested Escherichia coli Bluescript vector (pBS) to generate pBSGUTR. The digestion of pBSGUTR byKpnI and BamHI allowed the release of thegutR fragment that could be inserted into theKpnI- and BamHI-digested pUB18-P43 vector to generate pUB18P43GUTR. B. subtilisWB600 is a six-extracellular protease-deficient strain that is used here routinely for expression study (6Wu X.-C. Lee W. Tran L. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4952-4958Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). WB600(pUB18P43GUTR) and the negative control strain WB600(pUB18P43) were cultivated in superrich medium (7Halling S.M. Sanchez-Anzaldo F.J. Fukuda R. Doi R.H. Meares C.F. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2880-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) with kanamycin at a level of 10 μg/ml at 37 °C. Cells were harvested at different time points. Both total and fractionated cellular proteins (soluble and insoluble) were analyzed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). For GutR purification, WB600(pUB18P43GUTR) was cultivated under the above-mentioned conditions for 8 h with a cell density around 800 Klett units, and cells were collected by centrifugation for 10 min at 7000 × g. Cell pellets from a 500-ml culture were resuspended in 40 ml of Buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by French press (10,000 p.s.i. with three or four passes). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 27,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The soluble fraction was applied through a DEAE-52 cellulose column (2.5 × 40 cm) equilibrated with Buffer A, followed by washing the column with 4 column volumes of buffer until a value of A280 of 0.005 or less was achieved. The column was then eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–0.5 m) in Buffer A. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the GutR-containing fractions were pooled and dialyzed extensively with several changes in Buffer A. The dialyzed fraction was applied to a heparin-Sepharose column (3 ml of bed volume). After washing with a 2-column volume of Buffer A to lower the value of A280 to 0.005, the column was eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–0.5 m) in Buffer A. Fractions containing pure GutR were pooled and stored at −20 °C. To determine the molecular weight of GutR in solution, a Superose 6 HR column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used in the Bio-Rad Biologic work station (Bio-Rad). The column was calibrated with a molecular weight marker kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Kav is defined as (Ve − V0)/(Vt− V0). Vt is the total bed volume of the column (24 ml). V0 is the void volume of the column, and using blue dextran, it was determined to be 6.4 ml. Ve is defined as the volume at which the protein elutes. Specific DNA fragments for gel mobility shift assays were generated by PCR and labeled at the 5′ ends with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP as described previously (8Wu X.-C. Nathoo S. Pang A.S.H. Carne T. Wong S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6845-6850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The boundary for these fragments was specified in Fig. 3. AnEcoRI site was introduced at the 5′ end of these fragments, and a BamHI site was introduced at the 3′ end of these fragments. DNA binding reactions were performed in a total volume of 30 μl in a binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 3% Ficoll, 1 μg of sonicated salmon sperm DNA, a 6 nm DNA probe, and 0–15 nm purified GutR. The reaction mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 15 min and then loaded onto a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5 × TBE buffer (45 mm Tris-borate, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). The gel was run at 175 V in 0.5 × TBE buffer for 3 h and then dried for autoradiography. Some of these fragments were also inserted in front of the promoterless lacZ in pDH32 (9Shimotsu H. Henner D. Gene ( Amst. ). 1986; 43: 85-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), aB. subtilis integration vector, to generate transcriptional fusions. The integration of pDH32 derivatives to chromosomal DNA and selection of integrants were performed as described by Ye and Wong (2Ye R. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3314-3320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The β-galactosidase activity from integrants was assayed in the presence and absence of glucitol, and the activity was expressed in Miller units (2Ye R. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3314-3320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For GutR binding studies with the BIAcoreX biosensor, a DNA fragment containing the sequence from −93 to −15 of thegut operon was amplified using PCR with a pair of primers, GUTB-93F (5′-GGGAATTCCAGCGTTTTTTGTATATG-3′) and GUTB-15B (5′-GGGGATCCTGCTTTTTAACACGTTCAAC-3′). The 5′ end of the GUTB-15B primer was biotinylated. This sequence carries the GutR binding site. To have a negative control without a GutR binding site, the polylinker region from pBS was amplified using universal (5′-GTAAAACGGCCAGT-3′) and reverse universal (5′-GTCCTTTGTCGATACTG-3′) primers. The 5′ end of the universal primer was also biotinylated. PCR amplification resulted in the generation of a 164-bp DNA fragment carrying a sequence from the polylinker region of pBS. These primers were ordered from the University Core DNA Services at the University of Calgary. To immobilize biotinylated DNA fragments to the sensor chips to study GutR interaction with its target site, streptavidin has to be immobilized to the carboxymethyl dextran on the CM5 sensor chip (research grade) (BIAcore Inc., New Jersey) with an amine coupling kit from BIAcore Inc. The coupling reaction was performed according to the following steps. After mixing an equal volume of 100 mm N-hydroxysuccinimide and 400 mm N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide together, 30 μl of this mixture was injected to activate the surface of the sensor chip. Streptavidin at a concentration of 30 μg/ml was then injected. In the BIAcoreX system, the chip can be divided into two flow cells. Each flow cell had appropriately 2250 resonance units of streptavidin immobilized (∼2.25 ng/mm2). Excess reactive groups on the chip surface were then deactivated by the injection of 30 μl of 1 m ethanolamine. To eliminate any noncovalently bound streptavidin from the chip, several injections of 10 μl of 0.05% SDS were performed, and the residual SDS molecules were then removed by several washes with TEN buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.05% surfactant P20). Biotinylated polylinker sequence was immobilized to the first flow cell at a final quantity of 84 resonance units to serve as a negative control for GutR binding. The biotinylated GutR binding site-containing fragment was immobilized in the second flow cell to 71 resonance units. With this level of the GutR binding site immobilized, no mass transport effect that would interfere with the kinetic measurement was observed (10O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Brooks I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 323-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). GutR in a binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% surfactant P20, and 20 mm MgCl2) was injected into the sensor chip and passed from the first flow cell to the second flow cell. The binding of GutR was monitored by the change of resonance units with time. The on-rate (association rate constant,ka) was determined via a two-step analysis. In the first step, the binding rate, expressed in terms ofdR/dt (where R represents the resonance unit), was plotted against the response (R). Based on the kinetic equation dR/dt = −(ka C +kd)R +ka CRmax (10O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Brooks I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 323-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), such a plot should yield a straight line with the slope (designated asks) representing the value ofka C + kd(i.e. ks =ka C + kd). In the second step, by plotting the ks values generated with different concentrations (C, 1.78–52 nm) of GutR, a straight line was generated, and the slope of this line represented ka. At the end of the injection, the GutR sample was replaced by the injection of binding buffer, and the dissociation of GutR was monitored for 5 to 15 min. The dissociation rate constant (off-rate, kd) was determined based on the following equation, ln(R0/Rt) =kd(t − t0) (10O'Shannessy D.J. Brigham-Burke M. Soneson K.K. Hensley P. Brooks I. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 323-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). By plotting ln(R0/Rt)versus (t − t0), the value of kd was determined. To examine the effect of glucitol, xylitol, and glucose on GutR binding to its target DNA, each of these components was added to the binding buffer at a final concentration of 2%, and the effect of individual components on GutR binding was monitored. All of these measurements were performed at 25 °C. Plasmid isolation from and DNA transformation to E. coli and B. subtilis, DNA subcloning, PCR amplification, and SDS-PAGE were performed as described previously (2Ye R. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3314-3320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amounts of purified GutR were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm under denaturing conditions as described by Gill and von Hippel (11Gill S.C. Von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). The molar extinction coefficient atA280 of 149,550 m−1cm−1 was used to estimate the amounts of GutR. DNA concentration was determined as described by Sambrook et al.(12Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E. F., Maniatis, T., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., 3, Appendix E, 1989, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York.Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing of purified GutR was performed as described by Ng et al. (13Ng K. Ye R. Wu X.-C. Wong S.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24989-24994Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). gutR was inserted into a high copy number B. subtilis plasmid pUB18-P43 with the strong and constitutively expressed B. subtilis P43 promoter installed in the vector to drive the transcription ofgutR. The resulting vector, pUB18P43GUTR, was transformed to a six-extracellular protease-deficient B. subtilis strain WB600, and the transformants were found to overproduce and stably accumulate a 95-kDa protein with the molecular mass agreeable with the calculated molecular mass (95,076) of GutR. This protein was stable in the intracellular environment at least up to 12 h after inoculation (Fig.1 A). Fractionation studies indicated that more than 95% of this protein was in the soluble intracellular fraction (data not shown). Overproduction of GutR inE. coli using T7 RNA polymerase systems (14Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2456) Google Scholar, 15Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6005) Google Scholar) was not successful. The lack of GutR overproduction in E. coli is not attributable to the presence of rare arginine codons ingutR because the use of strains that overproduce rare arginine tRNAs does not improve the situation (16Garcia G.M. Mar P.K. Mullin D.A. Walker J.R. Prather N.E. Cell. 1986; 45: 453-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The isoelectric point of GutR was estimated to be 6.1. By adjusting the pH to 8.0, GutR should be negatively charged and would be able to bind to the positively charged DEAE-cellulose (DE52). Therefore, the first step in this purification scheme was loading the cell lysate from WB600(pUB18P43GUTR) to a DE52 column (Fig. 1 B). The bound GutR protein was eluted with a linear salt gradient from 0 to 0.5m NaCl. This step served three purposes. First, it could concentrate GutR from the crude cell lysate into a few fractions that were rich in GutR. Second, chromosomal DNA could be separated from GutR because GutR was eluted from the column at the salt concentration of 0.15 m whereas chromosomal DNA was eluted from the column at a salt concentration of 0.45 m. Third, many cellular proteins could also be separated from GutR. Fractions containing GutR were pooled and dialyzed to remove salt. The sample was then applied to a heparin-agarose column based on the assumption that GutR is a DNA-binding protein and should have an affinity to heparin. Indeed, this step was very effective in removing other contaminating proteins (Fig. 1 B). The eluted GutR protein was estimated to be at least 95% pure. The identity of this purified protein as GutR was confirmed by N-terminal sequencing of the first five amino acid residues of this protein. Approximately 4–6 mg of purified GutR can be obtained from one liter of cell culture. Because there were not that many endogenous 95-kDa proteins in the crude extract, purification of GutR was monitored by analyzing the presence of the 95-kDa protein in the eluted fractions. With the purification of GutR and the generation of GutR-specific antibodies, subsequent rounds of GutR purification were monitored by Western blot. To determine whether GutR exists as a monomer or an oligomer in solution in the absence of glucitol, the molecular mass of purified GutR was determined via gel filtration. GutR has an apparent molecular mass of 115 kDa (data not shown). Because this value is much smaller than that expected for a dimeric GutR, the result suggests that GutR exists as a monomer in solution and is likely to be a slightly elongated molecule rather than a globular molecule. The same apparent molecular mass was obtained when tested with a wide range of GutR concentrations (0.5–5 μm). Because the highest intracellular GutR concentration under the induced condition was estimated to be less than 1 μm based on the Western blot analysis, GutR in the cellular environment in the absence of glucitol should exist as monomers. Previous studies indicated that the sequence upstream of the gut promoter is required for the expression of thegut operon (2Ye R. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3314-3320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that GutR is the transcription activator that is hypothesized to bind to the upstream regulatory sequence (4Ye R. Rehemtulla S.N. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3321-3327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To examine this possibility, a gel mobility shift experiment was performed with two PCR-amplified, 5′ end-labeled fragments. One fragment had the sequence corresponding to the −132 to −14 region from the regulatory region of the gut operon with the transcription start site at +1. The other fragment was a 168-bp fragment amplified from the polylinker region of the E. coliBluescript plasmid (pBS) to serve as a negative control. In the presence of excess nonlabeled sonicated salmon sperm DNA, each of these labeled fragments was incubated with an increasing concentration of GutR from 5 to 50 nm. As shown in Fig.2, GutR bound specifically to the regulatory region of the gut operon but not to the polylinker region from the Bluescript vector. With increasing concentrations of GutR, there was a corresponding increase for the GutR-DNA complex. This binding did not require the presence of glucitol. Examining the upstream region of the gut promoter, a 29-bp imperfect inverted repeat sequence located from positions −78 to −50 is likely to be the GutR binding site (Fig.3 A). Because this sequence is highly AT-rich and the entire regulatory region of the gutoperon is also AT-rich, it would be important to determine both the number and the location of the GutR binding site within this region. Gel mobility shift assays were performed using two series of DNA fragments carrying the regulatory region of the gut operon for the study. These DNA fragments were systematically shortened either at the left or the right arm (Fig. 3 B). For fragments with deletion at the left arm, three deletions were made. Fragments L1 to L3 contained the intact inverted repeat sequence. In fragment L3, all of the nucleotide sequence upstream of this inverted repeat was deleted. In fragment L4, half of the inverted repeat sequence in the left arm was also deleted. For the right arm deletion series, fragments R1 to R3 contained the intact inverted repeat whereas fragment R4 had the right arm of the inverted repeat sequence deleted. Mobility shift assays with GutR concentration ranging from 1 to 15 nm demonstrated that DNA fragments (fragments L1 to L3 and R1 to R3) carrying the intact inverted repeat could be selectively retarded by GutR (Fig.3 C). The concentrations of GutR required to shift 50% of these fragments ([GutR]50) were in the range 7–10 nm (Fig. 3 D). DNA fragments containing either the left (fragment L4) or the right (fragment R4) half of the inverted repeat sequence were either not retarded at all or only weakly retarded by GutR at the concentration range 1–15 nm. These data have three implications. First, the 29-bp inverted repeat serves as the GutR binding site. Second, there is only one GutR binding site in the region tested (from −143 to +1) because all sequences upstream and downstream of this inverted repeat could be deleted without affecting the binding affinity of GutR to these fragments. Furthermore, only one retarded complex could be observed in all these mobility shift studies. These observations strengthened the idea that there was a single GutR binding site in thegut operon regulatory region. The last implication is that GutR should bind to its binding site in the form of a dimer or a higher oligomer because GutR could form an extremely weak complex with the sequence that covered only half of the intact GutR binding site. To strengthen the two conclusions concerning the GutR binding site in thegut regulatory region, fragments L1 to L4 were individually inserted in front of a promoterless lacZ reporter gene in the B. subtilis integration vector pDH32. The resultinggut-lacZ transcriptional fusions were integrated at theamyE locus in the chromosome. As shown in Fig.4, integrants with fragments L1–L3 carrying the intact inverted repeat sequence showed comparable β-galactosidase activities (1428–1609 Miller units) under the induction condition. In the absence of glucitol, only a background level (2–3 Miller units) of β-galactosidase activity was observed. These observations indicate that the sequence located between −143 and −79 is not required for the glucitol-inducible expression. Consistent with the in vitro observations, the integrant with fragment L4, which had the left half of the inverted repeat deleted, showed the expression at the basal level. This indicates that the inverted repeat sequence is indeed required for glucitol induction. In vivo studies indicate that glucitol serves as an inducer to turn on the gut operon in B. subtilis. However, the roles of glucitol in the GutR-mediated transcription activation are unknown. To explore the possible functional roles of glucitol in this induction process, the rate constants for both the binding and dissociation reactions of GutR to its binding site in the absence and presence of glucitol were determined using the BIAcoreX biosensor. In this study, a GutR binding site containing a fragment (−95 to −15) with the nucleotide at position −15 biotinylated was generated by PCR amplification and unidirectionally immobilized to biosensor chips that had been coupled with streptavidin. The GutR binding site located at the distal end of the immobilized fragment would be available for GutR binding. The sequence between −49 and −15 served as a spacer between the site of immobilization and the GutR binding site. Fig.5 A showed the plots of ks versus GutR concentration, and the slopes of these plots represent the association rate constants. With the plots of ln(R0/Rt) versustime, the slopes of these lines represent the dissociation rate constants (Fig. 5 B). As shown in TableI, GutR indeed could bind to its target site in the absence of glucitol as observed with the gel mobility shift assay. Interestingly, although the association rate constants of GutR to its binding site in the presence or absence of glucitol were almost the same, there was a significant difference for the dissociation rate constants under these two different conditions. In the presence of glucitol, GutR bound to the target site so tightly that the dissociation rate constant was beyond the limit (1 × 10−5 s−1) that could be measured by the BIAcoreX biosensor. This effect was glucitol-specific (Table I).Table IRate constants for the interaction between GutR and its target sequence determined by BIAcoreX biosensorSamplekakdt1/2a1-aHalf-life of the GutR-DNA complex estimated based on the equation t1/2=0.69/kd described by Neri et al.

Open table in a new tab ka, association rate constant,kd, dissociation rate constant,Kd, dissociation constant. Transcriptional regulation of glucitol induction in B. subtilis is mainly regulated via transcription activation. GutR serves as a transcription activator in this process (4Ye R. Rehemtulla S.N. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3321-3327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and a region upstream of the gut promoter is also required for induction (2Ye R. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3314-3320Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is logical to predict that GutR binds to this upstream regulatory region and activates transcription. In this study, with overproduction and purification of GutR, GutR was demonstrated to bind directly to the upstream region of the gut promoter. This binding did not require the presence of glucitol. The GutR binding site was mapped to the 29-bp imperfect inverted repeat located at positions −78 to −50 of the gut operon. This site is AT-rich. Both the in vitro and in vivo deletion studies indicate that there is only a single GutR binding site in this system. Because the entire B. subtilis genome has been sequenced (17Kunst F. Ogasawara N.

Microbiology ( Reading ). 1995; 141: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) for this 29-nucleotide GutR binding sequence was performed. With an allowance even up to a seven-nucleotide mismatch in this 29-nucleotide region during the search, the GutR binding site located upstream of thegut operon is the only sequence that can be found. With GutR as the transcription activator for the gut operon, another logical prediction is that GutR should serve as the sensor for the presence of the inducer (glucitol) of this system. Isolation of agutR1 mutant that results in the constitutive expression of the gut operon even in the absence of glucitol supports this idea (1Chalumeau H. Delobbe A. Gay P. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 921-928Crossref Google Scholar). In this mutant, a C to A change at the nucleotide level leads to the substitution of Ser-289 by an arginine in GutR (4Ye R. Rehemtulla S.N. Wong S.-L. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3321-3327Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study using a biosensor with purified GutR, the idea for glucitol to bind directly to GutR is further strengthened. In the presence of glucitol, GutR binds extremely tightly to its target site. The on-rate of the binding reaction is not significantly changed, whereas the off-rate is significantly reduced to a degree that cannot be measured by the biosensor system. This effect is glucitol-specific. If glucitol was replaced by either 2% xylitol or 2% glucose in the binding reactions, the dissociation rate constants under these conditions were comparable with those observed for GutR in the absence of any ligand. These data suggest that glucitol can bind to GutR and trigger GutR to have an extremely tight binding to its target site, whereas xylitol and glucose are unable to bind to GutR. This implies that glucitol is the true inducer for this system. In many activator-dependent operons, activators gain the ability to bind to the target sites only in the presence of a specific ligand such as catabolite activator protein with cAMP (19Blazy B. Takahashi M. Baudras A. Mol. Biol. Rep. 1980; 6: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Alternatively, activators can bind to the target site with equal affinity no matter whether a specific ligand is present or not as observed for SoxR, an activator that activates genes in response to oxidative stress. However, only the Fe-SoxR but not the apo-SoxR activator can stimulate transcription (20Hidalgo E. Demple B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 138-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). In the case of GutR, it has a relatively tight binding to its target site (Kd = 9 × 10−10m) even in the absence of glucitol. If this is the case, what is the physiological role of glucitol? With an off-rate of 1.7 × 10−3 s−1 determined at 25 °C, the half-life t1/2 of the GutR-DNA complex in the absence of glucitol is estimated to be 6.8 min (Table I). Considering that B. subtilis as a soil bacterium and that the nutrients present in the soil are not always at high levels, the generation time for cell division can be relatively long. By cultivating B. subtilis in a defined medium (SP1) (21Spizizen J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1958; 44: 1072-1078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 25 °C, the generation time is determined to be 380 min (6.3 h). Therefore, a half-life of 6.8 min of the GutR-DNA complex would not be considered to be significant. In contrast, the BIAcoreX biosensor can measure the off-rate as low as 1 × 10−5s−1, and this translates to a half-life t1/2 of the complex to 19 h. In the presence of glucitol, the dissociation rate constant for the GutR-DNA complex should be less than 1 × 10−5 s−1because it was beyond the limit that could be measured by the BIAcoreX biosensor. Therefore, the GutR-DNA complex in the presence of glucitol had the off-rate decreased by 100-fold or more and had the ability to bind to its binding site without dissociation before the cell divided. This tight binding raises an important question. Why would GutR remain bound to its target site? This tight binding is hypothesized here to allow GutR to be positioned very close to the promoter as one of the necessary steps in a multistep process to mediate the transcription activation process. Our study indicates that the next step in the activation process is the binding of ATP to GutR. 2K. K. H. Poon and S. -L. Wong, manuscript in preparation. Under this condition, GutR has positioned itself at the proper location to wait for the next step (ATP binding) to occur. Therefore, one of the functions of glucitol as the inducer is to induce GutR to have a tight binding to its target site so that subsequent reactions can occur and lead to the activation of the gut operon. A tight binding can be achieved by an increase in the on-rate, a decrease in the off-rate, or a combination of both. The on-rate is a second order reaction governed mainly by diffusion and long range electrostatic interactions. In contrast, the off-rate is a first order reaction determined by many short range interactions between the two interacting molecules, such as hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions. In the case of GutR, only the off-rate of the GutR binding reaction in the presence of glucitol is affected. This can be achieved by at least three possible mechanisms. 1) The binding of glucitol to GutR can induce GutR to have conformational changes so that more residues in the DNA binding region of GutR are available to make extensive contacts with the GutR binding site. 2) Besides the helix-turn-helix region, extra contacts can possibly be made between GutR and the sequences flanking the GutR binding site via DNA wrapping. DNA wrapping around the hexameric arginine repressor has been suggested to account for the tight binding of the arginine repressor to its operator (22Stockley P.G. Baron A.J. Wild C.M. Parsons I.D. Miller C.M. Holtham C.A. Baumberg S. Biosens. Bioelectron. 1998; 13: 637-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 3) Glucitol may induce GutR to oligomerize. The presence of multiple DNA binding domains in these oligomers will make sure that the GutR binding site is always in contact with some of the GutR DNA binding domains in the GutR oligomer. Although the sequence search of GutR did not find any known regulatory proteins that show significant homology to GutR, this protein shares some similarities to the properties of the members of the 100-kDa transcription activator family, such as MalT (23Boos W. Shuman H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 204-229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Boos W. Bohm A. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 404-409Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and AcoK (25Peng H.L. Yang Y.H. Deng W.L. Chang H.Y. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 1497-1504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). They all are transcription activators with a molecular mass in the range of 100 kDa and there is a nucleotide binding site in each of these transcription activators. They activate promoters recognized by the major RNA polymerase (i.e. theEς70 family rather than theEς54 family), and their binding sites are located slightly upstream of the −35 region of the promoters. In the absence of inducer, both MalT (26Schreiber V. Richet E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33220-33226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and GutR exist as monomers in solution. However, the GutR system has its unique aspects that are different from the MalT system. MalT can bind to its binding sites only in the presence of both the inducer (maltotriose) and ATP (27Raibaud O. Richet E. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 3059-3061Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Richet E. Raibaud O. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 981-987Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). This is not the case for the GutR system. Multiple MalT binding sites are located upstream of the mal promoters (29Vidal-Ingigliardi D. Richet E. Danot O. Raibaud O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24527-24530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Vidal-Ingigliardi D. Richet E. Raibaud O. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas only a single GutR binding site is in the gut operon. Furthermore, the putative DNA binding site in GutR is located at the N-terminal region rather than at the C-terminal region as observed for MalT (29Vidal-Ingigliardi D. Richet E. Danot O. Raibaud O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24527-24530Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All these differences indicate that GutR may mediate its transcription activation by a mechanism that is different from other known systems, and the elucidation of this mechanism would provide insights to understand this transcription activation system."
