https://openalex.org/W1562400216,"Abstract The cell envelope of Salmonella typhimurium has been separated into cytoplasmic and outer membrane fractions of relatively high purity by a new method based on isopycnic sucrose density gradient centrifugation of the total membrane fraction obtained by lysis of lysozyme-EDTA spheroplasts. The outer membrane fraction contained approximately 60% of the protein of the total membranes, 50% of the phospholipid, and 90% of the lipopolysaccharide. The cytoplasmic and outer membrane fractions differed markedly in over-all protein composition as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in sodium dodecyl sulfate as well as in specific enzyme activities. Total cytochromes, DPNH oxidase, succinate dehydrogenase, d-lactate dehydrogenase, and Enzyme II of the α-methylglucoside phosphotransferase system were recovered essentially exclusively in cytoplasmic membrane; the specific activities of these in the outer membrane were 1 to 5% of the values obtained for cytoplasmic membrane fractions. In contrast, a phospholipase activity tentatively identified as a mixture of phospholipase A and lysophospholipase, appeared to be localized primarily in the outer membrane. UDP-sugar hydrolase, ribonuclease I and endonuclease I activities were associated with both membrane fractions. Preliminary analysis of the phospholipid composition of the isolated fractions also showed significant quantitative differences in the relative distribution of the major glycerophosphatides. The ratios of phosphatidylglycerol to phosphatidylethanolamine and of cardiolipin to phosphatidylethanolamine in the outer membrane were approximately one-half and one-quarter those of the cytoplasmic membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1989345254,"There are genetic differences within the major histocompatibility complex of the mouse which lead to skin graft rejection but which cannot be detected serologically. When confronted with these differences on allogeneic cells, lymphocytes proliferate in vitro. In other cases, in vitro lymphocyte proliferation but no skin graft rejection is associated with loci that are linked to but genetically separable from the loci controlling the serologically defined antigens."
https://openalex.org/W1989313073,"Two analogs of the hypothalamic luteinizing hormone releasing factor modified at the histidine-2 position were tested for biological activity (secretion of luteinizing hormone) in cultures of dispersed rat anterior pituitary cells. The analog in which glycine was substituted for histidine at position 2, [Gly(2)]LRF, behaves as a partial agonist releasing less than 50 percent of the luteinizing hormone secreted at maximum concentrations of the releasing factor, while the analog in which histidine at position 2 is deleted has no significant agonist activity at any of the doses tested. When added to the cultured cells at molar ratios 10(3) to 10(4) times that of the luteinizing hormone releasing factor, both analogs decrease the amount of luteinizing hormone secreted in response to the releasing factor."

https://openalex.org/W1512345015,"Abstract We have studied the 3' to 5' exonucleolytic activity of the T4 DNA polymerase during in vitro DNA synthesis. By separating reaction products by one-dimensional thin layer chromatography we were able to follow simultaneously nucleotide incorporation, hydrolysis of newly incorporated nucleotides, and also the degradation of thymine-labeled template DNA. When all four deoxynucleoside triphosphates are present, degradation of template DNA appears to be limited to the removal of unpaired 3'-terminal regions early in the reaction; addition of nucleotides to paired termini protects template molecules from exonucleolytic attack. When one or more deoxynucleoside triphosphates are omitted, the extent of template degradation depends upon the relative rates of hydrolysis and incorporation of the available substrates. During copying of single stranded DNA, hydrolysis of newly incorporated nucleotides, as shown by the appearance of free deoxynucleoside monophosphates derived from all four triphosphates, occurs at a rate slower than, but related to, the initial rate of synthesis. Free deoxynucleoside monophosphate formation continues after product DNA has ceased to accumulate. At 37° free dAMP is formed at 20 to 40% of the initial rate of dAMP incorporation. During a reaction in which the four deoxynucleotides are incorporated into product DNA at similar rates and to about the same extent, newly added dAMP is hydrolyzed 1 ½ to 3 times as often as dTMP and dGMP, and 6 to 9 times more frequently than dCMP, suggesting that the polymerase recognizes specific bases. At 20° the rate of hydrolysis of newly incorporated nucleotides is depressed to a greater degree than the rate of synthesis, suggesting that local unwinding of the 3' terminus is required for hydrolysis of newly incorporated residues. The T4 polymerase has previously been found by Englund to carry out repeated hydrolysis and replacement of nucleotides at the ends of native DNA without net synthesis or degradation. We find that triphosphate utilization (net incorporation plus hydrolysis of newly incorporated residues) is faster with native than denatured T7 DNA. However, when both forms of T7 DNA are present in a reaction, incorporation and release of deoxynucleotides occur at the rate seen with denatured DNA alone, even when enzyme is in molar excess of total 3'-hydroxyl chain termini. As a possible means of studying the frequency of errors in copying, we have measured the incorporation and the hydrolysis of residues derived from deoxynucleoside triphosphates that are not complementary to either strand of homopolymer duplexes. With poly(dA)·poly(dT) as template-primer, both dGTP and dCTP were converted to free dGMP and dCMP, although neither appeared in product polymer. Thus misincorporation had occurred, but the nucleotides were subsequently removed by the exonuclease activity of the polymerase."

https://openalex.org/W1677322794,"Abstract Lenses of chick embryos and matrix-free cells obtained by enzymic dissociation of the embryonic lenses were incubated with [14C]proline, and the basement membrane collagen synthesized by the systems was partially characterized. The newly synthesized [14C]collagen obtained from intact lenses was found to be completely solubilized after denaturation and reduction with sodium dodecyl sulfate and mercaptoethanol. After treatment of the newly synthesized [14C]-collagen with pepsin, less than 5% of the peptide-bound 4-hydroxy[14C]proline became dialyzable, but most of the peptide-bound 4-hydroxy[14C]proline was dialyzable after incubation with bacterial collagenase. The size of the basement membrane collagen synthesized by the intact lenses and the matrix-free cells was estimated by treating the 14C-protein with mercaptoethanol and sodium dodecyl sulfate and then chromatographing the 14C-protein on an agarose column equilibrated and eluted with buffer containing sodium dodecyl sulfate. The initial form of [14C]collagen synthesized by both the intact lenses and the isolated lens cells was found to consist of polypeptide chains which had molecular weights of approximately 140,000 and which were shown to be considerably larger than the polypeptide chains from the precursor form of collagen recently isolated from interstitial connective tissues. When the synthesis of the basement membrane collagen was examined in intact lenses, there was a time-dependent conversion of the precursor form initially synthesized to collagen comprised of polypeptide chains slightly larger than the α chains of interstitial collagen. The time required for the conversion of the basement membrane collagen from the precursor form to the slightly smaller form was about 1 hour, a time which is considerably longer than that required for a similar conversion of the precursor form of interstitial collagen in tendon and membranous bone. Studies with the matrix-free cells indicated that the major part of the collagen secreted into the medium was in the precursor form, and the results therefore suggested that the conversion of the precursor form to an α chain form of the basement membrane collagen was an extracellular event."
https://openalex.org/W1481836405,"Candida utilis contains an inducible enzyme, urea amidolyase, which catalyzes the decomposition of urea with formation of carbon dioxide and ammonia. This reaction is accompanied by the cleavage of ATP with liberation of equimolar amounts of ADP and inorganic phosphate, is strictly dependent for activity on divalent (Mg++ or Mn++) and monovalent (K+, Rb+, Cs+, or NH4+) cations, and requires catalytic amounts of bicarbonate. A detailed consideration of these properties is presented for the enzyme purified approximately 150-fold from C. utilis. Urea amidolyase activity is induced in C. utilis by urea and other substances which most likely are enzymatically degraded to urea. Repression of the enzyme occurs when low evels of ammonia are present in the medium. Extracts of other yeasts, such as Candida flareri and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as of the unicellular green algae Chlorella ellipsoidea, Chlorella pyrenoidosa, and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, also contain urea amidolyase activity when these organisms are grown in media containing urea as the sole source of nitrogen."
https://openalex.org/W2090483037,"IN contrast to the important role of zinc in wound healing1,2 comparatively little attention has been paid to the metal in relation to tissue reaction to malignant disease3–8. In this study samples of liver tissue from fifty necropsies were divided into four series (excluding malignant tissue itself): “normal” liver (series I), fatty liver (series II), apparently uninvaded liver from organs containing secondary malignant deposits (series III) and livers from patients with malignant disease but no obvious liver secondaries (series IV). The selection, preliminary processing and preparation of the specimens will be described elsewhere9. All specimens were analysed in duplicate. One set of samples was wet-digested and used for the measurement of zinc concentration by atomic-absorption spectroscopy. The other set of samples was ashed and used for the determination of the wet-weight/ash ratio. Closely adjacent specimens were examined microscopically to exclude histological evidence of local malignant invasion. Zinc concentrations were finally expressed in terms of ash weight tissue. (In this context this is a more meaningful reference datum than “dry” weight, wet weight or protein or nitrogen concentration.) The results are summarized in Table 1. “Normal” liver (series I) refers to organs which had been removed from subjects who showed no evidence of malignant disease anywhere, and whose liver showed only mild terminal changes. The range of zinc concentrations in this series was comparatively narrow and is in fairly close agreement with the findings of other workers3,11–15. The difference between normal liver zinc and liver zinc from subjects with malignant disease (series III and IV) was highly significant (PT< 0.005 and P< 0.0025 respectively). The difference between the two malignant-disease series was insignificant compared to the difference between the two malignant-disease series combined on the one hand and the two non-malignant series combined on the other."

The magnitude of their pulse increment was highly correlated with their subjective experiences. Three of the 12 subjects subsequently received Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol labeled with carbon-14; the time course of its concentration in plasma was highly correlated with the pulse increment. Subjective symptoms, however, appeared later and dissipated more slowly."
https://openalex.org/W1651543921,Abstract A spectrophotometric assay of the conversion of pepsinogen into pepsin is described. This assay allows accurate investigations at early stages in the reaction which demonstrate that the conversion is more complex than a simple autocatalytic process and that a unimolecular self activation may also be involved. Evidence is presented for a rapid reversible conformational change in the pepsinogen molecule to what may be an intermediate in the conversion.

https://openalex.org/W1559878275,Abstract The subunit structure and binding properties of valine:tRNA ligase from yeast and the lysine:tRNA ligases from Escherichia coli and yeast have been investigated. Both the lysine:tRNA ligase from E. coli and that from yeast contain two subunits of identical molecular weight per molecule of active enzyme. Binding studies show that both enzymes have two lysine sites and two ATP sites. In contrast to this the valine:tRNA ligase contains only one polypeptide chain and has one site each for valine and ATP per enzyme molecule.

https://openalex.org/W1576337943,"Abstract The complete amino acid sequence of the protein subfraction B of S-carboxymethylated high-sulfur protein from reduced and S-carboxymethylated high-sulfur protein from wool has been determined. The protein contains 156 amino acid residues; the NH2-terminal alanine residue is acetylated and the COOH-terminal residue is S-carboxymethylcysteine. The protein contains no lysine, histidine, nor methionine, and only 6 arginine residues. Only six carboxyl side chains are present in addition to the 34 residues of derived S-carboxymethylcysteine. Tryptic digestion of this protein gave four peptides containing 2, 7, 59, and 88 residues. The structures of these peptides were determined by enzymic cleavage with thermolysin, pepsin, and chymotrypsin, and the use of the Edman degradation with dansylation. Protein SCMK-B2B displays a high degree of internal homology."

Colicins Ia and Ib are basic proteins having isoelectric points of greater than 10 and 9.5, respectively. The colicins exhibit similar amino acid compositions having a high content of basic amino acids and low amounts of hydrophobic residues. Neither colicin contains cysteine. Both colicins have serine as an NH2-terminal residue. Comparative fingerprint analyses of the products obtained from trypsin digestion of the iodinated colicins showed that approximately half of the resulting iodinated peptides were identical in the 2 molecules. Similar analyses showed that approximately 80% of the arginine containing tryptic peptides were identical. These results indicate extensive primary sequence homology between the colicins. Both colicins consist of a single polypeptide chain of molecular weight 80,000."
https://openalex.org/W1544760751,Abstract Removal of base Y adjacent to the anticodon of yeast phenylalanine tRNA changes the coding properties of tRNAphe. Phenylalanine tRNA from which base Y has been removed (tRNAphe_y) recognizes UUC better than UUU. Codon UUU is read efficiently at higher Mg++ concentration or in the presence of streptomycin. A dipeptide cannot be synthesized with N-acetyl-Phe-tRNAphe and Phe-tRNAphe_y unless the base Y is also removed from the acetylated Phe-tRNA. Removal of base Y from the anticodon loop does not affect the ability of phenylalanyl-tRNAphe_y to form the ternary complex with GTP and the bacterial elongation factor T.

A large amount of precipitate approximating 35% of the histone appeared during the demaleylation procedure. The precipitate was separated into four fractions on a Sephadex G-50 column and one fraction, tryptic peptide II from the maleylated histone, was found to be the COOH-terminal portion of the histone by analysis of residues released by carboxypeptidases A and B. 2. The sequence of the 48 residues in this fragment determined by sequence analysis and overlapping fragments of tryptic, peptic, and thermolysin digestion products is His-Leu-Gln-Leu-Ala-Ile-Arg-Asn-Asp-Glu-Glu-Leu-Asn-Lys-Leu-Leu-Gly-Lys-Val-Thr-Ile-Ala-Gln-Gly-Gly-Val-Leu-Pro-Asn-Ile-Gln-Ala-Val-Leu-Leu-Pro-Lys-Lys-Thr-Glu-Ser-His-His-Lys-Ala-Lys-Gly-Lys."

https://openalex.org/W1607161262,"Abstract The activities of cathepsins D from rat liver and from transplantable rat sarcoma tissue on synthetic peptides were studied. It was shown that, although the two cathepsins are similar in some properties, their binding sites have different structures. Sarcoma cathepsin can split peptides that contain either aromatic or dicarboxylic amino acid residues. Substrates for this enzyme must have peptide chains of at least 5 amino acid residues. Sarcoma cathepsin D displays highest affinity for those substrates that contain dicarboxylic amino acid residues on both sides of the peptide bond cleaved. Replacement of 1 or 2 dicarboxylic amino acid residues by a phenylalanyl residue decreased the apparent affinity of the enzyme for the substrate. Of several structures tested as substrates, the cathepsin D from rat liver has been observed to split only those peptides that contain an aromatic amino acid residue. Both enzymes studied can, like aminopeptidase, split off the NH2-terminal alanyl residue from the peptide Ala-Phe-Gly-Leu-Asp-Val. The synthetic substrate for pepsin, acetyl-Phe-Tyr, inhibits competitively rat liver cathepsin but has no effect on sarcoma cathepsin."
https://openalex.org/W1544870202,"Two nonidentical peptides that contain e-N-trimethyllysine (Me3Lys) were isolated from digests of subfragment-1 of white skeletal muscle myosin from rabbit. One, a tryptic peptide, has the sequence: Ala-Thr-Asp-Thr-Ser-Asn-Phe-Me3Lys-Lys-Lys; the other, a tryptic and thermolytic peptide is: Tyr-Me3Lys. Both Me3Lys peptides contain fully trimethylated residues with no evidence of heterogeneity with respect to degree of methylation. It can be concluded that the 2 moles of Me3Lys per mole of subfragment-1 represent fully methylated residues in the heavy chain of myosin. It was suggested by DeLange et al. (D e L ange , R. J., G lazer , A. N., and S mith , E. L. (1969) J. Biol. Chem. 244, 1385) that a cluster of lysines is likely to be part of the recognition site for lysine methylation. The Me3Lys-I peptide sequence is consistent with this hypothesis."
https://openalex.org/W1588367941,"Abstract An intermediate in the biosynthesis of insulin has been isolated from anglerfish islets and shown to have the structure of insulin with the additional amino acid residues Gly-Thr-Lys attached to the NH2 terminus of the A chain. This intermediate can be produced in vitro by a rapid tryptic enzymic cleavage of anglerfish proinsulin; more extensive trypsin treatment converts this intermediate to insulin. We propose that the biosynthesis of insulin in anglerfish islets in vivo proceeds via two sequential steps: a rapid enzymic hydrolysis of proinsulin to yield the insulin intermediate, followed by a slow hydrolysis of this intermediate to produce insulin. It is possible that one tryptic-like enzyme is operative in both steps."
https://openalex.org/W1493768015,"Abstract The effects of specific ligands on the intersubunit interactions in aspartate transcarbamylase of Escherichia coli were studied by treating the enzyme with low concentrations (up to 0.5 mm) of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The detergent was used to amplify the tendency of certain ligands to relax the oligomeric structure, by converting this relaxation to actual dissociation into subunits. The effect was measured by the increase in catalytic activity at subsaturating aspartate concentrations, known to accompany dissociation into subunits. The extent of dissociation was evaluated by column chromatography using Sephadex G-200. The following observations were made. (a) Ligands binding at the active sites such as orthophosphate, carbamyl phosphate, aspartate (in the presence of orthophosphate), and succinate (in the presence of carbamyl phosphate), in this order, enhanced the dissociating effect of the detergent. (b) A linear correlation was found between the extent of dissociation and the product of the net charge and molecular volume of these ligands. (c) All these ligands also protected the dissociated catalytic subunit against SDS inactivation. (d) The allosteric activator, ATP, and inhibitor, CTP, both stabilized the oligomeric structure, and prevented SDS-induced dissociation. (e) The allosteric effectors also protected the enzyme against heat-induced dissociation. These observations are shown to support the functional allosteric model recently proposed for this enzyme (Markus, G., McClintock, D. K., and Bussel, J. B. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 762)."

https://openalex.org/W1531817901,"Abstract The ternary complexes of Mn2+-yeast pyruvate kinase formed upon addition of substrates, products, and the activator fructose 1,6-diphosphate were investigated by proton relaxation rate measurements and kinetic studies. As with the muscle enzyme, the enhancement values of the ternary complexes of the yeast enzyme (et) were all less than that of the binary enzyme-Mn2+ complex (eb) suggesting the formation of enzyme-metal-substrate bridge complexes. With the yeast enzyme, ATP binds 13 times more tightly than ADP and et (ADP) l et (ATP). The latter finding indicates conformational changes in addition to water replacement on the enzyme-bound Mn2+. The et (P-enolpyruvate) with the yeast and muscle enzymes are indistinguishable suggesting a similar environment for Mn2+ in the P-enolpyruvate ternary complex. The allosteric activator fructose 1,6-diphosphate has no effect on et (P-enolpyruvate) with yeast pyruvate kinase, but causes a 3-fold decrease in the dissociation constant, in agreement with kinetic data. The dissociation constant (K2) of MnATP is seven times lower than its kinetic inhibition constant (Ki), consistent with either multiple modes of binding of ATP or an ordered dissociation of products with ATP preceding pyruvate. Similarly the dissociation constant for ADP was an order of magnitude lower than its Michaelis constant arguing against a rapid equilibrium random kinetic scheme. Fructose 1,6-diphosphate has little or no effect on the binding of ADP as observed kinetically or by water proton relaxation rate measurements. The homotropic effect of ADP observed kinetically at low Mn2+ concentration is abolished, however, by high concentration of Mn2+ or by the combined interaction of Mn2+ and P-enolpyruvate. Fructose 1,6-diphosphate abolishes the homotropic effect of P-enolpyruvate and decreases the dissociation constant of yeast pyruvate kinase for both P-enolpyruvate and pyruvate but not for FPO32-. It is suggested that the allosteric activator functions primarily by modifying the carboxyl subsite of P-enolpyruvate and thereby raises the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate."

https://openalex.org/W1483327714,"Abstract l-Asparaginase from Escherichia coli B was treated with tetranitromethane in amounts ranging from equimolar to 10 molar excess. At low ratios of the reagent the tetrameric enzyme aggregates to larger molecular weight species in the absence of any detectable nitrotyrosine formation. At the higher ratios of the reagent the enzyme first polymerizes and the resulting polymers are subsequently nitrated. Although the covalent bonds joining the subunits together in the aggregate are unaffected by 8 m urea or sodium dodecyl sulfate, fluorescence and difference spectroscopy indicate that the microenvironment surrounding the aromatic amino acid side chains in the aggregates is perturbed in the presence of these denaturants. In addition, the polymeric forms still retain a portion of their catalytic function. The similarity in titration behavior of the phenolic hydroxyl groups in the tetranitromethane-induced polymers and in the unmodified enzyme suggests that the subunits are not exclusively crosslinked through the phenolic side chains of tyrosine. The tyrosyl residues of asparaginase could be modified by iodination without the formation of large molecular weight aggregates and without causing dissociation into subunits."
