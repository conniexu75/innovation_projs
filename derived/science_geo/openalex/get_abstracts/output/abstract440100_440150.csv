https://openalex.org/W1965095016,"Parkinson's disease is characterized by abundant α-synuclein (α-Syn) neuronal inclusions, known as Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, and the massive loss of midbrain dopamine neurons. However, a cause-and-effect relationship between Lewy inclusion formation and neurodegeneration remains unclear. Here, we found that in wild-type nontransgenic mice, a single intrastriatal inoculation of synthetic α-Syn fibrils led to the cell-to-cell transmission of pathologic α-Syn and Parkinson's-like Lewy pathology in anatomically interconnected regions. Lewy pathology accumulation resulted in progressive loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta, but not in the adjacent ventral tegmental area, and was accompanied by reduced dopamine levels culminating in motor deficits. This recapitulation of a neurodegenerative cascade thus establishes a mechanistic link between transmission of pathologic α-Syn and the cardinal features of Parkinson's disease."

O'Roak et al. (p. 1619 ; published online 15 November) modified molecular inversion probe methods for target-specific capture and sequencing to resequence candidate genes in thousands of patients. The technique was applied to 44 candidate genes to identify de novo mutations in a large cohort of individuals with and without autism spectrum disorder. The analysis revealed several de novo mutations in genes that together contribute to 1% of sporadic autism spectrum disorders, supporting the notion that multiple genes underlie autism-spectrum disorders."

(p. 932 ; see the Perspective by Strano ) used α-hemolysin as a model for creating a nanostructure with DNA origami that, when inserted into a lipid bilayer membrane, acted as a membrane channel. Ion channel responses were similar to those measured for natural ion channels, and channels that protruded further into the membrane exhibited greater gating responses. The channels were used to detect single-DNA molecules."

Most materials that show actuation either provide larger forces with small-amplitude motions, such as the alloy NiTi, or provide larger motions with much less force, such as polymeric materials. Other problems with such actuators can include slow response times and short lifetimes. Lima et al. (p. 928 , see the Perspective by Schulz ) show that a range of guest-filled, twist-spun carbon nanotube yarns can be used for linear or torsional actuation, can solve the problems of speed and lifetime, and do not require electrolytes for operation."

This study explores the role of particular populations of PFC neurons in mice during a challenging behavioural situation — the forced swim test. The authors identify neurons that respond during forced swimming, but not during normal locomotion. Using optogenetic manipulation, they show that only the specific population of PFC neurons projecting to the brainstem dorsal raphe nucleus, a region implicated in depression, induces changes in behaviour during forced swimming. These results throw light on the neural circuitry underlying normal and pathological patterns of action selection and motivation in behaviour. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) is thought to participate in high-level control of the generation of behaviours (including the decision to execute actions1); indeed, imaging and lesion studies in human beings have revealed that PFC dysfunction can lead to either impulsive states with increased tendency to initiate action2, or to amotivational states characterized by symptoms such as reduced activity, hopelessness and depressed mood3. Considering the opposite valence of these two phenotypes as well as the broad complexity of other tasks attributed to PFC, we sought to elucidate the PFC circuitry that favours effortful behavioural responses to challenging situations. Here we develop and use a quantitative method for the continuous assessment and control of active response to a behavioural challenge, synchronized with single-unit electrophysiology and optogenetics in freely moving rats. In recording from the medial PFC (mPFC), we observed that many neurons were not simply movement-related in their spike-firing patterns but instead were selectively modulated from moment to moment, according to the animal’s decision to act in a challenging situation. Surprisingly, we next found that direct activation of principal neurons in the mPFC had no detectable causal effect on this behaviour. We tested whether this behaviour could be causally mediated by only a subclass of mPFC cells defined by specific downstream wiring. Indeed, by leveraging optogenetic projection-targeting to control cells with specific efferent wiring patterns, we found that selective activation of those mPFC cells projecting to the brainstem dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), a serotonergic nucleus implicated in major depressive disorder4, induced a profound, rapid and reversible effect on selection of the active behavioural state. These results may be of importance in understanding the neural circuitry underlying normal and pathological patterns of action selection and motivation in behaviour."
https://openalex.org/W2036275833,"The control of heat conduction through the manipulation of phonons as coherent waves in solids is of fundamental interest and could also be exploited in applications, but coherent heat conduction has not been experimentally confirmed. We report the experimental observation of coherent heat conduction through the use of finite-thickness superlattices with varying numbers of periods. The measured thermal conductivity increased linearly with increasing total superlattice thickness over a temperature range from 30 to 150 kelvin, which is consistent with a coherent phonon heat conduction process. First-principles and Green's function-based simulations further support this coherent transport model. Accessing the coherent heat conduction regime opens a new venue for phonon engineering for an array of applications."
https://openalex.org/W2100415806,"The mammalian gastrointestinal tract provides a complex and competitive environment for the microbiota. Successful colonization by pathogens requires scavenging nutrients, sensing chemical signals, competing with the resident bacteria and precisely regulating the expression of virulence genes. The gastrointestinal pathogen enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) relies on inter-kingdom chemical sensing systems to regulate virulence gene expression. Here we show that these systems control the expression of a novel two-component signal transduction system, named FusKR, where FusK is the histidine sensor kinase and FusR the response regulator. FusK senses fucose and controls expression of virulence and metabolic genes. This fucose-sensing system is required for robust EHEC colonization of the mammalian intestine. Fucose is highly abundant in the intestine. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron produces multiple fucosidases that cleave fucose from host glycans, resulting in high fucose availability in the gut lumen. During growth in mucin, B. thetaiotaomicron contributes to EHEC virulence by cleaving fucose from mucin, thereby activating the FusKR signalling cascade, modulating the virulence gene expression of EHEC. Our findings suggest that EHEC uses fucose, a host-derived signal made available by the microbiota, to modulate EHEC pathogenicity and metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2082802265,"Inducing a Quiet Space The interaction between light and matter forms the foundation of many applications in communication and sensing, as well as provides insights into fundamental quantum-level processes. Optical coupling of a mechanical system can be used to study these processes. However, because the mechanical oscillator is unavoidably coupled to its environment, thermal noise can spoil the sensitivity of the optomechanical coupling. Dong et al. (p. 1609 , published online 15 November) exploit the ability to form a mechanical “dark state” that can effectively isolate the mechanical system from thermal-induced noise. The formation of such a noise-free zone may provide a simpler route to probe quantum optomechanical systems that circumvents the need to cool the oscillator to its quantum limit where all thermal motion is frozen out."
https://openalex.org/W1987523847,"Reprogramming somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has been suspected of causing de novo copy number variation. To explore this issue, here we perform a whole-genome and transcriptome analysis of 20 human iPSC lines derived from the primary skin fibroblasts of seven individuals using next-generation sequencing. We find that, on average, an iPSC line manifests two copy number variants (CNVs) not apparent in the fibroblasts from which the iPSC was derived. Using PCR and digital droplet PCR, we show that at least 50% of those CNVs are present as low-frequency somatic genomic variants in parental fibroblasts (that is, the fibroblasts from which each corresponding human iPSC line is derived), and are manifested in iPSC lines owing to their clonal origin. Hence, reprogramming does not necessarily lead to de novo CNVs in iPSCs, because most of the line-manifested CNVs reflect somatic mosaicism in the human skin. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that clonal expansion, and iPSC lines in particular, can be used as a discovery tool to reliably detect low-frequency CNVs in the tissue of origin. Overall, we estimate that approximately 30% of the fibroblast cells have somatic CNVs in their genomes, suggesting widespread somatic mosaicism in the human body. Our study paves the way to understanding the fundamental question of the extent to which cells of the human body normally acquire structural alterations in their DNA post-zygotically."
https://openalex.org/W2167415413,"The Human Microbiome Project used rigorous good clinical practice standards to complete comprehensive body site sampling in healthy 18- to 40-yr-old adults, creating an unparalleled reference set of microbiome specimens. To ensure that specimens represented minimally perturbed microbiomes, we first screened potential participants using exclusion criteria based on health history, including the presence of systemic diseases (e.g., hypertension, cancer, or immunodeficiency or autoimmune disorders), use of potential immunomodulators, and recent use of antibiotics or probiotics. Subsequent physical examinations excluded individuals based on body mass index (BMI), cutaneous lesions, and oral health. We screened 554 individuals to enroll 300 (149 men and 151 women, mean age 26 yr, mean BMI 24 kg/m2, 20.0% racial minority, and 10.7% Hispanic). We obtained specimens from the oral cavity, nares, skin, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina (15 specimens from men and 18 from women). The study evaluated longitudinal changes in an individual's microbiome by sampling 279 participants twice (mean 212 d after the first sampling; range 30-359 d) and 100 individuals 3 times (mean 72 d after the second sampling; range 30-224 d). This sampling strategy yielded 11,174 primary specimens, from which 12,479 DNA samples were submitted to 4 centers for metagenomic sequencing.

https://openalex.org/W1996395471,"Computational and learning theory models propose that behavioral control reflects value that is both cached (computed and stored during previous experience) and inferred (estimated on the fly on the basis of knowledge of the causal structure of the environment). The latter is thought to depend on the orbitofrontal cortex. Yet some accounts propose that the orbitofrontal cortex contributes to behavior by signaling ""economic"" value, regardless of the associative basis of the information. We found that the orbitofrontal cortex is critical for both value-based behavior and learning when value must be inferred but not when a cached value is sufficient. The orbitofrontal cortex is thus fundamental for accessing model-based representations of the environment to compute value rather than for signaling value per se."
https://openalex.org/W2068168052,"Earning a High Grade Most of the world's copper and molybdenum come from porphyry-type ore deposits in Earth's crust. The metals are deposited either as veins of concentrated metals in fractured rock or in a confined shell, associated with the edges of magma chamber plumes. But it remains unclear why a front of sharp temperature-pressure gradients, which allows the accumulation of high-grade metal deposits, remains stable. Weis et al. (p. 1613 , published online 15 November; see the Perspective by Ingebritsen ) constructed a hydrothermal model of a porphyry-type system given a supply of magmatic fluids with high metal concentrations. The thermodynamic properties of injected volatile fluids and dynamic variations in host rock permeability, driven by injection-induced fracturing, controlled the stability and evolution of the fronts and allowed for the formation of an extensive network of ore veins from within the magmatic chamber."
https://openalex.org/W2067506867,"The peptidase DPP4 has a wide variety of target proteins, including the chemokine SDF-1 and the hormone GLP-1. Hal Broxmeyer and his coworkers now identify colony-stimulating factors as a new class of DPP4 substrates, including GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-3 and erythropoietin. Treatment of mice with a clinically approved, orally available DPP4 inhibitor improved hematopoietic recovery after radiation or chemotherapeutic drug administration, pointing to potential clinical applications of these findings. Enhancement of hematopoietic recovery after radiation, chemotherapy, or hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is clinically relevant. Dipeptidylpeptidase (DPP4) cleaves a wide variety of substrates, including the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). In the course of experiments showing that inhibition of DPP4 enhances SDF-1–mediated progenitor cell survival, ex vivo cytokine expansion and replating frequency, we unexpectedly found that DPP4 has a more general role in regulating colony-stimulating factor (CSF) activity. DPP4 cleaved within the N-termini of the CSFs granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF, G-CSF, interleukin-3 (IL-3) and erythropoietin and decreased their activity. Dpp4 knockout or DPP4 inhibition enhanced CSF activities both in vitro and in vivo. The reduced activity of DPP4-truncated versus full-length human GM-CSF was mechanistically linked to effects on receptor-binding affinity, induction of GM-CSF receptor oligomerization and signaling capacity. Hematopoiesis in mice after radiation or chemotherapy was enhanced in Dpp4−/− mice or mice receiving an orally active DPP4 inhibitor. DPP4 inhibition enhanced engraftment in mice without compromising HSC function, suggesting the potential clinical utility of this approach."
https://openalex.org/W2148940587,"Repair and Recombination In most sexually reproducing organisms, the haploid gametes are produced by meiosis, a specialized cell-division during which recombination between the parental chromosomes ensures proper chromosome segregation. Double-strand breaks (DSB) generated in the DNA drive this recombination and are linked to recombination hotspots in the chromatin where histone H3 is methylated on lysine residue 4 (H3K4me) by the Set1C/COMPASS enzyme complex. Acquaviva et al. (p. 215 , published online 15 November) show that the Mer2/Mei4/Rec114 complex of the DSB generating machinery is linked to the Set1C/COMPASS enzyme complex through the Spp1 subunit, which contains a PHD-finger capable of binding to H3K4me. The Spp1 subunit recruits the Mer2 protein to sites where recombination will occur, probably by binding to both the H3K4me-marked chromatin and other factors."

Injury of the adult heart results in reactivation of a developmental gene program in the epicardium, but the transcriptional basis of epicardial gene expression has not been delineated. We established a mouse embryonic heart organ culture and gene expression system that facilitated the identification of epicardial enhancers activated during heart development and injury. Epicardial activation of these enhancers depends on a combinatorial transcriptional code centered on CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) transcription factors. Disruption of C/EBP signaling in the adult epicardium reduced injury-induced neutrophil infiltration and improved cardiac function. These findings reveal a transcriptional basis for epicardial activation and heart injury, providing a platform for enhancing cardiac regeneration."

Although thin disks might align with the BH spin axis via the Bardeen-Petterson effect, this does not apply to jet systems with thick disks. We used fully three-dimensional general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations to study accreting BHs with various spin vectors and disk thicknesses and with magnetic flux reaching saturation. Our simulations reveal a ""magneto-spin alignment"" mechanism that causes magnetized disks and jets to align with the BH spin near BHs and to reorient with the outer disk farther away. This mechanism has implications for the evolution of BH mass and spin, BH feedback on host galaxies, and resolved BH images for the accreting BHs in SgrA* and M87."
https://openalex.org/W2089712391,"Subversive Salmonella Salmonella is one of the most intensively studied bacterial pathogens. The Salmonella -containing vacuole (SCV) has a paradoxical lysosome-like composition: On one hand, the SCV membrane is highly enriched in lysosomal membrane glycoproteins and SCVs are accessible to endolysosomal content, but on the other hand, SCV lumen is relatively devoid of lysosomal hydrolytic enzymes that are delivered by the mannose-6-phosphate receptor pathway. McGourty et al. (p. 963 ) resolve this paradox by showing that the Salmonella effector SifA interferes with the trafficking of mannose-6-phosphate receptors. This causes misrouting and secretion of lysosomal enzymes and reduces the hydrolytic activity of lysosomes. Intracellular growth of Salmonella was reduced in cells with enhanced lysosomal enzyme activity."

Typhi is unable to survive within macrophages of species other than human. Spanò and Galán (p. 960 ) found that expression of a single type-III secretion effector protein from a broad host Salmonella in S.

Typhi expressing this effector was able to replicate within mice, a nonpermissive host."
https://openalex.org/W2021828703,"Adhesion to the extracellular matrix (ECM) is critical for epithelial tissue homeostasis and function. ECM detachment induces metabolic stress and programmed cell death via anoikis. ECM-detached mammary epithelial cells are able to rapidly activate autophagy allowing for survival and an opportunity for re-attachment. However, the mechanisms controlling detachment-induced autophagy remain unclear. Here we uncover that the kinase PERK rapidly promotes autophagy in ECM-detached cells by activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), resulting in downstream inhibition of mTORC1-p70S6K signaling. LKB1 and TSC2, but not TSC1, are required for PERK-mediated inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycinin MCF10A cells and mouse embryo fibroblast cells. Importantly, this pathway shows fast kinetics, is transcription-independent and is exclusively activated during ECM detachment, but not by canonical endoplasmic reticulum stressors. Moreover, enforced PERK or AMPK activation upregulates autophagy and causes luminal filling during acinar morphogenesis by perpetuating a population of surviving autophagic luminal cells that resist anoikis. Hence, we identify a novel pathway in which suspension-activated PERK promotes the activation of LKB1, AMPK and TSC2, leading to the rapid induction of detachment-induced autophagy. We propose that increased autophagy, secondary to persistent PERK and LKB1-AMPK signaling, can robustly protect cells from anoikis and promote luminal filling during early carcinoma progression."
https://openalex.org/W2170156489,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as the ghrelin receptor (GHS-R1a), the melanocortin 3 receptor (MC(3)), and the serotonin 2C receptor (5-HT(2C)), are well known for their key role in the homeostatic control of food intake and energy balance. Ghrelin is the only known gut peptide exerting an orexigenic effect and has thus received much attention as an anti-obesity drug target. In addition, recent data have revealed a critical role for ghrelin in dopaminergic mesolimbic circuits involved in food reward signaling. This study investigates the downstream signaling consequences and ligand-mediated co-internalization following heterodimerization of the GHS-R1a receptor with the dopamine 1 receptor, as well as that of the GHS-R1a-MC(3) heterodimer. In addition, a novel heterodimer between the GHS-R1a receptor and the 5-HT(2C) receptor was identified. Interestingly, dimerization of the GHS-R1a receptor with the unedited 5-HT(2C)-INI receptor, but not with the partially edited 5-HT(2C)-VSV isoform, significantly reduced GHS-R1a agonist-mediated calcium influx, which was completely restored following pharmacological blockade of the 5-HT(2C) receptor. These results combined suggest a potential novel mechanism for fine-tuning GHS-R1a receptor-mediated activity via promiscuous dimerization of the GHS-R1a receptor with other G protein-coupled receptors involved in appetite regulation and food reward. These findings may uncover novel mechanisms of significant relevance for the future pharmacological targeting of the GHS-R1a receptor in the homeostatic regulation of energy balance and in hedonic appetite signaling, both of which play a significant role in the development of obesity."

The generally accepted model suggests that they formed at the coremantle boundary of an asteroid. Tarduno et al. (p. 939 ; see the Perspective by Weiss ) measured a remnant magnetization in olivine crystals of two pallasite meteorites and conclude that a dynamo must have operated in their parent body, providing further evidence that some asteroids were capable of dynamo generation. The data, together with thermal modeling, suggest that some pallasites could have formed when liquid FeNi from the core of an impacting asteroid was injected into the mantle of a large protoplanet."
https://openalex.org/W2101531698,"Podophyllum species are sources of (-)-podophyllotoxin, an aryltetralin lignan used for semi-synthesis of various powerful and extensively employed cancer-treating drugs. Its biosynthetic pathway, however, remains largely unknown, with the last unequivocally demonstrated intermediate being (-)-matairesinol. Herein, massively parallel sequencing of Podophyllum hexandrum and Podophyllum peltatum transcriptomes and subsequent bioinformatics analyses of the corresponding assemblies were carried out. Validation of the assembly process was first achieved through confirmation of assembled sequences with those of various genes previously established as involved in podophyllotoxin biosynthesis as well as other candidate biosynthetic pathway genes. This contribution describes characterization of two of the latter, namely the cytochrome P450s, CYP719A23 from P. hexandrum and CYP719A24 from P. peltatum. Both enzymes were capable of converting (-)-matairesinol into (-)-pluviatolide by catalyzing methylenedioxy bridge formation and did not act on other possible substrates tested. Interestingly, the enzymes described herein were highly similar to methylenedioxy bridge-forming enzymes from alkaloid biosynthesis, whereas candidates more similar to lignan biosynthetic enzymes were catalytically inactive with the substrates employed. This overall strategy has thus enabled facile further identification of enzymes putatively involved in (-)-podophyllotoxin biosynthesis and underscores the deductive power of next generation sequencing and bioinformatics to probe and deduce medicinal plant biosynthetic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1997103956,"UHRF1 is an important epigenetic regulator connecting DNA methylation and histone methylations. UHRF1 is required for maintenance of DNA methylation through recruiting DNMT1 to DNA replication forks. Recent studies have shown that the plant homeodomain (PHD) of UHRF1 recognizes the N terminus of unmodified histone H3, and the interaction is inhibited by methylation of H3R2, whereas the tandem tudor domain (TTD) of UHRF1 recognizes trimethylated histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me3). However, how the two domains of UHRF1 coordinately recognize histone methylations remains elusive. In this report, we identified that PHD largely enhances the interaction between TTD and H3K9me3. We present the crystal structure of UHRF1 containing both TTD and PHD (TTD-PHD) in complex with H3K9m3 peptide at 3.0 Å resolution. The structure shows that TTD-PHD binds to the H3K9me3 peptide with 1:1 stoichiometry with the two domains connected by the H3K9me3 peptide and a linker region. The TTD interacts with residues Arg-8 and trimethylated Lys-9, and the PHD interacts with residues Ala-1, Arg-2, and Lys-4 of the H3K9me3 peptide. The biochemical experiments indicate that PHD-mediated recognition of unmodified H3 is independent of the TTD, whereas TTD-mediated recognition of H3K9me3 PHD. Thus, both TTD and PHD are essential for specific recognition of H3K9me3 by UHRF1. Interestingly, the H3K9me3 peptide induces conformational changes of TTD-PHD, which do not affect the autoubiquitination activity or hemimethylated DNA binding affinity of UHRF1 in vitro. Taken together, our studies provide structural insight into the coordinated recognition of H3K9me3 by the TTD and PHD of UHRF1."

In most other vertebrates the bones that make up the middle ear function as part of the lower jaw, limiting the potential for vertebrate convergence in this process. However, Montealegre-Z. et al.

This convergence, across millions of years of evolutionary distance, shows the flexibility of morphology to adapt to biophysical challenges."
https://openalex.org/W2017157967,"DNA damage or replication stress induces the activation of checkpoint kinases, pausing the cell cycle so that DNA repair can take place; checkpoint activation must be regulated to prevent the cell-cycle arrest from persisting after damage is repaired, and now the Slx4–Rtt107 complex is shown to regulate checkpoint kinase activity by directly monitoring DNA-damage signalling. DNA damage or replication stress induces the activation of checkpoint kinases, which pause the cell cycle so that DNA repair can take place. However, checkpoint activation must be regulated to prevent the cell-cycle arrest from persisting after damage is repaired. Marcus Smolka and colleagues have determined that a complex formed by the DNA repair scaffold proteins Slx4 and Rtt107 interacts with Dpb11 and phosphorylated histone H2A, which are positive regulators of the checkpoint adaptor, Rad9, that activates Rad53 kinase. In this way, Slx4–Rtt107 regulates checkpoint kinase activity by directly monitoring DNA damage, as measured by Dpb11 binding and H2A phosphorylation In response to genotoxic stress, a transient arrest in cell-cycle progression enforced by the DNA-damage checkpoint (DDC) signalling pathway positively contributes to genome maintenance1. Because hyperactivated DDC signalling can lead to a persistent and detrimental cell-cycle arrest2,3, cells must tightly regulate the activity of the kinases involved in this pathway. Despite their importance, the mechanisms for monitoring and modulating DDC signalling are not fully understood. Here we show that the DNA-repair scaffolding proteins Slx4 and Rtt107 prevent the aberrant hyperactivation of DDC signalling by lesions that are generated during DNA replication in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. On replication stress, cells lacking Slx4 or Rtt107 show hyperactivation of the downstream DDC kinase Rad53, whereas activation of the upstream DDC kinase Mec1 remains normal. An Slx4–Rtt107 complex counteracts the checkpoint adaptor Rad9 by physically interacting with Dpb11 and phosphorylated histone H2A, two positive regulators of Rad9-dependent Rad53 activation. A decrease in DDC signalling results from hypomorphic mutations in RAD53 and H2A and rescues the hypersensitivity to replication stress of cells lacking Slx4 or Rtt107. We propose that the Slx4–Rtt107 complex modulates Rad53 activation by a competition-based mechanism that balances the engagement of Rad9 at replication-induced lesions. Our findings show that DDC signalling is monitored and modulated through the direct action of DNA-repair factors."
https://openalex.org/W2008966834,"The G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) 55 (GPR55) and the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) are co-expressed in many tissues, predominantly in the central nervous system. Seven transmembrane spanning (7TM) receptors/GPCRs can form homo- and heteromers and initiate distinct signaling pathways. Recently, several synthetic CB1 receptor inverse agonists/antagonists, such as SR141716A, AM251, and AM281, were reported to activate GPR55. Of these, SR141716A was marketed as a promising anti-obesity drug, but was withdrawn from the market because of severe side effects. Here, we tested whether GPR55 and CB1 receptors are capable of (i) forming heteromers and (ii) whether such heteromers could exhibit novel signaling patterns. We show that GPR55 and CB1 receptors alter each others signaling properties in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. We demonstrate that the co-expression of FLAG-CB1 receptors in cells stably expressing HA-GPR55 specifically inhibits GPR55-mediated transcription factor activation, such as nuclear factor of activated T-cells and serum response element, as well as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) activation. GPR55 and CB1 receptors can form heteromers, but the internalization of both receptors is not affected. In addition, we observe that the presence of GPR55 enhances CB1R-mediated ERK1/2 and nuclear factor of activated T-cell activation. Our data provide the first evidence that GPR55 can form heteromers with another 7TM/GPCR and that this interaction with the CB1 receptor has functional consequences in vitro. The GPR55-CB1R heteromer may play an important physiological and/or pathophysiological role in tissues endogenously co-expressing both receptors."

Here, the zebrafish mct8 gene and promoter were isolated, and mct8 promoter-driven transgenic lines were used to show that, similar to humans, mct8 is primarily expressed in the nervous and vascular systems. Morpholino-based knockdown and rescue experiments revealed that MCT8 is strictly required for neural development in the brain and spinal cord.

https://openalex.org/W2026836146,"Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-3 (TIMP-3) plays a key role in regulating extracellular matrix turnover by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), adamalysins (ADAMs), and adamalysins with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTSs). We demonstrate that levels of this physiologically important inhibitor can be regulated post-translationally by endocytosis. TIMP-3 was endocytosed and degraded by a number of cell types including chondrocytes, fibroblasts, and monocytes, and we found that the endocytic receptor low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP-1) plays a major role in TIMP-3 internalization. However, the cellular uptake of TIMP-3 significantly slowed down after 10 h due to shedding of LRP-1 from the cell surface and formation of soluble LRP-1 (sLRP-1)-TIMP-3 complexes. Addition of TIMP-3 to HTB94 human chondrosarcoma cells increased the release of sLRP-1 fragments of 500, 215, 160, and 110 kDa into the medium in a concentration-dependent manner, and all of these fragments were able to bind to TIMP-3. TIMP-3 bound to sLRP-1, which was resistant to endocytosis, retained its inhibitory activity against metalloproteinases. Extracellular levels of sLRP-1 can thus increase the half-life of TIMP-3 in the extracellular space, controlling the bioavailability of TIMP-3 to inhibit metalloproteinases."
https://openalex.org/W2091817471,"Translocation of nucleic acid-sensing (NAS) Toll-like receptors (TLRs) to endosomes is essential for response to microbial nucleic acids as well as for prevention of the autoimmune response. The accessory protein UNC93B1 is indispensable for activation of NAS TLRs because it regulates their response through trafficking to endosomes. We observed that poly(I:C) up-regulates transcription of UNC93B1 and promotes trafficking of TLR3 to the plasma membrane in human epithelial cell line. Up-regulation of UNC93B1 is triggered through TLR3 activation by poly(I:C). Further studies revealed that expression of UNC93B1 promotes trafficking of differentially glycosylated TLR3, but not other NAS TLRs, to the plasma membrane. UNC93B1 promoter region contains binding sites for poly(I:C)- and type I interferon-inducible regulatory elements. UNC93B1 also increases the protein lifetime of TLR3 and TLR9 and augments signaling of all NAS TLRs. Furthermore, we discovered that poly(I:C) pretreatment primes B-cells to the activation by ssDNA via up-regulation of UNC93B1. Our findings identified TLR3 as the important regulator of UNC93B1 that in turn governs the responsiveness of all NAS TLRs.

https://openalex.org/W1987981314,"The multifunctional protein nucleolin (NCL) is overexpressed on the surface of activated endothelial and tumor cells and mediates the stimulatory actions of several angiogenic growth factors, such as pleiotrophin (PTN). Because α(v)β(3) integrin is also required for PTN-induced cell migration, the aim of the present work was to study the interplay between NCL and α(v)β(3) by using biochemical, immunofluorescence, and proximity ligation assays in cells with genetically altered expression of the studied molecules. Interestingly, cell surface NCL localization was detected only in cells expressing α(v)β(3) and depended on the phosphorylation of β(3) at Tyr(773) through receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase β/ζ (RPTPβ/ζ) and c-Src activation. Downstream of α(v)β(3,) PI3K activity mediated this phenomenon and cell surface NCL was found to interact with both α(v)β(3) and RPTPβ/ζ. Positive correlation of cell surface NCL and α(v)β(3) expression was also observed in human glioblastoma tissue arrays, and inhibition of cell migration by cell surface NCL antagonists was observed only in cells expressing α(v)β(3). Collectively, these data suggest that both expression and β(3) integrin phosphorylation at Tyr(773) determine the cell surface localization of NCL downstream of the RPTPβ/ζ/c-Src signaling cascade and can be used as a biomarker for the use of cell surface NCL antagonists as anticancer agents."
https://openalex.org/W2073003786,"Disruption of the circadian rhythm is now believed to associate with a number of hormone-related cancers, such as breast cancer, in which aberrant estrogen receptor-α (ERα) signaling is a major contributor. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the function of core clock proteins in cancer are still largely undefined. In this study, we showed that circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK), a key circadian protein, can interact with ERα. Furthermore, this interaction was enhanced by estrogen. We also showed that CLOCK can be sumoylated and sumoylation of CLOCK, which is also stimulated by estrogen, had two consequences: (1) it increased the transcriptional activity of CLOCK; and (2) it increased the CLOCK-modulated transcriptional activity of ERα, as shown by increased transcription of cyclin D1. Sumoylation of CLOCK occurred at two lysine residues, K67 and K851. The enhancement of ERα transcriptional activity exerted by wild-type but not mutant (2K/2R) CLOCK in response to estrogen indicated that sumoylation of CLOCK may have an important role in estrogen-dependent signaling. 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay conducted with breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7 and T47D) demonstrated that sumoylation of CLOCK stimulated cell growth and increased the proportion of S phase cells in the cell cycle. The results of this study uncovered new insight into the connection between a major circadian protein and a major estrogen-dependent transcription factor, providing the basis for further research into the involvement of circadian proteins in breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2114622348,"As an approach to elucidating dopamine transporter (DAT) phosphorylation characteristics, we examined in vitro phosphorylation of a recombinant rat DAT N-terminal peptide (NDAT) using purified protein kinases. We found that NDAT becomes phosphorylated at single distinct sites by protein kinase A (Ser-7) and calcium-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (Ser-13) and at multiple sites (Ser-4, Ser-7, and Ser-13) by protein kinase C (PKC), implicating these residues as potential sites of DAT phosphorylation by these kinases. Mapping of rat striatal DAT phosphopeptides by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography revealed basal and PKC-stimulated phosphorylation of the same peptide fragments and comigration of PKC-stimulated phosphopeptide fragments with NDAT Ser-7 phosphopeptide markers. We further confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis and mass spectrometry that Ser-7 is a site for PKC-stimulated phosphorylation in heterologously expressed rat and human DATs. Mutation of Ser-7 and nearby residues strongly reduced the affinity of rat DAT for the cocaine analog (-)-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-fluorophenyl) tropane (CFT), whereas in rat striatal tissue, conditions that promote DAT phosphorylation caused increased CFT affinity. Ser-7 mutation also affected zinc modulation of CFT binding, with Ala and Asp substitutions inducing opposing effects. These results identify Ser-7 as a major site for basal and PKC-stimulated phosphorylation of native and expressed DAT and suggest that Ser-7 phosphorylation modulates transporter conformational equilibria, shifting the transporter between high and low affinity cocaine binding states."
https://openalex.org/W2141961797,"Flooded rice fields are an important source of the greenhouse gas CH4. Possible carbon sources for CH4 and CO2 production in rice fields are soil organic matter (SOM), root organic carbon (ROC) and rice straw (RS), but partitioning of the flux between the different carbon sources is difficult. We conducted greenhouse experiments using soil microcosms planted with rice. The soil was amended with and without 13C-labeled RS, using two 13C-labeled RS treatments with equal RS (5 g kg−1 soil) but different δ13C of RS. This procedure allowed to determine the carbon flux from each of the three sources (SOM, ROC, RS) by determining the δ13C of CH4 and CO2 in the different incubations and from the δ13C of RS. Partitioning of carbon flux indicated that the contribution of ROC to CH4 production was 41% at tillering stage, increased with rice growth and was about 60% from the booting stage onwards. The contribution of ROC to CO2 was 43% at tillering stage, increased to around 70% at booting stage and stayed relatively constant afterwards. The contribution of RS was determined to be in a range of 12–24% for CH4 production and 11–31% for CO2 production; while the contribution of SOM was calculated to be 23–35% for CH4 production and 13–26% for CO2 production. The results indicate that ROC was the major source of CH4 though RS application greatly enhanced production and emission of CH4 in rice field soil. Our results also suggest that data of CH4 dissolved in rice field could be used as a proxy for the produced CH4 after tillering stage."
https://openalex.org/W2002409049,"During hemodynamic stress, catecholamines and neurohumoral stimuli may induce co-activation of G(q)-coupled receptors and β-adrenergic receptors (β-AR), leading to cardiac remodeling. Dynamic regulation of histone deacetylase 5 (HDAC5), a transcriptional repressor, is crucial during stress signaling due to its role in epigenetic control of fetal gene markers. Little is known about its regulation during acute and chronic β-AR stimulation and its cross-interaction with G(q) signaling in adult cardiac myocytes. Here, we evaluate the potential cross-talk between G(q)-driven and β-AR mediated signaling at the level of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of HDAC5. We show the translocation of GFP-tagged wild type HDAC5 or mutants (S279A and S279D) in response to β-AR or G(q) agonists. Isoproterenol (ISO) or PKA activation results in strong nuclear accumulation of HDAC5 in contrast to nuclear export driven by Ca(2+)-calmodulin protein kinase II and protein kinase D. Moreover, nuclear accumulation of HDAC5 under acute ISO/PKA signaling is dependent on phosphorylation of Ser-279 and can block subsequent G(q)-mediated nuclear HDAC5 export. Intriguingly, the attenuation of G(q)-induced export is abolished after chronic PKA activation, yet nuclear HDAC5 remains elevated. Last, the effect of chronic β-AR signaling on HDAC5 translocation was examined in adult myocytes from a rabbit model of heart failure, where ISO-induced nuclear import is ablated, but G(q)-agonist mediated export is preserved. Acute β-AR/PKA activation protects against hypertrophic signaling by delaying G(q)-mediated transcriptional activation. This serves as a key physiological control switch before allowing genetic reprogramming via HDAC5 nuclear export during more severe stress, such as heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W1989519809,"A highly sulfated 3-linked β-arabinan (Ab1) with arabinose in the pyranose form was obtained from green seaweed Codium vermilara (Bryopsidales). It comprised major amounts of units sulfated on C-2 and C-4 and constitutes the first polysaccharide of this type isolated in the pure form and fully characterized. Ab1 showed anticoagulant activity by global coagulation tests. Less sulfated arabinans obtained from the same seaweed have less or no activity. Ab1 exerts its activity through direct and indirect (antithrombin- and heparin cofactor II-mediated) inhibition of thrombin. Direct thrombin inhibition was studied in detail. By native PAGE, it was possible to detect formation of a complex between Ab1 and human thrombin (HT). Ab1 binding to HT was measured by fluorescence spectroscopy. CD spectra of the Ab1 complex suggested that ligand binding induced a small conformational change on HT. Ab1-thrombin interactions were studied by molecular dynamic simulations using the persulfated octasaccharide as model compound. Most carbohydrate-protein contacts would occur by interaction of sulfate groups with basic amino acid residues on the surface of the enzyme, more than 60% of them being performed by the exosite 2-composing residues. In these interactions, the sulfate groups on C-2 were shown to interact more intensely with the thrombin structure. In contrast, the disulfated oligosaccharide does not promote major conformational modifications at the catalytic site when complexed to exosite 1. These results show that this novel pyranosic sulfated arabinan Ab1 exerts its anticoagulant activity by a mechanism different from those found previously for other sulfated polysaccharides and glycosaminoglycans."
https://openalex.org/W2052025730,"Once released by HIV(+) cells, p17 binds heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) and CXCR1 on leukocytes causing their dysfunction. By exploiting an approach integrating computational modeling, site-directed mutagenesis of p17, chemical desulfation of heparin, and surface plasmon resonance, we characterized the interaction of p17 with heparin, a HSPG structural analog, and CXCR1. p17 binds to heparin with an affinity (K(d) = 190 nm) that is similar to those of other heparin-binding viral proteins. Two stretches of basic amino acids (basic motifs) are present in p17 N and C termini. Neutralization (Arg→Ala substitution) of the N-terminal, but not of the C-terminal basic motif, causes the loss of p17 heparin-binding capacity. The N-terminal heparin-binding motif of p17 partially overlaps the CXCR1-binding domain. Accordingly, its neutralization prevents also p17 binding to the chemochine receptor. Competition experiments demonstrated that free heparin and heparan sulfate (HS), but not selectively 2-O-, 6-O-, and N-O desulfated heparins, prevent p17 binding to substrate-immobilized heparin, indicating that the sulfate groups of the glycosaminoglycan mediate p17 interaction. Evaluation of the p17 antagonist activity of a panel of biotechnological heparins derived by chemical sulfation of the Escherichia coli K5 polysaccharide revealed that the highly N,O-sulfated derivative prevents the binding of p17 to both heparin and CXCR1, thus inhibiting p17-driven chemotactic migration of human monocytes with an efficiency that is higher than those of heparin and HS. Here, we characterized at a molecular level the interaction of p17 with its cellular receptors, laying the basis for the development of heparin-mimicking p17 antagonists."
https://openalex.org/W2033582666,"Escherichia coli γ complex clamp loader functions to load the β sliding clamp onto sites of DNA replication and repair. The clamp loader uses the energy of ATP binding and hydrolysis to drive conformational changes allowing for β binding and opening, DNA binding, and then release of the β·DNA complex. Although much work has been done studying the sliding clamp and clamp loader mechanism, kinetic analysis of the events following β·γ complex·DNA formation is not complete. Using fluorescent clamp closing and release assays, we show that β closing is faster than β release, indicating that γ complex closes β before releasing it around DNA. Using a fluorescent ATP hydrolysis assay, we show that there is a burst of ATP hydrolysis before β closing and that β release may be the rate-limiting step in the overall clamp loading reaction. The combined use of these fluorescent assays provides a unique perspective into the E. coli clamp loader by providing a measure of the relative timing of different events in the clamp loading reaction, helping to elucidate the complicated clamp loading mechanism."

Furthermore, Gal-3 regulates p21 expression at the post-translational level by stabilizing p21 protein via the carbohydrate-recognition domain. This is the first report suggesting a molecular function not yet described for Gal-3 as the regulator of p21 protein stability. This study provides a unique insight into the relationship of these two molecules during prostate cancer progression, and may provide a novel therapeutic target."
https://openalex.org/W2049883540,"The anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C) is an ubiquitin ligase that functions during mitosis. Here we identify the transcriptional regulator, transcriptional intermediary factor 1γ, TIF1γ, as an APC/C-interacting protein that regulates APC/C function. TIF1γ is not a substrate for APC/C-dependent ubiquitylation but instead, associates specifically with the APC/C holoenzyme and Cdc20 to affect APC/C activity and progression through mitosis. RNA interference studies indicate that TIF1γ knockdown results in a specific reduction in APC/C ubiquitin ligase activity, the stabilization of APC/C substrates, and an increase in the time taken for cells to progress through mitosis from nuclear envelope breakdown to anaphase. TIF1γ knockdown cells are also characterized by the inappropriate presence of cyclin A at metaphase, and an increase in the number of cells that fail to undergo metaphase-to-anaphase transition. Expression of a small interfering RNA-resistant TIF1γ species relieves the mitotic phenotype imposed by TIF1γ knockdown and allows for mitotic progression. Binding studies indicate that TIF1γ is also a component of the APC/C-mitotic checkpoint complex (MCC), but is not required for MCC dissociation from the APC/C once the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is satisfied. TIF1γ inactivation also results in chromosome misalignment at metaphase and SAC activation; inactivation of the SAC relieves the mitotic block imposed by TIF1γ knockdown. Together these data define novel functions for TIF1γ during mitosis and suggest that a reduction in APC/C ubiquitin ligase activity promotes SAC activation."
https://openalex.org/W1984551026,"Plexin C1 is a type I transmembrane receptor with intrinsic R-Ras GTPase activity, which regulates cytoskeletal remodeling and adhesion in normal human melanocytes. Melanocytes are pigment-producing cells of the epidermis, precursors for melanoma, and express high levels of Plexin C1, which is lost in melanoma in vitro and in vivo. To determine if Plexin C1 is a tumor suppressor for melanoma, we introduced Plexin C1 into a primary human melanoma cell line, and phenotypes including migration, apoptosis, proliferation and tumor growth in mice were analyzed. Complimentary studies in which Plexin C1 was silenced in human melanocytes were performed. Plexin C1 significantly inhibited migration and proliferation in melanoma, whereas in melanocytes, loss of Plexin C1 increased migration and proliferation. In mouse xenografts, Plexin C1 delayed tumor growth of melanoma at early time points, but tumors eventually escaped the suppressive effects of Plexin C1, due to Plexin C1-dependent activation of the pro-survival protein Akt. R-Ras activation stimulates melanoma migration. Plexin C1 lowered R-Ras activity in melanoma and melanocytes, consistent with inhibitory effects of Plexin C1 on migration of melanocytes and melanoma. To determine if R-Ras is expressed in melanocytic lesions in vivo, staining of tissue microarrays of nevi and melanoma were performed. R-Ras expression was highly limited in melanocytic lesions, being essentially confined to primary melanoma, and almost completely absent in nevi and metastatic melanoma. These data suggest that loss of Plexin C1 in melanoma may promote early steps in melanoma progression through suppression of migration and proliferation, but pro-survival effects of Plexin C1 ultimately abrogate the tumor suppressive effects of Plexin C1. In primary melanoma, loss of Plexin C1 may function in early steps of melanoma progression by releasing inhibition of R-Ras activation, and stimulating migration."
https://openalex.org/W2046412986,"Numerous cofactors modulate the gene regulatory activity of glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) by affecting one or more of the following three major transcriptional properties: the maximal activity of agonists (A(max)), the potency of agonists (EC(50)), and the partial agonist activity of antisteroids (PAA). Here, we report that the recently described nuclear protein, Pax2 transactivation domain interaction protein (PTIP)-associated protein 1 (PA1), is a new inhibitor of GR transactivation. PA1 suppresses A(max), increases the EC(50), and reduces the PAA of an exogenous reporter gene in a manner that is independent of associated PTIP. PA1 is fully active with, and strongly binds to, the C-terminal half of GR. PA1 reverses the effects of the coactivator TIF2 on GR-mediated gene induction but is unable to augment the actions of the corepressor SMRT. Analysis of competition assays between PA1 and TIF2 with an exogenous reporter indicates that the kinetic definition of PA1 action is a competitive decelerator at two sites upstream from where TIF2 acts. With the endogenous genes IGFBP1 and IP6K3, PA1 also represses GR induction, increases the EC(50), and decreases the PAA. ChIP and re-ChIP experiments indicate that PA1 accomplishes this inhibition of the two genes via different mechanisms as follows: PA1 appears to increase GR dissociation from and reduce GR transactivation at the IGFBP1 promoter regions but blocks GR binding to the IP6K3 promoter. We conclude that PA1 is a new competitive decelerator of GR transactivation and can act at more than one molecularly defined step in a manner that depends upon the specific gene."
https://openalex.org/W2070942920,"In our attempt to screen for substrates of Src family kinases in glioblastoma, Src kinase-associated phosphoprotein 2 (SKAP2) was identified. Although SKAP2 has been suggested to be associated with integrin-mediated adhesion of hematopoietic cells, little is known about its molecular function and the effects in other types of cells and tumors. Here, we demonstrate that SKAP2 physically associates with actin assembly factors WAVE2 and cortactin and inhibits their interaction. Cortactin is required for the membrane localization of WAVE2, and SKAP2 suppresses actin polymerization mediated by WAVE2 and cortactin in vitro. Knockdown of SKAP2 in NIH3T3 accelerated cell migration and enhanced translocation of WAVE2 to the cell membrane, and those effects of SKAP2 depend on the binding activity of SKAP2 to WAVE2. Furthermore, reduction of SKAP2 in the glioblastoma promoted tumor invasion both in ex vivo organotypic rat brain slices and immune-deficient mouse brains. These results suggest that SKAP2 negatively regulates cell migration and tumor invasion in fibroblasts and glioblastoma cells by suppressing actin assembly induced by the WAVE2-cortactin complex, indicating that SKAP2 may be a novel candidate for the suppressor of tumor progression.Background: Src kinase-associated phosphoprotein 2 (SKAP2) is a substrate of Src family kinases.Results: SKAP2 suppresses actin polymerization and cell migration by inhibiting the interaction between WAVE2 and cortactin.Conclusion: SKAP2 is a negative regulator of actin assembly and tumor invasion.Significance: The novel function of SKAP2 was found as a candidate for the suppressor of tumor invasion.

https://openalex.org/W2032086110,"Epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) in the kidneys is critical for Na(+) balance, extracellular volume, and blood pressure. Altered ENaC function is associated with respiratory disorders, pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1, and Liddle syndrome. ENaC is known to interact with components of the cytoskeleton, but the functional roles remain largely unclear. Here, we examined the interaction between ENaC and filamins, important actin filament components. We first discovered by yeast two-hybrid screening that the C termini of ENaC α and β subunits bind filamin A, B, and C, and we then confirmed the binding by in vitro biochemical assays. We demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation that ENaC, either overexpressed in HEK, HeLa, and melanoma A7 cells or natively expressed in LLC-PK1 and IMCD cells, is in the same complex with native filamin. Furthermore, the biotinylation and co-immunoprecipitation combined assays showed the ENaC-filamin interaction on the cell surface. Using Xenopus oocyte expression and two-electrode voltage clamp electrophysiology, we found that co-expression of an ENaC-binding domain of filamin substantially reduces ENaC channel function. Western blot and immunohistochemistry experiments revealed that the filamin A C terminus (FLNAC) modestly reduces the expression of the ENaC α subunit in oocytes and A7 cells. After normalizing the current by plasma membrane expression, we found that FLNAC results in ~50% reduction in the ENaC channel activity. The inhibitory effect of FLNAC was confirmed by lipid bilayer electrophysiology experiments using purified ENaC and FLNAC proteins, which showed that FLNAC substantially reduces ENaC single channel open probability. Taken together, our study demonstrated that filamin reduces ENaC channel function through direct interaction on the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1967871801,"Supraphysiological mechanical stretching in smooth muscle results in decreased contractile activity. However, the mechanism is unclear. Previous studies indicated that intestinal motility dysfunction after edema development is associated with increased smooth muscle stress and decreased myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation in vivo, providing an ideal model for studying mechanical stress-mediated decrease in smooth muscle contraction. Primary human intestinal smooth muscle cells (hISMCs) were subjected to either control cyclical stretch (CCS) or edema (increasing) cyclical stretch (ECS), mimicking the biophysical forces in non-edematous and edematous intestinal smooth muscle in vivo. ECS induced significant decreases in phosphorylation of MLC and MLC phosphatase targeting subunit (MYPT1) and a significant increase in p21-activated kinase (PAK) activity compared with CCS. PAK regulated MLC phosphorylation in an activity-dependent biphasic manner. PAK activation increased MLC and MYPT1 phosphorylation in CCS but decreased MLC and MYPT1 phosphorylation in hISMCs subjected to ECS. PAK inhibition had the opposite results. siRNA studies showed that PAK1 plays a critical role in regulating MLC phosphorylation in hISMCs. PAK1 enhanced MLC phosphorylation via phosphorylating MYPT1 on Thr-696, whereas PAK1 inhibited MLC phosphorylation via decreasing MYPT1 on both Thr-696 and Thr-853. Importantly, in vivo data indicated that PAK activity increased in edematous tissue, and inhibition of PAK in edematous intestine improved intestinal motility. We conclude that PAK1 positively regulates MLC phosphorylation in intestinal smooth muscle through increasing inhibitory phosphorylation of MYPT1 under physiologic conditions, whereas PAK1 negatively regulates MLC phosphorylation via inhibiting MYPT1 phosphorylation when PAK activity is increased under pathologic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2166655070,"The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), a major pore-forming protein in the outer membrane of mitochondria, is also found in the plasma membrane of a large number of cells where in addition to its role in regulating cellular ATP release and volume control it is important for maintaining redox homeostasis. Cell surface VDAC is a receptor for plasminogen kringle 5, which promotes partial closure of the channel. In this study, we demonstrate that VDAC binds tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) on human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells. Binding of t-PA to VDAC induced a decrease in K(m) and an increase in the V(max) for activation of its substrate, plasminogen (Pg). This resulted in accelerated Pg activation when VDAC, t-PA, and Pg were bound together. VDAC is also a substrate for plasmin; hence, it mimics fibrin activity. Binding of t-PA to VDAC occurs between a t-PA fibronectin type I finger domain located between amino acids Ile(5) and Asn(37) and a VDAC region including amino acids (20)GYGFG(24). These VDAC residues correspond to a GXXXG repeat motif commonly found in amyloid β peptides that is necessary for aggregation when these peptides form fibrillar deposits on the cell surface. Furthermore, we also show that Pg kringle 5 is a substrate for the NADH-dependent reductase activity of VDAC. This ternary complex is an efficient proteolytic complex that may facilitate removal of amyloid β peptide deposits from the normal brain and cell debris from injured brain tissue."

Identification of novel tumor antigens in SCCHN will facilitate the identification of potential novel treatment targets. Tumor antigens are proteins selectively expressed by tumor cells and recognized by the host immune system. Phage-displayed tumor antigens were enriched by biopanning with normal and then SCCHN-specific serum. Ninety-six phage clones were sequenced for identification, and 21 clones were validated using Luminex. One of these proteins, L23, a novel tumor antigen in SCCHN, was validated as an oncogene. L23 is upregulated in SCCHN compared with normal keratinocytes. Knockdown of L23 inhibited proliferation, invasion and cell survival. Overexpression of L23 had the reverse effect. Overexpression of L23 in non malignant cells led to transformation. Injection of SCCHN cells with knockdown of L23 in mice, induced tumors that were significantly smaller than control tumors. In conclusion, the immunomic screen yielded a panel of antigens specific to SCCHN; one of these proteins, L23, is a novel oncogene in SCCHN."
https://openalex.org/W2017663496,"Cdc25B phosphatases have a key role in G2/M cell-cycle progression by activating the CDK1-cyclinB1 complexes and functioning as important targets of checkpoints. Overexpression of Cdc25B results in a bypass of the G2/M checkpoint and illegitimate entry into mitosis. It can also cause replicative stress, which leads to genomic instability. Thus, fine-tuning of the Cdc25B expression level is critical for correct cell-cycle arrest in response to DNA damage. In response to genotoxic stress, Cdc25B is mainly regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms affecting either Cdc25B protein stability or translation. Here, we show that upon DNA damage Cdc25B can be regulated at the transcriptional level. Although ionizing radiation downregulates Cdc25B in a p53-dependent pathway, doxorubicin transcriptionally upregulates Cdc25B in p53-proficient cancer cells. We show that in the presence of wild-type p53, doxorubicin activates the Cdc25B promoter by preventing the binding of Sp1 and increasing the binding of NF-Y on the Cdc25B promoter, thus preventing p53 from downregulating this promoter. Our results highlight the mechanistically distinct regulation of the three Cdc25 phosphatases by checkpoint signalling following doxorubicin treatment."
