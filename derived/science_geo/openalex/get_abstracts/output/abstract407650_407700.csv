https://openalex.org/W2073256527,"The ability to analyze multiple single-cell parameters is critical for understanding cellular heterogeneity. Despite recent advances in measurement technology, methods for analyzing high-dimensional single-cell data are often subjective, labor intensive and require prior knowledge of the biological system. To objectively uncover cellular heterogeneity from single-cell measurements, we present a versatile computational approach, spanning-tree progression analysis of density-normalized events (SPADE). We applied SPADE to flow cytometry data of mouse bone marrow and to mass cytometry data of human bone marrow. In both cases, SPADE organized cells in a hierarchy of related phenotypes that partially recapitulated well-described patterns of hematopoiesis. We demonstrate that SPADE is robust to measurement noise and to the choice of cellular markers. SPADE facilitates the analysis of cellular heterogeneity, the identification of cell types and comparison of functional markers in response to perturbations."

https://openalex.org/W2019645050,"IL-36α, IL-36β, and IL-36γ (formerly IL-1F6, IL-1F8, and IL-1F9) are IL-1 family members that signal through the IL-1 receptor family members IL-1Rrp2 (IL-1RL2) and IL-1RAcP. IL-36Ra (formerly IL-1F5) has been reported to antagonize IL-36γ. However, our previous attempts to demonstrate IL-36Ra antagonism were unsuccessful. Here, we demonstrate that IL-36Ra antagonist activity is dependent upon removal of its N-terminal methionine. IL-36Ra starting at Val-2 is fully active and capable of inhibiting not only IL-36γ but also IL-36α and IL-36β. Val-2 of IL-36Ra lies 9 amino acids N-terminal to an A-X-Asp motif conserved in all IL-1 family members. In further experiments, we show that truncation of IL-36α, IL-36β, and IL-36γ to this same point increased their specific activity by ∼103–104-fold (from EC50 1 μg/ml to EC50 1 ng/ml). Inhibition of truncated IL-36β activity required ∼102–103-fold excess IL-36Ra, similar to the ratio required for IL-1Ra to inhibit IL-1β. Chimeric receptor experiments demonstrated that the extracellular (but not cytoplasmic) domain of IL-1Rrp2 or IL-1R1 is required for inhibition by their respective natural antagonists. IL-36Ra bound to IL-1Rrp2, and pretreatment of IL-1Rrp2-expressing cells with IL-36Ra prevented IL-36β-mediated co-immunoprecipitation of IL-1Rrp2 with IL-1RAcP. Taken together, these results suggest that the mechanism of IL-36Ra antagonism is analogous to that of IL-1Ra, such that IL-36Ra binds to IL-1Rrp2 and prevents IL-1RAcP recruitment and the formation of a functional signaling complex. In addition, truncation of IL-36α, IL-36β, and IL-36γ dramatically enhances their activity, suggesting that post-translational processing is required for full activity.

https://openalex.org/W2095872187,"Humans are noted for their capacity to over-ride self-interest in favor of normatively valued goals. We examined the neural circuitry that is causally involved in normative, fairness-related decisions by generating a temporarily diminished capacity for costly normative behavior, a 'deviant' case, through non-invasive brain stimulation (repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation) and compared normal subjects' functional magnetic resonance imaging signals with those of the deviant subjects. When fairness and economic self-interest were in conflict, normal subjects (who make costly normative decisions at a much higher frequency) displayed significantly higher activity in, and connectivity between, the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the posterior ventromedial prefrontal cortex (pVMPFC). In contrast, when there was no conflict between fairness and economic self-interest, both types of subjects displayed identical neural patterns and behaved identically. These findings suggest that a parsimonious prefrontal network, the activation of right DLPFC and pVMPFC, and the connectivity between them, facilitates subjects' willingness to incur the cost of normative decisions."
https://openalex.org/W2056657560,"We identified complex genomic rearrangements consisting of intermixed duplications and triplications of genomic segments at the MECP2 and PLP1 loci. These complex rearrangements were characterized by a triplicated segment embedded within a duplication in 11 unrelated subjects. Notably, only two breakpoint junctions were generated during each rearrangement formation. All the complex rearrangement products share a common genomic organization, duplication-inverted triplication-duplication (DUP-TRP/INV-DUP), in which the triplicated segment is inverted and located between directly oriented duplicated genomic segments. We provide evidence that the DUP-TRP/INV-DUP structures are mediated by inverted repeats that can be separated by >300 kb, a genomic architecture that apparently leads to susceptibility to such complex rearrangements. A similar inverted repeat-mediated mechanism may underlie structural variation in many other regions of the human genome. We propose a mechanism that involves both homology-driven events, via inverted repeats, and microhomologous or nonhomologous events."

https://openalex.org/W2104176117,"The outer membrane protein A (OmpA) plays important roles in anchoring of the outer membrane to the bacterial cell wall. The C-terminal periplasmic domain of OmpA (OmpA-like domain) associates with the peptidoglycan (PGN) layer noncovalently. However, there is a paucity of information on the structural aspects of the mechanism of PGN recognition by OmpA-like domains. To elucidate this molecular recognition process, we solved the high-resolution crystal structure of an OmpA-like domain from Acinetobacter baumannii bound to diaminopimelate (DAP), a unique bacterial amino acid from the PGN. The structure clearly illustrates that two absolutely conserved Asp271 and Arg286 residues are the key to the binding to DAP of PGN. Identification of DAP as the central anchoring site of PGN to OmpA is further supported by isothermal titration calorimetry and a pulldown assay with PGN. An NMR-based computational model for complexation between the PGN and OmpA emerged, and this model is validated by determining the crystal structure in complex with a synthetic PGN fragment. These structural data provide a detailed glimpse of how the anchoring of OmpA to the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria takes place in a DAP-dependent manner.—Park, J. S., Lee, W. C., Yeo, K.

https://openalex.org/W2011098822,Cytokinins are classic hormones that orchestrate plant growth and development and the integrity of stem cell populations. Cytokinin receptors are eukaryotic sensor histidine kinases that are activated by both naturally occurring adenine-type cytokinins and urea-based synthetic compounds. Crystal structures of the Arabidopsis thaliana histidine kinase 4 sensor domain in complex with different cytokinin ligands now rationalize the hormone-binding specificity of the receptor and may spur the design of new cytokinin ligands.

https://openalex.org/W2150160771,"Drug resistance is a major cause of cancer treatment failure, with multidrug resistance (MDR) being the most serious, whereby cancer cells display cross-resistance to structurally and functionally unrelated drugs. MDR is caused by overexpression of the efflux transporters P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1). These transporters act to maintain sublethal intracellular drug concentrations within the cancer cell, making the population treatment unresponsive. Recently, we discovered a novel nongenetic basis to MDR whereby microparticles (MPs) transfer P-gp intercellularly from MDR donor cells to drug-sensitive recipient cells. MPs isolated from MDR leukemia and breast cancer cells were cocultured with their drug-sensitive counterparts. P-gp transfer was assessed by direct immunolabeling, and acquired transcripts and regulatory microRNAs by quantitative real-time PCR. We show that MDR MPs incorporate nucleic acids; MPs change recipient cells' transcriptional environment to reflect donor MDR phenotype, and distinct pathways exist among cancers of different origin that may be dependent on donor cells' ABCB1 overexpression. We demonstrate that this pathway exists for both hematological and nonhematological malignancies. By conferring MDR and “retemplating” the transcriptional landscape of recipient cells, MPs provide a novel pathway, having implications in the dissemination and acquisition of deleterious traits in clinical oncology.—Jaiswal, R., Gong, J., Sambasivam, S., Combes, V., Mathys, J.-M., Davey, R., Grau, G.

https://openalex.org/W2160857148,"Proteins employ aromatic residues for carbohydrate binding in a wide range of biological functions. Glycoside hydrolases, which are ubiquitous in nature, typically exhibit tunnels, clefts, or pockets lined with aromatic residues for processing carbohydrates. Mutation of these aromatic residues often results in significant activity differences on insoluble and soluble substrates. However, the thermodynamic basis and molecular level role of these aromatic residues remain unknown. Here, we calculate the relative ligand binding free energy by mutating tryptophans in the Trichoderma reesei family 6 cellulase (Cel6A) to alanine. Removal of aromatic residues near the catalytic site has little impact on the ligand binding free energy, suggesting that aromatic residues immediately upstream of the active site are not directly involved in binding, but play a role in the glucopyranose ring distortion necessary for catalysis. Removal of aromatic residues at the entrance and exit of the Cel6A tunnel, however, dramatically impacts the binding affinity, suggesting that these residues play a role in chain acquisition and product stabilization, respectively. The roles suggested from differences in binding affinity are confirmed by molecular dynamics and normal mode analysis. Surprisingly, our results illustrate that aromatic-carbohydrate interactions vary dramatically depending on the position in the enzyme tunnel. As aromatic-carbohydrate interactions are present in all carbohydrate-active enzymes, these results have implications for understanding protein structure-function relationships in carbohydrate metabolism and recognition, carbon turnover in nature, and protein engineering strategies for biomass utilization.

(36Horn S.J. Sikorski P. Cederkvist J.B. Vaaje-Kolstad G. S⊘rlie M. Synstad B. Vriend G. Vårum K.M. Eijsink V.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

They demonstrated that a single mutation (W97A) directly upstream of the catalytic site in ChiB significantly reduced the ability of the enzyme to degrade crystalline chitin, but increased the conversion rate by 29-fold on soluble chitosan. The authors also measured the degree of processivity between the wild type ChiB and the W97A mutant and demonstrated that the W97A mutation converted ChiB to a nonprocessive enzyme, even on soluble substrates (36Horn S.J. Sikorski P. Cederkvist J.B. Vaaje-Kolstad G. S⊘rlie M. Synstad B. Vriend G. Vårum K.M. Eijsink V.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 18089-18094Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The same group later demonstrated similar trends for another S. marcescens chitinase, ChiA (38Zakariassen H. Aam B.B. Horn S.J. Vårum K.M. S⊘rlie M. Eijsink V.G.H. J. Biol.

Overall, this work suggests that the ability for an enzyme to be processive on insoluble substrates comes at a significant detriment to its substrate turnover frequency. For aromatic-carbohydrate interactions in cellulases, a tryptophan residue (Trp-272) at the entrance to the tunnel of the processive family 6 cellulase, Cel6A, from Trichoderma reesei (an anamorph of Hypocrea jecorina), was mutated to alanine and aspartic acid (39Koivula A.

In both cases, the activity of the mutant on crystalline cellulose was significantly reduced, whereas the activity on amorphous cellulose was not affected (39Koivula A. Kinnari T. Harjunpää V. Ruohonen L. Teleman A. Drakenberg T. Rouvinen J. Jones T.A. Teeri T.T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 429: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). The authors interpret these results to suggest that the entrance tryptophan residue in Cel6A is crucial in binding to cellodextrin chains in crystalline substrates but plays little functional role when the substrate is more accessible. Similar observations have been made for Cel7A (43Igarashi K. Koivula A. Wada M. Kimura S. Penttilä M. Samejima M. J. Biol.

Wilson D.B. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2009; 75: 6655-6661Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) mutated a tryptophan (Trp-464) in Thermobifida fusca Cel6B directly upstream of the catalytic site to alanine and tyrosine. For both mutations, they observed reduced activity on crystalline cellulose and increased activity on amorphous and soluble substrates, although the extent of processivity on filter paper was similar to the wild type. The authors concluded that Trp-464 helps to bind the cellulose chain to the active site tunnel, but based on increased activity on various accessible substrates, this function is not necessary for noncrystalline substrates. It is worthwhile to note that processivity has been measured in distinctly different ways for the cellulases and chitinases discussed above and thus may not be directly comparable. We recently combined observations from the work of Horn et al. (36Horn S.J. Sikorski P. Cederkvist J.B. Vaaje-Kolstad G. S⊘rlie M. Synstad B. Vriend G. Vårum K.M. Eijsink V.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

We hypothesize that the work that an enzyme must conduct to decrystallize a carbohydrate polymer from a crystalline substrate is directly offset by a favorable ligand binding free energy (31Beckham G.T.

By removing aromatic residues in processive enzyme tunnels, the ligand binding free energy may be reduced sufficiently to switch the function from a processive enzyme to a nonprocessive enzyme; however, in the case of modified substrates that are either more accessible (48Jeoh T. Ishizawa C.I. Davis M.F. Himmel M.E. Adney W.S. Johnson D.K. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2007; 98: 112-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) or easier to decrystallize (45Beckham G.T. Matthews J.F.

This, in turn, could lower production costs for the burgeoning renewable fuels and chemicals industry. Quantitative understanding of the effects of the aromatic-carbohydrate interactions in cellulase tunnels is thus a key factor in the rational design of new cellulases and other carbohydrate-active enzymes. Understanding the role that aromatic-carbohydrate interactions play in the structure and function of carbohydrate-active enzymes is similarly important. This remains an open question, for which molecular level simulations can offer unique insights. We use thermodynamic integration (TI) (50Kirkwood J.G. J. Chem.

Cel6A is a nonreducing end-specific enzyme with six binding sites numbered +4 (upstream of the catalytic site) to −2 (down the tunnel from the catalytic site), as shown in Fig. 1. The Cel6A catalytic domain tunnel exhibits tryptophan residues (Trp-135, Trp-269, Trp-272, and Trp-367), which we mutate individually to alanine. The TI calculations were performed using NAMD with dual topology methodology, wherein a hybrid residue containing atoms from both the tryptophan and alanine interacts with the system over a scaled coupling parameter during the transformation from reactant to product (50Kirkwood J.G. J. Chem. Phys. 1935; 3: 300-313Crossref Scopus (2522) Google Scholar, 53Frenkel, D., Smit, B.

Phys. 1991; 95: 1175-1188Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar). The atoms of the hybrid residue do not interact with each other over the course of the simulation. In the TI simulations, the tryptophan is referred to as the reactant and the alanine as the product. The change in free energy was determined through numerical integration of sets of simulations probing the electrostatics and van der Waals interactions separately. The free energies, G, for each state were then combined according to Equation 1 to obtain the relative ligand binding free energy, ΔΔG, where the states are wild type (reactant) to mutant (product). ΔΔG=(Gmut-bound-Gmut-free)-(Gwt-bound-Gwt-free)=(Gmut-bound-Gwt-bound)-(Gmut-free-Gwt-free)(Eq. 1) The alchemical cycle for measuring ΔΔG is shown under supplemental Figs. S1 and S2 along with error analysis details. From the ΔΔG for each mutation, we determined the binding affinity for all point mutations as in Equation 2, ΔΔG=-RTIn(KwTKmut)(Eq. 2) where ΔΔG is the relative binding free energy, R is the universal gas constant, T is absolute temperature, and Kmut and KWT are the partition coefficients for the mutant and wild type structures, respectively. All of the TI simulations were started using a snapshot at 18 ns from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations as described below. Simulations from which the TI data were collected were equilibrated for an additional 0.5 ns prior to collection of 14.5 ns of TI data. In addition to the TI calculations, we use long MD simulations (250 ns) to quantify the energetics and fluctuations along the catalytic tunnels of the wild type and four mutant enzymes. These MD simulations provide insights into the role of the aromatic residues as a function of location in the tunnel in ligand acquisition and stabilization. CHARMM (56Brooks B.R. Brooks 3rd, C.L.

https://openalex.org/W1975725271,"Current treatments and emerging oral therapies for multiple sclerosis (MS) are limited by effectiveness, cost, and/or toxicity. Genetic and environmental factors that alter the branching of Asn (N)-linked glycans result in T cell hyperactivity, promote spontaneous inflammatory demyelination and neurodegeneration in mice, and converge to regulate the risk of MS. The sugar N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) enhances N-glycan branching and inhibits T cell activity and adoptive transfer experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Here, we report that oral GlcNAc inhibits T-helper 1 (Th1) and T-helper 17 (Th17) responses and attenuates the clinical severity of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced EAE when administered after disease onset. Oral GlcNAc increased expression of branched N-glycans in T cells in vivo as shown by high pH anion exchange chromatography, MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy and FACS analysis with the plant lectin l-phytohemagglutinin. Initiating oral GlcNAc treatment on the second day of clinical disease inhibited MOG-induced EAE as well as secretion of interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-17, and interleukin-22. In the more severe 2D2 T cell receptor transgenic EAE model, oral GlcNAc initiated after disease onset also inhibits clinical disease, except for those with rapid lethal progression. These data suggest that oral GlcNAc may provide an inexpensive and nontoxic oral therapeutic agent for MS that directly targets an underlying molecular mechanism causal of disease."

Among them, FcγRI is the only high affinity receptor for IgG and thus is a potential target for immunotherapy. Here we report the first crystal structure of an FcγRI with all three extracellular Ig-like domains (designated as D1, D2, and D3). The structure shows that, first, FcγRI has an acute D1-D2 hinge angle similar to that of FcϵRI but much smaller than those observed in the low affinity Fcγ receptors. Second, the D3 domain of FcγRI is positioned away from the putative IgG binding site on the receptor and is thus unlikely to make direct contacts with Fc. Third, the replacement of FcγRIII FG-loop (171LVGSKNV177) with that of FcγRI (171MGKHRY176) resulted in a 15-fold increase in IgG1 binding affinity, whereas a valine insertion in the FcγRI FG-loop (171MVGKHRY177) abolished the affinity enhancement. Thus, the FcγRI FG-loop with its conserved one-residue deletion is critical to the high affinity IgG binding. The structural results support FcγRI binding to IgG in a similar mode as its low affinity counterparts.

Most Fc receptors belong to the Ig superfamily except for FcRn and FcϵRII (CD23), which display class I major histocompatibility antigens and C-type lectins folds, respectively. Immunoglobulins G are the most abundant antibodies in humans and their receptors, which include FcγRI(CD64), FcγRIIA, B, C (CD32), and FcγRIII (CD16) (10Daëron M. Annu. Rev.

Among them, FcγRI, FcγRIIA, and FcγRIII are activating receptors that either require the association with an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) containing FcR common γ chain (FcγRI and FcγRIII) or bear an ITAM in their cytoplasmic tail (FcγRIIA and IIC) (8Ravetch J.V.

FcγRIIB is an inhibitory receptor that contains an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif within its cytoplasmic domain. According to the binding affinities to their cognate antibodies, FcγRI and FcϵRI are high affinity receptors with dissociation constants ranging from 10−8 to 10−10 m (7Hulett M.D. Hogarth P.M. Adv.

Before crystallization, FcγRI was dialyzed against 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and 0.1 m NaCl and concentrated to a final A280 nm of 29. The crystals used for data collection were grown in hanging drops at 22 °C using 1 μl of protein and 1 μl of reservoir solution (10% PEG8000 and 10% PEG1000). The crystals were immersed in cryoprotectant (10% PEG8000, 10% PEG1000, and 20% glycerol) before flash-cooling in liquid nitrogen. The x-ray data were collected to 2.65 Å resolution at SER-CAT beamlines and processed with HKL2000 (20Otwinowski Z.M.W.

The structure of the FcγRI ectodomain was solved by a molecular replacement method with the program Bables (21Long F. Vagin A.A. Young P. Murshudov G.N. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol.

More specifically, the Ig domains 1 and 2 (D1 and D2) of FcγRI were solved by Bables, which picked the structure of human high affinity IgE receptor (PDB ID 1F2Q) as the best search model. Then with the D1 and D2 domains fixed in position, the D3 domain of FcγRI was solved by Phaser using the D2 domain of FcγRIIA (PDB ID 3D5O) as the search model. Model building and refinement were carried out using Coot (24Emsley P. Lohkamp B. Scott W.G. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D. Biol.

Carbohydrate molecules were added manually using (2Fo − Fc) electron density maps contoured at 1.0σ (standard deviation of the map) and refined. The residues are numbered consistent with FCGR1_HUMAN in the Swiss-Prot entry.

Open table in a new tab The recombinant FcγRIII with mutated FG loop in the D2 domain were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. Briefly, the FG loop (171LVGSKNV177) of FcγRIII that was previously cloned in pET28b vector was replaced with that of FcγRI (171MGKHRY176) or containing an additional valine insertion at residue 172 (171MVGKHRY177) using a QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent) according to the manufacture's instruction. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing (ACGT Inc.). The wild type and the mutated FcγRIII proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (30Zhang Y. Boesen C.C. Radaev S. Brooks A.G. Fridman W.H. Sautes-Fridman C. Sun P.D. Immunity. 2000; 13: 387-395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance measurements were performed using a BIAcore 3000 instrument and analyzed with BIAevaluation 4.1 software (Biacore AB). Different human IgG subclasses were obtained from Athens Research and Technology (Athens, GA). The sialylated and asialylated Fc samples were gifts from Dr. Jeffrey Ravetch (Rockefeller University). To measure the affinity to different subclasses of human IgGs, FcγRI was immobilized on carboxylated dextran CM5 chips (Biacore AB) to 200–500 response units using a primary amine-coupling in 10 mm sodium acetate (pH 4.0). The analytes consisted of serial dilutions of IgG subclasses or sialylated Fc between 3.72 μm and 29 nm in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and 0.15 m NaCl. To measure the binding to FcγRIII wild type and mutant proteins, human IgG1 was immobilized on CM5 chip to 20–150 response units as described above. The analytes consisted of serial dilutions of FcγRI and FcγRIII wild type and mutant proteins between 7.89 and 0.03 μm in a buffer containing 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) and 0.15 m NaCl plus 0.01% P20 (Biacore AB). The dissociation constants were obtained by kinetic curve-fitting for the binding of FcγRI to IgGs and steady-state fitting for the binding of FcγRIII and its mutants to IgG1, respectively, using BIAevaluation 4.1 (BIAcore Inc.). The crystal structure of the extracellular domain of FcγRI was determined to 2.65 Å by molecular replacement (Table 1). Carbohydrates were observed and modeled at six glycosylation sites, including asparagine residues 59, 78, 152, 159, 163, and 195 (Fig. 1A). FcγRI is the only Fc receptor that contains three Ig domains, and the overall shape of FcγRI resembles the shape of a sea horse, with the interdomain hinge angles calculated to be 35° between the D1 and D2 and 120° between the D2 and D3 domains. All three domains display a C2-set Ig fold consisting of two antiparallel sheets formed by strands ABE and CFG. The pairwise structural superimposition between the three Ig domains resulted in root mean square deviations of ∼1.7 Å. The structures of the low affinity FcγRII and FcγRIII can be well superimposed onto each other with root mean square deviations of 0.9–1.1 Å (30Zhang Y. Boesen C.C. Radaev S. Brooks A.G. Fridman W.H.

The hinge angles between the D1 and D2 domains of low affinity FcγRs are remarkably similar, ranging from 55° to 60°. FcγRI, in contrast, displays a smaller D1-D2 domain hinge angle of 35° than those of FcγRII and FcγRIII but similar to the 39° hinge angle of FcϵRI (Fig. 2A) (34Garman S.C. Kinet J.P. Jardetzky T.S. Cell. 1998; 95: 951-961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This hinge angle is stabilized by extensive interactions between the D1 and D2 domains, including two interdomain salt bridges, three hydrogen bonds, and numerous hydrophobic interactions (Fig. 1B and Table 2). Some of the FcγRI hinge core residues, such as Phe-34, Glu-37, and Leu-106 in the D1-D2 hinge region are conserved with FcϵRI but not with FcγRII or RIII (Fig. 2B), further supporting their structural similarity. The hinge core in FcγRII and III, in contrast, contains one salt bridge and one hydrogen bond. Except for three conservative amino acid changes, Val-33 to Ile, Glu-99 to Gln, and Val-109 to Ala, the rest of the 15 residues in the D1-D2 hinge core are invariant between human and murine FcγRI (Fig. 2B). The D2-D3 hinge is unique to the three domains of FcγRI. It consists of one salt bridge between Glu-116 from the D2 domain and Lys-271 of the D3 domain and four hydrogen bonds involving Gly-117, Lys-157, Glu-187, and Leu-188 from the D2 domain and Lys-271 and Asn-268 from the D3 domain (Fig. 1C). Except for a conservative Asn-268 to Ser replacement, the other six residues involved in the D2-D3 hinge core are invariant between human and murine FcγRI. Despite fewer interdomain contacts and the appendage nature of the D3 domain, the entire domain has well defined electron densities and does not appear to exist in multiple conformations in the crystal. A plot of the crystallographic B-values for all Cα atoms of FcγRI shows similar thermomobility indices for the D2 and D3 domains (supplemental Fig. S1), further supporting a non-flexible conformation for the D3 domain of the receptor. The overall conservation in both the D1-D2 and the D2-D3 hinge cores between human and murine FcγRI suggests that the murine FcγRI adopts a similar structure to that of the human FcγRI.TABLE 2Hydrogen bonds and salt bridges at D1-D2 or D2-D3 interfaceD1-D2 interfaceD1D2DistanceaHydrogen bond distance cutoff is <3.5 Å.FcγRIFcϵRIFcγRIIIÅTrp- 30 NE1Arg-123 NH12.82.8Val-31 NVal-109 O3.0Val-31 OArg-112 NH23.13.3Ser-32 OGln-108 NE22.93.03.5Glu-37 OE1His-125 NE22.82.82.8Glu-99 OE1Arg-112 NH13.4D2-D3 interfaceD2D3DistanceaHydrogen bond distance cutoff is <3.5 Å.FcγRIFcϵRIFcγRIIIÅGlu-116 OE1Leu-188 N2.8Glu-116 OE2Lys-271 NZ3.2Gly-117 OAsn-268 ND23.4Lys-157 NZAsn-268 OD13.5Glu-187 OE2Lys-271 NZ3.2a Hydrogen bond distance cutoff is <3.5 Å. Open table in a new tab Previous mutational studies suggested the importance of the receptor D2 and D3 domains to the high affinity IgG binding (35Hulett M.D. Osman N. McKenzie I.F. Hogarth P.M. J.

The structures of FcγRIII and FcϵRI in complex with their Fc showed a similar ligand binding mode involving the receptor BC, C′E, FG loops, and the C′ strand on the D2 domain despite the differences in their structures and binding affinities (11Radaev S. Motyka S. Fridman W.H. Sautes-Fridman C. Sun P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16469-16477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 12Sondermann P. Huber R. Oosthuizen V.

Nature. 2000; 406: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Several of the Fc contacting residues of FcγRIII and FcϵRI, including Trp-104 and Trp-127 that form a sandwich around Pro-329 of Fc, are conserved in the high affinity FcγRI structure (Fig. 2, supplemental Fig. S2), arguing a similar Fc recognition mode for FcγRI. When the structure of FcγRI is superimposed onto that of the FcγRIII-Fc complex, its D3 domain is positioned ∼30 Å away from the putative IgG-Fc interface, suggesting that the D3 domain of FcγRI is unlikely to contact directly with IgG-Fc (Fig. 3A). However, the D3 domain of FcγRI may indirectly affect IgG binding through either stabilizing the conformation of the receptor or making the receptor protruding more into the extracellular space than its two-domain Fc receptor counterparts and, thus, more available for ligand binding. Although FcγRIII and FcϵRI recognize Fc in similar binding modes, the structures of their ligand complexes show a slightly more buried interface area in FcϵRI/IgE-Fc (1883 Å2) than in FcγRIII/IgG-Fc (1798 Å2) (11Radaev S. Motyka S. Fridman W.H. Sautes-Fridman C. Sun P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16469-16477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 37Garman S.C. Wurzburg B.A. Tarchevskaya S.S. Kinet J.P. Jardetzky T.S. Nature. 2000; 406: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). It remains to be seen if FcγRI makes more extensive IgG contacts than the low affinity FcγRs. The known structures also showed that the D2 domain FG-loop on both FcϵRI and FcγRIII formed critical interface contacts with Fc, and the exchange of the D2 domain FG-loop of FcϵRI to FcγRII confers detectable IgE binding (38Hulett M.D. McKenzie I.F. Hogarth P.M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 640-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the D2 domain FG-loop of FcγRI (171MGKHRY176) contains a single-residue deletion compared with FcγRII/FcγRIII and FcϵRI (Fig. 2B). This deletion is not present on the D1 domain FG-loop of FcγRI and is conserved in all species from human to mouse, indicating a potential functional relevance of this unique shorter FG-loop in FcγRI binding to IgG. Simple structural modeling to replace the longer FG-loop residues of FcγRIII (LVGSKNV) with those of corresponding FcγRI in the FcγRIII/IgG1-Fc structure showed that instead of making more potential contacts with IgG-Fc, the bulkier FcγRI residues were in steric clash with IgG1-Fc. Similarly, when the structure of FcϵRI was superimposed onto that of FcγRIII-Fc complex, it revealed a steric clash between the bulkier FcϵRI FG-loop residues and IgG-Fc (Fig. 3B), suggesting a potential conformational conflict between IgG-Fc and the longer FG-loop of FcϵRI. Indeed, structural overlay showed an ∼3 Å displacement in the position of the shorter FcγRI FG-loop relative to that of FcγRIII (Fig. 3B). To further investigate the contribution of the FcγRI FG-loop and its one-residue deletion to the receptor-IgG binding affinity, we mutationally replaced the FG-loop of FcγRIII (171LVGSKNV177) with both the wild type FcγRI loop (171MGKHRY176) and a mutant FcγRI loop, which contains a FcγRIII-like valine insertion at residue 172 (171MVGKHRY177). The wild type FcγRI and FcγRIII bound to immobilized IgG1 with affinities of 0.02 and 1.5 μm, respectively (Table 3, supplemental Fig. S3A). When the recombinant mutant FcγRIII carrying a shorter, wild type FcγRI FG-loop (171MGKHRY176) was examined for IgG1 binding, it resulted in an affinity of 0.1 μm, 5-fold lower than that of wild type FcγRI but 15-fold higher than that of the wild type FcγRIII (Table 3, supplemental Fig. S3A). Thus, a simple transplant of the FcγRI FG-loop to FcγRIII dramatically increased the receptor binding affinity to IgG1, illustrating the importance of the FG-loop in high affinity antibody binding. The gain in IgG1 binding affinity from swapping the FG-loop is particularly significant as the loop contains only 4 of14 potential receptor-IgG interface residues, most of which are different between FcγRI and FcγRIII. In contrast, the mutant FcγRIII with a valine inserted in the FcγRI FG-loop (171MVGKHRY177) showed a dissociation constant of 0.9 μm for IgG1 binding, similar to that of the wild type FcγRIII despite having all FcγRI residues in the FG-loop (Table 3, supplemental Fig. S3A). The 9-fold affinity difference between the two FG-loop mutations, (171MVGKHRY177) and (171MGKHRY176), suggests that the shorter FG-loop is important for the high affinity IgG binding of FcγRI.TABLE 3Solution binding dissociation constants KD (μm) between FcγR and IgGImmobilizationIgG1FcγRIAnalytesAffinityAnalytesAffinityμmμmFcγRI0.02 ± 0.009IgG10.0 4 ± 0.02FcγRIII mutant-1 (171MGKHRY176)0.11 ± 0.01IgG22.2 ± 0.3IgG30.014 ± 0.008FcγRIII mutant-2 (171MVGKHRY177)0.9 ± 0.2IgG40.032 ± 0.018IgG1-Fc0.04 ± 0.014FcγRIII (171LVGSKNV177)1.5 ± 0.2SA-IgG1-Fc0.083 ± 0.006 Open table in a new tab Both the high and low affinity Fc receptors discriminate among the four subtypes of IgGs (7Hulett M.D. Hogarth P.M.

Blood. 2009; 113: 3716-3725Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). In general, FcγRI displays 15–40 nm affinity bindings to IgG1, IgG3, and IgG4 but no detectable binding to IgG2 (IgG1,3 ∼ IgG4 ≫ IgG2) (41Bruhns P. Iannascoli B. England P. Mancardi D.A. Fernandez N. Jorieux S. Daëron M. Blood. 2009; 113: 3716-3725Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Although the high affinity FcγRI discriminates primarily against IgG2, the low affinity FcγRIII receptors discriminate against both IgG2 and IgG4 (IgG1,3 > IgG2,4). The lower affinity binding of FcγRIII to IgG2 has been attributed to the presence of a deletion in its lower hinge relative to IgG1 (11Radaev S. Motyka S. Fridman W.H. Sautes-Fridman C. Sun P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16469-16477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 12Sondermann P. Huber R. Oosthuizen V. Jacob U.

U.S.A. 1991; 88: 9036-9040Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This, however, does not explain the specificity of FcγRI, which binds IgG4 but not IgG2 in similar affinity as IgG1 (Table 3, supplemental Fig. S3B). The current structure of FcγRI and its modeled complex with Fc provide a possible explanation to this isotype-dependent IgG4 binding specificity (supplemental Fig. S2). This isotype specificity difference between FcγRI and FcγRIII may be attributed, based on the modeling of FcγRI-IgG interactions, to a hydrogen bond between Tyr-176 in the FG-loop of FcγRI but not Val in FcγRIII and the conserved lower hinge residues of IgG1,3 and IgG4 but not IgG2. On both chains of Fc, ordered carbohydrate moieties are attached to one single conserved glycosylation site, Asn-297. Unlike most glycosylations, these carbohydrates on Fc are extensively interacting with the inner face of the CH2 domain to provide conformational stability for the Fc region (11Radaev S. Motyka S. Fridman W.H. Sautes-Fridman C. Sun P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16469-16477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 12Sondermann P. Huber R. Oosthuizen V. Jacob U. Nature. 2000; 406: 267-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Indeed, removal of these carbohydrates by enzymatic digestion dramatically decreased the binding affinity of IgGs to their receptors (43Radaev S. Sun P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16478-16483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Structural studies have shown that deglycosylated Fc undergoes remarkable conformational changes in the CH2 domain, although CH3 domains are intact (44Feige M.J. Nath S. Catharino S.R. Weinfurtner D. Steinbacher S. Buchner J. J. Mol. Biol. 2009; 391: 599-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Even though these carbohydrate moieties are away from the receptor contact area, they are known to affect Fc receptor binding. Recently, sialylated Fc was proposed to harbor the anti-inflammatory activity of intravenous immunoglobulins as sialic acid-enriched IgG showed a 10-fold affinity reduction in binding to the low affinity FcγRIIB and FcγRIII (45Kaneko Y. Nimmerjahn F. Ravetch J.V. Science. 2006; 313: 670-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1340) Google Scholar). To investigate whether sialylation also affects the binding of Fc to FcγRI, we measured the receptor binding to a sialic acid-enriched Fc fragment using surface plasmon resonance analysis (Table 3, supplemental Fig. S3C). The result showed that FcγRI bound to the sialylated Fc with a modest 2-fold reduction in affinity (83 nm) compared with native Fc (42 nm). It remains to be seen whether the reduced binding affinity of FcγRI to sialylated Fc has any physiological relevance in the immunosuppressive activity of intravenous immunoglobulins. We thank Dr. Jeffrey Ravetch for providing the sialylated and asialylated recombinant Fc fragments and Katherine Lewis and Kenneth Lewis for providing the recombinant FcγRI.

https://openalex.org/W2167241670,"Whereas the conventional tissue engineering strategy involves the use of scaffolds combined with appropriate cell types to restore normal functions, the concept of in situ tissue regeneration uses host responses to a target-specific scaffold to mobilize host cells to a site of injury without the need for cell seeding. For this purpose, local delivery of bioactive molecules from scaffolds has been generally used. However, this approach has limited stem cell recruitment into the implants. Thus, we developed a combination of systemic delivery of substance P (SP) and local release of stromal-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) from an implant. In this study, we examined whether this combined system would significantly enhance recruitment of host stem cells into the implants. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry for CD29/CD45, CD146/α-smooth muscle actin, and c-kit demonstrated that this system significantly increased the number of stem cell-like cells within the implants when compared with other systems. In vitro culture of the cells that had infiltrated into the scaffolds from the combined system confirmed that host stem cells were recruited into these implants and indicated that they were capable of differentiation into multiple lineages. These results indicate that this combined system may lead to more efficient tissue regeneration.—Ko, I. K., Ju, Y. M., Chen, T., Atala, A., Yoo, J. J., Lee, S.J.

https://openalex.org/W2165377952,"Identification of the signaling pathways that regulate cyclic nucleotide microdomains is essential to our understanding of cardiac physiology and pathophysiology. Although there is growing evidence that the plasma membrane Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent ATPase 4 (PMCA4) is a regulator of neuronal nitric-oxide synthase, the physiological consequence of this regulation is unclear. We therefore tested the hypothesis that PMCA4 has a key structural role in tethering neuronal nitric-oxide synthase to a highly compartmentalized domain in the cardiac cell membrane. This structural role has functional consequences on cAMP and cGMP signaling in a PMCA4-governed microdomain, which ultimately regulates cardiac contractility. In vivo contractility and calcium amplitude were increased in PMCA4 knock-out animals (PMCA4(-/-)) with no change in diastolic relaxation or the rate of calcium decay, showing that PMCA4 has a function distinct from beat-to-beat calcium transport. Surprisingly, in PMCA4(-/-), over 36% of membrane-associated neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) protein and activity was delocalized to the cytosol with no change in total nNOS protein, resulting in a significant decrease in microdomain cGMP, which in turn led to a significant elevation in local cAMP levels through a decrease in PDE2 activity (measured by FRET-based sensors). This resulted in increased L-type calcium channel activity and ryanodine receptor phosphorylation and hence increased contractility. In the heart, in addition to subsarcolemmal calcium transport, PMCA4 acts as a structural molecule that maintains the spatial and functional integrity of the nNOS signaling complex in a defined microdomain. This has profound consequences for the regulation of local cyclic nucleotide and hence cardiac β-adrenergic signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2033046194,"Two genes on chromosome 21, namely dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (Dyrk1A) and regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1), have been implicated in some of the phenotypic characteristics of Down syndrome, including the early onset of Alzheimer disease. Although a link between Dyrk1A and RCAN1 and the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) pathway has been reported, it remains unclear whether Dyrk1A directly interacts with RCAN1. In the present study, Dyrk1A is shown to directly interact with and phosphorylate RCAN1 at Ser112 and Thr192 residues. Dyrk1A-mediated phosphorylation of RCAN1 at Ser112 primes the protein for the GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of Ser108. Phosphorylation of RCAN1 at Thr192 by Dyrk1A enhances the ability of RCAN1 to inhibit the phosphatase activity of calcineurin (Caln), leading to reduced NFAT transcriptional activity and enhanced Tau phosphorylation. These effects are mediated by the enhanced binding of RCAN1 to Caln and its extended half-life caused by Dyrk1A-mediated phosphorylation. Furthermore, an increased expression of phospho-Thr192-RCAN1 was observed in the brains of transgenic mice overexpressing the Dyrk1A protein. These results suggest a direct link between Dyrk1A and RCAN1 in the Caln-NFAT signaling and Tau hyperphosphorylation pathways, supporting the notion that the synergistic interaction between the chromosome 21 genes RCAN1 and Dyrk1A is associated with a variety of pathological features associated with DS.

The genes that encode dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (Dyrk1A) and regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1) are both located on chromosome 21 and might be responsible for certain clinical features of DS, such as mental retardation and early onset Alzheimer disease (AD). Dyrk1A is a dual specificity protein kinase that is activated by autophosphorylation on a tyrosine residue in the activation loop, and it phosphorylates serine or threonine residues in substrate proteins (1Becker W. Sippl W. FEBS J. 2011; 278: 246-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Dyrk1A is a multifunctional protein kinase with various substrates, such as transcription factors, splicing factors, and synapse-associated proteins (2Park J. Oh Y. Chung K.C.

Dyrk1A contains a nuclear localization sequence at its N terminus and locates both to the cytosol and nucleus, phosphorylating nuclear and cytoplasmic substrate proteins. Dyrk1A also functions as a priming kinase for GSK3β phosphorylation of proteins such as Tau and NFAT (4Woods Y.L. Cohen P. Becker W. Jakes R. Goedert M. Wang X. Proud C.G. Biochem.

RCAN1, formerly known as Down syndrome critical region 1 (DSCR1), acts as an endogenous regulator of calcineurin (Caln), a ubiquitous and multifunctional calcium-activated serine/threonine protein phosphatase. Its overexpression either in animal models or in cells results in the inhibition of signaling pathways that are controlled by the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factor (19Davies K.J.

RCAN1 has therefore been proposed as a candidate protein responsible for mental retardation in DS. RCAN1 has also been implicated in oxidative stress and exocytosis (23Porta S. Serra S.A. Huch M.

Increased expression of certain genes on chromosome 21, alone or in cooperation, is thought to be responsible for the DS phenotype, including mental retardation, congenital heart defects, gastrointestinal malformations, immune and endocrine system defects, and early onset of dementia of the Alzheimer type. Increased expression of RCAN1 and Dyrk1A in individuals with DS destabilizes the NFAT genetic circuit (25Arron J.R. Winslow M.M. Polleri A. Chang C.P. Wu H. Gao X. Neilson J.R. Chen L. Heit J.J.

The present study investigated the possible direct link between Dyrk1A and RCAN1 and examined the effect of Dyrk1A-mediated phosphorylation on RCAN1 activity in relation to the pathological traits of DS. Mouse wild-type and Y321F kinase-inactive mutant Dyrk1A proteins with endogenous 13-histidine repeats were purified with Ni2+-NTA resin as described previously (10Ryoo S.R. Cho H.J. Lee H.W. Jeong H.K. Radnaabazar C. Kim Y.S. Kim M.J. Son M.Y. Seo H. Chung S.H. Song W.J. J. Neurochem. 2008; 104: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Full-length human RCAN1-1S (RCAN1) and human Caln A cDNAs were cloned into pET29b and pET28b, respectively. The full-length human RCAN1 and an RCAN1 C-terminal (RCAN1Ct) cDNA corresponding to exon 7 were cloned into pGEX4T-3. The recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strain RIL (Stratagene) and purified using Ni2+-NTA or glutathione-Sepharose 4B resin. Anti-α-tubulin and HA antibodies were from Sigma. The anti-Caln antibody was from R&D Systems. The anti-Dyrk1A antibody was custom-made as described previously (16Ahn K.J. Jeong H.K. Choi H.S. Ryoo S.R. Kim Y.J. Goo J.S. Choi S.Y. Han J.S. Ha I. Song W.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 2006; 22: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). The anti-RCAN1 antibodies were either from Abnova or custom-made using synthetic peptides, RPEYTPIHLS. A phosphospecific RCAN1 antibody to a synthetic phosphopeptide (188RPEYpTPIHLS197) was generated and affinity-purified first with a cognate nonphosphopeptide (RPEYTPIHLS) affinity column and then with a phosphopeptide column (Peptron, Inc., Daejeon, South Korea). The full-length wild-type and Y321F kinase-inactive Dyrk1A mutant cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA3.1 as described previously (10Ryoo S.R. Cho H.J. Lee H.W. Jeong H.K. Radnaabazar C. Kim Y.S. Kim M.J. Son M.Y. Seo H. Chung S.H. Song W.J. J. Neurochem. 2008; 104: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The full-length human wild-type RCAN1-1S (RCAN1) and Caln A cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen). Phosphorylation-defective mutants of RCAN1 cDNA were generated by DpnI-mediated site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene), and the clones were verified by sequencing. For the siRNA experiment, the Dyrk1A-specific siRNA (5′-AUGGAGCUAUGGACGUUAA) with the TT overhang was designed and synthesized by Samchully Pharm Co. Ltd. (Seoul, South Korea). For siRNA delivery, Dyrk1A-specific duplex siRNA (100 pmol for a 6-well plate) was transfected into PC12 cells (7.5 × 105 cells/well) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Dyrk1A siRNA (5′-GUACAUCGUCAAGCUCAGGU) was used as an ineffective siRNA control. After 48–72 h of siRNA treatment, cell lysates were prepared for immunoblot analyses. HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmids using the calcium phosphate precipitation method. One day later, the cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholic acid) containing 1 mm PMSF, a phosphatase inhibitor mixture, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Calbiochem) and subjected to Western blot analysis. For analysis by autoradiography, purified RCAN1 wild-type (WT) or mutant protein (100 ng) was incubated with recombinant full-length Dyrk1A protein (1 μg) for 1 h at 37 °C in kinase buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 20 μm sodium orthovanadate) containing 25 μm cold ATP and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction mixtures were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and radioactive bands were detected with the Typhoon 9200 imaging system (Amersham Biosciences). The ability of Dyrk1A to prime RCAN1 WT or mutant proteins for GSK3β phosphorylation was examined by prephosphorylating GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads with 720 ng of Dyrk1A in the presence and absence of 1 mm non-radioactive ATP overnight at 30°C. After the non-radioactive priming step, the bead-bound GST fusion proteins were washed extensively to remove recombinant kinase and ATP. Phosphorylated GST fusion proteins were then incubated with 20 ng of GSK3β (Millipore) in a 25-μl final volume of the kinase buffer in the presence of 25 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 40 min at 37 °C and analyzed as described above. HEK293T cells were harvested 24 h after transient transfection with the indicated plasmids. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer with 1 mm PMSF and a protease inhibitor mixture. Transgenic mice overexpressing the human Dyrk1A gene, which was carried on a bacterial artificial chromosome, were generated and maintained as described previously (16Ahn K.J. Jeong H.K. Choi H.S. Ryoo S.R. Kim Y.J. Goo J.S. Choi S.Y. Han J.S. Ha I. Song W.J. Neurobiol. Dis. 2006; 22: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Experiments were performed in accordance with guidelines set forth by the Inje University Council directive for the proper care and use of laboratory animals. Mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Brains were dissected, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and Dounce-homogenized in RIPA buffer containing 1 mm PMSF, a protease inhibitor mixture, and 0.5 mm sodium orthovanadate. Protein concentration was determined using the BCA method (Sigma). Typically, 25–50 μg of the brain lysates was used for Western blotting. Densitometric quantification was carried out using ImageJ 1.42 software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). For co-immunoprecipitation, brain lysates (2–6 mg) from the Dyrk1A TG mice or HEK293T cell lysates (500 μg) transfected with the indicated plasmids were incubated with control IgG (R&D Systems), anti-RCAN1, or anti-Dyrk1A antibodies overnight at 4 °C in RIPA buffer with protease inhibitors and 1 mm PMSF. The next day, after 1 h of incubation with protein A beads (Pierce), the bead mixture was gently washed with 1% Triton X-100 in RIPA buffer, and the bound proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies. For the GST pull-down assay, purified GST-RCAN1 WT or the phosphorylation-defective mutants were incubated with recombinant Dyrk1A protein (1 μg) or HEK293T cell lysates (500 μg) transfected with the plasmid encoding Caln for 1 h at 4 °C in binding buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm PMSF). The beads were then washed with 300 mm NaCl-containing binding buffer three times, and the bound proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis with the indicated antibodies. PC12 cells were plated onto polyethyleneimine-coated coverslips, treated with nerve growth factor (NGF) for 6 days, and then fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). For primary embryonic rat cortical cultures, embryonic day 17 pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased from Orient Bio Inc. (Seongnam-si, South Korea). The cortices of the embryos were dissected and cultured as described previously (30Kaech S. Banker G. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2406-2415Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar, 31Zeitelhofer M. Vessey J.P. Xie Y. Tübing F. Thomas S. Kiebler M. Dahm R. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1692-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Primary cortical cultures were plated onto poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips and grown in neurobasal growth medium for 5 days before fixing with 4% formaldehyde in PBS. The fixed cells were subsequently permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 and blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and then incubated for 2 h at room temperature with primary antibodies (rabbit anti-Dyrk1A antibody (1:50), mouse anti-RCAN1 antibody (1:50), or rabbit phosphospecific RCAN1 antibody (1:2,000)). The cells were then incubated with secondary antibodies (Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies at a 1:500 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature, washed with PBS, and examined using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BX61) or a confocal laser scan microscope (LSM 510 META, Carl Zeiss). The activity of Caln was determined using p-nitrophenyl phosphate as described previously (32Sagoo J.K. Fruman D.A. Wesselborg S. Walsh C.T. Bierer B.E. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Phosphatase assays using 60 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate (Sigma) were performed using 10 μg of purified recombinant Caln with and without purified recombinant RCAN1 WT or the phosphorylation-defective mutants (0.8 or 1.6 μg) and 200 nm calmodulin (CaM; Calbiochem) in assay buffer (100 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 100 μg/ml BSA, 1 mm MnCl2, 0.4 mm CaCl2). In each assay, blank tubes containing buffer only were prepared to determine background levels of hydrolyzed p-nitrophenyl phosphate. Control tubes contained buffer and Caln/CaM. After 5 min of incubation at 30 °C, the reactions were initiated by the addition of 60 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate. The tubes were incubated for an additional 60–90 min at 30 °C, and the liberation of p-nitrophenol was measured at 405 nm using a TECAN Infinite 200 plate reader. For luciferase experiments, HEK293T cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected with 0.5 ng of pCMV-RL reporter (Renilla luciferase, internal standard), 200 ng of pGL3-Basic reporter (NFAT-luciferase, AP-1 promoter), and 50 ng of expression plasmids encoding empty vector, RCAN1 WT, or the phosphorylation-defective mutants. The total amount of plasmid was kept constant for all groups. After transfection, cells were treated with ionomycin (2.5 μm) for 48 h and analyzed for reporter gene activity using the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay (Promega) as recommended by the manufacturer. NFAT luciferase values were normalized to Renilla luciferase values. To determine whether RCAN1 interacts with Dyrk1A, co-immunoprecipitation assays were carried out in HEK293T cells transfected with expression vectors encoding RCAN1 and Dyrk1A. RCAN1 co-immunoprecipitated with Dyrk1A, indicating that Dyrk1A interacts with RCAN1 (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, reverse co-immunoprecipitation experiments with the anti-RCAN1 antibody also revealed an interaction between Dyrk1A and RCAN1, as shown in Fig. 1A. To further determine whether endogenous RCAN1 and Dyrk1A interact in mammalian neurons, the brain lysates of Dyrk1A TG mice were immunoprecipitated with the anti-Dyrk1A or RCAN1 antibodies. RCAN1 associates with Dyrk1A in brain lysates (Fig. 1B). The direct interaction between purified Dyrk1A protein and GST-RCAN1 was further examined using a GST pull-down assay, which showed that GST-RCAN1 but not GST alone was able to bind directly to Dyrk1A as shown in Fig. 1C. To determine whether Dyrk1A can phosphorylate RCAN1 in vitro, purified RCAN1 was incubated with recombinant Dyrk1A WT or inactive Dyrk1A Y321F mutant in a kinase assay buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP. A band that migrated to a position corresponding to the molecular size of RCAN1 was detected by autoradiography only when both Dyrk1A WT and RCAN1 were present in the reaction mixture (Fig. 2A), indicating that RCAN1 was phosphorylated by active Dyrk1A. In vitro kinase assays in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP were also performed with the RCAN1-Dyrk1A immunocomplexes from HEK293T cells expressing RCAN1 and Dyrk1A. As shown in supplemental Fig. S1, phosphorylation of RCAN1 was detected in the RCAN1-Dyrk1A immunocomplex but not in control immunocomplex kinase assays. These data support the conclusion that Dyrk1A phosphorylates RCAN1. An examination of the amino acid sequence of RCAN1 revealed the presence of five potential Dyrk1A phosphorylation sites at Ser108, Ser112, Thr124, Thr153, and Thr192, each of which is followed by a proline residue conserved in human, rat, and mouse sequences. To identify the specific RCAN1 residues phosphorylated by Dyrk1A, each potential RCAN1 phosphorylation site was replaced with alanine, resulting in S108A, S112A, T124A, T153A, T192A, and the double mutant S112A/T192A. Purified RCAN1 wild type and mutants were incubated with recombinant Dyrk1A in a kinase assay buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP. This analysis revealed that mutation of serine 112 and threonine 192 to alanine strongly reduced the phosphorylation level of RCAN1. The S112A/T192A double mutation reduced the phosphorylation even further, whereas mutations at positions 108, 124, or 153 had little effect on Dyrk1A-dependent phosphorylation (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2C, the amounts of RCAN1 WT and mutants used in the kinase assay were similar. These results suggest that Dyrk1A selectively phosphorylates RCAN1 at Ser112 and Thr192 residues. Previous work showed that mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylates RCAN1 at serine 112 to prime it for subsequent phosphorylation at serine 108 by GSK3β (33Vega R.B. Yang J. Rothermel B.A. Bassel-Duby R. Williams R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30401-30407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Dyrk1A occasionally plays a role as a GSK3β-priming kinase by phosphorylating the serine or threonine residue in target substrates located 4 amino acids downstream from the C terminus of another GSK3β-phosphorylated serine or threonine (4Woods Y.L. Cohen P. Becker W. Jakes R. Goedert M. Wang X. Proud C.G. Biochem. J. 2001; 355: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Therefore, we anticipated that phosphorylation of Ser112 by Dyrk1A would prime for the phosphorylation of Ser108 by GSK3β. To investigate whether Dyrk1A could prime GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of RCAN1, wild-type GST-RCAN1 protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was prephosphorylated in the presence or absence of recombinant Dyrk1A. After the non-radioactive priming step, the bead-bound GST fusion proteins were washed extensively to remove recombinant Dyrk1A. Phosphorylated GST fusion proteins were then incubated with and without GSK3β in a kinase assay buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP. Fig. 3A shows that RCAN1 prephosphorylated by Dyrk1A was strongly phosphorylated by GSK3β, although GSK3β and residual Dyrk1A alone slightly phosphorylated RCAN1. We performed GSK3β mutation analysis to determine if Dyrk1A primes for phosphorylation at Ser108 of RCAN1. GST-RCAN1 proteins, either wild-type or mutant forms (S108A, S112A, or T192A), bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads were first phosphorylated using recombinant Dyrk1A in the presence or absence of non-radioactive ATP. Phosphorylated GST fusion proteins were then incubated with GSK3β in a kinase assay buffer containing [γ-32P]ATP. As shown in Fig. 3B, Dyrk1A can prime wild-type RCAN1 for subsequent phosphorylation by GSK3β only in the presence of ATP. RCAN1 phosphorylation by GSK3β did not occur with proteins carrying mutations at S108A and S112A, which are the sites of GSK3β and Dyrk1A phosphorylation, respectively. In the priming experiment with the T192A mutant, the Dyrk1A-prephosphorylated RCAN1 was as strongly phosphorylated by GSK3β as was the wild-type RCAN1, excluding the possibility of non-canonical GSK3 priming (the priming kinase phosphorylates a residue required for GSK3β phosphorylation not at the +4-position), which has been shown for mammalian Dyrk1A kinase on NFAT (5Gwack Y.

Biol. 2005; 288: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These results suggest that Dyrk1A-mediated phosphorylation of Ser112 primes RCAN1 for subsequent phosphorylation by GSK3β at Ser108 in vitro, supporting a role for Dyrk1A as a priming kinase for GSK3β. The effect of Dyrk1A-mediated phosphorylation of RCAN1 on the activity of RCAN1 as an inhibitor of Caln was examined. Prior to performing the Caln activity assay, purified GST-RCAN1 bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was incubated with and without Dyrk1A in the presence and absence of 10 mm non-radioactive ATP for 90 min at 30°C, and the bead-bound GST-RCAN1 was washed extensively to remove recombinant kinase and ATP. As shown in Fig. 4A, RCAN1 phosphorylated by Dyrk1A inhibited Caln activity by 59%, whereas nonphosphorylated RCAN1 without ATP and without Dyrk1A inhibited Caln activity by 52 and 53%, respectively. In five independent experiments, the phosphorylation of RCAN1 enhanced its ability to inhibit Caln phosphatase activity by 27 ± 6% relative to that of nonphosphorylated RCAN1 without ATP (p < 0.05) and by 14 ± 3% relative to that of nonphosphorylated RCAN1 without Dyrk1A (p < 0.05) (Fig. 4A, right), suggesting that Dyrk1A-mediated phosphorylation of RCAN1 enhances its ability to inhibit Caln. The effect of Ser112 and Thr192 phosphorylation on RCAN1 inhibition of Caln was assessed using RCAN1 WT and the S112A and T192A mutants. We first performed RCAN1 dosage-dependent Caln assays and found that RCAN1 inhibits Caln activity in a dose-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. S2A). We used 0.8 or 1.6 μg of RCAN1 WT and the phosphorylation-defective mutants in Fig. 4B with similar results at both concentrations. Both RCAN1 WT and RCAN1(S112A) inhibited Caln activity by 55%, whereas RCAN1(T192A) inhibited Caln activity by 51% (Fig. 4B). In six independent experimen"

https://openalex.org/W2084270283,"As the neural network becomes wired, postsynaptic signaling molecules are thought to control the growth of dendrites and synapses. However, how these molecules are coordinated to sculpt postsynaptic structures is less well understood. We find that ephrin-B3, a transmembrane ligand for Eph receptors, functions postsynaptically as a receptor to transduce reverse signals into developing dendrites of mouse hippocampal neurons. Both tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent GRB4 SH2/SH3 adaptor-mediated signals and PSD-95-discs large-zona occludens-1 (PDZ) domain-dependent signals are required for inhibition of dendrite branching, whereas only PDZ interactions are necessary for spine formation and excitatory synaptic function. PICK1 and syntenin, two PDZ domain proteins, participate with ephrin-B3 in these postsynaptic activities. PICK1 has a specific role in spine and synapse formation, and syntenin promotes both dendrite pruning and synapse formation to build postsynaptic structures that are essential for neural circuits. The study thus dissects ephrin-B reverse signaling into three distinct intracellular pathways and protein-protein interactions that mediate the maturation of postsynaptic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W1973741646,"Signaling by protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR1), a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) for thrombin, is regulated by desensitization and internalization. PAR1 desensitization is mediated by β-arrestins, like most classic GPCRs. In contrast, internalization of PAR1 occurs through a clathrin- and dynamin-dependent pathway independent of β-arrestins. PAR1 displays two modes of internalization. Constitutive internalization of unactivated PAR1 is mediated by the clathrin adaptor protein complex-2 (AP-2), where the μ2-adaptin subunit binds directly to a tyrosine-based motif localized within the receptor C-tail domain. However, AP-2 depletion only partially inhibits agonist-induced internalization of PAR1, suggesting a function for other clathrin adaptors in this process. Here, we now report that AP-2 and epsin-1 are both critical mediators of agonist-stimulated PAR1 internalization. We show that ubiquitination of PAR1 and the ubiquitin-interacting motifs of epsin-1 are required for epsin-1-dependent internalization of activated PAR1. In addition, activation of PAR1 promotes epsin-1 de-ubiquitination, which may increase its endocytic adaptor activity to facilitate receptor internalization. AP-2 also regulates activated PAR1 internalization via recognition of distal C-tail phosphorylation sites rather than the canonical tyrosine-based motif. Thus, AP-2 and epsin-1 are both required to promote efficient internalization of activated PAR1 and recognize discrete receptor sorting signals. This study defines a new pathway for internalization of mammalian GPCRs."

The identification of human SWS1 (hSWS1) as the homolog of budding yeast Shu2 implicated that the Shu complex is evolutionarily conserved. However, the human counterparts of other components in this complex have not yet been identified and characterized. Here we describe the characterization of a novel human component of this complex, SWSAP1 (hSWS1-associated protein 1)/C19orf39. We show that hSWS1 and SWSAP1 form a stable complex in vivo and in vitro. hSWS1 and SWSAP1 are mutually interdependent for their stability. We further demonstrate that the purified hSWS1·SWSAP1 complex possesses single-stranded DNA-binding activity and DNA-stimulated ATPase activity. Moreover, SWSAP1 interacts with RAD51 and RAD51 paralogs, and depletion of SWSAP1 causes defects in homologous recombination repair. Thus, our results suggest that the human Shu complex (hSWS1·SWSAP1) has an evolutionarily conserved function in homologous recombination."

Phosphorylation is one of the most common modifications made to proteins. Depending on the protein substrate, it can regulate the gain or loss of activity through a variety of mechanisms. Most mechanisms studied to date appear to work via a change in steric geometry at the active site or a global conformational change in the protein (1Sprang S.R. Acharya K.R. Goldsmith E.J.

Overall, the extent of structural characterization of phosphorylation mechanisms is limited given the ubiquity of this post-translational signaling mechanism and the large diversity of effects observed upon phosphorylation. A greater understanding of how phosphorylation(s) modulates protein activity is essential for a mechanistic understanding of signal transduction. Many phosphorylated proteins are multidomain, modular proteins (2Huse M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 2002; 109: 275-282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar, 3Aghazadeh B.

Malfunction of MAGUKs is associated with central nervous system disorders (11Gardoni F. Marcello E. Di Luca M. Neuroscience. 2009; 158: 324-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The defining MAGUK signature is the PDZ-SH3-guanylate kinase “supradomain” architecture. The best known MAGUK protein is postsynaptic density-95 (PSD-95), which is found on the cytoplasmic side of postsynaptic terminals. PSD-95 is a non-catalytic scaffolding protein that clusters glutamate receptors and assembles macromolecular complexes for signal integration in the postsynapse at excitatory neurons (8Funke L. Dakoji S. Bredt D.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 219-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 12Xu W. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2011; 21: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). It consists of three PDZ domains, an SH3 domain, and a non-catalytic guanylate kinase (GK) domain (see Fig. 1A). PDZ domains are ∼90-residue, globular, protein interaction domains that have a conserved fold comprised of two α-helices and six β-strands. The function of PDZs is typically to bind the C-terminal 4–5 residues of target proteins, which bind in a groove between α2 and β2 of the PDZ. PDZ domains are often found in tandem copies and are common to proteins that function as scaffolds for assembling signaling complexes or trafficking components at cell-cell junctions. In PSD-95, the three PDZ domains bind many proteins ranging from NMDA and adrenergic receptors to neuronal nitric-oxide synthase, Pyk2, synaptic Ras GTPase activating protein, and microtubule assemblies (13Kim E. Sheng M. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2004; 5: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). Structural work has been carried out on individual PDZs of PSD-95 (14Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E.

A role for PDZs beyond their normal C-terminal ligand binding function has emerged from examples in which intermolecular (or interdomain) contacts occur on novel PDZ interfaces (18Peterson F.C.

Previous work suggests that the third PDZ domain (PDZ3) in PSD-95 family proteins regulates activity at SH3-GK, indicating that this PDZ domain may have an additional regulatory function on top of its C-terminal binding function. MAP1a binds to the GK domain of PSD-95; however, this interaction is weakened by the presence of PDZ3 (and abolished by the presence of all three PDZ domains) and restored by PDZ-binding peptides such as adenomatous polyposis coli, NR2B, and cysteine-rich PDZ-binding protein (24Brenman J.E. Topinka J.R. Cooper E.C. McGee A.W. Rosen J. Milroy T. Ralston H.J. Bredt D.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8805-8813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interdomain interactions were also characterized in the Drosophila homologue of PSD-95, Dlg-1, in which the domain interaction between PDZ3 and SH3 was regulated by PDZ3-binding peptides (25Qian Y. Prehoda K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35757-35763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The region linking PDZ3 and SH3 is vital to the interdomain communication between these two domains: replacement of the conserved linker region with flexible Gly-Ser repeats disrupts the influence that PDZ3 has on the binding of SH3 to its interaction partner, GukHolder (25Qian Y. Prehoda K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35757-35763Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Thus, a major question regarding MAGUKs is what is the role of the PDZ domain preceding SH3-GK and how might it participate in intramolecular, interdomain interactions? Interestingly, PSD-95 is known to be phosphorylated at up to ∼12 sites with several of these sites occurring at linker positions in between structured domains as well as one in a C-terminal helical extension to PDZ3 (see Fig. 1A). To date, phosphorylation has received modest attention as a means of regulating PDZ domain function in general. One exception is the PDZ protein NHERF1 for which phosphorylation has been shown to regulate PDZ-mediated autoinhibition (26Li J. Poulikakos P.I. Dai Z. Testa J.R. Callaway D.J. Bu Z. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27086-27099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that folding of a C-terminal extension to PDZ3 into an α-helix (third α-helix (α3)) increases binding affinity to PDZ3 ligand via an allosteric mechanism rooted in changes in picosecond-nanosecond side-chain dynamics (21Petit C.M. Zhang J. Sapienza P.J. Fuentes E.J. Lee A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18249-18254Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The α3 helix is not part of the conserved PDZ fold and hence appeared as an unusual auxiliary element whose function had been unclear. Within the α3 helix, Tyr-397 has been shown to be phosphorylated (27Ballif B.A. Carey G.R. Sunyaev S.R. Gygi S.P. J. Proteome Res. 2008; 7: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), which in principle could either increase or decrease α3 interactions with the PDZ core. In addition to Tyr-397, the nearby residues Ser-415 and Ser-418 can also be phosphorylated (28Trinidad J.C. Specht C.G. Thalhammer A. Schoepfer R. Burlingame A.L. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2006; 5: 914-922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 29Munton R.P. Tweedie-Cullen R. Livingstone-Zatchej M. Weinandy F. Waidelich M. Longo D. Gehrig P.

This dense collection of phosphorylation sites suggests that this region (C-terminal extension of PDZ3 and the PDZ3-SH3 linker) is a hot spot for MAGUK regulation. Interestingly, structured “extensions” to PDZ domains are now being discovered in more PDZ domains (30Wang C.K. Pan L. Chen J. Zhang M. Protein Cell. 2010; 1: 737-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). To probe the role of PDZ3 in the PSD-95 MAGUK and its transition into the linker and SH3 domain, we chose to study by NMR the effect of phosphorylation at three sites in the C-terminal region of PDZ3 and how such phosphorylations modulate PDZ3 structure, function, and its interaction with SH3-GK. A construct of PDZ3 spanning residues 304–402 was phosphorylated at Tyr-397 (p397-PDZ3) and characterized for structural effects. A combination of chemical shift analysis, hydrogen exchange, 15N relaxation, and isothermal titration calorimetry showed that phosphorylation induces a fast equilibrium between a docked conformation in which α3 is packed against the PDZ core and a conformational state in which α3 is undocked that has reduced affinity for PDZ3 ligands. The latter state was previously identified via truncation of α3 and shown to alter PDZ3 ligand binding affinity through a novel allosteric mechanism driven by side-chain dynamics (21Petit C.M. Zhang J. Sapienza P.J. Fuentes E.J. Lee A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18249-18254Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The findings here support this mechanism by showing that the dynamic allostery can be triggered by a biologically relevant modification and is likely to be utilized in a cellular context. In a second construct of PSD-95 that includes PDZ3-linker-SH3, phosphorylation at all three sites (397, 415, and 418) was shown to increase the mobility of PDZ3 relative to SH3. These studies provide insight into how phosphorylation affects structure and dynamics of an intrinsically flexible, multidomain system. They also show for the first time that the association of PDZ3 with the SH3 domain in PSD-95 is weakened by multiple phosphorylations. PDZ3 (residues 304–402), Y397E-PDZ3, and PDZ3-SH3 tandem (residues 304–532) from rat PSD-95 were subcloned into the pET21a vector with a tobacco etch virus-cleavable N-terminal histidine tag. The PDZ3-SH3 tandem was stabilized by adding the sequence SGSGSGPYIWVPAREERL to its C terminus (16McGee A.W. Dakoji S.R. Olsen O. Bredt D.S. Lim W.A. Prehoda K.E. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1291-1301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) where bold residues are from residues 713 to 724, which form the F-strand of the SH3 domain. Y397E-PDZ3, PDZ3-SH3 single mutant (Y937E-PDZ3-SH3), and triple mutant (Y397E/S415E/S418E) were made by multiple site mutagenesis PCR (31An Y. Ji J. Wu W. Lv A. Huang R. Wei Y. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2005; 68: 774-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Transformed Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells were grown at 37 °C in LB medium or minimal medium containing appropriate isotopes. When cell density reached an A600 of 0.6, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 1 mm, and the cells were grown for another 16 h at 22 °C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C until use. To purify all proteins in this study, the cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, 25 mm imidazole, and 1 mm lysozyme. The resuspended cells were frozen and thawed for three cycles, and sonication was applied. The centrifuged cell lysate was loaded to a nickel affinity column and eluted with 500 mm imidazole. The fractions containing target proteins were pooled and subjected to overnight tobacco etch virus cleavage at 4 °C. A 100% cleavage was achieved as suggested by SDS-PAGE. Cleaved samples were further purified by Source Q ion exchange chromatography followed by a G50 size exclusion column equilibrated in a buffer containing 22 mm NaPO4, pH 6.8, 55 mm NaCl, and 1.1 mm EDTA. p397-PDZ3 was separated from PDZ3 using Source Q resin with a 260-ml linear gradient from 0 to 500 mm NaCl in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0 (Fig. 2A). The identity and purity of the protein were verified by mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined by UV absorbance with extinction coefficients calculated by the ProtParam tool. Phosphorylation changes the UV absorbance profile of tyrosine with an extinction coefficient of 593 m−1 cm−1 at 268 nm (32Bradshaw J.M. Waksman G. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15400-15407Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Taking the other unphosphorylated tyrosine (Tyr-392; ϵ268 = 1114 m−1 cm−1) into account, the concentration of p397-PDZ3 was determined using an extinction coefficient of 1707 m−1 cm−1 at 268 nm. PDZ3-SH3 single and triple mutants were purified using the aforementioned protocol with modification at the size exclusion chromatography step where elution buffer contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT. The plasmid encoding c-Src kinase was a gift from John Kuriyan (University of California, Berkeley) and Sharon Campbell (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill). The c-Src kinase domain was purified as described (33Seeliger M.A. Young M. Henderson M.N. Pellicena P. King D.S. Falick A.M. Kuriyan J. Protein Sci. 2005; 14: 3135-3139Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). A 7-mer CRIPT peptide (Ac-NYKQTSV-COOH) was synthesized and purified as reported (21Petit C.M. Zhang J. Sapienza P.J. Fuentes E.J. Lee A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18249-18254Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). The identity and purity of the peptide were verified by mass spectrometry. The peptide concentration was determined using UV absorbance with an extinction coefficient of 1490 m−1 cm−1. ITC experiments were carried out on a MicroCal VP-ITC microcalorimeter and repeated twice to estimate error. ITC measurements of PDZ3, p397-PDZ3, and Y397E-PDZ3 were performed by titrating 1 mm CRIPT peptide into 0.1 mm protein. In total, 280 μl of CRIPT peptide was titrated into 1.4 ml of protein solution by 40 steps with a 3-min interval between injections. The dilution effect was estimated by performing the same titration procedure without protein. Both the peptide and proteins were dissolved in the same buffer containing 20 mm NaPO4, pH 6.8, 50 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA. Data were integrated and analyzed using Origin version 5.0 (MicroCal). Kd, ΔH, ΔS, and N were fitted with a single binding site model. For PDZ3, p397-PDZ3, and Y397E-PDZ3 titrations, c values were 27.8, 7.2, and 12.6, respectively. PDZ3, p397-PDZ3, and Y397E-PDZ3 NMR samples were dissolved in 20 mm NaPO4, pH 6.8, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% D2O at a protein concentration of 1 mm. NMR assignment data were acquired on a Varian Inova 500-MHz magnet equipped with a room temperature 1H/15N/13C probe and z axis pulsed field gradients. Backbone resonance assignments for p397-PDZ3 and Y397E-PDZ3 were obtained using three-dimensional HNCACB and CBCA(CO)NH experiments (34Muhandiram D.R. Kay L.E. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1994; 103: 203-216Crossref Scopus (835) Google Scholar). For characterization of backbone dynamics of p397-PDZ3, 15N T1, T2, and {1H}-15N NOE data (supplemental Fig. S1) were collected at 500 MHz at a protein concentration of 1 mm. Data were acquired and analyzed as reported elsewhere (21Petit C.M. Zhang J. Sapienza P.J. Fuentes E.J. Lee A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18249-18254Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 35Fuentes E.J. Der C.J. Lee A.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 335: 1105-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) using in-house programs. Briefly, T1, T2, and {1H}-15N NOE data from “rigid” residues were initially fit to obtain the overall correlation time of the protein, which was determined to be 6.8 ns. As with unphosphorylated PDZ3, anisotropic models of tumbling were not required (21Petit C.M. Zhang J. Sapienza P.J. Fuentes E.J. Lee A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18249-18254Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Models were then selected for individual residues (supplemental Table S1) to fit the Lipari-Szabo dynamics parameters (S2, τe, etc.). 15N T2 relaxation data for wild-type PDZ3-SH3 and Y397E-PDZ3-SH3 and Y397E/S415E/S418E-PDZ3-SH3 mutants were acquired at a protein concentration of 0.5 mm. Data were collected as described (21Petit C.M. Zhang J. Sapienza P.J. Fuentes E.J. Lee A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18249-18254Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) on a Varian Inova 500-MHz system equipped with a 1H/15N/13C cryogenically cooled probe with z axis pulsed field gradients. Wild-type and mutant PDZ3-SH3 constructs were dissolved in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10% D2O, and 1 mm DTT. All NMR spectra were processed by NMRPipe and analyzed by NMRViewJ. Solvent-exposed amide HSQC spectra were collected at 500 MHz using a 1H/15N/13C probe and z axis pulsed field gradients at 298 K. The original SEA-HSQC pulse sequence was developed by Lin et al. (36Lin D. Sze K.H. Cui Y. Zhu G. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 23: 317-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) using a clean chemical exchange-phase modulated-PM mixing scheme. In this study, a Biopack version of the SEA-HSQC pulse sequence was used. The intertransient delay was set to 1.5 s, and the mixing time was 0.1 s. The spectra of PDZ3 and p397-PDZ3 were collected at a protein concentration of 1 mm with 16 transients. NMR intensity is a function of several factors such as protein concentration, nuclear relaxation time, solution conductivity, and protein tumbling time. Of these factors, protein tumbling time is significantly influenced by phosphorylation (see “Results”). This necessitates a method to scale the SEA-HSQC intensities of PDZ3 and p397-PDZ3 to allow direct comparison. The scaling procedure used the residues that are not affected by phosphorylation, i.e. those residues that experience slight or nearly no chemical shift perturbation as shown in Fig. 2A. The SEA-HSQC peak intensities of p397-PDZ3 for these residues were scaled to match those of PDZ3. From the crystal structure of PDZ3 (14Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar), the side chain of Tyr-397 is partially buried between α3 and the core domain of PDZ3 (Fig. 1B). This tyrosine residue is phosphorylated in mouse brain (27Ballif B.A. Carey G.R. Sunyaev S.R. Gygi S.P. J. Proteome Res. 2008; 7: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), although it is unknown which kinase in vivo is responsible for its phosphorylation. Tyr-397, located at the linker between PDZ3 and SH3, is highly conserved throughout MAGUK proteins of various organisms (Fig. 1A). Using the ExPASy Proteomics Server, we analyzed the first 100 homologue sequences of PSD-95, which belong to different organisms, different subfamilies, and different splicing forms. Only one conserved mutation (Tyr to Phe) was found. The high conservation of Tyr-397 implies its significance within the MAGUK family. Members of the Src family are known to interact with PSD-95 (37Kalia L.V. Salter M.W. Neuropharmacology. 2003; 45: 720-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Using the Group-based Prediction System (38Xue Y. Ren J. Gao X. Jin C. Wen L. Yao X. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2008; 7: 1598-1608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar), Src kinase was predicted to be capable of phosphorylating Tyr-397. Treatment of 15N-labeled PDZ3 with c-Src resulted in a new set of resonances in the HSQC spectrum of PDZ3. The relative peak intensities suggested that only 10% of PDZ3 was phosphorylated. The reaction went further to completion after removing ADP by dialysis and adding fresh ATP, which was repeated four times. This yielded ∼40% putative p397-PDZ3. Ion exchange chromatography was used to purify p397-PDZ3 based on the additional negative charge introduced by phosphorylation. The elution profile displayed five discrete species, three of which tested positive for protein (Fig. 2A). The first peak was confirmed to be PDZ3 from HSQC, and the third peak was confirmed to be pure phospho-PDZ3. An overlay of HSQC spectra of PDZ3 and putative p397-PDZ3 shows peaks shifting in regions of PDZ3 consistent with modification at Tyr-397 (Fig. 2B). The identity of the third peak was also analyzed by mass spectrometry (supplemental Fig. S2). Although the electrospray ionization ion trap mass spectrum indicated the correct mass for a singly phosphorylated species (supplemental Fig. S2A), MS-MS MALDI-TOF results suggested that the dominant species of the third peak was p397-PDZ3, although small amounts of p392-PDZ3 (<10%) could not be not ruled out (supplemental Fig. S2B). A species other than p397-PDZ3 was not found in 1H-15N HSQC, HNCO, HNCACB, or CBCA(CO)NH spectra. Based on this, the following NMR-based observations were interpreted to arise solely from p397-PDZ3. The above procedure was used to obtain milligram quantities of p397-PDZ3 for further biophysical characterization. To determine the effect of phosphorylation at Tyr-397 on PDZ3 structure, the backbone chemical shifts of p397-PDZ3 were assigned and compared with unphosphorylated PDZ3 (Fig. 3A). These chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) were then mapped onto the structure of PDZ3 (Fig. 3B). Phosphorylation resulted in CSPs radiating out from Tyr-397 to include all of α3 and its surrounding regions. Although the perturbation pattern is consistent with the general site of phosphorylation, the extent and specific nature of any structural change accompanying phosphorylation is more difficult to assess strictly from CSPs. In unphosphorylated PDZ3, the side chain of Tyr-397 packs into side chains of the β2 strand, the β3 strand, and the α1-β4 loop of the PDZ core. These hydrophobic interactions help to define how α3 packs against the PDZ core (Fig. 3B). One possible consequence of phosphorylation is therefore destabilization/unfolding of α3 because the phosphate group might occlude proper packing of α3. In this sense, phosphorylation of Tyr-397 would effectively convert PDZ3 into a C-terminally truncated form, much like PDZ(303–395) characterized previously and referred to as Δ7ct (21Petit C.M. Zhang J. Sapienza P.J. Fuentes E.J. Lee A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18249-18254Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). To test this idea, we compared [1H, 15N] amide chemical shifts of PDZ3, p397-PDZ3, and Δ7ct by superimposing HSQCs of the three proteins. Nearly all residues experiencing significant CSPs in p397-PDZ3 (Fig. 3) display a linear trend of HSQC peaks in the order PDZ3, p397-PDZ3, and Δ7ct (Fig. 4A). To quantitatively demonstrate linearity of these three sets of resonances, correlation values (adjusted R values) of linear fitting were calculated and plotted (Fig. 4B). Most R values are around 1, indicating high linearity for many residues. Because chemical shifts are highly nonlinear with respect to positioning of structural elements, such extensive linearity cannot be reasonably explained as accidental. Rather, the simplest explanation is that the peak positions of p397-PDZ3 are averaged due to fast exchange between two conformations: one in which α3 is packed as in native PDZ3 and one in which α3 is undocked and makes no contributions to chemical shifts in PDZ core residues. Thus, p397-PDZ3 exists as an equilibrium of two dynamically exchanging states represented by PDZ3 and Δ7ct, respectively. Preliminary 15N Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill relaxation dispersion experiments (39Palmer 3rd, A.G. Kroenke C.D. Loria J.P. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 339: 204-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar) on p397-PDZ3 did not detect this exchange; and thus, we conclude that exchange takes place on the microsecond or possibly even nanosecond timescale. Because p397-PDZ3 peaks occurred on average approximately half-way between unphosphorylated PDZ3 and Δ7ct peaks, the fraction of undocked α3 was estimated to be ∼50%. It was shown previously that truncation of α3 decreases binding affinity of PDZ3 with CRIPT peptide by 21-fold (21Petit C.M. Zhang J. Sapienza P.J. Fuentes E.J. Lee A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 18249-18254Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). If p397-PDZ3 is indeed a mixture of PDZ3- and Δ7ct-like states, an intermediate binding affinity to CRIPT peptide should be observed. To test this, we performed ITC experiments to measure the binding affinity of p397-PDZ3 to CRIPT C-terminal peptide. The binding affinity of p397-PDZ3 was found to be ∼4 times weaker than PDZ3, fallin"
https://openalex.org/W2068198033,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease characterized by inflammatory demyelination in the brain and spinal cord. The immune-mediated inflammation involves well orchestrated intermolecular interactions that exhibit rapid binding kinetics. The binding interfaces of transient interactions frequently include proline residues that favor an extended conformation for molecular recognition. Linear interface peptides are excellent lead inhibitors of specific protein-protein interactions because only small segments of the interface contribute to the binding. Glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ), a recently identified molecule exhibits potent anti-inflammatory properties. Mechanistically, a proline-rich segment in the carboxyl terminus of GILZ physically binds the p65 subunit of nuclear factor-κB and inhibits the transactivation of inflammatory cytokines. Integrating knowledge derived from the mechanism of action of GILZ with in silico structure prediction identified an immunomodulatory peptide, the GILZ-P. Treatment with GILZ-P exhibited therapeutic efficacy in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model for human MS."
https://openalex.org/W2061086112,"Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) have a dominant role in determining which of the seven lysine residues of ubiquitin is used for polyubiquitination. Here we show that tethering of a substrate to an E2 enzyme in the absence of an E3 ubiquitin ligase is sufficient to promote its ubiquitination, whereas the type of the ubiquitin conjugates and the identity of the target lysine on the substrate are promiscuous. In contrast, when an E3 enzyme is introduced, a clear decision between mono- and polyubiquitination is made, and the conjugation type as well as the identity of the target lysine residue on the substrate becomes highly specific. These features of the E3 can be further regulated by auxiliary factors as exemplified by MDMX (Murine Double Minute X). In fact, we show that this interactor reconfigures MDM2-dependent ubiquitination of p53. Based on several model systems, we propose that although interaction with an E2 is sufficient to promote substrate ubiquitination the E3 molds the reaction into a specific, physiologically relevant protein modification."
https://openalex.org/W2069490142,"Unlike malignancies of the nervous system, there have been no mutations identified in Merlin in breast cancer. As such, the role of the tumor suppressor, Merlin, has not been investigated in breast cancer. We assessed Merlin expression in breast cancer tissues by immunohistochemistry and by real-time PCR. The expression of Merlin protein (assessed immunohistochemically) was significantly decreased in breast cancer tissues (although the transcript levels were comparable) simultaneous with increased expression of the tumor-promoting protein, osteopontin (OPN). We further demonstrate that the loss of Merlin in breast cancer is brought about, in part, due to OPN-initiated Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Merlin leading to its proteasomal degradation. Restoring expression of Merlin resulted in reduced malignant attributes of breast cancer, characterized by reduced invasion, migration, motility, and impeded tumor (xenograft) growth in immunocompromised mice. The possibility of developing a model using the relationship between OPN and Merlin was tested with a logistic regression model applied to immunohistochemistry data. This identified consistent loss of immunohistochemical expression of Merlin in breast tumor tissues. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time a role for Merlin in impeding breast malignancy, identify a novel mechanism for the loss of Merlin protein in breast cancer, and have developed a discriminatory model using Merlin and OPN expression in breast tumor tissues."
https://openalex.org/W1977022795,"The initiation of translation in eukaryotes requires a suite of eIFs that include the cap-binding complex, eIF4F. eIF4F is comprised of the subunits eIF4G and eIF4E and often the helicase, eIF4A. The eIF4G subunit serves as an assembly point for other initiation factors, whereas eIF4E binds to the 7-methyl guanosine cap of mRNA. Plants have an isozyme form of eIF4F (eIFiso4F) with comparable subunits, eIFiso4E and eIFiso4G. Plant eIF4A is very loosely associated with the plant cap-binding complexes. The specificity of interaction of the individual subunits of the two complexes was previously unknown. To address this issue, mixed complexes (eIF4E-eIFiso4G or eIFiso4E-eIF4G) were expressed and purified from Escherichia coli for biochemical analysis. The activity of the mixed complexes in in vitro translation assays correlated with the large subunit of the respective correct complex. These results suggest that the eIF4G or eIFiso4G subunits influence translational efficiency more than the cap-binding subunits. The translation assays also showed varying responses of the mRNA templates to eIF4F or eIFiso4F, suggesting that some level of mRNA discrimination is possible. The dissociation constants for the correct complexes have K(D) values in the subnanomolar range, whereas the mixed complexes were found to have K(D) values in the ∼10 nm range. Displacement assays showed that the correct binding partner readily displaces the incorrect binding partner in a manner consistent with the difference in K(D) values. These results show molecular specificity for the formation of plant eIF4F and eIFiso4F complexes and suggest a role in mRNA discrimination during initiation of translation."

https://openalex.org/W2012138378,"Most cystic fibrosis (CF) cases are caused by the ΔF508 mutation in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which disrupts both the processing and gating of this chloride channel. The cell surface expression of ΔF508-CFTR can be ""rescued"" by culturing cells at 26-28 °C and treating cells with small molecule correctors or intragenic suppressor mutations. Here, we determined whether these various rescue protocols induce a ΔF508-CFTR conformation that is thermally stable in excised membrane patches. We also tested the impact of constitutive cytosolic loop mutations that increase ATP-independent channel activity (K978C and K190C/K978C) on ΔF508-CFTR function. Low temperature-rescued ΔF508-CFTR channels irreversibly inactivated with a time constant of 5-6 min when excised patches were warmed from 22 °C to 36.5 °C. A panel of CFTR correctors and potentiators that increased ΔF508-CFTR maturation or channel activity failed to prevent this inactivation. Conversely, three suppressor mutations in the first nucleotide binding domain rescued ΔF508-CFTR maturation and stabilized channel activity at 36.5 °C. The constitutive loop mutations increased ATP-independent activity of low temperature-rescued ΔF508-CFTR but did not enhance protein maturation. Importantly, the ATP-independent activities of these ΔF508-CFTR constructs were stable at 36.5 °C, whereas their ATP-dependent activities were not. Single channel recordings of this thermally stable ATP-independent activity revealed dynamic gating and unitary currents of normal amplitudes. We conclude that: (i) ΔF508-CFTR gating is highly unstable at physiologic temperature; (ii) most rescue protocols do not prevent this thermal instability; and (iii) ATP-independent gating and the pore are spared from ΔF508-induced thermal instability, a finding that may inform alternative treatment strategies."

Deregulation of PI3K/Akt signaling is linked to human diseases, including cancer and metabolic disorders. The PI3K-dependent signaling kinase complex mTORC2 (mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2) has been defined as the regulatory Ser-473 kinase of Akt. The regulation of mTORC2 remains very poorly characterized. We have reconstituted mTORC2 by its assembly in vitro or by co-expression its four essential components (rictor, SIN1, mTOR, mLST8). We show that the functional mTOR kinase domain is required for the mTORC2 activity as the Ser-473 kinase of Akt. We also found that mTOR by phosphorylation of SIN1 prevents its lysosomal degradation. Thus, the kinase domain of mTOR is required for the functional activity of mTORC2, and it controls integrity of mTORC2 by maintaining the protein stability of SIN1."
https://openalex.org/W2021833586,"Amylin, a 37-aa pancreatic peptide, was found to be expressed in the preoptic area of mother rats in our recent microarray study. Here, we report a marked increase in amylin expression around parturition and show that amylin mRNA level remains elevated as long as the pups are not removed from the dams. Amylin expression is also induced in maternally behaving (sensitized) nonlactating but not in nonsensitized nulliparous females or in females that did not become maternal despite the sensitization procedure. Immunohistochemistry verified the increased amylin peptide expression in maternally behaving rats and demonstrated the same expression pattern of amylin as in situ hybridization histochemistry. Ovariectomy had no effect on the activation of amylin neurons, suggesting sexual steroid-independent mechanisms. In subsequent functional experiments, mothers were separated from their pups for 22 h. On return of the pups, neuronal activation was found in the mother's preoptic area, with a distribution pattern similar to amylin-expressing neurons. Subsequent double labeling revealed that 86-93% of amylin neurons were activated by pup exposure. The results implicate amylin in the control of maternal adaptations, possibly exerting its actions on maternal behaviors via amylin receptors present in brain regions to which preoptic neurons project."

Mosquito saliva interferes with the host's hemostasis and inflammation response and influences the transmission success of some pathogens. One family of mosquito salivary gland proteins, named SGS, is composed of large bacterial-type proteins that in Aedes aegypti were implicated as receptors for Plasmodium on the basal salivary gland surface. Here, we characterize the biology of two SGSs in the malaria mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, and demonstrate their involvement in blood feeding. Western blots and RT-PCR showed that Sgs4 and Sgs5 are produced exclusively in female salivary glands, that expression increases with age and after blood feeding, and that protein levels fluctuate in a circadian manner. Immunohistochemistry showed that SGSs are present in the acinar cells of the distal lateral lobes and in the salivary ducts of the proximal lobes. SDS-PAGE, Western blots, bite blots, and immunization via mosquito bites showed that SGSs are highly immunogenic and form major components of mosquito saliva. Last, Western and bioinformatic analyses suggest that SGSs are secreted via a non-classical pathway that involves cleavage into a 300-kDa soluble fragment and a smaller membrane-bound fragment. Combined, these data strongly suggest that SGSs play an important role in blood feeding.

The saliva of hematophagous arthropods is a mixture of proteins and small molecules that assists in the acquisition of a blood meal by interfering with the host's hemostasis and inflammation response (1Mans B.J.

The injection of arthropod saliva into the vertebrate body also elicits an adaptive immune response that produces antibodies against some salivary constituents. For these reasons, the salivary components of blood-feeding arthropods have been proposed as markers used for surveying exposure to vector bites (3Remoue F. Cisse B. Ba F. Sokhna C. Herve J.P.

Before such applications can be developed, a better understanding of the “sialomes” of major disease vectors is necessary so that the best candidates for any of these uses can be identified. This task is compounded by the fact that functionally analogous salivary proteins are often not orthologous between groups of arthropods, so it is important to identify proteins from each relevant organism (1Mans B.J.

A candidate is gSG6, a protein found only in mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles that has shown promise in several laboratory and field studies (6Poinsignon A. Cornelie S. Ba F. Boulanger D. Sow C. Rossignol M. Sokhna C. Cisse B. Simondon F. Remoue F. Malar. J. 2009; 8: 198Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 7Drame P.M. Poinsignon A. Besnard P. Cornelie S. Le Mire J. Toto J.C.

The identification of other mosquito-specific (and genus-specific) salivary immunogens should improve this epidemiological method, and published data suggest that there are other yet unidentified saliva proteins that are more immunogenic than gSG6 (8Cornelie S. Remoue F. Doucoure S. Ndiaye T. Sauvage F.X. Boulanger D. Simondon F. Malar. J. 2007; 6: 75Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 9Owhashi M. Harada M. Suguri S. Ohmae H. Ishii A. Parasitol. Res. 2001; 87: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The saliva of mosquitoes and other arthropods has also been shown to modulate vertebrate immune responses, resulting in the enhanced transmission of certain pathogens (4Titus R.G. Bishop J.V. Mejia J.S. Parasite Immunol. 2006; 28: 131-141PubMed Google Scholar, 10Schneider B.S. Higgs S. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2008; 102: 400-408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Accordingly, vaccines that help incite the host antibody response against salivary immunomodulatory factors have been shown to lower the transmission rates of Leishmania parasites and have been proposed for use against other arthropod-vectored diseases (4Titus R.G. Bishop J.V. Mejia J.S. Parasite Immunol. 2006; 28: 131-141PubMed Google Scholar, 11Morris R.V. Shoemaker C.B. David J.R. Lanzaro G.C. Titus R.G. J.

Higgs S. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med.

Thus, the identification of novel immunomodulatory components of mosquito saliva may aid in the development of disease control strategies. In the past decade, transcriptomic and proteomic studies have greatly increased our knowledge of the sialomes of a number of arthropod vectors (1Mans B.J. Francischetti I.M. Kini R.M. Clemetson K.J.

(18Korochkina S. Barreau C. Pradel G. Jeffery E. Li J. Natarajan R. Shabanowitz J. Hunt D. Frevert U. Vernick K.D. Cell Microbiol. 2006; 8: 163-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)) that had not been predicted during earlier genome scans and that appear to have been horizontally transferred into the mosquito genome from a bacterial source whose only known living relatives are Wolbachia proteobacteria (19Klasson L. Kambris Z. Cook P.E. Walker T. Sinkins S.P. BMC Genomics. 2009; 10: 33Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). A member of this gene family was independently identified while screening a panel of monoclonal antibodies produced against A. aegypti salivary gland surface proteins. This protein, named aaSgs1 (GenBankTM number AAV28546), was shown to be required for the successful invasion of A. aegypti salivary glands by Plasmodium gallinaceum sporozoites (18Korochkina S.

Thus, the biology of SGSs is intriguing, because they have been implicated in the Plasmodium life cycle and represent a rare case of transdomain horizontal gene transfer. salivary gland surface protein 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol prophenoloxidase-activating protease. Using an array of complementary techniques, we conclusively show that two members of the A. gambiae SGS gene family, Sgs4 and Sgs5, are associated with blood feeding behavior, form prevalent components of mosquito saliva, and are major salivary immunogens. Further, we show that SGSs are not restricted to A. gambiae saliva, because they are primary saliva constituents in both the anopheline and culicine lineages. Based on these and other data (20Wasserman H.A. Singh S. Champagne D.E. Parasite Immunol. 2004; 26: 295-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we propose a putative role for SGSs as major immunomodulatory factors in mosquito saliva and offer an explanation for why SGSs have largely been overlooked in previous sialomic studies. A. gambiae (G3) and A. aegypti (LVP) mosquitoes were reared as described (21Hillyer J.F. Estévez-Lao T.Y. Dev. Comp. Immunol. 2010; 34: 141-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Briefly, larvae were hatched in plastic water containers and fed a mixture of koi food and yeast. Pupae were separated by size and allowed to eclose in 4.73-liter plastic containers with marquisette tops, and the adults were maintained on a 10% sugar solution at 27 °C, 75% relative humidity, and a 12-h light/12-h dark photoperiod with 30-min crepuscular periods that preceded and followed each light cycle. Unless otherwise stated, 5-day-old adult female mosquitoes were used for all experiments. Salivary glands were collected by submerging mosquitoes in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and pulling the heads off with watchmaker's forceps. Minuten pins held by pin vices were then used to separate the glands from the head or to search through the anterior thorax in the cases when the glands did not pull cleanly from the thorax. Mosquito saliva was collected by inducing salivation using pilocarpine. For A. gambiae, this was done in a manner similar to that of Remoue et al. (3Remoue F. Cisse B. Ba F. Sokhna C. Herve J.P. Boulanger D. Simondon F. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 2006; 100: 363-370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), except that topical application of 1% (w/v) pilocarpine with 0.2% Tween 20 in PBS (22Boorman J. Med. Vet. Entomol. 1987; 1: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) was used instead of malathion, and saliva was collected into mineral oil rather than water. Because A. aegypti are more heavily pubescent, salivation in this mosquito was instead induced by intrathoracic injection of 0.2 μl of a 0.01% (w/v) solution of pilocarpine in PBS. Only saliva from mosquitoes that visibly produced small droplets of saliva and appeared healthy after the end of the procedure was used in these experiments. A. gambiae bite blots were done by attaching a nitrocellulose membrane to the bottom of a water-filled glass bottle heated to 58 °C and pressing the membrane against the freshly replaced marquisette cover of a mosquito cage. Within seconds, female mosquitoes were attracted to the heat and began probing the membrane with their proboscis, and this was allowed to continue in the dark for 10 min. Because heat is a principal cue for blood feeding (23Bowen, M. F. (1996) in Ciba Foundation Symposium 200-Olfaction in Mosquito-Host Interactions (Bock, G. R., Cardew, G. eds) pp. 197–211, John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., Chichester, U.K..Google Scholar), we believe that this method stimulates the production of saliva in a manner similar to natural blood feeding, as opposed to the sugar-based collection methods used in prior studies (24Billingsley P.F. Hodivala K.J. Winger L.A. Sinden R.E. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1991; 85: 450-453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Following early suspicions that SGS levels might be affected by feeding behavior or circadian changes in expression, tissue collections were done between hours 6 and 8 of the light photoperiod, unless otherwise stated, and collection began at exactly the same times within each experiment. Protocols used in this study for the maintenance and use of vertebrate animals were approved by Vanderbilt University's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Vanderbilt University's Division of Animal Care oversaw and provided veterinary care for this study and is accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care. For non-salivary gland tissues, RNA from 10 mosquitoes was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and repurified using the PurelinkTM Micro-to-Midi total RNA purification System (Invitrogen). For salivary gland samples, RNA from 50 glands was isolated directly using the Purelink system, per the manufacturer's protocol for animal tissue samples. Up to 5 μg of RNA per sample was then treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI), and first strand cDNA was synthesized from poly(A) + RNA using the SuperScript® III first-strand synthesis system (Invitrogen). A standard phenol/chloroform extraction was used to purify the cDNA, and samples were then quantified and normalized. Standard PCR was conducted on a Bio-Rad DNA Engine® thermal cycler using Choice-TaqTM DNA polymerase (Denville Scientific, Metuchen, NJ). Real-time quantitative PCR was done using Power SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) on an ABI 7300 real-time PCR system, and relative quantification was carried out using the 2−ΔΔCT method (25Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (127159) Google Scholar). For both standard PCR and quantitative PCR, rpS7 was used as the reference gene. Primers used for standard PCR were Sgs4_d_F (5′-GCTGTTCCTTCGAAACTTGC-3′), Sgs4_d_R (5′-TCGCCGTGTATACCAATGAA-3′); Sgs5_d_F (5′-ACCGCAACCGTAGCAATAAC-3′), Sgs5_d_R (5′-TCGAACAATCTGGGAGGTTC-3′), rpS7_01F (5′-CGTGAGGTCGAGTTCAACAA-3′), and rpS7_01R (5′-GCTGCAAACTTCGGCTATTC-3′). Primers used for quantitative PCR were Sgs4_q01F (5′-TAACAACCCGCAGGAGATTC-3′), Sgs4_q01R (5′-GCTGCTGAATCGTTTCCTTC-3′), Sgs5_q01F (5′-GCATCGGATCGTGGAACTAT-3′), Sgs5_q01R (5′-GTGGTGCTTGGGATGAAACT-3′), rpS7_02F (5′-GACGGATCCCAGCTGATAAA-3′), and rpS7_02R 5′-GTTCTCTGGGAATTCGAACG-3′. Anti-SGS antibodies were produced by challenging rabbits with recombinant fragments of Sgs4 and Sgs5. Three polyclonal antibodies were developed. The first, referred to throughout this work as α-SGSRHS, recognizes both Sgs4 and Sgs5 and was produced against a region of Sgs4 that shares 96% amino acid identity with Sgs5. This region, residues 2248–2571 of Sgs4, is located directly N-terminal of the predicted transmembrane domain and includes the RHS (retrotransposon hot spot) domain. The other two antibodies, referred throughout this manuscript as α-Sgs4 and α-Sgs5, specifically recognize Sgs4 or Sgs5 by targeting unique regions located 88–549 and 512–822 residues from the N terminus, respectively. Briefly, the SGS regions detailed above were amplified by PCR using Accuprime Pfx SuperMix (Invitrogen). Resulting amplicons were cloned into the pET-46 Ek/LIC expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), and proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli cells. N-terminal His-tagged protein fragments were purified using BD TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech), and polyclonal antibodies were produced in rabbits (Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO). The IgG fraction of immune and preimmune sera was purified using a KPL Protein A-agarose kit (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD), concentrated using a 30-kDa cut-off Microcon® filter (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA), and buffer-exchanged to PBS. Antibody concentrations were determined by measuring A280 (26Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. 1st Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). Primers used to amplify the cloned fragments were as follows: for α-SGSRHS, Sgs4&5Pos_VS (5′-GACGACGACAAGATGTGTGGAAAACGACTCGCTCTGAAT-3′) and Sgs4&5Neg_VS (5′-GAGGAGAAGCCCGGTCTTACCCCGAACCTGCTTGAATGT-3′); for α-Sgs4, Sgs4_5P2_F (5′-GACGACGACAAGATCAAGGTGAAAGGGTTCGTGT-3′) and Sgs4_5P2_R (5′-GAGGAGAAGCCCGGTCGTCGCTTGCTCAAGTTTTCC-3′); for α-Sgs5, Sgs5_Pos_VS (5′-GACGACGACAAGATGCGACAAACGCAAACCTTCACATCG-3′) and Sgs5Neg_VS (5′-GAGGAGAAGCCCGGTTGCTTTCACGGTTACCCATTCTCC-3′) (vector sequences are underlined). Antibodies against A. gambiae saliva were produced in female Swiss Webster mice via exposure to mosquito bites. Mice were placed on top of cages containing ∼150 starved female mosquitoes and fed upon for 5 min. Halfway through the procedure, mice were lifted off the cage and quickly repositioned, which induced the mosquitoes to reprobe. Blood was collected by cardiac puncture, and serum was purified (26Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. 1st Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar) at the end of each of three bite regimens: 1 week after a single bite exposure, 1 week after the last of three weekly bite exposures, and 1 week after the last of six weekly bite exposures. Non-immune control sera were purified from age- and cage-matched naive mice. In order to accommodate the large size of SGSs, a variety of gels and protein standards were used throughout the study. These varied depending on the level of resolution and the protein mass inclusion best suited for an individual experiment. Whole tissues (salivary glands, thoraces, etc.) were either homogenized in 1% Nonidet P-40 buffer containing Complete® protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science) prior to mixing with denaturing NuPage® LDS loading buffer (Invitrogen) containing 2.5% β-mercaptoethanol or were homogenized directly in denaturing buffer with β-mercaptoethanol. Collected saliva was pooled, vigorously mixed with LDS sample buffer, and separated from the mineral oil by centrifugation at 8,600 × g for 5 min. Whole tissue or saliva samples were then electrophoresed in either 4% Tris/glycine polyacrylamide gels for 2 h at 125 V, 3–8% Tris acetate polyacrylamide gels for 1 h at 150 V, or 4–12% BisTris polyacrylamide gels for 1 h at 200 V, and separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Invitrogen) using the manufacturer's protocol. Western blotting was subsequently performed using the KPL Protein DetectorTM LumiGLO Western blotting kit (Gaithersburg, MD). When necessary, Western blots were stripped using RestoreTM Western blot stripping buffer (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) prior to reprobing. Bite blots of mosquito saliva were treated in a manner similar to our Western blots and the bite blots of previous authors (24Billingsley P.F. Hodivala K.J. Winger L.A. Sinden R.E. Trans. R. Soc. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1991; 85: 450-453Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A step similar to a standard transfer was included to ensure that saliva proteins were strongly bound to the membrane. In order to assess the presence of total proteins in salivary samples, an imidazole-zinc negative detection protocol was used (27Castellanos-Serra L. Hardy E. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 1544-1551Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Although imidazole-zinc staining is very sensitive, it does not allow for the quantification of relative band content. When this was necessary, a quantitative Coomassie staining protocol was used (28Sasse, J., Gallagher, S. R. (2009) Curr. Protoc. Mol. Biol., Chapter 10, Unit 10.6.Google Scholar). Gels were digitally scanned in a manner that avoided signal saturation, and densitograms were produced in ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Salivary glands were dissected, fixed for 1 min in 100% acetone, and washed three times for 5 min each in PBS. Washed samples were blocked with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS (B-PBS) for 1 h, rinsed three times for 5 min each in PBS, and incubated in rabbit α-Sgs4, α-Sgs5, or preimmune IgG in B-PBS for 1 h. Samples were then washed as above, incubated in goat α-rabbit Alexa Fluor 568 (Invitrogen) with 0.01 mg/ml Hoescht 33342 in B-PBS for 1 h, washed, and mounted on slides using Aqua-Poly/Mount (Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA). Salivary glands were imaged using differential interference contrast and fluorescence illumination on a Nikon 90i light microscope (Nikon Corp., Tokyo, Japan) connected to a Photometrics CoolSNAP HQ2 high sensitivity monochrome CCD camera (Roper Scientific, Ottobrunn, Germany), and Z-stack images were captured and analyzed using Nikon Advanced Research NIS-Elements software. To determine the precise location of SGS staining, Z-stacks were processed using the AQ 3D Blind Deconvolution module of NIS-Elements, and for the purpose of publication, Z-stacks were flattened into two dimensions using the Maximum Intensity Projection module of NIS-Elements. Throughout, Protein A-purified primary (immune and preimmune) and secondary antibodies were used at concentrations of 10 and 2.6 μg/ml, respectively. SGS sequences were scanned for functional sites that occur in non-structured regions using the Eukaryotic Linear Motif server (available on the World Wide Web), applying A. gambiae as the taxonomic range filter. The ExPASy PeptideCutter tool was used to scan for putative caspase-1 family cleavage sites (see the ExPASy Web site), and SignalP 3.0 and SecretomeP 2.0 (both at the Center for Biological Sequence Analysis Web site) were used to search for classical and non-classical signal peptide cleavage sites, respectively. Following prediction of protease cleavage sites, the predicted molecular weights of SGS fragments were calculated using the Compute pI/Mw tool in ExPASy, and ExPASy ProtScale was used to plot hydrophobicity using the Rao and Argos scale (29Mohana Rao J.K. Argos P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 869: 197-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). To determine the tissue-specific transcription of Anopheles SGSs, cDNA synthesized from salivary glands, heads, thoraces, thoraces from which the salivary glands had been removed, or abdomens of female mosquitoes was used as template for PCR using gene-specific primers. PCR revealed that sgs4 (GenBankTM number AAV28544) and sgs5 (GenBankTM number AAV28545) are only transcribed in the salivary glands and in the thorax but that when the salivary glands are removed from the thorax, this signal disappears (Fig. 1A). Quantitative PCR confirmed this finding and further showed that mRNA levels of sgs4 and sgs5 are 120- and 143-fold higher, respectively, in the salivary glands when compared with the whole body (Fig. 1B). When mRNA levels of sgs2 and sgs3 were assayed, expression was inconsistently detected and only in non-salivary gland tissues (not shown). For this reason, Sgs2 and Sgs3 were not studied further. Given the salivary gland specificity of sgs4 and sgs5, a polyclonal antibody that recognizes both Sgs4 and Sgs5 was developed (α-SGSRHS). Western analyses revealed that, much like the transcription data, Sgs4 and Sgs5 are salivary gland-specific (Fig. 1C), and interestingly, Sgs4 and Sgs5 are present exclusively in the salivary glands of female mosquitoes (Fig. 1D). Within female salivary glands, Sgs4 and Sgs5 levels are minimal in freshly eclosed mosquitoes and peak around 10 days of age (Fig. 1E). When a blood meal is provided, levels of Sgs4 and Sgs5 immediately increase and remain elevated for the lifetime of the mosquito (Fig. 1F). Given that these data suggest that Sgs4 and Sgs5 are involved in some aspect of blood feeding, antibodies that selectively recognize Sgs4 or Sgs5 were constructed. Stripping and reprobing of the same Western blot with each of the three α-SGS antibodies confirmed the band identities and showed that Sgs5 is slightly more massive than Sgs4 (Fig. 1G). Analysis of quantitatively deconvolved Z-stacks acquired from salivary glands immunolabeled with α-Sgs4 or α-Sgs5 revealed that both of these proteins are present on the basal and apical cellular surfaces of the distal lateral lobes (Fig. 2, A–J). Lower intensity staining was also detected in the salivary ducts of the proximal lateral lobes, a pattern that also suggests a role in blood feeding. Preimmune controls (Fig. 2, G–I) and midguts labeled with α-Sgs4 and α-Sgs5 showed no staining. Because of the unexpected finding that Anopheles SGSs are present in the salivary ducts, Western blots were conducted in salivary glands that were disarticulated into their three anatomical regions: the distal lateral lobes, the proximal lateral lobes, and the median lobes. Western analyses confirmed the immunolabeling results and suggest that both Sgs4 and -5 are subjected to processing in the proximal lateral region of the salivary glands because in these regions, their mass is reduced by ∼10 kDa (Fig. 2K). Finally, during the immunolabeling experiments, unambiguous differences between α-SGS samples and preimmune controls were only obtained after fixation with organic solvents (acetone or ethanol) and not following fixation with formaldehyde, regardless of permeabilization with Triton X-100 or heat-induced antigen retrieval. This suggests that SGSs are either located in a region inaccessible to the antibodies following aldehyde fixation or that the antibodies do not efficiently bind the native proteins. Because expression and localization data suggested that Sgs4 and -5 may be involved in blood feeding, mosquito salivation was artificially induced, and the collected saliva was analyzed for the presence of Sgs4 and Sgs5. Western analyses conclusively detected both Sgs4 and -5 in mosquito saliva (Fig. 3, A and B). In order to ensure that the presence of SGSs in saliva was not the result of pilocarpine treatment, we used heat to entice mosquitoes to probe a nitrocellulose membrane and performed “bite blots” using α-SGS antibodies. Bite blots revealed that Sgs4 and Sgs5 are released with the saliva during probing. Sgs4 and"
https://openalex.org/W2059901121,"MCM2-7 proteins form a stable heterohexamer with DNA helicase activity functioning in the DNA replication of eukaryotic cells. The MCM2-7 complex is loaded onto chromatin in a cell cycle-dependent manner. The phosphorylation of MCM2-7 proteins contributes to the formation of the MCM2-7 complex. However, the regulation of specific MCM phosphorylation still needs to be elucidated. In this study, we demonstrate that MCM3 is a substrate of cyclin E/Cdk2 and can be phosphorylated by cyclin E/Cdk2 at Thr-722. We find that the MCM3 T722A mutant binds chromatin much less efficiently when compared with wild type MCM3, suggesting that this phosphorylation site is involved in MCM3 loading onto chromatin. Interestingly, overexpression of MCM3, but not MCM3 T722A mutant, inhibits the S phase entry, whereas it does not affect the exit from mitosis. Knockdown of MCM3 does not affect S phase entry and progression, indicating that a small fraction of MCM3 is sufficient for normal S phase completion. These results suggest that excess accumulation of MCM3 protein onto chromatin may inhibit DNA replication. Other studies indicate that excess of MCM3 up-regulates the phosphorylation of CHK1 Ser-345 and CDK2 Thr-14. These data reveal that the phosphorylation of MCM3 contributes to its function in controlling the S phase checkpoint of cell cycle in addition to the regulation of formation of the MCM2-7 complex."

In mammals, three major SUMO isoforms, SUMO1–3, have been identified. SUMO2 and SUMO3 are almost identical, as they share about 97% amino acid sequence identity and collectively are referred to as SUMO2/3 in most cases, whereas SUMO1 exhibits ∼50% amino acid sequence identity with SUMO2 and SUMO3. small ubiquitin-related modifier SUMO-interacting motif metastasis tumor antigen 1 protein inhibitor of activated STAT sentrin/SUMO-specific protease nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase estrogen-responsive element triple mutant I711A/V712A/I713A mouse embryonic fibroblast RNA polymerase II. SUMO is attached covalently to ϵ-lysine embedded in the ϕKXE motif (ϕ represents hydrophobic amino acid, and X stands for any amino acid) within the target protein in an enzymatic cascade similar to ubiquitination. SUMO conjugation requires one SUMO-activating enzyme, E1 (Aos1/Uba2); a single conjugating enzyme, E2 (UBC9); and in some cases, additional E3 ligases (4Rytinki M.M. Kaikkonen S. Pehkonen P. Jääskeläinen T. Palvimo J.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 3029-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Like many cellular processes, SUMOylation is a highly dynamic process and can be reversed by a family of sentrin/SUMO-specific proteases (SENPs) (5Gareau J.R. Lima C.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 861-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). SUMO can interact noncovalently with protein through the SUMO-interacting motif (SIM) in the target as well. To date, the best featured class of SIM consists of a hydrophobic core ((V/I)X(V/I)(V/I)) flanked by acidic amino acids, which together may contribute to SUMO binding affinity, orientation, and paralog selection (6Kerscher O. EMBO Rep. 2007; 8: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Some SUMO substrates also contain one or more functional SIMs (7Saether T. Pattabiraman D.R. Alm-Kristiansen A.H.

Metastasis tumor antigen 1 (MTA1), a component of the Mi-2·nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, is widely up-regulated in human cancers and plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis and tumor metastasis (9Toh Y.

It has been established that MTA1 modulates gene transcription by interacting with a co-repressor (e.g. HDAC2) or a co-activator (e.g. MiCoA), depending on the promoter context (10Mazumdar A.

It is of interest to determine how MTA1 coordinates this association with different co-regulators. Posttranslational modification could be one useful way. Recent studies suggest that the activity of MTA1 can be regulated dynamically by ubiquitination and acetylation. Reduced MTA1 ubiquitination contributes to its stability and then exerts its function in DNA damage repair (13Li D.Q. Ohshiro K. Reddy S.D. Pakala S.B. Lee M.H. Zhang Y. Rayala S.K. Kumar R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 17493-17498Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Acetylated MTA1 is required for the activation of the Ras-Raf pathway (14Ohshiro K. Rayala S.K. Wigerup C. Pakala S.B. Natha R.S. Gururaj A.E. Molli P.R. Månsson S.S. Ramezani A. Hawley R.G. Landberg G. Lee N.H. Kumar R. EMBO Rep. 2010; 11: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, whether MTA1 could be SUMOylated and how its functions are influenced by SUMO remain unknown. Here, we report that MTA1 is a SUMO2/3 substrate in vivo and define one functional SIM in its C terminus. The SIM of MTA1 is required for efficient SUMO conjugation of MTA1 but not paralog-selective SUMOylation, which may be regulated by protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) proteins. Moreover, SUMOylation of MTA1 at Lys-509 within the SUMO consensus site together with SIM may synergistically regulate MTA1-mediated repression of PS2 by recruiting HDAC2 onto the PS2 promoter. In addition, MTA1 up-regulates the expression of SUMO2. These findings not only suggest a synergistic regulatory mechanism of SUMO modification and SIM in MTA1-mediated gene transcription but also reveal a possible function of MTA1 in regulating the SUMOylation pathway. pCMV-Myc-MTA1, full-length pcDNA-T7-MTA1 and its fragments (residues 1–164, 1–226, 1–441, 227–388, 442–715, and 542–715), and the Gal4–3×ERE reporter gene have been described previously (10Mazumdar A.

Cell lysates were incubated with the indicated antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The immunoprecipitates were collected on protein A/G-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The beads were washed with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer three times and boiled in 2× SDS sample buffer. The bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting. Denaturing immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously (16Kane S. Sano H. Liu S.C. Asara J.M. Lane W.S. Garner C.C. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol.

Briefly, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed with SDS lysis buffer (4% SDS, 10 mm DTT, 300 mm NaCl, and 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.5)) supplemented with 20 mm N-ethylmaleimide, 10 mm iodoacetamide, and protease inhibitor mixture at 100 °C for 5 min. The lysates were diluted 10-fold with dilution buffer (1.7% Thesit, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5)) and then incubated with the indicated primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. The immunoprecipitates were collected on protein A/G-Sepharose beads followed by washing with washing buffer (0.5% Thesit, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5)) four times and boiling in 2× SDS sample buffer. The bound proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to Western blotting. For the in vitro SUMOylation assay, T7-tagged MTA1-WT and its mutants were generated by in vitro transcription/translation in the presence of 35S-labeled methionine using the TnT T7 Quick Coupled Transcription/Translation System (Promega, Madison, WI). Unless otherwise noted, in vitro SUMOylation reactions were performed at 37 °C for 1.5 h with the mixture including 75 ng of Aos1/Uba2 (LAE Biotech International, Rockville, MD), 1.5 μg of GST-UBC9, 1 μg of SUMO1 or SUMO2, 2 mm ATP, and 1 μl of 35S-labeled and in vitro translated T7-tagged MTA1 or its mutants in a total volume of 20 μl. Reaction buffer was composed of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm DTT, and 0.05% Tween 20. For the E3 ligase assay, equal amounts of in vitro translated, unlabeled, T7-tagged PIAS proteins were added to the reactions containing 0.03 μg of GST-UBC9. For the in vitro deSUMOylation assay, SUMO2-modified MTA1 was prepared as described above and incubated with equal amounts of in vitro translated, unlabeled, FLAG-tagged SENP-WT or their inactive mutants at 37 °C for 1.5 h. The reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by direct autoradiography. For the in vivo SUMOylation and deSUMOylation assays, COS-1 or MCF-7 cells were co-transfected with the indicated expression vectors. Cell lysate preparation and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA; Qiagen, Valencia, CA) pulldown were performed as described previously (17Tatham M.H. Rodriguez M.S. Xirodimas D.P. Hay R.T. Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 1363-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The proteins were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Myc mouse antibody. 35S-Labeled, in vitro translated proteins or MCF-7 cell lysates were incubated with GST control or GST fusion proteins and glutathione-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) at 4 °C overnight in binding buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 3 mm KCl, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm DTT) supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture. After washing, bound proteins were eluted with 2× SDS sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting followed by direct autoradiography or with the indicated antibodies. MCF-7 cells were cultured on coverslips in 6-well plates. The cells were washed briefly with ice-cold PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and then washed with cold PBS three times. The cells were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies for 1 h followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). MCF-7 cells (3 × 105) were plated in 6-well plates with IMEM supplemented with 5% charcoal-dextran-stripped fetal bovine serum 24 h before transfection. The cells were co-transfected with 200 ng of reporter plasmid, the indicated expression constructs, and 10 ng of pSV-β-galactosidase control vector encoding β-galactosidase used for internal control using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science). Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were induced with 10 nm 17β-estradiol and then collected and lysed after another 24 h and assayed for luciferase activity following the manufacturer's instructions (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized to the activity of the internal standard, β-galactosidase. Each experiment was repeated three times. Total 106 MCF-7 cells were cross-linked by 1% formaldehyde solution. The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed as described previously (10Mazumdar A. Wang R.A. Mishra S.K. Adam L. Bagheri-Yarmand R. Mandal M. Vadlamudi R.K. Kumar R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). After immunoprecipitation with the corresponding antibodies, the eluted DNA was amplified by PCR. For human SUMO2 promoter, the following primers used were: R1, 5′- AGGGACAAAAGGAAATAATAAAG-3′ (sense) and 5′- ATATTCATGTATTCATTCAACGAG-3′ (antisense); R2, 5′-GAGAGTGTTGATCTGAACTAGATG-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATCTTGTCTATTCCACCTTCTTAC-3′ (antisense); and R3, 5′-CATATTGCAGTATCTTTGTGTTTT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAACCCAGTGTCTCTACTAAAAAT-3′ (antisense). siRNA targeting MTA1 or UBC9 and negative control siRNA were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO). MCF-7 cells were seeded at 40% density 1 day before transfection, and siRNA transfection was performed with Oligofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were harvested 48–72 h after transfection, and cell lysates or total RNA was prepared. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed by using iQTM SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories) on a CFX96 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). The primers used for mRNA expression levels were as follows: for human PS2, 5′-CACCATGGAGAACAAGGTGA-3′(sense) and 5′-TGACACCAGGAAAACCACAA-3′ (antisense); for human UBC9, 5′-CAGGAGAGGAAAGCATGGAG-3′ (sense) and 5′-TCGGGTGAAATAATGGTGGT-3′ (antisense); for human SUMO2, 5′-GCAGACGGGAGGTGTCTACT-3′(sense) and 5′-AGTCAGGATGTGGTGGAACC-3′ (antisense); for human and mouse MTA1, 5′-TGCTCAACGGGAAGTCCTAC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTTTCCGAGGATGAGAGCAG-3′ (antisense); for mouse SUMO2, 5′-CAGCCAATCAACGAAACAGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-ATGTGGTGGGACCAAATTGT-3′ (antisense); for human β-actin, 5′-GGACTTCGAGCAAGAGATGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGCACTGTGTTGGCGTACAG-3′ (antisense); and for mouse β-actin, 5′-GTCGTACCACAGGCATTGTGATGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-GCAATGCCTGGGTACATGGTGG-3′ (antisense). The primers of PS2 used for ChIP were: 5′-TGGGCTTCATGAGCTCC-3′ (sense) and 5′-TACTCATATCTGAGAGGCCCT-3′ (antisense). A publicly available breast cancer data set, GSE 3494-HGU133A was used to analyze the correlation between MTA1 and SUMO2. The data set consists of samples from 251 freshly frozen primary tumors from breast cancer patients in Uppsala County, Sweden. The probes used to detect the transcript levels of MTA1 were 202247_s_at and 211783_s_at, and those used for SUMO2 levels were 208739_x_at, 215452_x_at, 208738_x_at, and 213881_x_at. The intensity values for each of the probes were preprocessed and summarized using GeneSpring GX 11.0. The z-score for each probe in each sample was then calculated and averaged for further analysis. Pearson's correlation test was used to analyze the correlation between MTA1 and SUMO2 in the chosen data set by using the mean z-score. While searching for the potential SUMO consensus site in MTA1 (SUMOsp2.0), we found that human MTA1 contains only one highly conserved SUMO consensus site across species, IKAE (residues 508–511), which is located outside all functional domains (Fig. 1A). We first used a reconstituted in vitro SUMO modification system to examine whether MTA1 could be SUMOylated. To this aim, 35S-labeled, in vitro translated, full-length MTA1 was incubated with recombinant Aos1/Uba2 (E1), GST-UBC9 (E2), SUMO1, or SUMO2 in the presence of ATP. In the control reaction without the E1 enzyme, a unique, major band of MTA1, which migrated to 75 kDa, was detected (Fig. 1B, lanes 1 and 3). In contrast, the addition of the E1 enzyme to the reaction containing SUMO1 or SUMO2 resulted in the formation of equal poly-SUMO chains (Fig. 1B, lanes 2 and 4). These results suggest that MTA1 can be modified equally by either SUMO1 or SUMO2 in vitro. To examine whether SUMO paralogs could modify MTA1 in vivo, Myc-tagged MTA1 was co-expressed with HA-His-tagged SUMO1 or SUMO2 in COS-1 cells. After affinity purification, multiple shifted bands, representing SUMOylated MTA1, were detected around 120–130 kDa in the samples overexpressing HA-His-tagged SUMO1 or SUMO2. The SUMO2-modified MTA1 showed more retention on Ni-NTA beads than SUMO1-modified MTA1 (Fig. 1C, lane 7 versus 8). In addition, we observed a band at 75 kDa (Fig. 1C, lanes 6–8) corresponding to unmodified Myc-tagged MTA1 (Fig. 1C, lanes 2–4), most likely retained on Ni-NTA beads via the zinc finger motif as described previously for HIC1 (18Stankovic-Valentin N. Deltour S. Seeler J. Pinte S. Vergoten G. Guérardel C. Dejean A. Leprince D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 2661-2675Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Next, we tested SUMOylation of endogenous MTA1 by performing a denaturing immunoprecipitation using MCF-7 cell extracts. After immunoprecipitation with anti-MTA1 rabbit antibody, one dispersed shifted band at about 110–120 kDa was detected when blotted with anti-SUMO2/3 rabbit antibody (Fig. 1D, left panel) but not with anti-SUMO1 mouse antibody (Fig. 1D, right panel). In addition, one band around 120 kDa was also detected by performing a reciprocal denaturing immunoprecipitation with anti-SUMO2/3 rabbit antibody followed by Western blotting with anti-MTA1 rabbit antibody (Fig. 1E). The different number of bands around 120 kDa, which were observed in the denaturing immunoprecipitation and Ni-NTA pulldown assay, probably resulted from the antibodies we used, because the result from the in vitro SUMOylation assay correlated with that seen in the Ni-NTA pulldown assay. Moreover, we found that endogenous MTA1 interacted with UBC9 in vivo when co-immunoprecipitation was performed (Fig. 1F). Furthermore, endogenous MTA1 and SUMO2/3 showed a clear co-localization in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1G). Taken together, all of the above results confirm that MTA1 is a potent SUMO substrate and is modified preferentially by SUMO2/3 in vivo. Interestingly, MTA2, another member of the MTA family that contains the same SUMO consensus site (IKAE) as MTA1, can also be modified by SUMO2/3 but not by SUMO1 in vivo (supplemental Fig. S1). To address the potential target site for SUMO modification, Lys-509, which is located in the highly conserved SUMO consensus site in MTA1 (Fig. 1A, right panel), was mutated to an arginine residue. The wild type (WT) and the K509R mutant of 35S-labeled MTA1 were generated and subjected to an in vitro SUMOylation assay. With MTA1-WT, two close, slower migrating bands around 110–120 kDa were detected (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 5). In contrast, the upper band (Fig. 2A, arrowheads) significantly decreased with the K509R mutant (Fig. 2A, left panel, lane 2 versus 3) and was absent when using a low concentration of GST-UBC9 (Fig. 2A, right panel, lane 5 versus 6), but the lower band remained. To further confirm these findings, COS-1 cells were co-transfected with the Myc-tagged MTA1-WT or MTA1-K509R mutant and HA-His-tagged SUMO2 constructs. After Ni-NTA affinity purification, only one strong band (Fig. 2B, arrowhead) was missing in the K509R mutant compared with that in the WT (lane 3 versus 4). These results indicate that Lys-509 is the major SUMO acceptor site and both consensus and non-consensus sites are involved in the SUMOylation of MTA1. Besides Lys-509, there are another two lysine residues (Lys-41 and Lys-350) located in two inverted SUMO consensus sites (39EAKV42 and 348ESKL351) within MTA1. As the mutation of Lys-509 to arginine did not completely abolish SUMOylation of MTA1, we assumed that Lys-41 and Lys-350 might function as SUMO acceptor sites as well. However, we could not detect any difference between the K509R mutant and the mutants harboring K41R or K350R along with K509R when performing the in vitro SUMOylation assay (Fig. 2C, lanes 7 and 8 versus 3). Similar results were obtained when we attempted to identify other potential SUMOylation sites (Fig. 2C, lanes 4–6 versus 3). Based on these results, we focused on investigating the function of SUMO conjugation on Lys-509 in the subsequent study. Although MTA1 can be SUMOylated in the reactions without E3 ligase (Fig. 1B), we could not exclude the possibility that an E3 ligase might be required for SUMOylation of MTA1. PIAS proteins and RanBP2 are well known E3 ligases in the SUMO conjugation pathway (4Rytinki M.M. Kaikkonen S. Pehkonen P. Jääskeläinen T. Palvimo J.J. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 3029-3041Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 19Pichler A. Gast A. Seeler J.S. Dejean A. Melchior F. Cell. 2002; 108: 109-120Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Because MTA1 is located primarily in the nucleus (Fig. 1G), we hypothesized that PIAS proteins, which are also located mainly in the nucleus, might function as E3 ligases for the SUMO modification of MTA1. To test this hypothesis, in vitro translated PIAS proteins were added to the SUMOylation reactions in the presence of limited recombinant GST-UBC9 (0.03 μg in 20 μl). As shown in Fig. 3A, the addition of PIAS3 significantly enhanced the formation of SUMO2-conjugated MTA1 (Fig. 3A, lane 3). In contrast, PIAS1 and PIASy have a moderate effect on the SUMOylation of MTA1 (Fig. 3A, lanes 2 and 4). To confirm these results in vivo, COS-1 cells were co-transfected with Myc-tagged MTA1 and limited HA-His-tagged SUMO2 (0.2 μg) expression vectors, alone or together with FLAG-tagged PIAS1, PIAS3, or PIASy constructs. Consistent with the above results, we found that all of the indicated PIAS proteins stimulated the modification by SUMO2 and that PIAS3 (Fig. 3B, lane 4) showed more conjugation efficiency than PIAS1 and PIASy (Fig. 3B, lanes 3 and 5). Furthermore, the interactions of the indicated PIAS proteins with MTA1 were validated by co-immunoprecipitation (supplemental Fig. S2A). Given that SUMOylation is a highly dynamic process, we next examined which SUMO-specific isopeptidase might be involved in the deSUMOylation of MTA1. In the SENP family, SENP1 is located in the nucleus and SENP2 in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and SENP3 and SENP5 mainly exert their functions in the nucleolus (5Gareau J.R. Lima C.D. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 861-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). To analyze directly whether SENP1, SENP2, or SENP3 could catalyze the deSUMOylation of MTA1, an in vitro deSUMOylation assay was performed. PreSUMOylated MTA1 was incubated with the WT or catalytically inactive mutant forms of SENP1, SENP2, or SENP3. We found that the SUMO2 conjugates were significantly reduced under conditions of supplementation with SENP1-WT or SENP2-WT proteins (Fig. 3C, lanes 3 and 5) but not in the reactions with the addition of their inactive mutants (Fig. 3C, lanes 4 and 6). In contrast, neither SENP3-WT nor its inactive mutant could decrease the SUMOylation of MTA1 (Fig. 3C, lanes 7 and 8). Moreover, similar results were observed in vivo when we co-transfected Myc-tagged MTA1 with HA-His-tagged SUMO2 expression vectors, alone or together with FLAG-tagged SENP1–3 WT or their mutant constructs (Fig. 3D). Furthermore, the interactions of SENP1 or SENP2 with MTA1 were validated by co-immunoprecipitation (supplemental Fig. S2B). Collectively, these results suggest that SENP1 and SENP2, but not SENP3, may function as deSUMOylation enzymes for MTA1. Given that the elevated levels of MTA1 are closely correlated with tumor progression and metastasis (9Toh Y. Oki E. Oda S. Tokunaga E. Ohno S. Maehara Y. Nicolson G.L. Sugimachi K. Int. J. Cancer. 1997; 74: 459-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), we next examined whether SUMO modification could affect the protein stability of MTA1. To this aim, we first examined the stability of endogenous MTA1 in MCF-7 cells overexpressing empty vector, HA-His-tagged SUMO2 or FLAG-tagged UBC9, PIAS3, or SENP1, respectively. We found that the induced expression of SUMO2, UBC9, PIAS3, or SENP1 did not change the protein levels of endogenous MTA1 (Fig. 4A). Consistently, knockdown of endogenous UBC9 in MCF-7 cells also did not affect the protein levels of endogenous MTA1 (Fig. 4B). Next, we tested whether SUMOylation and ubiquitination could share the same lysine residue, Lys-509, by comparing the stability between MTA1-WT and the MTA1-K509R mutant. MCF-7 cells were transfected with Myc-tagged MTA1-WT or the MTA1-K509R mutant construct and then treated with cycloheximide to block new protein synthesis. Cells were harvested at var"
https://openalex.org/W2043593991,"Glycosphingolipids (GSLs) are crucially important components of the cellular membrane, where they comprise microdomains with many critical biological functions. Despite this fact, qualitative and quantitative techniques for the analysis of GSLs still lag behind the needs of researchers. In this study, a reliable procedure for the elucidation of cellular GSL-glycomes was established based on (a) enzymatic glycan cleavage by endoglycosylceramidases derived from Rhodococcus sp. in combination with (b) glycoblotting-assisted sample preparation. The mixture of endoglycosylceramidase I and II was employed to maximize the release of glycan moieties from the major classes of GSLs (i.e. ganglio-, (neo)lacto- and globo-series GSLs). The glycoblotting technique enabled the quantitative detection of GSL-glycans using as few as 2 × 10(5) cells. Thirty-seven different kinds of cellular GSL glycans were successfully observed in 11 kinds of cells, including Chinese hamster ovary cells and their lectin-resistant mutants as well as murine and human embryonic carcinoma cells. Furthermore, in-depth structural clarification in terms of discrimination of isomers was achieved by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry analysis and/or linkage-specific glycosidase digestion. These novel analytical techniques were shown to be capable of delineating cell-specific GSL-glycomes. Thus, they are anticipated to have a broad range of applications for the characterization, description, and comparison of various cellular/tissue samples in the fields of drug discovery and regenerative medicine."

Although native human SP-D shows potent antiviral and aggregating activity, trimeric recombinant neck+CRDs (NCRDs) show little or no capacity to influence IAV infection. A mutant trimeric NCRD, D325A/R343V, showed marked hemagglutination inhibition and viral neutralization, with viral aggregation and aggregation-dependent viral uptake by neutrophils. D325A/R343V exhibited glucose-sensitive binding to Phil82 hemagglutinin trimer (HA) by surface plasmon resonance. By contrast, there was very low binding to the HA trimer from another virus (PR8) that lacks glycans on the HA head. Mass spectrometry demonstrated the presence of high mannose glycans on the Phil82 HA at positions known to contribute to IAV binding. Molecular modeling predicted an enhanced capacity for bridging interactions between HA glycans and D325A/R343V.

Binding of SP-D to IAV involves interactions with asparagine-linked glycans located near the sialic acid receptor on the hemagglutinin (11Hartshorn K.L. White M.R. Voelker D. R Coburn J. Zaner K.

Furthermore, endoglycosidase H eliminates binding of SP-D to denatured HA in viral lysates, indicating preferential interactions with high mannose or hybrid oligosaccharides (11Hartshorn K.L. White M.R. Voelker D. R Coburn J. Zaner K. Crouch E.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Viral interactions require calcium and are specifically inhibited by monosaccharide ligands of SP-D, directly implicating the lectin activity of the SP-D carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) (11Hartshorn K.L. White M.R. Voelker D. R Coburn J. Zaner K. Crouch E.C. Biochem. J. 2000; 351: 449-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). This is consistent with crystallographic studies of recombinant trimeric neck plus carbohydrate recognition domains (NCRDs) that have demonstrated binding of the equatorial hydroxyl groups of mannoses to calcium at the lectin site (14Crouch E.

SP-D and the native serum collectins differ in their capacity to interact with respiratory viruses. For example, native bovine serum conglutinin and bovine serum CL-43 show greater binding to IAV than SP-D (17Hartshorn K.L. Holmskov U. Hansen S. Zhang P. Meschi J. Mogues T. White M.R. Crouch E.C.

Alignments of these collectins have revealed non-conservative substitutions at positions corresponding to 325 and 343 (Table 1) that are highly exposed on the opposing N-terminal and C-terminal ridges of the carbohydrate binding groove, respectively. Crystallographic studies of SP-D lectin domains have shown that neither of these residues coordinates with calcium; however, their side chains can participate in hydrogen bonds with various bound ligands (14Crouch E.

Furthermore, differing interactions with these side chains contribute to known differences in saccharide selectivity. For example, the preference of human SP-D for d-N-acetyl-mannosamine over d-mannose can be attributed to hydrogen bonding of the Asp-325 carboxyl group with the N-acetyl substituent of the sugar (15Wang H.

In addition, our previous studies have shown that residue 343 (arginine in humans or lysine in rodents and other species; Table 1) contributes to the binding of SP-D to phosphatidylinositol, the major surfactant-associated ligand (14Crouch E. McDonald B. Smith K. Roberts M. Mealy T. Seaton B. Head J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5160-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and to the inner core oligosaccharide domain of rough bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (15Wang H. Head J. Kosma P. Brade H. Müller-Loennies S. Sheikh S. McDonald B. Smith K. Cafarella T. Seaton B. Crouch E. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In fact, the greater capacity of rodent SP-D to recognize these particular ligands is largely determined by the structure of the 343 side chain (14Crouch E. McDonald B. Smith K. Roberts M. Mealy T. Seaton B. Head J. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 5160-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 15Wang H. Head J. Kosma P. Brade H. Müller-Loennies S. Sheikh S. McDonald B. Smith K. Cafarella T. Seaton B. Crouch E. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). More recently, we have shown that the substitution of Arg-343 with valine (R343V), as found in MBP or conglutinin (Table 1), substantially increases interactions with certain mannose-rich oligosaccharides, enhances viral binding and neutralization, and confers the capacity to mediate viral aggregation (21Crouch E.

Similar but less marked effects were observed when Arg-343 was substituted with isoleucine (R343I), as found in CL-43 (Table 1). In the present studies, we employed a novel surface plasmon resonance assay, viral binding and neutralization assays, mass spectrometry of HA glycans, and a new in vivo model of IAV infection to examine interactions between a recently developed combinatorial SP-D mutant and influenza A virus. The findings demonstrate the potential for collectin NCRD-based antiviral interventions.

Sequences were verified by automated sequencing of the entire coding sequence of the fusion protein. Glycerol stocks of transformed bacteria were stored in single-use aliquots at −80 °C. RosettaBlue competent cells were transformed with the wild-type or mutant construct in pET-30a(+) vector, and expressed proteins were isolated from inclusion bodies (25Crouch E. Tu Y. Briner D.

After refolding and oligomerization, the D325A/R343V and D325A fusion proteins were purified by nickel-affinity chromatography, and trimers were isolated by gel filtration chromatography on an AKTA Purifier system. The purified proteins showed the expected mobility on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1A, third and fourth lanes) with a slower migration in the presence of dithiothreitol, consistent with the formation of normal intrachain disulfide bonds, as illustrated for D325A/R343V (Fig. 1A, sixth lane). Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic (BCA) assay (Pierce) with BSA as a standard. Endotoxin levels were less than ∼3 pg/μg of protein, including preparations used for the in vivo experiments. Proteins were stored in small single-use aliquots at −80 °C. Analytical gel filtration confirmed the absence of aggregation of the purified trimers under our usual conditions of storage. Other NCRD constructs used for these experiments included R343V (21Crouch E. Hartshorn K. Horlacher T. McDonald B. Smith K. Cafarella T. Seaton B. Seeberger P.H. Head J.

The Phil82 (H3N2) strain of IAV was grown and isolated as previously described (13Hartshorn K.L. Webby R. White M.R. Tecle T. Pan C. Boucher S. Moreland R.J. Crouch E.C. Scheule R.K. Respir. Res. 2008; 9: 65Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Binding of NCRD fusion proteins to solid-phase IAV, hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assays, fluorescent focus assays of viral neutralization, and assays of viral aggregation and neutrophil uptake were performed as described in recent publications (13Hartshorn K.L.

In particular, binding of NCRD fusion protein to solid-phase viral particles was assessed using the S-protein horseradish peroxidase detection system; all assays were performed within the linear range of optical density. For some studies, findings for Phil82 were compared with SP-D resistant strains, such as Phil82BS and PR8 (H1N1) (13Hartshorn K.L. Webby R. White M.R. Tecle T. Pan C. Boucher S. Moreland R.J. Crouch E.C. Scheule R.K. Respir. Res. 2008; 9: 65Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The A/WSN/33 HAnc-Asp225Gly (H1N1) hybrid strain (hereafter designated WSNHAnc-Asp225Gly) was kindly provided by Dr. Donald Smee, Utah State University (29Smee D.F. Bailey K.W. Wong M.H. O'Keefe B.R. Gustafson K.R. Mishin V.P. Gubareva L.V. Antiviral Res. 2008; 80: 266-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). We also examined the wild-type, mouse-adapted A/WSN/33 (H1N1) strain (hereafter designated WSN). HA molecules were released from Phil82 (H3N2), Phil82BS (H3N2), and PR8 (H1N1) virions using bromelain, a protease that cleaves the stalk of the trimeric hemagglutinin near the site of membrane insertion (30Wilson I.A. Skehel J.J. Wiley D.C. Nature. 1981; 289: 366-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). The purified bromelain-solubilized HAs were examined by SDS-PAGE in the absence and presence of dithiothreitol (Fig. 1B). The unreduced Phil82 protein migrated as a single major species of ∼70 kDa relative to globular standards; after reduction, there were two species of ∼61 and 25 kDa, consistent with the HA1 with HA2 subunits, respectively. Similar results were obtained for the Phil82BS HA (data not shown). As expected, the unreduced PR8 protein (61 kDa) and the PR8 HA1 subunit (53 kDa) migrated more rapidly than the corresponding Phil82 species, consistent with the absence of glycans on the HA1 subunit of the PR8 HA. The assembly of the purified HAs was assessed by gel filtration under non-denaturing conditions using an AKTA Tricorn 10/300 GL Superose 12 column (GE Healthcare) and a series of globular standards (Bio-Rad, #151-1901) (25Crouch E.

The proteins eluted as single major peaks near the expected position of HA trimers, between thyroglobulin and γ-globulin standards (data not shown). The molecular mass was ∼250 kDa as estimated using a plot of elution volume versus log molecular weight plot, with the Phil82 or Phil82BS HA eluting very slightly earlier than the PR8 HA. Mass spectral data were acquired using an LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) interfaced with a nanoAcquity ultra performance liquid chromatograph (Waters Corp, Milford, MA) and a Triversa Nanomate robot (Advion Biosciences, Inc., Ithaca, NY). The protein (100 μg) was reduced using dithiothreitol and alkylated using iodoacetamide, desalted, and digested using trypsin using standard protocols. Using a reversed phase chromatography column (Waters BEH C18, 150 μm × 15 cm), liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry data (LC/MS) were acquired using conditions as described (31Perlman D.H.

The results were used to generate a custom data base of H3 type HA sequences for subsequent glycoproteomics analysis. An aliquot (10 μg) of the HA tryptic peptide mixture was digested with peptide N-glycosidase F (New England Biolabs, Andover, MA) in the presence of H218O and then analyzed by C18 reversed phase LC/MS as above with manual interpretations. For glycoproteomics, LC/MS was conducted using an in-house packed HILIC column (Amide-80, 3-μm beads, 250 μm × 15 cm, Tosoh Bioscience, Mongomeryville, PA) as described (32Naimy H. Buczek-Thomas J.A.

Higher energy dissociation tandem MS scans containing oxonium ions corresponding to Hex and HexHexNAc triggered subsequent electron capture dissociation tandem mass spectra. Datasets were acquired using on-line LC/tandem MS. Additional data were acquired by collecting fractions from the HILIC column and analyzing off-line using the Triversa Nanomate robot. Candidate glycopeptides were identified based on the presence of 18O-Asp from manual interpretations. Glycopeptides were identified based on the presence of oxonium ions in higher energy dissociation scans and confirmed from the presence of neutral losses corresponding to Hex, HexNAc, NeuAc, and dHex residues in the higher energy dissociation scans. The peptide sequence was determined from the electron capture dissociation scans. Only those glycopeptides producing consistent proteomics and higher energy dissociation/electron capture dissociation analyses are reported (Table 2).TABLE 2Glycosylation of Phil82 HAGlycosylation siteHexHexNAcdHexTypeRelative amount14482M1881H/C0.3–0.4821H/C<0.0579H/C0.1–0.216572M<0.0182M0.10–0.2092M0.30–0.40102M<0.0162H/C<0.0563H/C<0.0573H/C0.40–0.5083H/C193H/C<0.05 Open table in a new tab SPR assays described in this publication were performed using a SensiQ Pioneer biosensing system and HisCap (Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)) biosensors (ICx Technologies). However, certain preliminary experiments were performed using a BiaCore 2000 and the corresponding BiaCore Sensor Chip NTA (GE Healthcare). For the SensiQ, the usual configuration was to attach NCRD fusion proteins to cells 1 and/or 3, leaving cell 2 as a reference. Briefly, all cells were charged with 500 μm nickel chloride in 10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5 (HBS), resulting in a predictable change in refractive index. The trimeric hNCRDs were then coupled via their N-terminal hexahistidine tags to the desired flow cells, as recommended by the manufacturer, at a concentration of 1–10 μg/ml. For the experiments reported here protein couplings were performed in 10 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, to maximize attachment. Because all the proteins are stored at similar high concentrations in the same buffer, the coupling conditions were effectively identical. Preliminary experiments showed nearly equivalent changes in response units for equivalent amounts of several different trimeric NCRDs, indicating reproducible binding of the fusion proteins to the biosensor and confirming equivalence of the flow cells. Before the assay, the bound trimeric NCRD fusion proteins were “activated” by priming the system three times for a total 15 min with HBS containing 5 mm calcium chloride (HBS + C). The cells were then “blocked” with 0.1% fatty acid free bovine serum albumin in HBS + C, which helped minimize nonspecific binding to the reference cell. The initial rationale for calcifying the bound NCRDs was to preclude lectin-dependent binding to dextrans on the biosensor. Although this proved to be an unnecessary precaution, the approach facilitated experiments confirming the calcium-dependence of binding. Analytes such as bromelain-solubilized HAs were injected into the mobile phase at the indicated concentration (0.02–20 μg/ml) at a controlled temperature of 25 °C. Flow rates were optimized to minimize mass transport effects; 25 μl/min was used for the current studies. For some preliminary experiments, competing sugars were co-injected with the analyte to confirm specificity. However, for the experiments shown here a competing sugar was added during the dissociation and/or regeneration phase. The biosensors were routinely stripped with alternating injections of 350 mm EDTA in HBS, pH 8.0, and 1 m imidazole in deionized water. The stripped biosensors could be recharged with nickel and protein for multiple assays without deleterious effects on performance. Kinetic analyses and curve-fitting for the SensiQ were performed using Qdat (ICx Technologies). To facilitate formatting for figure preparation, data were exported to Sigmaplot (Systat Software). In vivo mortality studies were conducted with 8–12-week-old female DBA/2J mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were lightly anesthetized with isofluorane. 50 μl of WSN or WSNHAnc-Asp225Gly stock in DPBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions was co-administered via intratracheal delivery with or without 5 μg/mouse D325A/R343V NCRD or wild-type NCRD. Viral titers of the inoculate were 1 × 105 and 3.3 × 105 viral particles/ml, respectively, as assessed by real-time quantitation (APM3600, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). Mice were weighed every other day and checked daily for viral induced mortality. All animals were maintained in a specific pathogen-free facility and were handled according to an institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC)-approved protocol and National Institutes of Health guidelines. In some experiments whole lungs were harvested 5 days post-viral infection (n = 3/group). The tissue was homogenized in DPBS without Ca2+ and Mg2+ and spun at 3000 × g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and stored at −80 °C. Total RNA was isolated from infected mouse lung homogenate using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and viral RNA was purified by the Viral RNA Spin Protocol (Qiagen) and stored at −20 °C.

In this study, we found the 117-kDa UT-A1 preferentially resides in lipid rafts, suggesting that the glycosylation status may interfere with UT-A1 lipid raft trafficking. This was confirmed by a site-directed mutagenesis study in MDCK cells. The nonglycosylated UT-A1 showed reduced localization in lipid rafts. By using sugar-specific binding lectins, we further found that the UT-A1 in nonlipid rafts contained a high amount of mannose, as detected by concanavalin A, while the UT-A1 in lipid rafts was the mature N-acetylglucosamine-containing form, as detected by wheat germ agglutinin. In the inner medulla (IM) of diabetic rats, the more abundant 117-kDa UT-A1 in lipid rafts was the mature glycosylation form, with high amounts of N -acetylglucosamine and sialic acid. In contrast, in the IM of normal rats, the predominant 97-kDa UT-A1 was the form enriched in mannose. Functionally, inhibition of glycosylation by tunicamycin or elimination of the glycosylation sites by mutation significantly reduced UT-A1 activity in oocytes. Taken together, our study reveals a new role of N-linked glycosylation in regulating UT-A1 activity by promoting UT-A1 trafficking into membrane lipid raft subdomains.—Chen, G., Howe, A.

https://openalex.org/W2007548581,"Gap junctions (GJs) play an important role in the control of bladder contractile response and in the regulation of various immune inflammatory processes. Here, we investigated the possible interaction between inflammation and GJs in bladder smooth muscle cells (BSMCs). Stimulation of BSMCs with IL1β and TNFα increased connexin43 (Cx43) expression and function, which was associated with increased phosphorylation of vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein. Inhibition of PKA with H89 or down-regulation of CREB with specific siRNAs largely abolished the Cx43-elevating effect. Further analysis revealed that IL1β/TNFα induced NFκB-dependent inducible NO synthase (iNOS) expression. Inhibition of iNOS with G-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester abrogated and an exogenous NO donor mimicked the effect of the cytokines on Cx43. Intraperitoneal injection of LPS into mice also induced bladder Cx43 expression, which was largely blocked by an iNOS inhibitor. Finally, the elevated Cx43 was found to negatively regulate iNOS expression. Dysfunction of GJs with various blockers or down-regulation of Cx43 with siRNA significantly potentiated the expression of iNOS. Fibroblasts from Cx43 knock-out (Cx43−/−) mice also displayed a significantly higher response to the cytokine-induced iNOS expression than cells from Cx43 wild-type (Cx43+/+) littermates. Collectively, our study revealed a previously unrecognized reciprocal regulation loop between cytokine-induced NO and GJs.

Our findings may provide an important molecular mechanism for the symptoms of bladder infection. In addition, it may further our understanding of the roles of GJs in inflammatory diseases. Acute cystitis is a common disease afflicting millions of people each year and is usually caused by the infection of the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (1Foxman B. Brown P. Infect. Dis. Clin. North Am. 2003; 17: 227-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Patients with cystitis often complain of urinary frequency and urgency. Although the pathological basis for these symptoms is still poorly understood, it is thought to be related to the altered bladder microenvironment subsequent to the local influx of inflammatory cells and the production of inflammatory mediators (2Billips B.K.

GJs are clusters of transmembrane channels that permit the direct intercellular exchange of ions, secondary messengers, and small signaling molecules. Gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) is thought to play an important role in the control of a variety of cellular functions, including cell growth, migration, differentiation, and electric coupling (8Saez J.C.

Renal Physiol. 2009; 296: F939-F946Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). GJs are formed by a family of special proteins termed connexins (Cx). To date, more than 20 different isoforms of Cx molecules have been identified. Among them, connexin 43 (Cx43) has been extensively investigated because of its ubiquitous expression in most cell types. Bladder smooth muscle cells (BSMCs) highly express Cx43 (10Neuhaus J. Weimann A. Stolzenburg J.U. Wolburg H. Horn L.C. Dorschner W. World J. Urol. 2002; 20: 250-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In the normal bladder, Cx43-forming channels provide a pathway for the transmission and propagation of electrical signals, thus contributing to the coordinated contraction and relaxation responses required for normal bladder emptying and filling (5Christ G.J.

In overactive bladder, Cx43 is abnormally up-regulated and has been shown to be implicated in the enhanced modular autonomous activity and detrusor overactivity (11Drake M.J. Hedlund P. Harvey I.J.

In this context, it is likely that the symptoms of bladder infection might also be related to the altered GJs in the bladder. As the first step toward demonstrating this, we examined the changes of GJs during bladder inflammation. gap junctions connexin43 gap junctional intercellular communication vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein inducible NO synthase bladder smooth muscle cells G-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester rhodamine-dextran S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine scrape-loading dye transfer assay lucifer yellow tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate cAMP-response element-binding protein α-glycyrrhetinic acid. GJs are known to be critically involved in various immune inflammatory situations. On the one hand, they participate in the regulation of almost every step of the inflammatory response, including antigen presentation, chemokine and cytokine production, inflammatory cell migration, adhesion, and activation (12Eugenín E.A.

However, this possibility has not yet been addressed. Another purpose of this study was to test this hypothesis. Here, we present our evidence showing the existence of an NO-centered regulatory loop between inflammatory cytokines and GJs. Our findings thus provide potentially important insights into the molecular mechanisms of GJs in inflammatory disorders. IL1β and TNFα were purchased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). SC514 and anti-iNOS antibodies were obtained from Cayman Chemical Co. Anti-vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (anti-VASP) at serine 157 was obtained from Chemicon International (Temecula, CA). FBS, trypsin/EDTA, antibiotics, LPS, G-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME), 18 α-glycyrrhetinic acid (α-GA), lindane, heptanol, lucifer yellow (LY), rhodamine-dextran (RD), anti-Cx43, and anti-β-actin antibodies, as well as all other chemicals, were obtained from Sigma. BSMCs were established from the bladder of female Sprague-Dawley rats as described previously (24Sawada N. Yao J. Hiramatsu N. Hayakawa K. Araki I. Takeda M. Kitamura M. Lab. Invest. 2008; 88: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). For maintenance, the cells were cultured in DMEM/F-12 containing 10% FBS. For experiments, they were cultured in DMEM/F-12 containing 1% FBS with or without the indicated stimulants. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were derived from the fetal offspring of mating pairs of heterozygous Cx43 knock-out mice (B6, 129-Gjal<tm 1 Kdr+/−; The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME), using a method described by Ehlich et al. (25Ehrlich H.P. Gabbiani G. Meda P. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (26Fang X. Huang T. Zhu Y. Yan Q. Chi Y. Jiang J.X. Wang P.

Briefly, both mouse forelimbs were taken from fetuses at day 18 of gestation, minced, and digested in DMEM/F-12 containing 0.1% collagenase for 30 min. Freed cells were collected and cultured in DMEM/F-12 medium containing 15% FBS. Cells at passages 5–15 were used for this study. Genotypes of individual mice were determined by PCR. Adult female C57BL/6J mice weighing 25–30 g were purchased from Japan SLC, Inc. (Hamamatsu, Japan). All animal experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Experimental Committee of Yamanashi University. Mice were housed in containment facilities of the Animal Center and maintained on a regular 12:12-h light/dark cycle with food and water. Western blot was performed using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (22Yao J. Hiramatsu N. Zhu Y. Morioka T. Takeda M. Oite T. Kitamura M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23Yao J. Kitamura M. Zhu Y. Meng Y. Kasai A. Hiramatsu N. Morioka T. Takeda M. Oite T. Am. J. Physiol.

Briefly, equal amounts of extracted cellular proteins were separated by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking with 3% BSA in PBS, the membranes were incubated with primary antibody. After washing with PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, filters were probed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit IgG or rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Cell Signaling; Beverly, MA). Immunoreactivity was detected by an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). The chemiluminescent signal was captured with a Fujifilm luminescent image LAS-4000 analyzer (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). To confirm equal loading per lane, membranes were treated with 2% SDS and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) for 30 min at 60 °C and reprobed for β-actin (dilution 1:30,000; Sigma). Data shown are representative of at least three independent experiments with similar results. BSMCs were treated with various agents for 12 h. Equal amounts of RNA (5 μg) extracted from cells were separated by electrophoresis and transferred onto nylon membranes (Hybond N+; Amersham Biosciences). The level of Cx43 mRNA was examined as described previously using the entire coding sequence of the rat Cx43 cDNA as a probe (provided by Drs. G. Olbina and W. Eckhart, Molecular and Cell Biology Laboratory, The Salk Institute for Biologic Studies, San Diego). The staining of 28 S and 18 S ribosomal RNA by ethidium bromide was used as a loading control (22Yao J. Hiramatsu N. Zhu Y. Morioka T. Takeda M. Oite T. Kitamura M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23Yao J. Kitamura M. Zhu Y. Meng Y. Kasai A. Hiramatsu N. Morioka T. Takeda M. Oite T. Am. J. Physiol.

Cells were transiently transfected with siRNA specifically targeting CREB (Hs_CREBBP_2 FlexiTube siRNA, Qiagen, Japan), Cx43 (Mm_Gja 1_2 HP siRNA, Qiagen, Japan), or a negative control siRNA (AllStars Negative Control siRNA) at a final concentration of 20 nm using Hyperfect transfection reagent for 24 h. After transfection, cells were left untreated or exposed to IL1β/TNFα for the indicated time. Cellular protein was extracted and subjected to Western blot analysis of the targeted proteins (Cx43, iNOS, and CREB). Immunocytochemical staining for Cx43 was performed as reported previously (22Yao J. Hiramatsu N. Zhu Y. Morioka T. Takeda M. Oite T. Kitamura M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23Yao J. Kitamura M. Zhu Y. Meng Y. Kasai A. Hiramatsu N. Morioka T. Takeda M. Oite T. Am. J. Physiol.

In brief, cultured BSMCs were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min and permeabilized with 1% Triton X-100 before staining. The cells were incubated overnight with anti-Cx43 antibody (diluted 1:200 in 1% FBS in PBS; 4 °C). After rinsing with PBS, the appropriate secondary antibody (diluted in 1% FBS in PBS; 37 °C) was added for 2 h before final washing. The slides and sections were covered with Tris-buffered moviol (pH 8.6), and microscopy was performed with an Olympus BX50 microscope with a 40× Planapo and 570-nm emission filter. Immunofluorescent images were captured using a CCD camera attached to the microscope. Bladder cryosections of about 6 μm thickness were routinely rehydrated in PBS (pH 7.4) and stained for Cx43 and phalloidin. The secondary antibody for Cx43 was Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-rabbit IgG. Briefly, the serial sections were treated with 1% hydrogen peroxide in PBS to inhibit enzyme activity of endogenous peroxidase and additionally incubated in 10% BSA. They were then incubated in primary antibodies at 4 °C overnight and corresponding secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1 h. All immunostained sections were embedded in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and observed on a confocal laser-scanning microscope (FV1000; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The SLDT assay was used to assess GJIC (27Huang T. Zhu Y. Fang X. Chi Y. Kitamura M. Yao J. Cancer Sci. 2010; 101: 713-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cells were exposed to culture medium containing 0.1% LY and 0.05% RD. A scrape line on the monolayer was made with a surgical blade. After washing out background fluorescence, the cells were fixed, and dye transfer results were examined using an Olympus BX50 microscope with a 40× Planapo and FITC (green) or TRITC (red) filter. Immunofluorescence was photographed using a CCD camera attached to the microscope. The distances of LY diffusion from the scrape line were counted for statistical analysis. Because of its large size (10,000 Da), the RD cannot pass through GJs and was used as marker of the scratch-loaded cells. GJIC was evaluated by comparing the diffusion of the LY to the nondiffusable RD. NO released into the culture medium was measured by evaluating nitrite accumulation using Griess reagent (29Green L.C.

Briefly, 100 μl of conditioned medium was mixed with an equal amount of Griess reagent (a solution containing 1% sulfanilamide, 0.1% naphthylethylenediamine in 2 m HCl) and allowed to stand at room temperature for 10 min. The absorbance at 550 nm was then measured using a microtiter plate reader. Nitrite levels were expressed in nanomoles of NO2/μg of total cellular protein. Values are expressed as means ± S.D. Comparisons of two populations were made using Student's t test. For multiple comparisons with a single control, one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's test was employed. Both analyses were carried out using SigmaStat statistical software (Jandel Scientific). p < 0.05 was considered to be a statistically significant difference. To test whether bladder inflammation could affect GJs, we examined Cx43 protein levels after incubation of BSMCs with the major proinflammatory cytokines IL1β and TNFα. As shown in Fig. 1, A–D, IL1β or TNFα alone caused a moderate increase in Cx43 protein and mRNA levels, while in combination, they exerted a significantly more potent effect. Therefore, the combined stimulation was used for all of the following experiments. In Western blots, Cx43 protein was detected as three bands (P0, P1, P2; Fig. 1A), corresponding to the nonphosphorylated (P0), phosphorylated (P1), and hyperphosphorylated forms (P2), respectively. IL1β and TNFα induced the native (P0) and phosphorylated forms of Cx43 protein. Time course analysis revealed that the effects of IL1β/TNFα on Cx43 were time-dependent (Fig. 1E). The increased Cx43 levels could be detected 6 h after the stimulation and persisted for at least 48 h. The elevating effect of IL1β/TNFα on Cx43 expression was confirmed by immunofluorescence staining. Treatment of BSMCs with IL1β/TNFα markedly increased the size and intensity of the punctate Cx43 staining. Normally, Cx43 was mainly localized in the perinuclear region. In the presence of the cytokines, more Cx43 was detected at the region of cell-to-cell contacts (Fig. 1F). Consistent with the increased localization of Cx43 at the cellular membrane, the GJIC was also increased as evaluated by the SLDT assay. As shown in the Fig. 1, G and H, the distance of LY diffusion (green) from the scrape line in IL1β/TNFα-treated cells was significantly further than that in control cells. Because of the large size, RD (Fig. 1, G and H, red) could not pass through GJs and served as an indicator of the scratch-loaded cells. The merged images are also shown, in which colocalization of LY (Fig. 1, G and H, green) and RD (red) yields yellow. These results indicate that proinflammatory cytokines increase Cx43 expression and promote GJIC in BSMCs. Because cAMP is a well characterized second messenger in the induction of Cx43 and promotion of GJIC (22Yao J. Hiramatsu N. Zhu Y. Morioka T. Takeda M. Oite T. Kitamura M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 31Dowling-Warriner C.V. Trosko J.E. Neuroscience. 2000; 95: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 32Paulson A.F.

Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 3037-3049Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), one possible mechanism underlying the effect of IL1β/TNFα could be the activation of this pathway. Indeed, exposure of BSMCs to IL1β/TNFα caused a time-dependent increase in the phosphorylation of VASP at serine 157 (Fig. 2A), a validated substrate of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, indicating the activation of PKA (33Butt E. Abel K. Krieger M. Palm D. Hoppe V. Hoppe J. Walter U. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14509-14517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the inhibition of PKA with the PKA inhibitor H89 largely suppressed the cytokine-induced phosphorylation of VASP and Cx43 (Fig. 2, B–D). Consistent with the above finding, H89 also inhibited GJIC, as revealed by the reduction in LY diffusion (Fig. 2E and supplemental Fig. 1A). Activated PKA subsequently phosphorylates CREB, leading to the activation of genes that have cAMP-response element-binding sites. Because there are cAMP-response element sites in the Cx43 gene (8Saez J.C. Berthoud V.M. Branes M.C. Martinez A.D. Beyer E.C. Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 1359-1400Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar, 22Yao J. Hiramatsu N. Zhu Y. Morioka T. Takeda M. Oite T. Kitamura M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), we evaluated their involvement by using CREB siRNA. As shown in Fig. 2, F–H, treatment of BSMCs with the siRNA effectively down-regulated the protein levels of cAMP-response element and concomitantly abolished the increase in Cx43. Therefore, these results indicate that the cAMP signaling pathway mediates the cytokine-induced up-regulation of Cx43. NFκB plays a pivotal role in the cellular inflammatory response (34Wang X.C. Saban R. Kaysen J.H. Saban M.R. Allen P.L. Benes E.N. Hammond T.G. J. Urol. 2000; 163: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the possible involvement of NFκB in the Cx43-elevating effect of the cytokines. As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, the inhibition of NFκB with SC514 (50 μm) largely blocked the effect of the cytokines on Cx43 expression (relative levels of Cx43, IL1β/TNFα, 2.69 ± 0.10; IL1β/TNFα + SC514, 1.31 ± 0.14; mean ± S.D.; n = 3). The enhanced GJIC was also suppressed by SC-514 (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. 1A). These results indicate that the effect of IL1β/TNFα on Cx43 occurs through the activation of NFκB. Among NFκB-regulated gene products, iNOS has been reported to elevate Cx43 expression and function through the cAMP signaling pathway (22Yao J. Hiramatsu N. Zhu Y. Morioka T. Takeda M. Oite T. Kitamura M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 35Civitelli R. Ziambaras K. Warlow P.M. Lecanda F. Nelson T. Harley J. Atal N. Beyer E.C. Steinberg T.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 68: 8-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the possible involvement of NO. Consistent with the cooperative effects of the cytokines on Cx43, IL1β and TNFα also synergistically elicited iNOS expression (Fig. 4A). In addition, iNOS expression was under the control of NFκB. Inhibition of NFκB with SC-514 completely abrogated iNOS expression (Fig. 4, B and C). To further establish the role of NO, we examined the effects of interrupting NO generation and action on the expression of Cx43. As shown in Fig. 5, A and B, the iNOS inhibitor l-NAME, NO scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (36Jimenez-Feltstrom J. Lundquist I. Salehi A. Cell Tissue Res. 2005; 319: 221-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and sGC inhibitor oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one all significantly blocked the effects of IL1β/TNFα. Diphenyleneiodonium, a broad spectrum flavoprotein inhibitor whose targets also include nitric-oxide synthase (37Stuehr D.J. Fasehun O.A. Kwon N.S. Gross S.S. Gonzalez J.A. Levi R. Nathan C.F. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 38Wu F. Tyml K. Wilson J.X. J. Cell. Physiol. 2008; 217: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), also significantly inhibited the Cx43-elevating effect. In addition, iNOS inhibitor l-NAME also significantly suppressed the GJIC, as evaluated by SLDT (Fig. 5C and supplemental Fig. 1A). Contrary to the suppressive effects of these inhibitors, the exogenous NO donor SNAP elevated VASP phosphorylation and Cx43 expression in a time-dependent manner, which was associated with an increased GJIC (Fig. 5, D and E, and supplemental Fig. 1B). These results indicate an involvement of NFκB-regulated iNOS in the cytokine-induced up-regulation of Cx43. To test whether bladder infection and inflammation alter GJs in vivo, we examined the levels of mouse bladder Cx43 after intraperitoneal injection of LPS. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, LPS induced a time- and dosage-dependent increase in Cx43 protein levels, together with enhanced expression of iNOS. Inhibition of iNOS with l-NAME also significantly blunted the elevation of Cx43 in vivo (Fig. 6, C and D). Consistent with the elevated Cx43 protein levels, immunofluorescent analysis revealed an increased number of punctate Cx43 in the outer layer and smooth muscle layer of the bladder from LPS-treated mice (Fig. 6, E and F). These in vivo results indicate that NO mediates inflammation-triggered up-regulation of Cx43. GJs have been implicated in the regulation of various inflammatory responses (12Eugenín E.A. Brañes M.C. Berman J.W. Sáez J.C. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 1320-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 15Neijssen J. Herberts C. Drijfhout J.W. Reits E. Janssen L. Neefjes J.

Invest. 2006; 116: 2193-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether the NO-mediated increase of Cx43 could reciprocally affect iNOS expression and NO production. To this end, we examined the change of iNOS and NO after GJ dysfunction caused by three structurally different GJ blockers. As shown in Fig. 7, GJ blockers α-GA, lindane, and heptanol all significantly potentiated the cytokine-triggered expression of iNOS and production of NO. This observation thus suggests that GJs negatively regulate iNOS expression under inflammatory conditions. To further establish the role of Cx43-forming channels in the regulation of iNOS, we have compared the cytokine-induced iNOS expression between fibroblasts derived from Cx43 wild-type (Cx43+/+) and knock-out (Cx43−/−) littermates. In previous reports, we and others have described that Cx43+/+ fibroblasts expressed abundant Cx43 protein and were functionally coupled by GJs, whereas Cx43−/− fibroblasts had neither Cx43 nor functional GJIC (25Ehrlich H.P. Gabbiani G. Meda P. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 184: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Fang X. Huang T. Zhu Y. Yan Q. Chi Y. Jiang J.X. Wang P. Matsue H. Kitamura M. Yao J. Antioxid.

Pharmacol. 2010; 160: 2055-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). First, we confirmed our findings in Cx43+/+ fibroblasts. As shown in Fig. 8A, IL1β/TNFα also increased Cx43 expression in fibroblasts. This effect of the cytokines was similarly associated with a parallel increase in the protein levels of iNOS and phosphorylated VASP. In addition, dysfunction of Cx43-forming channels in these cells also influenced the cytokine-elicited expression of iNOS. As shown in Fig. 8, B and C, treatment of Cx43+/+ fibroblasts with GJ blockers or specific siRNA amplified the effect of the cytokines on iNOS expression. The effectiveness of Cx43 siRNA in the down-regulation of Cx43 protein levels is shown in Fig. 8C, middle panel. Finally, we compared the iNOS expression and NO production between Cx43+/+ and Cx43−/− fibroblasts. Consistent with the above results, IL1β/TNFα induced a significantly higher level of iNOS and NO in Cx43−/− than Cx43+/+ fibroblasts (Fig. 8, D–F). Collectively, these results indicate that Cx43-forming channels negatively regulate cytokine-induced iNOS expression. In this study, we showed for the first time that the proinflammatory mediators (IL1β, TNFα, and LPS) potently increased Cx43 expression and function in BSMCs. In addition, we established Cx43-forming channels as a negative feedback mechanism in the control of iNOS expression. The major findings and signaling mechanisms involved are schematically depicted in Fig. 9. We have chosen the bladder and cultured BSMCs as a model system for this investigation because the presence of GJs in the bladder and their roles in the regulation of bladder contractility have been well documented. In addition, bladder infection is a common disease. Unraveling the interactive regulation between inflammation and GJs in the bladder could have important clinical and scientific implications. Exposure of the bladder to LPS markedly elevated Cx43 expression. This effect was similarly achieved by IL1β and TNFα in cultured BSMCs. These observations indicate that bladder infection and inflammation alter GJs in BSMCs. Most of the cellular inflammatory responses are known to be governed by the transcription factor NFκB (34Wang X.C. Saban R. Kaysen J.H. Saban M.R. Allen P.L. Benes E.N. Hammond T.G. J. Urol. 2000; 163: 993-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It was also true for the cytokine-induced expression of Cx43, as shown in this study. Inhibition of NFκB with SC514 completely abolished the increase in Cx43 expression. Several previous papers described the presence of an NFκB-binding site in the promoter region of the Cx43 gene (39Alonso F. Krattinger N. Mazzolai L. Simon A. Waeber G. Meda P. Haefliger J.A. Cardiovasc. Res. 2010; 87: 166-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 40Zhao Y. Rivieccio M.A. Lutz S. Scemes E. Brosnan C.F. Glia. 2006; 54: 775-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the functional role of this site has not been firmly established. In this study, the NFκB-mediated regulation of Cx43 was due to the NFκB-controlled gene products. This notion is supported by the observation that the inhibition of NFκB or the NFκB-regulated gene product iNOS significantly abrogated the Cx43-elevating effects. The induction of iNOS under inflammatory situations and the implication of NO in the up-regulation of Cx43 have been previously documented (22Yao J. Hiramatsu N. Zhu Y. Morioka T. Takeda M. Oite T. Kitamura M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2005; 16: 58-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 35Civitelli R. Ziambaras K. Warlow P.M. Lecanda F. Nelson T. Harley J. Atal N. Beyer E.C. Steinberg T.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 68: 8-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Therefore, an involvement of iNOS in elevating Cx43 expression under inflammatory situations is not surprising. The evidence supporting the mediating role of NO also includes that the following. 1) iNOS was under the control of NFκB in BSMCs. 2) The level of iNOS induced by IL1β/TNFα was in parallel to their potency in inducing Cx43 expression. 3) The inhibition of iNOS significantly attenuated the effect of the cytokines. 4) The exogenous NO donor SNAP similarly induced the phosphorylation of VASP and Cx43. In addition to BSMCs, IL1β/TNFα also elevated Cx43 protein levels in glomerular mesangial cells, renal tubular epithelial cells (data not shown), and fetal forearm fibroblasts. In addition, Cx43 in the bladder epithelial cells was also induced by intraperitoneal injection of LPS. Interestingly, the combined stimulation of DCs and macrophages with LPS, TNFα, and IFN-γ also increased Cx43 expression in these cells (12Eugenín E.A. Brañes M.C. Berman J.W. Sáez J.C. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 1320-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 41Fernandez-Cobo M. Gingalewski C. De Maio A. Shock. 1998; 10: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It is possible that similar regulatory mechanisms operate in these cells. Of note, in contrast to our results, there are also reports documenting a suppressive effect of proinflammatory mediators (LPS, TNFα, and NO) on GJs (42Liao C.K. Wang S.M. Chen Y.L. Wang H.S. Wu J.C. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2010; 42: 762-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 43Simon A.M. McWhorter A.R. Chen H. Jackson C.L. Ouellette Y. J. Vasc. Res. 2004; 41: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The reasons for this discrepancy are presently unclear. It could be due to the different cell types and experimental settings used for the investigation. More detailed analysis to account for the difference may be needed in the future. The increased Cx43 expression by NO could contribute to the altered sensitivity of bladder detrusor to stimuli. In a recent report, E. coli-induced bladder inflammation was associated with an increased bladder contractile response, which was mediated by the NO-induced activation of PKC (44Weng T.I. Wu H.Y. Lin P.Y. Liu S.H. Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 3312-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Given that GJs are required for the coordinated contractile response (45Yao J. Morioka T. Li B. Oite T. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 2018-2026Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), the elevation of Cx43 by NO in BSMCs could exaggerate the abnormal bladder contractile response under inflammatory situations. There is growing evidence indicating a critical involvement of GJs in immune inflammatory processes. Depending on the cell types, isoforms of Cxs and employed stimuli, GJs could either promote or suppress the inflammatory responses (20Parthasarathi K. Ichimura H. Monma E. Lindert J. Quadri S. Issekutz A. Bhattacharya J. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 2193-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 46Kielian T. J.

Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 5193-5203Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). For example, in DC cells, we have demonstrated that GJs contribute to their activation and production of inflammatory mediators (14Matsue H. Yao J. Matsue K. Nagasaka A. Sugiyama H. Aoki R. Kitamura M. Shimada S. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 181-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In contrast, Cx32 in endothelial cells has been recently documented to suppress TNFα-induced production of IL-6 and MCP-1 (48Okamoto T. Akiyama M. Takeda M. Akita N. Yoshida K. Hayashi T. Suzuki K. Exp. Cell Res. 2011; 317: 348-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Here, we established Cx43-forming channels as a negative feedback mechanism for cytokine-induced iNOS expression. Currently, the molecules and signaling mechanisms involved in the regulatory effects of GJs on iNOS are still unclear. GJs are known to regulate cell functions through GJIC-dependent or -independent actions. The suppressive effect of GJs on iNOS could be related to the increased intercellular communication because the GJ inhibitor heptanol that disrupts GJIC by decreasing membrane fluidity without affecting Cx43 (49Cronier L. Frendo J.L. Defamie N. Pidoux G. Bertin G. Guibourdenche J. Pointis G. Malassine A. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 69: 1472-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 50Takens-Kwak B.R. Jongsma H.J. Rook M.B. Van Ginneken A.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: C1531-C1538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) also significantly potentiated the cytokine-induced iNOS expression. The molecules transmitted by GJs remain to be characterized. The NO-centered regulatory loop between inflammation and GJs, as revealed in this study, might provide a molecular link between intercellular and paracrine pathways under inflammatory situations, which may have an important impact on the initiation and development of inflammatory disorders. Collectively, we established a reciprocal regulation loop between iNOS and GJs in BSMCs. Our findings thus provide a potentially important molecular mechanism for urgency symptoms of bladder infection. In addition, it may open a new window toward our understanding of the role of GJs in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders. Download .pdf (.15 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2075671963,"Painful peripheral neuropathy is a significant clinical problem; however, its pathological mechanism and effective treatments remain elusive. Increased peripheral expression of tetrodotoxin-resistant voltage-gated sodium channel 1.8 (NaV1.8) has been shown to associate with chronic pain symptoms in humans and experimental animals. Sciatic nerve entrapment (SNE) injury was used to develop neuropathic pain symptoms in rats, resulting in increased NaV1.8 mRNA in the injured nerve but not in dorsal root ganglia (DRG). To study the role of NaV1.8 mRNA in the pathogenesis of SNE-induced painful neuropathy, NaV1.8 shRNA vector was delivered by subcutaneous injection of cationized gelatin/plasmid DNA polyplex into the rat hindpaw and its subsequent retrograde transport via sciatic nerve to DRG. This in vivo NaV1.8 shRNA treatment reversibly and repeatedly attenuated the SNE-induced pain symptoms, an effect that became apparent following a distinct lag period of 3-4 days and lasted for 4-6 days before returning to pretreatment levels. Surprisingly, apparent knockdown of NaV1.8 mRNA occurred only in the injured nerve, not in the DRG, during the pain alleviation period. Levels of heteronuclear NaV1.8 RNA were unaffected by SNE or shRNA treatments, suggesting that transcription of the Scn10a gene encoding NaV1.8 was unchanged. Based on these data, we postulate that increased axonal mRNA transport results in accumulation of functional NaV1.8 protein in the injured nerve and the development of painful neuropathy symptoms. Thus, targeted delivery of agents that interfere with axonal NaV1.8 mRNA may represent effective neuropathic pain treatments."

Ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT) was identified as a specific acyl-transferase for ghrelin, and recent genetic deletion studies of the Goat gene (Goat(-/-)) uncovered the role of ghrelin in the regulation of glucose homeostasis. To further understand the physiological functions of the GOAT/ghrelin system, we have conducted a metabolomic and microarray profile of Goat-null mice, as well as determined Goat expression in different tissues using the lacZ reporter gene. Serum metabolite profile analysis revealed that Goat(-/-) mice exhibited increased secondary bile acids >2.5-fold. This was attributed to increased mRNA and protein expression of the ileal sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ISBT) in the intestinal and biliary tract. Increased expression of additional solute carrier proteins, including Slc5a12 (>10-fold) were also detected in the small intestine and bile duct. Goat staining was consistently observed in the pituitary glands, stomach, and intestines, and to a lesser extent in the gallbladder and pancreatic duct. This is the first report that the GOAT/ghrelin system regulates bile acid metabolism, and these findings suggest a novel function of GOAT in the regulation of intestinal bile acid reabsorption.."
https://openalex.org/W1984934383,"Cells from multiple origins contribute to vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) development. Phenotypic heterogeneity of VSMCs is associated with their point of developmental origin; however, the mechanisms driving such differences are unknown. We here examined the mechanisms controlling vascular bed-specific differences in Rgs5 expression during development. Rgs5 levels were similar across different regions of the vasculature in neonatal animals but were >15-fold higher in descending aortas compared with carotid arteries of adult mice. Thus, vessel bed-specific changes in regulation of Rgs5 expression occurred during vessel maturation. Examination of adult Rgs5-LacZ reporter mice revealed lower Rgs5 expression in VSMCs originating from the third (carotid artery) branchial arch compared with those originating in the fourth and sixth (aortic B segment, right subclavian, and ductus arteriosus) branchial arches. Indeed, a mosaic Rgs5 expression pattern, with discreet LacZ boundaries between VSMCs derived from different developmental origins, was observed. Furthermore, Rgs5-LacZ expression was correlated with the site of VSMC origin (splanchic mesoderm ≈ local mesenchyme > somites > proepicardium > mesothelium). Surprisingly, Rgs5 reporter activity in cultured carotid artery- and descending aorta-derived cells did not recapitulate the differences observed in vivo. Consistent with a developmental origin-specific epigenetic mechanism driving the observed expression differences in vivo, the Rgs5 promoter showed increased methylation on CpG dinucleotides in carotid arteries compared with that in descending aortas in adult but not in neonatal mice. In vitro methylation of the Rgs5 promoter confirmed that its activity is sensitive to transcriptional down-regulation by CpG methylation. These data suggest that an origin-dependent epigenetic program regulates vascular bed- and maturation state-dependent regulation of VSMC-specific gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1982302280,"β(2)-Glycoprotein I (β(2)GPI) is an abundant plasma protein that binds to the surface of cells and particles expressing negatively charged lipids, but its physiological role remains unknown. Antibodies to β(2)GPI are found in patients with anti-phospholipid syndrome, a systemic autoimmune disease associated with vascular thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity. Although it has been suggested that anti-β(2)GPI antibodies activate endothelial cells and monocytes by signaling through TLR4, it is unclear how anti-β(2)GPI antibodies and/or β(2)GPI interact with TLR4. A number of mammalian proteins (termed ""endogenous Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands"") have been reported to bind to TLR4, but, in most cases, subsequent studies have shown that LPS interaction with these proteins is responsible for TLR activation. We hypothesized that, like other endogenous TLR ligands, β(2)GPI interacts specifically with LPS and that this interaction is responsible for apparent TLR4 activation by β(2)GPI. Here, we show that both LPS and TLR4 are required for β(2)GPI to bind to and activate macrophages. Untreated β(2)GPI stimulated TNF-α production in TLR4-sufficient (but not TLR4-deficient) macrophages. In contrast, neither polymyxin B-treated nor delipidated β(2)GPI stimulated TNF-α production. Furthermore, β(2)GPI bound to LPS in a specific and dose-dependent manner. Finally, untreated β(2)GPI bound to the surface of TLR4-sufficient (but not TLR4-deficient) macrophages. Polymyxin B treatment of β(2)GPI abolished macrophage binding. Our findings suggest a potential new biological activity for β(2)GPI as a protein that interacts specifically with LPS and point to the need to evaluate newly discovered endogenous TLR ligands for potential interactions with LPS."
https://openalex.org/W2108466569,"Myristoylation, the addition of a 14-carbon fatty acid to the N-terminal glycine of a protein, is key to protein-membrane and protein-protein interactions. Typically, myristoylation occurs cotranslationally; however, post-translational myristoylation of caspase-cleaved proteins is now emerging as a well-established protein modification and as a novel regulator of apoptosis. To identify additional post-translationally myristoylated proteins, we engineered a plasmid vector encoding for a caspasecleavable reporter protein named tandem reporter assay for myristoylation of proteins post-translationally (TRAMPP). pTRAMPP consists of tdTomato-DEVD-“test myristoylation sequence”-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). After induction of apoptosis, the reporter protein is cleaved by caspases, which frees a new N-terminal glycine residue attached to EGFP that can be myristoylated. We used pTRAMPP in appropriately transfected cells to identify 7 post-translationally myristoylated proteins. First, we confirmed the post-translational myristoylation of two previously identified putative substrates, cytoplasmic dynein intermediate chain 2A and PKC∊ (ctPKC∊), and identified 5 more caspase-cleaved potential substrates for myristoylation that include the antiapoptotic regulator of apoptosis, Mcl-1, and the causative agent of Huntington's disease, huntingtin protein. Further investigation revealed that post-translationally myristoylated ctPKC∊ localized to membranes and increased Erk signaling and degradation of the proapoptotic protein Bim, which prevented a significant loss of mitochondrial potential of 17% over nonmyristoylated ctPKC∊ in HeLa cells in the presence of apoptotic stimuli. Taken together, these findings suggest a possible antiapoptotic role for post-translationally myristoylated caspase-cleaved ctPKC∊.Martin, D. D. O., Ahpin, C. Y., Heit, R. J., Perinpanayagam, M.

Eosinophil physiology is critically dependent on IL-5 and the IL-5 receptor (IL-5R), composed of a ligand binding α chain (IL-5Rα), and a common β chain, βc. Previously, we demonstrated that the βc cytoplasmic tail is ubiquitinated and degraded by proteasomes following IL-5 stimulation. However, a complete understanding of the role of βc ubiquitination in IL-5R biology is currently lacking. By using a well established, stably transduced HEK293 cell model system, we show here that in the absence of ubiquitination, βc subcellular localization, IL-5-induced endocytosis, turnover, and IL-5R signaling were significantly impaired. Whereas ubiquitinated IL-5Rs internalized into trafficking endosomes for their degradation, ubiquitination-deficient IL-5Rs accumulated on the cell surface and displayed blunted signaling even after IL-5 stimulation. Importantly, we identified a cluster of three membrane-proximal βc lysine residues (Lys457, Lys461, and Lys467) whose presence was required for both JAK1/2 binding to βc and receptor ubiquitination. These findings establish that JAK kinase binding to βc requires the presence of three critical βc lysine residues, and this binding event is essential for receptor ubiquitination, endocytosis, and signaling.

https://openalex.org/W2161392188,"We have created a Drosophila model of lysozyme amyloidosis to investigate the in vivo behavior of disease-associated variants. To achieve this objective, wild-type (WT) protein and the amyloidogenic variants F57I and D67H were expressed in Drosophila melanogaster using the UAS-gal4 system and both the ubiquitous and retinal expression drivers Act5C-gal4 and gmr-gal4. The nontransgenic w1118 Drosophila line was used as a control throughout. We utilized ELISA experiments to probe lysozyme protein levels, scanning electron microscopy for eye phenotype classification, and immunohistochemistry to detect the unfolded protein response (UPR) activation. We observed that expressing the destabilized F57I and D67H lysozymes triggers UPR activation, resulting in degradation of these variants, whereas the WT lysozyme is secreted into the fly hemolymph. Indeed, the level of WT was up to 17 times more abundant than the variant proteins. In addition, the F57I variant gave rise to a significant disruption of the eye development, and this correlated to pronounced UPR activation. These results support the concept that the onset of familial amyloid disease is linked to an inability of the UPR to degrade completely the amyloidogenic lysozymes prior to secretion, resulting in secretion of these destabilized variants, thereby leading to deposition and associated organ damage.—Kumita, J.

https://openalex.org/W2037133024,"The aim of this study was to develop a simple and effective method for noninvasively detecting fetal sex using circulating fetal DNA from first-trimester maternal plasma. A study was conducted with maternal plasma collected from 203 women between 5 and 12 wk of gestation. The presence of circulating fetal DNA was confirmed by a quantitative methylationspecific polymerase chain reaction of the unmethyla-ted-PDE9A gene (U-PDE9A). Multiplex real-time PCR was used to simultaneously quantify the amount of DYS14 and GAPDH in maternal plasma. The results were confirmed by phenotype at birth. Pregnancy outcomes and U-PDE9A concentrations were obtained in all cases, including 99 male-bearing and 104 female-bearing participants. At equivalent specificity (100%), the false-negative rate was 9.1% for DYS14 quantification cycle, 7.1% for DYS14 concentration, and 0.0% for the concentration ratio of DYS14/GAPDH, respectively. In male-bearing participants, DYS14, U-PDE9A, and GAPDH concentrations were significantly lower in the false-negative case than in correct case (P< 0.001 in all). Moreover, DYS14, U-PDE9A, and GAPDH concentrations showed significantly positive associations with each other (P≤0.001 in all). The ratio of DYS14/ GAPDH in maternal plasma was an effective biomarker for noninvasive fetal sex detection during the first trimester, indicating that it could be useful for clinical application.—Lim, J.

https://openalex.org/W2039118131,"Four distinct aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) found in some cyanobacterial species contain a novel protein domain that bears two putative transmembrane helices. This CAAD domain is present in glutamyl-, isoleucyl-, leucyl-, and valyl-tRNA synthetases, the latter of which has probably recruited the domain more than once during evolution. Deleting the CAAD domain from the valyl-tRNA synthetase of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 did not significantly modify the catalytic properties of this enzyme, suggesting that it does not participate in its canonical tRNA-charging function. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the function of the CAAD domain is structural, mediating the membrane anchorage of the enzyme, although membrane localization of aaRSs has not previously been described in any living organism. Synthetases containing the CAAD domain were localized in the intracytoplasmic thylakoid membranes of cyanobacteria and were largely absent from the plasma membrane. The CAAD domain was necessary and apparently sufficient for protein targeting to membranes. Moreover, localization of aaRSs in thylakoids was important under nitrogen limiting conditions. In Anabaena, a multicellular filamentous cyanobacterium often used as a model for prokaryotic cell differentiation, valyl-tRNA synthetase underwent subcellular relocation at the cell poles during heterocyst differentiation, a process also dependent on the CAAD domain."
https://openalex.org/W1986592782,"SsfX3 is a GDSL family acyltransferase that transfers salicylate to the C-4 hydroxyl of a tetracycline intermediate in the penultimate step during biosynthesis of the anticancer natural product SF2575. The C-4 salicylate takes the place of the more common C-4 dimethylamine functionality, making SsfX3 the first acyltransferase identified to act on a tetracycline substrate. The crystal structure of SsfX3 was determined at 2.5 Å, revealing two distinct domains as follows: an N-terminal β-sandwich domain that resembles a carbohydrate-binding module, and a C-terminal catalytic domain that contains the atypical α/β-hydrolase fold found in the GDSL hydrolase family of enzymes. The active site lies at one end of a large open binding pocket, which is spatially defined by structural elements from both the N- and C-terminal domains. Mutational analysis in the putative substrate binding pocket identified residues from both domains that are important for binding the acyl donor and acceptor. Furthermore, removal of the N-terminal carbohydrate-binding module-like domain rendered the stand-alone α/β-hydrolase domain inactive. The additional noncatalytic module is therefore proposed to be required to define the binding pocket and provide sufficient interactions with the spatially extended tetracyclic substrate. SsfX3 was also demonstrated to accept a variety of non-native acyl groups. This relaxed substrate specificity toward the acyl donor allowed the chemoenzymatic biosynthesis of C-4-modified analogs of the immediate precursor to the bioactive SF2575; these were used to assay the structure activity relationships at the C-4 position."
https://openalex.org/W2066347127,"p63, a p53 family member, is critical for proper skin and limb development and directly regulates gene expression in the ectoderm. Mice lacking p63 exhibit skin and craniofacial defects including cleft palate. In humans p63 mutations are associated with several distinct developmental syndromes. p63 sterile-α-motif domain, AEC (ankyloblepharon-ectodermal dysplasia-clefting)-associated mutations are associated with a high prevalence of orofacial clefting disorders, which are less common in EEC (ectrodactyly-ectodermal dysplasia-clefting) patients with DNA binding domain p63 mutations. However, the mechanisms by which these mutations differentially influence p63 function remain unclear, and interactions with other proteins implicated in craniofacial development have not been identified. Here, we show that AEC p63 mutations affect the ability of the p63 protein to interact with special AT-rich binding protein-2 (SATB2), which has recently also been implicated in the development of cleft palate. p63 and SATB2 are co-expressed early in development in the ectoderm of the first and second branchial arches, two essential sites where signaling is required for craniofacial patterning. SATB2 attenuates p63-mediated gene expression of perp (p53 apoptosis effector related to PMP-22), a critical downstream target gene during development, and specifically decreases p63 perp promoter binding. Interestingly, AEC but not EEC p63 mutations affect the ability of p63 to interact with SATB2 and the inhibitory effects of SATB2 on p63 transactivation of perp are most pronounced for AEC-associated p63 mutations. Our findings reveal a novel gain-of-function property of AEC-causing p63 mutations and identify SATB2 as the first p63 binding partner that differentially influences AEC and EEC p63 mutant proteins. p63, a p53 family member, is critical for proper skin and limb development and directly regulates gene expression in the ectoderm.

https://openalex.org/W2103256953,"The activation of α/β heterodimeric integrins is the result of highly coordinated rearrangements within both subunits. The molecular interactions between the two subunits, however, remain to be characterized. In this study, we use the integrin α(L)β(2) to investigate the functional role of the C-linker polypeptide that connects the C-terminal end of the inserted (I) domain with the β-propeller domain on the α subunit and is located at the interface with the βI domain of the β chain. We demonstrate that shortening of the C-linker by eight or more amino acids results in constitutively active α(L)β(2) in which the αI domain is no longer responsive to the regulation by the βI domain. Despite this intersubunit uncoupling, both I domains remain individually sensitive to intrasubunit conformational changes induced by allosteric modulators. Interestingly, the length and not the sequence of the C-linker appears to be critical for its functionality in α/β intersubunit communication. Using two monoclonal antibodies (R7.1 and CBR LFA-1/1) we further demonstrate that shortening of the C-linker results in the gradual loss of combinational epitopes that require both the αI and β-propeller domains for full reactivity. Taken together, our findings highlight the role of the C-linker as a spring-like element that allows relaxation of the αI domain in the resting state and controlled tension of the αI domain during activation, exerted by the β chain."
https://openalex.org/W2123959088,"During the G2-M transition, the highly organized Golgi apparatus undergoes reversible fragmentation through unstacking of the cisternal ribbon and disassembly into radially dispersed vesicles and tubules. These Golgi-derived fragments redistribute randomly within the cytoplasm, partition stochastically, and in telophase coalesce to generate a functionally and structurally intact Golgi complex. Here we identified a novel step in postmitotic Golgi reassembly that requires the clathrin heavy chain (CHC). We used siRNA-mediated CHC knockdown, biochemistry, and morphological analysis and showed that the spindle- and spindle pole-associated clathrin pools are membrane-bound and required for postmitotic Golgi reassembly. The results presented here show that clathrin remains associated with the spindle poles throughout mitosis and that this clathrin pool is distinct from the previously characterized spindle-associated population. We suggest that clathrin may provide a template for postmitotic Golgi reassembly and cisternal remodeling. In absence of the CHC, the Golgi apparatus remained disconnected and disordered and failed to regain its characteristic perinuclear, lace-like morphology. Our findings build on previous independent reports that clathrin is required for Golgi reassembly following disruption with pharmacological agents and for mitotic chromosome congression."
