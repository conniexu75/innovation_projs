https://openalex.org/W2909194804,"The splicing of pre-mRNAs into mature transcripts is remarkable for its precision, but the mechanisms by which the cellular machinery achieves such specificity are incompletely understood. Here, we describe a deep neural network that accurately predicts splice junctions from an arbitrary pre-mRNA transcript sequence, enabling precise prediction of noncoding genetic variants that cause cryptic splicing. Synonymous and intronic mutations with predicted splice-altering consequence validate at a high rate on RNA-seq and are strongly deleterious in the human population. De novo mutations with predicted splice-altering consequence are significantly enriched in patients with autism and intellectual disability compared to healthy controls and validate against RNA-seq in 21 out of 28 of these patients. We estimate that 9%-11% of pathogenic mutations in patients with rare genetic disorders are caused by this previously underappreciated class of disease variation."

We leveraged 9,428 metagenomes to reconstruct 154,723 microbial genomes (45% of high quality) spanning body sites, ages, countries, and lifestyles. We recapitulated 4,930 species-level genome bins (SGBs), 77% without genomes in public repositories (unknown SGBs [uSGBs]). uSGBs are prevalent (in 93% of well-assembled samples), expand underrepresented phyla, and are enriched in non-Westernized populations (40% of the total SGBs). We annotated 2.85 M genes in SGBs, many associated with conditions including infant development (94,000) or Westernization (106,000). SGBs and uSGBs permit deeper microbiome analyses and increase the average mappability of metagenomic reads from 67.76% to 87.51% in the gut (median 94.26%) and 65.14% to 82.34% in the mouth. We thus identify thousands of microbial genomes from yet-to-be-named species, expand the pangenomes of human-associated microbes, and allow better exploitation of metagenomic technologies.

Le Chatelier E. et al.MetaHIT ConsortiumMetaHIT ConsortiumIdentification and assembly of genomes and genetic elements in complex metagenomic samples without using reference genomes.Nat. Biotechnol. 2014; 32: 822-828Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), can identify genomic bins without reference, but these techniques do not account for sample-specific strains and strain-level differences in the sequence reconstruction and thus require downstream single-nucleotide variation analysis on specific genomic regions to uncover strain variability (Quince et al., 2017bQuince C.

Huttenhower C. Segata N. Microbial strain-level population structure and genetic diversity from metagenomes.Genome Res. 2017; 27: 626-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Using large-scale single-sample metagenomic assembly supported by strict quality control (including filtering based on nucleotide polymorphisms), we identified 3,796 species-level clades (comprising 34,205 genomes) without previous whole-genome information. This identified several taxa prevalent but previously unobserved even in well-profiled populations (e.g., a genus-level Ruminococcaceae clade phylogenetically close to Faecalibacterium), extensive taxonomically uncharacterized species associated with non-Western populations, and the presence of several taxa from undersampled phyla (e.g., Saccharibacteria and Elusimicrobia) in oral and gut microbiomes. The resulting genome set can thus serve as the basis for future strain-specific comparative genomics to associate variants in the human microbiome with environmental exposures and health outcomes across the globe. We employed a very large-scale metagenomic assembly approach to reconstruct bacterial and archaeal genomes populating the human microbiome (see STAR Methods). From a total of 9,316 metagenomes spanning 46 datasets from multiple populations, body sites, and host ages (Table S1), and an additional cohort from Madagascar (Golden et al., 2017Golden C.D. Anjaranirina E.J.G. Fernald L.C.H. Hartl D.L. Kremen C. Milner Jr., D.A. Ralalason D.H. Ramihantaniarivo H. Randriamady H. Rice B.L. et al.Cohort Profile: The Madagascar Health and Environmental Research (MAHERY) study in north-eastern Madagascar.Int. J. Epidemiol. 2017; 46: 1747-1748dCrossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) (STAR Methods; Table S1), we reconstructed a total of 154,723 genomes (each made up of a group of clustered contigs; see STAR Methods) using a single-sample assembly strategy tailored at maximizing the quality rather than the quantity of genomes reconstructed from each sample. The resulting catalog greatly expands the set of ∼150,000 microbial genomes publicly available (see STAR Methods). All assembled genomes passed strict quality control including estimation of completeness, contamination, and a measure of strain heterogeneity (see STAR Methods), and they exceed the thresholds to be defined medium quality (MQ) according to recent guidelines (Bowers et al., 2017Bowers R.M. Kyrpides N.C. Stepanauskas R. Harmon-Smith M. Doud D. Reddy T.B.K. Schulz F. Jarett J. Rivers A.R. Eloe-Fadrosh E.A. et al.Genome Standards ConsortiumMinimum information about a single amplified genome (MISAG) and a metagenome-assembled genome (MIMAG) of bacteria and archaea.Nat. Biotechnol. 2017; 35: 725-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (710) Google Scholar) (completeness >50%, contamination <5%). The quality of these genomes was comparable with that of isolate sequencing (STAR Methods; Table S2) and in line also with the quality achievable by manually curated metagenomic approaches (Table S2) and time-series or cross-sectional metagenomic co-binning (see STAR Methods; Table S2). Genomes may include contigs from plasmids (see STAR Methods), and stricter quality control reduced the set of near-complete, high-quality (HQ) genomes to 70,178 with completeness higher than 90% and reduced probability of intra-sample strain heterogeneity (<0.5% polymorphic positions, see STAR Methods). The main characteristics of HQ genomes are in line and in some cases better than those from the compendium of reference genomes available in public repositories, although MQ genomes also had similar quality scores compared to HQ genomes (modulo completeness; STAR Methods). The set of genomes we reconstructed (Table S3; Data and Software Availability) and the associated 2.85 million (M) total functional annotations (STAR Methods; Figure S1) are thus appropriate as a basis for more in-depth microbial community analyses. To organize the 154,723 genomes into species-level genome bins (SGBs), we employed an all-versus-all genetic distance quantification followed by clustering and identification of genome bins spanning a 5% genetic diversity, which is consistent with the definition of known species (see STAR Methods) and with other reports (Jain et al., 2018Jain C. Rodriguez-R L.M. Phillippy A.M. Konstantinidis K.T. Aluru S. High throughput ANI analysis of 90K prokaryotic genomes reveals clear species boundaries.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 5114Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). We obtained 4,930 SGBs from 22 known phyla (Figure 1A; Table S4). This is likely an underestimate of the total phylum-level diversity, because some SGBs are very divergent from all previously available reference genomes and cannot be confidently assigned to a taxonomic family (Table S4): 345 SGBs (58% of which with HQ or multiple reconstructed genomes) display more than 30% Mash-estimated genetic distance (Ondov et al., 2016Ondov B.D. Treangen T.J. Melsted P. Mallonee A.B. Bergman N.H. Koren S. Phillippy A.M. Mash: fast genome and metagenome distance estimation using MinHash.Genome Biol. 2016; 17: 132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar) from the closest isolate with a phylum assignment (Figure S2A). The SGB genomic catalog spans on average 3.0%, SD 1.8% intra-SGB nucleotide genetic variability, and each SGB contains up to 3,457 genomes from different individuals (average 31.4, SD 147.6; Figures 1C and S2B).Figure S2Overview of the Reconstructed SGBs and Criteria for SGB Definition and Taxonomic Assignment, Related to Figure 6Show full caption(A) Distribution of the distances of each reconstructed genome to the closest available isolate genomes, grouped by the class assigned to the matching isolate genomes.

Functional annotation of all the reconstructed genomes assigned a UniRef90 (The UniProt Consortium, 2017The UniProt ConsortiumUniProt: the universal protein knowledgebase.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45: D158-D169Crossref PubMed Scopus (3136) Google Scholar) label to 230 M genes and a UniRef50 to 268 M genes (72.7% and 84.8% of the total of 316 M genes, respectively). Additional EggNOG (Huerta-Cepas et al., 2017Huerta-Cepas J. Forslund K. Coelho L.P. Szklarczyk D. Jensen L.J. von Mering C. Bork P.

Evol. 2017; 34: 2115-2122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar) labels were assigned to 80.8% of the 4,930 SGBs’ genome representatives. The functional potential profiles of the genomes had, as expected, clear phylogenetic differentiation (Figure S1), and the rate of annotation varied greatly in SGBs (e.g., >90% genes annotated for well-studies species such as Escherichia coli or Bacteroides fragilis versus 22% for ID 15286, which is the largest SGB without reference genomes). Each of the body sites considered had a clear distinctive set of annotations with the adult fecal microbiome enriched for 101,056 gene families (Table S5, Bonferroni-corrected Fisher's test p < 0.01), representative of anaerobe-specific functions such as formate oxidation and methanogenesis and a strong representation of biofilm formation functions in the oral cavity and on the skin. Genomes from the stool microbiome of newborns had 94,562 enriched gene families (Table S5, Bonferroni-corrected Fisher's test p < 0.01) comprising a variety of functions such as folate biosynthesis and lactose, oligosaccharides, and mucin degradation that are typical of the niche and nutritional regime of unweaned infants (Asnicar et al., 2017Asnicar F.

Age-specific functions (Table S5) are characterized by the later host developmental stages of children (17,121 specific functions) and school-age individuals (349 specific functions). The Westernization process has also a strong influence on the functions encoded in the stool microbiome, with a total of 106,872 differential families (Table S5, Bonferroni-corrected Fisher's test p < 0.01) spanning enzymes involved in the metabolism of complex carbohydrates, such as xylose and cellulose, and in specific cobalamin biosynthesis pathways; these are likely reflecting dietary habits, among other environmental differences. The organization of the reconstructed genomes in SGBs and their functional profiling will be the basis for comprehensive future metagenomic characterizations. We identified 3,796 SGBs (i.e., 77.0% of the total) covering unexplored microbial diversity as they represent species without any publicly available genomes from isolate sequencing or previous metagenomic assemblies (Figures 1B and S3A). These SGBs, that we named unknown SGBs (uSGBs), include on average 9.0, SD 45.4 reconstructed genomes, and 1,693 of them (45%) had at least one HQ genome. Recursive clustering of SGBs’ representatives at genus- and family-level genetic divergence (see STAR Methods) provided taxonomic context for 75.2% of the uSGBs with 1,472 assignments to genera and 1,383 more to families (Table S4). The 941 uSGBs that were left unplaced at family level remained unassigned for limitations of whole-genome similarity estimates, but we report the similarity and taxonomy of the closest matching strain (Table S4). Only 1,134 of the 4,930 SGBs represent at least partially known SGBs (kSGBs) that include one or more genomes in public databases. This number of kSGBs is consistent with the 1,266 species we found at least once in the same set of metagenomes (Pasolli et al., 2017Pasolli E. Schiffer L. Manghi P. Renson A. Obenchain V. Truong D.T. Beghini F. Malik F. Ramos M. Dowd J.B. et al.Accessible, curated metagenomic data through ExperimentHub.Nat. Methods. 2017; 14: 1023-1024Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar) at >0.01% abundance using reference-based taxonomic profiling (Truong et al., 2015Truong D.T. Franzosa E.A. Tickle T.L. Scholz M. Weingart G. Pasolli E. Tett A. Huttenhower C. Segata N. MetaPhlAn2 for enhanced metagenomic taxonomic profiling.Nat. Methods. 2015; 12: 902-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). Most uSGBs represent instead relatively rare human-associated microbes (46.7% of uSGBs comprise one reconstructed genome only, Table S4, and 46.1% genomes in uSGBs are at <0.5% relative abundance, STAR Methods and Table S4), but some uSGBs are highly prevalent, with 10 uSGBs in the set of the 100 SGBs with the largest number of reconstructed genomes (Figures 1C, 1D, and S2B) and 368 genomes in uSGBs accounting for >10% of reads. Because many uSGBs are associated with specific sample types (e.g., oral cavity or non-Westernized samples, Figure 1E), the actual number of possibly redundant genomes they contain is likely underestimated for those sample types with comparably fewer metagenomes available. Functional annotation of uSGB genomes assigned a UniRef90 cluster to only 31.9% of the genes, while the annotation rate increased to 81.0% for kSGB genomes. The expanded human microbiome diversity induced by the uSGBs (200% increase in the reconstructed phylogenetic branch length, 50% considering only uSGBs with >10 genomes, Figure 1A) can be crucial as a genomic reference in the characterization (“mappability”) of the sequence information in a metagenome. Genomes in uSGBs are indeed responsible for a substantial decrease of the metagenomic reads that do not match any microbial reference (Figures 2A and S4). This is due both to uSGBs representing target microbes without assigned species (16.76% average increase using only representative genomes of uSGBs, Figure 2A) and to the expansion of pangenomes of kSGBs and uSGBs (27.84% increase when considering all genomes instead of only SGB representatives). On average, the read mappability for stool samples reached 87.51% (29.14% increase, Figure 2A) and 82.34% in the oral cavity (26.40% increase, Figure 2A). Some outlier samples decreased the averages as the median final mappabilities were higher, reaching 94.26% for the stool microbiome and 90.13% for the oral microbiome in Westernized populations. The mappability of the skin microbiome was also increased (15.17% increase) but reached a lower overall value (57.07%) because fewer skin samples were available and non-bacterial organisms such as the molluscum contagiosum virus (Oh et al., 2014Oh J. Byrd A.L. Deming C. Conlan S. Kong H.H. Segre J.A. NISC Comparative Sequencing ProgramBiogeography and individuality shape function in the human skin metagenome.Nature. 2014; 514: 59-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar) and fungi from the Malassezia genus (Tett et al., 2017Tett A. Pasolli E. Farina S. Truong D.T. Asnicar F. Zolfo M. Beghini F. Armanini F. Jousson O. De Sanctis V. et al.Unexplored diversity and strain-level structure of the skin microbiome associated with psoriasis.NPJ Biofilms Microbiomes. 2017; 3: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) also populate the skin. Mappability in the vaginal microbiomes was instead already high (82.77%) due to a reduced panel of known species dominating the large majority of these communities, but the set of 4,930 reconstructed SGBs still increased the mappability by 3.42%. The mappability increase is dramatic for the gut microbiomes of non-Westernized populations that are very poorly represented by available reference genomes (42.33% mappability) and can now reach a mappability of 83.20%, which is comparable with that of Westernized populations (Figure 2B). These substantial gains in read mappability when using our genome catalog are achieved also for stool and oral samples not used to construct the resource (STAR Methods; Figures 2A and 2B), confirming its relevance as reference for future studies.Figure S4Improvement of Read Mappability Statistics by Considering the Set of Microbial Genomes We Assembled in This Work, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Fraction of reads that can be mapped against different sets of genomes from isolate sequencing and the metagenomically reconstructed genomes.

All the 9,428 metagenomes used in this study were mapped after being subsampled at 1% (see STAR Methods). Averaged statistics are reported in Figures 2A–2B. SGBs without publicly available genomes (uSGBs) represent 34,205 reconstructed genomes (Figure 1B), belonging to metagenomes in different body sites, ages, and general lifestyles (Figures 1E and 1F). Microbiomes with lower diversity, such as those from infants or the female urogenital tract, carried a generally lower fraction of uSGBs. Populations with non-Westernized lifestyles—including the Madagascar cohort we sequenced (Figures 2C and 2D)—conversely yielded a fraction of genomes in uSGBs nearly double that of Western-style populations (average 40% and 21%, respectively, p < 1e−50, Figure 1E). Most of the abundant kSGBs in the Madagascar cohort do not include isolate genomes but only sequences from previous metagenomic assemblies (Figure 2C), and these uSGBs and poorly characterized kSGBs are contributing to the clear distinction of the gut microbiome with respect to general lifestyles (Figure 2D).

Environmental factors also play important roles, but no methods are available for their comprehensive investigation. We developed an approach that combines genomic data, screens in a novel zebrafish model, computational modeling, perturbation studies, and multiple sclerosis (MS) patient samples to evaluate the effects of environmental exposure on CNS inflammation. We found that the herbicide linuron amplifies astrocyte pro-inflammatory activities by activating signaling via sigma receptor 1, inositol-requiring enzyme-1α (IRE1α), and X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1). Indeed, astrocyte-specific shRNA- and CRISPR/Cas9-driven gene inactivation combined with RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, and study of patient samples suggest that IRE1α-XBP1 signaling promotes CNS inflammation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and, potentially, MS. In summary, these studies define environmental mechanisms that control astrocyte pathogenic activities and establish a multidisciplinary approach for the systematic investigation of the effects of environmental exposure in neurologic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2909764080,"Elucidating the global and local rules that govern genome-wide, hierarchical chromatin architecture remains a critical challenge. Current high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) technologies have identified large-scale chromatin structural motifs, such as topologically associating domains and looping. However, structural rules at the smallest or nucleosome scale remain poorly understood. Here, we coupled nucleosome-resolved Hi-C technology with simulated annealing-molecular dynamics (SA-MD) simulation to reveal 3D spatial distributions of nucleosomes and their genome-wide orientation in chromatin. Our method, called Hi-CO, revealed distinct nucleosome folding motifs across the yeast genome. Our results uncovered two types of basic secondary structural motifs in nucleosome folding: α-tetrahedron and β-rhombus analogous to α helix and β sheet motifs in protein folding. Using mutants and cell-cycle-synchronized cells, we further uncovered motifs with specific nucleosome positioning and orientation coupled to epigenetic features at individual loci. By illuminating molecular-level structure-function relationships in eukaryotic chromatin, our findings establish organizational principles of nucleosome folding."
https://openalex.org/W2908567854,"The motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) are thought to stem from an imbalance in the activity of striatal direct- and indirect-pathway spiny projection neurons (SPNs). Disease-induced alterations in the activity of networks controlling SPNs could contribute to this imbalance. One of these networks is anchored by the parafascicular nucleus (PFn) of the thalamus. To determine the role of the PFn in striatal PD pathophysiology, optogenetic, chemogenetic, and electrophysiological tools were used in ex vivo slices from transgenic mice with region-specific Cre recombinase expression. These studies revealed that in parkinsonian mice, the functional connectivity of PFn neurons with indirect pathway SPNs (iSPNs) was selectively enhanced by cholinergic interneurons acting through presynaptic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on PFn terminals. Attenuating this network adaptation by chemogenetic or genetic strategies alleviated motor-learning deficits in parkinsonian mice, pointing to a potential new therapeutic strategy for PD patients."
https://openalex.org/W2909466649,"Despite a wealth of molecular knowledge, quantitative laws for accurate prediction of biological phenomena remain rare. Alternative pre-mRNA splicing is an important regulated step in gene expression frequently perturbed in human disease. To understand the combined effects of mutations during evolution, we quantified the effects of all possible combinations of exonic mutations accumulated during the emergence of an alternatively spliced human exon. This revealed that mutation effects scale non-monotonically with the inclusion level of an exon, with each mutation having maximum effect at a predictable intermediate inclusion level. This scaling is observed genome-wide for cis and trans perturbations of splicing, including for natural and disease-associated variants. Mathematical modeling suggests that competition between alternative splice sites is sufficient to cause this non-linearity in the genotype-phenotype map. Combining the global scaling law with specific pairwise interactions between neighboring mutations allows accurate prediction of the effects of complex genotype changes involving >10 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2910907132,"Many evolutionary years separate humans and macaques, and although the amygdala and cingulate cortex evolved to enable emotion and cognition in both, an evident functional gap exists. Although they were traditionally attributed to differential neuroanatomy, functional differences might also arise from coding mechanisms. Here we find that human neurons better utilize information capacity (efficient coding) than macaque neurons in both regions, and that cingulate neurons are more efficient than amygdala neurons in both species. In contrast, we find more overlap in the neural vocabulary and more synchronized activity (robustness coding) in monkeys in both regions and in the amygdala of both species. Our findings demonstrate a tradeoff between robustness and efficiency across species and regions. We suggest that this tradeoff can contribute to differential cognitive functions between species and underlie the complementary roles of the amygdala and the cingulate cortex. In turn, it can contribute to fragility underlying human psychopathologies."
https://openalex.org/W2910459878,"An important model for axon pathfinding is provided by guidance of embryonic commissural axons from dorsal spinal cord to ventral midline floor plate (FP). FP cells produce a chemoattractive activity, comprised largely of netrin1 (FP-netrin1) and Sonic hedgehog (Shh), that can attract the axons at a distance in vitro. netrin1 is also produced by ventricular zone (VZ) progenitors along the axons' route (VZ-netrin1). Recent studies using region-specific netrin1 deletion suggested that FP-netrin1 is dispensable and VZ-netrin1 sufficient for netrin guidance activity in vivo. We show that removing FP-netrin1 actually causes guidance defects in spinal cord consistent with long-range action (i.e., over hundreds of micrometers), and double mutant analysis supports that FP-netrin1 and Shh collaborate to attract at long range. We further provide evidence that netrin1 may guide via chemotaxis or haptotaxis. These results support the model that netrin1 signals at both short and long range to guide commissural axons in spinal cord."

Methods A cohort of 100 patients was included in this retrospective, single institution analysis. Radiomics texture features were extracted from computed tomography (CT) images obtained for the clinical target volume. The cohort of patients was randomly divided into two separate groups for the training (60 patients) and validation (40 patients). Cox regression models were built to predict overall survival and local control. The significant predictors at univariate analysis were included in a multivariate model. The quality of the models was appraised by means of area under the curve and concordance index. Results A clinical-radiomic signature associated with Overall Survival (OS) was found significant in both training and validation sets (p = 0.01 and 0.05 and concordance index 0.73 and 0.75 respectively). Similarly, a signature was found for Local Control (LC) with p = 0.007 and 0.004 and concordance index 0.69 and 0.75. In the low risk group, the median OS and LC in the validation group were 14.4 and 28.6 months while in the high-risk group were 9.0 and 17.5 months respectively. Conclusion A CT based radiomic signature was identified which correlate with OS and LC after SBRT and allowed to identify low and high-risk groups of patients."

This is because glucokinase, the rate-limiting enzyme for glucose metabolism in the β-cell, has a much lower affinity for glucose than other hexokinases, allowing the β-cell to adjust the rate of glucose metabolism and, thus, the rate of insulin secretion in response to small changes in blood glucose concentration (16Matschinsky F.M. Banting Lecture 1995: a lesson in metabolic regulation inspired by the glucokinase glucose sensor paradigm.Diabetes. 1996; 45 (8549869): 223-24110.2337/diab.45.2.223Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). For these reasons, the rate of mitochondrial oxidation in the β-cell is directly proportional to the blood glucose concentration. It is widely accepted that, in type 2 diabetes, when blood glucose is chronically elevated, increased oxidative phosphorylation results in elevated ROS production in β-cells. In support of this idea, treatment of rat and human islets with high glucose for 72 h increases intracellular peroxides compared with islets incubated under low-glucose conditions (17Tanaka Y.

However, it stands to reason that, evolutionarily, β-cells should be protected from oxidative stress because they release a hormone that is essential for survival and that is controlled by the primary ROS-producing pathway: mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. Further, β-cells have a limited capacity for self-renewal. Consistent with this view, recent studies have shown that peroxiredoxins, a class of antioxidants capable of reducing H2O2, lipid peroxides, and peroxynitrite, are expressed in β-cells and, when overexpressed, protect β-cells from oxidative stress (27Wolf G.

However, the roles of endogenously expressed antioxidants in protecting β-cells from H2O2-induced stress, and the mechanisms by which this occurs, are unclear. It is common practice to use a single or repeated bolus of H2O2 when studying β-cell responses to the oxidant (32Marinho H.S. Cyrne L. Cadenas E. Antunes F. H2O2 delivery to cells: steady-state versus bolus addition.Methods Enzymol. 2013; 526 (23791100): 159-17310.1016/B978-0-12-405883-5.00010-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Although the physiological relevance of this delivery method can be debated, when delivered as a one-time bolus, we found that H2O2 exhausts the antioxidant defenses of the cell, leading to accumulation of DNA damage, depletion of intracellular energy stores, and cell death. To more closely mimic oxidant accumulation in a native setting, we used glucose oxidase to continuously deliver H2O2 over time and demonstrate that pancreatic β-cells are capable of detoxifying micromolar levels of the oxidant when delivered in this manner. These findings suggest that, in response to a more physiologically relevant system of H2O2 delivery, β-cells possess an antioxidant defense pathway that has been masked by use of nonphysiological bolus delivery of oxidants. We further provide evidence to support thioredoxin reductase and peroxiredoxins as the mechanism by which β-cells maintain this robust antioxidant defense pathway that provides protection from oxidative damage. When examining the responses of β-cells to H2O2, it is common to use a single or repeated dose of diluted H2O2 added to the cell culture medium (32Marinho H.S. Cyrne L. Cadenas E. Antunes F. H2O2 delivery to cells: steady-state versus bolus addition.Methods Enzymol. 2013; 526 (23791100): 159-17310.1016/B978-0-12-405883-5.00010-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, when 100 μm H2O2 is added as a bolus to our medium conditions, more than 50% disappears after 5 min, and nearly the entire dose is gone within 30 min, regardless of the presence of cells (Fig. 1A). This is likely due to the presence of pyruvate, which rapidly reacts with H2O2 to produce acetic acid, water, and carbon dioxide (33Long L.H. Halliwell B. Artefacts in cell culture: pyruvate as a scavenger of hydrogen peroxide generated by ascorbate or epigallocatechin gallate in cell culture media.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2009; 388 (19695227): 700-70410.1016/j.bbrc.2009.08.069Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Because of these complicating factors, we sought to develop a culture system to study β-cell responses to H2O2 produced under more physiological conditions. To address this goal, glucose oxidase was used to continuously generate this oxidant in the medium. In contrast to bolus delivery, H2O2 generation in response to treatment with 20 milliunits/ml glucose oxidase increases in a time-dependent manner to levels that reach 50 μm following 30-min incubation in the absence of cells (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, H2O2 levels are decreased by 20–40% in the presence of the cells compared with medium alone, suggesting that β-cells may be capable of detoxifying this oxidant (Fig. 1B). Area under the curve calculations demonstrate that, over the course of the 30-min experiment, cells are exposed to a similar amount of H2O2, regardless of the method of delivery (Fig. 1C). In the absence of cells, more oxidant is present in the medium when it is delivered continuously by 20 milliunits/ml glucose oxidase than when it is delivered as a one-time 100 μm bolus (Fig. 1C). To explore this observation more thoroughly, rat INS 832/13 cells or human EndoC-βH1 cells were exposed for 4 h to H2O2 delivered as a bolus or continuously using glucose oxidase (Fig. 2). As expected, extracellular H2O2 concentrations are indistinguishable from untreated medium after 4 h of incubation under bolus conditions, regardless of the presence of cells (Fig. 2A). However, H2O2 levels after 4 h of glucose oxidase treatment are inversely related to cell density (Fig. 2, B and C), with the highest H2O2 accumulation occurring in the absence of cells and the lowest in the presence of cells at full confluency (50,000). INS 832/13 cell viability decreases in a concentration-dependent manner in response to H2O2 delivered as a bolus, and this effect is not modified by cell density (Fig. 2D). When supplied as a bolus at a concentration of 200 μm, H2O2 reduces INS 832/13 cell viability by 50% under all conditions examined. In contrast, when delivered continuously using glucose oxidase, H2O2 decreases cell viability in a concentration-dependent manner that is also dependent on the initial cell density (Fig. 2, E and F). The concentration-dependent actions of H2O2 on cell viability are not due to glucose depletion by glucose oxidase, as there is minimal consumption of glucose by this enzyme (Fig. 2G). With increasing cell density, the toxic actions of H2O2 are decreased, and this protective effect of higher cell density is associated with lower detectable levels of H2O2 following the 4-h incubation. These findings suggest that β-cells have the capacity to detoxify H2O2 when provided in a physiologically relevant, continuous manner; however, when supplied as a bolus, β-cells are unable to remove this oxidant. Consistent with previous findings, we observed that bolus administration of 100 μm H2O2 for 1 h depletes intracellular energy stores, as evidenced by the decrease in both ATP and NAD+ levels in INS 832/13 cells (Fig. 3, A and B). This depletion of nucleotides is due to overactivation of PARP-1, as selective PARP-1 inhibition protects against bolus H2O2–induced death (Fig. 3C), as observed previously (34Broniowska K.A. Oleson B.J. McGraw J. Naatz A. Mathews C.E. Corbett J.A. How the location of superoxide generation influences the β-cell response to nitric oxide.J. Biol. Chem. 2015; 290 (25648890): 7952-796010.1074/jbc.M114.627869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, H2O2 generated continuously by 20 milliunits/ml glucose oxidase over 1 h does not deplete ATP and NAD+ levels (Fig. 3, A and B), and PARP-1 inhibition does not protect against cell death induced by 4-h glucose oxidase treatment, suggesting that PARP-1 is not activated in β-cells in response to continuous delivery of H2O2 (Fig. 3D). Bolus H2O2 addition is known to activate the DNA damage response and energy-sensing pathways in β-cells (35Meares G.P. Fontanilla D. Broniowska K.A. Andreone T. Lancaster Jr, J.R. Corbett J.A. Differential responses of pancreatic β-cells to ROS and RNS.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2013; 304 (23321474): E614-62210.1152/ajpendo.00424.2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). As expected, bolus addition of 100 μm H2O2 causes DNA double-strand breaks, as indicated by the phosphorylation of histone variant H2AX (γH2AX), and activation of energy-sensing pathways, as indicated by the phosphorylation of AMP-activated kinase (Fig. 4, A and B). Peroxiredoxins are a ubiquitous class of antioxidant enzymes that, when in their reduced form, detoxify H2O2 by reducing it to H2O (36Hofmann B. Hecht H.J. Flohé L. Peroxiredoxins.Biol. Chem. 2002; 383 (12033427): 347-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). During the catalytic cycle of H2O2 reduction, the peroxiredoxin active-site cysteine is oxidized to sulfinic acid (PrxSOH) and then reduced by the action of thioredoxins. However, following bolus addition of 100 μm H2O2, the peroxiredoxin active-site thiol is oxidized to sulfonic acid (PrxSO3), inhibiting the enzyme (Fig. 4, A and B). This result suggests that peroxiredoxins, which may normally provide antioxidant defenses to the cell, are exhausted by treatment with an H2O2 bolus. In contrast, exposure to H2O2 delivered continuously over 30 min at glucose oxidase concentrations of 30 milliunits/ml or lower fails to activate the DNA damage response and energy-sensing pathways and does not modify the peroxiredoxin active site (Fig. 4). It is only under high concentrations of glucose oxidase (40 milliunits/ml or greater) that continuous H2O2 delivery elicits similar responses to bolus addition (Fig. 4C), suggesting the existence of a threshold effect for H2O2 removal. Below this threshold level, β-cells can detoxify H2O2. However, when this threshold is surpassed, the defense is no longer capable of reducing H2O2, leading to hyperoxidation of peroxiredoxins (PrxSO3), activation of the DNA damage response (γH2AX), and activation of low energy–sensing pathways (AMPK phosphorylation). As introduced above, peroxiredoxins are antioxidant enzymes that function to reduce H2O2 to H2O, resulting in their oxidation. Thioredoxin is used to return peroxiredoxins to their reduced form and restore catalytic activity. The oxidation status of thioredoxin is controlled by the activity of thioredoxin reductase, which reduces thioredoxin and allows the cycle to continue. NADPH closes the catalytic relay by serving as an electron donor for reduction of thioredoxin reductase. Although β-cells are thought to be ill-equipped with antioxidant enzymes such as GSH peroxidase and catalase (18Grankvist K. Marklund S.L. Täljedal I.B.

The primary thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase isoforms expressed in both INS 832/13 cells and rat islets are the cytoplasmic forms: Txn1 and Txnrd1, respectively (Fig. 5). Interestingly, there are some differences in expression of the different peroxiredoxin isoforms between INS 832/13 cells and rat islets. In rat islets, the primary peroxiredoxins are Prdx1 and Prdx2, both cytoplasmic (Fig. 5B), whereas INS 832/13 cells express these two forms along with the endoplasmic reticulum–localized isoform Prdx4 and Prdx5, an isoform with uncertain localization (Fig. 5A) (2Lenzen S. Chemistry and biology of reactive species with special reference to the antioxidative defence status in pancreatic β-cells.Biochim. Biophys. Acta Gen. Subj. 2017; 1861 (28527893): 1929-194210.1016/j.bbagen.2017.05.013Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Another notable difference is the overall level of expression of the peroxiredoxins and thioredoxin reductases, with both being expressed around 10-fold greater in rat islets than in INS 832/13 cells. Together, these data show that all components of the peroxiredoxin antioxidant cycle are present in β-cells. Because a 100 μm H2O2 bolus hyperoxidizes peroxiredoxins whereas 20 milliunits/ml glucose oxidase does not, and because peroxiredoxin, thioredoxin, and thioredoxin reductase are readily expressed in β-cells, we hypothesized that the peroxiredoxin/thioredoxin antioxidant system may be the pathway that allows β-cells to detoxify H2O2. To test this hypothesis, we inhibited thioredoxin reductase with the selective inhibitor auranofin (AFN). Treatment with auranofin does not affect INS 832/13 cell viability after bolus administration of H2O2 (Fig. 6A). However, when H2O2 is delivered continuously by glucose oxidase, auranofin treatment results in a significant decrease in INS 832/13 and EndoC-βH1 cell as well as dispersed rat islet cell viability (Fig. 6, B–D). The addition of 10 units/ml catalase completely restores cell viability, suggesting that H2O2, and not D-glucono-1,5 lactone, another product of the glucose oxidase reaction, is the cause of cell death (Fig. 6B). Similarly, when Txnrd1 is knocked down more than 70% (Fig. 6G) using specific siRNAs, INS 832/13 cells become significantly more sensitive to H2O2 generated by glucose oxidase (Fig. 6F) but not to H2O2 delivered as a bolus (Fig. 6E). Because glucose oxidase delivers H2O2 to cells extracellularly, we sought a method to deliver H2O2 intracellularly to more closely mimic how the oxidant might be generated during oxidative phosphorylation. To this end, we used menadione, a redox cycler that generates superoxide, which is subsequently dismutated to H2O2, in the mitochondria (37Criddle D.N. Gillies S. Baumgartner-Wilson H.K. Jaffar M. Chinje E.C. Passmore S. Chvanov M. Barrow S. Gerasimenko O.V. Tepikin A.V. Sutton R. Petersen O.H. Menadione-induced reactive oxygen species generation via redox cycling promotes apoptosis of murine pancreatic acinar cells.J. Biol.

When thioredoxin reductase is either inhibited or depleted, INS 832/13 cells become significantly more sensitized to increasing concentrations of menadione (Fig. 6, H and I). These results suggest that thioredoxin reductase, which maintains the reduced, active pool of peroxiredoxins, is necessary for β-cell detoxification of continuously generated H2O2. Reactive oxygen species such as H2O2 are known to cause DNA damage (2Lenzen S. Chemistry and biology of reactive species with special reference to the antioxidative defence status in pancreatic β-cells.Biochim. Biophys. Acta Gen. Subj. 2017; 1861 (28527893): 1929-194210.1016/j.bbagen.2017.05.013Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). However, such damage (assessed by both mean tail moment and formation of γH2AX) is only evident in INS 832/23 cells (Fig. 7, A and B) or rat islets (Fig. 7C) when they are treated with bolus H2O2. In contrast, treatment with glucose oxidase does not stimulate DNA damage or γH2AX formation. However, when β-cells are treated with both glucose oxidase and the thioredoxin reductase inhibitor, auranofin, they become susceptible to DNA damage to a similar extent as damage induced by H2O2 bolus addition (Fig. 7). These results suggest that the peroxiredoxin/thioredoxin system, supported by thioredoxin reductase, protects β-cells from H2O2-mediated DNA damage. ROS, such as superoxide and hydrogen peroxide, are produced during normal cellular metabolism. Superoxide is formed by addition of a single electron to molecular oxygen, a process that is mediated largely by electron leak from the mitochondrial electron transport chain (2Lenzen S. Che"

These results suggest that floor-plate-derived netrin-1 has a distinct impact on commissural axons in the spinal cord and hindbrain. In the CNS of bilaterally symmetric animals, commissural neurons project their axons to the contralateral side (Chédotal, 2014Chédotal A. Development and plasticity of commissural circuits: from locomotion to brain repair.Trends Neurosci. 2014; 37: 551-562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, most commissural axons grow ventrally and cross the midline at the level of the floor plate in the midbrain, ventral hindbrain, and spinal cord (SC). Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms guiding commissural axons toward the ventral midline has been a central question in developmental neurobiology (Chédotal, 2011Chédotal A.

Mechanisms and molecules that control growth cone guidance.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 341-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). At the end of the 19th century, Ramón y Cajal proposed that floor plate cells secrete chemoattractants for commissural axons (Ramón y Cajal, 1892Ramón y Cajal S. La rétine des vertébrés.Cellule. 1892; 1: 119-257Google Scholar). The first evidence supporting this hypothesis came about a century later using in vitro explant assays (Tessier-Lavigne et al., 1988Tessier-Lavigne M. Placzek M. Lumsden A.G. Dodd J. Jessell T.M. Chemotropic guidance of developing axons in the mammalian central nervous system.Nature. 1988; 336: 775-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Thus far, three floor-plate-derived chemoattractive factors have been identified: netrin-1 (Kennedy et al., 1994Kennedy T.E. Serafini T. de la Torre J.R. Tessier-Lavigne M.

All attract commissural axons in vitro and induce growth cone turning, but netrin-1 also has growth-promoting activity. Knockout mice lacking their respective receptors, deleted in colorectal cancer (Dcc), brother of CDO (Boc), or fetal liver kinase 1 (Flk1), exhibit commissural axon guidance defects. In Boc and Flk1 mutant embryos, commissural axons invade the motor columns and defasciculate in the ventral SC; however, midline crossing appears unaffected (Okada et al., 2006Okada A. Charron F.

By contrast, midline crossing is strongly impaired in the SC of mice lacking Dcc (Fazeli et al., 1997Fazeli A. Dickinson S.L. Hermiston M.L. Tighe R.V. Steen R.G. Small C.G. Stoeckli E.T.

In the hindbrain and SC, netrin-1 is present not only in floor plate cells but also in the ventral two-thirds of the ventricular zone (VZ) (Dominici et al., 2017Dominici C. Moreno-Bravo J.A.

By contrast, no midline crossing defects were detected in the hindbrain following netrin-1 deletion from the floor plate (Dominici et al., 2017Dominici C. Moreno-Bravo J.A. Puiggros S.R. Rappeneau Q.

The partial deletion of netrin-1 from the SC VZ also results in axon guidance errors, but to a much lesser extent than in the hindbrain (Varadarajan et al., 2017Varadarajan S.G. Kong J.H. Phan K.D. Kao T.-J. Panaitof S.C. Cardin J. Eltzschig H. Kania A. Novitch B.G. Butler S.J.

Following netrin-1 deletion from the floor plate in the SC, many axons reach the midline normally, although a detailed analysis of trajectories and crossing has not been conducted (Dominici et al., 2017Dominici C.

These unexpected results questioned the role of netrin-1 at the floor plate. Given the high expression of netrin-1 at the midline, does it really play no role in guidance to and across the midline? Here, we report that netrin-1 from the floor plate and netrin-1 from the VZ each individually contribute to commissural axon guidance in the SC and that these two netrin-1 sources act synergistically to guide commissural axons, as only the simultaneous deletion of netrin-1 from the VZ and floor plate leads to an almost complete lack of midline crossing. These results suggest that the function of floor plate netrin-1 might differ between the SC and hindbrain. The ablation of netrin-1 from the VZ using a Nestin1:cre (Nes:cre) line severely compromises midline crossing in the hindbrain (Dominici et al., 2017Dominici C. Moreno-Bravo J.A. Puiggros S.R.

Eltzschig H. Kania A. Novitch B.G. Butler S.J.

These results suggested that the contribution of VZ netrin-1 could differ between the hindbrain and SC or that there was still enough VZ netrin-1 to guide axons ventrally. To address this question, we first compared the expression pattern of netrin-1 mRNA of wild-type and Nes:cre;Ntn1fl/fl embryos between embryonic day 9 (E9) and E11 (Figures S1A–S1C and S1E–S1G). At E9, Ntn1 levels in the VZ and floor plate appeared comparable in control (n = 5) and Nes:cre;Ntn1fl/fl embryos (Figures S1A and S1E; n = 3). However, at E10 (n = 3), the Ntn1 level was reduced in the ventral SC VZ in Nes:cre;Ntn1fl/fl embryos, and by E11 (n = 5), it remained detectable only in the floor plate (Figures S1B, S1C, and S1F–S1G). Accordingly, in Nes:cre;RosaTom embryos (n = 9 embryos, 3 for each stage), tdTomato was present in only a few cells at E9 and in a mosaic of VZ cells and motor neurons at E10, but it covered the entire SC (except the floor plate) at E11 (Figures S1I–S1M). This shows that the slow onset of cre recombinase activity in the SC of Nes:cre;Ntn1fl/fl embryos only partially removed Ntn1 from the SC VZ at early developmental stages, coinciding with the appearance of the first commissural neurons (Dominici et al., 2017Dominici C.

Floor-plate-derived netrin-1 is dispensable for commissural axon guidance.Nature. 2017; 545: 350-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We next studied the distribution of netrin-1 protein at E11 (n = 5 for each genotype) and confirmed that in wild-type SC (Figure S1D), netrin-1 was present on commissural axons, the floor plate, the pial surface, and processes of VZ progenitors (Dominici et al., 2017Dominici C. Moreno-Bravo J.A. Puiggros S.R. Rappeneau Q. Rama N. Vieugue P. Bernet A. Mehlen P. Chédotal A.

In Nes:cre;Ntn1fl/fl embryos, netrin-1 was absent from the pial surface and VZ progenitors but still present on the floor plate and along some commissural axons, indicating that these axons probably transported netrin-1 dorsally (Figure S1H). Next, to study commissural axon pathfinding in Nes:cre;Ntn1fl/fl mutants, we performed whole-mount labeling for Robo3 on E11 embryos followed by 3DISCO clearing and light sheet fluorescent microscopy (LSFM) imaging (Belle et al., 2014Belle M. Godefroy D. Dominici C. Heitz-Marchaland C. Zelina P. Hellal F. Bradke F. Chédotal A. A simple method for 3D analysis of immunolabeled axonal tracts in a transparent nervous system.Cell Rep. 2014; 9: 1191-1201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). In wild-type embryos, a homogeneous palisade of thin Robo3+ axonal fascicles extended dorsoventrally to the floor plate (Figures 1A and 1B ; Video S1; n = 6). By contrast, in Nes:cre;Ntn1fl/fl E11 embryos (n = 6), Robo3+ axons form thick axonal bundles (Figures 1E and 1F; Video S1). Most Robo3+ axons still reached the floor plate, but unlike in wild-type embryos (Figures 1C and 1D), some grew dorsally toward the roof plate, others invaded the VZ, and a few left the CNS through the sensory roots (Figures 1G and 1H; Video S1). Commissural axons were more fasciculated in E11 Nes:cre;Ntn1fl/fl embryos (n = 8) than in wild-type (n = 14; Figures 1I–1K and 1M–1O). However, the thickness of the ventral commissure, stained for Robo3, Dcc or Neurofilament was similar to wild-type (Figures 1I–1K, 1M–1O, and S3A–S3C; n = 8 embryos). The area of the Robo1+ staining, which is expressed in post-crossing commissural axons, was comparable in wild-type and Nes:cre;Ntn1fl/fl E11 embryos (Figures 1L and S3G [n = 8] and Figure 1P [n = 7]). Interestingly, a small, albeit significant fraction of Robo3+ axons invaded the motor columns (Figures S2A, S2B, S2F, S2G, and S3H; n = 6). Therefore, a fraction of commissural axons deviate to the motor columns both in Nes:cre;Ntn1fl/fl and Shh:cre;Ntn1fl/fl embryos, but the ventral commissure is thinner only in Shh:cre;Ntn1fl/fl embryos, suggesting that in Shh:cre;Ntn1fl/fl embryos, either axonal growth is slower or that the trajectory followed by commissural axons to the midline is longer than in Nes:cre;Ntn1fl/fl embryos. This also shows that at E11, the partial reduction of Ntn1 expression in the SC VZ increases commissural axon fasciculation, at least dorsally, but appears to have only a limited effect on their ventral extension. eyJraWQiOiI4ZjUxYWNhY2IzYjhiNjNlNzFlYmIzYWFmYTU5NmZmYyIsImFsZyI6IlJTMjU2In0.eyJzdWIiOiI5NjFlYTdiNWExZmZmN2E4MDk5OTgwZDYxOGRkNGNjNyIsImtpZCI6IjhmNTFhY2FjYjNiOGI2M2U3MWViYjNhYWZhNTk2ZmZjIiwiZXhwIjoxNjc3ODY5MzU5fQ.FYi3S5GM1jbDCQ89jO9_oIw-CzVTMfMr59nmP2nM5N7n0VtjuHF4B30H-e8Jz8Igmm3AGuiB-zc-cBE8QpFRvfzoffNpmKXSzT1eMAfto_CLKPTdp3fsUKHzSX7AwnzEKJ_r34-8DhvVSoW8ZLJeb17S3IXbKMpCzLXAP2trYIqW06F78P7TjT5MDM8uZ35MRHQ4Rz143ajC5smmKChsG8CwwOKO9bu2bSS_m7ojLXzEhWgIpqWVymFhxCXWR1BT3r8DUeS3IuLPyniaJ996i_Ld475_foql-hdnaEv-jJXdwl8seLLkSYkd8JjutEYV2ICLsRUaK8Wwax3WPZMZDQ Download .mp4 (9.66 MB) Help with .mp4 files Video S1. 3D Movie of Cleared Spinal Cords from E11 Wild-Type, Nes:cre;Ntn1fl/fl, and Shh:cre;Ntn1fl/fl Embryos Illustrating the Different Commissural Axon Defects (Robo3 Immunostaining), Related to Figure 1 Many Robo3+ commissural axons cross the midline of Shh:cre;Ntn1fl/fl embryos, which lack netrin-1 at the floor plate (Figures S1N–S1P; n = 5 for each stage), but their trajectories have not been examined in detail. LSFM 3D imaging of E11 Shh:cre;Ntn1fl/fl SCs showed that Robo3+ axons form thin dorsoventral fascicles as in control embryos (Figure 1Q; Video S1; n = 7), but their organization differs at the midline (Figure 1R; n = 7). Unlike in wild-type embryos, Robo3+ axons deviated from a straight dorsoventral path upon reaching the floor plate, and gaps devoid of Robo3+ axons were present within the floor plate (Figure 1R; Video S1). The more vertical trajectory of commissural axons in Shh:cre;Ntn1fl/fl embryos resulted in the overall appearance of the ventral SC commissure axons having a U shape (Figures 1U and 1V; n = 8) rather than the V shape seen in wild-type (Figure 1I–1J). The thickness of the ventral commissure was reduced compared to wild-type embryos (Figures 1U–1W and S3A–S3C). However, the area covered by Robo1+ postcrossing axons was not significantly different from controls, and there was no accumulation of Robo1+ axons within the floor plate, unlike in other midline mutants (Figures 1X and S3G; n = 7) (Long et al., 2004Long H. Sabatier C. Ma L. Plump A. Yuan W. Ornitz D.M. Tamada A. Murakami F. Goodman C.S. Tessier-Lavigne M. Conserved roles for Slit and Robo proteins in midline commissural axon guidance.Neuron. 2004; 42: 213-223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). There was a significant invasion of the motor column by Robo3+ axons (Figures S2K, S2L, and S3H). In wild-type embryos, double immunostaining for Robo3 and netrin-1 showed that netrin-1 protein was present on the floor plate, in VZ progenitor processes extending to the pial surface, and on commissural axons (Figures 1Y and 1Y′). In Shh:cre;Ntn1fl/fl embryos, netrin-1 was ablated from the floor plate but was still very highly expressed in the adjacent region where Robo3+ axons seemed to accumulate (Figures 1Z and 1Z′). Its distribution at the pial surface and VZ appeared unchanged, and it was also present along commissural axons, indicating that these axons might also transport netrin-1 anterogradely (Figure S1Q; n = 5). These data show that many commissural axons still reach the ventral midline in the absence of floor-plate-derived netrin-1 but that their growth in the ventral SC and across the floor plate might be affected. Next, we studied E13 embryos, as new SC commissural neurons are produced until at least E14 (Comer et al., 2015Comer J.D. Pan F.C. Willet S.G. Haldipur P. Millen K.J. Wright C.V.E. Kaltschmidt J.A. Sensory and spinal inhibitory dorsal midline crossing is independent of Robo3.Front. Neural Circuits. 2015; 9: 36Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) (Video S2). In wild-type SC, LSFM imaging showed that Robo3+ axons still formed a well-organized palisade and that Robo3 axon trajectories were straight as they cross the ventral midline (Figures 2A and 2B ; n = 5). The roof plate of the SC did not contain Robo3+ axons (Figures 2C and 2D; n = 5). Interestingly, at this stage, Robo3 axons grew ventrally at various depths within the SC, and many passed through the motor column (Figures 2E and 2F, n = 10), indicating that the avoidance of motor neurons by commissural axons is only a transient feature. In whole mounts of E13 Nes:cre;Ntn1fl/fl SCs, Robo3+ axon trajectories appeared more disorganized, and dorsally, many longitudinal axons were observed together with axons crossing the dorsal midline (Figures 2I–2L; n = 6). At this stage, the thickness of the ventral commissure was significantly reduced in Nes:cre;Ntn1fl/fl embryos compared to wild-type, but only as assessed using Dcc, not Robo3, as a marker (Figures 2E–2H, 2M–2P, and S3D–S3F; n = 7). This could mean that distinct populations of commissural axons are differentially affected by the lack of VZ-derived netrin-1, or it could be explained by the distinct expression time course of Dcc and Robo3, the latter being downregulated just after crossing. As described before in the hindbrain (Moreno-Bravo et al., 2018Moreno-Bravo J.A. Puiggros S.R. Blockus H. Dominici C. Zelina P. Mehlen P. Chédotal A. Commissural neurons transgress the CNS/PNS boundary in absence of ventricular zone-derived netrin-1.Development. 2018; 145 (dev159400)PubMed Google Scholar), a few Robo3+ axons also exited the CNS through the dorsal root ganglia (Video S2). In Shh:cre;Ntn1fl/fl E13 SCs, all Robo3 axons extended to the ventral midline as in wild-type, but as at E11, their path within the floor plate appeared to be perturbed and distorted (Figures 2Q, 2R, and 2T; Video S2; n = 6). The thickness of the ventral commissure was not significantly reduced compared to wild-type SCs (Figures 2U–2X and S3D–S3F; n = 8). To better visualize commissural axon crossing behavior in Shh:cre;Ntn1fl/fl embryos, we injected DiI in the dorsal SC and imaged “open book” preparations. Individual axon trajectories (n = 443 axons from four different wild-type embryos and n = 497 axons from four different Shh:cre;Ntn1fl/fl embryos) were reconstructed with ImageJ (STAR Methods; Video S3). In control SCs, commissural axon trajectories and their floor plate entry points were very precisely aligned, and only ∼1% of axons deviated more than 30 μm from their expected entry point (Figures 3A–3D and 3H ). Only 4% of axons were found to turn on the ipsilateral side (Figure 3D). By contrast, in the SC of Shh:cre;Ntn1fl/fl embryos, many axons went astray (Figures 3D–3F). Overall, there was a significant increase of axons that either grew ipsilaterally (4% in wild-type [WT] versus 14% in Shh:cre;Ntn1fl/fl embryos) or displayed aberrant crossing (3.7% in WT versus 22% in Shh:cre;Ntn1fl/fl embryos), while the proportion of axons that had not yet crossed the floor plate was comparable (Figure 3D). The position of the floor plate entry point was not aligned with the precrossing trajectory for almost 30% of the traced axons, and for 11.6%, the detour exceeded 30 μm (Figures 3D, 3G, and 3H). For these aberrant axons, the mean turning distance where commissural axons deviated from their expected trajectory was at 47 ± 22 μm from the floor plate (n = 78) (Figures 3G and 3I).Figure 3Abnormal Midline Crossing in the Absence of Netrin-1 at the Floor PlateShow full caption(A, B, E, and F) Confocal images of E13 SC open-book preparations of wild-type (A and B) and Shh:cre;Ntn1fl/fl (E and F) embryos injected dorsally with DiI.

Here we describe a high-throughput method to map the functional organization of callosal connectivity by combining in vivo 3D random-access two-photon calcium imaging of the dendritic spines of single V1 neurons with optogenetic stimulation of the presynaptic neural population in the contralateral hemisphere. We find that callosal-recipient spines are more likely to cluster with non-callosal-recipient spines with similar orientation preference. These observations, based on optogenetic stimulation, were confirmed by direct anatomical visualization of callosal synaptic connections using post hoc expansion microscopy. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that functional synaptic clustering in a short dendritic segment could play a role in integrating distinct neuronal circuits."
https://openalex.org/W2910524075,"The role of the hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 (HCA2) in the retinal damage induced by diabetes has never been explored. In this context, the present study highlights an upregulation of retinal HCA2 receptors in diabetic C57BL6J mice. Moreover, we illustrate that HCA2 receptors exert an anti-inflammatory effect on the retinal damage induced by diabetes when activated by the endogenous ligand β-hydroxybutyrate.Seven-to-10-week-old C57BL6J mice were rendered diabetic by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (75 mg/kg of body weight) and monitored intermittently over a 10-week period extending from the initial diabetes assessment. Mice with a fasting blood glucose level higher than 250 mg/dl for 2 consecutive weeks after streptozotocin injection were treated twice a week with intraperitoneal injections of 25-50-100 mg/kg β-hydroxybutyrate.Interestingly, while the retinal endoplasmic reticulum stress markers (pPERK, pIRE1, ATF-6α) were elevated in diabetic C57BL6J mice, their levels were significantly reduced by the systemic intraperitoneal treatment with 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg β-hydroxybutyrate. These mice also exhibited high NLRP3 inflammasome activity and proinflammatory cytokine levels. In fact, the elevated levels of retinal NLRP3 inflammasome activation markers (NLRP3, ASC, caspase-1) and of the relative proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-18) were significantly reduced by 50 mg/kg and 100 mg/kg β-hydroxybutyrate treatment. These doses also reduced the high apoptotic cell number exhibited by the diabetic mice in the retinal outer nuclear layer (ONL) and increased the ONL low connexin 43 expression, leading to an improvement in retinal permeability and homeostasis.These data suggest that the systemic treatment of diabetic C57BL6J mice with BHB activates retinal HCA2 and inhibits local damage."
https://openalex.org/W2909669903,"Advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) survival rates are still low despite advances in cytotoxic and targeted therapies. The development of new effective or alternative therapies is therefore urgently needed. Bromelain, an extract of pineapple, was shown to have anticancer effects, but its mechanisms in CRC have not been fully explored. Therefore, the roles of bromelain in CRC progression were investigated using different CRC cell lines, a zebrafish model, and a xenograft mouse model. The anticancer mechanisms were explored by assessing the role of bromelain in inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS), superoxide, autophagosomes, and lysosomes. The role of bromelain in the induction of apoptosis was also assessed. It was found that bromelain inhibited CRC cell growth in cell lines and tumor growth in the zebrafish and xenograft mouse models. It also induced high levels of ROS and superoxide, plus autophagosome and lysosome formation. High levels of apoptosis were also induced, which were associated with elevated amounts of apoptotic proteins like apoptotic induction factor, Endo G, and caspases-3, -8, and -9 according to a qPCR analysis. In a Western blot analysis, increases in levels of ATG5/12, beclin, p62, and LC3 conversion rates were found after bromelain treatment. Levels of cleaved caspase-3, caspase-8, caspase-9, and poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 increased after bromelain exposure. This study explored the role of bromelain in CRC while giving insights into its mechanisms of action. This compound can offer a cheap alternative to current therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2909699495,"Breaches of research integrity have shocked the academic community. Initially explanations were sought at the level of individual researchers but over time increased recognition emerged of the important role that the research integrity climate may play in influencing researchers' (mis)behavior. In this study we aim to assess whether researchers from different academic ranks and disciplinary fields experience the research integrity climate differently. We sent an online questionnaire to academic researchers in Amsterdam using the Survey of Organizational Research Climate. Bonferroni corrected mean differences showed that junior researchers (PhD students, postdocs and assistant professors) perceive the research integrity climate more negatively than senior researchers (associate and full professors). Junior researchers note that their supervisors are less committed to talk about key research integrity principles compared to senior researchers (MD = -.39, CI = -.55, -.24). PhD students perceive more competition and suspicion among colleagues (MD = -.19, CI = -.35, -.05) than associate and full professors. We found that researchers from the natural sciences overall express a more positive perception of the research integrity climate. Researchers from social sciences as well as from the humanities perceive less fairness of their departments' expectations in terms of publishing and acquiring funding compared to natural sciences and biomedical sciences (MD = -.44, CI = -.74, -.15; MD = -.36, CI = -.61, -.11). Results suggest that department leaders in the humanities and social sciences should do more to set fairer expectations for their researchers and that senior scientists should ensure junior researchers are socialized into research integrity practices and foster a climate in their group where suspicion among colleagues has no place."
https://openalex.org/W2910040244,"Irisin, a recently discovered myokine, has been considered a prognostic factor in several cardiovascular diseases. Nevertheless, no data are available on the role of irisin in patients with heart failure (HF), both with preserved (HFpEF) or reduced (HFrEF) ejection fraction. We have therefore evaluated the circulating irisin levels in HFpEF and HFrEF patients, correlating them with metabolic parameters and total antioxidant capacity (TAC), as index of oxidative stress. Irisin was significantly higher in HFpEF than in HFrEF patients (7.72 ± 0.76 vs 2.77 ± 0.77 ng/ml, respectively). An inverse correlation between irisin and TAC was found in HFpEF, but not in HFrEF. Conversely, no correlation was present with HOMA index. These data support the hypothesis that a different pathophysiological mechanism is involved in the two HF subtypes, and oxidative stress modulates irisin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2909696387,"In interpreting attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, categorical and dimensional approaches are commonly used. Both employ binary symptom counts which give equal weighting, with little attention to the combinations and relative contributions of individual symptoms. Alternatively, symptoms can be viewed as an interacting network, revealing the complex relationship between symptoms. Using a novel network modelling approach, this study explores the relationships between the 18 symptoms in the Diagnostic Statistical Manual (DSM-5) criteria and whether network measures are useful in predicting outcomes. Participants were from a community cohort, the Children’s Attention Project. DSM ADHD symptoms were recorded in a face-to-face structured parent interview for 146 medication naïve children with ADHD and 209 controls (aged 6–8 years). Analyses indicated that not all symptoms are equal. Frequencies of endorsement and configurations of symptoms varied, with certain symptoms playing a more important role within the ADHD symptom network. In total, 116,220 combinations of symptoms within a diagnosis of ADHD were identified, with 92% demonstrating a unique symptom configuration. Symptom association networks highlighted the relative importance of hyperactive/impulsive symptoms in the symptom network. In particular, the ‘motoric’-type symptoms as well as interrupts as a marker of impulsivity in the hyperactive domain, as well as loses things and does not follow instructions in the inattentive domain, had high measures of centrality. Centrality-measure weighted symptom counts showed significant association with clinical but not cognitive outcomes, however the relationships were not significantly stronger than symptom count alone. The finding may help to explain heterogeneity in the ADHD phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2910373168,"The aim of this study was to examine the associations between sedentary behavior and different intensities of physical activity with cardiometabolic risk, and to analyze the simultaneous effect of excess sedentary behavior and recommended levels of physical activity on cardiometabolic risk markers in older adults.We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study on a sample of older adults (60+) living in Florianopolis, Brazil. The objectively measured predictors were sedentary time, light physical activity and moderate to vigorous physical activity, and the outcomes were markers of cardiometabolic risk. Data were considered valid when the participant had used the accelerometer for at least four days per week.The sample included 425 older adults (59.8% women), with a mean age of 73.9 years (95%CI: 73.5-74.4). Sedentary behavior was associated with lower systolic blood pressure levels (β = -0.03; 95%CI: -0.05; -0.01) and lower HDL cholesterol (β = -0.02; 95%CI: -0.02; -0.01). Light physical activity was not associated with any cardiovascular risk markers after adjustment. Each minute spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity was associated with lower waist circumference (β = -0.15; 95%CI: -0.24; -0.05), systolic blood pressure (β = -0.18; 95%CI: -0.32; -0.04) and plasma glucose (β = -0.18; 95%CI: -0.33;-0.02), and with higher HDL cholesterol (β = 0.10; 95%CI: 0.01; 0.18). Moreover, physically inactive and sedentary individuals had a greater mean waist circumference and lower HDL cholesterol than physically active and non-sedentary subjects.The results suggest that moderate to vigorous physical activity have a positive impact on cardiometabolic risk markers in older adults. Light physical activity does not appear to have a beneficial effect on the cardiometabolic markers, and despite the benefits provided by the different intensities of physical activity, the simultaneous presence of sedentary behavior and low physical activity level was associated with poor cardiometabolic risk markers."
https://openalex.org/W2909737102,"A commonly cited reason for the failure of time-area closures to achieve fisheries management goals is the displacement of fishing effort from inside the closure into the surrounding area still open to fishing. Designing time-area closures that are predicted to achieve management goals under multiple spatial patterns of effort redistribution will increase chances of success. Using data from an estuarine gill net fishery, we tested if there are time-area closures predicted to reduce bycatch of two protected species groups while maintaining target catch under four simulated effort redistribution patterns. We found that the pattern of effort redistribution had a substantial impact on the amount of predicted bycatch in each closure scenario. Multiple closures were predicted to reduce bycatch of these species under all four simulations of effort redistribution. However, some combinations of closure and effort redistribution pattern resulted in estimated bycatch being higher than without a closure. We did not find any time-area closures that resulted in a predicted reduction in bycatch while maintaining target catch at original levels. We demonstrate a simple way for fisheries managers to account for the uncertainty in fishers' behavior by designing time-area closures that are predicted to reduce bycatch under multiple potential patterns of spatial redistribution of fishing effort."
https://openalex.org/W2908608762,"Men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately impacted by HIV/AIDS resulting from risky sexual behaviors. Social and contextual factors are known to mediate risk behaviors, but there is limited information about the prevalence of risky sexual practices of Rwandan MSM and the concomitant socio-contextual determinants making it difficult to assess implications for preventing HIV/STI transmission in this key population.Using exploratory qualitative design, we obtained socio-contextual information regarding prevalence of risky sexual behavior and assessed implications for HIV/ STIs transmission and preventive measures taken by MSM to improve sexual health and wellbeing. Thirty MSM were recruited to participate in in-depth interviews using respondent-driven sampling from LGBT associations in Kigali. Data were analyzed using standard qualitative data analysis procedures.Respondents' were between 18-40 years old; all completed primary education and are mostly low-socioeconomic status. Risky sexual practices were common, but differed by peculiar individual and contextual factors. Older MSM often reported occasional sexual relations with women to avoid suspicion and social stigma. Younger MSM's risky sexual practices are mostly transactional and mediated by the need for social acceptance and support. Knowledge of STIs was poor, but prevalence, especially of HPV was high. The options for improving sexual wellbeing are limited and mostly clandestine.Risky sexual behavior of Rwandan MSM has major implications for HIV/STI transmission. An environment of intense social stigma and social isolation makes it difficult to obtain information or services to improve sexual health.

Recently, phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIα (PI4KIIα), which is localized to the trans-Golgi network, was identified as a regulator of Golgi phosphoprotein 3 (GOLPH3) and of vesicle transport in the Golgi apparatus. GOLPH3 is a target of PI4KIIα and helps anchor sialyltransferases and thereby regulates sialylation of cell surface receptors. However, how PI4KIIα-mediated sialyation of cell surface proteins is regulated remains unclear. In this study, using several cell lines, CRISPR/Cas9-based gene knockout and short hairpin RNA–mediated silencing, RT-PCR, lentivirus-mediated overexpression, and immunoblotting methods, we confirmed that PI4KIIα knockdown suppresses the sialylation of N-glycans on the cell surface, in Akt phosphorylation and activation, and integrin α3-mediated cell migration of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Interestingly, both integrin α3β1 and PI4KIIα co-localized to the trans-Golgi network, where they physically interacted with each other, and PI4KIIα specifically associated with integrin α3 but not α5. Furthermore, overexpression of both integrin α3β1 and PI4KIIα induced hypersialylation. Conversely, integrin α3 knockout significantly inhibited the sialylation of membrane proteins, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor, as well as in total cell lysates. These findings suggest that the malignant phenotype of cancer cells is affected by a sialylation mechanism that is regulated by a complex between PI4KIIα and integrin α3β1.

Alteration of the sialylation of glycoproteins has often been observed in several types of malignant tumors, such as those found in breast, ovary, and colorectal cancers (1Christie D.R. Shaikh F.M.

Sialylation is linked via either an α2,3 or an α2,6 bond to Gal/GalNAc and via an α2,8 bond to sialic acid in glycoproteins through a group of sialyltransferases. The up-regulation of cell surface sialic acid is thought to control cell phenotypes such as cell adhesion, migration, immune response, apoptosis, and cell epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). 3The abbreviations used are: EMTepithelial–mesenchymal transitionshRNAshort hairpin RNAPI4Pphosphatidylinositol 4-phosphatePI4Kphosphatidylinositol 4-kinaseTGNtrans-Golgi networkECMextracellular matrixEGFepidermal growth factorPHpleckstrin homologyDOXdoxycyclineKDknockdownSNASambucus nigra agglutininWGAwheat germ agglutininPApyridilaminatedSSASambucus sieboldiana agglutininMAMMaackia amurensis mitogenConAconcanavalin AKOknockoutEGFRepidermal growth factor receptorDMEMDulbecco’s modified Eagle’s mediumFBSfetal bovine serumcDNAcomplementary DNAmRFPmonomeric red fluorescent proteinSALSAsialic acid linkage–specific alkylamidationCtrlcontrol.

The sialylation levels of glycoproteins on the cell surface are mainly determined by sialyltransferase, sialidase, and substrate expression (6Kornfeld R. Kornfeld S. Assembly of asparagine-linked oligosaccharides.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54 (3896128): 631-66410.1146/annurev.bi.54.070185.003215Crossref PubMed Scopus (3775) Google Scholar, 7Grabenhorst E.

Some transcription factors are critical for transcriptional activation of sialytransferases in cancer cells. For example, the expression level of α2,6-galactoside sialyltransferase 1 (ST6GAL1) is up-regulated by the RAS oncogene and increases the α2,6 sialylation of β1 integrins, which promotes integrin-mediated cell migration, adhesion, and cell proliferation (8Dalziel M.

In particular, suppression of GOLPH3 attenuated the levels of cellular sialylation and integrin-dependent cell migration. Furthermore, tumor formation was significantly reduced in mice implanted with GOLPH3 shRNA-expressing cells (11Isaji T. Im S. Gu W. Wang Y. Hang Q. Lu J. Fukuda T. Hashii N. Takakura D. Kawasaki N.

PI4P is mainly catalyzed by phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIα (PI4KIIα), which is localized to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (16Clayton E.L. Minogue S. Waugh M.G. Mammalian phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases as modulators of membrane trafficking and lipid signaling networks.Prog.

Given the importance of GOLPH3 in sialylation and cell functions, it is plausible that PI4P expression at the TGN may influence sialylation. Integrins are heterodimeric cell surface adhesion receptors and major carriers of sialyation. The interaction between integrin and the extracellular matrix (ECM) is essential for cell adhesion, migration, viability, and proliferation (17Park C.C. Zhang H. Pallavicini M. Gray J.W. Baehner F. Park C.J. Bissell M.J. β1 integrin inhibitory antibody induces apoptosis of breast cancer cells, inhibits growth, and distinguishes malignant from normal phenotype in three dimensional cultures and in vivo.Cancer Res. 2006; 66 (16452209): 1526-153510.1158/0008-5472.CAN-05-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 18Takada Y.

In fact, glycosylation is a key regulator that plays important roles in modulating integrin functions. For example, integrin α5β1 binding to fibronectin and integrin-mediated cell spreading and migration are modulated by overexpression of glycosyltransferase genes such as N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III and V or ST6GAL1 (19Lu J.

In addition, sialylated N-glycans on the membrane-proximal domain of integrin β1 play crucial roles in integrin activation and in complex formation between integrin and EGF receptors and syndecan-4 to regulate cell migration and proliferation (22Hou S.

In contrast to the regulation of integrin functions from the extracellular domain, it is well known that integrin function is regulated by its association with cytoplasmic molecules such as focal adhesion kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (23Hynes R.O. Integrins: bidirectional, allosteric signaling machines.Cell. 2002; 110 (12297042): 673-68710.1016/S0092-8674(02)00971-6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6870) Google Scholar, 24Mitra S.K.

In this study, to further understand the underlying mechanism for GOLPH3 expression on sialylation and cell functions, we investigated the effects of PI4KIIα, which is one of the regulators of GOLPH3 in breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells. We found that the sialylation on integrins, Akt phosphorylation, and integrin α3-mediated cell migration all were significantly inhibited in PI4KIIα knockdown cells. It was interesting that overexpression of both PI4KIIα and integrin α3 greatly increased sialylation. Conversely, knockout of integrin α3 significantly inhibited sialylation in membrane proteins. These findings suggest a novel mechanism for sialylation, which suggests a new concept for the regulation of glycosylation in cell biology. We recently reported that the expression of GOLPH3 up-regulated cell surface sialylation and cell migration (11Isaji T. Im S. Gu W. Wang Y. Hang Q. Lu J. Fukuda T. Hashii N. Takakura D. Kawasaki N. Miyoshi H. Gu J. An oncogenic protein Golgi phosphoprotein 3 up-regulates cell migration via sialylation.J. Biol.

However, the molecular mechanism of posttranslational modification of sialylation on the cell surface remains unclear. Considering that GOLPH3 exhibits a highly selective affinity for PI4P that is similar to the canonical pleckstrin homology (PH) domain in the TGN (33Moravcevic K. Oxley C.L. Lemmon M.A. Conditional peripheral membrane proteins: facing up to limited specificity.Structure. 2012; 20 (22193136): 15-2710.1016/j.str.2011.11.012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that the expression of PI4P in the TGN could affect sialylation and cell properties. PI4P is produced mainly by PI4Ks, which are classified as type II and III according to their sensitivity to inhibitors (30D'Angelo G. Vicinanza M. Di Campli A. De Matteis M.A. The multiple roles of PtdIns4P: not just the precursor of PtdIns4,5P-2.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121 (18525025): 1955-196310.1242/jcs.023630Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). PI4KIIIβ is enriched in early Golgi compartments, whereas PI4KIIα is localized mainly in the TGN and in the endosome (16Clayton E.L. Minogue S. Waugh M.G. Mammalian phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases as modulators of membrane trafficking and lipid signaling networks.Prog. Lipid Res. 2013; 52 (23608234): 294-30410.1016/j.plipres.2013.04.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), where sialyltransferases also are localized (34Rabouille C. Hui N. Hunte F. Kieckbusch R. Berger E.G. Warren G. Nilsson T. Mapping the distribution of Golgi enzymes involved in the construction of complex oligosaccharides.J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108 (7615680): 1617-1627Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, PI4KIIα is a dominant PI4K in mammalian cells (35Lu D. Sun H.Q. Wang H. Barylko B. Fukata Y. Fukata M. Albanesi J.P. Yin H.L. Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIα is palmitoylated by Golgi-localized palmitoyltransferases in cholesterol-dependent manner.J. Biol.

Therefore, we chose PI4KIIα for functional analysis, and established a line of doxycycline (DOX)–controlled PI4KIIα silencing in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. First, we verified the expression levels of PI4KIIα and sialyltransferases (ST3GAL3, ST3GAL4, and ST6GAL1) that involve major sialylated N-glycans (36Bhide G.P. Colley K.J. Sialylation of N-glycans: mechanism, cellular compartmentalization and function.Histochem. Cell Biol. 2017; 147 (27975143): 149-17410.1007/s00418-016-1520-xCrossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). RT-PCR analysis showed that the expression levels of PI4KIIα mRNA were significantly decreased in knockdown cells, whereas the expression levels of ST6GAL1 for α2,6 sialylation and those of ST3GAL3 and ST3GAL4 for α2,3 sialylation were all similar in both cells (Fig. 1A). Second, we verified the expression levels and the distributions of PI4P in KD cells. The PH domain of four-phosphate adaptor protein 1 (FAPP1), which preferentially recognizes PI4P, is known for its use as a monitor for PI4P distribution (37Balla A. Tuymetova G. Tsiomenko A. Várnai P. Balla T. A plasma membrane pool of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate is generated by phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type-IIIα: studies with the PH domains of the oxysterol binding protein and FAPP1.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16 (15635101): 1282-129510.1091/mbc.e04-07-0578Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In control cells, PI4P was localized near the medial Golgi marker GM130, as expected (Fig. 1B). In contrast, PI4P staining was significantly decreased in knockdown (KD) cells (Fig. 1B). These data confirmed that PI4KIIα is mainly involved in the synthesis and localization of PI4P in the TGN, which agrees with previous reports (35Lu D. Sun H.Q. Wang H. Barylko B. Fukata Y. Fukata M. Albanesi J.P. Yin H.L. Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIα is palmitoylated by Golgi-localized palmitoyltransferases in cholesterol-dependent manner.J. Biol.

Next, we tested whether decreased PI4P affects sialylation expression on the cell surface. As shown in Fig. 1C, top panels, the intensities of the staining in KD cells with Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) lectin, which preferentially recognizes α2,6 sialylation of glycoproteins, was weaker than that in control cells. However, the intensities of staining with WGA lectin, which preferentially recognizes GlcNAc residues and hybrid-type and lactohexose N-glycans (38Itakura Y. Nakamura-Tsuruta S. Kominami J. Tateno H.

Sci. 2017; 18 (28556796)E116010.3390/ijms18061160Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), were almost equal in both cells (Fig. 1C, bottom panels). These data suggested that the expression levels of sialylated glycans were decreased in KD cells. Furthermore, the decrease was confirmed by quantitative analysis using HPLC. Total pyridylaminated (PA) N-glycans of cells were examined via anion exchange chromatography, and the ratios of sialylated N-glycans versus total N-glycans were calculated. The expression levels of sialylated N-glycans were significantly suppressed in KD cells (Fig. 1D). A similar change in α2,6 sialylation on specific membrane proteins such as integrin β1 was also consistently observed (Fig. 1E) using Sambucus sieboldiana agglutinin (SSA)–agarose. These data suggest that the expression levels of PI4P in the TGN are important for sialylation. Alterations in N-glycosylation affect many cellular events involved in cellular signaling and cell migration. Here we examined the effects of PI4KIIα KD on cell migration and Akt activation. As shown in Fig. 2A, cell migration on laminin-332 in a Transwell assay was significantly reduced in KD cells compared with control cells. The expression levels of integrin α3β1, a major receptor for laminin-332 and α5β1 on the cell surface were similar in both cells (Fig. 2B). Activation of Akt is required for integrin-mediated cell migration (39Grottke A. Ewald F. Lange T. Nörz D. Herzberger C. Bach J. Grabinski N. Gräser L. Höppner F. Nashan B. Schumacher U. Jücker M. Downregulation of AKT3 Increases migration and metastasis in triple negative breast cancer cells by upregulating S100A4.PLoS ONE. 2016; 11 (26741489)e014637010.1371/journal.pone.0146370Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2C, the level of phosphorylated Akt was apparently decreased in KD cells compared with control cells. These data suggest that PI4P in the TGN plays an important role in Akt activation and in integrin α3–mediated cell migration. As described above, PI4KIIα regulated sialylation and the integrin α3–mediated phenotype. Therefore, we examined the interaction between PI4KIIα and integrin α3 in the Golgi apparatus. First, we used immunostaining to assess the intracellular distributions of PI4KIIα and α3. Immunostaining showed that PI4KIIα was localized in the vicinity of GM130 and that it was extensively co-localized with integrin α3 (Fig. 3A). Notably, co-immunoprecipitation with anti-integrin β1 showed that it was α3, rather than α5, that interacted with PI4KIIα in 293T cell stable expression of PI4KIIα and/or either integrin α3 or α5 (Fig. 3B). The interaction between PI4KIIα and α3 was further reciprocally confirmed by immunoprecipitation with either anti-α3 antibody (Fig. 3C) or anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 3D). Next we wondered whether this interaction was required for efficient sialylation. To address this question, we precipitated those cell lysates with SSA or Maackia amurensis mitogen (MAM) agarose, which preferentially recognize α2,6-sialylated and α2,3-sialylated N-glycans, respectively, and then performed Western blotting against integrin β1. Interestingly, both sialylated N-glycans were up-regulated on integrin β1 in cells that expressed both PI4KIIα and integrin α3 but not in those that expressed PI4KIIα and α5 (Fig. 3E, top and center panels). In contrast to SSA or MAM lectin blotting, ConA lectin blots showed a similar level in both integrin α3- and α5-expressing cells (Fig. 3E, bottom panel). ConA lectin equally recognized both mature and immature forms of integrin β1 in α3-expressing cells but only the most immature form of β1 in α5-expressing cells. These data further suggest the importance of α3 for sialylation. Data obtained from flow cytometry analysis via MAM lectin consistently supported this observation, although SSA lectin showed no significant changes in these cells (Fig. 3F). Therefore, these results clearly suggest that intracellular complex formation between PI4KIIα and α3 regulates the biosynthesis of sialylated N-glycans. To further verify the importance of complex formation between PI4KIIα and integrin α3 for cellular sialylation, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to construct an integrin α3 knockout (KO) MDA-MB-231 cell line. Flow cytometric analysis revealed a KO efficiency of more than 95% (Fig. 4A), which also was confirmed by Western blotting with anti-integrin α3 (Fig. 4B). Notably, the band mobility of integrin β1 on SDS-PAGE in KO cells was faster than in the control cells, suggesting that integrin α3 deficiency leads to an accumulation of the immature β1 form without sialylation. It is well known that integrin α3 is important for laminin-mediated cell adhesion, migration, and several forms of cellular signaling (40Mitchell K. Svenson K.B. Longmate W.M. Gkirtzimanaki K.

The objective of this study was to clarify the relationships between muscle mass, intramuscular fat, and body weight in chronic stroke survivors. Methods Seventy-two chronic stroke survivors participated in this study. Transverse ultrasound images were acquired using B-mode ultrasound imaging. Quadriceps muscle mass and intramuscular fat were assessed based on muscle thickness and echo intensity, respectively. We used a stepwise multiple regression analysis to identify the factors that were independently associated with the body mass index. We entered quadriceps thickness and echo intensity of the paretic and non-paretic sides into another stepwise multiple regression model to avoid multicollinearity. Age, sex, type of stroke, time since stroke, thigh length, number of medications, and an updated Charlson comorbidity index were included as the independent variables. Results The quadriceps thickness and echo intensity of the paretic and non-paretic sides were significantly independently associated with the body mass index: quadriceps thickness of the paretic side, β = 0.52; quadriceps thickness of the non-paretic side, β = 0.55; quadriceps echo intensity of the paretic side, β = −0.35; quadriceps echo intensity of the non-paretic side, β = −0.27). Conclusions Our results suggest that low body mass index is associated with loss of muscle mass and increased intramuscular fat on both the paretic and non-paretic sides of chronic stroke survivors. Further studies examining whether appropriate weight management, along with targeted rehabilitation programs aimed at increasing muscle mass and decreasing intramuscular fat, achieves good outcomes in chronic stroke survivors are warranted."
https://openalex.org/W2910100149,"The HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases has been linked to deregulation of growth and proliferation for multiple types of cancer. Members have therefore become thefocus of many drug and immune-based therapy innovations. The targeted anti-cancer agent, lapatinib, is a small molecule inhibitor that directly interferes with EGFR (HER-1)and HER-2 signaling, and indirectly reduces HER-3 signaling, thus suppressing important downstream events. A recently-developed dendritic cell-based vaccine against early breast cancer (ductal carcinoma in situ; DCIS) that generates strong Th1-dominated immunity against HER-2 has induced pathologic complete response in about one-third of immunized individuals. In vitro studies suggested cytokines secreted by Th1 cells could be major contributors to the vaccine effects including induction of apoptosis and suppression of HER expression. With a view toward improving complete response rates, we investigated whether the principle Th1 cytokines (IFN-γ and TNF-α) could act in concert with lapatinib to suppress activity of breast cancer lines in vitro. Lapatinib-sensitive SKBR3, MDA-MB-468 and BT474 cells were incubated with Th1 cytokines, lapatinib, or both. It was found that combined treatment maximized metabolic suppression(Alamar Blue assay), as well as cell death (Trypan Blue) and apoptosis(Annexin V/Propidium Iodide and TMRE staining). Combined drug plus cytokine treatment also maximized suppression of both total and phosphorylated forms of HER-2 and HER-3. Interestingly, when lapatinib resistant lines MDA-MB-453 and JIMT-1 were tested, it was found that the presence of Th1 cytokines appeared to enhance sensitivity for lapatinib-induced metabolic suppression and induction of apoptotic cell death, nearly abrogating drug resistance. These studies provide pre-clinical data suggesting the possibility that targeted drug therapy may be combined with vaccination to enhance anti-cancer effects, and furthermore that robust immunity in the form of secreted Th1 cytokines may have the capacity to mitigate resistance to targeted drugs."

CAV infects bone marrow-derived cells, resulting in severe anaemia and immunosuppression in young chickens and a compromised immune response in older birds. We investigated the molecular epidemiology of CAV in sick chickens in China from 2014 to 2015 and showed that the CAV-positive rate was 13.30%, in which mixed infection (55.56%) was the main type of infection. We isolated and identified 15 new CAV strains using different methods including indirect immunofluorescence assay and Western Blotting. We used overlapping polymerase chain reaction to map the whole genome of the strains. Phylogenetic analyses of the obtained sequences and related sequences available in GenBank generated four distinct groups (A–D). We built phylogenetic trees using predicted viral protein (VP) sequences. Unlike CAV VP2s and VP3s that were well conserved, the diversity of VP1s indicated that the new strains were virulent. Our epidemiological study provided new insights into the prevalence of CAV in clinical settings in recent years in China."

However, exotic species can also offer resources to native species, especially within highly modified environments such as urban ecosystems. We studied 17 exotic-native pairs of species with the potential to compete with one another, or in which one of the species could offer resources to the other, in an urban ecological reserve located within Mexico City. We used two-species occupancy models to analyze the potential association between the presence of the exotic species and the spatial distribution of the native species, as well as to assess if these species tend to avoid each other (negative spatial interaction) or to co-occur more often than expected under the hypothesis of independent occurrences (positive spatial interaction). Our results revealed few cases in which the exotic species influenced occupancy of the native species, and these spatial interactions were mainly positive, indicated by the fact that the occupancy of the native species was usually higher when the exotic species was also present. Seven of the eight observed non-independent patterns of co-occurrence were evident during the dry months of the year, when resources become scarce for most species. Our results also demonstrate that the observed patterns of species co-occurrence depend on the distance to the nearest urban structure and the amount of herb, shrub, and tree cover, indicating that these habitat features influence whether native species avoid or co-occur with exotic species. Our study represents an important contribution to the understanding of temporal dynamics in the co-occurrence between exotic and native species within urban ecological reserves."

Interestingly, iron deficiency and overload disorders do not result in increased intestinal expression of glycolytic or angiogenic HIF2α target genes. Similarly, inflammatory and tumor foci can induce a distinct subset of HIF2α target genes in vivo. These observations indicate that different stimuli activate distinct subsets of HIF2α target genes via mechanisms that remain unclear. Here, we conducted a high-throughput siRNA-based screen to identify genes that regulate HIF2α's transcriptional activity on the promoter of the iron transporter gene divalent metal transporter-1 (DMT1). SMAD family member 3 (SMAD3) and SMAD4 were identified as potential transcriptional repressors. Further analysis revealed that SMAD4 signaling selectively represses iron-absorptive gene promoters but not the inflammatory or glycolytic HIF2α or HIF1α target genes. Moreover, the highly homologous SMAD2 did not alter HIF2α transcriptional activity. During iron deficiency, SMAD3 and SMAD4 expression was significantly decreased via proteasomal degradation, allowing for derepression of iron target genes. Several iron-regulatory genes contain a SMAD-binding element (SBE) in their proximal promoters; however, mutation of the putative SBE on the DMT1 promoter did not alter the repressive function of SMAD3 or SMAD4. Importantly, the transcription factor forkhead box protein A1 (FOXA1) was critical in SMAD4-induced DMT1 repression, and DNA binding of SMAD4 was essential for the repression of HIF2α activity, suggesting an indirect repressive mechanism through DNA binding.

https://openalex.org/W2908992062,"It is estimated that around five to 10.0% of hospital admissions occur due to clinical conditions resulting from pharmacotherapy. Clinical pharmacist's activity can enhance drug therapy's effectiveness and safety through pharmacotherapy interventions (PIs), thus minimizing drug-related problems (DRPs) and optimizing the allocation of financial resources associated with health care. This study aimed to estimate the DRPs prevalence, evaluate PI which were performed by clinical pharmacists in the Neurology Unit of a Brazilian tertiary teaching hospital and to identify factors associated with the occurrence of PI-related DRP. A single-arm trial included adults admitted in the referred Unit from 2012 July to 2015 June. Patients were evaluated during their hospitalization period and PIs were performed based on trigger DRPs that were detected in medication reconciliation (admission or discharge) or during inpatient follow-up. Student's t-test, Chi-square test, Pearson and Multiple logistic regression models to analise the association among age, number of drugs, hospitalization period, and number of diagnoses with occurrence of DRPs. Analyses level of significance was 5%. In total 409 inpatients were followed up [51.1% male, mean age of 49.1 (SD 16.5)]. Patients received, on average, 11.9 (SD 5.8) drugs, ranging from two to 38 drugs per patient, and 54.3% of the sample presented at least one DRP whose most frequent description was ""untreated condition"". From all 516 performed PIs that resulted from DRPs, 82.8% were accepted and the majority referred to ""drug introduction"" (27.5%). Multiple logistic regression showed that age, length of hospital stay, number of drugs used, diagnosis of epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and myasthenia gravis would be clinical variables associated with DRP (p < 0,05). Monitoring the use of drugs allowed the clinical pharmacist to detect DRPs and to suggest interventions that promote rational pharmacotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2909001657,"Legal theorists have characterized physical evidence of brain dysfunction as a double-edged sword, wherein the very quality that reduces the defendant's responsibility for his transgression could simultaneously increase motivations to punish him by virtue of his apparently increased dangerousness. However, empirical evidence of this pattern has been elusive, perhaps owing to a heavy reliance on singular measures that fail to distinguish between plural, often competing internal motivations for punishment. The present study employed a test of the theorized double-edge pattern using a novel approach designed to separate such motivations. We asked a large sample of participants (N = 330) to render criminal sentencing judgments under varying conditions of the defendant's mental health status (Healthy, Neurobiological Disorder, Psychological Disorder) and the disorder's treatability (Treatable, Untreatable). As predicted, neurobiological evidence simultaneously elicited shorter prison sentences (i.e., mitigating) and longer terms of involuntary hospitalization (i.e., aggravating) than equivalent psychological evidence. However, these effects were not well explained by motivations to restore treatable defendants to health or to protect society from dangerous persons but instead by deontological motivations pertaining to the defendant's level of deservingness and possible obligation to provide medical care. This is the first study of its kind to quantitatively demonstrate the paradoxical effect of neuroscientific trial evidence and raises implications for how such evidence is presented and evaluated."

Moreover, HBV infection elevated SH2D5 levels, and we observed that HBx plays an important role in SH2D5 induction.

Employing SH2D5 overexpression or knockdown, we further demonstrate that SH2D5 promotes HCC cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. While investigating the mechanism of SH2D5-mediated stimulation of HCC cell proliferation, we noted that HBV induces SH2D5 binding to transketolase (TKT), a pentose phosphate pathway enzyme, thereby promoting an interaction between and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Furthermore, HBx stimulated STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr-705 and promoted the activity and downstream signaling pathway of STAT3 via the SH2D5–TKT interaction.

Several invasive bacteria have been shown to exploit normal platelet function during infection. Due to their inherent ability to interact with and influence other cell types, platelets play a critical role in alteration of endothelial barrier permeability, and their role in cancer metastasis has been well established. The highly invasive bacterium and causative agent of syphilis, Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum, readily crosses the endothelial, blood-brain and placental barriers. However, the mechanisms underlying this unusual and important aspect of T. pallidum pathogenesis are incompletely understood. In this study we use darkfield microscopy in combination with flow cytometry to establish that T. pallidum interacts with platelets. We also investigate the dynamics of this interaction and show T. pallidum is able to activate platelets and preferentially interacts with activated platelets. Platelet-interacting treponemes consistently exhibit altered kinematic (movement) parameters compared to free treponemes, and T. pallidum-platelet interactions are reversible. This study provides insight into host cell interactions at play during T. pallidum infection and suggests that T. pallidum may exploit platelet function to aid in establishment of disseminated infection."
https://openalex.org/W2950988568,"Sanfilippo syndrome type B (Sanfilippo B; Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB) occurs due to genetic deficiency of lysosomal alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU) and subsequent lysosomal accumulation of heparan sulfate (HS), which coincides with devastating neurodegenerative disease. Because NAGLU expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells is not mannose-6-phosphorylated, we developed an insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2)-tagged NAGLU molecule (BMN 250; tralesinidase alfa) that binds avidly to the IGF2 / cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) for glycosylation independent lysosomal targeting. BMN 250 is currently being developed as an investigational enzyme replacement therapy for Sanfilippo B. Here we distinguish two cellular uptake mechanisms by which BMN 250 is targeted to lysosomes. In normal rodent-derived neurons and astrocytes, the majority of BMN250 uptake over 24 hours reaches saturation, which can be competitively inhibited with IGF2, suggestive of CI-MPR-mediated uptake. Kuptake, defined as the concentration of enzyme at half-maximal uptake, is 5 nM and 3 nM in neurons and astrocytes, with a maximal uptake capacity (Vmax) corresponding to 764 nmol/hr/mg and 5380 nmol/hr/mg, respectively. Similar to neurons and astrocytes, BMN 250 uptake in Sanfilippo B patient fibroblasts is predominantly CI-MPR-mediated, resulting in augmentation of NAGLU activity with doses of enzyme that fall well below the Kuptake (5 nM), which are sufficient to prevent HS accumulation. In contrast, uptake of the untagged recombinant human NAGLU (rhNAGLU) enzyme in neurons, astrocytes and fibroblasts is negligible at the same doses tested. In microglia, receptor-independent uptake, defined as enzyme uptake resistant to competition with excess IGF2, results in appreciable lysosomal delivery of BMN 250 and rhNAGLU (Vmax = 12,336 nmol/hr/mg and 5469 nmol/hr/mg, respectively). These results suggest that while receptor-independent mechanisms exist for lysosomal targeting of rhNAGLU in microglia, BMN 250, by its IGF2 tag moiety, confers increased CI-MPR-mediated lysosomal targeting to neurons and astrocytes, two additional critical cell types of Sanfilippo B disease pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2910948422,"Cantharidin (CTD) is a potent anticancer small molecule produced by several species of blister beetle. It has been a traditional medicine for the management of warts and tumors for many decades. CTD suppresses tumor growth by inducing apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and DNA damage and inhibits protein phosphatase 2 phosphatase activator (PP2A) and protein phosphatase 1 (PP1). CTD also alters lipid homeostasis, cell wall integrity, endocytosis, adhesion, and invasion in yeast cells. In this study, we identified additional molecular targets of CTD using a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain that expresses a cantharidin resistance gene (CRG1), encoding a SAM-dependent methyltransferase that methylates and inactivates CTD. We found that CTD specifically affects phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-associated functions that can be rescued by supplementing the growth media with ethanolamine (ETA). CTD also perturbed endoplasmic reticulum (ER) homeostasis and cell wall integrity by altering the sorting of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins. A CTD-dependent genetic interaction profile of CRG1 revealed that the activity of the lipid phosphatase cell division control protein 1 (Cdc1) in GPI-anchor remodeling is the key target of CTD, independently of PP2A and PP1 activities. Moreover, experiments with human cells further suggested that CTD functions through a conserved mechanism in higher eukaryotes. Altogether, we conclude that CTD induces cytotoxicity by targeting Cdc1 activity in GPI-anchor remodeling in the ER."

The study involved 15 triathletes whose objective for the season was to start in the XTERRA POLAND 2017 event (1,500-m swimming, 36-km cycling, and 10-km mountain running). Before the 14-week preparatory period, the competitors' body composition was measured, aerobic capacity was tested (graded treadmill test) and blood samples were collected to determine markers showing the level of muscle and intestinal damage. Subsequent tests for body composition were carried out before and after the competition. Blood samples for biochemical indicators were collected the day before the competition, after the completed race, and 24 and 48 hours later. A significant decrease in body mass was observed after completing the race (-3.1±1.5%). The mean maximal oxygen uptake level among the studied athletes equalled 4.9±0.4 L·min-1, 58.8±4.5 mL·kg-1·min-1. The significant increase in concentrations of cortisol, c-reactive protein and myoglobin after the competition, significantly correlated with the significant increase in zonulin concentration (post 1h: r = 0.88, p = 0.007, r = 0,79, p = 0.001, r = 0.78, p = 0.001, and post 12h: r = 0.75, p = 0.01, r = 0.71, p = 0.011, r = 0.83, p = 0.02). No significant changes in the concentration of tumour necrosis factor alpha among the examined competitors were noted at following stages of the study. The results of our research showed that in order to monitor overload in the training of triathletes, useful markers reflecting the degree of muscle and intestinal damage include cortisol, testosterone, testosterone to cortisol ratio, c-reactive protein, myoglobin and zonulin. Changes in muscle cell damage markers strongly correlated with changes in zonulin concentration at particular stages of the study. Thus, one can expect that the concentrations of markers depicting the level of muscle cell damage after an intense and long-lasting effort will significantly influence the level of the intestinal barrier."

By mediating inter- and intramolecular interactions, they regulate the functions of many proteins involved in a wide variety of signal transduction pathways. Phosphorylation at different tyrosine residues in SH3 domains has been reported previously. In several cases, the functional consequences have also been investigated. However, a full understanding of the effects of tyrosine phosphorylation on the ligand interactions and cellular functions of SH3 domains requires detailed structural, atomic-resolution studies along with biochemical and biophysical analyses. Here, we present the first crystal structures of tyrosine-phosphorylated human SH3 domains derived from the Abelson-family kinases ABL1 and ABL2 at 1.6 and 1.4 A resolutions, respectively. The structures revealed that simultaneous phosphorylation of Tyr89 and Tyr134 in ABL1 or the homologous residues Tyr116 and Tyr161 in ABL2 induces only minor structural perturbations. Instead, the phosphate groups sterically blocked the ligand-binding grooves, thereby strongly inhibiting the interaction with proline-rich peptide ligands. Although some crystal contact surfaces involving phosphotyrosines suggested the possibility of tyrosine phosphorylation–induced dimerization, we excluded this possibility by using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and NMR relaxation analyses. Extensive analysis of relevant databases and literature revealed not only that the residues phosphorylated in our model systems are well-conserved in other human SH3 domains, but that the corresponding tyrosines are known phosphorylation sites in vivo in many cases. We conclude that tyrosine phosphorylation might be a mechanism involved in the regulation of the human SH3 interactome."

The control group did not receive any didactic session on patient safety. In both groups we measured technical knowledge and attitudes towards patient safety before the intervention (T0), directly after the intervention (T1) and one year after the intervention (T2). Participants were 309 third-year medical students in the intervention group and 154 first- and second-year medical students in the control group.Technical knowledge in the intervention group (but not the control group) improved significantly after the intervention and remained high after one year (F(2, 84) = 13.506, p < .001, η2 = .243). Students of the intervention group felt better prepared for safe patient practice, even one year after the intervention F(2, 85) = 6.743, p < .002, η2 = .137). There was no sustainable significant effect on attitudes towards patient safety.This study shows, that eLearning interventions can produce significant long-term effects on patient safety knowledge, however, the study did not show long-term effects on attitudes towards patient safety.

They are in most cases not synthesized in their target location and hence need to be transported to the site of action, by for instance ATP-binding cassette transporters. Within the ATP-binding cassette transporter family, Pleiotropic Drug Resistance transporters are known to be involved in phytohormone transport. Interestingly, PDRs are only present in plants and fungi. In contrast to fungi, there are few biochemical studies of plant PDRs and one major reason is that suitable overexpression systems have not been identified. In this study, we evaluate the expression system Pichia pastoris for heterologous overexpression of PDR genes of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We successfully cloned and expressed the potential phytohormone transporters PDR2 and PDR8 in P. pastoris. Sucrose gradient centrifugation confirmed that the overexpressed proteins were correctly targeted to the plasma membrane of P. pastoris and initial functional studies demonstrated ATPase activity for WBC1. However, difficulties in cloning and heterologous overexpression might be particular obstacles of the PDR family, since cloning and overexpression of White Brown Complex 1, a half-size transporter of the same ABCG subfamily with comparable domain organization, was more easily achieved. We present strategies and highlight critical factors to successfully clone plant PDR genes and heterologously expressed in P. pastoris."

https://openalex.org/W2910838897,"Congenital glaucoma (CG) is a severe and inherited childhood optical neuropathy that leads to irreversible visual loss and blindness in children. CG pathogenesis remains largely unexplained in most patients. Herein we have extended our previous studies to evaluate the role of FOXC2 and PITX2 variants in CG. Variants of the proximal promoter and transcribed sequence of these two genes were analyzed by Sanger sequencing in a cohort of 133 CG families. To investigate possible oligogenic inheritance involving FOXC2 or PITX2 and CYP1B1, we also analyzed FOXC2 and PITX2 variants in a group of 25 CG cases who were known to carry CYP1B1 glaucoma-associated genotypes. The functional effect of three identified variants was assessed by transactivation luciferase reporter assays, protein stability and subcellular localization analyses. We found eight probands (6.0%) who carried four rare FOXC2 variants in the heterozygous state. In addition, we found an elevated frequency (8%) of heterozygous and rare PITX2 variants in the group of CG cases who were known to carry CYP1B1 glaucoma-associated genotypes, and one of these PITX2 variants arose de novo. To the best of our knowledge, two of the identified variants (FOXC2: c.1183C>A, p.(H395N); and PITX2: c.535C>A, p.(P179T)) have not been previously identified. Examination of the genotype-phenotype correlation in this group suggests that the presence of the infrequent PITX2 variants increase the severity of the phenotype. Transactivation reporter analyses showed partial functional alteration of three identified amino acid substitutions (FOXC2: p.(C498R) and p.(H395N); PITX2: p.(P179T)). In summary, the increased frequency in PCG patients of rare FOXC2 and PITX2 variants with mild functional alterations, suggests they play a role as putative modifier factors in this disease further supporting that CG is not a simple monogenic disease and provides novel insights into the complex pathological mechanisms that underlie CG."
https://openalex.org/W2908882356,"Objective The objective is to present a proof-of-concept of a semi-automatic method to reduce hippocampus segmentation time on magnetic resonance images (MRI). Materials and methods FAst Segmentation Through SURface Fairing (FASTSURF) is based on a surface fairing technique which reconstructs the hippocampus from sparse delineations. To validate FASTSURF, simulations were performed in which sparse delineations extracted from full manual segmentations served as input. On three different datasets with different diagnostic groups, FASTSURF hippocampi were compared to the original segmentations using Jaccard overlap indices and percentage volume differences (PVD). In one data set for which back-to-back scans were available, unbiased estimates of overlap and PVD were obtained. Using longitudinal scans, we compared hippocampal atrophy rates measured by manual, FASTSURF and two automatic segmentations (FreeSurfer and FSL-FIRST). Results With only seven input contours, FASTSURF yielded mean Jaccard indices ranging from 72(±4.3)% to 83(±2.6)% and PVDs ranging from 0.02(±2.40)% to 3.2(±3.40)% across the three datasets. Slightly poorer results were obtained for the unbiased analysis, but the performance was still considerably better than both tested automatic methods with only five contours. Conclusions FASTSURF segmentations have high accuracy and require only a fraction of the delineation effort of fully manual segmentation. Atrophy rate quantification based on completely manual segmentation is well reproduced by FASTSURF. Therefore, FASTSURF is a promising tool to be implemented in clinical workflow, provided a future prospective validation confirms our findings."

The aim of this study was to identify significant variants that enhanced personal risk prediction for oral malignancy. A total of 360 patients diagnosed with oral squamous cell carcinoma, 486 controls and 17 newly diagnosed patients with OPMD including leukoplakia or oral submucous fibrosis were recruited. Fifteen tagSNPs which were derived from somatic mutations were genotyped and examined in associations with the occurrence of oral malignancy. Environmental variables along with the SNPs data were used to developed risk predictive models for oral malignancy occurrence. The stepwise model analysis was conducted to fit the best model in an economically efficient way. Two tagSNPs, rs28647489 in FAT1 gene and rs550675 in COL9A1 gene, were significantly associated with the risk of oral malignancy. The sensitivity and specificity were 85.7% and 85.5%, respectively (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.91) for predicting oral squamous cell carcinoma occurrence with the combined genetic variants, betel-quid, alcohol and age. The AUC for OPMD was only 0.69. The predictive probability of squamous cell carcinoma occurrence for genetic risk score without substance use increased from 10% up to 43%; with substance use increased from 73% up to 92%. Genetic variants with or without substance use may enhance risk prediction for oral malignancy occurrence in male population. The prediction model may be useful as a clinical index for oral malignancy occurrence and its risk assessments."

To better define the Rab5–p110β interface, we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis and analyzed Rab5 binding with an in vitro pulldown assay with GST-Rab5GTP. Of the 35 p110β helical domain mutants assayed, 11 disrupted binding to Rab5 without affecting Rac1 binding, basal lipid kinase activity, or Gβγ-stimulated kinase activity. These mutants defined the Rab5-binding interface within p110β as consisting of two perpendicular α-helices in the helical domain that are adjacent to the initially identified Gln596 and Ile597 residues. Analysis of the Rab5–PI3Kβ interaction by hydrogen-deuterium exchange MS identified p110β peptides that overlap with these helices; no interactions were detected between Rab5 and other regions of p110β or p85α. Similarly, the binding of Rab5 to isolated p85α could not be detected, and mutations in the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of p110β had no effect on Rab5 binding.

Our lab initially identified a region of p110β that mediates binding to Rab5 using a conservation-based approach.

The purpose of the present study was to fully define the Rab5-binding interface within p110β to understand the physiological role of this interaction. Using a GST-Rab5 in vitro pulldown assay and hydrogen-deuterium exchange MS, we identified a discrete binding site for Rab5 in the helical domain of p110β. We were unable to replicate previous reports showing direct binding of Rab5 to p85 or to the RBD of p110β (14Chamberlain M.D. Berry T.R. Pastor M.C. Anderson D.H.

The Rab5-binding interface within p110β is restricted to two perpendicular α-helices in the helical domain that are located near the Gβγ-binding loop. In vitro kinase assays revealed that soluble Rab5 does not affect PI3Kβ kinase activity. However, replacement of endogenous PI3Kβ with a Rab5 binding–deficient mutant in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells inhibited chemotaxis, invasion, and gelatin degradation. Our characterization of the physiologically important Rab5–p110β interface will facilitate the development of better tools to study the Rab5–PI3Kβ interaction in cell-based and animal models. To define the Rab5-binding interface within p110β (PI3Kβ), we first examined whether p110β selectively bound to any of the three Rab5 isoforms (A, B, and C), which have been shown to have distinct cellular roles (8Chiariello M.

Using lysates from HEK293T cells expressing wild type (WT) PI3Kβ heterodimer and an in vitro pulldown assay, we were unable to detect any difference in PI3Kβ binding to the three Rab5 isoforms (data not shown). We opted to use Rab5A for the remainder of the study as this isoform was previously used by our lab and by others in studies examining the Rab5–p110β interaction (13Salamon R.S. Dbouk H.A. Collado D.

HEK293T cells were transfected with p85α alone or with either WT p110β or the previously reported Rab5-uncoupled p110β mutant I597S (13Salamon R.S. Dbouk H.A. Collado D. Lopiccolo J. Bresnick A.R.

The lysates from these cells were incubated with nucleotide-loaded Rab5A beads and assessed for binding by immunoblotting. The WT p110β/p85α heterodimer exhibited selective binding to GTPγS–Rab5A (12-fold over GDP–Rab5), whereas the Rab5-uncoupled p110β I597S heterodimer failed to bind to either form of Rab5A (Fig. 1B). In contrast to previous reports that Rab5 binds to p85α (14Chamberlain M.D. Berry T.R. Pastor M.C. Anderson D.H. The p85α subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase binds to and stimulates the GTPase activity of Rab proteins.J. Biol.

Similarly, we detected no binding to p85α in the context of the I597S p110β/p85α heterodimer. These data show that p110β is solely responsible for the Rab5A interaction. We previously identified two residues in the helical domain of p110β (Gln596 and Ile597) whose mutation disrupts binding to GST-Rab5 (13Salamon R.S. Dbouk H.A. Collado D. Lopiccolo J. Bresnick A.R.

To more completely map the Rab5–p110β interface, we mutated additional residues in the helical domain of p110β and evaluated the effect on binding to Rab5A. We chose 35 surface-accessible residues surrounding Gln596/Ile597. Lysates from transfected cells expressing p85α and WT or mutant p110β were incubated with nucleotide-loaded GST-Rab5A beads and assessed for binding via immunoblotting (Fig. 1C). For each mutant, we calculated the percentage of the input (lysate) that bound to GTPγS–Rab5A; values in each experiment were normalized to WT p110β binding, which was set to 100%. The relative binding of the p110β mutants to WT p110β was stratified into three groups: 0–33% binding (red), 33–66% binding (blue), and >66% binding (green). Of the 35 mutated helical domain residues tested, eight showed binding that was less than 33% of WT, and four showed binding that was 33–66% of WT (Figs. 1D and 2). Residues whose mutation significantly inhibited Rab5 binding mapped to two α-helices (Asp509–Glu517 and Leu585–Ile597), which are located below the Gβγ-binding loop (Fig. 1E). The mutagenesis data suggest the primary Rab5 interface localizes to a discrete region within the helical domain of p110β. A previous study reported that the RBD mediates Rab5 binding to p110β (15Whitecross D.E. Anderson D.H. Identification of the binding sites on Rab5 and p110β phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.Sci.

However, this study evaluated Rab5 binding using a nonphysiological, truncated iSH2 domain–p110β fusion rather than full-length p85α/p110β. To reexamine the role of the p110β RBD in Rab5 binding in the context of the full-length heterodimer, we mutated the five amino acids in the RBD that were previously assessed for Rab5 binding (15Whitecross D.E. Anderson D.H. Identification of the binding sites on Rab5 and p110β phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.Sci.

Using the GST-Rab5A pulldown assay and lysates from cells expressing p85α and p110β (Fig. 3A), all five p110β RBD mutants exhibited binding to Rab5A that was comparable with WT p85α/p110β (Fig. 3, B and C). These data indicate that residues in the p110β RBD are not involved in Rab5 binding. To ensure that the mutations affecting p110β binding to Rab5A did not compromise the overall structure or folding of the p110β subunit, we examined the binding of p110β mutants to another small GTPase, Rac1, which binds to the p110β RBD (6Fritsch R. de Krijger I.

RAS and RHO families of GTPases directly regulate distinct phosphoinositide 3-kinase isoforms.Cell. 2013; 153 (23706742): 1050-106310.1016/j.cell.2013.04.031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). We compared the binding of p85α/p110β heterodimers to GST-Rac1 and GST-Rab5 in our in vitro pulldown assay (Fig. 4A). Binding of WT p110β to GTPγS–Rab5 was 3.3-fold higher than to GTPγS–Rac1 (17.7% of input as compared with 5.4% of input) (Fig. 4B). This is consistent with Fritsch et al. (6Fritsch R. de Krijger I. Fritsch K. George R. Reason B. Kumar M.S. Diefenbacher M. Stamp G. Downward J. RAS and RHO families of GTPases directly regulate distinct phosphoinositide 3-kinase isoforms.Cell. 2013; 153 (23706742): 1050-106310.1016/j.cell.2013.04.031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), who observed in vitro that p110β exhibited weaker binding to Rac1 than to Rab5. Also consistent with previous studies (18Zheng Y. Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. Activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity by Cdc42Hs binding to p85.J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269 (8034624): 18727-18730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Tolias K.F. Cantley L.C. Carpenter C.L. Rho family GTPases bind to phosphoinositide kinases.J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (7629060): 17656-17659Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), we could detect binding of p85α to GST-Rac1 (data not shown). However, binding was weak compared with p110β (1% of the input, even when using 4-fold more p85α lysate as compared with p85α/p110β heterodimer lysates). Thus, the binding of Rab5 and Rac1 to p85α is negligible as compared with their binding to p110β. As expected, the I597S mutant did not bind active Rab5A but did bind to active Rac1. Conversely and consistent with the observations of Fritsch et al. (6Fritsch R. de Krijger I. Fritsch K. George R. Reason B. Kumar M.S. Diefenbacher M. Stamp G. Downward J. RAS and RHO families of GTPases directly regulate distinct phosphoinositide 3-kinase isoforms.Cell. 2013; 153 (23706742): 1050-106310.1016/j.cell.2013.04.031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), the RBD-DM mutant of p110β bound active Rab5A but not Rac1 (Fig. 4C). Using the in vitro pulldown assay with GTPγS-loaded GST-Rac1, we also tested the newly identified Rab5-uncoupled p110β mutants as heterodimers with p85α. All of the helical domain mutants tested exhibited binding to GST-Rac1 that was comparable with that seen with WT p110β (Fig. 4, D and E). In addition, mutations in the RBD that were reported to disrupt Rab5 binding (15Whitecross D.E. Anderson D.H. Identification of the binding sites on Rab5 and p110β phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.Sci. Rep. 2017; 7 (29170408): 1619410.1038/s41598-017-16029-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) showed no significant difference in binding to GST-Rac1 with the exception of I234A, which is near the previously identified RBD-DM mutations (S211D and K230A) (Fig. 4, E and F). These data demonstrate that p110β mutations that disrupt Rab5 binding do not affect the binding of Rac1 to p110β. To verify that the enzymatic activity of the p110β helical domain mutants was intact, we performed in vitro kinase assays. For these assays, we selected a subset of p110β mutants: F508A and I512A, which showed <33% binding to GTP-loaded Rab5 relative to WT, and K510A and E517A, which showed 33–66% binding relative to WT (Fig. 5A). The p85α/p110β heterodimers were expressed in HEK293T cells, isolated on Strep-Tactin beads, and eluted with desthiobiotin. The eluted product was then assayed for activity using vesicles containing 2.9 mol % phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) as a substrate. As expected, the negative control kinase-dead (KD; K805R) p110β exhibited minimal kinase activity. The Rab5-uncoupled mutants of p110β exhibited specific activities comparable with WT p110β (Fig. 5B). These data demonstrate that the basal kinase activity of p110β is unaffected by mutations in the helical domain. To determine whether the p110β mutants responded to a known activator of p110β, we measured in vitro kinase activity in the presence of purified Gβγ (5Dbouk H.A. Vadas O. Shymanets A. Burke J.E. Salamon R.S. Khalil B.D. Barrett M.O. Waldo G.L. Surve C. Hsueh C. Perisic O. Harteneck C. Shepherd P.R. Harden T.K. Smrcka A.V. et al.G protein-coupled receptor-mediated activation of p110β by Gβγ is required for cellular transformation and invasiveness.Sci. Signal. 2012; 5 (23211529): ra8910.1126/scisignal.2003264Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). We chose Gβγ because the Gβγ-binding loop is in close proximity to the Rab5-binding interface in the p110β helical domain. Heterodimers of p85α with WT or mutant p110β showed an ∼2-fold activation by Gβγ (p values <0.01; Fig. 5, C and D); the I512A mutant, which showed a 2-fold activation, trended toward significance (p = 0.0712). In contrast, a mutation known to disrupt Gβγ binding to PI3Kβ (K532D/K533D (5Dbouk H.A. Vadas O. Shymanets A. Burke J.E. Salamon R.S. Khalil B.D. Barrett M.O. Waldo G.L. Surve C. Hsueh C. Perisic O. Harteneck C. Shepherd P.R. Harden T.K. Smrcka A.V. et al.G protein-coupled receptor-mediated activation of p110β by Gβγ is required for cellular transformation and invasiveness.Sci. Signal. 2012; 5 (23211529): ra8910.1126/scisignal.2003264Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar)) abolished activation by Gβγ (Fig. 5E). Taken together, our data show that helical domain mutations that disrupt Rab5 binding have no effect on the other biochemical activities of p110β. To examine the Rab5-binding site in p110β by an orthogonal approach, we used HDX-MS. Experiments were carried out at five time points (3 s at 1 °C as well as 3, 30, 300, and 3000 s at 18 °C). Sequence coverages of 86.8 and 90.2% were achieved for p110β and p85α with 155 and 104 peptides, respectively. Decreases in hydrogen-deuterium exchange rates (>5%) were observed within the helical domain of p110β in peptides spanning residues His492–Glu513 and Arg566–Leu578 (Fig. 6, A and C). Peptide His492–Glu513 (Fig. 6A, right panel) overlaps with α-helix Asp509–Glu517, which was critical for Rab5 binding in the pulldown assay (Fig. 6A, left panel). Peptides corresponding to the other critical α-helix, Leu585–Ile597, were not detected in the MS analysis. However, the Arg566–Leu578 peptide (Fig. 6A, right panel) includes Glu567 whose mutation caused a greater than 50% decrease in Rab5 binding (Fig. 6A, left panel). An increase in the rate of hydrogen-deuterium exchange was also observed in the kinase domain of p110β in peptides spanning residues Asn729–Met742 (Fig. 6, B and C). No significant changes were observed in the RBD of p110β or in the p85α regulatory subunit. The HDX-MS data support our findings that regions Tyr505–Glu517 and Ala589–Ile597 of the helical domain of p110β constitute the single Rab5-binding interface. We performed lipid kinase assays with recombinant PI3Kβ and GDP- or GTP-loaded Rab5 using lipid vesicles containing 2.9 mol % PIP2 as a substrate. Although the addition of 1 μm tyrosyl phosphopeptide caused a 26-fold activation of PI3Kβ (from 0.054 to 1.43 pmol of PIP3/min), addition of 10 μm Rab5 had minimal effect on PI3Kβ kinase activity (0.01 and 0.02 pmol/min for GDP- and GTP-loaded Rab5, respectively) (Fig. 7A). Binding of GTP-loaded Rab5 to PI3Kβ was confirmed by pulldown with immobilized p85α/p110β heterodimer bound to Strep-Tactin beads (Fig. 7B). Previous work from our lab established a role for GPCR-mediated PI3Kβ kinase activity in breast cancer metastasis (20Khalil B.D. Hsueh C. Cao Y. Abi Saab W.F. Wang Y. Condeelis J.S. Bresnick A.R. Backer J.M. GPCR signaling mediates tumor metastasis via PI3Kβ.Cancer Res. 2016; 76 (27013201): 2944-295310.1158/0008-5472.CAN-15-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To study the role of Rab5 binding to PI3Kβ in metastasis-associated cellular activities, we used stable knockdown/rescue MDA-MB-231 cells that express the murine myc-tagged WT and Rab5-uncoupled p110β mutant (I591S) at similar levels (Fig. 8A). In a transwell migration assay, chemotaxis toward LPA was reduced by ∼70% in cells expressing the Rab5-uncoupled mutant (Fig. 8B); chemotaxis toward EGF was reduced by ∼50% (Fig. 8C). Similar results were observed with a transwell invasion assay in which EGF-stimulated invasion through Matrigel was reduced by ∼50% in cells expressing Rab5-uncoupled PI3Kβ (Fig. 8D). Metastasis requires that tumor cells invade from the primary tumor into the surrounding extracellular matrix. To investigate the role of the Rab5–PI3Kβ interaction in matrix degradation, we compared the matrix-degrading activity of MDA-MB-231 knockdown/rescue cells expressing murine WT, KD (K799R) or Rab5-uncoupled mutant p110β. Cells were plated on fluorescently labeled gelatin, and the area of degradation per cell was measured (Fig. 8, E and F). Expression of either p110β mutant inhibited gelatin degradation by 80–90%. Taken together, these data suggest a critical role for Rab5 binding to PI3Kβ in the motility and invasion of breast tumor cells. We previously described a p110α/p110β chimera, which contained the N terminus of p110α (ABD and RBD) linked to the C terminus of p110β (C2, helical, and kinase domains) (21Dbouk H.A. Pang H. Fiser A. Backer J.M. A biochemical mechanism for the oncogenic potential of the p110β catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Subsequent mutagenesis studies identified two residues (Gln596 and Ile597) in the helical domain whose mutation to the corresponding residues in p110δ abolished binding to Rab5 (13Salamon R.S.

The present study used two independent techniques, structure-directed alanine-scanning mutagenesis and HDX-MS, to unambiguously define the full Rab5-binding interface within the catalytic subunit (p110β) of PI3Kβ. Our screen identified specific residues in the helical domain of p110β (Tyr505, Phe508, Asp509, Ile512, Glu513, Ala516, and Ala593) that are critical for Rab5A binding (mutation leads to <33% of WT binding). These residues are located within two perpendicular α-helices (Asp509–Glu517 and Leu585–Ile597; human sequence) that are situated just below the Gβγ-binding loop (Fig. 1A) (3Zhang X. Vadas O.

A computer haploscope was used to measure phoria values and changes in the eye position after introducing 6 prism diopters base out in front of the right eye. Phoria values were measured with a nonius paradigm every minute for a period of 10 minutes during adaptation. The results showed that subjects with symptomatic heterophoria are characterized by a lower rate of prism adaptation and adapted to a smaller extent with respect to the control group. The group with high but asymptomatic heterophoria showed prolonged adaptation time but after several minutes of binocular viewing the subjects were able to adapt to the prism to a level similar to the control group. These findings suggest that an impairment in the slow vergence control system may be responsible for the inability to fully reduce vergence effort, which results in poor vergence ranges and asthenopic symptoms during prolonged viewing."
https://openalex.org/W2908900886,"High morbidity and mortality are common traits of malignant tumours and identification of the cells responsible is a focus of on-going research. Many studies are now reporting the use of antibodies specific to Clusters of Differentiation (CD) cell surface antigens to identify tumour-initiating cell (TIC) populations in neural tumours. Medulloblastoma is one of the most common malignant brain tumours in children and despite a considerable amount of research investigating this tumour, the identity of the TICs, and the means by which such cells can be targeted remain largely unknown. Current prognostication and stratification of medulloblastoma using clinical factors, histology and genetic profiling have classified this tumour into four main subgroups: WNT, Sonic hedgehog (SHH), Group 3 and Group 4. Of these subgroups, SHH remains one of the most studied tumour groups due to the ability to model medulloblastoma formation through targeted deletion of the Shh pathway inhibitor Patched1 (Ptch1). Here we sought to utilise CD antibody expression to identify and isolate TIC populations in Ptch1 deleted medulloblastoma, and determine if these antibodies can help classify the identity of human medulloblastoma subgroups. Using a fluorescence-activated cell sorted (FACS) CD antibody panel, we identified CD24 as a marker of TICs in Ptch1 deleted medulloblastoma. CD24 expression was not correlated with markers of astrocytes or oligodendrocytes, but co-labelled with markers of neural progenitor cells. In conjunction with CD15, proliferating CD24+/CD15+ granule cell precursors (GCPs) were identified as a TIC population in Ptch1 deleted medulloblastoma. On human medulloblastoma, CD24 was found to be highly expressed on Group 3, Group 4 and SHH subgroups compared with the WNT subgroup, which was predominantly positive for CD15, suggesting CD24 is an important marker of non-WNT medulloblastoma initiating cells and a potential therapeutic target in human medulloblastoma. This study reports the use of CD24 and CD15 to isolate a GCP-like TIC population in Ptch1 deleted medulloblastoma, and suggests CD24 expression as a marker to help stratify human WNT tumours from other medulloblastoma subgroups."
https://openalex.org/W2908983468,"Aging is associated with a higher risk of falls, and an impaired ability to recover balance after a postural perturbation is an important contributing factor. In turn, this impaired recovery ability likely stems from age-related decrements in lower limb strength. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of age-related strength loss on non-stepping balance recovery capability after a perturbation while standing, without constraining movements to the ankle as in prior reports. Two experiments were conducted. In the first, five young adults (ages 20-30) and six community-dwelling older adults (ages 70-80) recovered their balance, without stepping, from a backward displacement of a support surface. Balance recovery capability was quantified as the maximal backward platform displacement that a subject could withstand without stepping. The maximal platform displacement was 27% smaller among the older group (11.8±2.1 cm) vs. the young group (16.2±2.6 cm). In the second experiment, forward dynamic simulations of a two-segment, rigid-body model were used to investigate the effects of manipulating strength in the hip extensors/flexors and ankle plantar flexors/dorsiflexors. In these, typical age-related reductions in strength were included. The model predicted lower maximal platform displacements with age-related reductions only in plantar flexion and hip flexion strength. These findings support the previously reported age-related loss of balance recovery ability, and an important role for plantar flexor strength in this ability."

https://openalex.org/W2909057292,"As larval cannibalism is common under intensive rearing conditions, leg regeneration can help ladybugs adapt to the competitive environment, but whether the leg regeneration leads to side effects on development remains unclear. To analyze the potentially developmental cost of leg regeneration, the developmental period and weight of leg-regenerated Coccinella septempunctata were studied in the laboratory. The results showed that, when the time intervals between the emergency of 4th-instar larva and leg amputation increased, the developmental period of leg-regenerated 4th-instar larvae was gradually prolonged. Significantly developmental delay were also examined at prepupal and pupal stages, and various timings of leg amputation affected the periods of leg-regenerated prepupae/pupae similarly. After the leg was amputated at different larval instars, the developmental delay only occurred at the larval instar when the leg was amputated, whereas other larval instars failed to be extended, and the developmental periods of leg-regenerated prepupae/pupae were affected similarly by the instars of leg amputation. Developmental delays possibly resulted in more consumption by leg-regenerated larvae, and then weight gains at prepupal/pupal stages, but different larval instars of leg amputation affected the weight gain similarly. Both the developmental delay (at 4th-instar larval, prepupal and pupal stages) and weight gain (at pupal and adult stages) in complete/bilateral amputation were longer or greater than those in half/unilateral amputation. However, the thoracic locations of leg amputation impacted the developmental delay and weight gain similarly. Our study indicates that although leg regeneration triggers the developmental cost decreasing the competitive superiority or agility, C. septempunctata larvae still choose to completely regenerate the leg to adapt to complex environments. Thus, in order to remain competitive at adult stages, leg-impaired larvae may make an investment tradeoff between leg regeneration and developmental cost."
