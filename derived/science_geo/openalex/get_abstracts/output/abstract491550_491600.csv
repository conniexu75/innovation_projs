https://openalex.org/W2030994794,"Intracellular microRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of gene expression. The role of extracellular miRNAs in neuronal activation and sensory behaviors are unknown. Here we report an unconventional role of extracellular miRNAs for rapid excitation of nociceptor neurons via toll-like receptor-7 (TLR7) and its coupling to TRPA1 ion channel. miRNA-let-7b induces rapid inward currents and action potentials in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. These responses require the GUUGUGU motif, only occur in neurons coexpressing TLR7 and TRPA1, and are abolished in mice lacking Tlr7 or Trpa1. Furthermore, let-7b induces TLR7/TRPA1-dependent single-channel activities in DRG neurons and HEK293 cells overexpressing TLR7/TRPA1. Intraplantar injection of let-7b elicits rapid spontaneous pain via TLR7 and TRPA1. Finally, let-7b can be released from DRG neurons by neuronal activation, and let-7b inhibitor reduces formalin-induced TRPA1 currents and spontaneous pain. Thus, secreted extracellular miRNAs may serve as novel pain mediators via activating TLR7/TRPA1 in nociceptor neurons."

The stabilization of mushroom spines depends on STIM2-mediated neuronal store-operated calcium influx (nSOC) and continuous activity of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). We demonstrate that STIM2-nSOC-CaMKII pathway is compromised in KI neurons, in aging neurons, and in sporadic AD brains due to downregulation of STIM2 protein. We further establish that overexpression of STIM2 rescues synaptic nSOC, CaMKII activity, and mushroom spine loss in KI neurons.

The small structures of postsynaptic dendritic spines play an important role in learning and memory (Bourne and Harris, 2008Bourne J.N. Harris K.M.

In experimental studies, postsynaptic spines are usually classified into three groups according to their morphological structure: mushroom spines, thin spines, and stubby spines (Bourne and Harris, 2008Bourne J.N. Harris K.M. Balancing structure and function at hippocampal dendritic spines.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2008; 31: 47-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar, Kasai et al., 2003Kasai H. Matsuzaki M.

Structure-stability-function relationships of dendritic spines.Trends Neurosci. 2003; 26: 360-368Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the mushroom spines are stable “memory spines” that store memories and that thin spines are “learning spines” that serve as physical substrates for the formation of new memories (Bourne and Harris, 2007Bourne J. Harris K.M. Do thin spines learn to be mushroom spines that remember?.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2007; 17: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). Reflecting the critical role of spines in the formation and storage of memories, significant alterations in spine number and morphology have been observed in a number of neurological and psychiatric disorders (Penzes et al., 2011Penzes P. Cahill M.E. Jones K.A. VanLeeuwen J.E. Woolfrey K.M. Dendritic spine pathology in neuropsychiatric disorders.Nat. Neurosci. 2011; 14: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar) and during normal aging (Dickstein et al., 2013Dickstein D.L. Weaver C.M. Luebke J.I. Hof P.R. Dendritic spine changes associated with normal aging.Neuroscience. 2013; 251: 21-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Most cases of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with memory loss as a cardinal feature, are sporadic and occur in the aging population but in approximately 1%–2% of cases, early onset (<65 years old) AD segregates as an autosomal dominant trait in families (familial AD [FAD]). FAD results from mutations in genes encoding presenilins (PS) or in the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Synapses are lost during AD, correlating strongly with cognitive decline (DeKosky and Scheff, 1990DeKosky S.T. Scheff S.W. Synapse loss in frontal cortex biopsies in Alzheimer’s disease: correlation with cognitive severity.Ann. Neurol. 1990; 27: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (1669) Google Scholar). These studies led to realization that AD is primarily a disease of “synaptic failure” (Knobloch and Mansuy, 2008Knobloch M. Mansuy I.M.

However, the exact cause of “synaptic failure” in AD remains unknown. Most of the current research in the field has been centered on the idea that elevated levels of amyloid beta Aβ42 peptide lead to elimination of synaptic spines by destabilizing postsynaptic Ca2+ signaling or disrupting the network of spine cytoskeleton (Knobloch and Mansuy, 2008Knobloch M.

Since loss of memories is a hallmark of AD, we and others previously proposed that mushroom spines are more likely to be eliminated during AD progression (Bezprozvanny and Hiesinger, 2013Bezprozvanny I.

Brandt R. Thin, stubby or mushroom: spine pathology in Alzheimer’s disease.Curr. Alzheimer Res. 2009; 6: 261-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Consistent with these predictions, it has been previously demonstrated that Aβ42 peptide can shift the balance from mushroom to stubby spines in the organotypic hippocampal slice culture preparation (Tackenberg and Brandt, 2009Tackenberg C. Brandt R. Divergent pathways mediate spine alterations and cell death induced by amyloid-beta, wild-type tau, and R406W tau.J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 14439-14450Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Recent amyloid imaging studies indicated that significant fraction of patients display biomarkers of neurodegeneration in the absence of amyloid accumulation in the brain (Jack et al., 2013Jack Jr., C.R. Wiste H.J. Weigand S.D. Knopman D.S. Lowe V. Vemuri P. Mielke M.M. Jones D.T. Senjem M.L.

Villeneuve S. Haase C.M. Madison C.M. Oh H. Landau S.M. Rabinovici G.D. Jagust W.J. Associations between Alzheimer disease biomarkers, neurodegeneration, and cognition in cognitively normal older people.JAMA Neurol. 2013; 70: 1512-1519PubMed Google Scholar). In many amyloid-positive patients, there was a poor correlation between local amyloid burden and other neurodegenerative markers (Wirth et al., 2013aWirth M. Madison C.M. Rabinovici G.D. Oh H. Landau S.M. Jagust W.J. Alzheimer’s disease neurodegenerative biomarkers are associated with decreased cognitive function but not β-amyloid in cognitively normal older individuals.J. Neurosci. 2013; 33: 5553-5563Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). These studies suggested existence of both “amyloid-first” and “neurodegeneration-first” biomarker profile pathways to preclinical AD (Jack et al., 2013Jack Jr., C.R. Wiste H.J. Weigand S.D. Knopman D.S. Lowe V. Vemuri P. Mielke M.M. Jones D.T. Senjem M.L.

Associations between Alzheimer disease biomarkers, neurodegeneration, and cognition in cognitively normal older people.JAMA Neurol. 2013; 70: 1512-1519PubMed Google Scholar). If not amyloid, what can be a driver of pathology in these patients? Our main hypothesis is that neuronal Ca2+ dysregulation may play a role of such a driver (Bezprozvanny and Mattson, 2008Bezprozvanny I. Mattson M.P. Neuronal calcium mishandling and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease.Trends Neurosci. 2008; 31: 454-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). The linkage with abnormal Ca2+ signaling is particularly strong with FAD mutations in presenilins. Many of PS FAD mutations result in enhanced Ca2+ release from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (InsP3R) and ryanodine receptors (RyanR) (Bezprozvanny and Mattson, 2008Bezprozvanny I.

Neurosci. 2013; 6https://doi.org/10.3389/fnmol.2013.00029Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). To explain these findings, we previously proposed that in addition to acting as the catalytic component of the γ-secretase complex, presenilins also function as passive ER Ca2+ leak channels, a function that appears to be disrupted by many FAD mutations (Tu et al., 2006Tu H. Nelson O. Bezprozvanny A. Wang Z. Lee S.F. Hao Y.H. Serneels L. De Strooper B. Yu G. Bezprozvanny I.

This hypothesis was supported by experimental results from our laboratory (Nelson et al., 2007Nelson O. Tu H. Lei T. Bentahir M. de Strooper B. Bezprozvanny I.

Structure of a presenilin family intramembrane aspartate protease.Nature. 2013; 493: 56-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We previously predicted (Bezprozvanny and Hiesinger, 2013Bezprozvanny I. Hiesinger P.R. The synaptic maintenance problem: membrane recycling, Ca2+ homeostasis and late onset degeneration.Mol. Neurodegener. 2013; 8: 23Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, Popugaeva and Bezprozvanny, 2013Popugaeva E. Bezprozvanny I.

Presenilins, deranged calcium homeostasis, synaptic loss and dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease.Messenger. 2012; 1: 53-62Crossref Google Scholar) that abnormal neuronal Ca2+ signaling can cause destabilization of mushroom spines independently form synaptotoxic effects of Aβ42. To test this hypothesis, we focused our studies on PS1-M146V knockin (KI) mice (Guo et al., 1999Guo Q. Fu W. Sopher B.L. Miller M.W. Ware C.B. Martin G.M. Mattson M.P. Increased vulnerability of hippocampal neurons to excitotoxic necrosis in presenilin-1 mutant knock-in mice.Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). This mouse model demonstrates defects in hippocampal memory tasks (Sun et al., 2005Sun X. Beglopoulos V. Mattson M.P. Shen J.

Alzheimers Dis. 2010; 19: 1021-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In several studies, abnormal neuronal Ca2+ signaling and synaptic transmission abnormalities have been reported for this model (Chakroborty et al., 2009Chakroborty S. Goussakov I. Miller M.B.

Neurosci. 2010; 30: 8566-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Importantly, neuronal Ca2+ signaling, synaptic plasticity, and memory defects in these mice occur in the absence of human Aβ42 accumulation, providing an opportunity to study Ca2+-dependent synaptic changes in isolation from synaptotoxic effects of Aβ42. In the present study, we focused on the analysis of alterations in the shape of synaptic spines in KI hippocampal neurons. The results obtained in our experiments uncovered an essential role of neuronal store-operated Ca2+ entry (nSOC) pathway in maintenance of mushroom spines in hippocampal neurons. Our results indicate that nSOC pathway in postsynaptic spines is specifically gated by a stromal interaction molecule 2 (STIM2), an ER Ca2+-sensor protein. We found that nSOC pathway causes persistent activation of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) in the spines, and this is needed for long-term stability of mushroom spines. We discovered that this pathway is downregulated in hippocampal neurons from KI mice, in aging mouse neurons, and in human sporadic AD cortical samples. Our results point to STIM2-nSOC-CaMKII synaptic maintenance pathway as a therapeutic target for prevention of synaptic loss in aging brains and in AD. To search for possible structural correlates of memory defects in KI mice, the wild-type (WT) and KI hippocampal cultures were transfected with TD-Tomato plasmid, fixed, and stained with anti-PSD95 antibodies (Figure 1A). PSD95 was localized to the heads of mushroom and stubby spines in both WT and KI neurons, confirming shape-based spine identification (Figure 1A). We observed significant reduction in the fraction of the mushroom spines and proportional increase in the fraction of thin spines in the KI cultures when compared to WT cultures (Figure 1B). To confirm these findings in vivo, we prepared thick brain slices from WT and KI mice at 3, 6, and 12 months of age and injected lucifer yellow dye (Dumitriu et al., 2011Dumitriu D. Rodriguez A. Morrison J.H. High-throughput, detailed, cell-specific neuroanatomy of dendritic spines using microinjection and confocal microscopy.Nat. Protoc. 2011; 6: 1391-1411Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) into hippocampal CA1 neurons to visualize shape of the spines in the secondary apical dendrites of injected cells (Figures S1A available online; Figures 1C, 1E, and 1G). We discovered that the total spine density was significantly higher in 3-month- and 6-month-old KI neurons than in age-matched WT neurons (Figures 1D and 1F). The fraction of mushroom spines was in the range 25%–30% for both WT and KI hippocampal slices at 3 months of age (Figure 1D). By 6 months of age, the fraction of mushroom spines in WT neurons was increased to 40%, significantly higher than in KI neurons at the same age (Figure 1F). The fraction of mushroom spines in 12-month-old WT neurons was reduced to 30%, but was still significantly higher than in KI neurons at the same age (Figure 1H). We did not observe any significant difference in the fraction of stubby spines between WT and KI mice at any age (Figures 1D, 1F, and 1H). The fraction of thin spines was inversely correlated with the fraction of mushroom spines. At 6 and 12 months of age there was a significant increase in the fraction of thin spines in KI neurons when compared to WT neurons (Figures 1F and 1H). Most likely, proliferation of thin spines is responsible for increase in total spine density in KI neurons at this age (Figures 1F and 1H). From this analysis (Figure 1), we concluded that in WT and KI neurons there is an age-dependent shift of a balance away from mushroom spines and toward thin spines. The KI mice do not express human APP protein and do not make human Aβ42. Murine Aβ does not exert synaptotoxic effects. PS1-M146V mutation has only subtle effect on Notch processing (Sun et al., 2005Sun X. Beglopoulos V. Mattson M.P. Shen J. Hippocampal spatial memory impairments caused by the familial Alzheimer’s disease-linked presenilin 1 M146V mutation.Neurodegener. Dis. 2005; 2: 6-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), as has been confirmed in our control experiments with KI hippocampal cultures (data not shown). Thus, neither Aβ42 toxicity nor dysfunction of Notch pathway are likely to cause mushroom spine loss in KI neurons. Abnormal neuronal Ca2+ signaling is well documented in KI mice (Chakroborty et al., 2009Chakroborty S. Goussakov I. Miller M.B. Stutzmann G.E.

Formation of excitatory spines was increased in transgenic mice that overexpressed TRPC6 channel, a potential component of nSOC entry pathway (Zhou et al., 2008Zhou J. Du W. Zhou K. Tai Y. Yao H.

Impaired function of SOC in presenilin mutant cells was suggested by the previous studies (Akbari et al., 2004Akbari Y. Hitt B.D. Murphy M.P. Dagher N.N. Tseng B.P. Green K.N. Golde T.E. LaFerla F.M.

Thus, we decided to explore a potential role of nSOC. To quantify nSOC in hippocampal neurons, the amplitude of nSOC-mediated Ca2+ influx in the soma was measured by Fura-2 fluorescence (Figure 2A). Consistent with our previous results obtained with the 3×Tg AD mouse model (PS1M146V KI, Thy1-APPKM670/671NL, Thy1-tauP301L) (Zhang et al., 2010Zhang H. Sun S. Herreman A. De Strooper B. Bezprozvanny I. Role of presenilins in neuronal calcium homeostasis.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 8566-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), we found that amplitude of somatic nSOC after 2 min depletion protocol was significantly reduced in KI neurons when compared to WT neurons (Figures 2B and 2F). As we discussed previously (Zhang et al., 2010Zhang H. Sun S. Herreman A. De Strooper B. Bezprozvanny I. Role of presenilins in neuronal calcium homeostasis.J. Neurosci. 2010; 30: 8566-8580Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), this result can be explained by impaired ER Ca2+ leak function in KI neurons, so that ER Ca2+ stores in KI neurons cannot be fully depleted during 2 min incubation in Ca2+-free media, resulting in incomplete activation of nSOC pathway. Measurements of ionomycin-sensitive ER Ca2+ pool in KI neurons following 2 min depletion protocol are consistent with this explanation (Figure S2A). To evaluate the function of nSOC pathway independently from the differences in the filling state of the Ca2+ stores, we extended the length of incubation in Ca2+-free media to 30 min to allow complete ER Ca2+ store depletion in both cultures. We discovered that following 30 min depletion protocol the amplitude of somatic nSOC was similar in WT and KI cultures (Figures 2C and 2F). Thus, we concluded that the function of somatic nSOC pathway is minimally affected in KI neurons in conditions of complete ER Ca2+ store depletion. It is well established that Ca2+ signaling in dendritic spines is compartmentalized and relatively insulated from somatic Ca2+ signaling (Higley and Sabatini, 2012Higley M.J. Sabatini B.L.

https://openalex.org/W2080030366,"Reciprocal activation of flexor and extensor muscles constitutes the fundamental mechanism that tetrapod vertebrates use for locomotion and limb-driven reflex behaviors. This aspect of motor coordination is controlled by inhibitory neurons in the spinal cord; however, the identity of the spinal interneurons that serve this function is not known. Here, we show that the production of an alternating flexor-extensor motor rhythm depends on the composite activities of two classes of ventrally located inhibitory neurons, V1 and V2b interneurons (INs). Abrogating V1 and V2b IN-derived neurotransmission in the isolated spinal cord results in a synchronous pattern of L2 flexor-related and L5 extensor-related locomotor activity. Mice lacking V1 and V2b inhibition are unable to articulate their limb joints and display marked deficits in limb-driven reflex movements. Taken together, these findings identify V1- and V2b-derived neurons as the core interneuronal components of the limb central pattern generator (CPG) that coordinate flexor-extensor motor activity."
https://openalex.org/W2032690818,"Even as demand for their services increases, honey bees (Apis mellifera) and other pollinating insects continue to decline in Europe and North America. Honey bees face many challenges, including an issue generally affecting wildlife: landscape changes have reduced flower-rich areas. One way to help is therefore to supplement with flowers, but when would this be most beneficial? We use the waggle dance, a unique behaviour in which a successful forager communicates to nestmates the location of visited flowers, to make a 2-year survey of food availability. We ""eavesdropped"" on 5097 dances to track seasonal changes in foraging, as indicated by the distance to which the bees as economic foragers will recruit, over a representative rural-urban landscape. In year 3, we determined nectar sugar concentration. We found that mean foraging distance/area significantly increase from springs (493 m, 0.8 km2) to summers (2156 m, 15.2 km2), even though nectar is not better quality, before decreasing in autumns (1275 m, 5.1 km2). As bees will not forage at long distances unnecessarily, this suggests summer is the most challenging season, with bees utilizing an area 22 and 6 times greater than spring or autumn. Our study demonstrates that dancing bees as indicators can provide information relevant to helping them, and, in particular, can show the months when additional forage would be most valuable."
https://openalex.org/W2025214550,"Voltage-dependent Ca(2+) channels (CaVs) represent the principal source of Ca(2+) ions that trigger evoked neurotransmitter release from presynaptic boutons. Ca(2+) influx is mediated mainly via CaV2.1 (P/Q-type) and CaV2.2 (N-type) channels, which differ in their properties. Their relative contribution to synaptic transmission changes during development and tunes neurotransmission during synaptic plasticity. The mechanism of differential recruitment of CaV2.1 and CaV2.2 to release sites is largely unknown. Here, we show that the presynaptic scaffolding protein Bassoon localizes specifically CaV2.1 to active zones via molecular interaction with the RIM-binding proteins (RBPs). A genetic deletion of Bassoon or an acute interference with Bassoon-RBP interaction reduces synaptic abundance of CaV2.1, weakens P/Q-type Ca(2+) current-driven synaptic transmission, and results in higher relative contribution of neurotransmission dependent on CaV2.2. These data establish Bassoon as a major regulator of the molecular composition of the presynaptic neurotransmitter release sites."

In mammals, more than 50 Pcdh genes are organized into three gene clusters, Pcdh-α, Pcdh-β, and Pcdh-γ, which encode diversified transmembrane proteins that are predominantly expressed in the nervous system (Kohmura et al., 1998Kohmura N.

In mice, the Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ clusters contain, respectively, 14 and 22 variable exons encoding the extracellular, transmembrane, and membrane-proximal part of the cytoplasmic domain, and three constant region (CR) exons encode the common portion of the cytoplasmic domain. In contrast, the Pcdh-β cluster consists of 22 single-exon genes. Each variable exon of the clustered Pcdhs is transcribed from its own promoter (Tasic et al., 2002Tasic B. Nabholz C.E. Baldwin K.K.

Moreover, homophilic interactions mediated by heterotetramers of the stochastically expressed clustered Pcdh isoforms at the cell surface could generate an enormous selection of potential combinations, thus allowing very specific cell-cell recognition (Schreiner and Weiner, 2010Schreiner D.

In support of this idea, single-cell RT-PCR analyses of Purkinje neurons revealed that the Pcdh-α, -β, -γA, and -γB isoforms are expressed stochastically and monoallelically in individual neurons, whereas the C-type exons, including αC1, αC2, γC3, γC4, and γC5, are expressed constitutively from both alleles in most neurons; in addition, in situ hybridization analyses also showed scattered expression patterns of Pcdh isoforms in the differentiated neurons of various brain regions (Esumi et al., 2005Esumi S.

Thus, the clustered Pcdhs have the potential, at least in concept, to specify the identity and circuitry of individual neurons. Epigenetics is sequence-independent transcriptional regulation that is essential for the establishment and inheritance of cellular identity during development (Bird, 2002Bird A. DNA methylation patterns and epigenetic memory.Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 6-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (5428) Google Scholar). In neuroblastoma cell lines that express specific subsets of Pcdh-α isoforms as well as in individual neurons, the transcriptionally active promoters are mostly unmethylated, and the silent ones are highly methylated (Tasic et al., 2002Tasic B.

Chem. 2008; 283: 12064-12075Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, treatment with 5-azacytidine induces the expression of previously silenced isoforms (Kawaguchi et al., 2008Kawaguchi M. Toyama T. Kaneko R. Hirayama T. Kawamura Y. Yagi T. Relationship between DNA methylation states and transcription of individual isoforms encoded by the protocadherin-alpha gene cluster.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12064-12075Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Therefore, the methylation patterns of the Pcdh promoter regions correlate with gene expression in vitro. However, the in vivo mechanisms for transcription regulation are not fully understood. Here we show that the promoter regions of stochastically expressed Pcdh isoforms are differentially methylated by the de novo DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3b (Okano et al., 1999Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are essential for de novo methylation and mammalian development.Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4507) Google Scholar), beginning on embryonic day (E) 3.5. We produced chimeric mice from Dnmt3b-knockout (KO) induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which survived to adulthood. However, Dnmt3b-KO Purkinje cells showed impaired dendritic arborization. We found that individual Dnmt3b-KO Purkinje cells expressed increased numbers of Pcdh isoforms at the single neuron level, although the overall expression level, at least within the Pcdh-α and -γ clusters, was maintained. These results indicate that DNA methylation by Dnmt3b at early embryonic stages regulates both the probability of expression for the stochastically expressed Pcdh isoforms in single differentiated neurons and the dendritic arborization. In wild-type (WT) brains, the Pcdh-α1 to -α12 isoforms are expressed stochastically and monoallelically in individual neurons, whereas the αC1 and αC2 isoforms are expressed constitutively and biallelically in most neurons (Figure 1B). However, deletion of the variable exons from α11 to αC2 (Δα11-C2) causes the constitutive and biallelic expression of α10 (Noguchi et al., 2009Noguchi Y. Hirabayashi T. Katori S. Kawamura Y. Sanbo M. Hirabayashi M. Kiyonari H. Nakao K. Uchimura A. Yagi T. Total expression and dual gene-regulatory mechanisms maintained in deletions and duplications of the Pcdha cluster.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32002-32014Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) (Figure 1B). To reveal the relationship between promoter methylation and gene expression in vivo, we performed methylation analysis of the Pcdh-α promoter regions in the cerebral cortex of Δα11-C2 mice at postnatal day (P) 21. Bisulfite sequencing showed that in WT cortex, the promoter regions of α4, α9, and α10 were methylated differentially and mosaically, whereas those of αC1 and αC2 were mostly unmethylated (Figures 1C and 1D), consistent with our previous study (Kawaguchi et al., 2008Kawaguchi M. Toyama T. Kaneko R. Hirayama T. Kawamura Y. Yagi T. Relationship between DNA methylation states and transcription of individual isoforms encoded by the protocadherin-alpha gene cluster.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12064-12075Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In contrast, the α10 promoter region in the Δα11-C2 cortex was mostly unmethylated (Figures 1C and 1D). Methylation-sensitive Southern blot analysis for the α10 locus showed that HpaII digestion yielded four distinct bands in WT, but only a 1.5 kb band was detected in the Δα11-C2 locus (Figure 1E), confirming the unmethylated status of α10 in Δα11-C2 brains. We further examined the promoter regions of α4 and α9, which are expressed stochastically in Δα11-C2 neurons (Noguchi et al., 2009Noguchi Y. Hirabayashi T. Katori S. Kawamura Y. Sanbo M. Hirabayashi M. Kiyonari H. Nakao K. Uchimura A. Yagi T. Total expression and dual gene-regulatory mechanisms maintained in deletions and duplications of the Pcdha cluster.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 32002-32014Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Their promoters maintained differential methylation patterns, but at significantly reduced levels (Figures 1C and 1D). Thus, the promoter regions of stochastically expressed Pcdh isoforms are differentially methylated, and those of constitutively expressed Pcdh isoforms are mostly unmethylated. Given that the Pcdh-α genes are exclusively expressed in neural tissues (Kohmura et al., 1998Kohmura N. Senzaki K. Hamada S. Kai N. Yasuda R. Watanabe M. Ishii H. Yasuda M. Mishina M. Yagi T. Diversity revealed by a novel family of cadherins expressed in neurons at a synaptic complex.Neuron. 1998; 20: 1137-1151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), we compared the methylation patterns of their promoters in the cerebral cortex and liver of C57BL/6 mice at P21. Bisulfite sequencing revealed similar methylation patterns between them, with a tendency toward lower methylation levels in the liver (Figures 2A and 2B), suggesting that the differential methylation is not specific to the brain. Next, we examined the differential methylation patterns during development. In E3.5 blastocysts, all the Pcdh-α promoter regions analyzed here were hypomethylated, at less than 10% (Figures 2A and 2B). The methylation of the promoter regions of α1 to α12 gradually increased through E9.5, whereas those of αC1 and αC2 were demethylated and/or maintained in a hypomethylated state (Figures 2A and 2B). These results indicate that the promoter regions of α1 to α12, but not of αC1 and αC2, are de novo methylated during early embryonic stages, starting from E3.5. In mouse development, the DNA is globally demethylated from fertilization to implantation, and subsequent methylation patterns are established by the de novo DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b (Okano et al., 1999Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are essential for de novo methylation and mammalian development.Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4507) Google Scholar). To test whether these two Dnmts are responsible for the de novo methylation of the Pcdh-α promoter regions, we examined the methylation states in Dnmt3a-KO and Dnmt3b-KO embryos at E9.5. Bisulfite sequencing revealed no obvious differences from WT in the promoter methylation states for Pcdh-α1 to -α12 in the Dnmt3a-KO embryos, but in the Dnmt3b-KO embryos the methylation was significantly reduced to less than 6.2%; in contrast, the hypomethylation of the promoter regions of αC1 and αC2 was unchanged (Figures 3A and 3D). To confirm these results, we performed methylation-sensitive Southern blot analysis for the α8 locus. In both WT and Dnmt3a-KO embryos, 1.35 kb and 1.2 kb bands were strongly detected by HpaII digestion, whereas only a 0.8 kb band was detected in Dnmt3b-KO embryos (Figure 3B), confirming the specific requirement for Dnmt3b. Moreover, the promoter regions of β22 and γA3 were methylated at similar levels in the WT and Dnmt3a-KO embryos but were hypomethylated in the Dnmt3b-KO embryos; the γC3 promoter regions were hypomethylated in all genotypes (Figures 3C and 3D). An intracisternal A-particle (IAP), an endogenous retrotransposon, is inserted between α7 and α8 (αIAP in Figure S1A, available online). The long-terminal repeat (LTR) of αIAP was highly methylated, to about 90%, even in Dnmt3b-KO embryos at E9.5, although the level in Dnmt3b-KO embryos was slightly lower than in WT (Figures S1B and S1C). Therefore, the methylation of the αIAP LTRs is independent of the methylation of Pcdh promoter regions. Previous studies showed that IAPs are not demethylated globally after fertilization (Lane et al., 2003Lane N. Dean W. Erhardt S. Hajkova P. Surani A. Walter J. Reik W. Resistance of IAPs to methylation reprogramming may provide a mechanism for epigenetic inheritance in the mouse.Genesis. 2003; 35: 88-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) and are partially hypomethylated in Dnmt3b-KO embryos (Okano et al., 1999Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are essential for de novo methylation and mammalian development.Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4507) Google Scholar). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis in WT embryos at E7.5 revealed that Dnmt3b was more enriched than Dnmt3a at each Pcdh promoter region (Figure 3E), strongly suggesting that Dnmt3b can directly methylate each Pcdh promoter. Interestingly, Dnmt3b binding appeared, not only in the DNA methylated promoters (α1, α8, β22, and γA3), but also in the unmethylated ones (αC1, αC2, and γC3) (Figure 3E). Therefore, we next examined histone modifications. In E7.5 embryos, repressive di- and tri-methylations of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2 and H3K9me3) were relatively highly enriched at the promoter regions of α1 and α8 compared with those of αC1 and αC2 and at the γA3 promoter region compared with the γC3 promoter regions; similar enrichments were also observed for another repressive modification, H3K27me3, but not for the permissive H3K4me3 modification (Figure 3F). Notably, the αC2 promoter regions were enriched for both H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 modifications (Figure 3F). These results indicate that the DNA-methylated Pcdh promoters have repressive chromatin modifications, and the αC2 promoter has bivalent histone modifications. Taken together, we demonstrated that Dnmt3b is essential for de novo methylation across the three Pcdh clusters during early embryonic development and that different DNA methylation and histone modifications are established at each Pcdh promoter. We evaluated the abnormal methylation in the nonneural tissue and embryo of Δα11-C2 mice. Surprisingly, bisulfite sequencing showed that methylation in the Pcdh-α promoter regions in Δα11-C2 mice was altered in the liver at P21 (Figures S2A and S2B) as well as in the cortex (Figures 1C and 1D). These alterations were detectable in Δα11-C2 embryos at E9.5 (Figures S2C and S2D), indicating that the de novo methylation by Dnmt3b in the Pcdh promoter regions is dependent on the gene cluster structure. Nonetheless, in WT embryo the methylation levels were negatively correlated with the number of CpGs per 100 bp (r = −0.82; p = 0.012) (Figure 3G) except at α8 (attributable to the high methylation near αIAP) (Figure S1A), indicating that the CpG density links to the methylation frequency. To determine how differential methylation of the Pcdh promoter regions affects expression, we examined whole brains of Dnmt3b-KO mice at E13.5 (because these mice die by around E15.5) (Okano et al., 1999Okano M. Bell D.W. Haber D.A. Li E. DNA methyltransferases Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are essential for de novo methylation and mammalian development.Cell. 1999; 99: 247-257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4507) Google Scholar, Ueda et al., 2006Ueda Y. Okano M. Williams C. Chen T. Georgopoulos K. Li E. Roles for Dnmt3b in mammalian development: a mouse model for the ICF syndrome.Development. 2006; 133: 1183-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that the αCR and γCR transcripts, which represent the total expression levels of the Pcdh-α and Pcdh-γ isoforms, were, respectively, 1.2-fold higher or unchanged in the Dnmt3b-KO brains, whereas the effects on the first exons varied: some were upregulated, some downregulated, and some were unchanged (Figure 4A). Bisulfite sequencing showed that the Pcdh promoter regions analyzed here were almost entirely unmethylated in the Dnmt3b-KO brain (Figures S3A and S3B). Importantly, the expression changes of each isoform were highly correlated with the changes in its methylation level (Figure 4B). In particular, the methylation of α8, whose promoter was relatively highly methylated in WT brain, was reduced by almost 70% in the Dnmt3b-KO brain (Figures S3A and S3B), and its expression level increased 12-fold (Figure 4B). On the other hand, the expression levels of αC1, αC2, γC3, and γC4, whose promoter regions were hypomethylated in WT brain (Figures S3A and S3B), decreased to less than 50% of WT (Figure 4B). These results indicate that the methylation of Pcdh promoter regions regulates the distribution of expression across the isoforms but is less important for the total expression of isoforms at least within the Pcdh-α and -γ clusters. To test whether the expression patterns of Pcdh isoforms were altered in the Dnmt3b-KO brain, we performed in situ hybridization analysis for γCR, which was shown to be highly expressed by qRT-PCR (Figure 4A). Although the signal intensity seemed slightly stronger than in WT, the overall pattern of γCR expression in the Dnmt3b-KO brain was similar, with postmitotic neurons in the cortical plate and other structures expressing it most strongly (Figure S4). This observation suggests that the overall pattern of Pcdh-γ expressions in neurons is maintained in the Dnmt3b-KO brain. The abnormal Pcdh isoform expression in the Dnmt3b-KO embryonic brain might be due to a change in the number of Pcdh isoforms expressed in individual neurons. To evaluate isoform expression in single neurons, we performed a mosaic experiment with Dnmt3b-KO neurons. Because the Pcdh cluster in Dnmt3b-KO embryonic stem cells (ESCs) had been already DNA methylated (Figure S5A), we therefore established iPSCs from Dnmt3b-KO embryos (Figure 3A) that ubiquitously expressed EGFP by crossing with a “green” mouse, and injected them into blastocysts of C57BL/6 mice to produce chimeras (Figure 5A). The resulting mice exhibited differing patterns of chimerism that could be assessed from the agouti coat color (Figure S5B). Although these mice survived to adulthood, some mice with high Dnmt3b-KO chimerism showed reduced body weight, growth retardation, and/or abnormal limb-clasping reflexes when suspended by their tails (Figures S5B–S5D). In the brain of the Dnmt3b-KO chimeras, the strong EGFP expression was observed in various brain regions (Figure S5E). For direct comparison, we also generated chimeric mice from iPSCs derived from MEFs of a WT green mouse (WT-EGFP). In both genotypes, similar EGFP signals were observed (1) in the pyramidal and inhibitory neurons and in the glia of the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (Figure S5F) and (2) in the Purkinje cells and granule cells in the cerebellum (Figure S5G), indicating that Dnmt3b is dispensable for the generation of these cell types. Given that Purkinje cells have elaborate dendritic arborizations with minimally overlapping dendritic branches (viewed from the parasagittal plane), we asked whether the dendrites of Dnmt3b-KO Purkinje cells developed normally. We obtained confocal z stack images of EGFP-labeled Purkinje cells from WT-EGFP and Dnmt3b-KO chimeras. These images were processed to generate 3D reconstructions, and the dendrites were traced by Imaris software (Figure 5B). The Dnmt3b-KO Purkinje cells frequently showed dendrites that formed bundles and that crossed one another (Figures 5B and 5C). To quantify the self-crossing in Dnmt3b-KO Purkinje cells, we counted the times of dendritic branches from a single Purkinje cell crossed one another in individual confocal planes and found double the number of crossings in Dnmt3b-KO Purkinje cells than in WT (Figure 5D). To determine whether these effects were cell autonomous, we injected biocytin into WT (EGFP-negative) and Dnmt3b-KO (EGFP-positive) Purkinje cells that were surrounded by Dnmt3b-KO cells in Dnmt3b-KO chimeras (Figure S5H). The number of dendritic self-crossings of WT Purkinje cells was similar to that of WT-EGFP Purkinje cells, whereas the Dnmt3b-KO Purkinje cells showed significantly more instances of dendritic crossing (Figure S5I). These findings suggest that Dnmt3b is required cell autonomously for avoidance of the dendritic self-crossing. To quantify the dendritic development in the absence of Dnmt3b in detail, we also measured the morphology of the Purkinje cell dendrites using Imaris software. In Dnmt3b-KO Purkinje cells, the number and total length of branches were significantly reduced (Figures 5E and 5F), whereas the area occupied by the dendritic arbors showed a bimodal distribution, which was significantly diminished in more than half of the Dnmt3b-KO Purkinje cells (Figure 5G). To evaluate the monoplanarity of the Purkinje cell arbors, we quantified the length and area occupied by the “overpassing” dendrites (i.e., those that crossed over other branches) (Figures 5B and 5C). In WT-EGFP Purkinje cells, the length and area occupied by overpassing dendrites was, respectively, 6.3% and 5.4% of the total, but these values were 24.5% and 31.4% in Dnmt3b-KO Purkinje cells (Figures 5H and 5I). In contrast, spine density was not altered by the Dnmt3b deficiency (Figure 5J). Taken together, these results indicate that Dnmt3b is required for normal dendritic patterning in Purkinje cells."
https://openalex.org/W2068541297,"Superimposition of two dimensional preoperative and postoperative facial images, including radiographs and photographs, are used to evaluate the surgical changes after orthognathic surgery. Recently, three dimensional (3D) imaging has been introduced allowing more accurate analysis of surgical changes. Surface based registration and voxel based registration are commonly used methods for 3D superimposition. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the accuracy of the two methods.Pre-operative and 6 months post-operative cone beam CT scan (CBCT) images of 31 patients were randomly selected from the orthognathic patient database at the Dental Hospital and School, University of Glasgow, UK. Voxel based registration was performed on the DICOM images (Digital Imaging Communication in Medicine) using Maxilim software (Medicim-Medical Image Computing, Belgium). Surface based registration was performed on the soft and hard tissue 3D models using VRMesh (VirtualGrid, Bellevue City, WA). The accuracy of the superimposition was evaluated by measuring the mean value of the absolute distance between the two 3D image surfaces. The results were statistically analysed using a paired Student t-test, ANOVA with post-hoc Duncan test, a one sample t-test and Pearson correlation coefficient test.The results showed no significant statistical difference between the two superimposition methods (p<0.05). However surface based registration showed a high variability in the mean distances between the corresponding surfaces compared to voxel based registration, especially for soft tissue. Within each method there was a significant difference between superimposition of the soft and hard tissue models.There were no significant statistical differences between the two registration methods and it was unlikely to have any clinical significance. Voxel based registration was associated with less variability. Registering on the soft tissue in isolation from the hard tissue may not be a true reflection of the surgical change."
https://openalex.org/W1974141237,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is regarded as a state of Klotho deficiency and FGF23 excess. In patients with CKD a strong association has been found between increased serum FGF23 and mortality risk, possibly via enhanced atherosclerosis, vascular stiffness, and vascular calcification. The aim of this study was to examine the hypothesis that soluble Klotho and FGF23 exert direct, rapid effects on the vessel wall. We used three in vitro models: mouse aorta rings, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and human vascular smooth muscle cells (HVSMC). Increasing medium concentrations of soluble Klotho and FGF23 both stimulated aorta contractions and increased ROS production in HVSMC. Klotho partially reverted FGF23 induced vasoconstriction, induced relaxation on phosphate preconstricted aorta and enhanced endothelial NO production in HUVEC. Thus Klotho increased both ROS production in HVSMC and NO production in endothelium. FGF23 induced contraction in phosphate preconstricted vessels and increased ROS production. Phosphate, Klotho and FGF23 together induced no change in vascular tone despite increased ROS production. Moreover, the three compounds combined inhibited relaxation despite increased NO production, probably owing to the concomitant increase in ROS production. In conclusion, although phosphate, soluble Klotho and FGF23 separately stimulate aorta contraction, Klotho mitigates the effects of phosphate and FGF23 on contractility via increased NO production, thereby protecting the vessel to some extent against potentially noxious effects of high phosphate or FGF23 concentrations. This novel observation is in line with the theory that Klotho deficiency is deleterious whereas Klotho sufficiency is protective against the negative effects of phosphate and FGF23 which are additive."
https://openalex.org/W2052773805,"Context dependence is a key feature of cortical-basal ganglia circuit activity, and in songbirds the cortical outflow of a basal ganglia circuit specialized for song, LMAN, shows striking increases in trial-by-trial variability and bursting when birds sing alone rather than to females. To reveal where this variability and its social regulation emerge, we recorded stepwise from corticostriatal (HVC) neurons and their target spiny and pallidal neurons in Area X. We find that corticostriatal and spiny neurons both show precise singing-related firing across both social settings. Pallidal neurons, in contrast, exhibit markedly increased trial-by-trial variation when birds sing alone, created by highly variable pauses in firing. This variability persists even when recurrent inputs from LMAN are ablated. These data indicate that variability and its context sensitivity emerge within the basal ganglia network, suggest a network mechanism for this emergence, and highlight variability generation and regulation as basal ganglia functions."
https://openalex.org/W2129569860,"A topic of major interest in socio-ecology is the comparison of chimpanzees and bonobos' grouping patterns. Numerous studies have highlighted the impact of social and environmental factors on the different evolution in group cohesion seen in these sister species. We are still lacking, however, key information about bonobo social traits across their habitat range, in order to make accurate inter-species comparisons. In this study we investigated bonobo social cohesiveness at nesting sites depending on fruit availability in the forest-savannah mosaic of western Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), a bonobo habitat which has received little attention from researchers and is characterized by high food resource variation within years. We collected data on two bonobo communities. Nest counts at nesting sites were used as a proxy for night grouping patterns and were analysed with regard to fruit availability. We also modelled bonobo population density at the site in order to investigate yearly variation. We found that one community density varied across the three years of surveys, suggesting that this bonobo community has significant variability in use of its home range. This finding highlights the importance of forest connectivity, a likely prerequisite for the ability of bonobos to adapt their ranging patterns to fruit availability changes. We found no influence of overall fruit availability on bonobo cohesiveness. Only fruit availability at the nesting sites showed a positive influence, indicating that bonobos favour food 'hot spots' as sleeping sites. Our findings have confirmed the results obtained from previous studies carried out in the dense tropical forests of DRC. Nevertheless, in order to clarify the impact of environmental variability on bonobo social cohesiveness, we will need to make direct observations of the apes in the forest-savannah mosaic as well as make comparisons across the entirety of the bonobos' range using systematic methodology."
https://openalex.org/W2151180591,"Visual information is mediated by two major thalamic pathways that signal light decrements (OFF) and increments (ON) in visual scenes, the OFF pathway being faster than the ON. Here, we demonstrate that this OFF temporal advantage is transferred to visual cortex and has a correlate in human perception. OFF-dominated cortical neurons in cats responded ∼3 ms faster to visual stimuli than ON-dominated cortical neurons, and dark-mediated suppression in ON-dominated neurons peaked ∼14 ms faster than light-mediated suppression in OFF-dominated neurons. Consistent with the neuronal differences, human observers were 6-14 ms faster at detecting darks than lights and better at discriminating dark than light flickers. Neuronal and perceptual differences both vanished if backgrounds were biased toward darks. Our results suggest that the cortical OFF pathway is faster than the ON pathway at increasing and suppressing visual responses, and these differences have parallels in the human visual perception of lights and darks."
https://openalex.org/W2068229221,"All cells rely on genomic stability mechanisms to protect against DNA alterations. PCNA is a master regulator of DNA replication and S-phase-coupled repair. PCNA post-translational modifications by ubiquitination and SUMOylation dictate how cells stabilize and re-start replication forks stalled at sites of damaged DNA. PCNA mono-ubiquitination recruits low fidelity DNA polymerases to promote error-prone replication across DNA lesions. Here, we identify the mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase PARP10/ARTD10 as a novel PCNA binding partner. PARP10 knockdown results in genomic instability and DNA damage hypersensitivity. Importantly, we show that PARP10 binding to PCNA is required for translesion DNA synthesis. Our work identifies a novel PCNA-linked mechanism for genome protection, centered on post-translational modification by mono-ADP-ribosylation."
https://openalex.org/W1976286688,"Peptide neuromodulators are released from a unique organelle: the dense-core vesicle. Dense-core vesicles are generated at the trans-Golgi and then sort cargo during maturation before being secreted. To identify proteins that act in this pathway, we performed a genetic screen in Caenorhabditis elegans for mutants defective in dense-core vesicle function. We identified two conserved Rab2-binding proteins: RUND-1, a RUN domain protein, and CCCP-1, a coiled-coil protein. RUND-1 and CCCP-1 colocalize with RAB-2 at the Golgi, and rab-2, rund-1, and cccp-1 mutants have similar defects in sorting soluble and transmembrane dense-core vesicle cargos. RUND-1 also interacts with the Rab2 GAP protein TBC-8 and the BAR domain protein RIC-19, a RAB-2 effector. In summary, a pathway of conserved proteins controls the maturation of dense-core vesicles at the trans-Golgi network."
https://openalex.org/W2114090959,"Plant diversification using cover crops may promote natural regulation of agricultural pests by supporting alternative prey that enable the increase of arthropod predator densities. However, the changes in the specific composition of predator diet induced by cover cropping are poorly understood. Here, we hypothesized that the cover crop can significantly alter the diet of predators in agroecosystems. The cover crop Brachiaria decumbens is increasingly used in banana plantations to control weeds and improve physical soil properties. In this paper, we used a DNA metabarcoding approach for the molecular analysis of the gut contents of predators (based on mini-COI) to identify 1) the DNA sequences of their prey, 2) the predators of Cosmopolites sordidus (a major pest of banana crops), and 3) the difference in the specific composition of predator diets between a bare soil plot (BSP) and a cover cropped plot (CCP) in a banana plantation. The earwig Euborellia caraibea, the carpenter ant Camponotus sexguttatus, and the fire ant Solenopsis geminata were found to contain C. sordidus DNA at frequencies ranging from 1 to 7%. While the frequencies of predators positive for C. sordidus DNA did not significantly differ between BSP and CCP, the frequency at which E. caraibea was positive for Diptera was 26% in BSP and 80% in CCP; the frequency at which C. sexguttatus was positive for Jalysus spinosus was 14% in BSP and 0% in CCP; and the frequency at which S. geminata was positive for Polytus mellerborgi was 21% in BSP and 3% in CCP. E. caraibea, C. sexguttatus and S. geminata were identified as possible biological agents for the regulation of C. sordidus. The detection of the diet changes of these predators when a cover crop is planted indicates the possible negative effects on pest regulation if predators switch to forage on alternative prey."
https://openalex.org/W1979856307,"Inflammatory angiogenesis and vascular remodeling play key roles in the chronic inflammatory skin disease psoriasis, but little is known about the molecular mediators of vascular activation. Based on the reported elevated mRNA levels of the angiogenic chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and its receptor CXCR4 in psoriasis, we investigated the relevance of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis in two experimental models of chronic psoriasis-like skin inflammation. The cutaneous expression of both SDF-1 and CXCR4 was upregulated in the inflamed skin of K14-VEGF-A transgenic mice and in imiquimod-induced skin inflammation, with expression of CXCR4 by blood vessels and macrophages. Treatment with the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 potently inhibited skin inflammation in both models, associated with reduced inflammatory angiogenesis and inflammatory cell accumulation, including dermal CD4+ cells and intraepidermal CD8+ T cells. Similar anti-inflammatory effects were seen after treatment with a neutralizing anti-SDF-1 antibody. In vitro, inhibition of CXCR4 blocked SDF-1-induced chemotaxis of CD11b+ splenocytes, in agreement with the reduced number of macrophages after in vivo CXCR4 blockade. Our results reveal an important role of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis in skin inflammation and inflammatory angiogenesis, and they indicate that inhibition of the SDF-1/CXCR4 axis might serve as a novel therapeutic strategy for chronic inflammatory skin diseases."

Investigations included blood culture, sputa for microscopy and mycobacterial culture. Xpert MTB/RIF assay was introduced during the study. Study children were followed for 12 weeks following their discharge from the hospital.405 eligible children were enrolled, with a median age of 10 months. Bacterial pathogens were isolated from blood culture in 18 (4.4%) children, of which 72% were Gram negatives. Tuberculosis was confirmed microbiologically in 7% (27/396) of children that provided sputum - 10 by culture, 21 by Xpert MTB/RIF assay, and 4 by both tests. The diagnostic yield from induced sputum was 6% compared to 3.5% from gastric aspirate. Sixty (16%) additional children had tuberculosis diagnosed clinically that was not microbiologically confirmed. Most confirmed tuberculosis cases did not have a positive contact history or positive tuberculin test. The sensitivity and specificity of Xpert MTB/RIF assay compared to culture was 67% (95% CI: 24-94) and 92% (95% CI: 87-95) respectively. Overall case-fatality rate was 17% and half of the deaths occurred in home following discharge from the hospital.TB was common in severely malnourished Bangladeshi children with pneumonia.

https://openalex.org/W2068389193,"Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are neuronal proton-gated cation channels associated with nociception, fear, depression, seizure, and neuronal degeneration, suggesting roles in pain and neurological and psychiatric disorders. We have recently discovered black mamba venom peptides called mambalgin-1 and mambalgin-2, which are new three-finger toxins that specifically inhibit with the same pharmacological profile ASIC channels to exert strong analgesic effects in vivo. We now combined bioinformatics and functional approaches to uncover the molecular mechanism of channel inhibition by the mambalgin-2 pain-relieving peptide. Mambalgin-2 binds mainly in a region of ASIC1a involving the upper part of the thumb domain (residues Asp-349 and Phe-350), the palm domain of an adjacent subunit, and the β-ball domain (residues Arg-190, Asp-258, and Gln-259). This region overlaps with the acidic pocket (pH sensor) of the channel. The peptide exerts both stimulatory and inhibitory effects on ASIC1a, and we propose a model where mambalgin-2 traps the channel in a closed conformation by precluding the conformational change of the palm and β-ball domains that follows proton activation. These data help to understand inhibition by mambalgins and provide clues for the development of new optimized blockers of ASIC channels."
https://openalex.org/W2033394110,"Aims Oxidative stress and apoptosis are among the earliest lesions of diabetic retinopathy. This study sought to examine the anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) in early diabetic retinas and to explore the underlying mechanisms in retinal vascular endothelial cells. Methods Sprague-Dawley rats were injected intravenously with streptozocin to induce diabetes. The diabetic rats were injected intravitreally with α-MSH or saline. At week 5 after diabetes, the retinas were analyzed for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and gene expression. One week later, the retinas were processed for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling staining and transmission electron microscopy. Retinal vascular endothelial cells were stimulated by high glucose (HG) with or without α-MSH. The expression of Forkhead box O genes (Foxos) was examined through real-time PCR. The Foxo4 gene was overexpressed in endothelial cells by transient transfection prior to α-MSH or HG treatment, and oxidative stress and apoptosis were analyzed through CM-H2DCFDA and annexin-V assays, respectively. Results In diabetic retinas, the levels of H2O2 and ROS and the total anti-oxidant capacity were normalized, the apoptotic cell number was reduced, and the ultrastructural injuries were ameliorated by α-MSH. Treatment with α-MSH also corrected the aberrant changes in eNOS, iNOS, ICAM-1, and TNF-α expression levels in diabetic retinas. Furthermore, α-MSH inhibited Foxo4 up-regulation in diabetic retinas and in endothelial cells exposed to HG, whereas Foxo4 overexpression abrogated the anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects of α-MSH in HG-stimulated retinal vascular endothelial cells. Conclusions α-MSH normalized oxidative stress, reduced apoptosis and ultrastructural injuries, and corrected gene expression levels in early diabetic retinas. The protective effects of α-MSH in retinal vascular endothelial cells may be mediated through the inhibition of Foxo4 up-regulation induced by HG. This study suggests an α-MSH-mediated potential intervention approach to early diabetic retinopathy and a novel regulatory mechanism involving Foxo4."
https://openalex.org/W2040259781,"Neurons receive input from diverse afferents but form stereotypic connections with each axon type to execute their precise functions. Developmental mechanisms that specify the connectivity of individual axons across populations of converging afferents are not well-understood. Here, we untangled the contributions of activity-dependent and independent interactions that regulate the connectivity of afferents providing major and minor input onto a neuron. Individual transmission-deficient retinal bipolar cells (BCs) reduced synapses with retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), but active BCs of the same type sharing the dendrite surprisingly did not compensate for this loss. Genetic ablation of some BC neighbors resulted in increased synaptogenesis by the remaining axons in a transmission-independent manner. Presence, but not transmission, of the major BC input also dissuades wiring with the minor input and with synaptically compatible but functionally mismatched afferents. Cell-autonomous, activity-dependent and nonautonomous, activity-independent mechanisms thus together tailor connectivity of individual axons among converging inner retinal afferents."

The whole genome sequence of this strain was obtained by paired-end and whole-genome shotgun sequencing, and the gaps between the contigs were closed using gap-spanning PCR products. The P. sp. Cab57 genome is organized into a single circular chromosome with 6,827,892 bp, 63.3% G+C content, and 6,186 predicted protein-coding sequences. Based on 16S rRNA gene analysis and whole genome analysis, strain Cab57 was identified as P. protegens. As reported in P. protegens CHA0 and Pf-5, four gene clusters (phl, prn, plt, and hcn) encoding the typical antibiotic metabolites and the reported genes associated with Gac/Rsm signal transduction pathway of these strains are fully conserved in the Cab57 genome. Actually strain Cab57 exhibited typical Gac/Rsm activities and antibiotic production, and these activities were enhanced by knocking out the retS gene (for a sensor kinase acting as an antagonist of GacS). Two large segments (79 and 115 kb) lacking in the Cab57 genome, as compared with the Pf-5 genome, accounted for the majority of the difference (247 kb) between these genomes. One of these segments was the complete rhizoxin analog biosynthesis gene cluster (ca. 79 kb) and another one was the 115-kb mobile genomic island. A whole genome comparison of those relative strains revealed that each strain has unique gene clusters involved in metabolism such as nitrite/nitrate assimilation, which was identified in the Cab57 genome. These findings suggest that P. protegens is a ubiquitous bacterium that controls its biocontrol traits while building up strain-specific genomic repertoires for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites and niche adaptation."

The purpose of this study was to identify the relative contributions of the Asp299Gly and the Thr399Ile variants in inhibiting the function of TLR4. 293/hMD2-CD14 cell line was transfected with lentiviral constructs containing human wild type (WT) TLR4-EGFP or TLR4-EGFP with Asp299Gly, Thr399Ile or Asp299Gly/Thr399Ile complementary DNA (cDNA). Multiple stable cell lines were established for each construct: three for WT TLR4, Asp299Gly, and Thr399Ile, and only two for Asp299Gly/Thr399Ile mutants and EGFP control. We did not observe a significant effect of polymorphisms on cell surface and intracellular TLR4 expression nor were there any significant differences in TLR4 and EGFP protein levels assessed by Western blotting and confocal microscopy among the multiple cell lines of each of the constructs. All cell lines had a dose-dependent responsiveness to LPS stimulation. However, compared to the WT TLR4, cells expressing TLR4 with Asp299Gly but not Thr399Ile polymorphism produced significantly less (P<0.05) IL-8 following LPS stimulation. Similarly, cells expressing TLR4 Asp299Gly but not Thr399Ile allele had significantly lower percentage of phosphorylated and total NF-κB P65 following LPS stimulation. While we could not do statistics on the Asp299Gly/Thr399Ile group, we observed a reduced responsiveness to LPS compared to WT TLR4.

The anti-cancer activity of 18β-GA has been studied in many cancer types, whereas its effects in lung cancer remain largely unknown. We first showed that 18β-GA effectively suppressed cell proliferation and inhibited expression as well as activity of thromboxane synthase (TxAS) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells A549 and NCI-H460. In addition, the administration of 18β-GA did not have any additional inhibitory effect on the decrease of cell proliferation induced by transfection with TxAS small interference RNA (siRNA). Moreover, 18β-GA failed to inhibit cell proliferation in the immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells 16HBE-T and another NSCLC cell line NCI-H23, both of which expressed minimal level of TxAS as compared to A549 and NCI-H460. However, 18β-GA abolished the enhancement of cell proliferation induced by transfection of NCI-H23 with pCMV6-TxAS plasmid. Further study found that the activation of both extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element binding protein (CREB) induced by TxAS cDNA transfection could be totally blocked by 18β-GA. Altogether, we have delineated that, through inhibiting TxAS and its initiated ERK/CREB signaling, 18β-GA suppresses NSCLC cell proliferation. Our study has highlighted the significance of 18β-GA with respect to prevention and treatment of NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W2070992272,"The transient receptor potential family V1 channel (TRPV1) is activated by multiple stimuli, including capsaicin, acid, endovanilloids, and heat (>42C). Post-translational modifications to TRPV1 result in dynamic changes to the sensitivity of receptor activation. We have previously demonstrated that β-arrestin2 actively participates in a scaffolding mechanism to inhibit TRPV1 phosphorylation, thereby reducing TRPV1 sensitivity. In this study, we evaluated the effect of β-arrestin2 sequestration by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) on thermal and chemical activation of TRPV1. Here we report that activation of mu opioid receptor by either morphine or DAMGO results in β-arrestin2 recruitment to mu opioid receptor in sensory neurons, while activation by herkinorin does not. Furthermore, treatment of sensory neurons with morphine or DAMGO stimulates β-arrestin2 dissociation from TRPV1 and increased sensitivity of the receptor. Conversely, herkinorin treatment has no effect on TRPV1 sensitivity. Additional behavioral studies indicate that GPCR-driven β-arrestin2 sequestration plays an important peripheral role in the development of thermal sensitivity. Taken together, the reported data identify a novel cross-talk mechanism between GPCRs and TRPV1 that may contribute to multiple clinical conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1994621465,"The effect of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) mutation I2020T on its kinase activity has been controversial, with both increased and decreased effects being reported. We conducted steady-state and pre-steady-state kinetic studies on LRRKtide and its analog LRRKtide(S). Their phosphorylation differs by the rate-limiting steps: product release is rate-limiting for LRRKtide and phosphoryl transfer is rate-limiting for LRRKtide(S). As a result, we observed that the I2020T mutant is more active than wild type (WT) LRRK2 for LRRKtide(S) phosphorylation, whereas it is less active than WT for LRRKtide phosphorylation. Our pre-steady-state kinetic data suggest that (i) the I2020T mutant accelerates the rates of phosphoryl transfer of both reactions by 3-7-fold; (ii) this increase is masked by a rate-limiting product release step for LRRKtide phosphorylation; and (iii) the observed lower activity of the mutant for LRRKtide phosphorylation is a consequence of its instability: the concentration of the active form of the mutant is 3-fold lower than WT. The I2020T mutant has a dramatically low KATP and therefore leads to resistance to ATP competitive inhibitors. Two well known DFG-out or type II inhibitors are also weaker toward the mutant because they inhibit the mutant in an unexpected ATP competitive mechanism. The I2020 residue lies next to the DYG motif of the activation loop of the LRRK2 kinase domain. Our modeling and metadynamic simulations suggest that the I2020T mutant stabilizes the DYG-in active conformation and creates an unusual allosteric pocket that can bind type II inhibitors but in an ATP competitive fashion."
https://openalex.org/W1970814073,"Using a comparative approach, we investigated the ability of dwarf goats and sheep to use direct and indirect information about the location of a food reward in an object-choice task. Subjects had to choose between two cups with only one covering a reward. Before making a choice, subjects received information about the baited (direct information) or non-baited cup (indirect information). Both goats and sheep were able to use direct information (presence of food) in the object choice task. After controlling for local enhancement, we found that goats rather than sheep were able to use indirect information (i.e., the absence of food) to find a reward. The actual test setup could not clarify whether individual goats were able to inferentially reason about the content of the baited cup when only shown the content of the non-baited cup or if they simply avoided the empty cup in that situation. As browsing species, feral and wild goats exhibit highly selective feeding behaviour compared to the rather unselective grazing sheep. The potential influence of this species-specific foraging flexibility of goats and sheep for using direct and indirect information to find a food reward is discussed in relation to a higher aversion to losses in food acquisition in goats compared to sheep."
https://openalex.org/W2049195158,"Oncostatin M (OSM) belongs to the IL-6 family of cytokines and has diverse biological effects, including the modulation of inflammatory responses. In the present study we analyzed the roles of OSM signaling in obesity and related metabolic disorders. Under a high-fat diet condition, OSM receptor β subunit-deficient (OSMRβ(-/-)) mice exhibited increases in body weight and food intake compared with those observed in WT mice. In addition, adipose tissue inflammation, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis were more severe in OSMRβ(-/-) mice than in wild-type (WT) mice. These metabolic phenotypes did not improve when OSMRβ(-/-) mice were pair-fed with WT mice, suggesting that the effects of OSM signaling on these phenotypes are independent of the increases in the body weight and food intake. In the liver of OSMRβ(-/-) mice, the insulin-induced phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase remained intact, whereas insulin-induced FOXO1 phosphorylation was impaired. In addition, OSMRβ(-/-) mice displayed a higher expression of genes related to de novo lipogenesis in the liver than WT mice. Furthermore, treatment of genetically obese ob/ob mice with OSM improved insulin resistance, adipose tissue inflammation, and hepatic steatosis. Intraportal administration of OSM into ob/ob mice activated STAT3 and increased the expression of long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase (ACSL) 3 and ACSL5 with decreased expression of fatty acid synthase in the liver, suggesting that OSM directly induces lipolysis and suppresses lipogenesis in the liver of obese mice. These findings suggest that defects in OSM signaling promote the deterioration of high-fat diet-induced obesity and related metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2126171245,"Borrelia burgdorferi is the causative agent of Lyme disease, an infectious disease that primarily affects the skin, nervous system, and joints. Uptake of borreliae by immune cells is decisive for the course of the infection, and remodelling of the host actin cytoskeleton is crucial in this process. In this study, we showed that the actin-regulatory formin Daam1 is important in Borrelia phagocytosis by primary human macrophages. Uptake of borreliae proceeds preferentially through capture by filopodia and formation of coiling pseudopods that enwrap the spirochetes. Using immunofluorescence, we localized endogenous and overexpressed Daam1 to filopodia and to F-actin-rich uptake structures. Live-cell imaging further showed that Daam1 is enriched at coiling pseudopods that arise from the macrophage surface. This filopodia-independent step was corroborated by control experiments of phagocytic cup formation with latex beads. Moreover, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Daam1 led to a 65% reduction of borreliae-induced filopodia, and, as shown by the outside–inside staining technique, to a 50% decrease in phagocytic uptake of borreliae, as well as a 37% reduction in coiling pseudopod formation. Collectively, we showed that Daam1 plays a dual role in the phagocytic uptake of borreliae: first, as a regulator of filopodia, which are used for capturing spirochetes, and second, in the formation of the coiling pseudopod that enwraps the bacterial cell. These data identify Daam1 as a novel regulator of B. burgdorferi phagocytosis. At the same time, this is the first demonstration of a role for Daam1 in phagocytic processes in general.—Hoffmann, A.-K., Naj, X., Linder, S.

https://openalex.org/W1964147619,"Over the last decades the phylogeography and genetic structure of a multitude of species inhabiting Europe and North America have been described. The flora and fauna of the vast landmasses of north-eastern Eurasia are still largely unexplored in this respect. The Eurasian lynx is a large felid that is relatively abundant over much of the Russian sub-continent and the adjoining countries. Analyzing 148 museum specimens collected throughout its range over the last 150 years we have described the large-scale genetic structuring in this highly mobile species. We have investigated the spatial genetic patterns using mitochondrial DNA sequences (D-loop and cytochrome b) and 11 microsatellite loci, and describe three phylogenetic clades and a clear structuring along an east-west gradient. The most likely scenario is that the contemporary Eurasian lynx populations originated in central Asia and that parts of Europe were inhabited by lynx during the Pleistocene. After the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) range expansions lead to colonization of north-western Siberia and Scandinavia from the Caucasus and north-eastern Siberia from a refugium further east. No evidence of a Berinigan refugium could be detected in our data. We observed restricted gene flow and suggest that future studies of the Eurasian lynx explore to what extent the contemporary population structure may be explained by ecological variables."
https://openalex.org/W2111456824,"Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is an intermediate filament protein expressed in astrocytes and neural stem cells. The GFAP gene is alternatively spliced, and expression of GFAP is highly regulated during development, on brain damage, and in neurodegenerative diseases. GFAPα is the canonical splice variant and is expressed in all GFAP-positive cells. In the human brain, the alternatively spliced transcript GFAPδ marks specialized astrocyte populations, such as subpial astrocytes and the neurogenic astrocytes in the human subventricular zone. We here show that shifting the GFAP isoform ratio in favor of GFAPδ in astrocytoma cells, by selectively silencing the canonical isoform GFAPα with short hairpin RNAs, induced a change in integrins, a decrease in plectin, and an increase in expression of the extracellular matrix component laminin. Together, this did not affect cell proliferation but resulted in a significantly decreased motility of astrocytoma cells. In contrast, a down-regulation of all GFAP isoforms led to less cell spreading, increased integrin expression, and a > 100-fold difference in the adhesion of astrocytoma cells to laminin. In summary, isoform-specific silencing of GFAP revealed distinct roles of a specialized GFAP network in regulating the interaction of astrocytoma cells with the extracellular matrix through laminin.—Moeton, M., Kanski, R., Stassen, O.

https://openalex.org/W2082070389,"Gene activation requires cooperative assembly of multiprotein transcription factor-coregulator complexes. Disruption to cooperative assemblage could underlie repression of tumor suppressor genes in leukemia cells. Mechanisms of cooperation and its disruption were therefore examined for PU.1 and RUNX1, transcription factors that cooperate to activate hematopoietic differentiation genes. PU.1 is highly expressed in leukemia cells, whereas RUNX1 is frequently inactivated by mutation or translocation. Thus, coregulator interactions of Pu.1 were examined by immunoprecipitation coupled with tandem mass spectrometry/Western blot in wild-type and Runx1-deficient hematopoietic cells. In wild-type cells, the NuAT and Baf families of coactivators coimmunoprecipitated with Pu.1. Runx1 deficiency produced a striking switch to Pu.1 interaction with the Dnmt1, Sin3A, Nurd, CoRest, and B-Wich corepressor families. Corepressors of the Polycomb family, which are frequently inactivated by mutation or deletion in myeloid leukemia, did not interact with Pu.1. The most significant gene ontology association of Runx1-Pu.1 co-bound genes was with macrophages, therefore, functional consequences of altered corepressor/coactivator exchange were examined at Mcsfr, a key macrophage differentiation gene. In chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses, high level Pu.1 binding to the Mcsfr promoter was not decreased by Runx1 deficiency. However, the Pu.1-driven shift from histone repression to activation marks at this locus, and terminal macrophage differentiation, were substantially diminished. DNMT1 inhibition, but not Polycomb inhibition, in RUNX1-translocated leukemia cells induced terminal differentiation. Thus, RUNX1 and PU.1 cooperate to exchange corepressors for coactivators, and the specific corepressors recruited to PU.1 as a consequence of RUNX1 deficiency could be rational targets for leukemia differentiation therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2086324700,"Background Increasing evidence has revealed that humid heat stress (HHS) causes considerable damage to human health. The cardiovascular system has been suggested to be the primary target of heat stress, which results in serious cardiovascular diseases. However, there is still a lack of effective approaches for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases induced by HHS. Objective Heat-shock proteins (Hsps), especially Hsp70, are reported to provide effective cytoprotection under various stress stimuli. In the present study, we evaluated the cytoprotective effect of geranylgeranylacetone (GGA), which was previously been reported to induce Hsp70 expression in cardiomyocytes under HHS. Methods and Principal Findings Using a mouse model of HHS, we showed that the pretreatment of GGA enhanced Hsp70 expression under HHS, as examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blot. We then examined the effect of GGA pretreatment on the cardiomyocyte apoptosis induced by HHS using terminal-deoxynucleoitidyl transferase mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, and found that GGA pretreatment inhibited mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. GGA pretreatment could reverse the effect of HHS on cell apoptosis by increasing expression of Bcl-2, decreasing cytochrome c in cytosol, and increasing cytochrome c in mitochondria. However, GGA pretreatment had no effect on the oxidative stress induced by HHS as determined by levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione (GSH). Conclusion We have demonstrated that GGA pretreatment suppressed HHS-induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes through the induction of Hsp70 overexpression."
https://openalex.org/W2051705519,"Development of the nervous system begins with neural induction, which is controlled by complex signaling networks functioning in concert with one another. Fine-tuning of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway is essential for neural induction in the developing embryo. However, the molecular mechanisms by which cells integrate the signaling pathways that contribute to neural induction have remained unclear. We find that neural induction is dependent on the Ca(2+)-activated phosphatase calcineurin (CaN). Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-regulated Ca(2+) entry activates CaN, which directly and specifically dephosphorylates BMP-regulated Smad1/5 proteins. Genetic and biochemical analyses revealed that CaN adjusts the strength and transcriptional output of BMP signaling and that a reduction of CaN activity leads to an increase of Smad1/5-regulated transcription. As a result, FGF-activated CaN signaling opposes BMP signaling during gastrulation, thereby promoting neural induction and the development of anterior structures."
https://openalex.org/W2074120812,"Cytosine methylation and demethylation in tracks of CpG dinucleotides is an epigenetic mechanism for control of gene expression. The initial step in the demethylation process can be deamination of 5-methylcytosine producing the TpG alteration and T:G mispair, and this step is followed by thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) initiated base excision repair (BER). A further consideration is that guanine in the CpG dinucleotide may become oxidized to 7,8-dihydro-8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), and this could affect the demethylation process involving TDG-initiated BER. However, little is known about the enzymology of BER of altered in-tandem CpG dinucleotides; e.g. Tp8-oxoG. Here, we investigated interactions between this altered dinucleotide and purified BER enzymes, the DNA glycosylases TDG and 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1), apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) endonuclease 1, DNA polymerase β, and DNA ligases. The overall TDG-initiated BER of the Tp8-oxoG dinucleotide is significantly reduced. Specifically, TDG and DNA ligase activities are reduced by a 3'-flanking 8-oxoG. In contrast, the OGG1-initiated BER pathway is blocked due to the 5'-flanking T:G mispair; this reduces OGG1, AP endonuclease 1, and DNA polymerase β activities. Furthermore, in TDG-initiated BER, TDG remains bound to its product AP site blocking OGG1 access to the adjacent 8-oxoG. These results reveal BER enzyme specificities enabling suppression of OGG1-initiated BER and coordination of TDG-initiated BER at this tandem alteration in the CpG dinucleotide."

The transmembrane domain (TMD) of α7nAChR has been identified as a target for positive allosteric modulators (PAMs), but it is unclear whether modulation occurs through changes entirely within the TMD or changes involving both the TMD and the extracellular domain (ECD)-TMD interface. In this study, we constructed multiple chimeras using the TMD of human α7nAChR and the ECD of a prokaryotic homolog, ELIC, which is not sensitive to these modulators, and for which a high resolution structure has been solved. Functional ELIC-α7nAChR (EA) chimeras were obtained when their ECD-TMD interfaces were modified to resemble either the ELIC interface (EAELIC) or α7nAChR interface (EAα7). Both EAα7 and EAELIC show similar activation response and desensitization characteristics, but only EAα7 retained the unique pharmacology of α7nAChR evoked by PAMs, including potentiation by ivermectin, PNU-120596, and TQS, as well as activation by 4BP-TQS. This study suggests that PAM modulation through the TMD has a more stringent requirement at the ECD-TMD interface than agonist activation."

Distinct sets of miRNAs were differentially expressed in a tissue-specific manner. The miRNA genes were distributed across all the chromosomes except chromosomes 29 and 31 in the horse reference genome. In some chromosomes, multiple miRNAs were clustered and considered to be polycistronic transcript. A base composition analysis showed that equine miRNAs had a higher frequency of A+U than G+C. Furthermore, U tended to be more frequent at the 5' end of miRNA sequences. This is the first experimental study that identifies and characterizes the global miRNA expression profile in normal horse tissues. The present study enriches the horse miRNA database and provides useful information for further research dissecting biological functions of miRNAs in horse."

However, the mechanism underlying aldosterone-salt-induced renal inflammation remains unclear. Pyroptosis has recently been identified as a new type of cell death that is accompanied by the activation of inflammatory cytokines. We hypothesized that aldosterone-salt treatment could induce inflammation through pyroptosis and that mizoribine, an effective immunosuppressant, would ameliorate the renal inflammation that would otherwise cause renal fibrosis. Ten days after recovery from left uninephrectomy, rats were given drinking water with 1% sodium chloride. The animals were divided into three groups (n = 7 per group): (1) vehicle infusion group, (2) aldosterone infusion group, or (3) aldosterone infusion plus oral mizoribine group. Aldosterone-salt treatment increased the expression of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain containing 3 and caspase-1, and also increased the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling-positive cells. However, the oral administration of mizoribine attenuated these alterations. Furthermore, mizoribine inhibited hypertension and renal fibrosis, and also attenuated the aldosterone-induced expression of serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase and α epithelial sodium channel. These results suggest that caspase-1 activation plays an important role in the development of inflammation induced by aldosterone-salt treatment and that it functions as an anti-inflammatory strategy that protects against renal injury and hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W1969846783,"In animals with complex life cycles, all resources needed to form adult tissues are procured at the larval stage. For butterflies, the proper development of wings involves synthesizing tissue during metamorphosis based on the raw materials obtained by larvae. Similarly, manufacture of pigment for wing scales also requires resources acquired by larvae. We conducted an experiment to test the effects of food deprivation in the larval stage on multiple measures of adult wing morphology and coloration of monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus), a species in which long-distance migration makes flight efficiency critical. In a captive setting, we restricted food (milkweed) from late-stage larvae for either 24 hrs or 48 hrs, then after metamorphosis we used image analysis methods to measure forewing surface area and elongation (length/width), which are both important for migration. We also measured the brightness of orange pigment and the intensity of black on the wing. There were correlations between several wing features, including an unexpected association between wing elongation and melanism, which will require further study to fully understand. The clearest effect of food restriction was a reduction in adult wing size in the high stress group (by approximately 2%). Patterns observed for other wing traits were ambiguous: monarchs in the low stress group (but not the high) had less elongated and paler orange pigmentation. There was no effect on wing melanism. Although some patterns obtained in this study were unclear, our results concerning wing size have direct bearing on the monarch migration. We show that if milkweed is limited for monarch larvae, their wings become stunted, which could ultimately result in lower migration success."

Our goal was therefore to expand the understanding of molecular mechanisms that drive liposarcoma and identify therapeutically-susceptible genetic alterations. We studied a cohort of high-grade liposarcomas and benign lipomas across multiple disease sites, as well as two liposarcoma cell lines, using multiplexed mutational analysis. Nucleic acids extracted from diagnostic patient tissue were simultaneously interrogated for 150 common mutations across 15 essential cancer genes using a clinically-validated platform for cancer genotyping. Western blot analysis was implemented to detect activation of downstream pathways. Liposarcoma cell lines were used to determine the effects of PI3K targeted drug treatment with or without chemotherapy. We identified mutations in the PIK3CA gene in 4 of 18 human liposarcoma patients (22%). No PIK3CA mutations were identified in benign lipomas. Western blot analysis confirmed downstream activation of AKT in both PIK3CA mutant and non-mutant liposarcoma samples. PI-103, a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, effectively inhibited the activation of the PI3K/AKT in liposarcoma cell lines and induced apoptosis. Importantly, combination with PI-103 treatment strongly synergized the growth-inhibitory effects of the chemotherapy drugs doxorubicin and cisplatin in liposarcoma cells. Taken together, these findings suggest that activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway is an important cancer mechanism in liposarcoma. Targeting the PI3K/AKT/pathway with small molecule inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy could be exploited as a novel strategy in the treatment of liposarcoma."

In wild-type mice, mAChR activation with oxotremorine-M decreased the amplitude of monosynaptic EPSCs in ∼67% of neurons but increased it in ∼10% of neurons. The inhibitory effect of oxotremorine-M was attenuated by the M2/M4 antagonist himbacine in the majority of neurons, and the remaining inhibition was abolished by group II/III metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) antagonists in wild-type mice. In M2/M4 double-KO mice, oxotremorine-M inhibited monosynaptic EPSCs in significantly fewer neurons (∼26%) and increased EPSCs in significantly more neurons (33%) compared with wild-type mice.

https://openalex.org/W1965395437,"The N-terminal cytoplasmic region of the Kv11.1a potassium channel contains a Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain that is essential for the unique slow deactivation gating kinetics of the channel. The PAS domain has also been implicated in the assembly and stabilization of the assembled tetrameric channel, with many clinical mutants in the PAS domain resulting in reduced stability of the domain and reduced trafficking. Here, we use quantitative Western blotting to show that the PAS domain is not required for normal channel trafficking nor for subunit-subunit interactions, and it is not necessary for stabilizing assembled channels. However, when the PAS domain is present, the N-Cap amphipathic helix must also be present for channels to traffic to the cell membrane. Serine scan mutagenesis of the N-Cap amphipathic helix identified Leu-15, Ile-18, and Ile-19 as residues critical for the stabilization of full-length proteins when the PAS domain is present. Furthermore, mutant cycle analysis experiments support recent crystallography studies, indicating that the hydrophobic face of the N-Cap amphipathic helix interacts with a surface-exposed hydrophobic patch on the core of the PAS domain to stabilize the structure of this critical gating domain. Our data demonstrate that the N-Cap amphipathic helix is critical for channel stability and trafficking."
https://openalex.org/W1973783655,"Introduction Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are life-threatening drug reactions with a higher incidence in HIV-infected persons. SJS/TEN are associated with skin and mucosal failure, predisposing to systemic bacterial infection (BSI), a major cause of death. There are limited data on risk factors associated with BSI and and mortality in HIV-infected people with SJS/TEN. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of patients admitted to a university hospital with SJS/TEN over a 3 year period. We evaluated their underlying illnesses, eliciting drugs, predictive value of bacterial skin cultures and other factors associated with mortality and BSI in a predominantly HIV-infected population by comparing characteristics of the patients who demised and those who survived. Results We admitted 86 cases during the study period and 67/86(78%) were HIV-infected. Tuberculosis was the commonest co-morbidity, diagnosed in 12/86(14%) cases. Skin cultures correlated with BSI by the same organism in 7/64(11%) cases and 6/7 were Gram-negative. Two of the 8 cases of Gram-negative BSI had an associated Gram-negative skin culture, although not always the same organism. All 8 fatalities had >30% epidermal detachment, 7 were HIV-infected, 6 died of BSI and 6 had tuberculosis. Conclusions Having >30% epidermal detachment in SJS/TEN carries an increased risk of BSI and mortality. Tuberculosis and BSI are associated with higher risk of death in SJS/TEN. Our data suggests there may be an association between Gram-negative BSI and Gram-negative skin infection."
https://openalex.org/W2037251347,"The rapid evolution of toxin resistance in animals has important consequences for the ecology of species and our economy. Pesticide resistance in insects has been a subject of intensive study; however, very little is known about how Drosophila species became resistant to natural toxins with ecological relevance, such as α-amanitin that is produced in deadly poisonous mushrooms. Here we performed a microarray study to elucidate the genes, chromosomal loci, molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components that contribute to the α-amanitin resistance phenotype in Drosophila melanogaster. We suggest that toxin entry blockage through the cuticle, phase I and II detoxification, sequestration in lipid particles, and proteolytic cleavage of α-amanitin contribute in concert to this quantitative trait. We speculate that the resistance to mushroom toxins in D. melanogaster and perhaps in mycophagous Drosophila species has evolved as cross-resistance to pesticides, other xenobiotic substances, or environmental stress factors."

We show that in mESCs, Dub3 gene expression is cell cycle regulated and is maximal prior G1/S transition. In addition, following UV-induced DNA damage in G1, Dub3 expression markedly increases in S-phase also suggesting a role in checkpoint recovery. Unexpectedly, we also observed cell cycle-regulation of Nanog expression, and not Oct4, reaching high levels prior to G1/S transition, finely mirroring Cyclin E1 fluctuations. Curiously, while Esrrb showed only limited cell-cycle oscillations, transcript levels of the p160 family of nuclear receptor coactivators (NCoAs) displayed strong cell cycle-dependent fluctuations. Since NCoAs function in concert with Esrrb in transcriptional activation, we focussed on NCoA1 whose levels specifically increase prior onset of Dub3 transcription. Using a reporter assay, we show that NCoA1 potentiates Esrrb-mediated transcription of Dub3 and we present evidence of protein interaction between the SRC1 splice variant NCoA1 and Esrrb. Finally, we show a differential developmental regulation of all members of the p160 family during neural conversion of mESCs. These findings suggest that in mouse ESCs, changes in the relative concentration of a coactivator at a given cell cycle phase, may contribute to modulation of the transcriptional activity of the core transcription factors of the pluripotent network and be implicated in cell fate decisions upon onset of differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1980934199,"The immune system eliminates Chlamydia trachomatis infection through inflammation. However, uncontrolled inflammation can enhance pathology. In mice, TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand receptor (TRAIL-R), known for its effects on apoptosis, also regulates inflammation. In humans, the four homologues of TRAIL-R had never been investigated for effects on inflammation. Here, we examined whether TRAIL-R regulates inflammation during chlamydial infection. We examined TRAIL-R1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in an Ecuadorian cohort with and without C. trachomatis infections. There was a highly significant association for the TRAIL+626 homozygous mutant GG for infection vs no infection in this population. To confirm the results observed in the human population, primary lung fibroblasts and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were isolated from wildtype (WT) and TRAIL-R-deficient mice, and TRAIL-R1 levels in human cervical epithelial cells were depleted by RNA interference. Infection of BMDMs and primary lung fibroblasts with C. trachomatis strain L2, or the murine pathogen C. muridarum, led to higher levels of MIP2 mRNA expression or IL-1β secretion from TRAIL-R-deficient cells than WT cells. Similarly, depletion of TRAIL-R1 expression in human epithelial cells resulted in a higher level of IL-8 mRNA expression and protein secretion during C. trachomatis infection. We conclude that human TRAIL-R1 SNPs and murine TRAIL-R modulate the innate immune response against chlamydial infection. This is the first evidence that human TRAIL-R1 is a negative regulator of inflammation and plays a role in modulating Chlamydia pathogenesis."

This study examined genetic and environmental bases of two dimensions of narcissism: intrapersonal grandiosity and interpersonal entitlement. A total of 304 pairs of twins from Beijing, China completed the Narcissistic Grandiosity Scale and the Psychological Entitlement Scale. Both grandiosity (23%) and entitlement (35%) were found to be moderately heritable, while simultaneously showing considerable non-shared environmental influences. Moreover, the genetic and environmental influences on the two dimensions were mostly unique (92-93%), with few genetic and environmental effects in common (7-8%). The two dimensions of narcissism, intrapersonal grandiosity and interpersonal entitlement, are heritable and largely independent of each other in terms of their genetic and environmental sources. These findings extend our understanding of the heritability of narcissism on the one hand. On the other hand, the study demonstrates the rationale for distinguishing between intrapersonal and interpersonal dimensions of narcissism, and possibly personality in general as well."

https://openalex.org/W2000971110,"It is proposed that the ageing process is linked to signaling from the germline such that the rate of ageing can be adjusted to the state of the reproductive system, allowing these two processes to co-evolve. Mechanistic insight into this link has been primarily derived from iteroparous reproductive models, the nematode C. elegans, and the arthropod Drosophila. Here, we examined to what extent these mechanisms are evolutionarily conserved in a semelparous chordate, Oikopleura dioica, where we identify a developmental growth arrest (GA) in response to crowded, diet-restricted conditions, which can extend its lifespan at least three-fold. Under nutritional stress, the iteroparative models sacrifice germ cells that have entered meiosis, while maintaining a reduced pool of active germline stem cells (GSCs). In contrast, O. dioica only entered GA prior to meiotic entry. Stress conditions encountered after this point led to maturation in a normal time frame but with reduced reproductive output. During GA, TOR signaling was inhibited, whereas MAPK, ERK1/2 and p38 pathways were activated, and under such conditions, activation of these pathways was shown to be critical for survival. Direct inhibition of TOR signaling alone was sufficient to prevent meiotic entry and germline differentiation. This inhibition activated the p38 pathway, but did not activate the ERK1/2 pathway. Thus, the link between reproductive status and lifespan extension in response to nutrient-limited conditions is interpreted in a significantly different manner in these iteroparative versus semelparous models. In the latter case, meiotic entry is a definitive signal that lifespan extension can no longer occur, whereas in the former, meiotic entry is not a unique chronological event, and can be largely erased during lifespan extension in response to nutrient stress, and reactivated from a pool of maintained GSCs when conditions improve."

Amino acids are unable to activate ERK1/2 in β cells in which T1R3 has been depleted. The muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol activated ERK1/2 better in T1R3-depleted cells than in control cells. Ligands that activate certain G protein-coupled receptors in pancreatic β cells potentiate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Among these is the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, the major muscarinic receptor in β cells. We found that expression of M3 receptors increased in T1R3-depleted MIN6 cells and that calcium responses were altered. To determine whether these changes were related to impaired amino acid signaling, we compared responses in cells exposed to reduced amino acid concentrations. M3 receptor expression was increased, and some, but not all, changes in calcium signaling were mimicked. These findings suggest that M3 acetylcholine receptors are increased in β cells as a mechanism to compensate for amino acid deficiency.

Suppl. 1989; : 11-15PubMed Google Scholar). β cell muscarinic receptors are Gq-coupled because binding of acetylcholine to these receptors results in the well characterized action of Gq to activate phospholipase C β. The resulting hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate generates the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, which binds to its receptor on the ER and induces calcium release from intracellular stores (4Berridge M.J.

Agents were applied (0.1 ml/well) to triplicate wells at 2× concentrations using injectors at a rate of 225 μl/s. Changes in Ca2+i were assessed every 0.74 s by dual excitation of Fura-2 at 340/11 and 380/20 nm (center/bandpass) and emission at 508/20 nm using the SynergyTM 2 multimode microplate reader (BioTek) with Gen5TM software. Cells were pretreated with the indicated inhibitors for 30 min prior to stimulation. For experiments performed in the absence of calcium, cells were loaded, washed, and equilibrated with calcium-free KRBH in which MgCl2 was substituted for 2.5 mm CaCl2. To assess store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), intracellular stores were depleted using 10 μm thapsigargin. Calcium was then replenished with a second injection of KRBH containing 12.5 mm CaCl2 (5× concentration, 50 μl/well).

Stimulation of β cells with carbachol produced a biphasic rise in Ca2+i, composed of a rapid and transient peak followed by a sustained plateau phase (20Gylfe E. Carbachol induces sustained glucose-dependent oscillations of cytoplasmic Ca2+ in hyperpolarized pancreatic β cells.Pflugers Arch. 1991; 419: 639-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 21Liu Y.J. Gylfe E. Store-operated Ca2+ entry in insulin-releasing pancreatic β-cells.Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Compared with the control, we observed a larger rise in peak Ca2+i in MIN6 cells with depleted T1R3 as well as a faster decline during the second phase of the carbachol response (Fig. 1, A and B). One possible reason for enhanced carbachol-induced changes in Ca2+i in MIN6 T1R3 knockdown cells could be increased expression of mAChRs. Therefore, we performed real -time quantitative PCR to compare changes in expression of the Gq-coupled mAChRs, M1, M3, and M5, in MIN6 control and T1R3 knockdown cells. There was 2.35 + 0.06-fold increase in M3R mRNA in the T1R3knockdown cells compared with the control, whereas the expression of M1 and M5 receptors did not change significantly (Fig. 1C). The increase in M3R mRNA in T1R3 knockdown cells was mirrored by an increase in M3R protein expression that was found by immunoblotting lysates from control and T1R3 knockdown cells (Fig. 1D). Quantitation of the immunoblot analyses indicated a 3.8 + 0.9-fold increase in M3R protein in MIN6 cells with suppressed T1R3 expression (Fig. 1D). In addition to mAChRs, we also examined the expression of the regulator of G protein signaling 4 (RGS4) and transient receptor potential channel 6 (TRPC6). RGS proteins are GTPase-activating proteins that enhance Gα-GTP hydrolysis, thereby decreasing the lifetime of active states of G protein subunits, and RGS4 is expressed in β cells (22Ross E.M. Wilkie T.M. GTPase-activating proteins for heterotrimeric G proteins: regulators of G protein signaling (RGS) and RGS-like proteins.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 795-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). TRPC6 has been reported to be a receptor-operated cation channel that is activated upon GPCR stimulation and subsequent phospholipase C β activation (23Estacion M. Li S. Sinkins W.G. Gosling M.

Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors activate TRPC6 channels in PC12D cells via Ca2+ store-independent mechanisms.J. Biochem. 2006; 139: 459-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Calcium entry occurring through plasma membrane channels as a result of GPCR activation independent of the state of Ca2+i stores is referred to as ROCE (25Hofmann T. Schaefer M. Schultz G. Gudermann T. Transient receptor potential channels as molecular substrates of receptor-mediated cation entry.J. Mol. Med. 2000; 78: 14-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that carbachol is capable of inducing ROCE by activating and promoting cell surface expression of TRPC6 downstream of muscarinic receptor binding (26Boulay G. Ca2+-calmodulin regulates receptor-operated Ca2+ entry activity of TRPC6 in HEK-293 cells.Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 27Cayouette S. Lussier M.P. Mathieu E.L. Bousquet S.M. Boulay G. Exocytotic insertion of TRPC6 channel into the plasma membrane upon Gq protein-coupled receptor activation.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7241-7246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Expression of neither RGS4 nor TRPC6 was significantly different in T1R3 knockdown cells compared with the control, suggesting that the enhanced carbachol response was not a result of decreased RGS4 or increased TRPC6 expression (Fig. 1C). The initial rapid rise in calcium observed upon carbachol stimulation in β cells has been shown to be due to the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-mediated release of calcium from ER stores, whereas the second phase is maintained by SOCE (21Liu Y.J. Gylfe E. Store-operated Ca2+ entry in insulin-releasing pancreatic β-cells.Cell Calcium. 1997; 22: 277-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). SOCE refers to calcium influx that occurs through store-operated calcium channels (SOCCs) as a result of Ca2+i store depletion (28Parekh A.B. Penner R. Store depletion and calcium influx.Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1289) Google Scholar). We investigated whether the contributions of Ca2+i stores or SOCE to carbachol-induced changes in Ca2+i differed in MIN6 cells with suppressed T1R3 expression compared with control cells. Cells were stimulated with carbachol in the absence of extracellular calcium to determine whether activation of M3R in the T1R3 knockdown cells induced a larger rise in Ca2+i as a result of the release of calcium from intracellular stores. We found that carbachol stimulated a larger rise in Ca2+i in the absence of extracellular calcium in the T1R3 knockdown cells compared with control cells (Fig. 2, A and B). This finding suggests that, in addition to elevated M3R, a larger release of calcium from intracellular stores may contribute to the enhanced first phase of the carbachol response in the MIN6 T1R3 knockdown cells. We next determined whether the larger carbachol-induced release from intracellular stores was a consequence of more calcium stored in the ER of cells with reduced T1R3 by treating cells with thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase, to deplete ER stores of calcium (29Lytton J. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. Thapsigargin inhibits the sarcoplasmic or endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase family of calcium pumps.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of extracellular calcium, thapsigargin induced a similar rise in Ca2+i in T1R3 knockdown and control cells (Fig. 2, C and D). When extracellular calcium was replenished, allowing SOCE to occur, calcium entry through SOCCs was similar in both T1R3 knockdown and control cells. We also explored ROCE, after calcium restoration and SOCE had occurred, by stimulating cells with carbachol. Despite little or no change in TRPC6 expression in MIN6 cells depleted of T1R3, ROCE was absent (Fig. 2, C and D), suggesting that another, as yet unidentified channel may contribute to ROCE in MIN6 cells. Consistent with the larger release of calcium from intracellular stores induced by carbachol, a greater portion of the peak carbachol response was sensitive to inhibition by thapsigargin in the T1R3 knockdown cells (Fig. 3A). Thapsigargin blocked a greater portion of carbachol-induced changes in Ca2+i at 2 min in the control cell line. It is possible that SOCE triggered by carbachol generates a smaller influx of Ca2+ through SOCCs in the T1R3 knockdown cells compared with control cells. This might explain why the second phase of the calcium response declined at a faster rate and was less affected by thapsigargin in T1R3 knockdown cells. 2-APB, an inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor antagonist, inhibited peak and 2 mincarbachol-induced rises in Ca2+i to a similar degree in both control and T1R3 knockdown cells (Fig. 3, A and B). It is conceivable that the inhibitory effect of 2-APB on carbachol-stimulated changes in Ca2+i was due to its actions on SOCCs rather than through inhibition of inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (30Missiaen L. Callewaert G. De Smedt H. Parys J.B. 2-Aminoethoxydiphenyl borate affects the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, the intracellular Ca2+ pump and the non-specific Ca2+ leak from the non-mitochondrial Ca2+ stores in permeabilized A7r5 cells.Cell Calcium. 2001; 29: 111-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Using an ER-localized FRET sensor, it has been reported that, in MIN6 cells, carbachol-induced reductions in ER calcium were not inhibited by pretreatment with 2-APB despite lower overall Ca2+i (14Selway J.L. Moore C.E. Mistry R. John Challiss R.A. Herbert T.P. Molecular mechanisms of muscarinic acetylcholine receptor-stimulated increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration and ERK1/2 activation in the MIN6 pancreatic β-cell line.Acta Diabetol. 2012; 49: 277-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). To determine whether or not 2-APB had an effect on SOCE, calcium was depleted and then added back to MIN6 cells, as shown in Fig. 2C, and pretreated with 2-APB for 30 min. In 2-APB-treated cells, the ability of thapsigargin to deplete stores and the subsequent SOCE was reduced significantly, whereas ROCE was not altered (Fig. 3, C and D). It has been shown previously that nifedipine, an L-type voltage-gated calcium channel blocker, inhibits carbachol-induced changes in Ca2+i in MIN6 cells, suggesting that carbachol causes membrane depolarization (12Wauson E.M. Zaganjor E. Lee A.Y. Guerra M.L. Ghosh A.B. Bookout A.L. Chambers C.P. Jivan A. McGlynn K. Hutchison M.R. Deberardinis R.J. Cobb M.H. The G protein-coupled receptor T1R1/T1R3 regulates mTORC1 and autophagy.Mol. Cell. 2012; 47: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis, resulting from carbachol-induced phospholipase C activation, leads to decreased KATP channel activity. Decreased KATP channel activity results in membrane depolarization and activation of voltage-gated calcium channels. Nifedipine had a greater effect on the carbachol response in the control cells compared with those with reduced T1R3, consistent with the observation that calcium released from intracellular stores contributes a greater portion of the carbachol-induced rise in Ca2+i in the T1R3 knockdown cells than does extracellular calcium (Fig. 3, A and B). To determine whether nifedipine was having an effect on SOCE or ROCE, MIN6 cells were pretreated with nifedipine for 30 min prior to stimulation. Unlike what was observed with 2-APB, nifedipine only had an effect on ROCE (Fig. 3, C and D). This is consistent with the data in Fig. 3, A and B, which demonstrated that nifedipine had a smaller effect on carbachol-induced changes in Ca2+i in the T1R3 knockdown cells in which ROCE was absent. Because we observed these changes in carbachol signaling in MIN6 cells in which T1R3 expression was stably suppressed and because we have shown previously that the T1R1/T1R3 complex is an early sensor of amino acids, we hypothesized that depriving"

Two such fusions were obtained, corresponding to a translational yfp insertion in iscR and iolR, respectively. Both fusions were further validated, and the IscR::YFP fluorescent nucleoid reporter together with time-lapse fluorescence microscopy was subsequently used to monitor nucleoid dynamics in response to the filamentation imposed by growth of LT2 at high hydrostatic pressure (40–45 MPa). As such, we were able to reveal that upon decompression the apparently entangled LT2 chromosomes in filamentous cells rapidly and efficiently segregate, after which septation of the filament occurs. In the course of the latter process, however, cells with a “trilobed” nucleoid were regularly observed, indicative for an imbalance between septum formation and chromosome segregation."
