https://openalex.org/W2123696077,"A catalogue of molecular aberrations that cause ovarian cancer is critical for developing and deploying therapies that will improve patients’ lives. The Cancer Genome Atlas project has analysed messenger RNA expression, microRNA expression, promoter methylation and DNA copy number in 489 high-grade serous ovarian adenocarcinomas and the DNA sequences of exons from coding genes in 316 of these tumours. Here we report that high-grade serous ovarian cancer is characterized by TP53 mutations in almost all tumours (96%); low prevalence but statistically recurrent somatic mutations in nine further genes including NF1, BRCA1, BRCA2, RB1 and CDK12; 113 significant focal DNA copy number aberrations; and promoter methylation events involving 168 genes. Analyses delineated four ovarian cancer transcriptional subtypes, three microRNA subtypes, four promoter methylation subtypes and a transcriptional signature associated with survival duration, and shed new light on the impact that tumours with BRCA1/2 (BRCA1 or BRCA2) and CCNE1 aberrations have on survival. Pathway analyses suggested that homologous recombination is defective in about half of the tumours analysed, and that NOTCH and FOXM1 signalling are involved in serous ovarian cancer pathophysiology."
https://openalex.org/W1975627161,"Quasars have historically been identified in optical surveys, which are insensitive to sources at z > 6.5. Infrared deep-sky survey data now make it possible to explore higher redshifts, with the result that a luminous quasar (ULAS J1120+0641) with a redshift z = 7.085, beyond the previous high of z = 6.44, has now been identified. Further observations of this and other distant quasars should reveal the ionization state of the Universe as it was only about 0.75 billion years after the Big Bang. The intergalactic medium was not completely reionized until approximately a billion years after the Big Bang, as revealed1 by observations of quasars with redshifts of less than 6.5. It has been difficult to probe to higher redshifts, however, because quasars have historically been identified2,3,4 in optical surveys, which are insensitive to sources at redshifts exceeding 6.5. Here we report observations of a quasar (ULAS J112001.48+064124.3) at a redshift of 7.085, which is 0.77 billion years after the Big Bang. ULAS J1120+0641 has a luminosity of 6.3 × 1013L⊙ and hosts a black hole with a mass of 2 × 109M⊙ (where L⊙ and M⊙ are the luminosity and mass of the Sun). The measured radius of the ionized near zone around ULAS J1120+0641 is 1.9 megaparsecs, a factor of three smaller than is typical for quasars at redshifts between 6.0 and 6.4. The near-zone transmission profile is consistent with a Lyα damping wing5, suggesting that the neutral fraction of the intergalactic medium in front of ULAS J1120+0641 exceeded 0.1."

Recent technological advances have made it possible to implement atomic-physics and quantum-optics experiments on a chip using these artificial atoms. This review presents a brief overview of the progress achieved so far in this rapidly advancing field. We not only discuss phenomena analogous to those in atomic physics and quantum optics with natural atoms, but also highlight those not occurring in natural atoms. In addition, we summarize several prospective directions in this emerging interdisciplinary field."
https://openalex.org/W1964567249,"Macrophages and dendritic cells have key roles in viral infections, providing virus reservoirs that frequently resist antiviral therapies and linking innate virus detection to antiviral adaptive immune responses. Human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) fails to transduce dendritic cells and has a reduced ability to transduce macrophages, due to an as yet uncharacterized mechanism that inhibits infection by interfering with efficient synthesis of viral complementary DNA. In contrast, HIV-2 and related simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIVsm/mac) transduce myeloid cells efficiently owing to their virion-associated Vpx accessory proteins, which counteract the restrictive mechanism. Here we show that the inhibition of HIV-1 infection in macrophages involves the cellular SAM domain HD domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1). Vpx relieves the inhibition of lentivirus infection in macrophages by loading SAMHD1 onto the CRL4(DCAF1) E3 ubiquitin ligase, leading to highly efficient proteasome-dependent degradation of the protein. Mutations in SAMHD1 cause Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, a disease that produces a phenotype that mimics the effects of a congenital viral infection. Failure to dispose of endogenous nucleic acid debris in Aicardi-Goutières syndrome results in inappropriate triggering of innate immune responses via cytosolic nucleic acids sensors. Thus, our findings show that macrophages are defended from HIV-1 infection by a mechanism that prevents an unwanted interferon response triggered by self nucleic acids, and uncover an intricate relationship between innate immune mechanisms that control response to self and to retroviral pathogens."

Whereas methyltransferases mediate cytosine methylation, it is less clear how unmethylated regions in mammalian genomes are protected from de novo methylation and whether an active demethylating activity is involved. Here, we show that either knockout or catalytic inactivation of the DNA repair enzyme thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) leads to embryonic lethality in mice. TDG is necessary for recruiting p300 to retinoic acid (RA)-regulated promoters, protection of CpG islands from hypermethylation, and active demethylation of tissue-specific developmentally and hormonally regulated promoters and enhancers.

These findings highlight a dual role for TDG in promoting proper epigenetic states during development and suggest a two-step mechanism for DNA demethylation in mammals, whereby 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine are first deaminated by AID to thymine and 5-hydroxymethyluracil, respectively, followed by TDG-mediated thymine and 5-hydroxymethyluracil excision repair.PaperClip/cms/asset/cea686de-7f90-4ea3-aa49-800519018a07/mmc2.mp3Loading ...(mp3, 2.64 MB) Download audio DNA methylation is a major epigenetic mechanism for gene silencing.

The establishment and maintenance of the correct DNA methylation patterns at CpG sites is essential in mammals during development, gametogenesis, and differentiation of somatic tissues. Indeed, alterations in DNA methylation patterns, with the associated chromatin changes, have profound consequences, as demonstrated by embryonic lethality in the absence of DNA methylation (Li et al., 1992Li E.

Whereas DNA methylation is mediated by de novo DNA methyltransferases (DNMT3a and DNMT3b) that act on unmethylated DNA and maintenance DNA methyltransferases (DNMT1) that act on newly replicated, transiently hemimethylated DNA, the demethylating activities or processes that remove methylation marks in mammals are largely unknown. Indeed, it has been controversial as to whether demethylation is an active process in mammals (Ooi and Bestor, 2008Ooi S.K. Bestor T.H. The colorful history of active DNA demethylation.Cell. 2008; 133: 1145-1148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar) and which mechanisms are involved (Wu and Zhang, 2010Wu S.C. Zhang Y. Active DNA demethylation: many roads lead to Rome.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Demethylation can occur passively due to replication in the absence of remethylation, with consequent dilution of this modification. However, there is evidence supporting the occurrence of active demethylation in mammals, including demethylation of the paternal genome shortly after fertilization (Mayer et al., 2000Mayer W.

In addition, it is generally thought that active transcription contributes to the maintenance of the unmethylated state of promoter-associated CpG-rich sequences known as CpG islands, but the molecular details of protection from hypermethylation and the potential involvement of an active demethylation process are unknown (Illingworth and Bird, 2009Illingworth R.S.

Accumulating evidence in nonmammalian model organisms points to the involvement of DNA repair mechanisms in active demethylation (Gehring et al., 2009Gehring M. Reik W. Henikoff S.

In Arabidopsis, the base excision repair (BER) proteins Demeter and ROS1 affect demethylation by directly removing 5mC through their glycosylase activities (Gehring et al., 2006Gehring M. Huh J.H.

USA. 2006; 103: 6853-6858Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In Xenopus, demethylation has been reported to be initiated by the genome stability protein Gadd45a (growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible protein 45 α) in a process dependent on the nucleotide excision repair protein XPG (Barreto et al., 2007Barreto G.

GADD45A does not promote DNA demethylation.PLoS Genet. 2008; 4: e1000013Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In zebrafish embryos, rapid demethylation of exogenous and genomic DNA occurs in two coupled steps: enzymatic 5mC deamination to thymine by activation-induced deaminase (AID) or apolipoprotein B RNA-editing catalytic component 2b and 2a (Apobec2b, 2a), followed by removal of the mismatched thymine by the zebrafish thymine glycosylase MBD4, with Gadd45 promoting the reaction (Rai et al., 2008Rai K.

Recently, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), an oxidative product of 5mC generated by the Tet hydroxylases (Kriaucionis and Heintz, 2009Kriaucionis S. Heintz N.

Zhang Y. Active DNA demethylation: many roads lead to Rome.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 607-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). During gene activation in the adult mouse brain, demethylation by TET1-mediated hydroxylation of 5meC to 5hmC was promoted by AID/Apobec deaminases in a process that generates 5-hydroxymethyluracil (5hmU) and ultimately requires BER, although the specific glycosylases involved were not identified (Guo et al., 2011Guo J.U.

Numerous in vitro studies have documented a potential role of the BER enzyme TDG (thymine DNA glycosylase) in transcriptional regulation and demethylation. Indeed, TDG interacts with several transcription factors, including retinoic acid receptor (RAR), retinoid X receptor (RXR) (Um et al., 1998Um S. Harbers M. Benecke A. Pierrat B. Losson R. Chambon P.

It has been proposed that TDG may be responsible for demethylation either through a direct 5mC glycosylase activity (Zhu et al., 2000Zhu B. Zheng Y. Hess D. Angliker H. Schwarz S. Siegmann M. Thiry S. Jost J.P. 5-methylcytosine-DNA glycosylase activity is present in a cloned G/T mismatch DNA glycosylase associated with the chicken embryo DNA demethylation complex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2000; 97: 5135-5139Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) or indirectly by acting on G:T mismatches originated by a controlled deaminase activity of DNMT3a and DNMT3b (Métivier et al., 2008Métivier R. Gallais R. Tiffoche C. Le Péron C. Jurkowska R.Z. Carmouche R.P. Ibberson D. Barath P. Demay F. Reid G. et al.Cyclical DNA methylation of a transcriptionally active promoter.Nature. 2008; 452: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Very recently, TDG was shown to be involved in maintaining active and bivalent chromatin marks in mouse embryo fibroblasts and ES cells undergoing neuronal differentiation, respectively, but the mechanism for such epigenetic effects and the requirement of its catalytic activity were not clarified (Cortázar et al., 2011Cortázar D. Kunz C. Selfridge J. Lettieri T. Saito Y. MacDougall E. Wirz A. Schuermann D. Jacobs A.L. Siegrist F. et al.Embryonic lethal phenotype reveals a function of TDG in maintaining epigenetic stability.Nature. 2011; 470: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). To investigate the functional role of TDG in epigenetic regulation, DNA demethylation, and mammalian development, we generated mice with targeted inactivation of the Tdg gene. Tdg null embryos die in midgestation and exhibit a complex developmental phenotype that appears to derive from the failure to establish and maintain proper DNA methylation patterns at promoters and enhancers. A knockin mutation that inactivates the glycosylase function of TDG is also embryonically lethal, and TDG is found in a complex with AID and GADD45a. These findings suggest a two-step catalytic mechanism for DNA demethylation that is essential for mammalian development. The Tdg gene was deleted in mice by homologous recombination, using a targeting construct that removed exons 3–7, corresponding to most of the catalytic domain (Figure S1 available online). The resulting Tdg− allele does not produce detectable protein by western blotting (Figure 1A ), suggesting that it is null. TDG is dispensable for efficient uracil removal from G:U mismatches (Figure S2). However, removal of the mispaired thymine from G:T mismatch-containing oligonucleotides is virtually abrogated in Tdg−/− homozygous mouse embryo fibroblast (MEF, vide infra) nuclear extracts (Figure 1B), thus confirming that Tdg− is a null allele and suggesting that TDG is the predominant G:T mismatch repair activity in MEFs.Figure 1Developmental Defects in Tdg Null EmbryosShow full caption(A) The expression of TDG was monitored by western blot.

Repair of a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a G:U mismatch in a CpG context by nuclear extracts of MEFs with different genotypes. Reaction with recombinant MED1 (rM) was used as a size marker for cleavage at the mismatched uracil. One reaction received neither lysate not recombinant enzyme (0). Migration of the substrate and product bands is indicated. Whereas heterozygous Tdg+/− mice are viable and fertile and show no obvious phenotype, homozygosity for the null Tdg allele leads to embryonic lethality. In fact, when heterozygous Tdg+/− mice were interbred, no live birth Tdg−/− homozygotes were derived. Specifically, the numbers of wild-type, heterozygous, and homozygous mutant pups obtained were 11, 29, and 0, respectively, which is significantly different from the expected Mendelian ratios (p < 0.0008 by χ2). To examine in detail the embryonic lethality, timed matings were set up between Tdg+/− heterozygotes, and pregnant mice were sacrificed at different gestation times, ranging from embryonic day (E) 10.5 to E14.5. This analysis revealed an arrest of development associated with Tdg nullizygosity at E11.5; at later gestation times, homozygous mutant embryos are beginning to be resorbed (E12.5–13.5) or are completely resorbed and never detected (E14.5) (Table S1). At E11.5, developmentally arrested Tdg null embryos manifest a complex phenotype characterized macroscopically by abdominal (liver) hemorrhage, pericardial edema/hemorrhage, hypoplastic branchial arches, delayed limb development, prominent telencephalic vesicles, and diffuse hemorrhagic lesions (Figures 1C, 1D, 1G, and 1H). Microscopically, Tdg null embryos exhibit specific patterning defects of the developing heart, with the most significant abnormalities seen in the outflow tract (OFT) (Figure 1I and 1J and Figures S3A–S3D ); vasculogenesis defects of dorsal aortae, carotid arteries, and branchial arteries (Figures 1E and 1F); and generalized defect of angiogenesis, particularly evident as altered branching of the internal carotid (Figure 1F) and the coronaries (Figures S3E and S3F). TDG has two proposed roles in mutational avoidance (DNA repair) and transcriptional regulation (Cortázar et al., 2007Cortázar D. Kunz C. Saito Y. Steinacher R. Schär P. The enigmatic thymine DNA glycosylase.DNA Repair (Amst.). 2007; 6: 489-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The embryo phenotype was fully penetrant and reproducible, which is inconsistent with an antimutagenic DNA repair defect that would be expected to yield a variable, heterogeneous phenotype caused by stochastic secondary mutations at different target genes. We therefore focused on the role of TDG in transcription as a possible mechanistic explanation of the phenotype. Remarkably, many features of the phenotype of Tdg null embryos (altered vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, hemorrhagic lesions, heart abnormalities with thinning of the myocardium, and pericardial effusion) have been previously described for either Cbp−/− or p300−/− embryos (Tanaka et al., 2000Tanaka Y. Naruse I. Hongo T. Xu M. Nakahata T. Maekawa T. Ishii S. Extensive brain hemorrhage and embryonic lethality in a mouse null mutant of CREB-binding protein.Mech.

Gene dosage-dependent embryonic development and proliferation defects in mice lacking the transcriptional integrator p300.Cell. 1998; 93: 361-372Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). Similarly, some other specific phenotypic features in Tdg null embryos (OFT septation defects, hypoplastic myocardium, abnormal great arteries derived from branchial arches, delayed limbs) resemble those of embryos deficient in various Rar and Rxr genes (Mark et al., 2006Mark M. Ghyselinck N.B. Chambon P. Function of retinoid nuclear receptors: lessons from genetic and pharmacological dissections of the retinoic acid signaling pathway during mouse embryogenesis.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2006; 46: 451-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) or hypomorphic for retinaldehyde dehydrogenase, the enzyme involved in RA biosynthesis (Vermot et al., 2003Vermot J. Niederreither K. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. Dollé P. Decreased embryonic retinoic acid synthesis results in a DiGeorge syndrome phenotype in newborn mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2003; 100: 1763-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We infer that the lethality phenotype is likely related to the inactivation of a developmentally relevant, transcription-related function of TDG. In order to investigate this issue directly, we established MEF lines from Tdg null embryos. We hypothesized that, given the phenotypic features described above, it is possible that RAR/RXR and p300 activity might be reduced in the absence of TDG. Indeed, assay of p300 activity with reporter constructs indicated that transcriptional coactivation by this acetyltransferase is significantly reduced in two independent Tdg−/− MEF lines in comparison to wild-type MEF lines (Figure 2A ). RA-dependent RAR/RXR transcriptional activity is also attenuated in Tdg null MEFs (Figure 2B). To clarify the role of TDG in transcription, we compared the transcriptome of wild-type and Tdg null MEFs. In keeping with a role of TDG in transcriptional activation, of the 108 differentially expressed genes from 120 probe sets, approximately t"

Here we report that dying tumor cells use the apoptotic process to generate potent growth-stimulating signals to stimulate the repopulation of tumors undergoing radiotherapy. Furthermore, activated caspase 3, a key executioner in apoptosis, is involved in the growth stimulation. One downstream effector that caspase 3 regulates is prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)), which can potently stimulate growth of surviving tumor cells. Deficiency of caspase 3 either in tumor cells or in tumor stroma caused substantial tumor sensitivity to radiotherapy in xenograft or mouse tumors. In human subjects with cancer, higher amounts of activated caspase 3 in tumor tissues are correlated with markedly increased rate of recurrence and death. We propose the existence of a cell death-induced tumor repopulation pathway in which caspase 3 has a major role."
https://openalex.org/W1982166691,"A search through hydrophobic chemical space identifies an adamantane tag that targets dehalogenase fusion proteins for degradation, as demonstrated for both cytosolic and transmembrane proteins; and in zebrafish and mice. This molecule provides a new tool to study protein function with precise control. The ability to regulate any protein of interest in living systems with small molecules remains a challenge. We hypothesized that appending a hydrophobic moiety to the surface of a protein would mimic the partially denatured state of the protein, thus engaging the cellular quality control machinery to induce its proteasomal degradation. We designed and synthesized bifunctional small molecules to bind a bacterial dehalogenase (the HaloTag protein) and present a hydrophobic group on its surface. Hydrophobic tagging of the HaloTag protein with an adamantyl moiety induced the degradation of cytosolic, isoprenylated and transmembrane HaloTag fusion proteins in cell culture. We demonstrated the in vivo utility of hydrophobic tagging by degrading proteins expressed in zebrafish embryos and by inhibiting Hras1G12V-driven tumor progression in mice. Therefore, hydrophobic tagging of HaloTag fusion proteins affords small-molecule control over any protein of interest, making it an ideal system for validating potential drug targets in disease models."

https://openalex.org/W2075625863,"The size distribution of neuronal avalanches in cortical networks has been reported to follow a power law distribution with exponent close to -1.5, which is a reflection of long-range spatial correlations in spontaneous neuronal activity. However, identifying power law scaling in empirical data can be difficult and sometimes controversial. In the present study, we tested the power law hypothesis for neuronal avalanches by using more stringent statistical analyses. In particular, we performed the following steps: (i) analysis of finite-size scaling to identify scale-free dynamics in neuronal avalanches, (ii) model parameter estimation to determine the specific exponent of the power law, and (iii) comparison of the power law to alternative model distributions. Consistent with critical state dynamics, avalanche size distributions exhibited robust scaling behavior in which the maximum avalanche size was limited only by the spatial extent of sampling (""finite size"" effect). This scale-free dynamics suggests the power law as a model for the distribution of avalanche sizes. Using both the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and a maximum likelihood approach, we found the slope to be close to -1.5, which is in line with previous reports. Finally, the power law model for neuronal avalanches was compared to the exponential and to various heavy-tail distributions based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance and by using a log-likelihood ratio test. Both the power law distribution without and with exponential cut-off provided significantly better fits to the cluster size distributions in neuronal avalanches than the exponential, the lognormal and the gamma distribution. In summary, our findings strongly support the power law scaling in neuronal avalanches, providing further evidence for critical state dynamics in superficial layers of cortex."

However, limited genetic research has focused on this group of animals so far, which is, in part, due to the lack of genomic resources. The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies enables generation of genomic resources in a short time and at a minimal cost, and therefore provides a turning point for bivalve research. In the present study, we performed de novo transcriptome sequencing to first produce a comprehensive expressed sequence tag (EST) dataset for the Yesso scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis).In a single 454 sequencing run, 805,330 reads were produced and then assembled into 32,590 contigs, with about six-fold sequencing coverage. A total of 25,237 unique protein-coding genes were identified from a variety of developmental stages and adult tissues based on sequence similarities with known proteins. As determined by GO annotation and KEGG pathway mapping, functional annotation of the unigenes recovered diverse biological functions and processes. Transcripts putatively involved in growth, reproduction and stress/immune-response were identified. More than 49,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 2,700 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were also detected.Our data provide the most comprehensive transcriptomic resource currently available for P. yessoensis. Candidate genes potentially involved in growth, reproduction, and stress/immunity-response were identified, and are worthy of further investigation. A large number of SNPs and SSRs were also identified and ready for marker development. This resource should lay an important foundation for future genetic or genomic studies on this species."
https://openalex.org/W2046501815,"Morphology evolves often through changes in developmental genes, but the causal mutations, and their effects, remain largely unknown. The evolution of naked cuticle on larvae of Drosophila sechellia resulted from changes in five transcriptional enhancers of shavenbaby (svb), a transcript of the ovo locus that encodes a transcription factor that governs morphogenesis of microtrichiae, hereafter called ‘trichomes’. Here we show that the function of one of these enhancers evolved through multiple single-nucleotide substitutions that altered both the timing and level of svb expression. The consequences of these nucleotide substitutions on larval morphology were quantified with a novel functional assay. We found that each substitution had a relatively small phenotypic effect, and that many nucleotide changes account for this large morphological difference. In addition, we observed that the substitutions had non-additive effects. These data provide unprecedented resolution of the phenotypic effects of substitutions and show how individual nucleotide changes in a transcriptional enhancer have caused morphological evolution. Morphological evolution often involves changes in developmental genes, but the number and effects of the causal mutations remain largely unknown. Frankel et al. use the gene shavenbaby in Drosophila sechellia as a model system for studying the genetics of this phenomenon. They show that evolutionary change in one of the five cis-regulatory enhancers of shavenbaby resulted from many nucleotide substitutions that altered both the timing and level of gene expression. Thus many mutations of small effect — not just one mutation of large effect — were needed for this fruitfly to evolve a hairless larva. The work provides quantitative support, at the single nucleotide substitution level, for Charles Darwin's favoured view of a 'gradualist' evolutionary process."
https://openalex.org/W2078434863,"The ability to rapidly regulate the functions of specific proteins in living cells is a valuable tool for biological research. Here we describe a new technique by which the degradation of a specific protein is induced by a small molecule. A protein of interest is fused to a ligand-induced degradation (LID) domain, resulting in the expression of a stable and functional fusion protein. The LID domain is comprised of the FK506- and rapamycin-binding protein (FKBP) and a 19-amino-acid degron fused to the C terminus of FKBP. In the absence of the small molecule Shield-1, the degron is bound to the FKBP fusion protein and the protein is stable. When present, Shield-1 binds tightly to FKBP, displacing the degron and inducing rapid and processive degradation of the LID domain and any fused partner protein. Structure-function studies of the 19-residue peptide showed that a 4-amino-acid sequence within the peptide is responsible for degradation."
https://openalex.org/W1965445778,"The PWWP domain was first identified as a structural motif of 100-130 amino acids in the WHSC1 protein and predicted to be a protein-protein interaction domain. It belongs to the Tudor domain 'Royal Family', which consists of Tudor, chromodomain, MBT and PWWP domains. While Tudor, chromodomain and MBT domains have long been known to bind methylated histones, PWWP was shown to exhibit histone binding ability only until recently.The PWWP domain has been shown to be a DNA binding domain, but sequence analysis and previous structural studies show that the PWWP domain exhibits significant similarity to other 'Royal Family' members, implying that the PWWP domain has the potential to bind histones. In order to further explore the function of the PWWP domain, we used the protein family approach to determine the crystal structures of the PWWP domains from seven different human proteins. Our fluorescence polarization binding studies show that PWWP domains have weak histone binding ability, which is also confirmed by our NMR titration experiments. Furthermore, we determined the crystal structures of the BRPF1 PWWP domain in complex with H3K36me3, and HDGF2 PWWP domain in complex with H3K79me3 and H4K20me3.PWWP proteins constitute a new family of methyl lysine histone binders. The PWWP domain consists of three motifs: a canonical β-barrel core, an insertion motif between the second and third β-strands and a C-terminal α-helix bundle. Both the canonical β-barrel core and the insertion motif are directly involved in histone binding. The PWWP domain has been previously shown to be a DNA binding domain. Therefore, the PWWP domain exhibits dual functions: binding both DNA and methyllysine histones.This article can also be viewed as an enhanced version in which the text of the article is integrated with interactive 3D representations and animated transitions.

Disturbance of cation homeostasis in brains is indicated in Parkinson disease pathogenesis. In this study, we explored the biological function of ATP13A2 as well as the pathogenic mechanism of KRS pathogenic ATP13A2 mutants. The results revealed that wild-type ATP13A2, but not the KRS pathogenic ATP13A2 mutants, protected cells from Mn(2+)-induced cell death in mammalian cell lines and primary rat neuronal cultures. In addition, wild-type ATP13A2 reduced intracellular manganese concentrations and prevented cytochrome c release from mitochondria compared with the pathogenic mutants. Furthermore, endogenous ATP13A2 was up-regulated upon Mn(2+) treatment. Our results suggest that ATP13A2 plays important roles in protecting cells against manganese cytotoxicity via regulating intracellular manganese homeostasis.

https://openalex.org/W2076723806,"Survival rates for patients with pancreatic cancer are extremely poor due to its asymptomatic progression to advanced and metastatic stage for which current therapies remain largely ineffective. Therefore, novel therapeutic agents and treatment approaches are desired to improve the clinical outcome. In this study, we determined the effects of honokiol, a biologically active constituent of oriental medicinal herb Magnolia officinalis/grandiflora, on two pancreatic cancer cell lines, MiaPaCa and Panc1, alone and in combination with the standard chemotherapeutic drug, gemcitabine. Honokiol exerted growth inhibitory effects on both the pancreatic cancer cell lines by causing cell cycle arrest at G₁ phase and induction of apoptosis. At the molecular level, honokiol markedly decreased the expression of cyclins (D1 and E) and cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk2 and Cdk4), and caused an increase in Cdk inhibitors, p21 and p27. Furthermore, honokiol treatment led to augmentation of Bax/Bcl-2 and Bax/Bcl-xL ratios to favor apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells. These changes were accompanied by enhanced cytoplasmic accumulation of NF-κB with a concomitant decrease in nuclear fraction and reduced transcriptional activity of NF-κB responsive promoter. This was associated with decreased phosphorylation of inhibitor of kappa B alpha (IκB-α) causing its stabilization and thus increased cellular levels. Importantly, honokiol also potentiated the cytotoxic effects of gemcitabine, in part, by restricting the gemcitabine-induced nuclear accumulation of NF-κB in the treated pancreatic cancer cell lines. Altogether, these findings demonstrate, for the first time, the growth inhibitory effects of honokiol in pancreatic cancer and indicate its potential usefulness as a novel natural agent in prevention and therapy."

Heo Y.S. Kim C.M. Hyun Y.L. Lee T.G. Ro S. Cho J.M. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2005; 62: 1198-1220Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Here, we show that PDE2A isoform 2 is specifically targeted to the mitochondrial matrix, where it forms a local signaling system with sAC regulating the respiratory chain. Our findings complete the cAMP signaling system in mitochondria and have implications for understanding and pharmacologically targeting mitochondrial processes and specific PDE isoforms. For the import experiments and initial characterization of lysates in PDE activity and inhibition assays, mitochondria from rat liver and brain were enriched using differential centrifugation. Homogenized liver or brain cells in ice-cold isolation buffer (2 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 220 mm mannitol, and 70 mm sucrose) were disrupted mechanically. To remove cell debris and nuclei, lysates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 3 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was centrifuged two more times. Mitochondria were collected by centrifugation at 26,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet was washed in isolation buffer and recentrifuged twice, and the mitochondria were finally resuspended in 2 ml of isolation buffer. For Western blot analysis and functional assays on mitochondria, highly pure mitochondria were prepared from mouse liver and brain mitochondria as described (28Fernández-Vizarra E. López-Pérez M.J. Enriquez J.A. Methods. 2002; 26: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Isolated mitochondria were incubated with sAC or PDE inhibitors in MAITE medium (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 25 mm sucrose; 75 mm sorbitol; 100 mm KCl; 10 mm K2HPO4; 0.05 mm EDTA; 5 mm MgCl2; 1 mg/ml BSA) in the presence of a mixture of phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich). The following conditions were used for all experiments: 1 mm 8Br-cAMP (Sigma-Aldrich), 15 μm erythro-9-(2-hydroxyl-3-nonyl)adenine (EHNA) (Tocris), 20 nm BAY60-7550 (Tocris), 1 μm rolipram (Sigma-Aldrich), and 25 μm KH7 for 10 min. For protein localization, pure brain mitochondria were isolated using a Percoll gradient as described previously (29Fischer L.R. Igoudjil A. Magrané J. Li Y. Hansen J.M. Manfredi G. Glass J.D. Brain. 2011; 134: 196-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). 500 μg of mitochondria (10 mg/ml) were resuspended in MS-EGTA (225 mm mannitol, 75 mm sucrose, 5 mm HEPES, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4). Water (1/10 volume) and digitonin (1 mg of digitonin/5 mg of mitochondrial protein) were added, and the mixture was incubated on ice for 45 min. Then, KCl (150 mm) was added followed by incubation for 2 min on ice and centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet containing the mitoplast fraction was resuspended at 1 mg/ml in 300 mm Tris-HCl, 10 μm CaCl2, pH 7.4. The supernatant containing the post-mitoplast fraction was precipitated with 12% TCA and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 500 μl of acetone and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. For protease protection assays, 20 μg of mitochondrial protein were treated with 20 μg/ml proteinase K (PK) for 20 min on ice. Then, PK was inactivated with 2 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) for 10 min on ice. Prior to PK treatment, one aliquot of mitochondria was solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 15 min on ice. For Western blot analyses of mitochondria and mitoplast samples, 25 μg of protein were separated by 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and electroblotted onto PVDF filters (Bio-Rad). For protein detection, the following antibodies were used: cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunit I (Invitrogen), Hsp60, grp75, and cytochrome c (StressGen); PDE2A (K-20, Cell Signaling); Tim23 (BD Transduction Laboratories); and β-actin (Sigma-Aldrich). For the characterization of the PDE activity in mitochondrial lysates, cAMP- and cGMP-degrading activities were determined in a radioactive assay, using 10 μm [32P]cAMP or [32P]cGMP as substrate and 10-min incubations, as described before (30Jäger R. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Koesling D. Russwurm M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2010; 161: 1645-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Measurements of mitochondrial cAMP levels after treatment of whole organelles were performed according to manufacturer's instructions using the Direct Correlate-EIA cAMP kit (Assay Designs Inc.). 100 μl of sample were measured. If necessary, samples were diluted to bring the cAMP level of the sample within the linear range of the assay. For the in vitro test, fragments coding for PDE2A2(1–210) and PDE2A2(18–210) of mouse PDE2A2 (NM_001143849.1, designated as transcript variant/isoform 3 in contrast to the original designation PDE2A2 (gene identifier 706929), see Refs. 24Yang Q.

Pharmacol. 1999; 135: 67-104Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were cloned using BamHI and XhoI into pCDNA3.1zeo(+) with two additional methionine residues at the C terminus. For cloning PDE(1–17)-Map(45–203), an additional SacII restriction site was introduced into PDE2A2 by site-directed mutagenesis, resulting in an insertion encoding an additional proline and arginine. After restriction, the fragment for the PDE2A2 N terminus was ligated into a cleaved pCDNA3.1zeo(+)-Map(45–203) plasmid. Radiolabeled proteins were synthesized in reticulocyte lysate (TnT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system, Promega) containing [35S]Met. Rat liver mitochondria were isolated as described before (33Domańska G. Motz C. Meinecke M. Harsman A. Papatheodorou P. Reljic B. Dian-Lothrop E.A. Galmiche A. Kepp O. Becker L. Günnewig K. Wagner R. Rassow J. PLoS Pathog. 2010; 6: e1000878Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The mitochondria (30 μg of mitochondrial protein) were incubated with 5 μl of reticulocyte lysate in 50 μl of 250 mm sucrose, 80 mm KCl, 20 mm potassium phosphate, 2 mm NADH, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.2, containing 3% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. After incubation at 25 °C for 10 min, the mitochondria were reisolated by centrifugation (10 min 16,000 × g). To remove residual reticulocyte lysate, the mitochondria were resuspended in 100 μl of 250 mm sucrose, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MOPS/KOH, pH 7.2, and again reisolated. Mitochondria-associated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed using a BAS-1800 II imager (Fujifilm). For the in vivo localization studies, the gene fragment coding for the N terminus (amino acids 1–216) of PDE2A isoform 2 (NM_001143849.1, see above) was cloned using EcoRI and BamHI into pEGFP-N3 (Clontech) to yield a construct with C-terminally fused GFP. For comparison, we used similar constructs for PDE2A isoforms 1 and 3 fused to CFP as described before (34Russwurm C. Zoidl G. Koesling D. Russwurm M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 25782-25790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For expression, each PDE fusion construct was co-transfected with pDsRed-mito (Clontech), which codes for a fusion of Dicosoma sp. red fluorescent protein (DsRed) with the mitochondrial targeting sequence of human cytochrome c oxidase subunit VIII, into HEK-293 cells using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) and standard procedures. PDE isoform constructs and DsRed-mito were expressed under control of the immediate early promoter of cytomegalovirus, and cells from three independent expression experiments were visualized using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta system and a Plan-Neofluar 100×/1.3 objective in sequential scan mode using the 458 (CFP), 488 (EGFP), and 564 nm (DsRed) laser lines with corresponding band-path filters. Image recordings were optimized using the LSM 510 software with images representing single focal planes with a pixel resolution of 0.09 × 0.09 μm. Images were imported into ImageJ, background was subtracted, and regions of interest representing >100 cells for each condition were subjected to intensity correlation analysis (35Li Q. Lau A. Morris T.J. Guo L. Fordyce C.B. Stanley E.F. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 4070-4081Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Pearson's correlation coefficients were calculated with a value of 1 representing perfect correlation; −1 represents perfect exclusion, and zero represents random localization. Because values close to zero have to be critically evaluated, we calculated in addition the intensity correlation quotient (ICQ) with random staining: ICQ ∼0; segregated staining: 0 > ICQ ≥ −0.5; dependent staining: 0 < ICQ ≤ +0.5. Significance values were calculated using an unpaired Student's t test with p > 0.01. Oligomycin-sensitive mitochondrial ATP synthesis was measured in isolated mitochondria (15–25 μg of protein) in the presence of ADP (0.1 mm) and malate plus pyruvate (1 mm each) as substrates and of the adenylate kinase inhibitor diadenosine pentaphosphate (0.15 mm), using a kinetic luciferase-luciferin detection system in a recording luminometer, as described previously (36Vives-Bauza C. Yang L. Manfredi G. Methods Cell Biol. 2007; 80: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). These conditions yielded linear ATP synthesis rates, which were expressed as rate (nmol/min) of ATP production/mg of mitochondrial protein. Pyruvate/malate-driven oxygen consumption was measured in isolated mitochondria using an Oxygraph system equipped with a Clark electrode (Hansatech; 100 μg of protein) in the presence of ADP, as described previously (37Hofhaus G. Shakeley R.M. Attardi G. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 264: 476-483Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mitochondrial respiration was expressed as μmol of O2 consumed/min/mg of mitochondrial protein. COX activity in isolated mitochondria (2–5 μg of mitochondrial protein) was measured spectrophotometrically as described (38Birch-Machin M.A. Turnbull D.M. Methods Cell Biol. 2001; 65: 97-117Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We recently showed that sAC-dependent cAMP formation in the matrix of liver mitochondria regulates respiration (8Acin-Perez R. Salazar E. Kamenetsky M. Buck J. Levin L.R. Manfredi G. Cell Metab. 2009; 9: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). We now demonstrate that cAMP also increases ATP production in mitochondria isolated from brain via stimulation of the electron transport chain (Fig. 1A). This form of regulation thus exists in liver and brain, and we assume that it will prove to be a general mitochondrial mechanism. We also showed that cAMP does not pass through the inner mitochondrial membrane (8Acin-Perez R. Salazar E. Kamenetsky M. Buck J. Levin L.R. Manfredi G. Cell Metab. 2009; 9: 265-276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar); thus, this signaling pathway requires a mitochondrial cAMP-degrading PDE for switching off the signal. As a first step toward identifying candidate isoforms for such a mitochondrial PDE, we analyzed lysates of isolated mitochondria from rat liver and brain for cAMP- and cGMP-degrading activities in the absence and presence of different PDE inhibitors (Fig. 1, B and C). Mitochondrial homogenates from both tissues contained readily detectable cAMP- and cGMP-degrading activities. The cAMP-degrading mitochondrial activities from liver and brain were inhibited by ∼50 and 70%, respectively, by the non-selective PDE inhibitor 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthin (IBMX; Fig. 1B). In contrast, cGMP-degrading activity found in mitochondria from both tissues was almost completely inhibited by this non-selective PDE inhibitor (Fig. 1C). To further characterize the PDE isoforms responsible for these activities, isoform-specific inhibitors of PDEs 1 through 5 were employed. The inhibitors of PDE1 (vinpocetine), PDE3 (milrinone), and PDE5 (sildenafil) had little to no effect on cAMP- or cGMP-degrading activities in mitochondrial homogenates from either tissue (Fig. 1, B and 1C). In contrast, the inhibitor BAY60-7550 (“BAY60”), which is specific for PDE2A, a PDE that can degrade both cAMP and cGMP, inhibited the cAMP-degrading activities significantly (Fig. 1B). BAY60 inhibited the activity from liver mitochondria to an extent comparable with IBMX and inhibited activity from brain mitochondria slightly less than IBMX. To evaluate the specificity of BAY60, concentration-response curves for inhibition of mitochondrial cAMP-degrading activity by this compound were recorded (Fig. 1D). The obtained IC50 of ∼10 nm for the BAY60-sensitive activity is in good agreement with the IC50 for BAY60 inhibition of PDE2 (4.7 nm (39Boess F.G. Hendrix M. van der Staay F.J. Erb C. Schreiber R. van Staveren W. de Vente J. Prickaerts J. Blokland A. Koenig G. Neuropharmacology. 2004; 47: 1081-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar)) and confirms specificity of the BAY60 effect. BAY60 also inhibited almost all cGMP-degrading activity present in mitochondrial homogenates from both tissues, comparable with the nonspecific inhibitor IBMX (Fig. 1C). Thus, PDE2A appears to be present in brain and liver mitochondrial fractions and to be responsible for all (liver) or most (brain) of the IBMX-sensitive PDE activity in mitochondria from these tissues. Rolipram, the inhibitor of PDE4, had no significant effect on cAMP-degrading activity from liver mitochondria but showed some inhibition of the activity from brain, albeit to a lesser extent than BAY60 (Fig. 1B). Thus, lysates from brain mitochondria seem to contain PDE4 in addition to PDE2A, and IBMX inhibition of brain mitochondrial PDE activity seems to correspond to the sum of the effects of the PDE4-selective rolipram and the PDE2A-selective BAY60. To further substantiate the identity of the mitochondrial IBMX-sensitive PDE as PDE2A, stimulation of this activity by cGMP was analyzed (Fig. 1E). In accordance with its known effects on PDE2 (40Beavo J.A. Hardman J.G. Sutherland E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3841-3846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Yamamoto T. Manganiello V.C. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12526-12533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cGMP stimulated cAMP degradation with an EC50 of ∼0.3 μm, and it inhibited at higher concentrations. cGMP stimulated cAMP degradation 2–3-fold, which is lower than reported (40Beavo J.A. Hardman J.G. Sutherland E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 3841-3846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Yamamoto T. Manganiello V.C. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 12526-12533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and might reflect the presence of an additional cAMP-degrading PDE, as suggested by the incomplete suppression of cAMP-degrading activity by IBMX or BAY60 described above. In conclusion, our results strongly suggest that brain and liver mitochondria contain PDE2A and a yet to be identified, IBMX-insensitive, cAMP-specific PDE (see “Discussion”). To confirm the presence of PDE2A in mitochondria and to elucidate the PDE2-containing subcompartment, we tested highly purified mitochondria and fractionated mitochondrial subcompartments with a PDE2A-specific antibody. Western blots of whole mitochondria isolated from liver and brain tissue showed positive bands of the expected molecular mass (∼105 kDa; Fig. 2A). Tissue homogenates from brain produced a stronger signal than those from liver, consistent with the previously demonstrated prominent expression of PDE2A in brain (22Rosman G.J. Martins T.J. Sonnenburg W.K. Beavo J.A. Ferguson K. Loughney K. Gene. 1997; 191: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 34Russwurm C. Zoidl G. Koesling D. Russwurm M. J. Biol.

Neuroscience. 1993; 56: 673-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); however, the PDE2A-specific signal in mitochondria from brain and liver was more comparable, revealing that differences in the levels of the mitochondrially localized PDE2A population are less pronounced. We next determined which mitochondrial subcompartment contains PDE2A using pure mitochondria from brain. Our Western blots revealed PDE2A in mitochondrial fractions and in the mitoplast fractions, but not in lysates after mitoplast removal (post-mitoplast; Fig. 2B). Furthermore, PDE2A was protected during proteinase K treatment of mitoplasts, as were hsp60 and grp75, two mitochondrial matrix proteins (Fig. 2C). Because post-mitoplast supernatants contain intermembrane space and outer membrane proteins and proteinase K treatment would digest accessible proteins, we conclude that PDE2A is enclosed in the mitochondrial matrix. Consistently, PDE2A was not protected from proteinase K digestion anymore when the mitoplast membrane (inner mitochondrial membrane) was solubilized through the addition of Triton (Fig. 2C). Thus, PDE2A is co-localized with the cAMP source sAC in the mitochondrial matrix. Mitochondrial transport systems can import proteins that contain different types of localization signals, but most matrix proteins contain an N-terminal sorting signal, which is often proteolytically removed during import (43Chacinska A.

Three PDE2A isoforms have been described, PDE2A1, PDE2A2, and PDE2A3, which are encoded by a single mammalian PDE2A gene and differ in their N-terminal sequences due to alternative splicing (22Rosman G.J.

https://openalex.org/W2155291157,"There is a considerable heterogeneity in blood cell telomere length (TL) for individuals of similar age and recent studies have revealed that TL changes by time are dependent on TL at baseline. TL is partly inherited, but results from several studies indicate that e.g. life style and/or environmental factors can affect TL during life. Collectively, these studies imply that blood cell TL might fluctuate during a life time and that the actual TL at a defined time point is the result of potential regulatory mechanism(s) and environmental factors. We analyzed relative TL (RTL) in subsequent blood samples taken six months apart from 50 individuals and found significant associations between RTL changes and RTL at baseline. Individual RTL changes per month were more pronounced than the changes recorded in a previously studied population analyzed after 10 years’ follow up. The data argues for an oscillating TL pattern which levels out at longer follow up times. In a separate group of five blood donors, a marked telomere loss was demonstrated within a six month period for one donor where after TL was stabilized. PCR determined RTL changes were verified by Southern blotting and STELA (single telomere elongation length analysis). The STELA demonstrated that for the donor with a marked telomere loss, the heterogeneity of the telomere distribution decreased considerably, with a noteworthy loss of the largest telomeres. In summary, the collected data support the concept that individual blood cell telomere length is a dynamic feature and this will be important to recognize in future studies of human telomere biology."
https://openalex.org/W2018810660,"Most thermophilic proteins tend to have more salt bridges, and achieve higher thermostability by up-shifting and broadening their protein stability curves. While the stabilizing effect of salt-bridge has been extensively studied, experimental data on how salt-bridge influences protein stability curves are scarce. Here, we used double mutant cycles to determine the temperature-dependency of the pair-wise interaction energy and the contribution of salt-bridges to ΔCp in a thermophilic ribosomal protein L30e. Our results showed that the pair-wise interaction energies for the salt-bridges E6/R92 and E62/K46 were stabilizing and insensitive to temperature changes from 298 to 348 K. On the other hand, the pair-wise interaction energies between the control long-range ion-pair of E90/R92 were negligible. The ΔCp of all single and double mutants were determined by Gibbs-Helmholtz and Kirchhoff analyses. We showed that the two stabilizing salt-bridges contributed to a reduction of ΔCp by 0.8–1.0 kJ mol−1 K−1. Taken together, our results suggest that the extra salt-bridges found in thermophilic proteins enhance the thermostability of proteins by reducing ΔCp, leading to the up-shifting and broadening of the protein stability curves."
https://openalex.org/W2110552191,"One of the most celebrated phenomena in many-body physics is the Kondo effect, which describes the interaction between a single confined spin and the spins of an electron reservoir. In the past decade, the effect has been extensively studied in quantum dots, where a single electron spin in the quantum dot interacts with the sea of electrons in the contacts. So far, only electronic transport measurements have been done on these systems, but Latta et al. add a new dimension by carrying out optical measurements. They show that, remarkably, absorption of a single photon leads to an abrupt change in the interactions of the single spin with the electron reservoir; a quantum quench of Kondo correlations. The study initiates a new direction where quantum optics techniques are used to study many-body phenomena. The interaction between a single confined spin and the spins of an electron reservoir leads to one of the most remarkable phenomena of many-body physics—the Kondo effect1,2. Electronic transport measurements on single artificial atoms, or quantum dots, have made it possible to study the effect in great detail3,4,5. Here we report optical measurements on a single semiconductor quantum dot tunnel-coupled to a degenerate electron gas which show that absorption of a single photon leads to an abrupt change in the system Hamiltonian and a quantum quench of Kondo correlations. By inferring the characteristic power-law exponents from the experimental absorption line shapes, we find a unique signature of the quench in the form of an Anderson orthogonality catastrophe6,7, induced by a vanishing overlap between the initial and final many-body wavefunctions. We show that the power-law exponent that determines the degree of orthogonality can be tuned using an external magnetic field8, which unequivocally demonstrates that the observed absorption line shape originates from Kondo correlations. Our experiments demonstrate that optical measurements on single artificial atoms offer new perspectives on many-body phenomena previously studied using transport spectroscopy only."

As the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant strains increases, targeting virulence determinants of pathogenic bacteria has become an attractive alternative to the use of traditional bactericidal antibiotics (1Cegelski L.

Microbiol. 2010; 13: 100-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In addition, small molecule inhibitors can be used as chemical probes to study the role of T3SS in bacterial pathogenesis (12Wolf K. Betts H.J. Chellas-Géry B. Hower S. Linton C.N. Fields K.A. Mol. Microbiol. 2006; 61: 1543-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 21Puri A.W. Bogyo M. ACS Chem. Biol. 2009; 4: 603-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 22Hung D.T. Rubin E.J. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2006; 10: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To date, the mechanism of inhibition for the salicylidene acylhydrazides has been unclear with several mechanisms being postulated, including direct effects on the T3SS machinery or on regulatory proteins that affect T3SS expression (15Nordfelth R. Kauppi A.M. Norberg H.A. Wolf-Watz H. Elofsson M. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 3104-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 16Veenendaal A.K. Sundin C. Blocker A.J. J.

Immun. 2009; 77: 4209-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The activity of salicylidene acylhydrazides on Chlamydia trachomatis can be reversed by the addition of iron, suggesting a possible link to iron availability in the cell (11Slepenkin A. Enquist P.A. Hägglund U. de la Maza L.M. Elofsson M. Peterson E.M. Infect. Immun. 2007; 75: 3478-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). type three secretion system analytical ultracentrifugation heteronuclear single quantum coherence E. coli O157 Tpx quantitative structure-activity relationship Y. pseudotuberculosis Tpx minimum Eagle's medium 2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol single-nucleotide polymorphism. Although target-based screening can identify compounds that perturb the function of the selected protein, the activity is often lost when the compounds are tested on bacterial cells due to a lack of bacterial cell permeability (23Payne D.J. Gwynn M.N. Holmes D.J. Pompliano D.L. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (1966) Google Scholar). Phenotypic screens circumvent this challenge and directly provide compounds that are active on the cellular level. The salicylidene acylhydrazides were identified using this strategy, and this is likely the underlying reason for the broad activity spectrum observed for these T3SS inhibitors. The drawback is, however, that the mode of action at the molecular level has to be studied at a later stage. Identification of the cellular targets for the salicylidene acylhydrazides constitutes a crucial step in understanding their true mode of action. Moreover, such data are essential for the structure-led design and improvement of any potential therapeutic compound. Affinity chromatography, expression-cloning technologies, and microarrays are among the many strategies that can be employed for target deconvolution (24Terstappen G.C. Schlüpen C. Raggiaschi R. Gaviraghi G. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2007; 6: 891-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). To help understand the molecular mechanism by which salicylidene acylhydrazides affect the T3SS, we aimed to identify the target proteins bound by this class of novel antibacterial compounds using an affinity reagent strategy (25Leslie B.J. Hergenrother P.J. Chem. Soc. Rev. 2008; 37: 1347-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In this study we describe synthesis of a T3SS inhibitor affinity reagent and the isolation of putative target proteins from E. coli O157. By a series of in vitro experiments, we show that the compounds directly and selectively interact with the target proteins WrbA, Tpx, and FolX. The genes encoding the target proteins were deleted individually in both E. coli O157 and Y. pseudotuberculosis, and we show that the proteins are involved in regulation of T3SS gene expression. Our work provides the first identification of the cellular targets for this group of compounds and convincing evidence that their mode of action is likely to result from a synergistic effect arising from a perturbation of the function of several conserved proteins. Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in supplemental Table S1. Mutations in tpx were made using QuikChange II (Stratagene) and were confirmed by sequencing. Oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) are listed in supplemental Table S2. E. coli O157 strains were cultured in LB, DMEM, or MEM-HEPES media (Sigma) supplemented with standard concentrations of antibiotics (26Sambrook S. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar). The stepwise synthesis of ME0055-Aff is described in supplemental Protocol S1. E. coli O157 strain TUV93–0 was cultured in MEM-HEPES media at 37 °C to an A600 = 0.8. Cells were harvested and lysed using a French pressure cell. No subsequent separation steps were used to ensure that cell wall, cell membrane, and cytosolic proteins were represented in the lysate. The bacterial lysate was mixed with PBS-balanced ME0055-Aff beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were separated by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. An aliquot of the supernatant was saved for analysis, and the rest of the supernatant was discarded. The beads were washed 10 times using 10 volumes of PBS and separation by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. The beads were mixed gently in the same volume of 20 μm ME0055 and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 500 × g for 5 min. The elution and centrifugation step was repeated with 200 μm ME0055 and 1% acetic acid, respectively. Equal volumes of washes and eluates were loaded onto the protein gels. Samples were visualized using Colloidal Blue Stain (Invitrogen), and bands were excised for subsequent in-gel digestion and analysis (27Shevchenko A. Tomas H. Havlis J. Olsen J.V. Mann M. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2856-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (3531) Google Scholar). Proteins analyzed by peptide mass fingerprinting were given a MOWSE score (28Pappin D.J. Hojrup P. Bleasby A.J. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 327-332Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar) to indicate the probability of the identification being correct. We set a threshold MOWSE value of 100 or greater, ensuring a significance of p < 10−8. Eighteen bacterial strains (supplemental Table S1) were cultured overnight in LB and diluted to an A600 ≤ 0.05 in prewarmed MEM-HEPES medium. Cultures were grown at 37 °C to an A600 = 0.8, and then secreted proteins were extracted by TCA precipitation as described previously (29Roe A.J. Hoey D.E. Gally D.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 98-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and Western blotting for Tir and EspD was carried out as described previously (29Roe A.J. Hoey D.E. Gally D.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 98-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Strain 430 displayed no reduction in secretion upon the addition of 20 μm ME0052, ME0053, ME0054, or ME0055 to the culture when assessed by Western blotting for Tir or EspD. Genomic DNA for the ZAP 430 strain was extracted using a QIAamp DNA extraction kit. The sequencing was performed in the Sir Henry Wellcome Functional Genomics Facility, University of Glasgow, using the Illumina Genome Analyzer II platform. The purified genomic DNA was randomly fragmented with a Bioruptor Sonicator (Diagenode Inc., NJ) followed by the ligation of adapters, and genomic library generation was performed according to the standard Illumina protocol. The genomic library at a concentration of 3 pm was then loaded onto a single lane of the Illumina flow cell, and the DNA clusters were generated using the Illumina Single Read Cluster Generation kit Version 4 (Illumina Inc.). Subsequently, 70 cycles of single end sequencing were performed. The raw data containing read sequences and associated qualities were generated with Genome Analyzer Pipeline v.1.5 (Illumina Inc.). Of 15,712,834 70-bp-long reads generated, 14,347,057 were successfully mapped to the E. coli O157:H7 strain EC4115 complete genome (GenBank™ accession NC_011353) using Maq software with the default parameter set, which resulted in 179× genome coverage. Subsequently, the SNPs were identified with Maq and filtered with the command “maq.pl SNPfilter -q 40 -w 5 -N 2 -d 3 -D 256 -n 20 -Q 40,” where parameters were chosen as suggested for the bacterial genomes (30Li H. Ruan J. Durbin R. Genome Res. 2008; 18: 1851-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). The latter identified 1348 SNPs (supplemental Table S3). The stepwise synthesis of ME0052-Bio and ME0055-Bio are described in supplemental Protocol S1. Target proteins were overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (λDE3). Bacterial pellets were lysed using 8 m urea, and the supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 1 min. The Far Western analysis was performed as described previously (31Wu Y. Li Q. Chen X.Z. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 3278-3284Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) using Novex NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris SDS-PAGE gels (Invitrogen), 20 μm ME0052-Bio as the probe, and HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Invitrogen) for the detection of biotin. Protein loading was checked by using an anti-His antibody that showed equivalent levels of overexpressed target protein in each lane (data not shown). Transcriptional profiling of E. coli O157 strains was carried out essentially as described previously (32Roe A.J. Tysall L. Dransfield T. Wang D. Fraser-Pitt D. Mahajan A. Constandinou C. Inglis N. Downing A. Talbot R. Smith D.G. Gally D.L. Microbiology. 2007; 153: 1350-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Overnight cultures of E. coli TUV-930 or defined mutants were grown in MEM-HEPES (Sigma) supplemented with 250 nm Fe(NO3)2 and glucose to a final concentration of 0.2% and then diluted to an A600 = 0.1 in the same media. At an A600 = 0.8, 15-ml cultures were stabilized in an equal volume of RNAprotect (Qiagen), and RNA was extracted using a Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit. DNA contamination was removed by DNase I treatment (Ambion). Total RNA was assessed for quality and quantified using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. Synthesis of cDNA and labeling of total RNA was performed using an Amersham Biosciences CyScribe post-labeling kit as per the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was hybridized to 70-mer-spotted oligonucleotide arrays containing ORFs from E. coli K-12, E. coli Sakai VT2, and E. coli EDL933 (University of Birmingham) using a Genomic Solutions GeneTac hybridization machine. Hybridized slides were scanned using a Genepix 4000A scanner and GenePix 7.0 software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA). Data were analyzed using Genespring GX 7.3.1 (Agilent). Triplicate wild-type and mutant cultures were grown up in MEM-HEPES. RNA extractions were carried out using a Qiagen RNeasy Mini kit, and cDNA synthesis was carried out using a Qiagen QuantiTect™ Reverse Transcription kit. Duplicate quantitative PCRs were carried out using a Qiagen Quantifast™ SYBR® Green PCR kit and Stratagene MX3000, and oligonucleotide primers are listed in supplemental Table S2. All the experiments were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Flagella and EspA filaments were visualized using immunofluorescence microscopy (17Tree J.J. Wang D. McInally C. Mahajan A. Layton A. Houghton I. Elofsson M. Stevens M.P. Gally D.L. Roe A.J. Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 4209-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Images were processed and quantified using Volocity suite software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Bacterial motility was assayed using soft agar plates as described previously (33Lane M.C. Lockatell V. Monterosso G. Lamphier D. Weinert J. Hebel J.R. Johnson D.E. Mobley H.L. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 7644-7656Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). ypTpx and ypTpxC61S were cloned, expressed, and purified as described previously (34Gabrielsen M. Zetterström C.E. Wang D. Beckham K.S. Elofsson M. Isaacs N.W. Roe A.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. F Struct. Biol. Cryst. Commun. 2010; 66: 1606-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). For NMR spectroscopy, ypTpx was expressed in M9 minimal media, with the nitrogen source substituted with 15NH4Cl. Experiments to identify chemically-shifted residues were performed using triple-labeled Tpx (13C,2H,15N), produced by culture in algal hydrolysate-based media (Cambridge Isotopes Ltd). For chemical shift perturbation studies, ypTpx NMR samples were prepared to contain 100 μm protein in 13 mm KPi, pH 7.4, 33 mm NaCl, and 5% D2O, and 15N FAST-HSQC (35Mori S. Abeygunawardana C. Johnson M.O. van Zijl P.C. J. Magn. Reson. B. 1995; 108: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar) spectra were recorded at 298 K and 14.1 T using a Bruker AVANCE 600 spectrometer equipped with a 5-mm TCI cryoprobe. Compound was added from a concentrated stock solution in deuterated DMSO (dDMSO), and reference spectra recorded with an equal concentration (0.33% v/v) of dDMSO added. Backbone resonance assignment was achieved using triple resonance, and TROSY (transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy) triple resonance experiments were recorded from 150 to 500 μm samples at 308 K. Data were processed using AZARA and analyzed using CCPNMR analysis (36Vranken W.F. Boucher W. Stevens T.J. Fogh R.H. Pajon A. Llinas M. Ulrich E.L. Markley J.L. Ionides J. Laue E.D. Proteins. 2005; 59: 687-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (2306) Google Scholar). Before AUC analysis, ypTpx and ypTpx C61S were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed using an Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Palo Alto, CA) and an An-50 Ti rotor. Data were collected at 49,000 rpm at 4 °C for ypTpx under oxidizing (with 10 mm H2O2) and reducing (with 5 mm DTT) conditions and for the C61S mutant. 360 μl of sample (100 μm protein solution with ME0052 at concentrations ranging from 0 to 250 μm) and reference solvent (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 1% v/v DMSO) were loaded into 3-mm path length charcoal-filled epon double-sector centerpieces. Rayleigh interference and absorbance (at 280 and 395 nm) data were collected every 15 min for 25 h (1 replicate of absorbance data in continuous mode with a radial step size of 0.005 cm). A wavelength of 395 nm was used to monitor the sedimentation of ME0052 only, as the protein does not contribute to the signal at this wavelength. A two-stage analysis of sedimentation velocity data was used to determine the amount of ME0052 bound to oxidized and reduced ypTpx and the C61S mutant. First, the number of species in the system was evaluated using continuous distribution (c(s)) analysis, performed with SEDFIT software (37Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3045) Google Scholar). The sedimentation coefficients (s20,0w) of oxidized and reduced ypTpx and the C61S mutant are 3.04, 2.62, and 2.80 s, respectively (data not shown); thus, a peak with this sedimentation coefficient in the c(s) distribution derived from sedimentation velocity data acquired at 395 nm could be attributed to ypTpx bound to ME0052. At ME0052 = 0 μm no peaks were resolved from the data; at higher concentrations two peaks were evident: one at very low s (corresponding to unbound ME0052) and the second close to 2.7 s (ME0052 bound to protein). The concentration of free and bound compound was determined by fitting the data with a (two species) non-interacting discrete species model in SEDFIT. An extinction coefficient of 11,100 m−1 cm2, determined from the linear dependence of absorbance at 395 nm with ME0052 concentration, was used to calculate the concentration of compound returned by the non-interacting discrete species model. The resultant reduced data were then fitted with a single-site-binding nonlinear regression model using the formula Y = Bmax × X/(Kd + X), where Y is the concentration of ME0052 bound to protein (determined by non-interacting discrete species), X is the total concentration of ME0052 (i.e. bound and unbound), Bmax is the concentration of compound required to saturate the protein (i.e. at maximal binding), and Kd is the equilibrium dissociation constant or concentration of compound required to reach half-maximal binding. The stoichiometry of interaction between ME0052 and ypTpx was determined by dividing Bmax by the total protein concentration. The two salicylidene acylhydrazides ME0052 and ME0055 were selected for chemical derivatization. ME0052 has been extensively studied and proved to display low toxicity against mammalian cells and activity against T3S in Y. pseudotuberculosis, C. trachomatis, Salmonella enterica, Shigella flexneri, and E. coli O157:H7 (10Bailey L.

The Affi-Gel- and biotin-labeled salicylidene acylhydrazide derivatives ME0055-Aff and ME0052-Bio (Fig. 1A) were synthesized by combined solid phase and solution phase chemistry. The position for attachment of the linker was based on previous structure-activity data (15Nordfelth R. Kauppi A.M. Norberg H.A. Wolf-Watz H. Elofsson M. Infect. Immun. 2005; 73: 3104-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 38Dahlgren M.K. Oberg C.T. Wallin E.A. Janson P.G. Elofsson M.

Chem. 2010; 18: 2686-2703Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). ME0055-Aff was used in affinity chromatography experiments to enrich for inhibitor binding proteins from E. coli O157 lysates prepared using a French pressure cell. After incubation, washing, and elution using stepwise increasing concentrations of unlabeled compound, proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and visualized with Colloidal Blue Stain (Fig. 1B). Bands were selected corresponding to the lanes derived from the fractions that had been eluted using unlabeled compound but that were less abundant in the lane associated with the acetic acid “stripping” of the beads. These were postulated to be true target proteins and not simply bound to the Affi-Gel bead itself. Bands from the gel were excised to permit in-gel trypsin digestion and analysis by liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (27Shevchenko A. Tomas H. Havlis J. Olsen J.V. Mann M. Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2856-2860Crossref PubMed Scopus (3531) Google Scholar). Using this approach, we identified 16 proteins (supplemental Table S4) that were bound by ME0055-Aff. As an independent screen, a panel of 18 clinical E. coli O157 isolates selected to represent a diverse range of phage types were tested for sensitivity against four salicylidene acylhydrazides (ME0052, ME0053, ME0054, and ME0055) that previously proved effective against E. coli O157 (17Tree J.J. Wang D. McInally C. Mahajan A. Layton A. Houghton I. Elofsson M. Stevens M.P. Gally D.L. Roe A.J. Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 4209-4220Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis of Tir secretion in the presence of 20 μm concentrations of each of the compounds revealed a strain, ZAP 430, that showed no inhibition of Tir secretion upon the addition of any of the four compounds. Illumina re-sequencing of the genome (EMBL, ERP000335) and comparison against EC4115, a strain sensitive to the salicylidene acylhydrazides, demonstrated that ZAP 430 carried numerous mutations (supplemental Table S3). These mutations include the gene encoding WrbA, one of the target proteins identified from the affinity chromatography approach. Previous work has suggested that the salicylidene acylhydrazides may function by directly binding and perturbing the proteins associated with the T3SS basal apparatus (16Veenendaal A.K. Sundin C. Blocker A.J. J. Bacteriol. 2009; 191: 563-570Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). ZAP 430 had no mutations in the genes encoding the structural proteins of the T3SS; this insensitive strain contained T3SS proteins identical to both EDL933 and EC4115, reflecting the high level of conservation of these proteins. To facilitate studies of the putative binding proteins, we attempted to clone the corresponding genes. From the 16 amplified products, 12 genes were successfully cloned into a pET151 vector and verified by sequencing. Each of the 12 plasmids was tested for protein overexpression, with seven clones producing a protein of the expected size. These seven proteins were (or were encoded by): Tpx, FolX, z2714, z3974, WrbA, SurA, and StcE. Interactions with salicylidene acylhydrazides were tested in Far Western experiments using 20 μm concentrations of the biotin-labeled compound ME0052-Bio as a probe (Fig. 2A). From the seven overexpressed proteins, three gave clear signals after Far Western analysis: Tpx, a thiol peroxidase (40Baker L.M. Poole L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9203-9211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), WrbA a NAD(P)H quinine oxidoreductase (41Patridge E.V. Ferry J.G. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 3498-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), and FolX, a dihydroneopterin-tri-P-epimerase (42Ploom T. Haussmann C. Hof P. Steinbacher S. Bacher A. Richardson J. Huber R. Structure. 1999; 7: 509-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). No signal or a very weak signal was seen corresponding to the other four proteins or for E. coli lysates with no overexpressed target protein (Fig. 2A). We, therefore, decided to focus on Tpx, WrbA, and FolX for further studies. Previous work has demonstrated that salicylidene acylhydrazide compounds inhibit expression and function of the T3SS in numerous pathogens (19Keyser P. Elofsson M. Rosell S. Wolf-Watz H. J. Intern. Med. 2008; 264: 17-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). We aimed to test if WrbA, Tpx, and FolX were conserved targets resulting in a common mechanism of inhibition. Cloning and overexpression of the genes encoding WrbA and Tpx were carried out from five different pathogens: E. coli O157, S. typhimurium, S. flexneri, P. aeruginosa, and Y. pseudotuberculosis. The gene encoding FolX, which is less conserved, was cloned from three pathogens: E. coli O157, P. aeruginosa, and S. flexneri. FolX is not present in Y. pseudotuberculosis, but this species does carry a s"
https://openalex.org/W2008140201,"The light field emitted by a single atom can exhibit non-classical effects such as 'squeezing', which is characterized by sub-shot noise amplitude or phase fluctuations. This phenomenon was predicted 30 years ago, but has been observed experimentally only for macroscopic and mesoscopic media down to a few tens of atoms. Ourjoumtsev et al. now report the observation of squeezed light generated from a single atom excited by laser light in a high-finesse optical resonator. In contrast to the emission of single photons, a more easily observed event, the squeezed light derives from the quantum coherence of photon pairs emitted from the system. This may offer new perspectives for photonic quantum logic with single emitters. Single quantum emitters such as atoms are well known as non-classical light sources with reduced noise in the intensity, capable of producing photons one by one at given times1. However, the light field emitted by a single atom can exhibit much richer dynamics. A prominent example2,3 is the predicted ability of a single atom to produce quadrature-squeezed light4, which has fluctuations of amplitude or phase that are below the shot-noise level. However, such squeezing is much more difficult to observe than the emission of single photons5. Squeezed beams have been generated using macroscopic and mesoscopic media down to a few tens of atoms6, but despite experimental efforts7,8,9, single-atom squeezing has so far escaped observation. Here we generate squeezed light with a single atom in a high-finesse optical resonator. The strong coupling of the atom to the cavity field induces a genuine quantum mechanical nonlinearity10, which is several orders of magnitude larger than in typical macroscopic media11,12,13. This produces observable quadrature squeezing14,15,16, with an excitation beam containing on average only two photons per system lifetime. In sharp contrast to the emission of single photons17, the squeezed light stems from the quantum coherence of photon pairs emitted from the system18. The ability of a single atom to induce strong coherent interactions between propagating photons opens up new perspectives for photonic quantum logic with single emitters19,20,21,22,23,24."

Given the established central role of CD4 T cells in BCG induced immunity, we sought to characterise the generation of memory CD4 T cell responses to BCG vaccination and M. bovis infection in a murine challenge model. We demonstrate that a single systemic BCG vaccination induces distinct systemic and mucosal populations of T effector memory (T(EM)) cells in vaccinated mice. These CD4+CD44(hi)CD62L(lo)CD27⁻ T cells concomitantly produce IFN-γ and TNF-α, or IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF-α and have a higher cytokine median fluorescence intensity MFI or 'quality of response' than single cytokine producing cells. These cells are maintained for long periods (>16 months) in BCG protected mice, maintaining a vaccine-specific functionality. Following virulent mycobacterial challenge, these cells underwent significant expansion in the lungs and are, therefore, strongly associated with protection against M. bovis challenge. Our data demonstrate that a persistent mucosal population of T(EM) cells can be induced by parenteral immunization, a feature only previously associated with mucosal immunization routes; and that these multifunctional T(EM) cells are strongly associated with protection. We propose that these cells mediate protective immunity, and that vaccines designed to increase the number of relevant antigen-specific T(EM) in the lung may represent a new generation of TB vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W1991132677,"Background In everyday life, signals of danger, such as aversive facial expressions, usually appear in the peripheral visual field. Although facial expression processing in central vision has been extensively studied, this processing in peripheral vision has been poorly studied. Methodology/Principal Findings Using behavioral measures, we explored the human ability to detect fear and disgust vs. neutral expressions and compared it to the ability to discriminate between genders at eccentricities up to 40°. Responses were faster for the detection of emotion compared to gender. Emotion was detected from fearful faces up to 40° of eccentricity. Conclusions Our results demonstrate the human ability to detect facial expressions presented in the far periphery up to 40° of eccentricity. The increasing advantage of emotion compared to gender processing with increasing eccentricity might reflect a major implication of the magnocellular visual pathway in facial expression processing. This advantage may suggest that emotion detection, relative to gender identification, is less impacted by visual acuity and within-face crowding in the periphery. These results are consistent with specific and automatic processing of danger-related information, which may drive attention to those messages and allow for a fast behavioral reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2001894182,"Errors in chromosome segregation or distribution may result in aneuploid embryo formation, which causes implantation failure, spontaneous abortion, genetic diseases, or embryo death. Embryonic aneuploidy occurs when chromosome aberrations are present in gametes or early embryos. To date, it is still unclear whether the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) is required for the regulation of mitotic cell cycle progression to ensure mitotic fidelity during preimplantation development. In this study, using overexpression and RNA interference (RNAi) approaches, we analyzed the role of SAC components (Bub3, BubR1 and Mad2) in mouse preimplantation embryos. Our data showed that overexpressed SAC components inhibited metaphase-anaphase transition by preventing sister chromatid segregation. Deletion of SAC components by RNAi accelerated the metaphase-anaphase transition during the first cleavage and caused micronuclei formation, chromosome misalignment and aneuploidy, which caused decreased implantation and delayed development. Furthermore, in the presence of the spindle-depolymerizing drug nocodazole, SAC depleted embryos failed to arrest at metaphase. Our results suggest that SAC is essential for the regulation of mitotic cell cycle progression in cleavage stage mouse embryos."
https://openalex.org/W2016375009,"Binding of calcium ions (Ca²⁺) to proteins can have profound effects on their structure and function. Common roles of calcium binding include structure stabilization and regulation of activity. It is known that diverse families--EF-hands being one of at least twelve--use a Dx[DN]xDG linear motif to bind calcium in near-identical fashion. Here, four novel structural contexts for the motif are described. Existing experimental data for one of them, a thermophilic archaeal subtilisin, demonstrate for the first time a role for Dx[DN]xDG-bound calcium in protein folding. An integrin-like embedding of the motif in the blade of a β-propeller fold--here named the calcium blade--is discovered in structures of bacterial and fungal proteins. Furthermore, sensitive database searches suggest a common origin for the calcium blade in β-propeller structures of different sizes and a pan-kingdom distribution of these proteins. Factors favouring the multiple convergent evolution of the motif appear to include its general Asp-richness, the regular spacing of the Asp residues and the fact that change of Asp into Gly and vice versa can occur though a single nucleotide change. Among the known structural contexts for the Dx[DN]xDG motif, only the calcium blade and the EF-hand are currently found intracellularly in large numbers, perhaps because the higher extracellular concentration of Ca²⁺ allows for easier fixing of newly evolved motifs that have acquired useful functions. The analysis presented here will inform ongoing efforts toward prediction of similar calcium-binding motifs from sequence information alone."
https://openalex.org/W1995947650,"Delta-like 1 (Dlk1, also known as fetal antigen-1, FA1) is a member of Notch/Delta family that inhibits adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation; however, its role in chondrogenesis is still not clear. Thus, we overexpressed Dlk1/FA1 in mouse embryonic ATDC5 cells and tested its effects on chondrogenic differentiation. Dlk1/FA1 inhibited insulin-induced chondrogenic differentiation as evidenced by reduction of cartilage nodule formation and gene expression of aggrecan, collagen Type II and X. Similar effects were obtained either by using Dlk1/FA1-conditioned medium or by addition of a purified, secreted, form of Dlk1 (FA1) directly to the induction medium. The inhibitory effects of Dlk1/FA1 were dose-dependent and occurred irrespective of the chondrogenic differentiation stage: proliferation, differentiation, maturation, or hypertrophic conversion. Overexpression or addition of the Dlk1/FA1 protein to the medium strongly inhibited the activation of Akt, but not the ERK1/2, or p38 MAPK pathways, and the inhibition of Akt by Dlk1/FA1 was mediated through PI3K activation. Interestingly, inhibition of fibronectin expression by siRNA rescued the Dlk1/FA1-mediated inhibition of Akt, suggesting interaction of Dlk1/FA1 and fibronectin in chondrogenic cells. Our results identify Dlk1/FA1 as a novel regulator of chondrogenesis and suggest Dlk1/FA1 acts as an inhibitor of the PI3K/Akt pathways that leads to its inhibitory effects on chondrogenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2087064822,"STIM1 and Orai represent the key components of Ca(2+) release-activated Ca(2+) channels. Activation of Orai channels requires coupling of the C terminus of STIM1 to the N and C termini of Orai. Although the latter appears to be central in the interaction with STIM1, the role of the N terminus and particularly of the conserved region close to the first transmembrane sequence is less well understood. Here, we investigated in detail the functional role of this conserved region in Orai3 by stepwise deletions. Molecular determinants were mapped for the two modes of Orai3 activation via STIM1 or 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB) and for current gating characteristics. Increasing N-terminal truncations revealed a progressive decrease of the specific fast inactivation of Orai3 concomitant with diminished binding to calmodulin. STIM1-dependent activation of Orai3 was maintained as long as the second half of this conserved N-terminal domain was present. Further truncations abolished it, whereas Orai3 stimulation via 2-APB was partially retained. In aggregate, the N-terminal conserved region plays a multifaceted role in Orai3 current gating with distinct structural requirements for STIM1- and 2-APB-stimulated activation."

Methods Analysis of data from a prospective cross-sectional population based study. From 2004-7, we randomly recruited 2000 community participants to the Cameron County Hispanic Cohort collecting extensive socioeconomic, clinical and laboratory data. We excluded 153 subjects due to critical missing data. Pearson chi-square tests and Student's t-tests were used for categorical and continuous variable analysis, respectively. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the risk factors for elevated ALT. Results The mean age of the cohort was 45 years and 67% were females. The majority of the cohort was either overweight (32.4%) or obese (50.7%). Almost half (43.7%) had MS and nearly one-third diabetes. Elevated ALT level was more prevalent in males than females. Obesity was a strong risk for abnormal ALT in both genders. Hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia and young age were risks for elevated ALT in males only, whereas increased fasting plasma glucose was associated with elevated ALT in females only. Conclusion We identified high prevalence of MS and markers of liver injury in this large Mexican American cohort with gender differences in prevalence and risk factors, with younger males at greatest risk."

Moving from the N to the C terminus, these include a calponin homology domain, a polyproline binding domain, four IQ (calmodulin binding) motifs, and a RasGAP-related region. IQGAP1 binds multiple proteins thereby integrating diverse signaling pathways. Proteins that are known to bind IQGAP1 include Rac1/Cdc42 (but not RhoA or H-Ras), actin, calmodulin, E-cadherin, β-catenin, components of the MAPK pathway, adenomatous polyposis coli, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) (30Brown M.D. Sacks D.B.

The relevance to tumor biology of many of the known IQGAP1 binding partners coupled with the existing evidence for its role in neoplasia discussed above strongly suggests that IQGAP1 is an oncogene. Consistent with this hypothesis, overexpression of IQGAP1 stimulates tumorigenesis of human breast epithelial cells (44Jadeski L. Mataraza J.M. Jeong H.W. Li Z. Sacks D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1008-1017Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We report here that IQGAP1 regulates HER2 expression, phosphorylation, and signaling. Furthermore, we show that IQGAP1 is overexpressed in trastuzumab-resistant human breast epithelial cells and that specific knockdown of IQGAP1 both enhances the inhibitory effects of trastuzumab in vitro and abrogates trastuzumab resistance. SkBR3 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). All tissue culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen.

GST-Cdc42V12 was generously provided by Ann Ridley (Kings College London). siRNA oligomers (with dTdT overhangs at each 3′ terminus) against IQGAP1 were obtained from Sigma (designated siIQ12) and Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO; designated siIQ14). The siRNA oligomer (with dTdT overhangs at each 3′ terminus) against p27 (designated sip27) was obtained from Sigma, and that against renilla luciferase (designated siRen) was synthesized by Invitrogen. The siRNA sequences are as follows: siIQ12, 5′-GGCAAUUUAAAUGACCCAA-3′ (sense (S)), 5′-UUGGGUCAUUUAAAUUGCC-3′ (antisense (AS)); siIQ14, 5′-GGCAUAUCAAGAUCGGUUA-3′ (S), 5′-UAACCGAUCUUGAUAUGCC-3′ (AS); sip27, 5′-GAAUGGACAUCCUGUAUAA-3′ (S), 5′-UUAUACAGGAUGUCCAUUC-3′ (AS); siRen, 5′-AAACAUGCAGAAAAUGCUG-3′ (S), 5′-CAGCAUUUUCUGCAUGUUU-3′ (AS). siIQ12-resistant IQGAP1 was made by introducing 3 silent mutations (A4511G, T4514C and C4517T) into wild-type IQGAP1 using the QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Unless otherwise stated, all other reagents were of standard analytical grade. A total of 42 routinely processed formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded surgical resection specimens (male/female patient ratio, 0/39; median patient age, 58 years) were selected from the tissue archives of the Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, between the years 1998 and 2002. These included 19 HER2(+) (3+ by immunohistochemistry and/or amplified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)) invasive breast carcinomas, 20 HER2(−) invasive breast carcinomas (18 hormone receptor-positive and 2 triple-negative tumors), and 3 normal breast specimens (supplemental Table S1). Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were reviewed by a board-certified pathologist (D. A. Dillon, Brigham and Women's Hospital) for confirmation of the diagnoses. Patient age and hormone receptor status were extracted from the corresponding surgical pathology reports (supplemental Table S1). This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Brigham and Women's Hospital. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks were cut into 5-μm-thick tissue sections, and slides were prepared using standard techniques. Mounted tissue sections were baked for 20 min at 60 °C, deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated through graded alcohols. Antigens were retrieved by heating in 1 μm sodium citrate (pH 6.0) in a pressure cooker for 30 s at 125 °C. Nonspecific staining was blocked using Dako Protein Block (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Rabbit polyclonal anti-IQGAP1 (dilution 1:2,000) and rabbit polyclonal anti-HER2 (dilution 1:100) antibodies were diluted in Dako antibody diluent and incubated with tissue sections for 1 h at room temperature. Staining was visualized using Dako Envision and developed with a DAB Chromogen substrate. Immediately after visualization, sections were dipped in DAB Enhancer, counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated through graded alcohols and xylene, and mounted. Appropriate positive and negative controls were used throughout all staining and interpretation. Immunohistochemical staining was evaluated by a board-certified pathologist (D. A. Dillon). IQGAP1 immunostaining was scored as follows: 0 (no immunoreactivity), 1+ (weak immunoreactivity), 2+ (moderate immunoreactivity in greater than 10% of tumor cells), or 3+ (strong immunoreactivity in greater than 30% of tumor cells). A score of 0 or 1+ was considered negative, whereas 2+ or 3+ was considered positive.

SkBR3 cells, a malignant human breast epithelial cell line that overexpresses HER2, were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 1% (v/v) penicillin/streptomycin. All cultures were regularly confirmed to be free of mycoplasma contamination.

Briefly, cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well and allowed to attach overnight. The following day each well was transfected with 250 pm siRNA in a complex volume of 2.5 ml (yielding a final siRNA concentration of 100 nm).

In all experiments blots were stripped by incubating with stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% (w/v) SDS, and 0.7% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min at 50 °C then reprobed with antibodies against HER2 (dilution 1:1000), AKT (dilution 1:1000), and ERK (dilution 1:1000). All blots were also probed with anti-IQGAP1 antibodies (dilution 1:1000; to verify IQGAP1 expression) and anti-β-tubulin antibody (dilution 1:2000; to verify protein loading). HER2-stimulated cell growth was measured using sulforhodamine B staining essentially as previously described (51White C.D. Coetsee M. Morgan K. Flanagan C.A. Millar R.P. Lu Z.L. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W1987015491,"Extracellular matrix factors within the tumor microenvironment that control resistance to chemotherapeutics are poorly understood. This study focused on understanding matrix adhesion pathways that control the oral carcinoma response to cisplatin. Our studies revealed that adhesion of HN12 and JHU012 oral carcinomas to carcinoma matrix supported tumor cell proliferation in response to treatment with cisplatin. Proliferation in response to 30 µM cisplatin was not observed in HN12 cells adherent to other purified extracellular matrices such as Matrigel, collagen I, fibronectin or laminin I. Integrin β₁ was important for adhesion to carcinoma matrix to trigger proliferation after treatment with cisplatin. Disruption of talin expression in HN12 cells adherent to carcinoma matrix increased cisplatin induced proliferation. Pharmacological inhibitors were used to determine signaling events required for talin deficiency to regulate cisplatin induced proliferation. Pharmacological inhibition of NF-kB reduced proliferation of talin-deficient HN12 cells treated with 30 µM cisplatin. Nuclear NF-kB activity was assayed in HN12 cells using a luciferase reporter of NF-kB transcriptional activity. Nuclear NF-kB activity was similar in HN12 cells adherent to carcinoma matrix and collagen I when treated with vehicle DMSO. Following treatment with 30 µM cisplatin, NF-kB activity is maintained in cells adherent to carcinoma matrix whereas NF-kB activity is reduced in collagen I adherent cells. Expression of talin was sufficient to trigger proliferation of HN12 cells adherent to collagen I following treatment with 1 and 30 µM cisplatin. Talin overexpression was sufficient to trigger NF-kB activity following treatment with cisplatin in carcinoma matrix adherent HN12 cells in a process disrupted by FAK siRNA. Thus, adhesions within the carcinoma matrix create a matrix environment in which exposure to cisplatin induces proliferation through the function of integrin β₁, talin and FAK pathways that regulate NF-kB nuclear activity."
https://openalex.org/W2012743859,"The Mef2 family of transcription factors regulates muscle differentiation, but the specific gene programs controlled by each member remain unknown. Characterization of Mef2A knock-out mice has revealed severe myofibrillar defects in cardiac muscle indicating a requirement for Mef2A in cytoarchitectural integrity. Through comprehensive expression analysis of Mef2A-deficient hearts, we identified a cohort of dysregulated genes whose products localize to the peripheral Z-disc/costamere region. Many of these genes are essential for costamere integrity and function. Here we demonstrate that these genes are directly regulated by Mef2A, establishing a mechanism by which Mef2A controls the costamere. In an independent model system, acute knockdown of Mef2A in primary neonatal cardiomyocytes resulted in profound malformations of myofibrils and focal adhesions accompanied by adhesion-dependent programmed cell death. These findings indicate a role for Mef2A in cardiomyocyte survival through regulation of costamere integrity. Finally, bioinformatics analysis identified over-represented transcription factor-binding sites in this network of costamere promoters that may provide insight into the mechanism by which costamere genes are regulated by Mef2A. The global control of costamere gene expression adds another dimension by which this essential macromolecular complex may be regulated in health and disease."

Here we show that Egr-1 expression is tightly regulated by nuclear receptor signaling. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α (HNF4α) activated the Egr-1 promoter through three DR1 response elements as identified by trans-activation assays. Deletion of these response elements or knockdown of HNF4α using siRNA largely abrogated Egr-1 promoter activation. HNF4α activity, as well as its enrichment on the Egr-1 promoter, were markedly repressed by small heterodimer partner (SHP) co-expression. Egr-1 mRNA and protein were transiently induced by HNF4α. On the contrary, HNF4α siRNA reduced Egr-1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels, and overexpression of SHP reversed these effects. Conversely, knockdown of SHP by siRNA elevated Egr-1 protein. Interestingly, Egr-1 mRNA exhibited diurnal fluctuation, which was synchronized to the cyclic expression of SHP and HNF4α after cells were released from serum shock. Unexpectedly, the levels of Egr-1 mRNA and protein were highly up-regulated in Hnf4α−/− mice. Both HNF4α and Egr-1 expression were dramatically increased in SHP−/− mice with bile duct ligation and in human cirrhotic livers, which was inversely correlated with diminished SHP expression.

https://openalex.org/W2057447182,"The 3-Deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), one of S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase inhibitors, has shown antitumor activities in a broad range of solid tumors and acute myeloid leukemia. Here, we examined its effects on multiple myeloma (MM) cells and found that, at 500 nM, it potently inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in 2 of 8 MM cell lines. RNA from un-treated and DZNep treated cells was profiled by Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarray and genes with a significant change in gene expression were determined by significance analysis of microarray (SAM) testing. ALOX5 was the most down-regulated gene (5.8-fold) in sensitive cells and was expressed at low level in resistant cells. The results were corroborated by quantitative RT-PCR. Western-blot analysis indicated ALOX5 was highly expressed only in sensitive cell line H929 and greatly decreased upon DZNep treatment. Ectopic expression of ALOX5 reduced sensitivity to DZNep in H929 cells. Furthermore, down-regulation of ALOX5 by RNA interference could also induce apoptosis in H929. Gene expression analysis on MM patient dataset indicated ALOX5 expression was significantly higher in MM patients compared to normal plasma cells. We also found that Bcl-2 was overexpressed in DZNep insensitive cells, and cotreatment with DZNep and ABT-737, a Bcl-2 family inhibitor, synergistically inhibited growth and induced apoptosis of DZNep insensitive MM cells. Taken together, this study shows one of mechanisms of the DZNep efficacy on MM correlates with its ability to down-regulate the ALOX5 levels. In addition, DZNep insensitivity might be associated with overexpression of Bcl-2, and the combination of ABT-737 and DZNep could synergistically induced apoptosis. These results suggest that DZNep may be exploited therapeutically for a subset of MM."
https://openalex.org/W1983057465,"Electroencephagraphy (EEG) of many dementia patients has been characterized by an increase in low frequency field potential oscillations. One of the characteristics of early stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an increase in theta band power (4-7 Hz). However, the mechanism(s) underlying the changes in theta oscillations are still unclear. To address this issue, we investigate the theta band power changes associated with β-Amyloid (Aβ) peptide (one of the main markers of AD) using a computational model, and by mediating the toxicity of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. We use an established biophysical hippocampal CA1-medial septum network model to evaluate four ionic channels in pyramidal neurons, which were demonstrated to be affected by Aβ. They are the L-type Ca²⁺ channel, delayed rectifying K⁺ channel, A-type fast-inactivating K⁺ channel and large-conductance Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ channel. Our simulation results demonstrate that only the Aβ inhibited A-type fast-inactivating K⁺ channel can induce an increase in hippocampo-septal theta band power, while the other channels do not affect theta rhythm. We further deduce that this increased theta band power is due to enhanced synchrony of the pyramidal neurons. Our research may elucidate potential biomarkers and therapeutics for AD. Further investigation will be helpful for better understanding of AD-induced theta rhythm abnormalities and associated cognitive deficits."
https://openalex.org/W1982907736,"Background Despite its first discovery by in silico cloning of novel endothelial cell-specific genes a decade ago, the biological functions of endothelial cell-specific molecule 2 (ECSM2) have only recently begun to be understood. Limited data suggest its involvement in cell migration and apoptosis. However, the underlying signaling mechanisms and novel functions of ECSM2 remain to be explored. Methodology/Principal Findings A rabbit anti-ECSM2 monoclonal antibody (RabMAb) was generated and used to characterize the endogenous ECSM2 protein. Immunoblotting, immunoprecipitation, deglycosylation, immunostaining and confocal microscopy validated that endogenous ECSM2 is a plasma membrane glycoprotein preferentially expressed in vascular endothelial cells (ECs). Expression patterns of heterologously expressed and endogenous ECSM2 identified that ECSM2 was particularly concentrated at cell-cell contacts. Cell aggregation and transwell assays showed that ECSM2 promoted cell-cell adhesion and attenuated basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-driven EC migration. Gain or loss of function assays by overexpression or knockdown of ECSM2 in ECs demonstrated that ECSM2 modulated bFGF-directed EC motility via the FGF receptor (FGFR)-extracellular regulated kinase (ERK)-focal adhesion kinase (FAK) pathway. The counterbalance between FAK tyrosine phosphorylation (activation) and ERK-dependent serine phosphorylation of FAK was critically involved. A model of how ECSM2 signals to impact bFGF/FGFR-driven EC migration was proposed. Conclusions/Significance ECSM2 is likely a novel EC junctional protein. It can promote cell-cell adhesion and inhibit bFGF-mediated cell migration. Mechanistically, ECSM2 attenuates EC motility through the FGFR-ERK-FAK pathway. The findings suggest that ECSM2 could be a key player in coordinating receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-, integrin-, and EC junctional component-mediated signaling and may have important implications in disorders related to endothelial dysfunction and impaired EC junction signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1992858904,"The type II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS6 (also known as matriptase-2) controls iron homeostasis through its negative regulation of expression of hepcidin, a key hormone involved in iron metabolism. Upstream of the hepcidin-regulated signaling pathway, TMPRSS6 cleaves its target substrate hemojuvelin (HJV) at the plasma membrane, but the dynamics of the cell-surface expression of the protease have not been addressed. Here, we report that TMPRSS6 undergoes constitutive internalization in transfected HEK293 cells and in two human hepatic cell lines, HepG2 and primary hepatocytes, both of which express TMPRSS6 endogenously. Cell surface-labeled TMPRSS6 was internalized and was detected in clathrin- and AP-2-positive vesicles via a dynamin-dependent pathway. The endocytosed TMPRSS6 next transited in early endosomes and then to lysosomes. Internalization of TMPRSS6 is dependent on specific residues within its N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, as site-directed mutagenesis of these residues abrogated internalization and maintained the enzyme at the cell surface. Cells coexpressing these mutants and HJV produced significantly decreased levels of hepcidin compared with wild-type TMPRSS6 due to the sustained cleavage of HJV at the cell surface by TMPRSS6 mutants. Our results underscore for the first time the importance of TMPRSS6 trafficking at the plasma membrane in the regulation of hepcidin expression, an event that is essential for iron homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2031066824,"p21<sup>Waf1/Cip1</sup> protein levels respond to DNA damage; p21 is induced after ionizing radiation, but degraded after UV. p21 degradation after UV is necessary for optimal DNA repair, presumably because p21 inhibits nucleotide excision repair by blocking proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Because p21 also inhibits DNA mismatch repair (MMR), we investigated how p21 levels respond to DNA alkylation by <i>N</i>-methyl-<i>N</i>′-nitro-<i>N</i>-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), which triggers the MMR system. We show that MNNG caused rapid degradation of p21, and this involved the ubiquitin ligase Cdt2 and the proteasome. p21 degradation further required MSH2 but not MLH1. p21 mutants that cannot bind PCNA or cannot be ubiquitinated were resistant to MNNG. MNNG induced the formation of PCNA complexes with MSH6 and Cdt2. Finally, when p21 degradation was blocked, MNNG treatment resulted in reduced recruitment of MMR proteins to chromatin. This study describes a novel pathway that removes p21 to allow cells to efficiently activate the MMR system."
https://openalex.org/W2012039176,"Background ADAMTS13 is the physiological von Willebrand factor (VWF)-cleaving protease. The aim of this study was to examine ADAMTS13 expression in kidneys from ADAMTS13 wild-type (Adamts13+/+) and deficient (Adamts13−/−) mice and to investigate the expression pattern and bioactivity in human glomerular endothelial cells. Methodology/Principal Findings Immunohistochemistry was performed on kidney sections from ADAMTS13 wild-type and ADAMTS13-deficient mice. Phenotypic differences were examined by ultramorphology. ADAMTS13 expression in human glomerular endothelial cells and dermal microvascular endothelial cells was investigated by real-time PCR, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence and immunoblotting. VWF cleavage was demonstrated by multimer structure analysis and immunoblotting. ADAMTS13 was demonstrated in glomerular endothelial cells in Adamts13+/+ mice but no staining was visible in tissue from Adamts13−/− mice. Thickening of glomerular capillaries with platelet deposition on the vessel wall was detected in Adamts13−/− mice. ADAMTS13 mRNA and protein were detected in both human endothelial cells and the protease was secreted. ADAMTS13 activity was demonstrated in glomerular endothelial cells as cleavage of VWF. Conclusions/Significance Glomerular endothelial cells express and secrete ADAMTS13. The proteolytic activity could have a protective effect preventing deposition of platelets along capillary lumina under the conditions of high shear stress present in glomerular capillaries."
https://openalex.org/W2045036054,"We describe the creation of a transgenic zebrafish expressing GFP driven by a 7.5 kb promoter region of the tbx16 gene. This promoter segment is sufficient to recapitulate early embryonic expression of endogenous tbx16 in the presomitic mesoderm, the polster and, subsequently, in the hatching gland. Expression of GFP in the transgenic lines later in development diverges to some extent from endogenous tbx16 expression with the serendipitous result that one line expresses GFP specifically in commissural primary ascending (CoPA) interneurons of the developing spinal cord. Using this line we demonstrate that the gene mafba (valentino) is expressed in CoPA interneurons."
https://openalex.org/W2063121913,"Fundamental aspects of interactions of the Dengue virus type 3 full-length polymerase with the single-stranded and double-stranded RNA and DNA have been quantitatively addressed. The polymerase exists as a monomer with an elongated shape in solution. In the absence of magnesium, the total site size of the polymerase-ssRNA complex is 26 ± 2 nucleotides. In the presence of Mg(2+), the site size increases to 29 ± 2 nucleotides, indicating that magnesium affects the enzyme global conformation. The enzyme shows a preference for the homopyrimidine ssRNAs. Positive cooperativity in the binding to homopurine ssRNAs indicates that the type of nucleic acid base dramatically affects the enzyme orientation in the complex. Both the intrinsic affinity and the cooperative interactions are accompanied by a net ion release. The polymerase binds the dsDNA with an affinity comparable with the ssRNAs affinity, indicating that the binding site has an open conformation in solution. The lack of detectable dsRNA or dsRNA-DNA hybrid affinities indicates that the entry to the binding site is specific for the sugar-phosphate backbone and/or conformation of the duplex."
https://openalex.org/W2046478240,"Inappropriate activation of complement on the vascular endothelium of specific organs, or systemically, underlies the etiology of a number of diseases. These disorders include atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, atherosclerosis, age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and transplant rejection. Inhibition of the terminal step of complement activation, i.e. formation of the membrane attack complex, using CD59 has the advantage of retaining the upstream processes of the complement cascade necessary for fighting pathogens and retaining complement's crucial role in tissue homeostasis. Previous studies have shown the necessity of membrane targeting of soluble CD59 in order for it to prove an effective inhibitor of complement deposition both in vitro and in vivo. In this study we have generated an in vivo model of human complement activation on murine liver vascular endothelium. This model should prove useful for the development of anti-complement therapies for complement-induced pathologies of vascular endothelium. Using this model, we have demonstrated the viability of a non membrane-targeted soluble CD59 to significantly inhibit complement deposition on the endothelium of murine liver vasculature when expressed in vivo from an adenovirus. This result, unanticipated based on prior studies, suggests that the use of non membrane-targeted sCD59 as an anti-complement therapy be re-visited."
https://openalex.org/W2043781733,"Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) has two late domain (LD) motifs, PPPY and PTAP, which are important for viral budding. Mutations in the PPPY motif are more deleterious for viral release than changes in the PTAP motif. Several reports have shown that the interaction of PPPY with the WW domains of a Nedd4 (neuronal precursor cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated-4) family ubiquitin ligase (UL) is a critical event in virus release. We tested nine members of the Nedd4 family ULs and found that ITCH is the main contributor to HTLV-1 budding. ITCH overexpression strongly inhibited release and infectivity of wild-type (wt) HTLV-1, but rescued the release of infectious virions with certain mutations in the PPPY motif. Electron microscopy showed either fewer or misshapen virus particles when wt HTLV-1 was produced in the presence of overexpressed ITCH, whereas mutants with changes in the PPPY motif yielded normal looking particles at wt level. The other ULs had significantly weaker or no effects on HTLV-1 release and infectivity except for SMURF-1, which caused enhanced release of wt and all PPPY(-) mutant particles. These particles were poorly infectious and showed abnormal morphology by electron microscopy. Budding and infectivity defects due to overexpression of ITCH and SMURF-1 were correlated with higher than normal ubiquitination of Gag. Only silencing of ITCH, but not of WWP1, WWP2, and Nedd4, resulted in a reduction of HTLV-1 budding from 293T cells. The binding efficiencies between the HTLV-1 LD and WW domains of different ULs as measured by mammalian two-hybrid interaction did not correlate with the strength of their effect on HTLV-1 budding."
https://openalex.org/W1986168567,"Multipotent somatic stem cells have been identified in various adult tissues. However, the stem/progenitor cells of the peripheral nerves have been isolated only from fetal tissues. Here, we isolated Schwann-cell precursors/immature Schwann cells from the injured peripheral nerves of adult mice using a floating culture technique that we call “Schwann-spheres."" The Schwann-spheres were derived from de-differentiated mature Schwann cells harvested 24 hours to 6 weeks after peripheral nerve injury. They had extensive self-renewal and differentiation capabilities. They strongly expressed the immature-Schwann-cell marker p75, and differentiated only into the Schwann-cell lineage. The spheres showed enhanced myelin formation and neurite growth compared to mature Schwann cells in vitro. Mature Schwann cells have been considered a promising candidate for cell-transplantation therapies to repair the damaged nervous system, whereas these “Schwann-spheres"" would provide a more potential autologous cell source for such transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2141847159,"Burkholderia pseudomallei and Burkholderia mallei are category B select agents and must be studied under BSL3 containment in the United States. They are typically resistant to multiple antibiotics, and the antibiotics used to treat B. pseudomallei or B. mallei infections may not be used as selective agents with the corresponding Burkholderia species. Here, we investigated alanine racemase deficient mutants of B. pseudomallei and B. mallei for development of non-antibiotic-based genetic selection methods and for attenuation of virulence. The genome of B. pseudomallei K96243 has two annotated alanine racemase genes (bpsl2179 and bpss0711), and B. mallei ATCC 23344 has one (bma1575). Each of these genes encodes a functional enzyme that can complement the alanine racemase deficiency of Escherichia coli strain ALA1. Herein, we show that B. pseudomallei with in-frame deletions in both bpsl2179 and bpss0711, or B. mallei with an in-frame deletion in bma1575, requires exogenous d-alanine for growth. Introduction of bpsl2179 on a multicopy plasmid into alanine racemase deficient variants of either Burkholderia species eliminated the requirement for d-alanine. During log phase growth without d-alanine, the viable counts of alanine racemase deficient mutants of B. pseudomallei and B. mallei decreased within 2 hours by about 1000-fold and 10-fold, respectively, and no viable bacteria were present at 24 hours. We constructed several genetic tools with bpsl2179 as a selectable genetic marker, and we used them without any antibiotic selection to construct an in-frame ΔflgK mutant in the alanine racemase deficient variant of B. pseudomallei K96243. In murine peritoneal macrophages, wild type B. mallei ATCC 23344 was killed much more rapidly than wild type B. pseudomallei K96243. In addition, the alanine racemase deficient mutant of B. pseudomallei K96243 exhibited attenuation versus its isogenic parental strain with respect to growth and survival in murine peritoneal macrophages."
https://openalex.org/W1972299198,"Whether or not the spread of agriculture in Europe was accompanied by movements of people is a long-standing question in archeology and anthropology, which has been frequently addressed with the help of population genetic data. Estimates on dates of expansion and geographic origins obtained from genetic data are however sensitive to the calibration of mutation rates and to the mathematical models used to perform inference. For instance, recent data on the Y chromosome haplogroup R1b1b2 (M269) have either suggested a Neolithic origin for European paternal lineages or a more ancient Paleolithic origin depending on the calibration of Y-STR mutation rates. Here we examine the date of expansion and the geographic origin of hgR1b1b2 considering two current estimates of mutation rates in a total of fourteen realistic wave-of-advance models. We report that a range expansion dating to the Paleolithic is unlikely to explain the observed geographical distribution of microsatellite diversity, and that whether the data is informative with respect to the spread of agriculture in Europe depends on the mutation rate assumption in a critical way."
https://openalex.org/W2082183643,"γ-Aminobutyric acid type B (GABA(B)) receptors are important for slow synaptic inhibition in the CNS. The efficacy of inhibition is directly related to the stability of cell surface receptors. For GABA(B) receptors, heterodimerization between R1 and R2 subunits is critical for cell surface expression and signaling, but how this determines the rate and extent of receptor internalization is unknown. Here, we insert a high affinity α-bungarotoxin binding site into the N terminus of the R2 subunit and reveal its dominant role in regulating the internalization of GABA(B) receptors in live cells. To simultaneously study R1a and R2 trafficking, a new α-bungarotoxin binding site-labeling technique was used, allowing α-bungarotoxin conjugated to different fluorophores to selectively label R1a and R2 subunits. This approach demonstrated that R1a and R2 are internalized as dimers. In heterologous expression systems and neurons, the rates and extents of internalization for R1aR2 heteromers and R2 homomers are similar, suggesting a regulatory role for R2 in determining cell surface receptor stability. The fast internalization rate of R1a, which has been engineered to exit the endoplasmic reticulum, was slowed to that of R2 by truncating the R1a C-terminal tail or by removing a dileucine motif in its coiled-coil domain. Slowing the rate of internalization by co-assembly with R2 represents a novel role for GPCR heterodimerization whereby R2 subunits, via their C terminus coiled-coil domain, mask a dileucine motif on R1a subunits to determine the surface stability of the GABA(B) receptor."
