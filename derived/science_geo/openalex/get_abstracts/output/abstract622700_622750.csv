Yang et al. designed an iron-nickel-cobalt (Fe-Ni-Co) alloy laced with aluminum-titanium (Al-Ti) nanoparticles with both high strength and ductility. The key was getting the composition tuned correctly, because the Fe-Ni-Co matrix reacts with the Al-Ti nanoparticles. This was vital for avoiding environmental embrittlement, enhancing work hardening, and improving ductility. Science , this issue p. 933"

These caspases cleave gasdermin D (GSDMD), whose N-terminal fragments quickly form large permeability pores that induce cell death. However, a large percentage of cells with active inflammasomes are resistant to pyroptosis. Rühl et al. found that the membrane-remodeling ESCRT-III machinery was recruited to the plasma membrane upon GSDMD activation. ESCRT-III–dependent membrane repair limited proinflammatory cytokine secretion and pyroptosis after activation of inflammasomes. Science , this issue p. 956"

Akichika et al. quantified the abundance of this modification in the transcriptome and identified the writer protein, cap-specific adenosine methyltransferase (CAPAM), needed for this modification. CAPAM contains a unique structure that recognizes cap-specific N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) as the substrate. The protein interacts with RNA polymerase II, suggesting that the modification occurs cotranscriptionally. The m 6 Am promotes the translation of capped mRNAs in a eIF4E-independent fashion.

The lateral and posterior portions of the human cerebellum are disproportionately expanded in humans compared to apes and co-activate with cortex across a vast array of control-related functions supported by the frontoparietal network (Marek and Dosenbach, 2018Marek S.

Thus, the characterization of the cerebellum purely as a conserved motor structure is antiquated and inaccurate (Buckner, 2013Buckner R.L.

Although previous studies have provided an anatomical and functional framework for understanding cerebellar contributions to brain function, the degree of individual specificity in cerebellar functional organization is currently unknown. Quantification of individual cerebellar variability may deepen our understanding of how individual variability in cerebellar functional organization contributes to individual differences in behavior, psychopathology, and clinical outcomes. One promising approach for studying individual cerebellar network organization is through resting state functional connectivity MRI (RSFC), which has revolutionized our understanding of cortical network organization (Krienen and Buckner, 2009Krienen F.M.

Polimeni J.R. et al.The organization of the human cerebral cortex estimated by intrinsic functional connectivity.J. Neurophysiol. 2011; 106: 1125-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (3773) Google Scholar). However, many RSFC studies are cortico-centric, either omitting discussion of the cerebellum or not including the entirety of the cerebellum during data acquisition or analysis. In an influential study, Buckner and colleagues provided the first group-averaged organizational map of cerebellar functional networks (Buckner et al., 2011Buckner R.L. Krienen F.M. Castellanos A. Diaz J.C. Yeo B.T. The organization of the human cerebellum estimated by intrinsic functional connectivity.J. Neurophysiol. 2011; 106: 2322-2345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar). One crucial finding from this work was that association networks, including the frontoparietal network, were represented in the lateral cerebellum, supporting previous anatomical tracing studies and group-average task-based human imaging studies showing increased lateral cerebellar blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) activity during cognitive tasks (Dosenbach et al., 2006Dosenbach N.U.

Impaired non-motor learning and error detection associated with cerebellar damage. A single case study.Brain. 1992; 115: 155-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). These group-average studies of cerebellar RSFC, however, use limited quantities of data per individual, restricting our understanding of the degree of individual specificity in cerebellar networks. Moreover, relatively low signal-to-noise ratio within the cerebellum compared to the cortex, coupled with the small folia of the cerebellum, heightens the need for high-fidelity data. Recent work by Gordon and colleagues demonstrated the importance of precision functional mapping in humans (Gordon et al., 2017cGordon E.M. Laumann T.O. Gilmore A.W. Newbold D.J. Greene D.J. Berg J.J. Ortega M. Hoyt-Drazen C. Gratton C. Sun H. et al.Precision functional mapping of individual human brains.Neuron. 2017; 95: 791-807.e7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Precision functional mapping refers to the collection of large quantities of RSFC data (hours) within individual human subjects, which improves the signal-to-noise ratio and allows more precise characterization of functional network organization in individuals (Laumann et al., 2015Laumann T.O. Gordon E.M. Adeyemo B. Snyder A.Z. Joo S.J. Chen M.Y. Gilmore A.W. McDermott K.B. Nelson S.M. Dosenbach N.U. et al.Functional system and areal organization of a highly sampled individual human brain.Neuron. 2015; 87: 657-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). One critical finding from these studies is that cortical networks show both common organizational principles across individuals and individual-specific features, unresolvable in group-average data (Braga and Buckner, 2017Braga R.M.

With respect to the cerebellum, degenerative and acute damage tends to result in individual-specific motor and cognitive deficits (Fiez et al., 1992Fiez J.A. Petersen S.E. Cheney M.K. Raichle M.E. Impaired non-motor learning and error detection associated with cerebellar damage. A single case study.Brain. 1992; 115: 155-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar, Schmahmann and Sherman, 1998Schmahmann J.D. Sherman J.C. The cerebellar cognitive affective syndrome.Brain. 1998; 121: 561-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (2322) Google Scholar), suggesting individualized approaches to studying cerebellar organization would improve our understanding of patient populations. Theoretical accounts of cerebellar function ascribe it a role in adaptive control and experience-driven adaptive plasticity (Caligiore et al., 2017Caligiore D. Pezzulo G. Baldassarre G. Bostan A.C. Strick P.L. Doya K. Helmich R.C. Dirkx M. Houk J. Jörntell H. et al.Consensus paper: towards a systems-level view of cerebellar function: the interplay between cerebellum, basal ganglia, and cortex.Cerebellum. 2017; 16: 203-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Adaptive plasticity requires organized, ongoing communication between relevant brain regions. Such bidirectional communication has previously been observed to manifest in distinct frequencies (Mitra et al., 2016Mitra A. Snyder A.Z. Hacker C.D. Pahwa M. Tagliazucchi E. Laufs H. Leuthardt E.C. Raichle M.E. Human cortical-hippocampal dialogue in wake and slow-wave sleep.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2016; 113: E6868-E6876Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, van Kerkoerle et al., 2014van Kerkoerle T. Self M.W. Dagnino B. Gariel-Mathis M.A. Poort J. van der Togt C. Roelfsema P.R. Alpha and gamma oscillations characterize feedback and feedforward processing in monkey visual cortex.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2014; 111: 14332-14341Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Recently, Mitra and colleagues analyzed temporal lead/lag relationships across inter-regional BOLD signals to demonstrate that infra-slow activity (ISA) propagates through the human brain in a highly reproducible, state-dependent manner, giving rise to familiar RSFC networks (Mitra et al., 2014Mitra A. Snyder A.Z. Hacker C.D. Raichle M.E. Lag structure in resting-state fMRI.J. Neurophysiol. 2014; 111: 2374-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, Mitra et al., 2015Mitra A. Snyder A.Z. Blazey T. Raichle M.E. Lag threads organize the brain’s intrinsic activity.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2015; 112: E2235-E2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This lag analysis approach revealed directed ISA between the cortex and hippocampus that was directionally opposite of delta band (0.5–4 Hz) propagated activity. The temporal relationship between ISA and delta activity was subsequently found to be widespread across mouse cortex (Mitra et al., 2018Mitra A. Kraft A. Wright P. Acland B. Snyder A.Z. Rosenthal Z. Czerniewski L. Bauer A. Snyder L. Culver J. et al.Spontaneous infra-slow brain activity has unique spatiotemporal dynamics and laminar structure.Neuron. 2018; 98: 297-305.e6Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, the temporal lead-lag relationships within cerebro-cerebellar loops have not been characterized. As such, an examination of group- and individual-level propagation of ISA, as estimated with BOLD, within the cerebro-cerebellar closed-looped circuitry will provide insights into the temporal organization of the activity shared between these structures. The goal of the present study was to leverage the highly sampled Midnight Scan Club (MSC) dataset to simultaneously characterize (1) individual specificity and variability in cerebellar RSFC and network organization, as well as (2) group- and individual-level principles regarding the spatial organization of functional networks and the temporal propagation of ISA between the cerebellum and cortex. In each case, we benchmark the cerebellum against the cortex, noting differences in individual variability, network organization, and the temporal propagation of BOLD signals. We determined the reliability of RSFC correlations within the cerebellum by executing iterative split-half reliability analyses similar to Laumann et al., 2015Laumann T.O. Gordon E.M. Adeyemo B. Snyder A.Z. Joo S.J. Chen M.Y. Gilmore A.W. McDermott K.B. Nelson S.M. Dosenbach N.U. et al.Functional system and areal organization of a highly sampled individual human brain.Neuron. 2015; 87: 657-670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar and Gordon et al., 2017cGordon E.M. Laumann T.O. Gilmore A.W. Newbold D.J. Greene D.J. Berg J.J. Ortega M. Hoyt-Drazen C. Gratton C. Sun H. et al.Precision functional mapping of individual human brains.Neuron. 2017; 95: 791-807.e7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar (STAR Methods). Generally, cerebellar RSFC requires double the quantity of data of cortical RSFC to achieve the same level of split-half reliability. For example, excellent split-half reliability (r > 0.90) in cortical RSFC was achieved with 45 min of motion-censored data (as reported in Gordon et al., 2017cGordon E.M. Laumann T.O. Gilmore A.W. Newbold D.J. Greene D.J. Berg J.J. Ortega M. Hoyt-Drazen C. Gratton C. Sun H. et al.Precision functional mapping of individual human brains.Neuron. 2017; 95: 791-807.e7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), whereas equivalent excellent reliability (r > 0.90) in cerebellar RSFC was achieved with 90 min of motion censored data (Figures S1A–S1C and S1E). We repeated the reliability analysis voxel-wise across the cortex and cerebellum (as opposed to vertices in the cortex) to equate the measurement of two structures and observed this same principle (Figure S1D). Thus, typical RSFC data quantities (i.e., <30 min per individual) are not sufficient to provide stable estimates of individual cerebellar RSFC. Previous group-average studies have suggested that some of the cortical functional networks are also represented in the cerebellum (Buckner et al., 2011Buckner R.L. Krienen F.M. Castellanos A.

Distinct and overlapping functional zones in the cerebellum defined by resting state functional connectivity.Cereb. Cortex. 2010; 20: 953-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). We determined cerebellar functional network organization using a winner-take-all approach (WTA; STAR Methods; Buckner et al., 2011Buckner R.L. Krienen F.M. Castellanos A. Diaz J.C. Yeo B.T.

The human thalamus is an integrative hub for functional brain networks.J. Neurosci. 2017; 37: 5594-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar), assigning each cerebellar voxel to the cortical network to which it displayed the largest average correlation (Figure 1; for flat map WTA representations, see Figure S2; for cortical network assignments, see Figure S3). Several qualitative observations can be made in the group average (Figure 1A). Supporting previous results, foot, hand, and face motor representations were identified in the anterior cerebellum, running anterior-to-posterior, respectively. Control networks (frontoparietal and cingulo-opercular) demonstrated anatomically segregated representation along the anterior-to-posterior and medial-lateral axis, with the cingulo-opercular network represented medially in the anterior cerebellum, proximal to the motor networks, while the frontoparietal network was represented laterally and posteriorly. Similar to the control networks, the attention networks (dorsal attention and ventral attention) segregated along the A-P axis and had representations in both the dorsal and ventral cerebellum. The dorsal attention network was represented in the anterior cerebellum, whereas the ventral attention network was represented posteriorly, just posterior to the frontoparietal network. The default mode network was represented in the most medial posterior regions of the cerebellum, with additional representation in the flocculus. Replicating group average data (Buckner et al., 2011Buckner R.L. Krienen F.M. Castellanos A. Diaz J.C. Yeo B.T. The organization of the human cerebellum estimated by intrinsic functional connectivity.J. Neurophysiol. 2011; 106: 2322-2345Crossref PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar), visual and auditory networks were not represented in the cerebellum. Although all subjects exhibited similar network organization, there were deviations across individuals from the group average in terms of specific positioning and relative amount of cerebellum dedicated to each network (Figure 1B). For example, some subjects demonstrated greater representation of the dorsal attention network, while others demonstrated greater representation of the cingulo-opercular network. In the posterior cerebellum (axial slices), there is considerable inter-subject variability in the placement of divisions between the default mode and frontoparietal networks. Within the motor network representations of the dorsal anterior cerebellum, individual differences in the representation of each motor network can be noted in the parasagittal slices. Thus, both common organization principles and individual differences existed in the WTA assignments between subjects and between each subject and the MSC average. Importantly, because WTA partitions are dependent on the underlying RSFC matrix that does not achieve good reliability until ∼90 min of high-quality data have been acquired, large quantities of individual subject data are needed to achieve a stable estimate of individual cerebellar network organization. Despite achieving excellent RSFC reliability, one could argue the network partitions derived above might be spuriously variable between individuals due to the WTA method, which forces each voxel into a single “winning” network. To assuage these concerns, we calculated split-half reliability (see STAR Methods for details) on the WTA network assignments. On average, WTA network assignments required 90 min of post-motion censored RSFC data to achieve an average Spearman split-half correlation of 0.80 (Figure 2A). This quantity of data is equivalent to the quantities of data needed to delineate individual cortical networks (see Gordon et al., 2017cGordon E.M. Laumann T.O. Gilmore A.W. Newbold D.J. Greene D.J. Berg J.J. Ortega M. Hoyt-Drazen C. Gratton C. Sun H. et al.Precision functional mapping of individual human brains.Neuron. 2017; 95: 791-807.e7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Given that the individual WTA partitions were as reliable as cortical networks from Gordon et al., 2017cGordon E.M. Laumann T.O. Gilmore A.W. Newbold D.J. Greene D.J. Berg J.J. Ortega M. Hoyt-Drazen C. Gratton C.

By doing this, we were able to characterize which networks demonstrated a clear delineation between first and second place average RSFC with the cortex. On average, networks across the cerebellum demonstrated a clear delineation between first and second place networks, including both motor networks and—to an even greater extent—association networks, including the default mode and frontoparietal networks (Figures 2B and 2C), supporting the notion that single networks are reliably represented in many cerebellar voxels. Interestingly, the posterior cerebellum contained large representations of the premotor and cingulo-opercular networks, despite seeded correlations from primary motor cortex demonstrating strong connectivity to these same regions (see Figure S4 for cerebellar motor seed RSFC). Seed maps generated from posterior motor hand representations in the cerebellum revealed strong RSFC to cortical motor, premotor, and cingulo-opercular networks (Figure S5), providing evidence that the second representation of the cortex within the posterior cerebellum may be more integrative than the anterior representation. We validated the claim that large quantities of data enabled accurate characterization of individual-specific motor subdivisions (i.e., foot, hand, face) within the cerebellum by leveraging 40 runs of a motor task per subject (STAR Methods) and determining the convergence between resting state motor network partitions and motor foot, hand, and tongue task-evoked activity, separately. For every subject, we made a conjunction map within the cerebellum, overlapping task-evoked BOLD activity (for foot, hand, and tongue movements, separately) and WTA partitions (STAR Methods). Peak task-evoked BOLD activity in the cerebellum overlapped with individual WTA partitions in every subject across the three motor domains (Figure 3). Thus, precise partitioning of cerebellar motor networks is possible with large quantities of data. Functional networks within the cortex are dominated by common organizational principles (group effects), as well as stable individual features (individual effects) that are differentially distributed across cortical networks (Gratton et al., 2018Gratton C.

Here, we similarly determined the contribution of group effects versus individual effects at the single-voxel/vertex level, as well as at the network level across individuals (STAR Methods).

Sensory experience and perceptual learning can remodel neocortical synaptic circuits throughout life (Feldman, 2009Feldman D.E. Synaptic mechanisms for plasticity in neocortex.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 32: 33-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). The long-term potentiation and depression of synapses (LTP and LTD, respectively) constitute a fundamental underpinning of such functional cortical synaptic circuit plasticity (Bliss and Collingridge, 1993Bliss T.V.

Plasticity of cortical excitatory-inhibitory balance.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2015; 38: 195-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). However, the circuit mechanisms of cortical LTP and LTD remain unclear. In particular, the interactions of long-range feedback projections with local cortical microcircuits and the role thereof in local cortical plasticity have been poorly investigated. The mouse somatosensory cortex (S1) serves as an important model for LTP and LTD, largely owing to the one-to-one anatomical relationship between individual sensory organs (whiskers) and the cortical columns (Feldman, 2009Feldman D.E. Synaptic mechanisms for plasticity in neocortex.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2009; 32: 33-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). Hence, it is relatively easy to perform targeted recordings, as well as to selectively enhance or decrease sensory input. First-order, whisker sensory information passes to S1 through the ventroposterior medial (VPM) thalamus, which projects onto layer (L) 4 and L5b, representing the lemniscal pathway (Figures 1A and 1B ; Feldmeyer, 2012Feldmeyer D. Excitatory neuronal connectivity in the barrel cortex.Front. Neuroanat. 2012; 6: 24Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). L4 granule cells and L5b pyramidal neurons (PNs) in turn synapse, among others, onto L2/3 PNs, which are interconnected (Lefort et al., 2009Lefort S. Tomm C. Floyd Sarria J.C. Petersen C.C.

Excitatory neuronal connectivity in the barrel cortex.Front. Neuroanat. 2012; 6: 24Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Higher-order thalamocortical afferents from the posteromedial thalamic complex (POm) join ascending sensory input to S1 and project onto L2/3 and L5a PNs, representing the paralemniscal pathway (Bureau et al., 2006Bureau I. von Saint Paul F.

Therefore, both lemniscal inputs (via L4) and paralemniscal inputs (via direct POm projections) arrive at L2/3 PNs. The functional difference between the lemniscal and paralemniscal thalamocortical pathways is still enigmatic. Some studies suggest that they represent parallel information streams, whereas others propose that they are hierarchically linked (Diamond et al., 2008Diamond M.E. von Heimendahl M. Knutsen P.M.

Thalamus plays a central role in ongoing cortical functioning.Nat. Neurosci. 2016; 19: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). L2/3 PNs are inhibited by a variety of inhibitory interneurons (INs). In particular, their perisomatic regions are mainly inhibited by parvalbumin (PV)-expressing INs (Freund and Katona, 2007Freund T.F. Katona I.

L2/3 PNs in S1 can undergo LTP following frequent stimulation of L4 (Aroniadou-Anderjaska and Keller, 1995Aroniadou-Anderjaska V. Keller A.

In vivo, LTP can also be induced by rhythmic whisker stimulation (RWS) (Delacour et al., 1990Delacour J. Houcine O. Costa J.C.

Sensory-evoked LTP driven by dendritic plateau potentials in vivo.Nature. 2014; 515: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This form of postsynaptic LTP does not necessarily rely on back-propagating action potentials (bAPs) but is driven by long-lasting N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated potentials that are dependent on the activity of the POm (Gambino et al., 2014Gambino F. Pagès S. Kehayas V. Baptista D. Tatti R. Carleton A. Holtmaat A. Sensory-evoked LTP driven by dendritic plateau potentials in vivo.Nature. 2014; 515: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This suggests that lemniscal as well as paralemniscal activity is necessary to induce LTP. However, it remains unclear whether co-activity of the POm and L4 alone is sufficient to drive LTP in L2/3 PNs and what, exactly, are the underlying microcircuits within S1 that mediate this LTP. Here, we aimed at dissecting the circuit underpinnings of this type of plasticity in thalamocortical slices by isolating the synaptic inputs that we suspect are driving the RWS-evoked LTP in L2/3 PNs in vivo. We paired optogenetic stimulation of POm afferents with electrical stimulation of L4-originating or ascending pathways over the same time course and at the same frequency (1 min; 8 Hz) as LTP-evoking RWS in vivo. We demonstrate that this rhythmic paired stimulation is sufficient to drive LTP of L2/3 PN excitatory synapses and is occluded by prior RWS in vivo. Furthermore, we show that the paired stimulation (PS) of L4 and the POm increases PV and VIP IN activity, whereas it reduces SST IN activity. Together, this leads to a disinhibition of L2/3 PN dendrites. Finally, we show that both direct POm input to L2/3 PNs and the VIP-mediated disinhibition are necessary to drive LTP. Previous work indicates that rhythmic activation of L2/3 synapses or RWS can induce LTP (Delacour et al., 1990Delacour J. Houcine O. Costa J.C.

Sensory-evoked LTP driven by dendritic plateau potentials in vivo.Nature. 2014; 515: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). RWS-driven potentiation is dependent on the recruitment of thalamocortical inputs originating in the POm (Gambino et al., 2014Gambino F. Pagès S. Kehayas V. Baptista D. Tatti R. Carleton A. Holtmaat A. Sensory-evoked LTP driven by dendritic plateau potentials in vivo.Nature. 2014; 515: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To mimic this paradigm in thalamocortical brain slices, we recorded intracellular responses from L2/3 PNs while pairing electrical stimuli (ES) of L4 with optical stimuli (OS) of POm afferents expressing the light-gated ion channel channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) (Zhang et al., 2006Zhang F. Wang L.P. Boyden E.S. Deisseroth K. Channelrhodopsin-2 and optical control of excitable cells.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 785-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) at 8 Hz for 1 min (Figures 1A and 1B; STAR Methods). ChR2 was expressed in POm neurons using targeted injections of recombinant adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV). Successful injections could be identified by virtue of robust expression of ChR2-tdTomato in POm neurons, as well as by the distinct expression pattern in the barrel cortex of S1, where dense projections could be observed in L1 and L5 and not in L4 (Figures 1A, 1C, and S1A–S1C; Wimmer et al., 2010Wimmer V.C. Bruno R.M. de Kock C.P. Kuner T. Sakmann B. Dimensions of a projection column and architecture of VPM and POm axons in rat vibrissal cortex.Cereb. Cortex. 2010; 20: 2265-2276Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Typical spiking patterns induced by current steps identified L2/3 PNs (Figure 1D; Avermann et al., 2012Avermann M. Tomm C. Mateo C. Gerstner W. Petersen C.C. Microcircuits of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in layer 2/3 of mouse barrel cortex.J. Neurophysiol. 2012; 107: 3116-3134Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). A single electrical stimulation pulse in L4 (L4-ES) (0.2 ms) evoked a depolarizing postsynaptic potential (PSP) in L2/3 PNs, incidentally followed by a hyperpolarizing overshoot (Figure 1D). The latter component was eliminated by blocking γ-aminobutyric acid receptors (GABARs) using bath application of picrotoxin (Ptx) (100 μM, specifically GABAAR), which is consistent with L4-mediated feedforward inhibition (House et al., 2011House D.R. Elstrott J. Koh E. Chung J. Feldman D.E. Parallel regulation of feedforward inhibition and excitation during whisker map plasticity.Neuron. 2011; 72: 819-831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Optical stimulation of ChR2-expressing POm projections (POm-OS) (5-ms pulse) consistently evoked a depolarizing PSP (Figure 1D). Bath application of Ptx slightly reduced the POm-evoked PSP, suggesting that those inputs are already disinhibited under baseline conditions. Bath application of 2,3-dihydroxy-6-nitro-7-sulfamoyl-benzo[f]quinoxaline-2,3-dione (NBQX) (10 μM) completely eliminated the L4 and POm-evoked PSPs, indicating dependence on α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) (Figure 1D). We performed rhythmic paired stimulation (RPS) of L4 and POm (8 Hz; 1 min) and measured both L4 and POm-evoked PSP amplitudes pre- and post-pairing (Figure 1E). RPS significantly increased mean L4-evoked PSP amplitudes (Figures 1F and 1G). Mean POm-evoked PSP amplitudes were not significantly potentiated (Figures 1H and 1I), which demonstrates that the LTP is expressed on intracortical and not on thalamocortical synapses. To determine whether activity of POm afferents is necessary for RPS-driven LTP, we repeated the RPS experiment with both ChR2 and hM4Di receptors (inhibitory designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs [DREADDs]) present in the POm (Figure 1J; Armbruster et al., 2007Armbruster B.N. Li X. Pausch M.H. Herlitze S. Roth B.L. Evolving the lock to fit the key to create a family of G protein-coupled receptors potently activated by an inert ligand.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2007; 104: 5163-5168Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). The hM4Di receptors were activated by bath application of the synthetic agonist clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) (500 nM), which diminished the likelihood of eliciting a POm-evoked PSP (59% increase in failure rate; Figure 1K; Stachniak et al., 2014Stachniak T.J. Ghosh A. Sternson S.M. Chemogenetic synaptic silencing of neural circuits localizes a hypothalamus→midbrain pathway for feeding behavior.Neuron. 2014; 82: 797-808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, RPS did not elicit significant LTP (Figures 1L and 1M). This effect was not attributable to the CNO itself, because the presence of CNO did not prevent RPS-driven LTP in slices that lacked hM4Di expression (Figures 1L and 1N). This suggests that reduced POm activity prevents LTP, which is consistent with previous findings in vivo (Gambino et al., 2014Gambino F. Pagès S. Kehayas V. Baptista D. Tatti R. Carleton A. Holtmaat A. Sensory-evoked LTP driven by dendritic plateau potentials in vivo.Nature. 2014; 515: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To corroborate these findings, we tested the effect of rhythmic stimulation of L4 only, which has previously been shown to elicit LTP (Aroniadou-Anderjaska and Keller, 1995Aroniadou-Anderjaska V. Keller A. LTP in the barrel cortex of adult rats.Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 2297-2300Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, Castro-Alamancos et al., 1995Castro-Alamancos M.A. Donoghue J.P.

Long-term potentiation in vivo in layers II/III of rat barrel cortex.Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 581-592Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). L4 rhythmic electrical stimulation at 8 Hz for 1 min (L4-RES) did not significantly increase mean L4-evoked PSP amplitudes (Figures S1D–S1F). Nonetheless, in 4 out of 7 cells, L4-RES induced a significant LTP. These data suggest that L4-RES alone is able to induce LTP in some cells, which may, however, be due to the incidental recruitment of POm ascending fibers passing through L4. Therefore, to eliminate any residual contribution of POm-derived inputs in the L4-RES paradigm, we repeated the experiment using hM4Di expression in the POm. Upon decreased synaptic transmission of POm afferents, L4-RES failed to increase the mean L4-evoked PSP amplitudes (Figures S1E and S1F). Normalized L4-evoked PSP amplitudes were significantly larger after the L4-RES protocol as compared to L4-RES under decreased POm activity (Figure S1F). None of the suppressed LTP effects above were attributable to a change in baseline L4 or POm PSP amplitudes, as across experiments baseline PSP size was not correlated with LTP size; nor was there a correlation between LTP size and various electrophysiological parameters (Figure S1G and S1H). Together, the data strongly suggest that POm inputs are required to drive LTP upon rhythmic activation of L2/3 PN synapses. We observed no spikes upon RPS or L4-RES. Thus, similar to in vivo experiments, the LTP occurs in the absence of bAPs and instead could have been caused by long-lasting subthreshold depolarization (Gambino et al., 2014Gambino F. Pagès S. Kehayas V. Baptista D. Tatti R. Carleton A. Holtmaat A. Sensory-evoked LTP driven by dendritic plateau potentials in vivo.Nature. 2014; 515: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Indeed, we found an increase in cumulative PSP amplitudes during RPS as compared to L4-RES under decreased POm activity (Figures S1I–S1K). The amplitude of the 1st PSP upon the repeated pairing, which is a measure of the increased depolarization, was predictive of the size of the LTP (Figures S1L and S1M). Altogether, these data indicate that the activation of POm-derived paralemniscal circuitry, during rhythmic stimulation, is necessary to drive the potentiation of cortically originating synaptic circuits. Hence, in all of the following experiments, we used RPS-driven LTP to investigate the cellular and circuit underpinnings (STAR Methods). We next used pharmacology to investigate the mechanisms underlying this LTP. RPS under a GABAR block (using 100 μM Ptx) elicited a robust LTP in all PNs (Figures 2A and 2B ). L4-evoked PSP amplitudes did not increase without RPS (Figure 2E, no RPSPtx), excluding the possibility that the observed effect was caused by a ramping up of baseline responses upon a GABAR block. When the NMDAR blocker (2R)-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) (50 μM) was added, LTP could not be elicited (Figures 2C–2E). These data indicate that the LTP occurs at excitatory synapses, is NMDAR dependent, and is not attributable to plasticity of inhibitory connections. Similar to the silencing of POm inputs, the NMDAR block reduced PSP amplitudes at the start of the RPS period and significantly impaired the cumulative depolarization (Figures S2A–S2C). This is consistent with the in vivo observation that POm inputs promote LTP through the facilitation of NMDAR-mediated conductance. We hypothesized that, if RPS-driven LTP shares its underlying mechanisms with RWS-driven plasticity in vivo, RWS would occlude subsequent RPS-driven potentiation in slices from these mice. To test this, we rhythmically stimulated the whiskers with piezoelectric actuators (8 Hz; 10 min; STAR Methods). It has previously been shown that rhythmic stimulation of all or a single whisker in anesthetized animals induces a robust increase in whisker-evoked cortical local field potentials and LTP, respectively (Mégevand et al., 2009Mégevand P. Troncoso E. Quairiaux C. Muller D. Michel C.M. Kiss J.Z. Long-term plasticity in mouse sensorimotor circuits after rhythmic whisker stimulation.J.

Sensory-evoked LTP driven by dendritic plateau potentials in vivo.Nature. 2014; 515: 116-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Here, we chose to stimulate all whiskers to increase the number of cells and barrel columns that could express LTP. This was followed by immediate slice preparation and RPS (Figure 2F; STAR Methods). We found that RPS failed to induce significant LTP in slices of mice that had undergone prior RWS (Figures 2F–2H, RPSRWS). Similarly, RPS-driven LTP in slices followed by a second RPS could not elicit further LTP (Figure S2D, 2nd RPS). Altogether, these results suggest that the paired stimulation of L4 and POm pathways ex vivo results in an LTP of a large fraction of the synapses that are also potentiated by RWS in vivo and implies that similar synaptic circuits are recruited by repeated sensory stimuli. We next questioned whether the excitatory inputs from L4 and POm onto L2/3 PNs are sufficient to induce LTP or whether local disinhibition is also required (Gambino and Holtmaat, 2012Gambino F.

However, experimental approaches often focus on singular behavioral paradigms or brain areas. Here, we recorded whole-brain neuronal activity of larval zebrafish presented with a battery of visual stimuli while recording fictive motor output. We identified neurons tuned to each stimulus type and motor output and discovered groups of neurons in the anterior hindbrain that respond to different stimuli eliciting similar behavioral responses. These convergent sensorimotor representations were only weakly correlated to instantaneous motor activity, suggesting that they critically inform, but do not directly generate, behavioral choices. To catalog brain-wide activity beyond explicit sensorimotor processing, we developed an unsupervised clustering technique that organizes neurons into functional groups. These analyses enabled a broad overview of the functional organization of the brain and revealed numerous brain nuclei whose neurons exhibit concerted activity patterns."

While naive embryonic stem cells (ESCs) can be maintained in a hypomethylated state with open chromatin when grown using two small-molecule inhibitors (2i)/leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), in contrast to serum/LIF-grown ESCs that resemble early post-implantation embryos, broader features of the ground-state pluripotent epigenome are not well understood. We identified epigenetic features of mouse ESCs cultured using 2i/LIF or serum/LIF by proteomic profiling of chromatin-associated complexes and histone modifications. Polycomb-repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and its product H3K27me3 are highly abundant in 2i/LIF ESCs, and H3K27me3 is distributed genome-wide in a CpG-dependent fashion. Consistently, PRC2-deficient ESCs showed increased DNA methylation at sites normally occupied by H3K27me3 and increased H4 acetylation. Inhibiting DNA methylation in PRC2-deficient ESCs did not affect their viability or transcriptome. Our findings suggest a unique H3K27me3 configuration protects naive ESCs from lineage priming, and they reveal widespread epigenetic crosstalk in ground-state pluripotency."

https://openalex.org/W2900626213,"Disseminated breast cancer cells employ adaptive molecular responses following cytotoxic therapeutic insult which promotes their survival and subsequent outgrowth. Here we demonstrate that expression of the pro-metastatic lncRNA BORG (BMP/OP-Responsive Gene) is greatly induced within triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells subjected to environmental and chemotherapeutic stresses commonly faced by TNBC cells throughout the metastatic cascade. This stress-mediated induction of BORG expression fosters the survival of TNBC cells and renders them resistant to the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin both in vitro and in vivo. The chemoresistant traits of BORG depend upon its robust activation of the NF-κB signaling axis via a novel BORG-mediated feed-forward signaling loop, and via its ability to bind and activate RPA1. Indeed, genetic and pharmacologic inhibition of NF-κB signaling or the DNA-binding activity of RPA1 abrogates the pro-survival features of BORG and renders BORG-expressing TNBCs sensitive to doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity. These findings suggest that therapeutic targeting of BORG or its downstream molecular effectors may provide a novel means to alleviate TNBC recurrence."
https://openalex.org/W2901464038,"Leukemias exhibit a dysregulated developmental program mediated through both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. Although IKZF2 is expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), we found that it is dispensable for mouse and human HSC function. In contrast to its role as a tumor suppressor in hypodiploid B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, we found that IKZF2 is required for myeloid leukemia. IKZF2 is highly expressed in leukemic stem cells (LSCs), and its deficiency results in defective LSC function. IKZF2 depletion in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells reduced colony formation, increased differentiation and apoptosis, and delayed leukemogenesis. Gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and direct IKZF2 binding in MLL-AF9 LSCs demonstrate that IKZF2 regulates a HOXA9 self-renewal gene expression program and inhibits a C/EBP-driven differentiation program. Ectopic HOXA9 expression and CEBPE depletion rescued the effects of IKZF2 depletion. Thus, our study shows that IKZF2 regulates the AML LSC program and provides a rationale to therapeutically target IKZF2 in myeloid leukemia."

Breakdown of this barrier can lead to significant morbidity and potentially life-threatening infections for patients. Determining the identity and organization of oral epithelial progenitor cells (OEPCs) is therefore paramount to understanding their roles in homeostasis and disease. Using lineage tracing and label retention experiments, we show that rapidly dividing OEPCs are located broadly within the basal layer of the mucosa throughout the oral cavity. Quantitative clonal analysis demonstrated that OEPCs undergo population-asymmetrical divisions following neutral drift dynamics and that they respond to chemotherapy-induced damage by altering daughter cell fates. Finally, using single-cell RNA-seq, we establish the basal layer population structure and propose a model that defines the organization of cells within the basal layer."

https://openalex.org/W2902571864,"An engineered oncolytic herpesvirus shows enhanced intratumoral spread, resistance to NK cell clearance and improved efficacy against brain cancer in mice. The efficacy of oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) is limited by rapid viral clearance by innate immune effector cells and poor intratumoral viral spread. We combine two approaches to overcome these barriers: inhibition of natural killer (NK) cells and enhancement of intratumoral viral spread. We engineered an oHSV to express CDH1, encoding E-cadherin, an adherent molecule and a ligand for KLRG1, an inhibitory receptor expressed on NK cells. In vitro, infection with this engineered virus, named OV-CDH1, induced high surface E-cadherin expression on infected glioblastoma (GBM) cells, which typically lack endogenous E-cadherin. Ectopically expressed E-cadherin enhanced the spread of OV-CDH1 by facilitating cell-to-cell infection and viral entry and reduced viral clearance by selectively protecting OV-CDH1-infected cells from KLRG1+ NK cell killing. In vivo, OV-CDH1 treatment substantially prolonged the survival in GBM-bearing mouse models, primarily because of improved viral spread rather than inhibition of NK cell activity. Thus, virus-induced overexpression of E-cadherin may be a generalizable strategy for improving cancer virotherapy."

Here, we directly investigate the impact that neocortical structure has on the integrative and computational properties of L5B pyramidal neurons of the rat primary visual cortex (V1). Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that the thickness of the rat neocortex exhibited a 3-fold range across the neocortical mantle (Figures 1A and S1; ∼1 to ∼3 mm, measured as the perpendicular distance from the pia to the subcortical white matter; 50 μm resolution; n = 5 registered brains), consistent with histological analysis (Paxinos and Watson, 2007Paxinos G. Watson C. The Rat Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates.Sixth Edition. Elsevier, 2007Google Scholar). Within the primary visual cortex, a rapid gradient of neocortical thickness was apparent (Figures 1B–1E). This gradient ran rostro-caudally, in line with the long axis of V1 (Figure 1C). The thickness of the neocortex was greatest in rostral V1 (maximum 1.90 mm), transitioned to a minimum at the caudal pole (minimum 0.97 mm), and was similar between hemispheres when determined both algorithmically (Figure 1C) and manually (Figures 1D and 1E; left V1: rostral = 1.70 mm, caudal = 1.39 mm; right V1: rostral = 1.71 mm, caudal = 1.36 mm). In contrast, considerably less variation was apparent across the medial-lateral axis of V1 (Figure S1; rostral = 1.79–1.90 mm; caudal = 0.97–1.26 mm). The morphology of the apical dendritic tree of L5B neurons changed considerably across the longitudinal rostro-caudal axis of V1 (Figures 2A and 2B ). Anatomical reconstruction of biocytin-filled neurons, recorded in acute brain slices of V1, revealed that the morphology of L5B pyramidal neurons was dominated by a large apical dendritic trunk that branched into an extensive tuft in layer 1 (Figure 2A). Across the rostro-caudal axis of V1, the average path length from the soma to the termini of apical tuft dendrites linearly decreased (Figure 2D; range = 584–1,108 μm; linear regression: slope = 68.0 μm/mm of bregma, r = 0.71, F = 98.2, n = 97, p < 0.0001). This relationship was formed by a change in apical trunk path length, as no gradient of the path length of apical dendritic tuft dendrites was observed (Figures 2E and S2A; trunk path length measured from the soma to the base of the tuft: range = 354–882 μm; linear regression; slope = 63.6 μm/mm of bregma, r = 0.71, F = 98.4, n = 97, p < 0.0001; average tuft path length measured from the base to the termini of apical dendritic tuft dendrites: F = 0.81, n = 97, p = 0.371). Notably, this rostro-caudal gradient was unaccompanied by differences in the diameter of the apical dendritic trunk or the branching complexity and field volume of the apical dendritic tuft (Figures S2 and S3). Furthermore, oblique dendrites, which decorated the proximal apical dendritic trunk, did not change in size across V1, although there was a positive correlation with the apical trunk length (Figure S2). Similarly, the volume and total length of the basal dendritic tree did not differ across V1 (Figures 2C and S2). A correlation was, however, apparent between soma volume and rostro-caudal position (Figure S2). Importantly, retrograde tracer injections revealed that the rostro-caudal gradient of apical dendritic morphology was indistinguishable for L5B pyramidal neurons projecting to an identified subcortical target, the superior colliculus (Figures 2D–2F; red symbols represent superior-colliculi projecting L5B pyramidal neurons). Taken together, these findings indicate that a gradient of neocortical thickness across V1 governs the apical dendritic trunk length of L5B pyramidal neurons, defining the physical distance that separates the apical tuft from the rest of the neuron. In order to test if the rostro-caudal gradient of apical dendritic morphology impacts the integrative operations of V1 L5B pyramidal neurons, we made simultaneous triple current-clamp whole-cell recordings from the soma and distal apical dendritic sites. All dendritic recordings were made at the base of the apical dendritic tuft using closely spaced electrodes to independently inject current and record voltage (Figures 3A, 3B, and S4A; apical dendritic trunk length = 550.9 ± 10.4 μm; dendritic recording distance from soma = 527.1 ± 10.9 μm; n = 125; dendritic electrode separation = 10.7 ± 1.1 μm). We first analyzed the somatic impact of dendritic voltage responses generated by long steps of negative current (Figures 3A and 3B; peak dendritic voltage response = −20.1 ± 0.1 mV, dendritic current = −0.68 ± 0.02 nA, duration = 600 ms). In caudal V1 L5B pyramidal neurons a considerable proportion of voltage spread from the dendritic site of generation to the soma, whereas in rostral V1 neurons, only a small fraction of voltage was recorded from the soma at peak and steady state (Figures 3A and 3B). Analysis across the rostro-caudal axis of V1 revealed that the fraction of voltage reaching the soma declined as the length of the apical dendritic trunk increased, a relationship that could be fit with an exponential function (Figures 3C, 3D, and S4B; 50% voltage transfer = 334 μm). A similar relationship was found for the somato-dendritic spread of voltage signals (Figures 3E, 3F, and S4B; peak somatic voltage response = −19.9 ± 0.1 mV, somatic current = −0.76 ± 0.03 nA; 50% voltage transfer = 330 μm). These data indicate that the electrical architecture of L5B pyramidal neurons is not preserved across the rostro-caudal axis of V1 and suggest that the electrical compactness of caudal L5B pyramidal neurons may limit the expression of multilayered active dendritic integration, a functional hallmark of L5B pyramidal neurons (Larkum, 2013Larkum M. A cellular mechanism for cortical associations: an organizing principle for the cerebral cortex.Trends Neurosci. 2013; 36: 141-151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, Stuart and Spruston, 2015Stuart G.J. Spruston N. Dendritic integration: 60 years of progress.Nat. Neurosci. 2015; 18: 1713-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In order to test this idea, we injected rheobase-positive current steps at distal apical dendritic recording sites. In rostral L5B pyramidal neurons, dendritic current steps evoked large-amplitude apical dendritic spikes (Figure 4A). In contrast, in caudal L5B pyramidal neurons, dendritic current steps did not generate dendritic spikes; rather, voltage spread directly from the dendritic site of generation to the soma and axon to initiate AP firing (Figure 4A). Analysis of the time interval between the detection of regenerative spikes at dendritic and somatic recording sites revealed an apical dendritic trunk-length-dependent bifurcation (Figure 4B). In caudal L5B pyramidal neurons, with apical dendritic trunks <480 μm, dendritic excitation typically directly evoked AP firing (40 of 48 neurons), whereas in larger rostral neurons, dendritic spikes preceded and drove AP output (Figure 4B; >550 μm, 49 of 49 neurons). In contrast, when rheobase-positive current steps were injected at the soma, a simple monotonic distance-dependent relationship was found as APs back-propagated to the dendritic recording site (Figure 4C). To explore if this bifurcation of dendritic integrative behavior was also apparent in response to more physiological patterns of dendritic excitatory input, we utilized microiontophoresis techniques to drive dendritic excitation through the activation of glutamate-receptor-mediated mechanisms (Müller et al., 2012Müller C. Beck H. Coulter D. Remy S. Inhibitory control of linear and supralinear dendritic excitation in CA1 pyramidal neurons.Neuron. 2012; 75: 851-864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Consistent with results obtained using dendritic current steps, we found that the brief and local apical dendritic iontophoretic application of glutamate evoked fast excitatory responses leading to the powerful generation of dendritic spikes in rostral L5B pyramidal neurons (Figures 4D and S5A–S5C; distance from soma = 585.1 ± 26.1 μm, n = 6). In contrast, in caudal neurons, glutamate-evoked dendritic excitatory responses did not evoke dendritic electrogenesis; instead, voltage spread to the soma and axon to directly drive AP firing (Figure 4D, Figures S5A–S5C; distance from soma = 387.0 ± 18.8 μm, n = 7). Furthermore, in response to the generation of families of simulated dual-component AMPA:NMDA-receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), generated using dendritic dynamic-clamp techniques (Harnett et al., 2015Harnett M.T. Magee J.C. Williams S.R. Distribution and function of HCN channels in the apical dendritic tuft of neocortical pyramidal neurons.J. Neurosci. 2015; 35: 1024-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), a dendritic spike was initiated as a threshold response in rostral neurons and throughout a wide supra-threshold range (Figure 4E; distance from soma = 644.0 ± 25.0 μm, n = 8). In caudal neurons, however, dynamic-clamp EPSPs failed to evoke dendritic electrogenesis but directly drove AP firing across a wide supra-threshold range (Figures 4E, S5D, and S5E; distance from soma = 383.8 ± 6.4 μm, n = 10). These data reveal that excitatory input to rostral L5B pyramidal neurons is locally integrated in the apical dendritic tree, whereas in caudal L5B pyramidal neurons, the integration of dendritic excitatory input occurs axo-somatically. As previous work has indicated that synaptic integration at dendritic and axo-somatic sites occurs over distinct temporal windows (Williams and Stuart, 2002Williams S.R. Stuart G.J. Dependence of EPSP efficacy on synapse location in neocortical pyramidal neurons.Science. 2002; 295: 1907-1910Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar), we tested if the temporal integration of dendritic excitatory input was distinct in rostral and caudal V1 L5B pyramidal neurons. In rostral neurons, the time window for the integration of dendritic dual-component AMPA:NMDA EPSPs was vanishingly short, with neuronal output generated by only two temporally coincident EPSPs in 7 of 8 neurons (Figures 4F and 4G; dynamic-clamp EPSPs separated in time by 0 to ±45 ms, in 5-ms steps). This pattern of neuronal output was generated by local dendritic integration, leading to the generation of dendritic spikes that subsequently drove AP firing (Figures 4F and 4G). Conversely, caudal neurons integrated dendritic dynamic-clamp EPSPs over a longer time window and did not require input precision to elicit AP firing, which was invariably driven by the direct spread of dendritic depolarization to the axonal site of AP initiation (Figures 4H and 4I). A similar disparity of integration time windows was observed when dendritic simulated EPSPs were generated in response to ideal current sources (Figures S5F–S5I). Synaptic integration in the distal dendritic arbor of rostral V1 L5B pyramidal neurons therefore occurs locally and is operational over the fast dendritic time constant, whereas the integration of dendritic excitatory input in caudal L5B pyramidal neurons occurs over the longer axo-somatic time constant. Thus, direct recording from an anatomically common site, the base of the apical dendritic tuft, demonstrates that the electrical architecture and dendritic integrative properties of L5B pyramidal neurons are not canonical in V1 but are determined by the physical size of the apical dendritic arbor. To investigate if active conductances define the electrical architecture of rostral and caudal V1 L5B pyramidal neurons, we pharmacologically blocked the major resting conductances, mediated by hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels (ZD7288, 10 μm) and voltage-gated sodium (NaV) channels (Tetrodotoxin, TTX, 1 μm), which shape subthreshold voltage responses (Harnett et al., 2015Harnett M.T.

Neurosci. 2015; 35: 1024-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, Stuart, 1999Stuart G. Voltage-activated sodium channels amplify inhibition in neocortical pyramidal neurons.Nat.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3501-3510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Simultaneous somato-dendritic recordings demonstrated that the pharmacological reduction of resting conductance significantly increased apparent input resistance at somatic and apical dendritic recording sites and eliminated time-dependent rectification (Figures 5A–5E and S4C; somatic [t test, p < 0.0001, n = 47] and dendritic [t test, p < 0.0001, n = 47] steady-state apparent input resistance significantly different between conditions). Notably, however, when resting conductance was pharmacologically reduced, we observed significant differences in the spread of voltage between distal apical dendritic sites and the soma of rostral and caudal L5B pyramidal neurons (Figures 5A and 5B). For comparative analysis, we divided L5B pyramidal neurons into two groups, caudal neurons (with apical trunk lengths of <480 μm) and rostral neurons (with apical trunk lengths >550 μm), a division guided by the bifurcation of dendritic integrative behavior (Figure 4). When resting conductance was reduced, a significantly greater proportion of voltage spread from distal apical dendritic sites to the soma of caudal L5B pyramidal neurons (Figures 5F and 5H; dendro-somatic voltage transfer in blockers: caudal = 0.61 ± 0.02, n = 14; rostral = 0.45 ± 0.02, n = 24; t test, p < 0.0001). The pharmacological reduction of resting conductance had a similar impact on somato-dendritic voltage transfer (Figures 5G and 5H). Together, these data indicate that rostral and caudal V1 L5B pyramidal neurons differ in their electrical architecture. To explore the determinants of voltage attenuation in rostral and caudal L5B pyramidal neurons, we modeled experimental data using the NEURON simulation environment (Hines and Carnevale, 1997Hines M.L. Carnevale N.T. The NEURON simulation environment.Neural Comput. 1997; 9: 1179-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (1843) Google Scholar). Morphologically accurate, compartmental models were created (n = 32), and direct parameter fitting was used to determine the passive membrane properties: specific membrane resistance (Rm), specific membrane capacitance (Cm), and intracellular resistivity (Ri). Dendritic spines were not explicitly modeled but were incorporated by scaling biophysical parameters to account for additional membrane surface area (Stuart and Spruston, 1998Stuart G. Spruston N. Determinants of voltage attenuation in neocortical pyramidal neuron dendrites.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3501-3510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We fit experimental voltage responses evoked by long (−50 and −100 pA, 800 ms) and short (−2 nA, 1 ms) apical dendritic nexus current pulses recorded in the presence of antagonists of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission and pharmacological blockers of resting conductance (Figure 6; ZD7288, 10 μM; TTX, 1 μM). Experimentally recorded somatic and dendritic voltage responses were best described by a passive model in which Rm declined sigmoidally with distance in the apical dendritic tree, despite the pharmacological blockade of HCN channels, as previously described for L5B pyramidal neurons of the somatosensory cortex (Stuart and Spruston, 1998Stuart G. Spruston N. Determinants of voltage attenuation in neocortical pyramidal neuron dendrites.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3501-3510Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Figures 6A–6C; average error per fitted trace calculated by region fitness between experimental and simulated traces: uniform versus sigmoidal Rm; t test, p < 0.0001, n = 20). The distribution of Rm across the apical dendritic trees of rostral and caudal neurons was similar, with both exhibiting a substantial decrease in the apical tuft (Figure 6D). The average Rm across the entire neuron was not gradated across V1 (Figure 6F; n = 32, mean = 22.45 ± 1.05 kΩ cm2; linear regression with reference to apical trunk length: F = 0.018, p = 0.89). However, due to the larger size of the apical dendritic tree, rostral neurons exhibited a greater whole-cell passive conductance (Figure 6J; caudal: total gpassive = 18.97 ± 1.28 nS, n = 10; rostral: total gpassive = 53.32 ± 11.53 nS, n = 18; Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.0001), which was attributable to a difference in passive apical dendritic conductance (caudal: apical dendrite gpassive = 12.61 ± 1.21 nS, n = 10; rostral: apical dendrite gpassive = 44.98 ± 11.52 nS, n = 18; Mann-Whitney test, p < 0.0001). The specific membrane capacitance remained relatively constant across neurons (Figure 6G; linear regression with reference to trunk length: F = 0.1, p = 0.75, mean = 1.31 ± 0.04 μF/cm2, n = 32). Surprisingly, however, direct fitting revealed that the specific intracellular resistivity of L5B pyramidal neurons showed a steep gradient across V1 (Figure 6H; linear regression with apical trunk length: slope = 13.0 ± 3.4 Ω cm per 100 μm, r = 0.574, F = 14.73, p = 0.0006, n = 32). Comparison of the average values of Ri estimated from caudal and rostral L5B pyramidal neurons revealed substantial differences (Figure 6K; caudal [apical trunk length <480 μm]: average Ri = 47.3 ± 4.1 Ω cm, n = 10; rostral [apical trunk length > 550 μm]: Ri = 88.6 ± 6.9 Ω cm, n = 18; t test, p < 0.0001). This gradient was not present when Ri was plotted against other relevant measures of morphology, suggesting a relationship specific to apical dendritic trunk length and therefore rostro-caudal position (linear regression of Ri: average apical dendrite diameter: r2 = 0.11, p = 0.06; total basal dendrite length: r2 = 0.02, p = 0.46; average tuft dendrite path length: r2 = 0.08, p = 0.13). We next sought to gauge the impact that intracellular resistivity has on the electrical architecture of rostral and caudal"

We report here that PCA models harboring conditional LSL/KrasG12D or BRAFF-V600E allele with prostate-specific abrogated p53 function recapitulate human PCA precursor lesions, histopathology, and clinical behaviors. We found that the development of reprogrammed EMT-like phenotypes and skeleton metastatic behavior requires concurrent activated Kras and p53 depletion in PCA. Microarray analyses of primary PCA cells derived from these models identified several cancer stemness genes including CD24, EpCAM, and CD133 upregulated by KRASG12D. Among these stemness markers, we identified CD24 as a key driver of tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo. These data demonstrate that specific factors involved in cancer stemness are critical for metastatic conversion of PCA and may be ideal targets for therapeutic intervention."

https://openalex.org/W2902559081,"In the context of generalized linear models (GLMs), interactions are automatically induced on the natural scale of the data. The conventional approach to measuring effects in GLMs based on significance testing (e.g. the Wald test or using deviance to assess model fit) is not always appropriate. The objective of this paper is to demonstrate the limitations of these conventional approaches and to explore alternative strategies for determining the importance of effects. The paper compares four approaches to determining the importance of effects in the GLM using 1) the Wald statistic, 2) change in deviance (model fitting criteria), 3) Bayesian GLM using vaguely informative priors and 4) Bayesian Model Averaging analysis. The main points in this paper are illustrated using an example study, which examines the risk factors for cyber abuse victimization, and are further examined using a simulation study. Analysis of our example dataset shows that, in terms of a logistic GLM, the conventional methods using the Wald test and the change in deviance can produce results that are difficult to interpret; Bayesian analysis of GLM is a suitable alternative, which is enhanced with prior knowledge about the direction of the effects; and Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) is especially suited for new areas of research, particularly in the absence of theory. We recommend that social scientists consider including BMA in their standard toolbox for analysis of GLMs."
https://openalex.org/W2902363783,"Tea plant (Camellia sinensis) accumulates abundant flavonoid glycosides that are the major bioactive ingredients in tea. Biosynthesis of flavonoid glycosides are catalyzed by UDP-glucosyltransferases (UGTs) that are widely present in plants. Among one hundred and seventy-eight UGTs genes that we have previously identified in tea plant, few of them have been functionally characterized. In the present study, we further identified UGT73A17 gene that is responsible for the biosynthesis of a broad range of flavonoid glycosides. Sequence analysis revealed that the deduced UGT73A17 protein showed high identity with 7-O-glycosyltransferases at amino acid level and it was clustered into the clade containing several 7-O-glycosyltransferases from other plant species. Enzymatic assays revealed that the recombinant UGT73A17 protein (rUGT73A17) exhibited activity toward flavonols (kaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin), flavones (apigenin, luteolin, and tricetin), flavanone (naringenin), isoflavones (genistein) and epicatechin gallate, yielding 7-O-glucosides as the major in vitro products. In particular, rUGT73A17 displayed higher activity at high temperatures (eg. 50°C) than at low temperatures, which was consistent with its relatively high expression level at high temperatures. Two amino acid substitutions at I296L and V466A improved the enzymatic activity of rUGT73A17. Our study demonstrated that UGT73A17 is responsible for the biosynthesis of a broad range of flavonoid glucosides, which is also involved in heat response and quality of tea plant."

Excluding seedling recruitments, changes in populations of grasses are basically a trade-off between natality and mortality of tillers. We hypothesised that the persistence pathway of perennial grasses is linked to their growth strategy, regardless whether they are growing as monoculture or as a mixture. Species with contrasting growth strategies (Arrhenatherum elatius L., Dactylis glomerata L., and Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) were cultivated as monocultures and as a mixture and their tiller natality and mortality were evaluated for two years after swards establishment. All pastures maintained their population size during the experimental period, although decreases in tiller densities occurred during the warmer season. Arrhenatherum elatius had the highest tiller mortality and natality whereas the F. arundinacea had the lowest ones. Arrhenatherum elatius had many tillers appearing in all seasons but their tillers were short-lived. Conversely, F. arundinacea and D. glomerata developed numerous tillers during autumn and winter and their tillers survived, on average, almost six and three times longer than those of A. elatius, respectively. There were no differences in tillering dynamics among populations grown in monocultures or in the mixture. Regardless of whether they were cultivated in monocultures or as a mixture, the persistence pathway of perennial grasses is linked with their growth strategies with exploitative species presenting a high tiller turnover throughout the year whereas the persistence of more conservative species is based on a high tiller survival."
https://openalex.org/W2901838830,"Overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is the cause of HER2-positive breast cancer (BC). Although HER2-inactivating therapies have benefited BC patients, development of resistance and disease recurrence have been the major clinical problems, pointing to a need for alternative therapeutic strategies. For that to happen, proteins that play critical roles in the biology of HER2-induced tumorigenesis have to be identified and characterized. Here, we show that the Src homology phosphotyrosyl phosphatase 2 (Shp2) encoded by the Ptpn11 gene is a requisite for ErbB2-induced tumorigenesis. We report that conditional knockout of Shp2 alleles in the ErbB2 BC model mice abrogates mammary tumorigenesis by blocking the expression of the ErbB2 transgene. We also show that inhibition of SHP2 encoded by the PTPN11 gene in the HER2-amplified BC cells induces a normal-like cellular phenotype and suppresses tumorigenesis and metastasis by blocking HER2 overexpression. These findings demonstrate that ErbB2-induced tumors in mice or xenograft tumors induced by transplantation of HER2-amplified BC cells are vulnerable to SHP2 inhibition since it abrogates the expression of the very oncogene that causes of the disease. This report paves the way for developing SHP2-targeting therapies for BC treatment in the future."

Here we developed a grading system called the periodontal pathogen index (PPI) by analyzing the copy numbers of multiple pathogens both in healthy and chronic periodontitis patients. We collected 170 mouthwash samples (64 periodontally healthy controls and 106 chronic periodontitis patients) and analyzed the salivary 16S rRNA levels of nine pathogens using multiplex, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Except for Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, copy numbers of all pathogens were significantly higher in chronic periodontitis patients. We classified the samples based on optimal cut-off values with maximum sensitivity and specificity from receiver operating characteristic curve analyses (AUC = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.87–0.96) into four categories of PPI: Healthy (1–40), Moderate (41–60), At Risk (61–80), and Severe (81–100). PPI scores were significantly higher in all chronic periodontitis patients than in the controls (odds ratio: 31.7, 95% CI: 13.41–61.61) and were associated with age, scaling as well as clinical characteristics including clinical attachment level and plaque index. Our PPI grading system can be clinically useful for the early assessment of pathogenic bacterial burden and follow-up monitoring after periodontitis treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2902964709,"Background A key barrier to appropriate treatment for malaria, diarrhoea, and pneumonia (MDP) in children under 5 years of age in low income rural settings is the lack of access to quality health care. The WHO and UNICEF have therefore called for the scale-up of integrated community case management (iCCM) using community health workers (CHWs). The current study assessed access to treatment, out-of-pocket expenditure and the quality of treatment provided in the public and private sectors compared to national guidelines, using data collected in a large representative survey of caregivers of children in 205 villages with iCCM-trained CHWs in mid-Western Uganda. Results The prevalence of suspected malaria, diarrhoea and suspected pneumonia in the preceding two weeks in 6501 children in the study sample were 45%, 11% and 24% respectively. Twenty percent of children were first taken to a CHW, 56% to a health facility, 14% to other providers and no care was sought for 11%. The CHW was more likely to provide appropriate treatment compared to any other provider or to those not seeking care for children with MDP (RR 1.51, 95% CI 1.42–1.61, p<0.001). Seeking care from a CHW had the lowest cost outlay (median $0.00, IQR $0.00-$1.80), whilst seeking care to a private doctor or clinic the highest (median $2.80, IQR $1.20-$6.00). We modelled the expected increase in overall treatment coverage if children currently treated in the private sector or not seeking care were taken to the CHW instead. In this scenario, coverage of appropriate treatment for MDP could increase in total from the current rate of 47% up to 64%. Conclusion Scale-up of iCCM-trained CHW programmes is key to the provision of affordable, high quality treatment for sick children, and can thus significantly contribute to closing the gap in coverage of appropriate treatment."

In particular, electroencephalographic (EEG) techniques allow researchers to explore high-temporal resolution of the neural activity that underlie the dynamics of cognitive processes. Although EEG research has been mostly applied in laboratory settings, recently a low-cost, portable EEG apparatus was released, which allows exploration of different emotional and cognitive processes during every-day activities. We compared a wide range of EEG measures using both a low-cost portable and a high-quality laboratory system. EEG recordings were done with both systems while participants performed an active task (Go/NoGo) and during their resting-state. Results showed similar waveforms in terms of morphology and amplitude of the ERPs, and comparable effects between conditions of the applied Go/NoGo paradigm. In addition, the contribution of each frequency to the entire EEG was not significantly different during resting-state, and fluctuations in amplitude of oscillations showed long-range temporal correlations. These results showed that low-cost, portable EEG technology can provide an alternative of enough quality for measuring brain activity outside a laboratory setting, which could contribute to the study of different populations in more ecological contexts."

To investigate how bilinguals monitor their speech errors and control their languages in use, we recorded event-related potentials (ERPs) in unbalanced Dutch-English bilingual speakers in a cued language-switching task. We tested the conflict-based monitoring model of Nozari and colleagues by investigating the error-related negativity (ERN) and comparing the effects of the two switching directions (i.e., to the first language, L1 vs. to the second language, L2). Results show that the speakers made more language selection errors when switching from their L2 to the L1 than vice versa. In the EEG, we observed a robust ERN effect following language selection errors compared to correct responses, reflecting monitoring of speech errors. Most interestingly, the ERN effect was enlarged when the speakers were switching to their L2 (less conflict) compared to switching to the L1 (more conflict). Our findings do not support the conflict-based monitoring model. We discuss an alternative account in terms of error prediction and reinforcement learning."
https://openalex.org/W2952333935,"West Nile Virus (WNV) has been detected annually in Maricopa County, Arizona, since 2003. With this in mind, we sought to determine if contemporary strains are endemic to the county or are annually imported. As part of this effort, we developed a new protocol for tiled amplicon sequencing of WNV to efficiently attain greater than 99% coverage of 14 WNV genomes collected directly from positive mosquito pools distributed throughout Maricopa County between 2014 and 2017. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses revealed that contemporary genomes fall within two major lineages; NA/WN02 and SW/WN03. We found that all of the Arizona strains possessed an amino acid substitution known to be under positive selection, which has arisen independently at least four times in Arizona. The SW/WN03 strains exhibited transient behavior, with at least 10 separate introductions into Arizona when considering both historical and contemporary strains. However, NA/WN02 strains are geographically differentiated and appear to be endemic in Arizona, with two clades that have been circulating for four and seven years. This establishment in Maricopa County provides the first evidence of local overwintering by a WNV strain over the course of several years in Arizona. Within a national context, the placement of eleven contemporary Arizona strains in the NA/WN02 lineage indicates while WNV first entered the northeastern United States in 1999, the most ancestral extant strains of WNV are now circulating in the American southwest."

Mechanisms of retinal angiogenesis, particularly the signaling pathways independent of VEGF, remain elusive. The goals of our study were to explore TLR4-mediated signaling pathways in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) and to examine the effects of TLR4 antagonists in models of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). Our results show that intravitreal injection of the TLR4 antagonist TAK-242 reduced areas of nonperfusion, inhibited aberrant angiogenesis, and improved vascular density in the retina of OIR mice. The effects were further potentiated by the anti-VEGF antibody ranibizumab. In cultured HRMECs, the TLR4 agonist LPS up-regulated TLR4/MAPKK kinase kinase 4 (MAP4K4) signaling, and promoted cell proliferation and migration, and reduced barrier functions of the cells. Down-regulation of MAP4K4 in HRMECs abolished the proangiogenic effects by LPS. Our data suggest that the TLR4–MAP4K4 pathway can regulate retinal neovascularization via mechanisms independent of VEGF.—Chen, W., Zhang, J., Zhang, P., Hu, F., Jiang, T., Gu, J., Chang, Q.

https://openalex.org/W2902797234,"Sample means comparisons are a fundamental and ubiquitous approach to interpreting experimental psychological data. Yet, we argue that the sample and effect sizes in published psychological research are frequently so small that sample means are insufficiently accurate to determine whether treatment effects have occurred. Generally, an estimator should be more accurate than any benchmark that systematically ignores information about the relations among experimental conditions. We consider two such benchmark estimators: one that randomizes the relations among conditions and another that always assumes no treatment effects. We show conditions under which these benchmark estimators estimate the true parameters more accurately than sample means. This perverse situation can occur even when effects are statistically significant at traditional levels. Our argument motivates the need for regularized estimates, such as those used in lasso, ridge, and hierarchical Bayes techniques."
https://openalex.org/W2902056349,"Introduction HIV prevention strategies often include outreach to female sex workers at social venues identified as places where people meet new sexual partners. Patrons and staff at these venues may include female sex workers, their clients, as well as others who have high rates of new sexual partnerships. Few studies have compared HIV/STI among venue-based and general populations, across types of venues, or by sub-group of the venue population. Program planners often assume that the prevalence of infection is highest among female sex workers and considerably lower among other people at these venues, but there are few empiric studies assessing the prevalence of infection by sex worker status and type of venue. Methods In 2011, we used the PLACE method to identify public venues where people meet new sexual partners across Jamaica. The study team visited all venues with reported sex work as well as a 10% random sample of other venues and subsequently interviewed and tested a probability sample of 991 venue patrons and workers for HIV and other STI. Results Community informants identified 1207 venues. All venues where sex work was reported (735 venues) and a random sample of the remainder (134 of 472) were selected for onsite visits. Of these, 585 were found and operational. At a stratified random sample of venues, survey teams interviewed and tested 717 women and 274 men. 394 women reported recent sex work and 211 of these women reported soliciting clients on the street. Women exchanging sex for money were more likely to be infected with HIV (5.4% vs 1.0%; OR = 5.6, 95% CI = 1.8,17.3) or syphilis (11.7% vs. 5.8%, OR = 2.2, 95% CI = 1.7,4,0) than other women, but not significantly more likely to be infected with gonorrhea (8.4% vs 7.8%; OR = 1.1,95% CI = 0.6,1.9), chlamydia (16.2% vs 21.6%;OR = 0.7,95% CI = 0.5,1.0) or trichomoniasis (23.0% vs 17.0%, OR = 1.5,95% CI = 0.9,2.2). Women at venues were more likely to report sex work and multiple partners than women interviewed in a 2008 national population-based household survey commissioned by the Ministry of Health. Conclusions In Jamaica, although the highest HIV prevalence was among street-based sex workers, the risk of HIV and STI extends to men and women at high risk venues, even those who do not self-identify as sex workers. Findings confirm the appropriateness of outreach to all men and women at these venues."
https://openalex.org/W2902551827,"Centrosomal proteins play critical roles in ciliogenesis. Mutations in many centrosomal proteins have been documented to contribute to developmental defects and cilium-related diseases. Centrosomal protein fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 oncogene partner–related protein of 20 kDa (FOR20) is crucial for ciliogenesis in mammalian cells and the unicellular eukaryote Paramecium; however, the biologic significance of FOR20 in vertebrate development remains unclear. We cloned the zebrafish homolog of the for20 gene and found that for20 mRNA is enriched in ciliated tissues during early zebrafish development. Knockdown of for20 by morpholino oligonucleotides in zebrafish results in multiple ciliary phenotypes, including curved body, hydrocephaly, pericardial edema, kidney cysts, and left-right asymmetry defects. for20 morphants show reduced number and length of cilia in Kupffer's vesicle and pronephric ducts. High-speed video microscopy reveals that cilia in most for20 morphants are consistently paralyzed or beat arrhythmically. To confirm the ciliary phenotypes of for20 morphants, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to disrupt for20 gene in zebrafish. for20 mutants exhibit multiple ciliary phenotypes resembling the defects in for20 morphants. All of these phenotypes in for20 morphants and mutants are significantly reversed by exogenous expression of for20 mRNA. Taken together, these data suggest that FOR20 is required for cilium-mediated processes during zebrafish embryogenesis.—Xie, S., Jin, J., Xu, Z., Huang, Y., Zhang, W., Zhao, L., Lo, L.

https://openalex.org/W2902603010,"The evolutionary dynamics of a finite population where resident individuals are replaced by mutant ones depends on its spatial structure. Usually, the population adopts the form of an undirected graph where the place occupied by each individual is represented by a vertex and it is bidirectionally linked to the places that can be occupied by its offspring. There are undirected graph structures that act as amplifiers of selection increasing the probability that the offspring of an advantageous mutant spreads through the graph reaching any vertex. But there also are undirected graph structures acting as suppressors of selection where this probability is less than that of the same individual placed in a homogeneous population. Here, firstly, we present the distribution of these evolutionary regimes for all undirected graphs with N ≤ 10 vertices. Some of them exhibit transitions between different regimes when the mutant fitness increases. In particular, as it has been already observed for small-order random graphs, we show that most graphs of order N ≤ 10 are amplifiers of selection. Secondly, we describe examples of amplifiers of order 7 that become suppressors from some critical value. In fact, for graphs of order N ≤ 7, we apply computer-aided techniques to symbolically compute their fixation probability and then their evolutionary regime, as well as the critical values for which they change their regime. Thirdly, the same technique is applied to some families of highly symmetrical graphs as a mean to explore methods of suppressing selection. The existence of suppression mechanisms that reverse an amplification regime when fitness increases could have a great interest in biology and network science. Finally, the analysis of all graphs from order 8 to order 10 reveals a complex and rich evolutionary dynamics, with multiple transitions between different regimes, which have not been examined in detail until now."
https://openalex.org/W2902618884,"Task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a widely-used tool for studying the neural processing correlates of human behavior in both healthy and clinical populations. There is growing interest in mapping individual differences in fMRI task behavior and neural responses. By utilizing neuroadaptive task designs accounting for such individual differences, task durations can be personalized to potentially optimize neuroimaging study outcomes (e.g., classification of task-related brain states). To test this hypothesis, we first retrospectively tracked the volume-by-volume changes of beta weights generated from general linear models (GLM) for 67 adult subjects performing a stop-signal task (SST). We then modeled the convergence of the volume-by-volume changes of beta weights according to their exponential decay (ED) in units of half-life. Our results showed significant differences in beta weight convergence estimates of optimal stopping times (OSTs) between go following successful stop trials and failed stop trials for both cocaine dependent (CD) and control group (Con), and between go following successful stop trials and go following failed stop trials for Con group. Further, we implemented support vector machine (SVM) classification for 67 CD/Con labeled subjects and compared the classification accuracies of fMRI-based features derived from (1) the full fMRI task versus (2) the fMRI task truncated to multiples of the unit of half-life. Among the computed binary classification accuracies, two types of task durations based on 2 half-lives significantly outperformed the accuracies using fully acquired trials, supporting this length as the OST for the SST. In conclusion, we demonstrate the potential of a neuroadaptive task design that can be widely applied to personalizing other task-based fMRI experiments in either dynamic real-time fMRI applications or within fMRI preprocessing pipelines."
https://openalex.org/W2902481512,"Perinatal asphyxia is a severe medical condition resulting from oxygen deficiency (hypoxia) at the time of birth, causing worldwide approximately 680,000 newborn deaths every year. Better prediction of severity of damages including early biomarkers is highly demanded. Elevated levels of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in blood have been reported for a range of different diseases and conditions, including cancer and prematurity. The objective of this study was to validate methods for assessing cfDNA in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and to explore temporal variations in a piglet model of neonatal hypoxia-reoxygenation. Different cfDNA extraction methods in combination with cfDNA detection systems were tested, including a fluorescent assay using SYBR Gold and a qRT-PCR-based technique. Newborn piglets (n = 55) were exposed to hypoxia-reoxygenation, hypoxia-reoxygenation and hypothermia, or were part of the sham-operated control group. Blood was sampled at baseline and at post-intervention, further at 30, 270, and 570 minutes after the end of hypoxia. Applying the fluorescent method, cfDNA concentration in piglets exposed to hypoxia (n = 32) increased from 36.8±27.6 ng/ml prior to hypoxia to a peak level of 61.5±54.9 ng/ml after the intervention and deceased to 32.3±19.1 ng/ml at 570 minutes of reoxygenation, whereas the group of sham-operated control animals (n = 11) revealed a balanced cfDNA profile. Animals exposed to hypoxia and additionally treated with hypothermia (n = 12) expressed a cfDNA concentration of 54.4±16.9 ng/ml at baseline, 39.2±26.9 ng/ml at the end of hypoxia, and of 41.1±34.2 ng/ml at 570 minutes post-intervention. Concentrations of cfDNA in the CSF of piglets exposed to hypoxia revealed at post-intervention higher levels in comparison to the controls. However, these observations were only tendencies and not significant. In a first methodological proof-of-principle study exploring cfDNA using a piglet model of hypoxia-reoxygenation variations in the temporal patterns suggest that cfDNA might be an early indicator for damages caused by perinatal asphyxia."
https://openalex.org/W2902208936,"The exponential growth of mobile traffic means that operators must upgrade their mobile networks to provide higher capacity to final users. A promising alternative is to deploy heterogeneous networks (HetNets) that combine macro Base Stations (BSs) and SmallCells (SCs), although this increases the complexity and cost of the transport (SCs to Fiber Access Point-FAP). Most of the planning strategies outlined in the literature are aimed at reducing the number of SCs and ignore the impact that the transport segment might have on the total cost of network deployment. In this paper, heuristics are used for the joint planning of radio (i.e., SCs) and transport resources (i.e., point-to-point fiber links). These were compared and examined to determine the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, and in some cases, this led to a 50% reduction in total costs, while still creating a non-scalable network."
https://openalex.org/W2903146490,"Nicking endonucleases (NEases) selectively cleave single DNA strands in double-stranded DNAs at a specific site. They are widely used in bioanalytical applications and in genome editing; however, the peculiarities of DNA-protein interactions for most of them are still poorly studied. Previously, it has been shown that the large subunit of heterodimeric restriction endonuclease BspD6I (Nt.BstD6I) acts as a NEase. Here we present a study of interaction of restriction endonuclease BspD6I with modified DNA containing single non-nucleotide insertion with an azobenzene moiety in the enzyme cleavage sites or in positions of sugar-phosphate backbone nearby. According to these data, we designed a number of effective stimulus-responsive oligonucleotide inhibitors bearing azobenzene or triethylene glycol residues. These modified oligonucleotides modulated the functional activity of Nt.BspD6I after cooling or heating. We were able to block the cleavage of T7 phage DNA by this enzyme in the presence of such inhibitors at 20-25°C, whereas the Nt.BspD6I ability to hydrolyze DNA was completely restored after heating to 45°C. The observed effects can serve as a basis for the development of a platform for regulation of NEase activity in vitro or in vivo by external signals."
https://openalex.org/W2902629570,"Cystectomy is the removal of all or part of the urinary bladder. It has been observed that there is significant regrowth of the bladder after partial cystectomy and this has been proposed to be through regeneration of the organ. Regrowth of tissue in mammals has been proposed to involve compensatory mechanisms that share many characteristics of true regeneration, like the growth of specialized structures such as blood vessels or nerves. However, the overall structure of the normal organ is not achieved. Here we tested if bladder growth after subtotal cystectomy (STC, removal of 50% of the bladder) was compensatory or regenerative. To do this we subjected adult female mouse bladders to STC and assessed regrowth using several established cellular parameters including histological, gene expression, cytokine accumulation and cell proliferation studies. Bladder function was analyzed using cystometry and the voiding stain on paper (VSOP) technique. We found that STC bladders were able to increase their ability to hold urine with the majority of volume restoration occurring within the first two weeks. Regenerating bladders had thinner walls with less mean muscle thickness, and they showed increased collagen deposition at the incision as well as throughout the bladder wall suggesting that fibrosis was occurring. Cell populations differed in their response to injury with urothelial regeneration complete by day 7, but stromal and detrusor muscle still incomplete after 8wks. Cells incorporated EdU when administered at the time of surgery and tracing of EdU positive cells over time indicated that many newborn cells originate at the incision and move mediolaterally. Basal urothelial cells and bladder mesenchymal stem cells but not smooth muscle cells significantly incorporated EdU after STC. Since anti-inflammatory cytokines play a role in regeneration, we analyzed expressed cytokines and found that no anti-inflammatory cytokines were present in the bladder 1wk after STC. Our findings suggest that bladder regrowth after cystectomy is compensatory and functions to increase the volume that the bladder can hold. This finding sets the stage for understanding how the bladder responds to cystectomy and how this can be improved in patients after suffering bladder injury."
https://openalex.org/W2950377945,"While reward associative learning has been studied extensively across different species, punishment avoidance learning has received far less attention. Of particular interest is how the two types of learning change perceptual processing of the learned stimuli. We designed a task that required participants to learn the association of emotionally neutral images with reward, punishment, and no incentive value outcomes through trial-and-error. During learning, participants received monetary reward, neutral outcomes or avoided punishment by correctly identifying corresponding images. Results showed an early bias in favor of learning reward associations, in the form of higher accuracy and fewer trials needed to reach learning criterion. We subsequently assessed electrophysiological learning effects with a task in which participants viewed the stimuli with no feedback or reinforcement. Critically, we found modulation of two early event-related potential components for reward images: the frontocentral P2 (170–230 ms) and the anterior N2/Early Anterior Positivity (N2/EAP; 210–310 ms). We suggest that reward associations may change stimuli detection and incentive salience as indexed by P2 and N2/EAP. We also reported, on an exploratory basis, a late negativity with frontopolar distribution enhanced by punishment images."
https://openalex.org/W2284771836,"Methods of estimating the local false discovery rate (LFDR) have been applied to different types of datasets such as high-throughput biological data, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and genome-wide association (GWA) studies. We present a model for LFDR estimation that incorporates a covariate into each test. Incorporating the covariates may improve the performance of testing procedures, because it contains additional information based on the biological context of the corresponding test. This method provides different estimates depending on a tuning parameter. We estimate the optimal value of that parameter by choosing the one that minimizes the estimated LFDR resulting from the bias and variance in a bootstrap approach. This estimation method is called an adaptive reference class (ARC) method. In this study, we consider the performance of ARC method under certain assumptions on the prior probability of each hypothesis test as a function of the covariate. We prove that, under these assumptions, the ARC method has a mean squared error asymptotically no greater than that of the other method where the entire set of hypotheses is used and assuming a large covariate effect. In addition, we conduct a simulation study to evaluate the performance of estimator associated with the ARC method for a finite number of hypotheses. Here, we apply the proposed method to coronary artery disease (CAD) data taken from a GWA study and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data."
https://openalex.org/W2902283026,"Due to the complexity of large production systems, maintenance events are diverse, simultaneous and dynamic. Appropriate maintenance management of complex large production systems can guarantee high availability and save maintenance costs. However, current maintenance decision-making methods mainly focus on the maintenance events of single-components and series connection multi-components; little research pays attention to the combination maintenance of different maintenance events. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-event combination maintenance model based on event correlation. First, the maintenance downtime and cost of three types of maintenance events under different maintenance beginning times and degrees are analysed. Then, shared maintenance downtime and cost models are established by maintenance event correlations. In addition, a multi-event combination maintenance model is constructed to achieve the goal of the highest availability and the lowest cost rate in both the decision-making cycle and the remaining life. Moreover, a particle swarm optimization algorithm based on interval segmentation for model solving is designed. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the model."

I was attending my first group meeting in the lab where I had just started as a postdoc, and I was pleased that I had managed to follow most of the discussion. Then, in front of everyone, my supervisor turned to me and asked about my previous accomplishments. I froze. As a Ph.D. student, I had achieved lots to be proud of. But all of that was in my home country of Brazil. Now I was in Washington, D.C.—and I didn't know what the word “accomplishment” meant. When I looked it up later in my English-Portuguese dictionary, I realized what I should have said: presenting my research at international conferences, publishing, teaching, and more. But at the time, all I could utter in response was “I don't know.”

> “Could I only be successful in my own country?” 

I had decided to do a postdoc abroad because I thought the training would help me secure a faculty position. I applied for and received a Brazilian government fellowship to spend 18 months working abroad. A professor I had met at a conference agreed to give me a position in his lab. It all seemed so easy—until I actually started.

In a new lab and a new country, I struggled. After the mortifying lab meeting incident, my confidence took another hit when some of my experiments and analyses didn't work. The paper I intended to publish did not materialize. I used to be invited to give talks; now, I was asked to speak more slowly because of my accent. My confidence was shattered. Could I only be successful in my own country?

After months of self-doubt, I reminded myself that I had potential. I needed to do something to regain my lost confidence.

I saw that many of the Latin American scientists I had connected with were thriving at large institutions that had more resources to support training and development. Although I liked my lab and had a good relationship with my supervisor, my institution didn't offer enough of these opportunities. I thought a change of environment might be what I needed.

I contacted a principal investigator at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). He said that, if my current supervisor approved, I could join his lab for a 6-month trial period, which would take me to the end of my fellowship. My original supervisor agreed that changing institutions would be best for me, and I made the move.

Once again in an unfamiliar environment, I still felt insecure. I was certain that my new supervisor didn't actually think I was good. I thought he was just being generous and giving me a chance to get some training. I doubted that he would renew my contract when it expired. Nonetheless, I was determined to make the most of the time I had.

I started to see the benefits of my new environment surprisingly quickly. There were more opportunities to interact with others—for example, in meetings, in the hallways, and in chats with administrative staff—which forced me to talk more. It was intimidating at first, but with practice I began to feel more confident in my English. The many training programs that NIH offers—covering topics such as leadership and writing as well as cutting-edge science—helped, too. I proposed new projects and collaborations, including one with my original supervisor. I began to receive positive feedback on my presentations. My accent is still the same, so I assume that this is due to my restored confidence.

I've now been in the lab for a little more than 2 years, and I'm so proud of how far I've come. I've presented my research at international conferences, sometimes winning travel awards to attend them. I review and edit manuscripts for journals, and I've published my own papers. My confidence is back. I feel a little bit like Wonder Woman. She was a strong warrior in her homeland. When she left, she experienced obstacles and failures—only to become even stronger than before.
