https://openalex.org/W2066949311,"Nitric oxide is a free radical that has been recently recognized as a neural messenger molecule. Nitric oxide synthase has now been purified and molecularly cloned from brain. Using specific antibodies and oligonucleotide probes, we have localized brain nitric oxide synthase to discrete neuronal populations in the rat and primate brain. Nitric oxide synthase is exclusively neuronal, and its localization is absolutely coincident with NADPH diaphorase staining in both rat and primate."
https://openalex.org/W2129488948,"The neurotransmitter serotonin (5HT) activates a variety of second messenger signaling systems and through them indirectly regulates the function of ion channels. Serotonin also activates ion channels directly, suggesting that it may also mediate rapid, excitatory responses. A complementary DNA clone containing the coding sequence of one of these rapidly responding channels, a 5HT3 subtype of the serotonin receptor, has been isolated by screening a neuroblastoma expression library for functional expression of serotonin-gated currents in Xenopus oocytes. The predicted protein product has many of the features shared by other members of the ligand-gated ion channel family. The pharmacological and electrophysiological characteristics of the cloned receptor are largely consistent with the properties of native 5HT3 receptors. Messenger RNA encoding this receptor is found in the brain, spinal cord, and heart. This receptor defines a new class of excitatory ligand-gated channels."
https://openalex.org/W2059289753,"Movement of neutrophils from the bloodstream to inflamed tissue depends on the activation of both the neutrophil and the endothelial cell. Endothelial cells lining the postcapillary venule respond to proinflammatory mediators by expressing adhesion molecules and synthesizing a variety of neutrophil-activating factors. Endothelial cell production of a 77-amino acid variant of interleukin-8 (IL-8) was found to be a requirement for the invasion of neutrophils through a vessel wall model. IL-8 secreted by cytokine- or lipopolysaccharide-stimulated endothelial cells induced the rapid shedding of neutrophil lectin adhesion molecule-1, the up-regulation of leukocyte beta 2 integrins, and the attachment and transmigration of the neutrophils. Thus, endogenous endothelial IL-8 regulates transvenular traffic during acute inflammatory responses."
https://openalex.org/W1600508667,A 39-kDa protein of unknown function has previously been reported to copurify with the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP)/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor. In this study we demonstrate that a recombinant 39-kDa fusion protein can reversibly bind to the 515-kDa subunit of the LRP/alpha 2-macroglobulin receptor. This interaction inhibits the binding and uptake of the receptor's two known ligands: 1) beta-migrating very low density lipoproteins activated by enrichment with apoprotein E and 2) alpha 2-macroglobulin activated by incubation with plasma proteases or methylamine. A potential in vivo role of the 39-kDa protein is to modulate the uptake of apoE-enriched lipoproteins and activated alpha 2-macroglobulin in hepatic and extrahepatic tissues.
https://openalex.org/W2047930213,"The CFTR Cl− channel contains two predicted nucleotide-binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2); therefore, we examined the effect of ATP on channel activity. Once phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), channels required cytosolic ATP to open. Activation occurred by a PKA-independent mechanism. ATPγS substituted for ATP in PKA phosphorylation, but it did not open the channel. Several hydrolyzable nucleotides (ATP > GTP > ITP ≈ UTP > CTP) reversibly activated phosphorylated channels, but nonhydrolyzable analogs and Mg2+-free ATP did not. Studies of CFTR mutants indicated that ATP controls channel activity independent of the R domain and suggested that hydrolysis of ATP by NBD1 may be sufficient for channel opening. The finding that nucleoside triphosphates regulate CFTR begins to explain why CF-associated mutations in the NBDs block Cl− channel function."
https://openalex.org/W1999485774,"The relation between chromatin structure and transcriptional activity was examined by in vitro transcription analysis of chromatin reconstituted in the absence or presence of histone H1. To maintain well-defined template DNA, purified components were used in the reconstitution of chromatin. Reconstitution of nucleosomal cores to an average density of 1 nucleosome per 200 base pairs of DNA resulted in a mild reduction of basal RNA polymerase II transcription to 25 to 50 percent of that obtained with naked DNA templates. This nucleosome-mediated repression was due to nucleosomal cores located at the RNA start site and could not be counteracted by the sequence-specific transcription activators Sp1 and GAL4-VP16. When H1 was incorporated into the chromatin at 0.5 to 1.0 molecule per nucleosome (200 base pairs of DNA), RNA synthesis was reduced to 1 to 4 percent of that observed with chromatin containing only nucleosomal cores, and this H1-mediated repression could be counteracted by the addition of Sp1 or GAL4-VP16 (antirepression). With naked DNA templates, transcription was increased by a factor of 3 and 8 by Sp1 and GAL4-VP-16, respectively (true activation). With H1-repressed chromatin templates, however, the magnitude of transcriptional activation mediated by Sp1 and GAL4-VP16 was 90 and more than 200 times higher, respectively, because of the combined effects of true activation and antirepression. The data provide direct biochemical evidence that support and clarify previously proposed models in which there is depletion or reconfiguration of nucleosomal cores and histone H1 at the promoter regions of active genes."
https://openalex.org/W1564441910,"To estimate the polyamine distribution in bovine lymphocytes and rat liver, the binding constants (K) for DNA, RNA, phospholipid, and ATP were determined under the conditions of 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mM Mg2+, and 150 mM K+. The binding constants of spermine for calf thymus DNA, Escherichia coli 16 S rRNA, phospholipid in rat liver microsomes and ATP were 1.15 x 10(2), 6.69 x 10(2), 2.22 x 10(2), and 5.95 x 10(2) M-1, respectively. From these binding constants and experimentally determined cellular concentrations of macromolecules, ATP, and polyamines, spermine distribution in the cells was estimated. In bovine lymphocytes, the mols of spermine bound to DNA, RNA, phospholipid, and ATP were 0.79, 3.7, 0.23, and 4.3 per 100 mol of phosphate of macromolecules or ATP, respectively. In rat liver, they were 0.19, 1.0, 0.05, and 0.97/100 mol of phosphate of macromolecules or ATP, respectively. The binding constants of spermidine for macromolecules and ATP were smaller than those of spermine, but a similar tendency was observed with spermidine distribution among macromolecules and ATP in the above two cells. The amount of polyamine bound to DNA and phospholipid was significantly lower than that to RNA. When either the Mg2+ or K+ concentration increased, the amount of free spermine and that bound to RNA and ATP increased, but the amount of spermine bound to DNA and phospholipid decreased. The results indicate that most polyamines exist as a polyamine-RNA complex in cells. Under the conditions that globin synthesis is stimulated by spermine in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system, the amount of spermine bound to RNA was very close to the value estimated in the cells."
https://openalex.org/W1535671294,"The receptor for hepatocyte growth factor, also known as scatter factor (HGF/SF), has recently been identified as the 190-kDa heterodimeric tyrosine kinase encoded by the MET proto-oncogene (p190MET). The signaling pathway(s) triggered by HGF/SF are unknown. In A549 cells, a lung epithelial cell line, nanomolar concentrations of HGF/SF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the p190MET receptor. The autophosphorylated receptor coprecipitated with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) activity. In GTL16 cells, a cell line derived from a gastric carcinoma, the p190MET receptor, overexpressed and constitutively phosphorylated on tyrosine, coprecipitated with PI 3-kinase activity and with the 85-kDa PI 3-kinase subunit. In these cells activation of protein kinase C or the increase of intracellular [Ca2+] inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of the p190MET receptor as well as the association with both PI 3-kinase activity and the 85-kDa subunit of the enzyme. In an in vitro assay, tyrosine phosphorylation of the immobilized p190MET receptor was required for binding of PI 3-kinase from cell lysates. These data strongly suggest that the signaling pathway activated by the HGF/SF receptor includes generation of D-3-phosphorylated inositol phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W2043761376,"The CD19-CR2 complex of B lymphocytes contains proteins that participate in two host-defense systems, the immune and complement systems. The ligand for the subunit of the immune system, CD19, is not known, but the complement receptor subunit, CR2 (CD21), binds activation fragments of the C3 component of the complement system and may mediate immunopotentiating effects of complement. A recombinant, soluble CR2 was prepared by fusing the C3-binding region of the receptor to immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). The (CR2)2-IgG1 chimera competed with cellular CR2 for C3 binding and suppressed the antibody response to a T cell-dependent antigen when administered to mice at the time of immunization. This inhibitory effect of (CR2)2-IgG1 demonstrates the B cell-activating function of the CD19-CR2 complex and suggests a new method for humoral immunosuppression."
https://openalex.org/W2007282352,"The spectrum of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates neutralized by antibodies from HIV-1-infected humans is broader than the spectrum of isolates neutralized by sera from animals immunized with purified gp120 subunits. This broader neutralization was due, in part, to the presence of antibodies to conserved gp120 conformational epitopes. Purified conformation-dependent gp120-specific human antibodies neutralized a wider range of virus isolates than human antibodies directed to linear determinants in gp120 and were also responsible for the majority of the gp120-specific CD4-blocking activity of HIV-1-infected human sera. A gp120 subunit vaccine that effectively presents these conformation-dependent neutralization epitopes should protect against a broader range of HIV-1 variants than a vaccine that presents exclusively linear determinants."
https://openalex.org/W2164181371,"High threshold L-type Ca2+ channels of skeletal muscle are thought to consist of a complex of alpha 1, alpha 2 delta, beta, and gamma subunits. Expression of the cloned alpha 1 subunit from skeletal and cardiac muscle has established that this protein is the dihydropyridine-sensitive ion-conducting subunit. However, the kinetics of the skeletal muscle alpha 1 alone expressed in mouse L-cells were abnormally slow and were accelerated to within the normal range by coexpression with the skeletal muscle beta subunit. The kinetics of cardiac muscle alpha 1 were also slowed but to a lesser extent and were not altered by coexpression with skeletal muscle alpha 2. We show here that coexpression of the skeletal muscle beta subunit with the cardiac alpha 1 subunit in Xenopus laevis oocytes produced: 1) an increase in the peak voltage-sensitive current, 2) a shift of the peak current-voltage relationship to more hyperpolarized potentials, and 3) an increase in the rate of activation. Coexpression of the skeletal muscle gamma subunit did not have a significant effect on currents elicited by alpha 1. However, when gamma was coexpressed with beta and alpha 1, both peak currents and rates of activation at more negative potentials were increased. These results indicate that rather than simply amplifying expression of alpha 1, heterologous skeletal muscle beta and gamma subunits can modulate the biophysical properties of cardiac alpha 1."
https://openalex.org/W1571547690,"In the present work, a method based on an epitope-tagged ubiquitin derivative is described that allows for the unambiguous detection of ubiquitin-protein conjugates formed in vivo or in vitro. Expression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae of ubiquitin that has been tagged at its amino terminus with a peptide epitope results in the formation of tagged ubiquitin-protein conjugates that are detectable by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes the tag. The expression of tagged ubiquitin has no adverse effect on vegetative growth and, moreover, can suppress the stress-hypersensitive phenotype of yeast lacking the polyubiquitin gene UBI4. We also show that tagged ubiquitin is correctly conjugated in vivo and in vitro to a short-lived test protein and can be covalently extended into the multimeric ubiquitin chain that is normally required for the degradation of this protein. Surprisingly, however, conjugation of tagged ubiquitin inhibits proteolysis. These and related results suggest that the amino-terminal region of ubiquitin is important in protease-substrate recognition and that the multiubiquitin chain is a dynamic transient structure. The potential of tagged ubiquitin for the identification and isolation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates and ubiquitin-related enzymes, and as a tool in mechanistic studies is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1583308104,"Treatment of rat hepatoma H-35 cells with purified human recombinant interleukin-11 (IL-11) resulted in the stimulated production of several major acute phase plasma proteins. The qualitative and quantitative changes were comparable to those mediated by IL-6 or leukemia inhibitor factor (LIF). Like IL-6, IL-11 acted synergistically with IL-1 on type 1 acute phase proteins. The combination of IL-11 and dexamethasone yielded a magnitude of stimulation which was more similar to the combination of LIF and dexamethasone than IL-6 and dexamethasone. IL-11 elicited in treatment of primary cultures of rat hepatocytes a qualitative change of plasma protein production which was similar to that in H-35 cells. Comparison of rat and human hepatoma cells indicated that the IL-11 response did not correlate with that of IL-6 or LIF, suggesting that the action of IL-11 was mediated by an IL-11-specific receptor system. However, the intracellular transduction of the IL-11, IL-6, and LIF signals to the acute phase protein genes seems to rely, in part, on common elements as judged from their stimulatory effects on the transfected expression vector containing the IL-6 response element of the rat beta-fibrinogen gene. The finding that IL-11 shares liver-regulating properties with IL-6 and LIF suggests that IL-11 has the potential of contributing to the control of systemic homeostasis and hepatic acute phase response."

https://openalex.org/W1515457450,"The Nb2 cell line is a pre-T rat lymphoma that is dependent on prolactin (PRL) for mitogenesis. Two forms of PRL receptor (PRL-R), which differ in the length of their cytoplasmic domains have been identified in different tissues and species. In the present study we have cloned the cDNA and characterized the mitogenic form of PRL-R in Nb2 cells. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of first strand cDNA prepared from Nb2-11C (PRL-dependent) and Nb2-Sp (PRL-independent) cell lines was performed using oligonucleotide primers specific for the binding domain, the short form of the PRL-R, and the cytoplasmic domain of the long form of the PRL-R. These studies indicate that both cell lines express a novel form of PRL-R. A cDNA was isolated from an Nb2-Sp cDNA library, which contains 1446 base pairs identical to the nucleotide sequence of the long form of the rat PRL-R. However, the cDNA sequence is missing 594 base pairs in the cytoplasmic domain compared with the long form of the PRL-R. The cDNA encodes a protein of 393 amino acids, lacking 198 amino acids in the cytoplasmic domain. Scatchard analysis of 125I-labeled ovine prolactin (oPRL) binding to microsomes prepared from transiently transfected COS-7 cells with either PRL-R long form cDNA or Nb2 PRL-R cDNA indicates that the long form of PRL-R binds oPRL with high affinity (K alpha = 8.8 x 10(9) M-1), while the Nb2 PRL-R showed a 3.3-fold increased affinity for PRL (K alpha = 29.1 x 10(9) M-1). In addition, immunoblot analysis of these microsomes using 125I-labeled monoclonal antibody (U6) to the PRL-R demonstrates a Mr of approximately 82,000 for the long form and approximately 62,000 for the Nb2 form of PRL-R. Polymerase chain reaction amplification of genomic DNA prepared from PRL-dependent and -independent cell lines suggests that this form of PRL-R results from a deletion in the PRL-R gene. The identification of a modified long form of PRL-R in the Nb2 cell line should help localize domains of the PRL-R involved in signal transduction and further the investigation of prolactin's role in immune cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2007632540,"N-methy-d-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA receptors play a key role in synaptic transmission and plasticity in the vertebrate central nervous system. Previous studies have suggested that although both receptor types are present at synapses, the NMDA receptors may be relatively uniformly distributed. We have combined iontophoretic mapping of NMDA and non-NMDA receptors with immunohistochemical localization of synaptic vesicles along dendrites of single neocortical neurons to determine the relationship between NMDA and non-NMDA receptor distribution and the location of synapses. We find that when corrections for glutamate diffusion are made, NMDA responses are concentrated at focal “hot spots” that coincide with non-NMDA hot spots and that there is an excellent correlation between these hot spots and synapses."
https://openalex.org/W2428242608,"Nerve growth factor (NGF) transcripts were identified in normal human keratinocytes in primary and secondary culture. The expression of the NGF mRNA was strongly down-regulated by corticosteroids and was maximal when keratinocytes were in the exponential phase of growth. Immunofluorescence studies on growing keratinocytes colonies and on elutriated keratinocytes obtained from growing colonies and mature stratified epithelium showed specific staining of the Golgi apparatus only in basal keratinocytes in the exponential phase of growth. The keratinocyte-derived NGF was secreted in a biologically active form as assessed by neurite induction in sensory neurons obtained from chick embryo dorsal root ganglia. Based on these data we suggest that the basal keratinocyte is the cell synthesizing and secreting NGF in the human adult epidermis. The paracrine secretion of NGF by keratinocytes might have a major role in regulating innervation, lymphocyte function, and melanocyte growth and differentiation in epidermal morphogenesis as well as during wound healing."
https://openalex.org/W1643469489,"In previous studies, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell genomic DNA transfectants that expressed a human alpha(1,3)-fucosyltransferase (alpha(1,3)Fuc-T) gene were isolated and shown to possess a common approximately 7.5-kilobase (kb) EcoRI fragment that hybridized to an Alu probe (Potvin, B., Kumar, R., Howard, D. R., and Stanley, P. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 1615-1622). One of these transfectants was used to make a genomic DNA library in lambda ZAP-II from EcoRI-digested, size-selected (6-8 kb) DNA, and plaques that hybridized to an Alu probe were purified. After in vivo excision, two plasmids with DNA inserts greater than or equal to 6 kb were obtained and one of these (D2.1) conferred human alpha(1,3)-Fuc-T activity on CHO transfectants. A partial restriction map of this clone revealed an approximately 3.6-kb PstI fragment that contained an Alu sequence. This fragment was subcloned into pGEM-3Zf(+) and compared by restriction analyses with a previously described approximately 3.6-kb PstI DNA fragment isolated from a human peripheral blood lymphocyte library and shown to encode an alpha(1,3)-Fuc-T gene (Lowe, J. B., Stoolman, L. M., Nair, R. P., Larsen, R. D., Berhend, T. L., and Marks, R. M. (1990) Cell 63, 475-484). Both approximately 3.6-kb fragments gave identical restriction patterns. In addition, they both caused CHO transfectants to synthesize the Lex determinant Gal beta(1,4)[Fuc alpha(1,3)]GlcNAc beta 1 but not the alpha(2,3)-sialyl-Lex determinant. As expected, these transfectants did not bind to ELAM-1 on activated endothelial cells, since sialyl-Lex is a carbohydrate ligand recognized by ELAM-1. Surprisingly, however, an open reading frame encoded within the approximately 3.6-kb PstI fragment had a sequence identical to that of ELFT, an alpha(1,3)-Fuc-T previously reported to confer ELAM-1 binding on a previously reported to confer ELAM-1 binding on a CHO transfectant (Goelz, S. E., Hession, C., Goff, D., Griffiths, B., Tizard, R., Newman, B., Chi-Rosso, G., and Lobb, R., (1990) Cell 63, 1349-1356). Possible explanations for these apparently disparate results are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1512985914,"Antimicrobial peptides are widely distributed in nature and appear to play a role in the host defense of plants and animals. In this study we report the existence of antimicrobial peptides in the stomach of the vertebrate Xenopus laevis, an animal previously shown to store high concentrations of antimicrobial peptides in its skin. Antimicrobial activity was detected in extracts of X. laevis stomach tissue and nine antimicrobial peptides were then purified. A novel 24-amino acid peptide, designated PGQ, was isolated from these extracts, and has the following amino acid sequence: GVLSNVIGYLKKLGTGALNAVLKQ. PGQ is relatively basic and has the potential to form an amphipathic alpha-helix. The other peptides isolated are members of the magainin family of antimicrobial peptides, and include magainins I and II, PGLa, xenopsin precursor fragment, and four caerulein precursor fragments. None of these peptides had been previously identified in tissues other than the skin. The purification of the peptides from stomach extracts and subsequent protein sequence analysis reveals that the peptides have undergone the same processing as their dermal counterparts, and that they are stored in their processed forms. Northern blot analysis indicates that the magainin family of peptides are synthesized in the stomach, and immunohistochemical studies demonstrate that magainin is stored in a novel granular multinucleated cell in the gastric mucosa of Xenopus. This study demonstrates that the magainin family of antimicrobial peptides is found in the gastrointestinal system of X. laevis and offers an opportunity to further define the physiological role of these defense peptides."
https://openalex.org/W1549835226,"Two mucin-type glycoproteins detected by the monoclonal antibody C50, which reacts with the carcinoma-associated sialyl-Lewis a and sialyl-lactotetraose epitopes, were found in secreted and solubilized materials from the colon carcinoma cell line COLO 205. The larger glycoprotein (H-CanAg; heavy cancer antigen) was predominantly found in extracts of cells grown in vitro or as nude mice xenografts whereas the smaller species (L-CanAg; light cancer antigen) was the major component in spent culture medium and serum from grafted mice. Using detergent in the extraction buffer doubled the yield of H-CanAg, suggesting that this glycoprotein is membrane bound whereas the yield of L-CanAg was relatively unaffected. The two glycoproteins were purified from xenograft extracts and spent culture medium using perchloric acid precipitation, monoclonal antibody affinity purification, ion exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. Both glycoproteins were unaffected by reduction and alkylation in guanidine HCl. Using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, relative molecular masses were estimated to be 600-800 kDa for H-CanAg and 150-300 kDa for L-CanAg. Carbohydrate analysis revealed that the CanAg glycoproteins were highly glycosylated (81-89% carbohydrate by weight), carrying carbohydrate chains with average lengths of 13-18 sugars which were rich in fucose and sialic acid (2-3 residues/chain for each sugar). L-CanAg isolated from spent medium was glycosylated to a higher degree than its counterpart from xenograft extract. Immunochemical studies of the intact glycoproteins showed that both H-CanAg and L-CanAg expressed the monoclonal antibody-defined, sialic acid-containing carbohydrate epitopes CA203 and CA242 as well as the Lewis a blood group antigen whereas only H-CanAg appeared to carry the sialyl-Lewis x epitope. The amino acid compositions were typical of mucins, containing high amounts of serine, threonine (more than 25% together), and proline (11-18%). Significant differences in amino acid composition between H-CanAg and L-CanAg were found. A rabbit antiserum against the cytoplasmic C-terminal part of the MUC1 gene product, core protein of the carcinoma-associated polymorphic epithelial mucin (PEM) and DU-PAN-2, reacted with H-CanAg. After deglycosylation with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, H-CanAg but not L-CanAg was recognized by the monoclonal antibodies SM-3 and HMFG-2, directed to the tandem repeat of the PEM apoprotein. However, these antibodies which react with PEM from mammary carcinomas without prior deglycosylation were unable to recognize intact H-CanAg, probably as a consequence of a more extensive glycosylation of this glycoprotein.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1603516579,"The molecular properties and orientation of the cGMP-gated cation channel of bovine rod outer segment membranes were studied using biochemical and immunochemical methods. Western blots labeled with anti-channel monoclonal antibodies indicate that the channel has a subunit Mr of 63,000 in bovine rod outer segment membranes prepared in the presence and absence of protease inhibitors and in rod outer segments from other mammalian retinas. The channel has an apparent Mr of 78,000 in both COS-1 cells and Xenopus oocytes expressing the cloned cDNA. NH2-terminal sequence analysis indicates that the lower Mr of the channel in rod outer segments is caused by the absence of the first 92 amino acids predicted by cDNA sequence analysis. Immunofluorescent and immunogold labeling has confirmed that the 63,000 form of the channel is present in rod outer segments. These results indicate that photoreceptor cell-specific co-translational or post-translational cleavage of the NH2-terminal segment of the channel occurs prior or during the incorporation of the channel into the rod outer segment plasma membrane. Immunogold labeling studies using site-directed antibodies also indicate that the NH2-terminal segment of the rod outer segment channel is exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane."

https://openalex.org/W1594038744,"Cell adhesion is characterized by an integrin-mediated ligand binding event followed by reorganization of the actin-cytoskeleton leading to cell spreading and/or migration. In this report we examine the role of integrin alpha v beta 3 in mediating cell attachment to vitronectin or a RGD-containing peptide in the presence of cytochalasin B to prevent actin polymerization. Under these conditions cell attachment to a RGD-containing peptide can be dissociated by excess soluble ligand whereas cells attached to vitronectin cannot. These results suggest that alpha v beta 3-mediated cell attachment to vitronectin results in a highly stabilized interaction that is independent of the actin-cytoskeleton. To investigate the molecular nature of this interaction alpha v beta 3 was purified to homogeneity, and its binding properties toward various ligands were measured in a solid-phase receptor assay. The data indicate that alpha v beta 3 binds to vitronectin or fibronectin in a nondissociable manner whereas a RGD-containing peptide derived from vitronectin binds specifically but is completely dissociable with a Kd of 9.4 x 10(-7) M. Moreover, chemical modification of alpha v beta 3 with limited glutaraldehyde treatment allowed vitronectin to bind in a RGD-dependent and dissociable manner, suggesting that receptor conformational changes or specific amino acid residues proximal to the ligand binding site(s) are involved in the stabilization event. Thus, in the absence of cytoskeletal proteins or other cellular components, integrin alpha v beta 3-ligand binding involves recognition of the RGD sequence leading to a highly stabilized protein-protein association."
https://openalex.org/W1521318687,"During the formation of an inhibitory complex with neutrophil elastase, alpha 1 antitrypsin (alpha 1 AT) undergoes a structural rearrangement and the resulting alpha 1 AT-elastase complex becomes endowed with chemoattractant activities, mediates an increase in synthesis of alpha 1 AT, and is rapidly cleared from the circulation. In previous studies we have provided evidence that these biological activities involve the recognition of a conformation-specific domain in the alpha 1 AT molecule by a cell surface receptor on human hepatoma HepG2 cells and human monocytes. The receptor has been termed the serpin-enzyme complex (SEC) receptor because it also recognizes complex of serpins antithrombin III, alpha 1 anti-chymotrypsin, and C1 inhibitor with their cognate enzymes. Because a pentapeptide domain of alpha 1 AT (amino acids 370-374, Phe-Val-Phe-Leu-Met) is sufficient for binding to the SEC receptor and the sequence of this domain is remarkably similar to those of substance P, several other tachykinins, bombesin, and the amyloid-beta peptide, we have examined the possibility that these other ligands bind to the SEC receptor. The results indicate that substance P, several other tachykinins, and bombesin compete for binding to, and cross-linking of, the SEC receptor. The SEC receptor is distinct from the substance P receptor by several criteria. There is no substance P receptor mRNA in HepG2 cells; the SEC receptor is present in much higher density on receptor-bearing cells and binds its ligands at lower affinity than the substance P receptor; the SEC receptor is much less restricted in the specificity with which it recognizes ligand; ligands for the SEC receptor including peptide 105Y (based on alpha 1 AT sequence 359-374), alpha 1 AT-protease complexes, and bombesin do not compete for binding of substance P to a stable transfected cell line expressing the substance P receptor. Finally, we show here that the amyloid-beta peptide competes for binding to the SEC receptor but does not bind to the substance P receptor, therein raising the possibility that the SEC receptor is involved in certain biological activities, including the recently described neurotrophic and neurotoxic effects ascribed to the amyloid-beta peptide."
https://openalex.org/W1993149760,"To elucidate the role of myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) in the axon-Schwann cell interaction leading to myelination, neonatal rodent Schwann cells were infected in vitro with a recombinant retrovirus expressing MAG antisense RNA or MAG sense RNA. Stably infected Schwann cells and uninfected cells were then cocultured with purified sensory neurons under conditions permitting extensive myelination in vitro. A proportion of the Schwann cells infected with the MAG antisense virus did not myelinate axons and expressed lower levels of MAG than control myelinating Schwann cells, as measured by immunofluorescence. Electron microscopy revealed that the affected cells failed to segregate large axons and initiate a myelin spiral despite having formed a basal lamina, which normally triggers Schwann cell differentiation. Cells infected with the MAG sense virus formed normal compact myelin. These observations strongly suggest that MAG is the critical Schwann cell component induced by neuronal interaction that initiates peripheral myelination."
https://openalex.org/W1606957656,"Functionally active human interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) receptors require the presence of at least two polypeptides: the IFN gamma receptor and an accessory molecule encoded by a gene on human chromosome 21. Here we have used a murine L cell line that stably contains human chromosome 21 (SCC16-5) to determine whether the receptor's cytoplasmic domain is important for receptor function. SCC16-5 stably transfected with the full-length human IFN gamma receptor cDNA bound, internalized, and responded to human IFN gamma. In contrast, SCC16-5 expressing human IFN gamma receptors lacking a cytoplasmic domain bound human IFN gamma but did not internalize or respond to it. Using a family of IFN gamma receptor deletion mutants, two functionally important regions within the intracellular domain were identified: (a) a membrane proximal region (residues 256-303) required for ligand processing and biologic responsiveness and (b) the carboxyl-terminal 39 amino acids (residues 434-472) needed exclusively for biologic responses."
https://openalex.org/W2068683905,"We characterized numerous partially edited NADH dehydrogenase 7 and ATPase 6 cDNAs. Most of these have a stretch of incompletely edited sequence at the junction of mature and unedited sequences. The characteristics of the junctions suggest editing of sites multiple times and that editing within each junction does not proceed precisely 3' to 5'. Analyses of gRNAs and corresponding junction sequences predict a series of progressively more stable, but incompletely base-paired, interactions in the junction region. The predicted interactions suggest that the gRNA is progressively realigned with the mRNA being edited. We suggest that gRNA interactions with the mRNA result in regions of lower thermodynamic stability that are selected for editing, thus driving toward the most stable structure, the complete gRNA/mRNA duplex."

CD study of the peptides showed that they form alpha-helical structures in the presence of phospholipid liposomes and thus they have amphipathic distribution of the side chains along the axis of the helix. A leakage study of carboxyfluorescein encapsulated in phospholipid vesicles indicated that the peptides possess a highly potent ability to perturb the membrane structure. Membrane current measurements using the planar lipid bilayer technique revealed that the peptide 4(6), which was long enough to span the lipid bilayer in the alpha-helical structure, formed cation-selective ion channels at a concentration of 0.5 microM in a planar diphytanoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer. In contrast, other shorter peptides failed to form discrete and stable channels though they occasionally induced an increase in the membrane current with erratic conductance levels. The probability of detecting a conductance increase was in the order of 4(6) greater than 4(5) greater than 4(4) greater than 4(3), which corresponds to the order of the peptide chain lengths. Furthermore, 4(6) but not 4(5) showed an antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. The structure of ion channels formed by 4(6) and the relationship between the peptide chain length and biological activity of the synthetic peptides are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1602548592,"Abstract We have generated transgenic mice carrying human ornithine decarboxylase gene. Two different transgene constructs were used: (i) a 5'-truncated human ornithine decarboxylase gene and (ii) an intact human ornithine decarboxylase gene. Transgenic mice carrying the 5'-truncated gene did not express human ornithine decarboxylase-specific mRNA. Transgenic mice carrying the intact human ornithine decarboxylase gene expressed human-specific ornithine decarboxylase mRNA in all tissues studied. However, as indicated by actual enzyme assays, the expression pattern was highly unusual. In comparison with their wild-type littermates, the transgenic mice exhibited greatly elevated enzyme activity in almost every tissue studied. Ornithine decarboxylase activity was moderately elevated in parenchymal organs such as liver, kidney, and spleen. Tissues like heart, muscle, lung, thymus, testis, and brain displayed an enzyme activity that was 20 to 80 times higher than that in the respective tissues of nontransgenic animals. The offspring of the first transgenic male founder animal did not show any overt abnormalities, yet their reproductive performance was reduced. The second transgenic founder animal, showing similar aberrant expression of ornithine decarboxylase in all tissues studied, including an extremely high activity in testis, was found to be infertile. Histological examination of the tissues of the latter animal revealed marked changes in testicular morphology. The germinal epithelium was hypoplastic, and the spermatogenesis was virtually totally shut off. Similar examination of male members of the first transgenic mouse line revealed comparable, yet less severe, histological changes in testis."
https://openalex.org/W1528139698,"Two DNA helicases from calf thymus nuclei have been purified and characterized. The two proteins, designated as nuclear DNA helicase I and II, were copurified on Bio-Rex 70, DEAE-Sepharose, phosphocellulose and subsequently separated from each other on a heparin-Sepharose column. Final purification of DNA helicase I was achieved on single-stranded DNA-cellulose and that of DNA helicase II on ATP-agarose. On denaturing polyacrylamide gels, nuclear DNA helicase I displayed two polypeptide bands of 170 and 200 kDa; nuclear DNA helicase II also consisted of two bands, in this case of 100 and 130 kDa. Both enzymes catalyzed the unwinding of a DNA primer from a single-stranded DNA template but had different nucleotide requirements for their energy supply. While nuclear DNA helicase I preferred to hydrolyze ATP or dATP to support its unwinding activity, nuclear DNA helicase II could utilize all four rNTPs or dNTPs, though ATP or dATP were still preferred to other nucleotides. ADP, AMP, or adenosine 5'-O-(thiotriphosphate) could not be used by either enzyme in the unwinding reactions. A divalent cation was essential for activity of both enzymes. Nuclear DNA helicase I required 3-5 mM Mg2+ or 1 mM Mn2+ for optimal unwinding. In contrast, nuclear DNA helicase II displayed high activity even at very low concentrations of Mg2+. Nuclear DNA helicase I was stimulated by NaCl, KCl, or potassium acetate up to concentrations of 150 mM; in contrast, nuclear DNA helicase II was strongly inhibited at salt concentrations over 75 mM. Both DNA helicases had an associated ATPase activity. However, while the ATPase activity of nuclear DNA helicase I was stimulated only in presence of single-stranded DNA, the ATPase activity of the nuclear DNA helicase II was stimulated by single-stranded DNA and, even more efficiently, by RNA. Finally, the translocation of both DNA helicases had a polarity from 3' to 5' with respect to the single-stranded DNA template to which the enzymes were bound. A comparison of these DNA helicases with the other reported mammalian DNA helicases will be given. The significance of the association of the two DNA helicases during the process of the purification will be discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1546234999,"Independent of de novo protein synthesis, interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and dexamethasone caused immediate stimulation of transcriptional activity of most major acute phase plasma protein genes in the rat hepatoma H-35 cells. However, activation of alpha 2-macroglobulin and alpha 1-acid glycoprotein genes were delayed by 2-4 h and required ongoing protein synthesis. The hormones also increased transiently the transcription of the junB gene and the amounts of JunB, C/EBP, and C/EBP-like mRNA. To identify whether JunB and C/EBP have the ability to control both the early and late acute phase reactants, expression vectors for mouse C/EBP and JunB together with reporter gene constructs containing recognized hormone-specific regulatory elements were introduced into hepatoma cells. C/EBP displayed prominent transactivation activity with the interleukin-1 and glucocorticoid regulatory elements of alpha 1-acid glycoprotein, the interleukin-1 regulatory element of haptoglobin gene, and the interleukin-6 regulatory element of beta-fibrinogen. The interleukin-6 regulatory elements of the first two genes and the glucocorticoid response element of the third gene were not affected by C/EBP. These data suggest that normal hormone activation of these three acute phase reactant genes might involve, in part, C/EBP-related factors which have a broad range of specificity. H-35 cells stably transformed with a mouse C/EBP expression vector showed an elevated basal level as well as cytokine inducible expression of some but not all acute phase reactants. Cotransfected JunB resulted in reduced activity of cytokine-responsive constructs and in lower transactivation by C/EBP. JunB appears to function as a modulator of plasma protein expression during the course of acute phase response."
https://openalex.org/W277046903,"Inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase (5-phosphatase) hydrolyzes inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate and thereby functions as a signal terminating enzyme in cellular calcium ion mobilization. A cDNA encoding human platelet 5-phosphatase has been isolated by screening for beta-galactosidase fusion proteins that bind to inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate. The sensitivity of the screening procedure was enhanced 50- to 100-fold by amplification of sublibraries prior to carrying out binding assays. The sequences derived from the expression clone were used to screen human erythroleukemia cell line and human megakaryocytic cell line cDNA libraries. We obtained two additional clones which together consist of 2381 base pairs. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence from the 75-kDa 5-phosphatase purified from platelets is identical to amino acids 38-56 predicted from the cDNA. This suggests that the platelet 5-phosphatase is formed by proteolytic processing of a larger precursor. The cDNA predicts that the mature enzyme contains 635 amino acids (Mr 72, 891). Antibodies directed against recombinant TrpE fusion proteins of either an amino-terminal region or a carboxyl-terminal region immunoprecipitate the enzyme activity from a preparation of the 75-kDa form of platelet 5-phosphatase (Type II) but do not precipitate the distinct 47-kDa 5-phosphatase (Type I) also found in platelets. In addition, the recombinant protein expressed in Cos-7 cells has the same 5-phosphatase activity as the platelet 5-phosphatase."

We show that the ability of an exogenous myogenin expression vector to activate the endogenous myogenin allele in 10T1/2 fibroblasts is dependent on serum withdrawal. Repression of myogenin autoregulation by serum can be observed with a reporter gene linked to myogenin upstream sequences, indicating that repression occurs at the level of transcription. Like MyoD, myogenin exhibits a short half-life (approximately 20 min), which may serve to maintain the autoregulatory loop without allowing excess accumulation of the protein."

Relative to EGF-R, EK-R activation stimulated kit-characteristic phosphorylation of human 293 fibroblast substrate polypeptides. Transient coexpression of EK-R with candidate substrates resulted in ligand-induced phosphorylation of phospholipase C gamma and guanosine triphosphatase-activating polypeptide. The RAF-1 serine/threonine kinase was shown to be associated with activated EK-R, but no tyrosine phosphorylation could be detected. The faithfulness of EK-R substrate phosphorylation specificity was confirmed with stem cell factor-stimulated p145c-kit."
https://openalex.org/W1566155366,"The Maroteaux-Lamy syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis type VI) is a lysosomal storage disease with autosomal recessive inheritance caused by deficiency of the enzyme arylsulfatase B. Severe, intermediate, and mild forms of the disease have been described. The molecular correlate of the clinical heterogeneity is not known at present. To identify the molecular defect in a patient with the intermediate form of the disease, arylsulfatase B mRNA from his fibroblasts was reverse-transcribed, amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, and subcloned. Three point mutations were detected by DNA sequence analysis, two of which, a silent A to G transition at nucleotide 1191 and a G to A transition at nucleotide 1126 resulting in a methionine for valine 376 substitution, were polymorphisms. A G to T transversion at nucleotide 410 causing a valine for glycine 137 substitution (G137V) was identified as the mutation underlying the Maroteaux-Lamy phenotype of the patient, who was homozygous for the allele. The kinetic parameters of the mutant arylsulfatase B enzyme toward a radiolabeled trisaccharide substrate were normal excluding an alteration of the active site. The G137V mutation did not affect the synthesis but severely reduced the stability of the arylsulfatase B precursor. While the wild type precursor is converted by limited proteolysis in late endosomes or lysosomes to a mature form, the majority of the mutant precursor was degraded presumably in a compartment proximal to the trans Golgi network and only a small amount escaped to the lysosomes accounting for the low residual enzyme activity in fibroblasts of a patient with the juvenile form of the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2309412613,"The cDNA clone for rat liver microsomal aldehyde dehydrogenase (msALDH) was isolated and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence consisting of 484 amino acid residues revealed that the carboxyl-terminal region of msALDH has a hydrophobic segment, which is probably important for the insertion of this enzyme into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. COS-1 cells transfected with the expression vector pcD containing the full-length cDNA showed that the active enzyme was expressed and localized mainly on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum membranes. It has been proposed that ALDH isozymes form a superfamily consisting of class 1, 2, and 3 ALDHs (Hempel, J., Harper, K., and Lindahl, R., (1989) Biochemistry 28, 1160-1167). Comparison of the amino acid sequence of rat liver msALDH with those of rat other class ALDHs showed that msALDH was 24.2, 24.0, and 65.5% identical to phenobarbital-inducible ALDH (variant class 1), mitochondrial ALDH (class 2), and tumor-associated ALDH (class 3), respectively. Several amino acid residues common to the other known ALDHs, however, were found to be conserved in msALDH. Based on these results, we proposed to classify msALDH as a new type, class 4 ALDH."
https://openalex.org/W1565144343,"Testis-specific H2B (TH2B) histone gene of rat is expressed during meiotic event of spermatogenic differentiation. The gene is unusual in that it has conserved the regulatory elements involved in the S phase-specific transcription of somatic H2B genes as well as the S phase-specific stabilization of histone mRNA. Genomic sequencing revealed that all analyzed CpG sites in the promoter region of TH2B gene are methylated in somatic tissues but not in testis. During spermatogenesis, these CpG sites are unmethylated as early as spermatogonia type A and up to sperm. Thus, there is a good correlation between DNA hypomethylation and germ cell-specific expression of TH2B gene. Results obtained from in vivo DNase footprinting and DNA mobility shift experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that DNA methylation inhibits gene activity by preventing the binding of transcription factors to their recognition sequences. The results show that (i) the binding of ubiquitous transcription factors to the promoter region of TH2B gene may be blocked in nuclei of liver, and (ii) DNA methylation can directly interfere with the binding of transcription factors recognizing a hexamer (ACGTCA) motif. In vitro DNA methylation and transfection experiments demonstrated that expression of TH2B gene is inhibited by DNA methylation in vivo. These findings indicate that DNA methylation may play a key role in the transcriptional repression of germ cell-specific TH2B gene."
https://openalex.org/W1487728646,"Subunit VIIa of bovine cytochrome c oxidase occurs in two forms, the so-called heart and liver isoforms, which have been shown by protein analysis to differ in 35% of their amino acids. We have isolated and characterized cDNAs for each isoform. The derived heart-type processed protein is 59 amino acids long, with a 21-residue presequence; the immediate C terminus differs from the established protein sequence. The liver-type processed protein is 60 residues long, with a 23-amino acid presequence. Both presequences are traditional in that they are positively charged and appear amphiphilic when helically arrayed. The presequences are only 22% identical, but they both contain conserved residues indicative of two-step processing of the precursor proteins. Southern blot analysis reveals that the bovine genome contains five to six copies of the liver-type gene as opposed to the presence of a single copy heart-type gene. Transcriptional analysis shows that heart-type message is detectable only in heart and skeletal muscle; the liver type is also seen in heart and muscle and, additionally, in the other tissues examined (liver, brain, and lung). The amino acid sequence EKQKLFQED is conserved in rat and in both isoforms in cow and human and may represent a domain of core subunit function."
https://openalex.org/W1614195017,"The trans-acting factors of the mouse alpha-fetoprotein proximal promoter (-202 base pairs) are aligned as follows: regions Ia (HNF-1), Ib (C/EBP), II (NF-1 or C/EBP), II' (NF-1 or HNF-1), III (NP-III), IV (NP-IV), Va (NP-Va), and Vb (C/EBP). Site-specific mutation abolished protein binding to the corresponding mutated site with the exception of the NF-1 site, in which mutation causes partial protection. Transient expression analyses indicate that chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (CAT) activity is reduced by mutations in regions Ia, II', Ib, II, and IV. Mutation of region III causes an increased activity and mutation of regions Va and Vb shows a slight inhibitory effect. Linking alpha-fetoprotein enhancer I to the wild type promoter resulted in a 12-fold stimulation of CAT activity. The activity of promoters with mutated C/EBP-binding sites (Ib, II, and Vb), was slightly above controls, indicating that enhancer I can reverse the effect of these mutations. Inhibition or stimulation of promoter activity resulting from mutations of the HNF-1 or NP-III binding sites, respectively, persisted when enhancer I was linked to the promoters, indicating that enhancer I cannot rescue these mutations. Mutation of both HNF-1-binding sites resulted in greater than 90% inhibition of CAT expression with and without enhancer I, indicating these sites are essential for promoter activity. The stimulation of promoter activity by mutation of the NP-III site suggests that this site may be essential for repression or attenuation of the alpha-fetoprotein gene. Our studies indicate that regulation of the alpha-fetoprotein gene requires the combinatorial effect of multiple cis- and trans-acting elements in the proximal promoter and that enhancer I may provide a factor(s) that specifically rescue the promoter from the inhibitory effect of mutation in the C/EBP-binding sites."

The purified protein is active in hydrolyzing RNA-DNA hybrids in two separate in vitro assay systems. In light of recent reports of similar HIV-1 RNase H domains which were enzymatically inactive (Becerra, S. P., Clore, G. M., Gronenborn, A. M., Karlstrom, A. R., Stahl, S. J., Wilson, S.M., and Wingfield, P.T. (1990) FEBS Lett. 270, 76-80; Hostomsky, Z., Hostomska, Z., Hudson, G. O., Moomaw, E. W., and Nodes, B. R. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 88, 1148-1152), our results suggest that a stretch of 20-30 residues immediately upstream of the polymerase-RNase H junction (residues 440-441 of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase) may be required for productive binding and alignment of the hybrid RNA-DNA substrate. The active HIV-1 RNase H domain is suitable for structural analysis, thereby providing a unique active molecule to better understand the structural basis for the functional organization of RNase associated with the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase."
https://openalex.org/W1516591411,"Expression of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) gene in LLC-PK1 cells can be induced by signals mediated by both cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and Ca(2+)- and phospholipid-dependent protein kinase (PKC). We have utilized the tumor promoter 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) to down-regulate PKC, in order to test for an effect on the PKA-mediated induction of the uPA gene expression. Incubation of cells for 24 h with 100 ng/ml TPA caused a marked decrease of PKC protein, both in cytosolic and particulate fractions, and an 85% reduction of total PKC activity. After down-regulation of PKC, uPA mRNA accumulation induced by 8-Br-cAMP was 5-10-fold higher than in control cells. Both uPA mRNA stability and uPA gene transcription rates induced by 8-Br-cAMP were increased by PKC down-regulation (6- and 1.8-fold, respectively). Although total PKA activity was reduced by 20% in extracts from PKC-depleted cells, activation of PKA by 8-Br-cAMP was 2.5-fold higher than in control cells. This enhanced activation of PKA in PKC-depleted cells also occurred in response to other cAMP derivatives and to cAMP induced endogenously by the activation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin, but was not due to down-regulation-associated changes in the rate of cAMP synthesis. Our results demonstrate that in LLC-PK1 cells, down-regulation of PKC results in an enhanced induction of uPA gene expression by cAMP-mediated signals without alterations in adenylate cyclase activity, suggesting a mechanism distal to adenylate cyclase."
https://openalex.org/W1607251423,"We have analyzed four Nicotiana plumbaginifolia null mutants presumably affected in the heme domain of nitrate reductase. The DNA sequence of this domain has been determined for each mutant and for the wild type. Two mutations were identified as single base changes leading to, respectively, the substitution of a histidine residue by an asparagine (mutant E56) and to the appearance of an ochre stop codon (mutant E64). Based on the amino acid sequence homology between the nitrate reductase heme domain and mammalian cytochrome b5, we have predicted the three-dimensional structure of this domain. This showed that the nitrate reductase heme domain is structurally very similar to cytochrome b5 and it also confirmed that the residue involved in E56 mutation is one of the two heme-binding histidines. The two other mutations (mutants A1 and K21) were found to be, respectively, -1 and +1 frameshift mutations resulting in the appearance of an opal stop codon. These sequence data confirmed previous genetic and biochemical hypotheses on nitrate reductase-deficient mutants. Northern blot analysis of these mutants indicated that mutant E56 overexpressed the nitrate reductase mRNA, whereas the nonsense mutations present in the other mutants led to reduced levels of nitrate reductase mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1505056643,"Previous studies have shown that nuclear B binds specifically to the C-terminal domains of type III intermediate filament (IF) proteins under in vitro conditions. To further explore such site-specific interactions, we have used a two-step anti-idiotypic antibody approach. First, a monoclonal antibody disrupting the cytoplasmic IF network organization of living cells (mAb7A3) (Matteoni, R., and Kreis, T. E. (1987) J. Cell Biol. 105, 1253-1265) was characterized. Epitope mapping demonstrated that this antibody recognized a site located in the C-terminal domains of vimentin and peripherin (type III IF proteins). mAb7A3 was able to inhibit more than 80% of the in vitro binding of nuclear B to PI, a synthetic peptide modeled after the C-terminal domain of peripherin that comprises a B-binding site (Djabali, K., Portier, M. M., Gros, F., Blobel, G., and Georgatos, S. D. (1991) Cell 64, 109-121). In a second step, animals were immunized with mAb7A3 and the resulting anti-idiotypic sera were screened. Two of these antisera reacted specifically with nuclear B but not with type A lamins or cytoplasmic IF proteins. The anti-lamin B activity of one of the antisera was isolated by affinity chromatography using a B-agarose matrix. The reaction of these affinity-purified antibodies with B was inhibited by mAb7A3. Furthermore, the anti-lamin B antibodies reacted with Fab fragments of mAb7A3 and abolished binding of B to PI. From these data we conclude that anti-idiotypic antibodies against the paratope of mAb7A3 recognize specific epitopes of the B molecule that have shapes complementary to the one of the C-terminal domain of type III IF proteins. We speculate that these (regional) conformations, which we term the lamin B-fold, may also occur in non-lamin proteins that mediate the anchorage of IFs to various membranous organelles."
https://openalex.org/W1512497104,"Intestinal epithelial cells were isolated from a fetus with cystic fibrosis (CF) and transfected with a plasmid vector recombined with the ori- mutant of SV40. A population of proliferative cells was then subcloned and designated as CFI-3. These cells had a doubling time of 24 h and were maintained in culture for up to 25 passages. At passage 8, CFI-3 cells did not produce any tumors in nude mice. Northern blot and immunofluorescence studies indicated that the extended lifespan of CFI-3 cells results in genomic insertion of SV40 LT. Intestinal CFI-3 cells are epithelial, according to the expression of the human cytokeratin 18 gene and poorly differentiated by phase-contrast and electron microscopy. Functional membrane receptors activated by vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), its natural analogue pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP-38), and isoproterenol were observed in CFI-3 cells. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the PstI KM19 site revealed that the cftr locus was identical in the chorionic villi and in CFI-3 cells. The manifestation of CF in this family was not related to the common mutation delta F508, since this fetus was heterozygous for the substitutions S549N and N1303K. Chloride transport, assessed by the 125I efflux, was induced in CFI-3 cells by the calcium inophore ionomycin, but not by the adenylate cyclase activator forskolin, and was inhibited by the chloride channel blocker 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid. These results were confirmed in patch clamp studies in which the cpt cAMP analogue failed to stimulate membrane currents, while the calcium ionophore ionomycin stimulated inward currents. We conclude that intestinal CFI-3 cells retain the CF phenotype relating to defective regulation of Cl- channels, and therefore constitute a suitable model, 1) for elucidating the function of CFTR protein, 2) developing new therapeutic agents, and 3) correcting the CF defect by gene replacement therapy in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1576345393,"We report a case of mild osteogenesis imperfecta in a 56-year-old male undergoing aortic valve replacement surgery. The primary defect in this patient was the substitution of arginine for glycine 85 in one of the two chains of alpha 1(I) procollagen. The thermal stability of the type I collagen synthesized by the patient's cultured skin fibroblasts was examined by enzymatic digestion. Digestion of the mutant type I collagen with trypsin and chymotrypsin at increasing temperatures sequentially generated three discrete collagenous fragments, approximately 90, 170, and 230 amino acids shorter than normal type I collagen. This incremental thermal denaturation is indicative of cooperative melting blocks within the type I collagen. This is the first demonstration of such cooperative blocks of melting in intact, essentially normal post-translationally modified type I collagen. This direct evidence for cooperative melting domains of uncut type I collagen suggests that discrete blocks of amino acids function as core sites stabilizing the collagen helix. The location of mutations of the alpha chains of type I collagen relative to these discrete blocks of amino acids may influence the severity of the disease phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1834360170,"Using differential hybridization techniques we have isolated a hamster cDNA encoding a cholesterol-regulated protein. By sequence homology we concluded that the isolated cDNA encodes alpha 1-inhibitor III (alpha 1 I3), a protein of the alpha-macroglobulin (alpha M) family. When hamsters were fed diets rich in cholesterol, cholic acid, or chenodeoxycholic acid, the amount of alpha 1I3 RNA was reduced between 5- and 10-fold. Drugs that lower plasma cholesterol levels, such as colestipol and mevinolin, increased alpha 1I3 RNA between 2- and 3-fold. Additionally, plasma alpha 1I3 protein levels, as measured by immunoblotting techniques using an anti-human alpha 2M antibody, correlate well with alpha 1I3 RNA levels in those hamsters. Plasma alpha 1I3 protein was inversely proportional to plasma cholesterol levels in those hamsters. The observed suppression of alpha 1I3 expression by cholesterol mimics the cholesterol-mediated regulation of other genes that maintain cholesterol homeostasis, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, and low density lipoprotein receptor. We hypothesize that alpha 1I3 may play a role in the onset of atherosclerosis and may provide a link between cholesterol and the clotting system. Furthermore, the availability of another sterol-regulated gene, like alpha 1I3, should help elucidate the molecular mechanisms of cholesterol-mediated regulation of gene transcription."
https://openalex.org/W2133774796,"Prior research has demonstrated that globin ontogeny of hamster proceeds nearly to completion during the several days that yolk sac erythroid cells (YSEC) circulate in the embryo; synthesis of embryonic globin chains gives way to synthesis of adult globin chains in these primitive cells. In the present study, we translated total cell RNA extracted from YSEC on days 9-13 of gestation in wheat germ cell-free extract, expecting to observe the same progressive rise that occurs in vivo in rates of translation of alpha- and beta-globin mRNA during ontogeny. The opposite occurred; translation rates of both globins decreased sharply. This disparity between synthesis of alpha- and beta-globins in vivo and in vitro suggested an element of control of translation attributable to the YSEC cytoplasm. We therefore assayed the effect of RNA-free clarified YSEC cytoplasm on cell-free translation of YSEC RNA. A repression of translation was detected of alpha- and beta-globin mRNA (not of embryonic globin mRNA), exercised strongly by cytoplasm from YSEC early in ontogeny (gestational day 9), and weakening as ontogeny progressed. The same effect was noted on alpha- and beta-globin mRNA of adult hamster and of rabbit. Heat treatment of cytoplasm abolished the greater part of the translation regulation, suggesting that the active agent is protein. Further characterization of this translational regulator included: (a) it binds to globin poly(A) mRNA but not to poly(A), (b) it was not detected in cell lysate of adult hamster brain, lung, or erythrocytes, and (c) it did not inhibit translation of adult hamster brain and liver RNA. We conclude that hamster globin ontogeny is substantially modulated by this translational regulation of alpha- and beta-globin expression."
