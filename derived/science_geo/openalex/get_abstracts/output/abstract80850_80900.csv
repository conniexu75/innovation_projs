https://openalex.org/W1520611194,"The effects on guanylate cyclase and cyclic GMP accumulation of a synthetic peptide containing the amino acid sequence and biological activity of atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) were studied. ANF activated particulate guanylate cyclase in a concentration- and time- dependent fashion in crude membranes obtained from homogenates of rat kidney. Activation of particulate guanylate cyclase by ANF was also observed in particulate fractions from homogenates of rat aorta, testes, intestine, lung, and liver, but not from heart or brain. Soluble guanylate cyclase obtained from these tissues was not activated by ANF. Trypsin treatment of ANF prevented the activation of guanylate cyclase, while heat treatment had no effect. Accumulation of cyclic GMP in kidney minces and aorta was stimulated by ANF activation of guanylate cyclase. These data suggest a role for particulate guanylate cyclase in the molecular mechanisms underlying the physiological effects of ANF such as vascular relaxation, natriuresis, and diuresis."
https://openalex.org/W1532747508,"Hormonal inhibition of adenylate cyclase is mediated by a guanine nucleotide regulatory protein (Ni) which is different from the one which mediates hormonal stimulation. There is substantial evidence that the active component of Ni (termed alpha i can be ADP-ribosylated by a toxin from Bordetella pertussis. We have found that in bovine cerebral cortex there are three proteins of similar molecular weight (39,000-41,000) which are modified by pertussis toxin. We have purified these proteins and have resolved the 41,000-dalton protein from the 40,000/39,000-dalton doublet. All three forms of pertussis toxin substrate can be isolated in free form or together with a 36,000 beta component. We have also purified this beta component. ADP-ribosylation of the three pertussis toxin substrates is greatly enhanced by the addition of the purified beta component. This makes possible an assay of beta subunit activity based on its interaction with alpha i. The three forms of pertussis toxin substrate which we have purified differ in two functions: susceptibility to ADP-ribosylation and GTPase activity. The 41,000-dalton protein is more readily ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin than the smaller forms. The 39,000-dalton protein has GTPase activity with a low Km (0.3 microM) for GTP. The GTPase activity can be doubled by phospholipids. The GTPase activity of the 41,000-dalton protein is almost undetectable. It is not yet known what the relationship of the forms is to each other. The smaller forms may be derived from the larger by proteolysis or it may be intrinsically different. It remains to be shown whether one of the forms represents a different type of regulatory protein which transmits a hormonal signal to effectors other than adenylate cyclase."

https://openalex.org/W1535139255,"Caldesmon, a major calmodulin- and actin-binding protein of smooth muscle (Sobue, K., Muramoto, Y., Fujita, M., and Kakiuchi, S. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 5652-5655), has been obtained in highly purified form from chicken gizzard by a modification of a previously published procedure (Ngai, P. K., Carruthers, C. A., and Walsh, M. P. (1984) Biochem. J. 218, 863-870) and was found to cause a significant inhibition of both superprecipitation and actin-activated myosin Mg2+-ATPase activity in a system reconstituted from the purified contractile and regulatory proteins without influencing the phosphorylation state of myosin. This inhibitory effect was seen both in the presence and absence of tropomyosin. A Ca2+-and calmodulin-dependent kinase which catalyzed phosphorylation of caldesmon was identified in chicken gizzard; this kinase is distinct from myosin light-chain kinase. Caldesmon prepared by calmodulin-Sepharose affinity chromatography was contaminated with caldesmon kinase activity and was unable to inhibit actomyosin ATPase activity or superprecipitation. Phosphatase activity capable of dephosphorylating caldesmon was also identified in smooth muscle. These results indicate that caldesmon can inhibit smooth muscle actomyosin ATPase activity in vitro, and this function may itself be subject to regulation by reversible phosphorylation of caldesmon."

https://openalex.org/W1967626450,"The kinetics of association of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and diferric-transferrin (TF) with clathrin-coated membranes of KB cells were examined using anti-clathrin antibody bound to Staphylococcus aureus. The ligands were bound to cells at 4 degrees C and after warming to 30 degrees C for 5 min, both ligands were found concentrated in a membrane fraction immunoadsorbed with anti-clathrin antibody. Fifteen minutes after entry both ligands moved to a non-clathrin-associated compartment. Twenty to 25 min after entry, EGF, but not TF, appeared in a second clathrin-associated compartment. In parallel morphologic experiments, EGF-horseradish peroxidase (EGF-HRP) and TF-HRP were both found at 6 min in coated pits associated with the plasma membrane. At 22 min EGF-HRP, but not TF-HRP, was localized in Golgi-associated coated pits. These studies provide biochemical and morphological evidence suggesting that coated membranes in the Golgi region are involved at some stage in the transfer of EGF to lysosomes. The method should be of general utility in the study of receptor-mediated endocytosis."
https://openalex.org/W1980817649,"Contrary to long-held assumptions, recent work indicates that neurons may profoundly change transmitter status during development and maturity. For example, sympathetic neurons, classically regarded as exclusively noradrenergic or cholinergic, can also express putative peptide transmitters such as substance P. This neuronal plasticity is directly related to membrane depolarization and sodium ion influx. The same molecular mechanisms and plastic responses occur in mature as well as developing neurons. Further, contrary to traditional teaching, adult primary sensory neurons may express the catecholaminergic phenotype in vivo. Transmitter plasticity is not restricted to the peripheral nervous system: ongoing studies of the brain nucleus locus ceruleus in culture indicate that specific extracellular factors elicit marked transmitter changes. Consequently, neurotransmitter expression and metabolism are dynamic, changing processes, regulated by a variety of defined factors. Transmitter plasticity adds a newly recognized dimension of flexibility to nervous system function."
https://openalex.org/W1570364868,"Tyrosine hydroxylase purified from rat pheochromocytoma was phosphorylated stoichiometrically by either cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase or calmodulin-dependent multiprotein kinase from skeletal muscle, but not by five other protein kinases tested. The activity of tyrosine hydroxylase was elevated 3-fold by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, but no activation was observed after phosphorylation by calmodulin-dependent multiprotein kinase. Phosphorylation produced by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase and calmodulin-dependent multiprotein kinase was additive, suggesting different sites of phosphorylation. This was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of tryptic phosphopeptides which demonstrated that the major sites phosphorylated by each protein kinase were distinct. A calmodulin-dependent multiprotein kinase that had identical properties and substrate specificity to the skeletal muscle enzyme was partially purified from rat pheochromocytoma. The possibility that this protein kinase is involved in the regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase activity in adrenergic tissue in vivo is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1642643214,"A peptide (resact) associated with the eggs of the sea urchin, Arbacia punctulata, which stimulates sperm respiration rates by 5-10-fold, was purified and its amino acid sequence was determined. The sequence was found to be Cys-Val-Thr-Gly-Ala-Pro-Gly-Cys-Val-Gly-Gly-Gly-Arg-Leu-NH2. The peptide was subsequently synthesized by solid phase methods, amidated at the carboxyl-terminal Leu, and shown to be identical to the isolated, native material. The peptide half-maximally stimulated A. punctulata spermatozoan respiration at 0.5 nM and half-maximally elevated cyclic GMP concentrations at 25 nM at an extracellular pH of 6.6. The increase in oxygen consumption was coupled with a stimulation of motility. However, at elevated extracellular pH (pH 8.0), resact failed to appreciably stimulate respiration while the elevations of cyclic GMP continued to occur. Resact did not cross-react with sperm cells obtained from Lytechinus pictus or Strongylocentrotus purpuratus; a peptide (speract) obtained from S. purpuratus eggs (Gly-Phe-Asp-Leu-Asn-Gly-Gly-Gly-Val-Gly) which activates S. purpuratus sperm respiration did not stimulate A. punctulata spermatozoa. Resact caused a shift in the apparent molecular weight (160,000-150,000) of a major sperm plasma membrane protein; as with cyclic GMP elevations, this response was evident at extracellular pH values of both 6.6 and 8.0. The protein exists in the cell as a phosphoprotein and 32P is released coincident with the molecular weight change. Approximately 115 nM resact caused one-half-maximal conversion of the 160,000-dalton protein after 1 min of incubation. Resact caused the apparent molecular weight conversion of the protein within 5 s and appeared to do so in an irreversible manner. The molecular weight change of the protein was also observed after the addition of monensin A (25 microM) and NH4Cl (40 mM), two agents known to elevate intracellular pH and to increase sperm respiration rates. The membrane protein appears to be the enzyme guanylate cyclase, but since concentrations of resact causing one-half-maximal conversion of the Mr = 160,000 form of the enzyme are about 250 times higher than those causing one-half-maximal stimulation of respiration, the relationship of the apparent molecular weight conversion to a subsequent physiological event remains unclear."
https://openalex.org/W1495507409,"A cDNA clone, labeled pFOD5, isolated from a fetal-rat skeletal-muscle cDNA library, has been characterized and found to contain sequences corresponding to a perinatal-specific skeletal myosin heavy-chain (MHC) mRNA. This MHC cDNA demonstrates a high degree of nucleotide- and amino acid-sequence conservation with other MHC genes, but its carboxyl-terminal peptide and 3'-untranslated region are highly divergent and specific for this gene. S1 nuclease mapping experiments have shown that the perinatal MHC gene represented by this cDNA clone is only transiently expressed during skeletal-muscle development. Perinatal MHC mRNA is first detected late in fetal life, reaches maximal levels of expression at the end of the first postnatal week, and is de-induced thereafter. Its levels are almost undetectable at 28 days of postnatal life. During fetal and early postnatal life, the expression of this perinatal gene in skeletal muscle overlaps with the expression of the embryonic MHC gene. After the first week of extrauterine life, this gene is coexpressed with two adult MHC genes. The transient expression of this perinatal MHC gene raises interesting questions about the physiological significance of the MHC transitions and offers an interesting model for the study of MHC gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W82903333,"The gene encoding rat somatostatin has been isolated from a lambda phage gene library. Phage harboring the gene were identified by plaque hybridization using a nick-translated fragment derived from the cDNA for rat somatostatin. The transcriptional unit includes exons of 238 and 367 base pairs (bp) separated by one intron of 621 bp. The intron is located between the codons for Gln (-57) and Glu (-56) of prosomatostatin. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence 5' to the start of transcription reveals a number of sequences which may be involved in the expression of somatostatin. A variant of the TATA box, TTTAAA, lies 26 bp upstream from the start of transcription, and a sequence homologous to the CAAT box (GGCTAAT) is 92 bp upstream from the transcription start. A long alternating purine-pyrimidine stretch, (GT)25, which is similar to Z DNA-forming sequences in other genes, lies 628 bp 5' to the transcription start and is flanked by small repeats. Hybridization analysis shows that this region is highly repeated in the genome and that homologous sequences are located approximately 2 kilobase pairs downstream from the poly(A) addition site. Southern hybridization of the lambda clone with probes derived from brain or liver poly(A+) RNA demonstrates that another transcribed sequence lies about 7 kilobase pairs downstream from the poly(A) addition site of the rat somatostatin gene. Analysis of rat DNA suggests that there may be restriction-site polymorphisms in or near the gene or that additional somatostatin-hybridizing sequences may exist in the genome."
https://openalex.org/W2152746599,"Isolated, mononucleated, cross-striated muscle of a medusa can be activated by collagenase treatment to transdifferentiate completely to various new cell types and to regenerate autonomously the sexual (without gametes) and feeding organ of the animal. Under these circumstances all isolated muscle fragments produce smooth muscle cells and a glandular cell type (y-cells). When culture conditions are appropriate, endoderm is also formed, followed by regeneration of a complex organ of seven or eight new non-muscle cell types, including nematocytes, digestive, secretory, gland, interstitial, and presumably nerve cells."

https://openalex.org/W1520628061,"Two major Ca2+ transport mechanisms co-function in a preparation of synaptosomal plasma membrane vesicles: an (ATP + Mg2+)-dependent Ca2+ pump, and a reversible Na+-Ca2+ exchanger (Gill, D. L., Grollman, E.F., and Kohn, L. D. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 184-192). An accurate comparative analysis of the kinetics of the two Ca2+ transporters under free Ca2+ conditions precisely buffered with EGTA, reveals that both mechanisms have high affinity for Ca2+. The ATP-dependent Ca2+ pump displays simple saturation kinetics with a Km for Ca2+ of 0.11 microM and a Vmax of 2.2 nmol/min/mg of protein. In contrast, the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger has a complex dependence on free Ca2+, the activity continuing to saturate over a wide range of free Ca2+ concentrations from 0.03 microM to 3 mM. The curvilinear Eadie-Hofstee analysis reveals a distinct high affinity component for the exchanger with a Km for Ca2+ of approximately 0.5 microM, and a lower affinity component not accurately resolvable into a discrete Km value. 2 mM amiloride blocks Na+-Ca2+ exchange-mediated Ca2+ uptake by 90% over a wide range of free Ca2+ (0.3-3000 microM), suggesting a similar noncompetitive inhibition of both low and high affinity Ca2+ sites. Ca2+ accumulated in vesicles via either the Ca2+ pump or Na+-Ca2+ exchanger is rapidly (in less than 1 min) released by 0.1% saponin (w/v), although a minor component (8-10%) of Ca2+ pump activity is resistant to saponin addition. The IC50 for the effect of saponin is the same (0.01%, w/v) for both Ca2+ transport mechanisms. The ATP-dependent Ca2+ pump is shown to be highly sensitive to vanadate inhibition (Ki = 0.5 microM). The high saponin sensitivity of both Ca2+ transporters and the potent effect of vanadate on Ca2+ pumping, together with previous Na+ channel and Na+ pump flux studies in the same membrane vesicles (Gill, D. L. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 10986-10990), all strongly suggest that both of the high affinity Ca2+ transporters function in the plasma membrane where they are of major functional importance to the regulation of intrasynaptic free Ca2+ levels."
https://openalex.org/W1577286351,"The culture of peritoneal macrophages in serum-containing media induces a dramatic increase in the expression of the enzyme tissue transglutaminase. The transglutaminase-inducing activity of serum is abolished by extraction of lipids and fully restored by re-addition of physiological concentrations (1-100 nM) of trans-retinoic acid. Induction of the enzyme is detectable within a 90-min exposure of macrophages to retinoic acid and is completely blocked by actinomycin D, suggesting that the retinoid rapidly increases the rate of transglutaminase gene expression. Delipidized serum is required to elicit the transglutaminase-inducing activity of retinoic acid and this effect is decreased if the serum is depleted of the serum retinol-binding protein. Our studies suggest that retinoic acid and serum retinol-binding protein can directly regulate macrophage gene expression and specifically induce the synthesis of tissue transglutaminase."

https://openalex.org/W2019743467,"Two transglutaminase-mediated modifications of the rat epididymal spermatozoon surface were demonstrated in vitro. Transglutaminase was effective in promoting the binding of spermidine to the sperm. Moreover, the enzyme, by reacting with one of the major proteins secreted by the rat seminal vesicle epithelium, produced a modified form of the protein with a higher molecular weight and the capability of binding to the sperm cells. A specific physiological role for the enzyme, bringing about modifications of the rat sperm surface in the seminal fluid environment, is suggested."
https://openalex.org/W2053272547,"Glucose inhibits collagen fibril formation in vitro. A linear dose response was observed, with half-maximum inhibition of fibril formation occurring at 50 mM glucose. Nonfibrillar collagen cannot be cross-linked by lysyl oxidase, an enzyme that catalyzes the initial cross-linking reaction. The degree of decreased fibril formation correlated with the loss of ability of the collagen to serve as a substrate for lysyl oxidase. Collagen that is not cross-linked is unstable and more susceptible to collagenolytic attack. Interference with collagen cross-linking and more rapid degradation may explain the decreased amounts of interstitial collagen and the poor healing of wounds associated with diabetes mellitus."
https://openalex.org/W1480876303,"Lysyl oxidase initiates the covalent cross-linking of elastin and collagen by oxidizing lysine residues in these proteins to alpha-aminoadipic-delta-semialdehyde. Sequences surrounding susceptible lysines in elastin are considerably different from those in collagen and yet the same enzyme can oxidize both substrates. Possible bases of the specificity have been explored assaying for H2O2 release accompanying the oxidation of synthetic peptide and protein substrates. Rates of oxidation of random co-polymers were maximal with (Ala,Lys)n and decreased in the order (Val,Lys)n greater than (Leu,Lys)n greater than (Lys)n greater than (Phe,Lys)n greater than (Tyr,Lys)n. The ordered polymer (Ala-Lys-Glu)n was oxidized at only 3% of the rate of (Ala,Lys)n, implying inhibition by peptidyl glutamate. Consistent with this conclusion, kinetic analyses using ordered oligopeptides revealed that, relative to Ala-Ala-Lys-Ala-Ala, Km is increased 9.3-fold for lysine in Ala-Ala-Lys-Glu-Ala-Ala, 2.5-fold in Ala-Ala-Lys-Arg-Ala-Ala, and 1.8-fold in Ala-Ala-Glu-Lys-Ala-Ala. Tyrosine C-terminal to lysine in such peptides also increases Km 5-fold. In addition, lysyl oxidase oxidized lysine in various proteins with basic isoelectric points and was much less or not active against various acidic proteins. Lysyl oxidase was inactive against native bovine serum albumin but effectively oxidized albumin if albumin carboxyl functions were first amidated by chemical modification. These results suggest that peptides bind to lysyl oxidase in a preferred directional sense and indicate-that net anionic character as well as the specific position of anionic residues in substrates can selectively effect substrate potential. Implications of these results for the oxidation of elastin and collagen are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1511576426,"The 22-residue somatostatin (SST-22) from channel catfish, purified by an improved method, is shown to be a glycopeptide. This represents the first report of a glycosylated somatostatin. Multiple forms of SST-22 exist with the major form containing 1 mol of galactose and 1 mol of N-acetylgalactosamine/mol of peptide attached via an O-glycosidic linkage to Thr-5. The position of the carbohydrate was determined by trapping the reactive peptide following beta-elimination of the carbohydrate with [35S]beta-mercaptoethanol followed by sequencing of the radiolabeled protein. All forms of SST-22 that have been purified are identical in amino acid composition. The heterogeneity resides in the carbohydrate portion of the glycopeptide with at least one of the minor forms containing sialic acid. The sequence for SST-22 obtained by automated Edman degradation is Asp X Asn X Thr X Val X Thr X Ser X Lys X Pro X Leu X Asn X Cys X Met X Asn X Tyr X Phe X Trp X Lys X Ser X Arg X Thr X Ala X Cys. This sequence differs at positions 5 and 19 from that published by Oyama et al. (Oyama, H., Bradshaw, R. A., Bates, O.J., and Permutt, A. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 2251-2254). The amino acid sequence reported here is identical to that deduced from the cDNA. The mass ion of SST-22 was determined by fast atom bombardment/mass spectrometry and shown to be 2943 +/- 1 (m/z). The observed mass ion is consistent with the molecular weight predicted from the amino acid sequence plus 1 mol of galactose and 1 mol of N-acetylgalactosamine."

https://openalex.org/W1500925266,"Glutamate is thought to be a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. To study the glutamate receptor and its regulation under carefully controlled conditions, the specific binding of [3H]glutamate was characterized in washed membranes isolated from a neuroblastoma X retina hybrid cell line, N18-RE-105. [3H]Glutamate bound in a saturable and reversible fashion with an apparent dissociation constant, KD, of 650 nM and a maximum binding capacity, Bmax, of 16 pmol/mg of protein. Pharmacologic characterization of the site indicates that it closely resembles the Na+-independent binding site for glutamate found on brain membranes and thought to be an excitatory amino acid neurotransmitter receptor. Thus, while kainate, N-methyl-DL-aspartate, and nonamino acid ligands did not displace [3H]glutamate, quisqualate and ibotenate were potent inhibitors of specific binding. Furthermore, this binding site is regulated by ions in a manner which resembles that described in the hippocampus (Baudry, M., and Lynch, G. (1979) Nature (Lond.) 282, 748-750). Calcium (10 mM) increased the number of binding sites 2.6-fold with no change in receptor-ligand affinity. Lanthanum (1 mM) was the only other cation added which enhanced (3-fold) the binding of [3H]glutamate. Monovalent cations resulted in a decrease in the number of glutamate binding sites. Incubation of membranes in the presence of chloride ions caused a marked increased in [3H] glutamate binding, an effect which was synergistic with that of calcium incubation. Thus, N18-RE-105 cells possess a binding site for [3H]glutamate pharmacologically similar to an excitatory neurotransmitter binding site in brain and which exhibits regulatory properties resembling those previously described in hippocampal membranes, providing an excellent model for mechanistic studies."
https://openalex.org/W1563578729,"The actin-activated Mg2+-ATPase activity of myosin II from the soil amoeba Acanthamoeba castellanii is regulated by phosphorylation of 3 serine residues on the myosin II heavy chain. Partial chymotryptic digestion of 32P-labeled myosin II cleaves from the tail end of the myosin II heavy chain a small peptide which contains all three phosphorylation sites. During purification the phosphorylated peptide is resolved into several different species as a result of heterogeneity both in phosphate content and in size (probably due to chymotryptic cleavage at the carboxyl terminus). However, all forms of the peptide have an identical amino terminus. The sequence of the first 58 residues of the peptide is: N-S-A-L-E-S-D-K-Q-I10-L-E-D-E-I-G-D-L-H- E20-K-N-K-Q-L-Q-A-K-I-A30-Q-L-Q-D-E-I-D-G-T- P40-S-S-R-G-G-S-T-R-G-A50-S-A-R-G-A-S-V-R. The phosphorylated serines are at positions 46, 51, and 56. The first 36 residues of the sequence display a repeating 3-4-3-4 pattern of hydrophobic residues suggesting that this section of the peptide forms an alpha-helical coiled-coil structure. A -Gly-Thr-Pro sequence at residues 38-40 disrupts the alpha-helix and, at the same point, the repeating pattern of non-polar residues is lost. It is likely that the residues extending from Gly-38 to the end of the myosin II tail, which include the 3 phosphorylatable serines, form a randomly coiled or small globular structure. This is the first report of the sequence around the regulatory phosphorylation sites on any myosin heavy chain."
https://openalex.org/W1496466524,"A N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive ATPase was extracted and partially purified from clathrin-coated vesicles of bovine brain.

Phosphatidylserine, but no other commercial phospholipids tested, replaced the brain lipid fraction as activator. Particles depleted of the ATPase exhibited no H+ pump activity when reconstituted with brain phospholipids by the cholate dilution procedure. H+ pump activity was restored by incubating the reconstituted vesicles with the partially purified ATPase."
https://openalex.org/W1546813753,"Glucose transporter proteins (zone 4.5) which had been photoaffinity labeled with [3H]cytochalasin B in human erythrocyte ghosts were subjected to enzymatic dissection in order to study the transmembrane disposition of the protein in situ. Proteolytic enzymes as well as glycosidases were used to treat unsealed and resealed ghosts in order to explore the various membrane domains of the transporter in a topographically defined manner. Limited digestion of sealed ghosts with trypsin had no effect on the apparent Mr of the transporter (55,000). Similar treatment in unsealed ghosts, however, resulted in the generation of a major fragment of 21.5 kDa, along with several minor fragments. Thermolysin also had no effect on sealed ghosts but caused a complete loss of radiolabel from the zone 4.5 region with no lower-molecular-weight fragments being retained on the gel. Chymotrypsin treatment resulted in the generation of a single peak, Mr = 18,400, in both sealed and unsealed ghosts indicating its action occurs at the outer surface. Digestion with carboxypeptidase and aminopeptidase indicate the C-terminal end of the transporter is located exterior to the membrane with the N terminus located at the cytoplasmic surface. Treatment with endoglycosidase resulted in a shift of mobility of the transporter to a lower Mr of 49,000. The results obtained indicate that the carbohydrate is located near the C-terminal end and that the cytochalasin B-binding site is located near the cytoplasmic N-terminal end."
https://openalex.org/W1590098651,"Plasma membranes of many mammalian cells contain a Mg2+-dependent ATPase activity which is easily inactivated by detergents. This activity is the combined expression of at least two ATP-hydrolyzing enzymes (Knowles, A.F., Isler, R.E., and Reece, J.F. (1983) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 731, 88-96). We have purified one of these enzymes from the plasma membranes of a human oat cell carcinoma xenograft. The enzyme was extracted from the membranes by 0.5% digitonin and purified on a DE52 column. The purified enzyme contained a major protein band of Mr = 30,000 when dissociated by sodium dodecyl sulfate. It hydrolyzed all nucleoside triphosphates in the presence of Mg2+ or Ca2+, but showed little activity toward nucleoside diphosphates. The enzyme was inhibited by p-chloromercuriphenyl sulfonate, slowly inactivated by p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyl-5'-adenosine and dithiothreitol at room temperature, and lost activity readily in solutions containing low concentrations of several detergents. This knowledge of the macromolecular structure of the Mg2+(Ca2+)-ATPase and its catalytic properties is important in determining the orientation of the enzyme in the membrane and its physiological function."
https://openalex.org/W1582487874,"A high degree of ATP hydrolytic activity present in purified rat pancreatic acinar cells was localized to plasma membranes. This activity was stimulated almost equally by Mg2+ or Ca2+. Kinetic analysis revealed that the enzyme had a higher affinity for Ca2+ (Kd = 1.73 microM) than Mg2+ (Kd = 2.98 microM) but a similar maximal rate of activity. A comparison of substrate requirements revealed very similar profiles for the Mg2+- and Ca2+-stimulated activities. Combinations of saturating concentrations of Mg2+ or Ca2+ produced the same degree of maximal activity. Investigation of the partial reactions of the ATPase activity revealed two phosphoprotein intermediates (Mr = 115,000 and 130,000) in the presence of Ca2+ and Mg2+. A significant stimulation of the Ca2+-ATPase activity by calmodulin was observed (Kd = 0.7 microM). Calmodulin increased the Ca2+-sensitivity of this enzyme system; Mg2+ appeared to be required for this effect. The Ca2+-ATPase activity was also stimulated by acidic phospholipids. Using an 125I-labeled calmodulin gel overlay technique, calmodulin was shown to bind in a Ca2+-dependent fashion to 133,000- and 230,000-dalton proteins present in the plasma membrane-enriched fraction. Under conditions that favor Ca2+-dependent kinase activity, calmodulin enhanced the phosphorylation of a 30,000- and 19,000-dalton protein. The major ATP hydrolytic activity in pancreatic acinar plasma membranes was present as an ectoenzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1561531581,"The association between clathrin triskelions and the clathrin-stripped membranes of coated vesicles has been investigated using a filter assay to separate bound from unbound clathrin. The filter assay is more sensitive and less cumbersome than a sedimentation assay used previously (1). While confirming the high affinity interaction between clathrin and the vesicle membrane, our results yield Scatchard plots that are curvilinear and consistent with a positively cooperative interaction between clathrin and the vesicle membranes. Controlled digestion with trypsin removes the distal portions of the triskelion legs leaving the proximal 31 nm portions that form the hub of the triskelions. These hubs are trimers of large 112,000- and 124,000-dalton fragments of clathrin heavy chains. They competitively inhibit the binding of 125I-labeled intact triskelions to stripped vesicles with a KI identical to the KD for the association of 125I-labeled intact triskelions to stripped vesicles. Furthermore, these large fragment trimers bind to stripped vesicles with approximately the same high affinity as do intact triskelions and also show evidence of a positively cooperative interaction. It is concluded that clathrin binds to coated vesicles by an interaction that is mediated by the proximal 112,000-dalton fragment of the clathrin heavy chains."
https://openalex.org/W1484547606,"Polyadenylated messenger RNA has been isolated from bovine adrenal medulla and anterior and neurointermediate pituitary gland as well as from human phaeochromocytoma. The mRNAs were translated in the presence of protease inhibitors in the rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system, containing [3H]leucine. The primary translation products were analyzed for chromogranin-like polypeptides by immunoprecipitation with chromogranin A antiserum and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The results show that each of the four mRNAs directed synthesis of a series of chromogranin-like proteins varying in apparent Mr between 25,000 and 120,000. The immunoreactive chromogranins coded by the three bovine mRNAs were of identical apparent Mr while the human chromogranins tended to be slightly larger. A chromogranin A-like polypeptide with apparent Mr = 72,000 was the main immunoprecipitable translation product of adrenal medulla mRNA, while that of anterior pituitary mRNA had a Mr = 87,000, that of neurointermediate pituitary mRNA a Mr = 30,000, and that of human tumor mRNA a Mr = 115,000. The results suggest that the differently sized chromogranins were coded by separate mRNAs and did not derive from a high molecular weight precursor by either nonspecific or specific post-translational protolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1542321578,"The fatty acid reductase complex from Photobacterium phosphoreum has been discovered to have a long chain ester hydrolase activity associated with the 34K protein component of the complex. This protein has been resolved from the other components (50K and 58K) of the fatty acid reductase complex with a purity of greater than 95% and found to catalyze the transfer of acyl groups from acyl-CoA primarily to thiol acceptors with a low level of transfer to glycerol and water. Addition of the 50K protein of the complex caused a dramatic change in specificity increasing the transfer to oxygen acceptors. The acyl-CoA hydrolase activity increased almost 10-fold, and hence free fatty acids can be generated by the 34K protein when it is present in the fatty acid reductase complex. Hydrolysis of acyl-S-mercaptoethanol and acyl-1-glycerol and the ATP-dependent reduction of the released fatty acids to aldehyde for the luminescent reaction were also demonstrated for the reconstituted fatty acid reductase complex, raising the possibility that the immediate source of fatty acids for this reaction in vivo could be the membrane lipids and/or the fatty acid synthetase system."
https://openalex.org/W1584784972,"The antigen recognized by a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb S27) raised against a human renal cancer cell line has been identified as the adenosine deaminase binding protein. mAb S27 immunoprecipitates binding protein purified from a soluble fraction of human kidney. It also recognizes the mature 120,000-dalton membrane form of binding protein from [35S]methionine-labeled human fibroblasts, HepG2 cells, and the renal cancer cell line against which the antibody was raised. A rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against purified kidney binding protein completely precipitates mAb S27-reactive material from labeled membrane extracts. mAb S27 does not precipitate the initially synthesized 110,000 molecular weight precursor of binding protein in fibroblasts and recognizes only a small portion of binding protein precursor in labeled HepG2 cells suggesting that the antigenic determinant recognized by mAb S27 may be a post-translational modification present on the mature form of binding protein or that mAb S27 recognizes molecules in a certain conformation. Glycopeptides derived from purified soluble kidney binding protein or exogenously added adenosine deaminase do not inhibit the immunoprecipitation of binding protein by mAb S27, indicating that the mature oligosaccharide chains of binding protein are not the determinant recognized by mAb S27 and that bound adenosine deaminase does not mask the antigenic sites on binding protein. The fact that monoclonal antibody S27, previously shown (Ueda, R., Ogata, S., Morissey, D. M., Finstad, C. L., Szkudlavek, J., Whitmore, W. F., Oettgen, H. F., Lloyd, K. O., and Old, L. J. (1981) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 78, 5122-5126) to detect a cell surface antigen on cultured renal cancer cells, is directed against the adenosine deaminase binding protein confirms and extends the earlier observation (Andy, R.J., and Kornfeld, R. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 7922-7925) that binding protein is located on the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W1578175546,"It has been possible to specifically label rabbit skeletal muscle actin at Lys-237 with 2,4-pentanedione, producing an enamine. This reaction can be reversed with hydroxylamine. The modification can be carried out with actin in either the G- or F-forms and does not affect polymerization-depolymerization. The modification does affect, however, the interaction of tropomyosin (Tm) with the modified F-actin. In the absence of Ca2+ and Mg2+ (mu = 0.12), Tm failed to bind to the modified F-actin whereas it did bind to unmodified F-actin (1 Tm:7 actins). Tm binding could be restored under these conditions by the addition of either troponin (Tn), Mg2+, or Mg2+ and Ca2+. Under certain conditions, Tm alone has been shown to inhibit actin-activated heavy meromyosin (HMM)-Mg2+-ATPase. This inhibition did not occur with the modified F-actin even though Tm was bound (approximately 1 Tm:7 actins). Even when Tn was added to this system (in the absence of Ca2+), no inhibition of ATPase could be observed. Thus, this modification appears to prevent F-actin X Tm from assuming the blocking inhibitory position (conformation). In addition, Tn appears to enhance the activation of heavy meromyosin-Mg2+-ATPase by the modified F-actin X Tm complex whether Ca2+ is present or not. This state may be analogous to the state (Murray, J. M., Knox, M. K., Trueblood, C. E., and Weber, A. (1982) Biochemistry 27, 906-915) seen with myosin subfragment 1-saturated actin at low ATP levels. Thus, using modified and unmodified F-actin, it is possible to produce three Tm X actin states: off (F-actin X Tm), on (modified F-actin X Tm), and potentiated (modified F-actin X Tm X Tn)."
https://openalex.org/W1590359999,"We studied the binding of 125I-platelet and plasma Factor XIII (125I-Factor XIII) to human platelets. When 125I-Factor XIII was incubated with gel-filtered platelets, calcium chloride (5 mM) and thrombin (1 unit/ml) at 37 degrees C, saturable binding was observed. Half-maximal binding occurred at 1 min. Binding was inhibited 93% by a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled ligand but not by other purified proteins. Greater than 87% of platelet-bound radioactivity migrated as thrombin-cleaved a-chains (a'-chains) in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels indicating that Factor XIIIa but not Factor XIII binds to platelets. 125I-Factor XIIIa does not bind to unstimulated platelets. When platelet secretion was blocked, binding was markedly inhibited. 125I-Factor XIIIa bound minimally to platelets stimulated with agonists other than thrombin. Thus, binding is dependent on platelet activation, as well as modification of platelets by thrombin. 125I-Factor XIIIa bound to gamma-thrombin-stimulated platelets, at concentrations which did not clot fibrinogen. Therefore, Factor XIIIa is not bound to fibrin associated with platelets. Binding was only partially reversible. Approximately 12,000 molecules of Factor XIIIa were bound per platelet. 125I-Factor XIIIa bound normally to platelets from patients with severe Glanzmann's thrombasthenia indicating that 125I-Factor XIIIa does not bind to platelet glycoproteins IIb or IIIa, or platelet-bound fibrinogen. Chymotrypsin treatment of platelets inhibited 125I-Factor XIIIa binding by 78% without inhibiting secretion. Methylamine and putrescine, Factor XIIIa substrates, and N-ethylmaleimide, an active site inhibitor, did not inhibit binding. Factor XIIIa bound to platelets was enzymatically active and catalyzed [3H]putrescine incorporation into platelet proteins. The specific binding of Factor XIIIa to platelets suggests it may play a role in physiologic reactions involving platelets."
https://openalex.org/W1605544636,"CDP-diglyceride, an obligatory intermediate in the biosynthesis of the glycerophospholipids in Escherichia coli, is cleaved in vitro to phosphatidic acid and CMP by a membrane-bound hydrolase. Previous work from our laboratory (Bulawa, C.E., Hermes, J.D., and Raetz, C. R. H. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 14974-14980) has demonstrated that this enzyme also catalyzes the transfer of CMP from CDP-diglyceride to phosphate and numerous phosphomonoesters. We now report the isolation of E. coli mutants which are defective in CDP-diglyceride hydrolase. These mutations, designated cdh, map at minute 88 between pfkA and tpi. This information permitted the identification of a ColE1 hybrid plasmid, pLC16-4, which causes the overproduction of hydrolase activity. The isolation of deletion and Tn10 insertion mutants at cdh suggests that the hydrolase is nonessential for cell growth. Hydrolase mutants are defective in both CDP-diglyceride hydrolysis and CDP-diglyceride-dependent cytidylylation, indicating that both activities are encoded by the cdh gene. Although previously described as a ribospecific enzyme, we have found that incubation of the partially purified hydrolase with [alpha-32P]dCDP-diglyceride and phosphate yields two products, [32P]dCMP and [alpha-32P]dCDP. That a single enzyme utilizes both CDP- and dCDP-diglyceride is demonstrated by the following. (i) The hydrolysis of [alpha-32P]CDP-diglyceride is inhibited by nonradioactive dCDP-diglyceride and vice versa. (ii) Utilization of both liponucleotides is inhibited by AMP. (iii) Mutants in the cdh gene are defective in both CDP- and dCDP-diglyceride hydrolysis, while cdh clones overproduce both activities. (iv) Hydrolase mutants accumulate both CDP- and dCDP-diglyceride."
https://openalex.org/W1553222558,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae glutamine synthetase is inactivated in vivo by the addition of glutamine or ammonia. Inactivation is characterized by a specific loss of synthetase activity; transferase activity remains stable. Several physiological perturbations cause inactivation, such as carbon starvation or limitation for a required amino acid, which could cause a buildup of glutamine. The kinetics of reappearance of synthetase activity after inactivation suggest that the process is reversible in vivo. No change in the native size of the enzyme was associated with inactivation but there appears to be a change in the immunological properties of the enzyme subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1524956945,"Based on their activity as effectors for the ATPase activity of Escherichia coli replication factor Y and as templates for primosome-directed DNA synthesis, single-point mutations in the L- and H-strand primosome assembly sites from pBR322 DNA have been grouped into four classes (Abarzua, P., Soeller, W., and Marians, K. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 14286-14292). In this report, the effect of various ligands on the characteristic activities of primosome assembly site class II mutants has been examined. Both Mn2+ and spermidine can, at low levels, substitute for Mg2+ in the activation of wild-type sites as effectors for factor Y-catalyzed hydrolysis of ATP. Class II mutant sites characteristically require higher levels of these ligands for activation, suggesting that the specific higher order structure of an active primosome assembly site is maintained through base pairing within the single-stranded DNA sequence. This conclusion is supported by the following. 1) Excess levels of the E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein can inactivate wild-type sites at 1 mM Mg2+. Either the addition of NaCl to 80 mM or an increase in the Mg2+ concentration to 5 mM protects against this inactivation. Class II mutant sites, however, cannot be stabilized by 80 mM NaCl at 1 mM Mg2+, and only some class II mutants can be stabilized at 5 mM Mg2+. 2) Active second-site revertants, isolated in vivo and in vitro, of inactive primosome assembly sites containing multiple-base substitutions have mutated to restore lost base pairs in the proposed stem and loop structure of the sites."
https://openalex.org/W1541765379,"The product of bacteriophage P22 gene 12 is known from genetic experiments to be essential for phage DNA replication. The P22 12 protein has been purified to near homogeneity from Escherichia coli lysogenic for lambda-P22 hybrid phage containing the replication genes of P22. The protein has a subunit molecular weight of 46,000. The purified protein contains ATPase activity that is stimulated by single-stranded DNA. The ATPase is poorly stimulated by double-stranded DNA. All four ribonucleoside triphosphates are hydrolyzed; none of the deoxynucleoside triphosphates are hydrolyzed. In addition, the P22 12 protein binds to single-stranded DNA in the presence of ATP. Studies of oligonucleotide synthesis by P22 12 protein in conjunction with E. coli dnaG primase are presented in the succeeding paper (Wickner, S. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 14044-14047)."
https://openalex.org/W1486590870,"The pH dependence of the stability of the clathrin coat structure of coated vesicles and baskets has been evaluated by light scatter and sucrose gradient centrifugation. The influence of several lyotropic (Hofmeister) salts has also been studied by the same methods in order to distinguish between electrostatic and hydrophobic contributions to the free energy of clathrin association. In accord with the Hofmeister ranking, sulfate stabilizes whereas perchlorate destabilizes coat structure. Both types of interactions contribute to the stability of the coat structure in coated vesicles and baskets since both ionic strength and Hofmeister effects have an important influence. The properties of clathrin in both types of particles are similar, with the coat being slightly more stable in coated vesicles than in baskets."
https://openalex.org/W1603643665,"Glutamate is thought to be a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the vertebrate brain. In the preceding paper (Malouf, A. T., Schnaar, R. L., and Coyle, J. T. (1984) J. Biol. Chem. 259, 12756-12762), we demonstrated specific binding of [3H]glutamate to membranes from a neuroblastoma hybrid cell line, N18-RE-105. These sites are pharmacologically and kinetically similar to those seen on rat brain membranes and are regulated by ions added to the isolated membranes. In the current paper, we describe an additional level of regulation for the glutamate receptor in this cell line. Long-term incubation (72 h) of intact N18-RE-105 cells with glutamate (10 mM) results in a 2- to 3-fold increase in [3H]glutamate binding. Scatchard analysis reveals that the increase in binding is due to an increase in the number of glutamate receptors without significant change in their affinity. The ability of glutamate analogs to induce such up-regulation mirrors their ability to compete for [3H]glutamate binding to isolated membranes, suggesting that up-regulation is receptor-mediated. Binding of [3H]glutamate to membranes isolated from cells grown in the presence of glutamate can be further up-regulated by brief exposure (10 min) of the isolated membranes to calcium ions. This suggests that agonist-induced and calcium-induced up-regulation occur via independent mechanisms. The short-term ion-induced up-regulation and the long-term agonist-induced up-regulation described in this paper may model two levels of synaptic potentiation reported to occur in the vertebrate hippocampus. The N18-RE-105 cell line may offer a homogeneous cell type in which to study the molecular mechanisms underlying these phenomena."
https://openalex.org/W1516049332,"Abstract Since agents which affect Ca2+ fluxes have been shown to affect the commitment to terminal differentiation of murine erythroleukemia cells treated with an inducer of differentiation (Bridges, K., Levenson, R., Housman, D., and Cantley, L. (1981) J. Cell Biol. 90, 542-544), we investigated the presence of Ca2+-transport systems in plasma membranes isolated from these cells. Plasma membranes from murine erythroleukemia cells exhibited a high affinity (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase activity with a Vmax of 29 +/- 4 nmol/mg/min and an apparent K0.5 for free Ca2+ of 0.13 microM. This activity was strongly inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by low concentrations of trifluoperazine, compound 48/80, lanthanum, and vanadate with I50 of 29 microM, 1.75 micrograms/ml, 1.5 microM, and 0.4 microM, respectively. The inhibitory effect of compound 48/80 was specifically reversed by exogenously added calmodulin. Phosphorylation of plasma membranes with [gamma-32P] ATP followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoretic analysis at low pH revealed a Ca2+-dependent phosphoprotein with an apparent molecular mass of 138,000 daltons which co-migrated with the Ca2+-dependent phosphoprotein from human erythrocytes and was separable from sarcoplasmic reticulum (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPase. The 32P incorporated into the phosphoprotein could be chased with unlabeled ATP and the protein-phosphate bond was unstable at alkaline pH suggesting an acylphosphate ATPase intermediate like that previously characterized in other (Ca2+-Mg2+)-ATPases."
https://openalex.org/W2111115382,"Glutamine synthetase from Escherichia coli is composed of 12 identical subunits and exists in various forms: unadenylylated, adenylylated, divalent cation bound (taut), and divalent cation free (relaxed). The relaxed dodecamer readily dissociates into monomers upon exposure to 1 M urea or pH 8.0. Glutamine synthetase can be inactivated irreversibly by oxidizing a particular histidine residue or by incubating with methionine sulfoximine and ATP. In order to establish hybridoma monoclones that produce antibodies capable of differentiating between different conformers of glutamine synthetase, homogeneous antibodies produced from 7 clones (10-76-1, 48-76-1, 68-2-1, 57-142-2, 72-104-1, 68-3-2, 57-8-1) were characterized for their binding specificity and effects on glutamine synthetase activity. Two antibodies (10-76-1, 48-76-1) bind only to the monomeric form, two antibodies (57-142-2, 68-3-2) bind only to the dodecameric forms (taut or relaxed) and the three others (68-2-1, 72-104-1, 57-8-1) bind to both forms. At a low antibody concentration, 68-3-2 binds preferentially to taut glutamine synthetase over oxidized glutamine synthetase. None of the 7 antibodies differentiates between unadenylylated and adenylylated form. Nevertheless, the gamma-glutamyltransferase activities of the resulting antibody-glutamine synthetase complexes were influenced variably depending upon the state of adenylylation and the divalent cation."
https://openalex.org/W1543139964,"Evidence for the presence of a functionally important vicinal dithiol in mitochondrial coupling factor B (FB) has been presented earlier (Sanadi, D. R. (1982) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 683, 39-56). FB was completely inactivated by 38 micron of copper o-phenanthroline or 0.63 mM iodosobenzoate, and the kinetics were consistent with intramolecular disulfide formation as were polyacrylamide gel patterns which showed that FB which had been treated with copper o-phenanthroline had a different mobility from that of untreated FB. ATP-Pi exchange activity and ATP-induced binding of bis[3-propyl-5-oxoisoxazol-4-yl]pentamethine oxonol (oxonol VI) to H+ -ATPase were also inhibited by the thiol oxidizing reagents, although oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity was unaffected. F0 isolated from H+ -ATPase rebinds purified F1 with the restoration of ATP-induced oxonol-binding activity. Prior treatment of F0 (but not of F1) with copper o-phenanthroline abolished the oxonol-binding activity of reconstituted F0-F1. 115Cd binds tightly to H+ -ATPase and the bound protein can be recovered by gel electrophoresis in phosphate buffer in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate at a position corresponding to FB. Prior treatment of the H+ -ATPase with copper o-phenanthroline abolished 115Cd binding. The results indicate that the major effect of these inhibitors is on FB dithiol and leave little doubt that Cd2+ is indeed bound to a vicinal dithiol group."
https://openalex.org/W1585202896,"4-Thioflavins react with sulfite under aerobic conditions to yield highly fluorescent products with absorption maxima around 410 nm. These products have been identified as 4-hydroxy-4-sulfonylflavins, and have been shown to arise from a series of reactions following the O2-dependent reoxidation of an intermediate with absorption maxima at 363 and 465 nm. Under anaerobic conditions, the same intermediate is formed, but decays to a 350 nm absorbing species, which is probably the N(5)-sulfite adduct of 4-thioflavin. A plausible mechanism is described for the formation of the derivatives, and several of their chemical and physical properties are described. Distinctly different results between different proteins are obtained when sulfite reacts with enzyme-bound 4-thioflavins. 4-Thio-FAD-D-amino acid oxidase and 4-thio-FMN-lactate oxidase react rapidly to yield the N(5)-sulfite adducts, as occurs with the native enzymes. 4-Thio-FAD-p-hydroxybenzoate hydroxylase reacts slowly in a manner paralleling the reaction with the free 4-thioflavins."
