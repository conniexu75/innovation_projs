https://openalex.org/W2027436298,"Both acute and chronic changes in AMPA receptor (AMPAR) localization are critical for synaptic formation, maturation, and plasticity. Here I report that AMPARs are differentially sorted between recycling and degradative pathways following endocytosis. AMPAR sorting occurs in early endosomes and is regulated by synaptic activity and activation of AMPA and NMDA receptors. AMPAR intemalization triggered by NMDAR activation is Ca2+-dependent, requires protein phosphatases, and is followed by rapid membrane reinsertion. Furthermore, NMDAR-mediated AMPAR trafficking is regulated by PKA and accompanied by dephosphorylation and rephosphorylation of GluR1 subunits at a PKA site. In contrast, activation of AMPARs without NMDAR activation targets AMPARs to late endosomes and lysosomes, independent of Ca2+, protein phosphatases, or PKA. These results demonstrate that activity regulates AMPAR endocytic sorting, providing a potential mechanistic link between rapid and chronic changes in synaptic strength."
https://openalex.org/W2056409809,"We analyzed the mechanism of axonal transport of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), which plays a major role in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Coimmunoprecipitation, sucrose gradient, and direct in vitro binding demonstrated that APP forms a complex with the microtubule motor, conventional kinesin (kinesin-I), by binding directly to the TPR domain of the kinesin light chain (KLC) subunit. The estimated apparent Kd for binding is 15-20 nM, with a binding stoichiometry of two APP per KLC. In addition, association of APP with microtubules and axonal transport of APP is greatly decreased in a gene-targeted mouse mutant of the neuronally enriched KLC1 gene. We propose that one of the normal functions of APP may be as a membrane cargo receptor for kinesin-I and that KLC is important for kinesin-I-driven transport of APP into axons."
https://openalex.org/W2021528981,"Intracellular bacteria and parasites typically invade host cells through the formation of an internalization vacuole around the invading pathogen. Plasmodium sporozoites, the infective stage of the malaria parasite transmitted by mosquitoes, have an alternative mechanism to enter cells. We observed breaching of the plasma membrane of the host cell followed by rapid repair. This mode of entry did not result in the formation of a vacuole around the sporozoite, and was followed by exit of the parasite from the host cell. Sporozoites traversed the cytosol of several cells before invading a hepatocyte by formation of a parasitophorous vacuole, in which they developed into the next infective stage. Sporozoite migration through several cells in the mammalian host appears to be essential for the completion of the life cycle."
https://openalex.org/W1989932452,"Transfer of neuronal patterns from the CA3 to CA1 region was studied by simultaneous recording of neuronal ensembles in the behaving rat. A nonlinear interaction among pyramidal neurons was observed during sharp wave (SPW)-related population bursts, with stronger synchrony associated with more widespread spatial coherence. SPW bursts emerged in the CA3a-b subregions and spread to CA3c before invading the CA1 area. Synchronous discharge of >10% of the CA3 within a 100 ms window was required to exert a detectable influence on CA1 pyramidal cells. Activity of some CA3 pyramidal neurons differentially predicted the ripple-related discharge of circumscribed groups of CA1 pyramidal cells. We suggest that, in SPW behavioral state, the coherent discharge of a small group of CA3 cells is the primary cause of spiking activity in CA1 pyramidal neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2023426126,"Cerebellar LTD requires activation of PKC and is expressed, at least in part, as postsynaptic AMPA receptor internalization. Recently, it was shown that AMPA receptor internalization requires clathrin-mediated endocytosis and depends upon the carboxy-terminal region of GluR2/3. Phosphorylation of Ser-880 in this region by PKC differentially regulates the binding of the PDZ domain–containing proteins GRIP/ABP and PICK1. Peptides, corresponding to the phosphorylated and dephosphorylated GluR2 carboxy-terminal PDZ binding motif, were perfused in cerebellar Purkinje cells grown in culture. Both the dephospho form (which blocks binding of GRIP/ABP and PICK1) and the phospho form (which selectively blocks PICK1) attenuated LTD induction by glutamate/depolarization pairing, as did antibodies directed against the PDZ domain of PICK1. These findings indicate that expression of cerebellar LTD requires PKC-regulated interactions between the carboxy-terminal of GluR2/3 and PDZ domain–containing proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1987294578,"We have purified and characterized a factor, from the conditioned medium of neural stem cell cultures, which is required for fibroblast growth factor 2's (FGF-2) mitogenic activity on neural stem cells. This autocrine/paracrine cofactor is a glycosylated form of cystatin C (CCg), whose N-glycosylation is required for its activity. We further demonstrated that, both in vitro and in vivo, neural stem cells undergoing cell division are immunopositive for cystatin C. Finally, we showed in vivo functional activity of CCg by demonstrating that the combined delivery of FGF-2 and CCg to the adult dentate gyrus stimulated neurogenesis. We propose that the process of neurogenesis is controlled by the cooperation between trophic factors and autocrine/paracrine cofactors, of which CCg is a prototype."
https://openalex.org/W2044825593,"The caspase-8 homologue FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP) functions as a caspase-8 dominant negative, blocking apoptosis induced by the oligomerization of the adapter protein FADD/MORT-1. FLIP expression correlates with resistance to apoptosis induced by various members of the tumor necrosis factor family such as TRAIL. Furthermore, forced expression of FLIP renders cells resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Although FLIP expression is regulated primarily by MEK1 activity in activated T cells, the oncogenic signaling pathways that regulate FLIP expression in tumor cells are largely unknown. In this report, we examined the roles of the MAP kinase and phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase signaling pathways in the regulation of FLIP expression in tumor cells. We observed that the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 reduced FLIP levels in only 2 of 11 tumor cell lines tested. In contrast, disruption of the PI 3-kinase pathway with the specific inhibitor LY294002 reduced Akt (protein kinase B) phosphorylation and the levels of FLIP protein and mRNA in all cell lines evaluated. The introduction of a dominant negative Akt adenoviral construct also consistently reduced FLIP expression as well as the phosphorylation of the Akt target glycogen synthase kinase-3. In addition, infection of the same cell lines with a constitutively active Akt adenovirus increased FLIP expression and the phosphorylation of GSK-3. These data add FLIP to the growing list of apoptosis inhibitors in which expression or function is regulated by the PI 3-kinase-Akt pathway.

Upon engagement by ligand or antibody cross-linking, these receptors trimerize and recruit an adapter protein called FADD (Fas-associated deathdomain) (1Chinnaiyan A.M. Tepper C.G. Seldin M.F.

The resulting multimolecular complex, referred to as a death-inducing signaling complex or DISC, recruits an inactive procaspase called FLICE or caspase-8, which is then cleaved to an active form, initiating a cascade of proteolytic events resulting in the cleavage of numerous proteins essential for DNA repair and the maintenance of cell viability (4Kataoka T. Schroter M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Irmler M. Thome M. Froelich C.J. Tschopp J. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3936-3942PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that FADD multimerization is sufficient to kill some cells even in the absence of TNF family ligands or receptor cross-linking (5Micheau O. Solary E. Hammann A. Dimanche-Boitrel M.-T. J Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7987-7992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). For example, the apoptosis induced by certain chemotherapeutic agents is thought to rely on ligand-independent FADD multimerization, since it can be blocked by a dominant negative FADD (5Micheau O. Solary E. Hammann A. Dimanche-Boitrel M.-T. J Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7987-7992Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data suggest that FADD plays a critical role in apoptosis induced by the cross-linking of DD-containing membrane receptors of the TNF receptor family (e.g. Fas) as well as that resulting from exposure to cytotoxic drugs. Many tumors express Fas (6Houghton J.A. Harwood F.G. Gibson A.A. Tillman D.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 2205-2209PubMed Google Scholar) and TRAIL receptors (7Zhang X.D. Franco A. Myers K. Gray C.

It has been proposed that this resistance is due to the presence of one or more inhibitors of apoptosis (9Rothstein T.L. Wang J.K. Panka D.J. Foote L.C. Wang Z. Stanger B. Cui H. Ju S.T.

Cell Res. 1999; 248: 30-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), have been shown to inhibit the death process, either early on at the level of Fas (FAP-1) or further downstream. FLIP is a cytoplasmic protein that has sequence homology to FLICE. FLIP is capable of binding to FADD yet is unable to be cleaved to an active caspase because of a substitution of a tyrosine for an active site cysteine, thus preventing the initiation of the death pathway (18Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J.

Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 271-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). FLIP has been demonstrated to play a role in the prevention of apoptosis in a number of systems, especially those involving the immune system. Cells with high levels of FLIP relative to FLICE are generally resistant to apoptosis (21Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1541-1548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar), whereas cells with low levels of FLIP relative to FLICE are more sensitive to apoptosis (21Scaffidi C. Schmitz I. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1541-1548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). When naive T cells are initially activated, they express Fas yet are resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis (22Ettinger R. Panka D.J. Wang J. Stanger B. Ju S.-T. Marshak-Rothstein A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4302-4308PubMed Google Scholar, 23Refaeli Y. Parijs L.V. London C.A. Tschopp J. Abbas A.K. Immunity. 1998; 8: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). However, when these T cells are rechallenged with antigen, they become sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis, even though the expression of Fas on the surface of these cells is unchanged. This change in susceptibility to Fas-mediated apoptosis correlated with FLIP levels, which are high during the initial stimulation but significantly reduced upon rechallenge (2Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2113) Google Scholar, 24Algeciras-Schimnich A. Griffith T.S. Lynch D.H. Paya C.V. J.

Interleukin-2 has been shown to markedly enhance the susceptibility of activated T cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis and at the same time down-modulate FLIP (23Refaeli Y. Parijs L.V. London C.A. Tschopp J. Abbas A.K. Immunity. 1998; 8: 615-623Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar), the loss of which may account for the interleukin-2 effect. Recently, the protection from Fas-mediated apoptosis in B cells upon cross-linking of the B cell receptor has been shown to be associated with an increase in FLIP expression (26Wang J. Lobito A.A. Shen F. Hornung F. Winoto A. Lenardo M.J. Eur. J. Immunol. 2000; 30: 155-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, at least for B and T lymphocytes, susceptibility to apoptosis induced by death receptor ligation is governed in part by the level of FLIP. In addition to the ability of FLIP to act as a competitive inhibitor of the binding of caspase-8 to FADD, it has also been shown to induce the activation of NF-κB via TNF receptor-1 through TRADD, TRAF-2, RIP, NIK, and IKK (27Hu W-H. Johnson H. Shu H.-B. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10838-10844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar), thus providing a second anti-apoptotic mechanism for FLIP. Although initially described as a viral product (28Thome M. Schneider P. Hofman K. Fickenscher H. Meinl E. Neipel F. Mattmann C. Burns K. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Scaffidi C. Krammer P.H. Peter M.E. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 386: 517-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar), a cellular analogue of FLIP has since been discovered, and high levels are commonly found in tumors (18Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J.

In one study in melanoma cells, the levels of FLIP were found to correlate inversely with susceptibility to apoptosis induced by exposure to TRAIL (30Griffith T.S. Chin W.A. Jackson G.C. Lynch D.H. Kubin M.Z. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 2833-2840PubMed Google Scholar). However, other studies have failed to identify a linkage between FLIP expression and sensitivity to Fas or TRAIL (7Zhang X.D. Franco A. Myers K. Gray C. Nguyen T. Hersey P. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2747-2753PubMed Google Scholar). Very little is known about the signaling pathways or transcription elements that control the expression of FLIP. In activated T cells, FLIP expression has been shown to be dependent on the ERK/MAP kinase pathway because the addition of a dominant active MKK1 (MEK-1) induces FLIP in 293T and Jurkat cells (31Yeh J.-H. Hsu S.-C. Han S.-H. Lai M.-Z. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1795-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The molecular basis for the high constitutive levels of FLIP observed in many tumor cell lines is unknown. PI 3-kinase has been shown to protect cells from apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner (32Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10792-10797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 33Chen R.H. Su Y.H. Chuang R.L. Chang T.Y.

PI 3-kinase catalyzes the phosphorylation of phosphoinositol-4 phosphate and phosphoinositol-4,5 phosphosphate at the 3 position. Kinases such as PDK1 and pkB/Akt bind to these phosphorylated intermediates via their pleckstrin homology domain. PDK1 in turn phosphorylates and activates pkB/Akt (35Duronio V. Scheid M.P. Ettinger S. Cell. Signal. 1998; 10: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), which then phosphorylates several proteins that have been implicated in the control of cell survival (32Berra E. Diaz-Meco M.T.

Science. 1998; 282: 1318-1321Crossref PubMed Scopus (2735) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of procaspase-9 by Akt, for example, inactivates this protease, blocking the propagation of death signals originating in the mitochondria (39Cardone M.H. Roy N. Stennicke H.R.

In some cells, the anti-apoptotic effect of NF-κB activation is partly attributable to the expression of cIAP, a potent caspase inhibitor (47Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of Forkhead by Akt blocks its activity, reducing the levels of expression of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Fas ligand (46Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S.

These data illustrate the diversity of downstream effectors through which the PI 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway affects cell survival. The ability of a constitutively active MEK1 to induce FLIP expression in T cell lines and the multiplicity of anti-apoptotic proteins in which expression and/or function are regulated through the PI 3-kinase pathway suggest that the constitutive expression of FLIP by tumor cells might be attributable to the activation of either the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK and/or PI 3-kinase pathways. To test these hypotheses, we carried out a series of studies with drugs and a dominant negative kinase that inhibit these pathways. The results of our studies clearly implicate the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway as the predominant regulator of FLIP expression in tumor cells. The human colon adenocarcinomas HT29 and DLD-1, the prostate carcinomas DU145 and PC-3, the breast carcinoma MCF7, the renal carcinomas 786-0 and 769-P, and the melanoma G-361 cell lines were purchased from the ATCC. The human colon carcinoma cell line Clone A was obtained from Dr. Ian Summerhayes of the Lahey Clinic (Burlington, MA), and the breast carcinomas MDA-MB231 and T47D were obtained from Dr. Hava Abraham of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA). The PC-3 cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and the G-361 cells were maintained in Kaign's modification of Ham's F12 media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. All of the remaining cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's modified medium supplemented with glutamine, gentamicin, and 10% fetal bovine serum. The MEK inhibitor PD98059 and the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) and Calbiochem (Lajolla, CA), respectively. The vinculin antibody was purchased from Sigma. The hemagglutinin (HA) antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), and the rabbit anti-pERK and anti-p-GSK3a/b antibodies were obtained from New England Biolabs. The p-Akt (Ser-473) antibody was purchased from BD/PharMingen. The FLIP antibody was generated in New Zealand White rabbits against a peptide spanning amino acids 2–27 (SAEVIHQVEEALDTDEKEMLLFLCRD) of the human protein (48Sata M. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33103-33106Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Cells were treated with 50 μm PD98059 or LY294002 in medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum for the indicated times and then lysed with Passive Lysis Solution (Promega, Madison, WI) supplemented with protease (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and leupeptin) and phosphatase (NaF, Na3VO4, glycerophosphate, and sodium pyrophosphate) inhibitors. Lysates were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the fractionated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose. The top portions of the blots were removed and probed for the cytoskeletal protein vinculin to ensure equivalent loading of all samples. The bottom portions of the blots were probed either for FLIP, pERK, HA, or p-GSK3a/b. The blots were further probed with goat anti-rabbit (FLIP and pERK) or goat anti-mouse (vinculin and HA) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and then exposed to SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). The blots were then exposed to Kodak X-Omat Blue XB-1 film. The films were analyzed by densitometry using a Bio-Rad densitometer and Molecular Analyst software. RNA was isolated from the treated tumor cells using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). RT-PCR was performed (22Ettinger R. Panka D.J. Wang J. Stanger B. Ju S.-T. Marshak-Rothstein A. J. Immunol. 1995; 154: 4302-4308PubMed Google Scholar) using oligonucleotides specific for human FLIP (5′-GAAGTTGACTGCCTGCTGGCTTTCT and 5′-TGGGGCAACCAGATTTAGTTTCTCC) and the ribosomal protein S9 (5′-GATGAGAAGGACCCACGGCGTCTGTTCG and 5′-GAGACAATCCAGCAGCCCAGGAGGGACA). The FLIP oligonucleotides were selected using DNA STAR software to give an annealing temperature of at least 60 °C and to amplify FLIP specifically (i.e. not the homologous caspase-8). [32P]dCTP was incorporated into the products (550 base pairs for FLIP and 431 for S9). The radioactive products were resolved on 4% polyacrylamide gels, dried, and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film. The films were analyzed by densitometry using a Bio-Rad densitometer and Molecular Analyst software. Cell lines were infected with adenoviral constructs bearing HA-tagged catalytically inactive (49Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) or constitutively active Akt (49Fujio Y. Walsh K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16349-16354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) or with the same construct bearing the gene for β-galactosidase at the specified multiplicities of infection. After overnight incubation, the medium was replaced. Six or 24 h later, the cells were then lysed in preparation for Western blot analysis. The human colon carcinoma cell lines HT29, clone A, and DLD-1, the prostate carcinoma cell lines DU145 and PC-3, the breast cancer cell lines MCF7, MDA-MB231, and T47D, the renal carcinoma cell lines 786-0 and 769-P, and the melanoma cell line G-361 all constitutively express FLIP (Fig.1). Because of prior reports linking FLIP expression in T cells to the activation of MEK1 (31Yeh J.-H. Hsu S.-C. Han S.-H. Lai M.-Z. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 1795-1802Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), we sought to determine the extent to which the MAP kinase pathway contributed to the constitutive expression of FLIP in tumor cells. To examine the role of the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway in FLIP expression, tumor cells were first cultured overnight in medium containing 1% FCS and then placed in medium containing 5% FCS with or without the MEK inhibitor PD98059. As shown in Fig. 1 A, ΕRK phosphorylation was readily detectable in both the HT29 and clone A colon carcinoma cell lines after 24 h of serum starvation (zero time point). The readdition of serum transiently enhanced ERK phosphorylation in clone A and, to a lesser extent, in HT29 cells. In both cell lines, the addition of PD98059 (50 μm) for even 15 min completely eliminated ERK phosphorylation as determined by Western blot analysis. The FLIP level declined with time in HT29 but not Clone A cells. Similar studies with all of the other cell lines listed above except the colon carcinoma DLD-1 demonstrated that PD98059, at concentrations sufficient to suppress ERK phosphorylation (50 μm), had no effect on FLIP levels (Fig. 1 B). The DLD-1 cells were similar to the HT29 cells in that their FLIP levels declined, albeit modestly, in response to PD98059. Thus, of the 11 tumor cell lines studied, HT29 and DLD-1 were the only cells in which FLIP expression appeared to be linked to sustained MEK activity. To assess the role of the PI 3-kinase pathway in the regulation of FLIP levels, four of the tumor cell lines were cultured in fresh medium containing or lacking the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002. As shown in Fig. 2, the addition of fresh medium increased the levels of p-Akt to a variable extent in each cell line examined, and this increase was blocked by 50 μmLY294002. In each of the tumor cell lines tested, LY294002 down-modulated FLIP expression. In the case of the HT29 cells, this suppressive effect was apparent within 6 h (not shown), whereas in Clone A, MCF7, and DU145 cells, no significant decrement was observed until 24 h. To determine whether the suppressive effect of LY294002 on FLIP protein levels was associated with a decrement in the level of FLIP transcripts, FLIP mRNA levels were analyzed by RT-PCR at various time points after placing the cells in either control medium or medium containing 50 μm LY294002. As shown in Fig.3, the addition of LY294002 resulted in a decline in the level of FLIP mRNA levels. The extent of inhibition at 6 h ranged from 50% of the control for the DU145 and MCF7 cells to as much as 70 and 85% for the Clone A and HT29 cells, respectively, as determined by densitometry. In Clone A, MCF7, and DU145 cells, the FLIP mRNA levels were reduced after only 3 h of exposure to LY294002.Figure 3FLIP and S9 mRNA levels. Cells were treated either with serum alone or with the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 for 3 or 6 h. The lysates were subjected to RT-PCR as described. Data were analyzed by autoradiography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the role of pkB(Akt) in FLIP expression, tumor cells were infected with an adenoviral construct containing an HA-tagged dominant negative form of pkB/Akt. A similar adenovirus containing a β-galactosidase insert was used as a negative control. For the HT29, Clone A, and MCF7 cell lines, infection was carried out with a multiplicity of 300 and an overnight incubation followed by the addition of fresh medium and an additional 24 h of incubation. This protocol had no affect on the viability of these cell lines but proved toxic for the DU145 cells, which were therefore infected at a lower multiplicity of infection (150) and a shorter incubation time (6 h) to prevent significant cell death. In each case, infection of the tumor cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis using an HA-specific antibody to detect the HA-tagged dominant negative pkB/Akt (Fig.4 A). To confirm that this DN-Akt virus actually inhibited the activation of endogenous Akt, we first carried out Western blot analyses using commercially available anti-phospho-Akt antibodies as we had done previously in experiments with LY294002 (Fig. 2). These studies were largely unsuccessful because of unexpected cross-reactivity of the antibodies with the DN-Akt virus. To avoid this confounding artifact, we chose a downstream Akt target, glycogen synthase kinase-3, as an indicator of Akt activity in our cell lines (50Ebert A.D. Wechselberger C. Frank S. Wallace-Jones B. Seno M. Martinez-Lacaci I. Bianco C. De Santis M. Weitzel H.Z. Salomon D.S. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4502-4505PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, GSK-3 phosphorylation was reduced in cells infected with the DN-Akt virus but not in the uninfected control cells or cells harboring the β-galactisodase virus. The extent of inhibition was variable, ranging from almost complete inhibition in the HT29, Clone A, and DU145 cells to 40% for the MCF7 cells, as determined by densitometry. These data indicate that the DN-Akt virus effectively blocks the activity of endogenous Akt. Infection with the DN-Akt virus down-regulated FLIP expression in all of the tumor cell lines tested (Fig. 4 A). This finding corroborates the results of studies with LY294002 implicating the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway as a key regulator of FLIP expression in tumor cells. To verify that the down-regulation of FLIP was not a general effect of adenoviral infection and to further verify the influence of activated Akt on FLIP expression, the same cell lines were infected with an adenovirus containing a constitutively active Akt insert. As shown in Fig. 4 B, infection of each cell line with the constitutively active Akt adenovirus resulted in increased phosphorylation of GSK-3. FLIP expression in each cell line was also increased. In addition to confirming a direct link between Akt activity and FLIP expression, these experiments confirm that the adenovirus was not responsible for observed changes in FLIP expression. The mechanism by which the PI 3-kinase/Akt pathway regulates FLIP expression is yet to be determined. As mentioned previously, Akt has been shown to phosphorylate several transcription factors (e.g. CREB, NF-κB, Forkhead), many of which have been implicated in the expression of genes whose protein products regulate susceptibility to apoptosis. CREB, for example, plays a major role in T cell survival (51Barton K. Muthusamy N. Chanayangum M. Fischer C. Clendenin C. Leiden J. Nature. 1996; 379: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) and is phosphorylated by Akt at the same site phosphorylated by its structurally relative protein kinase A (44Du K. Montminy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 32377-32379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (824) Google Scholar). The Akt substrate Forkhead is involved in the regulation of Fas ligand expression (46Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5454) Google Scholar) and NF-κB in the expression of the caspase inhibitor survivin (47Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). The enhanced expression of survivin is, in fact, thought to be the dominant factor underlying the protective effect of NF-κB activation against apoptosis induced by exposure to tumor necrosis factor (47Wang C.Y. Mayo M.W. Korneluk R.G. Goeddel D.V. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1998; 281: 1680-1683Crossref PubMed Scopus (2584) Google Scholar). It appears likely that one or more factors may be involved in the regulation of FLIP, and studies to determine the role played by these factors in FLIP expression are currently under way. Our results indicate that sustained MEK activity is not essential for FLIP expression in most tumor cell lines as it appears to be in activated T cells. However, FLIP expression is critically dependent upon PI 3-kinase and Akt activity. These data add FLIP to the growing list of survival-related proteins regulated by the PI 3-kinase pathway."

Balduyck M. Albani D. Michalski C. Burnouf T. Mizon J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 190: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The members are composed of a common light chain, bikunin (Bik), and one or two of the three genetically different heavy chains (HC1, HC2, and HC3) (8Salier J.P. Rouet P. Raguenez G. Daveau M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Free bikunin in circulation is excreted rapidly into the urine (9Sugiki M. Sumi H. Maruyama M. Yoshida E. Mihara H. Enzyme. 1989; 42: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) where it is present as the urinary trypsin inhibitor (UTI) (10Proksch G.J. Lane J. Nordschow C.D. Clin. Biochem. 1973; 6: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The serine residue at position 10 of bikunin contains anO-glycosidically linked chondroitin-4-sulfate (CS) chain (11Hochstrasser K. Schonberger O.L. Rossmanith I. Wachter E. Hoppe-Seyler's Z. Physiol. Chem. 1981; 362: 1357-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), to which the C terminal aspartate of a heavy chain is covalently bound via a unique ester bond (12Enghild J.J.

The SHAPs link to HA via an equivalent ester bond, suggesting that the formation of the SHAP-HA complex is a substitution reaction, namely HA replaces the CS of bikunin to link to a heavy chain (Fig.1) (6Zhao M.

Plasma includes an enzyme activity that catalyzes the reaction (13Yoneda M. Kida D. Iwata H. Zhao M. Kimata K. Connective Tissue. 1998; 30: 69-73Google Scholar). Therefore, we might expect that the SHAP-HA complex would be formed once plasma meets HA, thereby contributing to some physiological and pathological processes.This paper attempts to clarify not only the physiological function of the SHAP-HA complex but also that of the ITI family by eliminating their formation in mice in which the bikunin gene has been inactivated.DISCUSSIONThe present results assign a definite physiological function to the SHAP-HA complex, as well as the ITI family, in the process of ovulation and fertilization. It is now clear that the blood has roles in fertilization not only indirectly by transporting hormones and nutrients but also directly by participating in the construction of the expanded cumulus oophorus. The results also provide a new insight into the structure of the cumulus matrix and show directly the importance of the expanded cumulus oophorus in fertilization in vivo.The protease inhibitory activity of bikunin has drawn most of the research attention to the ITI family. A successful example is the clinical application of UTI to the treatment of acute pancreatitis and shock. The inhibitory activities of UTI to cancer metastasis (25Kobayashi H. Shinohara H. Fujie M. Gotoh J. Itoh M. Takeuchi K. Terao T. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 63: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and nephrolithiasis (15Atmani F. Lacour B. Drueke T. Daudon M. Urol. Res. 1993; 21: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) have also been reported. Here, we showed that bikunin is necessary for the formation of the SHAP-HA complex that is essential for fertilization. The finding identifies an important “SHAP-presenting” role for bikunin, i.e. activating (esterifying), transporting, and presenting the heavy chains to suitable recipients under suitable conditions, such as the newly synthesized HA in the expanding cumulus oophorus. Such a role is physiologically most important, because bikunin deficiency itself did not significantly impair ontogenesis. The fact that most bikunin in plasma is linked with the heavy chains (ITI and PαI) (8Salier J.P. Rouet P. Raguenez G. Daveau M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and the released bikunin in circulation is rapidly excreted into urine (9Sugiki M. Sumi H. Maruyama M. Yoshida E. Mihara H. Enzyme. 1989; 42: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), supports this notion.The influx of plasma into preovulatory follicles and the local formation of the SHAP-HA complex recalls similar situations in inflammatory sites, where cytokines stimulate local HA synthesis and induce capillary hyperpermeability to allow the efflux of plasma components. The SHAP-HA complex may also play roles in such inflammatory responses. Indeed, the SHAP-HA complex was found to accumulate significantly in the synovial fluid of patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (6Zhao M. Yoneda M. Ohashi Y. Kurono S. Iwata H. Ohnuki Y.

Studies of the SHAP-HA complex will help us to understand the pathogenesis of such diseases.The molecular mechanism for the construction and metabolism of the HA-rich cumulus matrix is still largely unknown. Its HA-rich nature has been manifested by many studies (22Salustri A. Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13840-13847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Chen L.

Here we demonstrate that the cumulus matrix contains the SHAP-HA complex as an essential component. Previous studies with scanning electron microscopy revealed many trypsin-sensitive granules along with the hyaluronan filament in the cumulus matrix (28Talbot P. DiCarlantonio G. Dev. Biol. 1984; 103: 159-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The N-terminal regions of the heavy chains of ITI have granule appearances (31Blom A.M. Mörgelin M. Oyen M. Jarvet J. Fries E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 298-304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is very likely that the granule-filament structure represents the SHAP-HA complex. Our findings also help explain the previous observations, which showed that ITI and PαI stabilized the HA-rich matrix of cultured cells (32Castillo G.M. Templeton D.M.

The complete shedding of the cumulus cells in Bik−/− mice raised an interesting question about the role of SHAP in the anchoring of the cumulus oophorus matrix on the protein surface of the zona pellucida.We have clarified a molecular mechanism underlying a form of female infertility. It encourages us to survey spontaneous genetic mutations in the infertile women population to identify possible defects in ITI. So far no such case has been reported.

Plasma includes an enzyme activity that catalyzes the reaction (13Yoneda M. Kida D. Iwata H. Zhao M. Kimata K. Connective Tissue. 1998; 30: 69-73Google Scholar). Therefore, we might expect that the SHAP-HA complex would be formed once plasma meets HA, thereby contributing to some physiological and pathological processes. This paper attempts to clarify not only the physiological function of the SHAP-HA complex but also that of the ITI family by eliminating their formation in mice in which the bikunin gene has been inactivated. DISCUSSIONThe present results assign a definite physiological function to the SHAP-HA complex, as well as the ITI family, in the process of ovulation and fertilization. It is now clear that the blood has roles in fertilization not only indirectly by transporting hormones and nutrients but also directly by participating in the construction of the expanded cumulus oophorus. The results also provide a new insight into the structure of the cumulus matrix and show directly the importance of the expanded cumulus oophorus in fertilization in vivo.The protease inhibitory activity of bikunin has drawn most of the research attention to the ITI family. A successful example is the clinical application of UTI to the treatment of acute pancreatitis and shock. The inhibitory activities of UTI to cancer metastasis (25Kobayashi H. Shinohara H. Fujie M. Gotoh J. Itoh M. Takeuchi K. Terao T. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 63: 455-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and nephrolithiasis (15Atmani F. Lacour B. Drueke T. Daudon M. Urol. Res. 1993; 21: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) have also been reported. Here, we showed that bikunin is necessary for the formation of the SHAP-HA complex that is essential for fertilization. The finding identifies an important “SHAP-presenting” role for bikunin, i.e. activating (esterifying), transporting, and presenting the heavy chains to suitable recipients under suitable conditions, such as the newly synthesized HA in the expanding cumulus oophorus. Such a role is physiologically most important, because bikunin deficiency itself did not significantly impair ontogenesis. The fact that most bikunin in plasma is linked with the heavy chains (ITI and PαI) (8Salier J.P. Rouet P. Raguenez G. Daveau M. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), and the released bikunin in circulation is rapidly excreted into urine (9Sugiki M. Sumi H. Maruyama M. Yoshida E. Mihara H. Enzyme. 1989; 42: 31-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), supports this notion.The influx of plasma into preovulatory follicles and the local formation of the SHAP-HA complex recalls similar situations in inflammatory sites, where cytokines stimulate local HA synthesis and induce capillary hyperpermeability to allow the efflux of plasma components. The SHAP-HA complex may also play roles in such inflammatory responses. Indeed, the SHAP-HA complex was found to accumulate significantly in the synovial fluid of patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis (6Zhao M. Yoneda M. Ohashi Y. Kurono S. Iwata H. Ohnuki Y.

Studies of the SHAP-HA complex will help us to understand the pathogenesis of such diseases.The molecular mechanism for the construction and metabolism of the HA-rich cumulus matrix is still largely unknown. Its HA-rich nature has been manifested by many studies (22Salustri A. Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13840-13847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Chen L.

https://openalex.org/W2171795623,"The temporal precision with which EPSPs initiate action potentials in postsynaptic cells determines how activity spreads in neuronal networks. We found that small EPSPs evoked from just subthreshold potentials initiated firing with short latencies in most CA1 hippocampal inhibitory cells, while action potential timing in pyramidal cells was more variable due to plateau potentials that amplified and prolonged EPSPs. Action potential timing apparently depends on the balance of subthreshold intrinsic currents. In interneurons, outward currents dominate responses to somatically injected EPSP waveforms, while inward currents are larger than outward currents close to threshold in pyramidal cells. Suppressing outward potassium currents increases the variability in latency of synaptically induced firing in interneurons. These differences in precision of EPSP-spike coupling in inhibitory and pyramidal cells will enhance inhibitory control of the spread of excitation in the hippocampus."
https://openalex.org/W2067658938,"Animals show behavioral asymmetries that are mediated by differences between the left and right sides of the brain. We report that the laterality of asymmetric development of the diencephalic habenular nuclei and the photoreceptive pineal complex is regulated by the Nodal signaling pathway and by midline tissue. Analysis of zebrafish embryos with compromised Nodal signaling reveals an early role for this pathway in the repression of asymmetrically expressed genes in the diencephalon. Later signaling mediated by the EGF-CFC protein One-eyed pinhead and the forkhead transcription factor Schmalspur is required to overcome this repression. When expression of Nodal pathway genes is either absent or symmetrical, neuroanatomical asymmetries are still established but are randomized. This indicates that Nodal signaling is not required for asymmetric development per se but is essential to determine the laterality of the asymmetry."
https://openalex.org/W1990976146,"In neurosecretory cells, intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) not only acts as the trigger for secretion but also regulates earlier steps in the secretory pathway. Here, a novel approach was developed to control [Ca2+]i over a broad concentration range, which allowed the quantification of three distinct actions of [Ca2+]i on large dense-core vesicle (LDCV) fusion in chromaffin cells from mouse adrenal slices. Basal [Ca2+]i regulated the transfer of vesicles toward a slowly releasable state, whereas further maturation to the readily releasable state was Ca2+ independent. [Ca2+]i levels above 3 microM triggered exocytosis of all readily and slowly releasable vesicles in two parallel, kinetically distinct fusion reactions. In a molecular context, these results suggest that Ca2+ acts both before and after trans-SNARE complex formation to regulate fusion competence and fusion kinetics of LDCVs."

In addressing this issue, rationally designed components of the transcriptional machinery can provide powerful tools for testing our understanding of gene regulation (1Kim J.S. Kim J. Cepek K.L.

In particular, artificial transcription factors, targeted to novel sequences within a given locus and bearing functional domains of the experimenter's choosing, may prove especially useful since they offer the prospect of complete recapitulation of any given activation process using totally defined components. Artificial transcription factors may also provide practical benefits in areas such as medicine and biotechnology. The DNA-binding motif of choice that has emerged for achieving specific recognition of predetermined, desired DNA sequences is the Cys2-His2 zinc finger. Over the past decade, selection and design studies have demonstrated the adaptability of this motif and have yielded simple, powerful strategies for designing zinc finger proteins (ZFPs)1 that can bind specifically to virtually any DNA sequence (4–15). More recently, ZFPs with engineered DNA sequence specificities have begun to be used as artificial transcription factors to regulate endogenous chromosomal genes (16Bartsevich V.V. Juliano R.L. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 17Zhang L. Spratt S.K. Liu Q. Johnstone B. Qi H. Raschke E.E. Jamieson A.C. Rebar E.J. Wolffe A.P. Case C.C. J. Biol.

The growing use of these designed ZFPs has led to an appreciation of the role of chromatin structure in the ability of designed transcription factors to successfully access their target sequences and to function as transcriptional regulators at endogenous loci. In one recent study, a clear discrepancy was noted between the ability of ZFPs to activate transcription from naked reporter DNA and an endogenous chromosomal locus, with only a subset of reporter-active ZFPs successfully up-regulating the endogenous gene (17Zhang L. Spratt S.K. Liu Q. Johnstone B. Qi H. Raschke E.E. Jamieson A.C. Rebar E.J. Wolffe A.P. Case C.C. J. Biol.

Our goal for this study was to identify a panel of ZFPs that could activate the endogenous gene for vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). VEGF-A is an endothelial cell-specific mitogen that is a key inducer of new blood vessel growth, both during embryogenesis and in adult processes such as wound healing (for recent reviews, see Refs.22Yancopoulos G.D.

Consistent with its highly regulated nature, VEGF-A dysregulation plays a role in a variety of medical conditions, including tumor growth, diabetic retinopathy, and ischemic heart and limb diseases. Consequently, VEGF-A would appear to provide an attractive target for both pro- and anti-angiogenic gene therapies using designed artificial transcription factors. In this study, we have made use of engineered Cys2-His2 ZFPs and knowledge of chromosomal structure to achieve activation of the endogenous chromosomal locus containing the gene for VEGF-A. We first used DNase I hypersensitivity mapping analysis to identify accessible regions of the VEGF-A locus conserved across a variety of cell lines from man and rat. This analysis identified four distinct DNase I-accessible regions, of which three were present in the HEK293 cells used for activation studies. Novel ZFPs targeted to sites within the HEK293-specific DNase I-accessible regions were then characterized with respect to their DNA-binding properties and ability to activate VEGF-A expression. We found that each of our designed ZFPs bound its intended target with an apparent Kd of <3 nm and, when linked to the VP16 transcriptional activation domain (41Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar), activated transcription of both the endogenous VEGF-A gene and a transiently transfected native reporter construct containing ∼3 kilobases of the VEGF-A promoter. We also linked our ZFPs to the activation domain from the p65 subunit of NF-κB (42Ruben S.M. Dillon P.J. Schreck R. Henkel T. Chen C.H. Maher M. Baeuerle P.A. Rosen C.A. Science. 1991; 251: 1490-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar) and tested for the capacity to activate transcription of endogenous VEGF-A both alone and in certain combinations with our VP16-linked ZFPs. We found that this strategy yielded eight distinct ZFPs targeted to seven 9-bp sites that activated VEGF-A expression and that, for certain ZFPs, linkage to activation domains from either VP16 or p65 provided differing levels of activation depending on the chromosomal site that is targeted. Furthermore, when certain combinations of our VP16- and p65-linked ZFPs targeted to distinct chromosomal sites were cotransfected, the observed VEGF-A activation was more than additive relative to the activation levels of the individual ZFPs. Finally, we show that the levels of activation achieved by these engineered transcription factors exceeded VEGF-A levels attained during the hypoxic response and that the relative proportions of VEGF-A splice variants produced by this activation closely approximated normal splice variant ratios seen in these cells. The immortalized cell lines used in these studies (HEK293, Hep3B, and H9c2(2-1)) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection, and human primary skeletal muscle cells were obtained from Clonetics Corp. Each line was maintained essentially as recommended by the suppliers. Rat primary cardiac myocytes were recovered from the hearts of day 1 neonatal Wistar-Han rats (Charles River Laboratories) via dissociation with a solution of 115 units/ml type II collagenase and 0.08% pancreatin. They were then purified on a discontinuous Percoll gradient, resuspended in plating medium containing 15% serum, and plated on gelatin-coated plates for 24 h. Cells were maintained in serum-free medium for 24–48 h prior to use in DNase I mapping studies. Nuclei were isolated and treated with DNase I (Worthington) essentially as described (17Zhang L.

Briefly, oligonucleotides encoding α-helix and β-sheet regions of each three-finger protein were assembled using PCR (see Fig. 2, Aand B), and each resultant ZFP gene was cloned into the pMal-c2 plasmid (New England Biolabs Inc.) as a fusion with DNA encoding maltose-binding protein.

In addition, ZFP concentrations for these studies were determined directly by measuring the DNA-binding activity of each ZFP preparation using conditions under which binding is essentially stoichiometric (concentrations of ZFP and target site > 50 × Kd). Using this modified protocol, SP1 exhibits a significantly higher apparent affinity than was determined in previous studies (17Zhang L. Spratt S.K. Liu Q. Johnstone B. Qi H. Raschke E.E.

ZFPs with distinct binding properties were assembled and cloned into the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen) as described previously (17Zhang L. Spratt S.K. Liu Q. Johnstone B. Qi H.

A cytomegalovirus promoter drove the expression of all the ZFPs in mammalian cells. All ZFP constructs contained an N-terminal nuclear localization signal (Pro-Lys-Lys-Lys-Arg-Lys-Val) from SV40 large T antigen, a ZFP DNA-binding domain, an activation domain, and a FLAG peptide (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys). ZFP-VP16 fusions contained the herpes simplex virus VP16 activation domain from amino acids 413–490 (17Zhang L. Spratt S.K. Liu Q. Johnstone B. Qi H. Raschke E.E. Jamieson A.C. Rebar E.J. Wolffe A.P.

ZFP-p65 fusions contained the human NF-κB transcription factor p65 subunit (amino acids 288–548) as the activation domain (42Ruben S.M. Dillon P.J. Schreck R. Henkel T. Chen C.H. Maher M. Baeuerle P.A. Rosen C.A. Science. 1991; 251: 1490-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The effect of ZFPs on human VEGF-A promoter activity was measured using a luciferase reporter construct containing the human VEGF-A promoter. The human VEGF-A-luciferase reporter pGLPVFH was made by inserting a genomic DNA fragment containing 3318 bp of the human VEGF-A promoter and its flanking sequences (nucleotides −2279 to +1039) into the pGL3-basic vector (Promega) between the KpnI and NcoI sites. The translation start codon ATG of the VEGF-A gene was directly fused with the luciferase gene in this construct. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C. Cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 160,000 cells/well 1 day before transfection. The VEGF-A reporter construct and ZFP-VP16 fusion plasmid were cotransfected into the cells via LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendations, using 1.5 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent, 260 ng of the VEGF-A reporter construct, 30 ng of plasmid DNA encoding ZFP-VP16, and 10 ng of the pRL-CMV control plasmid (Promega). The medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium 16 h after transfection. Forty hours after transfection, the medium was removed, and the cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase reporter activity using the dual-luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. HEK293 cells were plated in 24-well plates at a density of 160,000 cells/well and grown as described above. One day later, plasmids encoding ZFP-VP16 fusions were transfected into the cells via LipofectAMINE reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations, using 1.5 μl of LipofectAMINE reagent and 0.3 μg of ZFP plasmid DNA per well. The medium was removed and replaced with fresh medium 16 h after transfection. Forty hours after transfection, the culture medium and the cells were harvested and assayed for VEGF-A expression. VEGF-A protein contents in the culture medium were assayed using a human VEGF-A ELISA kit (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For Western analysis of ZFP protein expression, cells were lysed with Laemmli sample loading buffer, and the lysates were analyzed via electrophoresis on a 10% polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) followed by Western blotting using anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma), which recognizes the FLAG epitope tag of the engineered ZFPs. The Western blots were visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (17Zhang L. Spratt S.K. Liu Q. Johnstone B. Qi H. Raschke E.E. Jamieson A.C. Rebar E.J. Wolffe A.P.

For quantitative RT-PCR analysis of VEGF-A mRNA levels, the cells were lysed, and total RNA was prepared using the RNeasy total RNA isolation kit with in-column DNase treatment (QIAGEN Inc.). RNA (25 ng) was used in real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis using Taqman chemistry on an ABI 7700 SDS machine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously (17Zhang L. Spratt S.K. Liu Q.

Briefly, reverse transcription was performed at 48 °C for 30 min using MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Following a 10-min denaturation at 95 °C, PCR amplification using AmpliGold DNA polymerase was conducted for 40 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s and at 60 °C for 1 min. The results were analyzed using SDS Version 1.6.3 software. The primers and probes used for Taqman analysis are listed in TableI.

Open table in a new tab HEK293 cells were grown in 150-mm dishes and transfected with the pcDNA3 control vector or ZFP using LipofectAMINE reagent according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells and conditioned medium were harvested 40 h after transfection. Total RNA was extracted from the cells using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) followed by an RNeasy total RNA isolation midi-prep system (QIAGEN Inc.). For Northern analysis of VEGF-A mRNA expression, various total RNA samples (30 μg) were resolved on a 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel and blotted onto a Nytran SuperCharge membrane (Schleicher & Schüll). The membrane was hybridized to a 32P-labeled human VEGF-A-165 cDNA antisense riboprobe at 68 °C in UltrahybTMhybridization buffer (Ambion, inc.). After washing with 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 68 °C, the membrane was exposed to film. The same membrane was stripped by boiling in 0.1% SDS and rehybridized with a human β-actin antisense riboprobe. For analysis of multiple splice variants, total RNA samples (0.5 μg) were subjected to 20-cycle RT-PCR using a TitanTM one-tube RT-PCR system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The primers used were 5′-ATGAACTTTCTGCTGTCTTGGGTGCATT-3′ and 5′-TCACCGCCTCGGCTTGTCACAT-3′. The PCR products were resolved on a 3% Nusieve 3:1 agarose gel (FMC Corp. BioProducts), blotted onto a Nytran SuperCharge membrane, and analyzed by Southern hybridization to a 32P-labeled human VEGF-A cDNA probe that recognizes all splice variants. The expected PCR product sizes for VEGF-A-189, VEGF-A-165, and VEGF-A-120 were 630, 576, and 444 bp, respectively. Our chromatin mapping studies encompassed a variety of cell types from man and rat, including both tumor lines and primary cells. The scope of this survey, as well as our choices for some of the cell types tested, was motivated by our goal of developing candidate ZFPs for a variety of pro- and anti-angiogenic gene therapies. We wished to identify any constitutive accessible chromatin regions in the VEGF-A promoter, as well as those specific to medically relevant target tissues and model organisms. We observed a total of four distinct hypersensitive regions. Two of these, centered on approximately bp −550 and +1 of the VEGF-A promoter, were invariably observed in every cell type tested. Fig.1 shows typical experimental results identifying these regions in both man (Fig. 1 A) and rat (Fig. 1 B). Both regions appeared as doublets when viewed at higher resolution (e.g. Fig. 1, A andC). The discovery of an open region centered on bp +1 was somewhat expected, as hypersensitive regions are often observed in the vicinity of sites for transcription initiation (for a review, see Ref. 43Gross D.S. Garrard W.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 159-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar), and this region also contains conserved regulatory elements that have been shown to be important for VEGF-A activation, including targets for SP1 and AP-2 (44Milanini J. Vinals F. Pouyssegur J. Pages G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18165-18172Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). The observation in both man and rat of accessible chromatin in the −550 region was somewhat more surprising, as no regulatory elements have thus far been mapped to this area of the VEGF-A promoter. Interestingly, this region exhibits a high degree of sequence conservation across all species for which VEGF-A promoter sequence is available (man, mouse, and rat) (Fig. 1 F,gray trace), which becomes more pronounced when conservation is considered in terms of regulatory element-sized sequence blocks (Fig. 1 F, black trace). This suggests the possibility that as yet unidentified regulators of VEGF-A transcription may operate via binding to elements in this region. Initial studies in which a DNA fragment containing this region was fused to the promoter of a luciferase reporter indicated that this region exhibitedcis-acting regulatory functions (data not shown). We excluded the possibility that this DNA sequence itself was a more favored substrate for DNase I digestion by performing a control mapping study using purified naked genomic DNA, which indicated no enhanced cutting of this region by DNase I (data not shown). In addition to the constitutive hypersensitive regions found at bp −550 and +1, we identified two other stretches of accessible chromatin that were apparent in only a subset of the cells used in our studies. One of these regions encompassed ∼300 bp centered on the hypoxia response element of VEGF-A and was observed in human primary skeletal muscle cells (Fig. 1 C) and in the Hep3B cell line (data not shown). In contrast, this site was clearly not observed in HEK293 cells (Fig. 1 C). The hypoxia response element encompasses a region of enhanced sequence conservation in the VEGF-A promoter (Fig.1 F) and has been shown to contain several conserved regulatory elements that are required for induction of VEGF-A by hypoxia, including a binding site for hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (38Levy A.P.

Although modifications in postsynaptic glutamate receptor levels have long been hypothesized to be a molecular basis for long-lasting regulation of synaptic strength, direct evidence obtained in the intact brain has been lacking. Here we show that in the adult brain in vivo, synaptic glutamate receptor trafficking is bidirectionally, and reversibly, modified by NMDA receptor-dependent synaptic plasticity and that changes in glutamate receptor protein levels accurately predict changes in synaptic strength. These findings support the idea that memories can be encoded by the precise experience-dependent assignment of glutamate receptors to synapses in the brain."
https://openalex.org/W1998607511,"Kainate receptor activation affects GABAergic inhibition in the hippocampus by mechanisms that are thought to involve the GluR5 subunit. We report that disruption of the GluR5 subunit gene does not cause the loss of functional KARs in CA1 interneurons, nor does it prevent kainate-induced inhibition of evoked GABAergic synaptic transmission onto CA1 pyramidal cells. However, KAR function is abolished in mice lacking both GluR5 and GluR6 subunits, indicating that KARs in CA1 stratum radiatum interneurons are heteromeric receptors composed of both subunits. In addition, we show the presence of presynaptic KARs comprising the GluR6 but not the GluR5 subunit that modulate synaptic transmission between inhibitory interneurons. The existence of two separate populations of KARs in hippocampal interneurons adds to the complexity of KAR localization and function."

Although many components in these microstructures have been identified, the specific function of each component is still poorly understood. In this study, we show that metalloproteases (MMP), MMP-2, -9, and -13 are associated with MV isolated from growth plate cartilage. In addition, we provide evidence that MV contain transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and that MV-associated MMP-13 is capable of activating latent TGF-β. To determine whether MMPs are associated directly with MV, vesicles isolated from growth plate cartilage were sequentially treated with hyaluronidase, NaCl, and bacterial collagenase to remove matrix proteins and other components attached to their outer surface. Finally, the vesicles were incubated with detergent to rupture the MV membrane and expose components that are inside the vesicles. Each treated MV fraction was subjected to substrate zymography, immunoblotting, and substrate activity assay. Whereas active MMP-13 was lost after combined treatment with hyaluronidase and NaCl, MMP-2 and -9 activities were still retained in the pellet fraction even after detergent treatment, suggesting that the gelatinases, MMP-2 and -9, are integral components of MV. In addition, MV contain TGF-β in the small latent complex, and MMP-13 associated with the MV surface was responsible for activation of TGF-β. Since the amount of TGF-β activated by hypertrophic chondrocytes increased with mineral appearance in serum-free chondrocyte cultures, a role for active MV-associated MMPs is suggested in activation of TGF-β seen during late chondrocyte hypertrophy and mineralization of growth plate cartilage.

During mineralization of the growth plate, the first crystal phase forms and grows inside the vesicle lumen. Once these intralumenal crystals have reached a certain size, they rupture the membrane and grow out into the extracellular matrix (3Anderson H.C. Clin. Orthop. Relat.

The process by which this occurs has yet to be defined, but it is plausible to assume that MMPs are likely involved in the degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix for subsequent mineralization. This hypothesis is supported by a previous report suggesting the presence of MMPs in MV isolated from chondrocyte cultures (10Schmitz J.P. Dean D.D. Schwartz Z. Cochran D.L. Grant G.M. Klebe R.J. Nakaya H. Boyan B.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 375-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have reported previously an increased production of active TGF-β by hypertrophic chondrocytes and the involvement of MMP-13 in this process (11D'Angelo M. Pacifici M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1368-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 12D'Angelo M. Sarment D.P. Billings P.C. Pacifici M. Trans. 44th Annu. Meet. Orthop. Res. Soc. 1998; 23: 497Google Scholar). In this report we isolated authentic MV from chick growth plate cartilage and analyzed them for the presence of MMPs and their location within the vesicles. Furthermore, we tested the role of MV, especially MV-associated MMPs, in activation of TGF-β in hypertrophic growth plate cartilage. Prehypertrophic chondrocytes were isolated from day 17 avian upper sterna utilizing microsurgical techniques as described previously (11D'Angelo M. Pacifici M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1368-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Tissue fragments were incubated in 0.25% trypsin and 0.1% crude collagenase mixture in Hanks' buffered saline solution for 3–4 h at 37 °C. Resulting cell suspensions were filtered through a Nitex filter, counted, and resuspended at a density of 5 × 106 cells/ml. Agarose cultures were prepared as described earlier in 2 ml of serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, high glucose (Life Technologies, Inc.), containing 50 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine, 1 mm cysteine, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (complete medium) (11D'Angelo M. Pacifici M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1368-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For alginate bead cultures, cells were resuspended in 0.15 mm NaCl, pH 7.2, and alginate (Keltone LVCRTM, Kelco, NJ) (13Tschan T. Hoerler I. Houze Y. Winterhalter K.H. Richter C. Bruckner P. J.

Cell Res. 1994; 212: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Bead cultures were prepared by extruding the alginate/chondrocyte suspension dropwise through an 18-gauge needle into 102 mm CaCl2 resulting in ∼1 × 105 chondrocytes per bead. Beads were rinsed with 0.15 m NaCl, placed into 35-mm Petri dishes, and covered with 2 ml of complete medium. Conditioned medium was collected and stored at −70 °C until assayed for TGF-β. MV were isolated from juvenile avian tibiotarsal growth plate cartilage by mild trypsin and collagenase digestion and purified by ultracentrifugation as described previously (5Kirsch T. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11462-11469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To remove matrix proteins and other components attached to the outer surface, MV were sequentially treated with 0.25 units of hyaluronidase (Type IV-S, Sigma), 1 m NaCl and 5 units of pure bacterial collagenase from Clostridium histolyticum(Form III, Advanced Biofacture, Lynbrook, NJ) per 150 μg of total MV proteins. To disrupt the vesicle membrane, vesicles were treated with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% CHAPS (Sigma). After each treatment, MV were pelleted by ultracentrifugation, and aliquots were removed for analysis. Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured in each fraction utilizingp-nitrophenyl phosphate as substrate (Sigma 104, Sigma) as described previously (5Kirsch T. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11462-11469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Active TGF-β present in conditioned medium from chondrocytes cultures was determined as stimulation of a TGF-β-responsive plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 promoter construct linked to a luciferase reporter, and values represent luciferase reporter gene activity. This promoter construct was stably transfected in mink lung epithelial cells (PAI/L cells) (16Abe M. Harpel J.C. Metz C.N. Nunes I. Loskutoff D.J. Rifkin D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). Amounts of luciferase activity were determined using Promega Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI) with the Optocomp I luminometer (GEM Instruments, Pineville, NC). To determine the concentration of total TGF-β (latent and active) present in conditioned medium, luciferase reporter gene activity was measured before and after heat inactivation of TGF-β present in conditioned medium at 85 °C for 12 min (17Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Bock G.R. Marsh J. Clinical Applications of TGF-β. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1991: 81-92Google Scholar). To calculate the concentration of latent and active TGF-β present in conditioned medium, standard curves were generated by measuring luciferase reporter gene activity after treating cells with defined concentrations of commercially available active TGF-β2 (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). For transmission electron microscopy (TEM), 150 μg of each MV fraction was pelleted, fixed in Karnovsky fixative, embedded in plastic, sectioned, and viewed and photographed with a JEM100CXII transmission electron microscope as described previously (6Kirsch T. Nah H.-D. Shapiro I.M. Pacifici M. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1149-1160Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Total protein concentration for each MV fraction was determined by the BCA assay (Pierce). 100 μg of each MV fraction were run on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% gelatin as substrate. After washing with 1% Triton X-100 to remove SDS, the gel was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in 100 mm Tris, 1 mmCaCl2, pH 8.0. Coomassie staining resulted in areas of clear bands corresponding to the molecular weight sizes of proteases present in the sample. For immunoblot analysis, 100 μg of each MV fraction were separated on 8–16 or 4–20% Tris glycine, SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels (NOVEX, San Diego, CA). After electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membranes, the membranes were incubated with primary antibodies followed by secondary peroxidase-conjugated antibodies. Specific reactive bands were viewed with the Renaissance Chemiluminescence kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and Kodak X-Omat Blue film. Polyclonal antibodies specific for avian MMP-2 were a kind gift of Dr. James Quigley; polyclonal antibodies specific for avian MMP-13, annexins II, V, and VI were produced as described previously (18D'Angelo M. Yan Z. Nooreyazdan M. Pacifici M. Sarment D.S. Billings P.C. Leboy P.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 678-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 19Kirsch T. Harrison G. Worch K.P. Golub E.E. J. Bone Miner. Res. 2000; 15: 261-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar); polyclonal antibodies specific for TGF-β2 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA. MV fractions after hyaluronidase treatment (200 μg of total protein) were mixed with a fluorescence-labeled gelatin substrate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Samples with or without inhibitors were incubated for 2 h at 37 °C, and the fluorescence was measured at an excitation wavelength of 495 nm and an emission wavelength of 515 nm in a Photon Technology International fluorimeter (South Brunswick, NJ). Inhibitors used include CMT-8, at inhibitor concentrations specific for MMP-13 (this inhibitor was kindly provided by Dr. Brad Zerler, CollaGenex Pharmaceuticals, Newtown, PA)); doxycycline (Sigma), a general inhibitor of collagenases and gelatinases; and 1,10 phenanthroline (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), a general inhibitor of MMP activities. Previously, we demonstrated that hypertrophic chondrocytes maintained in serum-free agarose cultures produced ∼20% active TGF-β after 7 days in culture (11D'Angelo M. Pacifici M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1368-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Increased production of active TGF-β was unexpected since most cell types studied to date produce TGF-β in a latent form (17Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Bock G.R. Marsh J. Clinical Applications of TGF-β. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1991: 81-92Google Scholar, 20Bonewald L.F. Dallas S.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 21Munger J.S. Harpel J.G. Gleizes P.-E. Mazzieri R. Nunes I. Rifkin D.B. Kidney Int. 1997; 51: 1376-1382Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). This result suggests that an increase in active and total TGF-β produced by hypertrophic chondrocytes may be indicative of a role for TGF-β in chondrocyte maturation. To test this hypothesis, pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes were grown in long term serum-free agarose culture, and conditioned medium was isolated at various time points and assayed for TGF-β production using the PAI/L assay. Since only the active form of TGF-β stimulates PAI-1 promoter activity, we first incubated conditioned medium with PAI/L cells to determine the amount of active TGF-β present in conditioned medium. To determine the total amount of TGF-β (latent and active), conditioned medium was first incubated at 85 °C for 12 min to heat-activate latent TGF-β and then incubated with PAI/L cells. A standard curve was generated by incubating PAI/L cells with various defined concentrations of active TGF-β (16Abe M. Harpel J.C. Metz C.N. Nunes I. Loskutoff D.J. Rifkin D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 17Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Bock G.R. Marsh J. Clinical Applications of TGF-β. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1991: 81-92Google Scholar). After 42 days, mineralization in these cultures was evident; bright field microscopy revealed dark areas in these cultures indicative for mineral deposits (Fig. 1 A). When these cultures were maintained for an extended period (up to 82 days), the amount of total TGF-β produced steadily increased and reached a maximum between days 42 and 56 in culture (Fig.1 B). Notably, the proportion of TGF-β produced in an active form steadily increased to reach 100% of the total produced TGF-β by chondrocytes after 49 days in culture. This increased production of active TGF-β also coincides with the induction of mineralization seen in these cultures at day 42 (Fig. 1 A). Mineralization was accompanied by greater than 2-fold increase in total TGF-β produced by the chondrocytes, which peaked at day 56 and slowly returned to basal levels (∼ 1.5 ng TGF-β/5 × 106cells/48 h) at 82 days in culture (Fig. 1 B). Interestingly, at the time of onset of mineralization, ∼100% of the total TGF-β was produced in an active form (Fig. 1 B). The percentage of active TGF-β in these cultures remained high even when the total TGF-β levels returned to basal levels (Fig. 1 B, day 82). These data indicate that the maturation process of prehypertrophic chondrocytes to hypertrophic mineralizing chondrocytes is accompanied by increased production of active TGF-β (11D'Angelo M. Pacifici M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1368-1377Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A previous study has provided evidence that MV isolated from chondrocyte cultures contain MMPs (10Schmitz J.P. Dean D.D. Schwartz Z. Cochran D.L. Grant G.M. Klebe R.J. Nakaya H. Boyan B.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 61: 375-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). An additional study suggested that MV might be involved in TGF-β activation (22Boyan B.D. Schwartz Z. Park-Snyder S. Dean D.D. Yang F. Twardzik D. Bonewald L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28374-28381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that the persistent increase in active TGF-β, which accompanies the initiation of mineralization, may be due to the involvement of MV-associated proteases. To test this hypothesis, we determined which MMPs are associated with authentic MV isolated from hypertrophic growth plate cartilage. Matrix vesicles were isolated from juvenile chicken growth plate cartilage by mild trypsin and collagenase digestion and purified by ultracentrifugation as described previously (5Kirsch T. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11462-11469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TEM analysis revealed that MV were round to oval in size with diameters between 100 and 300 nm (Fig. 2 A, untreated MV). Immunoblot analysis of the MV fractions confirmed the presence of annexins II, V, and VI (Fig. 2 B, untreated MV) and high levels of alkaline phosphatase activity (Fig.2 C, untreated MV). In addition, previous studies have provided evidence that MV are associated with extracellular matrix proteins, including proteoglycans, types II and X collagen (5Kirsch T. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11462-11469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wu L.N.Y. Genge B.R. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1187-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wu L.N.Y. Genge B.R. Lloyd G.C. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1195-1203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These extracellular matrix components can be selectively removed from the vesicle surface without destroying vesicle integrity. Hyaluronidase treatment was shown to remove surface-attached proteoglycans, whereas treatment with 1 m NaCl and pure bacterial collagenase removes surface-attached types II and X collagen (5Kirsch T. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11462-11469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Wu L.N.Y. Genge B.R. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1187-1194Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Wu L.N.Y. Genge B.R. Lloyd G.C. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1195-1203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2 A, sequential treatment with hyaluronidase, NaCl, and collagenase left the MV structure intact. Immunoblot analysis revealed the presence of annexins II, V, and VI in the MV fractions after the various treatments (Fig. 2 B). Furthermore, alkaline phosphatase activity was similar in the untreated MV fraction and MV fractions after the various treatments (Fig.2 C). However, amino acid analysis revealed a significant reduction in hydroxyproline content (0.074 nm) after sequential treatments with hyaluronidase, NaCl, and collagenase compared with untreated MV (0.1324 nm). Finally, we incubated hyaluronidase/NaCl/collagenase-treated vesicles with CHAPS to rupture the MV membrane and expose the nucleational core complex and other intralumenal components. The nucleational core complex has been shown to contain Ca2+, Pi, acidic phospholipids, and associated proteins, such as annexins (24; see also Fig. 2 B), and some alkaline phosphatase activity (see Fig.2 C). TEM analysis confirmed that no intact MV were present after detergent treatment (Fig. 2 A,Hyl/NaCl/Coll/CHAPS MV). When MV fractions were subjected to gelatin zymography, bands with molecular weights consistent with MMP-2, -9, and -13 were present (Fig.3, untreated MV). The band for MMP-13 is rather weak in the zymogram shown in Fig. 3 A. However, a longer incubation of the gels in Tris/NaCl buffer was not possible because of high levels of activities of MMP-2 and -9 in the MV fractions. Thus, Fig. 3 B represents the same area of the gel shown in Fig. 3 A enlarged and contrast adjusted to help visualize the MMP-13 band. Whereas MMP-13 activity was present in MV fractions after hyaluronidase treatment (Fig. 3 B,Hyl), MMP-13 activity was lost after combined treatment with hyaluronidase and NaCl (Fig. 3 B, Hyl/NaCl). In contrast, MMP -2 and -9 activities were still retained in the pellet fraction even after sequential treatments with hyaluronidase, NaCl, collagenase, and detergent (Fig. 3 A, Hyl, Hyl/NaCl, Hyl/NaCl/Coll, and Hyl/NaCl/Coll/CHAPS). The zymograms also revealed one band of activity above and one band below MMP-9 activity. By molecular weight, these bands are the same size as bacterial collagenase which was used to isolate MV from growth plate cartilage. In fact, antibodies against bacterial collagenase recognized bands of these exact molecular weights in MV isolated by our protocol. 2G. Harrison, personal communication. To assess the proportion of active MMP-2, -9, and -13 present in association with MV, MMP activities present in MV fractions were measured in the absence and presence of various MMP inhibitors using a fluorescent gelatin substrate. In these experiments hyaluronidase-treated MV were used which were proteoglycan-depleted, but still contained MMP-2, -9, and -13 activities (see Fig. 3). CMT-8, which at a concentration of 15 μm is a specific inhibitor for MMP-13 (25Sasaki T. Ohyori N. Debari K. Ramamurthy N.S. Golub L.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 878: 347-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), resulted in 9% inhibition of the total activity present in MV (Table I). A higher dose of CMT-8, which inhibits other collagenases and gelatinases in addition to MMP-13 (25Sasaki T. Ohyori N. Debari K. Ramamurthy N.S. Golub L.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 878: 347-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), reduced the MMP activity by 23%. Doxycycline, an inhibitor of MMP-2, -9 and -13, inhibited 56% of the total activity, whereas 1,10-phenanthroline, a metal ion chelator and general inhibitor of MMP activity, depleted 61% of the activity (Table I). These data demonstrate that the majority of MMPs associated with MV are active.Table IActive MMPs associated with authentic MV isolated from growth plate cartilageMatrix vesicle samplecps 1-acps, counts/s.Inhibition%Control Hyl-treated MV2,392,6930MV + 15 μm CMT-82,198,9339MV + 50 μm CMT-81,836,67923MV + 42 μm doxycycline1,063,40056MV + 0.5 mm 1,10-phenanthroline938,20761MV fractions after hyaluronidase treatment (control Hyl-treated MV; 200 μg of total protein) were incubated with a fluorescence-labeled gelatin substrate in the absence or presence of various MMP inhibitors as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fluorescence was measured at excitation/emission wavelengths of 495/515 nm. Inhibitors were added during the incubation period, and percent of inhibition was calculated as compared with control Hyl-treated MV. The data are the average of n = 2 separate MV preparations.1-a cps, counts/s. Open table in a new tab MV fractions after hyaluronidase treatment (control Hyl-treated MV; 200 μg of total protein) were incubated with a fluorescence-labeled gelatin substrate in the absence or presence of various MMP inhibitors as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Fluorescence was measured at excitation/emission wavelengths of 495/515 nm. Inhibitors were added during the incubation period, and percent of inhibition was calculated as compared with control Hyl-treated MV. The data are the average of n = 2 separate MV preparations. Immunoblot analysis with antibodies against avian MMP-13 and -2 confirmed the existence of these MMPs in MV (Fig.4, A and B,untreated MV). We did not confirm the identity of MMP-9 by immunoblot analysis because antibodies against avian MMP-9 are not currently available. However, size, substrate specificity, and EDTA sensitivity in the zymograms clearly indicate the presence of MMP-9 in the MV preparations. Interestingly, immunoblot analysis revealed the presence of both the 58-kDa MMP-13 and smaller degradation products in MV fractions after sequential treatments with hyaluronidase, NaCl, and collagenase where no detectable activity was visible on the zymograms (compare Figs.3 A and 4 A, Hyl/NaCl andHyl/NaCl/Coll). Immunoreactivity for MMP-13 was lost in MV fractions treated with hyaluronidase, NaCl, collagenase and detergent (Fig. 4 A, Hyl/NaCl/Coll/CHAPS) suggesting that MMP-13 is directly associated with MV, but its activity was lost and the protein was partially degraded after the sequential treatments with hyaluronidase, NaCl, and collagenase. This is consistent with our previous findings showing that the bulk of MMP-13 produced by hypertrophic chondrocytes is rapidly degraded to inactive smaller forms (18D'Angelo M. Yan Z. Nooreyazdan M. Pacifici M. Sarment D.S. Billings P.C. Leboy P.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 678-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In contrast, immunoblot analysis and zymography revealed the presence of MMP-2 in MV pellets after all treatments (compare Figs.3 A and 4 B). In addition, as shown in Fig.3 A, MMP-9 activity is retained in the MV pellet fraction after all treatments, indicating that MMP-2 and -9 appear to be integral components of MV and that the various treatments do not affect their activities. To determine whether MV are the site of TGF-β activation, we first investigated whether TGF-β is associated with MV. The total amount of TGF-β present in the MV fractions was assayed with the PAI/L assay after incubation of MV fractions at 85 °C to heat-activate TGF-β as described above (16Abe M. Harpel J.C. Metz C.N. Nunes I. Loskutoff D.J. Rifkin D.B. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 216: 276-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar, 17Miyazono K. Heldin C.-H. Bock G.R. Marsh J. Clinical Applications of TGF-β. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., Chichester, UK1991: 81-92Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts of TGF-β were present in the MV fraction before and after sequential treatments with hyaluronidase, NaCl, and collagenase (0.164 pg/μg MV protein versus 0.183 pg/μg MV protein), whereas following detergent treatment the levels decreased to 0.05 pg/μg MV protein (Fig.5 A). Immunoblot analysis of MV fractions after sequential treatments with hyaluronidase, NaCl, and collagenase revealed the presence of active TGF-β 25-kDa homodimer and the small latent N-terminal peptide of TGF-β (Fig.5 B, lane 1). After detergent treatment the immunoreactive bands for TGF-β were lost (Fig. 5 B, lane 2). These findings suggest that the small latent TGF-β complex is an integral component of MV. The preferred storage form of TGF-β in the growth plate is as a latent complex (20Bonewald L.F. Dallas S.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 55: 350-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). In addition, in preliminary studies we showed that MMP-13, but not MMP-2 or -9, is capable of activating TGF-β from this complex (12D'Angelo M. Sarment D.P. Billings P.C. Pacifici M. Trans. 44th Annu. Meet. Orthop. Res. Soc. 1998; 23: 497Google Scholar). The ability of MV-associated MMPs to activate latent TGF-β was analyzed by assaying the formation of active TGF-β from the latent complex present in conditioned medium from serum-free chondrocyte alginate bead cultures in the presence of MV fractions. Conditioned medium was mixed with MV fractions (150 μg of total protein), incubated overnight at 37 °C, and the amount of active TGF-β determined by the PAI/L method. As shown in Fig.6, addition of MV to conditioned medium caused a 1.8-fold increase in the amount of active TGF-β compared with conditioned medium incubated without MV. However, addition of hyaluronidase/NaCl-treated MV to conditioned medium did not lead to a significant increase in the levels of active TGF-β. We have demonstrated above that hyaluronidase/NaCl-treated MV showed MMP-2 and -9 activity but no MMP-13 activity. Thus, it is plausible that because of the loss of MMP-13 activity, hyaluronidase/NaCl-treated MV are not able to activate latent TGF-β. To explore this possibility further, we determined whether CMT-8 inhibits MV-mediated activation of latent TGF-β. As shown in Fig. 7, the addition of CMT-8 in concentrations of 5 and 15 μm (specific for inhibition of MMP-13) resulted in a significant inhibition of MV-mediated activation of TGF-β.Figure 7MV-associated MMP-13 activates chondrocyte-produced latent TGF-β. MV (150 μg of total protein) were incubated at 37 °C overnight with conditioned medium from chondrocyte cultures containing latent TGF-β in the presence of various concentrations of CMT-8, an inhibitor of MMP-13. The amount of active TGF-β present after 12 h of incubation was determined by the PAI/L assay. Data are the average of four experiments with two different MV preparations; values are means ± S.D.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this study, we demonstrate that authentic MV isolated from chicken growth plate cartilage contain active collagenase, MMP-13, and active gelatinases, MMP-2 and -9. Furthermore, authentic MV not only contain latent and active TGF-β, but these particles are able to activate latent TGF-β present in conditioned medium from chondrocyte cultures. TGF-β activation by authentic MV was inhibited by CMT-8, at concentrations specific for MMP-13 inhibition, suggesting that MV-associated MMP-13 is involved in activating TGF-β in hypertrophic growth plate cartilage. Although Dean et al. (26Dean D.D. Schwartz Z. Muniz O.E. Gomez R. Swain L.D. Howell D.S. Boyan B.D. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1992; 50: 342-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) have shown that MV isolated from chondrocyte cultures contain MMP-2, -9, and -3, the location of these MMPs within the vesicles was not discerned. Vesicles in their study were isolated from avian chondrocytes passaged several times and cultured in monolayer (26Dean D.D. Schwartz Z. Muniz O.E. Gomez R. Swain L.D. Howell D.S. Boyan B.D. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1992; 50: 342-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and thus it is not clear whether these MMPs are integral components of MV or whether these MMPs are associated with extracellular matrix proteins that are present in the vesicle preparations. In this study, we isolated authentic MV from in vivo growth plate cartilage and characterized the major MMP components and their location within these MV fractions. Location of these MMPs was determined using sequential treatments with hyaluronidase, NaCl, and pure bacterial collagenase. These treatments were shown to selectively remove extracellular matrix proteins from the vesicles (5Kirsch T. Wuthier R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11462-11469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MMP-2 and -9 activity was retained in the pellet fraction even after detergent treatment revealing that these MMPs are integral components of MV. MMP-13 activity was lost after hyaluronidase and NaCl treatment. However, immunoblot analysis revealed the presence of degraded products of MMP-13 in the pellet fraction after sequential treatment with hyaluronidase, NaCl, and collagenase, suggesting that MMP-13 is also an integral component of MV. The protein probably got degraded during the sequential treatments, which is consistent with previous findings from our laboratory and other laboratories showing that MMP-13 is very sensitive to in vitro manipulation and is rapidly degraded to inactive smaller forms (18D'Angelo M. Yan Z. Nooreyazdan M. Pacifici M. Sarment D.S. Billings P.C. Leboy P.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 678-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 27Jeffery J.J. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 15-42Crossref Google Scholar). Thus, our data clearly indicate that MMP-2, -9, and -13 are the major MMPs present in MV and that they are integral components of the vesicles. MV have been shown to have the critical role of initiating the mineralization process in growth plate cartilage (3Anderson H.C. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 1995; : 266-280PubMed Google Scholar). The first crystal phase forms and grows inside the vesicle lumen in a protected environment before the crystals rupture the MV membrane and grow out into the extracellular matrix (3Anderson H.C. Clin. Orthop. Relat. Res. 1995; : 266-280PubMed Google Scholar). Extensive matrix remodeling is required for the outgrowth of the crystals from the vesicles into the extracellular matrix. MMP-13 is an interstitial collagenase with high affinity for type II collagen and was shown to cleave type II and X collagen (27Jeffery J.J. Mecham R.P. Matrix Metalloproteinases. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1998: 15-42Crossref Google Scholar). MV-associated MMP-2 and -9 can then further degrade the resulting collagen fragments. The combined action of these MV-associated collagenase and gelatinases might allow rapid matrix remodeling and the release of matrix-bound Ca2+, thereby enabling rapid mineralization of the extracellular matrix. We have shown previously that MMP-13 mRNA is already produced by early hypertrophic chondrocytes, but active MMP-13 protein is only found in late stage hypertrophic chondrocytes (18D'Angelo M. Yan Z. Nooreyazdan M. Pacifici M. Sarment D.S. Billings P.C. Leboy P.S. J. Cell. Biochem. 2000; 77: 678-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). MMP-2 is involved in a cascade resulting in the activation of pro-MMP-13 zymogen (28Knauper V. Will H. Lopez-Otin C. Smith B. Atkinson S.J. Stanton H. Hembry R.M. Murphy G. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1996; 380: 17-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that MV after being released from the plasma membrane of hypertrophic chondrocytes contain MMP-2 and pro-MMP-13 zymogen. MV-associated MMP-2 might then be involved in activating the MV-associated pro-form of MMP-13. Thus, the sensitive and easily degradable active form of MMP-13 would be only activated at the site where its activity is required. Boyan et al. (22Boyan B.D. Schwartz Z. Park-Snyder S. Dean D.D. Yang F. Twardzik D. Bonewald L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28374-28381Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that MV isolated from chondrocyte cultures were capable of activating latent TGF-β. In this study, we confirm and expand their findings and demonstrate that authentic MV isolated from growth plate cartilage are capable of activating latent TGF-β produced by hypertrophic chondrocytes. Furthermore, our data reveal that active TGF-β2 and latency-associated peptide of the small latent TGF-β2 complex are present in authentic MV fractions even after sequential treatment with hyaluronidase, NaCl, and collagenase, suggesting that small latent TGF-β may be directly associated with the outer surface of authentic MV and that the complex may be in close association with MV-associated MMP-2 and -13. In addition, we provide evidence that CMT-8 at concentrations, which specifically inhibit MMP-13 activity, significantly suppressed MV-mediated activation of TGF-β, suggesting that MMP-13 plays a major role in activating TGF-β from its small latent complex. Thus, MV might not only be the site for initiation of mineralization, but they might also be the site for activation of TGF-β in hypertrophic mineralizing growth plate cartilage. Active TGF-β has been shown to be an important factor that promotes early stages of osteoblast differentiation (30Choi J.-Y. Lee B.-H. Song K.-B. Park R.-W. Kim I.-S. Sohn K.-Y. Jo J.-S. Ryoo H.-M.

Chem. 1998; 273: 27091-27096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Thus, MV-associated MMP-2 is involved in activating MV-associated MMP-13. The active form of MMP-13 releases active TGF-β from the MV-associated small latent form of TGF-β. The active TGF-β may then facilitate the differentiation of cartilage-invading preosteoblastic cells to osteoblastic cells, leading to the replacement of cartilage by bone. In conclusion, this study reveals the presence of active MMP-2, -9, -13, and TGF-β in authentic MV isolated from hypertrophic growth plate cartilage and suggests potential roles for these MMPs in matrix remodeling and TGF-β activation during mineralization and bone formation. Thus, MV released from terminal differentiated chondrocytes contain essential components required for initiation of mineralization, matrix remodeling, and subsequent bone formation. For example, they contain the Ca2+ channel-forming annexins II, V, and VI, essential components for formation of the first intralumenal crystal phase; MMPs, required for matrix remodeling; and latent TGF-β which after being activated by MV-associated MMPs may be required for osteoblastic differentiation and the replacement of cartilage by bone. The exact roles of these and other MV components and their potential interactions, however, still have to be elucidated. We thank Gerald Harrison for help with isolation of authentic MV, Sylvia Decker for TEM expertise, and Dr. Brad Zerler (Collagenex) for providing us with CMT-8."
https://openalex.org/W1991723017,"Amyloid precursor protein (APP) generates the beta-amyloid peptide, postulated to participate in the neurotoxicity of Alzheimer's disease. We report that APP and APLP bind to heme oxygenase (HO), an enzyme whose product, bilirubin, is antioxidant and neuroprotective. The binding of APP inhibits HO activity, and APP with mutations linked to the familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) provides substantially greater inhibition of HO activity than wild-type APP. Cortical cultures from transgenic mice expressing Swedish mutant APP have greatly reduced bilirubin levels, establishing that mutant APP inhibits HO activity in vivo. Oxidative neurotoxicity is markedly greater in cerebral cortical cultures from APP Swedish mutant transgenic mice than wild-type cultures. These findings indicate that augmented neurotoxicity caused by APP-HO interactions may contribute to neuronal cell death in Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2033680244,"The CDK9-cyclin T kinase complex, positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb), stimulates the process of elongation of RNA polymerase (Pol) II during transcription of human immunodeficiency virus. P-TEFb associates with the human immunodeficiency virus Tat protein and with the transactivation response element to form a specific complex, thereby mediating efficient elongation. Here, we show that P-TEFb preferentially phosphorylates hSPT5 as compared with the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA Pol II in vitro. Phosphorylation of hSPT5 by P-TEFb occurred on threonine and serine residues in its carboxyl-terminal repeat domains. In addition, we provide several lines of evidence that P-TEFb is a CDK-activating kinase (CAK)-independent kinase. For example, CDK9 was not phosphorylated by CAK, whereas CDK2-cyclin A kinase activity was dramatically enhanced by CAK. Therefore, it is likely that P-TEFb participates in regulation of elongation by RNA Pol II by phosphorylation of its substrates, hSPT5 and the CTD of RNA Pol II, in a CAK-independent manner.

Efficient transcription of full-length proviral DNA of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)1is controlled by the viral protein Tat. Tat is expressed early in the viral life cycle and is essential for viral replication and gene expression (1Cullen B.R. Cell.. 1993; 93: 685-692Google Scholar, 2Emerman M. Malim M.H. Science.. 1998; 280: 1880-1884Google Scholar, 3Jones K.A. Genes Dev... 1997; 11: 2593-2599Google Scholar). Tat recognizes the bulge region of TAR (transactivation response element), an RNA stem-loop structure located at the 5′ end of HIV transcripts (4Feng S. Holland E.C.

Although the precise molecular mechanism by which Tat exerts its transcriptional activation is not completely understood, it has been suggested that Tat stimulates transcription by RNA polymerase (Pol) II predominately at the level of elongation rather than initiation (6Marciniak R.A.

Recent studies indicate that P-TEFb (positive transcription elongation factor b) is a key cellular factor supporting Tat-dependent elongation (8Marshall N.F. Peng J. Xie Z. Price D.H. J. Biol.

Chem... 1998; 273: 13855-13860Google Scholar). P-TEFb efficiently phosphorylates the CTD of RNA Pol II and in fact is associated with elongating RNA Pol II in vitro (16Chen D. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1999; 19: 2863-2871Google Scholar, 17Ping Y.H. Rana T.M. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 7399-7404Google Scholar, 18Isel C. Karn J. J. Mol. Biol... 1999; 290: 929-941Google Scholar). The kinase activity of P-TEFb is sensitive to DRB, an inhibitor of elongation by RNA Pol II. Furthermore, Tat binds specifically to human P-TEFb via a cyclin T subunit (13Wei P. Garber M.E. Fang S.M. Fischer W.H. Jones K.A. Cell.. 1998; 92: 451-462Google Scholar, 14Peng J. Zhu Y. Milton J.T. Price D.H. Genes Dev... 1998; 12: 755-762Google Scholar, 19Garber M.E. Wei P. KewalRamani V.N. Mayall T.P.

A specific cysteine residue, 261 of human cyclin T, is critical for the interaction of Tat with P-TEFb, and rodent cells that encode a cyclin T lacking this cysteine residue are defective for Tat activation (13Wei P.

Finally, depletion of P-TEF from HeLa nuclear extract decreased not only basal transcription but also Tat-dependent transcription elongation (11Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev... 1997; 11: 2622-2632Google Scholar, 24Zhou Q. Chen D. Pierstorff E. Luo K. EMBO J... 1998; 17: 3681-3691Google Scholar). In addition to P-TEFb, Tat-dependent activation of transcription is also regulated by other cellular factors including TAT-SF1 and DSIF (hSPT4 and 5). TAT-SF1 was identified using a partially purified reconstituted reaction that supports Tat-dependent TAR-specific stimulation of elongation (25Zhou Q. Sharp P.A. EMBO J... 1995; 14: 321-328Google Scholar,26Zhou Q. Sharp P.A. Science.. 1996; 274: 605-610Google Scholar). TAT-SF1, a phosphoprotein, contains two RNA recognition motifs and a highly acidic domain at its carboxyl terminus (26Zhou Q. Sharp P.A. Science.. 1996; 274: 605-610Google Scholar). TAT-SF1 binds to Tat, and its overexpression can stimulate Tat-dependent activation in vivo (26Zhou Q. Sharp P.A. Science.. 1996; 274: 605-610Google Scholar, 27Kim J.B. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1999; 19: 5960-5968Google Scholar). In addition, TAT-SF1 forms a protein complex including TFIIF (RAP30), P-TEFb, hSPT5, and RNA Pol II that is thought to mediate Tat-dependent activationin vitro (27Kim J.B. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1999; 19: 5960-5968Google Scholar, 28Li X.Y. Green M.R. Genes Dev... 1998; 12: 2992-2996Google Scholar, 29Wu-Baer F. Lane W.S. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol.

DSIF (hSPT4 and 5) was originally isolated as a factor that renders transcription in vitro inhibitable by DRB (35Hartzog G.A. Wada T. Handa H. Winston F. Genes Dev... 1998; 12: 357-369Google Scholar). DSIF forms a protein complex with the negative elongation factor to inhibit promoter proximal elongation by RNA Pol II (31Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y.

Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H. Cell.. 1999; 97: 41-51Google Scholar). Release from this inhibition is mediated by P-TEFb, specifically through phosphorylation by its DRB-sensitive kinase CDK9 (32Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Watanabe D. Handa H. EMBO J... 1998; 17: 7395-7403Google Scholar, 34Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H. Cell.. 1999; 97: 41-51Google Scholar). DSIF is also important for Tat activation, because nuclear extracts depleted of hSPT5 do not support Tat-dependent elongation in vitro (27Kim J.B. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1999; 19: 5960-5968Google Scholar,29Wu-Baer F. Lane W.S. Gaynor R.B. J. Mol. Biol... 1998; 277: 179-197Google Scholar, 30Parada C.A. Roeder R.G. EMBO J... 1999; 18: 3688-3701Google Scholar). Additionally, overexpression of hSPT5 stimulates Tat-specific activation in vivo (27Kim J.B. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1999; 19: 5960-5968Google Scholar). In yeast, SPT5 increases the efficiency of elongation of RNA Pol II complexes (35Hartzog G.A. Wada T. Handa H. Winston F. Genes Dev... 1998; 12: 357-369Google Scholar). Several studies have also implicated TFIIH in Tat activation (36Garcia-Martinez L.F. Mavankal G. Neveu J.M. Lane W.S. Ivanov D. Gaynor R.B. EMBO J... 1997; 16: 2836-2850Google Scholar, 37Parada C.A.

Fujinaga K. Meyer J. Chamberlin H. Morgan D.O. Peterlin B.M. Genes Dev... 1997; 11: 2645-2657Google Scholar). TFIIH is a general transcription factor that forms a preinitiation complex with RNA Pol II (40Holstege F.C.P. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1999; 96: 2-4Google Scholar, 41Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci... 1996; 20: 346-350Google Scholar, 42Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Egly J.M. Vermeulen W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev... 1996; 6: 26-33Google Scholar, 43Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev... 1998; 62: 465-503Google Scholar). TFIIH is composed of nine polypeptides (p34, p44, p54, p62, CDK7, cyclin H, MAT1, ERCC2, and ERCC3). TFIIH is not only essential for RNA Pol II-dependent transcription but is also important for DNA repair and cell cycle regulation (41Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci... 1996; 20: 346-350Google Scholar, 42Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Egly J.M. Vermeulen W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev... 1996; 6: 26-33Google Scholar). An important component of TFIIH is the CDK7 subunit, which interacts with cyclin H and MAT1 to form CAK (CDK-activating kinase) and phosphorylates the CTD of RNA Pol II (41Svejstrup J.Q. Vichi P. Egly J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci... 1996; 20: 346-350Google Scholar, 42Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Egly J.M. Vermeulen W. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev... 1996; 6: 26-33Google Scholar, 43Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol.

Recent genetic and biochemical evidence strongly suggests that this phosphorylation of the CTD is important for interaction of the CTD with capping enzymes that modify the nascent transcript (45Cho E.J. Takagi T. Moore C.R. Buratowski S. Genes Dev... 1997; 11: 3319-3326Google Scholar, 46Rodriguez C.R. Cho E.J. Keogh M.C. Moore C.L. Greenleaf A.L. Buratowski S. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2000; 20: 104-112Google Scholar, 47Hirose Y. Manley J.L. Genes Dev... 2000; 14: 1415-1429Google Scholar). Surprisingly, these results also showed that the phosphorylation state of the CTD is significantly altered as the polymerase continues to elongate. The CAK, CDK7-cyclin H, is also known to specifically phosphorylate a threonine residue in the T-loop of other CDKs (48Morgan D.O. Nature.. 1995; 374: 131-134Google Scholar, 49Dynlacht B.D. Nature.. 1997; 389: 149-152Google Scholar). This phosphorylation stimulates the activity of these CDK kinases. In this study, we have shown that P-TEFb prefers hSPT5 as a substrate as compared with the CTD of RNA Pol II. Unlike other CDKs, CDK9 is not phosphorylated by CAK but undergoes autophosphorylation. These results suggest that P-TEFb mediates RNA Pol II CTD phosphorylation independent of CAK activity during stimulation of elongation. Kinase assays were performed as described previously (9Marshall N.F. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 12335-12338Google Scholar, 11Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev... 1997; 11: 2622-2632Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μl of kinase reaction contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10 μmATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 50–100 ng of substrates, and 10 ng of purified kinases. The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 5 min. Protein complexes were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Reaction products were quantified by using a PhosphorImager and the ImageQuant program (Molecular Dynamics). Plasmid pBAK-HuCDK9-T1 was kindly provided by D. Price. Recombinant CDK9-cyclin T protein complex was expressed in Hi5 cells by use of baculovirus and was prepared as described previously (11Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev... 1997; 11: 2622-2632Google Scholar, 14Peng J. Zhu Y. Milton J.T. Price D.H. Genes Dev... 1998; 12: 755-762Google Scholar). The full length of CDK9WT (wild type) cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction. CDK9TA and CDK9DN mutant cDNAs were produced by polymerase chain reaction with the following oligonucleotides (only the sense strand): 5′GTCCTGAAGCTGGCAAACTTTGGGCTGGCCCGG3′ for CDK9D167N and 5′CAGCCCAACCGCTACGCCAACCGTGTGGTGACA3′ for CDKT186A (mutation sites are indicated with underlines). These CDK9 cDNAs were again polymerase chain reaction-cloned to fuse in frame into the pFAST-BacHTa vector (Life Technologies, Inc.). Hi5 cells were infected with baculovirus containing these CDK9 cDNAs with histidine tags at the amino terminus. Recombinant CDK9 proteins were purified as recommended by the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). For expression of various recombinant hSPT5 proteins, the following plasmids were polymerase chain reaction-cloned from wild type hSPT5 cDNA and fused in frame into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pET28+a (Novagen): FL (full-length), which contains amino acids (aa) 1–1087 of hSPT5; the amino-terminal domain, which contains aa 1–271 of hSPT5; the middle domain, which contains aa 272–756 of hSPT5; the carboxyl-terminal domain, which contains aa 757–1087 of hSPT5; CTR (C-terminal repeat), which contains aa 757–920 of hSPT5. To prepare histidine-tagged hSPT5 proteins, these DNA constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), and proteins were induced and purified by affinity chromatography with a nickel-conjugated agarose column as recommended by the manufacturer (Novagen). Recombinant TAT-SF1 protein was prepared as described previously (27Kim J.B. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1999; 19: 5960-5968Google Scholar). Purified CAK (CDK7-cylin H) and CDK2-cyclin A proteins were kindly provided by N. P. Pavletich. Western blots were performed as described previously (27Kim J.B. Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Handa H. Sharp P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1999; 19: 5960-5968Google Scholar). Briefly, recombinant proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blots were incubated with each antibody and visualized using an ECL kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Antibodies against CDK9 and the histidine tag were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and used at a dilution of 1:1000. Phosphorylated hSPT5 proteins were prepared by incubation in a P-TEFb kinase assay as described above. Phosphorylated peptides were resolved in a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. With phosphopeptides eluted from the membrane, phosphoamino acid analysis and phosphopeptide mapping were performed as described (50Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem... 1989; 176: 22-27Google Scholar, 51van der Geer P. Hunter T. Electrophoresis.. 1994; 15: 544-554Google Scholar), except that plastic cellulose TLC plates (EM Science) and a Multiphor II electrophoretic system were used (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DRB inhibits transcription at the stage of elongation in vivo(52Sehgal P.B. Darnell J.E. Tamm I. Cell.. 1976; 9: 473-480Google Scholar, 53Tamm I. Hand R. Caliguiri L.A. J. Cell Biol... 1976; 69: 229-240Google Scholar). During transcription in vitro, DRB also selectively inhibits elongation as compared with initiation, probably by suppressing kinase activities such as those responsible for CTD hyperphosphorylation (54Egyhazi E.

Among many CTD kinases, CAK and P-TEFb have relatively well characterized functions in RNA Pol II transcription in vitro. Both kinases are DRB-sensitive (10Mancebo H.S. Lee G. Flygare J. Tomassini J.

Fujinaga K. Meyer J. Chamberlin H. Morgan D.O. Peterlin B.M. Genes Dev... 1997; 11: 2645-2657Google Scholar). As part of the characterization of P-TEFb, the DRB sensitivity of both kinases was examined using baculovirus-expressed P-TEFb (CDK9-cyclin T) and CAK (CDK7-cyclin H). When GST·CTD was used as substrate, the IC50 of DRB was estimated as 2.5 and 20 μm for P-TEFb and CAK, respectively (Fig.1 A). This result suggests that P-TEFb is significantly more sensitive to inhibition by DRB than CAK, which is consistent with previous results (9Marshall N.F. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 12335-12338Google Scholar, 10Mancebo H.S. Lee G. Flygare J. Tomassini J. Luu P. Zhu Y. Peng J. Blau C. Hazuda D. Price D. Flores O.

This observation is also consistent with the inhibition of P-TEFb controlling the DRB-sensitive elongation process both in vivo and in vitro. Approximately 2–5 μm DRB yields a 50% decrease in transcription activity (10Mancebo H.S. Lee G. Flygare J. Tomassini J. Luu P. Zhu Y. Peng J. Blau C. Hazuda D. Price D. Flores O. Genes Dev... 1997; 11: 2633-2644Google Scholar, 11Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev... 1997; 11: 2622-2632Google Scholar). To date, the CTD of RNA Pol II is the best known substrate of P-TEFb. To test whether P-TEFb can phosphorylate other molecules involved in Pol II-dependent transcription, P-TEFb kinase assays were performed with several other substrates: hSPT5, CAK, CDK2-cyclin A, TAT-SF1, and histone H1. GST·CTD was included as a positive control. As shown in Fig. 1 B, P-TEFb phosphorylated both GST·CTD and hSPT5 more efficiently than the other proteins tested. In fact, P-TEFb phosphorylated hSPT5 more effectively than GST·CTD at the same substrate concentration (Fig. 1 B). We therefore further investigated the enzyme-substrate specificity of P-TEFb. Both hSPT5 and GST·CTD proteins were serially diluted to measure theK m value for P-TEFb (Fig. 1 C). The calculated values for hSPT5 and GST·CTD were 18 and 55 nm, respectively. Moreover, because the GST·CTD contains 52 YSPTPSP repeats, each of which is a potential site of phosphorylation, whereas hSPT5 probably contains fewer potential sites, these K m values probably underestimate the preference of hSPT5 as a substrate. To determine the preferential phosphorylation domains of hSPT5 by P-TEFb, hSPT5 was divided into the following three domains: the amino-terminal domain, which is rich in acidic amino acid; the middle domain, which contains KOW motifs similar to those of E. coli NusG proteins; and the carboxyl-terminal domain, which contains CTR heptapeptide repeats (Fig.2 A) (33Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Watanabe D. Takagi T. Hasegawa J. Handa H. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 8085-8092Google Scholar). Each of the recombinant hSPT5 proteins was histidine-tagged and expressed inE. coli (Fig. 2 B). As shown in Fig.2 C, P-TEFb efficiently phosphorylated the carboxyl-terminal domain of hSPT5 rather than the amino-terminal or middle domains, although a low level of phosphorylation of the middle domain was detected. The CTR domain contains multiple serine and threonine residues that could be potential phosphorylation sites by the serine/threonine kinase P-TEFb. To test which amino acids of hSPT5 are phosphorylated by P-TEFb, phosphoamino acid analysis was performed. As shown in Fig. 2 D, 75 and 25% of hSPT5 phosphorylations occurred at the threonine and serine residues, respectively, whereas tyrosine phosphorylation was not observed. To confirm that the CTR is the major phosphorylation domain of hSPT5 by P-TEFb, two-dimensional phosphopeptide mapping was performed with recombinant FL and CTR proteins. FL and CTR phosphopeptides produced by digestion with trypsin were resolved on TLC plates. Most of the separated phosphopeptides of the CTR proteins comigrated with those of the FL protein, suggesting that the high affinity phosphorylation sites of hSPT5 are in the CTR domain. The kinase activities of CDKs can be regulated by several mechanisms. The binding of a cyclin partner is one of the activation processes. Some CDKs are activated by phosphorylation of a specific threonine residue in their T-loop. CAK (CDK7-cyclin H) is responsible for phosphorylation in the T-loop of several CDKs including CDK2, 4, and 6 (48Morgan D.O. Nature.. 1995; 374: 131-134Google Scholar, 49Dynlacht B.D. Nature.. 1997; 389: 149-152Google Scholar). CDK9 shows 39% identity with CDK2, the best characterized kinase whose activity is controlled by CAK. More importantly, CDK9 has a threonine residue at position 186 in the T-loop region that is conserved in the corresponding region of CDK2. Two different point mutants of CDK9 were made to study the functional role of phosphorylation of this site (Fig.3 A). First, threonine 186 of CDK9 was mutated to alanine (CDK9TA), which does not undergo phosphorylation. Second, aspartic acid 167 of CDK9 was mutated to asparagine (CDK9DN), which abrogates its kinase activity. Although catalytically inactive, the latter mutant protein probably folds into a native conformation because it functions as a dominant negativein vivo (10Mancebo H.S. Lee G. Flygare J. Tomassini J. Luu P. Zhu Y. Peng J. Blau C. Hazuda D. Price D. Flores O. Genes Dev... 1997; 11: 2633-2644Google Scholar). These CDK9 mutants were expressed in insect cells by use of the baculovirus system and purified. The kinase activity of CDK9 was enhanced 4–5-fold when bound by cyclin T (Fig.3 B, lanes 1, 2, 5 , and6). As expected, CDK9DN had no kinase activity, whereas CDK9TA had approximately the same activity as CDK9WT. (Note that in Fig. 3 C a lower amount of CDK9TA than CDK9WT was used in the reactions shown in lanes 3 and 7.) In addition, phosphorylation of CDK9 was detected in CDK9WT and CDK9-cyclin T assays (Fig. 3 C, lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6), but it was not detected when CDK9TA was tested. This shows that 1) the CDK9 kinase can undergo autophosphorylation and 2) the primary site of autophosphorylation of CDK9 under these conditions is at Thr-186. In addition, these data indicate that the kinase activity of CDK9 is not strongly dependent upon phosphorylation of the threonine residue in its T-loop.Figure 5Effect of CAK on P-TEFb kinase activity. A, the kinase activity of CDK9-cyclin T and CDK2-cyclin A complexes was examined in the absence or presence of CAK (CDK7-cyclin H). Recombinant hSPT5 (lanes 2 and 3) and GST·CTD (lanes 5 and 6) proteins were used for the CDK9-cyclin T kinase assay. For CDK2-cyclin A kinase, GST·CTD was used (lanes 7 and 8). CAK (CDK7-cyclin H) was incubated with the CDK9-cyclin T complex (lanes 3 and6) and CDK2-cyclin A (lane 8). Positions of phosphorylated hSPT5, GST·CTD, CDK9, and CDK7 are marked.B, quantitation of phosphorylated hSPT5 and GST·CTD fromA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although threonine 186 of CDK9 is dispensable for its kinase activity, it is important to determine whether this conserved threonine of CDK9 could be a substrate for phosphorylation by CAK, which could modulate its kinase activity. Two different approaches were used to test the possibility that CAK could phosphorylate and thus activate CDK9-cyclin T. First, CDK9WT and mutants including CDK9TA and CDK9DN were tested as substrates for CAK. As shown in Fig.4 A, phosphorylation of CDK9WT but not CDK9TA or CDK9DN was observed in the presence of CAK (CDK7-cyclin H). The lack of phosphorylation of CDK9DN or CDK9TA was not due to the loss of CAK activity because CAK could actively phosphorylate histone H1 (Fig. 4 A, lane 2). Therefore, threonine 186 of CDK9 is apparently not a substrate site of CAK, because CDK9DN, which contains this threonine, was not phosphorylated by CAK. Second, the CDK9-cyclin T complex was tested as a substrate instead of a CDK9 monomer in a CAK assay because the associated cyclin might induce a structural change in the T-loop. In parallel, CDK2-cyclin A was used as a positive control for the CAK assay. Confirming previous results, CDK2-cyclin A has negligible ability to autophosphorylate, whereas the level of phosphorylation of CDK2-cyclin A was increased about 68-fold in the presence of CAK (Fig. 4, B and C). Unlike CDK2-cyclin A, phosphorylation of the CDK9 subunit of the CDK9-cyclin T complex was not increased by CAK. (Fig. 4, B andC). These observations strongly suggest that CDK9 is not phosphorylated by CAK at either threonine 186 or any other residue(s). The phosphorylation of CDK9 appears to be due to its autokinase activity. We also tested whether P-TEFb kinase activity might be cooperatively regulated by CAK. In this case, P-TEFb kinase activities were examined using two substrates, hSPT5 and GST·CTD, in the absence or presence of CAK. As shown in Fig. 5, Aand B, CDK2-cyclin A kinase activity was greatly enhanced by CAK (105-fold or more), whereas the P-TEFb kinase activity for either substrate hSPT5 or GST·CTD was barely changed by CAK. When different CDK substrates (GST·CTD (a common substrate of P-TEFb, CAK, and CDK2-cyclin A) and hSPT5 (a P-TEFb-specific substrate)) were compared, each of these kinase combinations showed a similar pattern of substrate phosphorylation. We conclude that the CDK9 kinase activity of P-TEFb is independent of CAK. CDK9 is autophosphorylated on Thr-186 in the T-loop. To test whether this autophosphorylation further activated the kinase, CDK9 was preincubated with ATP to form phosphorylated CDK9. Then the kinase activities of CDK9 with or without preincubation were compared. As shown in Fig.6, the degree of phosphorylation of CDK9 was increased in an ATP preincubation-dependent manner (Fig. 6 A, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). However, the phosphorylation of hSPT5 was not increased by preincubation of CDK9 (Fig. 6, A andB). This observation is consistent with Fig. 3, which showed that CDK9TA had kinase activity. Thus, these data suggest that the phosphorylation of CDK9 is not a critical post-translational modification needed for kinase activity. The results presented indicate that P-TEFb, composed of CDK9 and cyclin T, preferentially phosphorylates hSPT5 as compared with the CTD of RNA Pol II in vitro. Furthermore, the CDK9 kinase is not regulated by CAK even though it contains a conserved threonine common to many CAK-activated CDKs. These results suggest that P-TEFb in a CAK-independent manner could activate Tat-dependent elongation by phosphorylating hSPT5 as well as the CTD of RNA Pol II. The CDK7 kinase of TFIIH probably has at least two distinct functions in cells. Several studies indicate that CDK7 regulates RNA Pol II activity by phosphorylation of its CTD. In addition, because CDK7 phosphorylates the conserved threonine of CDK2 and other CDKs, it is also thought to be a regulator of the cell cycle machinery (48Morgan D.O. Nature.. 1995; 374: 131-134Google Scholar). A functional role for CDK7 in Tat-stimulated elongation is still controversial. Several studies with CAK inhibitors support the idea that CDK7-cyclin H is also important for Tat activation (38Yankulov K. Yamashita K. Roy R. Egly J.M. Bently D.L. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 23922-23925Google Scholar, 39Cujec T.P. Okamoto H. Fujinaga K. Meyer J. Chamberlin H. Morgan D.O. Peterlin B.M. Genes Dev... 1997; 11: 2645-2657Google Scholar). However, there is accumulating evidence that P-TEFb is the major kinase involved in Tat-activated transcription (12Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2000; 20: 2629-2634Google Scholar, 16Chen D. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1999; 19: 2863-2871Google Scholar). Recently, the physical association of elongating RNA Pol II with P-TEFb, but not with CAK, provided strong evidence for the primacy of P-TEFb in Tat-dependent elongation (17Ping Y.H. Rana T.M. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 7399-7404Google Scholar). We have tested whether CAK phosphorylation of the CDK9 component of P-TEFb would modulate the activity of this kinase. This does not appear to be the case, because CDK9 phosphorylation did not increase by incubation with CAK, and the kinase activity of CDK9 was not enhanced by CAK. The finding that a catalytically inactive mutant of CKD9, which is defective for autophosphorylation, was not detectably phosphorylated by CAK is the most direct evidence for the former. CDK9 autophosphorylation was observed with the WT kinase and was inactivated by mutation of threonine 186 to alanine. This change did not alter the kinase activity of P-TEFb for either CTD or SPT5. The observation that the threonine 186 to alanine mutant protein is not autophosphorylated appears to conflict with results reporting that CDK9 will autophosphorylate its carboxyl terminus and that this modification is important for binding to TAR (57Garber M.E. Mayall T.P. Suess E.M. Meisenhelder J. Thompson N.E. Jones K.A. Mol. Cell Biol... 2000; 20: 6958-6969Google Scholar, 58Fong Y.W. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2000; 20: 5879-5907Google Scholar). The explanation may be that the reactions in this study contained lower concentrations of the CDK9 kinase and were incubated for much briefer periods of time than the previous work. We tested whether CAK-partially phosphorylated CTD of RNA Pol II was a preferred substrate for P-TEFb. However, this was not the case, because phosphorylation of GST·CTD by P-TEFb alone was not significantly different from P-TEFb plus CAK. Taken together, it is likely that CAK and P-TEFb work in an independent manner in RNA Pol II-dependent transcription. The kinase activity of P-TEFb is important for CTD phosphorylation of RNA Pol II, which correlates with efficient elongation (9Marshall N.F. Price D.H. J. Biol. Chem... 1995; 270: 12335-12338Google Scholar, 11Zhu Y. Pe'ery T. Peng J. Ramanathan Y. Marshall N. Marshall T. Amendt B. Mathews M.B. Price D.H. Genes Dev... 1997; 11: 2622-2632Google Scholar). DSIF, composed of hSPT4 and hSPT5, was originally purified on the basis of rendering transcription in vitro dependent upon P-TEFb and thus inhibitable by DRB (31Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y.

Furthermore, a newly identified negative elongation factor complex works in conjunction with DSIF to stall elongation of RNA Pol II shortly after initiation (34Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H. Cell.. 1999; 97: 41-51Google Scholar). Extensive studies by Handa and coworkers (32Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Watanabe D. Handa H. EMBO J... 1998; 17: 7395-7403Google Scholar, 33Yamaguchi Y. Wada T. Watanabe D. Takagi T. Hasegawa J. Handa H. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 8085-8092Google Scholar, 34Yamaguchi Y. Takagi T. Wada T. Yano K. Furuya A. Sugimoto S. Hasegawa J. Handa H. Cell.. 1999; 97: 41-51Google Scholar) suggest that P-TEFb stimulates RNA Pol II elongation from this position by CTD phosphorylation. Thus, the kinase activity of P-TEFb alleviates the repression activity of DSIF at an early stage of elongation (32Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Watanabe D. Handa H. EMBO J... 1998; 17: 7395-7403Google Scholar). Many studies have also shown that P-TEFb is critical for HIV-1 Tat-activated transcription elongation (12Price D.H. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2000; 20: 2629-2634Google Scholar). For example, the sensitivity to inhibition by the drug DRB and other compounds of Tat activation of transcription in vivo corresponds to the sensitivity of the kinase activity of P-TEFb but not of other known CDKs (10Mancebo H.S. Lee G. Flygare J. Tomassini J. Luu P. Zhu Y. Peng J. Blau C. Hazuda D. Price D. Flores O. Genes Dev... 1997; 11: 2633-2644Google Scholar). DSIF is also important for Tat activation of elongation, as shown by depleting reactions in vitro of this complex. Other evidence that Spt5 functions in a positive mode in elongation is the phenotype of mutations in this gene in yeast. Loss of function mutants can have a decreased efficiency of elongation (35Hartzog G.A. Wada T. Handa H. Winston F. Genes Dev... 1998; 12: 357-369Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of SPT5 by P-TEFb could be important in Tat activation of elongation. This kinase preferentially phosphorylates the repetitive carboxyl domain of SPT5, which is necessary to observe Tat activationin vitro (56Ivanov D. Kwak Y.T. Guo J. Gaynor R.B. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2000; 20: 2970-2983Google Scholar). The opposing roles of SPT5 in elongation, inhibition, and stimulation could reflect roles in two processes. In the promoter proximal process, SPT4 and 5 (DSIF) stalls polymerase elongation, which is relieved by phosphorylation by P-TEFb probably of the CTD of Pol II (32Wada T. Takagi T. Yamaguchi Y. Watanabe D. Handa H. EMBO J... 1998; 17: 7395-7403Google Scholar). This process has been well documented in vitro for many promoters. A second process, which for HIV is Tat-mediated and dependent upon TAR, probably forms after polymerase has elongated beyond the TAR element. This process would depend upon P-TEFb, bound to TAR in the presence of Tat, interacting with SPT5, probably by phosphorylation, to stimulate elongation over long segments of the template. The existence of two P-TEFb-dependent processes would be consistent with the results of Fong and Zhou (58Fong Y.W. Zhou Q. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2000; 20: 5879-5907Google Scholar) and would explain why cyclin T from sources other than humans can function in general transcription from the HIV promoter, but only human cyclin T can function in Tat-dependent stimulation of transcription (14Peng J. Zhu Y. Milton J.T. Price D.H. Genes Dev... 1998; 12: 755-762Google Scholar). Finally, recent evidence showing that SPT5 and SPT6 are associated with elongating polymerase, whereas SPT4 and SPT5 (as DSIF) are adequate for promoter proximal events, further supports two roles for SPT5 (59Kaplan C.D.

https://openalex.org/W1966217930,"Glutamate transporters are believed to remove glutamate from the synaptic cleft only slowly because they cycle slowly. However, we show that when glutamate binds to postsynaptic transporters at the cerebellar climbing fiber synapse, it evokes a conformation change and inward current that reflect glutamate removal from the synaptic cleft within a few milliseconds, a time scale much faster than the overall cycle time. Contrary to present models, glutamate removal does not require binding of an extracellular proton, and the time course of transporter anion conductance activation differs from that of glutamate removal. The charge movement associated with glutamate removal is consistent with the majority of synaptically released glutamate being removed from the synaptic cleft by postsynaptic transporters."

STATs are activated and translocated to the nucleus in response to signals that activate the Janus kinase group of tyrosine kinases (37Darnell Jr., J.E. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1996; 51: 391-403PubMed Google Scholar). A third cis element, called the serum response element (SRE), mediates c-fos induction by growth factors, cytokines, and other extracellular stimuli that activate MAPK pathways (30Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 31Karin M. Hunter T. Curr.

SRE is recognized by a dimer of the serum response factor (SRF), whose binding recruits the monomeric ternary complex factors (TCFs) that cannot bind SRE alone (30Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). TCFs have at least three members, including SAP1 (SRF accessory protein), Elk-1, and SAP2, that form a subgroup of the Ets family of transcription factors (30Karin M. Curr. Opin.

Jurutka P.W. Haussler M.R. St-Arnaud R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 584-592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies have also demonstrated that another member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, estrogen receptor α (ERα), also mediates 17β-estradiol (E2)-activated expression of c-fos, which is induced as an immediate early gene in ERα-positive breast cancer cell lines (22Wilding G.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1981-1990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Research in this laboratory showed that interaction of an ERα-Sp1 complex with a GC-rich site in the distal region (39Duan R. Porter W. Safe S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1981-1990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the c-fos gene promoter was required for estrogen action in breast cancer cells. Further analysis of this promoter for elements required for growth factor and hormone responsiveness showed that transactivation by both mitogens was observed using constructs containing the SRE. ERα activation through the SRE involved the MAPK signaling pathway and subsequent phosphorylation of Elk-1 and showed that hormone-induced c-fos expression in breast cancer cells involves ERα action at two elements (GC-rich and SRE) that do not require direct receptor/DNA interactions. MCF-7, MDA-MBA-231, and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Cells were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium with phenol red and supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum plus 10 ml of antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Sigma) in an air/carbon dioxide (95:5) atmosphere at 37 °C. For transient transfection studies, cells were grown for 1 day in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium without phenol red and 5% fetal bovine serum treated with dextran-coated charcoal. The wild-type human ER (hER) expression plasmid was provided by Dr. Ming-Jer Tsai (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). the IGF-1 receptor antagonist, H1356 (amino acids CYAAPLKPAKSC) (40Pietrzkowski Z. Wernicke D. Porcu P. Jameson B.A. Baserga R. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 6447-6451PubMed Google Scholar) was provided by Sigma-Genosys. Human recombinant TGF-α, IGF-1, and E2 were purchased from Sigma, and PD98059 was purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. SRF, SAP1, Elk-1, and ERK1 antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Active ERK1 antibody was purchased from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI). The ER deletion mutants HE11, HE15, and HE19 were provided by Dr. Pierre Chambon (Institut de Génétique et de Biologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, Illkirch, France). The dominant negative (dn) Elk, dn Ras N17, and inhibitory MAPK expression plasmids were kindly provided by Dr. Roger Davis (University of Massachusetts, Worcester, MA), Dr. Joseph Baldassare (St. Louis University, St. Louis, MO), and Dr. Arthur Gutierrez-Hartmann (University of Colorado, Denver, CO), respectively. The plasmids GAL-ElkC and GAL-ElkC(383/389) were received from Dr. Roger Treisman (Imperial Cancer Research Center, London, United Kingdom). pFC2-BLCAT plasmid, which contains the −1400 to +41 5′-flanking sequence from the human c-fos gene linked to a bacterial CAT reporter gene, was kindly provided by Dr. Alessandro Weisz (Universita di Napoli, Naples, Italy) (23Weisz A. Bresciani F. Crit. Rev. Oncog. 1993; 4: 361-388PubMed Google Scholar). ICI 182,780 was provided by Alan Wakeling (Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Macclesfield, UK). Me2SO was used as solvent for E2 and the antiestrogens. All other chemicals and biochemicals were of the highest quality available from commercial sources. Oligonucleotides derived from the c-fos protooncogene promoter and other oligonucleotides were synthesized by the Gene Technologies Laboratory, Texas A & M University (College Station, TX). The complementary strands were annealed, and the 5′-overhangs were used for cloning. The structures of these oligonucleotides are summarized as follows, and the SIE and SRE sites are underlined (mutations incorporated into mutant oligonucleotides are denoted by asterisks): SS (SIE/SRE) (−354/−296) (sense strand), 5′-AGC TTG AGCAGT TCC CGT CAA TCC CTC CCC CCT TAC ACA GGA TGTCCA TAT TAG GAC ATC TGC G-3′; SRE (−325/−296) (sense strand), 5′-AGC TTA CAC AGG ATG TCC ATA TTA GGA CAT CTG CG-3′; SRE.m1 (−325/−296) (sense strand), 5′-AGC TTG* T*AC T*GT* ATG TCC ATA TTA GGA CAT CTG CG-3′; SRE.m2 (−325/−296) (sense strand), 5′-AGC TTA CAC AGG ATG TCG* C*A*A TC*G* C*GA CAT CTG CG-3′; a perfect palindromic 17-mer GAL4 binding site (17M) (sense strand) (41Webster N.

SIE/SRE, SRE, SRE.m1, and SRE.m2 oligonucleotides and five copies of 17M were cloned into the pBLTATA-CAT vector at the HindIII and BamHI sites to give the pSS, pSRE, pSRE.m1, pSRE.m2, and GAL4-CAT constructs, respectively, as previously described. MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and CHO cells were transiently transfected, utilizing the calcium phosphate method with 5 μg of c-fos gene promoter-derived constructs and 2.5 μg (MCF-7 cells) or 5 μg (MDA-MB-231 cells) of wild-type or variant ER expression plasmids plus 1 μg oflacZ expression plasmid as an internal control for transfection efficiency. pCDNA3-Neo (InVitrogen, Inc., Carlsbad, CA) was utilized as an empty vector (control) and was also added in some experiments to maintain uniform levels of added DNA. After 18 h, the medium was changed, and cells were treated with Me2SO (0.2% total volume), 10 nm E2, 10 nm TGF-α, 10 nm IGF-1, 1 μm ICI 182,780, or other compounds or their combinations in Me2SO for 44 h. Cells were then washed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped from the plates. Cell lysates were prepared in 0.15 ml of 0.25 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) by three freeze-thaw-sonication cycles (3 min each). Protein concentrations were determined using bovine serum albumin as a standard, and analysis for CAT activity in cell lysates was standardized to β-galactosidase activity. Lysates were incubated at 56 °C for 7 min to remove endogenous deacetylase activity. CAT activity was determined by incubating aliquots of the cell lysates with 0.2 mCi ofd-threo-[dichloroacetyl-1-14C]chloramphenicol and 4 mm acetyl-CoA. Acetylation was allowed to proceed to <20–25% completion (linear range), and acetylated metabolites were analyzed by TLC. Following TLC, acetylated products were visualized and quantitated using an Instant Imager analyzer. CAT activity was calculated as fraction of that observed in cells treated with Me2SO alone (arbitrarily set at 100), and results are expressed as means ± S.D. The experiments were carried out at least in triplicate and statistical significance was determined by analysis of variance and Scheffe's test. Synthetic oligonucleotides were synthesized, purified, annealed, and32P-labeled as previously described (39Duan R. Porter W. Safe S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1981-1990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA binding was measured using a gel retardation assay. Nuclear extracts from MCF-7 cells treated with Me2SO, 10 nm E2, or 10 nm TGF-α for 30 min were incubated in HEGD buffer (2.5 mm HEPES, 1.5 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1.0 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.6) with poly(dI-dC) (200 ng) for 15 min at 20 °C. The mixture was then incubated for an additional 15 min (20 °C) after the addition of32P-labeled DNA. Aliquots from reaction mixtures were then loaded into a 5% polyacrylamine gel (acrylamide/bisacrylamide, 30:0.8) and electrophoresed at 110 V in 0.9 m Tris borate and 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0. The gel was dried, and protein/DNA interactions were determined and quantitated by scanning on a Betascope 603 blot analyzer imaging system and visualized by autoradiography. Nonphosphorylated and phosphorylated Elk-1 antibodies were purchased from New England Biolabs, and ERα antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The plasmid expressing Elk-1 (from Dr. R. Ianknecht, The Salk Institute) and hER was transiently transfected into MCF-7 cells using calcium phosphate; 18 h after transfection, cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 36 h and were then treated with chemicals and harvested at designated time points. Cells were washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected by scraping in 0.3 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 50 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 mm sodium orthovanadate). The lysates were incubated on ice for 1 h with intermittent vortexing followed by centrifugation (15,000 × g, 5 min). Equal amounts of protein from each treatment group were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (7.5% gel, 150 V) and electrophoresed (15 V, overnight) to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a Bio-Rad Trans-Blot Electrophoretic Transfer Cell and transfer buffer (48 mm Tris, 39 mm glysine, 0.025% SDS). Subsequent procedures followed the manufacturer's recommendation (New England Biolabs). The lysates were also used for immunoblotting for ERKs and active ERKs. However, subsequent procedures followed different manufacturers' recommendations (Promega for active ERKs; Santa Cruz Biotechnology for ERKs and ERα). CHO-K1 cells were subcultured in four-well Lab-Tek chambered slides (Nunc Inc., Naperville, IL) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium without phenol red 5% fetal bovine serum stripped with dextran-coated charcoal. After 24 h, cells were transiently transfected with 1 μg of hER or HE 11 expression plasmids. Transfections were done with SuperFect Transfection Reagent (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA); cells were incubated with DNA-SuperFect Transfection Reagent complexes at 37 °C for 3 h, followed by 24 h of recovery in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/F-12 medium. Prior to fixation, slides were washed three times in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) and then fixed for 10 min at room temperature in 2% paraformaldehyde in DPBS and 0.15m sucrose in the presence or absence of 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for detection of nuclear and membrane ERα, respectively. Slides were subsequently washed three times in DPBS followed by a 10-min incubation in 100 mm ammonium chloride before a 1-h blocking step in 3% normal goat serum (G-9023; Sigma). For nuclear localization of ERα, the rat mAb raised against the ligand binding domain of the human ERα (H222; a generous gift of Dr. Geoffrey Greene) was diluted to a final concentration of 3 μg/ml in DPBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% goat serum, and 0.3% Tween 20. Rat IgG at the same concentration was used as a control. Tween 20 (0.3%) was included in all antibody, blocking steps, and washes for nuclear localization of ERα, whereas it was excluded from all incubations for membrane ERα localization. Following incubation in H222 antibody overnight, cells were washed three times in DPBS. Cells were then incubated for 1 h in a 1:200 dilution fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat-anti-rat IgG (62-9511; Zymed Laboratories Inc., S. San Francisco, CA) in DPBS containing 0.1% goat serum. Cells were then washed six times over a period of 2 h and transferred to distilled water prior to coverslip mounting with ProLong Antifade mounting reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR). For each treatment, representative fluorescence images were recorded using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) equipped with a Hamamatsu chilled 3CCD color camera (Hamamatsu, Japan) using Adobe Photoshop 5.0 (Adobe Systems, Seattle, WA) image capture software. Images from all treatment groups were captured at the same time using identical image capture parameters. Both E2 and growth factors induce c-fos protooncogene expression in MCF-7 cells (22Wilding G.

Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1981-1990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and initial studies showed that in cells transfected with pFC2 (containing the −1400 to +41 region of the c-fospromoter), E2 alone (10–100 nm) induced a maximal 90% increase in CAT activity. 10 nm IGF or TGF-α alone also significantly increased CAT activity in MCF-7 cells transfected with pFC2. In cells treated with 10 nm E2, IGF, or TGF-α plus hERα expression plasmid, the induction was further enhanced compared with treatment with E2, IGF, or TGF-α alone (Fig.1 A). In ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with pFC2, no induction response was observed after treatment with E2 alone; however, E2 induced CAT activity in this cell line after cotransfection with ERα expression plasmid (Fig.1 B). Since cotransfection with ERα enhanced E2 responsiveness in transient transfection assays, ERα expression plasmid was routinely used in studies with the c-fos-derived constructs. Previous studies identified a distal E2-responsive GC-rich site (−1168 to −1161) that was activated through ERα/Sp1 interactions (39Duan R. Porter W. Safe S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 1981-1990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, in MCF-7 cells cotransfected with ERα and pSS containing a more proximal fos gene promoter insert (−354 to −296), both E2 and TGF-α induced reporter gene activity (Fig. 1 C). Moreover, in cells cotreated with the ER antagonist ICI 182,780, only E2-induced transactivation was inhibited. In the absence of cotransfected ERα, only TGF-α induced CAT activity, and ICI 182,780 did not inhibit this response (data not shown). Previous studies (12Hill C.S. Treisman R.

The −354 to −296 region of the fos gene promoter does not contain an estrogen-responsive element, and DNA binding of ERα was not observed in a gel mobility shift assay (data not shown). The requirement for the DNA binding domain of ERα for estrogen action was further investigated in MCF-7 and ER-negative MDA-MB-231 cells transfected with pSS plus wild-type ERα, mutant HE11 (DNA binding domain deletion), HE15 (expressing AF1), or mutant HE19 (expressing AF2) expression plasmids (Fig.2 B). E2-induced reporter gene activity in both cell lines only after cotransfection of wild-type ERα or HE11, confirming that DNA binding was not required for transactivation and that both AF1 and AF2 domains of ERα were required for an induction response. Previous studies have shown that, like growth factors, E2 activates the MAPK and other kinase-dependent pathways (42Migliaccio A. Di Domenico M. Castoria G. de Falco A. Bontempo P. Nola E.

Fig. 3 A summarizes the effects of the MAPK kinase inhibitor, PD98059, on induction of CAT activity by 10 nm E2, 10 nm IGF, or 10 nmTGF-α in MCF-7 cells transfected with pSS and ERα expression plasmid. TGF-α, IGF, and E2 induce reporter gene activity, and PD98059 inhibits this response. In the absence of ERα, E2 is inactive, whereas TGF-α and IGF induce CAT activity and PD98059 inhibits this response (data not shown). Activation of pSS by E2 was also inhibited after cotransfection with dominant negative expression plasmids for MAPK or ras (Fig. 3 B). The −254 to −296 region of the fos gene promoter contains an upstream SIE and a downstream SRE that is composed of two binding sites: an SRF site for binding an SRF dimer and a TCF site that binds Ets family transcription factors, SAP1, SAP2, and Elk-1 (32Treisman R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 96-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis of pSS (Fig. 3 C) showed that pSRE (−325 to −296fos gene promoter insert) alone retained E2 responsiveness; however, mutation of either the TCF or SRF binding sites resulted in loss of hormone-mediated transactivation. In addition, cotransfection of pSRE with dominant negative MAPK or ras expression plasmids resulted in loss of inducibility by E2 (Fig. 3 D), suggesting that the SRE region of the fos gene promoter was sufficient for E2 action, and inducibility was associated with activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway. Previous studies in ER-negative CHO cells showed that transfection with ERα also resulted in activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway via membrane ERα (45Razandi M. Pedram A. Greene G.L. Levin E.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 307-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar); the results in Fig.3 E illustrate that transfection of CHO cells with hER (or HE11) also activates pSRE as noted in Fig. 2 for both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Protein binding to the SRE was investigated using [32P]SS containing the −354 to −296 region of thefos gene promoter. After incubation of the radiolabeled oligonucleotide with nuclear extracts from untreated MCF-7 cells, analysis by gel mobility shift assay showed three major bands (C1, C2, and C3) (Fig. 4 A,lane 1), and the intensity of these bands was increased after incubation with extracts from MCF-7 cells treated with 10 nm E2 (lane 2) or 10 nm TGF-α (lane 3) for 30 min. In antibody supershift studies using nuclear extracts from E2-treated MCF-7 cells (Fig. 4 B, lane 1), band C3 was supershifted with SRF and Elk-1 antibodies; bands C1 and C2 were also supershifted with SRF antibody, whereas SAP1 antibody did not give a supershifted band.

https://openalex.org/W1978400316,"In many species, including humans, exposure to high image velocities induces motion adaptation, but the neural mechanisms are unclear. We have isolated two mechanisms that act on directionally selective motion-sensitive neurons in the fly's visual system. Both are driven strongly by movement and weakly, if at all, by flicker. The first mechanism, a subtractive process, is directional and is only activated by stimuli that excite the neuron. The second, a reduction in contrast gain, is strongly recruited by motion in any direction, even if the adapting stimulus does not excite the cell. These mechanisms are well designed to operate effectively within the context of motion coding. They can prevent saturation at susceptible nonlinear stages in processing, cope with rapid changes in direction, and preserve fine structure within receptive fields."
https://openalex.org/W2065219184,"Aggregation of neurotransmitter receptors at pre- and postsynaptic structures is crucial for efficient neuronal communication. In contrast to the wealth of information about postsynaptic specializations, little is known about the molecular organization of presynaptic membrane proteins. We show here that the metabotropic glutamate receptor mGluR7a, which localizes specifically to presynaptic active zones, interacts in vitro and in vivo with PICK1. Coexpression in heterologous systems induces coclustering dependent upon the extreme C terminus of mGluR7a and the PDZ domain of PICK1. mGluR7a and PICK1 localize to excitatory synapses in hippocampal neurons. Furthermore, whereas transfected mGluR7a clusters at presynaptic sites, mGluR7aΔ3 lacking the PICK1 binding site targets to axons but does not cluster. These results suggest that PICK1 is a component of the presynaptic machinery involved in mGluR7a aggregation and in modulation of glutamate neurotransmission."
https://openalex.org/W1991247470,"Neurons encode information and communicate via action potentials, which are generated following the summation of synaptic events. It is commonly assumed that action potentials reset the membrane potential completely, allowing another round of synaptic integration to begin. We show here that the conductances underlying the action potential act instead as a variable reset of synaptic integration. The strength of this reset is cell type–specific and depends on the kinetics, location, and timing of the synaptic input. As a consequence, distal synapses, as well as inputs mediated by N -methyl- d -aspartate receptor activation, can contribute disproportionately to synaptic integration during action potential firing."

Here we report that optimal insulin-mediated GLUT4 translocation is dependent upon both microtubule and actin-based cytoskeletal structures in cultured adipocytes. Depolymerization of microtubules and F-actin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes causes the dispersion of perinuclear GLUT4-containing membranes and abolishes insulin action on GLUT4 movements to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, heterologous expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes of the microtubule-binding protein hTau40, which impairs kinesin motors that move toward the plus ends of microtubules, markedly delayed the appearance of GLUT4 at the plasma membrane in response to insulin. The hTau40 protein had no detectable effect on microtubule structure or perinuclear GLUT4 localization under these conditions. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that both the actin and microtubule-based cytoskeleton, as well as a kinesin motor, direct the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane in response to insulin.

The N- and C-terminal cleavage sites where pro-IAPP is processed by prohormone convertases contain a series of basic amino acid residues that we hypothesized may interact with heparan sulfate proteoglycans. This possibility was tested using affinity chromatography by applying synthetic fragments of pro-IAPP to heparin-agarose and heparan sulfate-Sepharose.

Although the mechanism of islet amyloid formation is unknown, one potential cause has been proposed to be alterations in the processing of the IAPP precursor molecule, pro-IAPP, by the islet beta cell (3Kahn S.E. Andrikopoulos S. Verchere C.B. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 241-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar,26Porte Jr., D. Kahn S.E. Diabetes. 1989; 38: 1333-1336Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pro-IAPP is processed to mature IAPP in beta cell secretory granules by the action of prohormone convertase enzymes at the C-terminal side of dibasic residues. The prohormone convertases PC2 and PC3 (also called PC1) are likely responsible for pro-IAPP processing, since they are present in beta cell granules, are known to similarly process proinsulin at the C-terminal side of dibasic residues (27Halban P.A. Irminger J.-C. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 28Zhou A. Webb G. Zhu X. Steiner D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20745-20748Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar), and appear to be capable of fully processing pro-IAPP in vitro (29Higham C.E. Hull R.L. Lawrie L. Shennan K.I. Morris J.F. Birch N.P. Docherty K. Clark A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4998-5004Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have recently shown that PC2 is essential for processing of pro-IAPP at its N-terminal cleavage site (30Wang J. Xu J. Finnerty J. Furuta M. Steiner D.F. Verchere C.B. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In type 2 diabetes, processing of proinsulin by beta cells is defective, resulting in elevated release of proinsulin relative to insulin (31Ward W.K. LaCava E.C. Paquette T.L. Beard J.C. Wallum B.J. Porte Jr., D. Diabetologia. 1987; 30: 698-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 32Kahn S.E. Halban P.A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1725-1732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since proinsulin and pro-IAPP are processed in parallel in beta cells, it seems likely that pro-IAPP processing may also be defective in this disease, leading to the hypersecretion of unprocessed or partially processed forms of pro-IAPP. Interestingly, immunoreactivity for the N-terminal (but not the C-terminal) region of pro-IAPP has been found to be present in islet amyloid deposits (33Westermark P. Engstrom U. Westermark G.T. Johnson K.H. Permerth J. Betsholtz C. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 1989; 7: 219-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) suggesting that partially processed, N-terminally extended pro-IAPP might be an important molecule in islet amyloid formation. We hypothesized that unprocessed or partially processed pro-IAPP might interact with basement heparan sulfate proteoglycans. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized fragments of pro-IAPP containing the N- and C-terminal cleavage sites, and we assessed their ability to bind to heparin and heparan sulfate. Heparin, heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate A, bovine serum albumin (BSA), Sepharose CL-4B, heparin-agarose CL-4B, and thioflavin T were purchased from Sigma. CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Wild-type and mutant pro-IAPP fragments were synthesized at the Nucleic Acid Protein Synthesis unit at the University of British Columbia. All synthetic peptides were high performance liquid chromatography-purified, and the N-terminal peptides containing cysteine residues at positions 6 and 9 of IAPP were cyclized. Rat and human IAPP were purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA). Heparin-agarose affinity chromatography was performed as per Ancsin and Kisilevsky (22Ancsin J.B. Kisilevsky R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7172-7181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In brief, an 8-ml column of heparin-agarose was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl at either pH 7.5 or 5.5, as indicated. Peptide (300 μg) was dissolved in buffer and loaded onto the column, washed with four column volumes of buffer, and then developed at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with a 0–1 m NaCl gradient over five column volumes using a GM-1 gradient mixer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fractions (0.5 ml) were collected, and absorbance was measured at 214 nm. Salt concentrations in fractions were directly measured using a hand-held conductivity meter. Heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate affinity chromatography were performed in a similar manner, except the columns were made by coupling free heparan sulfate or chondroitin sulfate to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads following the protocol provided by the manufacturer. Glycosaminoglycan coupling efficiency to the Sepharose beads, assessed by the toluidine blue method (34Ancsin, J. B., and Kisilevsky, R. (2001) Methods Mol. Biol., in press.Google Scholar) was found to be 0.25 mg/ml gel for chondroitin sulfate and 0.1 mg/ml gel for heparan sulfate. To minimize cost for preparation of heparan sulfate-Sepharose the coupling protocol was scaled down, and a 3-ml column was used. The degree of peptide aggregation to form amyloid fibrils was determined by thioflavin T fluorescence using an assay adapted from Naiki et al. (35Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar) and Kudva et al. (36Kudva Y.C. Mueske C. Butler P.C. Eberhardt N.L. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) for a 96-well plate format. All peptides were dissolved in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), aliquoted, and kept frozen as 250 μm stock solutions until thawing immediately prior to use. Peptide was added to wells containing 10 μm thioflavin T in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100 to a final peptide concentration of 12.5 μm and final Me2SO concentration of 5%. The plate was sealed with parafilm and fluorescence measured at 37 °C using a Fluoroskan (Labsystems, Vista, CA) fluorometer with filters set at 444 (excitation) and 485 (emission) nm and bandwidth slits of 12 and 14 nm, respectively. When bound to amyloid fibrils, thioflavin T fluoresces with excitation and emission maxima of 450 and 482 nm, respectively (35Naiki H. Higuchi K. Hosokawa M. Takeda T. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 244-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1003) Google Scholar), and fluorescence under these conditions correlates with the degree of amyloid fibril formation as assessed by electron microscopy (36Kudva Y.C. Mueske C. Butler P.C. Eberhardt N.L. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Triplicate measurements for each peptide were made every minute from 0 to 100 min, every 10 min from 100 to 150 min, and finally every 60 min from 150 min to 15 h, allowing kinetic assessment of IAPP fibrillogenesis. The mean data were plotted and analyzed using KaleidagraphTM software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). Since amyloid fibril elongation is thought to follow first-order rate kinetics (37Naiki H. Nakakuki K. Lab. Invest. 1996; 74: 374-383PubMed Google Scholar, 38Larson J.L. Ko E. Miranker A.D. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), the data were fit using nonlinear least squares to the equation:Ft = F∞−(F∞ −F0)e −kt, whereFt is the fluorescence at time t;F∞ is the steady state fluorescence, andk is the initial rate constant. To test whether the cluster of basic amino acids in the regions of the N- and C-terminal cleavage sites in pro-IAPP might constitute heparin binding domains, we synthesized peptides corresponding to the 30 N-terminal or 27 C-terminal amino acids of human pro-IAPP (see Fig.1), containing these domains, and applied these peptides to a heparin-agarose column. Since fibril formation might enhance heparin binding (24Watson D.J. Lander A.D. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31617-31624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), a critical amyloidogenic region in IAPP (amino acids 31–40 of pro-IAPP) was omitted from these synthetic peptides to minimize the likelihood of protein aggregation. The N-terminal pro-IAPP fragment was retained by the heparin column, eluting at 0.18 m NaCl on a 0–1 m NaCl gradient developed over 80 min (Fig.2 A). In contrast, BSA, a protein known to not bind to heparin (22Ancsin J.B. Kisilevsky R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7172-7181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), eluted in the void volume. When applied to a column containing uncoupled Sepharose, the N-terminal pro-IAPP fragment eluted in the void volume (Fig. 2 A), indicating that its retention on heparin-agarose was not due to a nonspecific interaction between the peptide and the column matrix. The C-terminal region of pro-IAPP contains two pairs of basic residues, including one at the C-terminal cleavage site involved in processing of pro-IAPP to IAPP-(1–37). Unlike the N-terminal pro-IAPP fragment, the C-terminal pro-IAPP peptide interacted only weakly with heparin, eluting in wash fractions prior to commencement of the NaCl gradient (Fig. 2 B).Figure 2Affinity of pro-IAPP fragments for heparin. Synthetic peptides corresponding to human pro-IAPP amino acids 1–30 (N-terminal fragment) (A), human pro-IAPP-(41–67) (C-terminal fragment) (B), or human pro-IAPP-(1–30) with alanines substituted for Lys10–Arg11 (K10A/R11A) (C) were applied to a heparin-agarose or uncoupled Sepharose column as indicated in A. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used as a control in A. The column was washed with four column volumes of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), developed with a 0–1m NaCl gradient, fractions (0.5 ml) collected, and absorbance determined at 214 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine whether the Lys10-Arg11-Lys12 sequence in the N-terminal pro-IAPP cleavage site is essential for heparin binding, we synthesized a peptide in which alanine residues were substituted for the two basic residues (lysine and arginine) that compose the cleavage site recognized by prohormone convertases during normal pro-IAPP processing (see Fig. 1). The K10A/R11A mutant N-terminal pro-IAPP peptide fragment had no affinity for heparin (Fig.2 C), eluting in the void volume when applied to the heparin-agarose column. The complete loss of heparin binding in the K10A/R11A mutant peptide indicates that one or both of the basic residues in the N-terminal cleavage site of pro-IAPP are essential for heparin binding. To determine whether the N-terminal region of human pro-IAPP has the ability to bind to the heparan sulfate chains of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, as it does heparin, we applied the synthetic N-terminal pro-IAPP fragment to a column in which heparan sulfate was coupled to Sepharose. As shown in Fig.3 A, the N-terminal pro-IAPP peptide bound to the heparan sulfate column, eluting at a NaCl concentration (0.17 m) almost identical to that observed when the peptide was applied to heparin-agarose. The C-terminal pro-IAPP fragment did not, by contrast, bind to the heparan sulfate, eluting in wash fractions (Fig. 3 A). Similarly, the K10A/R11A mutant N-terminal pro-IAPP fragment eluted in the void volume when applied to the heparan sulfate-Sepharose column (Fig.3 A). Thus, the cluster of basic residues in the N-terminal cleavage site of pro-IAPP appears to confer affinity of this molecule for both heparin and heparan sulfate. To elucidate which of the basic residues in the N-terminal cleavage site of pro-IAPP may be critical for heparan sulfate binding, we next synthesized two mutant peptides, in which an alanine residue was substituted for either the lysine at position 10 (K10A) or the arginine at position 11 (R11A) of pro-IAPP. When applied to the heparan sulfate column, both the K10A and the R11A mutant peptides eluted in the void volume (Fig. 3 B), indicating that both of these basic residues are critical for interaction of N-terminal pro-IAPP with heparan sulfate. When applied to a chondroitin sulfate-Sepharose column, both the N-terminal and C-terminal pro-IAPP peptide fragments appeared to have weak interaction with this glycosaminoglycan, eluting after the void volume but prior to commencement of the salt gradient (Fig.4). Thus, the affinity of the N-terminal pro-IAPP peptide appears to be much stronger for heparan sulfate than for chondroitin sulfate. Nonetheless, the weak binding of the N-terminal pro-IAPP peptide to chondroitin sulfate does seem to be dependent on the presence of the basic residues in the N-terminal cleavage site, since the K10A/R11A mutant N-terminal pro-IAPP peptide did not bind to chondroitin sulfate, eluting in the void volume (Fig.4). Amyloid fibrils formed by mature human IAPP (pro-IAPP-(12–49)) and other amyloidogenic peptides including the amyloid-β protein of Alzheimer's disease are known to bind to heparin (24Watson D.J. Lander A.D. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31617-31624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This affinity is thought to be dependent on the aggregation state of the peptide, since human but not nonfibrillogenic rodent IAPP has been found to bind to both heparin (24Watson D.J. Lander A.D. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31617-31624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and perlecan (25Castillo G.M. Cummings J.A. Yang W. Judge M.E. Sheardown M.J. Rimvall K. Hansen J.B. Snow A.D. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). To rule out the possibility that the heparin binding activity of our synthetic N-terminal pro-IAPP peptide was simply due to its aggregation into fibrils that subsequently bound heparin, we measured fibril formation using thioflavin T fluorescence. As expected, thioflavin T fluorescence rapidly increased in the presence of human IAPP but was unchanged in the presence of rat IAPP, demonstrating the known fibrillogenic properties of human but not rat IAPP (Fig.5). Neither the N- nor the C-terminal pro-IAPP fragments formed fibrils as measured by thioflavin T fluorescence (Fig. 5), producing identical traces to nonfibrillar rat IAPP. These data indicate that both N- and C-terminal pro-IAPP fragments were not fibrillar over the time course of these experiments and therefore that the affinity for heparin and heparan sulfate demonstrated by N-terminal pro-IAPP was not due to its prior aggregation. By having determined that both the lysine and arginine residues at positions 10 and 11 of N-terminal pro-IAPP are crucial for its ability to bind heparan sulfate at pH 7.5 (Fig. 3 B), we next investigated the involvement of histidine residues, which would be protonated in the acidic milieu of beta cell secretory granules. There are two histidine residues present in human pro-IAPP, one in the N-terminal flanking region (position 6 of pro-IAPP) and one at amino acid 18 of mature IAPP (position 29 of pro-IAPP) (see Fig. 1). At pH 5.5, the heparin affinity of the N-terminal human pro-IAPP fragment was increased, with the peptide eluting at 0.28 m NaCl (versus 0.18 m at pH 7.5) (Fig.6 A). The affinity of the peptide for heparan sulfate was similarly increased at acidic pH (Fig.6 B). However, the K10A/R11A mutant had little affinity for heparin (Fig. 6 A) or heparan sulfate (Fig. 6 B) under these conditions. Thus, although either or both of the two histidine residues present in pro-IAPP may increase its affinity for heparin/heparan sulfate at acidic pH, they cannot substitute for the Lys10-Arg11-Lys12 sequence in the N-terminal cleavage site, which is still essential for heparin binding at either acidic or neutral pH. In addition to IAPP, islet amyloid deposits have been shown to contain immunoreactivity for the N-terminal region of pro-IAPP (the IAPP precursor) (33Westermark P. Engstrom U. Westermark G.T. Johnson K.H. Permerth J. Betsholtz C. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 1989; 7: 219-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and for basement membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycan (15Young I.D. Ailles L. Narindrasorasak S. Tan R. Kisilevsky R. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 1992; 116: 951-954PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of these molecules in islet amyloid deposits suggests their involvement in the mechanism of islet amyloid deposition, yet it is unknown what role they might play. In the present study, we demonstrate that a synthetic fragment of the N-terminal region of pro-IAPP binds to heparin and heparan sulfate. We further demonstrate that the heparin binding domain in N-terminally extended pro-IAPP requires the presence of basic residues in the N-terminal cleavage site at which one step in pro-IAPP processing occurs and, therefore, that normal processing of pro-IAPP would be predicted to destroy this heparin binding domain. The C-terminal region of pro-IAPP showed no affinity for heparin or heparan sulfate, despite the presence of two pairs of basic residues in this region. Our findings raise the possibility that if secretion of unprocessed pro-IAPP (or partially processed, N-terminally extended pro-IAPP) from the beta cell is increased in type 2 diabetes, it might bind to the sulfated glycosaminoglycan side chains of heparan sulfate proteoglycans, creating a nidus for amyloidogenesis within the pancreatic islet. We speculate that this mechanism may be an important initiating step in islet amyloid formation in type 2 diabetes. Pro-IAPP is thought to be processed to mature IAPP in beta cell secretory granules by the action of PC2 and/or PC3 (PC1) cleaving on the C-terminal side of pairs of basic residues (in both cases lysine-arginine), followed by trimming of these basic residues by carboxypeptidase E (30Wang J. Xu J. Finnerty J. Furuta M. Steiner D.F. Verchere C.B. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As a result, normal pro-IAPP processing results in the removal of the basic residues that we have shown are critical for heparin binding of the N-terminal region of pro-IAPP. Interestingly, the Lys10-Arg11-Lys12 cluster of basic residues in the N-terminal pro-IAPP fragment does not represent a classic linear heparin binding domain as proposed by Cardin and Weintraub (23Cardin A.D. Weintraub H.J. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 21-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); however, many proteins that bind heparin do not possess these sequences (39Baird A. Schubert D. Ling N. Guillemin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2324-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 40Cardin A.D. Hirose N. Blankenship D.T. Jackson R.L. Harmony J.A. Sparrow D.A. Sparrow J.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 134: 783-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). One model has suggested that a spacing of ∼20 Å between two basic amino acids is a critical determinant of heparin binding ability (41Margalit H. Fischer N. Ben-Sasson S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19228-19231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Such spacing can be achieved by a peptide in α-helical conformation by basic amino acids spaced 13 residues apart or, in β-strand conformation, 7 residues apart. Although the basic amino acids close to the N-terminal Lys10-Arg11 cleavage site (His6, Arg22, and His29) are not appropriately spaced according to this model, it is still conceivable that they contribute to the binding of N-terminal pro-IAPP to heparin/heparan sulfate. Indeed, the increased affinity for heparin and heparan sulfate of the N-terminal pro-IAPP peptide at pH 5.5 implies a possible role for the histidine residues at positions 6 and 29. Also, the disulfide bond between the cysteines at positions 13 and 18 of pro-IAPP might be predicted to bring the arginine at position 22 in closer proximity to the Lys10-Arg11-Lys12 sequence. However, the uncyclized form of the N-terminal pro-IAPP peptide binds as well to heparin as the cyclized form. 2K. Park and C. B. Verchere, unpublished data. The heparin binding activity of the N-terminal pro-IAPP peptide therefore does not depend upon any conformational change induced by formation of the disulfide bond. Thus, while the Lys10-Arg11-Lys12 sequence at the N-terminal cleavage site of pro-IAPP is clearly essential for heparin binding, whether this sequence is in itself sufficient or whether the basic residues outside of this sequence are also critical will require further study using additional mutant peptides. Heparin binding domains may also be created by protein aggregation, as illustrated by the binding to heparin (24Watson D.J. Lander A.D. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31617-31624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and perlecan (25Castillo G.M. Cummings J.A. Yang W. Judge M.E. Sheardown M.J. Rimvall K. Hansen J.B. Snow A.D. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) of aggregated human IAPP. Since our synthetic N- and C-terminal pro-IAPP fragments remained soluble and did not form fibrils as assessed by thioflavin T fluorescence, our findings cannot be explained by prior aggregation of the N-terminal pro-IAPP peptide to form a heparin binding domain. It is possible, however, that binding of soluble pro-IAPP to heparin/heparan sulfate might induce conformational changes in the protein that would enhance fibrillogenesis. Indeed, binding of soluble amyloid-β protein to glycosaminoglycans is known to stimulate β-sheet conformation and aggregation (42McLaurin J. Franklin T. Zhang X. Deng J. Fraser P.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 1101-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar), and perlecan has been shown to stimulate fibril formation from mature human IAPP (25Castillo G.M. Cummings J.A. Yang W. Judge M.E. Sheardown M.J. Rimvall K. Hansen J.B. Snow A.D. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Our finding that heparin/heparan sulfate binding activity of the N-terminal pro-IAPP peptide is increased at pH 5.5 raises the possibility that alterations in the local pH, for example in acidic intracellular compartments, might impact pro-IAPP binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans and subsequently amyloidogenesis. Alternatively, it cannot be ruled out that such interactions might play a normal physiological role, for example in (pro)IAPP trafficking and/or processing, although it is unknown whether heparan sulfate proteoglycans are a component of the acidic beta cell secretory granules in which (pro)IAPP resides. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans have been shown to be secreted via the constitutive pathway in other secretory cells (43Passafaro M. Rosa P. Sala C. Clementi F. Sher E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30096-30104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and we have recently found that immature (neonatal) rat beta cells secrete a significant proportion of (pro)IAPP immunoreactivity by the constitutive secretory pathway (12Verchere C.B. D'Alessio D.A. Prigeon R.L. Hull R.L. Kahn S.E. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1477-1484Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The possible significance of the increased heparin binding of pro-IAPP at acidic pH in both amyloid pathogenesis and in normal physiology may therefore be worthy of further investigation. The affinity of the N-terminal pro-IAPP peptide for another highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan, chondroitin sulfate, was much less than that observed for heparan sulfate. The weak interaction between chondroitin sulfate and the N-terminal pro-IAPP peptide likely does, however, involve the Lys10-Arg11-Lys12 sequence in the N-terminal cleavage site, since substitution of either the Lys10 or Arg11 residues with alanines resulted in total loss of binding. Chondroitin sulfate has not been shown to be a component of islet amyloid, although it may be a component of amyloid deposits in experimental murine inflammation-associated (AA) amyloidosis (44Inoue S. Kisilevsky R. Lab. Invest. 1996; 74: 670-683PubMed Google Scholar) and Alzheimer's disease (45DeWitt D.A. Silver J. Canning D.R. Perry G. Exp. Neurol. 1993; 121: 149-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This glycosaminoglycan has also been shown to bind to human IAPP-derived fibrils in vitro, albeit less strongly than does heparan sulfate (25Castillo G.M. Cummings J.A. Yang W. Judge M.E. Sheardown M.J. Rimvall K. Hansen J.B. Snow A.D. Diabetes. 1998; 47: 612-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The finding that the N-terminal pro-IAPP peptide binds to heparan sulfate more avidly than it does to chondroitin sulfate, despite the higher degree of sulfation of the latter, suggests that the degree of sulfation is not the most important determinant of sulfated glycosaminoglycan interaction with pro-IAPP. We speculate that the spacings of the sulfate groups in heparan sulfate and heparin are more appropriate than that of chondroitin sulfate for their interaction with pro-IAPP, as has been recently suggested for interaction of serum amyloid A, another amyloidogenic precursor, with glycosaminoglycans (22Ancsin J.B. Kisilevsky R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7172-7181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Altered proteolytic processing of precursors to produce a more amyloidogenic molecule may be a general mechanism underlying amyloid deposition in several different amyloidoses. This idea was first suggested by the work of Glenner et al. (46Glenner G.G. Ein D. Eanes E.D. Bladen H.A. Terry W. Page D.L. Science. 1971; 174: 712-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar) on immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis but has since been implicated in the mechanism of amyloid formation in Alzheimer's disease (17Kisilevsky R. Fraser P.E. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1997; 32: 361-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 47Sisodia S.S. Koo E.H. Beyreuther K. Unterbeck A. Price D.L.

Zheng H. Van Der Ploeg L.H. Ruffolo S.C. Thornberry N.A. Xanthoudakis S. Zamboni R.J. Roy S. Nicholson D.W. Cell. 1999; 97: 395-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar) and recently in familial British dementia (49Kim S.H. Wang R. Gordon D.J. Bass J. Steiner D.F. Lynn D.G. Thinakaran G. Meredith S.C. Sisodia S.S. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 984-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In the case of islet amyloid, we propose that impaired proteolytic processing of pro-IAPP by beta cells may result in disproportionate secretion of forms of (pro)IAPP with high affinity for heparan sulfate proteoglycans present on islet cell basement membranes. Once exocytosed from the beta cell, these molecules may bind to perlecan on the basement membranes of beta cells or islet vascular endothelial cells, preventing their entry into islet capillaries. Indeed, ultrastructural evidence from a transgenic mouse model of islet amyloid formation suggests that amyloid fibrils first accumulate extracellularly between islet beta cells and blood vessels (50Verchere C.B. D'Alessio D.A. Palmiter R.D. Weir G.C. Bonner-Weir S. Baskin D.G. Kahn S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3492-3496Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Interaction with the sulfated glycosaminoglycan side chains might then induce conformational changes in pro-IAPP that favor β-sheet formation, enhancing its tendency to aggregate. The local accumulation of pro-IAPP bound to perlecan might form a nidus for amyloid formation to which other amyloidogenic forms of IAPP including the major secreted form, IAPP, could be incorporated following their secretion from neighboring beta cells. In nondiabetic patients (in which islet amyloid is not usually observed) (51Clark A. Saad M.F. Nezzer T. Uren C. Knowler W.C. Bennett P.H. Turner R.C. Diabetologia. 1990; 33: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), pro-IAPP processing would be expected to be nearly complete (based on proinsulin (32Kahn S.E. Halban P.A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1725-1732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)), resulting in loss of the pro-IAPP heparin binding domain prior to exocytosis from the beta cell. Interestingly, the heparin binding activity of pro-IAPP that we identified was observed only in the N-terminal and not the C-terminal region of the peptide. Immunoreactivity for the N-terminal flanking region of pro-IAPP, but not the C-terminal region, is present in islet amyloid in type 2 diabetic human pancreas (33Westermark P. Engstrom U. Westermark G.T. Johnson K.H. Permerth J. Betsholtz C. Diabetes Res. Clin. Pract. 1989; 7: 219-226Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that a partially processed, N-terminally extended pro-IAPP conversion intermediate may be an important molecule in islet amyloid formation. Whether partially processed pro-IAPP is secreted in excessive amounts in type 2 diabetes is unknown; however, beta cells of patients with type 2 diabetes have disproportionately elevated secretion of both proinsulin and a partially processed proinsulin conversion intermediate, des-31,32-proinsulin (32Kahn S.E. Halban P.A. Diabetes. 1997; 46: 1725-1732Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, prolonged culture in high glucose causes marked accumulation of the N-terminally extended pro-IAPP conversion intermediate in human islets (52Hou X. Ling Z. Quartier E. Foriers A. Schuit F. Pipeleers D. Van Schravendijk C. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 188-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) as well as rapid islet amyloid formation in islets from transgenic mice expressing amyloidogenic human IAPP (53de Koning E.J.P. Morris E.R. Hofhuis F.M.A. Posthuma G. Hoppener J.W.M. Morris J.F. Capel P.J.A. Clark A. Verbeek J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8467-8471Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). If indeed hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes is associated with excessive secretion of the N-terminal pro-IAPP conversion intermediate and its subsequent deposition as islet amyloid, we hypothesize that binding of N-terminal pro-IAPP to basement membrane heparan sulfate proteoglycans may be an important pathogenic event in this pathway. We are grateful to Drs. Robert Kisilevsky and John Ancsin for helpful comments in the planning of these experiments."
https://openalex.org/W2017453813,"In the Drosophila compound eye, photoreceptors (R cells) that respond to light from the same point in space are distributed across the retina and connect to the same target neurons. This complex connectivity pattern reconstructs visual space in the first optic ganglion, the lamina. We have used mutations that delete specific R cell subtypes or alter their retinal organization to define the cellular mechanisms that generate this pattern. R cell axons are programmed to search for targets within a local region in the lamina but their selection of appropriate postsynaptic targets requires specific interactions among R cell growth cones. The orientation of the projections is controlled both by the spatial arrangement of R cells in the retina and by cues in the target."
https://openalex.org/W2064734599,"Site-specific fluorescence recordings have shown great promise in understanding conformational changes in signaling proteins. The reported applications on ion channels have been limited to extracellular sites in whole oocyte preparations. We are now able to directly monitor gating movements of the intracellular domains of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels using simultaneous site-specific fluorescence recording and patchclamp current recording from inside-out patches. Fluorescence signals were reliably observed when fluorophore was covalently attached to a site between the cyclic nucleotide-binding domain and the pore. While iodide, an anionic quencher, has a higher quenching efficiency in the channel's closed state, thallium ion, a cationic quencher, has a higher quenching efficiency in the open state. The state and charge dependence of quenching suggests movements of charged or dipolar residues near the fluorophore during CNG channel activation."

Plasmodium falciparum is the most important representative of these genera as it causes 400 million episodes of malaria and kills more than 1 million children in sub-Saharan Africa each year. Conventional therapies for malaria are failing because of the spread of multidrug-resistant parasites (1White N.J. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1999; 354: 739-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar), whereas prevention of malaria is impeded by a lack of effective vaccines, which will take many years to develop. Molecular and cellular studies of P. falciparum are therefore essential to identify potential drug targets and to increase our understanding of how intracellular parasites maintain homeostasis, obtain nutrients, and produce up to 36 progeny during a 48-h asexual stage life cycle (2Krishna S. Br. Med. J. 1997; 315: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Parasite-encoded membrane transport proteins are crucial for these processes as they supply essential nutrients and remove toxic waste products, regulate the intracellular ionic microenvironment, and generate plasma membrane electrochemical gradients. These membrane transporters present opportunities for interventions designed to disrupt critical cellular functions. The study of transporters encoded by different apicomplexan organisms also provides opportunities for developing drugs aimed at biochemical targets shared by these pathogens but confined to this taxon. P type ATPase membrane proteins of P. falciparum were first proposed for study as drug targets when sequences encoding four representatives (PfATP 1–3 and PfATP 6) were identified (3Krishna S. Cowan G. Meade J.C. Wells R.A. Stringer J.R. Robson K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 4Kimura M. Yamaguchi Y. Takada S. Tanabe K. J.

Subsequently, a further member of this family (PfATP4) was described (6Trottein F. Cowman A.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 214-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 7Trottein F. Thompson J. Cowman A.F. Gene. 1995; 158: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 8Dyer M. Jackson M. McWhinney C. Zhao G. Day K. Mikkelsen R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and most recently a sixth example (PfATP 7, also designated MAL3P6 (9Bowman S. Lawson D. Basham D. Brown D. Chillingworth T. Churcher C.M. Craig A. Davies R.M. Devlin K. Feltwell T. Gentles S. Gwilliam R. Hamlin N. Harris D. Holroyd S. Hornsby T. Horrocks P. Jagels K. Jassal B. Kyes S. McLean J. Moule S. Mungall K. Murphy L. Barrell B.G. et al.Nature. 1999; 400: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar)) has been recognized by the malaria genome sequencing initiative. These malarial sequences contain signature motifs that are common to all P type ATPases, including highly conserved phosphorylation site- and nucleotide-binding motifs and a transduction domain, as well as similarities in predicted hydropathy profiles. However, functional assay of malarial P type ATPases has not been reported, because malarial sequences (particularly those of integral membrane proteins) are difficult to express in heterologous systems (10Krishna S. Woodrow C.J. Cardew G. Transport and Trafficking in the Malaria-infected Erythrocyte. 226. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., London1999: 126-144Google Scholar). Some malarial P type ATPase-like sequences also contain segments that are not found in orthologues (3Krishna S. Cowan G. Meade J.C. Wells R.A. Stringer J.R. Robson K.J. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 385-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 6Trottein F. Cowman A.F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 214-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). These inserts are hydrophilic and may contain tandemly repeated amino acid motifs that are of undefined function. Their presence increases uncertainty regarding both the function of malarial P type ATPase-like sequences and the ability to express these sequences in heterologous systems. Heterologous expression of P type ATPases has hitherto been limited to a few mainly mammalian examples. We have studied a Ca2+-ATPase of P. falciparum(PfATP4), because Ca2+-ATPases are vital components of the machinery employed by eukaryotic cells to regulate intracellular calcium concentrations. Sequence analysis of Ca2+-ATPases suggests the following three categories of transporter: SERCA (sarco/endoplasmic reticulum)-type, PMR1 (yeast Golgi)-type, and PMCA (plasma membrane)-type ATPases (11Pittman J.K. Mills R.F. O'Connor C.D. Williams L.E. Gene. 1999; 236: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). PfATP4 has not yet been assigned to any of these categories on the basis of primary sequence analysis, although its localization to the plasma membrane of asexual stage parasites has suggested that it may be more like a PMCA than a SERCA pump (8Dyer M. Jackson M. McWhinney C. Zhao G. Day K. Mikkelsen R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Comprehensive analysis of primary sequence (and function) has also been hindered, because the full sequence for PfATP4 was not elucidated in two previous reports (7Trottein F. Thompson J. Cowman A.F. Gene. 1995; 158: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 8Dyer M. Jackson M. McWhinney C. Zhao G. Day K. Mikkelsen R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Here we complete the ORF1 for PfATP4, analyze its relationship to current classifications of Ca2+-ATPases, and quantitate expression of its mRNA during the asexual stage of the life cycle of the parasite. We also functionally characterize PfATP4 using Xenopus laevisoocytes. These studies suggest that PfATP4 does not belong to any conventional category of Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA-, PMCA-, or PMR1-type) but rather defines a novel subclass of Ca2+-ATPases that is also represented in other apicomplexan organisms. All materials were obtained from Sigma except where stated otherwise. All PCR experiments used thermostable polymerase (Pfu; Stratagene) and genomic DNA (clone T9/96) as template, unless stated otherwise. PCR products were verified by sequence analysis. Parasites (clone 3D7) synchronized to an 8-h time window as described previously (12Woodrow C.J. Penny J.I. Krishna S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7272-7277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) were collected every 8 h into RNA isolator™ (GenoSys Biotechnologies, Cambridge, UK) and RNA extracted according to the manufacturer's recommendations. A competitor plasmid containing a novel asymmetrical restriction endonuclease site was generated (by converting a PstI to aHindIII site at nucleotide 2760) in PfATP4 sequence by PCR. This mutated fragment (contained between nucleotide positions 2475 and 3040) was ligated into a construct containing a previously mutatedβ−tubulin sequence and was used in quantitative tandem competitive PCR assays as reported previously for PfHT1, a malarial hexose transporter (12Woodrow C.J. Penny J.I. Krishna S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7272-7277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Dyer et al. (8Dyer M. Jackson M. McWhinney C. Zhao G. Day K. Mikkelsen R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (accession number U39298) extended the ORF initially reported for PfATP4 (7Trottein F. Thompson J. Cowman A.F. Gene. 1995; 158: 133-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) (accession number U16995). However, hydropathy analysis of this extended PfATP4 sequence predicted only six transmembrane helices, an unusually low number for this class of ATPase. Comparison of PfATP4 sequences with expanding malarial sequence data bases indicated that a premature stop codon had been incorrectly identified (8Dyer M. Jackson M. McWhinney C. Zhao G. Day K. Mikkelsen R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The first correct in frame stop codon in the ORF deduced from the malaria genome sequencing initiative therefore extended the previously published PfATP4 sequence (8Dyer M. Jackson M. McWhinney C. Zhao G. Day K. Mikkelsen R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) by 111 nucleotides allowing prediction of four additional membrane-spanning helices in this fully completed sequence. This suggestion was verified by independent sequence analysis of a 3795-nucleotide PCR product made from genomic DNA that included both published and new sequences (accession number AF203980). This encodes a derived amino acid sequence of 1264 amino acids (predicted molecular mass = 140 kDa). Sequence and hydropathy analyses and alignments were performed using DNASTAR™ (version 1.6; DNASTAR Inc., Madison, WI) and MacVector™ (version 4.5.1; Eastman Kodak Co., Rochester, NY) software. For functional studies in X. laevis oocytes, full-length sequence encoding PfATP4, together with a strong Kozak consensus sequence (CACCATG, where the initiation codon is underlined) andBglII restriction sites, was cloned into the SmaI site of pUC18 and sequenced. PfATP4 was then cloned intoBglII sites of pSP64, and capped cRNA was transcribed (MEGAscript™ SP6 mMESSAGE mMACHINETM kit; Ambion, Austin, TX) from XbaI-linearized template (12Woodrow C.J. Penny J.I. Krishna S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7272-7277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Control experiments included cRNA made from a clone encoding a previously characterized avian SERCA I pump (cSERCA1) (13Ishii T. Takeyasu K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8881-8885Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and tPfATP4, which encodes a prematurely truncated version of PfATP4 (nucleotides 1–3684) described in Ref. 8Dyer M. Jackson M. McWhinney C. Zhao G. Day K. Mikkelsen R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar. Xenopusoocytes were harvested, and connective tissue was removed with collagenase (2 mg/ml Type IA, shaken for 2 h) (12Woodrow C.J. Penny J.I. Krishna S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7272-7277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Stages V and VI oocytes were selected and microinjected with cRNA (5–30 ng) encoding cSERCA1, PfATP4, or tPfATP4 in RNase-free water (25–50 nl) or a corresponding volume of RNase-free water. Oocytes were subsequently incubated (at 19 °C) in Barth's solution (12Woodrow C.J. Penny J.I. Krishna S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7272-7277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) for 3–7 days. Total membrane preparations from oocytes were obtained as in Ref. 14Geering K. Theulaz F. Verrey F. Hauptle M.T. Rossier B.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C851-858Crossref PubMed Google Scholar with minor modifications as follows: oocyte homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 ×g for 5 min; the resulting yolk granule/melanosome pellet was recentrifuged. Supernatants from the low speed spins were pooled and centrifuged (100,000 × g, 90 min) to obtain a membrane fraction, which was stored at −70 °C. Sarcoplasmic reticulum (containing ∼80% mammalian SERCA Ia) was prepared from skeletal muscle of New Zealand White rabbits as described (15East J.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 27: 87-94PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+-ATPase activity was monitored by a coupled enzyme assay as described previously (15East J.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 27: 87-94PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes (2–50 μg of protein) were mixed at 25 °C in a volume of 2.5 ml containing ATP (2 mm), phospho(enol)pyruvate (2.5 mm), NADH (0.25 mm), pyruvate kinase (7.5 units), and lactate dehydrogenase (8.0 units). The resynthesis of ATP consumed by Ca2+-ATPase activity is coupled by the pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase to NADH oxidation. The oxidation rate of NADH was recorded atA340 (Shimadzu UV—160; Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan), and ATPase activity (expressed as IU or μmol of ATP hydrolyzed/mg of total protein/min) was calculated using an extinction coefficient for NADH of 6200 liter mol−1cm−1. Ca2+-ATPase activity was defined as the activation seen on addition of calcium; [Ca2+]free was calculated as described previously (15East J.M. Methods Mol. Biol. 1994; 27: 87-94PubMed Google Scholar). ATPase activity was measured after a 30-min preincubation of membranes (25 °C) with ouabain (final concentration = 200 μm), vanadate (1 mm), thapsigargin (0.8 μm), or cyclopiazonic acid (1 μm) before addition to the reaction mixture. The hydropathy profile of the full-length PfATP4 sequence is compared with representatives of the major subclasses of Ca2+-ATPases and with an orthologue encoded by Cryptosporidium parvum; see Fig.1 A. Ten transmembrane helices are predicted for PfATP4 as for other Ca2+-ATPases including the C. parvum orthologue (in contrast to the reported prediction of eight transmembrane helices for the latter sequence (16Zhu G. Keithly J.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar)). The hydropathy profile of another malarial Ca2+-ATPase, PfATP6 (4Kimura M. Yamaguchi Y. Takada S. Tanabe K. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), resembles most closely the profile of SERCA I (data not shown). This observation is consistent with a high degree of conservation of the primary sequence between SERCA 1a and PfATP6 (61.7% sequence identity in core analysis; see below). In contrast, the predicted hydropathy profile of PfATP4 does not resemble either that of SERCA pumps (e.g. PfATP4 contains an extended hydrophilic N-terminal region, indicated by a filled oval in Fig. 1 A, and an extended M7/M8 extracellular loop, shown under a hatched box) or that of plasma membrane ATPases (e.g. PfATP4 lacks a long hydrophilic C-terminal region, indicated by an open bar in PMCA in Fig. 1 A). The extended M7/M8 loop of PfATP4 may be of functional significance, as this region is predicted to protrude from the noncytoplasmic face of the membrane, and may contribute to Ca2+ translocation in mammalian orthologues (17Webb R.J. Khan Y.M. East J.M. Lee A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 977-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). This region is rich in acidic residues (21/137 (15.3%) glutamate/aspartate residues in PfATP4) as is the shorter M7/M8 loop in SERCA (e.g. 7/35 (20%) acidic residues for cSERCA1). P type ATPase core domains are ubiquitous on cytosolic loops between transmembrane regions M2 and M3 and M4 and M5 and are therefore often used in partial alignment analyses (18Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, B and C, comparison of core regions of Ca2+-ATPases shows that PfATP4 has only moderate (<50%) sequence identity with representatives from all three functionally characterized classes of P type Ca2+-ATPases (viz. SERCA, PMCA, or PMR1 sequences (19Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar)), and <25% identity if full-length sequences are compared (data not shown). PfATP4 is therefore phylogenetically distinct from existing subclasses of Ca2+-ATPases and occupies a position separate from them on a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1 C). Orthologues of PfATP4 were identified in other apicomplexan genomes using NCBI tBLASTn software. Sequences (often incomplete) that are similar to PfATP4 are also encoded by Toxoplasma gondii(36% sequence identity compared with PfATP4 amino acid residues 682–731 and 1159–1176), Plasmodium vivax (89% sequence identity compared with PfATP4 amino acid residues 282–455), and C. parvum (43% sequence identity compared with PfATP4) (16Zhu G. Keithly J.S. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 307-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (accession numbers W66177, X98484, and U65981, respectively; the latter 2 sequences were included in the analyses illustrated in Fig.1 B). No orthologues of PfATP4 were found in nonapicomplexan organisms. Six amino acid residues (Glu309, Glu771, Asn796, Thr799, Asp800, and Glu908) in transmembrane regions M4, M5, M6, and M8 comprise the high affinity sites responsible for the binding of a pair of Ca2+ ions to SERCA 1a (20Clarke D.M. Loo T.W. Inesi G. MacLennan D.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 476-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar). In contrast, PMCA- and PMR1-type Ca2+-ATPases contain only four amino acid residues in similar positions (Glu309, Asn796, Thr799, and Asp800 in positions corresponding to SERCA 1a notation), indicating that they bind one, rather than two, Ca2+ ions per enzyme molecule (19Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 21Guerini D. Foletti D. Vellani F. Carafoli E. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3290-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Five of the six Ca2+-binding amino acid residues of SERCA pumps were identified in M4, M5, and M6 of PfATP4, whereas a glutamate residue that had been previously aligned to Glu908 (of SERCA 1a) (8Dyer M. Jackson M. McWhinney C. Zhao G. Day K. Mikkelsen R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) is located in a predicted hydrophilic segment and is therefore unlikely to participate in a high affinity Ca2+-binding site. However, a glutamate residue (Glu1176) that aligns to Glu908 is also present in the full-length PfATP4 sequence (M8; see Fig. 1 A, indicated by a boxed star). Both this residue and the hydrophobic region in which it is located are also conserved in PfATP4 orthologues of T. gondii and C. parvum (Fig.1 A). We therefore suggest that this novel M8, as identified in our sequence analysis, contributes to a further Ca2+-binding site (boxed in Fig. 1 A) in apicomplexan enzymes. Thapsigargin selectively inhibits SERCA enzymes by binding at M3 (22Norregaard A. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26598-26601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Sagara Y. Inesi G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13503-13506Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PfATP6 shows >60% sequence identity in M3 to SERCA1a suggesting that it may be inhibited by thapsigargin. PfATP4 and its orthologues resemble non-SERCA enzymes such as PMCA1 and PMR1 in having <25% sequence identity to SERCA1a in this region, suggesting that PfATP4 will not be inhibited by thapsigargin. Conversely, there are no PMCA-like C-terminal calmodulin-binding motifs in the full-length PfATP4 sequence, which also lacks the recently proposed N-terminal calmodulin-binding motif (24Curran A.C. Hwang I. Corbin J. Martinez S. Rayle D. Sze H. Harper J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30301-30308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Malarial sequences often contain hydrophilic inserts, and one is present at the N terminus of PfATP4 (indicated by an oval in Fig. 1 A). M1 in SERCA and PMCA enzymes begins 60–100 amino acids from their respective N termini, whereas in PfATP4 M1 is predicted to begin at Gln173. Furthermore, the proportion of asparagine and lysine residues in the region before M1 in PfATP4 is elevated (21% Asn/13% Lys) compared with 6% Asn/6% Lys and 4% Asn/9% Lys for SERCA or PMCA, respectively. No insert could be identified in the orthologue of C. parvum suggesting that these features are peculiar to malarial ATPases rather than to apicomplexan pumps in general. Taken together, these observations suggest that PfATP4 and its orthologues constitute a new subfamily of P type Ca2+-ATPases that we propose as Type 4 (apicomplexan) according to Pittman's classification (11Pittman J.K. Mills R.F. O'Connor C.D. Williams L.E. Gene. 1999; 236: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). PfATP4 contains 4 potential Ca2+-binding sites and lacks a calmodulin-binding domain like SERCA pumps, while localizing to the parasite plasma membrane (perhaps as well as internal structures), and lacking a thapsigargin-binding sequence as do PMCA- or PMR1-like transporters. Moreover, PfATP4 also contains an extended M7/M8 loop and a long hydrophilic N-terminal region (features not found in SERCA, PMCA, or PMR1 ATPases). To confirm that cSERCA1 (an avian SERCA 1 pump) was expressed, we compared Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity in membrane preparations from oocytes injected with cRNA encoding cSERCA1 with that in sarcoplasmic reticulum preparations from rabbit muscle. Results are shown in Fig.2. As expected, maximal activities were higher in SR preparations (mean ± S.E. = 3.030 ± 0.300 IU for SR (n = 4) versus 0.048 ± 0.007 IU for cSERCA1 (n = 14)), but calcium dependences for the two preparations were almost identical, with EC50values (i.e. [Ca2+] required for half-maximal activation) of 0.23 and 0.26 μm for SR and cSERCA1, respectively. Membrane preparations from water-injected oocytes gave mean ± S.E. Ca2+-ATPase activities of 0.014 ± 0.005 IU (n = 19) and calcium dependences similar to those seen for SR and cSERCA1 (data not shown), indicating that ∼30% of calcium-dependent ATPase activity measured in cSERCA1-injected oocytes is due to endogenous XenopusCa2+-ATPases. This background activity has not been subtracted in data shown in Fig. 2. Ca2+-ATPase activities for membrane preparations from cSERCA1-injected oocytes correspond closely with those of microsomes prepared from SERCA-transfected COS-1 cells (range between 0.01 and 0.10 IU (25Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14483-14489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Lytton J. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). A Ca2+ dependence plot for PfATP4 is shown in Fig. 2. Maximal Ca2-dependent ATPase activities (0.067 ± 0.019 IU; n = 20) were similar in magnitude to those seen for cSERCA1, suggesting comparable expression of the two cRNA species in oocytes (assuming the same stoichiometry of ATP hydrolysis for PfATP4 as for SERCA). However, a broader activity peak with an EC50 of 0.40 μmwas observed for PfATP4 compared with SR/cSERCA1 preparations (p < 0.05 comparing maximal ATPase activities for PfATP4 with SR/cSERCA1 at pCa values of 3.5 and 4.5; see Fig. 2). Thus, near-maximal activation of the enzyme was preserved at higher free calcium concentrations (>30 μm) than those seen with SERCA pump preparations, where free [Ca2+] becomes inhibitory at >10 μm (27Ishii T. Lemas M.V. Takeyasu K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6103-6107Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The addition of bovine brain calmodulin (1 μm) did not increase the sensitivity of PfATP4 to [Ca2+] in two independent experiments (data not shown). tPfATP4 did not increase ATPase activity in oocyte membrane preparations (mean ± S.E. activity = 0.005 ± 0.007 IU or 10.6 ± 15.9% of full-length PfATP4 sequence (n = 3; p< 0.05) compared with PfATP4 activity). This residual Ca2+-ATPase activity was fully inhibitable by thapsigargin, confirming that it was because of endogenous XenopusCa2+-ATPases. Fig.3 summarizes inhibition profiles of Ca2+-ATPase activity in different membrane preparations. As expected, all preparations are resistant to ouabain (a Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor), and conversely all are inhibited by the pentacoordinate phosphate analogue, vanadate. PfATP4 is insensitive to thapsigargin in contrast to SR, cSERCA1, or control samples. Preincubation with thapsigargin (0.8 μm) reduces Ca2+-ATPase activity to 2.4 ± 1.4% (SR;n = 6), 5.2 ± 3.2% (cSERCA1; n = 5), and 10.0 ± 5.6% (water-injected controls; n= 6) of maximal levels. For PfATP4 significantly greater ATPase activity is maintained (74.7 ± 8%; n = 7;p = 0.003 comparing thapsigargin inhibition of cSERCA1 and PfATP4). The small (25%) inhibition seen in PfATP4 preparations probably represents an abolition of endogenous (oocyte) Ca2+-ATPase activity, rather than an effect on PfATP4. As thapsigargin inhibits SERCA specifically, this lack of susceptibility of PfATP4 to thapsigargin supports our earlier suggestion that PfATP4 is not a SERCA-type enzyme but rather represents a novel class of Ca2+-ATPases. Preincubation with cyclopiazonic acid (a metabolite from Aspergillus and Penicilium that inhibits SERCA and PMR1 pumps but not PMCA (19Sorin A. Rosas G. Rao R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9895-9901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 28Seidler N.W. Jona I. Vegh M. Martonosi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17816-17823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) inhibited SR, cSERCA1, and PfATP4 samples. Mean ± S.E. ATPase activities of SR, cSERCA1, and PfATP4 preparations in the presence of cyclopiazonic acid (1 μm) compared with uninhibited controls were, respectively, as follows: 5.8 ± 0.6% (n = 3), 14.1 ± 8.55 (n = 3), and 22.6 ± 4.3% (n = 4). We characterized the pattern of PfATP4 mRNA expression using synchronized cultures of asexual stageP. falciparum parasites and compared this expression with that of PfHT1, the malarial hexose transporter. The technique of tandem competitive PCR was used to quantitate precisely the amount of PfATP4 mRNA relative to that of a housekeeping gene, β-tubulin (12Woodrow C.J. Penny J.I. Krishna S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7272-7277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), and results are shown in Fig. 4. These data are shown in comparison with published data on PfHT1. The precision and reproducibility of this ratiometric method were confirmed by assessing the gene copy number of PfHT1 relative to that for β-tubulin using genomic DNA as template in five independent tandem competitive PCR experiments (mean ratio ± S.E. = 1.07 ± 0.12; see Fig. 4, open circle). Soon after invasion of red cells, there is relatively low expression of PfATP4 relative to β-tubulin. The ratio of PfATP4/β-tubulin mRNA rises ∼4-fold to a peak at 8–16 h, after which it falls slightly to approximately twice the initial level by 32 h. Maximal levels of PfATP4 relative to β-tubulin (∼5-fold initial values) are seen in mature asexual stages (40 h after invasion). The recent functional characterization of a malarial high affinity facilitative hexose transporter (PfHT1) has confirmed that X. laevis oocytes are a valuable tool for heterologous assay of malarial transport proteins (10Krishna S. Woodrow C.J. Cardew G. Transport and Trafficking in the Malaria-infected Erythrocyte. 226. John Wiley & Sons, Ltd., London1999: 126-144Google Scholar, 12Woodrow C.J. Penny J.I. Krishna S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7272-7277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We have used this system to express PfATP4 and measure Ca2+-ATPase activity in membrane preparations. PfATP4 activity is distinguished from the endogenous Ca2+-ATPases of oocytes by virtue of its magnitude (up to 20-fold higher than water-injected controls), lack of susceptibility to thapsigargin, and activation by a broader range of [Ca2+] (from pCa 3.5–5.5, corresponding to [Ca2+]free = 3.2–320 μm). The absence of induced Ca2+-dependent ATPase activity in oocytes injected with cRNA encoding tPfATP4 (a truncated version of PfATP4 that lacks terminal transmembrane segments) also confirms that full-length PfATP4 sequence is required for function and further that this induced activity is not due to nonspecific effects of microinjecting cRNA. Susceptibility to inhibition by vanadate of all the ATPases assayed in our experiments confirms that these activities are mediated by P type ATPases (Fig. 3). The lack of inhibition of ATPase activity by ouabain (a specific Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor) excludes this class of ATPase from contributing to increases in ATPase activity in experimental oocyte membrane preparations, because oocyte Na+/K+-ATPases are inhibited by ouabain (29Lafaire A.V. Schwarz W. J. Membr. Biol. 1986; 91: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar)). We estimate that PfATP4 constitutes ∼1% of oocyte membrane protein, based on the assumption that maximal rates of ATP hydrolysis by PfATP4 and SERCA 1 (i.e. cSERCA1 activity) are similar. The measured cSERCA1 activity is equivalent to ∼0.7% of oocyte membrane protein, as calibrated against SERCA 1a activity in rabbit muscle preparations where it constitutes 80% of total protein. This estimate for the level of expression of PfATP4 accords well with estimates for heterologous expression of SERCA in COS-1 cells (0.2–2% of total membrane protein, giving activities of 0.01–0.1 IU (25Lytton J. Westlin M. Burk S.E. Shull G.E. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14483-14489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,26Lytton J. Westlin M. Hanley M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17067-17071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). Detailed sequence analysis of PfATP4, and comparison with orthologues, suggests that PfATP4 defines a new subclass of Ca2+-ATPase found in apicomplexan organisms. Comparison of core sequences to discern phylogenetic relationships between P type ATPases from different organisms provides a useful approach for defining major subclasses (18Axelsen K.B. Palmgren M.G. J. Mol. Evol. 1998; 46: 84-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (761) Google Scholar) but does not distinguish between SERCA and PMR1 subclasses as identified by Pittman et al. (11Pittman J.K. Mills R.F. O'Connor C.D. Williams L.E. Gene. 1999; 236: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, analysis of the full ORF for PfATP4 was necessary to distinguish many defining characteristics of the apicomplexan subclass of Ca2+-ATPases. These were found to include six putative Ca2+-binding amino acid residues and an extended M7/M8 loop of >130 amino acids (the equivalent region in SERCA 1a being a low affinity (Km ∼2.5 mm) Ca2+-binding site involved in releasing Ca2+ions into the endoplasmic reticulum/SR lumen (17Webb R.J. Khan Y.M. East J.M. Lee A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 977-982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar)). In addition, functional characterization revealed a relatively broad Ca2+ dependence that is comparable with the profile of PMCA (30Ansah T.A. Molla A. Katz S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 13442-13450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and also both thapsigargin insensitivity and inhibition with cyclopiazonic acid. As thapsigargin and cyclopiazonic acid both bind to the M3 region of SERCA (31Ma H. Zhong L. Inesi G. Fortea I. Soler F. Fernandez-Belda F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 15522-15527Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), these findings implicate differences in that region of PfATP4 as being of potential importance in determining this pattern of susceptibility to inhibition. PfATP6 is a SERCA-type ATPase (4Kimura M. Yamaguchi Y. Takada S. Tanabe K. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 1129-1136Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that may also be important in Ca2+ homeostasis in P. falciparum. No other examples of the Ca2+-ATPase family of sequences have been identified in the malarial genome, of which >90% is now sequenced in whole or part. Taken together with published immunolocalization data (including staining of PfATP4 on free merozoites (8Dyer M. Jackson M. McWhinney C. Zhao G. Day K. Mikkelsen R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar)), our functional characterization of PfATP4 suggests that PfATP4 is likely to perform a key function as a plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPase in asexual stages of the life cycle of P. falciparum. These observations do not exclude an intracellular role for PfATP4, as in plants PMCA-type and SERCA-type ATPases may be found in both the plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum (11Pittman J.K. Mills R.F. O'Connor C.D. Williams L.E. Gene. 1999; 236: 137-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). PfATP4 is expressed throughout the asexual stages of the life cycle of the malaria parasite (Fig. 4) (8Dyer M. Jackson M. McWhinney C. Zhao G. Day K. Mikkelsen R. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1996; 78: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). mRNA expression levels vary by ∼5-fold relative to the housekeeping gene β-tubulin and generally increase as parasites mature. This pattern of mRNA expression differs from that observed with PfHT1, a facilitative malarial hexose transporter, with which it is directly comparable, because the same cDNA samples were used for both experiments. Overall, the ratio of PfATP4/β-tubulin mRNA is ∼20% that of PfHT1/β-tubulin (peak ratio > 1 at 8 h post-invasion). After PfHT1 mRNA peaks at 8 h, levels fall sharply 16 h after invasion, whereas they continue to rise for PfATP4 (12Woodrow C.J. Penny J.I. Krishna S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7272-7277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The divergent expression of these two transporters possibly reflects differing substrate requirements as the parasites develop and exemplifies stage-specific control of gene expression. Intraerythrocytic [Ca2+]free is ∼50 nm and is primarily regulated by PMCA (32Staines H.M. Chang W. Ellory J.C. Tiffert T. Kirk K. Lew V.L. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 172: 13-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). When rings mature into meronts, fluorimetrically assayed intraparasitic [Ca2+]free undergoes a small increase in concentration from 45 nm (24 h post-invasion) to 125 nm (in meronts 44 h after invasion) (33Adovelande J. Bastide B. Deleze J. Schrevel J. Exp. Parasitol. 1993; 76: 247-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), even though erythrocyte PMCA activity is retained (34Tiffert T. Staines H.M. Ellory J.C. Lew V.L. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 2000; 525: 125-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This independent regulation of intraparasitic [Ca2+]free depends upon the ability to export Ca2+ or to sequester it into membrane-bound stores, probably by the actions of both PfATP6 and PfATP4. PfATP6 has not been localized within parasites, functionally assayed, or found to be sensitive to thapsigargin, but thapsigargin has been reported to increase [Ca2+]I in parasites (35Garcia C.R. Dluzewski A.R. Catalani L.H. Burting R. Hoyland J. Mason W.T. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 71: 409-413PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with a role for SERCA-type activity in intraparasitic Ca2+ homeostasis. In contrast, [Ca2+] in freed parasites monitored with Fura-2 does not increase following treatment with thapsigargin (1 μm) but is increased by cyclopiazonic acid (1 μm; see Ref. 36L. M Alleva K Kirk Molecular Approaches to Malaria (Macreadie, M., ed).Abstracts. Lorne, Australia2000: p.54Google Scholar), findings consistent with the inhibitor susceptibility profile of PfATP4 in Xenopus oocytes (see Fig. 3 and “Results”). These latter observations suggest that PfATP4 may therefore also be important in maintaining relatively low intraparasitic [Ca2+]free in the face of up to ∼1 mm [Ca2+]free, encountered as merozoites enter plasma (37Krishna S. Squire-Pollard L. Parasitol. Today. 1990; 6: 196-198Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The importance of other secondary mechanisms for Ca2+ homeostasis, such as the action of Ca2+/H+ antiporters, remains to be determined. The transition from an intracellular to an extracellular environment is common to many apicomplexan organisms that encode orthologues of PfATP4 and that may therefore share similar mechanisms for [Ca2+] homeostasis. As P type ATPases are susceptible to highly selective inhibition, this subclass of [Ca2+] pump presents an enticing target for antiparasitic drug development. Identification of potential inhibitors will undoubtedly be accelerated by the recent solution of the crystal structure for SERCA 1a (38Toyoshima C. Nakasako M. Nomura H. Ogawa H. Nature. 2000; 405: 647-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar). We thank Dr. Lisa Alleva, Prof. Kiaran Kirk, Dr. Ursula Eckstein-Ludwig, and Prof. Tony Lee for helpful discussions.

https://openalex.org/W2326160172,"Bloom's syndrome (BS), a rare genetic disease, arises through mutations in both alleles of the BLM gene which encodes a 3'-5' DNA helicase identified as a member of the RecQ family. BS patients exhibit a high predisposition to development of all types of cancer affecting the general population and BLM-deficient cells display a strong genetic instability. We recently showed that BLM protein expression is regulated during the cell cycle, accumulating to high levels in S phase, persisting in G2/M and sharply declining in G1, suggesting a possible implication of BLM in a replication (S phase) and/or post-replication (G2 phase) process. Here we show that, in response to ionizing radiation, BLM-deficient cells exhibit a normal p53 response as well as an intact G1/S cell cycle checkpoint, which indicates that ATM and p53 pathways are functional in BS cells. We also show that the BLM defect is associated with a partial escape of cells from the gamma-irradiation-induced G2/M cell cycle checkpoint. Finally, we present data demonstrating that, in response to ionizing radiation, BLM protein is phosphorylated and accumulates through an ATM-dependent pathway. Altogether, our data indicate that BLM participates in the cellular response to ionizing radiation by acting as an ATM kinase downstream effector."
https://openalex.org/W2033708368,"Fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) is an orphan nuclear receptor that activates the α1-fetoprotein gene during early liver developmental growth. Here we sought to define better the position of FTF in transcriptional cascades leading to hepatic differentiation. The mouse FTF gene was isolated and assigned to chromosome 1 band E4 (one mFTF pseudogene was also found). Exon/intron mapping shows an mFTF gene structure similar to that of its close homologue SF1, with two more N-terminal exons in the mFTF gene; exon mapping also delimits several FTF mRNA 5′- and 3′-splice variants. The mFTF transcription initiation site was located in adult liver at 238 nucleotides from the first translation initiator codon, with six canonical GATA, E box, and Nkx motifs clustered between −50/−140 base pairs (bp) from the cap site; DNA/protein binding assays also pinpointed an HNF4-binding element at +36 bp and an FTF-binding element at −257 bp. Transfection assays and point mutations showed that the mFTF promoter is activated by GATA, HNF4α, FTF, Nkx, and basic helix-loop-helix factors, with marked cooperativity between GATA and HNF4α. A tandem GATA/E box activatory motif in the proximal mFTF promoter is strikingly similar to a composite motif coactivated by differentiation inducers in the hematopoietic lineage; a tandem GATA-Nkx motif in the distal mFTF promoter is also similar to a composite motif transducing differentiation signals from transforming growth factor-β-like receptors in the cardiogenic lineage. Three genes encoding transcription factors critical to early hepatic differentiation,Hnf3β, Hnf4α, andHnf1α, each contain dual FTF-binding elements in their proximal promoters, and all three promoters are activated by FTF in transfection assays. Direct DNA binding action and cooperativity was demonstrated between FTF and HNF3β on the Hnf3βpromoter and between FTF and HNF4α on the Hnf1αpromoter. These combined results suggest that FTF is an early intermediary between endodermal specification signals and downstream genes that establish and amplify the hepatic phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W1987449626,"The most common chromosomal translocation in liposarcomas, t(12;16)(q13;p11), creates the FUS/TLS-CHOP fusion gene. We previously developed a mouse model of liposarcoma by expressing FUS-CHOP in murine mesenchymal stem cells. In order to understand how FUS-CHOP can initiate liposarcoma, we have now generated transgenic mice expressing altered forms of the FUS-CHOP protein. Transgenic mice expressing high levels of CHOP, which lacks the FUS domain, do not develop any tumor despite its tumorigenicity in vitro and widespread activity of the EF1alpha promoter. These animals consistently show the accumulation of a glycoprotein material within the terminally differentiated adipocytes, a characteristic figure of liposarcomas associated with FUS-CHOP. On the contrary, transgenic mice expressing the altered form of FUS-CHOP created by the in frame fusion of the FUS domain to the carboxy end of CHOP (CHOP-FUS) developed liposarcomas. No tumors of other tissues were found in these transgenic mice despite widespread activity of the EF1alpha promoter. The characteristics of the liposarcomas arising in the CHOP-FUS mice were very similar to those previously observed in our FUS-CHOP transgenic mice indicating that the FUS domain is required not only for transformation but also influences the phenotype of the tumor cells. These results provide evidence that the FUS domain of FUS-CHOP plays a specific and critical role in the pathogenesis of liposarcoma."

Kostner G.M. FEBS Lett. 1979; 102: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Whereas the physiologic function of β2GPI has not been deduced, β2GPI interacts specifically with lipoprotein(a) (2Köchl S. Fresser F. Lobentanz E. Baier G. Utermann G. Blood. 1997; 90: 1482-1489Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the endothelial cell protein annexin II (3Ma K. Simantov R. Zhang J.-C. Silverstein R. Hajjar A. McRae K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 15541-15548Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). At least in vitro, β2GPI acts as an inhibitor of the intrinsic blood coagulation pathway (4Schousboe I. Blood. 1985; 66: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), ADP-mediated platelet aggregation, and the prothrombinase activity of activated platelets (5Nimpf J. Wurm H. Kostner G.M. Atherosclerosis. 1987; 63: 109-114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). β2GPI binds to negatively charged cell surfaces such as those on activated platelets, probably by binding to negatively charged molecules such as heparan sulfate cell surface proteoglycans and anionic phospholipids. It is this latter property that has been proposed to be most clinically relevant. Interest in β2GPI increased dramatically shortly after it was discovered that this plasma protein is the most common antigen in patients with the “anti-phospholipid syndrome” (APS). (6Kandiah D.A. Sali A. Sheng Y. Victoria E.J. Marquis D.M. Coutts S.M. Krilis S.A. Adv. Immunol. 1998; 70: 507-563Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The term “anti-phospholipid” is a misnomer because most of the antibodies generated in this human autoimmune disorder are not directed against phospholipids as first thought but rather against the β2GPI component of the macromolecular complex. The presence of anti-β2GPI antibodies in these patients correlates well with thrombosis, miscarriages, and thrombocytopenia (6Kandiah D.A. Sali A. Sheng Y. Victoria E.J. Marquis D.M. Coutts S.M.

It contains large numbers of Pro and Cys residues, and it is heavily glycosylated. β2GPI is a member of the complement control, short consensus repeat superfamily of proteins. The first four homologous repeat regions consist of ∼60 amino acids with 4 conserved Cys residues that form 2 disulfide bonds in each domain. The fifth domain in β2GPI differs in that it contains 80 amino acids and 3 disulfide bonds. The amino acid sequences of mouse and human β2GPI are 76% identical, and the β2GPI transcript in both species is ∼1.2 kb in size. The nucleotide sequence of the entire mouse β2GPI gene has been deduced (8Sheng Y. Herzog H. Krilis S.A. Genomics. 1997; 41: 128-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). It is ∼18 kb in size and consists of eight exons. By using a homologous recombination approach, we now describe the generation and initial characterization of transgenic mice unable to express β2GPI. A mouse β2GPI genomic clone spanning ∼18 kb that was previously isolated and sequenced from a 129/Sv genomic P1 library (Genome Systems, Inc., St. Louis, MO) (8Sheng Y. Herzog H. Krilis S.A.

The targeting vector contained PGK-Neo as the positive selection marker and herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene (HSV-tk) as the negative selection marker. The 5′ portion of the construct contained a 3.5-kbHindIII-AccI fragment, with exon 1 and part of exon 2. The 3′ portion of the construct contained a 3.5-kbXhoI-XhoI fragment, with exon 4. The HSVtk, PGK-Neo, and vector backbone were from the PGKNeo cassette (9Tybulewicz V.L.J. Crawford C.E. Jackson P.K. Bronson R.T. Mulligan R.C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1153-1163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1156) Google Scholar). Thirty micrograms of the targeting vector was linearized with NotI, electroporated into 2.5 × 107 embryonic stem (ES) cells (129/Sv). Clones were selected with G418 and ganciclovir according to the method described previously for other genes (10Köntgen F. Stewart C.L. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 878-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Single clones were selected after 10 days. Isolated DNA was digested with XbaI and separated by routine gel electrophoresis, and the resulting DNA blots were analyzed with a 32P-labeled mouse β2GPI probe (0.4 kb), located within intron 4 just outside the targeting vector (named probe A). An ES cell clone that had undergone homologous recombination was injected into C57BL/6 mouse blastocysts (10Köntgen F. Stewart C.L. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 878-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), and the resulting chimeric males were bred with C57BL/6 females. Germ line transmission of the disrupted allele was determined by the presence of agouti mice in the offspring. Mice were genotyped by isolating genomic DNA from tail biopsies and analyzed by Southern blotting using probe A. For RNA blot analysis, total RNA was prepared from mouse livers by using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Ten micrograms of denatured total RNA was separated by formaldehyde-agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (HybondTM-N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and cross-linked to the membrane by ultraviolet light. The membrane was hybridized with a 0.5-kb mouse β2GPI cDNA probe corresponding to exons 1–5. Plasma from wild type (+/+), heterozygote (+/−), and homozygote (−/−) mice were separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Each membrane was incubated in Tris-buffered saline (TBS), 0.1% Tween 20, 10% skim milk to minimize nonspecific binding. The membrane was then incubated with a 1/1000 dilution of affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-β2GPI antibody in 1% bovine serum albumin/TBS. Bound protein was detected by ECL-enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), using a 1/1000 dilution of a goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) in 1% bovine serum albumin/TBS. Normal rabbit IgG at the same concentration as the rabbit anti-β2GPI antibody was used as a negative control. SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis was performed on five separate occasions using plasma from 10 mice (5 female and 5 male) from each group aged from 4 to 8 weeks old. Quantitation of β2GPI protein in +/+ and +/− mice was also assayed by serial dilution of pooled plasma from each group of mice by Western blot analysis using rabbit anti-β2GPI antibody. Purified mouse β2GPI at 5, 10, and 20 ng per lane was used as a standard. Histological examination was performed on 5 male and female homozygous mutant animals aged 4–9 months, and a total of 5 normal wild type and heterozygous littermates. Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, processed for paraffin embedding according to standard methods, and sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Blood was recovered by cardiac puncture into EDTA-coated Capiject tubes (Terumo) from female virgin or day-18 pregnant β2GPI +/− and β2GPI −/− mice at 12–16 weeks of age after anesthesia with avertin (1 mg/ml tribromoethyl alcohol in tertiary amyl alcohol (Sigma) diluted to 2.5% v/v in saline; 15 μl/g body weight injected intraperitoneally). The concentration of platelets in blood was determined using a Technicon H2 automated hematology analyzer (Bayer Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY). Mice were housed in groups of 3–5 per cage, kept in a pathogen-free environment, and raised under standard conditions, 23 ± 1 °C, 12-h light/12-h dark cycles with free access to food (normal chow diet) and water ad libitum. The mice were hybrids between the C57BL/6 and 129/Sv strains. All procedures were conducted with the approval of the University of New South Wales Animal Care and Ethics Committees. Adult females (10–12 weeks, β2GPI +/+, β2GPI +/− or β2GPI −/−) were housed 2:1 with adult stud males (β2GPI +/+ or β2GPI −/−, as specified in the text) and allowed to mate naturally. Females were separated from males and housed in groups of 2–3 on the day at which a copulation plug was evident, nominated day 1 of pregnancy. Pregnant mice were sacrificed on day 18 of pregnancy for determination of numbers of implantation sites and platelet counts or allowed to proceed to term for determination of litter size, individual pup weight, and survival to weaning. All coagulation tests were performed on an Automated Coagulation Machine (ACL-3000 Plus, Coagulation System Instrumentation Laboratory, Milano, Italy). Mouse blood samples from 15 homozygous mutant mice and equal numbers of age- and sex-matched wild type and heterozygous controls were collected in 0.11 m sodium citrate (9:1, v/v) via direct cardiac puncture as described previously. Plasma was centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 20 min, collected, filtered through a 0.22-μm filter to remove platelet fragments, and stored at −70 °C until analysis. The following coagulation tests was performed with each genotype plasma: dilute kaolin clotting time (dKCT); dilute Russell Viper venom time (dRVVT); activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT); and a protein C pathway screening test. The dKCT was performed according to Exner et al. (11Exner T. Rickard K.A. Kronenberg H. Br. J. Haematol. 1978; 40: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). The dRVVT was performed according to Thiagarajan et al. (12Thiagarajan P. Shapiro S.S. De Marco L. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 66: 397-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) using the LA screen and LA confirm reagents from Gradipore (Gradipore, North Ryde, Australia). The aPTT was performed according to the manufacturers' instructions using cephalin to activate the intrinsic pathway of coagulation (Sigma). A protein C pathway screening test (GradiThrom PCP) using a dRVVT methodology and purified protein C activator from Agkistrodon contortrix (Gradipore) was performed according to the manufacturers' instructions. The activity of the coagulation factors II, V, and VII–XII was determined as a clotting time after mixing the murine plasma with human plasma, deficient in the specific factor, and the addition of appropriate activator (13Rosen E. Chan J.Y. Idusogie E. Clotman F. Vlasuk G. Luther T. Jalbert L.R. Albrecht S. Zhong L. Lissens A. Schoonjans L. Moons L. Collen D. Castellino F.J. Carmeliet P. Nature. 1997; 390: 290-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). A standard curve was constructed by log-log plot of the clotting time (either aPTT or PT) of various dilutions of pooled β2GPI+/+ plasma (assumed to represent 100% activity). The specific factor activity of β2GPI +/− and β2GPI −/− plasma was derived as the mean activity of at least two dilutions extrapolated from the standard curve. All pro-coagulant activities were expressed as a percentage of the pro-coagulant activity in a pooled plasma of adult wild type mice. A chromogenic assay was used to determine the rate of thrombin generation over time. The plasma used in this assay was defibrinated as follows. Plasma was spun at 3,000 × gfor 20 min and filtered through 0.22-μm filter. Aliquots were collected in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and placed into a shaking water bath at 53 °C for 20 min and then centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and stored at −70 °C for use. All reagents in the thrombin generation assay were diluted in 0.9% NaCl. A mixture of 25 μl of diluted (1:9) thromboplastin (Sigma), 25 μl of 0.9% NaCl, and 50 μl of 1:1 dilution of defibrinated plasma from the three groups of mice were added to wells of a microtiter plate and pre-warmed to 37 °C for 10 min. Then 50 μl of 1 mm spectrozyme, a chromogenic substrate for thrombin (American Diagnostica), and 50 μl of 30 mm calcium chloride were added sequentially. Background thrombin generation was determined in the absence of thromboplastin. The plates were read immediately and every 30 s thereafter at 405 nm at room temperature in an automated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader (Molecular Devices Spectro Max 250 with Softmax Pro 1.2 software) until thrombin generation had reached a plateau, usually after 20 min. Plotting thrombin generation over time yielded a sigmoidal curve. Alteration in the rate of thrombin generation by heterozygous or homozygous mice was examined in duplicate wells, and the result was expressed as a percentage of the wild type optical density at the time that the wild type curve reached half-maximal OD. An 18-kb β2GPI genomic clone obtained from a mouse 129/Sv library was used to construct the targeting vector (Fig. 1 A) for homologous recombination. A β2GPI-null allele was produced in the targeting vector by replacing a 4.7-kb portion of the gene containing part of exon 2 and the entire exon 3 with a neomycin resistance cassette. Two correctly targeted ES clones were identified among 700 G418/ganciclovir-resistant clones. Correct integration of the targeting construct on the opposite side was confirmed by DNA blot analysis using a probe adjacent to the targeting construct (data not shown). Analysis of the blot with the neomycin resistance gene revealed no additional integration event in the two clones (data not shown). One of the successfully targeted ES clones heterozygous for disruption of the β2GPI locus was injected into blastocysts derived from C57BL/6 females to generate chimeric mice. Chimeric mice were bred with each other, and subsequent mice of the three expected genotypes β2GPI +/+, β2GPI +/−, and β2GPI −/− were obtained by interbreeding of the heterozygous offspring. Southern blot analysis of DNA obtained from the tails of these animals was used to determine their genotype (Fig.1 B). Restriction enzyme digestion of the wild type β2GPI mouse locus with XbaI generates a 10.5-kb fragment for the 129/Sv strain or a 2.8-kb fragment for the C57BL/6 strain, whereas the correctly targeted locus generates a 5.7-kb fragment (Fig.1 B). Northern blot analysis was performed to confirm the loss of β2GPI gene expression in the surviving β2GPI −/− mice. As shown in Fig.2 A, no transcript was observed in RNA samples isolated from liver tissue of β2GPI −/− mice when hybridized with a highly specific radiolabeled cDNA probe encoding exons 1–5 (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, the expected 1.2-kb full-length transcript was present in the liver of β2GPI +/+ and +/− mice when analyzed in parallel. A β−actin probe was hybridized to the same blot after removal of the β2GPI probe to assess the amount of RNA loaded in each lane (lower panel in Fig.2 A). Based on the structure of the gene targeting construct, we expected that mice homozygous for the mutation would be unable to produce functional β2GPI protein. Plasma from 6-week-old mice was tested by Western blot using a rabbit polyclonal anti-β2GPI antibody. The antibody reacted with the expected 50-kDa protein band present in wild type and β2GPI +/− mice (Fig. 2 B). However, no such immunoreactive band was detected in the plasma from β2GPI −/− mice. Furthermore, analysis of serial dilutions of plasma from +/+ and +/− mice (Fig. 2 C) revealed that the heterozygotes contained approximately half the concentration of β2GPI in their plasma relative to wild type mice. Thus, an abnormality in β2GPI expression was even seen in +/− mice. Six pairs of male and female β2GPI +/− mice were caged separately and allowed to breed naturally for periods ranging from 4 to 8 months. All females carried at least four viable pregnancies during this period, with a mean ± S.D. of 1.2 ± 0.3 litters of month. The mean ± S.D. litter size was 9.2 ± 2.2 pups (total of 39 litters), of which 97% (347/357) were viable at 24 h of age. Genotypes of the progeny were determined at 3 weeks of age. Of the 336 successfully genotyped offspring, 121 were wild type, 185 were heterozygous, and only 30 were homozygous for the disrupted allele, which is a statistically significant (p < 0.005) deviation from the expected 1:2:1 ratio. Gross histologic examination of heart, lung, thymus, spleen, lymph nodes, liver, gallbladder, kidneys, urinary bladder, reproductive tract, stomach, small intestine, cecum, colon, pancreas, brain, eyes, and skeletal muscle did not reveal any pathological changes associated with the homozygous mutation. The effect of homozygous mutation on reproductive performance was investigated in further experiments. Initially, β2GPI −/− and β2GPI +/+ male mice were mated with C57BL/6 female mice. Each of six males from each genotype mated successfully with females and sired pregnancies. Female β2GPI −/− and β2GPI +/+ mice were then mated naturally with adult stud males of the same genotype, and pregnancies were allowed to proceed to term. Neither the interval between placing with males and discovery of a vaginal plug nor the proportion of plugged females delivering live pups was affected by the β2GPI genotype. The duration of pregnancy, the number of pups born, and their viability and weight at 24 h and at weaning were comparable in β2GPI −/− and β2GPI +/+ pregnancies (TableI), indicating a normal reproductive potential for β2GPI −/− mice.Table IEffect of genetic deficiency in β2GP1 on fertility and fecundity in miceMale β2GP1 +/+Male β2GP1 −/−Female β2GP1 +/+ or +/−Female β2GP1 −/−No. of plugged mice pregnant at term (%)15/17 (88%)16/20 (80%)Litter size at birth8.2 + 1.17.9 + 1.6Weight of pups at birth (g)1.51 + 0.131.53 + 0.12Viability at 24 h (%)122/123 (99%)112/116 (97%)Viability at 3 weeks (%)120/123 (98%)112/116 (97%)Data are mean + S.D.

To determine the effect of β2GPI deficiency on platelet counts in pregnancy, blood was recovered by cardiac puncture from adult virgin β2GPI −/− and β2GPI +/+ mice on day 18 of pregnancy and from β2GPI −/− and β2GPI +/+ female mice mated naturally with adult stud males of the same β2GPI status. Whereas pregnancy was associated with an increase in mean blood platelet count of 35%, there was no significant effect of β2GPI deficiency in either the virgin or pregnant state (Table II). Furthermore, there was no effect of β2GPI deficiency on the number of implantation sites at day 18 (mean ± S.D. = 9.3 ± 2.9 in β2GPI +/+ mice and 8.2 ± 2.8 in β2GPI −/− mice, n = 6 per group) or on the proportion of resorption sites (5/56 in β2GPI +/+ mice and 1/49 in β2GPI −/− mice, n = 6 per group).Table IIThe effect of genetic deficiency in β2GPI on platelet numbers in blood of virgin and day 18 pregnant miceβ2GP1 +/+ or +/−β2GP1 −/−Virgin697 + 109 (10)664 + 185 (7)Day 18 pregnant 2-ap = 0.001versus virgin, data compared by Student's unpairedt test.924 + 178 (6)928 + 226 (6)Data are mean + S.D. × 10−3 platelets/μl.

The role of β2GPI in coagulation profiles was examined using a number of hematologic parameters. Analysis of pooled plasma from β2GPI+/+, β2GPI+/−, and β2GPI−/− mice (5 mice in each group; the experiment has been repeated on three occasions) revealed no significant differences in dKCT, dRVVT, aPTT nor protein C pathways among the three groups of animals (Table III).Table IIICoagulation profile of plasma from β2GPI +/+, +/−, and −/− mice+/++/−−/−dRVVT(s)17.8 ± 218.5 ± 1.619.3 ± 1.4dKCT(s)53.7 ± 6.259.5 ± 8.956.5 ± 2.5APTT(s)24 ± 0.523.1 ± 1.823.4 ± 2.8Protein C pathway(s)22.4 ± 1.423.7 ± 0.823.6 ± 0.2Data represents mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments using pooled plasma samples from five mice of each genotype expressed as the clot time in seconds. Open table in a new tab Data represents mean ± S.D. of three separate experiments using pooled plasma samples from five mice of each genotype expressed as the clot time in seconds. The activity of coagulation factors II, V, and VII–XII was assessed in the three mouse genotypes. Specific factor assays in normal and defibrinated plasma revealed similar levels for the factors assayed in all three genotypes (data not shown). In the in vitro chromogenic assay of thrombin generation, the pooled plasma samples (Fig.3 A) or the individual plasma samples (Fig. 3 B) from β2GPI −/− mice had significantly less thrombin generation compared with that obtained from β2GPI +/+ or β2GPI +/− mice. Fig. 3 A demonstrates that the average time point required to reach half-maximal optical density (OD405 nm = 0.55) was 1050 s for β2GPI +/+ mice and 2100 s for the β2GPI +/− mice. In contrast, plasma from β2GPI −/− mice did not reach the half-maximal optical density even after 3000 s. Similar results were obtained when plasma from two further groups of 15 mice were analyzed in the thrombin generation assay. Mixing equal parts of β2GPI +/+ and β2GPI −/− mouse plasma produced a thrombin generation curve similar to that of the heterozygote plasma (data not shown). The mean value (OD405 nm) of thrombin generation of 10 individual plasma samples from each population of animals (Fig.3 B) was measured at 1000 s. The mean value for β2GPI −/− was 0.175, which represents 69% less than the result for β2GPI +/+ mice and 40% less than that for β2GPI +/− mice. The difference in thrombin generation between β2GPI +/+ and β2GPI −/− mice was highly significant by one-way analysis of variance (p = 0.0051). We generated β2GPI null mice to determine the function of this plasma protein in hemostasis and reproduction. Evidence in support of the view that we targeted the appropriate gene was obtained by DNA, RNA, and SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis. The obtained data confirm that there is only one β2GPI gene in the mouse and that this gene was inactivated in the ES cell lines and the subsequent mutant mice. β2GPI-null mice were born at significantly lower Mendelian ratios with only 8.9% of the offspring of heterozygous crosses being homozygous (−/−) for the disrupted allele. This finding suggested that β2GPI might play an important role in embryonic development or implantation; therefore, further experiments were undertaken to investigate reproductive function in those β2GPI-null mice that proceeded to develop on a C57BL/6 background. Reproductive outcomes were indistinguishable from control mice in both males and females carrying the β2GPI null mutation, in terms of the proportion of animals that bred successfully and the number of viable pups born at term and surviving to weaning. Furthermore, there was no evidence of altered blood platelet counts in either virgin or pregnant mice. Together, these data show that β2GPI is not essential for normal reproductive function. However, the data from heterozygote pregnancies indicate that β2GPI deficiency might pose a selective disadvantage to survival of a conceptus gestating in a β2GPI-replete maternal environment. Since litter sizes were comparable in heterozygote and wild type pregnancies, any loss of β2GPI −/− embryos might occur early in pregnancy at, or prior to, the time of implantation. However, because ganciclovir can induce nonspecific point mutations in genes, we cannot rule out the possibility that the initial fetal viability problem was caused by ganciclovir-induced alteration of another gene. In addition if a more severe fetal viability phenotype than the initial β2-GPI null mice was obtained after backcrossing with either the 129/Sv or BALB/c mouse strains, this would indicate an important role for β2-GPI in fetal development. One of the most striking observations of the β2GPI −/− mice is that they have a significantly diminished rate of thrombin generation compared with β2GPI +/+ and β2GPI +/− mice. However, no significant differences in clotting time were observed in plasma from these three genotypes when measured by dRVVT, dKCT, aPTT, and protein C pathway assays. Our data demonstrate that the reduction or absence of β2GPI diminishes thrombin generation in a dose-dependent manner. A similar prolongation of thrombin generation was observed following the addition of anti-β2GPI antibodies to normal human plasma, regardless of whether the antibody was of mouse monoclonal or APS patient origin (14Hanly, J. G., Kandiah, D., Kouts, S., Sheng, Y., Koike, T., Ichikawa, K., Monestier, M., Krilis, S. A., Lupus, 7, 1998, 219, (Abstr. B066).Google Scholar). The conventional coagulation assays used in this paper (aPTT, dRVVT, dKCT) measure the time to generate a thrombin-dependent clot. This usually takes less than 1 min in plasma using the above tests. However, the time to form a clot is a poor indicator of thrombin generation because it occurs before peak thrombin production (15Rand M.D. Lock J.B. van't Veer C. Gaffney D.P. Mann K.G. Blood. 1996; 88: 3432-3445Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The use of a colorimetric thrombin substrate in defibrinated plasma gives more reliable information about thrombin generation over time. This may be of importance clinically as APS patients have evidence of a continuously elevated level of thrombin (16Ginsberg J.S. Demers C. Brill-Edwards P. Johnston M. Bona R. Burrows R.F. Weitz J. Denburg J.A. Blood. 1993; 81: 2958-2963Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and an ongoing tendency to thrombosis. Schousboe (4Schousboe I. Blood. 1985; 66: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that β2GPI inhibits the contact activation of the intrinsic blood coagulation pathway due to its ability to interact with negatively charged surfaces, which in turn are necessary for the activation of factor XII. On the other hand, Mori and co-workers (17Mori T. Takeya H. Nishioka J. Gabazza E.C. Suzuki K. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 75: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) showed that β2GPI can inhibit the anticoagulant activity of activated protein C. Thus, currently it is not clear whether β2GPI in vivo has anticoagulant or procoagulant properties. It has recently been demonstrated the β2GPI-dependent activation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells by IgG autoantibodies from patients with APS, as measured by increased expression of adhesion molecules (18Del Papa N. Sheng Y. Raschi E. Kandiah D.A. Tincani A. Kamashta M.A. Hughes G.R.V. Koike T. Balestrieri G. Krilis S.A. Meroni P.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5572-5578PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that autoantibodies directed against β2GPI induce endothelial cell activation, which in the presence of some other insult may trigger a thrombotic event (18Del Papa N. Sheng Y. Raschi E. Kandiah D.A. Tincani A. Kamashta M.A. Hughes G.R.V. Koike T. Balestrieri G. Krilis S.A. Meroni P.L. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5572-5578PubMed Google Scholar). β2GPI has also been shown to bind preferentially oxidized low density lipoproteins, thereby providing a link between anti-β2GPI antibodies and atherogenesis (19Matsuura E. Kobayashi K. Yasuda T. Koike T. Lupus. 1998; 7: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The physiological and clinical significance of the in vitroinhibition of thrombin generation is unclear at this time. The generation of thrombin is important for both thrombus formation and for the initiation of the protein C anticoagulation pathway. It has been reported that β2GPI deficiency in humans is not common in patients with thrombosis (20Bancsi L.F.J.M.M. van der Linden I.K. Bertina R.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1992; 67: 649-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and does not result in a significant perturbation of lipoprotein metabolism (21Hoeg J.M. Segal P. Gregg R.E. Chang Y.S. Lindgren F.T. Adamson G.L. Frank M. Brickman C. Brewer Jr., H.B. Atherosclerosis. 1985; 55: 25-34Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). However, population studies of the effect of β2GPI deficiency have not been performed. In summary, analysis of our β2GPI-null mice reveal a possible role of this plasma protein in early embryonic fetal development in some mouse strains. However, any function of β2GPI is likely to be limited to providing a selective advantage at implantation since normal reproductive function was observed in crosses between null mutant male and female mice. Because mutating the β2GPI gene results in significantly less thrombin generation in vitro, β2GPI may have a prothrombotic role in vivo. However, since this decrease in thrombin generation has only been demonstrated in vitro, it still remains to be determined if this also holdsin vivo. The β2GPI-null mice generated in this study will provide a valuable in vivo model system for exploring the role of β2GPI in disease pathogenesis. We thank Rosalie Gemmell for assistance with coagulation assays, Dr. Frank Köntgen for assistance in deriving the β2GPI knockout mice, and Dr. Jan Guerin for a critical review of this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2090109154,"SIAH-1, a human homologue of the Drosophila seven in absentia (Sina), has been implicated in ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis of different target proteins through its N-terminal RING finger domain. SIAH-1 is also induced during p53-mediated apoptosis. Furthermore, SIAH-1-transfected breast cancer cell line MCF-7 exhibits an altered mitotic process resulting in multinucleated giant cells. Now, using the two-hybrid system, we identified two new SIAH interacting proteins: Kid (kinesin like DNA binding protein) and α-tubulin. We demonstrate that SIAH is involved in the degradation of Kid via the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. Our results suggest that SIAH-1 but not its N-terminal deletion mutant, affects the mitosis by an enhanced reduction of kinesin levels. Our results imply, for the first time, SIAH-1 in regulating the degradation of proteins directly implicated in the mitotic process."

Here we report an MAE that is observed for a putatively high level of visual analysis-attentive tracking. These high-level MAEs, visible on dynamic (but not static) tests, suggest that attentive tracking does not simply enhance low-level motion signals but, rather, acts at a subsequent stage. MAEs from tracking (1) can overrule competing MAEs from adaptation to low-level motion, (2) can be established opposite to low-level MAEs seen on static tests at the same location, and (3), most striking, are specific to the overall direction of object motion, even at nonadapted locations. These distinctive properties suggest MAEs from attentive tracking can serve as valuable probes for understanding the mechanisms of high-level vision and attention."
https://openalex.org/W2062758517,"Sensory axons extend from the chick olfactory epithelium to the telencephalon well before the maturation of their target, the olfactory bulb. During a waiting period of several days, olfactory axons arrive and accumulate outside the CNS while the bulb differentiates beneath them. Semephorin-3A is expressed in the tel-encephalon during this period and has been proposed to prevent their entry into the CNS. We show that the misexpression of a dominant-negative neuropilin-1 that blocks SEMA-3A-mediated signaling in olfactory sensory axons induces many of them to enter the tel-encephalon prematurely and to overshoot the olfactory bulb. These results suggest that chemorepellents can prevent the premature innervation of immature targets."
https://openalex.org/W2168079133,"Inhibitory glycine receptors (GlyRs) are mainly expressed in the spinal cord and in the midbrain, where they control motor and sensory pathways. We describe here a fast potentiation of GlyR by intracellular Ca2+. This phenomenon was observed in rat spinal cord neurons and in transfected human cell lines. Potentiation develops in <100 ms, is proportional to Ca2+ influx, and is characterized by an increase in GlyR apparent affinity for glycine. Phosphorylation and G protein pathways appear not to be involved in the potentiation mechanism. Single-channel recordings in cell-attached and excised patches, as well as whole-cell data suggest the presence of a diffusible cytoplasmic factor that modulates the GlyR channel gating properties. Ca2+-induced potentiation may be important for rapid modulation of glycinergic synapses."

Chem. 1995; 270: 21291-21298Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), to name but a few, contain within their genes a 21-base pair DNA sequence referred to as the neuron-restrictive silencer element (NRSE).1 This element is also called repressor element-1 (RE-1) (1Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G. Cell. 1995; 80: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar). The transcription factor that binds to NRSE/RE-1 is known as the neuron-restrictive silencer factor (NRSF)/RE-1-silencing transcription factor (REST). It is a 210-kDa glycoprotein containing nine zinc finger domains whose expression appears limited to nonneuronal cell types. NRSF/REST can also act as a silencer of neuron-specific gene expression in undifferentiated neuronal progenitor cells (1Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C.

Science. 1995; 267: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the absence of the NRSE/RE-1 sequence (9Kallunki P. Edelman G.M. Jones F.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1343-1354Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) or expression of a dominant negative form of NRSF/REST produces expression of target genes in nonneuronal cells (10Chen Z.-F. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). A mouse model in which the NRSF/REST gene was deleted, although embryonic lethal, showed aberrant expression of SCG10 and tubulin βIII in nonneuronal tissues (10Chen Z.-F. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). A number of splice variants of NRSF/REST have been reported (11Palm K. Belluardo N. Metsis M. Timmusk T. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1280-1296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two of these, REST4 and REST5, were found to be expressed at low levels in mature neurons of adult brain (11Palm K. Belluardo N. Metsis M. Timmusk T. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1280-1296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These splice variants contain an insertion between zinc finger domains 5 and 6 that leads to truncated proteins containing only five of the nine zinc finger domains found in NRSF/REST. We previously suggested that, at least in PC12 cells, one of these isoforms, REST4, regulates cholinergic gene expression. The mechanism appears to involve formation of hetero-oligomers between REST4 and NRSF/REST, which prevents binding of NRSF/REST to the NRSE/RE-1 sequence (12Shimojo M. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Hersh L.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6788-6795Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). To further study the function of NRSF/REST and REST4, we have prepared and studied deletion constructs as well as constructs containing point mutations that cause disruption of the structure of individual Cys2-His2 type zinc finger domains. The results of these studies suggest that proper zinc finger structure is important for DNA binding as well as for nuclear localization. Deoxyribonucleotides, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized with a Beckman Oligo1000 DNA synthesizer or purchased from commercial sources. [γ-32P]ATP was from ICN (Irvine, CA). The BCA protein assay kit was obtained from Pierce. Poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The ECL Western blotting detection system and HybondTM-P membranes were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Effectene Transfection Reagent and Qiagen plasmid kit were obtained from Qiagen Inc. (Valencia, CA). The pcDNA3 expression vector was obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA), while pEGFP and pCMVβ were obtained fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). All other reagents were from Sigma and were of the highest quality available. Constructs containing green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to REST4 were generated by subcloning the HindIII–BamHI fragment of corresponding FLAG-REST4 constructs into pEGFP. Mutations were generated by the QuickChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using NRSF/REST or GFP-REST4 as the DNA template and the following oligonucleotide pairs as primers: 5′-C AAA GGC CCC ATC CGCCGT GAC CGC TGT GGC TAC-3′ and 5′-GTA GCC ACA GCG GTCACG GCG GAT GGG GCC TTT G-3′ (for Z2mut), 5′-GAG CGC ATC TAC AAG CGT ATC ATC TGC ACG TAC-3′ and 5′-GTA CGT GCA GAT GAT ACG CTT GTA GAT GCG CTC-3′ (for Z3mut), 5′-GG AAA GTC TAC ACC CGT AGC AAG TGC AAC TAC-3′ and 5′-GTA GTT GCA CTT GCT ACG GGT GTA GAC TTT CC-3′ (for Z4mut), 5′-GAA CGC CCG TAT AAA CGG GAA CTT TGT CCT TAC-3′ and 5′-GTA AGG ACA AAG TTC CCG TTT ATA CGG GCG TTC-3′ (for Z5mut), 5′-GAG AAG CCA TTT AAA CGG GAT GAG TGC AAT TAT G-3′ and 5′-C ATA ATT GCA CTC ATC CCG TTT AAA TGG CTT CTC-3′ (for Z6mut), 5′-CCT AAA CCT CTT AAT CGT CCG CAC TGT GAC TAC-3′ and 5′-GTA GTC ACA GTG CGG ACG ATT AAG AGG TTT AGG-3′ (for Z7mut), 5′-CCA CGG CAG TTC AAC CGT CCC GTG TGT GAC TAC-3′ and 5′-GTA GTC ACA CAC GGG ACG GTT GAA CTG CCG TGG-3′ (for Z8mut). Underlined nucleotides denote changes introduced (Cys to Arg). The identities of the plasmid constructs were verified by the cycle sequencing method using Sequenase (U.S. Biochemical Corp.). For the preparation of β-galactosidase fused to zinc finger domains 2–5 (Z2,3,4,5) or to zinc finger domains 2–4 (Z2,3,4), appropriate fragments were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction from an NRSF/REST template. Primers used were as follows: Z2S, 5′-GAT GGA CTA CAA GGA CGA CGA CGA CAA GCC CAT CCG CTG TGA CCG CTG-3′; Z4AS, 5′-GGG CGT TCT CCT GTG TGA GT-3′; Z5AS, TCA CCT GAA TGA GTC CGC AT-3′. The amplified products were cloned into the SmaI site of pBSSK. AHindIII/BamHI fragment was cloned into β-galactosidase-pcDNA3. The latter was created by inserting the β-galactosidase gene from pCMVβ (CLONTECH) into the NotI site of pcDNA3. The preparation of deletion mutants was as described in Lee et al. (13Lee J.-H. Shimojo M. Chai Y.-G. Hersh L.B. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 80: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). These cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 10% CO2. Transfections were performed with the use of the Effectene Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. NIH3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For transfection with GFP or β-galactosidase-containing constructs, cells were plated on 100-mm2 glass coverslips at a density of 105cells/coverslip on the day before transfection. The cells were transfected with GFP-tagged or β-galactosidase-tagged expression constructs using the Effectene Transfection Reagent. For visualizing, GFP cells were grown for 24 h and then fixed in dry ice-methanol for 5 min. Cells were then washed three times in PBS, counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in PBS (1:5000 dilution) for 5 min and then washed with PBS. Coverslips were mounted in Vectashield H-1000 (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). GFP was observed using a Nikon E600 epifluorescent microscope (Melville, NY). For β-galactosidase staining, cells were fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde for 5 min; washed three times in PBS; soaked in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 3 mm K4(Fe(CN)6), 3 mm K3(Fe(CN)6), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 1 mm X-gal at 37 °C for 30 min; and then washed with PBS. Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells as described previously (12Shimojo M. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Hersh L.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6788-6795Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The probe for EMSA was made by polymerase chain reaction using the human vesicular acetylcholine transporter/choline acetyltransferase NRSE/RE-1 as a template (see Fig. 2 A). DNA fragments were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. For binding, 10 μg of nuclear protein was preincubated on ice, with or without a 100-fold excess of unlabeled competitor DNA, for 10 min in 20 μl of 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 250 mm KCl, and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). Labeled oligonucleotide (100 fmol) was mixed with nuclear protein, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min at 25 °C. For supershift assays, 10 μg of nuclear protein was preincubated on ice with or without a monoclonal antibody to NRSF/REST (12C11-1) for 30 min before adding the labeled probe. The reaction mixture was loaded onto a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel with 0.25× TBE buffer and electrophoresed for 60 min at 120 V. Nuclear extracts (10 μg) were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer. After separation on a reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel, proteins were transferred onto HybondTM-P membrane as described previously (12Shimojo M. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Hersh L.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6788-6795Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The membrane was then incubated with anti-NRSF/REST (12C11-1), anti-FLAG, or anti-Myc monoclonal antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat anti-mouse antiserum, and visualized using the ECL detection kit per the manufacturer's instructions. As illustrated in Fig. 1, NRSF/REST is a transcription factor containing nine zinc finger domains; the first of these is near the N terminus and is followed by a cluster of seven zinc finger domains, with the last zinc finger domain being near the C terminus of the molecule. REST4, which is a truncated version of NRSF/REST containing only zinc finger domains 1–5, binds weakly to the NRSF/REST target sequence NRSE/RE-1 (13Lee J.-H. Shimojo M. Chai Y.-G. Hersh L.B. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 80: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This finding as well as other studies (1Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G. Cell. 1995; 80: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar) suggests that zinc finger domains 2–5 are required for DNA binding, while zinc finger domains 6–8 appear to contribute significantly to the strength of the binding interaction (13Lee J.-H. Shimojo M. Chai Y.-G. Hersh L.B. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 80: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To study further the contributions of zinc finger domains 6–8, NRSF/REST constructs with combinations of point mutations in these zinc finger domains were constructed, Fig. 1. Each zinc finger structure was disrupted by introducing a point mutation where the amino acid Cys was converted to Arg in the zinc finger domain. This mutation has been shown to disrupt the structure of Cys2-His2type zinc finger domains (14Tapia-Ramirez J. Eggen B.J. Peral-Rubio M.J. Toledo-Aral J.J. Mandel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1177-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Each construct was transfected into HEK293 cells, and nuclear extracts were prepared and used for EMSA with a probe containing the human vesicular acetylcholine transporter/choline acetyltransferase NRSE/RE-1 sequence (Fig.2 A). As can be seen in Fig.2 B, the EMSA shows that the binding of NRSF/REST with mutations in zinc finger domains 6, 7, and 8 (Z6,7,8mut) diminished the gel mobility shift to levels undetectable at the sensitivity of these assays. Diminished binding was also seen in double mutants containing point mutations in zinc finger domains 6 plus 7 (Z6,7mut), 7 plus 8 (Z7,8mut), and 6 plus 8 (Z6,8mut). The presence of a point mutation in zinc finger domain 6 alone (Z6mut) or zinc finger domain 8 alone (Z8mut) had little or no effect on DNA binding; however, a point mutation in zinc finger domain 7 alone (Z7mut) greatly diminished DNA binding. As shown in Fig. 2 C, the expression level of each construct was nearly the same as confirmed by Western blot analysis, and if anything the construct with the point mutation in zinc finger domain 7 was expressed at the highest levels. As shown in Fig.2 D, the electrophoretic mobility band was supershifted with an anti-NRSF monoclonal antibody but not by an irrelevant monoclonal antibody, confirming that the electrophoretic mobility band contained NRSF/REST. Taken together, these results suggest that in addition to zinc fingers 2–5, two adjacent zinc fingers (zinc fingers 6 plus 7 or 7 plus 8) are required for maximal DNA binding. Although the above studies demonstrate the importance of zinc finger domains 6–8 in NRSF/REST binding to DNA, previous studies have shown that the neuron-specific isoform REST4, which contains only zinc finger domains 1–5, is targeted to the nucleus (15Lee J.-H. Chai Y-G. Hersh L.B. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2000; 80: 88-98Google Scholar). This was a bit surprising, since it had previously been proposed that a nuclear localization domain of NRSF/REST resides in the C-terminal part of the molecule (1Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G. Cell. 1995; 80: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar, 16Grimes J.A. Nielsen S.J.

Chem. 2000; 31: 9461-9467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (192) Google Scholar), and this signal is clearly absent from REST4. We first tested the effect of deleting the N-terminal region of REST4, which is known to bind the transcriptional repressor mSin3 (16Grimes J.A. Nielsen S.J. Battaglioli E. Miska E.A. Speh J.C. Berry D.L. Atouf F. Holdener B.C. Mandel G. Kouzarides T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 31: 9461-9467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 17Huang Y. Myers S.J. Dingledine R. Nat.

A. 1999; 96: 13691-13696Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and then a larger fragment of the N-terminal region, which contains the first zinc finger domain. Fig.3 A shows a schematic representation of these and other truncated forms of REST4 that were studied, each containing an N-terminal FLAG epitope for ease of identification. These constructs were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells followed by fractionating the cells into nuclear and cytosolic extracts and locating the REST4 mutant by Western blot analysis with an anti-FLAG antibody. Western blots employing an anti-Myc antibody were used as positive controls to detect endogenous Myc protein in the nucleus. As shown in Fig. 3 B, cell fractionation analysis showed that deletion of the mSin3 binding region (ΔN152) or this region plus the first zinc finger domain (ΔN209) did not affect nuclear targeting. On the other hand, constructs containing deletions of zinc finger domains 3–5 (ΔC89), zinc finger domains 2–5 (ΔC151), or zinc finger domains 1–5 (ΔC173) were detected in the cytosol but not in the nucleus. These results suggest that zinc finger domains 2–5 are required for nuclear targeting of REST4 and presumably NRSF/REST. To demonstrate the importance of zinc finger domains 2–5 in nuclear targeting in vivo, GFP was fused to REST4; to REST1 (11Palm K. Belluardo N. Metsis M. Timmusk T. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1280-1296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which is a natural isoform lacking zinc finger domain 5; and to a C-terminally truncated mutant lacking zinc finger domains 3–5 (ΔC89). These constructs were transiently expressed in NIH3T3 cells, and their localization was determined by GFP fluorescence microscopy. As shown in Fig. 4, although REST4 was localized in the nucleus, the deletion of zinc finger domain 5 was sufficient to prevent nuclear localization. We next confirmed whether zinc finger domains 2–5 would localize a larger protein to the nucleus by fusing this region to β-galactosidase. As shown in Fig.5, the attachment of zinc finger domains 2–5 to the N terminus of β-galactosidase (Z2,3,4,5) conferred nuclear localization in NIH3T3 cells as judged by histochemical staining of the cells with X-gal. Neither β-galactosidase alone nor a construct containing zinc finger domains 2–4 (Z2,3,4) fused to β-galactosidase was localized to the nucleus.Figure 5Cellular localization of β-galactosidase-REST4 zinc finger domain chimeras. A, schematic representation of β-galactosidase-REST4 zinc finger domain chimeras. B, histochemical staining of NIH3T3 cells transfected with the β-galactosidase-REST4 zinc finger domain chimeras shown above.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further dissect the importance of zinc finger domains 2–5 for nuclear localization of REST4, a series of constructs were generated that contained a point mutation that disrupted the conformation of the zinc finger domain. Constructs containing one, two, three, or four of these point mutations fused to GFP were prepared and are schematically represented in Fig. 6 A. As shown in Fig. 6 B, a single point mutation in any one zinc finger domain permitted nuclear targeting. However, as noted below, the zinc finger domain 3 mutant, although localized to the nucleus, showed an abnormal staining pattern. Similarly, combinations of double mutants involving zinc finger domains 2 and 4 (Z2,4mut), zinc finger domains 2 and 5 (Z2,5mut), and zinc finger domains 4 and 5 (Z4,5mut) all showed normal nuclear localization, as did the triple mutant involving zinc finger domains 2, 4, and 5 (Z2,4,5mut). However, all constructs containing a mutation in zinc finger domain 3 (Z3mut, Z3,4mut, Z3,5mut, Z2,3,5mut, and Z3,4,5mut), although associated with the nucleus, appeared abnormal. The zinc finger domain 3 single mutant as well as the zinc finger domain 3 plus 4 double mutant and the zinc finger domain 3 plus 5 double mutant showed nuclear staining that was punctate rather than uniform across the nucleus. A more dramatic pattern was seen with a zinc finger domain 3 mutant in combination with a zinc finger domain 2 mutation. Mutant Z2,3mut, Z2,3,4mut, or Z2,3,5mut or the construct containing mutations in all four zinc finger domains (Z2,3,4,5mut) exhibited GFP fluorescence that appeared on the surface of the nucleus rather than inside the nucleus. NRSF/REST is a transcription factor that contains nine Cys2-His2 type zinc finger domains. It has previously been suggested that the zinc finger domains of NRSF/REST contribute to its binding to the DNA sequence known as NRSE/RE-1. REST4, which is a C-terminally truncated neuron-specific isoform of NRSF/REST, contains only the first five of the nine Cys2-His2 type zinc finger domains. Although the physiological function of REST4 remains unclear, the binding affinity of REST4 to NRSE/RE-1 is lowered dramatically to ∼ 110 to 120 of NRSF/REST (13Lee J.-H. Shimojo M. Chai Y.-G. Hersh L.B. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 80: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These data suggest that other zinc finger domains, notably zinc finger domains 6–8, contribute to DNA binding (13Lee J.-H. Shimojo M. Chai Y.-G. Hersh L.B. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 80: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To study the contributions of these zinc finger domains to DNA binding, a point mutation was introduced into each in which the amino acid Cys was changed to Arg. It has previously been established that this mutation disrupts the conformation and function of Cys2-His2 type zinc finger domains (14Tapia-Ramirez J. Eggen B.J. Peral-Rubio M.J. Toledo-Aral J.J. Mandel G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1177-1182Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). As expected introducing this mutation into zinc finger domains 6–8 together (Z6,7,8mut) decreased DNA binding to an undetectable level. Binding of the mutant could only be detected by adding higher concentrations of the nuclear extract. Similarly, combinations of mutations in any two of the three zinc finger domains (Z6,7mut, Z7,8mut, or Z6,8mut) greatly diminished binding to the NRSE/RE-1 probe. Single mutations in zinc finger domains 6 or 8 had little or no effect on DNA binding; however, mutation of zinc finger domain 7 alone greatly reduced DNA binding. These data suggest that all three zinc finger domains can contribute to DNA binding; however, two adjacent zinc fingers, either zinc finger 6 plus 7 or zinc finger 7 plus 8, are required to produce maximal DNA binding. Although zinc finger domains 6–8 contribute to DNA binding, REST4, which lacks these domains as well as zinc finger domain 9, appears to be efficiently targeted to the nucleus (Figs. 3 and 4). REST4 also lacks the putative nuclear localization signal found in the C-terminal region of NRSF/REST (1Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo-Aral J.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G. Cell. 1995; 80: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (915) Google Scholar, 16Grimes J.A. Nielsen S.J. Battaglioli E. Miska E.A. Speh J.C. Berry D.L. Atouf F. Holdener B.C. Mandel G. Kouzarides T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 31: 9461-9467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Therefore, either there are two nuclear localization signals in NRSF/REST, or the nuclear localization signal found in REST4 is the functional one. Deletion mutagenesis previously indicated that the nuclear targeting signal of REST4 resides within the C-terminal region containing zinc finger domains 2–5 (15Lee J.-H. Chai Y-G. Hersh L.B. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2000; 80: 88-98Google Scholar), and this was confirmed in this study by both cell fractionation and in vivo fluorescence measurements using GFP-REST4 constructs. We further demonstrated that zinc finger domains 2–5, but not 2–4, could target β-galactosidase to the nucleus. In addition, REST1, which is similar to REST4, but lacks zinc finger domain 5, was not targeted to the nucleus. Although these results would suggest that zinc finger 5 is required for nuclear localization, a point mutation in zinc finger 5 did not prevent nuclear localization. We can conclude that there is a nuclear targeting signal, other than the zinc finger domain, located within amino acids 296–328, which comprise the region preceding and through zinc finger 5. There are several basic residues in this region that could participate in a nuclear targeting signal. Alternatively, deletion of amino acids 296–328 changes the structure of the protein such that a critical conformation needed for nuclear targeting is disrupted. To determine whether the zinc finger domain structures are important for nuclear targeting, REST4 with combinations of Cys to Arg point mutations in the zinc finger domains was constructed and fused C-terminally to GFP. None of the combinations of point mutations in zinc finger domains 2–5 changed the localization of REST4 from nuclear to cytoplasmic; thus, a functional structure of the zinc finger domains is not required to target REST4 to the nucleus. On the other hand, disruption of zinc finger domain 3 alone or in combination with other zinc finger domain mutations produced abnormal nuclear localization. A punctate staining of the nucleus was seen with the zinc finger domain 3 single mutant as well as with the zinc finger domain 3 and 4 and zinc finger domain 3 and 5 double mutants. These GFP-REST4 constructs appeared to enter the nucleus but were not dispersed uniformly throughout the nucleus. A different pattern was observed with the zinc finger domain 3 mutant in combination with a zinc finger domain 2 mutation. In these cases, the GFP-REST4 constructs appeared to localize to the edge of the nucleus, as if they were attached to the nuclear envelope. It has been suggested that zinc finger domains not only function in DNA recognition (19Wolfe S.A. Nekludova L. Pabo C.O. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2000; 3: 183-212Crossref Scopus (771) Google Scholar), but also can be involved in protein-protein interactions (20Lee J.S. Galvin K.M. Shi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6145-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 21Milne C.A. Segall J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11364-11371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in determining subcellular localization (22Bruening W. Moffett P. Chia S. Heinrich G. Pelletier J. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar,23Matheny C. Day M.L. Milbrandt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8176-8181Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Nuclear protein import including that of transcription factors such as NRSF/REST or REST4 is a key control point in regulating gene expression. Nuclear localization signal-mediated transport into the nucleus probably involves at least two processes: targeting to the nucleus and translocation with the nuclear pore complexes. The first step is suggested to be an energy-independent recognition of the targeting signal of the transport substrate and subsequent docking at the nuclear pore complexes. The second step is energy-dependent and involves translocation through the pore and into the nucleus (24Newmeyer D.D. Forbes D.J. Cell. 1988; 52: 641-653Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 25Richardson W.D. Mills A.D. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C.

Taken together, our results suggest the presence of three signals in REST4 that contribute to its nuclear localization. One signal, which does not require a functional zinc finger domain, is necessary to target REST4 to the nucleus. This signal lies within amino acids 296–328, since REST1 and the REST4 zinc finger 5 deletion mutant, both of which lack these amino acids, are not targeted to the nucleus. A second signal appears to be required to translocate REST4 across the nuclear membrane, and this signal appears to require both zinc finger domain 2 and zinc finger domain 3. Third, a signal residing in zinc finger domain 3 releases REST4 from the translocation machinery so that it can disperse throughout the nucleus. A less likely but alternative explanation is that the mutation in zinc finger domain 3 introduces a cryptic signal, which causes association of REST4 with nuclear membranes. neuron-restrictive silencer element repressor element-1 neuron-restrictive silencer factor RE-1 silencing transcription factor 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside green fluorescent protein phosphate-buffered saline electrophoretic mobility shift assay(s)"
https://openalex.org/W2320144231,"Cell transformation is associated with anchorage independent growth and morphological changes characterized by reduced adhesion and spreading. The molecular signals that control these events are poorly understood. The Met receptor tyrosine kinase is deregulated in human tumors and an oncogenic derivative of this receptor transforms cells. In this paper we demonstrate that fibroblasts transformed by the Met oncoprotein display decreased cell spreading consistent with the loss of actin stress fibers and vinculin staining focal adhesions. In contrast to control cells, focal adhesion kinase, p130Cas and paxillin are weakly or not detectably tyrosine phosphorylated in Met transformed cells. Moreover, although paxillin and p130Cas associate with the Crk adapter protein in control cells, they fail to associate with Crk in Met transformed cells, yet these cells are motile and capable of wound closure to the same extent as control cells. In Met transformed cells, Crk predominantly associates with the Cbl and Gab1docking proteins in a tyrosine phosphorylation dependent manner. The coupling of Gab1, but not Cbl, with Crk is retained in cells grown in suspension and enhances JNK activation. We propose that the loss of adhesion dependent signals required for cell cycle progression is compensated through Met induced Gab1/Crk signals."

We performed a comprehensive x-ray crystal structure-guided mutation analysis of the TR ligand binding domain (TR LBD) surface to map the functional interface for TR homodimers and heterodimers with RXR in the absence and/or in the presence of DNA. We also identified the molecular contacts in TR LBDs crystallized as dimers. The results show that crystal dimer contacts differ from those found in the functional studies. We found that identical TR LBD residues found in helices 10 and 11 are involved in TR homodimerization and heterodimerization with RXR. Moreover, the same TR LBD surface is operative for dimerization with direct repeats spaced by 4 base pairs (DR-4) and with the inverted palindrome spaced by 6 base pairs (F2), but not with TREpal (unspaced palindrome), where homodimers appear to be simply two monomers binding independently to DNA. We also demonstrate that interactions between the TR and RXR DNA binding domains stabilize TR-RXR heterodimers on DR-4. The dimer interface can be functional in the cell, because disruption of key residues impairs transcriptional activity of TRs mediated through association with RXR LBD linked to GAL4 DNA-binding domain.

Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ribeiro R.C.J. Kushner P.J. Baxter J.D. Annu. Rev. Med. 1995; 46: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 3Perlmann T. Evans R.M.

These receptors are modular transcription factors that bind to specific sequences in promoters of target genes. They bind DNA as monomers, homodimers, or heterodimers through the DNA binding domain (DBD) (1Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar, 5Ribeiro R.C.J. Apriletti J.W. Wagner R.L. West B.L. Feng W. Huber R. Kushner P.J. Nilsson S. Scanlan T.S. Fletterick R.J. Schaufele F. Baxter J.D. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1998; 53: 351-394PubMed Google Scholar). Steroid receptors bind as homodimers to two half-sites of a DNA palindrome. In contrast, TRs, retinoic acid receptors (RARs), vitamin D receptors (VDRs), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), and several orphan receptors bind as heterodimers with retinoid X receptors (RXRs) to direct repeats (DRs) of the AGGTCA half-site (1Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar) but also bind to elements oriented as palindromes or inverted palindromes (1Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar). Binding specificity of these receptors is determined by spacing between the half-sites, because PPARs, VDRs, TRs, and RARs bind preferentially to DRs spaced by 1, 3, 4, or 5 nucleotides, respectively (1Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike PPARs, VDRs, and RARs, TRs also bind DNA as monomers and as homodimers to DRs and to inverted palindromes spaced by 4–6 nucleotides (F2) (1Glass C.K. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar,6Ribeiro R.C. Kushner P.J. Apriletti J.W. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 1142-1152PubMed Google Scholar, 7Ribeiro R.C. Apriletti J.W.

Current concepts of the dimerization and heterodimerization interfaces for nuclear receptors are based on mutational and x-ray crystal structural data. The mutation data for LBDs are mostly limited to TR, RAR, VDR, and RXR. Little is known from mutation studies with the steroid receptors, because only few studies report single mutations in the LBDs that disrupt dimerization (8Fawell S.E. Lees J.A. White R. Parker M.G. Cell. 1990; 60: 953-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). This is due in part to the fact that the DBDs and amino-terminal fragments of these receptors contribute substantially to stabilization of the dimer (9Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar, 10Tetel M.J. Jung S. Carbajo P. Ladtkow T. Skafar D.F. Edwards D.P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1114-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Data for the TR, RXR, RAR, and VDR LBD dimerization have come from point mutations and deletions. These studies have identified an area encompassing about 40 amino acids in helices 10 and 11 (H10 and H11) that appears to mediate formation of RXR, and TR homodimers, and RAR-RXR, TR-RXR, and VDR-RXR heterodimers (11Au-Fliegner M.

However, this interpretation was based on results with mutations of residues placed in the interior core structure of the LBD, such as with the leucines in H10 and H11 in the so-called heptad repeats (16Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. McGrath M.E. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Thus, these and the deletion mutations may disrupt receptor folding, complicate the interpretation of results, and, consequently, not allow for a definition of the actual interface or specific residues involved in forming homodimers or heterodimers. Mutation data have also suggested that the region and residues within the TR LBD that form homodimers are distinct from those that form heterodimers. For example, changing leucines to arginines in H11 of chicken TRα1 (L365R and L372R) or human (h) TRβ1 (L428R) disrupted TR-RXR heterodimers, but not TR homodimers on TREpal (the unspaced palindrome), DR-4 elements (direct repeat elements spaced by 4 base pairs), and inverted palindromes (11Au-Fliegner M. Helmer E. Casanova J. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5725-5737Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 17Nagaya T. Jameson J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15766-15771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, single mutations in arginine 316 to histidine, arginine 338 to tryptophan, and arginine 429 to glutamine in hTRβ1 disrupt homodimers but not heterodimers (18Kitajima K. Nagaya T. Jameson J.L. Thyroid. 1995; 5: 343-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Whereas these data indicate differences in requirements for heterodimerization and homodimerization, the usefulness of these mutations for defining the TR homodimerization or heterodimerization surfaces is limited, because these mutations are in the interior core structure of the TR. Several investigators demonstrated that TR-RXR heterodimers interact in solution through a LBD heterodimer interface. It has been proposed that these heterodimers bind DR-4 elements by initial formation in solution of the LBD-LBD interface, which leads, upon DNA binding, to the formation of a second interface involving the second zinc finger of the RXR DBD and the first zinc finger of the TR DBD (19Perlmann T. Rangarajan P.N. Umesono K. Evans R.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1411-1422Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 20Mader S. Chen J.Y. Chen Z. White J. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H.

Indeed, crystallographic studies of isolated TR-RXR DBDs bound to DR-4 supported the existence of a DBD heterodimer interface in which the RXR occupies the 5′ half-site, whereas TR occupies the 3′ half-site (23Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). However, there is no functional evidence that DBD surfaces participate in complexes formed by full-length TR homodimers or TR-RXR heterodimers bound to DR-4 or other elements. Also, if DBD surfaces participate in dimerization, it is unclear if the LBD and DBD surfaces form sequentially, nor is it known whether a LBD surface is used by TR homodimers to bind any DNA element. To date, no x-ray crystal structural data are available for TR LBD homodimers or heterodimers bound to DNA, and no comprehensive mutation analyses are available that locate the homodimer or heterodimer TR LBD interface.

The residues in H10 and proximal region of H11 form more than 75% of the total LBD dimer surface found in homodimers or heterodimers, whereas PR homodimers contacts are in the distal part of H11 and H12. The PR dimerization domain also covered a much smaller area (700 Å2) than that for the ERα (1703 Å2), which led the authors to question the physiological relevance of the observed dimer (31Tanenbaum D.M. Wang Y. Williams S.P. Sigler P.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5998-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar). In addition, the structures of the RXRα LBD bound to 9-cis retinoic acid (32Egea P.F. Mitschler A. Rochel N. Ruff M. Chambon P. Moras D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2592-2601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and of the PPARδ LBD bound to fatty acids (33Xu H.E. Lambert M.H. Montana V.G. Parks D.J. Blanchard S.G. Brown P.J. Sternbach D.D.

However, the packing contacts found between these monomers did not resemble those present in the unliganded RXRα LBD or in the PPARγ LBD homodimers suggesting that a different dimeric conformation may be found with these receptors. Altogether, these structural data indicate that in the absence of DNA, nuclear receptors form dimers by engaging H11 and possibly other helices in diverse macromolecular interactions that may give rise to varied dimeric conformations. The TR LBD structure reported to date is formed by TR monomers. Thus it is not apparent which TR residues participate in homodimer or heterodimer interactions and whether they vary depending on the nature of the TRE. Furthermore, structural data do not demonstrate functional TR interactions. In the studies reported here we performed a comprehensive x-ray crystal structure-guided mutation analysis of the TR LBD surface to map the functional interface for TR homodimers and heterodimers with RXR in the absence and/or in the presence of DNA. This approach employed the x-ray crystal structures of the TR-RXR DBDs and TR LBD (16Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. McGrath M.E. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar, 23Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) and was previously used by us for definition of a TR coactivator-binding surface (34Feng W. Ribeiro R.C. Wagner R.L. Nguyen H. Apriletti J.W. Fletterick R.J. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. West B.L. Science. 1998; 280: 1747-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). We also identified the molecular contacts in TR LBDs crystallized as dimers. The results show that crystal dimer contacts differ from those found in the functional studies. We found that identical TR LBD residues are involved in TR homodimerization and heterodimerization with RXR. Further, the same LBD surface is operative irrespective of the orientation and spacing of the half-sites for DR and inverted palindromic elements, but not for the TREpal homodimers, which appear to be simply two monomers binding to DNA. We also demonstrate that interactions between the DBDs stabilize TR-RXR heterodimers on DR-4. The dimer interface can be functional in the cell, because disruption of key residues impairs transcriptional activity of TRs mediated through association with RXR LBD linked to GAL4 DNA-binding domain. TR mutants were created by ligating double-stranded oligonucleotides encoding the mutant sequence into the pCMX vector that encodes the full-length 461 amino acid hTRβ1 sequence. Some mutations were created using QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kits (Stratagene). The mutated sequences were verified by DNA sequencing using Sequenase Kits (Stratagene). These TR mutants changed the amino acids in the hTRβ1 surface that were selected for scanning mutagenesis using the x-ray structure of the TRα LBD as a guide to localize the surface residues on hTRβ1 (16Wagner R.L.

Shiau A.K. Kelly A.E. Scanlan T.S. Apriletti J.W. Baxter J.D. West B.L. Fletterick R.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2001; 15: 398-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar) revealed that the mutations were placed correctly. Most mutations changed the resident amino acid to arginine, reasoning that bulky and charged residues on the surface were more likely to disrupt TR association with other proteins over a wider range without reducing TR solubility. Each mutant maintained the overall integrity of TR as judged by the ability to bind [125I]T3 with Kdvalues between 4 and 174% of that for the native receptor and/or to bind the glucocorticoid receptor interacting protein 1 (GRIP-1) fused to GST as effectively as the wild-type TR. We initially tested, as reported previously, widely separated locations to probe the entire LBD surface for dimerization (34Feng W. Ribeiro R.C. Wagner R.L. Nguyen H. Apriletti J.W. Fletterick R.J. Baxter J.D. Kushner P.J. West B.L. Science. 1998; 280: 1747-1749Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Subsequently, a series of mutations were performed along H10 and H11 in a region where residues were identified that disrupted dimerization to define better the structural requirements for dimerization. Mutations are represented by the single-letter amino acid abbreviation of the native residue followed by its position number in the sequence and the mutated residue abbreviation. The affinity of the wild-type TRβ1 is 60 ± 7 pm. The relative affinity was determined by dividing the wild type by the mutant Kd. The 62 mutants included and their relative affinities are: E217R (91%), W219K (not done (ND)), E227R (109%), K242E (68%), F245K (ND), D249R (ND), V256R (ND), L266K (ND), E267R (87%), H271R (91%), T277R (7%), T281R (94%), V284R (105%), D285A (68%), K288A (61%), M292K (ND), C294K (94%), E295R (150%), C298A (65%), C298R (44%), E299A (139%), I302A (91%), I302R (99%), L305I (ND), K306A (5%), K306E (7%), C309A (ND), V319K (ND), E324R (ND), M334K (ND), V348R (ND), D351A (ND), D355A (ND), M358A (ND), D382R (86%), P384R (121%), A387R (80%), V389A (59%), E390R (140%), E393R (109%), L400R (70%), H413R (81%), V414K (ND), H416R (113%), P419R (152%), L422R (69%), M423R (174%), T426R (48%), R429A (55%), M430R (107%), A433R (ND), C434R (124%), S437R (65%), L440R (129%), V444R (66%), T448R (282%), E449R (26%), P453E (32%), L454R (12%), L456R (13%), E457K (38%), V458M (ND). A TR DBD mutant was created by changing the Asp177, known to interact with RXR in crystallographic studies, to Ala. A RXR DBD mutant was made by changing all Arg residues previously shown in crystallographic studies to be involved in dimerization with the TR to Ala (R172A, R182A, and R186A, Ref. 23Rastinejad F. Perlmann T. Evans R.M. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1995; 375: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). We also found that this RXR mutant had three additional DBD changes (T168P, T170I, and Y193A) that did not interfere with RXR binding to DNA. An RXR LBD mutant was made by changing leucines 419 and 420 into arginines, positions analogous to TR mutants defective in dimerization (see “Results”). Crystallization conditions for hTRβ LBD with Triac has been described fully (35Wagner R.L. Huber B.R. Shiau A.K. Kelly A.E. Scanlan T.S. Apriletti J.W. Baxter J.D. West B.L. Fletterick R.J. Mol.

Briefly, crystals are obtained by hanging drop vapor diffusion (12 h, 25 °C) from a drop (1 μl of TRβ LBD solution at 9 mg/ml, 1 μl precipitant solution) suspended above a reservoir composed of 1.0 m sodium acetate [NaH3OAc] and 0.1 m sodium cacodylate [NaCac], pH 7.2. Crystals were of space group P3121 (a = 68.9 Å, c = 131.5 Å) and contained 1 molecule of TRβ LBD. The N-terminal His tag was not removed prior to crystallization. Hexagonal crystals of rTRα LBD with T3were obtained using hanging drop vapor diffusion at 17 °C from a drop containing a 1:1 mixture of ∼10 mg/ml protein, 3 mmdithiothreitol with well solution containing 0.45 m(NH4)H2PO4 and 0.2 m(NH4)2SO4 buffered with 0.1m KH2PO4, pH 7.0. The space group was determined to be hexagonal, P61(5)22 from oscillation data; the correct enantiomorph P6522 was identified through molecular replacement using the model of the rTRα LBD (16Wagner R.L.

The unit cell dimensions of these crystals are a = b = 108.64 Å, c = 133.72 Å. Structural analysis of hTRβ LBD with Triac has been recently described fully (35Wagner R.L. Huber B.R. Shiau A.K.

Briefly, crystals were transferred into a cryoprotectant composed of 30% glycerol, 1.4 mNaAc, and 100 mm NaCac, pH 7.2, then suspended in a nylon loop attached to a mounting pin, and flash frozen (liquid nitrogen). Diffraction data were measured to 2.4 Å using synchrotron radiation at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory beamline 7–1 (λl = 1.08Å) and processed using HKL. A molecular replacement solution was found using AMORE from the model of the rTRα LBD, with ligand omitted (36Collaborative Computational Project, No. 4 Acta Crystallogr. 1994; D50: 760-763Google Scholar). Refinement with CNS produced a model with anRcryst of 24% and anRfree of 26%. A cryoprotectant composed of 30% glycerol, 0.5m (NH4)H2PO4, 0.2m (NH4)2SO4, and 0.1m KH2PO4, pH 7.0 was used, and a complete data set measured at SSRL (λl = 1.08Å) and processed using HKL. A molecular replacement solution for the Form II crystal was found using AMORE from the rTRα LBD model with ligand removed (16Wagner R.L. Apriletti J.W. McGrath M.E. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Fletterick R.J. Nature. 1995; 378: 690-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The resulting electron density maps show interpretable density for the T3 ligand; furthermore, an anomalous Fourier map calculated from the molecular replacement phases identifies the sites for the iodine scatterers consistent with the ligand density. Refinement with CNS produced a model with an Rcryst of 25% and an Rfree of 28%. For these experiments full-length hRXRα was prepared inEscherichia coli strain HB101 as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase (GST) as per the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The binding experiments were performed by mixing glutathione-linked-Sepharose beads containing 10 μg of GST·hRXRα fusion proteins (Coomassie Plus protein assay reagent, Pierce) with 1–2 μl of the 35S-labeled wild-type or mutant hTRβ1 (30 fmols) in 150 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, 150 mm KCl, 25 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors) containing 2 μg/ml bovine serum albumin for 1.5 h. Beads were washed three times with 1 ml of binding buffer, and the bound proteins were separated using 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Binding of full-length hTRβ1 mutants to DNA was assayed by gel shift assays by mixing 30 fmols of radiolabeled TRs ([35S]Met, DuPont) produced in a reticulocyte lysate system, TNT® T7 Quick (Promega), with ∼600 fmols (10 ng) of nonradiolabeled DR-4 or F2 oligonucleotides or 120 fmols (2 ng) of the TREpal oligonucleotide and 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in a 20-μl volume reaction as previously described (7Ribeiro R.C. Apriletti J.W. Yen P.M. Chin W.W. Baxter J.D. Endocrinology. 1994; 135: 2076-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The binding buffer contained 10 mm NaPO4, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 20 mm NaCl, 5% glycerol, 0.1% monothioglycerol. After 20 min at room temperature, the mixture was loaded onto a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel that was previously run for 30 min at 200 V. To separate the TR·DNA complexes, the gel was run at 4 °C for 150–240 min at 240 V, using a running buffer containing 6.7 mm Tris-base (pH 7.5 for a 10× stock at room temperature), 1 mm EDTA, and 3.3 mm sodium acetate. CV1 cells were maintained and subcultured in media DME H-21 4.5 g/l glucose, containing 10% newborn bovine serum, 2 mmglutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfection procedures were described previously (37Leitman D.C. Costa C.H. Graf H. Baxter J.D. Ribeiro R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21950-21955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected and resuspended in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline (0.5 ml/1.5 × 107 cells) containing 0.1% dextrose, and typically 10 μg of reporter plasmid and 1 μg of expression vector. Cells were electroporated at 350 V and 960 microfarads, transferred to fresh media, and then plated in 6-well plates. After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C with ethanol, or 100 nm T3, the cells were collected and the pellets were solubilized by addition of 100 μl of 0.25 mTris-HCl, pH 7.6 containing 0.1% Triton X-100. For each transfection, 1 μg of the pCMVhTRβ1 expression vector was cotransfected with the 2 μg of the GAL·RXR (GAL4 DBD fused to hRXRα LBD) expression vector. The reporter gene contained five GAL binding sites upstream of the adenovirus E1b minimal promoter linked to luciferase coding sequences (LUC). The LUC activity was analyzed after the cells were incubated 18–24 h with the hormone (Luciferase Assay System,Promega). These models were derived using the known structures of the TR (27Nolte R.T.

To create the model of the TR-RXR heterodimer, the rTR LBD was superimposed on hRAR using the Cα atoms of the hydrophobic core helices H3-H5-H6 (rTR residues Ile226–Arg266; hRAR residues Ile236–Arg276), and H9 (rTR residues Asp313–Leu322; hRAR residues Asp323–Met332), using LSQMAN (r.m.s. deviation of 0.55 Å for 51 Cα; r.m.s. deviation of 1.42 Å for 203 Cα after optimization). Hydrophobic and hydrophilic surface buried in the crystallographic contacts was calculated using ASC, with a 1.4 Å probe (38Eisenhaber F. Argos P. J. Comp. Chem. 1993; 14: 1272-1280Crossref Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 39Eisenhaber F. Lijnzaad P. Argos P. Sander C. Scharf M. J. Comp. Chem. 1995; 16: 273-284Crossref Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bonds were identified using HBPlus (40Mitchell J.B. Nandi C.L. McDonald I.K. Thornton J.M. Price S.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 315-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Crystal forms of LBD fragments of the TRα and TRβ subtypes exhibit two distinct symmetrical intermolecular contacts. In TRα, the individual monomers are rotated 180° with respect to each other, with an axis of symmetry parallel to H11, such that the helices cross with the junction near the mid-point of H11 (Fig.1 A). The contact buries a modest 550 Å2 of surface area per monomer. The primary contacts are between residues in H11, with contributions from the C-terminal portion of H8. A cluster of hydrophobic residues in H11 marks the center of symmetry: Met376, Ile377, Ala378, and Cys379. At the periphery of the contact are electrostatic interactions between residues in H8 and H11: Lys288 with Asp326 and Glu301 with Asp373. In TRβ, the individual monomers are again rotated 180° with respect to each other, but the axis of symmetry is perpendicular to H11, producing an antiparallel LBD dimer (Fig. 1 B, Ref. 35Wagner R.L.

https://openalex.org/W2142830339,"Nuclear phosphoprotein HMGA1a, high mobility group A1a, (previously HMGI) has been investigated during apoptosis. A change in the degree of phosphorylation of HMGA1a has been observed during apoptosis induced in four leukemic cell lines (HL60, K562, NB4, and U937) by drugs (etoposide, camptothecin) or herpes simplex virus type-1. Both hyper-phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation of HMGA1a have been ascertained by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Hyper-phosphorylation (at least five phosphate groups/HMGA1a molecule) occurs at the early apoptotic stages and is probably related to HMGA1a displacement from DNA and chromatin release from the nuclear scaffold. De-phosphorylation (one phosphate or no phosphate groups/HMGA1a molecule) accompanies the later formation of highly condensed chromatin in the apoptotic bodies. We report for the first time a direct link between the degree of phosphorylation of HMGA1a protein and apoptosis according to a process that involves the entire amount of HMGA1a present in the cells and, consequently, whole chromatin. At the same time we report that variously phosphorylated forms of HMGA1a protein are also mono-methylated.

Among nonhistone nuclear proteins of mammalian cells, a family of three proteins called HMGA1a, HMGA1b, and HMGA2 (previously termed HMGI, HMGY, and HMGI-C, respectively) 1The nomenclature of the high mobility group (HMG) proteins has been recently revised (see the Chromosomal Proteins Nomenclature on the Web).

HMGA1a and HMGA1b are very similar, differing by only 11 amino acid residues, because they are the splicing products of the same gene (5Johnson K.R. Lehn D.A. Elton T.S. Barr P.J. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18338-18342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas HMGA2 is the product of another gene (6Manfioletti G. Giancotti V. Bandiera A. Buratti E. Sautière P. Cary P. Crane-Robinson C. Goodwin G.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 6793-6797Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). These proteins are composed of about a hundred residues, and all contain three characteristic short basic regions, called AT-hooks, that interact with AT-rich stretches of DNA in the minor groove (7Huth J.R.

A property that is characteristic not only of the three proteins under discussion, but also of other HMG proteins, is a C-terminal domain having a very high content of acidic residues (1Bustin M.

In HMGA1a, HMGA1b, and HMGA2 the acidic C-terminal domain is constitutively phosphorylated in vivo by CK2 (10Palvimo J. Linnala-Kankkunen A.

Given the importance of HMGA1a, HMGA1b, and HMGA2 proteins in chromatin dynamics, we addressed the question of chromatin assembly/disassembly by studying their post-translational modifications during apoptosis, a process where profound changes in chromatin structure occur. Apoptosis has been induced in four leukemic cell lines (HL60, K562, NB4, and U937), and the study has been focused on the HMGA1a protein, that is the prevalently spliced form in this type of cells. For the first time we demonstrate that the HMGA1a protein is subject to both hyper-phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation during apoptosis, the two events being time-dependent. We show that a new and fully de-phosphorylated form of HMGA1a is the main form present in the highly condensed chromatin of apoptotic bodies, whereas hyper-phosphorylation is characteristic of early stages of apoptosis and is related to the onset of DNA fragmentation and nuclear envelope degradation. We also report for the first time that HMGA1a is mono-methylated during apoptosis and that this modification is independent of the degree of phosphorylation. The four cell lines HL60, K562, NB4, and U937 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. Induction of apoptosis was carried out by three different procedures. All cell lines were treated with etoposide (VP-16, Calbiochem), 68 μm, for different times to have a considerable amount of apoptotic cells: 4.5 h (HL60, NB4), 24 h (U937), and 48 h (K562). HL60 cells were also treated with 0.1 μg/ml camptothecin (Calbiochem) for 4.5 h following synchronization with 1 μg/ml aphidicolin (Calbiochem) for 15 h (24Del Bino G. Lassota P. Darzynkiewicz Z. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 193: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). U937 cells were also induced to apoptosis by herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) (25Mastino A. Sciortino M.T. Medici M.A. Perri D. Ammendolia M.G. Grelli S. Amici C. Pernice A. Guglielmino S. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The percentage of apoptotic cells was evaluated by double fluorescence emission of cells treated with both propidium iodide (PharMingen) and annexin-V fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated (PharMingen) with a FACScan from Becton Dickinson (Franklin Lakes, NJ). The time course experiment on HL60 cells was carried out with a procedure similar to that of Morana et al. (26Morana S.J. Wolf C.M. Li J. Reynolds J.E. Brown M.K. Eastman A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18263-18271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Apoptosis inhibition was carried out by treating HL60 cells with 10 or 25 μm Z-VAD-fmk (Calbiochem) in culture medium for 1 h, after which etoposide 136 μm was added and cells were left to incubate for 30 min. Following etoposide incubation, cells were washed and left in culture medium containing Z-VAD-fmk for another 2 h. Protein Extraction, Electrophoretic Analysis, and Western Blotting—Total HMG proteins and histone H1 were selectively extracted by treating cells with 5% perchloric acid (PCA) (w/v) as previously reported (17Giancotti V. Pani B. D'Andrea P. Berlingieri M.T. Di Fiore P.P. Fusco A. Vecchio G. Philp R. Crane-Robinson C. Nicolas R.H. Wright C.A. Goodwin G.H.

Electrophoretic analysis was carried out on 15% polyacrylamide gels in acetic acid/urea or in SDS/Tris/Tricine buffer as described previously (12Giancotti V. Bandiera A. Buratti E. Fusco A. Marzari R. Coles B. Goodwin G.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 198: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis, a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against an N-terminal peptide of HMGA1a protein was used (23Bandiera A. Bonifacio D. Manfioletti G. Mantovani F. Rustighi A. Zanconati F. Fusco A. Di Bonito L. Giancotti V. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 426-431PubMed Google Scholar). DNA Fragmentation Assay—DNA from control or apoptotic cells was extracted essentially according to Zhu and Wang (27Zhu N. Wang Z. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 246: 155-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). DNA fragments were analyzed on 2% agarose gel in Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer and visualized with ethidium bromide under UV light. HPLC and LC-MS Measurements—Reverse-phase HPLC chromatography of PCA extracts was carried out with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences apparatus (series 200 LC pump and 785A UV-visible detector) using a Vydac Protein C4 column (2.1 × 150 mm). Protein was eluted by a water/acetonitrile gradient, and the chromatogram was obtained by absorbance detection at 220 nm. At the same time, an aliquot of the eluted solution was directly injected into an interfaced mass spectrometer (PE SCIEX, API 1), which gave an equivalent chromatogram by counting total ions (TIC) that reach the mass detector (28Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar). Search for ion composition was carried out on each TIC peak, and a succession of m/z + values was obtained for every protein form contained in that peak. The identification of all successions ofm/z + allowed to obtain reconstructed mass spectra (±1 Da) that gave the molecular composition of the analyzed peak. The same procedure was employed for the analysis of tryptic fragments, the only difference being that a Waters Delta-Pak C18 column (2 × 150 mm) was used. LC-MS then was used to identify both different forms of the whole protein molecule and different forms of tryptic fragments. Trypsin Treatment—HPLC-purified HMGA1a (15 μg) from both K562 control and apoptotic cells was treated for 15 h at 37 °C in 50 μl of Tris/HCl, 100 mm, pH 8.5, containing 0.75 μg of sequencing grade trypsin (Roche Diagnostics), and the reaction was stopped by freezing. Thawed tryptic samples were directly injected into the HPLC apparatus interfaced with the mass spectrometer, at room temperature. Protein extracts from four leukemic cell lines (K562, HL60, NB4, and U937) have been analyzed by acetic acid/urea electrophoresis, which showed, in the extract from apoptotic cells, a double band at the migration position of the HMGA1a protein, in comparison with the single band obtained from control cells (Fig. 1 A). To verify if the retarded band could be due to any new apoptotic form(s) of HMGA1a, the regions comprising HMGN2 and HMGA1a of the acid/urea first dimension (Fig. 1 A) were analyzed by SDS two-dimensional analysis. The pattern obtained was blotted for Western identification using a polyclonal antibody raised against an N-terminal peptide common to both HMGA1a and HMGA1b (5Johnson K.R. Lehn D.A. Elton T.S. Barr P.J. Reeves R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 18338-18342Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Bandiera A. Bonifacio D. Manfioletti G. Mantovani F. Rustighi A. Zanconati F. Fusco A. Di Bonito L. Giancotti V. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 426-431PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 B). From the result reported in Fig. 1 B, it is evident that the antibody identified both normal HMGA1a and HMGA1b proteins as well as the retarded band, which can consequently be considered as one or more new forms of HMGA1a appearing during apoptosis. To understand the nature of the HMGA1a form(s) generated during apoptosis, the same extracts of Fig. 1 have been separated by HPLC, and the eluted protein was detected by both UV absorption (Fig. 2,A and B) and LC-MS total ion count (Fig. 2,C and D). LC-MS molecular masses of HMGA1 components have been determined (Fig. 2, E andF): control K562 cells contain two forms of HMGA1a protein having masses of 11,745.9 and 11,826.0 Da, respectively. The predicted mass of human HMGA1a protein without modifications (i.e. 106 amino acid residues, no initial methionine) is 11,544.8 Da, which becomes 11,586.8 Da if N-terminal acetylation at the first serine is assumed, as found in preceding studies. It is possible to infer this also from both the mass spectrometric data recently reported by Reeves and coworkers (11Ferranti P. Malorni A. Marino G. Pucci P. Goodwin G.H. Manfioletti G. Giancotti V. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22486-22489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Giancotti V. Bandiera A. Ciani L. Santoro D. Crane-Robinson C. Goodwin G.H. Boiocchi M. Dolcetti R. Casetta B.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8333-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and by tryptic digestion experiments as reported below. Because one phosphate group increases the mass of a protein by 80 Da, the two forms of HMGA1a protein found in control K562 can be considered as the di-phosphorylated (found, 11,745.9 Da; calculated, 11,746.8 Da) and the tri-phosphorylated (found, 11,826.0 Da; calculated, 11,826.8 Da) modifications. This result is in agreement with preceding data that reported in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation of the three last serines at the C-terminal of both HMGA1a and HMGA1b proteins (i.e. serines 98, 101, and 102) as consensus sites for CK2 (10Palvimo J.

The extract from K562 apoptotic cells contains, in addition to the di-phosphorylated and tri-phosphorylated forms present in the control cells, other forms whose molecular masses are consistent with hyper-phosphorylated forms (four phosphate groups, 11,905.4 Da and five phosphate groups, 11,986.0 Da) and with de-phosphorylated forms (one phosphate group, 11,665.4 Da and zero phosphate group, 11,585.5 Da). Assuming that LC-MS peak intensity is approximately proportional to the amount of protein, it is possible to estimate that the sample from K562 control cells of Fig.2 E contains about 50% of di-phosphorylated HMGA1a protein and about 50% of tri-phosphorylated, whereas in the apoptotic sample (Fig. 2 F) the main form is tri-phosphorylated, all other forms being present at lower percentage. LC-MS data shown in Fig. 3 Aindicate that in all four analyzed cell lines the main forms of HMGA1a are those that are di-phosphorylated and tri-phosphorylated. The same data from apoptotic cells (Fig. 3 B) show both hyper-phosphorylated and de-phosphorylated forms. However, inspection of the data indicates that the degree of phosphorylation is not only cell type-dependent but also related to the percentage of apoptotic cells present in the analyzed cell sample. In fact, di-phosphorylated and tri-phosphorylated forms of HMGA1a are the main molecules in both HL60 and NB4 cells, which contain 36% of apoptotic cells, whereas in K562, having 77% of apoptotic cells, the tri-phosphorylated molecule is the main form accompanied by a considerable amount of de-phosphorylated forms, and in U937, containing 97% of apoptotic cells, the main form of HMGA1a is without phosphate. Thus the data of Fig. 3 allow us to conclude that, in the control cell lines studied, HMGA1a is mainly present as the di- and tri-phosphorylated forms. During apoptosis induced by etoposide, two different processes take place, one hyper-phosphorylates the di- and tri-phosphorylated forms, the other de-phosphorylates all phosphorylated molecules. Very similar results were obtained for camptothecin-induced HL60 cells (data not shown). Fig. 3 also shows that, on the right side of most of the variously phosphorylated peaks, there is a shoulder that in U937 apoptotic cells resolves into a definite peak having a constant increase of about 14 Da. It seems likely that this increase is due to methylation concomitant with the phosphorylation/de-phosphorylation processes. Methylation of HMGA1b protein (the other spliced protein) has also been reported by Reeves and coworkers (29Banks G.C. Li Y. Reeves R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 8333-8346Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) in MCF-7 cells in which up to four methyl groups have been identified by tryptic peptide mapping. No methylation has, however, been reported previously for HMGA1a that on the contrary results mono-methylated in the cell lines of this study. To obtain further confirmation that the identified forms of HMGA1a protein are due to phosphorylation, HPLC-purified protein samples from both control and apoptotic K562 cells were alkaline phosphatase-treated. This removed phosphate groups from all phosphorylated forms of HMGA1a and gave only the unphosphorylated, N-terminally acetylated molecule, having molecular masses of 11,586.2 Da (control) and 11,585.9 Da (apoptotic) (data not shown). Tryptic fragments of HPLC-purified HMGA1a from both control and apoptotic K562 cells were analyzed by LC-MS spectrometry. 26 different peptides, spanning the entire HMGA1a sequence, have been identified and are reported in Fig. 4 A. For each of the identified peptides, a search for the phosphorylated forms was carried out in both control and apoptotic samples, and the following conclusions were reached: (i) in both control and apoptotic cells N-terminal fragments were acetylated; (ii) in control K562 cells the main phosphorylated fragment was the 88- to 106-animo acid peptide present as the di- or tri-phosphorylated forms; (iii) in apoptotic K562 cells the 88- to 106-amino acid peptide was mainly unphosphorylated; one phosphate group has been detected in fragments 1–23, 73–83, and 74–83; mono- and di-phosphorylated forms have been identified for the fragments 26–54, 30–54, and 30–57. This means that the additional phosphates in the hyper-phosphorylated forms are located inside the protein molecule and that the de-phosphorylation process starts by removing the phosphate groups from the C-terminal side.

Neurochem. 2000; 74: 392-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we have drawn the scheme shown in Fig. 4 B, where all the putative sites for hyper-phosphorylation of the HMGA1a protein are shown together with the constitutive C-terminal modified serines. Data summarized in Fig.4 B indicate that it could be possible to find HMGA1a molecules bearing up to seven phosphate groups at a time. LC-MS data shown in Fig. 3 B clearly indicate up to five phosphate groups; however, very low amounts of HMGA1a having six or seven phosphate groups have been detected (data not shown). In any case, it must be pointed out that phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation processes could partially overlap. From preceding data, results show that the hyper-phosphorylation of HMGA1a and its de-phosphorylation should be related to different events that take place at different times during apoptosis and concern different regions of the molecule. To clarify this point, we have carried out a time course at the beginning of apoptotic induction. To this end, HL60 cells have been induced with 136 μm etoposide for 30 min, then the drug was removed and washed cells were left to proceed toward apoptosis far up to 3 h. Proteins were PCA extracted and LC-MS analyzed at four different times (after 30-min treatment and 1, 2, and 3 h from washing). In Fig.5 A, the result of the time course is reported grouping together de-phosphorylated HMGA1a forms (0P + 1P), di- and tri-phosphorylated forms (2P + 3P), and hyper-phosphorylated forms (4P + 5P). The time course shows that hyper-phosphorylation of HMGA1a starts as soon as etoposide treatment begins, reaching a maximum 1 h after drug removal when the forms having one or no phosphate groups begin to appear. Phosphate groups introduced at an early stage of the apoptotic process are added to the two or three phosphate groups already present at the C-terminal of the molecule and produce the 4P and 5P (or more phosphorylated) modifications. De-phosphorylation starts with the removal of the constitutive phosphate groups,i.e. C-terminal phosphates (serines 98, 101, and 102) probably when phosphorylation inside the HMGA1a molecule is still active. This is the reason why di- and tri-phosphorylated forms can have a constitutive origin (i.e. control cells or cells at very early stages of the process) or an apoptotic origin, deriving from the removal of constitutive phosphate groups from molecules bearing four or five (or more) phosphates (i.e. hyper-phosphorylated forms). Further support for the hypothesis that hyper-phosphorylation of HMGA1a protein should be related to the early events of the apoptotic process derives from the electrophoretic analysis of the DNA reported in Fig. 5 Bwhere the maximum level of HMGA1a phosphorylation observable after 1 h does correspond to high molecular weight digested DNA, whereas the subsequent de-phosphorylation process correlates with the formation of low molecular weight DNA fragments. It is well known that topoisomerase I and II poisons such as etoposide and camptothecin cause apoptosis through cell cycle block and activation of a group of cysteine proteases called caspases (31Froelich-Ammon S.J Osheroff N.

Inhibition of caspase activity slows down or stops the advance of the apoptotic process and could allow one to obtain information on its very early events. Therefore, we used the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk (35Sun X.-M. MacFarlane M. Zhuang J. Wolf B.B. Green D.R. Cohen G.M. J. Biol.

To understand to which nuclear morphologic change phosphorylation of HMGA1a protein could be related during apoptosis, we carried out microscopic observation of aliquots of the same cells stained with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Fig.6 A shows that using 25 μm Z-VAD-fmk (lane 2) DNA fragmentation is almost blocked, and small differences in the chromatin status are observable comparing representative cells from the control to the 25 μm Z-VAD-fmk-treated cells (Fig. 6 B,1 and 2). Moreover, mass data (Fig.6 C, 2) show that hyper-phosphorylated forms (4P and 5P) have been produced. If a lower Z-VAD-fmk concentration is used (10 μm, Fig.6 A, lane 3), an increased digestion of DNA is observable, but it is lower, however, than the substantial nucleosomal cleavage reached after 2 h of etoposide treatment in the absence of Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 6 A, lane 4). Consistently, an increased level of hyper-phosphorylation has been detected in this protein sample: note that the 4P peak in mass spectrum 3 (Fig. 6 C) has the same intensity as the 2P peak. At this stage, in which a clear beginning of DNA fragmentation is seen (Fig. 6 A, lane 3), chromatin starts to condense showing a typical alteration of nuclear organization (Fig. 6 B, 3) but not yet forming well defined apoptotic bodies as those observed after reported 2 h treatment of cells without Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 6 B,4). In this last sample both hyper-phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation are observable (Fig. 6 C, 4), because only about 30% of cells are definitively apoptoti"

Members of this family of channels include receptors for both inhibitory neurotransmitters such as glycine and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)1and excitatory neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and serotonin (1Betz H. Neuron. 1990; 5: 383-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). These membrane protein channels are amphiphilic molecules which, in response to neurotransmitter binding, transiently form pores through the lipid membrane where they are embedded, allowing the passive movement of small ions down their concentration gradient. This flux changes the electrical potential across the membrane, thus affecting the probability of the opening of voltage-gated channels. Upon binding of glycine, the glycine receptor (GlyR) channel becomes permeable to small anions (Cl−), whose passive flux causes hyperpolarization of the cell. Strychnine, a convulsive alkaloid whose neurotoxic effect is attributed to blocking of the glycinergic transmission in the central nervous system, is the most potent known specific antagonist to the GlyR. By exploiting the strong antagonistic binding of strychnine (K d ∼ 5 nm), this ligand-gated channel was the first channel isolated and purified from mammalian nervous tissue via affinity chromatography on an aminostrychnine matrix (2Pfeiffer F. Graham D. Betz H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 9389-9393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking studies indicate that the native channel is a pentameric assembly of α (48 kDa) and β (58 kDa) subunits (3Langosch D. Thomas L. Betz H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7394-7398Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). These receptors copurify with gephyrin, an associated 93-kDa peripheral polypeptide that is essential for GlyR clustering (4Kirsch J. Wolters I. Triller A. Betz H. Nature. 1993; 366: 745-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar, 5Kirsch J. Betz H. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4148-4156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Meyer G. Kirsch J. Betz H. Langosch D.

Only limited structural information has been available for the GlyR, as well as other members of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily since the native protein subunits are typically produced in very low abundance. The member that is best characterized to date is the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAchR), which may be purified from a naturally abundant source, the electric organ of Torpedoelectric fish. The structure of nAchR has been imaged in the closed (10Unwin P.N.T. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 1101-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 11Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Stowell M. Unwin N. J.

From extensive affinity labeling and mutagenesis studies, a fairly detailed model of the agonist-binding site has evolved, suggesting that six loops from adjacent subunits form the agonist-binding pocket in the nAchR (see Refs. 13Sullivan D.A.

Additionally, residues localized to the transmembrane domains of these receptors have been identified by cysteine scanning methods (for review see Ref. 22Karlin A. Akabas M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 123-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar) as well as using lipophilic cross-linking agents (23Blanton M.P. Cohen J.B.

However, despite these and other studies on nAchR and other members of this neuroreceptor superfamily, the details of the molecular architecture of these ion channels remain refractory and subject to debate (for review see Ref. 26Green T. Heinemann S.F. Gusella J.F. Neuron. 1998; 20: 427-444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Initial models for the ligand-gated channel superfamily were derived immediately upon the cloning of the constituent nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunits based on hydropathy plots of the primary structure and evolved somewhat in subsequent years. The current generally accepted model for the family of ligand-gated channels contains four transmembrane helices, despite a paucity of structural evidence supporting this view. Although labeled “putative,” the presumed existence of these transmembrane helices is widely accepted. However, some structural studies have questioned this paradigm, indicating that the membrane spanning domains may also include β-strands (for review see Ref. 27Hucho F. Görne-Tschelnokow U. Strecker A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Modeling of the receptor now includes mixed α/β topology in the transmembrane segments (28Le Novere N. Corringer P.-J. Changeux J.-P. Biophys. J. 1999; 76: 2329-2345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Additionally, recent proteolytic studies conducted on reconstituted glycine receptors yielded an accessibility profile that precludes M1 and M3 from being transmembrane α-helices (29Leite J.F. Amoscato A. Cascio M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13683-13689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Studies on reconstituted nAchR also indicated that the classical model of M1 as a transmembrane helix is incompatible with labeling patterns obtained by derivatization with thiol-reactive compounds (30Barrantes F.J. Antollini S.S. Blanton M.P. Prieto M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37333-37339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Baculovirus expression systems have been found to be of general use in overexpressing membrane proteins that are typically expressed in nonfunctional form in simpler bacterial systems (31Schertler G.F.X. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1992; 2: 534-544Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 32Cascio M. Methods Neurosci. 1995; 25: 175-200Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). We (33Cascio M. Schoppa N.E. Grodzicki R.L. Sigworth F.J. Fox R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22135-22142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and others (34Morr J. Rundström N. Betz H. Langosch D. Schmitt B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 495-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) have applied a baculoviral expression system to produce sufficient quantities of α1-GlyR protein for subsequent biochemical and biophysical characterization. In whole cell and inside-out patch clamp experiments the insect-expressed homomeric receptors do indeed form a functional ligand-gated strychnine-inhibited chloride channel. Utilization of the baculovirus system that successfully overexpresses functional receptors is highly significant since it frees one from the limiting constraints of working with naturally abundant proteins. Given that we can overexpress an active glycine receptor on the surface of insect cells and purify relatively large amounts of protein (on the order of mg/liter of cell culture) which binds agonist and antagonist competitively (33Cascio M. Schoppa N.E. Grodzicki R.L. Sigworth F.J. Fox R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22135-22142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it remains to be shown that this solubilized and purified protein-detergent complex retains functionality. In this report it is shown that the purified protein can indeed be reconstituted into lipid vesicles as an active ligand-gated channel. Reconstitution into lipid vesicles was effected by gel filtration, and the activity was characterized at the level of single channels by electrophysiological measurements in black lipid membranes and macroscopically by measurement of the quenching of an internalized fluorescent probe by ion flux via channel opening. These results are significant in that they indicate later biophysical and biochemical characterization of reconstituted homomeric GlyR may be correlated to native structure. In this study, we also examine the secondary structure of the glycine receptor in lipid vesicles by CD. CD spectroscopy is a useful tool for examining the structure of membrane proteins; it is extremely sensitive to small changes in the folding of the peptide backbone and provides quantitative information on the net secondary structure of membrane proteins in a lipid environment, that of small unilamellar vesicles. These studies provide the first quantitation of glycine receptor secondary structure. Similar to the conclusions obtained in coupled proteolytic and mass spectrometric studies of reconstituted GlyR (29Leite J.F. Amoscato A. Cascio M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13683-13689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), these studies also indicate that the four transmembrane helix model for ligand-gated channels may be erroneous. The structural architecture of GlyR may be archetypic for the family of ligand-gated channels given the significant sequence and proposed topological similarities (1Betz H.

Pritchett, University of Pennsylvania) was inserted into a pBlueBac transfer vector (Invitrogen) and recombinantly incorporated into baculovirus and purified as described previously (33Cascio M. Schoppa N.E. Grodzicki R.L. Sigworth F.J. Fox R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22135-22142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All procedures involving insect cell culture were performed as described by Summers and Smith (36Summers M.D. Smith G.E. Tex. Agric. Exp. Stn. Bull. 1987; 1555: 1-57Google Scholar). Sf9 insect cells were grown in suspension under natural atmosphere at 27 °C in spinner flasks (gently stirred at 50 rpm) in Hink's TNM-FH insect media supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 0.1% Pluronic F-68, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 25 μg/ml fungizone. Independent preparations consisted of 750 ml of cells at an initial density of 1 × 106 cells/ml were infected with GlyR baculovirus at a high multiplicity of infection (>5), harvested 3 days post-infection by gentle centrifugation, and stored at −70 °C until needed. Solubilization of the membrane components in a solubilization buffer containing 1% digitonin and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate and subsequent purification of the GlyR by affinity chromatography on aminostrychnine agarose were as described previously (33Cascio M. Schoppa N.E. Grodzicki R.L. Sigworth F.J. Fox R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22135-22142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein purification was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar) and Western immunoblotting, using an affinity-purified antibody against a decapeptide corresponding to the amino-terminal 10 residues of α1-GlyR, samples of which were organically extracted (38Wessel D. Flugge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3170) Google Scholar) before electrophoresis. The final buffer conditions of the solubilized purified protein was 1% digitonin, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1 m KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 200 mm glycine, 1.5 mg/ml phosphatidylcholine, and 25 mm KPi, pH 7.4. Reconstitution protocols were adapted from Garcia-Calvo et al. (39Garcia-Calvo M. Ruiz-Gomez A. Vazquez J. Morato E. Valdivieso F. Mayor Jr., F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6405-6409Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). All reconstitution procedures were carried out at 4 °C. Aliquots of purified detergent-solubilized α1-GlyR (1–2 ml) were applied to a Sephadex G-100 column (∼45 ml of swollen resin, 1.2 × 25 cm) pre-equilibrated with the reconstitution buffer, 25 mm KPi, pH 7.4. Sample was eluted with reconstitution buffer by gravity flow at a flow rate of ∼4.0 ml/h. Eluted protein was collected with the void volume, as observed by A 280 and verified by Western immunoblotting of eluant fractions applied to nitrocellulose via a dot blot apparatus (Scott Laboratories). The absence of detergent from these fractions was verified by thin layer chromatography. Silica plates were spotted with eluant fractions, run in either CHCl3/methanol/H2O (65:25:4) or ethyl acetate/methanol (4:1) and developed by acid hydrolysis. Each pool of reconstituted protein in lipid vesicles isolated from a given preparation was partitioned into 3 aliquots for subsequent characterization via microscopic and macroscopic activity assay and CD spectroscopy, thereby ensuring the equivalence of the experimental samples. Aliquots of purified reconstituted preparations prepared for CD measurements were further diluted into a hypertonic solution, such that the final buffer was 120 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 25 mm KPi, pH 7.4, with an additional 600 mm sucrose constituent, freeze-thawed once, and then bath-sonicated at room temperature for 30 s. Small aliquots of the final vesicle suspension were stored frozen at −70 °C. To form membranes, a glass applicator coated with the PE/decane solution and dipped into the vesicle suspension was used to form a membrane across the ∼200-μm aperture of a Teflon partition as described previously (40Shenkel S. Cooper E.C. James W. Agnew W.S. Sigworth F.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9592-9596Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The bathing solutions were chosen to match those used in previous whole cell recordings (33Cascio M. Schoppa N.E. Grodzicki R.L. Sigworth F.J. Fox R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22135-22142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The “front” chamber, which was held at zero potential, contained 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 2 mmCaCl2, 10 mm HEPES and the back chamber contained 140 mm CsCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm HEPES. Glycine or strychnine were added to the front chamber as noted. Membrane currents were recorded with a Warner BC-525 amplifier and stored on videotape using an Instrutech VR-10 PCM encoder. Recordings were transferred digitally to a Macintosh computer and filtered with a Gaussian filter to a bandwidth of 50–200 Hz for analysis. Vesicles containing α1-GlyR protein were prepared as described above, except conditions were scaled up as follows: 10–15 ml of purified sample were applied to a 2.6 × 40-cm Sephacryl S-100 column, and a flow rate of ∼ 0.5 ml/min was maintained by peristaltic pumping. The reconstituted GlyR vesicles were fused with sonicated liposomes (22.5 mg/ml crude soybean phospholipid, 4.5 mg/ml cholesterol) by freeze-thaw sonication in the presence of either 6-methoxy-N-(3-sulfopropyl)quinolinium (SPQ, Molecular Probes) or N-(carboxymethyl)-6-methoxyquinolinium bromide (MQAA, Molecular Probes), I−-quenched fluorescent probes, under conditions yielding a final concentration of 120 mmpotassium gluconate, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 25 mm KPi, pH 7.4. To form small tight unilamellar vesicles of approximately uniform diameter, samples were probe-sonicated immediately before fluorescence measurement. Samples were jacketed in an ice bath and sonicated using a Branson Sonifier 450 microtip at setting 6, with 50% pulses (½ s on and ½ s off) applied in three 20-s bursts with the sample allowed to thermally equilibrate between bursts. Aggregates were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min. Flux assays were adapted from Garcı́a-Calvo et al. (39Garcia-Calvo M. Ruiz-Gomez A. Vazquez J. Morato E. Valdivieso F. Mayor Jr., F. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6405-6409Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), with the major modification being the elimination of the additional gel filtration step to remove external probe. Blank control vesicles without protein were prepared as above except solubilization buffer without protein was applied to the gel filtration column. External quenching of the fluorescent indicator by iodide was complete within the instrumental dead time, similar to that observed for chloride (less than 2 ms) (41Illsley N.P. Verkman A.S. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 1215-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Given the rapid quenching, external fluorophores were not removed after vesicle loading due to the large reduction in fluorescent signal observed after the additional gel filtration required to remove external MQAA or SPQ (data not shown). This reduction was probably due to slow leakage of the internal fluorescent indicator driven by equilibration during the time-consuming chromatography. Emission spectra were initially collected on a Spex Fluorimax DM3000 fluorimeter using SPQ, with 344 nm excitation and emission monitored at 443 nm, using a 1-cm path length quartz cell (Hellma). Emission spectra were collected for 30 s at 100-ms intervals. After ∼5 s of base-line measurement, 100 μl of vesicle samples were rapidly diluted 20-fold into the cuvette containing iso-osmotic quench buffer (80 mm potassium gluconate, 40 mm NaI, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 25 mmKPi, pH 7.4, ± 100 μm glycine). The base-line curves observed before the addition of SPQ-containing aliquots and t 0, the time when sample was introduced into the cuvette, were matched, and the data were averaged over the entire scan. Mixing was done by magnetic stirring using a Glas-Col microsubmersible stirring. While the DM3000 fluorimeter provided sensitive quantitation of activity, the slow mixing precluded accurate quantitation of the time constant for the rapid quenching upon channel opening. To determine more accurately the channel kinetics, additional studies were conducted using a stopped-flow fluorimeter and are described below. In these later studies, SPQ was replaced with MQAA as an indicator since it is more efficiently quenched and more polar (less apt to leak out of the vesicles). For MQAA, excitation wavelength was 350 nm, and emission was monitored at 460 nm. The observed channel activity was reproducible in all studies. The mass flux studies presented herein were conducted using an Applied Photophysics Stopped-flow Spectrakinetic Monochrometer, using conditions identical to those above except that vesicle samples were diluted with an equal volume of quench buffer of equivalent composition except ±200 μm glycine. Collection of the data was partitioned such that half of the time points were collected in the first 200 ms, and the other half was collected over 2 s. To estimate the number of oligomers incorporated per vesicle, phosphate and protein assays were performed on each sample. Phospholipid concentration was determined by the method of Fiske and Subbarow (42Fiske C.H. Subbarow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). GlyR concentration was determined by modified Lowry assay (43Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7134) Google Scholar) in which the protein concentrations relative to standard curves of bovine serum albumin were correlated to the concentration as determined by quantitative amino acid analyses on representative samples. Vesicle size was measured by light scattering on a Nicomp model 279 Submicron Particle Sizer (Pacific Scientific). Vesicles containing purified human α1-glycine receptor were reconstituted as described above, providing a vesicle suspension in 25 mmKPi buffer, pH 7.4. Samples were additionally probe-sonicated to yield small unilamellar vesicles using a Branson Sonifier 450 microtip at setting 6, with 50% pulses (½ s on and ½ s off) applied in three 20-s bursts with the sample jacketed in an ice bath and allowed to thermally equilibrate between bursts. Aggregates were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 10 min, and the isolated supernatant was optically clear. Incorporation of the reconstituted protein into small vesicles (much smaller than the wavelength of the incident light) with high lipid-to-protein ratios minimizes differential light scattering and absorption flattening effects, respectively, two potential artifacts arising due to the particulate nature of the lipid-protein complexes (44Mao D. Wallace B.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 2667-2673Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Typically, samples of reconstituted receptor was not diluted CD measurements and had a final concentration of 0.08–0.1 mg/ml. Blank vesicles without protein were made by injecting equivalent volumes of solubilization buffer alone to the gel filtration column (as described above), and (protein-free) vesicles eluting in the void volume were treated equivalently for use as blanks. Measurements were made using an Aviv 62DS spectropolarimeter. At least 10 reproducible spectra were collected for each preparation, averaged, and smoothed using a Savitzky and Golay filter (45Savitzky A. Golay M.J.E. Anal. Chem. 1964; 36: 1627-1639Crossref Scopus (15113) Google Scholar). All reported spectra were base-line corrected (by subtraction of similarly collected, averaged, and smoothed base lines of vesicles identically prepared, except without purified protein) and are the average of two independent preparations. All measurements were taken over the wavelength range from 300 to as low as 185 nm, with a 0.5-nm step size, at room temperature using a 0.1-cm path length quartz cell (Hellma). For one sample, ellipticity measurements below 195 nm were precluded due to solvent absorption. The CD spectra of the protein in the near UV region were analyzed by two independent methods. In the first method a linear, unconstrained least squares curve-fitting procedure (46Mao D. Wachter E. Wallace B.A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 4960-4968Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) was employed using a reference set derived from 15 water-soluble proteins (47Chang C.T. Wu C.C. Yang J.T. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 91: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). The second method of analysis utilized singular value decomposition (SVD) (48Manavalan P. Johnson Jr., W.C. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 167: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar) in which poly(l-proline)-type (PII) conformations were incorporated in the analyses using the self-consistent methodology of Sreerama and Woody (49Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10022-10025Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) using the program SELCON3. Electrophysiological studies, in which purified α1-glycine receptors reconstituted into lipid vesicles were incorporated into planar bilayers, showed functional glycine-gated and strychnine-inhibited ion channels. The voltage dependence of single channel current in symmetrical solutions was nearly linear, with a main conductance level of 79 pS (Fig. 1), corresponding to the ∼70-pS conductance observed in patch clamp recordings of Sf9 cells under comparable conditions (33Cascio M. Schoppa N.E. Grodzicki R.L. Sigworth F.J. Fox R.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22135-22142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As has been reported for native glycine receptor channels (50Bormann J. Rundstrom N. Betz H. Langosch D. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3729-3737Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar) and homo-oligomeric α1-channels transfected into human embryonic kidney cells (20Rajendra S. Lynch J.W. Pierce K.D. French C.R.

The most prominent had a conductance of 47 pS but represented only about 8% of the total channel open time (Fig. 1 C). Increasing glycine concentration increased the"
https://openalex.org/W2325246479,"The tumor suppressor p53 transcriptionally regulates a large number of target genes that may affect cell growth and cell death pathways. To better understand the role of p53 loss in tumorigenesis, we have developed a mouse mammary cancer model, the Wnt-1 TG/p53 model. Wnt-1 transgenic females that are p53-/- develop mammary adenocarcinomas that arise sooner, grow faster, appear more anaplastic, and have higher levels of chromosomal instability than their Wnt-1 transgenic p53+/+ counterparts. In this study, we used several assays to determine whether the presence or absence of p53 affects gene expression patterns in the mammary adenocarcinomas. Most of the differentially expressed genes are increased in p53+/+ tumors and many of these represent known target genes of p53 (p21WAF/C1P1, cyclin G1, alpha smooth muscle actin, and cytokeratin 19). Some of these genes (cytokeratin 19, alpha smooth muscle actin, and kappa casein) represent mammary gland differentiation markers which may contribute to the inhibited tumor progression and are consistent with the more differentiated histopathology observed in the p53+/+ tumors. Several differentially expressed genes are growth regulatory in function (p21, c-kit, and cyclin B1) and their altered expression levels correlate well with the differing growth properties of the p53+/+ and p53-/- tumors. Thus, while tumors can arise and progress in the presence of functioning wild type p53, p53 may directly or indirectly regulate expression of an array of genes that facilitate differentiation and inhibit proliferation, contributing to a more differentiated, slow growing, and genomically stable phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2088804277,"Biglycan is a member of the small leucine-rich proteoglycan family. Its core protein comprises two chondroitin/dermatan sulfate attachment sites on serine 42 and serine 47, respectively, which are the fifth and tenth amino acid residues, respectively, after removal of the prepro peptide. Because the regulation of glycosaminoglycan chain assembly is not fully understood and because of the in vivo existence of monoglycanated biglycan, mutant core proteins were stably expressed in human 293 and Chinese hamster ovary cells in which i) either one or both serine residues were converted into alanine or threonine residues, ii) the number of acidic amino acids N-terminal of the respective serine residues was altered, and iii) a hexapeptide was inserted between the mutated site 1 and the unaltered site 2. Labeling experiments with [35S]sulfate and [35S]methionine indicated that serine 42 was almost fully used as the glycosaminoglycan attachment site regardless of whether site 2 was available or not for chain assembly. In contrast, substitution of site 2 was greatly influenced by the presence or absence of serine 42, although additional mutations demonstrated a direct influence of the amino acid sequence between the two sites. When site 2 was not substituted with a glycosaminoglycan chain, there was also no assembly of the linkage region. These results indicate that xylosyltransferase is the rate-limiting enzyme in glycosaminoglycan chain assembly and implicate a cooperative effect on the xylosyl transfer to site 2 by xylosylation of site 1, which probably becomes manifest before the removal of the propeptide. It is shown additionally that biglycan expressed in 293 cells may still contain the propeptide sequence and may carry heparan sulfate chains as well as sulfated N-linked oligosaccharides.

It is shown additionally that biglycan expressed in 293 cells may still contain the propeptide sequence and may carry heparan sulfate chains as well as sulfated N-linked oligosaccharides. The biosynthesis of proteoglycans is a complex process in which, in the case of chondroitin and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, the assembly of the glycosaminoglycan side chains begins with the transfer of xylose from UDP-xylose to the hydroxyl group of selected serine residues of the core protein (1Esko J.D. Zhang L. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 663-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). A recognition consensus sequence for the attachment of xylose residues may consist of two acidic amino acids closely followed by the tetrapeptide Ser-Gly-Xaa-Gly, where Xaa is any amino acid (2Bourdon M.A. Krusius T. Campbell S. Schwartz N.B. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3194-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 3Kearns A.E. Campbell S.C. Westley J. Schwartz N.B.

However, a sequence comparison of several proteoglycan core proteins indicated that the second glycine residue was present in only 19% of the cases, and there was also only an ∼50% abundance of acidic residues among the three amino acids preceding the glycosaminoglycan attachment site (5Brinkmann T. Weilke C. Kleesiek K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11171-11175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Furthermore, a Gly-Ser-Ala sequence instead of the Xaa-Ser-Gly sequence is found at the chondroitin sulfate attachment site of chicken type IX collagen (6Huber S. Winterhalter K.H. Vaughan L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 752-756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and threonine substitutions of serine residues can serve as acceptors for chain assembly, albeit at low efficiency (7Mann D.M. Yamaguchi Y. Bourdon M.A. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The situation is additionally complicated by the fact that established attachment sites are not necessarily used regularly, giving rise to so-called part-time proteoglycans. This has been considered as a result of the possibility that the attachment site is not always recognized by xylosyltransferase and that there may be competition for substrate between xylosyltransferase and glycoproteinN-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (8Gerlitz B. Hassell T. Vlahos C.J. Parkinson J.F. Bang N.U. Grinnell B.W. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 131-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the glycosaminoglycan-free form of the part-time proteoglycan thrombomodulin, the respective serine residue is substituted with the linkage region tetrasaccharide GlcAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl (9Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33728-33734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), raising the possibility that it is the transfer of the fifth monosaccharide (either GalNAc or GlcNAc) that represents the most critical step in glycosaminoglycan chain biosynthesis. Considering the complexity of glycosaminoglycan chain assembly, we have focused on the biosynthesis of biglycan. Biglycan belongs to the family of small leucine-rich proteoglycans (for recent reviews see Refs. 10Hocking A.M. Shinomura T. McQuillan D.J. Matrix Biol. 1998; 17: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar, 11Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1341) Google Scholar, 12Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18843-18846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (574) Google Scholar) and carries most often two chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chains that are linked to serines 42 and 47 of the full-length human core protein sequence (13Fisher L.W. Termine J.D. Young M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4571-4576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence around these serine residues (marked by an asterisk) is DEEAS*GADTS*GVLD. However, usage of the two sites is normally not complete (14Neame P.J. Choi H.U. Rosenberg L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8653-8661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and up to 30% of the core protein may be substituted with a single chain only (15Schönherr E. Beavan L.A. Hausser H. Kresse H. Culp L.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Biglycan contains a prepro sequence of 38 amino acids. The propeptide whose function is not fully known is not necessarily removed prior to or after secretion (16Roughley P.J. White R.J. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 979-984Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Additional proteolytic processing may take place after removal of the propeptide, accounting for nonglycanated forms of the molecule (17Roughley P.J. White R.J. Magny M.C. Liu J. Pearce R.H. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 1993; 295: 421-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar,18Johnstone B. Markopoulos M. Neame P. Caterson B. Biochem. J. 1993; 292: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The presence of only two glycosaminoglycan attachment sites that are located in close proximity made biglycan an ideal candidate to study glycosaminoglycan chain assembly in a still simple, yet somewhat more complex system than in the case of the monoglycanated small proteoglycan decorin, where glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis has been studied in great detail (2Bourdon M.A. Krusius T. Campbell S. Schwartz N.B. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3194-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 7Mann D.M. Yamaguchi Y. Bourdon M.A. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5317-5323Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It will be shown that the attachment of the two chains is regulated differently. Total RNA was isolated from human MG-63 osteosarcoma cells, which are known to produce high quantities of biglycan. It was subjected to reverse transcription with AMV reverse transcriptase and an oligo(dT)15 primer. Then the complete biglycan coding sequence was amplified by the Expand High Fidelity polymerase chain reaction system (Roche Diagnostics; polymerase chain reaction conditions: denaturation for 1 min at 94 °C, annealing for 1 min at 58 °C, and elongation for 2 min at 72 °C) using the forward primer 5′-GTTGGAATTCGAGTAGCTGCTTTCGGTCC-3′ and the reverse and complement primer 5′-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCCAAGGCTGGAAATG-3′. The primers introduce anEcoRI and a NotI restriction site, respectively, near the 5′ and 3′ ends of the amplified sequence. UponEcoRI/NotI digestion, the purified amplification product was ligated into the EcoRI/NotI-digested pcDNA3.1 (+) vector (Invitrogen). The plasmid was isolated after transformation of competent Escherichia coli TOP 10F′. Biglycan mutations were introduced by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and HPSF quality oligonucleotides (MWG Biotec) as primers. The method uses forward and reverse primers that carry the base exchange in the center of their sequence and anneal to identical positions of the plasmid. High fidelity Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase was used for amplification. The polymerase chain reaction conditions were as follows: denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 1 min at 55 °C, and elongation for 14 min at 68 °C. After 30 polymerase chain reaction cycles, the methylated template was degraded by DpnI, and XL1-Blue supercompetent cells were used for transformation without prior ligation. The forward primers used to introduce mutations of the wild-type sequence were as follows: BGN S42A, 5′-GATGAGGAAGCTGCGGGCGCTGACAC-3′; BGN S42T, 5′-CGATGAGGAAGCTACGGGCGCTGACAC-3′; BGN S47A, 5′-CGCTGACACCGCAGGCGTCCTGGAC-3′. The latter primer was also used to mutate BGN S42A for the generation of the double mutant BGN S42A/ S47A. The primer pair 5-AAGGTGCCCAAGGGAGATTTCAGCGGGCTCC-3′ and 5-GGAGCCCGCTGAAATCTCCCTTGGGCACCTT-3′ served for the construction of the triple mutant BGN S42A/S47A/ V178D. With the use of the BGN S42A construct as template, BGN S42A/A44D was made by using 5′-GAAGCTGCGGGCGATGACACCTCAGG-3′ as forward primer. The BGN S47A construct served as template to generate BGN E39Q/S47A with the forward primer 5-′CATGATGAACGATCAGGAAGCTTCGGGCG-3′. Sequencing of all constructs verified the introduction of the desired point mutations and the absence of mutations in the other parts of the cDNA sequence. Finally, a hexapeptide, IGPQVP, which is similar to the hexapeptide following the Ser-Gly attachment site in decorin (IGPEVP), was placed between Gly43 and Ala44 of the S42A biglycan mutant. In the first step 5′- and 3′-portions of the desired sequence were generated by using the primers corresponding to the vector sequences mentioned above, the reverse and complement primer 5′-GGGCACCTGGGGGCCGATGCCCGCAGCTTCCTCATC-3′ (5′ portion) and the forward primer 5′-ATCGGCCCCCAGGTGCCCGCTGACACCTCAGGCGTCC-3′ (3′ portion), respectively. The amplified products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and subjected to a second polymerase chain reaction by using the two primers designed from the multicloning site. The cDNA thus obtained was ligated into the pcDNA3.1 (+) vector after EcoRI/XbaI digestion. The mutants used are summarized in Fig. 1. Cultured human 293 kidney cells were transfected with the unmodified pcDNA3.1 (+) vector or with this vector containing one of the above mentioned constructs by using LipofectAMINE 2000 (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The cells were selected for neomycine resistance by adding 750 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). The expression of human decorin cDNA in 293 cells has been described before (19Kresse H. Liszio C. Schönherr E. Fisher L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18404-18410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Wild-type BGN, BGN S42A, and BGN S47A were also used to transfect Chinese hamster ovary cells and COS-7 cells by an analogous procedure. COS cells were used for experiments 2 days after transfection. Unlabeled reference biglycan was purified from the culture media of 293 cells stably transfected with wild-type human biglycan cDNA. Purification included ammonium sulfate precipitation and anion exchange chromatography as described (20Hausser H. Hoppe W. Rauch U. Kresse H. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), except that during the latter step NaCl was replaced by KCl. Biglycan-containing fractions that were eluted from the DEAE column with 0.6 m KCl were made 2m with (NH4)2SO4 and directly applied to a phenyl-Sepharose column (Sigma; 1 ml of gel/50 ml of conditioned medium) equilibrated with 10 mmK2SO4, pH 6.8, containing 2 m(NH4)2SO4. The column was washed with 3 volumes of starting buffer and then with 3 volumes each of this buffer in which the (NH4)2SO4concentration had been reduced to 1 m, 0.5 m, and 0.2 m, respectively. Analytically pure biglycan (purity >95%) was desorbed with water. Metabolic labeling of subconfluent 293, Chinese hamster ovary, and COS cells with [35S]sulfate (incubation period 24 h) and [35S]methionine (incubation period 8 h) was performed as described earlier (19Kresse H. Liszio C. Schönherr E. Fisher L.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18404-18410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). When [35S]methionine labeling was performed in the presence ofp-nitrophenyl-β-d-xyloside (Sigma), the xyloside was already present during the 1-h preincubation period in methionine-free medium. For labeling with [1-3H]galactose (ICN Pharmaceuticals; specific radioactivity 18 Ci/mmol), Waymouth MAB 87/3 medium containing 4% fetal calf serum and only 1.4 mmglucose was used. Incubation was for 24 h in the presence of 14 ml of culture medium with 500 μCi of 3H radioactivity per 75-cm2 culture flask. At the end of the incubations, medium was mixed with proteinase inhibitors and made 70% saturated with (NH4)2SO4. After centrifugation, the pellet from one 25-cm2 culture flask was dissolved in 300 μl of 0.1 m Tris/HCl buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1m NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and proteinase inhibitors. The solution was first allowed to react with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma; 1.5 mg of dry gel per 25-cm2flask), which had been preincubated with preimmune rabbit antisera as described (15Schönherr E. Beavan L.A. Hausser H. Kresse H. Culp L.A. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 893-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Biglycan was subsequently immunoprecipitated by applying 6 mg of protein A-Sepharose per 25-cm2 flask, which had been coated with a monospecific rabbit antiserum against a KLH-coupled biglycan-derived peptide raised analogously as described (13Fisher L.W. Termine J.D. Young M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4571-4576Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein A-Sepharose-bound immune complexes were subjected to digestions with chondroitinases ABC and ACII (20Hausser H. Hoppe W. Rauch U. Kresse H. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and/or heparinases I and III (21Hausser H. Kresse H. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 827-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) as described. Treatment with peptide:N-glycosidase F was for 20 h at 37 °C in 60 μl of sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 0.3 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 3.3 mm EDTA, 0.4% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 0.06% (w/v) SDS, 0.3% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, and 500 units of enzyme (New England Biolabs). After enzyme treatment, the protein A-Sepharose-bound material was washed twice with 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, prior to SDS-PAGE.1 Use of [35S]methionine-labeled proteoglycan established the complete removal of the glycosaminoglycan chains and theN-linked oligosaccharides by this methodology. SDS-PAGE followed either by fluorography or by Western blotting was performed as described previously (20Hausser H. Hoppe W. Rauch U. Kresse H. Biochem. J. 1989; 263: 137-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 22Hausser H. Ober B. Quentin-Hoffmann E. Schmidt B. Kresse H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11559-11564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorograms were evaluated with the ImageQuant 5.0 software program (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Western blots were probed with antisera against biglycan (see above), biglycan propeptide (16Roughley P.J. White R.J. Mort J.S. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 979-984Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and the HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope (a kind gift of Dr. M. Schachner, University of Hamburg, Germany). Automated protein sequencing was performed on a Procise 492–01 gas phase sequencer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). A search for tyrosine O-sulfation was attempted after hydrolysis of core proteins under nitrogen in 1 m NaOH for 24 h at 110 °C (23Mintz K.P. Fisher L.W. Grzesik W.J. Hascall V.C. Midura R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4845-4852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within 24 h stably transfected 293 cells synthesized about 0.5 pg of biglycan core protein per cell. Surprisingly, however, its glycosaminoglycan chains were not completely sensitive toward degradation by chondroitin ABC lyase. Between 5 and 15% of total [35S]sulfate incorporated into biglycan remained in a monoglycanated form. The same observations were made with Chinese hamster ovary cells. The label could be completely removed by treatment with heparinases I and III (Fig.2), indicating that a subset of biglycan, synthesized by these cells, is a hybrid proteoglycan. However, glycosaminoglycan-free core protein was not observed when biglycan was treated with heparinases only. Experiments with [35S]methionine-labeled biglycan corroborated these results (data not shown). Thus, only when two glycosaminoglycan chains were present could one of the chains be composed of heparan sulfate. It was also investigated whether or not the secreted proteoglycan still carries the propeptide sequence. With the use of propeptide-specific antibodies, the presence of such a sequence could be verified in Western blots of biglycan purified from 293 cells (Fig.3). However, amino acid sequencing revealed that at most 15% of the total quantity of secreted core protein contained the propeptide sequence, which comprised amino acids Phe19–Asn37. For studying the structural prerequisites for glycosaminoglycan chain attachment to serines 42 and 47, respectively, of biglycan core protein, a series of mutations was created that is summarized in Fig.1. In a first series of experiments the serine residues were replaced by alanine and used for studying biglycan biosynthesis in human 293 cells. Complementary experiments were performed with Chinese hamster ovary and COS cells. The consequences for glycosaminoglycan chain attachment turned out to be different depending on which one of the two serine residues was mutated. In the S47A mutant biglycan, the core protein became substituted with a single glycosaminoglycan chain, which was to be expected (shown for 293 cells in Fig.4). In contrast, in the S42A mutant about 80% of the core protein was secreted into the culture medium without being substituted with a glycosaminoglycan chain. This percentage did not differ between the three cell types under study. The glycosaminoglycan chain-bearing species exhibited a somewhat slower and a less heterogeneous migration pattern during SDS-PAGE than did the monoglycanated proteoglycan resulting from the S47A mutation. Such a migration behavior is best explained by assuming that the glycosaminoglycan chain of the S42A mutant is somewhat larger and less heterogeneous in size than that of the other mutant. As an alternative to alanine, serine-42 was also replaced by threonine. In this mutant, too, the majority of serine 47 residues remained unused (Fig.5). In the double mutant S42A/S47A, an alternative use of other potential glycosaminoglycan attachment sites could not be observed. As will be discussed below, the glycosaminoglycan-free, but still N-glycanated, core proteins were nevertheless substituted with [35S]sulfate residues.Figure 5Glycosaminoglycan substitution of biglycan mutants S42T, S42A/A44D, and E39Q/S47A as determined by [35S]sulfate incorporation. Secreted biglycan was obtained by immunoprecipitation from the mutants indicated and from 293 cells transfected with wild-type (WT) biglycan or insert-free control vector (CV) prior to SDS-PAGE and fluorography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The proposed consensus sequence for glycosaminoglycan chain attachment is fitted better for use of serine 42 than of serine 47 (Fig. 1). Further constructs were, therefore, generated to optimize the use of the latter site by introducing an additional acidic residue and to make the first site less efficient by removal of an acid residue. Serine 42 was always fully substituted by a glycosaminoglycan chain regardless of whether or not a preceding acidic residue had been exchanged for a neutral one. Use of serine 47, however, could remarkably be stimulated, although complete substitution was never approached (Figs. 5 and6). The results of three or more separate incubations are summarized in TableI.Table IComposition of glycosaminoglycan-containing biglycan secreted by 293 cellsWild typeS42AS42TS47AS42A/A44DE39Q/S47A% of total2 glycosaminoglycan chains84–94000001 glycosaminoglycan chain9–1415–2525–3598–10050–5696–100Free core protein0–675–8565–750–244–500–4 Open table in a new tab From the data described so far it appeared that use of serine 47 was markedly dependent on a substitution of serine 42. To study this point further, a hexapeptide was inserted in the S42A mutant in front of the serine 47 residue. This novel mutant protein, too, was secreted normally. However, [35S]sulfate incorporation into a chondroitin ABC lyase-sensitive glycosaminoglycan chain was just above the limit of detection (Fig. 7), whereas the secretion of the glycosaminoglycan-free core protein remained unaltered. Similarly, attempts to create a new glycosaminoglycan attachment site at serine 180 in the S42A/S47A double mutant by inserting aspartate in position 178 were unsuccessful (result not shown). This negative result should be seen in the context that of all unused Ser-Gly sites, serine 180 should have the greatest distance fromN-glycosylation sites and, in analogy to the proposed horseshoe structure of decorin (24Weber I.T. Harrison R.W. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31767-31770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar), should be located at the unrestricted convex site of the molecule. The majority of serine 47 residues were not substituted with a full-length glycosaminoglycan chain in the S42A mutant. The substitution of this residue with a linkage region tetrasaccharide, however, would have escaped detection. To study this possibility, 293 cells harboring the S42A mutation were, therefore, incubated with a high quantity of [1-3H]galactose for 24 h. The medium was then passed over a DEAE-Trisacryl M column, and unbound biglycan core protein was recovered by immunoprecipitation. The immune complex was exhaustively digested with endoglycosidase F to remove all asparagine-bound oligosaccharides. No 3H radioactivity remained associated with the immune complex. As a control for a proteoglycan with a single glycosaminoglycan chain, 293 cells transfected stably with human decorin cDNA were used and labeled under identical conditions. In this case, the whole medium was subjected to decorin immunoprecipitation followed by digestion of the immune complex with chondroitin ABC and ACII lyases and then with endoglycosidase F. The immune complex still contained 1920 cpm of3H radioactivity. It was therefore concluded that serine 47 was either substituted with a full-length glycosaminoglycan chain or was devoid of a galactose-containing linkage region oligosaccharide. This conclusion was further supported by the observation of a slightly different migration behavior during SDS-PAGE of the unsubstituted S42A core protein and the S42A core protein obtained by chondroitin ABC lyase treatment. In further experiments, competition for glycosaminoglycan chain assembly by exogenously addedp-nitrophenyl-β-d-xyloside was studied. Neither in the S42A nor in the S47A mutant was the use of the remaining glycosaminoglycan chain attachment site influenced by increasing doses of the competitor. However, shorter glycosaminoglycan chains were assembled at high xyloside concentrations (Fig.8). These data suggest that the activity of galactosyltransferases is not the rate-limiting step during the formation of the linkage region. Hence, it seems likely that serine 47 was also not substituted with xylose in the glycosaminoglycan-free species of the S42A mutant. As seen in Fig. 2 and subsequent figures, the core protein of biglycan could be labeled with [35S]sulfate. Combined digestion with chondroitin ABC lyase and chondroitin ACII lyase for complete removal of the glycosaminoglycan chains with the exception of the linkage region tetrasaccharide did not result in complete desulfation. Because small proteoglycans may carry tyrosine O-sulfate residues (25Rauch U. Hollmann J. Schmidt A. Buddecke E. Kresse H. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1988; 369: 595-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 26Antonsson P. Heinegård D. Oldberg Å. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16859-16861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), biglycan core proteins were subjected to alkaline hydrolysis. Thereafter, all radioactivity could be removed as insoluble barium salt, thereby excluding the presence of alkali-stable tyrosineO-sulfate residues. However, the label could completely be removed by treatment with endoglycosidase F, indicating that sulfate ester may be present on one or both of the two asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of biglycan (Fig. 9).N-linked oligosaccharides may carry a terminal 3-sulfated GlcA residue as part of the HNK-1 carbohydrate epitope (27Voshol H. van Zuylen C.W. Orberger G. Vliegenthart J.F. Schachner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22957-22960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Westerns blots with antibodies against this epitope were negative for biglycan core protein although proteins of higher molecular weight in the medium of transfected 293 cells gave a positive immune reaction (result not shown). Whether or not asparagine-linked oligosaccharides of biglycan core protein contain sulfatedN-acetyllactosamine units (28Torii T. Fukuta M. Habuchi O. Glycobiology. 2000; 10: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) was not investigated further. The main result of this study is the observation that of the two glycosaminoglycan attachment sites of biglycan the more C-terminally located one is used nearly completely only when the first attachment site is available. This result should be considered in light of the high wild-type biglycan production of transfected 293 and CHO cells. Hence, it appears unlikely that the data obtained with mutant core proteins simply reflect the limited capacity for glycosaminoglycan chain assembly of these cells. Furthermore, [35S]sulfate labeling studies withp-nitrophenyl-β-d-xyloside as primer molecule also supported this conclusion. Monoglycanated biglycan has also been extracted from normal tissue. However, it has not yet been investigated systematically which of the two glycosaminoglycan attachment sites were used in these cases. In bovine articular cartilage both sites were almost completely substituted (14Neame P.J. Choi H.U. Rosenberg L.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8653-8661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) whereas, as anticipated from the present study, the second site was less frequently used in biglycan from human bone (29Fisher L.W. Hawkins G.R. Tuross N. Termine J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 9702-9708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analogous data were obtained with chicken decorin, which resembles mammalian biglycan because it may also carry two chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chains linked to serine 4 and serine 16, respectively. In the monoglycanated proteoglycan form, serine 4 was used exclusively (30Blaschke U.K. Hedbom E. Bruckner P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30347-30353Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Information on the usage of the multiple sites of other chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycans is not available. In a study on the glycosaminoglycan attachment sites of perlecan it has been shown that the serine residues 65, 71, and 76 could be used individually when the two other sites were mutated to threonine (31Dolan M. Horchar T. Rigatti B. Hassell J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4316-4322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). As in our model, the remaining serine residue did not serve as acceptor site in all molecules, but a sequence-dependent change in the efficiency of usage did not become evident. A direct comparison of the data with respect to site effectiveness, however, is difficult because a deletion of 110 amino acids was present in the perlecan construct eight amino acids C-terminal of serine 76, the last glycanated serine residue. The existence of core protein-specific pathways may also be envisaged (32Wong-Palms S. Plaas A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Direct biosynthetic labeling of the linkage region together with the results of competition experiments withp-nitrophenyl-β-d-xyloside strongly suggested that in the S42A mutant, serine 47 was either linked with a full-length glycosaminoglycan chain or not substituted at all with carbohydrate. This finding indicated that UDP-d-xylose:protein β-d-xylosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.26) is the rate-limiting step in glycosaminoglycan chain assembly and not, as in the case of thrombomodulin, a β-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (9Nadanaka S. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33728-33734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Also in other aspects of glycosaminoglycan chain initiation, thrombomodulin appears to exhibit special features, because the attachment consensus sequence is less well preserved, and, most strikingly, different serine residues can be used in different cells (33Lin J.-H. McLean K. Morser J. Young T.A. Wydro R.M. Andrews W.H. Light D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25021-25030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Xylose addition appears to begin in the endoplasmic reticulum and to continue in intermediate compartments, perhaps including the cis-Golgi, where galactose is added prior to the assembly of the repetitive disaccharide structures (34Lohmander L.S. Shinomura T. Hascall V.C. Kimura J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18775-18780Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Kearns A.E. Vertel B.M. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11097-11104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Vertel B.M. Walters L.M. Flay N. Kearns A.E. Schwartz N.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11105-11112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For an explanation of the apparent cooperativity between the usage of the two glycosaminoglycan attachment sites that are located close to the N terminus of the mature core protein, it is tempting to assume that the propeptide contributes to optimal recognition of the first serine residue by the xylosyltransferase. The second serine residue then becomes more easily recognized, although an independent usage of it may occur and may become facilitated by an appropriate introduction of an additional acidic amino acid close to its N-terminal site. The compartment where the propeptide sequence of biglycan and decorin is normally removed has not yet been directly defined. The recent observation that bone morphogenetic protein-1 (procollagen C-proteinase) processes probiglycan (37Scott I.C. Imamura Y. Pappanao W.N. Troedel J.M. Recklies A.D. Roughley P.J. Greenspan D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 30504-30511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) strongly suggests that this cleavage occurs after secretion or immediately prior to it. Thus, a regulatory influence of the propeptide on chain initiation is compatible with the topography of probiglycan processing. The N terminus of the propeptide was found to be generated by proteolysis at an unusual cleavage site between Pro18 and Phe19 and not as often after a small amino acid (38von Heijne J. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1532) Google Scholar). The predominant form of biglycan from the secretions of rat and bovine smooth muscle cells was generated by hydrolysis between Ala16 and Leu17. However, an alternative rat propeptide sequence also began with Phe19, indicating that there might be either cell- and species-specific differences in the processing of the prepro peptide of biglycan or further degradation of the generated propeptide by aminopeptidases (39Marcum J.A. Thompson M.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 175: 706-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The functional consequences of these differences are not yet known. The present study yielded several additional results. First, the glycosaminoglycan-free biglycan core protein is transport-competent and becomes secreted as the fully N-glycosylated species. Its extracellular stability, however, may be decreased, considering the finding that the conformational stability of biglycan depends to a greater extent than in the case of decorin on the presence of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chains (40Krishnan P. Hocking A.M. Scholtz J.M. Pace C.N. Holik K.K. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10945-10950Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Second, as expressed in 293 and CHO cells, biglycan may be substituted with a single heparan sulfate chain, thereby representing a hybrid proteoglycan. Recombinant biglycan synthesized by HT-1080 cells also appears as a hybrid species because its glycosaminoglycan chains cannot completely be removed by chondroitin ABC lyase (41Hocking A.M. Strugnell R.A. Ramamurthy P. McQuillan D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 19571-19577Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The factors that govern the substitution with either two galactosaminoglycans or a single galactosaminoglycan and an additional glucosaminoglycan chain and their possible cell type specificity have not yet been defined. Some experimental variability was also noted in the present investigation. Third, sulfation of asparagine-bound oligosaccharides of a chondroitin/dermatan sulfate proteoglycan was shown for the first time. This sulfate substitution may have escaped detection in previous studies because of its low relative amount. The functional significance and the detailed structure of the sulfated oligosaccharides remain to be determined. The expert technical help of Barbara Liel is gratefully acknowledged.

In this work, the role of the PH domain in subsequent signaling was studied by constructing constitutively active forms of IRS-1 in which the inter-SH2 domain of the p85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase was fused to portions of the IRS-1 molecule. Chimeric molecules containing the PH domain were found to activate the downstream response of stimulating the Ser/Thr kinase Akt. A chimera containing point mutations in the PH domain that abolished the ability of this domain to bind phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate prevented these molecules from activating Akt. These mutations also decreased by about 70% the amount of the constructs present in a particulate fraction of the cells. These results indicate that the PH domain of IRS-1, in addition to directing this protein to the receptor for tyrosine phosphorylation, functions in the ability of this molecule to stimulate subsequent responses. Thus, compromising the function of the PH domain, e.g. in insulin-resistant states, could decrease both the ability of IRS-1 to be tyrosine phosphorylated by the insulin receptor and to link to subsequent downstream targets.

Binding of these tyrosine phosphorylated substrates to the Src homology (SH) domain-2 of the regulatory subunit of the heterodimeric p85/p110 phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase leads to a 3–5-fold stimulation in its enzymatic activity and an increase in the PI 3,4-bisphosphate and 3,4,5-trisphosphate in the cell (3Myers Jr., M.G.

PH domains are often involved in the attachment of proteins to membranes, either by directly binding to phospholipids and/or by protein-protein interactions with, for example, the βγ subunits of the heterotrimeric G proteins (8Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the PH domain of IRS-1, both phospholipid binding as well as protein binding have been reported (9Takeuchi H. Matsuda M. Yamamoto T. Kanematsu T. Kikkawa U. Yagisawa H. Watanabe Y.

Although the binding specificities of these two regions is quite distinct, they share a similar overall structure, with each containing a β-sandwich formed by two nearly orthogonal antiparallel β-sheets of 4 and 3 strands, respectively. In recent studies, the crystal structure of the region of IRS-1 containing both the PH and PTB domains has been determined (14Dhe-Paganon S. Ottinger E.A. Nolte R.T. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8378-8383Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the two binding domains may act cooperatively to localize IRS-1 at the membrane in association with the receptor and thereby allow multiple tyrosine phosphorylations of IRS-1.A variety of experimental approaches have also been utilized to test the role of the PH and PTB domains of the IRS proteins in their interactions with the IR and the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylations. Mutant IRS molecules in which either the PH or PTB domain have been deleted or replaced with homologous structures of other proteins have been expressed in mammalian cells (15Paz K. Voliovitch H.

These studies have documented a primary role for the PH domain in the subsequent ability of IRS-1 to be tyrosine phosphorylated in intact cells after insulin stimulation. In either in vitro studies or yeast two-hybrid systems, a primary role of the IRS-1 PTB domain has been documented in receptor interactions (15Paz K. Voliovitch H. Hadari Y.R. Roberts Jr., C.T.

Biol. 1995; 15: 2500-2508Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). In the case of IRS-2, a more central region of the molecule has also been identified as playing a role in receptor interactions (20Sawka-Verhelle D. Tartare-Deckert S. White M.F. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5980-5983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 21He W. Craparo A. Zhu Y. O'Neill T.J. Wang L.M. Pierce J.H. Gustafson T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11641-11645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).Although numerous studies have documented the roles of the PH and PTB domains of the IRS proteins in the interactions with the IR and the subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of the IRS proteins, no studies have tested the roles of these two domains on subsequent signals induced by the IRS·PI 3-kinase complex. Because mutations in the PH and PTB domains interfere with the interaction of the IRS with the IR and its subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation, it is impossible to determine the effect of these mutations on the downstream signals emanating from the IRS·PI 3-kinase complex. To overcome this obstacle, we now describe a constitutively active form of IRS-1. In this chimeric molecule, the inter-SH2 domain of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase is attached to various portions of the IRS-1 molecule. The inter-SH2 domain of p85 has previously been documented to bind to the 110-kDa catalytic unit of the PI 3-kinase (22Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Hu Q. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5560-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Thus the resultant chimeric IRS-1 molecules now constitutively bind to the PI 3-kinase. By using these chimeric molecules, we have tested the role of different regions of the IRS-1 molecule in eliciting a subsequent biological response, the stimulation of the Ser/Thr kinase Akt. We demonstrate that the PH domain alone is sufficient to target the constitutively active PI 3-kinase to induce the activation of Akt and that this requires the lipid binding properties of the PH domain.DISCUSSIONThe principal mechanism whereby the insulin receptor activates PI 3-kinase appears to be via its ability to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of various endogenous proteins including the different IRS molecules, IRS-1 to 4 (1White M.F. Yenush L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 179-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Activation of PI 3-kinase plays a critical role in subsequent biological responses, such as stimulation of glucose uptake and regulation of gene transcription (5Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar, 6Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). A number of downstream targets of the PI 3-kinase and the lipids it generates have been identified. These include several Ser/Thr kinases such as the PDK-1, the family of Akt/PKB kinases, and several atypical protein kinase C including PKC ζ and λ. The exact role of these different kinases in eliciting subsequent biological responses has been debated (5Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar, 6Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar).Extensive studies have investigated the mechanism whereby the IRS proteins are localized to the insulin receptor. All four IRS molecules contain both a PH domain and a PTB domain (1White M.F. Yenush L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 179-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). The PH domain binds various phospholipids, including PI 4,5-P2 as well PI 3,4,5-P3 (9Takeuchi H. Matsuda M. Yamamoto T. Kanematsu T. Kikkawa U. Yagisawa H. Watanabe Y. Hirata M. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 211-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 10Razzini G. Ingrosso A. Brancaccio A. Sciacchitano S. Esposito D.L. Falasca M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 823-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In addition some studies have suggested that the PH domain may also interact with various proteins (11Burks D.J. Wang J. Towery H. Ishibashi O. Lowe D. Riedel H. White M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31061-31067Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast, the PTB domains bind phosphotyrosines, in particular, a phosphotyrosine in the juxtamembrane region of the insulin receptor (12Margolis B. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1996; 128: 235-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 13Wolf G. Trub T. Ottinger E. Groninga L. Lynch A. White M.F. Miyazaki M. Lee J. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27407-27410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure of the PH and PTB domains of the IRS-1 molecule, a model has been proposed of the two domains binding cooperatively to localize IRS-1 at the membrane in association with the insulin receptor (14Dhe-Paganon S. Ottinger E.A. Nolte R.T. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8378-8383Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).In the present studies, we have tested the role of these two domains in the ability of the IRS-1 molecule to elicit a subsequent biological response, the activation of the Ser/Thr kinase Akt. To accomplish this, we produced novel chimeric molecules, which contain these two domains fused to the inter-SH2 domain of the p85 subunit of the PI 3-kinase. This peptide has previously been shown to be sufficient to bind and activate the PI 3-kinase (22Klippel A. Escobedo J.A. Hu Q. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 5560-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). By adding these residues to the different domains of the IRS-1 molecule, we were able to produce chimeric molecules, which were constitutively bound to active PI 3-kinase. This was necessary because prior studies have shown that the PH domain of the IRS-1 molecule was critical for its subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation and association with the PI 3-kinase. By adding the inter-SH2 domain to the different domains of the IRS-1 molecule, we were able to produce chimeric molecules that were active in the absence of insulin stimulation and receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation.In the present work we have shown that the PH domain is critical for the subsequent ability of these constitutively active chimeric molecules to activate Akt. The most convincing data for this conclusion comes from the studies of the point mutants of the PH-PTB domain chimeric molecule. The wild type and mutants were expressed to comparable levels and had almost identical associated PI 3-kinase activities. However, the wild type activated the endogenous Akt whereas both the single and triple PH domain mutants had a dramatically decreased ability to activate the enzymatic activities of the endogenous Akt (i.e. the introduction of either a single mutation or 3 mutations in the PH domain caused an approximate 75% decrease in the ability of the PH-PTB construct to activate Akt). Both mutations also had a similar decreased ability to bind to PI 4,5-P2 in comparison to the wild-type protein when they were expressed as PH-PTB·GST fusion proteins. The simplest interpretation of these data are that the PH domain function (i.e. binding to PI 4,5-P2 or a negatively charged protein) is critical to elicit the downstream functions. This conclusion is also supported by the finding that a chimeric molecule with only the PH domain of IRS-1 was also capable of stimulating the activation of the endogenous Akt. The somewhat weaker activity of this chimera in comparison to the PH-PTB molecule is consistent with its lower expression and somewhat decreased amount of associated PI 3-kinase activity. Because the construct, which only contained the PTB domain was expressed at lower levels and therefore had lower associated PI 3-kinase activity, it is not possible to conclude from this construct alone whether the PTB domain alone would have been capable at higher levels to induce the activation of Akt. However, the finding that the PH-PTB domain chimeric molecules whose PH domain function were impaired by either single or triple point mutations were incapable of eliciting the activation of the Akt argue that the PTB domain alone would not be sufficient to elicit this response because the PTB domain function in these chimeric molecules is still intact.A potential role of the PH domain of IRS-1 is to help localize the protein in the correct intracellular compartment. To test this hypothesis, we examined the subcellular localization of the wild-type and two mutant chimeric molecules by biochemical fractionation of the cells. The wild-type PH-PTB chimeric molecule was found to be in the particulate fraction to a much greater degree then the chimeric molecules containing the mutations in the PH domain. These results are consistent with the recent report that the IRS-1 molecule is at least partially present in a particulate fraction of the cell, possibly because of its association with the cytoskeletal complex (29Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) as well as with a recent report that the same mutant we have studied (R28C) blocks the insulin induced translocation of a IRS·GFP construct to the membrane (10Razzini G. Ingrosso A. Brancaccio A. Sciacchitano S. Esposito D.L. Falasca M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 823-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, the PH domain may serve to localize the chimeric molecules in the subcellular localization required for the subsequent activation of Akt.In conclusion, the present work presents the first evidence that a functional PH domain of the IRS-1 molecule is required for its ability to signal to downstream molecules such as activation of Akt. This requirement is presumably because of the ability of the PH domain of IRS-1 to direct the PI 3-kinase to the correct subcellular compartment. Compromising the function of the PH domain, for example in insulin-resistant states, could therefore both decrease the ability of IRS-1 to be tyrosine phosphorylated by the insulin receptor as well as to link to subsequent downstream targets (2Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). After insulin binds to its receptor, it activates an intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, which mediates the tyrosine phosphorylation of a variety of endogenous substrates including insulin receptor substrates (IRS)1 1–4 (1White M.F. Yenush L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 179-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,2Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Binding of these tyrosine phosphorylated substrates to the Src homology (SH) domain-2 of the regulatory subunit of the heterodimeric p85/p110 phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase leads to a 3–5-fold stimulation in its enzymatic activity and an increase in the PI 3,4-bisphosphate and 3,4,5-trisphosphate in the cell (3Myers Jr., M.G. Backer J.M. Sun X.J. Shoelson S. Hu P. Schlessinger J. Yoakim M. Schaffhausen B. White M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1990; 87: 1411-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). As a result of the increase in these lipids, there is a pronounced stimulation in the enzymatic activity of the Ser/Thr kinases called Akt, and a more modest increase in the enzymatic activity of particular isoforms of protein kinase C, which ultimately lead to numerous biological responses (5Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar, 6Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). The IRS 1–4 all contain an amino-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain next to a phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain (1White M.F. Yenush L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 179-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The PH domain is homologous to a region in pleckstrin and has been found in over 120 proteins including serine/threonine kinases, tyrosine kinases, phospholipases, GTPase-activating proteins, GTPases, and cytoskeletal proteins (7Shaw G.

Activation of PI 3-kinase plays a critical role in subsequent biological responses, such as stimulation of glucose uptake and regulation of gene transcription (5Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem.

A number of downstream targets of the PI 3-kinase and the lipids it generates have been identified.

The exact role of these different kinases in eliciting subsequent biological responses has been debated (5Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem.

Biol. 1993; 13: 5560-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). By adding these residues to the different domains of the IRS-1 molecule, we were able to produce chimeric molecules, which were constitutively bound to active PI 3-kinase. This was necessary because prior studies have shown that the PH domain of the IRS-1 molecule was critical for its subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation and association with the PI 3-kinase. By adding the inter-SH2 domain to the different domains of the IRS-1 molecule, we were able to produce chimeric molecules that were active in the absence of insulin stimulation and receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation.In the present work we have shown that the PH domain is critical for the subsequent ability of these constitutively active chimeric molecules to activate Akt. The most convincing data for this conclusion comes from the studies of the point mutants of the PH-PTB domain chimeric molecule. The wild type and mutants were expressed to comparable levels and had almost identical associated PI 3-kinase activities. However, the wild type activated the endogenous Akt whereas both the single and triple PH domain mutants had a dramatically decreased ability to activate the enzymatic activities of the endogenous Akt (i.e. the introduction of either a single mutation or 3 mutations in the PH domain caused an approximate 75% decrease in the ability of the PH-PTB construct to activate Akt). Both mutations also had a similar decreased ability to bind to PI 4,5-P2 in comparison to the wild-type protein when they were expressed as PH-PTB·GST fusion proteins. The simplest interpretation of these data are that the PH domain function (i.e. binding to PI 4,5-P2 or a negatively charged protein) is critical to elicit the downstream functions. This conclusion is also supported by the finding that a chimeric molecule with only the PH domain of IRS-1 was also capable of stimulating the activation of the endogenous Akt. The somewhat weaker activity of this chimera in comparison to the PH-PTB molecule is consistent with its lower expression and somewhat decreased amount of associated PI 3-kinase activity. Because the construct, which only contained the PTB domain was expressed at lower levels and therefore had lower associated PI 3-kinase activity, it is not possible to conclude from this construct alone whether the PTB domain alone would have been capable at higher levels to induce the activation of Akt. However, the finding that the PH-PTB domain chimeric molecules whose PH domain function were impaired by either single or triple point mutations were incapable of eliciting the activation of the Akt argue that the PTB domain alone would not be sufficient to elicit this response because the PTB domain function in these chimeric molecules is still intact.A potential role of the PH domain of IRS-1 is to help localize the protein in the correct intracellular compartment. To test this hypothesis, we examined the subcellular localization of the wild-type and two mutant chimeric molecules by biochemical fractionation of the cells. The wild-type PH-PTB chimeric molecule was found to be in the particulate fraction to a much greater degree then the chimeric molecules containing the mutations in the PH domain. These results are consistent with the recent report that the IRS-1 molecule is at least partially present in a particulate fraction of the cell, possibly because of its association with the cytoskeletal complex (29Clark S.F. Martin S. Carozzi A.J. Hill M.M. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1211-1225Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) as well as with a recent report that the same mutant we have studied (R28C) blocks the insulin induced translocation of a IRS·GFP construct to the membrane (10Razzini G. Ingrosso A. Brancaccio A. Sciacchitano S. Esposito D.L. Falasca M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 823-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, the PH domain may serve to localize the chimeric molecules in the subcellular localization required for the subsequent activation of Akt.In conclusion, the present work presents the first evidence that a functional PH domain of the IRS-1 molecule is required for its ability to signal to downstream molecules such as activation of Akt. This requirement is presumably because of the ability of the PH domain of IRS-1 to direct the PI 3-kinase to the correct subcellular compartment. Compromising the function of the PH domain, for example in insulin-resistant states, could therefore both decrease the ability of IRS-1 to be tyrosine phosphorylated by the insulin receptor as well as to link to subsequent downstream targets (2Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). The principal mechanism whereby the insulin receptor activates PI 3-kinase appears to be via its ability to stimulate the tyrosine phosphorylation of various endogenous proteins including the different IRS molecules, IRS-1 to 4 (1White M.F. Yenush L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 179-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Activation of PI 3-kinase plays a critical role in subsequent biological responses, such as stimulation of glucose uptake and regulation of gene transcription (5Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar, 6Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). A number of downstream targets of the PI 3-kinase and the lipids it generates have been identified. These include several Ser/Thr kinases such as the PDK-1, the family of Akt/PKB kinases, and several atypical protein kinase C including PKC ζ and λ. The exact role of these different kinases in eliciting subsequent biological responses has been debated (5Vanhaesebroeck B. Alessi D.R. Biochem. J. 2000; 346: 561-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar, 6Shepherd P.R. Withers D.J. Siddle K. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 471-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). Extensive studies have investigated the mechanism whereby the IRS proteins are localized to the insulin receptor. All four IRS molecules contain both a PH domain and a PTB domain (1White M.F. Yenush L. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1998; 228: 179-208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Pessin J.E. Saltiel A.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). The PH domain binds various phospholipids, including PI 4,5-P2 as well PI 3,4,5-P3 (9Takeuchi H. Matsuda M. Yamamoto T. Kanematsu T. Kikkawa U. Yagisawa H. Watanabe Y. Hirata M. Biochem.

In contrast, the PTB domains bind phosphotyrosines, in particular, a phosphotyrosine in the juxtamembrane region of the insulin receptor (12Margolis B. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1996; 128: 235-241Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 13Wolf G. Trub T. Ottinger E. Groninga L. Lynch A. White M.F. Miyazaki M. Lee J. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27407-27410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Based on the crystal structure of the PH and PTB domains of the IRS-1 molecule, a model has been proposed of the two domains binding cooperatively to localize IRS-1 at the membrane in association with the insulin receptor (14Dhe-Paganon S. Ottinger E.A. Nolte R.T. Eck M.J. Shoelson S.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8378-8383Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In the present studies, we have tested the role of these two domains in the ability of the IRS-1 molecule to elicit a subsequent biological response, the activation of the Ser/Thr kinase Akt. To accomplish this, we produced novel chimeric molecules, which contain these two domains fused to the inter-SH2 domain of the p85 subunit of the PI 3-kinase.

https://openalex.org/W2087737747,"The steroid hormone, estradiol, is essential for both the growth of normal breast and induction of mammary carcinomas. The growth promoting effects of estrogen are presumed to be mediated by growth factors, in particular, epidermal growth factor, which mediates its effects through erbB receptors, erbB1 and erbB2/C-neu. C-neu is amplified and over-expressed in a large number of human cancers and transgenic mice over-expressing C-neu also develop mammary tumors. However, as yet, the impact of C-neu over-expression on estrogen action during normal mammary development and hence, its precise role in carcinogenesis, remains unclear. In the present studies, we demonstrate that estradiol-dependent mammary ductal growth accompanying puberty is impaired in transgenic mice expressing wild type Cneu, and is intrinsic to the tissue. The impairment is not due to an overall impairment in estrogen action, since progesterone receptor expression is unaffected in C-neu mice. It is also not due to an intrinsic inability of the epithelial cells to proliferate, since impeded ductal growth co-exists with alveolar growth during pregnancy. Therefore, we propose that, depending on the physiological state, C-neu may either promote or inhibit the growth of mammary epithelial cells, and discuss its potential significance to carcinogenesis."

Chem.273, 7148–7154), we showed that overlapping peptides, N20K (Asn564–Lys583) and E20K (Glu574–Lys593), from the catalytic domain of phospholipase C (PLC) β2 block Gβγ-dependent activation of PLC β2. The peptides could also be directly cross-linked to βγ subunits with a heterobifunctional cross-linker succinimidyl 4-[N-maleimidomethyl]-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate. Cross-linking of peptides to Gβ1 was inhibited by PLC β2 but not by αi1(GDP), indicating that the peptide-binding site on β1 represents a binding site for PLC β2 that does not overlap with the αi1-binding site. Here we identify the site of peptide cross-linking and thereby define a site for PLC β2 interaction with β subunits. Each of the 14 cysteine residues in β1 were altered to alanine. The ability of the PLC β2-derived peptide to cross-link to each βγ mutant was then analyzed to identify the reactive sulfhydryl moiety on the β subunit required for the cross-linking reaction. We find that C25A was the only mutation that significantly affected peptide cross-linking. This indicates that the peptide is specifically binding to a region near cysteine 25 of β1 which is located in the amino-terminal coiled-coil region of β1 and identifies a PLC-binding site distinct from the α subunit interaction site. In previous work (Sankaran, B., Osterhout, J., Wu, D., and Smrcka, A. V. (1998) J. Biol.

GTP-binding protein phospholipase C succinimidyl 4-[N-maleimidomethyl]-cyclohexane-1-carboxylate polyvinylidene difluoride polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis horseradish peroxidase Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins)1 are a large group of structurally similar proteins consisting of three subunits (α, β, and γ) that are central molecules coupling seven-transmembrane domain-spanning receptors to downstream effector molecules. Activation of G proteins begins with a ligand-induced conformational change of the receptor which catalyzes the release of GDP from the α subunit in exchange for GTP (1Hamm H.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 669-672Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar, 2Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 615-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (4669) Google Scholar). In the GDP-bound heterotrimeric state, α(GDP)·βγ, neither α(GDP) nor βγ can regulate effector activity. Upon receptor-catalyzed G protein activation, the heterotrimer dissociates into free α(GTP) and free βγ subunits. It is well understood that both α(GTP) and βγ subunits can interact with a variety of downstream effector molecules including enzymes and ion channels. GTP is hydrolyzed to GDP, and reassociation of α(GDP) with βγ results in deactivation of βγ-dependent signaling. Despite detailed knowledge of α- and βγ subunit functions, the mechanism for how βγ subunits activate its variety of effectors is not entirely understood. Effector-binding sites on the surface of βγ are beginning to be mapped. The putative competition between α(GDP) and effectors for βγ forms the premise for recent studies to map effector-binding sites at the α subunit-binding interface on β. The three-dimensional structure of the G protein heterotrimer reveals that the β subunit is a β-propeller with seven “blades” and an amino-terminal α-helix (3Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A.

Cell. 1995; 83: 1047-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). The α subunit binds to a portion of the top of the β-propeller and along side one of the blades of the propeller. Two groups have shown that alanine substitution of α-contacting residues on the top surface of the β-propeller differentially affected the ability of βγ to regulate various target molecules (5Ford C.E.

One of these groups tested whether the sides of the β-propeller may be important for effector interactions. Residues along the outer strand of each of the 7 blades of the β-propeller were altered, and each βγ mutant was tested for its ability to stimulate phospholipase C (PLC) β2 and regulate adenylyl cyclases (7Panchenko M.P. Saxena K. Li Y. Charnecki S. Sternweis P.M. Smith T.F. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28298-28304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Mutations in three of the blades eliminated the ability of βγ to activate PLC β2, whereas these same mutations did not affect regulation of adenylyl cyclase isoforms 1 and 2. Consistent with these studies, synthetic peptides from discrete blade regions of β were used in competition experiments to define a region located near the interface between α and βγ as being important for activation of PLC β2 (8Buck E. Li J. Chen Y. Weng G. Scarlata S. Iyengar R. Science. 1999; 283: 1332-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A screen for dominant-negative yeast Gβ mutants that could interfere with mating factor signaling identified different regions involved in β subunit-effector interactions (9Leberer E. Dignard D. Hougan L. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4805-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In particular, one set of mutations maps to an amino-terminal region involved in a coiled-coil interaction with γ subunits on the opposite side of the β subunit from the α subunit-binding site. Taken together, these studies show that the top surface of β, where many α-contact points are located, is a region critical for effector binding and regulation. However, effector-binding sites are being mapped to a variety of regions on the surface of βγ. Multiple interaction regions are reported even for the same effector. It has been suggested that distinct sets of contacts may define the specificity of the interaction of βγ with various effectors (i.e. each effector will have a characteristic footprint along the sides of the molecule). In previous work (10Sankaran B. Osterhout J. Wu D. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7148-7154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) we showed that overlapping peptides, N20K (Asn564–Lys583) and E20K (Glu574–Lys593) from the catalytic domain of phospholipase C (PLC) β2, block PLC activation by βγ and could be directly cross-linked to β subunits with a heterobifunctional cross-linker (SMCC). In the study presented here we have identified the site of cross-linking of N20K to the β subunit thereby defining a binding site for PLC β2. This approach identified a site distinct from those mapped by site-directed mutagenesis but consistent with the region identified in yeast β subunits as being important for β subunit-effector interactions (9Leberer E.

Baculovirus constructs directing expression of recombinant His6 PLC β2 were used to infect 800 ml of Sf9 cells at a density of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml. PLC β2 was purified according to published procedures (12Romoser V. Ball R. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25071-25078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). For purification of wild type β1γ2, baculovirus constructs encoding β1, γ2, and His6-tagged αi1 were obtained from Alfred Gilman's laboratory. 800 ml of Sf9 cells at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml were simultaneously infected with the three constructs, and the βγ subunits were purified according to published procedures (13Kozasa T.

The protein was concentrated on a 0.3-ml macro-prep ceramic hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad) column and eluted into βγ vehicle (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1% octyl glucoside, 200 mmpotassium phosphate, pH 8.0). For purification of β1γ2-cysteine (C) mutants, 200 ml of Sf9 cells at 2.5 × 106cells/ml were simultaneously infected with baculovirus constructs encoding each β1-cysteine mutant, γ2, and His6-tagged αi1. Each βγ-cysteine mutant was purified according to the above procedures but modified to batch style with 0.5 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic-agarose. Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated on a 0.3-ml hydroxyapatite column, and protein was eluted into βγ vehicle. For purification of endogenous Sf9 β, 1 liter of Sf9 cells at 2.5 × 106 cells/ml was simultaneously infected with baculovirus constructs encoding His6-tagged αi1 and γ2. Sf9 βγ subunits were purified according to the procedures for the purification of wild type βγ as described above. Recombinant myristoylated αi1 and αo were purified fromEscherichia coli coexpressing αi1 or αo with N-myristoyltransferase according to published procedures (14Mumby S.M. Linder M.E. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 237: 254-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) with some modification. Briefly, αi1 or αo were expressed in 1 liter ofE. coli containing the N-myristoyltransferase plasmid for 16 h. After preparation of the lysate, the protein was applied to a 50-ml column of Q Sepharose fast flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) that had been equilibrated with 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μm GDP. The column was washed with 150 ml of equilibration buffer followed by elution of the protein with a 400-ml linear gradient to 250 mm NaCl in equilibration buffer. Fractions containing α subunits were further purified by fast protein liquid chromatography phenyl-Superose chromatography resulting in two peaks of α subunits eluting from the column. The second peak corresponding to myristoylated α subunit was pooled and concentrated; 50 μm GDP was added, frozen in aliquots in liquid N2, and stored at −80 °C. Functionality of the α subunits was confirmed by the ability to be ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin and the ability to inhibit βγ-mediated activation of PLC β2. We used two different cross-linking protocols in this study. Protocol 1, used for the experiments described in Figs. 1 and 7, has been described previously (10Sankaran B. Osterhout J. Wu D. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7148-7154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Here, βγ subunits at the indicated concentrations were mixed with N20K (NRSYVISSFTELKAYDLLSK) peptide followed by addition of SMCC to 200 μm from a 2 mm stock solution. The reaction was allowed to proceed for 5 min. For protocol 2, N20K was reacted with SMCC for 10 min followed by addition of 500 mmethanolamine, pH 7.3, to inactivate the unreacted succinimide moiety. βγ subunits were then added, and the reaction was allowed to proceed at room temperature for 1.5 min. For both protocols reactions were quenched with SDS sample buffer (32 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 5% glycerol, 1% SDS, 350 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, bromphenol blue (final concentrations)), resolved on SDS-PAGE, and transferred overnight onto a PVDF membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For some experiments (as indicated) cross-linked species were detected with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated NeutrAvidin (Pierce). In other experiments cross-linked β subunits were detected with the carboxyl-terminal anti-β subunit antibody B600 and/or amino-terminal specific β subunit antibody followed by secondary antibody linked to HRP and development with Amersham Pharmacia Biotech chemiluminescence reagents.Figure 7Cross-linking of peptide to trypsin-digested wild type and cysteine mutant β1γ2dimers.

The digestion was stopped by addition of 62.5 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Digested βγ (80 nm), 100 μm N20K, and cross-linker were mixed as in cross-linking protocol 1 and analyzed by immunoblotting with an amino-terminal specific β subunit antibody. PLC assays were performed as described previously (12Romoser V. Ball R. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25071-25078Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified PLC β2 was mixed with sonicated phospholipid vesicles containing 50 μmphosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, 200 μmphosphatidylethanolamine, and [3H]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (6000–8000 cpm/assay), with or without 100 nmpurified β1γ2 or mutants and/or peptides. Reactions were allowed to proceed from 3 to 5 min at 30 °C. Intact lipids and proteins were precipitated with bovine serum albumin and 10% trichloroacetic acid and removed by centrifugation. Supernatant containing soluble [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate was analyzed by liquid scintillation counting. We have previously shown that two peptides derived from PLC β2 (N20K and E20K) are specifically and chemically cross-linked to both G protein β and γ subunits using a heterobifunctional cross-linking reagent (SMCC) (10Sankaran B. Osterhout J. Wu D. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7148-7154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). SMCC contains maleimide- and succinimide-reactive groups, which react with SH– and NH– moieties, respectively. Since the peptides have no cysteine residues, cross-linking must be through a primary amine on the peptide and a sulfhydryl group in the β subunit. The cross-linking reaction is equally effective if the amino terminus of the peptide is acetylated indicating that one of the two lysine residues within the N20K peptide sequence is involved in the reaction. Previous data suggest that cross-linking of N20K to βγ subunits could be blocked by PLC β2 but not α(GDP). To analyze this in greater detail, the concentrations of α subunits and PLC β2 required to inhibit N20K cross-linking to the β subunit were examined (Fig. 1). Cross-linking of β subunit to the peptide is indicated by the increase in apparent molecular weight of the immunoreactive β subunit after incubation with peptide and SMCC. The uppermost band is β cross-linked to γ (this band reacts with γ subunit antibodies (not shown)); the bottom band is uncross-linked β, and the two bands in between are β cross-linked to the peptide. There is one prominent peptide cross-linked species and a second minor peptide cross-linked species. PLC β2 (90 nm) significantly inhibited cross-linking of 10 μm peptide (N20K) to 30 nm βγ and completely inhibited the cross-linking at 150 nm PLC β2. This concentration dependence is consistent with the EC50of ∼50–100 nm for PLC activation by βγ subunits (15Smrcka A.V. Sternweis P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9667-9674Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand αi1(GDP) did not inhibit cross-linking of the peptide up to 250 nm. This same preparation of α subunit was able to block βγ-mediated activation of PLC β2 by 95% at a 2:1 ratio of α to βγ (not shown). These results indicate that the peptide and α subunit-binding sites on βγ are distinct and that the peptide-binding site is within the binding site for PLC β2 on βγ. As discussed, α subunits have been suggested to inhibit βγ subunit-mediated PLC β2 activation by competing for binding of the PLC β2 to the βγ subunits. To test whether α(GDP) inhibits the binding of PLC β2 to βγ subunits, we tested whether excess αo(GDP) (250 nm) altered the ability of PLC β2 to block peptide cross-linking to βγ (Fig. 2). For this experiment the cross-linking protocol was modified to eliminate intermolecular β cross-linking to γ and reduce the number of cross-linked species (see “Experimental Procedures” cross-linking protocol 2 and the figure legend). Although PLC β2 did not completely inhibit peptide cross-linking to β subunits in the absence of αo in this experiment (compared with Fig. 1), cross-linking was still significantly inhibited when PLC β2 was added. In the presence of the α subunit, PLC β2 also inhibited cross-linking, but a higher concentration of PLC was required to observe the inhibition. Similar results were observed with αi(GDP). This suggests that PLC β2 can bind to β subunits at the peptide interaction site even in the presence of α subunits, but α subunits may alter the affinity of PLC for βγ. To identify the location of peptide cross-linking and thus map a region for PLC β2 binding that does not coincide with α subunit binding, we used a sulfhydryl mutagenesis strategy similar to that designed by Garcia-Higuera et al. (11Garcia-Higuera I. Thomas T.C. Yi F. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 528-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Since cross-linking can only occur between a cysteine residue from β and lysine from the peptide, we characterized cross-linking of the peptide to a series of β subunit mutants where each cysteine residue had been individually mutated to alanine. We obtained the β1-cysteine mutant cDNAs from Dr. Eva J. Neer and created baculovirus constructs for expression and purification of each cysteine mutant from Sf9 insect cells. Fig.3 A displays a Coomassie-stained panel of 11 of the 14 purified β1γ2-cysteine mutants. The numbers indicate the positions of the cysteine residue in the β1 primary sequence. The Cys166, Cys149, and Cys317 proteins are not shown but are of similar purity. β1 Cys103, Cys114, Cys121, Cys148, and Cys271 are doublets in which the top band of each doublet is Sf9 β that copurifies. It will be shown in later experiments that Sf9 β does not cross-link to N20K, and therefore, any cross-linking that is observed must be to the expressed mutant β subunit. The concentration of each β1-cysteine mutant was estimated by immunoblot analysis because the preparations contained Sf9 β, and we wanted to base the analysis on equal amounts of the expressed β mutants. The concentration of each β1-cysteine mutant (lower band in the case of doublets) was estimated by comparing the band intensities to a range of intensities produced by known amounts of wild type β1 protein (an example of such an estimation for Cys114 is shown in Fig. 3 B). Each of the mutants was able to bind to His-tagged αi and elute with addition of a G protein activator (AlF4−), suggesting that they were properly folded and active. To be sure that the mutants were able to activate phospholipase C, 13 of the 14 mutants were tested for their ability to activate phospholipase C β2 in an in vitrophospholipase C assay (Fig. 4). All of the mutants that were tested were able to activate PLC β2 between 3- and 5-fold compared with 7-fold for wild type β1γ2. Thus, while their efficacy is slightly diminished (by ∼½) relative to wild type β1γ2, in general these mutants are properly folded and capable of interacting with α subunits and PLC β2. It is not clear that why these mutants have a reduced ability to activate PLC β2, but we suspect that it is not a result of the mutations themselves but rather is a consequence of the difficulties in quantitating the mutants as well as repeated freezing and thawing of the samples. Regardless, this cannot be responsible for any differences observed in the cross-linking experiments since there is no correlation between the activities and the degree of cross-linking. For the survey of the ability of the peptide to cross-link to the mutants, we modified cross-linking protocol 2 (see “Experimental Procedures”) to use an amino-terminal biotin-modified form of the N20K peptide (B-N20K) which we could detect with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated avidin (HRP-NeutrAvidin from Pierce). With this modified peptide our procedure for monitoring cross-linking to βγ subunits allows only the peptide cross-linked species of β to be detected. To confirm that the biotin modification did not affect the activity of the peptide, we tested whether the B-N20K would block PLC activation by βγ. Consistent with our previous report (10Sankaran B. Osterhout J. Wu D. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7148-7154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), B-N20K inhibited βγ-stimulated PLC activity with an IC50 of ∼50 μm with 88% inhibition of activity occurring at 100 μm (Fig. 5 A). B-N20K was cross-linked to wild type β1γ2and immunoblotted with β subunit antibodies to confirm that this peptide behaved like unmodified N20K in the cross-linking reaction (Fig. 5 B). A shift to higher molecular weight was observed as has been seen for unmodified N20K. One major cross-linked species was observed, and one very minor species appeared with longer reaction times, confirming that the procedure could be used to monitor specific reaction of the peptide with the β subunit at a single site. We went on to determine whether we could detect the cross-linked B-N20K cross-linked to β using HRP-NeutrAvidin. This method detected only one cross-linked species at a molecular weight corresponding to the cross-linked species detected with β subunit-specific antibody (Fig.5 C, indicated by the arrow on theright). Consistent with our previous report (10Sankaran B. Osterhout J. Wu D. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7148-7154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), PLC β2 inhibits cross-linking of B-N20K peptide to β1, further demonstrating that the biotin modification does not affect the binding properties of the peptide and that the site of peptide cross-linking represents a binding site for PLC β2 on βγ subunits. Fig.6 A displays the results of a comprehensive cross-linking screen of B-N20K to wild type β1γ2 and all 14 cysteine mutants. Only the cysteine 25 alteration eliminated peptide cross-linking, whereas the remaining 13 cysteine mutations did not significantly affect peptide cross-linking to β1, indicating that the major peptide cross-linking site is cysteine 25 of β1. Whereas the other mutations may have had a minor effect on cross-linking, it is difficult to make conclusions as to their significance with this method since it is not strictly quantitative. Clearly, however, in multiply repeated experiments the only mutation that consistently resulted in a clearly significant reduction in cross-linking of the peptide was Cys25. As discussed, Cys103, Cys114, Cys121, Cys148, and Cys271 show double bands with the upper band corresponding to Sf9 β that copurifies with the mutant β subunit (Fig. 3). We purified Sf9 β (see under “Experimental Procedures”) to determine whether the peptide cross-links to this β subunit. We were unable to detect cross-linking of B-N20K to Sf9 β subunit (Fig. 6 B). This indicates that it is not Sf9 β contamination of the preparation that is responsible for the cross-linking observed with any of the cysteine mutants. To confirm further that peptide cross-linking to the Cys25 mutant is eliminated, we performed trypsin cleavage to isolate the amino-terminal fragment of β1 where cysteine 25 is located and assayed for a shift in the molecular weight of this fragment in the presence or absence of N20K (not biotinylated) and cross-linker. In the native state only one of the 32 potential trypsin cleavage sites in β1(arginine at position 129) is accessible to trypsin. Thus trypsin cleavage of the native βγ complex produces two fragments of 14- and 24-kDa (amino and carboxyl termini, respectively) (16Thomas T.C. Sladek T. Yi F. Smith T. Neer E.J. Biochemistry. 1992; 32: 8628-8635Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Fig.7 shows immunoblots from a cross-linking experiment of trypsin-digested wild type and cysteine mutant β1γ2 complexes in the presence and absence of N20K, detected with an amino-terminal specific anti-β1antibody. The cross-linking reaction resulted in appearance of an immunoreactive species at ∼17 kDa (top arrow), only in the presence of peptide, for wild type β1γ2, Cys103, and Cys114. The apparent molecular weight of the cross-linked band corresponds to what would be expected if one peptide of ∼2.5 kDa is covalently attached to the amino-terminal fragment of 14 kDa. No cross-linking to the amino-terminal fragment was observed for Cys25 confirming that Cys25 is a site of N20K cross-linking. Studies to determine effector-binding sites on βγ suggest that effectors bind to various regions along the βγ surface and that each effector will have its own characteristic set of contact points or footprints along the sides of the βγ complex. These contact points may serve to define the specificity of interactions between βγ and its effectors. All of the mapping studies to define these footprints are based on measurement of βγ-mediated stimulation of effector activity to monitor the effects of site-directed mutation within the β subunit at sites predicted to be important for effector binding (5Ford C.E.

Here, we take an alternative approach that does not require prediction of the binding site but rather directly assesses the location of a specific cross-linking site. Although we used site-directed mutagenesis, the mutations in the β1subunit were not intended and did not disrupt the function of the βγ complex. Our mutations were used only as a tool to monitor direct protein-protein interactions while retaining the function of the protein. That the Cys25 βγ mutant stimulated PLC β2 activity and supported PTX-catalyzed αi subunit ADP-ribosylation similarly to wild type βγ indicates that the complex is likely to be properly folded and that the PLC interaction site is intact. This study clearly defines the Cys25 as a site of peptide cross-linking. Cysteine 25 is located in the βγ amino-terminal coiled-coil region (Fig. 8). The cross-linker SMCC can link the sulfhydryl groups on cysteine residues to ε-amino groups on lysine that are separated by a maximum of 11.6 Å (Pierce (17Means G.E. Feeney R.E. Bioconjugate Chem. 1990; 1: 2-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar)) (for perspective, the distance between Cys25 to Leu30 of 15 Å is shown in Fig. 8). This defines a surface area on the βγ complex with cysteine 25 situated in the center of 450 A2. The β subunit has approximate dimensions of 40 Å in diameter by 30 Å high. Given these dimensions, if the β subunit is modeled as a cylinder with a smooth surface, it would have a surface area of 6248 Å2. Thus we can restrict the area that can be reached by this cross-linker to less than 10% of the β subunit surface that includes part of the amino-terminal coiled coil as well as the sides of propeller blade 5 and possibly blade 4. Our previously published work (10Sankaran B. Osterhout J. Wu D. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7148-7154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) has shown that the region of the peptide involved in binding to the βγ subunits is within the carboxyl-terminal 10 amino acids (ELKAYDLLSK) of the peptide where the lysines that are involved in cross-linking are located. Thus the peptide-binding site must be within or very near to the area that can be reached by the cross-linker. Cross-linking of the peptide to cysteine 25 is not consistent with its binding to three previously identified PLC-binding sites, blades 2, 6, and 7. The closest of these three blades to Cys25 is blade 6. The most proximate amino acid to Cys25 on propeller blade 6 is 25 Å away. Given a lysine side chain length of 5 Å and the 11.6-Å cross-linker length, the peptide could not be binding to this region and cross-linking to cysteine 25. The closest amino acid on the surface of another putative PLC-binding region, blade 2, is 40 Å away if measured in a direct line from cysteine 25 through the protein. The distance along the surface of the protein is of course even greater. Thus the peptide cannot be binding to blade 2 and cross-link to cysteine 25. A similar argument can be made for blade 7, which is 50 Å away from Cys25. Given the length of the cross-linker the most reasonable sites for binding are the amino-terminal coiled-coil region and the sides of blade 5 or 4. We do not conclude that the results from our study and the results from site-directed mutagenesis are mutually exclusive. Given the size of PLC β2, it is possible that the enzyme can interact with multiple regions of the β subunit. Our study simply identifies an interaction site that was not implicated in other studies of mammalian β subunits. Supporting these ideas is the observation that none of the other cysteine mutations significantly affect cross-linking. In the cross-linking study by Garcia-Higuera et al. (11Garcia-Higuera I. Thomas T.C. Yi F. Neer E.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 528-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) that utilized this same approach to identify α subunit interaction sites, Cys204 and Cys271 were both found to be responsible for cross-linking of αo to β1by bismaleimidohexane (16-Å cross-linker). The mutation at cysteine 25 had no affect on α subunit cross-linking but did prevent cross-linking to γ2 in their study. Thus two highly accessible cysteine residues are present at the α subunit interaction interface, but apparently they are not the major site of cross-linking of the N20K peptide. In particular Cys271 is in the loop region connecting blades 5 and 6. If the peptide were binding to blade 6 one might expect this cysteine to be a cross-linking site. This also suggests that if the peptide were binding in the α subunit interaction region it would be detected. Within or near blade 2 of the β-propeller are cysteines 114, 121, 148, 149, and 166, none of which appear to be critical for cross-linking of the peptide. However, these amino acids may not be accessible to the cross-linker since they are mostly buried and not clearly accessible to solvent. The critical data supporting a binding site other than blades 2 and 6 is that a cross-linking site at Cys25 has been identified that is not within range of these regions. The lack of a major effect of mutation of cysteine residues that are within range of these regions supports this result and speaks to the specificity of the cross-linking of the peptide. This general location is in contrast with what has been found in some mutagenic studies but correlates well with an effector interaction domain identified in a screen for dominant negative yeast Gβ mutants (9Leberer E. Dignard D. Hougan L. Thomas D.Y. Whiteway M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4805-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Recent studies show that mutation of some of the residues in the amino terminus of yeast β subunits responsible for the dominant negative phenotype eliminates binding to Ste20p, the yeast homologue of mammalian PAK (18Leeuw T. Wu C. Schrag J.D. Whiteway M. Thomas D.Y. Leberer E. Nature. 1998; 391: 191-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Other mutants in the coiled-coil region of yeast β subunits (Leu65 and Leu49) are unable bind to the scaffolding protein Ste5p (19Dowell S.J. Bishop A.L. Dyos S.L. Brown A.J. Whiteway M.S. Genetics. 1998; 150: 1407-1417PubMed Google Scholar). These data strongly suggest that the amino-terminal coiled-coil region is important for effector binding in yeast. Evidence for involvement of this region in interactions of mammalian β subunits with effectors is lacking. One study (20Pellegrino S. Zhang S. Garritsen A. Simonds W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 25360-25366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (25) Google Scholar) of this region with a series of single point mutations found that some of the mutations had dramatic effects on assembly with γ subunits, whereas those mutants that did assemble had little effect on the ability of βγ subunits to activate JNK in a COS cell transfection assay. A possible explanation for this is that mammalian effectors may have contacts with other regions of the β subunit, and as such single point mutations in this region are not sufficient to disrupt effector interactions in overexpression assays. Our data support the idea that this region is important for binding of effectors to mammalian β subunits and that this interaction is important for regulation since binding of a peptide to this region blocks the ability of βγ to activate effectors. The amino-terminal coiled-coil region of the β subunit is far from the α-interacting region located at the top of the β subunit complex making contact with blades 2 and 7 of the propeller. This general location for peptide cross-linking is consistent with our previous finding that α subunit does not block cross-linking of peptide to βγ (10Sankaran B. Osterhout J. Wu D. Smrcka A.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7148-7154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and our data show that α(GDP) subunits do not completely prevent PLC from binding to β and thereby preventing cross-linking of peptide to β. This latter finding suggests that perhaps PLC could bind near the amino-terminal region of β even in the presence of the α subunit. This idea is supported by the results of another group (21Runnels L.W. Scarlata S.F. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15563-15574Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) who propose α(GDP) can bind to βγ·PLC β2 complex to form α(GDP)·βγ·PLC β2. Thus, the site we have mapped may represent a region where PLC can remain bound to βγ even in the presence of α. We can envision a model in which effector and G protein heterotrimer are precomplexed and poised for immediate activation. The top surface of the βγ complex may be critical for effector activation and may become available to the effector upon activated receptor-induced activation of α subunits without a requirement for a potentially rate-limiting dissociation of α subunits or association of PLC β2. Deactivation could involve occlusion of the effector-binding site on β by α(GDP) subunits with the βγ·PLCβ2 complex without dissociation of PLC β2 from βγ. Identification of a binding site for PLC that does not overlap with α subunits supports this hypothesis and provides a starting point for understanding molecular interactions that could allow PLC to remain associated with βγ subunits in the presence of bound α subunits."
https://openalex.org/W2312517312,"Fgf4, a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, is frequently amplified in a variety of human cancers, however, its expression in neoplastic tissues is rarely detectable. This makes uncertain its involvement in tumour aetiology, although several in-vitro studies link Fgf4 overexpression to malignant transformation and metastatization of culture cells. We generated a transgenic mouse model in which the whey acidic protein (WAP) promoter directs expression of human Fgf4 to mammary tissues during late pregnancy and throughout lactation, with the purpose of studying the involvement of this growth factor in mammary tumorigenesis. Expression of the transgene was specifically detected in lobular-alveolar cells of lactating mammary glands that, by histological analysis, displayed hyperplastic areas and a disorganized structure. This was accompanied by an increased number of red blood cells and expression, in alveolar epithelial cells, of the vascular endothelial growth factor, which is absent in wild type controls. The most striking effect caused by FGF4 overexpression was on the remodelling of mammary tissue at the end of lactation. Indeed, transgenic animals showed a delayed involution of the gland due to a dramatic reduction in the overall number of apoptotic cells, which are normally present in the organ after weaning. Nevertheless, none of the animals examined developed neoplastic lesions of the mammary gland even after several pregnancies and at old age. Our work represents the first in-vivo demonstration of the anti-apoptotic and angiogenic properties of FGF4."
