https://openalex.org/W2115318086,"Label-free chemical contrast is highly desirable in biomedical imaging. Spontaneous Raman microscopy provides specific vibrational signatures of chemical bonds, but is often hindered by low sensitivity. Here we report a three-dimensional multiphoton vibrational imaging technique based on stimulated Raman scattering (SRS). The sensitivity of SRS imaging is significantly greater than that of spontaneous Raman microscopy, which is achieved by implementing high-frequency (megahertz) phase-sensitive detection. SRS microscopy has a major advantage over previous coherent Raman techniques in that it offers background-free and readily interpretable chemical contrast. We show a variety of biomedical applications, such as differentiating distributions of omega-3 fatty acids and saturated lipids in living cells, imaging of brain and skin tissues based on intrinsic lipid contrast, and monitoring drug delivery through the epidermis."
https://openalex.org/W2074862753,"Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in bacteria and archaea occurs through phage transduction, transformation, or conjugation, and the latter is particularly important for the spread of antibiotic resistance. Clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) loci confer sequence-directed immunity against phages. A clinical isolate of Staphylococcus epidermidis harbors a CRISPR spacer that matches the nickase gene present in nearly all staphylococcal conjugative plasmids. Here we show that CRISPR interference prevents conjugation and plasmid transformation in S. epidermidis . Insertion of a self-splicing intron into nickase blocks interference despite the reconstitution of the target sequence in the spliced mRNA, which indicates that the interference machinery targets DNA directly. We conclude that CRISPR loci counteract multiple routes of HGT and can limit the spread of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria."
https://openalex.org/W2140524010,"Calcium carbonate forms scales, geological deposits, biominerals, and ocean sediments. Huge amounts of carbon dioxide are retained as carbonate ions, and calcium ions represent a major contribution to water hardness. Despite its relevance, little is known about the precipitation mechanism of calcium carbonate, and specified complex crystal structures challenge the classical view on nucleation considering the formation of metastable ion clusters. We demonstrate that dissolved calcium carbonate in fact contains stable prenucleation ion clusters forming even in undersaturated solution. The cluster formation can be characterized by means of equilibrium thermodynamics, applying a multiple-binding model, which allows for structural preformation. Stable clusters are the relevant species in calcium carbonate nucleation. Such mechanisms may also be important for the crystallization of other minerals."
https://openalex.org/W1995828353,"The perception of pathogen or microbe-associated molecular pattern molecules by plants triggers a basal defense response analogous to animal innate immunity and is defined partly by the deposition of the glucan polymer callose at the cell wall at the site of pathogen contact. Transcriptional and metabolic profiling in Arabidopsis mutants, coupled with the monitoring of pathogen-triggered callose deposition, have identified major roles in pathogen response for the plant hormone ethylene and the secondary metabolite 4-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate. Two genes, PEN2 and PEN3 , are also necessary for resistance to pathogens and are required for both callose deposition and glucosinolate activation, suggesting that the pathogen-triggered callose response is required for resistance to microbial pathogens. Our study shows that well-studied plant metabolites, previously identified as important in avoiding damage by herbivores, are also required as a component of the plant defense response against microbial pathogens."
https://openalex.org/W2084588382,"We report the existence of an entorhinal cell type that fires when an animal is close to the borders of the proximal environment. The orientation-specific edge-apposing activity of these “border cells” is maintained when the environment is stretched and during testing in enclosures of different size and shape in different rooms. Border cells are relatively sparse, making up less than 10% of the local cell population, but can be found in all layers of the medial entorhinal cortex as well as the adjacent parasubiculum, often intermingled with head-direction cells and grid cells. Border cells may be instrumental in planning trajectories and anchoring grid fields and place fields to a geometric reference frame."
https://openalex.org/W2115037790,"Selection pressure exerted by insects and microorganisms shapes the diversity of plant secondary metabolites. We identified a metabolic pathway for glucosinolates, known insect deterrents, that differs from the pathway activated by chewing insects. This pathway is active in living plant cells, may contribute to glucosinolate turnover, and has been recruited for broad-spectrum antifungal defense responses. The Arabidopsis CYP81F2 gene encodes a P450 monooxygenase that is essential for the pathogen-induced accumulation of 4-methoxyindol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate, which in turn is activated by the atypical PEN2 myrosinase (a type of β-thioglucoside glucohydrolase) for antifungal defense. We propose that reiterated enzymatic cycles, controlling the generation of toxic molecules and their detoxification, enable the recruitment of glucosinolates in defense responses."
https://openalex.org/W1983475289,"Geochemical models for Mars predict carbonate formation during aqueous alteration. Carbonate-bearing rocks had not previously been detected on Mars' surface, but Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter mapping reveals a regional rock layer with near-infrared spectral characteristics that are consistent with the presence of magnesium carbonate in the Nili Fossae region. The carbonate is closely associated with both phyllosilicate-bearing and olivine-rich rock units and probably formed during the Noachian or early Hesperian era from the alteration of olivine by either hydrothermal fluids or near-surface water. The presence of carbonate as well as accompanying clays suggests that waters were neutral to alkaline at the time of its formation and that acidic weathering, proposed to be characteristic of Hesperian Mars, did not destroy these carbonates and thus did not dominate all aqueous environments."
https://openalex.org/W2020622102,"The host tissue microenvironment influences malignant cell proliferation and metastasis, but little is known about how tumor-induced changes in the microenvironment affect benign cellular ecosystems. Applying dynamic in vivo imaging to a mouse model, we show that leukemic cell growth disrupts normal hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) bone marrow niches and creates abnormal microenvironments that sequester transplanted human CD34 + (HPC-enriched) cells. CD34 + cells in leukemic mice declined in number over time and failed to mobilize into the peripheral circulation in response to cytokine stimulation. Neutralization of stem cell factor (SCF) secreted by leukemic cells inhibited CD34 + cell migration into malignant niches, normalized CD34 + cell numbers, and restored CD34 + cell mobilization in leukemic mice. These data suggest that the tumor microenvironment causes HPC dysfunction by usurping normal HPC niches and that therapeutic inhibition of HPC interaction with tumor niches may help maintain normal progenitor cell function in the setting of malignancy."

https://openalex.org/W2039705838,"The density of the amorphous phase of metals is generally thought to be related to glass formation, but this correlation has not been demonstrated experimentally to date. In this work, systematic deflection measurements using microcantilevers and a combinatorial deposition method show a correlation between glass-forming ability and the density change upon crystallization over a broad compositional range in the copper-zirconium binary system. Distinct peaks in the density of the amorphous phase were found to correlate with specific maxima in the critical thickness for glass formation. Our findings provide quantitative data for the development of structural models of liquids that are readily quenched to the amorphous state. The experimental method developed in this work can facilitate the search for new glass-forming alloys."
https://openalex.org/W2021942256,"Diversity in leaf shape is produced by alterations of the margin: for example, deep dissection leads to leaflet formation and less-pronounced incision results in serrations or lobes. By combining gene silencing and mutant analyses in four distantly related eudicot species, we show that reducing the function of NAM / CUC boundary genes ( NO APICAL MERISTEM and CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON ) leads to a suppression of all marginal outgrowths and to fewer and fused leaflets. We propose that NAM/CUC genes promote formation of a boundary domain that delimits leaflets. This domain has a dual role promoting leaflet separation locally and leaflet formation at distance. In this manner, boundaries of compound leaves resemble boundaries functioning during animal development."
https://openalex.org/W1993349714,"Perforin-like proteins are expressed by many bacterial and protozoan pathogens, yet little is known about their function or mode of action. Here, we describe Toxoplasma perforin-like protein 1 (TgPLP1), a secreted perforin-like protein of the intracellular protozoan pathogen Toxoplasma gondii that displays structural features necessary for pore formation. After intracellular growth, TgPLP1-deficient parasites failed to exit normally, resulting in entrapment within host cells. We show that this defect is due to an inability to rapidly permeabilize the parasitophorous vacuole membrane and host plasma membrane during exit. TgPLP1 ablation had little effect on growth in culture but resulted in a reduction greater than five orders of magnitude of acute virulence in mice. Perforin-like proteins from other intracellular pathogens may play a similar role in microbial egress and virulence."
https://openalex.org/W2027618375,"The causative agent of Legionnaires disease, Legionella pneumophila, forms a replicative vacuole in phagocytes by means of the intracellular multiplication/defective organelle trafficking (Icm/Dot) type IV secretion system and translocated effector proteins, some of which subvert host GTP and phosphoinositide (PI) metabolism. The Icm/Dot substrate SidC anchors to the membrane of Legionella-containing vacuoles (LCVs) by specifically binding to phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PtdIns(4)P). Using a nonbiased screen for novel L. pneumophila PI-binding proteins, we identified the Rab1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) SidM/DrrA as the predominant PtdIns(4)P-binding protein. Purified SidM specifically and directly bound to PtdIns(4)P, whereas the SidM-interacting Icm/Dot substrate LidA preferentially bound PtdIns(3)P but also PtdIns(4)P, and the L. pneumophila Arf1 GEF RalF did not bind to any PIs. The PtdIns(4)P-binding domain of SidM was mapped to the 12-kDa C-terminal sequence, termed ""P4M"" (PtdIns4P binding of SidM/DrrA). The isolated P4M domain is largely helical and displayed higher PtdIns(4)P binding activity in the context of the alpha-helical, monomeric full-length protein. SidM constructs containing P4M were translocated by Icm/Dot-proficient L. pneumophila and localized to the LCV membrane, indicating that SidM anchors to PtdIns(4)P on LCVs via its P4M domain. An L. pneumophila DeltasidM mutant strain displayed significantly higher amounts of SidC on LCVs, suggesting that SidM and SidC compete for limiting amounts of PtdIns(4)P on the vacuole. Finally, RNA interference revealed that PtdIns(4)P on LCVs is specifically formed by host PtdIns 4-kinase IIIbeta. Thus, L. pneumophila exploits PtdIns(4)P produced by PtdIns 4-kinase IIIbeta to anchor the effectors SidC and SidM to LCVs."
https://openalex.org/W1999902625,"The circadian oscillator in eukaryotes consists of several interlocking feedback loops through which the expression of clock genes is controlled. It is generally assumed that all plant cells contain essentially identical and cell-autonomous multiloop clocks. Here, we show that the circadian clock in the roots of mature Arabidopsis plants differs markedly from that in the shoots and that the root clock is synchronized by a photosynthesis-related signal from the shoot. Two of the feedback loops of the plant circadian clock are disengaged in roots, because two key clock components, the transcription factors CCA1 and LHY, are able to inhibit gene expression in shoots but not in roots. Thus, the plant clock is organ-specific but not organ-autonomous."
https://openalex.org/W2040691044,"The high–energy density behavior of carbon, particularly in the vicinity of the melt boundary, is of broad scientific interest and of particular interest to those studying planetary astrophysics and inertial confinement fusion. Previous experimental data in the several hundred gigapascal pressure range, particularly near the melt boundary, have only been able to provide data with accuracy capable of qualitative comparison with theory. Here we present shock-wave experiments on carbon (using a magnetically driven flyer-plate technique with an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy) that enable quantitative comparison with theory. This work provides evidence for the existence of a diamond-bc8-liquid triple point on the melt boundary."
https://openalex.org/W2028789155,"Fumonisin B(1) (FB(1)) is a mycotoxin that inhibits ceramide synthases (CerS) and causes kidney and liver toxicity and other disease. Inhibition of CerS by FB(1) increases sphinganine (Sa), Sa 1-phosphate, and a previously unidentified metabolite. Analysis of the latter by quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry assigned an m/z = 286.3123 in positive ionization mode, consistent with the molecular formula for deoxysphinganine (C(18)H(40)NO). Comparison with a synthetic standard using liquid chromatography, electrospray tandem mass spectrometry identified the metabolite as 1-deoxysphinganine (1-deoxySa) based on LC mobility and production of a distinctive fragment ion (m/z 44, CH(3)CH=NH (+)(2)) upon collision-induced dissociation. This novel sphingoid base arises from condensation of alanine with palmitoyl-CoA via serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), as indicated by incorporation of l-[U-(13)C]alanine into 1-deoxySa by Vero cells; inhibition of its production in LLC-PK(1) cells by myriocin, an SPT inhibitor; and the absence of incorporation of [U-(13)C]palmitate into 1-[(13)C]deoxySa in LY-B cells, which lack SPT activity. LY-B-LCB1 cells, in which SPT has been restored by stable transfection, however, produce large amounts of 1-[(13)C]deoxySa. 1-DeoxySa was elevated in FB(1)-treated cells and mouse liver and kidney, and its cytotoxicity was greater than or equal to that of Sa for LLC-PK(1) and DU-145 cells. Therefore, this compound is likely to contribute to pathologies associated with fumonisins. In the absence of FB(1), substantial amounts of 1-deoxySa are made and acylated to N-acyl-1-deoxySa (i.e. 1-deoxydihydroceramides). Thus, these compounds are an underappreciated category of bioactive sphingoid bases and ""ceramides"" that might play important roles in cell regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2048360353,"Fixed nitrogen (N) is a limiting nutrient for algae in the low-latitude ocean, and its oceanic inventory may have been higher during ice ages, thus helping to lower atmospheric CO 2 during those intervals. In organic matter within planktonic foraminifera shells in Caribbean Sea sediments, we found that the 15 N/ 14 N ratio from the last ice age is higher than that from the current interglacial, indicating a higher nitrate 15 N/ 14 N ratio in the Caribbean thermocline. This change and other species-specific differences are best explained by less N fixation in the Atlantic during the last ice age. The fixation decrease was most likely a response to a known ice age reduction in ocean N loss, and it would have worked to balance the ocean N budget and to curb ice age–interglacial change in the N inventory."
https://openalex.org/W1978908521,"The search for new molecules to fight Pseudomonas aeruginosa is of paramount importance. Carbon monoxide (CO) is known to act as an effective inhibitor of the respiratory chain in P. aeruginosa, but the practical use of this gas as an antibacterial molecule is hampered by its toxicity and difficulty to manipulate. Here, we show that a water-soluble CO releaser (CORM-3) possesses bactericidal properties against laboratory and antibiotic-resistant P. aeruginosa. CORM-3 reduced the bacterial count by 4 logs 180 min after in vitro treatment. CORM-3-treated bacteria had a lower O(2) consumption than vehicle-treated bacteria, and the decrease in O(2) consumption temporally preceded the bactericidal action of CORM-3. These results support the hypothesis that the antimicrobial effect of CORM-3 is mediated by an interaction of CO liberated by the carrier with the bacterial respiratory chain. The antibacterial effect occurred at concentrations of CORM-3 that are 50-fold lower than toxic concentrations for eukaryotic cells. CORM-3 treatment compared to vehicle treatment decreased bacterial counts in the spleen and increased survival in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed mice following P. aeruginosa bacteremia. Our results suggest that CORMs could form the basis for developing a new therapeutic strategy against P. aeruginosa-induced infection."
https://openalex.org/W2055090154,"The repeated discovery of adult dinosaurs in close association with egg clutches leads to speculation over the type and extent of care exhibited by these extinct animals for their eggs and young. To assess parental care in Cretaceous troodontid and oviraptorid dinosaurs, we examined clutch volume and the bone histology of brooding adults. In comparison to four archosaur care regressions, the relatively large clutch volumes of Troodon, Oviraptor, and Citipati scale most closely with a bird-paternal care model. Clutch-associated adults lack the maternal and reproductively associated histologic features common to extant archosaurs. Large clutch volumes and a suite of reproductive features shared only with birds favor paternal care, possibly within a polygamous mating system. Paternal care in both troodontids and oviraptorids indicates that this care system evolved before the emergence of birds and represents birds' ancestral condition. In extant birds and over most adult sizes, paternal and biparental care correspond to the largest and smallest relative clutch volumes, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2108489423,"Chronic iron overload has slow and insidious effects on heart, liver, and other organs. Because iron-driven oxidation of most biologic materials (such as lipids and proteins) is readily repaired, this slow progression of organ damage implies some kind of biological “memory.” We hypothesized that cumulative iron-catalyzed oxidant damage to mtDNA might occur in iron overload, perhaps explaining the often lethal cardiac dysfunction. Real time PCR was used to examine the “intactness” of mttDNA in cultured H9c2 rat cardiac myocytes. After 3–5 days exposure to high iron, these cells exhibited damage to mtDNA reflected by diminished amounts of near full-length 15.9-kb PCR product with no change in the amounts of a 16.1-kb product from a nuclear gene. With the loss of intact mtDNA, cellular respiration declined and mRNAs for three electron transport chain subunits and 16 S rRNA encoded by mtDNA decreased, whereas no decrements were found in four subunits encoded by nuclear DNA. To examine the importance of the interactions of iron with metabolically generated reactive oxygen species, we compared the toxic effects of iron in wild-type and rhoo cells. In wild-type cells, elevated iron caused increased production of reactive oxygen species, cytostasis, and cell death, whereas the rhoo cells were unaffected. We conclude that long-term damage to cells and organs in iron-overload disorders involves interactions between iron and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species resulting in cumulative damage to mtDNA, impaired synthesis of respiratory chain subunits, and respiratory dysfunction.

The present investigations were focused on the etiology of iron-mediated cardiac damage and specifically on the question of why, in patients with chronic iron overload, damage to organs such as the heart develops over a period of years, whereas most types of iron-mediated oxidation events can be repaired within minutes or hours. We have investigated the hypothesis that cumulative damage to DNA, specifically mtDNA, is critical to the slow development of cardiac dysfunction in chronic iron overload. In partial support of this idea, earlier studies clearly show that iron does promote DNA base oxidation as well as single and double strand DNA breaks. Mitochondrial DNA may be particularly vulnerable to such oxidation events inasmuch as it lacks histones, has less effective repair systems and, perhaps most importantly, resides within an organelle that ceaselessly generates ROS. Here, we report that, in cultured rat cardiac myocytes, iron overload causes (i) progressive loss of intact mtDNA, (ii) decreased expression of respiratory chain subunits encoded by mitochondrial, but not nuclear, DNA, and (iii) diminished respiratory function. Furthermore, it appears that iron-mediated cytotoxicity involves ROS generated by the mitochondrion itself because cells lacking mtDNA (and, therefore, respiration) are remarkably tolerant of iron overload. Overall, our results suggest that the slowly developing cardiac dysfunction seen in chronic iron overload arises secondary to cumulative iron-driven oxidant damage to mtDNA.

Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), trypsin-EDTA, annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate, agarose powder, and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Invitrogen.

Cell Culture—H9c2 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Stock cultures were grown in polystyrene T-75 culture flasks in a Forma Scientific incubator. The cells were split 1:10 every 3–4 days. For experiments involving exposure to iron (in the form of FAC), cells were initially plated at varying densities because we found that the toxic effects of added FAC were highly dependent on cell density (with more dense cultures being more resistant to iron toxicity). Therefore, for experiments involving longer term exposure to higher iron concentrations (e.g. results shown in Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7, 8, 9) cell cultures were ∼60% confluent upon the addition of FAC, whereas for studies of toxicity under growth conditions (Figs. 5 and 6) cultures were ∼10% confluent at the start. For determinations of cell growth rate, cells were seeded in 48-well semi-microtiter plates (2 × 104 cells/well) for 24 h prior to the addition of FAC.

Following exposure to iron, the cells were detached with trypsin/EDTA containing 1 mm desferrioxamine equivalents of the high molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch:desferrioxamine conjugate to remove any extracellular iron. The cells then were washed in ice-cold Chelex-treated PBS three times. For iron measurements, a 300-μl suspension containing 3 × 106 cells was extracted with 200 μl of ice-cold 25% perchloric acid (final concentration = 10%). Following 30 min incubation on ice, the precipitate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min and 400 μl of supernatant was used for assay of “loose” iron. Assays contained 400 μl of the supernatant, 100 μl of freshly prepared 0.25 m sodium ascorbate, 400 μl of 40% (w/v) ammonium acetate, and 100 μl of 3.0 mg/ml Ferene S. Absorbance was measured at 594 nm and the results were calculated using an extinction coefficient of 35.5 mm–1 cm–1 for the Ferene S:iron chelate (9Eskelinen S. Haikonen M. Raisanen S. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Investig. 1983; 43: 453-455Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Artiss J.D. Vinogradov S. Zak B. Clin. Biochem. 1981; 14: 311-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). For measurements of total residual iron, the precipitate was digested with 100 μl of 50% nitric acid at 56 °C for 24 h. Following the addition of NaOH to neutralize the nitric acid, iron was assayed as described above. Determination of Protein Carbonyls—Cell lysates and mitochondria were prepared from cell suspensions washed twice with cold mitochondrial isolation buffer (250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm desferrioxamine equivalents of high molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch:desferrioxamine conjugate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.8). The cells were suspended in this isolation buffer to 8 × 106 cells/ml and disrupted by nitrogen cavitation at 4 °C using an ice-cooled cell disruption bomb (Parr Instrument Co., Moline, IL). Total cell lysates were used directly for carbonyl assays and mitochondria were prepared by differential centrifugation using a modification of the procedure described by Fuller et al. (11Fuller K.M. Duffy C.F. Arriaga E.A. Electrophoresis. 2002; 23: 1571-1576Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Following removal of large debris by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C to obtain mitochondrial pellets. The total protein carbonyl content of whole cell lysates and mitochondria was determined by reaction with 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine using a slight modification of the method of Levine et al. (12Levine R.L. Garland D. Oliver C.N. Amici A. Climent I. Lenz A.G. Ahn B.W. Shaltiel S. Stadtman E.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 186: 464-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (4980) Google Scholar). Samples containing ∼300 μg of protein were incubated with 500 μl of 10 mm 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine in 2 m HCl at room temperature for 1 h with intermittent mixing. Following the addition of 500 μl of 20% (w/v) ice-cold trichloroacetic acid, the samples were centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 3 min. The supernatant was discarded and the pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of ethanol:ethyl acetate (1:1) to remove unreacted 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine. The protein pellet was redissolved in 0.6 ml of 6 m guanidine with 20 mm K2HPO4 (pH adjusted to 2.3 with 20% trichloroacetic acid) and any insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 11,000 × g for 3 min. The carbonyl content in the supernatant was measured spectrophotometrically at 375 nm. Results were calculated using an absorbance coefficient of 22,000 m–1 cm–1 and normalized for protein concentration measured using a bichinchoninc acid reaction (Pierce). Total Cellular DNA Isolation—Total DNA was isolated using the QIAamp DNA isolation kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, following exposure to varying concentrations of iron, the cells were detached with trypsin/EDTA containing 1 mm desferrioxamine equivalents of the high molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch:desferrioxamine conjugate to remove adventitious iron. The cells then were washed in ice-cold Chelex-treated PBS three times. The cells were counted using a hemocytometer (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) prior to DNA isolation. DNA was quantified using PicoGreen® (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) with fluorescence measured at 485 nm excitation and 525 nm emission using a spectrofluorometric plate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Sunnyvale, CA). PCR Amplification—To assess DNA integrity in control and iron-treated H9c2 cells, near full-length mtDNA amplification was performed using a GeneAmp XL PCR kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The reaction mixtures contained 20 ng of total cellular DNA as a template, 0.4 μm of each primer, 1.2 mm magnesium, and 0.5 unit of recombinant Thermus thermophilus DNA polymerase in a total volume of 25 μl. Primers for amplification of the 15.9-kb fragment of mtDNA were 5′-CCT CCC ATT CAT TAT CGC CGC CCT TGC-3 (sense) and 5′-GAT GGG GCC GGT AGG TCG ATA AAG GAG-3 (antisense). To produce a 200-bp fragment of mtDNA (as a control for mtDNA input) the primers were 5′-CCT CCC ATT CAT TAT CGC CGC CCT TGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-GTC TGG GTC TCC TAG TAG GTC TGG GAA-3′ (antisense) (13Ayala-Torres S. Chen Y. Svoboda T. Rosenblatt J. Van Houten B. Methods. 2000; 22: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The near full-length mtDNA PCR was initiated at 75 °C for 3 min followed by 1 min at 94 °C and 25 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 68 °C for 12 min and final extension at 72 °C for 15 min. The 200-bp PCR was started at 95 °C for 2 min then 25 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and final extension at 72 °C for 5 min (14Yakes F.M. Van Houten B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 514-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (1454) Google Scholar). The amplified products were resolved on 0.8% agarose gels (15.9 kb) and 1.2% agarose gels (200 bp) containing 0.5% ethidium bromide. The PCR products were quantified with PicoGreen using a plate reading spectrofluorometer at 485 nm excitation and 525 nm emission. To determine whether iron-mediated DNA damage was specific for mtDNA or perhaps shared by nuclear DNA, we also performed PCR amplification of a long fragment of the nuclear transferrin receptor gene (16.1 kb) as well as a short segment of the β-globin gene (265 bp). The reaction mixture contained 200 ng of total cellular DNA as a template, 0.4 μm of each primer, and 1.2 mm magnesium. Primers for amplification of the long fragment of the transferrin receptor gene (primer sequence from Occam Biolabs, Wilmington, DE) were 5′-GCA TAT TGG AAC ACT TGT GAG GGT GG-3′(sense) and 5′-AGA AGA CAT GCG CTT AGA TGC CAG AA-3′ (antisense). For the 265-bp fragment of the β-globin gene (as a control for input of nuclear DNA) the primers were 5′-CCA ATC TGC TCA CAC AGG-3(sense) and 5′-CAC CTT TCC CCA CAG G-3′ (antisense). The long length nuclear gene PCR was initiated at 75 °C for 3 min followed by 1 min at 94 °C and 25 cycles of 94 °C for 15 s, 68 °C for 12 min, and final extension at 72 °C for 15 min. The 265-bp β-globin fragment PCR was started at 95 °C for 2 min, then 25 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. Amplified products were resolved and quantified as described above. Quantitative Real-time Reverse Transcript (qRT)-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using an Rneasy® Mini Kit (Qiagen). Two μg of total RNA was converted to cDNA with Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and random primers p(dN)6 (Promega, Madison, WI). qRT-PCR was performed using the Power SYBR® Green PCR Master Mix (AB Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA) on the DNA Engine Opticon real-time system (Bio-Rad). qRT-PCR was done for mRNAs encoded by both nuclear and mitochondrial genes. Nuclear genes were: iso-1-cytochrome c (Cyc1), succinate dehydrogenase subunit b (Sdh subunit b), cytochrome c oxidase Vb (Cox vb), nuclear respiratory factor 1 (Nrf1), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Mitochondrial genes were: 16 S rRNA, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (Nd4), cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (Cox1), and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (Nd1). The primers used are listed in supplementary data Table S1. The thermal cycler conditions were as follows: 10 min at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Finally the samples were held at 65 °C for 5 min and melting curves were performed from 65 to 95.1 °C. All tests were performed in triplicate and all experiments were repeated three times. The amplification data were analyzed with Opticon Monitor analysis software. Calculations were based on the “Delta-Delta method” using the equation: R (ratio) = 2–[ΔCT sample –ΔCT control] (15Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (124899) Google Scholar). The integrity of amplified DNA was confirmed by determination of melting temperature. The data were expressed as -fold changes of the treatment groups in relation to the controls. Mitochondrial DNA Isolation and 8-Oxo-deoxyguanosine (8-Oxo-dG) Quantification—Mitochondrial DNA was isolated from control and iron-treated H9c2 cells with the BioVision mitochondrial DNA isolation kit (BioVision, Mountain View, CA). Prior to DNA isolation, the intact mitochondria were digested with DNase (Promega, Madison, WI) to prevent nuclear DNA contamination (which was checked by PCR amplification of a 256-bp segment of the β-globin gene). The purity of the isolated mitochondria was estimated by measurements of acid phosphatase activity (because impure preparations are most likely to be contaminated by lysosomes). As expected, acid phosphatase activity of whole cell lysates was quite high but the enzyme activity was undetectable in isolated mitochondria (i.e. <0.1% of whole cell activity/mg of protein). Following mtDNA isolation, 8-oxo-dG adducts were measured using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Trevigen Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). Briefly, 1 μg of mtDNA was combined with anti-8-oxo-dG antibody and the samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C. Twenty-four hours later, the samples were added to 96-well microtiter plates containing bound albumin:8-oxo-dG adducts and incubated at room temperature for 2 h. The plate was then washed and incubated with a peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h in the dark. The plate was then washed (6 times) and tetramethylbenzidene substrate was added to each well and incubated for 15 min in the dark. After the addition of a stop solution, absorbance was read at 450 nm. Results were calculated based on a standard curve run simultaneously. Establishment of H9c2 rhoo Cells—H9c2 cells were cultured under otherwise standard conditions in DMEM supplemented with 4 mg/ml glucose, 100 μg/ml pyruvate, and 50 μg/ml uridine to compensate for (i) respiratory incompetence, (ii) pyridine nucleotide redox imbalance, and (iii) pyrimidine/purine auxotrophy, respectively, arising from mitochondrial dysfunction. Ethidium bromide (1 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (50 μg/ml) were added and the cells were cultured under these conditions for 10 months at which time testing of mitochondrial membrane potential with JC-1 indicated that most of the cells were rhoo. For estimation of mitochondrial membrane potential, JC-1 was added to the cell culture for 30 min at 37 °C at a final concentration of 5 μm. The cells were then washed three times in HBSS (containing Ca2+ and Mg2+) and examined by fluorescence microscopy. The cells were subcloned by limiting dilution and the clones were maintained in the same supplemented culture medium (above) for four passages. At that point, the rhoo status of individual clones was verified by (i) absence of JC-1 staining (mitochondrial membrane potential), (ii) absence of the 200-bp PCR product for mtDNA, (iii) lack of cytochrome c oxidase activity (measured as described below), and (iv) failure to grow in non-supplemented DMEM. Estimation of ROS Production by Iron-loaded Cardiac Myocytes—ROS production was assessed by following the oxidation of DCF-DA. H9c2 cells and rhoo H9c2 cells were plated onto 48-well plates at an initial density of 2 × 104 cells per well in supplemented DMEM. When the cells were >60% confluent (second or third day) 300 μm FAC was added. After 24 h in culture, the cells were washed three times with HBSS (containing Ca2+ and Mg2+). ROS production was estimated following the addition of 10 μm DCF-DA (final concentration) and DCF fluorescence was followed for 1 h using a thermostated plate reading spectrofluorometer (520 nm excitation and 610 nm emission). Relative fluorescence was corrected for variations in cell protein between individual wells. Oxygen Consumption Measurements—H9c2 cells were cultured on 150-cm plates. When the cells reached ∼60% confluence, 300 μm FAC was added. Following 7–11 days, the cells were washed once with PBS, detached with trypsin-EDTA, and suspended in complete culture medium. The cells were concentrated by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in culture medium. Respiration was measured with and without the addition of 20 μm CCCP (an uncoupler) using a Gilson Oxygraph with a Clark electrode (Yellow Springs Instrument Co., Yellow Springs, OH). Respiration rates were measured using 5 × 106 cells suspended in a total volume of 3.0 ml of DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with 17 mm glutamate at 37 °C. A starting O2 concentration of 240 μm was assumed based on O2 solubility at sea level at 37 °C. Results were adjusted for variations in the numbers of viable cells as determined by trypan blue exclusion. Cytochrome c Oxidas"

Here, using a wide range of biochemical and morphological approaches applied in both mouse models and cultured endothelial cells, we addressed the mechanisms of PAF-induced disruption of interendothelial junctions (IEJs) and of increased endothelial permeability. The formation of interendothelial gaps filled with filopodia and lamellipodia is the cellular event responsible for the disruption of endothelial barrier. We observed that PAF ligation of its receptor induced the activation of the Rho GTPase Rac1. Following PAF exposure, both Rac1 and its guanine nucleotide exchange factor Tiam1 were found associated with a membrane fraction from which they co-immunoprecipitated with PAF receptor. In the same time frame with Tiam1-Rac1 translocation, the junctional proteins ZO-1 and VE-cadherin were relocated from the IEJs, and formation of numerous interendothelial gaps was recorded. Notably, the response was independent of myosin light chain phosphorylation and thus distinct from other mediators, such as histamine and thrombin. The changes in actin status are driven by the PAF-induced localized actin polymerization as a consequence of Rac1 translocation and activation. Tiam1 was required for the activation of Rac1, actin polymerization, relocation of junctional associated proteins, and disruption of IEJs. Thus, PAF-induced IEJ disruption and increased endothelial permeability requires the activation of a Tiam1-Rac1 signaling module, suggesting a novel therapeutic target against increased vascular permeability associated with inflammatory diseases.

The endothelial barrier is made up of endothelial cells (ECs) 4The abbreviations used are: EC, endothelial cell; AJ, adherens junction; Ab, antibody; EM, electron microscopy; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; IEJ, interendothelial junction; MLC, myosin light chain; NC, nitrocellulose; PAF, platelet-activating factor; PAF-R, platelet activating factor receptor; PDB, peripheral dense band; PLC, phospholipase C; SF, stress fiber(s); TJ, tight junction; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DTT, dithiothreitol; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.4The abbreviations used are: EC, endothelial cell; AJ, adherens junction; Ab, antibody; EM, electron microscopy; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; IEJ, interendothelial junction; MLC, myosin light chain; NC, nitrocellulose; PAF, platelet-activating factor; PAF-R, platelet activating factor receptor; PDB, peripheral dense band; PLC, phospholipase C; SF, stress fiber(s); TJ, tight junction; siRNA, small interfering RNA; DTT, dithiothreitol; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. connected to each other by interendothelial junctions (IEJs) consisting of protein complexes organized as tight junctions (TJs) and adherens junctions (AJs). In addition, the focal adhesion complex located at the basal plasma membrane enables firm contact of ECs with the underlying basement membrane and also contributes to the barrier function (1Simionescu M. Gafencu A. Antohe F. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2002; 57: 269-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 2Mehta D. Malik A.B. Physiol.

Chem. 2007; 282: 17166-17178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The glycocalyx, the endothelial monolayer, and the basement membrane all together constitute the vascular barrier. The structural integrity of the ECs along with their proper functionality are the two most important factors controlling the tightness of the endothelial barrier. Changes affecting these factors cause loss of barrier restrictiveness and leakiness. Therefore, defining and understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling these processes is of paramount importance. Increased width of IEJs in response to permeability-increasing mediators (4Michel C.C. Curry F.E. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 703-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar) regulates the magnitude of transendothelial exchange of fluid and solutes. Disruption of IEJs and the resultant barrier leakiness contribute to the genesis of diverse pathological conditions, such as inflammation (5Majno G. Palade G.E. J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1961; 11: 571-605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), metastasis (6Robert E.G. Hunt J.D. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2001; 7: 1615-1626Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 7Stafforini D.M. McIntyre T.M. Zimmerman G.A. Prescott S.M. Crit. Rev. Clin. Lab. Sci. 2003; 40: 643-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar), and uncontrolled angiogenesis (8Dvorak H.F. Brown L.F. Detmar M. Dvorak A.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 146: 1029-1039PubMed Google Scholar, 9Roberts W.G. Palade G.E. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 2369-2379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Accumulated evidence demonstrated that IEJs changes are responsible for increased or decreased vascular permeability, and the generally accepted mechanism responsible for them was the myosin light chain (MLC)-mediated contraction of ECs (5Majno G. Palade G.E. J. Biophys. Biochem. Cytol. 1961; 11: 571-605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Garcia J.G. Davis H.W. Patterson C.E. J. Cell Physiol. 1995; 163: 510-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). However, published evidence showed that an increase in vascular permeability could be obtained without a direct involvement of any contractile mechanism (11Lee T.Y. Gotlieb A.I. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2003; 60: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 12Adamson R.H. Zeng M. Adamson G.N. Lenz J.F. Curry F.E. Am. J.

The main component of the vascular barrier, the ECs, has more than 10% of their total protein represented by actin (17Drenckhahn D. Ness W. The Endothelial Contractile Cytoskeleton. Schauttauer, Stuttgard, Germany1997Google Scholar), which under physiological salt concentrations subsists as monomers (G-actin) and assembled into filaments (F-actin). A large number of actin-interacting proteins may modulate the assembly, disassembly, and organization of G-actin and of actin filaments within a given cell type. Similar to the complexity of actin-interacting proteins found in other cell types, the ECs utilize their actin binding proteins to stabilize the endothelial monolayer in order to efficiently function as a selective barrier (11Lee T.Y. Gotlieb A.I. Microsc. Res. Tech. 2003; 60: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). In undisturbed ECs, the actin microfilaments are organized as different networks with distinctive functional and morphological characteristics: the peripheral filaments also known as peripheral dense band (PDB), the cytoplasmic fibers identified as stress fibers (SF), and the actin from the membrane cytoskeleton (18Gottlieb A.I. Langille B.L. Wong M.K. Kim D.W. Lab. Invest. 1991; 65: 123-137PubMed Google Scholar). The peripheral web, localized immediately under the membrane, is associated with (i) the luminal plasmalemma (on the apical side), (ii) the IEJ complexes on the lateral surfaces, and (iii) the focal adhesion complexes on the abluminal side (the basal part) of polarized ECs. The SF reside inside the endothelial cytoplasm and are believed to be directly connected with the plasmalemma proper on the luminal as well as on the abluminal side of the cell. As described, the endothelial actin cytoskeleton (specifically the SF) seems to be a stable structure helping the cells to remain flat under flow (19Pellegrin S. Mellor H. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3491-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). It is also established that the actin fibers participate in correct localization of different junctional complexes while keeping them in place (20Madara J.L. Moore R. Carlson S. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: C854-C861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it was suggested that the dynamic equilibrium between F- and G-actin might modulate the tightness of endothelial barrier in response to different challenges (13Baldwin A.L. Thurston G. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: H1528-H1537PubMed Google Scholar). Mediators effective at nanomolar concentrations or less that disrupt the endothelial barrier and increase vascular permeability include C2 toxin of Clostridium botulinum, vascular permeability factor, better known as vascular endothelial growth factor, and PAF (21Svensjo E. Grega G.J. Fed. Proc. 1986; 5: 89-95Google Scholar). C2 toxin increases endothelial permeability by ribosylating monomeric G-actin at Arg-177 (22Vandekerckhove J. Schering B. Barmann M. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 696-700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This results in the impairment of actin polymerization (23Wegner A. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13739-13742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), followed by rounding of ECs (16Aktories K. Barth H. Anaerobe. 2004; 10: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and the disruption of junctional integrity. Vascular permeability factor was shown to open IEJs by redistribution of junctional proteins (24Dejana E. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1949-1953Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 25Cohen A.W. Carbajal J.M. Schaeffer Jr., R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H2038-H2049PubMed Google Scholar) and by interfering with the equilibrium of actin pools (26Rousseau S. Houle F. Huot J. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2000; 10: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). PAF (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocoline), a naturally synthesized phospholipid is active at 10-10 m or less (27Snyder F. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 689-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). PAF is synthesized by and acts on a variety of cell types, including platelets (28Chignard M. Le Couedic J.P. Tence M.

Palmer J.D. Lohman I.C. McManus L.M. Pinckard R.N. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1980; 122: 915-924PubMed Google Scholar); however, the signaling pathways have not been elucidated. Therefore, in the present study, we carried out a systematic analysis of PAF-induced morphological and biochemical changes of endothelial barrier in vivo and in cultured ECs. We found that the opening of endothelial barrier and the increased vascular leakiness induced by PAF are the result of a shift in actin pools without involvement of EC contraction, followed by a redistribution of tight junctional associated protein ZO-1 and adherens junctional protein VE-cadherin. The reagents were obtained as follows. PAF and PAF antagonist (BN-52021) were from BIOMOL Research Laboratories; Monastral Blue, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, bovine serum albumin (BSA), Triton X-100, SDS, human thrombin, sphingosine 1-phosphate, and all chemicals for electrophoresis were from Sigma.

PAF Induces Severe Endothelial Barrier Disruption—The effects of in vivo administration of PAF were investigated on the mouse lung vascular bed, after its intravenous administration. First, we injected intravenously Monastral Blue, an electron opaque tracer with 0.5-3-μm molecular dimensions and after 5 min PAF as described under “Materials and Methods.” Morphological analysis at the EM level, following challenge with 100 nm PAF for 15 min, demonstrated focal openings of IEJs in postcapillary venules (Fig. 1A), capillaries (Fig. 1B), and muscular venules (data not shown) that allowed the free passage of not only Monastral Blue (arrows in Fig. 1, A and B) but also blood cells (note in Fig. 1A, an opened IEJ “plugged” by a platelet). These focal openings were associated with intramural deposits made up of the tracer, platelets, and even erythrocytes escaping from circulation but retained by the basement membrane (Fig. 1, A and B). The edges of ECs at the level of gaps showed characteristic finger-like projections with lengths of 1-5 μm and thickness of 0.1-0.3 μm that were tightly packed and belonged to one or the other contiguous EC (Fig. 1B, F1 and F2). These membrane projections, mainly filopodia, cramming the IEJs and extending from one cell to another were one of the most evident effects of PAF on interendothelial spaces morphology in vivo. We also detected fenestrae subtended by diaphragms in capillary (Fig. 1C, arrows) and venular lung endothelia (Fig. 1D), which are normally of the continuous type, as well as the presence of large vacuoles 0.4-3 μm in diameter (Fig. 1, A and B).

It plays a key role in red blood cell and hepatocyte invasion that can be blocked by antibodies. Methodology/Principal Findings We assessed the safety and immunogenicity of recombinant PfAMA1 in a dose-escalating, phase Ia trial. PfAMA1 FVO strain, produced in Pichia pastoris, was reconstituted at 10 µg and 50 µg doses with three different adjuvants, Alhydrogel™, Montanide ISA720 and AS02 Adjuvant System. Six randomised groups of healthy male volunteers, 8–10 volunteers each, were scheduled to receive three immunisations at 4-week intervals. Safety and immunogenicity data were collected over one year. Transient pain was the predominant injection site reaction (80–100%). Induration occurred in the Montanide 50 µg group, resulting in a sterile abscess in two volunteers. Systemic adverse events occurred mainly in the AS02 groups lasting for 1–2 days. Erythema was observed in 22% of Montanide and 59% of AS02 group volunteers. After the second dose, six volunteers in the AS02 group and one in the Montanide group who reported grade 3 erythema (>50 mm) were withdrawn as they met the stopping criteria. All adverse events resolved. There were no vaccine-related serious adverse events. Humoral responses were highest in the AS02 groups. Antibodies showed activity in an in vitro growth inhibition assay up to 80%. Upon stimulation with the vaccine, peripheral mononuclear cells from all groups proliferated and secreted IFNγ and IL-5 cytokines. Conclusions/Significance All formulations showed distinct reactogenicity profiles. All formulations with PfAMA1 were immunogenic and induced functional antibodies.

We used a combination of vitreous sectioning and electron cryotomography to study this DNA partitioning system directly in native, frozen cells. The diffraction patterns from overexpressed ParM bundles in electron cryotomographic reconstructions were used to unambiguously identify ParM filaments in Escherichia coli cells. Using a low–copy number plasmid encoding components required for partitioning, we observed small bundles of three to five intracellular ParM filaments that were situated close to the edge of the nucleoid. We propose that this may indicate the capture of plasmid DNA within the periphery of this loosely defined, chromosome-containing region."

Tanner F.C. Circulation. 2006; 113: 722-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). TF is a 47-kDa membrane glycoprotein that forms a cell-surface complex with coagulation factor VII/VIIa that proteolytically activates factors IX to IXa and X to Xa. The consequent activation of prothrombinase complex generates thrombin, which in turn leads to fibrin formation and platelet activation (5Mackman N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 6Key N.S. Bach R.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2001; 85: 375-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 7Morrissey J.H. J. Thromb. Hemostasis. 2003; 1: 878-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Very low or undetectable levels of TF are constitutively expressed by resting endothelial cells and monocytes/macrophages, although levels may be dramatically increased in certain forms of thrombosis.The expression of TF is regulated principally at the transcriptional level (5Mackman N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). The promoter of human TF contains five binding sites for specificity protein 1 (Sp1), three sites for epidermal growth response-1 (Egr-1), two sites for activator protein-1 (AP-1), and one site for NF-κB. Notably, there has been a non-conservative change of guanine to cytosine in the oligonucleotide sequence of the NF-κB site in the human TF promoter, namely the TF-κB site. It is currently believed that Sp1 sites are mainly responsible for constitutive expression of the basal level of TF, whereas Egr-1, AP-1, and NF-κB sites are chiefly accountable for inducible expression of TF. Several agonists, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β, CD40, bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), vascular endothelial growth factor, oxidized and acetylated low density lipoprotein (LDL), hypoxia, shear stress, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), are known to induce the expression of TF in vascular endothelial cells and monocytes/macrophages.The family of NF-κB transcription factors has five cellular members, called p105/p50 (NF-κB1), p100/p52 (NF-κB2), p65 (RelA), RelB and c-Rel (8Ghosh S.

Dominant among the five cellular members of NF-κB transcription factors is the p50/p65 heterodimer. In all cell types except B lymphocytes and plasma cells, NF-κB complexes are typically localized in the cytoplasm, where they bind to IκB inhibitory proteins, including IκBα, IκBβ, and IκB∊. Upon stimulation, IκB proteins are rapidly phosphorylated by IκB kinase α and β (IKKα and -β) and degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Degradation of IκB proteins exposes the nuclear localization signal on the p50/p65 heterodimer. Once translocated into nucleus, NF-κB triggers transcription of various targeting genes critical to thrombosis and inflammation, including TF, various cytokines/chemokines, and such cell adhesion molecules as E-selectin (CD62E) and VCAM-1 (5Mackman N.

Investig. 2000; 105: 1799-1806Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), and autoimmune encephalomyelitis (13Hilliard B. Samoilova E.B. Liu T.S. Rostami A. Chen Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 2937-2943PubMed Google Scholar), attesting to the critical role of p50 in the pathogenesis of inflammatory disorders.The NF-κB transcription factor p65/c-Rel reportedly regulates TF expression in human monocytes and monocytic THP-1 cells in vitro (14Parry G.C. Mackman N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20823-20825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Oeth P. Parry G.C. Mackman N. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 365-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). However, whether other NF-κB transcription factors, such as p50 and p65 (presumably as the p50/p65 heterodimer), modulate the activity and expression of TF in monocytes/macrophages and vascular endothelial cells remains undetermined. Furthermore, the importance of transcriptional regulation of TF by NF-κB transcription factors, including the p65/c-Rel and p50/p65 heterodimers, has not been investigated in vivo.We have recently reported (16Xia Y.F. Ye B.Q. Li Y.D. Wang J.G. He X.J. Lin X. Yao X. Ma D. Slungaard A. Hebbel R.P. Key N.S. Geng J.G. J. Immunol. 2004; 173: 4207-4217Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar, 18Wang Y.J. Wang J.T. Fan Q.X. Geng J.G. Cell Res. 2007; 17: 933-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) that Andrographolide (Andro) covalently modifies reduced cysteine 62 of p50, thus blocking the NF-κB oligonucleotide from binding to nuclear proteins and preventing NF-κB-activated inflammation and neointimal hyperplasia in vitro and in vivo. Using Andro and primary cells isolated from p50 null mice, we investigated whether the NF-κB transcription factor p50 critically regulates TF expression in stimulated vascular endothelial cells and activated monocytes/macrophages. We further assessed the functional significance of p50 in modulation of TF-mediated experimental deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in mice.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESIsolation of Primary Cells—The ethical review boards of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the University of Minnesota approved these studies. Informed consent was provided according to the Declaration of Helsinki. Human adherent monocytes were isolated from fresh human blood according to a previously published protocol (19Mercurio A.M. Schwarting G.A. Robbins P.W. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1114-1125Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). C57BL/6J (C57), B6;129P2-Nfkb1tm1Bal/J (p50 null mice), and B6129PF2/J (B6, background control for p50 null mice) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Murine macrophages were obtained by peritoneal lavage, according to a previously published method (20Wang B. Xiao Y. Ding B.B. Zhang N. Yuan X. Gui L. Qian K.X. Duan S. Chen Z. Rao Y. Geng J.G. Cancer Cell. 2003; 4: 19-29Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). The purity of monocytes was routinely >95% and viability was greater than >96% measured by trypan blue exclusion. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and murine pulmonary vein endothelial cells (PVECs) were cultured as previously described (17Geng J.G. Bevilacqua M.P. Moore K.L. McIntyre T.M.

Human TF activity was determined by one-stage clotting assay for measurement of prothrombin time (23Janson T.L. Stormorken H. Prydz H. Haemostasis. 1984; 14: 440-444PubMed Google Scholar). TF concentrations were determined from prothormbin time, according to the standard curve generated by clotting of human platelet poor plasma using a serial dilution of commercial TF (Innovin™, Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan) at a known concentration and a 4-channel coagulation instrument (Start 4 analyzer; Diagnostica Stago, Asniéres, France). Due to the lack of a murine TF standard, relative TF units were used for measurement of murine TF activity, using a mixture of 10% rat plasma and 90% human plasma (24Andrews B.S. Rehemtulla A. Fowler B.J. Edgington T.S. Mackman N. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 98: 265-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).

After washing once with RPMI 1640 medium (without fetal bovine serum), the transfected cells were resuspended in 5 ml of complete RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol and plated at 2 × 105 cells/ml for each well of the 6-well tissue culture plate at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2 for 48 h. The transfected cells were incubated with DMSO or Andro for 12 h prior to treatment with 1,000 units/ml TNF-α. The cells were lysed and assayed for measurement of luciferase activities using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI). Transfection efficiency was normalized with the β-galactosidase activities determined using a Luminescent β-Gal Detection Kit II (Clontech) (16Xia Y.F. Ye B.Q. Li Y.D. Wang J.G. He X.J. Lin X. Yao X.

The empty vector (mock) is pLKO.1. The sequence of c-Rel shRNA was: 5′-CCGGCCACCTATATAGATGCAGCATCTCGAGATGCTGCATCTATATAGGTGGTTTTTG-3′ (TRCN0000039983) and the sequence of non-inhibitory, control shRNA was: 5′-CCGGCCAGGAAGTTAGTGAATCTATCTCGAGATAGATTCACTAACTTCCTGGTTTTTG-3′ (TRCN0000039986). The sequence of p50 shRNA was: 5′-CCGGCCAGAGTTTACATCTGATGATCTCGAGATCATCAGATGTAAACTCTGGTTTTT-3′ (TRCN00006518), the sequence of control shRNA was: 5′-CCGGCGAATGACAGAGGCGTGTATACTCGAGTATACACGCCTCTGTCATTCGTTTTT-3′ (TRCN000006521). An aliquot of THP-1 cells (1 × 106 cells) was transfected with 3 μg of shRNA, using electroporation with Nucleofector Kit V (Amaxa Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer's protocol.cDNA Cloning—The full-length cDNA encoding mouse p50 (1–430 amino acids) was directly amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the mouse lung cDNAs, using forward primer 5′-CTGAGGATCCATGGCAGACGATGATCCCTAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTGCCTCGAGCTAATGGGTGACCCCTGCGTT-3′. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and XhoI and ligated into pCMV-3Tag-1A (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with a FLAG tag at its N terminus. Its entire sequence was verified by nucleotide sequencing.Mouse Macrophage Transfection—An aliquot of murine macrophages (1× 106 cells) was transfected with 2 μg of the plain pCMV-3Tag-1A vector or the plasmid of mouse p50 cDNA by electroporation with the Mouse Macrophage Nucleofetor Kit (Amaxa Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—HUVECs were stimulated with 1 μg/ml LPS for 1 h, and nuclear proteins were prepared with a Nuclear Extract Kit (AY2002, Panomics, Redwood City, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Five μg of the nuclear protein was incubated with radiolabeled DNA probes (50 fmol) for 30 min at room temperature in a total 20-μl binding reaction, containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 50 μg/ml of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). Protein-DNA complexes were separated from free DNA probe through 5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TBE buffer. Gels were dried and analyzed by autoradiography. For competition experiments, binding reactions were preincubated with unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides for the TF-κB consensus site (5′-GTCCCGGAGTTTCCTACCGGG-3′) and mutant control (5′-GTCCCGGAGTTAGATACCGGG-3′; Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, CA) for 30 min on ice before the addition of radiolabeled probes. Oligonucleotides were end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (both from GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ). Identical competition experiments were carried out on oligonucleotides for the NF-κB consensus site (5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′) and mutant control (5′-AGTTGAGGCGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). For antibody supershift experiments, binding reactions were preincubated with p65 (sc-372x) and p50 (sc-7178x) supershift antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) for 30 min on ice before the addition of radiolabeled probes (16Xia Y.F.

Following washing twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, they were scraped and pelleted. HUVECs (1 × 106) were resuspended in 200 μl of SDS lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 10 mm EDTA, 1% SDS, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mg/ml aprotinin, and 1 mg/ml pepstatin A) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cell lysates were sonicated to shear DNA using a Microson xL 2000 sonicator (3 × 10 s at 30% of the maximum potency). Sonicated cell supernatant was diluted 10 times with 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167 mm NaCl, 0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, and 1.2 mm EDTA. One percent of the supernatant was saved as the input material control. The remaining supernatant was incubated with 4 μg of p65 (sc-372) or p50 (sc-7178) Abs (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) at 4 °C overnight. Immune complexes were collected with salmon sperm-saturated protein A and sequentially washed once with a low-salt immune complex washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and 2 mm EDTA), a high-salt immune complex washing buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.1, 0.5 m NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100 and 2 mm EDTA), a LiCl immune complex washing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 0.25 m LiCl, 1% IGEPAL-CA630, 1% deoxycholic acid, and 1 mm EDTA), and finally washed twice with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA. Immune complexes were then extracted by a 500-μl elution buffer (1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3), and the protein-DNA cross-linking was reverted by heating the samples at 65 °C for 4 h (27Nandiwada S.L. Li W. Zhang R. Mueller D.L. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 401-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). After digestion with 20 μg of proteinase K at 45 °C for 1 h, DNA was extracted by phenol-chloroform followed by ethanol precipitation. An aliquot of ⅓ immunoprecipitated DNA was subjected to PCR using specific TF promoter primers: forward, 5′-GCCCTCCCTTTCCTGCCATAGA-3′ and reverse, 5′-CCTCCCGGTAGGAAACTCCG-3′.Immunoblotting—HUVECs, human monocytes, PVECs, and murine macrophages were treated with plain buffer, DMSO, and 15 μm 4H-Andro or Andro for 12 h followed by stimulation with 0.5 μg/ml LPS, 1,000 units/ml TNF-α, and 0.1 μm PMA for 4 h. Cells were lysed by the sample loading buffer and boiled for 5 min. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and detected with 1 μg/ml anti-mTF polyclonal Ab or Abs to c-Rel and p50 (both from Millipore, Billerica, MA) as well as FLAG tag (M2) and α-tubulin Ab (both from Sigma) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG for chemiluminescent detection as described (16Xia Y.F.

Leukocytes on the endothelium and within the venous wall were counted double blindly under a CX31 microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) at ×1,000 magnification.DVT Model—To induce DVT, C57, B6, or p50 null mice (age 6–8 weeks; weight 20 to 25 g) were anesthetized with intraperitoneal injection of a solution composed of xylazine (12.5 mg/kg), ketamine (125 mg/kg), and atropine (0.025 mg/kg) diluted in an equal volume of saline (0.9% sodium chloride solution). A midline laparotomy was made; the small bowel was exteriorized from the body cavity and moved slightly to the left of the animal, and the inferior vena cava was directly approached by careful blunt dissection (28Myers Jr., D.

Inferior vena cava was ligated below renal veins along with ligation of side branches. The incision was then closed in a two-layer fashion using 5-0 non-reactive suture material. On day 6, the inferior vena cava was removed, weighed, and measured for length. The weight was then normalized to length. For drug treatment experiments, 4H-Andro and Andro (5 μg/g of body weight) were intraperitoneally given 2 h before the surgery.Immunohistochemical and Immunofluorescence Staining—For immunohistochemical staining, tissue sections were subsequently dewaxed and endogenous peroxidase was quenched with 3% H2O2 in methanol. Prior to staining, nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation with 10% bovine serum albumin in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.15 m NaCl, and 0.02% NaN3 (TBS) at 37 °C for 30 min. Tissue sections were incubated with rabbit preimmune IgG (10 μg/ml), rabbit anti-mTF Ab (10 μg/ml), anti-fibrin II β chain monoclonal Ab (clone T2G1; 10 μg/ml; Accurate Chemical, Westbury, NY), rabbit anti-E-selectin polyclonal Ab (6 μg/ml), and anti-VCAM-1 polyclonal Ab (8 μg/ml; BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) in TBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin at 4 °C overnight in a humidified chamber. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or rat IgG Ab (Sigma) was applied at 37 °C for 1 h. After washing, color development was carried out by incubation with 0.05% 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma) in TBS supplemented with 0.1% H2O2 for 10 min. All incubations were followed by washing three times in TBS over 15 min. Tissue sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and slides were finally mounted with coverslip (16Xia Y.F. Ye B.Q.

They were then incubated simultaneously with 10 μg/ml rabbit anti-mTF Ab and mouse anti-smooth muscle α-actin monoclonal antibody (Sigma), 20 μg/ml rat anti-mouse CD41 monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences), and rat anti-mouse CD68 monoclonal antibody (AbD Serotec, Oxford, UK), or 16 μg/ml biotinylated rabbit anti-human von Willebrand factor Ab (Sigma). For gray level analysis after immunostaining, four sites of each vessel and totally four vessels with no hematoxylin staining were analyzed for staining density using the NIH Image (version 1.6) software package.Statistical Analyses—To determine statistical significance, Student's unpaired t test was used for comparison between groups. A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSAndro Suppresses TF in Stimulated Endothelial Cells and Activated Monocytes/Macrophages—Using a rabbit anti-mTF polyclonal Ab, we found that treatment of HUVECs (Fig. 1A), human adherent monocytes (Fig. 1B), murine PVECs (Fig. 1C), and murine peritoneal macrophages (Fig. 1D) stimulated with LPS, TNF-α, and PMA dramatically increased the activity and expression of TF. Compared with DMSO (a solvent control) and 4H-Andro (4-hydro-andrographolide, an inactive structural analog), Andro attenuated the activity and expression of TF in activated human and murine endothelial cells and monocytes/macrophages. Notably, in contrast to rabbit anti-mTF polyclonal Ab that neutralized TF activity, Andro did not affect the activity of TF when it was added directly to lysates of stimulated HUVECs (data not shown). As Andro binds to p50 and inhibits NF-κB activation (16Xia Y.F. Ye B.Q. Li Y.D. Wang J.G. He X.J. Lin X. Yao X. Ma D. Slungaard A. Hebbel R.P. Key N.S. Geng J.G. J.

Here we show that the antibacterial activities of mouse RegIIIγ and its human ortholog, HIP/PAP, are tightly controlled by an inhibitory N-terminal prosegment that is removed by trypsin in vivo. NMR spectroscopy revealed a high degree of conformational flexibility in the HIP/PAP inhibitory prosegment, and mutation of either acidic prosegment residues or basic core protein residues disrupted prosegment inhibitory activity. NMR analyses of pro-HIP/PAP variants revealed distinctive colinear backbone amide chemical shift changes that correlated with antibacterial activity, suggesting that prosegment-HIP/PAP interactions are linked to a two-state conformational switch between biologically active and inactive protein states. These findings reveal a novel regulatory mechanism governing C-type lectin biological function and yield new insight into the control of intestinal innate immunity.

The gastrointestinal tracts of mammals are heavily colonized with vast symbiotic microbial communities and are also a major portal of entry for bacterial pathogens. To cope with these complex microbial challenges, intestinal epithelial cells produce a diverse repertoire of protein antibiotics from multiple distinct protein families (1Mukherjee S. Vaishnava S. Hooper L.V. Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2008; 65: 3019-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These proteins are secreted apically into the luminal environment of the intestine where they play a pivotal role in protecting against enteric infections (2Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P.

Behrendt C.L. Hooper L.V. Science. 2006; 313: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). Similarly, HIP/PAP (hepatointestinal pancreatic/pancreatitis-associated protein; the human ortholog of RegIIIγ) 6The abbreviations used are: HIP/PAP, hepatointestinal pancreatic/pancreatitis-associated protein; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase.6The abbreviations used are: HIP/PAP, hepatointestinal pancreatic/pancreatitis-associated protein; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase. is expressed in the human intestine (6Christa L. Carnot F. Simon M.T. Levavasseur F. Stinnakre M.G. Lasserre C. Thepot D. Clement B. Devinoy E. Brechot C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G993-G1002PubMed Google Scholar) and is up-regulated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (7Ogawa H. Fukushima K. Naito H. Funayama Y. Unno M. Takahashi K. Kitayama T. Matsuno S. Ohtani H. Takasawa S. Okamoto H. Sasaki I. Inflamm. Bowel Dis. 2003; 9: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These proteins are produced in multiple epithelial lineages, including enterocytes and Paneth cells (5Cash H.L. Whitham C.V. Behrendt C.L. Hooper L.V. Science. 2006; 313: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar, 6Christa L. Carnot F. Simon M.T. Levavasseur F. Stinnakre M.G. Lasserre C. Thepot D. Clement B. Devinoy E. Brechot C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G993-G1002PubMed Google Scholar). Both RegIIIγ and HIP/PAP are directly bactericidal at low micromolar concentrations for Gram-positive bacteria (5Cash H.L. Whitham C.V. Behrendt C.L. Hooper L.V. Science. 2006; 313: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar), revealing a previously unappreciated biological function for mammalian lectins. The antibacterial functions of RegIIIγ and HIP/PAP are dependent upon binding bacterial targets through interactions with peptidoglycan (5Cash H.L. Whitham C.V. Behrendt C.L. Hooper L.V. Science. 2006; 313: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). As peptidoglycan is localized on surfaces of Gram-positive bacteria but is buried in the periplasmic space of Gram-negative bacteria, this binding activity provides a molecular explanation for the Gram-positive specific bactericidal effects of these lectins. Although the mechanism of lectin-mediated antibacterial activity remains unclear, RegIIIγ and HIP/PAP have been shown to elicit extensive damage to the cell surfaces of targeted bacteria (5Cash H.L. Whitham C.V. Behrendt C.L. Hooper L.V. Science. 2006; 313: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that C-type lectin bactericidal activity is under stringent post-translational control. RegIIIγ and HIP/PAP each undergo in vivo proteolytic removal of a flexible anionic N-terminal prosegment that maintains the proteins in a biologically inactive state. NMR spectroscopy suggests that the prosegment functions by controlling a two-state conformational switch between the biologically active and inactive states of the protein. We propose that this regulatory mechanism allows the host to restrict expression of RegIII lectin antibacterial activity to the intestinal lumen. Together, our findings represent a unique example of post-translational control of C-type lectin biological activity, and provide novel insight into the regulation of lectin-mediated innate immunity in the mammalian intestine. Purification of Endogenous RegIIIγ—Endogenous RegIIIγ was purified from the small intestines of C57BL/6 mice. Intestinal tissues were homogenized in 20% acetic acid solution containing protease inhibitors using a pre-chilled homogenization probe and lysed by sonication using a Misonix XL sonicator. The extract was dialyzed against 25 mm MES pH 5.0, 25 mm NaCl and was loaded onto a cation exchange column (SP-Sepharose, Sigma). The column was washed with 25 mm MES pH 5.0, 150 mm NaCl, and eluted with 25 mm MES pH 5.0, 500 mm NaCl. The eluate was concentrated and loaded onto a Sephacryl S-100 column (GE Healthcare). RegIIIγ-containing fractions were identified by Western blot, pooled, and purified by passage over immobilized anti-RegIIIγ (8Cash H.L. Whitham C.V. Hooper L.V. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 48: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The eluate was concentrated, transferred to Immobilon P, and subjected to Edman degradation on an ABI494 sequencer (PE Biosystems) to determine the N-terminal sequence. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant pro-RegIIIγ (rpro-RegIIIγ) and rpro-HIP/PAP were expressed and purified as previously described (8Cash H.L. Whitham C.V. Hooper L.V. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 48: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To generate the recombinant processed form of RegIIIγ, a 417-bp amplicon was generated using the rpro-RegIIIγ expression construct (pET3a-RegIIIγ) (8Cash H.L. Whitham C.V. Hooper L.V. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 48: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as template and the specific primers 5′-ATTGCGAGGCATATGAGCAGCTGCCCCAAGGGCTCCC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTATGGGGATCCCTAGGCCTTGAATTTGCAGACATAGGGT-3′ (reverse). The forward primer contained an NdeI restriction site (underlined) for cloning into pET3a. The reverse primer contained the native stop codon followed by an engineered BamHI site (underlined). The amplicon was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into NdeI/BamHI-digested pET3a (Novagen). Similarly, the rHIP/PAP expression construct was generated using pET3a-HIP/PAPmut (8Cash H.L. Whitham C.V. Hooper L.V. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 48: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as template and specific primers 5′-ATTGCGAGGCATATGATTCGATGTCCAAAAGGCTCCAAG-3′ (forward) and 5′-CTATGGTGATCATCAGTGAACTTTGCAGACATAGGGTAACC-3′ (reverse). The forward primer contained an NdeI site (underlined) while the reverse primer contained a BclI site (underlined) after the native stop codon. The amplicon was digested with NdeI and BclI and ligated into NdeI/BamHI-digested pET3a. Point mutations were introduced into rpro-HIP/PAP using the QuikChange II Site-directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and specific primers harboring the desired mutations. Expression and purification of recombinant wild-type and mutant proteins was carried out as previously described (8Cash H.L. Whitham C.V. Hooper L.V. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 48: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Antimicrobial assays and peptidoglycan binding assays were carried out as previously described (5Cash H.L. Whitham C.V. Behrendt C.L. Hooper L.V. Science. 2006; 313: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). Proteins were stored at –20 °C for a maximum of 1 week prior to assay. Immunoblotting—Intestinal extracts were prepared from wild-type C57BL/6 or MMP7–/– mice (Jackson Laboratories) as previously described (5Cash H.L. Whitham C.V. Behrendt C.L. Hooper L.V. Science. 2006; 313: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). Extracts from human intestinal tissues were prepared by extraction in acetic acid as previously described (9Ghosh D. Porter E. Shen B. Lee S.K. Wilk D. Drazba J. Yadav S.P. Crabb J.W. Ganz T. Bevins C.L. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). 20 μg of each extract was loaded onto 15% SDS-PAGE gels and blotted onto Immobilon P (Millipore). Blots were probed with anti-RegIIIγ antiserum (8Cash H.L. Whitham C.V. Hooper L.V. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 48: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and goat anti-rabbit-horseradish peroxidase (Amersham Biosciences), and were detected by chemiluminescence using the Pierce SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent detection kit. In Vitro Trypsin Proteolytic Processing—Recombinant pro-RegIIIγ and pro-HIP/PAP were digested with bovine pancreatic trypsin (Sigma) at a 1:200 molar ratio of trypsin:lectin at 37 °C for 2 h. Proteins were immediately analyzed by SDS-PAGE on 15% gels, and were subjected to N-terminal Edman sequencing. NMR Spectroscopy—To prepare samples for NMR experiments, Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RILP transformed with expression plasmids were grown in M9 minimal media containing 1 g/liter of 15NH4Cl for uniformly 15N-labeled samples, further substituting unlabeled glucose with 3 g/liter of 13C6-glucose for uniformly 15N/13C-labeled samples. RegIIIγ and HIP/PAP were purified as previously described (8Cash H.L. Whitham C.V. Hooper L.V. Protein Expr. Purif. 2006; 48: 151-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Backbone 15N, 13C, and 1H chemical shift assignments of rpro-HIP/PAP were generated from triple resonance NMR data recorded at 25 °C using a cryoprobe-equipped Varian Inova 600 MHz spectrometer. Backbone assignments were made from a 300 μm sample of 15N/13C-labeled protein in 25 mm MES pH 5.5, 25 mm NaCl using standard methods (10Sattler M. Schleucher J. Griesinger C. Prog. NMR Spectrosc. 1999; 34: 93-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1386) Google Scholar). All spectra were processed using NMRPipe (11Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11533) Google Scholar) and analyzed with NMRView (12Johnson B.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 278: 313-352PubMed Google Scholar). RegIIIγ Is Proteolytically Processed by Trypsin in Vivo—Two distinct forms of endogenous RegIIIγ are present in the mouse small intestine (5Cash H.L. Whitham C.V. Behrendt C.L. Hooper L.V. Science. 2006; 313: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). The higher molecular weight form co-migrates at ∼16.5 kDa with recombinant RegIIIγ that lacks its N-terminal secretion signal, while the lower molecular weight form migrates at ∼15 kDa. The presence of the lower molecular weight form suggested that RegIIIγ might be proteolytically processed in vivo. To test this idea we purified endogenous RegIIIγ from mouse small intestine by acid extraction, gel filtration chromatography, and antibody affinity chromatography. Edman sequencing of the purified proteins verified that the higher molecular weight RegIIIγ form indeed harbors an N terminus (Glu27) that is generated by removal of the signal sequence (Fig. 1A). The N terminus of the lower molecular weight form is Ser38, corresponding to the predicted trypsin cleavage site located at Arg37–Ser38 (Fig. 1A). This site is conserved among all mouse and human RegIII family members (Fig. 1B), and is also present in other Reg subfamilies including RegI (13Graf R. Schiesser M. Scheele G.A. Marquardt K. Frick T.W. Ammann R.W. Bimmler D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21028-21038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) of both RegIIIγ forms did not reveal any further modifications of the protein (data not shown). These results indicate that the N terminus of endogenous mouse RegIIIγ is proteolytically processed by trypsin or a trypsin-like protease in vivo. Small intestinal α-defensins are a distinct family of antimicrobial peptides that also undergo N-terminal proteolytic processing. While human α-defensins are processed by trypsin (9Ghosh D. Porter E. Shen B. Lee S.K. Wilk D. Drazba J. Yadav S.P. Crabb J.W. Ganz T. Bevins C.L. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), the processing enzyme for mouse α-defensins is matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) (2Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M. Parks W.C. Science. 1999; 286: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). To verify that MMP-7 is not the processing enzyme for mouse RegIIIγ we performed Western blots on small intestinal tissue extracts from wild-type and MMP7–/– mice. Both RegIIIγ forms were detectable in MMP7–/– mice (Fig. 1C), establishing that MMP-7 is dispensable for RegIIIγ processing. Thus, RegIIIγ and α-defensins are processed by distinct proteases in the mouse small intestine. In the human small intestine, HIP/PAP is the predominantly expressed ortholog of RegIIIγ (6Christa L. Carnot F. Simon M.T. Levavasseur F. Stinnakre M.G. Lasserre C. Thepot D. Clement B. Devinoy E. Brechot C. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 271: G993-G1002PubMed Google Scholar, 14Ogawa H. Fukushima K. Sasaki I. Matsuno S. Am. J. Physiol. Gastrointest. Liver Physiol. 2000; 279: G492-499Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and performs a similar antibacterial function (5Cash H.L. Whitham C.V. Behrendt C.L. Hooper L.V. Science. 2006; 313: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of human small intestinal extract revealed two forms of HIP/PAP with different molecular weights, suggesting that HIP/PAP is also expressed as a pro-protein that is proteolytically processed in vivo (Fig. 1D). Although the small amounts of HIP/PAP present in human tissue presented an obstacle to purification and sequencing, we established that the lower molecular weight form co-migrates with recombinant HIP/PAP engineered to lack the 11 amino acids N-terminal to the predicted Arg37–Ile38 trypsin cleavage site (Fig. 1D). The idea that the HIP/PAP N terminus is processed in vivo by trypsin is supported by two additional observations. First, two trypsin isoforms are produced by human small intestinal epithelia and have been shown to process other intestinal proteins in vivo (9Ghosh D. Porter E. Shen B. Lee S.K. Wilk D. Drazba J. Yadav S.P. Crabb J.W. Ganz T. Bevins C.L. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Second, in vitro incubation of recombinant pro-HIP/PAP (rpro-HIP/PAP) with bovine trypsin (at a 1:200 molar ratio of enzyme to lectin) resulted in quantitative cleavage at Arg37–Ile38 (Fig. 1E). Proteolytic Processing by Trypsin Activates RegIII Lectin Antimicrobial Activity—We next investigated the biological relevance of lectin proteolytic processing. To test the hypothesis that processing regulates RegIII lectin antibacterial activity, we incubated recombinant pro-RegIIIγ (rpro-RegIIIγ) with trypsin in vitro and quantitated antimicrobial activity against Listeria monocytogenes in standard antibacterial assays (5Cash H.L. Whitham C.V. Behrendt C.L. Hooper L.V. Science. 2006; 313: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). Mock-digested rpro-RegIIIγ exhibited limited antibacterial activity, with L. monocytogenes numbers declining by 68% in the presence of 10 μm rpro-RegIIIγ (Fig. 2A). However, trypsin-digested rpro-RegIIIγ exhibited enhanced antibacterial potency, with L. monocytogenes numbers declining by >96% in the presence of 10 μm of digested RegIIIγ (Fig. 2A). A comparison of proteolytically cleaved and uncleaved rpro-HIP/PAP yielded similar results (Fig. 2B). The enhanced activity of trypsin-cleaved HIP/PAP is not attributable to the N-terminal prosegment itself, as addition of 50 μm of synthetic N-terminal peptide to L. monocytogenes did not affect bacterial viability (Fig. 2C). These data demonstrate that removal of the N-terminal prosegment by trypsin enhances RegIIIγ and HIP/PAP antibacterial activity. To further establish that prosegment removal activates lectin antibacterial activity, we generated recombinant forms of RegIIIγ and HIP/PAP that lacked their N-terminal prosegments. 10 μm of recombinant mature RegIIIγ (rRegIIIγ) decreased L. monocytogenes viability by over 99%, as compared with a 12% decrease for rpro-RegIIIγ (Fig. 2D). Similarly, 10 μm of recombinant mature HIP/PAP (rHIP/PAP) killed >99.9% of organisms, as compared with 56% for rpro-HIP/PAP (Fig. 2E). Addition of the HIP/PAP N-terminal prosegment in trans did not reduce the antibacterial activity of rHIP/PAP (Fig. 2F), indicating that the prosegment is inhibitory only when covalently attached (in cis). Peptidoglycan pull-down assays established that prosegment removal did not diminish the ability of either the human or mouse protein to bind peptidoglycan (Fig. 3). Collectively, these data establish that the RegIII lectin N-terminal prosegment inhibits antibacterial activity in cis, but does not affect peptidoglycan binding. We previously reported bactericidal activity for recombinant RegIIIγ and HIP/PAP that were expressed with an intact N-terminal prosegment (5Cash H.L. Whitham C.V. Behrendt C.L. Hooper L.V. Science. 2006; 313: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). To determine why we were able to detect antibacterial activity in these protein preparations, we investigated the fate of the pro-HIP/PAP N terminus during storage. We noted that the rpro-HIP/PAP is labile and the N terminus is progressively removed over time during storage at 4 °C (supplemental Fig. S1). The presence of small amounts of mature HIP/PAP is thus likely to account for the antibacterial activity of protein preparations derived from recombinant prosegment-containing lectins. This may also explain why we detect modest antibacterial activity in rpro-RegIIIγ and rpro-HIP/PAP following mock digestion for 2 h at 37°C (Fig. 2, A and B). N-terminal Acidic Residues Are Essential for Prosegment Inhibitory Activity—We next sought to gain insight into the inhibitory mechanism of the RegIII lectin N-terminal prosegment. We noted the presence of either two or three acidic residues (Glu or Asp) at conserved positions in both mouse and human RegIII family members (Fig. 1B). To evaluate the functional importance of the three acidic residues contained within the HIP/PAP prosegment (Glu27, Glu28, and Glu32), we mutated combinations of these residues to Ala and assessed the mutant rpro-HIP/PAP proteins for antibacterial activity (Fig. 4A). Recombinant pro-HIP/PAP-E32A (10 μm) reduced L. monocytogenes viability by 30%, while rpro-HIP/PAP-EE/AA (harboring E27A and E28A mutations) produced a 75% decline in bacterial colony forming units (CFUs) at the same concentration (Fig. 4B). In contrast, mutation of all three acidic residues (rpro-HIP/PAP-EEE/AAA) yielded a prosegment-containing protein that produced a >99.9% reduction in the viability of L. monocytogenes at a 10 μm concentration (Fig. 4B). This demonstrates that multiple N-terminal acidic residues are essential for HIP/PAP prosegment inhibitory function, and suggests that the degree of inhibitory activity is dictated by charge. Structural Analysis of the HIP/PAP-Prosegment Interaction—Although the crystal structure of pro-HIP/PAP has been determined (15Abergel C. Chenivesse S. Stinnakre M.G. Guasco S. Brechot C. Claverie J.M. Devinoy E. Christa L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 1487-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), it offered limited information about the HIP/PAP-prosegment interaction. In particular, N-terminal residues 27–35 are disordered and thus absent from the structure (Fig. 5A) and residues 36–41 appear to be involved in crystal packing interactions, raising questions about the observed structure of this essential region of the protein. We therefore used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to structurally characterize the interaction between HIP/PAP and its N-terminal prosegment. Using uniformly 15N,13C-labeled pro-HIP/PAP and standard triple resonance methods (16Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. Rance M. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2006Google Scholar) we assigned the chemical shifts of 98% of the backbone resonances. We first analyzed the conformational dynamics of pro-HIP/PAP by measuring 15N relaxation rates, which are influenced by fast (ps-ns) and slow (μs-ms) motions of backbone amides throughout a protein. In particular, we measured rate constants for spin-lattice relaxation (R1), and spin-spin relaxation (R2), finding that the ratio of these values (R1/R2) was highest in residues 27–34 (Fig. 5B). This indicates a high degree of backbone conformational mobility at the N terminus. Furthermore, TALOS analyses of backbone chemical shifts (17Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar) and 1H-1H NOEs indicated that the prosegment adopts an extended structure. Together, these data suggest that the prosegment is flexible and transiently interacts with the rest of the protein. HIP/PAP Basic Residues Are Essential for Prosegment Inhibition of Antibacterial Activity—These findings suggested that the HIP/PAP N-terminal peptide may inhibit antibacterial activity through dynamic interactions with other residues in the HIP/PAP core protein. Given that acidic amino acids in the N terminus are essential for prosegment inhibitory activity, we hypothesized that interactions with nearby HIP/PAP basic residues may be required for repression of antibacterial activity. Because the prosegment is only 11 amino acids in length, we reasoned that it was likely to be constrained to local interactions with amino acids near the trypsin site. Examination of the HIP/PAP primary sequence revealed three basic residues (Arg39, Lys42, Lys45) positioned immediately C-terminal to the Arg37–Ile38 cleavage site (Figs. 1B and 6A). While introduction of a single mutation (R39A) was insufficient to activate antimicrobial activity in rpro-HIP/PAP, mutation of all three basic amino acids to alanine (rpro-HIP/PAP-RKK/AAA) yielded a prosegment-containing variant that exhibited potent antibacterial activity, producing a >99% decline in L. monocytogenes viability (Fig. 6B). Critically, the presence of these mutations had no effect on the antimicrobial activity of the mature protein lacking the prosegment (Fig. 6C). These data demonstrate that basic HIP/PAP residues, positioned C-terminal to the trypsin site, are essential for prosegment inhibitory activity but are dispensable for antibacterial function. Structural Effects of Activating Pro-HIP/PAP Mutations—Overall, these results suggested a model in which the prosegment maintains HIP/PAP in an inactive state through transient interactions between acidic N-terminal residues and basic residues positioned C-terminal to the trypsin site. Mutation of these charged residues derepresses HIP/PAP antibacterial activity in the prosegment-containing protein, thus mimicking the derepression that occurs when the peptide is removed by proteolysis. To further examine this interaction we compared 15N/1H heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra of rpro-HIP/PAP glutamic acid-to-alanine mutants with the wild-type protein (supplemental Fig. S2). We observed significant chemical shift changes (Δδ > 0.05 ppm) only in residues N-terminal to and including Ile38 (Fig. 7A). This verified that the gain-of-function phenotype produced by the EEE/AAA and RKK/AAA mutations did not result from gross protein misfolding. Furthermore, the lack of significant chemical shift changes in the main body of the protein argues against prosegment inhibitory activity being related to global changes in the core HIP/PAP structure. Notably, 15N/1H HSQC spectra of HIP/PAP with and without the wild-type prosegment showed no significant chemical shift changes aside from those at the trypsin cleavage site, confirming that proteolysis itself also does not cause a global conformational change (data not shown). Analysis of peak intensity did not reveal evidence of prosegment-modulated dimer or oligomer formation, even at the high concentration (300 μm) used for NMR spectroscopy (data not shown). However, as these spectra were collected in the absence of ligand, the possibility remains that multimer formation may occur in the presence of peptidoglycan ligands. We noted a striking co-linear pattern of change in key N-terminal backbone amide chemical shifts when comparing the 15N/1H HSQC spectra of rpro-HIP/PAP and single, double or triple glutamic acid-to-alanine mutants. Peaks from Ser35, Ala36, Arg37, and Ile38 shifted in the same direction in each of the rpro-HIP/PAP mutants (Fig. 7B), with the triple EEE/AAA mutant exhibiting chemical shift changes that are close to the additive sum of those observed for the single E32A and double E27A/E28A mutants (Table 1) (18Farmer 2nd, B.T. Constantine K.L. Goldfarb V. Friedrichs M.S. Wittekind M. Yanchunas Jr., J. Robertson J.G. Mueller L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 995-997Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Such a co-linear chemical shift pattern signifies a molecule that is in conformational equilibrium between two states, with intermediate chemical shifts deriving from a population-weighted average of these states (16Cavanagh J. Fairbrother W.J. Palmer A.G. Rance M. Skelton N.J. Protein NMR Spectroscopy: Principles and Practice. Academic Press, San Diego, CA2006Google Scholar). Furthermore, the additivity of these chemical shift changes indicates a simple, non-cooperative interaction between the charges on the prosegment and the rest of the HIP/PAP protein. Notably, similar chemical shift changes for the Ser35–Ile38 segment were observed in the activated rpro-HIP/PAP-RKK/AAA mutant, suggesting that the same conformational change is being triggered from the “opposite” side of the putative charge/charge interaction (Fig. 7B). Close inspection of the 15N/1H HSQC spectrum for this mutant shows that peaks for residues Ser35–Ile38 are doubled on this vector, indicative of further conformational exchange occurring on a slow time scale. Collectively, these data support a model in which perturbation of the interaction between HIP/PAP and its prosegment drives a shift in the conformational equilibrium toward a biologically active state (Fig. 8). Our data further suggest that the degree to which the prosegment shifts the HIP/PAP population to the inactive state is simply determined by the number of intramolecular charge-charge interactions rather than any specific ordering of the prosegment against the core HIP/PAP structure.TABLE 1Simple additivity of chemical shift differences in HIP/PAP E/A mutantsS35A36R37I38ppmppmppmppmE/AaChemical shift differences (ΔδTOT) were obtained using the following equation: ΔδTOT = [Δδ1H)2 + (χ × Δδ15N)2]1/2 (normalized for proton with the scale factor χ = 0.17, established from estimates of atom-specific chemical shift ranges in a protein environment) (14).

Hooper L.V. Science. 2006; 313: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar). However, little is known about how RegIII antibacterial activity is regulated. In this report we show that RegIII lectins are subject to repression by an inhibitory N-terminal prosegment that is removed in vivo by trypsin. This represents a novel regulatory mechanism governing C-type lectin biological activity. The inhibitory activity of the N-terminal segment depends on charge-charge interactions with the main body of the protein. Derepression of antibacterial activity occurs when these interactions are perturbed, either through proteolytic removal of the prosegment or by mutation of the charged residues (Fig. 8). This regulatory mechanism may have evolved to give the host control over the timing and location of the expression of RegIII antibacterial activity. As RegIII lectin antibacterial activity involves damage to microbial cell surfaces (5Cash H.L. Whitham C.V. Behrendt C.L. Hooper L.V. Science. 2006; 313: 1126-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (1066) Google Scholar), it is possible that these proteins could also damage host cell membranes. This would suggest a need to maintain RegIII lectins in an inactive state prior to their luminal release. Two trypsin isozymes are expressed in human gut epithelial cells and are stored as inactive zymogens that are activated by proteolysis in the intestinal lumen (9Ghosh D. Porter E. Shen B. Lee S.K. Wilk D. Drazba J. Yadav S.P. Crabb J.W. Ganz T. Bevins C.L. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). It thus seems likely that trypsin-mediated activation of RegIII proteins occurs only after they are secreted. Given the fact that we were able to detect processed RegIIIγ and HIP/PAP in small intestinal tissue extracts, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of some intracellular cleavage. However, it is likely that this reflects extracellular processing of proteins that are trapped in the mucus layer that overlies the intestinal epithelium. Thus, we propose that this regulatory mechanism evolved to ensure that lectin bactericidal activity is inhibited during intracellular storage, and activated upon secretion into the gut lumen. In the small intestine, members of the α-defensin family of antimicrobial peptides also require activation through proteolytic removal of an N-terminal prosegment by specific intestinal proteases (2Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M. Parks W.C. Science. 1999; 286: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 9Ghosh D.

While trypsin is the processing enzyme for at least one member of the human α-defensin family (9Ghosh D. Porter E. Shen B. Lee S.K. Wilk D. Drazba J. Yadav S.P. Crabb J.W. Ganz T. Bevins C.L. Nat. Immunol. 2002; 3: 583-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), mouse α-defensins undergo processing by matrix metalloproteinase-7 (matrilysin; MMP-7) (2Wilson C.L. Ouellette A.J. Satchell D.P. Ayabe T. Lopez-Boado Y.S. Stratman J.L. Hultgren S.J. Matrisian L.M. Parks W.C. Science. 1999; 286: 113-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). Our findings demonstrate that trypsin coordinately activates multiple innate immune effector proteins in both mice and humans, suggesting that this protease may function as a central regulator of diverse intestinal antibacterial responses in multiple host species. Our results indicate that HIP/PAP prosegment inhibitory activity is governed by interactions between acidic prosegment residues and cationic residues on the remainder of the protein. The prosegments of key intestinal α-defensins confer inhibitory activity through a similar charge-charge interaction (20Weeks C.S. Tanabe H. Cummings J.E. Crampton S.P. Sheynis T. Jelinek R. Vanderlick T.K. Cocco M.J. Ouellette A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28932-28942Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). However, our results suggest that the functional outcome of this interaction is quite different in the two protein families. The α-defensin prosegment neutralizes cationic amino acids that bind to negatively charged bacterial phospholipids and are thus essential for antibacterial function (21Tanabe H. Qu X. Weeks C.S. Cummings J.E. Kolusheva S. Walsh K.B. Jelinek R. Vanderlick T.K. Selsted M.E. Ouellette A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11976-11983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast, while HIP/PAP cationic amino acids are required for peptide inhibitory activity, they are dispensable for antibacterial function, indicating that the HIP/PAP prosegment represses antibacterial activity through a distinct mechanism. This is consistent with our finding that RegIIIγ and HIP/PAP bind to bacterial surfaces through specific recognition of peptidoglycan, and that this binding interaction is not modulated by the prosegment. Collectively, these observations suggest that the RegIII lectins may mediate their antibacterial functions via mechanisms that differ from the α-defensins. NMR spectroscopy has provided structural insight into the HIP/PAP-prosegment interaction. Our analysis revealed a distinctive colinear correspondence between backbone amide shifts as point mutations were made to either side of a putative charge-charge interaction pair. Notably, point mutants with derepressed killing activity demonstrated the greatest degree of chemical shift changes. Such correspondence between structural and functional changes is distinctive, and has previously been observed in several other systems (22Pufall M.A. Lee G.M. Nelson M.L. Kang H.S. Velyvis A. Kay L.E. McIntosh L.P. Graves B.J. Science. 2005; 309: 142-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 23Volkman B.F. Lipson D. Wemmer D.E. Kern D.

Biol. 2008; 15: 613-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The linearity of this behavior further suggests that intramolecular interactions between HIP/PAP and its N-terminal prosegment govern a shift between two states with differing activities. Although the physical basis for this shift is not yet clear, we envision at least three possibilities. One is that disruption of HIP/PAP-prosegment interactions results in allosteric changes in residues that are physically distant from the N terminus. This seems very unlikely given the limited chemical shift changes observed outside the N-terminal region in comparisons of the wildtype and EEE/AAA 15N/1H HSQC spectra. A second possibility is that the activating mutations increase accessibility of the trypsin site to cleavage. However, the lack of HIP/PAP proteolysis in our in vitro antibacterial assays suggests that this is unlikely to explain the enhanced bactericidal activity of the activated pro-HIP/PAP mutants (supplemental Fig. S3). A third possibility is that disruption of the HIP/PAP-prosegment interaction unmasks surfaces on the HIP/PAP core structure that are required for bactericidal activity, and that our chemical shift changes reflect a hinging motion of the prosegment away from the rest of the protein. Such movement could allow the HIP/PAP molecule to adopt an optimal conformation to damage microbial cell surfaces, or could induce formation of multimers that may be required for bactericidal activity (Fig. 8). The latter of these two mechanisms has been observed in other systems in which bactericidal activity requires formation of protein oligomers (25Hoover D.M. Rajashankar K.R. Blumenthal R. Puri A.

Although our NMR spectra did not show evidence of HIP/PAP multimerization at high concentration (300 μm) in the absence of ligand, it is possible that such association requires both the presence of peptidoglycan ligands and the disruption of HIP/PAP-prosegment interactions. In summary, we have uncovered a novel mechanism controlling C-type lectin biological activity. We propose that impaired regulation of RegIII antibacterial activity in human populations could result in compromised intestinal immunity and a predisposition to enteric infections and inflammation. Furthermore, the structural insights from these studies could aid in the design of novel antimicrobial therapeutics. Download .pdf (.5 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2031002779,"The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA)-regulated Cl<sup>–</sup> channel in the apical membrane of epithelial cells. The metabolically regulated and adenosine monophosphate-stimulated kinase (AMPK) is colocalized with CFTR and attenuates its function. However, the sites for CFTR phosphorylation and the precise mechanism of inhibition of CFTR by AMPK remain obscure. We demonstrate that CFTR normally remains closed at baseline, but nevertheless, opens after inhibition of AMPK. AMPK phosphorylates CFTR <i>in vitro</i> at two essential serines (Ser<sup>737</sup> and Ser<sup>768</sup>) in the R domain, formerly identified as ""inhibitory"" PKA sites. Replacement of both serines by alanines (i) reduced phosphorylation of the R domain, with Ser<sup>768</sup> having dramatically greater impact, (ii) produced CFTR channels that were partially open in the absence of any stimulation, (iii) significantly augmented their activation by IBMX/forskolin, and (iv) eliminated CFTR inhibition post AMPK activation. Attenuation of CFTR by AMPK activation was detectable in the absence of cAMP-dependent stimulation but disappeared in maximally stimulated oocytes. Our data also suggest that AMP is produced by local phosphodiesterases in close proximity to CFTR. Thus we propose that CFTR channels are kept closed in nonstimulated epithelia with high baseline AMPK activity but CFTR may be basally active in tissues with lowered endogenous AMPK activity."
https://openalex.org/W2108375974,"Background Embryo retention in the Fallopian tube (FT) is thought to lead to ectopic pregnancy (EP), a considerable cause of morbidity. In mice, genetic/pharmacological silencing of cannabinoid receptor Cnr1, encoding CB1, causes retention of embryos in the oviduct. The role of the endocannabinoids in tubal implantation in humans is not known. Methods and Findings Timed FT biopsies (n = 18) were collected from women undergoing gynecological procedures for benign conditions. Endometrial biopsies and whole blood were collected from women undergoing surgery for EP (n = 11); management of miscarriage (n = 6), and termination of pregnancy (n = 8). Using RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, CB1 mRNA and protein expression levels/patterns were examined in FT and endometrial biopsies. The distribution of two polymorphisms of CNR1 was examined by TaqMan analysis of genomic DNA from the whole blood samples. In normal FT, CB1 mRNA was higher in luteal compared to follicular-phase (p<0.05). CB1 protein was located in smooth muscle of the wall and of endothelial vessels, and luminal epithelium of FT. In FT from women with EP, CB1 mRNA expression was low. CB1 mRNA expression was also significantly lower (p<0.05) in endometrium of women with EP compared to intrauterine pregnancies (IUP). Although of 1359G/A (rs1049353) polymorphisms of CNR1 gene suggests differential distribution of genotypes between the small, available cohorts of women with EP and those with IUP, results were not statistically significant. Conclusions CB1 mRNA shows temporal variation in expression in human FT, likely regulated by progesterone. CB1 mRNA is expressed in low levels in both the FT and endometrium of women with EP. We propose that aberrant endocannabinoid-signaling in human FT leads to EP. Furthermore, our finding of reduced mRNA expression along with a possible association between polymorphism genotypes of the CNR1 gene and EP, suggests a possible genetic predisposition to EP that warrants replication in a larger sample pool."
https://openalex.org/W2126513890,"During their blood meal, ticks secrete a wide variety of proteins that can interfere with their host's defense mechanisms. Among these proteins, lipocalins play a major role in the modulation of the inflammatory response.We previously identified 14 new lipocalin genes in the tick Ixodes ricinus. One of them codes for a protein that specifically binds leukotriene B4 with a very high affinity (Kd: +/-1 nM), similar to that of the neutrophil transmembrane receptor BLT1. By in silico approaches, we modeled the 3D structure of the protein and the binding of LTB4 into the ligand pocket. This protein, called Ir-LBP, inhibits neutrophil chemotaxis in vitro and delays LTB4-induced apoptosis. Ir-LBP also inhibits the host inflammatory response in vivo by decreasing the number and activation of neutrophils located at the tick bite site. Thus, Ir-LBP participates in the tick's ability to interfere with proper neutrophil function in inflammation.These elements suggest that Ir-LBP is a ""scavenger"" of LTB4, which, in combination with other factors, such as histamine-binding proteins or proteins inhibiting the classical or alternative complement pathways, permits the tick to properly manage its blood meal. Moreover, with regard to its properties, Ir-LBP could possibly be used as a therapeutic tool for illnesses associated with an increased LTB4 production."
https://openalex.org/W1968585395,"Myosin light chain phosphatase plays a critical role in modulating smooth muscle contraction in response to a variety of physiologic stimuli. A downstream target of the RhoA/Rho-kinase and nitric oxide (NO)/cGMP/cyclic GMP-dependent kinase (cGKI) pathways, myosin light chain phosphatase activity reflects the sum of both calcium sensitization and desensitization pathways through phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the myosin phosphatase targeting subunit (MYPT1). As cerebral blood flow is highly spatio-temporally modulated under normal physiologic conditions, severe perturbations in normal cerebral blood flow, such as in cerebral vasospasm, can induce neurological deficits. In nonpermeabilized cerebral vessels stimulated with U-46619, a stable mimetic of endogenous thromboxane A2 implicated in the etiology of cerebral vasospasm, we observed significant increases in contractile force, RhoA activation, regulatory light chain phosphorylation, as well as phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr-696, Thr-853, and surprisingly Ser-695. Inhibition of nitric oxide signaling completely abrogated basal MYPT1 Ser-695 phosphorylation and significantly increased and potentiated U-46619-induced MYPT1 Thr-853 phosphorylation and contractile force, indicating that NO/cGMP/cGKI signaling maintains basal vascular tone through active inhibition of calcium sensitization. Surprisingly, a fall in Ser-695 phosphorylation did not result in an increase in phosphorylation of the Thr-696 site. Although activation of cGKI with exogenous cyclic nucleotides inhibited thromboxane A2-induced MYPT1 membrane association, RhoA activation, contractile force, and regulatory light chain phosphorylation, the anticipated decreases in MYPT1 phosphorylation at Thr-696/Thr-853 were not observed, indicating that the vasorelaxant effects of cGKI are not through dephosphorylation of MYPT1. Thus, thromboxane A2 signaling within the intact cerebral vasculature induces ""buffered"" vasoconstrictions, in which both the RhoA/Rho-kinase calcium-sensitizing and the NO/cGMP/cGKI calcium-desensitizing pathways are activated."

The eEF1A subunit is a classic G-protein that acts as a “molecular switch” for the active and inactive states based on whether GTP or GDP is bound, respectively (2Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1991; 349: 117-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (2667) Google Scholar). Once an anticodon-codon match occurs, the ribosome acts as a GTPase-activating factor to stimulate GTP hydrolysis resulting in the release of inactive GDP-bound eEF1A from the ribosome. Because the intrinsic rate of GDP release from eEF1A is extremely slow (3Pittman Y. Valente L. Jeppesen M.G. Andersen G.R. Patel S. Kinzy T.G. J. Biol.

While the G-proteins have a similar topology and consist of three well-defined domains, a striking difference was observed in binding sites for their GEFs. The C terminus of eEF1Bα interacts with domain I and a distinct pocket of domain II eEF1A, creating two binding interfaces. In contrast, the bacterial counterpart EF-Ts and mammalian mitochondrial EF-Tsmt, make extensive contacts with domain I and III of EF-Tu and EF-Tumt, respectively. The altered binding interface of eEF1Bα to domain II of eEF1A is particularly unexpected given the functions associated with domain II of eEF1A and EF-Tu. The crystal structure of the EF-Tu:GDPNP:Phe-tRNAPhe complex reveals aa-tRNA binding to EF-Tu requires only minor parts of both domain II and tRNA to sustain stable contacts (12Nissen P. Kjeldgaard M. Thirup S. Polekhina G. Reshetnikova L. Clark B.F.C. Nyborg J. Science. 1995; 270: 1464-1472Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). That eEF1A employs the same aa-tRNA binding site is supported by genetic and biochemical data (13Kinzy T.G. Freeman J.P. Johnson A.E. Merrick W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1623-1632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Anand M. Valente L. Carr-Schmid A. Munshi R. Olarewaju O. Ortiz P.A. Kinzy T.G. Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant.

Interestingly, eEF1Bα contacts many domain II eEF1A residues in the region hypothesized to be involved in the binding of the aa-tRNA CCA end (8Andersen G.R. Pedersen L. Valente L. Chatterjee I. Kinzy T.G. Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1261-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Because, the shared binding site of eEF1Bα and aa-tRNA on domain II of eEF1A is significantly different between the eukaryotic and bacterial/mitochondrial systems, eEF1Bα may play a unique function aside from guanine nucleotide release in eukaryotes. In eukaroytes, eEF1A is also an actin-binding and -bundling protein. This noncanonical function of eEF1A was initially observed in Dictyostelium amoebae (16Yang F. Demma M. Warren V. Dharmawardhane S. Condeelis J. Nature. 1990; 347: 494-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). It is estimated that greater than 60% of Dictyostelium eEF1A is associated with the actin cytoskeleton (17Edmonds B.T. Bell A. Wyckoff J. Condeelis J. Leyh T.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10288-10295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The eEF1A-actin interaction is conserved among species from yeast to mammals, suggesting the importance of eEF1A for cytoskeleton integrity. Using a unique genetic approach, multiple eEF1A mutations were identified that altered cell growth and morphology, and are deficient in bundling actin in vitro (18Gross S.R. Kinzy T.G. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 19Gross S.R. Kinzy T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 1974-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, most mutations localized to domain II, the shared aa-tRNA and eEF1Bα binding site. Previous studies have demonstrated that actin bundling by eEF1A is significantly reduced in the presence of aa-tRNA while eEF1A bound to actin filaments is not in complex with aa-tRNA (20Liu G. Tang J. Edmonds B.T. Murray J. Levin S. Condeelis J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 953-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Therefore, actin and aa-tRNA binding to eEF1A is mutually exclusive. In addition, overexpression of yeast eEF1A or actin-bundling deficient mutants do not affect translation elongation (18Gross S.R. Kinzy T.G. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 19Gross S.R. Kinzy T.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2007; 27: 1974-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 21Munshi R. Kandl K.A. Carr-Schmid A. Whitacre J.L. Adams A.E. Kinzy T.G. Genetics. 2001; 157: 1425-1436Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting eEF1A-dependent cytoskeletal organization is independent of its translation elongation function (18Gross S.R. Kinzy T.G. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 20Liu G. Tang J. Edmonds B.T. Murray J. Levin S. Condeelis J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 953-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, while aa-tRNA binding to domain II is conserved between EF-Tu and eEF1A, this actin bundling function associated with eEF1A domain II places greater importance on its relationship with the “novel” binding interface between eEF1A domain II and eEF1Bα. Based on this support for an overlapping actin bundling and eEF1Bα binding site in eEF1A domain II, we hypothesize that eEF1Bα modulates the equilibrium between actin and translation functions of eEF1A and is perhaps the result of evolutionary selective pressure to balance the eukaryotic-specific role of eEF1A in actin organization. Here, we present kinetic and biochemical evidence using a F163A mutant of eEF1Bα for the importance of the interactions between domain II of eEF1A and eEF1Bα to prevent eEF1A-dependent actin bundling as well as promoting guanine nucleotide exchange. Furthermore, altered affinities of eEF1Bα mutants for eEF1A support that this complex formation is a determining factor for eEF1A-induced actin organization. Interestingly, the F163A that reduces eEF1A affinity is an intragenic suppressor of the lethal K205A eEF1Bα mutant that displays increased affinity for eEF1A. This, along with a consistent change in the actin bundling correlated with the affinity of eEF1Bα for eEF1A, indicates that eEF1Bα is a balancer, directing eEF1A to translation elongation and away from actin, and alterations in this balance result in detrimental effects on cell growth and eEF1A function.

The resulting plasmids pTKB424 (W130A, tef5-24), pTKB425 (W130A/F163A, tef5-25), pTKB1034 (F163A/K205A, tef5-28), and pTKB778 (W130A/K205A, tef5-29) were transformed into strain TKY406 (MATα ura3-52 trp1-Δ101 lys2-801 leu2-Δ1 his4-713 tef5::TRP1 pTEF5 URA3). Loss of the wild type TEF5 URA3 plasmid was monitored by growth on complete media containing 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) (24Boeke J.D. Trueheart J. Natsoulis G. Fink G.R.

The W130A/K205A eEF1Bα mutant form (pTKB778) could not complement the wild type protein as monitored by its inability to grow on 5-FOA media. The templates for the K205A eEF1Bα mutation were pTKB478 (TEF5 CEN URA3) and pTKB479 (TEF5 2μ URA3), previously described in Ref. 21Munshi R. Kandl K.A. Carr-Schmid A. Whitacre J.L. Adams A.E.

The doubling times were determined by diluting cells to an A600 of 0.1 and monitoring the A600 in liquid YEPD media for 12 h. Liquid growth assays were performed using strains grown at 30 °C in complete media to mid-log phase, diluted to an A600 of 0.04, and grown in triplicate with various concentrations of the translation inhibitor hygromycin B in a 96-well microtiter plate. Plates were incubated with shaking at 30 °C and growth was monitored with a BioTek ELx 800 microtiter reader and reported as the mean of triplicate A600 after 20 h. Total yeast translation was monitored by in vivo [35S]methionine incorporation as previously described (25Carr-Schmid A. Valente L. Loik V.I. Williams T. Starita L.M. Kinzy T.G. Mol. Cell.

The dialyzed 500 mm KCl eluate from the S-Sepharose resin was loaded onto CM52 (Whatman). The column was eluted with a salt gradient of buffer 1 (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, 25% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) with 50 mm to 300 mm KCl using a gradient mixer. Fractions containing eEF1A at greater than 95% purity were identified by SDS-PAGE and dialyzed overnight against 10 volumes of buffer 1 with 100 mm KCl. Wild-type actin was purified from AAY1453 according to published procedures (26Honts J.E. Sandrock T.S. Brower S.M. O'Dell J.L. Adams A.E.M. J.

A pET11d vector expressing the N-terminally His6-tagged eEF1Bα fusion protein (pTKB448) was used to prepare the F163A, W130A, W130A/F163A, and F163A/K205A mutants using the QuikChange method (Stratagene). The resulting plasmids pTKB582 (F163A), pTKB605 (W130A), pTKB581 (W130A/F163A), and pTKB1043 (F163A/K205A) were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21.

Stopped-flow Kinetics Measurements—2′-(or-3′)-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl) guanosine 5′-diphosphate (mant-GDP) was purchased from Molecular Probes and purified as previously described (3Pittman Y.

Using a stopped-flow fluorimeter (KinTek), mant-GDP fluorescence was monitored as previously described. One μm eEF1A and 1 μm mantGDP were rapidly mixed with 45 μm GDP and various concentration of eEF1Bα. At least seven fluorescence trace curves were averaged for each condition, and the resulting averaged curves were fitted to a single or double exponential decay Equation 1, calculating the dissociation rate constants and amplitudes using Sigma Plot version 9 (Systat Software, Inc.), F = F0 + A1e-k1t + A2e-k2t(Eq. 1) where A is the amplitude of each phase, k is the dissociation rate constant of each phase, t is the time, Fo is the final fluorescence value, and F is the fluorescence. Actin Bundling and Phalloidin Staining—Bundling assays were performed by adaptations of procedures previously described (20Liu G. Tang J. Edmonds B.T. Murray J. Levin S. Condeelis J. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 953-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). eEF1A and wild type or mutant His-tagged eEF1Bα forms were dialyzed into buffer 2 (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm GDP, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) for 4 h at 4 °C. Purified G-actin was clarified by centrifugation at 130,000 × g in a Beckman Optima™ TLX Ultracentrifuge for 40 min at 4 °C. G-actin (3 μm) was added to buffer 2 followed by the addition of wild type or mutant eEF1Bα (0.6 μm) and eEF1A (0.3 μm) to a total volume of 100 μl. This mixture was incubated for 18-20 h at 4 °C to allow equilibration. 50 μl of the mixture was centrifuged at low speed (50,000 × g; 36,000 rpm in Beckman Optima™ TLX Ultracentrifuge) for 2 min at 4 °C to assay bundling. Supernatants and pellets were separated in a SDS-PAGE gel and stained with GelCode Blue (Pierce). The densitometry analysis was performed using Image J (Java). Representative data from one of several independent experiments are shown, and standard deviation values were calculated using a minimum of three independent data sets. Fixation, staining, and sample preparation for yeast strains grown in YEPD for 16 h in log phase by continual dilution at 30 °C was performed as previously described (18Gross S.R. Kinzy T.G. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2005; 12: 772-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Cell size populations were quantified using at least one hundred cells counted from at least five different fields in five independent experiments. Graphs are plotted as the average number of cells per size range and show standard deviation values. Growth Defects of a F163A eEF1Bα Mutation Can Be Suppressed with a Second eEF1Bα Mutation—The co-crystal x-ray structure of S. cerevisiae eEF1A with the C terminus of eEF1Bα shows that Phe-163 of eEF1Bα is positioned in a hydrophobic pocket of domain II of eEF1A, which indicates its role in complex formation between eEF1Bα and eEF1A (Fig. 1A) (8Andersen G.R. Pedersen L. Valente L. Chatterjee I. Kinzy T.G. Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1261-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This interaction is likely a prerequisite, but an indirect requirement, for efficient nucleotide exchange activity. To address the significance of eEF1Bα Phe-163 in eEF1A binding, this residue was mutated to alanine providing a mutant form that is functional as the only copy of eEF1Bα. However, the resulting strain displayed a Ts- phenotype (Fig. 1B), reduced translation rates (Fig. 1C), and sensitivity to translation elongation inhibitors (Fig. 1D) (8Andersen G.R. Pedersen L. Valente L. Chatterjee I. Kinzy T.G. Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1261-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The doubling times at the permissive temperature in YEPD media reveal that the F163A strain has a 26% reduction of growth compared with a wild-type strain (3.8 ± 0.3 h versus 2.8 ± 0.1 h). Because F163A was not a lethal mutation; it was hypothesized that another residue may contribute to the binding interface with eEF1A. Three conserved loops of eEF1Bα are in close proximity to the hydrophobic pocket of domain II of eEF1A (8Andersen G.R. Pedersen L. Valente L. Chatterjee I. Kinzy T.G. Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1261-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). Phe-163 and Trp-130 of eEF1Bα are on neighboring loops of the same binding interface (Fig. 1A). To test for a potential overlapping function with Phe-163, the single W130A and W130A/F163A double mutants were prepared and analyzed in vivo. Both mutant forms were functional as the only form of the eEF1Bα protein and the resulting strains did not display any growth defects at 38 °C (Fig. 1B). The doubling times at permissive temperature of both W130A and W130A/F163A eEF1Bα mutant strains were equivalent to the wild type strain (2.7 ± 0.1 h). Because F163A alone has a Ts- defect, these results indicate that W130A completely suppresses the growth defect conferred by the F163A mutant. Strains expressing each of these mutant forms of eEF1Bα were analyzed by Western blot analysis with an eEF1Bα polyclonal antibody and each protein form was stably expressed at 30 and 38 °C (data not shown). Therefore, the growth phenotype was not due to reduced protein expression or stability. The W130A Suppressor Only Partially Corrects the Translation Elongation Function of the F163A eEF1Bα Mutant Independent of an eEF1A Binding Defect—To determine if the intragenic suppression of the F163A growth defect by W130A is linked to the translation function of eEF1Bα, strains expressing wild-type or mutant forms of the protein were examined for an effect on total protein synthesis by [35S]methionine incorporation. The F163A eEF1Bα mutant strain shows a 30% reduction in total translation at the permissive temperature (8Andersen G.R. Pedersen L. Valente L. Chatterjee I. Kinzy T.G. Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1261-1266Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). The W130A mutant alone conferred no translation defect, correlating with the lack of a growth phenotype (Fig. 1C). The double mutant W130A/F163A only partially suppresses the F163A translational defect (Fig. 1C). Translation defects were further analyzed by observing the sensitivity of the eEF1Bα mutant strains to the translation elongation inhibitor hygromycin B using a liquid microtiter growth assay. The strain expressing W130A/F163A eEF1Bα showed resistance to this inhibitor intermediate between the F163A and wild-type eEF1Bα strains (Fig. 1D). These data indicate that the complete growth suppression of the F163A mutation observed in a W130A/F163A double mutant strain is only partially due to suppressing the effects on protein biosynthesis. To examine if the eEF1Bα mutations alter nucleotide exchange activity, and in particular if the suppression of the F163A growth defect by W130A is due to enhanced GDP release from eEF1A, stopped flow kinetic analysis was performed. The rate of GDP release over time from eEF1A in the presence of 5 mm Mg2+, excess GDP and different forms of eEF1Bα was determined. To reach saturating conditions and determine the maximal dissociation rate constant of the mantGDP:eEF1A complex catalyzed by the eEF1Bα mutants, experiments were performed with varying concentrations of eEF1Bα. The dissociation rate constants were plotted against the eEF1Bα concentration and fitted to a hyperbolic curve to obtain the apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of the eEF1A:eEF1Bα complex and the maximal dissociation rate constant (koff) values of GDP (Table 2 and Fig. 1E). The maximal dissociation rate constant of the mantGDP: eEF1A complex under saturating conditions of the F163A mutant form of eEF1Bα is 4.3 ± 0.3 s-1 (Fig. 1E), which is 28-fold slower than the wild-type complex (122 ± 8 s-1) (3Pittman Y. Valente L. Jeppesen M.G. Andersen G.R. Patel S. Kinzy T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19457-19468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This is likely the result of a 6.5-fold increase in the Kd for eEF1A (25.7 ± 6.9 μm) compared with wild-type eEF1Bα (4 ± 0.8 μm) (3Pittman Y. Valente L. Jeppesen M.G. Andersen G.R. Patel S. Kinzy T.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19457-19468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1E). On the other hand, the W130A mutant form enhances the mantGDP dissociation rate by 2-fold (230.9 ± 20 s-1) compared with the wild-type protein (Fig. 1E). The apparent Kd value of the W130A form for the mantGDP:eEF1A complex is 2.6 ± 0.9 μm, which is essentially the same as wild-type eEF1Bα. The F163A/W130A double mutant suppresses the F163A GDP release activity 2-fold (7.8 ± 0.6 s-1) in the presence of 5 mm Mg2+ (Fig. 1E). The Kd value of the W130A/F163A for the mantGDP:eEF1A complex, however, is 25.5 ± 7 μm (Fig. 1E). This is equivalent to the F163A eEF1Bα:eEF1A complex. Together, these results argue that F163 of eEF1Bα is important for binding stability to eEF1A domain II while W130A partially restores the reduced rate at which the F163A eEF1Bα catalyzes GDP release from eEF1A.TABLE 2Stopped-flow kinetics values for different forms of the eEF1A:eEF1Bα complexeEF1BαMaximal koff of GDPKd of complexSources−1μmWild type122.0 ± 8.04.0 ± 0.8(3Pittman Y.

Interestingly, comparing the above maximal koff result for the F163A mutation (4.3 s-1, Fig. 1E) to the published stopped-flow analysis for K205A eEF1Bα mutant, indicates that the inviable K205A mutant has a higher maximal koff for GDP of 8.0 s-1 (3Pittman Y.

Even at various Mg2+ concentrations, the dissociation rate constants of mantGDP from eEF1A:K205A eEF1Bα are always higher when compared with the complex with F163A eEF1Bα (data not shown). These findings support the hypothesis that the lethal phenotype of K205A is not solely due to reduced exchange activity of eEF1Bα, but rather due to the 10-fold reduction in the Kd for eEF1A (3Pittman Y.

Although the precise role of this post-translational modification is unclear, marking P450s for degradation is plausible. Indeed, we have found that after structural inactivation, CYP3A4, the major human liver P450, and its rat orthologs are phosphorylated during their ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation.

Of these, human CYP3A4 is the most dominant liver enzyme, accounting for >30% of the hepatic microsomal P450 complement, and responsible for the oxidative metabolism of over 50% of clinically relevant drugs (1Guengerich F.P.

Consistent with this CYP3A ERAD process, our studies of in vivo and/or in vitro reconstituted systems have led us to conclude that CYPs 3A are ubiquitinated by the UBC7/gp78 Ub-ligase complex and recruited by the p97-Npl4-Ufd1 complex before their degradation by the 26 S proteasome (4Murray B.P.

However, inclusion of γ-S-[32P]ATP in an in vitro reconstituted CYP3A4 ubiquitination system catalyzed by rat liver cytosolic fraction II (FII) resulted in CYP3A4 protein phosphorylation, i.e. γ-[32P]phosphoryl transfer onto CYP3A4 target residues (13Korsmeyer K.K.

The physiological role, if any, of this CYP3A4 post-translational modification is unclear. CYP3A4 is not the only P450 that is phosphorylated. Since the in vitro phosphorylation of a hepatic P450 (CYP2B4) by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) was first described (15Pyerin W. Wolf C.R. Kinzel V. Kubler D. Oesch F. Carcinogenesis. 1983; 4: 573-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), various P450s, particularly those belonging to the subfamily 2, were documented to be phosphorylated in cell-free systems, hepatocyte incubations, and intact animals (16Taniguchi H.

Common features of such P450 phosphorylation were the presence of a cytosolically exposed PKA recognition sequence (RRXS) with the Ser residue as the exclusive kinase target, and the ensuing loss of prosthetic heme, conversion to the inactive P420 species, and consequent dramatic functional inactivation (15Pyerin W.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3003-3010Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Studies in intact rats also identified CYPs 3A and 2C6 as kinase targets (21Koch J.A. Waxman D.J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3145-3152Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Although both these P450s lack the hallmark PKA recognition sequence, apparently they possess secondary PKA targeting sequences or are phosphorylated by other protein kinases such as PKC. Indeed, in vitro studies revealed that P450s were phosphorylated in an isoform-dependent manner by either PKA or PKC, except for CYP2B1, which was heavily phosphorylated by both (20Pyerin W. Taniguchi H. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 3003-3010Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Over the years since this particular post-translational P450 modification was recognized, it has been assigned various functional roles (17Vilgrain I. Defaye G. Chambaz E.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Stier A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1985; 34: 1835-1837Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and later explored both by Eliasson et al. (23Eliasson E. Johansson I. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Biochem.

Biophys. 1999; 365: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 14Wang X. Medzihradszky K.F. Maltby D. Correia M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11318-11326Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), P450 phosphorylation served as a marker for its degradation. Accordingly, the phosphorylation of CYP2E1Ser129 and CYP3A1Ser393 by a microsomal cAMP-dependent protein kinase has been proposed to predispose these P450s but not the similarly phosphorylated CYP2B1 to proteolytic degradation by an integral ER Mg2+-ATP-activated serine protease (23Eliasson E.

However, heterologous expression of CYP2E1S129A/S129G site-directed mutants in COS7 cells apparently had no effect on its relative stability thereby revealing that if CYP2E1 phosphorylation is important for its degradation (34Freeman J.E. Wolf C.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13963-13966Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 35Oesch-Bartlomowicz B. Padma P.R. Becker R. Richter B. Hengstler J.G. Freeman J.E. Wolf C.R. Oesch F. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 242: 294-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), then alternate Ser/Thr residues (i.e. in plausible secondary PKA recognition sites, Lys-Lys-Ser209-Lys and Lys-Lys-Ser449-Ala) may be recruited. On the other hand, on the basis of rapid phosphorylation of CuOOH-inactivated CYP3A4 that precedes its ubiquitination and 26 S proteasomal degradation in an in vitro liver cytosolic FII-catalyzed system, we have proposed that CYP3A4 phosphorylation was essential for targeting it to proteins participating in its UPD/ERAD (13Korsmeyer K.K. Davoll S. Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Correia M.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 365: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Indeed, several examples of similar phosphorylation for targeting proteins to UPD exist, of which IκBα phosphorylation is the most notable and perhaps the best documented (36Willems A.R. Lanker S.

Our in vitro studies with specific kinase inhibitors as probes identified both PKC and PKA as the major FII kinases responsible for CYP3A4 phosphorylation (14Wang X. Medzihradszky K.F. Maltby D. Correia M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11318-11326Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Indeed, in vitro model studies of CYP3A4 with PKC as the kinase, coupled with lysylendopeptidase C (Lys-C) digestion of the phosphorylated protein and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) analyses of the Lys-C digests, identified two PKC-phosphorylated CYP3A4 peptides 258ESRLEDpTQK266 and 414FLPERFpSK421 unambiguously phosphorylated at Thr264 and Ser420 (14Wang X. Medzihradszky K.F. Maltby D. Correia M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11318-11326Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These same residues were also phosphorylated in corresponding studies with PKA. 4X. Wang, K. F. Medzihradzsky, and M. A. Correia, unpublished observations. Furthermore, although both native and CuOOH-inactivated CYP3A4 were phosphorylated at Thr264, Ser420 phosphorylation was particularly enhanced after CuOOH-mediated CYP3A4 inactivation (14Wang X. Medzihradszky K.F. Maltby D. Correia M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11318-11326Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Corresponding studies of CuOOH-inactivated CYP3A4 using rat liver cytosolic FII as the source of the kinase(s), revealed 32P phosphorylation of both these peptides as well as that of an additional CYP3A4 peptide 477LS(p)LGGLLQPEKPVVLK492. Unlike the unambiguous mass spectrometric identification of Thr264 and Ser420 as the phosphorylated CYP3A4 residues, the phosphorylation of Ser478, the only plausible phosphorylatable residue in this 32P-labeled peptide, was not similarly established. Nevertheless, the predominant phosphorylation of Thr264 in native CYP3A4 (14Wang X. Medzihradszky K.F. Maltby D. Correia M.A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 11318-11326Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), but of two additional residues in the CuOOH-inactivated enzyme, is consistent with the inactivation-induced structural unraveling of this enzyme with exposure of otherwise concealed and/or kinase-inaccessible domains (48Yano J.K. Wester M.R. Schoch G.A. Griffin K.J. Stout C.D. Johnson E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38091-38094Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). Such unraveling of CYP3A4 protein stems from the irreversible modification of its active site by fragments generated from CuOOH-mediated oxidative destruction of its prosthetic heme (49He K. Bornheim L.M. Falick A.M. Maltby D. Yin H. Correia M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17448-17457Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In this study, using mass spectrometric analyses of Lys-C digests of FII-phosphorylated CYP3A4, we have provided unambiguous evidence that in addition to Thr264 and Ser420, Ser478 is indeed phosphorylated. More importantly, through alanine-scanning mutagenesis of these three residues, we now document that although neither the structural conformation nor the catalytic function of this triple CYP3A4T264A/S420A/S478A mutant is altered, its degradation after heterologous expression in S. cerevisiae is significantly impaired. This is also true of CYP3A4T264A/S420A/S478A mutant degradation in human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells. Furthermore, using an in vitro reconstituted CYP3A4 ubiquitination system, catalyzed by human Ub-conjugating E2 enzyme UBC7 and integral ER protein gp78 as the E3 Ub ligase (12Pabarcus, M., Hoe, N., Sadeghi, S., Patterson, C., Wiertz, E., and Correia, M. A. (December 10, 2008) Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 10.1016/j.abb. 2008.12.001Google Scholar), we document that PKA/PKC-mediated phosphorylation of the wild type CYP3A4 (CYP3A4wt) considerably enhanced its UBC7/gp78-mediated ubiquitination. Together these findings reveal the critical importance of CYP3A4 phosphorylation at these residues for its UPD and suggest a direct link between phosphorylation and its ubiquitination and degradation.

Both plasmids were gifts from Dr. A. M. Weissman. All other buffers and reagents were of the highest commercial grade. Alanine-scanning Mutagenesis—To determine the role of the three phosphorylated CYP3A4 Thr264, Ser420, and Ser478 residues in CYP3A4 degradation, single, double, and triple mutations of these three amino acids to Ala were introduced into expression vectors by Quick-Change site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). PCR amplification was performed using mutant sense and antisense primers with pYES2-ADH-3A4-CYC as a template to produce mutant CYP3A4 constructs for heterologous expression in yeast strains. Corresponding mutations were also introduced first into pGEM-3A4(His)6 vector, and then the mutant CYP3A4(His)6 construct was cloned into pCWori+ vector to generate the mutant constructs for expression in E. coli DH5αF strain. The primers used in mutagenesis and the mutant constructs are described (Table 1). The authenticity of each plasmid construct, the presence of the desired mutation, and the absence of extraneous mutations were verified by DNA sequencing.TABLE 1Primers and mutant constructs used in this studyConstructsPrimersTemplatesExpression systemSingle pYES2-ADH-3A4-CYC mutants T264ASense, GTCGCCTCGAAGATgCACAAAAGCACCGAGpYES2-ADH-3A4-CYCYeastAntisense, CTCGGTGCTTTTGTGcATCTTCGAGGCGAC S420ASense, GTTCCTCCCTGAAAGATTCgcCAAGAAGAACAAGGACAACpYES2-ADH-3A4-CYCYeastAntisense, GTTGTCCTTGTTCTTCTTGgcGAATCTTTCAGGGAGGAAC S478ASense, AGATCCCCCTGAAATTAgcCTTAGGAGGACTTCTTCAACpYES2-ADH-3A4-CYCYeastAntisense, GTTGAAGAAGTCCTCCTAAGgcTAATTTCAGGGGGATCTDouble pYES2-ADH-3A4-CYC mutants T264A/S420ASense, GTTCCTCCCTGAAAGATTCgcCAAGAAGAACAAGGACAACpYES2-ADH-3A4T264A-CYCYeastAntisense, GTTGTCCTTGTTCTTCTTGgcGAATCTTTCAGGGAGGAAC T264A/S478ASense, AGATCCCCCTGAAATTAgcCTTAGGAGGACTTCTTCAACpYES2-ADH-3A4T264A-CYCYeastAntisense, GTTGAAGAAGTCCTCCTAAGgcTAATTTCAGGGGGATCT S420A/S478ASense, AGATCCCCCTGAAATTAgcCTTAGGAGGACTTCTTCAACpYES2-ADH-3A4TS420A-CYCYeastAntisense, GTTGAAGAAGTCCTCCTAAGgcTAATTTCAGGGGGATCTTriple pYES2-ADH-3A4-CYC mutants T264A/S420A/S478ASense, AGATCCCCCTGAAATTAgcCTTAGGAGGACTTCTTCAACpYES2-ADH-3A4T264AS420A-CYCYeastAntisense, GTTGAAGAAGTCCTCCTAAGgcTAATTTCAGGGGGATCTSingle, double, or triple pCW3A4His6 mutants T264ASense, GTCGCCTCGAAGATgCACAAAAGCACCGAGpGEM-3A4-His6DH5αFAntisense, CTCGGTGCTTTTGTGcATCTTCGAGGCGAC S420ASense, GTTCCTCCCTGAAAGATTCgcCAAGAAGAACAAGGACAACpGEM-3A4-His6DH5αFAntisense, GTTGTCCTTGTTCTTCTTGgcGAATCTTTCAGGGAGGAAC S478ASense, AGATCCCCCTGAAATTAgcCTTAGGAGGACTTCTTCAACpGEM-3A4-His6DH5αFAntisense, GTTGAAGAAGTCCTCCTAAGgcTAATTTCAGGGGGATCT T264A/S420ASense, GTTCCTCCCTGAAAGATTCgcCAAGAAGAACAAGGACAACpGEM-3A4-T264A-His6DH5αFAntisense, GTTGTCCTTGTTCTTCTTGgcGAATCTTTCAGGGAGGAAC T264A/S478ASense, AGATCCCCCTGAAATTAgcCTTAGGAGGACTTCTTCAACpGEM-3A4-T264A-His6DH5αFAntisense, GTTGAAGAAGTCCTCCTAAGgcTAATTTCAGGGGGATCT S420A/S478ASense, AGATCCCCCTGAAATTAgcCTTAGGAGGACTTCTTCAACpGEM-3A4-S420A-His6DH5αFAntisense, GTTGAAGAAGTCCTCCTAAGgcTAATTTCAGGGGGATCT T264A/S420A/S478ASense, AGATCCCCCTGAAATTAgcCTTAGGAGGACTTCTTCAACpGEM-3A4-T264AS420A-His6DH5αFAntisense, GTTGAAGAAGTCCTCCTAAGgcTAATTTCAGGGGGATCT Open table in a new tab E. coli Expression of CYP3A4(His)6 and Its Ala Mutants—Wild type, C-terminally His6-tagged CYP3A4 (CYP3A4wt) was generated as described (14Wang X.

https://openalex.org/W1963754847,"The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway plays an important role in prostate development and appears to play an equally important role in promoting growth of advanced prostate cancer. During prostate development, epithelial cells in the urogenital sinus (UGS) express Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) and secrete Shh peptide. The secreted Hh peptide acts on adjacent mesenchymal cells to activate the Hh signal transduction pathway and elicit paracrine effects on epithelial proliferation and differentiation. To identify mesenchymal targets of Shh signaling, we performed microarray analysis on a Shh-responsive, immortalized urogential sinus mesenchymal cell line. We found 68 genes that were up-regulated by Shh and 21 genes that were down-regulated. Eighteen of those were selected for further study with Ptc1 and Gli1 serving as reference controls. We found 10 of 18 were also Hh-regulated in primary UGS mesenchymal cells and 13 of 18 in the cultured UGS. Seven of 18 exhibited Shh-regulated expression in both assays (Igfbp-6, Igfbp-3, Fbn2, Ntrk3, Agpt4, Dmp1, and Mmp13). Three of the 18 genes contained putative Gli binding motifs that bound Gli1 peptide in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. With the exception of Tiam1, target gene expression generally showed no differences in the concentration dependence of ligand-induced expression, but we observed strikingly different responses to direct pathway activation by transfection with activated Smo, Gli1, and Gli2.

McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3059-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (2509) Google Scholar). During fetal prostate development, Shh is expressed and secreted by the epithelium of the urogenital sinus (UGS) and acts on the surrounding mesenchyme (2Podlasek C.A. Barnett D.H. Clemens J.Q.

Binding of Hh ligand to its receptor Patched 1 (Ptc1), a 12-span transmembrane protein, activates an intracellular signal transduction mechanism involving a second transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo), and results in changes in transcriptional regulation of specific target genes through the coordinated activities of three highly related Gli transcription factors (Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3) (6Hooper J.E. Scott M.P. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 6: 306-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar).

Emerging evidence suggests that proper spatial and temporal patterns of Hh signaling are required for normal prostate ductal development (1Ingham P.W. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3059-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (2509) Google Scholar, 10Shaw A. Bushman W. J. Urol. 2007; 177: 832-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Although the diversity of Shh effects is clear, molecules that function downstream of Shh in different contexts remains incompletely characterized. Gli1, Ptc1, and Hedgehog interacting protein are the canonical targets of Hh signaling expressed in nearly all cell types examined to date (11Chuang P.T. McMahon A.P. Nature. 1999; 397: 617-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (634) Google Scholar). However, other target genes regulated by the Shh signaling pathway likely vary between tissues and cell types, influenced by the state of differentiation and the presence or absence of co-regulators (1Ingham P.W. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3059-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (2509) Google Scholar, 12Ingham P.W. Placzek M. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2006; 7: 841-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). A number of target genes have been described. The actin-binding protein Missing in Metastasis (MIM) has been identified as a Shh-responsive gene that potentiates Gli-dependent transcriptional activation in skin development and tumorigenesis (13Callahan C.A. Ofstad T. Horng L. Wang J.K. Zhen H.H. Coulombe P.A. Oro A.E. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 2724-2729Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The forkhead transcription factor Foxe1 was established as a downstream target of the Shh pathway in hair follicle morphogenesis (14Eichberger T. Regl G. Ikram M.S. Neill G.W. Philpott M.P.

For the developing prostate, however, the only target gene identified thus far is Igfbp-6 (24Lipinski R.J. Cook C.H. Barnett D.H. Gipp J.J. Peterson R.E. Bushman W. Dev. Dyn. 2005; 233: 829-836Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We performed a microarray analysis to identify Shh-induced transcriptional changes in a previously characterized, immortalized UGS mesenchymal cell line, UGSM-2 (9Shaw A. Papadopoulos J. Johnson C. Bushman W. Prostate. 2006; 66: 1347-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We identified a combination of previously described and novel Shh targets, some of which appear to be prostate selective. The novel Shh-responsive genes provide insight into the molecular mechanism of Shh-regulated prostate development, suggesting roles in cell growth regulation as well as in providing cross-talk with the Wnt and Notch signaling pathways. Microarray Cell Growth and RNA Isolation—UGSM-2 cells, an immortalized mouse E16 prostate mesenchymal cell lines (10Shaw A. Bushman W. J. Urol. 2007; 177: 832-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), were set at confluence and allowed to attach overnight in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The next day cells were treated with Shh (R&D Systems 1845-SH/CF) or vehicle in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum. Following 24 h treatment total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy RNA isolation kit with on column DNase treatment and eluted in nuclease-free water. Microarray cDNA Synthesis—First strand synthesis was performed using the SuperScript Choice system (Invitrogen). The manufacturer's protocol was modified by using a high performance liquid chromatography purified T7-(dT)24 primer (Genset Corp.) and incubating at 42 °C. The 20-μl first-strand reactions consisted of 100 pmol of T7-(dT)24 primer, 10 μg of total RNA, 1× first-strand buffer, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 500 μm each dNTP, and 400 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase. The 150-μl second-strand reactions included 1× second-strand reaction buffer, 200 μm each dNTP, 10 units of DNA ligase, 40 units of DNA polymerase I, and 2 units of RNase H. A phenol/chloroform extraction using phase lock gels (Eppendorf-5 Prime, Inc.) and ethanol precipitation were used to purify the double-stranded cDNA. Microarray Synthesis of Biotin-labeled cRNA—An in vitro transcription reaction was performed starting with 5 μl of purified cDNA using the Enzo BioArray high yield RNA transcript labeling kit (Affymetrix). The in vitro transcription product was purified using RNeasy spin columns (Qiagen). 20 μg of cRNA was fragmented (0.5 μg/μl) according to Affymetrix instructions. Microarray Hybridization—Quantification of the cRNA was adjusted to reflect carryover of unlabeled total RNA with an equation provided by Affymetrix: adjusted cRNA yield = cRNA measured after in vitro transcription (μg) – (starting amount of total RNA) × (fraction of cDNA reaction used in in vitro transcription). 20 μg of adjusted fragmented cRNA was added to 300 μl of hybridization mixture that included 0.1 mg/ml herring sperm DNA (Promega/Fisher), 0.5 mg/ml acetylated bovine serum albumin (Invitrogen), and 2× MES hybridization buffer (Sigma). The mixture also contained the following hybridization controls: 50 pm oligonucleotide B2 (Genset Corp.) and 1.5, 5, 25, and 100 pm cRNA BioB, BioC, BioD, and Cre, respectively (ATCC). 200 μl of this mixture was hybridized to the chips (mouse genome 430 2.0 Array) with 24 × 24-μm probe cells for 16 h according to Affymetrix procedures. The 50 × 50-μm test chips were hybridized with 80 μl for 16 h. Microarray Washing, Staining, and Scanning—The probe arrays were washed with stringent (100 mm MES, 0.1 m [Na+], 0.01% Tween 20) and non-stringent (6× SSPE, 0.01% Tween 20, 0.005% antifoam) buffers in the Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics station using pre-programmed Affymetrix protocols. The probe arrays were then stained with streptavidin phycoerythrin, and the signal amplified using an antibody solution. The streptavidin stain contained 2× stain buffer (final 1× concentration 100 mm MES, 1 m [Na+], 0.05% Tween 20, 0.005% antifoam, 2 μg/μl acetylated bovine serum albumin, and 10 μg/ml streptavidin (Molecular Probes)). The antibody amplification solution contained 2× stain buffer, 2 μg/μl acetylated bovine serum albumin (Invitrogen), 0.1 mg/ml normal goat IgG (Sigma), and 3 μg/ml biotinylated antibody (Vector Laboratories). Staining was done in the GeneChip fluidics station using pre-programmed Affymetrix protocols. The probe arrays were scanned in the Affymetrix GeneChip scanner. Microarray Data Analysis—Microarray analysis using Affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 chip was performed in triplicate using RNA from Shh-treated and control cells. Six data files (triplicate of control and Shh-treated samples) were uploaded into Affymetrix Suite 5.0 (MAS5) software. Unknown expressed sequence tags were identified by searching human genome databases. Genes whose signal intensity were lower than 40 were eliminated from further analyses because the signal was not significantly different from base line (no signal). Data with more than 2 present calls in either the control or Shh-treated group were selected for further analysis. Mean signals of the controls and Shh-treated samples were calculated and compared. Student's t tests were performed and genes with p < 0.05 were selected for further analysis. Fold change was calculated by comparing signals from the Shh-treated group with signals from the control group. Genes showing fold changes greater than ±2 were selected. Cell Treatment for Array Gene Validation—To validate the array data and to examine the Shh response of the array-identified genes several cells lines were used. All cells were treated at confluence for 24 h ±50 nm Shh (R&D Systems catalog number 1845-SH/CF) and ±5 μm cyclopamine (Toronto Research Chemicals) as described above for the microarray. Following treatment, RNA was isolated with Qiagen RNeasy kit with on-column DNase treatment as per the manufacturers protocol. UGSM-2 cells were grown and treated as described above for the array. Mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) were isolated and grown as previously described (25Lipinski R.J. Gipp J.J. Zhang J. Doles J.D. Bushman W. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 1925-1938Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 26Doles J.D. Vezina C.M. Lipinski R.J. Peterson R.E. Bushman W. Prostate. 2005; 65: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Balb/c 3T3 fibroblast were obtained from ATCC and grown according to ATCC protocols. Primary UGM cells were made from the mouse E16 mesenchyme, as described (9Shaw A. Papadopoulos J. Johnson C. Bushman W. Prostate. 2006; 66: 1347-1358Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Primary cells were in culture for 1 week to expand them before exposure to Shh and cyclopamine. All experiments were performed in triplicate and reported differences were statistically significant (p < 0.05; Student's t test). Prostate Organ Culture—E16 UGS tissues were isolated from CD-1 mice (Charles River) placed on Millicell-CM filters (Millipore) and grown in serum-free media with supplements as described (26Doles J.D. Vezina C.M. Lipinski R.J. Peterson R.E. Bushman W. Prostate. 2005; 65: 390-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Tissues were incubated for 3 days ±10 μm cyclopamine; RNA was harvested with Qiagen RNeasy columns as per the manufacturers recommendations. Effect of Gli1, Gli2, Smo Overexpression, and Forskolin Treatment—UGSM-2 cells were infected with retrovirus that expressed green fluorescent protein alone or co-expressed green fluorescent protein and Gli1, Gli2, or Smo. Cells overexpressing green fluorescent protein were identified by flow cytometry and analyzed for expression of the gene of interest. These cells were grown to confluence, maintained at confluence for 24 h, and RNA harvested as described above. To examine the effect of forskolin, UGSM-2 cells were treated with or without 50 μm forskolin (LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA) during the 24-h period of confluence. Gene Expression Analysis by Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—Following RNA isolation reverse transcriptase-PCR was performed with gene specific primers (supplemental data Table S1) with normalization to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase for each sample. Total RNA was reverse transcribed with Moloney murine leukemia virus-reverse transcriptase following standard protocols followed by real time PCR. PCR products were detected with Power SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) using a Bio-Rad iCycler thermocycler. Immunofluorescence Staining—UGS and prostate tissue sections were fixed with 10% formalin, embedded in paraffin, and processed for immunofluorescence staining (27Garrett W.M. Guthrie H.D. Biochemica. 1998; 1: 17-20Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: rabbit anti-Tiam1 polyclonal antibody (1:250, Calbiochem) and mouse anti-smooth muscle actin (1:200, Sigma). Sections were 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole counterstained, coverslipped, and imaged. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed as previously described (21Yoon J.W. Kita Y. Frank D.J. Majewski R.R. Konicek B.A. Nobrega M.A. Jacob H.

Whole Mount in Situ Hybridization—The following cDNAs were used as probes: Igfbp-3 (accession number BC058261), Timp3 (accession number BC014713), Plxna2 (accession number BC051045), Cxcl14 (accession number BC0799661), and Dner (accession number BC034634). Those plasmids were linearized, and digoxigenin-labeled probes were prepared by transcription using T7 or T3 RNA polymerase in the presence of DIG RNA labeling mixture. In situ hybridizations were performed as previously described (3Lamm M.L. Catbagan W.S. Laciak R.J. Barnett D.H. Hebner C.M. Gaffield W. Walterhouse D. Iannaccone P. Bushman W. Dev. Biol. 2002; 249: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The stained tissues were incubated with 30% sucrose at 4 °C overnight, embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound and cryosectioned at 10 μm. Identification of Shh Target Genes in UGS Mesenchyme—To identify Shh target genes in the mesenchyme of the developing prostate, we performed microarray analysis in triplicate using RNA from UGSM-2 cells cultured for 24 h in the presence or absence of Shh. Genes showing significantly different signal intensities (p < 0.05) and fold changes greater than ±2 following treatment with Shh were selected. A total of 89 genes were identified by the array: 68 were up-regulated by Shh and 21 were down-regulated (Table 1). Eighteen of the genes whose transcription was significantly altered by Shh in UGSM-2 cells, including 14 up-regulated genes and 4 down-regulated genes, were selected for further study (Table 2).TABLE 1Genes regulated by Shh in UGSM-2 cells after 24 h treatment Open table in a new tab TABLE 2Shh-regulated expression in primary UGM cells and UGS tissuesGeneGene expressionaNote: gene expression induced by Shh (↑) is expected to be inhibited by cyclopamine (↓). ↑, increased expression; ↓, decreased expression; 0, no significant change. ↑ or ↓ signifies at least 2-fold statistically significant (p < 0.05) change in expression in replicate experiments.Response to ShhResponse to cyclopamineArrayPrimary UGMUGS organ cultureGli1↑↑↓Ptc1↑↑↓Igfbp-6↑↑↓Igfbp-3↑↑↓Fbn2↑↑↓Ntrk3↑↑↓Agpt4↑↑↓Dner↑↑0Hsd11b1↑↑0Artn↑↑0Tnmd↑0↓Timp3↑0↓Tiam1↑0↓Plxna2↑0↓BRAK↑0↓Fgf5↑00Dmp1↓↓↑Mmp13↓↓↑Rgs4↓00Sufu↓0↑a Note: gene expression induced by Shh (↑) is expected to be inhibited by cyclopamine (↓). ↑, increased expression; ↓, decreased expression; 0, no significant change. ↑ or ↓ signifies at least 2-fold statistically significant (p < 0.05) change in expression in replicate experiments. Open table in a new tab Shh-regulated Expression in Primary Mesenchymal Cells and the UGS—To evaluate how well the target gene profile of the UGSM-2 cell line represents the general population of mesenchymal cells in the UGS, we isolated primary mesenchymal cells from the separated E16 UGS mesenchyme and cultured them in the presence or absence of Shh for 24 h. We then analyzed expression of Gli1, Ptc1, and the 18 validated target genes by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Of the 18 genes, 10 demonstrated Shh-regulated expression in the primary UGS mesenchyme cells (Table 2). We then analyzed expression of the 18 genes in intact E16 UGS cultured in serum-free media ± cyclopamine (28Cooper M.K. Porter J.A. Young K.E. Beachy P.A. Science. 1998; 280: 1603-1607Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar), an inhibitor of Hh signaling, to identify those genes whose expression is regulated by Hh signaling during prostate development. Thirteen exhibited significantly altered expression when Hh signaling was inhibited with cyclopamine. In each case, genes induced by Shh in the microarray (n = 10) showed repression when the UGS was exposed to cyclopamine and genes repressed by Shh (n = 3) were induced by exposure of the UGS to cyclopamine (Table 2). Hedgehog Target Gene Expression in the Newborn Prostate—We performed in situ hybridization to examine the expression of selected Hedgehog target genes in the newborn (P1) prostate. This time point was selected because of the robust and distinctive pattern of Shh and Gli1 expression in the nascent buds and adjacent mesenchyme, respectively (3Lamm M.L. Catbagan W.S. Laciak R.J. Barnett D.H. Hebner C.M. Gaffield W. Walterhouse D. Iannaccone P. Bushman W. Dev. Biol. 2002; 249: 349-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Expression of all five target genes examined (Timp3, Plxna2, Dner, Cxcl14, and Igfbp-3) exhibited mesenchyme-specific expression localized around the nascent buds, mimicking the expression of Ptc1 and Gli1 (Fig. 1). Prostate Selective Expression—To determine whether any of the 18 identified target genes exhibit prostate selective Hh-regulated expression, we examined their Shh-dependent expression in primary E13 WT MEFs and NIH3T3 cells. The cells were cultured with and without Shh, and expression of Gli1, Ptc1, and the 18 target genes was examined. Both Ptc1 and Gli1 exhibited robust Shh-induced expression in MEFs and NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2). Fifteen of the 18 genes demonstrated Shh-regulated expression in MEFs and/or NIH3T3 cells (data not shown). One gene (Dner) that exhibited Shh-induced expression in both UGSM-2 cells and primary UGS mesenchymal cells was not responsive to Shh in either MEFs or NIH3T3 cells. Two additional genes (Tnmd and Timp3) that showed Shh-regulated expression in UGSM-2 cells but not in primary UGS mesenchymal cells also did not show significant Shh-induced change in expression in MEFs or NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2). Differential Regulation of Shh-responsive Genes—Direct regulation of Shh target genes is believed to result from the combined activities of Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3. Smo regulates the activities of all three Gli genes by mechanisms that remain incompletely understood. To understand the convoluted actions of Hh signaling in simultaneously regulating proliferation, differentiation, and morphogenesis during development, there is considerable interest in determining the mechanisms by which differential regulation of Shh target genes is achieved in different cells. We first examined the concentration dependence of Shh-induced changes in expression of several of the newly identified Hh target genes and found that most followed the same pattern as Gli1 and Ptc1 with a dose-dependent expression that reached a plateau and remained elevated even with additional ligand (supplemental data Figs. S1 and S2). Tiam1 exhibited a uniquely different concentration dependence of expression. Expression increased to a maximum at 10–50 nm Shh and then progressively decreased to uninduced levels at higher concentrations (supplemental data Fig. S1). Localization of Tiam1 in the P10 and adult prostate by immunofluorescence staining shows expression co-localizing with smooth muscle actin in stromal cells surrounding the prostatic ducts (Fig. 3). We next assayed the transcriptional response by transfecting UGSM-2 cells with an activated form of Smo, full-length Gli1, or an activated form of Gli2. All three manipulations would generally be considered methods of achieving Hh target gene activation and, indeed, the canonical target genes Gli1 and Ptc1 exhibited significantly increased expression in response to transfection with all three constructs. Overall, induced increases in expression were lowest following Gli1 transfection and greatest after Smo transfection. When we assayed for changes in expression of the 18 target genes using the same cDNA made from those cells, most of the genes exhibited consistent induction or repression by the three manipulations. This included Igfbp-6, Igfbp-3, Ntrk3, Agpt4, Artn, Timp3, Tiam1, Plxna2, Fgf5, Dmp1, Mmp13, Rgs4, and Sufu (data not shown). However, we uncovered some intriguing differences. Some of the target genes (Dner, Fbn2, Brak (Cxcl14), and Hsd11b1) were not induced by either Gli1 or Gli2 transfection, but were induced by Smo transfection. In striking contrast, Tnmd showed the highest level of induced expression with Gli1 transfection and the lowest level of induced expression with Smo transfection (Fig. 4). Gli Binding Elements in the Promoters of Shh Target Genes—The three Gli proteins share a 9-bp consensus binding sequence (GACCACCCA) (29Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 634-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). We performed in silico analysis of the remaining validated target genes and identified putative Gli-binding sites upstream of the promoter in 10 additional genes (Tnmd, Tiam1, Fbn2, Mmp13, Plxna2, Dner, Artn, Hsd11b1, Rgs4, and Igfbp-3). Each of the putative Gli binding sites contains at least 7-bp homology with the 9-bp consensus (GACCACCCA) (supplemental data Fig. S3). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed to determine the ability of these 10 putative binding sites to interact with the DNA binding motif of Gli protein. The putative Gli-binding elements from the promoter region of target genes Igfbp-3, Fbn2, and Rgs4 bound Gli protein specifically (Fig. 5). Unique Target Gene Response to PKA Activation—Fbn2 contains a bona fide Gli binding element but neither Gli1 nor an activated form of Gli2 is able to activate Fbn2 expression (Fig. 6). Because gene activation can be achieved by alleviating repression by Gli3 and Gli3 processing is regulated by PKA (30Wang B. Fallon J.F. Beachy P.A. Cell."

Cp is a multicopper oxidase mainly secreted by hepatocytes, where the P-type ATPase ATP7B incorporates copper into apo-Cp (3Lutsenko S. Barnes N.L. Bartee M.Y. Dmitriev O.Y. Physiol. Rev. 2007; 87: 1011-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (572) Google Scholar). An alternatively spliced GPI-anchored isoform of Cp has been identified in brain astrocytes (4Patel B.N. David S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20185-20190Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 5Patel B.N. Dunn R.J. David S. J. Biol.

Individuals heterozygous for the disease mutations have a partial Cp deficiency and usually display normal iron metabolism and no clinical symptoms, although a few cases of affected heterozygous patients have been reported. Homozygotes, however, show symptoms of iron overload disease; 37 published mutations (including frameshift, nonsense, and missense mutations) in 45 pedigrees have been described, as reported on line. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain shows iron deposits in the basal ganglia, striatum, thalamus, and dentate nucleus; iron overload occurs also in the liver, pancreas, and retina despite low serum iron and elevated serum ferritin (8Miyajima H. Neuropathology. 2003; 23: 345-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The onset of clinical manifestations is usually in adulthood, and patients develop retinal degeneration, diabetes mellitus, and neurological symptoms, which include ataxia, involuntary movements, and dementia. The actual pathogenesis of aceruloplasminemia is still unclear, but iron-mediated oxidative stress is thought to contribute to tissue injury and neuronal cell death. Recent data have demonstrated that the ferroxidase activity of Cp is required for the stability of cell surface ferroportin (Fpn), the only known mammalian iron exporter, and that Fpn is rapidly internalized and degraded in the absence of Cp (9De Domenico I. McVey Ward D. Bonaccorsi di Patti M.C. Jeong S.Y. David S. Musci G. Kaplan J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2823-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). This finding provides a straightforward explanation for brain iron overload in patients with aceruloplasminemia, where the lack of a functional Cp-GPI would lead to defective export of iron from cells because of degradation of Fpn. Indeed, it has been shown that Cp-/- mice lack Fpn on the astrocyte cell surface (9De Domenico I. McVey Ward D. Bonaccorsi di Patti M.C. Jeong S.Y. David S. Musci G. Kaplan J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2823-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). However, although it is clear that mutations leading to a truncated protein produce a nonfunctional Cp, the effect of missense mutations on the structure and function of the protein can be much less obvious. Among the aceruloplasminemia missense mutants described up to now, only a few have been characterized (10Hellman N.E. Kono S. Miyajima H. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol.

Neuromolecular Med. 2006; 8: 361-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Fundamental contributions to the understanding of the molecular basis of this pathology revealed that the mutants were retained totally (P177R) or partially (I9F) in the early secretory pathway of cells, or they were secreted as an inactive apoprotein lacking copper (G631R and G969S). It can be inferred from the x-ray structure of Cp that also other substitutions are expected to perturb copper incorporation because the mutated residues are either copper ligands (His-978) or they are close to copper-binding sites (Ala-331 and Gln-692). The effect of the other mutations on the structure and activity of Cp appears to be less predictable. In particular, mutation R701W is very intriguing because it has been found in an atypical very young heterozygous patient with extremely severe neurologic symptoms despite the presence of the wild type allele (14Kuhn J. Miyajima H. Takahashi Y. Kunath B. Hartmann-Klosterkoetter U. Cooper-Mahkorn D. Schaefer M. Bewermeyer H. J. Neurol. 2005; 252: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Arg-701 is located in a long surface exposed loop on the flat basal region of Cp, making it difficult to correlate the disease phenotype to a folding or ferroxidase activity defect of the protein. Here we show that some mutants of Cp, including one present in an aceruloplasminemic heterozygous patient, have a potentially functional structure yet are not loaded with copper in vivo, likely because of defective interaction with the copper-transporting ATPase ATP7B. Constructs—The cDNA for human Cp-GPI was cloned by RT-PCR on total RNA from U373MG human glioma cells with the cMaster RT-PCR System (Eppendorf). The secreted form of Cp was generated by PCR by substituting the region coding for the last 30 residues of the GPI-anchored isoform with the five amino acids of secreted Cp. For expression in mammalian cells, the Cp-GPI or secreted Cp cDNA was cloned SacI-XhoI in the pCMVTag4b vector (Stratagene). All mutants were produced either with the QuikChange II XL mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) or by megaprimer PCR. The FLAG or Myc tag was introduced by PCR in the coding sequence of Cp to replace Arg-481. Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ccc2p coding sequence was obtained by PCR on genomic DNA and cloned EcoRI-XhoI in pCMVTag4b to generate a C-terminally FLAG-tagged protein. All constructs were verified by automated DNA sequencing at Biogen-ENEA (Italy). The pFpn-EGFP expression plasmid was a generous gift from J. Kaplan. Cells and Media—Rat C6 glioma cells were purchased from the ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Cambrex) and 40 μg/ml gentamicin (Sigma). Confluent monolayers were subcultured by conventional trypsinization, and cells were seeded in 35-mm tissue culture dishes for transfections. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) and Transient Transfection—siRNA oligonucleotide pool matching selected regions of rat Cp-GPI was obtained from Dharmacon (ON-TARGETplus SMART pool L-089853) and was specific for the rat protein, allowing expression of transfected human Cp isoforms (both GPI and secreted). Sense sequences of oligonucleotide pools were as follows: gaaaugguccagaucguauuu; gaaugaaguugacgugcauuu; gaaugaaucuugguacuuauu; and ggagaaaggaccuacuauauu. C6 cells were transfected with siRNAs at a final concentration of 100 nm by using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). Eighteen to 24 h after silencing, cells were transfected with pFpn-EGFP and pCMVhCp constructs using Lipofectamine enhanced by the Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Cells were grown for 18-24 h and then processed for immunofluorescence microscopy, Western blot analysis, or iron export measurement. Ferritin measurements were carried out as reported previously (9De Domenico I. McVey Ward D. Bonaccorsi di Patti M.C. Jeong S.Y. David S. Musci G. Kaplan J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2823-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with 20 μm ferric ammonium citrate for 24 h. After a further 24 h in the absence of ferric ammonium citrate, cellular proteins were extracted with 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 1% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 10-20 μg was used for ferritin measurement. Ferritin levels were determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Biotech Diagnostic, Laguna Niguel, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions and were normalized for the total protein concentration in each sample. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Cell staining for immunofluorescence microscopy was performed as described previously (9De Domenico I. McVey Ward D. Bonaccorsi di Patti M.C. Jeong S.Y. David S. Musci G. Kaplan J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2823-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), using the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-Cp (1:100, Dako), mouse anti-FLAG M2 (1:100, Sigma), mouse anti-Myc 9E10 (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-TGN-38 (1:50, BD Biosciences), mouse anti-GM130 (1:50, BD Biosciences), rabbit anti-ATP7A/B (1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-FLAG (1:100, Sigma), and rabbit anti-Myc (1:100, Sigma), followed by treatment with either Alexafluor 594- or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:750, Invitrogen), or Alexafluor 594-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:750, Invitrogen) as secondary antibodies. NBD-C6-ceramide complexed to bovine serum albumin (Molecular Probes) was used, following the manufacturer's instructions, to produce selective staining of the Golgi complex for visualization by fluorescence microscopy. Cells were visualized using an inverted DMI 6000 confocal scanner microscope TCS SP5 (Leica Microsystems CMS GmbH) with a 63× oil immersion objective. Images were acquired using Leica application suite advanced fluorescence software. Each fluorochrome was scanned individually, and each image included 3-8 cells. The number of cells showing a certain pattern was counted in every image and expressed as a percentage of all cells in the image. Then the median percentage from different images was calculated. Western Blot, Immunoprecipitation, and RT-PCR—The Cu(I)-glutathione complex was prepared as described previously (15Musci G. Di Marco S. Bellenchi G.C. Calabrese L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1972-1978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For Western blot analysis of secreted Cp, culture supernatants of transfected cells grown in serum-free medium were supplemented with protease inhibitors (phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride 1 mm, leupeptin 2 μg/ml, pepstatin 2 μg/ml), concentrated with 30 units of Microcon (Millipore), and fractionated by SDS-PAGE under denaturing (samples heated in the presence of reducing agents) or nondenaturing (samples loaded as such) conditions. This technique was used to discriminate apo- and holo-Cp, as reported (16Sato M. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5128-5134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For analysis of Cp-GPI, cells were solubilized in 25 mm MOPS buffer (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, supplemented with protease inhibitors, by incubation on ice for 45 min. Protein content of cell extracts was determined by either the microBCA method (Pierce) or Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Equal amounts of lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and probed with rabbit anti-Cp antibody (1:5000, Dako), mouse anti-FLAG M2 (1:2000, Sigma), mouse anti-Myc 9E10 (1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and rabbit anti-ATP7A/B (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. The appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma) was used at a 1:10,000 dilution. The blot was visualized with ECL Plus (GE Healthcare) or Blue POD (Roche Applied Science). For immunoprecipitation, cellular proteins were extracted with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 mm EDTA, supplemented with a protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Cp was immunoprecipitated using rabbit anti-Cp antibody (1:250, Dako) and protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C overnight; either WT or mutant Cp (FLAG) was immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG-agarose (Sigma) at room temperature for 4 h. Samples were eluted from beads with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer with dithiothreitol. Semiquantitative RT-PCR was carried out to assess mRNA levels for both endogenous Fpn and recombinant Fpn-GFP. Total RNA was extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) 24 h post-transfection and reverse-transcribed into cDNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT)12-18 (Invitrogen). Transcripts were amplified using the following specific primers: mFPN_for, ttgtggtcctgatgaaaaag, and GFP_rev, atgaacttcagggtcagctt (for recombinant Fpn-GFP); and rFPN_for, aatgttgtcaataccgtcca, and rFPN_rev, accatgatgaaatgcagaag (for rat Fpn). The mRNA for β-actin was examined as the reference cellular transcript. Production of Recombinant Cp in Yeast—Recombinant human secreted Cp was expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris. WT and mutant secreted Cp cDNA was cloned SacI-XhoI in the integrative pIB2 vector (17Sears I.B. O'Connor J. Rossanese O.W. Glick B.S. Yeast. 1998; 14: 783-790Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) under control of the strong constitutive glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter and expressed in a fet3Δ P. pastoris strain, which lacks the endogenous ferroxidase Fet3p. Details of construction of the yeast strain and expression of the recombinant protein will be reported elsewhere. 4M. C. Bonaccorsi di Patti, G. De Francesco, and G. Musci, manuscript in preparation. WT and mutant Cp were partially purified from culture supernatants by chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel (GE Healthcare) with buffers containing 5 mm EDTA. Deglycosylation with endoH (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was performed in denaturing conditions, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Missense Aceruloplasminemia Mutants Can or Cannot Complement Silencing of Endogenous Ceruloplasmin—Ferroxidase-competent Cp is required to maintain Fpn on the plasma membrane (9De Domenico I. McVey Ward D. Bonaccorsi di Patti M.C. Jeong S.Y. David S. Musci G. Kaplan J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2823-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Therefore, the ability of missense aceruloplasminemia mutants to prevent Fpn degradation represents a valid test of the functionality of the mutated protein. Because brain iron overload is a hallmark of aceruloplasminemia, we chose the rat C6 glioma cell line as our model system. Oligonucleotides selective for rat Cp were used to silence C6 cells for endogenous Cp-GPI, and cells were co-transfected with mouse Fpn-GFP and with human WT or mutant Cp-GPI (hCp-GPI). Then the presence of Fpn-GFP was assessed by epifluorescence microscopy 48 h after silencing. As already reported (9De Domenico I. McVey Ward D. Bonaccorsi di Patti M.C. Jeong S.Y. David S. Musci G. Kaplan J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2823-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), hCp WT was able to restore Fpn on the membrane (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, the Cp missense mutants were found to fall into three categories as follows: fully functionally competent, partially competent, or functionally incompetent. Epi- and immunofluorescence fields obtained on selected mutants representative of the three categories are also shown in Fig. 1A. Mutants known to be enzymatically inactive (P177R, G631R, and G969S) and mutants D58H, Q692K, and R701W were unable to rescue Fpn-GFP; mutations F198S and A331D restored Fpn-GFP on 40-60% of cells, whereas mutations I9F, Q146E, W264S, G606E, and G876A fully complemented the silencing of endogenous Cp-GPI. Identical results were obtained by transfecting the corresponding soluble isoforms of hCp (data not shown). All hCp-GPI mutants except P177R, which was found in the ER, as expected (10Hellman N.E. Kono S. Miyajima H. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1375-1380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), correctly localized to the plasma membrane, and Western blot analyses demonstrated that endogenous Cp-GPI was fully silenced under our conditions (Fig. 1B), its synthesis being mostly inhibited even 72 h after addition of the silencing oligonucleotides (data not shown). All recombinant hCp-GPI proteins were expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 1C). It is known that measurement of intracellular ferritin levels under proper conditions is an index of the iron export ability of cells, as ferritin accumulates in the cell when the iron export system is impaired (18De Domenico I. Ward D.M. Nemeth E. Vaughn M.B. Musci G. Ganz T. Kaplan J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8955-8960Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). To this purpose, cells transfected with different hCp mutants were loaded with ferric ammonium citrate, and ferritin was measured 24 h after removal of iron from the medium. As expected, we found largely higher ferritin levels in cells transfected with mutants unable to rescue Fpn-GFP on the membrane (data not shown). The apo/holo status of transfected hCp mutants was evaluated by nondenaturing SDS-PAGE, i.e. without heat treatment and in the absence of reducing agents prior to loading samples on the gel. Fig. 1D reports the results on the mutants depicted in Fig. 1A. It should be noted that the soluble isoform of the protein had to be employed in this experiment, because of instability of the GPI-linked isoform in these conditions. The results indicated that the ability of the mutants to rescue (totally or in part) Fpn-GFP was related to the presence of holo-hCp, which runs as a band at 85 kDa versus apo-hCp at 130 kDa (16Sato M. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5128-5134Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as exemplified by the lanes of I9F and F198S in Fig. 1D. On the other hand, only the apoprotein form was detected for functionally incompetent mutants Q692K, R701W (Fig. 1D), D58H, and G631R. The amount of secreted hCp turned out to be much higher in samples where most of the protein was holo. Because it is known that the rate of synthesis and secretion of wild type Cp is the same for the holo- and the apo-forms (11Hellman N.E. Kono S. Mancini G.M. Hoogeboom A.J. De Jong G.J. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46632-46638Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), these data suggest that secreted apo-hCp is unstable; however, the hypothesis that soluble mutants synthesized as apoprotein are poorly secreted compared with wild type cannot be ruled out. Substitution of Arginine 701 with Tryptophan Results in the Synthesis of an Apo-Cp—The next step was to investigate whether mutants synthesized as apo-Cp lacked copper because of structural defects. To this purpose, in situ reconstitution of secreted hCp with the Cu(I)-GSH complex, which has been shown to remetallate apo-Cp in vitro (15Musci G. Di Marco S. Bellenchi G.C. Calabrese L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1972-1978Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), was attempted. Cells were silenced for endogenous Cp-GPI and transfected with the soluble form of hCp WT, D58H, Q692K, or R701W. Consistent with previous data (9De Domenico I. McVey Ward D. Bonaccorsi di Patti M.C. Jeong S.Y. David S. Musci G. Kaplan J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2823-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), transfected soluble hCp WT was able to rescue Fpn-GFP. Cu(I)-GSH was ineffective on untransfected silenced cells and on cells transfected with hCp D58H or Q692K; the latter is shown in Fig. 2. On the other hand, addition of Cu(I)-GSH to the medium restored Fpn-GFP on about 30-40% of cells transfected with secreted hCp R701W (Fig. 2), suggesting that in this case the secreted protein lacks copper but retains the ability to bind it. Consistently, Western blot analysis confirmed that, at variance with Q692K, apo-hCp R701W was partly converted to holo-hCp R701W by Cu(I)-GSH (Fig. 2). The amount of secreted apo-Cp appeared to be higher in samples where Cu(I)-GSH was present, irrespective of the mutant used. This could be due to a general stabilizing effect of added copper or to a positive effect of the complex on Cp secretion. Human Cp D58H appeared to be partially reconstituted by Cu(I)-GSH, despite lack of Fpn-GFP recovery. Therefore, hCp R701W is unique in that it does not possess a structural defect, which makes it intrinsically unable to bind copper, and that an active enzyme can be produced under proper conditions. Quite strikingly, hCp R701W was dominant over Cp WT. This was first assessed on nonsilenced cells, as shown in Fig. 3A. Clearly, Fpn was degraded when cells were transfected with hCp-GPI R701W, despite the presence of endogenous Cp (Fig. 3A). The same result was obtained when nonsilenced cells were transfected with the soluble form of hCp R701W (data not shown). The dominance of R701W mutation over the wild type protein was maintained when cells were silenced for endogenous Cp and transfected with hCp WT (both soluble and GPI-linked). Again, no Fpn was observed in the presence of hCp R701W irrespective of the simultaneous presence of the WT protein (Fig. 3B). R701W was the only natural mutation found to have this property. As a matter of fact, rescue of Fpn-GFP by hCp WT was not affected by co-expression of any other functionally incompetent mutant, as exemplified by the Q692K mutant in Fig. 3B. The effect of mutation R701W was not on the stability of Fpn mRNA. Levels of Fpn mRNA (both endogenous Fpn and recombinant Fpn-GFP) were assessed by RT-PCR, and they were found to be comparable in untransfected cells and in cells transfected with hCp-GPI WT or hCp-GPI R701W (data not shown). The mechanism of dominance of Cp R701W on WT was then investigated. To this purpose, the effect of Cu(I)-GSH was first studied. Silenced cells were co-transfected with hCp-GPI R701W and secreted hCp WT, and the protein recovered in the medium was analyzed by Western blot after nondenaturing SDS. As shown in Fig. 3C, upper panel, the secreted hCp WT was mostly in the apo-form, which could be partially converted to holo-form in the presence of Cu(I)-GSH (lower panel). The fluorescence analysis confirmed that a significant fraction of cells recovered Fpn-GFP in the presence of Cu(I)-GSH. Altogether, these data indicate that the presence of the mutant R701W impairs copper loading of co-transfected hCp WT and that copper loading is partially restored by Cu(I)-GSH, with consequent recovery of Fpn-GFP. Moreover, the efficiency of reconstitution of Cp by the Cu(I)-GSH complex is similar for both Cp WT and R701W (cf. the Western blots in Figs. 2 and Fig. 3C), leading to a similar extent of recovery of Fpn-GFP. Consistently, the same effect of Cu(I)-GSH was observed when silenced cells were co-transfected with secreted hCp R701W and hCp-GPI WT. These findings are particularly relevant because R701W is found in a heterozygous atypical very young patient. Thus, this mutant was further investigated, to better elucidate the origin of the failure of copper loading leading to the dominant negative phenotype. The Presence of hCp-GPI R701W Does Not Affect Cellular Localization of hCp-GPI WT—First, we analyzed the subcellular localization of WT and R701W hCp-GPI in co-transfected cells. Differently tagged derivatives of hCp-GPI were produced by inserting either a Myc or a FLAG epitope in a surface-exposed loop, replacing arginine 481. Neither epitope affected the functionality of the protein, as tagged hCp-GPI WT fully complemented the silencing of endogenous Cp-GPI (shown in supplemental Fig. S1 for the Myc derivative). Immunofluorescence analysis on cells co-transfected with hCp-GPI WT (Myc) and hCp-GPI R701W (FLAG) demonstrated that both proteins were simultaneously present at the plasma membrane (supplemental Fig. S1), indicating that the R701W mutant did not cause aberrant localization of the WT protein. Failure to co-immunoprecipitate tagged hCp-GPI WT and R701W suggested that the dominant negative phenotype of the R701W mutation could not be explained assuming Cp is dimeric (data not shown). Substitution of Arginine 701 with Tryptophan Impairs ATP7B-dependent Copper Loading Process—When secreted hCp WT and R701W were expressed in the yeast P. pastoris and partially purified from culture medium, they both showed robust oxidase activity, as shown by nondenaturing SDS and staining with o-dianisidine (Fig. 4A, left panel). This indicates that both hCp WT and R701W can be obtained as holo-proteins by heterologous expression in yeast. The recombinant proteins were hyperglycosylated, as demonstrated by the electrophoretic shift observed after treatment with endoH (Fig. 4A, right panel). It should be noted that the right panel of Fig. 4A was run under denaturing conditions, and therefore the electrophoretic mobilities cannot match those observed in the left panel. Addition of the recombinant proteins produced in yeast, either WT or R701W, to the medium of C6 cells silenced for Cp-GPI completely rescued Fpn-GFP (Fig. 4B), unequivocally indicating that oxidase-active hCp R701W is functional and that the ferroxidase activity of Cp is sufficient to stabilize Fpn. Consistently, iron scavenging from Fpn by addition of either purified native hCp, purified yeast ferroxidase Fet3p, or the iron chelator BPS (9De Domenico I. McVey Ward D. Bonaccorsi di Patti M.C. Jeong S.Y. David S. Musci G. Kaplan J. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 2823-2831Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) to cells silenced for endogenous Cp-GPI and transfected with hCp-GPI R701W stabilized Fpn at the plasma membrane (supplemental Fig. S2), also confirming that hCp-GPI R701W on the plasma membrane does not per se impair Fpn or hCp WT. Copper loading of hCp R701W can thus take place efficiently in yeast, but it is critically perturbed in mammalian cells with a dominant effect over co-expressed hCp WT. Copper delivery in the secretory pathway requires the copper-transporting ATPases ATP7A and ATP7B in mammalian cells (3Lutsenko S. Barnes N.L. Bartee M.Y. Dmitriev O.Y. Physiol.

Among these proteins, lipocalins play a major role in the modulation of the inflammatory response.Screening a cDNA library in association with RT-PCR and RACE methodologies allowed us to identify 14 new lipocalin genes in the salivary glands of the Ixodes ricinus hard tick. A computational in-depth structural analysis confirmed that LIRs belong to the lipocalin family. These proteins were called LIR for ""Lipocalin from I. ricinus"" and numbered from 1 to 14 (LIR1 to LIR14). According to their percentage identity/similarity, LIR proteins may be assigned to 6 distinct phylogenetic groups. The mature proteins have calculated pM and pI varying from 21.8 kDa to 37.2 kDa and from 4.45 to 9.57 respectively. In a western blot analysis, all recombinant LIRs appeared as a series of thin bands at 50-70 kDa, suggesting extensive glycosylation, which was experimentally confirmed by treatment with N-glycosidase F. In addition, the in vivo expression analysis of LIRs in I. ricinus, examined by RT-PCR, showed homogeneous expression profiles for certain phylogenetic groups and relatively heterogeneous profiles for other groups. Finally, we demonstrated that LIR6 codes for a protein that specifically binds leukotriene B4.This work confirms that, regarding their biochemical properties, expression profile, and sequence signature, lipocalins in Ixodes hard tick genus, and more specifically in the Ixodes ricinus species, are segregated into distinct phylogenetic groups suggesting potential distinct function. This was particularly demonstrated by the ability of LIR6 to scavenge leukotriene B4. The other LIRs did not bind any of the ligands tested, such as 5-hydroxytryptamine, ADP, norepinephrine, platelet activating factor, prostaglandins D2 and E2, and finally leukotrienes B4 and C4."
https://openalex.org/W2134267784,"There is growing interest in psychosocial factors with positive attitudes, such as interpersonal trust, as determinants for Quality-of-life (QOL) or subjective well-being. Despite their longevity, Japanese people report a relatively poor subjective well-being, as well as lower interpersonal trust. Our aim in this study was to evaluate the possible association between interpersonal trust and QOL among Japanese people.Based on the cross-sectional data for Japanese adults (2008), we analyzed the relationship between interpersonal trust and each of four domains of the WHOQOL-BREF. Interpersonal trust was assessed using three scales for trust in people, in human fairness and in human nature. In a total of 1000 participants (mean age: 45 years; 49% women), greater trust was recognized among women (vs. men), those aged 60-69 (vs. 20-29), or the high-income group (vs. low-income). Each of three trust scales was positively correlated with all domains of QOL. Multiple linear-regression models were constructed for each of QOL and the principal component score of the trust scales, adjusted for age, gender, area size of residence, income, education, and occupation. For all QOL domains, interpersonal trust was significantly and positively associated with better QOL with p<0.001 for all four domains including physical, psychological, social, and environmental QOL. Other factors associated with QOL included gender, age class, area size of residence, and income. Education and occupation were not associated with QOL.Greater interpersonal trust is strongly associated with a better QOL among Japanese adults. If a causal relationship is demonstrated in a controlled interventional study, social and political measures should be advocated to increase interpersonal trust for achieving better QOL."

Both compounds use different mechanisms of current activation; amino acid residues within the S2-S3 linker have been identified critical for current activation by icilin but not by menthol.

Shapero M.H. Morkowski S. Laus R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3760-3769PubMed Google Scholar). These tissues encounter little temperature variations, suggesting that further currently unknown physiological activation mechanisms may exist. Under experimental conditions, TRPM8 is activated by various stimuli including voltage, cold temperatures (<28 °C), and several chemical compounds that open the channel either alone or through a synergistic interaction (13Rohács T.

For instance, only the activation of TRPM8 by icilin depends on the presence of intracellular Ca2+ (3McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D.

Neurosci. 2004; 24: 5364-5369Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although both icilin and menthol induce only transient currents, the current decline is much slower when menthol is the stimulus (18Chuang H.H. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Neuron. 2004; 43: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 23Beck B. Bidaux G. Bavencoffe A. Lemonnier L. Thebault S. Shuba Y. Barrit G. Skryma R. Prevarskaya N.

It has been proposed that the decline after menthol stimulation represents desensitization involving depletion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; the desensitization in turn depends on intracellular Ca2+ or on Ca2+ influx through the open channel (13Rohács T. Lopes C.M. Michailidis I. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Remarkably, a TRPM8 mutant that does not pass Ca2+ does not show desensitization (25Kühn F.J.P. Knop G. Lückhoff A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 27598-27609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Each of the three amino acid residues, Asn-799, Asp-802, and Gly-805, localized in the cytoplasmic loop connecting the transmembrane segments S2 and S3 is required for icilin sensitivity of mammalian TRPM8 but not for channel activation by menthol or cold (18Chuang H.H. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Neuron. 2004; 43: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). This domain may represent a binding site for icilin comparable with a topologically equivalent domain previously described for the binding of capsaicin and other vanilloid ligands (26Jordt S.E.

On the other hand, several point mutations have been reported to affect activation of TRPM8 by menthol (15Voets T. Owsianik G. Janssens A. Talavera K. Nilius B. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2007; 3: 174-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 28Bandell M. Dubin A.E. Petrus M.J. Orth A. Mathur J. Hwang S.W. Patapoutian A. Nat. Neurosci. 2006; 9: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), but these mutations are widely scattered throughout the channel structure (within transmembrane segments S2, S4, the S4-S5 linker, and the channel segment downstream of S6) and affect the sensitivity of the channel to icilin, cold, and voltage as well, at least in part. Thus, a distinct channel region that specifically controls menthol sensitivity has not yet been identified. Recently, some carboxyamide derivatives were characterized as potent TRPM8 agonists and proposed as potential candidates for the development of anti-cancer drugs (23Beck B. Bidaux G. Bavencoffe A. Lemonnier L. Thebault S. Shuba Y. Barrit G. Skryma R. Prevarskaya N. Cell Calcium. 2007; 41: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 24Bödding M. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Cell Calcium. 2007; 42: 618-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Although the chemical structures of the carboxyamides more closely resemble that of menthol than of icilin, it has been suggested that at least one of these compounds, WS-12, acts like icilin on TRPM8 (23Beck B. Bidaux G. Bavencoffe A. Lemonnier L. Thebault S. Shuba Y. Barrit G. Skryma R. Prevarskaya N. Cell Calcium. 2007; 41: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, this proposition has not been verified in the icilin-insensitive variant. In the present study we aimed at a more rigorous test of whether these agents act like icilin or like menthol. In addition to our comparison of the processes of current induction, we were particularly interested in the current decline after stimulation and whether differences might exist in between the various stimuli. We report that icilin exerts specific inhibitory effects on human TRPM8 that are distinct from desensitization, do not require the interaction site in the S2-S3 loop, and affect current activation by menthol, menthol derivatives and cold temperatures. Molecular Cloning—The cDNAs of human TRPM8 and human TRPA1 were subcloned in pIRES-hrGFP-2a vector (Stratagene). For the generation of a TRPM8 channel variant insensitive to icilin, the amino acid sequence 803TLGLFY808 of wild-type TRPM8 was changed to the corresponding sequence 873VGAILL878 of the human TRPM2 channel using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutations were verified by DNA sequencing with the Big-DYE-Terminator Kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Roche Applied Science). The presence of inadvertent mutations in other regions of the channel could be excluded because two independent clones were tested yielding the same results. All procedures were performed in accordance to the respective manufacturers' instructions if not indicated otherwise. Cell Culture and Transfection—Stable expression of wild-type and chimerical TRPM8 channels as well as wild-type TRPA1 channel was achieved as follows. Each of the core expression constructs pIRES-wtTRPM8, pIRES-s3TRPM8, and pIRES-wtTRPA1 was recombined with a neomycin resistance module (EC-Neo, Stratagene) according to the manufacturers' instructions. This recombination construct was transiently transfected into human embryonic kidney (HEK-293) cells using the Trans-Fast transfection reagent (Promega). The transfected cells were selected by growth in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum, and containing Geneticin (G418 sulfate, 1 mg/ml, Invitrogen). Surviving clones that were visibly positive for the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein were isolated and frozen at early passage numbers. These stocks were propagated in the presence of Geneticin (1 mg/ml) for further studies. Electrophysiology—Patch clamp recordings were performed in the conventional whole-cell mode. The standard bath solution contained 140 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 1.2 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (NaOH). For Na+ free solutions, Na+ was replaced by 150 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine (NMDG), and the titration was performed with HCl. The divalent free bath solution (DVF) contained 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (NaOH). The pipette solution contained 145 mm cesium glutamate, 8 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2 (CsOH), and the Ca2+ concentration was adjusted to either <10 nm (10 mm Cs-EGTA) or 1 μm (0.886 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm Cs-EGTA). The Ca2+ concentration of the solutions were calculated using the MAXC program. In all experiments Cs+ and glutamate were the main intracellular ions to minimize potential contaminating currents through K+ and Cl– channels. For the stimulation of TRPM8 currents, each of the following agonists was added directly to the bath during whole-cell patch clamp recordings (dilution factor was 10–3): menthol (Sigma, 200 mm stock solution in DMSO), icilin (Cayman, 30 mm stock solution in DMSO), allylisothiocyanate (Sigma, 10 mm stock solution in DMSO), or WS-12, CPS-369, and CPS-154 (30 mm stock solutions in DMSO). The compounds WS-12, CPS-369, and CPS-154 were kindly provided by Dr. Edward T. Wei, University of California, Berkeley. If not otherwise stated, the experiments were performed at room temperature (20 °C), the holding potential was –60 mV, and the current-voltage relations were obtained during voltage ramps from –90 to +60 mV and back to –90 mV applied over 200 ms. For the characterization of the stimulatory and inhibitory effects of menthol, menthol derivatives, and icilin on TRPM8 cation channels, we established two human embryonic kidney cell lines, one stably expressing wild-type (wt) TRPM8 and one an icilin-insensitive variant of TRPM8 (s3-TRPM8). We used a combined expression construct (see “Experimental Procedures”) that allows the selection of positive clones by neomycin selection and expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein. Therefore, expression levels of either channel protein could be estimated from the emission of enhanced green fluorescent protein fluorescence. All five stimuli tested, i.e. menthol (200 μm), icilin (30 μm), WS-12 (30 μm), CPS-369 (30 μm), and CPS-154 (30 μm), induced characteristic cation currents after application to the bath during whole-cell patch clamp experiments (exemplary shown for the stimulation with icilin in Fig. 1). Notably, any effect of the stimuli occurred only after a delay of 0.5–1 min (Fig. 1A) as in previous studies (e.g. Ref. 18Chuang H.H. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Neuron. 2004; 43: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). At a holding potential of –60 mV, the current amplitudes were well above 2 nA and showed a strong outward rectification (Fig. 1B). The currents were readily inhibited in the inward direction by the large cation NMDG, whereas the outward currents were moderately reduced by NMDG (Fig. 1B). Similar currents as in TRPM8-expressing cells were activated by menthol (not shown) and by icilin (Fig. 1, C and D) in control experiments using cells stably expressing human TRPA1. Moreover, as in previous studies (e.g. Ref. 23Beck B. Bidaux G. Bavencoffe A. Lemonnier L. Thebault S. Shuba Y. Barrit G. Skryma R. Prevarskaya N. Cell Calcium. 2007; 41: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) currents induced by both stimuli receded spontaneously. In TRPM8, the decline in the presence of icilin was considerably faster than in the presence of the other stimuli. As a first test of whether icilin and the menthol derivative WS-12 used different mechanisms of current activation in TRPM8, experiments were performed that are shown in Fig. 2. In the presence of an extracellular Ca2+ concentration (1.2 mm) and an intracellular Ca2+ concentration weakly buffered to 1 μm and after an initial moderate current had declined, icilin and WS-12 were applied subsequently to the bath (Fig. 2A). Icilin induced a large but transient inward current, whereas WS-12 evoked only a small effect. This would be in line with the previous conclusion that icilin and WS-12 used common mechanisms possibly mediated by common binding sites (24Bödding M. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Cell Calcium. 2007; 42: 618-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). However, this view was challenged when the experiments were repeated in the absence of Ca2+ or, more specifically, under conditions where the extracellular and intracellular Ca2+ concentrations were strongly buffered to below 10 nm (Fig. 2B). The icilin-induced currents were abolished, whereas large and sustained currents were induced by WS-12. Thus, the current activation was Ca2+-dependent when icilin was the stimulus. In contrast, WS-12 was effective in the absence of Ca2+ when icilin had not induced a current. As test for a Ca2+-dependent desensitization of the TRPM8 channels, the two stimuli WS-12 and menthol were subsequently applied either in the presence of a high/weakly buffered (Fig. 2C) or low/strongly buffered (Fig. 2D) intracellular Ca2+ concentration. At high intracellular Ca2+, the second stimulus menthol had hardly any effect, even though WS-12 had been washed out and the current had returned to base line. In distinct contrast, a sizeable response to menthol was demonstrated at low intracellular Ca2+ even if the second response appeared slightly weaker. These experiments are in line with a previous report that demonstrates the essential role of Ca2+ for desensitization with a different approach (13Rohács T. Lopes C.M. Michailidis I. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar).FIGURE 2Repeated stimulation of wt-TRPM8 and Ca2+-mediated desensitization. A, icilin (30 μm) and WS-12 (30 μm) were subsequently applied at the time points indicated by arrows. The intracellular (pipette) solution (in) contained 1 μm Ca2+, and the (standard (ex)) bath contained 1.2 mm Ca2+. w.c., whole cell. B, the Ca2+ of the pipette solution was buffered with EGTA to below 10 nm; the standard bath solution was changed to a DVF during the time period indicated by a horizontal bar. Icilin and WS-12 were applied as in A. C, same pipette and bath solutions as in A; WS-12 (30 μm) was applied (indicated by an arrow) and later removed by a wash as indicated by the horizontal bar. Afterward, menthol (200 μm) was added. D, the protocol of panel C was repeated for another cell with an intracellular (pipette) Ca2+ concentration of <10 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We reasoned that even though the intracellular low Ca2+ solution is strongly buffered, local rises in the Ca2+ concentration close by the membrane might still occur, especially in the presence of large currents. Therefore, we additionally removed extracellular Ca2+ in all further experiments in which the absence of Ca2+ had to be studied. In particular, we were interested in the role of Ca2+ in the process of inactivation or desensitization of TRPM8 and whether differences existed between the various stimuli. Base-line currents were slightly but consistently enhanced by removal of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 3). Similar observations were described in a previous study (29Hui K. Guo Y. Feng Z.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 374-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Current activation by icilin was abolished in the absence of Ca2+; icilin even reversed the effects of Ca2+ removal on base-line currents (Fig. 3A, see also Fig. 2B). In contrast, menthol, WS-12, and CPS-369 all induced large and long lasting cation currents under Ca2+-free conditions (Figs. 3, B–D). Base-line as well as stimulus-induced inward currents were inhibited by NMDG. Notably, the outward rectification of base-line currents persisted in Ca2+-free solutions (Fig. 3A), ruling out that the rectification might be the result of open channel block by Ca2+. In these experiments, menthol and menthol derivatives behaved alike in terms of Ca2+-independent current activation and Ca2+-dependent desensitization. In contrast, the role of Ca2+ in the decline of icilin-induced currents and possible differences between icilin and the other stimuli cannot be clarified in such experiments. Therefore, we exploited a variant of TRPM8 that cannot be activated by icilin. Such a variant has been described by Chuang et al. (18Chuang H.H. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Neuron. 2004; 43: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). We generated an alternative variant where not only the critical glycine 805 was substituted but the amino acid sequence 803–808 was exchanged by the corresponding sequence of the icilin insensitive channel TRPM2 (Fig. 4A). Electrophysiological studies on the s3-TRPM8 demonstrate that indeed no currents were induced by icilin (Fig. 4B). However, s3-TRPM8 was not noticeably different from wt-TRPM8 in terms of sensitivity to menthol, voltage (Fig. 4C), and cold temperatures (data not shown). Moreover, the menthol derivatives WS-12, CPS-154, CPS-369 all evoked characteristic currents in s3-TRPM8, demonstrating again that they behave indistinguishably from menthol but distinctly different from icilin (Fig. 5).FIGURE 4Activation of TRPM8 by icilin depends on intracellular Ca2+ and a specifically localized glycine residue within the S2-S3 linker of the channel. A, corresponding amino acid sequences of TRPM2 and TRPM8 enclosing the C-terminal part of the S2-S3 linker and the N-terminal part of the transmembrane segment S3.

Representative experiments addressing this question are shown in Fig. 6. Icilin added to s3-TRPM8 exposed to Ca2+-free solution led (after a delay typical for all icilin effects) to a rapid decline of base-line currents (also see Fig. 3A). The addition of WS-12 (Fig. 6A) shortly after icilin failed to induce currents, in contrast to controls where the solvent of icilin was applied alone (Fig. 6B). Surprisingly, the addition of WS-12 after a longer interval of icilin incubation then evoked currents, although these were slower in onset than in the absence of icilin (Fig. 6C, see also Fig. 2B). We supposed that this phenomenon might be caused by a time-dependent loss of activity of icilin such as by degradation in aqueous solution in the presence of cells. Therefore, we applied icilin for a second time just when WS-12-induced currents were strongly growing in amplitude. Indeed, a complete reversal of the currents was observed (Fig. 6D). In an identical manner as currents induced by WS-12, currents induced by menthol (Fig. 6E) were completely inhibited by icilin in the s3-TRPM8 mutant. The same finding was obtained in a limited number of experiments (n = 2) for currents evoked by CPS-369 (data not shown). To investigate whether the icilin-evoked inhibition of currents was specific for this agent, the solvent alone (Fig. 6F) or menthol (after stimulation with WS-12, not shown) was tested instead; both substances did not change the long-lasting currents. Moreover, no such current reduction was found when menthol was the initial stimulus, and WS-12 was applied subsequently (data not shown). After we had demonstrated that icilin inhibits currents through TRPM8 stimulated by menthol and its derivatives, we asked whether it would furthermore inhibit currents induced by cold temperatures. Therefore, we designed experiments in which cells expressing the s3-TRPM8 mutant were repeatedly exposed to 4 °C and then allowed to warm up again to room temperature. Ca2+-free conditions were maintained throughout to rule out Ca2+-dependent desensitization that takes place in the course of a temperature-dependent activation of TRPM8 as well (13Rohács T. Lopes C.M. Michailidis I. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Cooling consistently induced characteristic currents which developed much more rapidly than those in response to chemical stimuli and returned to base line during warm-up (Fig. 7A). Currents could be enhanced by menthol (Fig. 7B). In contrast, icilin completely reversed the effects of cooling (Fig. 7C) once more after a typical delay of about 30 s. After wash-out of icilin, the sensitivity to cooling was readily restored, although the onset of the second response to cooling was somewhat delayed. The inhibitory effects of icilin were similar for all voltage ranges studied (Fig. 7D). Thus, the studies on the s3-TRPM8 variant demonstrate that icilin inhibits the channel independently of the stimulus by which currents are activated and independently of the structures within S3 where an interaction with or even binding of icilin is generally assumed. Even in wild-type TRPM8, such inhibitory effects could be shown (Fig. 8, A and B) when menthol or its derivatives were used as stimulus and the Ca2+-dependent desensitization was prohibited. Icilin completely suppressed the currents induced by WS-12 (Fig. 8A) or by menthol (not shown). In control experiments, no such inhibitory effect was detected in response to menthol when the current was induced by WS-12 (Fig. 8B) or to WS-12 when the current was induced by menthol (not shown). As additional controls, icilin was tested on TRPA1-expressing cells kept Ca2+ free and prestimulated with either menthol (200 μm; Fig. 8, C and D) or allylisothiocyanate (10 μm; Fig. 8, E and F). In contrast to the results in TRPM8, there was no inhibition of currents by icilin in TRPA1. On the contrary, enhancing effects were consistently observed (n = 8) in the presence of the weak stimulus menthol (200 μm). Currents induced by 10 μm allylisothiocyanate were already large such that enhancing the effects of icilin could not be safely resolved (Fig. 8E), but inhibitory effects were excluded. Thus, current inhibition by icilin is exclusively found for TRPM8 and its mutant. In this study we have demonstrated that the menthol derivatives WS-12, CPS-369, and CPS-154 act identically with menthol in terms of Ca2+-independent current activation and Ca2+-dependent induction of desensitization on wild-type TRPM8 as well as on the S3 mutant. The alternative TRPM8 stimulus icilin, on the other hand, proved to act distinctly different with respect to several aspects. As already shown previously, icilin-induced current activation was strictly dependent on the presence of Ca2+, and the current decline after peak stimulation occurred much faster (3McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Nature. 2002; 416: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (2027) Google Scholar, 18Chuang H.H. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Neuron. 2004; 43: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Our studies on the S3 mutant that cannot be activated by icilin allowed us to analyze inhibitory actions of icilin. When the mutant was stimulated either with menthol, menthol-derivatives, or cold temperatures, icilin led to a rapid decline of the currents; this decline was indistinguishable from that observed in icilin-stimulated wild-type TRPM8. Furthermore, the decline occurred completely independent of Ca2+ and was independent of the assumed interaction site of icilin and TRPM8 within the S2-S3 loop of the channel. Finally, icilin could not only reverse but also suppress menthol-induced currents in the S3 mutant. Thus, we have dissected various mechanisms in the processes of current activation and current inhibition of TRPM8 that are specific for its activators, with menthol, its derivatives, and cold temperatures comprising one group and icilin a second one. The compounds WS-12, CPS-369, and CPS-154 share a common basic structure with menthol, the para-menthane group, but contain a carboxyamide group instead of the hydroxyl group of menthol. The derivatives differ in their substituent attached to the carboxyamide group. Hence, from a structural point of view, the functional relationship between menthol and the carboxyamide derivatives does not seem surprising even though previous studies have proposed a functional similarity between icilin and WS-12 (23Beck B. Bidaux G. Bavencoffe A. Lemonnier L. Thebault S. Shuba Y. Barrit G. Skryma R. Prevarskaya N. Cell Calcium. 2007; 41: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 24Bödding M. Wissenbach U. Flockerzi V. Cell Calcium. 2007; 42: 618-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). When menthol or its derivatives were the stimulus of TRPM8, current activation and current decline can be easily separated by omitting Ca2+ from the intracellular (and additionally the extracellular) solution because the decline represents a desensitization most likely mediated by depletion of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (13Rohács T. Lopes C.M. Michailidis I. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). In the case of icilin, however, current activation occurs through different mechanisms that essentially involve Ca2+-dependent steps (3McKemy D.D. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Nature. 2002; 416: 52-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (2027) Google Scholar, 18Chuang H.H. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Neuron. 2004; 43: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar); therefore, it cannot be decided in experiments on wild-type TRPM8 whether the rapid current decline that follows current activation by icilin is Ca2+-dependent as well. Experiments after menthol stimulation, however, performed in the absence of Ca2+ either on wild-type or s3-TRPM8 demonstrate an icilin-induced current decline in the complete absence of Ca2+. Moreover, an inhibitory effect of icilin can also be demonstrated in the absence of a current because icilin temporarily prevented current activation by menthol. Therefore, the effect of icilin cannot be described as desensitization; in contrast to the desensitization observed after stimulation with menthol, it represents a current inhibition, the mechanisms of which cannot be completely understood at present, but they do not seem to involve interference with menthol binding because icilin inhibits cold-induced currents as well. Surprisingly, the activity of icilin after the addition to the cells vanished rapidly. This is exemplified in Fig. 6D where preincubation with icilin (30 μm) did not completely abolish the effects of WS-12; rather, these were considerably delayed and slowed down. A second application of icilin then led to the characteristic current inhibition. It should be noted that this finding does not represent a dose-response relation of icilin because full current inhibitions could be achieved with icilin (30 μm, e.g. Fig. 6E). According to the manufacturer, aqueous solutions of icilin are unstable over the course of several hours; thus, our results would be best explained either by cell-dependent degradation or by sequestration of icilin. Our study reveals some new aspects regarding the putative binding site of icilin within the S2-S3 loop of TRPM8. The s3-TRPM8 mutant used in our experiments is a chimerical channel in which a sequence of six amino acid residues is replaced by the corresponding sequence of the closely related but icilin-insensitive channel TRPM2. The manipulation completely abolished the sensitivity to icilin. Within the exchanged sequence, there are three amino acid residues (Asn-799, Asp-802, and Gly-805) critical for icilin sensitivity of TRPM8 (Ref. 18Chuang H.H. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Neuron. 2004; 43: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, see also Fig. 4A). The first two of them are conserved in the corresponding region of TRPM2 (Asn-869 and Asp-872). The third one, a glycine (Gly-874), is shifted to the N terminus by one position in the icilin-insensitive TRPM2 and the s3-TRPM8 mutant. Hence, Gly-805 seems to represent the most important determinant for the icilin sensitivity of TRPM8 and is required in its exact position. In contrast to the stimulating actions of icilin on TRPM8 for which a site critical for the interaction can be defined, no such site is known for the inhibitory effect. A future search of such a site may use our results on TRPA1 as a starting point because TRPA1 neither contains the motif in the S2-S3 loop nor is inhibited by icilin. The latter finding may be taken as a hint that TRPM8 may indeed possess a further site for an interaction with icilin. If, alternatively, icilin exerted its inhibitory effects through indirect mechanisms, e.g. by interfering with the interaction with membrane lipids considered critical for the activation and regulation of both TRPM8 and TRPA1 (13Rohács T. Lopes C.M. Michailidis I. Logothetis D.E. Nat. Neurosci. 2005; 8: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 19Kim D. Cavanaugh E. Simkin D. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 295: 92-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), icilin would be expected to inhibit TRPA1 as well. The biological significance of TRPM8 is not confined to the perception of cold and of “cool” agents such as menthol; an additional role has been established in prostatic tumor tissue where the expression level of TRPM8 coincides with malignancy (12Tsavaler L. Shapero M.H. Morkowski S. Laus R. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3760-3769PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, a recent study has revealed that the activation of endogenous TRPM8 channels by menthol suppresses cellular viability of human melanoma cells (30Yamamura H. Ugawa S. Ueda T. Morita A. Shimada S. Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2008; 295: 296-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Therefore, the understanding of the mechanisms of both activation and inhibition of TRPM8 may be of major medical interest. Perhaps, the identification of the dual role of icilin in the gating of TRPM8 may provide us with a novel target of drug development. For the s3-TRPM8 channel, icilin is a pure inhibitor; possibly, derivatives could be developed that do no longer activate wild-type TRPM8 but retain the inhibitory effects. In conclusion, icilin evokes stimulating effects on TRPM8 by interaction with the S2-S3 loop of the channel; separately, inhibitory effects take place that are preserved in the S3 mutant. Both activating and inactivating actions are different from phenotypically similar effects of menthol and temperature and may help in the future to delineate the complex interactions of the channel proteins and the membrane lipids that take place in the regulation of TRPM8.

https://openalex.org/W2137578387,"Background Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been used extensively in genetics and epidemiology studies. Traditionally, SNPs that did not pass the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) test were excluded from these analyses. Many investigators have addressed possible causes for departure from HWE, including genotyping errors, population admixture and segmental duplication. Recent large-scale surveys have revealed abundant structural variations in the human genome, including copy number variations (CNVs). This suggests that a significant number of SNPs must be within these regions, which may cause deviation from HWE. Results We performed a Bayesian analysis on the potential effect of copy number variation, segmental duplication and genotyping errors on the behavior of SNPs. Our results suggest that copy number variation is a major factor of HWE violation for SNPs with a small minor allele frequency, when the sample size is large and the genotyping error rate is 0∼1%. Conclusions Our study provides the posterior probability that a SNP falls in a CNV or a segmental duplication, given the observed allele frequency of the SNP, sample size and the significance level of HWE testing."
https://openalex.org/W2056279264,"Abstract Apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells is an important factor in the pathophysiology of diabetes. Previously, we have shown that the “phytoestrogen” resveratrol can induce β-cell apoptosis dependent on the expression of sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) 1, the regulatory subunit of pancreatic ATP-sensitive K+ channels. Here, we investigate whether 17β-estradiol also influences β-cell apoptosis in a SUR1-dependent manner. Therefore, islets from wild type or SUR1 knock-out mice, clonal β-cells, or HEK293 cells expressing different SUR forms were treated with 17β-estradiol or estrone. Different apoptotic parameters were determined and estrogen binding to SUR was analyzed. In murine islets, 17β-estradiol treatment resulted in significant apoptotic changes, which in their nature (either apoptotic or anti-apoptotic) were dependent on the age of the animal. These effects were not observed in SUR1 knock-out mice. Furthermore, 17β-estradiol, which specifically binds to SUR, induced enhanced apoptosis in SUR1-expressing HEK293 cells and clonal β-cells, whereas apoptosis in recombinant cells expressing SUR2A or SUR2B (cardiac or vascular SUR-isoforms) or sham-transfected control cells was significantly lower. The apoptotic potency of 17β-estradiol was much higher than that of resveratrol or estrone. SUR1-specific 17β-estradiol-induced apoptosis was either abolished by the mutation M1289T in transmembrane helix 17 of SUR1 or clearly enhanced by two mutations in nucleotide binding fold 2 (R1379C, R1379L). In conclusion, 17β-estradiol treatment modulates β-cell apoptosis under specific involvement of SUR1 in an age-dependent manner. 17β-Estradiol-induced apoptosis can be influenced by certain SUR1 mutations. These findings may contribute to the understanding of pathophysiological changes in β-cell mass and could, for instance, provide interesting aspects concerning the etiology of gestational diabetes."

Our data expand the versatility of DNA recognition by GATA-type zinc fingers and perhaps shed new light on the DNA-binding properties of mammalian GATA factors. Members of the GATA family of transcription factors contain either one or two type IV zinc fingers (1Teakle G.R. Gilmartin P.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 100-102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In mammals, six of these proteins, namely GATA-1-6, have been studied in some detail (2Arceci R.J. King A.A.

These six proteins are highly conserved in vertebrates, and functional GATA family transcriptional regulators have also been described in more distant organisms: for example, ELT-1 is essential for epidermal specification in Caenorhabditis elegans (8Page B.D.

To date, the three-dimensional structures of three GATA-type zinc fingers in complex with DNA have been determined: the C-terminal zinc finger (C-finger) 3The abbreviations used are: C-finger, C-terminal zinc finger; MED1zf, MED-1 zinc finger; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; RDCs, residual dipolar couplings; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; DTT, dithiothreitol.3The abbreviations used are: C-finger, C-terminal zinc finger; MED1zf, MED-1 zinc finger; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; RDCs, residual dipolar couplings; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; NOESY, nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy; dsDNA, double-stranded DNA; DTT, dithiothreitol. of chicken GATA-1 (14Omichinski J.G.

Science. 1993; 261: 438-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), the C-finger of murine GATA-3 (15Bates D.L. Chen Y. Kim G. Guo L. Chen L. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 381: 1292-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), and the zinc finger of Aspergillus nidulans AreA (16Starich M.R. Wikstrom M. Arst Jr., H.N. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 605-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Each has revealed a protein core that consists of two N-terminal β-hairpins and an α-helix; both the helix and the loop connecting the two hairpins make multiple contacts with the major groove of the DNA. In addition, each finger contains a C-terminal tail of ∼20 residues that is rich in basic residues. These tails take up similar conformations in the three structures, “folding back” and wrapping around the DNA in an extended fashion. In each case, the tail makes a number of mostly nonspecific contacts with the minor groove and/or the sugar phosphate backbone.MED-1 is a C. elegans GATA family transcription factor that plays a central role in the specification of the mesoderm and endoderm tissues by activating the expression of a range of downstream target genes (17Broitman-Maduro G. Maduro M.F. Rothman J.H. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 427-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The protein contains a single zinc finger that shares ∼53% sequence similarity with the chicken GATA-1 C-finger over the core zinc finger structure and 46% similarity when the basic tail regions are included (see Fig. 1A). Although it was anticipated that MED-1 would bind the consensus GATA sequence, Broitman-Maduro et al. (17Broitman-Maduro G. Maduro M.F. Rothman J.H. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 427-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the MED-1 zinc finger (MED1zf) specifically recognizes a larger and somewhat divergent site, GTATACT(T/C)3.We have examined the molecular basis for this unusual DNA-binding specificity. Our data indicate that a single arginine residue in the core zinc finger domain drives a specificity switch from AGATA to GTATA and that, unexpectedly, the C-terminal basic tail of MED1zf forms an additional well ordered α-helix that interacts with the 3′-pyrimidine-rich extension in the DNA consensus sequence. These results underscore the versatility of DNA recognition by zinc finger domains and have implications for the functions of the many GATA family proteins for which DNA-binding specificities have not yet been defined in detail.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPreparation of Proteins—Residues 108-174 of MED-1 were overexpressed as a His-tagged fusion protein in pET15b. The use of Escherichia coli Rosetta2 cells was essential for obtaining reliable overexpression. Cell pellets were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT), and one complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture tablet (per 50 ml of lysis buffer; Roche Applied Science). His6-MED1zf was recovered from the soluble fraction and purified on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). The fusion tag was cleaved using thrombin (3-4 h at 25 °C) in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm DTT, and MED1zf was further purified by size exclusion chromatography (HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 75, Amersham Biosciences). The purified polypeptide contained an additional four N-terminal amino acids (GSHM) derived from the thrombin cleavage site. 15N- and 15N,13C-labeled MED1zf were prepared following the procedure of Cai et al. (18Cai M. Huang Y. Sakaguchi K. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Craigie R. J. Biomol. NMR. 1998; 11: 97-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and purified as described above. A range of MED1zf point mutants was created using site-directed mutagenesis and purified as described above, and their correct folding was confirmed by one-dimensional 1H NMR spectroscopy.Preparation of DNA—For isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), complementary 20-mers containing the MED1zf-binding site (5′-CAAAAGGTATACTTTTCCGT-3′ and its complement; Sigma Genosys) were resuspended in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0; combined at equimolar concentrations; annealed at 95 °C for 10 min; and then slowly cooled to room temperature. The annealed duplex was further purified by size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 75). For NMR, a palindromic DNA oligonucleotide was designed (5′-CGGAAAAGTATACTTTTCCG-3′), annealed, and purified as described above. For surface plasmon resonance, a biotinylated 25-mer (5′-GGACCCCGTATACTTTTCCGGAGAG-3′; Sigma Genosys) was annealed with a complementary 20-mer (5′-CGGAAAAGTATACGGGGTCC-3′) and purified as described above.Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Purified MED1zf and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) were dialyzed against 20 mm sodium phosphate, 40 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT, pH 6.5. The MED1zf concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm using the calculated extinction coefficient (∊ = 9770 m-1 cm-1). The DNA concentration was determined by absorbance at 260 nm using ∊ = 219,410 m-1 cm-1. The dsDNA (90 μm) was titrated into MED1zf (14 μm, 1.4 ml) at 25 °C in a series of 10 μm injections, with a 4-min interval between injections, using a MicroCal VP-ITC microcalorimeter. The evolved heats were integrated and normalized for protein concentration. After base-line correction (using data from a titration of dsDNA into buffer), the data were fitted to a single-site model using Origin 5.0 (MicroCal).Surface Plasmon Resonance—Kinetic analysis was performed on a Biacore 3000 surface plasmon resonance instrument (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Biotinylated dsDNA was immobilized on a streptavidin-coated SA sensor chip (Biacore AB). The buffer used for all experiments was 30 mm sodium phosphate, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, and 0.01% surfactant P20. The chip was pretreated according to the manufacturer's instructions with conditioning solution (3× 100-μl injections at 50 μl/min with 50 mm NaOH and 1 m NaCl). The biotinylated dsDNA was diluted to 10 nm and injected onto one of the sensor chip channels (Fc-2) at a flow rate of 5 μl/min for 5 min, resulting in an immobilization level of ∼120 response units. The sensor chip was then washed with running buffer. Upstream unmodified channel surfaces were used for reference subtraction. Kinetic measurements at protein concentrations across the range 1 nm to 1 mm (40 μl) were performed at 25 °C with a KINJECT protocol and a flow rate of 20 ml/min. Wild type and mutant protein samples were sampled alternately, zero concentration samples were included for double-referencing, and three cycles were performed. The chip surface was regenerated with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.005% SDS between each set of protein samples. Data analysis was performed with BIAevaluation software (Biacore AB).NMR Spectroscopy—Purified MED1zf was dialyzed into buffer containing 20 mm sodium phosphate, 40 mm NaCl, and 1 mm DTT, pH 6.5, to final concentrations of up to ∼0.8 mm. NMR samples also contained 10 μm 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid as a chemical shift reference and 5-10% (v/v) D2O. Spectra were recorded at 298 K on Bruker 600- and 800-MHz spectrometers equipped with cryoprobes. Samples of MED1zf mutants were prepared similarly. All homonuclear two-dimensional data were collected and analyzed as described (19Liew C.K. Kowalski K. Fox A.H. Newton A. Sharpe B.K. Crossley M. Mackay J.P. Structure (Camb.). 2000; 8: 1157-1166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Mixing times were 70 and 100 ms for total correlation and nuclear Overhauser effect spectra, respectively. 15N and 13C chemical shift assignments were made from the standard suite of triple resonance experiments as described previously (20Deane J.E. Mackay J.P. Kwan A.H.Y. Sum E.Y. Visvader J.E. Matthews J.M. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2224-2233Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). NOE-derived distance restraints were obtained from two-dimensional NOESY and three-dimensional 15N-separated NOESY. φ and ψ restraints were included on the basis of an analysis of backbone chemical shifts in the program TALOS (21Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar) and from 3JHNHA scalar couplings measured in HNHA (22Bax A. Vuister G.W. Grzesiek S. Delaglio F. Wang A.C. Tschudin R. Zhu G. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 79-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). One-bond HN residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) were recorded for the MED1zf·DNA complex in 6 mg of Pf1 phage (ASLA Biotech) using the in-phase/anti-phase pulse sequence (23Cordier F. Dingley A.J. Grzesiek S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 175-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Correct alignment of the complex was checked by measuring the D2O splitting (12-15 Hz). The program PALES (24Zweckstetter M. Hummer G. Bax A. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3444-3460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) was used for the calculation of the magnitude and orientation of the sterically induced alignment tensor (see below for details). All NMR data were processed using TOPSPIN (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) and analyzed with SPARKY 3 (25Goddard T. Kneller D. SPARKY 3. University of California, San Francisco2006Google Scholar).Structure Calculations—The program HADDOCK (26de Vries S.J. van Dijk A.D. Krzeminski M. van Dijk M. Thureau A. Hsu V. Wassenaar T. Bonvin A.M. Proteins. 2007; 69: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 27Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2117) Google Scholar) was used to calculate a data-driven model of the MED1zf·DNA complex. The starting structures for the docking were a B-form model of the DNA fragment (5′-CGGAAAAGTATACTTTTCCG-3′) constructed by using the program 3DNA (28Lu X.J. Olson W.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 5108-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar) running on the three-dimensional Dart server located at the Centre for Biomolecular Research at Utrecht University (The Netherlands). A model of the MED1zf structure (residues 111-166, excluding the unstructured N and C termini) was constructed based on the structure of chicken GATA-1. Residues 152-164, which are largely extended in the GATA-1 C-finger, were formed into an additional helix based on TALOS predictions, NOE data, and 3JHNHA coupling constants. This structure was energy-minimized in CNS (three rounds of 200 steps with the backbone fixed) (29Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16929) Google Scholar) and used as input for HADDOCK. During HADDOCK runs, MED1zf residues 114-146 (zinc finger core) and 152-162 (helix 2) were defined as semiflexible, and residues 111-113 (N terminus), 147-151 (linker between the two helices), and 163-166 (C terminus) were defined as flexible. Within the semiflexible regions, the following residues were selected as “active” for the definition of ambiguous interaction restraints: 120-125, 138-146 (with the exception of Cys139, a zinc-ligating residue), and 152-162. These definitions were based on chemical shift perturbation data (see Fig. 4, A and B). For the DNA, ambiguous interaction restraints were defined solely from the unique base atoms of bases 7-16 and 25-34 of the core region and the 3′-flanking thymine stretch to suitable atoms (i.e. from hydrogen to nitrogen or oxygen and vice versa) (30Gamsjaeger R. Swanton M.K. Kobus F.J. Lehtomaki E. Lowry J.A. Kwan A.H. Matthews J.M. Mackay J.P. J. Biol.

Because the used DNA sequence is palindromic, it is not immediately clear on which strand the binding occurs; however, a few intermolecular NOEs (supplemental Fig. S1A) allowed us to unambiguously define the binding site on the DNA (3′-flanking thymine stretch of bases 14-16 and 25-27 rather than 5-7 and 34-37). In addition to the ambiguous interaction restraints, dihedral angle restraints, all unambiguously assigned intra- and intermolecular NOEs (upper distance limit of 6 Å), restraints for the tetragonal coordination of the zinc atom (32Liew C.K. Simpson R.J. Kwan A.H. Crofts L.A. Loughlin F.E. Matthews J.M. Crossley M. Mackay J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 583-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), and restraints to maintain the conformation of the DNA were used as inputs into HADDOCK (supplemental Table 1). After rigid-body minimization, semiflexible annealing, and water refinement, the best 10 structures within the lowest energy cluster (cutoff = 7.5 Å) (26de Vries S.J. van Dijk A.D. Krzeminski M. van Dijk M. Thureau A. Hsu V. Wassenaar T. Bonvin A.M. Proteins. 2007; 69: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 27Dominguez C. Boelens R. Bonvin A.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2003; 125: 1731-1737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2117) Google Scholar) were used as input for another semiflexible annealing and water refinement step. The resulting best 10 structures (cutoff = 1.5 Å) of the lowest energy cluster overlaid with a root mean square deviation of 0.72 Å (backbone of MED1zf residues 114-162 and DNA). At this stage, HN-N RDCs were introduced as direct restraints (using the SANI statement); axial and rhombic components of the alignment tensor (Da and Dr) were calculated using the ensemble of 10 structures and the software PALES (24Zweckstetter M. Hummer G. Bax A. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 3444-3460Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Semiflexible annealing and water refinement, as described above, were then carried out once using the RDCs as well as all other mentioned restraints, and the alignment tensor was recalculated based on the resulting best 10 structures (cutoff = 1.5 Å), and HADDOCK was run again (see above) using these new values. After this run, the tensor components of the final 10 structures (cutoff = 1.0 Å) were not significantly different from the ones from the previous stage. The root mean square deviation dropped from 0.72 Å to a final value of 0.40 Å. The final family of 10 structures was analyzed using standard HADDOCK protocols (supplemental Table 2); no major violations were observed. The structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with accession code 2KAE.FIGURE 4NMR analysis of the MED1zf-DNA interaction.

A, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were carried out as competition experiments; the wild type DNA sequence (lane 3 in both panels) was labeled with 32P, and the ability of unlabeled competitor DNAs containing mutations to compete for binding to MED1zf was assessed. A shifted band (and a low number on the graph) indicates that the given mutant is a poor competitor. Three independent experiments were performed, and error bars (S.E.) are shown.

Given the large predicted size of the recognition site for MED1zf compared with GATA-1, as well as its partially palindromic nature, we first sought to establish the stoichiometry of the MED1zf·DNA complex. We therefore subjected the purified protein to size exclusion chromatography incorporating a multiangle laser light-scattering detector. The observed peak (Fig. 2A, upper panel) yielded a molecular mass of 8.4 kDa (theoretical mass of 8.3 kDa), demonstrating that this domain is monomeric in solution. We performed the same procedure with a 20-bp dsDNA molecule that contained the MED1zf-binding site (Fig. 2, middle panel). To determine the stoichiometry of the protein-DNA interaction, we mixed equimolar amounts of MED1zf and dsDNA. A multiangle laser light-scattering analysis estimated a molecular mass of 20 kDa (theoretical mass of 20.5 kDa), indicating a 1:1 interaction (Fig. 2A, lower panel).FIGURE 2MED1zf binds DNA in a 1:1 fashion with nanomolar affinity.

AU, absorbance units.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Having established the stoichiometry of the interaction, we used ITC to determine the affinity of the complex. The interaction is exothermic (ΔH = -11 kcal/mol), and the data fit well to a 1:1 binding model with a dissociation constant of 13 nm (Fig. 2B). This affinity is very similar to the dissociation constant measured for the GATA-1·DNA complex (8 nm) (33Omichinski J.G. Trainor C. Evans T. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Felsenfeld G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1676-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).MED-type Zinc Fingers Recognize a Different Consensus Sequence—Although the MED-1 zinc finger has a substantial degree of sequence similarity to the mammalian GATA-type zinc fingers, we previously demonstrated that MED1zf specifically recognized the variant consensus sequence GTATACT(T/C)3 (17Broitman-Maduro G. Maduro M.F. Rothman J.H. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 427-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To determine which bases were critical for the MED1zf-DNA interaction, we carried out electrophoretic mobility shift assays using 32P-labeled wild type DNA and mutant DNA oligonucleotides as competitors.The first issue we addressed was whether the pyrimidine-rich region that flanks the core GTATAC sequence was important for binding. Because the core of the binding site is palindromic (GTATAC), there is the potential for MED1zf to bind the DNA site in two orientations. We therefore created two completely palindromic sequences in which the core GTATAC on both strands was flanked on the 3′ side by either TTTT (the preferred sequence from the published site selection data) or GGGG. As shown in Fig. 3A, only AAAAGTATACTTTT could compete with the labeled probe (lane 4), whereas the other unlabeled probe (CCCCGTATACGGGG; lane 5) failed to compete, even at a 150-fold molar excess. This indicated that MED1zf binds the labeled probe (CCCCGTATACTTTT) in only one orientation and that the 3′-pyrimidine-rich stretch is an important component of the MED1zf recognition site. This latter finding is consistent with the observation that MED1zf target genes could be predicted based on the DNA consensus sequence (17Broitman-Maduro G. Maduro M.F. Rothman J.H. Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 427-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It is also notable that probes containing a consensus GATA site (TTATCA, corresponding to TGATAA) were unable to compete with the MED1zf sequence (Fig. 3, A, lane 6; and B, lane 4).Further mutagenesis was carried out within the core and flanking regions, whereby we substituted at each position thymine for guanine and adenine for cytosine and vice versa (Fig. 3A, lanes 7-21). In a second experiment (Fig. 3B), an oligonucleotide with a slightly different sequence 5′ of the GTATA site (thymines instead of cytosines) was used, and each thymine was substituted by cytosine and each adenine by guanine and vice versa (lanes 5-16). Mutagenesis of each of the three 3′-flanking thymines resulted in slight to moderate reductions in binding affinity, whereas mutagenesis of the flanking 5′-cytosines (Fig. 3A) or 5′-thymines (Fig. 3B) gave rise to essentially no changes. All substitutions within the core palindrome, with the exception of the first thymine in Fig. 3A (lane 16), had a large impact on binding. Overall, these data suggest that the core region (GTATAC) as well as the 3′-flanking thymines constitute the binding site of MED1zf.Mapping the MED1zf-DNA Interaction by NMR Spectroscopy—To gain insight into the structural basis of the MED1zf-DNA interaction, we analyzed the chemical shift changes that occur upon titration of 1 mol eq. of dsDNA into 15N-labeled MED1zf. The 20-bp DNA sequence shown in Fig. 1B was used for the titration. Comparison of the 15N HSQC spectrum of 15N-labeled MED1zf before and after the addition of dsDNA reveals numerous shift changes (Fig. 4A), and the quality of the data are consistent with the formation of a stable 1:1 complex. The interaction is in slow exchange on the chemical shift time scale, consistent with the measured binding affinity.We used triple resonance NMR data to assign MED1zf in both the absence and presence of DNA, and a summary of the backbone chemical shift changes is also shown in Fig. 4B. Fig. 4B shows the secondary structure content of MED1zf, both in the free form and in the presence of DNA, based on TALOS (21Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2729) Google Scholar) and medium-range NOE data. It is clear that the secondary structure of the free zinc finger closely matches that of other GATA-type zinc fingers, with four short β-strands and a single α-helix (helix 1). Within the zinc finger core (Ser112-Tyr146), the largest chemical shift changes following DNA binding are observed for the second and third β-strands and the loop connecting these strands. Some significant changes also occur in the center of the α-helix. However, the most striking effects occur across a 14-residue stretch of the basic tail, and an analysis of chemical shift and NOE data reveals that a substantial conformational change takes place in MED1zf upon DNA binding, with the formation of a second 11-residue α-helix within the formerly disordered basic C-terminal tail (helix 2, Val152-Lys162).Assignments of DNA resonances were also made in both the absence and presence of MED1zf.

In oxidized R2 (R2ox), the Mn(III)Fe(III) state exhibited EPR g values of 2.013, 2.009, and 2.015. By XAS, Mn-Fe distances and oxidation states of intermediates were determined and assigned as follows: ∼4.15 Å, Mn(II)Fe(II); ∼3.25 Å, Mn(III)Fe(II); ∼2.90 Å, Mn(III)Fe(III); and ∼2.75 Å, Mn(IV)Fe(III). Shortening of the Mn/Fe-ligand bond lengths indicated formation of additional metal bridges, i.e. μO(H) and/or peroxidic species, upon O2 activation at the site. The structural parameters suggest overall configurations of the Mn-Fe site similar to those of homo-metallic sites in other R2 proteins. However, the ∼2.90 Å and ∼2.75 Å Mn-Fe distances, typical for di-μO(H) metal bridging, are shorter than inter-metal distances in any R2 crystal structure. In diffraction data collection, such bridges may be lost due to rapid x-ray photoreduction of high-valent metal ions, as demonstrated here for Fe(III) by XAS.

The R1 protein contains the nucleotide binding site and R2 houses a dinuclear metal center, which is the site of dioxygen (O2) activation and, in conventional RNRs, is of the Fe-Fe type (7Bunker G.

Extensive investigations on Fe-Fe RNRs from, e.g. Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mus musculus, and Homo sapiens have established that the catalytic reactions involve activation of an O2 molecule at the di-metal cluster to generate a high potential site, which oxidizes a nearby tyrosine residue to a tyrosyl radical, Y.

Science. 1996; 271: 477-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). C. initiates ribonucleotide reduction involving disulfide formation by two additional cysteines (16Mao S.S. Holler T.P. Yu G.X. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Booker S. Johnston M.I. Stubbe J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9733-9743Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Regeneration of reduced cysteines requires electron input from external thio- or glutaredoxins and ultimately from NADPH (17Prinz W.A. Aslund F. Holmgren A. Beckwith J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15661-15667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). At least the Fe(II)2, Fe(III)2, Fe(IV)Fe(III), and Fe(IV)2 oxidation states of the metal center seem to be involved in the electron transfer reactions (18Saleh L. Krebs C. Ley B.A. Naik S. Huynh B.H.

Y. usually survives a large number of catalytic cycles, but when it is lost, the inactive Fe(III)2-Met form remains (22Davydov R.M. Davydov A. Ingemarson R. Thelander L. Ehrenberg A. Gräslund A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9093-9100Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Reactivation of the enzyme first requires reduction of the metal site to Fe(II)2, which then must react with O2, leading to the cleavage of the O-O bond and again to the formation of Fe(III)2 and Y.

Logan D.T. Nordlund P. Progr. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2001; 77: 177-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). According to the above reaction sequences, a tyrosine radical and the Fe(IV)Fe(III) state (X) have been anticipated to be decisive for RNR function. This view has been challenged recently because R2 proteins of RNRs in several species have been discovered (24Stephens R.S. Kalman S. Lammel C. Fan L. Marathe R. Aravind L. Mitchell W. Ollinger L.

Chem. 2000; 275: 38111-38119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), containing a redox-inert phenylalanine instead of the tyrosine. One enzyme is found in the important human pathogenic bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) (25Roshick C. Iliffe-Lee E. McClarty G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38111-38119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 26Högbom M. Stenmark P. Voevodskaya N. McClarty G. Gräslund A. Nordlund P. Science. 2004; 305: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). It is a fully functional RNR and the only RNR encoded in the genome of this organism (27Jiang W. Yun D. Saleh L. Barr E.W. Xing G. Hoffart L.M. Maslak M.A. Krebs C. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Science. 2007; 316: 1188-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 28Voevodskaya N. Narvaez A.-J. Domkin V. Torrents E. Gräslund A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9850-9854Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In E. coli, however, the Tyr → Phe exchange abolishes RNR activity (20Tong W. Burdi D. Riggs-Gelasco P. Chen S. Edmondson D. Huynh B.H. Stubbe J. Han S. Arvai A. Tainer J. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5840-5848Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 30Liu A. Sahlin M. Pötsch S. Sjöberg B.M. Gräslund A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 246: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A tyrosyl radical still is not observed in the Phe → Tyr mutant of Ct RNR (31Voevodskaya N. Galander M. Högbom M. Stenmark P. McClarty G. Gräslund A. Lendzian F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1774: 1254-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Ct R2 can be reconstituted with Fe(II) ions so that a typical Fe-Fe cofactor is formed, but in this case, RNR activity is low (28Voevodskaya N. Narvaez A.-J. Domkin V. Torrents E. Gräslund A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9850-9854Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). More recent studies have revealed that a much higher enzyme activity (at least ten times higher) is obtained in the presence of stoichiometric amounts of manganese and iron (27Jiang W. Yun D. Saleh L. Barr E.W. Xing G. Hoffart L.M. Maslak M.A. Krebs C. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Science. 2007; 316: 1188-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 32Voevodskaya N. Lendzian F. Ehrenberg A. Gräslund A. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3351-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Thus, the Ct enzyme now is believed to represent the first RNR that contains a hetero-bimetallic Mn-Fe cluster in its native state. Presumably closely related Mn-Fe sites have been found in purple acid phosphatase from sweet potato (33Schenk G. Boutchard C.L. Carrington L.E. Noble C.J. Moubaraki B. Murray K.S. de Jersey J. Hanson G.R. Hamilton S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19084-19088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and in an N-oxygenase of Streptomyces thioluteus (34Krebs C. Matthews M.L. Jiang W. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 10413-10418Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). These proteins seem to belong to a growing family of O2-activating Mn-Fe enzymes. A large number of crystal structures of Fe-Fe-containing R2 proteins is available in the PDB data base. Consistently, the metal ions are coordinated by conserved amino acids, i.e. four glutamates and two histidines (9Logan D.T. Su X.-D. Åberg A. Regnström K. Hajdu J. Eklund H. Nordlund P. Structure. 1996; 4: 1053-1064Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 35Lange S.J. Que Jr., L. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In addition, a variable number of metal-bound oxygen species (H2O or OH) was detected. In all structures at least one carboxylate group bridges between the metal ions and furthermore, bridging oxo (μO) or hydroxo (μOH) species were observed, their number likely depending on the iron oxidation state. Similar structural features were observed in R2 proteins reconstituted with a Mn-Mn site (36Högbom M. Huque Y. Sjöberg B.M. Nordlund P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1381-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 37Atta M. Nordlund P. Aberg A. Eklund H. Fontecave M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 20682-20688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Crystal structures of Ct R2 containing an Fe-Fe site recently have been reported (26Högbom M. Stenmark P. Voevodskaya N. McClarty G. Gräslund A. Nordlund P. Science. 2004; 305: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 31Voevodskaya N. Galander M. Högbom M. Stenmark P. McClarty G. Gräslund A. Lendzian F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1774: 1254-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Overall, the metal coordination seems to be similar to, e.g. Escherichia coli R2; the significance of certain structural differences is unclear. In previous studies on Ct Mn-Fe RNR, high valent states, i.e. Mn(IV)Fe(III) and Mn(IV)Fe(IV), have been proposed to be involved in catalysis (27Jiang W. Yun D. Saleh L. Barr E.W. Xing G. Hoffart L.M. Maslak M.A. Krebs C. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Science. 2007; 316: 1188-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 32Voevodskaya N. Lendzian F. Ehrenberg A. Gräslund A. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3351-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 38Jiang W. Bollinger Jr., J.M. Krebs C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2007; 129: 7504-7505Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Direct structural information on the Mn-Fe site of Ct R2, in particular in its high valent states, is indispensable to unravel the oxygen activation and ribonucleotide-reduction mechanisms of the tyrosine-less Mn-Fe RNRs. It also may serve as a benchmark for quantum-chemical calculations aiming at optimized structures of the Mn-Fe site. In the present investigation, we use x-ray absorption spectroscopy (39Dau H. Liebisch P. Haumann M. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2003; 376: 562-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar, 40Scott, R. A. (2000) in Que, L. (ed.) Physical Methods in Bioinorganic Chemistry - Spectroscopy and Magnetism, University Science Books, Sausalito, CA, pp. 465–504Google Scholar) at the manganese and iron K-edges and EPR to characterize the Mn-Fe site of Ct RNR in the oxidized R2 protein (R2ox) and in reduced R2 in the R1R2 complex (R2red). The first information on the atomic structure (metal-ligand and metal-metal distances) and electronic configuration of several oxidation states is reported, individually for the manganese and iron ions. Possible structures of the Mn-Fe site are discussed. Protein Sample Preparation—Ct RNR expression vectors for truncated wild-type R1Δ1-248 and wild type R2 proteins were a kind gift of G. McClarty (University of Manitoba, Canada). Recombinant proteins were expressed and purified as described previously (28Voevodskaya N. Narvaez A.-J. Domkin V. Torrents E. Gräslund A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9850-9854Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 31Voevodskaya N. Galander M. Högbom M. Stenmark P. McClarty G. Gräslund A. Lendzian F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1774: 1254-1263Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 32Voevodskaya N. Lendzian F. Ehrenberg A. Gräslund A. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3351-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To obtain Mn-Fe R2 protein, Mn(II) was added as 40 μm MnCl2 to the LB growth medium at the moment of R2 overexpression in the Ct cells, and the Mn(II) level in the medium (30-50 μm) subsequently was controlled by monitoring its six-line EPR signal in the supernatant of the bacterial suspension and by the addition of MnCl2. Protein R2 and R1Δ1-248 concentrations were determined photometrically using extinction coefficients of 116 mm-1 cm-1 and 274 mm-1 cm-1 at 280 nm. The total amount of Mn-Fe sites in R2 was quantified by recording EPR spectra (20 K, 0.8 milliwatt) of the Mn(III)Fe(III) state in a catalytic mixture (50 μm R2, 100 μm R1, 0.3 mm ATP, 1.8 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CDP, 10 mm DTT; incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 0.1 mm hydroxyurea) and signal comparison to a standard solution of 1 mm CuSO4 in 10 mm EDTA (32Voevodskaya N. Lendzian F. Ehrenberg A. Gräslund A. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3351-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Reduction of as-isolated (oxidized) Mn-Fe R2 was achieved by incubation of R2 (∼50 μm and ∼16 ml) with ∼100 μm of R1, 0.3 mm ATP, 1.8 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm DTT at 0 °C overnight under argon. Protein samples were concentrated (Amicon), filled into EPR and XAS sample holders, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Metal Content Quantification—Metal contents of protein samples were assayed by total-reflection x-ray fluorescence detection (TXRF) (41Klockenkämper R. Total Reflection X-ray Fluorescence Analysis. Wiley, London, UK1996Google Scholar) on a PicoFox spectrometer (Bruker). Protein samples were mixed with a galium standard (Sigma, 5 mg/liter), 5 μl of the samples were dried on quartz disks for ∼1 hat ∼50 °C, and disks were mounted on the sample changer of the spectrometer. The excited x-ray fluorescence was recorded for 10 min for five samples each of R2red and R2ox. Iron and manganese concentrations were determined using the routines of the spectrometer and molecular weights of manganese of 54.93 g/mol and iron of 55.84 g/mol. EPR Spectroscopy—9.5-GHz X-band EPR spectroscopy was carried out on a Bruker ESP300E spectrometer equipped with a rectangular microwave cavity. Samples were kept in quartz tubes in an Oxford ESR900 helium cryostat. For further spectrometer settings see the figure legends. For determination of g values the magnetic field was calibrated with a LiF standard (42Stesmans A. Van Gorp G. Rev. Sci. Instruments. 1989; 60: 2949-2952Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Spin quantification was performed by comparison of the double-integrated signal of RNR samples with that of a CuSO4 standard. X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy—Kα fluorescence-detected XAS spectra at the iron and manganese K edges were collected at 20 K using energy-resolving germanium detectors and helium cryostats as previously described (43Löscher S. Schwartz L. Stein M. Ott S. Haumann M. Inorg. Chem. 2007; 46: 11094-11104Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 44Barra M. Haumann M. Loja P. Krivanek R. Grundmeier A. Dau H. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 14523-14532Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) at beamline D2 of the EMBL outstation (at HASYLAB, DESY, Hamburg, Germany) and at beamline KMC-1 of BESSY (Berlin, Germany). Harmonic rejection was achieved by detuning of the Si(111) double-crystal monochromators to 50% (Fe edge) and 70% (Mn edge) of their peak intensities. Deadtime-corrected XAS spectra were averaged (11-28 scans) after energy calibration of each scan (for iron spectra using the peak at 7112 eV in the first derivative of the absorption spectrum of an Fe-foil and for manganese spectra using the pre-edge peak at 6543.3 eV in the absorption spectrum of KMnO4 as energy standards (45Iuzzolino L. Dittmer J. Dörner W. Meyer-Klaucke W. Dau H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17112-17119Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar); estimated accuracy ± 0.1 eV). The respective scan ranges and durations were 6900-8200 eV (up to k = 16 Å-1) and ∼1 h for iron spectra and 6400-7100 eV (up to k = 12 Å-1) and ∼30 min for manganese spectra. One to two scans were performed per sample spot (x-ray spot size of 5 × 1 mm2 set by slits). XAS spectra were normalized, and EXAFS oscillations were extracted as described before (46Dau H. Liebisch P. Haumann M. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2004; 4: 4781-4792Crossref Google Scholar). The energy scale of EXAFS spectra was converted to the wavevector scale (k scale) using E0 values of 7112 eV (iron) and 6540 eV (manganese). Unfiltered k3-weighted spectra were used for least-squares curve-fitting with the in-house software SimX (46Dau H. Liebisch P. Haumann M. Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 2004; 4: 4781-4792Crossref Google Scholar) using phase functions calculated by using FEFF-7 (47Zabinsky S.I. Rehr J.J. Aukudinov A. Albers R.C. Eller M.J. Phys. Rev. B. 1995; 52: 2995-3009Crossref PubMed Scopus (2688) Google Scholar) and for calculation of Fourier transforms (FTs). An amplitude reduction factor, S02, of 0.9 was used in the EXAFS fits. From experimental XANES spectra the pre-edge peak region was extracted by subtraction of a polynomial spline through the main edge rise using the program Xanda. 4K. V. Klementiev, XANES Dactyloscope for Windows, www.desy.de/~klmn/xanda.html. The line shape of the pre-edge features was reproduced by fitting the intensities, I, by a least-squares algorithm to sums of Gaussian functions (Equation 1, EC, center energy). K-edge energies were determined by the “integral method” (39Dau H. Liebisch P. Haumann M. Anal. Bioanal. Chem. 2003; 376: 562-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), using integration limits of 15 and 90% of normalized intensity. Bond-valence-sum (BVS) calculations were performed using a β-value of 0.37 Å, the EXAFS-determined values of metal-ligand distances (Ri), values of R0i for Fe(II)-O of 1.700 Å, Fe(II)-N of 1.769 Å, Fe(III)-O of 1.765 Å, Fe(III)-N of 1.815 Å, Mn(II)-O of 1.765 Å, Mn(II)-N of 1.849 Å, Mn(III)-O of 1.732 Å, Mn(III)-N of 1.837 Å (49Liu W. Thorp H.H. Inorg. Chem. 1993; 32: 4102-4105Crossref Scopus (746) Google Scholar), and Equation 2 (the sum is over all first-sphere coordination shells, weighted by their coordination numbers, Ni). Metal Content and Site Occupancy—Two types of Ct RNR protein samples were used in this spectroscopic study: (a) asisolated, oxidized R2 protein, denoted R2ox, and (b) the same R2 protein extensively reduced with DTT in an R1R2 complex, R2red. The final R2ox protein concentration was ∼0.85 mm R2-dimer. The R2red sample was prepared using the same R2 preparation as for R2ox. After mixing with protein R1 and reduction with DTT, the final R2red protein concentration was ∼0.75 mm R2-dimer. The metal contents of samples were quantified by TXRF and also by previously described spectroscopy methods (32Voevodskaya N. Lendzian F. Ehrenberg A. Gräslund A. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3351-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar); briefly, the manganese content was determined by EPR in an acid-denatured protein sample, and the iron content was spectrophotometrically determined using an iron complex assay). Table 1 summarizes the results. The TXRF and spectroscopy methods to determine the total manganese and iron concentrations were in good agreement, as seen for the data on R2ox. In the estimations shown below we have used the data from the spectroscopy methods. The as-isolated R2 protein (R2ox) used in the XAS experiments was produced under conditions of constant and moderate manganese concentration (40 μm) in the overexpression medium; the iron concentration in the medium was ∼10 μm (supplemental Table S1). This resulted in R2 protein with ∼0.86 manganese per R2-dimer. The amount of Mn-Fe sites in the protein was estimated from the specific EPR signal of the Fe(III)-Mn(III) state (not shown) in the enzymatic mixture after incubation with hydroxyurea (32Voevodskaya N. Lendzian F. Ehrenberg A. Gräslund A. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3351-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The results showed that the R2ox protein contained ∼0.75 Mn-Fe sites per R2-dimer. A slightly larger value can be calculated from the TXRF data (Table 1). We therefore concluded that almost all (close to 90%) of manganese was incorporated in the Mn-Fe sites. The excess iron in the samples (total ∼1.6 iron per R2-dimer) was estimated to ∼0.75 per R2-dimer. At this stage we cannot judge whether the iron not present in the Mn-Fe sites is bound to specific (i.e. dimetal) or unspecific sites.TABLE 1Metal and protein contents of RNR samplesR2redR2oxR2-dimer, μm750 ± 100850 ± 100Fe, μm960 ± 301310 ± 90Mn, μm660 ± 20850 ± 60Fe:Mn1.45: 11.54: 1Fe per R2-dimer1.281.54/1.60aThese values were determined by optical (Fe) and EPR (Mn) spectroscopy in denatured protein.Mn per R2-dimer0.881.00/0.86aThese values were determined by optical (Fe) and EPR (Mn) spectroscopy in denatured protein.Mn-Fe sites per R2-dimerdFrom the TXRF data, Mn-Fe sites per R2-dimer were calculated assuming that manganese only was bound to sites that already contained one iron and neglecting single-Fe/Mn sites.NDbND, not determined.1.00dFrom the TXRF data, Mn-Fe sites per R2-dimer were calculated assuming that manganese only was bound to sites that already contained one iron and neglecting single-Fe/Mn sites./0.75cThis value was determined from the Mn(III)Fe(III) EPR signal in hydroxyurea-treated R2 protein as in Ref. 32.a These values were determined by optical (Fe) and EPR (Mn) spectroscopy in denatured protein.b ND, not determined.c This value was determined from the Mn(III)Fe(III) EPR signal in hydroxyurea-treated R2 protein as in Ref. 32Voevodskaya N.

Open table in a new tab We found that a lower manganese concentration in the overexpression medium resulted in lower overall manganese concentrations in the protein, whereas higher manganese concentrations led to Mn-Mn clusters with a broad EPR signal at g ∼ 2.5 (data not shown, see Ref. 50Boelrijk A.E.M.

The dominance of the Mn-Fe site and sufficient metal concentrations in the R2ox and R2red samples allowed for x-ray absorption experiments both at the iron and manganese K-edges to assess the individual metal site structures. EPR Characterization of Samples—Fig. 1A shows EPR spectra at X-bands of R2ox and R2red, recorded under non-saturating conditions. The signal of R2ox (at high microwave power) is similar, but not identical to the one previously assigned to the Mn(III)Fe(III) state in the R1R2 samples (32Voevodskaya N. Lendzian F. Ehrenberg A. Gräslund A. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3351-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). It reflects antiferromagnetic coupling of the high spin Mn(III) (S = 2) and Fe(III) (S = 5/2) ions to produce a ground-state S = 1/2 system (32Voevodskaya N. Lendzian F. Ehrenberg A. Gräslund A.

Open table in a new tab In a previous study (32Voevodskaya N. Lendzian F. Ehrenberg A. Gräslund A. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 3351-3355Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the Mn(III)Fe(III) state has been obtained in a mixture containing, besides of R2ox protein, also R1 protein, reductant, and nucleotides, so that enzymatic turnover occurred until hydroxyurea was added as an inhibitor to stop the reaction and accumulate the inactive Mn(III)Fe(III) state. Thus, this Mn(III)Fe(III) state was generated after several catalytic cycles. Here, the Mn(III)Fe(III) state in the as-isolated oxidized R2 protein was studied, which was never in a complex with R1 or reacted with hydroxyurea. Interestingly, there are subtle differences in the EPR g- and hf-parameters of the respective Mn(III)Fe(III) states (Table 2). In addition, weak features on the high field side of the EPR spectrum (Fig. 1B) seem to indicate contributions from a second Mn(III)Fe(III) species. We did not attempt to simulate these spectral contributions because of their comparably small magnitude. Evidence for a second Mn(III)Fe(III) species, however, also was obtained from XAS (see below). R2red samples showed an EPR spectrum of manganese (at low microwave power) with a different shape of its six main lines (Fig. 1, A and C). Such a spectrum was expected for a Mn(II) site with significant zero-field splitting D (Table 2, legend), indicating binding of the Mn(II) to the protein. Remarkably, there is no indication in t"
https://openalex.org/W1992927677,"Can neuronal networks produce patterns of activity with millisecond accuracy? It may seem unlikely, considering the probabilistic nature of synaptic transmission. However, some theories of brain function predict that such precision is feasible and can emerge from the non-linearity of the action potential generation in circuits of connected neurons. Several studies have presented evidence for and against this hypothesis. Our earlier work supported the precision hypothesis, based on results demonstrating that precise patterns of synaptic inputs could be found in intracellular recordings from neurons in brain slices and in vivo. To test this hypothesis, we devised a method for finding precise repeats of activity and compared repeats found in the data to those found in surrogate datasets made by shuffling the original data. Because more repeats were found in the original data than in the surrogate data sets, we argued that repeats were not due to chance occurrence. Mokeichev et al. (2007) challenged these conclusions, arguing that the generation of surrogate data was insufficiently rigorous. We have now reanalyzed our previous data with the methods introduced from Mokeichev et al. (2007). Our reanalysis reveals that repeats are statistically significant, thus supporting our earlier conclusions, while also supporting many conclusions that Mokeichev et al. (2007) drew from their recent in vivo recordings. Moreover, we also show that the conditions under which the membrane potential is recorded contributes significantly to the ability to detect repeats and may explain conflicting results. In conclusion, our reevaluation resolves the methodological contradictions between Ikegaya et al. (2004) and Mokeichev et al. (2007), but demonstrates the validity of our previous conclusion that spontaneous network activity is non-randomly organized."
https://openalex.org/W1975060937,"In view of the conventional wisdom in the cardiology literature that apoptosis is extensive early after myocardial ischemia, predicated largely from results with the TUNEL assay known to be nonspecific, this study was performed to delineate its extent with multiple assays and at multiple intervals. Coronary occlusion with and without subsequent revascularization was induced in 10-wk-old C57BL6 mice subjected to 1 or 4 h of transient ligation followed by 24 h of reperfusion, or 24 h persistent ligation. Apoptosis was quantified throughout the left ventricle immunohistochemically by assay of TUNEL, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), and cleaved caspase 3; electron microscopy (EM); and activity assays of caspase 3 and 8. TUNEL staining was marked, but ssDNA and cleaved caspase 3 staining were significantly less (P<0.001 compared with TUNEL), and apoptosis defined by EM was virtually absent in all groups. Caspase 3 and caspase 8 activities per milligram protein were not significantly different from those in normal hearts. Only rare, potentially apoptotic cells were seen by EM in hearts from any group. Thus, the results with TUNEL were not specific, and the extent of apoptosis was markedly less than that predicated on the results with the TUNEL procedure. Apoptosis is de minimus early after transitory or persistent ischemia, though it is overestimated by TUNEL assays. Thus, antiapoptotic interventions per se are not likely to preserve substantial amounts of myocardium early after ischemic insults."
https://openalex.org/W2033464092,"Certain visual stimuli can give rise to contradictory perceptions. In this paper we examine the temporal dynamics of perceptual reversals experienced with biological motion, comparing these dynamics to those observed with other ambiguous structure from motion (SFM) stimuli. In our first experiment, naïve observers monitored perceptual alternations with an ambiguous rotating walker, a figure that randomly alternates between walking in clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW) directions. While the number of reported reversals varied between observers, the observed dynamics (distribution of dominance durations, CW/CCW proportions) were comparable to those experienced with an ambiguous kinetic depth cylinder. In a second experiment, we compared reversal profiles with rotating and standard point-light walkers (i.e. non-rotating). Over multiple test repetitions, three out of four observers experienced consistently shorter mean percept durations with the rotating walker, suggesting that the added rotational component may speed up reversal rates with biomotion. For both stimuli, the drift in alternation rate across trial and across repetition was minimal. In our final experiment, we investigated whether reversals with the rotating walker and a non-biological object with similar global dimensions (rotating cuboid) occur at random phases of the rotation cycle. We found evidence that some observers experience peaks in the distribution of response locations that are relatively stable across sessions. Using control data, we discuss the role of eye movements in the development of these reversal patterns, and the related role of exogenous stimulus characteristics. In summary, we have demonstrated that the temporal dynamics of reversal with biological motion are similar to other forms of ambiguous SFM. We conclude that perceptual switching with biological motion is a robust bistable phenomenon."

However, examination of a data base of helical water-soluble (globular) proteins revealed that nearly one-third contained helices of sufficient length to span a bilayer (≥19 residues) that had mean hydrophobicity ≥actual TM segments. We now report that synthetic peptides corresponding to these globular protein sequences, which we termed “δ-helices,” behave like native TM sequences and readily insert into membrane mimetic environments in helical conformations. As well, certain δ-helix sequences can integrate into the membrane bilayer when placed into a membrane-targeted chimeric protein. We establish that δ-helices can be distinguished computationally from bona fide TM segments by the decreased frequency of occurrence of Ile/Val residues and by their relatively decreased solvent accessibilities (versus other globular helices) within tertiary structure. The further observations that (i) δ-helices generally contain three or more charged residues and (ii) δ-helices display relatively even distribution of these charged residues along their lengths, rather than concentration near their N and C termini as observed for TM segments, may constitute key recognition factors in diverting δ-helices from the membrane in vivo. Although a discrete biological role for δ-helices remains to be pinpointed, our overall results suggest that such segments may be required for globular protein folding and identify additional factors that may be important in the correct selection of TM segments by the cellular machinery.

Despite their centrality in cellular function, little high resolution structural information is currently available for membrane proteins (currently ∼1-2% of the >54,000 structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank). However, from this information two major structural classes of membrane proteins have been elucidated. In one category, proteins embedded in eukaryotic cell membranes and the inner membranes of bacteria and mitochondria generally adopt structures characterized by bundles of α-helical transmembrane (TM) segments. An alternative arrangement where β-strands span the membrane and assemble into barrel-like structures is common to proteins embedded in the bacterial and mitochondrial outer membranes (8Galdiero S. Galdiero M. Pedone C. Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2007; 8: 63-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Because high resolution structural determination of membrane proteins is not yet routine, computer simulation methodologies are often used to evaluate helical protein-protein (9Cuthbertson J.M. Bond P.J. Sansom M.S. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 14298-14310Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and protein-lipid interactions (10Deber C.M. Wang C. Liu L.P. Prior A.S. Agrawal S. Muskat B.L.

Hydropathy plots are commonly utilized to identify from primary sequence both the location of TM segments and their approximate entry/exit points (12Zhao G. London E. Protein Sci. 2006; 15: 1987-2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 13Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar, 14Engelman D.M.

Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The hydropathy values assigned to each residue to create such plots are drawn from one or more scales, among them the Liu-Deber values developed in our laboratory (16Rath A. Deber C.M. Proteins. 2008; 70: 786-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). TM segments and peptides derived from them that meet or exceed a segmentally averaged “threshold” hydropathy on this scale (approximately equivalent to a poly-Ala strand) have been shown to spontaneously insert into micellar media (17Liu L.P. Li S.C. Goto N.K. Deber C.M. Biopolymers. 1996; 39: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The average hydropathy levels of ∼96% of natural TM segments were also found to exceed this threshold value (18Liu L.P. Deber C.M. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1999; 7: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). From these observations, in conjunction with measurements of residue helical propensity in n-butanol (19Liu L.P. Deber C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23645-23648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), our laboratory developed the TM segment prediction program TM Finder (10Deber C.M. Wang C. Liu L.P. Prior A.S. Agrawal S. Muskat B.L. Cuticchia A.J. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) that uses segmental Liu-Deber hydropathy and nonpolar phase helicity values to query primary sequences for potential TM segments. TM Finder demonstrated a 98% predictive value in pinpointing TM segments in a training set of known membrane proteins (10Deber C.M. Wang C. Liu L.P. Prior A.S. Agrawal S. Muskat B.L. Cuticchia A.J. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). TM Finder was additionally specifically trained to limit the occurrence of false positives, i.e. globular (soluble) protein regions mispredicted as membrane-embedded. For this purpose the initial TM Finder code was applied to a sequence data base of globular proteins of known tertiary structure to assess helices that were of sufficient length (estimated at ≥19 residues) to span the membrane bilayer. Of a total 174 α-helical globular protein regions from 134 different proteins in this data base, we observed that ∼30% were identified as potential TM segments from the primary sequence alone but could be separated computationally from bona fide TM sequences based on the presence of ≥3 charged residues. We subsequently termed these TM-like sequences that occur within helical globular proteins as δ-helices to reflect their intermediacy between TM properties and extramembranous localization (20Wang C. Liu L.P. Deber C.M. Fields G.B. Tam J.P. Barany G. Proceedings of the 16th American Peptide Symposium. Springer-Verlag, Minneapolis, Minnesota, MN2000: 367-369Google Scholar). In the present work we sought to extend this preliminary computational separation of δ-helices, globular helices, and TM segments with a view toward understanding the criteria that may serve to distinguish these sequence features of globular proteins from TM segments in vitro or even within the cell. The databases of globular and δ-helices were initially compiled by searching the SwissProt release 34 with the keyword “helix.” The ∼4200 sequences returned by this query were subsequently refined to 174 entries (20Wang C. Liu L.P. Deber C.M. Fields G.B. Tam J.P. Barany G. Proceedings of the 16th American Peptide Symposium. Springer-Verlag, Minneapolis, Minnesota, MN2000: 367-369Google Scholar) as follows: (i) removing all redundant sequences (defined as those >25% identical); (ii) removing sequences with nonstandard amino acids; (iii) removing sequences without high resolution structure coordinates deposited in the Protein Data Bank; (iv) removing segments with <19 residues. The 174 remaining sequences were then divided into globular helices (see supplemental Table S1) and δ-helices (see supplemental Table S2) via submission to TM Finder; those segments with segmental hydropathy values at or above the Liu-Deber insertion threshold (≥0.4 on the Liu-Deber scale, see Ref. 21Liu L.P. Deber C.M. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 41-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) were deemed δ-helices. The data base of TM segment sequences was compiled from a non-redundant (defined as those >25% identical) list of TM α-helices with available high resolution structures. Thirty-seven non-homologous TM proteins were identified containing a total of 212 different TM segments (see supplemental Table S3). Unlike the globular and δ-helix databases, segments shorter than 19 amino acids were retained in the TM data base because the membrane localization of each was confirmed in a high resolution structure (16Rath A. Deber C.M. Proteins. 2008; 70: 786-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Amino acid composition was determined for each segment in each data base by counting the number of each residue and/or group of residues in each individual helix and dividing by helix length to obtain a normalized residue frequency. Mean residue and/or group residue composition values were then calculated for each of the globular helix, TM helix, and δ-helix datasets. For group comparisons, hydrophobic residues were defined as Ala, Cys, Phe, Ile, Leu, Met, Val, Trp, and Tyr, as determined previously (19Liu L.P. Deber C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23645-23648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), polar residues were defined as Asp, Glu, Gly, His, Lys, Asn, Pro, Gln, Arg, Ser, and Thr, and charged residues were defined as Asp, Glu, Lys, and Arg. The overall mean amino acid compositions of globular, TM, and δ-helices were compared with an online one-way analysis of variance test. Pair-wise comparisons of amino acid frequencies among the globular, TM, and δ-helix datasets were performed using t tests. The solvent accessibility of amino acids in globular helices and δ-helices was evaluated by application of the program NACCESS (22Hubbard, S. J., and Thornton, J. M. (1993) NACCESS, 2.1.1 Ed., LondonGoogle Scholar) to structure coordinate files obtained from the Protein Data Bank as described previously (16Rath A. Deber C.M. Proteins. 2008; 70: 786-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) with the following modifications: (i) a probe size of 1.40 Å was used to approximate the radius of a water molecule, and (ii) the relative solvent accessibility for each amino acid was calculated by comparison of calculated solvent accessible surface areas to the default reference set supplied with NACCESS. Helix solvent accessibility was calculated as the sum of the individual residue analysis of variance values in each helix divided by the helix length. Helix solvent accessibility distributions were determined for the globular and δ-helix groups by sorting individual helix solvent accessibility values into bins (0-5%, >5-10%, >10-15%, >15-20%, >20-25%, >25-30%, >30-35%, >35-40%, >40-50%, >50-55%, >55-60%); the mean solvent accessibility values for the globular and δ-helix groups were also calculated from the individual solvent accessibility data. Within the globular and δ-helix groups, the analysis of variance values of residues in the hydrophobic, polar, and charged residue categories defined above were averaged to obtain mean solvent accessibility values. Comparisons of the mean solvent accessibility of hydrophobic, polar, and charged residues between globular and δ-helix segments were performed using t tests. Residues in each helix sequence were sequentially numbered from 1 to n, beginning at the N-terminal residue and ending at the C-terminal residue, such that n represents the total peptide length in residues. The number assigned to each charged residue (Asp, Glu, Lys, and Arg) in each helix sequence was divided by n to obtain a positional value normalized to helix length. Positional values were sorted into bins corresponding to fractions of helix length (≤20%, >20-40%, >40-60%, >60-80%, >80-100%). Numbers of charged residues in each bin were totaled for the globular helix, δ-helix, and TM helix groups. χ2 tests were used to analyze residue distributions. Five δ-helix segments were selected at random from the data base as candidates for in vitro study based on the presence of an intrinsic Trp residue: 1ECA (residues 114-133 of the full-length protein), 1HC1 (residues 218-236), 1MBA (residues 127-145), 2MNR (residues 96-116), and 5LDH (residues 247-266). The boundaries of the δ-helix peptides of 1ECA, 1HC1, 1MBA, 2MNR, and 5LDH were chosen as prescribed by examination of the high resolution structure and the TM Finder output (10Deber C.M. Wang C. Liu L.P. Prior A.S. Agrawal S. Muskat B.L. Cuticchia A.J. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Peptides with sequences corresponding to these δ-helix segments were synthesized with a PS3 peptide synthesizer (Protein Technologies, Inc.) using standard Fmoc chemistry. Additional lysine residues were incorporated into the peptide sequences to increase aqueous solubility as previously described (23Melnyk R.A. Partridge A.W. Yip J. Wu Y. Goto N.K. Deber C.M. Biopolymers. 2003; 71: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). A 4-fold amino acid excess on a 0.1-mmol scale synthesis was used with the O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyl-uronium hexafluorophosphate; N,N-Diisopropylethylamine activator pair. Synthesis utilized a low load (0.18-0.22 mmol/g) PAL-polyethylene glycol-polystyrene resin that produced an amidated C terminus upon peptide cleavage. Peptide cleavage and deprotection was achieved using a mixture of 88% trifluoroacetic acid, 5% phenol, 5% ultrapure water, 2% triisopropylsilane followed by precipitation with ice-cold diethyl ether, drying, and resuspension in ultrapure water. Crude peptides were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography on a C4 preparative column (Phenomenex) with a water/acetonitrile gradient in the presence of 0.01% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptide molecular weights were confirmed by mass spectrometry, and the Micro BCA assay (Pierce) was used to determine peptide concentration. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-720 circular dichroism spectrometer at room temperature. Spectra in aqueous buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 10 mm NaCl) and aqueous buffer with 10 mm SDS were taken using a 0.1-cm path length cuvette at peptide concentrations of 25 μm. A 0.01-cm path length cuvette was used for secondary structure determination at peptide concentrations of 100 μm in aqueous buffer with 50 mm sodium perfluorooctanoate. Fluorescence measurements were carried out in the aqueous and SDS buffer conditions described above on a Hitachi F-400 Photon Technology International C-60 fluorescence spectrometer at an excitation wavelength of 295 nm. Emission spectra were recorded at room temperature from 305 to 405 nm using a peptide concentration of 5 μm. Evaluation of the correlation between Chou-Fasman α-helical propensity (Pα) and peptide mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm was evaluated using the R statistical software package.

Engelman, Yale University (24Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). TOXCAT chimeras fusing the TM sequence of glycophorin A (GpA) and the G83I GpA mutant between the ToxR and maltose-binding protein domains have been previously described (11Johnson R.M. Rath A. Melnyk R.A. Deber C.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8507-8515Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar); chimeras encoding δ-helix sequences instead of the GpA sequence were constructed in an essentially identical manner via restriction digestion of oligonucleotide cassettes encoding each δ-helix segment with NheI and BamHI and subsequent ligation into the NheI and BamHI sites of the pccKAN plasmid. The identity of all constructs was confirmed with DNA sequencing before further characterization. MalE Complementation Test—NT326 cells expressing TOXCAT chimeras with δ-helix sequences, the wild-type GpA TM sequence, or the G83I GpA mutant were streaked onto M9 minimal plates with 0.4% maltose as the only carbon source. Under these conditions, transformants capable of growth must target a portion of the chimeric TOXCAT protein into the cytoplasmic membrane (24Russ W.P. Engelman D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Transformant growth was evaluated for all constructs after incubation for 2 days at 37 °C. Chloramphenicol Acetyltransferase (CAT) Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay—NT 326 cells harboring TOXCAT chimeras were grown at 37 °C, harvested into 1-ml fractions at an A600 of 0.6, pelleted, and stored at -80 °C. Cell lysates were prepared from cell pellets as previously described (11Johnson R.M. Rath A. Melnyk R.A. Deber C.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8507-8515Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and assayed for CAT concentration using the CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Applied Science). A standard curve was generated with CAT provided by the manufacturer. Cells expressing the wild-type GpA and G83I GpA sequences were included in each CAT assay as positive and negative controls, respectively. CAT measurements were performed in at least triplicate and were normalized for the relative expression level of each construct using Western blotting as described (11Johnson R.M. Rath A. Melnyk R.A. Deber C.M. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8507-8515Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Hydropathy of δ-Helices—The globular protein sequences ≥19 residues in length considered in our initial study were divided into globular helix and δ-helix based on their mean segmental Liu-Deber hydropathy values (see “Experimental Procedures”). A data base of confirmed TM α-helical segments was also assembled from a non-redundant set of protein TM segments with available high resolution structures (supplemental Table S3); this TM helix data base contains 212 TM segments from 37 non-redundant proteins. We note that the length criterion of ≥19 residues was not applied to the TM helix data base because each TM segment was identified as residing in the membrane bilayer via high resolution structure determination. The mean Liu-Deber hydropathy of each sequence in the globular, δ-, and TM helix classes was calculated (see supplemental Tables S1-S3) and averaged for each group. We found that the mean hydropathy values of the δ- and TM-helix classes (0.72 ± 0.26 and 1.31 ± 0.69, respectively) each exceeded the Liu-Deber threshold value for membrane insertion (≥0.4, see Ref. 10Deber C.M. Wang C. Liu L.P. Prior A.S. Agrawal S. Muskat B.L. Cuticchia A.J. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), whereas the mean hydropathy value of globular helices (-0.28 ± 0.41) was below this threshold. Therefore, on average, δ-helices have intermediate hydropathy; that is, greater than that observed for globular helices and less than the TM helix value (p ≤ 0.01 in both comparisons). Hydrophobic and Charged/Polar Residue Content in δ-Helices—The amino acid compositions of δ-, globular, and TM helix groups were determined (see “Experimental Procedures”) to investigate whether the intermediate hydropathy of δ-helix segments versus other globular helices and TM segments arose from decreased numbers of hydrophobic residues, increased numbers of polar residues, or both. As expected, TM helix segments contained ∼1.4-fold more hydrophobic, ∼3-fold fewer charged, and ∼2-fold fewer polar residues than globular helices (p < 0.0001, see Table 1). δ-Helix percentage occurrence values in these residue categories, however, presented as different from the TM and globular groups (p < 0.0001) and appeared to be intermediate between them (Table 1). For example, the average percentage occurrence of hydrophobic residues per δ-helix (59.2 ± 6.2%) lies between the globular and TM helix values (47.1 ± 7.8 and 67.3 ± 9.2%, respectively). The distribution of hydrophobic and polar/charged amino acid residue types in δ-helices, thus, appears to be transitional between TM and globular helix segments.TABLE 1Percent occurrence of hydrophobic, polar, and charged residues per helixSegment% HydrophobicaPercentage occurrence values may not sum to 100% due to inclusion of residues Asp, Glu, Lys, and Arg in both the polar and charged categories.

See “Experimental Procedures” for details.b Statistical significance between categories was determined by analysis of variance testing. Errors represent one S.D. of group compositions from the mean. Open table in a new tab Amino Acid Composition of δ-Helices Versus TM and Other Globular Helices—To further probe the origins of the compositional distinctness of δ-helices versus globular and TM segments, we compared individual amino acid percentage occurrence frequency among the three helix categories (Fig. 1). Consistent with the results of other groups (25Senes A. Gerstein M. Engelman D.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 921-936Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), we observed that certain hydrophobic residues (i.e. Phe, Ile, Leu, Val, and Trp; Fig. 1A) were significantly enriched (p ≤ 0.01) in TM helices versus globular helical segments; the situation was reversed for polar and charged residues (i.e. Asp, Asn, Glu, Gln, Gly, His, Lys, and Arg; Fig. 1A). These trends are easily rationalized given the respective intramembranous versus cytoplasmic localization of these sequences in their native proteins. Similarly, we noted that that δ-helices contained significantly more Asp, Glu, Arg, and Lys residues than TM segments (0.05 ≥ p ≤ 0.01, see Fig. 1B), results consistent with our previous observation that the presence of three charged residues could delineate δ-helices as extramembranous (10Deber C.M. Wang C. Liu L.P. Prior A.S. Agrawal S. Muskat B.L. Cuticchia A.J. Protein Sci. 2001; 10: 212-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the observed decrease in hydropathy of δ-helices versus TM segments could be traced to two individual residues, viz. fewer Ile and Val residues are present in δ-helix sequences than in TM segments (p ≤ 0.01); conversely, the content of all other residues classed as hydrophobic is statistically indistinguishable (p ≥ 0.05, Fig. 1B). Overall, the individual residue composition of δ-helices appeared to be more similar to globular than TM segments (compare Fig. 1, B and C); however, δ-helices were significantly enriched in the hydrophobic residues Leu and Phe and depleted in Glu, Lys, and Gln compared with their counterparts in globular proteins (Fig. 1C). In terms of hydropathy, δ-helices, thus, appear to be distinguished from bona fide TM segments based on a decreased content of β-branched hydrophobic residues. δ-Helices Are More Buried within Their Native Folds Than Other Globular Helices—Because δ-helices contain greater percentages of hydrophobic residues and lower percentages of polar/charged residues than other globular helices, we hypothesized that δ-helices might be more buried within their native protein folds. To determine whether this was the case, the locations of δ- and globular helices within their native structures were mapped using a water-sized probe to calculate residue solvent accessibility (see “Experimental Procedures”). Helices within the TM data base were excluded from this analysis due to their established burial within the membrane bilayer. δ-Helices were found on average to be more buried than other globular helices within their native folds (mean solvent accessibility values of 21.0 ± 7.7 versus 28.9 ± 8.4%, p ≤ 0.01). Moreover, the distribution of solvent-accessible residues differs between the δ-helix and globular helix databases (Fig. 2A); the majority of δ-helix segments are 15-20% solvent-accessible, whereas the majority of globular helices have 25-30% accessibility. Rather than being confined to a single residue category, however, the increased accessibility of globular versus δ-helices is reflected across all residue groupings (Fig. 2B), i.e. hydrophobic, polar, and charged residues are ∼1.3-1.4× more exposed in globular versus δ-helices. Folding of the δ-Helix Peptides in Aqueous and Membrane Mimetic Environments—Because δ-helix segments represent sequences that are mispredicted as transmembranous, we initiated experiments to examine the physical properties of δ-helices versus TM helices in vitro. Accordingly, we synthesized peptides corresponding to five δ-helix segments selected from the data base based on the presence of an intrinsic Trp residue for anticipated fluorescence experiments. Segments were selected from 1ECA, 1MBA, 1HC1, 2MNR, and 5LDH; see Table 2 for the corresponding δ-helix sequences. The hydrophobicity of the δ-helix sequences necessitated the introduction of Lys residues at their termini to facilitate synthesis and characterization (23Melnyk R.A. Partridge A.W. Yip J. Wu Y. Goto N.K. Deber C.M. Biopolymers. 2003; 71: 675-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar); such “Lys tags” have been shown not to interfere with the core peptide sequence of interest (19Liu L.P.

N. meningitidis LOS can be serologically divided into 12 immunotypes (L1-12) (1Scholten R.J. Kuipers B. Valkenburg H.A. Dankert J. Zollinger W.D. Poolman J.T. J. Med.

Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1566-1575Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, novel LOS structures continue to be reported. N. meningitidis LOS has a conserved core composed of Glc1Hep2KDO2-Lipid A. Structural motifs observed in N. meningitidis LOS are shown in Scheme 1. Emanating from this conserved core are α-, β-, and γ-chains, and structural variation can be imparted to the LOS in these regions. There are two alternative α-chains, which include lacto-N-neotetraose (LNT) and globobiose. Both can be capped with NeuAc as seen in immunotypes L2 (3Gamian A. Beurret M. Michon F. Brisson J.R.

Brisson J.R. Jennings H.J. Can. J. Chem. 1989; 68: 1029-1034Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The β-chain extends from the C3 of the core Hep II residue, and in N. meningitidis this extension is limited to addition of Glcα1,3- (6Michon F. Beurret M. Gamian A. Brisson J.R. Jennings H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7243-7247Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The γ-chain consists of a GlcNAcα1,2- from the core Hep II. It can be present in 3-O-acetylated or unacetylated forms (9Kahler C.M. Lyons-Schindler S. Choudhury B. Glushka J. Carlson R.W. Stephens D.S. J. Biol.

Along with Glcα1,3- substitution, it can also be C7-substituted with Gly (3Gamian A. Beurret M. Michon F. Brisson J.R. Jennings H.J. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2002; 269: 4169-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and C3, C6, and C7 can be substituted with phosphoethanolamine (PEA). The genes encoding the phosphoethanolaminyltransferases, Lpt3 and Lpt6, have been isolated (11Kahler C.M. Datta A. Tzeng Y.L. Carlson R.W. Stephens D.S. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 12O'Connor E.T. Piekarowicz A. Swanson K.V. Griffiss J.M. Stein D.C. J.

J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 1039-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Inactivation of Lpt6 prevents addition of both C6 and C7 addition of PEA to Hep II, and therefore it has been concluded that lpt6 catalyzes the addition of both additions (9Kahler C.M. Lyons-Schindler S. Choudhury B. Glushka J. Carlson R.W. Stephens D.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19939-19948Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). No other phosphoethanolaminyltransferase homologue has been detected in Neisseria. The presence of PEA-disubstituted Hep II is rare and has only been reported in strains with a truncated α-chain (11Kahler C.M. Datta A. Tzeng Y.L. Carlson R.W. Stephens D.S. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 14Cox A.D. Li J. Brisson J.R. Moxon E.R. Richards J.C. Carbohydr. Res. 2002; 337: 1435-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). It has been speculated that, in the absence of the α-chain phosphoethanolaminyltransferases Lpt3 and Ltp6 have greater access to the core Hep II, and this was likely the reason for the enhanced substitution. There is considerable interest in Neisseria LOS in vaccine design and development. Hep II C3 PEA has been shown to bind complement C4b. Antibodies that bind this motif are bactericidal and have been shown to facilitate opsonophagocytosis (15Ram S. Ngampasutadol J. Cox A.D. Blom A.M. Lewis L.A. St Michael F. Stupak J. Gulati S.

Moxon E.R. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 43: 931-943Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Monoclonal antibodies to this motif have been shown to provide passive immunity against some strains. Strains with LOS containing the 3′-PEA of Hep II and an α-chain LNT or those with the sialo-LNT form tend not to produce antibodies with bactericidal activity. This result has led researchers to speculate that the α-chain somehow shields the 3′-PEA Hep II region from immune recognition and processing. However, antibodies raised against the inner core can provide passive immunity. A monoclonal antibody raised to the LOS of a galE, an α-chain-deficient strain, has been shown to provide passive protection in mice against a number of N. meningitidis strains (18Plested J.S. Harris S.L. Wright J.C. Coull P.A. Makepeace K. Gidney M.A. Brisson J.R. Richards J.C. Granoff D.M. Moxon E.R. J. Infect. Dis. 2003; 187: 1223-1234Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Certainly, additional strains with truncated α-chain and core Hep II PEA substitution could be of value for vaccine research.

Inoculation of mice with outer membrane vesicles from both encapsulated and non-encapsulated M986 strains has been shown to provide protection against lethal doses of endotoxin and infective doses of live bacteria (19Quakyi E.K. Frasch C.E. Buller N. Tsai C.M. J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 180: 747-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These strains have also been used to investigate immune regulatory properties of N. meningitidis (26Faro J. Seoane R. Lareo I. Eiras A. Schiller M. Regueiro B.J. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1987; 176: 289-303PubMed Google Scholar, 27Faro J. Seoane R. Lareo I. Eiras A. Couceiro J. Regueiro B.J. Med. Microbiol. Immunol. 1987; 176: 131-141PubMed Google Scholar) and both LOS and outer membrane vesicles enhance granulocyte recovery in myelosuppressed mice (22Quakyi E.K. Carter P.H. Tsai C.M. Marti G.E. Pathobiology. 1997; 65: 26-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In this study the LOS structures of a non-encapsulated strain of M986 and three of its variants, selected based on altered colony opacity, were investigated. M986 LOS reacts strongly with L7, moderately with L4, and has low activity with L2, L3, L6, and L8 antisera (25Tsai C.M. Mocca L.F. Frasch C.E. Infect. Immun. 1987; 55: 1652-1656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple reactivities across immunotypes suggested that structural motifs from each may be present in M986. The interest in M986 as a tool for immune system and vaccine research warrants a thorough investigation of its LOS structural repertoire and its variants. Here the LOS structures of M986 and three of its variants are reported, and implications of these findings for immunological and vaccine research are discussed. Strain Designation—It has been noted that a decrease in opacity correlates with changes in LOS structure. Using an opacity designation, as compared with the wild-type strain, a variant can range from a score of -2 through +2, where the former indicates low opacity and the later indicates a high degree of opacity. These designations were used in isolation of the M986 variants studied here. Therefore, the strains studied here are referred to as M986 OP1+, OP2-, and OP2+. Isolation of LOS—LOS samples were isolated from wild-type and mutant strains grown in Catlin medium (32Tsai C.M. Boykins R. Frasch C.E. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 155: 498-504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by the hot phenol/water extraction procedure (33Gu X.X. Tsai C.M. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 196: 311-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 34Galanos C. Luderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 9: 245-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (1366) Google Scholar). The samples were extracted with phenol/water again, and the LOS in the aqueous phase was precipitated by the addition of 2 volumes acetone, and washed twice with 95% ethanol. Analysis of LOS by SDS-PAGE, silver staining, and Western blotting was performed as described previously (35Tsai C.M. Kao G. Zhu P. Infect Immun. 2002; 70: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Meningococcal mouse monoclonal antibody 9-2-L3,7 for Western blotting was a generous gift from Dr. W. D. Zollinger of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Washington, D. C., and its binding specificity with LOS immunotypes has been described elsewhere (1Scholten R.J. Kuipers B. Valkenburg H.A. Dankert J. Zollinger W.D. Poolman J.T. J. Med. Microbiol. 1994; 41: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Chemical Methods—LOS was deacylated by hydrazinolysis as previously described (36Gibson B.W. Melaugh W. Phillips N.J. Apicella M.A. Campagnari A.A. Griffiss J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 2702-2712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 5 mg of LOS was placed in a 25-ml glass centrifuge tube, and 1.1 ml of anhydrous hydrazine was added. The sample was placed in a water bath at 37 °C for 20 min with occasional sonication. The sample was then cooled to -20 °C, and 5.5 ml of cold acetone was added dropwise. The precipitated deacylated LOS was recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was washed once again with acetone. The deacylated LOS pellet was dried and resuspended in 0.5 ml of distilled H2O. To yield the free oligosaccharide LOS was subjected to mild acid hydrolysis. 1-1.5 mg of LOS was dried and resuspended in 300 μl of 2 m acetic acid, and then incubated at 80 °C for 3 h. The hydrolysate was then dried in a Savant vacuum centrifuge and resuspended in 1% butanol. Mass Spectrometry—MALDI-TOF MS analysis was performed on a Perseptive Biosystems Voyager DE RP mass spectrometer. Spectra were collected in linear negative ion mode. Approximately 100 to 150 shots from the 337 nm laser were collected and summed. Laser pulses were 3 ns in length. Spectra were calibrated externally using a maltooligosaccharide ladder. Ion-trap MS was performed on a ThermoFinnigan LCQ deca mass spectrometer equipped with a electrospray ion source. The following mass spectrometer parameters were used: capillary temperature, 170 °C; ion spray voltage, 3.5 Kv. Normalized collision energies were set between 25 and 30%, and an isolation width of 2 amu was used. Sheath gas was used. Solvent was 50% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. LC/MS experiments were collected on the same instrument in line with a ThermoQuest Surveyor LC system equipped with a Tosch Biosystems TSK Amide-80 column (1 × 150 mm, 5 μ). Solvent A was 70% acetonitrile, 5 mm NH4OAc. Solvent B was 2% acetonitrile, 5 mm NH4OAc. The gradient was as follows: 5% solvent A for 5 min, 5-70% solvent A over 30 min, hold at 70% solvent A for 5 min, followed by re-equilibration at 5% solvent A for 20 min. Samples consumed in analyses were ∼3-4 μg. High Field NMR—High field 1H NMR experiments were conducted on a 300-MHz Bruker NMR instrument. The one-dimensional experiments were collected at 298 K over 3002 Hz using 16,000 points of digitization. Samples were externally referenced to tetramethylsilane (TMS) using an internal standard of acetone at 2.225 ppm. Either 512 or 1,000 scans were collected for each sample depending on abundance of sample material. Monosaccharide Analysis—LOS samples in water (1 mg/ml) were treated with 1% acetic acid at 100 °C for 2 h to generate oligosaccharides, lipid A, and KDO by splitting labile KDO linkages. Lipid A was removed by ultracentrifugation at 350,000 × g for 1 h using a Beckman Optima TXL tabletop ultracentrifuge. The supernatants were lyophilized to remove acetic acid. This residue containing oligosaccharide and free KDO were reconstituted with water to original volumes. For hexose and amino sugar analyses, oligosaccharide samples were hydrolyzed at 100 °C for 6 h in 2 n trifluoroacetic acid and 4 n HCl, respectively (37Hardy M.R. Townsend R.R. Lee Y.C. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar). After removal of trifluoroacetic acid or HCl by SpeedVac, the samples were dissolved in water. Unhydrolyzed oligosaccharide samples were used for KDO analysis. Monosaccharides in the samples were analyzed using a high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection, a Dionex ICS3000 HPLC system (Sunnyvale, CA) with a CarboPak PA1 column, an ED40 detector, and Chromeleon software. The monosaccharides in samples were eluted off the column using a combination of 11 mm NaOH (A) and 1 m sodium acetate with 200 mm NaOH (B) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The eluting program consisted of an isocratic 11 mm NaOH (100%) for 15 min and then a gradient generated by of 65% A and 35% B at 35 min using curve 9 of the Chromeleon software. The column was washed with B for next 5 min (curve 8) followed by 200 mm NaOH for 3 min and re-equilibrated with 11 mm NaOH for 12 min for each run. The monosaccharides in the column eluent were monitored by using the ED40 detector with pulsed amperometric detection. A five-sugar mixture of glucosamine, galactose, glucose, l-glycero-d-mannoheptose (heptose), and KDO had the retention times of 12.5, 14.7, 16.3, 28.4, and 38.6 min, respectively. Linkage Analysis—For glycosyl linkage analysis, the samples were permethylated, hydrofluoric acid-treated, ethylated, depolymerized, reduced, and acetylated, and the resultant partially methylated and partially ethylated alditol acetates were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) as previously described (11Kahler C.M. Datta A. Tzeng Y.L. Carlson R.W. Stephens D.S. Glycobiology. 2005; 15: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Initially, an aliquot of sample was permethylated using a slightly modified version of Ciucanu and Kerek (38Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3191) Google Scholar). The samples were then loaded onto Waters C18 Sep Paks, which were rinsed with water and 15% acetonitrile, followed by sample elution with acetonitrile followed by isopropanol. Material was then dried in Teflon test tubes and treated with 200 μl of 48% hydrofluoric acid overnight. After drying, samples were suspended in DMSO and allowed to incubate over 96 h at room temperature to promote dissolution. Samples were then ethylated using the Ciucanu procedure described above but replacing methyl iodide with ethyl iodide followed by extraction of the samples into dichloromethane. The material was hydrolyzed using 2 m trifluoroacetic acid (2 h in sealed tube at 121 °C), reduced with NaB2H4, and acetylated using acetic anhydride/trifluoroacetic acid. The resulting partially methylated partially ethylated alditol acetates were analyzed on a Hewlett-Packard 5890 GC interfaced to a 5970 MSD mass-selective detector operated in electron impact ionization mode. Separation was performed on a 30-meter Supelco 2330 bonded phase fused silica capillary column. Structural Analysis: Rational and Summary—O-Deacylated LOS from each strain was analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS to reveal compositional and structural features of the deacylated lipid A. O-Deacylated Lipid A discussed in the following sections will be referred to as Lipid A for the purposes of brevity. More structural detail was revealed by analysis of lipid released oligosaccharide (OS) by ion-trap MS and tandem MS experiments with and without LC/MS interface. Monosaccharide analysis was also performed, and linkage configuration was confirmed by high field NMR analysis. To verify positional information concerning PEA residues, GC/MS analysis of the partially methylated partially ethylated alditol acetates was performed. Results show that M986 LOS is unique in terms of its overall structure. Structural characteristics include an LNT α-chain, 3,6/7-diphosphoethanolaminyl heptose, and a γ-chain consisting of GlcNAcα1,2- linked to Hep II where 50% of that GlcNAc is O-acetylated at C3. Truncated forms of the full-length LOS are fairly abundant in the M986 parent. Opacity variants OP1, OP2-, and OP2+ are increasingly truncated in the listed order. OP1 LOS was missing terminal α-chain Galβ1,4-. OP2- LOS was missing α-chain Galβ1,4GlcNAcβ1,3-. OP2+ LOS was severely truncated and contained only core KDO residue and Hep I of the core. It should be noted that fragmentation data were collected for all ions listed in Table 1, and common ions across the parent and variant strains produced nearly identical spectra supporting the notion that the strains produce the same general structures albeit with increasing amounts of truncation as described previously. Monosaccharide data of the intact LOS confirmed the components in each strain to be either canonical or truncated forms of the canonical LOS. The structural arguments leading to these structural assignments appear below.TABLE 1High-performance anion-exchange chromatography monosaccharide analysisMonosaccharide molar ratioStrainM986OP+OP2−OP2+GlcN1.21.40.74TraceGal0.930.600.00.0Glc1.01.01.00.0Hep0.350.350.361.3KDO0.660.790.611.0 Open table in a new tab Structural Assignment of M986 LOS—Hydrazine-deacylated LOS was examined by MALDI-TOF MS in linear negative mode (Fig. 1A). Each LOS was typically detected as a series of sodium-adducted molecular ions. Major peaks from LOS derived from M986 were present at m/z 2387.4 and 2915.8. These were consistent with Hex1HexNAc1Hep2Pea2-KDO2Lipid A and Hex3HexNAc2Hep2Pea2KDO2Lipid A, respectively, which match the canonical core with α-chain LNT and two PEA residues on Hep II as shown in Scheme 1. Monosaccharide analysis was performed by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography analysis. It should be noted that in this method GlcNAc is detected as a GlcN. Results are shown in Table 1. Molar ratios of GlcN, Gal, Glc, Hep, and KDO support the presence of an LOS series with an LNT α-chain and a γ-chain consisting of GlcNAc, which is consistent with MALDI-TOF MS results. LOS were hydrolyzed under mild acid conditions to liberate the OS from lipid A. In this process the glycosidic bond between the KDO proximal to the Lipid A is broken. KDO II is lost as its glycosidic bond is labile under releasing conditions. The released OSs were then examined by LC/MS as described under “Experimental Procedures.” In some instances offline MS OS interrogation was performed. MS spectra produced from OS that eluted between 12 and 30 min were summed and are shown in Fig. 2A. The detected peaks and their assigned compositions are shown in Table 2. The compositions detected were consistent with OS predicted from MALDI-TOF MS analyses, but more glycomers were revealed. Truncated forms were observed with compositions consistent with sequential loss of monosaccharides from the α-chain, and these were confirmed by tandem MS analysis (data not shown). Additionally, a +42 peak shadowed nearly all major peaks revealing a series of glycoforms with an additional OAc moiety. For instance the Hex3HexNAc2Hep2PEA2 peak at m/z 1761.4 is flanked by another at m/z 1803.4. The peaks corresponding to added OAc are nearly the same intensity as the main peaks indicating that the glycoforms are likely to be present in nearly the same abundances. All major peaks were consistent with compositions that contained two PEA residues. There were minor species containing one PEA.TABLE 2Oligosaccharides detected by ion-trap MS in M986 and variant strainsCompositionaDiastereomer assignments are based on a combination of the above, monosaccharides (Table 1), and NMR (Table 3).Observed mass ionsMolecular massM986OP1OP2−OP2+[M+H]+[M+2H]2+ObservedCalculatedHep1KDO1 − H2O+ NH4430.12430.12430.132xHep1KDO1+ NH4448.12bIndicates ammonia adduct.448.12448.120xGlc1GlcNAc1Hep2KDO1PEA11111.241110.231110.34xxxGlc1GlcNAc1Hep2KDO1PEA1OAc1153.241152.231152.34xxGlc1GlcNAc1Hep2KDO1PEA21072.211071.201071.29xxxGlc1GlcNAc1Hep2KDO1PEA2OAc1114.171113.161113.30xxxGlc1GlcNAc1Hep2KDO1PEA21234.23617.791233.391233.35xxxGlc1GlcNAc1Hep2KDO1PEA2OAc1276.22638.661275.261275.36xxxGal1Glc1GlcNAc1Hep2KDO1PEA21396.23698.821395.421395.40xxxGal1Glc1GlcNAc1Hep2KDO1PEA2OAc1438.20719.801437.391437.41xxxGal1Glc1GlcNAc2Hep2KDO1PEA11476.161475.151475.47xxxGal1Glc1GlcNAc2Hep2KDO1PEA21599.19800.371598.451598.48xxGal1Glc1GlcNAc2Hep2KDO1PEA2OAc1641.21821.401640.491640.49xxGal2Glc1GlcNAc2Hep2KDO1PEA11637.951636.941637.52xGal2Glc1GlcNAc2Hep2KDO1PEA21761.24881.421760.531760.53xGal2Glc1GlcNAc2Hep2KDO1PEA2OAc1803.23902.421802.521802.54xa Diastereomer assignments are based on a combination of the above, monosaccharides (Table 1), and NMR (Table 3).b Indicates ammonia adduct.

https://openalex.org/W2100366927,"Generic antiretroviral therapy is the mainstay of HIV treatment in resource-limited settings, yet there is little evidence confirming the bioequivalence of generic and brand name formulations. We compared the steady-state pharmacokinetics of lamivudine, stavudine and nevirapine in HIV-infected subjects who were receiving a generic formulation (Triomune) or the corresponding brand formulations (Epivir, Zerit, and Viramune).An open-label, randomized, crossover study was carried out in 18 HIV-infected Ugandan subjects stabilized on Triomune-40. Subjects received lamivudine (150 mg), stavudine (40 mg), and nevirapine (200 mg) in either the generic or brand formulation twice a day for 30 days, before switching to the other formulation. At the end of each treatment period, blood samples were collected over 12 h for pharmacokinetic analysis. The main outcome measures were the mean AUC(0-12h) and C(max). Bioequivalence was defined as a geometric mean ratio between the generic and brand name within the 90% confidence interval of 0.8-1.25. The geometric mean ratios and the 90% confidence intervals were: stavudine C(max), 1.3 (0.99-1.71) and AUC(0-12h), 1.1 (0.87-1.38); lamivudine C(max), 0.8 (0.63-0.98) and AUC(0-12h), 0.8 (0.65-0.99); and nevirapine C(max), 1.1 (0.95-1.23) and AUC(0-12h), 1.1 (0.95-1.31). The generic formulation was not statistically bioequivalent to the brand formulations during steady state, although exposures were comparable. A mixed random effects model identified about 50% intersubject variability in the pharmacokinetic parameters.These findings provide support for the use of Triomune in resource-limited settings, although identification of the sources of intersubject variability in these populations is critical."
https://openalex.org/W2085452716,"Background Initiation and modification of antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected children depend on viral load and CD4+ T-cell count. However, these surrogates have limitations, and complementary immunological markers to assess therapeutic response are needed. Our aim was to evaluate CD8+ T-cell expression of CD127 as a marker of disease status in HIV-infected children, based on adult data suggesting its usefulness. We hypothesized that CD127 expression on CD8+ T-cells is lower in children with more advanced disease. Methods In a cross-sectional evaluation, we used flow cytometry to measure CD127+ expression on CD8+ T-cells in whole blood from HIV-infected children with varying disease status. This was compared with expression of CD38 on this subset, currently used in clinical practice as a marker of disease status. Results 51 HIV-infected children were enrolled. There was a strong positive correlation between CD127 expression on CD8+ T-cells and CD4+ T-cell count, and height and weight z-scores, and a strong negative correlation between CD127 expression and viral load. In contrast, we found no association between CD38 expression and these disease status markers. Conclusions CD8+ T-cell CD127 expression is significantly higher in children with better HIV disease control, and may have a role as an immunologic indicator of disease status. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine the utility of this marker as a potential indicator of HIV disease progression."
