https://openalex.org/W2150264392,"The crystal structure of bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase at 2.8 A resolution with an R value of 19.9 percent reveals 13 subunits, each different from the other, five phosphatidyl ethanolamines, three phosphatidyl glycerols and two cholates, two hemes A, and three copper, one magnesium, and one zinc. Of 3606 amino acid residues in the dimer, 3560 have been converged to a reasonable structure by refinement. A hydrogen-bonded system, including a propionate of a heme A (heme a), part of peptide backbone, and an imidazole ligand of CuA, could provide an electron transfer pathway between CuA and heme a. Two possible proton pathways for pumping, each spanning from the matrix to the cytosolic surfaces, were identified, including hydrogen bonds, internal cavities likely to contain water molecules, and structures that could form hydrogen bonds with small possible conformational change of amino acid side chains. Possible channels for chemical protons to produce H2O, for removing the produced water, and for O2, respectively, were identified."

The APC protein binds to the cellular adhesion molecule beta-catenin, which is a mammalian homolog of ARMADILLO, a component of the WINGLESS signaling pathway in Drosophila development. Here it is shown that when beta-catenin is present in excess, APC binds to another component of the WINGLESS pathway, glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta), a mammalian homolog of Drosophila ZESTE WHITE 3. APC was a good substrate for GSK3 beta in vitro, and the phosphorylation sites were mapped to the central region of APC. Binding of beta-catenin to this region was dependent on phosphorylation by GSK3 beta."

https://openalex.org/W2054566340,"Zinc is present in presynaptic nerve terminals throughout the mammalian central nervous system and likely serves as an endogenous signaling substance. However, excessive exposure to extracellular zinc can damage central neurons. After transient forebrain ischemia in rats, chelatable zinc accumulated specifically in degenerating neurons in the hippocampal hilus and CA1, as well as in the cerebral cortex, thalamus, striatum, and amygdala. This accumulation preceded neurodegeneration, which could be prevented by the intraventricular injection of a zinc chelating agent. The toxic influx of zinc may be a key mechanism underlying selective neuronal death after transient global ischemic insults."

https://openalex.org/W2008019124,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) regulates many aspects of cellular function. A member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) family, TAK1, was previously identified as a mediator in the signaling pathway of TGF-beta superfamily members. The yeast two-hybrid system has now revealed two human proteins, termed TAB1 and TAB2 (for TAK1 binding protein), that interact with TAK1. TAB1 and TAK1 were co-immunoprecipitated from mammalian cells. Overproduction of TAB1 enhanced activity of the plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 gene promoter, which is regulated by TGF-beta, and increased the kinase activity of TAK1. TAB1 may function as an activator of the TAK1 MAPKKK in TGF-beta signal transduction."

https://openalex.org/W2005381354,"The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans is a model system for the study of the genetic basis of aging. Maternal-effect mutations in four genes--clk-1, clk-2, clk-3, and gro-1--interact genetically to determine both the duration of development and life-span. Analysis of the phenotypes of these mutants suggests the existence of a general physiological clock in the worm. Mutations in certain genes involved in dauer formation (an alternative larval stage induced by adverse conditions in which development is arrested) can also extend life-span, but the life extension of Clock mutants appears to be independent of these genes. The daf-2(e1370) clk-1(e2519) worms, which carry life-span-extending mutations from two different pathways, live nearly five times as long as wild-type worms."
https://openalex.org/W1968546256,"The absence of CTLA-4 results in uncontrolled T cell proliferation. The T cell receptor-specific kinases FYN, LCK, and ZAP-70 as well as the RAS pathway were found to be activated in T cells of Ctla-4−/− mutant mice. In addition, CTLA-4 specifically associated with the tyrosine phosphatase SYP, an interaction mediated by the SRC homology 2 (SH2) domains of SYP and the phosphotyrosine sequence Tyr-Val-Lys-Met within the CTLA-4 cytoplasmic tail. The CTLA-4-associated SYP had phosphatase activity toward the RAS regulator p52SHC. Thus, the RAS pathway and T cell activation through the T cell receptor are regulated by CTLA-4-associated SYP."

https://openalex.org/W2054971033,"Highly correlated neural activity in the form of spontaneous waves of action potentials is present in the developing retina weeks before vision. Optical imaging revealed that these waves consist of spatially restricted domains of activity that form a mosaic pattern over the entire retinal ganglion cell layer. Whole-cell recordings indicate that wave generation requires synaptic activation of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on ganglion cells. The only cholinergic cells in these immature retinas are a uniformly distributed, bistratified population of amacrine cells, as assessed by antibodies to choline acetyltransferase. The results indicate that the major source of synaptic input to retinal ganglion cells is a system of cholinergic amacrine cells, whose activity is required for wave propagation in the developing retina."

https://openalex.org/W2018216158,"During pituitary organogenesis, the progressive differentiation of distinct pituitary-specific cell lineages from a common primordium involves a series of developmental decisions and inductive interactions. Targeted gene disruption in mice showed that Lhx3, a LIM homeobox gene expressed in the pituitary throughout development, is essential for differentiation and proliferation of pituitary cell lineages. In mice homozygous for the Lhx3 mutation, Rathke's pouch formed but failed to grow and differentiate; such mice lacked both the anterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary. The determination of all pituitary cell lineages, except the corticotrophs, was affected, suggesting that a distinct, Lhx3-independent ontogenetic pathway exists for the initial specification of this lineage."

https://openalex.org/W2085252478,"The adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC) is mutated in familial adenomatous polyposis and in sporadic colorectal tumors, and its product binds to the adherens junction protein beta-catenin. Overexpression of APC blocks cell cycle progression. The APC-beta-catenin complex was shown to bind to DLG, the human homolog of the Drosophila discs large tumor suppressor protein. This interaction required the carboxyl-terminal region of APC and the DLG homology repeat region of DLG. APC colocalized with DLG at the lateral cytoplasm in rat colon epithelial cells and at the synapse in cultured hippocampal neurons. These results suggest that the APC-DLG complex may participate in regulation of both cell cycle progression and neuronal function."
https://openalex.org/W2055267308,"The vectorial movement of proteins requires specific recognition by components of the vesicular trafficking machinery. A protein, sorting nexin-1 (SNX1), was identified in a human cell line that bound to a region of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) containing the lysosomal targeting code. SNX1 contains a region of homology to a yeast vacuolar sorting protein, and overexpression of SNX1 decreased the amount of EGFR on the cell surface as a result of enhanced rates of constitutive and ligand-induced degradation. Thus, SNX1 is likely to play a role in sorting EGFR to lysosomes."
https://openalex.org/W1979769420,"The threshold at which antigen triggers lymphocyte activation is set by the enzymes that regulate tyrosine phosphorylation. Upon T cell activation, the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 was found to bind to the protein tyrosine kinase ZAP-70. This interaction resulted in an increase in SHP-1 phosphatase activity and a decrease in ZAP-70 kinase activity. Expression of a dominant negative mutant of SHP-1 in T cells increased the sensitivity of the antigen receptor. Thus, SHP-1 functions as a negative regulator of the T cell antigen receptor and in setting the threshold of activation."
https://openalex.org/W2043347159,"Replication fork pause (RFP) sites transiently arresting replication fork movement were mapped to transfer RNA (tRNA) genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in vivo. RFP sites are polar, stalling replication forks only when they oppose the direction of tRNA transcription. Mutant tRNA genes defective in assembly of transcription initiation complexes and a temperature-sensitive RNA polymerase III mutant (rpc160-41) defective in initiation of transcription do not stall replication forks, suggesting that transcription is required for RFP activity."

https://openalex.org/W2018691974,"Spermatozoa from a number of species can be cryopreserved and then subsequently used to fertilize eggs1. However, this technique has several limitations. First, the freezing protocol varies for each species and must be determined empirically, and for some species appropriate methods have not yet been identified1,2. Second, because these cells are fully differentiated, they will not undergo replication when thawed, and recombination of genetic information cannot occur. We now demonstrate, by using the recently developed spermatogonial transplantation technique3,4, that male germline stem cells can be successfully cryopreserved. Donor testis cells isolated from prepubertal or adult mice and frozen from 4 to 156 days at −196 °C were able to generate spermatogenesis in recipient seminiferous tubules. Relatively standard preservation techniques were used, suggesting that male germ cells from other species can also be stored for long periods. Because transplanted testis stem cells will ultimately undergo replication and meiotic recombination during spermatogenesis, one might consider these preserved male germ lines as biologically immortal."

https://openalex.org/W2167357910,"The entorhinal cortex provides the major cortical input to the hippocampus, and both structures have been implicated in memory processes. The dynamics of neuronal circuits in the entorhinal-hippocampal system were studied in slices by optical imaging with high spatial and temporal resolution. Reverberation of neural activity was detected in the entorhinal cortex and was more prominent when the inhibition due to gamma-aminobutyric acid was slightly suppressed. Neural activity was transferred in a frequency-dependent way from the entorhinal cortex to the hippocampus. The entorhinal neuronal circuit could contribute to memory processes by holding information and selectively gating the entry of information into the hippocampus."

https://openalex.org/W1988039099,"Glycogen storage disease type 1a (GSD-1a) is caused by a deficiency in microsomal glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), the key enzyme in glucose homeostasis. A G6Pase knockout mouse which mimics the pathophysiology of human GSD-1a patients was created to understand the pathogenesis of this disorder, to delineate the mechanisms of G6Pase catalysis, and to develop future therapeutic approaches. By examining G6Pase in the liver and kidney, the primary gluconeogenic tissues, we demonstrate that glucose-6-P transport and hydrolysis are performed by separate proteins which are tightly coupled. We propose a modified translocase catalytic unit model for G6Pase catalysis."

https://openalex.org/W2000227815,"The retinal cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cGMP) phosphodiesterase (PDE) is a key regulator of phototransduction in the vertebrate visual system. PDE consists of a catalytic core of alpha and beta subunits associated with two inhibitory gamma subunits. A gene-targeting approach was used to disrupt the mouse PDEgamma gene. This mutation resulted in a rapid retinal degeneration resembling human retinitis pigmentosa. In homozygous mutant mice, reduced rather than increased PDE activity was apparent; the PDEalphabeta dimer was formed but lacked hydrolytic activity. Thus, the inhibitory gamma subunit appears to be necessary for integrity of the photoreceptors and expression of PDE activity in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2056688875,Little is known about the integral membrane proteins that participate in the early secretory pathway of mammalian cells. The complementary DNA encoding a 28-kilodalton protein (p28) of the cis-Golgi was cloned and sequenced. The protein was predicted to contain a central coiled-coil domain with a carboxyl-terminal membrane anchor. An in vitro assay for endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi transport was used to show that p28 participates in the docking and fusion stage of this transport event. Biochemical studies established that p28 is a core component of the Golgi SNAP receptor (SNARE) complex.

https://openalex.org/W1989808775,"Postsynaptic activity may modulate presynaptic functions by transsynaptic retrograde signals. At developing neuromuscular synapses in Xenopus nerve-muscle cultures, a brief increase in the cytosolic calcium ion (Ca2+) concentration in postsynaptic myocytes induced persistent depression of presynaptic transmitter secretion. This depression spread to distant synapses formed by the same neuron. Clearance of extracellular fluid did not prevent the spread of depression, and depression could not be induced by increasing the Ca2+ concentration in a nearby myocyte not in contact with the presynaptic neuron. Thus, the spread of depression is mediated by signaling in the presynaptic cytoplasm, rather than by a retrograde factor in the extracellular space."
