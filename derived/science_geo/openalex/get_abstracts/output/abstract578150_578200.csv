https://openalex.org/W2574604975,"Immunotherapies based on immune checkpoint blockade are highly effective in a subset of patients. An ongoing challenge is the identification of biomarkers that predict which patients will benefit from these therapies. Aneuploidy, also known as somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), is widespread in cancer and is posited to drive tumorigenesis. Analyzing 12 human cancer types, we find that, for most, highly aneuploid tumors show reduced expression of markers of cytotoxic infiltrating immune cells, especially CD8+ T cells, and increased expression of cell proliferation markers. Different types of SCNAs predict the proliferation and immune signatures, implying distinct underlying mechanisms. Using published data from two clinical trials of immune checkpoint blockade therapy for metastatic melanoma, we found that tumor aneuploidy inversely correlates with patient survival. Together with other tumor characteristics such as tumor mutational load, aneuploidy may thus help identify patients most likely to respond to immunotherapy."

These mutations can lead to clonal expansion of the mutant blood cells, which increases the risk of blood cancers and cardiovascular disease. Fuster et al. generated a mouse model to investigate how one of these genes, Tet2 , affects atherosclerosis development (see the Perspective by Zhu et al. ). They found that the disease progressed more rapidly in mice transplanted with Tet2 -deficient bone marrow cells. This was due to increased secretion of interleukin-1β by Tet2 -deficient macrophages in a process that depended on the action of inflammasomes. Science , this issue p. 842 ; see also p. 798"

Here, we report that the Arabidopsis SITE-1 PROTEASE (S1P) cleaves endogenous RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) propeptides to inhibit plant immunity. This inhibition is mediated by the malectin-like receptor kinase FERONIA (FER), which otherwise facilitates the ligand-induced complex formation of the immune receptor kinases EF-TU RECEPTOR (EFR) and FLAGELLIN-SENSING 2 (FLS2) with their co-receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1-ASSOCIATED KINASE 1 (BAK1) to initiate immune signaling. We show that FER acts as a RALF-regulated scaffold that modulates receptor kinase complex assembly. A similar scaffolding mechanism may underlie FER function in other signaling pathways."

Our results suggest a bidirectional interaction between attention and learning: attention constrains learning to relevant dimensions of the environment, while we learn what to attend to via trial and error. The framework of reinforcement learning (RL) has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of the neurobiology of trial-and-error learning and decision making (Lee et al., 2012Lee D. Seo H. Jung M.W. Neural basis of reinforcement learning and decision making.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 35: 287-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Yet, despite the widespread success of RL algorithms in explaining behavior and neural activity on simple learning tasks, these same algorithms become notoriously inefficient as the number of dimensions in the environment increases (Bellman, 1957Bellman R. Dynamic Programming. Princeton University Press, 1957Google Scholar, Sutton and Barto, 1998Sutton R.S. Barto A.G. Introduction to Reinforcement Learning. MIT Press, 1998Crossref Google Scholar). Nevertheless, animals and humans faced with high-dimensional learning problems on a daily basis seem to solve them with ease. How do we learn efficiently in complex environments? One possibility is to employ selective attention to narrow down the dimensionality of the task (Jones and Canas, 2010Jones M. Cañas F.

Niv Y. Inferring relevance in a changing world.Front. Hum. Neurosci. 2012; 5: 189Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Selective attention prioritizes a subset of environmental dimensions for learning while generalizing over others, thereby reducing the number of different states or stimulus configurations that the agent must consider. However, attention must be directed toward dimensions of the environment that are important for the task at hand (i.e., dimensions that predict reward) to provide learning processes with a suitable state representation (Gershman and Niv, 2010Gershman S.J. Niv Y. Learning latent structure: carving nature at its joints.Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2010; 20: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, Wilson et al., 2014Wilson R.C. Takahashi Y.K.

What dimensions are relevant to any particular task is not always known and might itself be learned through experience. In other words, for attention to facilitate learning, we might first have to learn what to attend to. We therefore hypothesize that a bidirectional interaction exists between attention and learning in high-dimensional environments. To test this, we had human participants perform a RL task with compound stimuli—each comprised of a face, a landmark, and a tool—while we scanned their brain using fMRI. At any one time, only one of the three stimulus dimensions was relevant to predicting reward, mimicking real-world learning problems where only a subset of dimensions in the environment is relevant for the task at hand. Using eye tracking and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) of fMRI data, we obtained a quantitative measure of participants’ attention to different stimulus dimensions on each trial. We then used trial-by-trial choice data to test whether attention biased participants’ valuation of stimuli, their learning from prediction errors, or both processes. We generated estimates of participants’ choice value and outcome-related prediction errors using the best-fitting model and regressed these against brain data to further determine the influence of attention on neural value and prediction error signals. Finally, we analyzed trial-by-trial changes in the focus of attention to study how attention was modulated by ongoing experience and to search for neural areas involved in the control of attention. 25 participants performed a learning task with multidimensional stimuli and probabilistic reward (“Dimensions Task,” Figure 1A). On each trial, participants chose one of three compound stimuli—each comprised of a face, a landmark, and a tool—receiving point rewards. In any one game, only one stimulus dimension (e.g., tools) was relevant for predicting reward. Within that dimension, one “target feature” (e.g., wrench) was associated with a high probability of reward (p = 0.75) and other features were associated with a low probability of reward (p = 0.25). The relevant dimension and target feature changed every 25 trials, and this change was signaled to participants (“New game starting”). Through trial and error, participants learned to choose the stimulus containing the target feature over the course of a game (Figures 1B and 1C). We defined a learned game as one in which participants chose the target feature on every one of the last five trials. By this metric, participants learned on average 11.3 (SE = 0.7) out of 25 games. The number of learned games did not depend on the relevant dimension (F(2,24) = 0.886, p = 0.42). We obtained two quantitative trial-by-trial measures of participants’ attention to each dimension. First, using eye tracking, we computed the proportion of time participants looked at each dimension on each trial. Second, using MVPA, we quantified face-, landmark-, and tool-selective neural activity on each trial (Norman et al., 2006Norman K.A. Polyn S.M. Detre G.J. Haxby J.V. Beyond mind-reading: multi-voxel pattern analysis of fMRI data.Trends Cogn. Sci. 2006; 10: 424-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1668) Google Scholar; see Experimental Procedures). Each measure provided a vector of three “attention weights” per trial, denoting the proportion of attention toward each of the dimensions on that trial. Average attention weights were similar across dimensions (Figures S1 and S2), indicating that neither measure was biased toward a particular dimension. The two measures were only moderately correlated (r = 0.34, SE = 0.03), suggesting that the separate measures were not redundant. We therefore used their smoothed product as a composite measure of attention on each trial, which we incorporated into different RL models (see Experimental Procedures). Attention can modulate RL in two ways. First, attention can bias choice by differentially weighing features in different dimensions when computing the value of a composite, multidimensional stimulus. Second, attention can bias learning such that the values of features on attended dimensions are updated more as a result of a prediction error. To test whether and how attention modulated learning in our task, we fit four different RL models to the trial-by-trial choice data. In all four models, we assumed that participants chose between the available stimuli based on their expected value, computed as a linear combination of “feature values” associated with the three features of each stimulus, and that feature values were updated after every trial using a prediction error signal (Figure 2) (Rescorla and Wagner, 1972Rescorla R.A. Wagner A.R. A theory of Pavlovian conditioning: variations in the effectiveness of reinforcement and nonreinforcement.in: Black A.H. Prokasy W.F. Classical Conditioning II: Current Research and Theory. Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1972: 64-99Google Scholar, Sutton and Barto, 1998Sutton R.S. Barto A.G. Introduction to Reinforcement Learning. MIT Press, 1998Crossref Google Scholar). In the “uniform attention” (UA) model, all dimensions were weighted equally when computing and updating values. That is, the value of a stimulus was the average values of all its features, and once the outcome of the choice was revealed, the prediction error was equally divided among all features of the chosen stimulus. In the “attention at choice” (AC) model, the value of each stimulus was computed as a weighted sum of feature values, with attention to the respective dimensions on that trial serving as weights. All dimensions were still weighted equally at learning. In contrast, in the “attention at learning” (AL) model, the update of feature values was differentially weighted by attention; however, all dimensions were equally weighted when computing the value of stimuli for choice. Finally, the “attention at choice and learning” (ACL) model combined the AC and AL models so that both choice and learning were biased by attention. The free parameters of each model were fit to each participant’s choices (see Experimental Procedures; Table S1). To assess how well the models explained participants’ behavior, we used a leave-one-game-out cross-validation procedure to compute the likelihood per choice for each participant (Experimental Procedures). The higher the average choice likelihood, the better the model predicted the data of that participant. As a second metric for model comparison, we computed the Bayesian information criterion (BIC; Schwarz, 1978Schwarz G. Estimating the dimension of a model.Ann. Stat. 1978; 6: 461-464Crossref Google Scholar) for each model. In all cases, using the composite attention measure provided a better fit to the data than if we used the MVPA measure or the eye-tracking measure alone (Figure S4); hence, we use the composite attention measure in subsequent analyses unless otherwise noted (see Figures S1–S3 for characterization of the three attention measures). Both model-performance metrics showed that the ACL model, in which attention modulated both choice and learning, outperformed the other three models (Figure 3). Average likelihood per trial for the ACL model was highest for 21 of 25 subjects, on average significantly higher than that for the AC (t24 = 4.72, p < 0.001), AL (t24 = 6.70, p < 0.001), and UA (t24 = 8.61, p < 0.001) models (Figure 3A). Both the AC and AL models also yielded significantly higher average likelihood per trial than the UA model (AC: t24 = 8.03, p < 0.001; AL: t24 = 7.20, p < 0.001). Model comparison using BIC confirmed that the ACL model has the lowest (i.e., best) BIC score (Figure 3B). Moreover, the average likelihood per trial of the ACL model diverged significantly from that of the other models early in the game, when performance was still well below asymptote (as early as trial 2 for AL and UA and from trial 7 for AC; Figure 3C). These results were not driven by the learned portion of games (in which participants may have focused solely on the relevant dimension), as they held when tested on unlearned games only (Figure S5). The ACL model used the same set of attention weights for choice and learning; however, previous theoretical and empirical work suggest that attention at choice might focus on stimuli or features that are most predictive of reward (Mackintosh, 1975Mackintosh N.J. A theory of attention: variations in the associability of stimuli with reinforcement.Psychol. Rev. 1975; 82: 276-298Crossref Scopus (2073) Google Scholar), whereas at learning, one might focus on features for which there is highest uncertainty (Pearce and Hall, 1980Pearce J.M. Hall G. A model for Pavlovian learning: variations in the effectiveness of conditioned but not of unconditioned stimuli.Psychol. Rev. 1980; 87: 532-552Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). To test whether attention at learning and attention at choice were separable, we took advantage of the higher temporal resolution of the eye-tracking measure. We considered eye positions from 200 ms after stimulus onset to choice as indicating “attention at choice” and eye positions during the 500 ms of outcome presentation as a measurement of “attention at learning.” Attention at choice and attention at learning on the same trial were moderately correlated (average r = 0.56), becoming increasingly correlated over the course of a game (F(24,24) = 4.95, p < 0.001; Figure S6). This suggests that as participants figured out the relevant dimension, they attended to the same dimension in both phases of the trial. When we fit the ACL model using attention at choice to bias value computation and attention at learning to bias value update, the model performed slightly, but significantly, better than the ACL model that used whole-trial attention weights for both choice and learning (Figure S7). This suggests that attentional processes at choice and at learning may reflect dissociable contributions to decision making (see also Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Overall, these results suggest that attention processes biased both how values were computed during choice and how values were updated during learning. Notably, the partial attention models (AC and AL) also explained participants’ behavior better than the model that assumed uniform attention across dimensions (UA), providing additional support for the role of attention in participants’ learning and decision-making processes. Having found behavioral evidence that attention biased both choice and learning, we hypothesized that neural computations would exhibit similar biases. Previous work has identified two neural signals important for RL processes—an expected value signal in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC; e.g., Hare et al., 2011Hare T.A. Malmaud J. Rangel A. Focusing attention on the health aspects of foods changes value signals in vmPFC and improves dietary choice.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 11077-11087Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, Krajbich et al., 2010Krajbich I. Armel C. Rangel A.

Rangel A. The decision value computations in the vmPFC and striatum use a relative value code that is guided by visual attention.J. Neurosci. 2011; 31: 13214-13223Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) and a reward prediction error signal in the striatum (e.g., O’Doherty et al., 2004O’Doherty J. Dayan P. Schultz J. Deichmann R. Friston K. Dolan R.J. Dissociable roles of ventral and dorsal striatum in instrumental conditioning.Science. 2004; 304: 452-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar, Seymour et al., 2004Seymour B. O’Doherty J.P.

Temporal difference models describe higher-order learning in humans.Nature. 2004; 429: 664-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Our four models made different assumptions about how attention biases choice and learning and, as such, generated different estimates of expected value and prediction error on each trial. To test which model was most consistent with the neural value representation, we entered the trial-by-trial value estimates of the chosen stimulus generated by all four models into a single GLM (GLM1 in Experimental Procedures). This allowed us to search the whole brain for clusters of brain activity whose variance was uniquely explained by one of the models while simultaneously controlling for the value estimates of the other models. Results showed that activity in the vmPFC was significantly correlated with the value estimates of the ACL model (Figure 4A), suggesting that the computation and update of the value representation in vmPFC was biased by attention. No clusters were significantly correlated with the value estimates of the AC and AL model; one cluster in the visual cortex was significantly correlated with the value estimates of the UA model (Table S2). Next, we investigated whether neural prediction error signals were also biased by attention. For this, we entered trial-by-trial prediction error regressors generated by each of the four models into a single whole-brain GLM (GLM2 in Experimental Procedures). Prediction errors generated by the ACL model were significantly correlated with activity in the striatum (Figure 4B; Table S2), the area most commonly associated with prediction error signals in fMRI studies. Prediction error estimates of the other models were not significantly correlated with any cluster in the brain. Together, these results provide neural evidence that attention biases both the computation of subjective value as well as the prediction errors that drive the updating of those values. In our previous analyses, we demonstrated that attention biased both choice and learning. In the subsequent analyses, we focus on the other side of the bidirectional relationship, examining how learning modulates attention. As a measure of participants’ attention bias (i.e., how strongly participants were attending to one dimension rather than the other two), we computed the standard deviation (SD) of the three attention weights on each trial. Low SD corresponded to relatively uniform attention, while high SD implied that attention was more strongly directed to a subset of dimensions. Participants’ attention bias increased over the course of a game (linear mixed effects model, main effect of trial: t(24) = 2.79, p = 0.01), and the increase was marginally greater for learned games than for unlearned games (trial number × learned games interaction: t(22.5) = 1.8, p = 0.08, Figure S3A), as expected from a narrowing of attention when participants learn the target feature and relevant dimension. In parallel, the correlation between the vectors of attention weights for consecutive trials increased steadily over the course of a game, consistent with attention becoming increasingly consistent across trials (main effect of trial number: t(24.0) = 5.6, p < 0.001, Figure S3B). This effect was also more pronounced for learned games than for unlearned games (trial × learned games interaction: t(36.5) = 2.96, p = 0.005). Next, we asked whether learned value (i.e., expected reward) modulated where participants directed their attention. We found that the most strongly attended dimension was often also the dimension with the feature of highest value (M = 0.61, SE = 0.02; significantly higher than chance, p < 0.001 bootstrap test, see Supplemental Experimental Procedures), suggesting that attention was often directed toward aspects of the stimuli that had acquired high value. We then tested the interaction between expected reward and the strength of the attention bias. A tercile split on the trials based on the strength of attention bias revealed that the proportion of trials in which attention was directed to the dimension with the highest feature value was higher when attention bias was strong (first tercile, M = 0.72, SE = 0.03) than when attention bias was moderate (second tercile, M = 0.61, SE = 0.02) and weak (third tercile, M = 0.49, SE = 0.02) (p < 0.001 for all differences, Figure 5A). We also predicted that feature values would modulate attention such that the greater the difference in feature values across dimensions, the greater the attention bias toward the feature of the highest value. To test this prediction, we performed a tercile split of each participant’s data based on the standard deviation of the values (SDV) of the highest-valued feature in each dimension, a measure of the difference in feature values across dimensions. Attention bias was stronger on high SDV trials than on middle (p = 0.030) and low (p = 0.027) SDV trials (Figure 5B) and marginally higher for the middle SDV trials compared to the low SDV trials (p = 0.067). Taken together, these results suggest that learned values modulated where participants attended to and the strength of their attention bias. Building on these results, we hypothesized that attention switches would be more likely when feature values were similar across dimensions. We defined an attention switch as a change in the maximally attended dimension. Our attention measurements suggested that participants switched their focus of attention on approximately one-third of the trials (M = 8.28 [SE = 0.4] switch trials per 25-trial game). Switches were more frequent on low SDV trials than on middle (p = 0.014) and high (p = 0.004) SDV trials. Switches were also more frequent on middle SDV trials than on high SDV trials (p = 0.002) (Figure 5C). To determine the influence of recent reward on attention switches, we ran a logistic regression predicting attention switches from outcome (reward versus no reward) on the preceding five trials. We found that absence of reward in previous trials (up to four trials back) was a significant predictor of attention switches on the current trial t (p < 0.01), with regression coefficients decreasing and no longer significantly different from zero at trial t-5 (t24 = 1.72, p = 0.09; Figure 5D). In other words, participants were more likely to switch their focus of attention after a string of no reward, and feedback on more recent trials had a greater influence than trials further back in the past. Finally, we complemented these analyses with a model-based analysis of attention. Here, we compared different models of the trial-by-trial dynamic allocation of attention (see Experimental Procedures). In particular, we tested whether attention allocation could be better explained by choice history (i.e., attention was enhanced for features that have been previously chosen), reward history (i.e., attention was enhanced for features that had been previously rewarded), or learned value (i.e., attention was enhanced for features associated with higher value over the course of a game). Cross-validated model comparison revealed that the empirical attention data were best explained by a model that tracked feature values. In particular, the “Value” model outperformed the next-best “Recent Reward History” model for both the eye-tracking (lowest root-mean-square deviation [RMSD] in 17/25 subjects, paired-sample t test, t(24) = 2.77, p < 0.05, Figure 5E) and composite attention (lowest RMSD in 18/25 subjects, paired-sample t test, t(24) = 2.41, p < 0.05, Figure S8) measures. For the MVPA data, the Value model did not significantly improve upon the predictions of the Recent Reward History model (lowest RMSD in 16/25 subjects, paired-sample t test, t(24) = 1.02, p = 0.31, Figure 5F); however, it still performed significantly better than the “Recent Choice History” model (paired-sample t test, t(24) = 3.83, p < 0.001). In summary, both model-based and model-free results suggest that attention was dynamically modulated by ongoing learning. As participants learned to associate value with features over the course of a game, attention was directed toward dimensions with features that acquired high value (which, in our task, are also the features that are most predictive of reward) in accord with Mackintosh’s theory of attention (Mackintosh, 1975Mackintosh N.J. A theory of attention: variations in the associability of stimuli with reinforcement.Psychol. Rev. 1975; 82: 276-298Crossref Scopus (2073) Google Scholar). The greater the feature values in a dimension, the stronger the attention bias was toward that dimension. Conversely, when feature values across dimensions were similar, attention was less focused and switches between dimensions were more likely. Finally, attention was better explained as a function of learned value rather than simpler models of reward or choice history. Our results suggest that ongoing learning and feedback dynamically modulated participants’ deployment of attention. How might the brain be realizing these attention dynamics? To answer this, we searched for brain areas that were more active during switches in attention. As in our previous analyses, we labeled trials on which the maximally attended dimension was different from that of the preceding trial as switch trials and the rest as stay trials. A contrast searching for more activity on switch rather than stay trials (GLM3 in Experimental Procedures) showed clusters in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), intraparietal sulcus (IPS), frontal eye fields (FEF), pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA), precuneus, and fusiform gyrus (Figure 6; Table S3). These brain regions are part of a frontoparietal network that has been implicated in the executive control of attention (Corbetta and Shulman, 2002Corbetta M. Shulman G.L. Control of goal-directed and stimulus-driven attention in the brain.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2002; 3: 201-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (8638) Google Scholar, Petersen and Posner, 2012Petersen S.E. Posner M.I. The attention system of the human brain: 20 years after.Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 2012; 35: 73-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1856) Google Scholar). Our results suggest that this attentional-control system also supports top-down allocation of attention during learning and decision making in multidimensional environments. We next asked whether this network was activated only by attention switches, or perhaps it was involved in the accumulation of evidence leading up to an attention switch. The latter hypothesis would predict that activity in these regions would ramp up on trials prior to a switch. To test for this, we defined regions of interest (ROIs) in the dlPFC, IPS, and preSMA using Neurosynth (http://neurosynth.org). For each ROI, we extracted the mean time course during each run and modeled these data using a GLM with regressors for attention switch trials, as well as four trials preceding each switch (GLM4 in Experimental Procedures). In all three ROIs, we found that activity increased only on attention-switch trials and not the trials preceding them, suggesting that this network was involved in switching attention rather than accumulating evidence for the switch (Figure 7). Finally, we searched for the neural mechanism mediating the interaction between learning and attention. For this, we performed a psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis that searched for brain areas that exhibit enhanced functional connectivity with the vmPFC that is specific to switch trials or to stay trials (GLM5 in Experimental Procedures). This showed that connectivity between parts of the frontoparietal attention network and vmPFC differed according to whether participants switched attention on the current trial or not: bilateral dlPFC and preSMA (as well as the striatum and ventrolateral PFC) were significantly anti-correlated with vmPFC on stay trials, above and beyond the baseline functional connectivity between these regions (Figure 8; Table S4). This suggests that as value—signaled by the vmPFC—increased, activity in the dlPFC and preSMA decreased, reducing the tendency to switch attention between task dimensions (and vice versa when the value signal decreased). The connectivity on switch trials was not significantly different from baseline. However, we note that interpretations of the direction of interaction are difficult as they are relative to the baseline connectivity between vmPFC and other regions (as modeled in the GLM), and therefore the above interpretation should be treated with caution. Learning and attention play complementary roles in facilitating adaptive decision making (Niv et al., 2015Niv Y. Daniel R. Geana A. Gershman S.J. Leong Y.C. Radulescu A. Wilson R.C.

To this end, we investigated the post-transcriptional regulation of YTHDF2. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that the microRNA miR-145 might target the 3′-untranslated region (3′-UTR) of YTHDF2 mRNA. The levels of miR-145 were negatively correlated with those of YTHDF2 mRNA in clinical hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tissues, and immunohistochemical staining revealed that YTHDF2 was closely associated with malignancy of HCC. Interestingly, miR-145 decreased the luciferase activities of 3′-UTR of YTHDF2 mRNA. Mutation of predicted miR-145 binding sites in the 3′-UTR of YTHDF2 mRNA abolished the miR-145-induced decrease in luciferase activity. Overexpression of miR-145 dose-dependently down-regulated YTHDF2 expression in HCC cells at the levels of both mRNA and protein. Conversely, inhibition of miR-145 resulted in the up-regulation of YTHDF2 in the cells. Dot blot analysis and immunofluorescence staining revealed that the overexpression of miR-145 strongly increased m6A levels relative to those in control HCC cells, and this increase could be blocked by YTHDF2 overexpression. Moreover, miR-145 inhibition strongly decreased m6A levels, which were rescued by treatment with a small interfering RNA-based YTHDF2 knockdown. Thus, we conclude that miR-145 modulates m6A levels by targeting the 3′-UTR of YTHDF2 mRNA in HCC cells. N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) is a prevalent modification present in the mRNAs of higher eukaryotes. YTH domain family 2 (YTHDF2), an m6A “reader” protein, can recognize mRNA m6A sites to mediate mRNA degradation. However, the regulatory mechanism of YTHDF2 is poorly understood.

There are about 7600 mRNA transcripts, and more than 300 non-coding RNAs contain the m6A sites in humans (1.Chandola U. Das R. Panda B.

Among the enzymes involved in the system, YTH domain family 1 (YTHDF1) and YTH domain family 2 (YTHDF2) are demonstrated selectively binding m6A sites as reader proteins. YTHDF1 can regulate mRNA translation efficiency, whereas YTHDF2 is reported to have influence in regulating mRNA degradation and cell viability (11.Wang X. Lu Z. Gomez A. Hon G.C. Yue Y. Han D. Fu Y.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous 21–24 nucleotides RNAs that can play significant regulatory roles by targeting mRNAs for cleavage or translational repression. In mammals, the miRNAs introduce the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to the 3′-untranslated regions (3′-UTRs) of mRNA targets, and the translation of the mRNAs is impeded by base complementary (15.Bartel D.P.

MiRNAs post-transcriptionally repress gene expression by base pairing to mRNAs. More than half of all mRNAs are estimated to be targets of miRNAs, and each miRNA is predicted to regulate about hundreds of targets (18.Gurtan A.M. Sharp P.A.

The current study demonstrates that miR-145 is involved in the different diseases, such as cardiac myofibroblast differentiation, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and microvasculature (21.Caruso P.

In addition, miR-145 is also associated with different kinds of human cancers, in which miR-145 regulates PAK4 in human colon cells and is down-regulated in human ovarian cancer and so on (24.Wu H.

Zong H. miR-145 inhibits proliferation and invasion of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in part by targeting c-Myc.Onkologie. 2013; 36: 754-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Moreover, miRNA-145 is down-regulated in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (30.Wang G. Zhu S. Gu Y. Chen Q. Liu X. Fu H. MicroRNA-145 and MicroRNA-133a inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion, while promoted apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells via targeting FSCN1.Digest. Dis.

It is reported that miR-145 can inhibit HCC through targeting IRS1 and its downstream effectors (32.Wang Y. Hu C. Cheng J. Chen B. Ke Q. Lv Z. Wu J. Zhou Y. MicroRNA-145 suppresses hepatocellular carcinoma by targeting IRS1 and its downstream Akt signaling.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2014; 446: 1255-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In this study we investigated the regulatory mechanism of YTHDF2 in liver cancer cells. Interestingly, we identified that miR-145 was involved in targeting YTHDF2 mRNA in the regulation of mRNA m6A. Our finding provides new insights into the regulatory mechanism of YTHDF2 in mRNA methylation. It has been reported that YTHDF2 plays significant roles in m6A regulation systems. However, the significance of YTHDF2 in cancer is poorly understood. We examined the expression of YTHDF2 in clinical HCC tissues via immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining using tissue arrays. Our data revealed that the control group without treatment with anti-YTHDF2 antibody (Fig. 1A, left) was negative, suggesting that the specificity of the antibody was suitable for IHC staining. The test group (right) showed that the positive signals of YTHDF2 staining were located in the cytoplasm and nucleus in HCC tissues (Fig. 1). The positive rate of YTHDF2 was 35.6% (67/188) in the tissues, in which 83.9% (26/31) was in grade III HCC tissues, suggesting that YTHDF2 is closely associated with the malignance of HCC. Next, we investigated the post-transcriptional regulation YTHDF2. We focused on the effects of miRNAs on YTHDF2. Bioinformatics analysis predicted the potential miRNAs targeting the 3′-UTR of YTHDF2 by using three websites, including DIANA-microT, Targetscan, and MiRanda (33.Liu H. Liu Y. Liu W. Zhang W. Xu J. EZH2-mediated loss of miR-622 determines CXCR4 activation in hepatocellular carcinoma.Nat. Commun. 2015; 6: 8494Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Interestingly, eight candidate miRNAs could be predicted (Fig. 1B). Among them, miR-145 had the highest score in all three websites. Western blot analysis screening showed that miR-145 could remarkably suppress the expression of YTHDF2 in HepG2 cells (Fig. 1, C and D), suggesting that miR-145 is involved in the regulation of YTHDF2 mRNA. Then, real-time PCR revealed that the expression levels of miR-145 were significantly reduced in 30 clinical HCC samples relative to their adjacent peritumorous tissues (p < 0.001, n = 30; Wilcoxon's signed-rank test). The expression level of miR-145 was relative to U6 (Fig. 1E). Moreover, we observed that the expression levels of miR-145 were negatively correlated with those of YTHDF2 mRNA in HCC tissues (Pearson' correlation coefficient, r = −0.5045, p < 0.01; Fig. 1F). Thus, we conclude that YTHDF2 may be one of the target genes of miR-145. Next, we tried to identify whether miR-145 could regulate YTHDF2 expression at post-transcriptional level. Bioinformatics analysis showed that there were two target sites of miR-145 in the 3′-UTR of YTHDF2 mRNA (Fig. 2A). Then, we cloned the 3′-UTR of YTHDF2 mRNA (termed pGL3-YTHDF2-WT) and its three mutants (termed pGL3-YTHDF2-mut 1, pGL3-YTHDF2-mut 2, and pGL3-YTHDF2-mut 1 + 2). The mutants were randomly designed following the principles that it could not produce another miR-145 binding site (Fig. 2B). Luciferase reporter gene assays elucidated that miR-145 could decrease the luciferase activities through targeting the 3′-UTR of YTHDF2 mRNA in 293T cells. But it failed to work when both target sites were mutated in the cells (Fig. 2C). However, miR-145 inhibitor resulted in the opposite results (Fig. 2D), suggesting that YTHDF2 mRNA is one of the targets of miR-145. Collectively, we conclude that miR-145 directly targets the 3′-UTR of YTHDF2 mRNA. To further validated the effect of miR-145 on the expression of YTHDF2, we performed the transient transfection of miR-145 in HepG2 cells. Interestingly, we observed that YTHDF2 was down-regulated in miR-145-overexpressed HepG2 cells at the levels of mRNA and protein in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). The opposite results were obtained when the cells were treated with miR-145 inhibitor (Fig. 3B), suggesting that miR-145 is able to suppress the expression of YTHDF2 in HCC cells. In addition, the transfection efficiency of miR-145 and miR-145 inhibitor was validated by real-time PCR analysis (Fig. 3, A and B). It has been reported that YTHDF2 can down-regulate SON DNA binding protein (SON) and CREB-binding protein (CREBBP) (11.Wang X. Lu Z. Gomez A. Hon G.C. Yue Y. Han D. Fu Y. Parisien M. Dai Q. Jia G. Ren B. Pan T. He C. N6-methyladenosine-dependent regulation of messenger RNA stability.Nature. 2014; 505: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). As expected, real-time PCR showed that miR-145 up-regulated the mRNA levels of SON and CREBBP in HepG2 cells. Meanwhile, si-YTHDF2 also worked well in the system (Fig. 3C). Conversely, anti-miR-145 down-regulated the mRNA levels of SON and CREBBP in the cells (Fig. 3D). Overexpression of YTHDF2 did well in the system, supporting that miR-145 is able to down-regulate YTHDF2 in HCC cells. We conclude that miR-145 is able to down-regulate YTHDF2 at the levels of mRNA and protein. Given that YTHDF2 can recognize mRNA m6A sites to mediate mRNA degradation (11.Wang X. Lu Z. Gomez A. Hon G.C. Yue Y. Han D. Fu Y. Parisien M. Dai Q. Jia G. Ren B. Pan T. He C. N6-methyladenosine-dependent regulation of messenger RNA stability.Nature. 2014; 505: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar, 13.Du H. Zhao Y. He J. Zhang Y. Xi H. Liu M. Ma J. Wu L. YTHDF2 destabilizes m(6)A-containing RNA through direct recruitment of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 12626Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar), the degradation of mRNAs can result in the decrease of m6A levels. Thereby, we were interested in whether miR-145 could affect m6A levels of mRNAs through modulating YTHDF2 in HCC cells. Dot blot assays revealed that overexpression of YTHDF2 could decrease the m6A levels of mRNAs in HepG2 cells (Fig. 4, A and B). Moreover, immunofluorescence staining validated the data (Fig. 4, C and D). Interestingly, we observed that miR-145 increased the m6A levels of mRNAs in the cells, which could be blocked by overexpression of YTHDF2 (Fig. 4, E and F). Immunofluorescence staining also confirmed the data (Fig. 4, G and H). Conversely, si-YTHDF2 led to the opposite results in the cells (Fig. 5A-D). But the treatment with miR-145 inhibitor could decrease the m6A levels of mRNAs, which could be rescued by si-YTHDF2 in the cells (Fig. 5, E–G), suggesting that miR-145 can increase the m6A levels of mRNAs through modulating YTHDF2. In addition, we also evaluated the effect of YTHDF1, a member of YTH domain family, on m6A levels of mRNAs. However, we failed to obtain the positive data (Fig. 6), suggesting that the YTHDF1 has no effect on the m6A levels of mRNAs in HepG2 cells. We conclude that miR-145 targeting YTHDF2 increases the m6A levels of mRNAs, which supports miR-145 as able to modulate YTHDF2.FIGURE 5Anti-miR-145 decreased the levels of mRNA m6A and rescued by si-YTHDF2.

N6-methyladenosine-dependent regulation of messenger RNA stability.Nature. 2014; 505: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we were concerned about whether miR-145 can affect the proliferation of HCC cells through modulation of YTHDF2. Interestingly, MTT assays indicated that the proliferation of HepG2 cells was decreased when the cells were treated with miR-145, whereas the treatment with anti-miR-145 increased the proliferation. Notably, we observed that YTHDF2 siRNA was able to block the anti-miR-145-enhanced proliferation (Fig. 7A), suggesting that miR-145 suppresses the proliferation of HCC cells through modulating YTHDF2. The interference efficiency of YTHDF2 siRNA was validated by Western blot analysis (Fig. 7B). Taken together, we conclude that miR-145 targeting YTHDF2 suppresses proliferation of HCC cells. Growing evidence shows that the modification of RNAs is a prevalent feature of mammalian cells and likely plays a role in development and disease (34.Saletore Y. Chen-Kiang S. Mason C.E. Novel RNA regulatory mechanisms revealed in the epitranscriptome.RNA Biol. 2013; 10: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), in which m6A modification functions mostly through regulating mRNA splicing, export, and stability (35.Pan T.

The pivotal regulatory landscape of RNA modifications.Annu. Rev. Genomics Hum. Genet. 2014; 15: 127-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). The modification of m6A needs various functional proteins and enzymes, such as the methylases mettl3/mettl14 and demethylases FTO/ALKBH5 and so on (5.Ping X.L. Sun B.F. Wang L. Xiao W. Yang X.

However, the regulatory mechanism of YTHDF2 is still unclear. In this study we investigated the post-transcriptional regulation of YTHDF2 in HepG2 cells. YTHDF2 selectively recognizes mRNA m6A in the regulation of mRNA stability; the degradation of mRNAs can result in the decrease of m6A levels (11.Wang X. Lu Z. Gomez A. Hon G.C. Yue Y. Han D. Fu Y. Parisien M. Dai Q. Jia G. Ren B. Pan T. He C. N6-methyladenosine-dependent regulation of messenger RNA stability.Nature. 2014; 505: 117-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). Moreover, it has been reported that YTHDF2 destabilizes m6A-containing RNA through direct recruitment of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex, which is recruited to m6A-containing RNAs through a direct interaction between the N-terminal region of YTHDF2 (13.Du H. Zhao Y. He J. Zhang Y. Xi H. Liu M. Ma J. Wu L. YTHDF2 destabilizes m(6)A-containing RNA through direct recruitment of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 12626Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). It has been reported that miRNA is a kind of vital bioactive molecule inducing post-transcriptional gene regulation in eukaryotic cells (39.Yang J.-S. Lai E.C. Alternative miRNA biogenesis pathways and the interpretation of core miRNA pathway mutants.Mol. Cell. 2011; 43: 892-903Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we demonstrated the regulation mechanism of YTHDF2 at the post-transcriptional level. IHC staining showed that YTHDF2 was closely associated with the malignance of HCC. It implied that YTHDF2 played a crucial role in the development of liver cancer. Moreover, bioinformatics analysis and Western blot analysis showed that miR-145 could target the 3′-UTR of YTHDF2 mRNA. Interestingly, the expression levels of miR-145 were negatively correlated with those of YTHDF2 in clinical HCC tissues, suggesting that miR-145 may be able to target the 3′-UTR of YTHDF2 mRNA. We then validated that by experiments. Furthermore, we found that miR-145 suppressed the expression of YTHDF2 at the levels of mRNA and protein in HepG2 cells. It has been reported that YTHDF2 can modulate mRNA m6A levels by recognizing m6A sites, leading to mRNA degradation, and the degradation of mRNAs can result in the decrease of m6A levels (11.Wang X. Lu Z. Gomez A. Hon G.C. Yue Y. Han D. Fu Y. Parisien M. Dai Q. Jia G. Ren B. Pan T. He C.

YTHDF2 destabilizes m(6)A-containing RNA through direct recruitment of the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 12626Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). In our study dot blot assays and immunofluorescence staining showed that miR-145 was able to increase the levels of m6A through down-regulating YTHDF2 in HCC cells, supporting that miR-145 is capable of down-regulating YTHDF2 in HepG2 cells. YTHDF1 was also demonstrated as a selective binding m6A site reader protein. YTHDF1 can regulate mRNA translation efficiency by recognizing mRNA m6A (12.Wang X. Zhao B.S. Roundtree I.A. Lu Z. Han D.

However, we failed to observe the effect of YTHDF1 on levels of m6A in HCC cells. It has been reported that miR-145 can modulate many biological functions through targeting different genes (40.Chiyomaru T. Tatarano S. Kawakami K. Enokida H. Yoshino H. Nohata N. Fuse M. Seki N.

We reconstituted the core reactions for membrane targeting and ubiquitination of nascent tail-anchored membrane proteins to understand how their fate is determined. The central six-component triage system is divided into an uncommitted client-SGTA complex, a self-sufficient targeting module, and an embedded but self-sufficient quality control module. Client-SGTA engagement of the targeting module induces rapid, private, and committed client transfer to TRC40 for successful biosynthesis. Commitment to ubiquitination is dictated primarily by comparatively slower client dissociation from SGTA and nonprivate capture by the BAG6 subunit of the quality control module. Our results provide a paradigm for how priority and time are encoded within a multichaperone triage system."

Nucleosomes are composed of histone protein octamers, the cores of which have generally been considered to be fairly rigid. Sinha et al. used nuclear magnetic resonance and protein cross-linking to show that one of the enzyme complexes that remodel nucleosomes, SNF2h, is able to distort the histone octamer (see the Perspective by Flaus and Owen-Hughes).

The iterative design had a novel focus on positive coping strategies. Interview analysis focused on patients and carers as individuals and pairs, exploring multiple dimensions of their coping experiences. Focus group analysis explored strategies for intervention development.26 people with advanced (stage 3-4) breast, prostate, lung or colorectal cancer, or in receipt of palliative care, and 24 paired nominated informal/family carers.Participants recruited through outpatient clinics at two tertiary cancer centres in Merseyside and Manchester, UK, between June 2012 and July 2013.45 patient and 41 carer interviews were conducted plus 4 focus groups (16 participants). People with advanced cancer and their informal/family carers develop coping strategies which enable effective management of psychological wellbeing. People draw from pre-diagnosis coping strategies, but these develop through responding to the experience of living with advanced cancer. Strategies include being realistic, indulgence, support, and learning from others, which enabled participants to regain a sense of wellbeing after emotional challenge. Learning from peers emerged as particularly important in promoting psychological wellbeing through the development of effective 'everyday', non-clinical coping strategies.Our findings challenge current models of providing psychological support for those with advanced cancer which focus on professional intervention. It is important to recognise, enable and support peoples' own resources and coping strategies.

Among the many crucial quality indicators for monitoring the throughput process, a patient's length of stay (LOS) is considered the most important one since it is both the cause and the result of ED crowding. The aim of this study is to identify and quantify the influence of different patient-related or diagnostic activities-related factors on the ED LOS of discharged patients.This is a retrospective electronic data analysis. All patients who were discharged from the ED of a tertiary teaching hospital in 2013 were included. A multivariate accelerated failure time model was used to analyze the influence of the collected covariates on patient LOS.A total of 106,206 patients were included for analysis with an overall medium ED LOS of 1.46 (interquartile range = 2.03) hours. Among them, 96% were discharged by a physician, 3.5% discharged against medical advice, 0.5% left without notice, and only 0.02% left without being seen by a physician. In the multivariate analysis, increased age (>80 vs <20, time ratio (TR) = 1.408, p<0.0001), higher acuity level (triage level I vs. level V, TR = 1.343, p<0.0001), transferred patients (TR = 1.350, p<0.0001), X-rays obtained (TR = 1.181, p<0.0001), CT scans obtained (TR = 1.515, p<0.0001), laboratory tests (TR = 2.654, p<0.0001), consultation provided (TR = 1.631, p<0.0001), observation provided (TR = 8.435, p<0.0001), critical condition declared (TR = 1.205, p<0.0001), day-shift arrival (TR = 1.223, p<0.0001), and an increased ED daily census (TR = 1.057, p<0.0001) lengthened the ED LOS with various effect sizes. On the other hand, male sex (TR = 0.982, p = 0.002), weekend arrival (TR = 0.928, p<0.0001), and adult non-trauma patients (compared with pediatric non-trauma, TR = 0.687, p<0.0001) were associated with shortened ED LOS. A prediction diagram was made accordingly and compared with the actual LOS.The influential factors on the ED LOS in discharged patients were identified and quantified in the current study. The model's predicted ED LOS may provide useful information for physicians or patients to better anticipate an individual's LOS and to help the administrative level plan its staffing policy."
https://openalex.org/W2575662506,"Sexual dimorphism in eye structure is attributed to sexual selection in animals that employ vision for locating mates. In many male insects, large eyes and eye regions of higher acuity are believed to facilitate the location of females. Here, we compare various features of male and female eyes in three sympatric carpenter bee species, which include two diurnal species (Xylocopa tenuiscapa and X. leucothorax) as well as a nocturnal species (X. tranquebarica). In X. tenuiscapa, males have larger eyes than females, while in the nocturnal X. tranquebarica, males have slightly smaller eyes and in X. leucothorax, the eyes are of similar size in both sexes. X. tenuiscapa males detect females by perching near nest sites (resource defence) or along fly-ways and other open areas with good visibility. Males of the other two species search for females by patrolling. We postulate that the larger eyes of male X. tenuiscapa are beneficial to their mode of mate detection since perching males may benefit from a larger visual area of high resolution detecting moving stimuli across the sky, and which may be germane to the more social and gregarious nesting behaviour of this species, compared to the other solitary bees. We tested the performance of the eyes of male X. tenuiscapa behaviourally and find that a perching male can detect a flying female at a distance of 20 m, which darkens the visual field of a single ommatidium by just 2%. This, together with the bee’s high spatial resolution permits detection of moving stimuli at least as well or even better than achieved by honey bee drones."

The neovascular or “wet” form of AMD can be treated to varying degrees with anti-angiogenic drugs, but geographic atrophy (GA) is an advanced stage of the more prevalent “dry” form of AMD for which there is no effective treatment. Development of GA has been linked to loss of the microRNA (miRNA)-processing enzyme DICER1 in the mature retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE). This loss results in the accumulation of toxic transcripts of Alu transposable elements, which activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and additional downstream pathways that compromise the integrity and function of the RPE. However, it remains unclear whether the loss of miRNA processing and subsequent gene regulation in the RPE due to DICER1 deficiency also contributes to RPE cell death. To clarify the role of miRNAs in RPE cells, we used two different mature RPE cell-specific Cre recombinase drivers to inactivate either Dicer1 or DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8 (Dgcr8), thus removing RPE miRNA regulatory activity in mice by disrupting two independent and essential steps of miRNA biogenesis. In contrast with prior studies, we found that the loss of each factor independently led to strikingly similar defects in the survival and function of the RPE and retina. These results suggest that the loss of miRNAs also contributes to RPE cell death and loss of visual function and could affect the pathology of dry AMD.

The first is accomplished in the nucleus by the microprocessor complex and involves a member of the ribonuclease III superfamily of dsRNA-specific endoribonucleases, DROSHA, and its required cofactor DGCR8 (DiGeorge syndrome critical region 8). The second cleavage step is catalyzed in the cytoplasm by another ribonuclease III-type enzyme, DICER1. Through imperfect complementarity with target sites on messenger RNAs (mRNAs), miRNAs recruit the miRNA-induced silencing complex, which represses gene expression primarily by destabilizing mRNA, but also by reducing the rate of protein translation (14Fabian M.R.

RPE cells perform a myriad of functions, including absorbing stray photons of light, maintaining the pH and nutrient content of the subretinal space, participating in the regeneration of visual chromophore, and phagocytizing the outermost portion of photoreceptor outer segments. Roughly 10% of each photoreceptor cell in the human retina is phagocytosed on a daily basis, making RPE cells probably the most active phagocytic cells in the body (25Young R.W. Bok D. Participation of the retinal pigment epithelium in the rod outer segment renewal process.J. Cell Biol. 1969; 42: 392-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Refs. 26McBee J.K.

Phagocytosis of retinal rod and cone photoreceptors.Physiology. 2010; 25: 8-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). This phagocytic process removes photooxidation products, including lipids and proteins from the photoreceptors, generated due to high levels of oxygen and light exposure and accumulated in the RPE. Thus, RPE cells are constantly subjected to toxic metabolic by-products. Finely tuned gene regulatory networks also could help to cope with this type of continuous cellular stress. Inhibition of either of the two most abundantly expressed RPE miRNAs, miR-204 and -211, in human fetal RPE cells results in increased proliferation and decreased transepithelial monolayer electrical resistance as well as altered expression of tight junction genes (28Adijanto J.

This result led to the intriguing possibility that loss of RPE miRNAs could be associated with the development or progression of GA. These mice evidenced abnormal RPE morphology and RPE cell death, a phenotype also observed upon injection of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) driving RPE-specific expression of Cre (tyrosine recombinase) in mice with conditional Dicer1 cKO alleles. Surprisingly, injection of the same AAV into mice carrying conditional alleles for Drosha, Dgcr8, or miRNA binding enzyme Argonaute 2 (Ago2) failed to elicit similar defects in RPE survival (31Kaneko H.

Normal RPE morphology was also observed in Ago1, Ago3, and Ago4 knock-out mice. This led to the conclusion that the RPE disruption associated with loss of DICER1 was miRNA-independent. RPE cell degeneration was instead attributed to failure of DICER1-mediated degradation of toxic transcripts of Alu transposable elements in humans and similar rodent short interspersed nuclear elements (SINE), B1 and B2, in mice. Indeed, exogenous introduction of Alu element-encoded RNAs has been shown to induce RPE abnormalities (32Gelfand B.D. Wright C.B. Kim Y. Yasuma T. Yasuma R. Li S. Fowler B.J. Bastos-Carvalho A.

Thus, to clarify the contribution of miRNA loss to the molecular mechanism underlying the pathology of DICER1 absence in the mature RPE, we performed a systematic characterization of RPE-specific conditional knockouts of Dicer1 and Dgcr8 in mice using two independent Cre lines. In contrast to studies involving viral delivery of Cre, we found that loss of DGCR8 or DICER1 in mature RPE cells resulted in strikingly similar defects in the morphology and function of the RPE. These results strongly suggest that miRNAs are important for the survival and function of these vulnerable post-mitotic cells and that miRNA loss could contribute to the mechanism of RPE cell death in GA.

SD-OCT revealed similar, but less dramatic, outer nuclear layer thinning in both Dicer1flox/floxCrev+ and Dgcr8flox/floxCrev+ mice as compared with control animals (Fig. 1, C, D, and G). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining of sections of fixed paraffin-embedded eyes confirmed the reduction in length of photoreceptor OSs and revealed localized pigment deposits in 8-week-old Dgcr8flox/floxCrev+ mice (Fig. 1, E and F). Moreover, a reduction in the ONL and disruption of the integrity of the RPE monolayer were observed in 8-week-old Dicer1flox/floxCrev+ mice as compared with either control littermates lacking the Cre transgene or Cre-expressing control animals with wild-type alleles of Dicer1 and Dgcr8 (Fig. 1, E and F). In addition, immunostaining for the tight junction protein zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) in flat mounts of RPE (RFM) showed a loss of monolayer organization in Dgcr8flox/floxCrev+ mice relative to control Dgcr8flox/flox or Crev+ animals (Fig. 2A).FIGURE 2RPE integrity and visual function are impaired in both inducible Dgcr8flox/floxCrev+ and Dicer1flox/floxCrev+ mice.

The aim of this study was to investigate the alterations of cardiac autonomic function of diabetic patients in relation to three types of diabetes-related complications. ECG recordings were collected and analyzed from 169 T2DM patients in supine position who were diagnosed with nephropathy (n = 55), peripheral neuropathy (n = 64) and retinopathy (n = 106) at two hospitals in the UAE. Comparison between combinations of patients with complications and a control diabetic group (CONT) with no complication (n = 34) was performed using time, frequency and multi-lag entropy measures of heart rate variability (HRV). The results show that these measures decreased significantly (p<0.05) depending on the presence and type of diabetic complications. Entropy, (median, 1st- 3rd interquartile range) for the group combining all complications (1.74,1.37-2.09) was significantly lower than the corresponding values for the CONT group (1.77, 1.39-2.24) with lag-1 for sequential beat-to-beat changes. Odds ratios (OR) from the entropy analysis further demonstrated a significantly higher association with the combination of retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy versus CONT (OR: 1.42 at lag 8) and an even OR for the combination of retinopathy and nephropathy (OR: 2.46 at lag 8) compared to the other groups with complications. Also, the OR of low frequency power to high frequency power ratio (LF/HF) showed a higher association with these diabetic-related complications compared to CONT, especially for the patient group combining all complications (OR: 4.92). This study confirms that the type of microvascular or peripheral neuropathy complication present in T2DM patients have different effects on heart rate entropy, implying disorders of multi-organ connectivity are directly associated with autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Clinical practice may benefit from including multi-lag entropy for cardiac rhythm analysis in conjunction with traditional screening methods in patients with diabetic complications to ensure better preventive and treatment outcomes in the Emirati Arab population."

https://openalex.org/W2573962702,"Background Breast cancer can be prevented with selective estrogen receptor modifiers (SERMs) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs). The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends that women with a 5-year breast cancer risk ≥3% consider chemoprevention for breast cancer. More than 70 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been associated with breast cancer. We sought to determine how to best integrate risk information from SNPs with other risk factors to risk stratify women for chemoprevention. Methods We used the risk distribution among women ages 35–69 estimated by the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC) risk model. We modeled the effect of adding 70 SNPs to the BCSC model and examined how this would affect how many women are reclassified above and below the threshold for chemoprevention. Results We found that most of the benefit of SNP testing a population is achieved by testing a modest fraction of the population. For example, if women with a 5-year BCSC risk of >2.0% are tested (~21% of all women), ~75% of the benefit of testing all women (shifting women above or below 3% 5-year risk) would be derived. If women with a 5-year risk of >1.5% are tested (~36% of all women), ~90% of the benefit of testing all women would be derived. Conclusion SNP testing is effective for reclassification of women for chemoprevention, but is unlikely to reclassify women with <1.5% 5-year risk. These results can be used to implement an efficient two-step testing approach to identify high risk women who may benefit from chemoprevention."

Methods Thirty-seven drug naïve patients with schizophrenia and 25 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. A seed-based approach was used to analyze the resting-state functional imaging data. Insular cortical connectivity maps were bilaterally extracted for group comparison and validated by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis. Clinical symptoms were measured using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Results There were significant reductions in the right insular cortical connectivity with the Heschl’s gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and caudate (p’s<0.001) in the patient group compared with the healthy control (HC) group. Reduced right insular cortical connectivity with the Heschl’s gyrus was further confirmed in the VBM analysis (FDR corrected p<0.05). Within the patient group, there was a significant positive relationship between the right insula-Heschl’s connectivity and PANSS general psychopathology scores (r = 0.384, p = 0.019).

The maternal mortality ratio of 103 (per 100,000 livebirths) was observed during this study, neonatal mortality ratio was 25 per 1,000 livebirths, and perinatal mortality ratio was 50 per 1,000 livebirths. Despite a high number of institutional deliveries, rates of stillbirth were 2.86%. Early enrollment and close follow-up and monitoring procedures established by the Maternal and Newborn Health registry allowed for negligible lost to follow-up. This population-level study provides regional rates of maternal and newborn health in Belgaum and Bagalkot in Karnataka over 2013–14. The mortality ratios and morbidity information can be used in planning interventions and monitoring indicators of effectiveness to inform policy and practice. Comprehensive regional epidemiologic data, such as that provided here, is essential to gauge improvements and challenges in maternal health, as well as track disparities found in rural areas."

https://openalex.org/W2574567954,"Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by airways hyper-responsiveness (AHR), reversible airway obstruction, and airway inflammation and remodeling. We previously showed that Syk modulates methacholine-induced airways contractility in naïve mice and in mice with allergic airways inflammation. We hypothesize that Syk plays a role in the pathogenesis of AHR; this was evaluated in a chronic 8-week mouse model of house dust mite (HDM)-induced allergic airways inflammation.We used the Sykflox/flox//rosa26CreERT2 conditional Syk knock-out mice to assess the role of Syk prior to HDM exposure, and treated HDM-sensitized mice with the Syk inhibitor, GSK143, to evaluate its role in established allergic airways inflammation. Respiratory mechanics and methacholine (MCh)-responsiveness were assessed using the flexiVent® system. Lungs underwent bronchoalveolar lavage to isolate inflammatory cells or were frozen for determination of gene expression in tissues.MCh-induced AHR was observed following HDM sensitization in the Syk-intact (Sykflox/flox) and vehicle-treated BALB/c mice. MCh responsiveness was reduced to control levels in HDM-sensitized Sykdel/del mice and in BALB/c and Sykflox/flox mice treated with GSK143. Both Sykdel/del and GSK143-treated mice mounted appropriate immune responses to HDM, with HDM-specific IgE levels that were comparable to Sykflox/flox and vehicle-treated BALB/c mice. HDM-induced increases in bronchoalveolar lavage cell counts were attenuated in both Sykdel/del and GSK143-treated mice, due primarily to decreased neutrophil recruitment. Gene expression analysis of lung tissues revealed that HDM-induced expression of IL-17 and CXCL-1 was significantly attenuated in both Sykdel/del and GSK143-treated mice.Syk inhibitors may play a role in the management of neutrophilic asthma."

https://openalex.org/W2574634442,"Diet-induced obesity (DIO) resulting from consumption of a high fat diet (HFD) attenuates normal neuronal responses to leptin and may contribute to the metabolic defense of an acquired higher body weight in humans; the molecular bases for the persistence of this defense are unknown. We measured the responses of 23 brain regions to exogenous leptin in 4 different groups of weight- and/or diet-perturbed mice. Responses to leptin were assessed by quantifying pSTAT3 levels in brain nuclei 30 minutes following 3 mg/kg intraperitoneal leptin. HFD attenuated leptin sensing throughout the brain, but weight loss did not restore central leptin signaling to control levels in several brain regions important in energy homeostasis, including the arcuate and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei. Effects of diet on leptin signaling varied by brain region, with results dependent on the method of weight loss (restriction of calories of HFD, ad lib intake of standard mouse chow). High fat diet attenuates leptin signaling throughout the brain, but some brain regions maintain their ability to sense leptin. Weight loss restores leptin sensing to some degree in most (but not all) brain regions, while other brain regions display hypersensitivity to leptin following weight loss. Normal leptin sensing was restored in several brain regions, with the pattern of restoration dependent on the method of weight loss."

https://openalex.org/W2576534192,"Angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4) is suggested to be a master regulator of plasma triglyceride metabolism. Our aim was to study whether the previously reported high levels of ANGPTL4 detected in serum from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) by ELISA was due to any specific molecular form of this protein (oligomers, monomers or fragments). ANGPTL4 levels were first determined in serum from 68 RA patients and 43 age and sex matched control subjects and the mean values differed by a factor of 5.0. Then, ANGPTL4 was analyzed after size exclusion chromatography (SEC) of serum samples. With serum from one of the RA patients with high levels of ANGPTL4, the dominant reactivity was found in fractions corresponding to high-molecular weight proteins. In addition, a minor peak of reactivity eluting late from the column was found both in the patient and in controls. By the use of HeteroBlock®, and by careful selection of antibodies, we documented non-specific reactions for ANGPTL4 in 39% of samples from the RA patients, most likely due to cross-reactivity of the antibodies with rheumatoid factor (RF). The corresponding figure for control subjects was 6.3%. After corrections for non-specific reactions, the mean level of ANGPTL4 in serum from RA patients was still significantly higher than in control individuals (mean levels were 101±62 and 67±39 ng/ml respectively, P = 0.02). We re-analyzed samples from our previously published studies on ANGPL4 levels in patients on hemodialysis and patients with diabetes type 2. These samples did not show false positive reactions. The levels of ANGPTL4 were comparable to those detected previously."

A new organization was formed last year, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), to speed development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases—but it had no serious financial backing. Now, CEPI has attracted nearly a half-billion dollars in funding, as it planned to announce at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust each donated $100 million, and the governments of Norway, Japan, and Germany make up the balance. CEPI also decided to focus initially on three diseases—Lassa, Nipah, and Middle East respiratory syndrome–coronavirus—and it will soon seek proposals from academia and industry to make these vaccines and conduct early phase trials so that they9re at the ready for a real-word efficacy test when these pathogens emerge."

Targeted drug therapy may help improve radiation treatment of deadly brain cancer.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a deadly brain cancer, and a major challenge to its treatment with radiation is that the approach often leads to an even more aggressive form of the cancer. Kegelman et al. report that targeting a scaffolding protein called MDA-9 or syntenin (encoded by melanoma differentiation-associated gene 9) with a small-molecule inhibitor may prevent this outcome. The drug targets a protein interaction domain (PDZ1) in MDA-9, blocking key signaling pathways that promote invasiveness and proliferation in cultured glioblastoma cells. The drug also boosted tumor sensitivity to radiation and improved survival in a mouse model of GBM. The results suggest a possible path to targeted brain cancer therapy.
