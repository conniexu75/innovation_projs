https://openalex.org/W3033950875,"COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is a virulent pneumonia, with >4,000,000 confirmed cases worldwide and >290,000 deaths as of May 15, 2020. It is critical that vaccines and therapeutics be developed very rapidly. Mice, the ideal animal for assessing such interventions, are resistant to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we overcome this difficulty by exogenous delivery of human ACE2 with a replication-deficient adenovirus (Ad5-hACE2). Ad5-hACE2-sensitized mice developed pneumonia characterized by weight loss, severe pulmonary pathology, and high-titer virus replication in lungs. Type I interferon, T cells, and, most importantly, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) are critical for virus clearance and disease resolution in these mice. Ad5-hACE2-transduced mice enabled rapid assessments of a vaccine candidate, of human convalescent plasma, and of two antiviral therapies (poly I:C and remdesivir). In summary, we describe a murine model of broad and immediate utility to investigate COVID-19 pathogenesis and to evaluate new therapies and vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W3041877641,"Bacterial toxins represent a vast reservoir of biochemical diversity that can be repurposed for biomedical applications. Such proteins include a group of predicted interbacterial toxins of the deaminase superfamily, members of which have found application in gene-editing techniques1,2. Because previously described cytidine deaminases operate on single-stranded nucleic acids3, their use in base editing requires the unwinding of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)—for example by a CRISPR–Cas9 system. Base editing within mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), however, has thus far been hindered by challenges associated with the delivery of guide RNA into the mitochondria4. As a consequence, manipulation of mtDNA to date has been limited to the targeted destruction of the mitochondrial genome by designer nucleases9,10.Here we describe an interbacterial toxin, which we name DddA, that catalyses the deamination of cytidines within dsDNA. We engineered split-DddA halves that are non-toxic and inactive until brought together on target DNA by adjacently bound programmable DNA-binding proteins. Fusions of the split-DddA halves, transcription activator-like effector array proteins, and a uracil glycosylase inhibitor resulted in RNA-free DddA-derived cytosine base editors (DdCBEs) that catalyse C•G-to-T•A conversions in human mtDNA with high target specificity and product purity. We used DdCBEs to model a disease-associated mtDNA mutation in human cells, resulting in changes in respiration rates and oxidative phosphorylation. CRISPR-free DdCBEs enable the precise manipulation of mtDNA, rather than the elimination of mtDNA copies that results from its cleavage by targeted nucleases, with broad implications for the study and potential treatment of mitochondrial disorders. An interbacterial toxin that catalyses the deamination of cytidines within double-stranded DNA forms part of a CRISPR-free, RNA-free base editing system that enables manipulation of human mitochondrial DNA."
https://openalex.org/W3041773269,"Enhanced silicate rock weathering (ERW), deployable with croplands, has potential use for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (CDR), which is now necessary to mitigate anthropogenic climate change1. ERW also has possible co-benefits for improved food and soil security, and reduced ocean acidification2–4. Here we use an integrated performance modelling approach to make an initial techno-economic assessment for 2050, quantifying how CDR potential and costs vary among nations in relation to business-as-usual energy policies and policies consistent with limiting future warming to 2 degrees Celsius5. China, India, the USA and Brazil have great potential to help achieve average global CDR goals of 0.5 to 2 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year with extraction costs of approximately US$80–180 per tonne of CO2. These goals and costs are robust, regardless of future energy policies. Deployment within existing croplands offers opportunities to align agriculture and climate policy. However, success will depend upon overcoming political and social inertia to develop regulatory and incentive frameworks. We discuss the challenges and opportunities of ERW deployment, including the potential for excess industrial silicate materials (basalt mine overburden, concrete, and iron and steel slag) to obviate the need for new mining, as well as uncertainties in soil weathering rates and land–ocean transfer of weathered products. A detailed assessment of the techno-economic potential of enhanced rock weathering on croplands identifies national CO2 removal potentials, costs and engineering challenges if it were to be scaled up to help meet ambitious global CO2 removal targets."
https://openalex.org/W3041530105,"Species often include multiple ecotypes that are adapted to different environments1. However, it is unclear how ecotypes arise and how their distinctive combinations of adaptive alleles are maintained despite hybridization with non-adapted populations2–4. Here, by resequencing 1,506 wild sunflowers from 3 species (Helianthus annuus, Helianthus petiolaris and Helianthus argophyllus), we identify 37 large (1–100 Mbp in size), non-recombining haplotype blocks that are associated with numerous ecologically relevant traits, as well as soil and climate characteristics. Limited recombination in these haplotype blocks keeps adaptive alleles together, and these regions differentiate sunflower ecotypes. For example, haplotype blocks control a 77-day difference in flowering between ecotypes of the silverleaf sunflower H. argophyllus (probably through deletion of a homologue of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT)), and are associated with seed size, flowering time and soil fertility in dune-adapted sunflowers. These haplotypes are highly divergent, frequently associated with structural variants and often appear to represent introgressions from other—possibly now-extinct—congeners. These results highlight a pervasive role of structural variation in ecotypic adaptation. Resequencing analyses of three species of wild sunflower identify large non-recombining haplotype blocks that correlate with ecologically relevant traits, soil and climate characteristics, and that differentiate species ecotypes."
https://openalex.org/W3040803262,"Connections between the gut and brain monitor the intestinal tissue and its microbial and dietary content1, regulating both physiological intestinal functions such as nutrient absorption and motility2,3, and brain-wired feeding behaviour2. It is therefore plausible that circuits exist to detect gut microorganisms and relay this information to areas of the central nervous system that, in turn, regulate gut physiology4. Here we characterize the influence of the microbiota on enteric-associated neurons by combining gnotobiotic mouse models with transcriptomics, circuit-tracing methods and functional manipulations. We find that the gut microbiome modulates gut-extrinsic sympathetic neurons: microbiota depletion leads to increased expression of the neuronal transcription factor cFos, and colonization of germ-free mice with bacteria that produce short-chain fatty acids suppresses cFos expression in the gut sympathetic ganglia. Chemogenetic manipulations, translational profiling and anterograde tracing identify a subset of distal intestine-projecting vagal neurons that are positioned to have an afferent role in microbiota-mediated modulation of gut sympathetic neurons. Retrograde polysynaptic neuronal tracing from the intestinal wall identifies brainstem sensory nuclei that are activated during microbial depletion, as well as efferent sympathetic premotor glutamatergic neurons that regulate gastrointestinal transit. These results reveal microbiota-dependent control of gut-extrinsic sympathetic activation through a gut-brain circuit."
https://openalex.org/W3041632850,"On 3 April 2020, the Director-General of the WHO stated: “[COVID-19] is much more than a health crisis. We are all aware of the profound social and economic consequences of the pandemic (WHO, 2020)”. Such consequences are the result of counter-measures such as lockdowns, and world-wide reductions in production and consumption, amplified by cascading impacts through international supply chains. Using a global multi-regional macro-economic model, we capture direct and indirect spill-over effects in terms of social and economic losses, as well as environmental effects of the pandemic. Based on information as of May 2020, we show that global consumption losses amount to 3.8$tr, triggering significant job (147 million full-time equivalent) and income (2.1$tr) losses. Global atmospheric emissions are reduced by 2.5Gt of greenhouse gases, 0.6Mt of PM2.5, and 5.1Mt of SO2 and NOx. While Asia, Europe and the USA have been the most directly impacted regions, and transport and tourism the immediately hit sectors, the indirect effects transmitted along international supply chains are being felt across the entire world economy. These ripple effects highlight the intrinsic link between socio-economic and environmental dimensions, and emphasise the challenge of addressing unsustainable global patterns. How humanity reacts to this crisis will define the post-pandemic world."
https://openalex.org/W3041473917,"The mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) is necessary for tumour growth1-6 and its inhibition has demonstrated anti-tumour efficacy in combination with targeted therapies7-9. Furthermore, human brain and lung tumours display robust glucose oxidation by mitochondria10,11. However, it is unclear why a functional ETC is necessary for tumour growth in vivo. ETC function is coupled to the generation of ATP-that is, oxidative phosphorylation and the production of metabolites by the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Mitochondrial complexes I and II donate electrons to ubiquinone, resulting in the generation of ubiquinol and the regeneration of the NAD+ and FAD cofactors, and complex III oxidizes ubiquinol back to ubiquinone, which also serves as an electron acceptor for dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH)-an enzyme necessary for de novo pyrimidine synthesis. Here we show impaired tumour growth in cancer cells that lack mitochondrial complex III. This phenotype was rescued by ectopic expression of Ciona intestinalis alternative oxidase (AOX)12, which also oxidizes ubiquinol to ubiquinone. Loss of mitochondrial complex I, II or DHODH diminished the tumour growth of AOX-expressing cancer cells deficient in mitochondrial complex III, which highlights the necessity of ubiquinone as an electron acceptor for tumour growth. Cancer cells that lack mitochondrial complex III but can regenerate NAD+ by expression of the NADH oxidase from Lactobacillus brevis (LbNOX)13 targeted to the mitochondria or cytosol were still unable to grow tumours. This suggests that regeneration of NAD+ is not sufficient to drive tumour growth in vivo. Collectively, our findings indicate that tumour growth requires the ETC to oxidize ubiquinol, which is essential to drive the oxidative TCA cycle and DHODH activity."
https://openalex.org/W3041337213,"Astrocytes take up glucose from the bloodstream to provide energy to the brain, thereby allowing neuronal activity and behavioural responses1-5. By contrast, astrocytes are under neuronal control through specific neurotransmitter receptors5-7. However, whether the activation of astroglial receptors can directly regulate cellular glucose metabolism to eventually modulate behavioural responses is unclear. Here we show that activation of mouse astroglial type-1 cannabinoid receptors associated with mitochondrial membranes (mtCB1) hampers the metabolism of glucose and the production of lactate in the brain, resulting in altered neuronal functions and, in turn, impaired behavioural responses in social interaction assays. Specifically, activation of astroglial mtCB1 receptors reduces the phosphorylation of the mitochondrial complex I subunit NDUFS4, which decreases the stability and activity of complex I. This leads to a reduction in the generation of reactive oxygen species by astrocytes and affects the glycolytic production of lactate through the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 pathway, eventually resulting in neuronal redox stress and impairment of behavioural responses in social interaction assays. Genetic and pharmacological correction of each of these effects abolishes the effect of cannabinoid treatment on the observed behaviour. These findings suggest that mtCB1 receptor signalling can directly regulate astroglial glucose metabolism to fine-tune neuronal activity and behaviour in mice."
https://openalex.org/W3041083155,"The transient receptor potential ion channel TRPA1 is expressed by primary afferent nerve fibres, in which it functions as a low-threshold sensor for structurally diverse electrophilic irritants, including small volatile environmental toxicants and endogenous algogenic lipids1. TRPA1 is also a ‘receptor-operated’ channel whose activation downstream of metabotropic receptors elicits inflammatory pain or itch, making it an attractive target for novel analgesic therapies2. However, the mechanisms by which TRPA1 recognizes and responds to electrophiles or cytoplasmic second messengers remain unknown. Here we use strutural studies and electrophysiology to show that electrophiles act through a two-step process in which modification of a highly reactive cysteine residue (C621) promotes reorientation of a cytoplasmic loop to enhance nucleophilicity and modification of a nearby cysteine (C665), thereby stabilizing the loop in an activating configuration. These actions modulate two restrictions controlling ion permeation, including widening of the selectivity filter to enhance calcium permeability and opening of a canonical gate at the cytoplasmic end of the pore. We propose a model to explain functional coupling between electrophile action and these control points. We also characterize a calcium-binding pocket that is highly conserved across TRP channel subtypes and accounts for all aspects of calcium-dependent TRPA1 regulation, including potentiation, desensitization and activation by metabotropic receptors. These findings provide a structural framework for understanding how a broad-spectrum irritant receptor is controlled by endogenous and exogenous agents that elicit or exacerbate pain and itch. Electrophiles activate the transient receptor potential ion channel TRPA1 by a two-step cysteine modification mechanism, which stabilizes a cytoplasmic loop that controls gating and calcium permeability."
https://openalex.org/W3042137962,"Zika virus (ZIKV) belongs to the family Flaviviridae, and is related to other viruses that cause human diseases. Unlike other flaviviruses, ZIKV infection can cause congenital neurological disorders and replicates efficiently in reproductive tissues1-3. Here we show that the envelope protein (E) of ZIKV is polyubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM7 through Lys63 (K63)-linked polyubiquitination. Accordingly, ZIKV replicates less efficiently in the brain and reproductive tissues of Trim7-/- mice. Ubiquitinated E is present on infectious virions of ZIKV when they are released from specific cell types, and enhances virus attachment and entry into cells. Specifically, K63-linked polyubiquitin chains directly interact with the TIM1 (also known as HAVCR1) receptor of host cells, which enhances virus entry in cells as well as in brain tissue in vivo. Recombinant ZIKV mutants that lack ubiquitination are attenuated in human cells and in wild-type mice, but not in live mosquitoes. Monoclonal antibodies against K63-linked polyubiquitin specifically neutralize ZIKV and reduce viraemia in mice. Our results demonstrate that the ubiquitination of ZIKV E is an important determinant of virus entry, tropism and pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3041750767,"Sexual dimorphism arises from genetic differences between male and female cells, and from systemic hormonal differences1–3. How sex hormones affect non-reproductive organs is poorly understood, yet highly relevant to health given the sex-biased incidence of many diseases4. Here we report that steroid signalling in Drosophila from the ovaries to the gut promotes growth of the intestine specifically in mated females, and enhances their reproductive output. The active ovaries of the fly produce the steroid hormone ecdysone, which stimulates the division and expansion of intestinal stem cells in two distinct proliferative phases via the steroid receptors EcR and Usp and their downstream targets Broad, Eip75B and Hr3. Although ecdysone-dependent growth of the female gut augments fecundity, the more active and more numerous intestinal stem cells also increase female susceptibility to age-dependent gut dysplasia and tumorigenesis, thus potentially reducing lifespan. This work highlights the trade-offs in fitness traits that occur when inter-organ signalling alters stem-cell behaviour to optimize organ size. High levels of the sexually dimorphic hormone ecdysone, produced by active ovaries in Drosophila, promote the proliferation of stem cells in the female gut and maximize reproductive fitness, but also increase female susceptibility to age-dependent dysplasia and tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W3041554098,"Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) is highly prevalent and is associated with numerous gastrointestinal disorders, but the microbes involved remain poorly defined. Moreover, existing studies of microbiome alterations in SIBO have utilized stool samples, which are not representative of the entire gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, we aimed to determine and compare the duodenal microbiome composition in SIBO and non-SIBO subjects, using duodenal aspirates from subjects undergoing standard-of-care esophagogastroduodenoscopy without colon preparation. Using the recently-redefined cutoff for SIBO of >103 colony forming units per milliliter (CFU/mL), 42 SIBO and 98 non-SIBO subjects were identified. Duodenal samples from SIBO subjects had 4x103-fold higher counts than non-SIBO subjects when plated on MacConkey agar (P<0.0001), and 3.8-fold higher counts when plated on blood agar (P<0.0001). Twenty subjects had also undergone lactulose hydrogen breath tests (LHBTs), of whom 7/20 had SIBO. At the 90-minute timepoint, 4/7 SIBO subjects had positive LHBTs (rise in hydrogen (H2) ≥ 20 ppm above baseline), as compared to 2/13 non-SIBO subjects. 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequencing revealed that SIBO subjects had 4.31-fold higher relative abundance of Proteobacteria (FDR P<0.0001) and 1.64-fold lower Firmicutes (P<0.0003) than non-SIBO subjects. This increased relative abundance of Proteobacteria correlated with decreased α-diversity in SIBO subjects (Spearman R = 0.4866, P<0.0001) Specific increases in class Gammaproteobacteria correlated with the area-under-the-curve for H2 for 0–90 mins during LHBT (R = 0.630, P = 0.002). Increases in Gammaproteobacteria resulted primarily from higher relative abundances of the family Enterobacteriaceae (FDR P<0.0001), which correlated with the symptom of bloating (Spearman R = 0.185, 2-tailed P = 0.028). Increases in family Aeromonadaceae correlated with urgency with bowel movement (Spearman R = 0.186, 2-tailed P = 0.028). These results validate the >103 CFU/mL cutoff for the definition of SIBO, and also reveal specific overgrowth of Proteobacteria in SIBO vs. non-SIBO subjects, coupled with an altered Proteobacterial profile that correlates with symptom severity. Future research may elucidate host-microbiome interactions underlying these symptoms in SIBO patients."
https://openalex.org/W3040691675,"Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) contribute to the cancer hallmarks of uncontrolled proliferation and increased survival. As a result, over the last two decades substantial efforts have been directed towards identification and development of pharmaceutical CDK inhibitors. Insights into the biological consequences of CDK inhibition in specific tumor types have led to the successful development of CDK4/6 inhibitors as treatments for certain types of breast cancer. More recently, a new generation of pharmaceutical inhibitors of CDK enzymes that regulate the transcription of key oncogenic and pro-survival proteins, including CDK9, have entered clinical development. Here, we provide the first disclosure of the chemical structure of fadraciclib (CYC065), a CDK inhibitor and clinical candidate designed by further optimization from the aminopurine scaffold of seliciclib. We describe its synthesis and mechanistic characterization. Fadraciclib exhibits improved potency and selectivity for CDK2 and CDK9 compared to seliciclib, and also displays high selectivity across the kinome. We show that the mechanism of action of fadraciclib is consistent with potent inhibition of CDK9-mediated transcription, decreasing levels of RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain serine 2 phosphorylation, the pro-survival protein Myeloid Cell Leukemia 1 (MCL1) and MYC oncoprotein, and inducing rapid apoptosis in cancer cells. This cellular potency and mechanism of action translate to promising anti-cancer activity in human leukemia mouse xenograft models. Studies of leukemia cell line sensitivity identify mixed lineage leukemia ( MLL ) gene status and the level of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) family proteins as potential markers for selection of patients with greater sensitivity to fadraciclib. We show that the combination of fadraciclib with BCL2 inhibitors, including venetoclax, is synergistic in leukemic cell models, as predicted from simultaneous inhibition of MCL1 and BCL2 pro-survival pathways. Fadraciclib preclinical pharmacology data support its therapeutic potential in CDK9- or CDK2-dependent cancers and as a rational combination with BCL2 inhibitors in hematological malignancies. Fadraciclib is currently in Phase 1 clinical studies in patients with advanced solid tumors ( NCT02552953 ) and also in combination with venetoclax in patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) ( NCT03739554 ) and relapsed refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) ( NCT04017546 )."

https://openalex.org/W3041573492,"Limited information is available that seed biopriming with plant growth-promoting Enterobacter spp. play a prominent role to enhance vegetative growth of plants. Contrary to Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter hormaechei is a less-studied counterpart despite its vast potential in plant growth-promotion mainly through the inorganic phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) solubilization abilities. To this end, 18 locally isolated bacterial pure cultures were screened and three strains showed high P- and K-solubilizing capabilities. Light microscopy, biochemical tests and 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that strains 15a1 and 40a were closely related to Enterobacter hormaechei while strain 38 was closely related to Enterobacter cloacae (Accession number: MN294583; MN294585; MN294584). All Enterobacter spp. shared common plant growth-promoting traits, namely nitrogen (N2) fixation, indole-3-acetic acid production and siderophore production. The strains 38 and 40a were able to produce gibberellic acid, while only strain 38 was able to secrete exopolysaccharide on agar. Under in vitro germination assay of okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) seeds, Enterobacter spp. significantly improved overall germination parameters and vigor index (19.6%) of seedlings. The efficacy of root colonization of Enterobacter spp. on the pre-treated seedling root tips was confirmed using Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The pot experiment of bioprimed seeds of okra seedling showed significant improvement of the plant growth (> 28%) which corresponded to the increase of P and K uptakes (> 89%) as compared to the uninoculated control plants. The leaf surface area and the SPAD chlorophyll index of bioprimed plants were increased by up to 29% and 9% respectively. This report revealed that the under-explored species of P- and K-solubilizing Enterobacter hormaechei sp. with multiple plant beneficial traits presents a great potential sustainable approach for enhancement of soil fertility and P and K uptakes of plants."
https://openalex.org/W3041849385,"Arginine methylation catalyzed by protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMT) is a common post-translational modification in histone and nonhistone proteins, which regulates many cellular functions. Protein arginine methyltransferase 3 (prmt3), a type I arginine methyltransferase, has been shown to carry out the formation of stable monomethylarginine as an intermediate before the establishment of asymmetric dimethylarginine. To date, however, the role of PRMT3 in antiviral innate immunity has not been elucidated. This study showed that zebrafish prmt3 was upregulated by virus infection and that the overexpression of prmt3 suppressed cellular antiviral response. The PRMT3 inhibitor, SGC707, enhanced antiviral capability. Consistently, prmt3-null zebrafish were more resistant to Spring Viremia of Carp Virus (SVCV) and Grass Carp Reovirus (GCRV) infection. Further assays showed that the overexpression of prmt3 diminished the phosphorylation of irf3 and prmt3 interacted with rig-i. In addition, both zinc-finger domain and catalytic domain of prmt3 were required for the suppressive function of prmt3 on IFN activation. Our findings suggested that zebrafish prmt3 negatively regulated the antiviral responses, implicating the vital role of prmt3–or even arginine methylation–in antiviral innate immunity."
https://openalex.org/W3042097993,"More advanced knowledge is needed on how COPD alters the clinical presentation of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and how the association of both diseases, known as 'overlap syndrome' (OVS), impacts on cardiovascular health.To investigate differences between patients with OVS and those with moderate-to-severe OSA alone.A cross-sectional study conducted in the French National Sleep Apnea Registry between January 1997 and January 2017. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to compare OVS versus OSA alone on symptoms and cardiovascular health.46,786 patients had moderate-to-severe OSA. Valid spirometry was available for 16,466 patients: 14,368 (87%) had moderate-to-severe OSA alone and 2098 (13%) had OVS. A lower proportion of OVS patients complained of snoring, morning headaches and excessive daytime sleepiness compared to OSA alone (median Epworth Sleepiness Scale score: 9 [interquartile range (IQR) 6-13] versus 10 (IQR 6-13), respectively; P <0.02). Similarly, a lower proportion of OVS patients (35.6% versus 39.4%, respectively; P <0.01) experienced sleepiness while driving. In contrast, 63.5% of the OVS population experienced nocturia compared to 58.0% of the OSA population (P<0.01). Apnea hypopnea index (36 [25; 52] vs 33.1 [23.3; 50]), oxygen desaturation index (28 [15; 48] vs 25.2 [14; 45]) and mean nocturnal SaO2 (92 [90; 93.8] vs 93 [91.3; 94]) were significantly more altered in the OVS group. Associated COPD had no effect on the prevalence of hypertension and stroke. After controlling for main confounders, COPD severity was associated in a dose-response relationship with a higher prevalence of coronary heart disease, heart failure and peripheral arteriopathy.In adults with moderate-to-severe OSA, OVS was minimally symptomatic, but exhibited higher odds for prevalent coronary heart disease, heart failure and peripheral arteriopathy."
https://openalex.org/W3041120790,"Our healthcare system is moving towards patient-centered and value-based care models that prioritize health outcomes that matter to patients. However, little is known about what aspects of care patients would prioritize when presented with choices of desirable attributes and whether these patient priorities differ based on certain demographics.To assess patients' priorities for a range of attributes in ambulatory care consultations across five key health service delivery domains and determine potential associations between patient priorities and certain demographic profiles.Using a What Matters to You survey patients ranked in order of importance various choices related to five health service domains (patient-physician relationship, personal responsibility, test/procedures, medications, and cost). Subjects were selected from two Johns Hopkins affiliated primary care clinics and a third gastroenterology subspecialty clinic over a period of 11 months. We calculated the percentage of respondents who selected each quality as their top 1-3 choice. Univariate and multivariate analyses determined demographic characteristics associated with patient priorities.Humanistic qualities of physicians, leading a healthy lifestyle, shared decision making (SDM) for medications and tests/procedures as well as knowledge about insurance coverage were the most frequently ranked choices. Privately insured and more educated patients were less likely to rank humanistic qualities highly. Those with younger age, higher educational attainment and private insurance had higher odds of ranking healthy lifestyle as a top choice. Those with more education had higher odds of ranking SDM as a top choice.Identifying what matters most to patients is useful as we move towards patient-centered and Value Based Care Models. Our findings suggest that patients have priorities on qualities they value across key health service domains. Multiple factors including patient demographics can be predictors of these priorities. Elucidating these preferences is a challenging but a valuable step in the right direction."
https://openalex.org/W3041688447,"Introduction Improving maternal health is a global public health challenge especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The optimum utilisation of antenatal care (ANC) by pregnant women is known to improve maternal health outcomes. Maternal morbidity and mortality rates in Ghana remain unacceptably high, particularly in rural settings where skilled delivery care often times is disproportionally low. This study assessed factors associated with optimum utilisation of antenatal care in rural Ghana. Methods A cross-sectional design was applied to collect data among eligible participants between October 2018 and January 2019. A total of 322 women who gave birth and attended the postnatal clinic were recruited for the study. Consecutive sampling was employed in recruiting participants. The associations between the dependent variables (ANC service utilisation and knowledge of ANC) and independent variables (socio-demographic characteristics) were examined using ordinary least squares logistic regression at 95% confidence interval in STATA version 14.0. Results Of the 322 participants, 69.0% reported utilising at least four or more times ANC services. Determinants of women attending ANC for four or more times was significantly associated with age [OR = 4.36 (95%CI: 2.16–8.80), p<0.001], educational level [OR = 10.18 (95%CI: 3.86–26.87), p<0.001], and insured with National Health Insurance Scheme [OR = 3.42 (95%CI: 1.72–6.82), p<0.001]. Not married [OR = 0.65 (0.39–1.09), p = 0.011] or divorced [OR = 0.33 (95%CI: 0.13–0.83), p = 0.019] was negatively associated with utilisation of four or more ANC services. The majority (79.0%) of the participants had a good level of knowledge regarding antenatal care. Conclusion Although the majority of women in this study had good knowledge of ANC services, a significant number of them did not complete the recommended number of ANC visits for at least four times during a normal pregnancy. Awareness and further education to reproductive-age women on the significant role adequate ANC attendance plays in advancing health and well-being require further investments, particularly among rural women in Ghana."
https://openalex.org/W3041580485,"Due to a lack of reliable reference intervals (RIs) for Kenya, we set out to determine RIs for 40 common chemistry and immunoassay tests as part of the IFCC global RI project.Apparently healthy adults aged 18-65 years were recruited according to a harmonized protocol and samples analyzed using Beckman-Coulter analyzers. Value assigned serum panels were measured to standardize chemistry results. The need for partitioning reference values by sex and age was based on between-subgroup differences expressed as standard deviation ratio (SDR) or bias in lower or upper limits (LLs and ULs) of the RI. RIs were derived using a parametric method with/without latent abnormal value exclusion (LAVE).Sex-specific RIs were required for uric acid, creatinine, total bilirubin (TBil), total cholesterol (TC), ALT, AST, CK, GGT, transferrin, transferrin saturation (TfSat) and immunoglobulin-M. Age-specific RIs were required for glucose and triglyceride for both sexes, and for urea, magnesium, TC, HDL-cholesterol ratio, ALP, and ferritin for females. LAVE was effective in optimizing RIs for AST, ALT, GGT iron-markers and CRP by reducing influence of latent anemia and metabolic diseases. Thyroid profile RIs were derived after excluding volunteers with anti-thyroid antibodies. Kenyan RIs were comparable to those of other countries participating in the global study with a few exceptions such as higher ULs for TBil and CRP.Kenyan RIs for major analytes were established using harmonized protocol from well-defined reference individuals. Standardized RIs for chemistry analytes can be shared across sub-Saharan African laboratories with similar ethnic and life-style profile."
https://openalex.org/W3041078932,"Senile plaques frequently contain Aβ-pE(3), a N-terminally truncated Aβ species that is more closely linked to AD compared to other Aβ species. Tau protein is highly phosphorylated at several residues in AD, and specifically phosphorylation at Ser202/Thr205 is known to be increased in AD. Several studies suggest that formation of plaques and tau phosphorylation might be linked to each other. To evaluate if Aβ-pE(3) and ptau Ser202/Thr205 levels correlate in human and transgenic AD mouse models, we analyzed human cortical and hippocampal brain tissue of different Braak stages as well as murine brain tissue of two transgenic mouse models for levels of Aβ-pE(3) and ptau Ser202/Thr205 and correlated the data. Our results show that Aβ-pE(3) formation is increased at early Braak stages while ptau Ser202/Thr205 mostly increases at later stages. Further analyses revealed strongest correlations between the two pathologies in the temporal, frontal, cingulate, and occipital cortex, however correlation in the hippocampus was weaker. Evaluation of murine transgenic brain tissue demonstrated a slow but steady increase of Aβ-pE(3) from 6 to 12 months of age in the cortex and hippocampus of APPSL mice, and a very early and strong Aβ-pE(3) increase in 5xFAD mice. ptau Ser202/Thr205 levels increased at the age of 9 months in APPSL mice and at 6 months in 5xFAD mice. Our results show that Aβ-pE(3) and ptau Ser202/Thr205 levels strongly correlate in human as well as murine tissues, suggesting that tau phosphorylation might be amplified by Aβ-pE(3)."

To reveal the effects of FOXL2 on the biological process and gene expression of ovarian granulosa cells (GCs), we established stable FOXL2-knockdown GCs and then analysed them using transcriptome sequencing. It was observed that knocking down FOXL2 affected the biological processes of cell proliferation, DNA replication, and apoptosis and affected cell cycle progression. FOXL2 knockdown promoted cell proliferation and DNA replication, decreased cell apoptosis, and promoted mitosis. In addition, by comparing the transcriptome after FOXL2 knockdown, we found a series of DEGs (differentially expressed genes) and related pathways. These results indicated that, through mediating these genes and pathways, the FOXL2 might induce the cell proliferation, cycle, and DNA replication, and play a key role during ovarian development and maintenance."
https://openalex.org/W3041625504,"Objective To assess the importance of ensuring medicine quality in order to achieve universal health coverage (UHC). Methods We developed a systems map connecting medicines quality assurance systems with UHC goals to illustrate the ensuing impact of quality-assured medicines in the implementation of UHC. The association between UHC and medicine quality was further examined in the context of essential medicines in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) by analyzing data on reported prevalence of substandard and falsified essential medicines and established indicators for UHC. Finally, we examined the health and economic savings of improving antimalarial quality in four countries in sub-Saharan Africa: the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Nigeria, Uganda, and Zambia. Findings A systems perspective demonstrates how quality assurance of medicines supports dimensions of UHC. Across 63 LMICs, the reported prevalence of substandard and falsified essential medicines was found to be negatively associated with both an indicator for coverage of essential services (p = 0.05) and with an indicator for government effectiveness (p = 0.04). We estimated that investing in improving the quality of antimalarials by 10% would result in annual savings of $8.3 million in Zambia, $14 million in Uganda, $79 million in two DRC regions, and $598 million in Nigeria, and was more impactful compared to other potential investments we examined. Costs of substandard and falsified antimalarials per malaria case ranged from $7 to $86, while costs per death due to poor-quality antimalarials ranged from $14,000 to $72,000. Conclusion Medicines quality assurance systems play a critical role in reaching UHC goals. By ensuring the quality of essential medicines, they help deliver effective treatments that lead to less illness and result in health care savings that can be reinvested towards UHC."
https://openalex.org/W3040847090,"Sex-related differences in cardiovascular diseases are highly complex in humans and model-dependent in experimental laboratory animals. The objective of this work was to comprehensively investigate key sex differences in the response to acute and prolonged adrenergic stimulation in C57Bl/6NCrl mice. Cardiac function was assessed by trans-thoracic echocardiography before and after acute adrenergic stimulation (a single sub-cutaneous dose of isoproterenol 10 mg/kg) in 15 weeks old male and female C57Bl/6NCrl mice. Thereafter, prolonged adrenergic stimulation was achieved by sub-cutaneous injections of isoproterenol 10 mg/kg/day for 14 days in male and female mice. Cardiac function and morphometry were assessed by trans-thoracic echocardiography on the 15th day. Thereafter, the mice were euthanized, and the hearts were collected. Histopathological analysis of myocardial tissue was performed after staining with hematoxylin & eosin, Masson’s trichrome and MAC-2 antibody. Gene expression of remodeling and fibrotic markers was assessed by real-time PCR. Cardiac function and morphometry were also measured before and after isoproterenol 10 mg/kg/day for 14 days in groups of gonadectomized male and female mice and sham-operated controls. In the current work, there were no statistically significant differences in the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of isoproterenol between male and female C57Bl/6NCrl. After prolonged adrenergic stimulation, there was similar degree of cardiac dysfunction, cardiac hypertrophy, and myocardial fibrosis in male and female mice. Similarly, prolonged isoproterenol administration induced hypertrophic and fibrotic genes in hearts of male and female mice to the same extent. Intriguingly, gonadectomy of male and female mice did not have a significant impact on isoproterenol-induced cardiac dysfunction as compared to sham-operated animals. The current work demonstrated lack of significant sex-related differences in isoproterenol-induced cardiac hypertrophy, dysfunction, and fibrosis in C57Bl/6NCrl mice. This study suggests that female sex may not be sufficient to protect the heart in this model of isoproterenol-induced cardiac dysfunction and underscores the notion that sexual dimorphism in cardiovascular diseases is highly model-dependent."
https://openalex.org/W3041844035,"The increasing prevalence of individuals with multiple food allergies and the need to distinguish between foods containing homologous, cross-reactive proteins have made the use of single-analyte antibody-based methods (e.g., ELISAs) sometimes insufficient. These issues have resulted in the need to conduct multiple analyses and sometimes employ orthogonal methods like mass spectrometry or DNA-based methods for confirmatory purposes. The xMAP Food Allergen Detection Assay (xMAP FADA) was developed to solve this problem while also providing increased throughput and a modular design suitable for adapting to changes in analytical needs. The use of built-in redundancy provides the xMAP FADA with built-in confirmatory analytical capability by including complementary antibody bead sets and secondary analytical end points (e.g., ratio analysis and multi-antibody profiling). A measure of a method’s utility is its performance when employed by analysts of varying expertise in multiple laboratory environments. To gauge this aspect, a multi-laboratory validation (MLV) was conducted with 11 participants of different levels of proficiency. The MLV entailed the analysis of incurred food samples in four problematic food matrices, meat sausage, orange juice, baked muffins, and dark chocolate. Except for a couple of instances, involving two confirmatory components in the analysis of baked muffins, the allergenic foods were detected by all participants at concentrations in the analytical samples comparable to ≤ 10 μg/g in the original food sample. In addition, despite high levels of inter-lab variance in the absolute intensities of the responses, the intra-laboratory reproducibility was sufficient to support analyses based on the calibration standards and direct comparison controls (DCCs) analyzed alongside the samples. In contrast, ratio analyses displayed inter-laboratory %CV (RSDR) values < 20%; presumably because the ratios are based on inherent properties of the antigenic elements. The excellent performance of the xMAP FADA when performed by analysts of varying proficiency indicates a reliability sufficient to meet analytical needs."

https://openalex.org/W3041697059,"Adaptation of weeds to water stress could result in the broader distribution, and make weed control task increasingly difficult. Therefore, a clear understanding of the biology of weeds under water stress could assist in the development of sustainable weed management strategies. Avena fatua (wild oat) and A. ludoviciana (sterile oat) are problematic weeds in Australian winter crops. The objectives of this study were to determine the growth and reproductive behaviour of A. fatua and A. ludoviciana at different soil moisture levels [20, 40, 60, 80, and 100% water holding capacity (WHC)]. Results revealed that A. fatua did not survive and failed to produce seeds at 20 and 40% WHC. However, A. ludoviciana survived at 40% WHC and produced 54 seeds plant-1. A. fatua produced a higher number of seeds per plant than A. ludoviciana at 80 (474 vs 406 seeds plant-1) and 100% WHC (480 vs 417 seeds plant-1). Seed production for both species remained similar at 80 and 100% WHC; however, higher than 60% WHC. Seed production of A. fatua and A. ludoviciana was 235 and 282 seeds plant-1, respectively, at 60% WHC. The 60% WHC reduced seed production of A. fatua and A. ludoviciana by 51 and 32% respectively, compared to 100% WHC. The plant height, leaf weight, stem weight, and root weight per plant of A. fatua at 60% WHC reduced by 45, 27, 32, and 59%, respectively, as compared with 100% WHC. Similarly, the plant height, leaf weight, stem weight, and root weight per plant of A. ludoviciana at 60% WHC reduced by 45, 35, 47 and 76%, respectively, as compared with 100% WHC. Results indicate that A. ludoviciana can survive and produce seeds at 40% of WHC, indicating the adaptation of the species to dryland conditions. The results also suggest that A. ludoviciana is likely to be robust under water stress conditions, potentially reducing crop yield. The ability of A. fatua and A. ludoviciana to produce seeds under water-stressed conditions (60% WHC) necessitates integrated weed management strategies that suppress these weeds whilst taking into account the efficient utilization of stored moisture for winter crops."

https://openalex.org/W3042009132,"Development of the cerebral cortex may be influenced by the composition of the maternal gut microbiota. To test this possibility, we administered probiotic Lactococcus lactis in drinking water to mouse dams from day 10.5 of gestation until pups reached postnatal day 1 (P1). Pups were assessed in a battery of behavioral tests starting at 10 weeks old. We found that females, but not males, exposed to probiotic during prenatal development spent more time in the center of the open field and displayed decreased freezing time in cue associated learning, compared to controls. Furthermore, we found that probiotic exposure changed the density of cortical neurons and increased the density of blood vessels in the cortical plate of P1 pups. Sex-specific differences were observed in the number of mitotic neural progenitor cells, which were increased in probiotic exposed female pups. In addition, we found that probiotic treatment in the latter half of pregnancy significantly increased plasma oxytocin levels in mouse dams, but not in the offspring. These results suggest that exposure of naïve, unstressed dams to probiotic may exert sex-specific long-term effects on cortical development and anxiety related behavior in the offspring."
https://openalex.org/W3041145084,"Abstract The ARHGAP35 gene encoding p190A RhoGAP (p190A) is significantly altered by both mutation and allelic deletion in human cancer, but the functional implications of such alterations are not known. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that p190A is a tumor suppressor using a xenograft mouse model with carcinoma cells harboring defined ARHGAP35 alterations. In vitro, restoration of p190A expression in carcinoma cells promotes contact inhibition of proliferation (CIP) through activation of LATS kinases and phosphorylation of the proto-oncogenic transcriptional co-activator YAP. In contrast, p190A forms harboring recurrent cancer mutations exhibit loss of function in modulating the Hippo pathway, inducing CIP, as well as attenuated suppression of tumor growth in mice. We determine that p190A promotes mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) and elicits expression of a cassette of epithelial adherens junction-associated genes in a cell density-dependent manner. This cassette includes CDH1 encoding E-cadherin, which amplifies p190A-mediated LATS activation and is necessary for CIP. Oppositely, we establish that p190A is obligatory for E-cadherin to activate LATS kinases and induce CIP. Collectively, this work defines a novel mechanism by which p190A and E-cadherin cooperate in modulating Hippo signaling to suppress tumor cell growth."
https://openalex.org/W3041437492,"The main functions of the choroid plexus (CP) are the production of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), the formation of the blood-CSF barrier, and regulation of immune response. This barrier allows for the exchange of specific nutrients, waste, and peripheral immune cells between the blood stream and CSF. Borrelia burgdorferi (Bb), the causative bacteria of Lyme disease, is associated with neurological complications including meningitis–indeed, Bb has been isolated from the CSF of patients. While it is accepted that B. burgdorferi can enter the central nervous system (CNS) of patients, it is unknown how the bacteria crosses this barrier and how the pathogenesis of the disease leads to the observed symptoms in patients. We hypothesize that during infection Borrelia burgdorferi will induce an immune response conducive to the chemotaxis of immune cells and subsequently lead to a pro-inflammatory state with the CNS parenchyma. Primary human choroid plexus epithelial cells were grown in culture and infected with B. burgdorferi strain B31 MI-16 for 48 hours. RNA was isolated and used for RNA sequencing and RT-qPCR validation. Secreted proteins in the supernatant were analyzed via ELISA. Transcriptome analysis based on RNA sequencing determined a total of 160 upregulated genes and 98 downregulated genes. Pathway and biological process analysis determined a significant upregulation in immune and inflammatory genes specifically in chemokine and interferon related pathways. Further analysis revealed downregulation in genes related to cell to cell junctions including tight and adherens junctions. These results were validated via RT-qPCR. Protein analysis of secreted factors showed an increase in inflammatory chemokines, corresponding to our transcriptome analysis. These data further demonstrate the role of the CP in the modulation of the immune response in a disease state and give insight into the mechanisms by which Borrelia burgdorferi may disseminate into, and act upon, the CNS. Future experiments aim to detail the impact of B. burgdorferi on the blood-CSF-barrier (BCSFB) integrity and inflammatory response within animal models."
https://openalex.org/W3041555700,"Background Various aspects of disrespect and abusive maternity care have received scholarly attention because of frequent reports of the phenomenon in most healthcare facilities globally, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Experiences of disrespect and abuse during childbirth may dissuade women from returning for facility-based postpartum services, for antenatal care, and delivery for future pregnancies and births. Midwives’ knowledge of respectful maternity care is critical in designing any interventive measures to address the menace of disrespect and abuse in maternity care. However, the perspectives of skilled providers on respectful maternal care have not been extensively studied. Therefore, the present study sought to explore the views of midwives on respectful maternity care at a teaching hospital in Kumasi, Ghana. Methods We employed an exploratory descriptive qualitative research design using an interpretative approach. Data were generated through individual in-depth interviews of fifteen midwives, which were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Open Code 4.03 was used to manage and analyse the data. Findings The midwives demonstrated some degree of awareness of respectful maternity care that comprised of the following components: non-abusive care, consented care, confidential care, non-violation of childbearing women’s basic human rights, and non-discriminatory care. However, midwives’ support for disrespectful and abusive practices such as hitting, pinching, and implicitly blaming childbearing women for mistreatment suggests that midwives awareness of respectful maternity care is disconnected from its practice. Conclusion In view of these findings, we recommend frequent in-service training for midwives and the institutionalization of regular supervision of intrapartum care services in the healthcare facility."
https://openalex.org/W3042184137,"Background Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe complication of malaria that remains largely unstudied. We aim to describe the development of ARDS associated with severe P. falciparum malaria, its management and impact on clinical outcome. Methods Retrospective observational study of adult patients admitted with severe P. falciparum malaria in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a tertiary care hospital from Portugal from 2008 to 2018. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with the development of ARDS, defined according to Berlin Criteria. Prognosis was assessed by case-fatality ratio, nosocomial infection and length of stay. Results 98 patients were enrolled, of which 32 (33%) developed ARDS, a median of 2 days after starting antimalarial medication (IQR 0–4, range 0–6). Length of stay in ICU and in hospital were significantly longer in patients who developed ARDS: 13 days (IQR 10–18) vs 3 days (IQR 2–5) and 21 days (IQR 15–30.5) vs 7 days (IQR 6–10), respectively. Overall case-fatality ratio in ICU was 4.1% and did not differ between groups. The risk of ARDS development is difficult to establish. Conclusion ARDS is a hard to predict late complication of severe malaria. A low threshold for ICU admission and monitoring should be used. Ideally patients should be managed in a centre with experience and access to advanced techniques."
https://openalex.org/W3040877558,"Background Zinc (Zn) deficiency is one of the most common micronutrient deficiencies worldwide. Accurate estimates of Zn intake would facilitate the design and implementation of effective nutritional interventions. Objective We sought to improve estimates of dietary Zn intake by evaluating staple crop Zn content and dietary Zn consumption by children under the age of 5 in 9 rural districts of Uganda. Methods We measured the Zn content of 581 crop samples from household farms and 167 crop samples from nearby markets, and administered food frequency questionnaires to the primary caretakers of 237 children. We estimated Zn consumption using 3 sources of crop Zn content: (i) the HarvestPlus food composition table (FCT) for Uganda, (ii) measurements from household crops, and (iii) measurements from market crops. Results The Zn content of staple crops varied widely, resulting in significantly different estimates of dietary Zn intake. 41% of children appeared to be at risk when estimates were based on market-sampled crops, 23% appeared at risk when estimates were based on the HarvestPlus FCT, and 16% appeared at risk when estimates were based on samples from household farms. Conclusion The use of FCTs to calculate Zn intake overestimated the risk of dietary inadequacy for children who primarily consumed staple crops that were produced on household farms, but underestimated the risk for children who primarily consumed staple crops that were purchased at market. More information on the Zn content of staple crops in developing countries could lead to more accurate estimates of dietary intake and associated deficiencies."
https://openalex.org/W3035333726,"Advances in digital health technologies have revolutionised home medical care. Yet many home medical devices (HMEDs, which includes devices referred to as ‘life support equipment’) rely upon a stable and resilient electricity supply. For users of HMEDs, interruptions to electricity supply can compromise treatment, well-being or survival. This paper addresses a challenge critical to the continued innovation in digital health technologies: the reliable supply of electricity. We bridge the current gap between electricity networks and digital health technologies through a novel method for the remote detection of the phase (that is, which part of the network that each house is connected to), in order to eliminate avoidable interruptions to supply for HMED users. We present an unsupervised phase identification algorithm capable of remote phase detection at scale, and without transformer data. This method translates data insights into actionable energy provision for HMED users and other vulnerable customers, enables more accurate management and planning, and improves electricity reliability which is critical for HMED users and the continued advances in digital health technologies."
https://openalex.org/W3040740753,"Rational medicines use (RMU) is the prescribing/dispensing of good quality medicines to meet individual patient's clinical needs. Policy-makers, managers and frontline providers play critical roles in safeguarding medicine usage thus ensuring their rational use. This study investigated perspectives of key health system actors on prescribing practices and factors influencing these in Eswatini. Public sector healthcare service delivery is through health facilities (public sector, not-for-profit faith-based, industrial) and community-based care.A qualitative, exploratory study using semi-structured in-depth interviews with seven policymakers and managers, and 32 facility-based actors was conducted. Drawing on Social Practice Theory, material (health system context), competence (provider) and cultural (patient and provider) factors influencing prescribing practices were explored.Participants were aged between 21-57years, had been practicing for 1-30 years, and were a mix of doctors, nurses, pharmacists and pharmacy-technicians. Factors contributing to irrational medicines use included: poor use of treatment guidelines, lack of RMU policies, poorly-functioning pharmaceutical and therapeutics committees, stock-outs of medicines, lack of pharmacy personnel in primary healthcare facilities, and restrictions of medicines by level of care. Provider-related factors included: knowledge, experience and practice ethic, symptomatic prescribing, high patient numbers. Patient-related factors included late presentation, language, and the need to be prescribed many medicines.In Eswatini, prescribing practices are influenced by the interaction of factors (health system, provider and patient) that span levels (facility, region, and policy-making) of the health system. Promoting RMU thus goes beyond the availability of guidelines and provider training and requires concerted efforts of multiple stakeholders."
https://openalex.org/W3040752619,"Background Access to neurology specialty care can influence outcomes in individuals with multiple sclerosis (MS), but may vary based on patient sociodemographic characteristics, including immigration status. Objective To compare health services utilization in the year of MS diagnosis, one year before diagnosis and two years after diagnosis in immigrants versus long-term residents in Ontario, Canada. Methods We identified incident cases of MS among adults aged 20–65 years by applying a validated algorithm to health administrative data in Ontario, Canada, a region with universal health insurance and comprehensive coverage. We separately assessed hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits, outpatient neurology visits, other outpatient specialty visits, and primary care visits. We compared rates of health service use in immigrants versus long-term residents using negative binomial regression models with generalized estimating equations adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status, urban/rural residence, MS diagnosis calendar year, and comorbidity burden. Results From 2003 to 2014, there were 13,028 incident MS cases in Ontario, of whom 1,070 (8.2%) were immigrants. As compared to long-term residents, rates of hospitalization were similar (Adjusted rate ratio (ARR) 0.86; 95% CI: 0.73–1.01) in immigrants the year before MS diagnosis, but outpatient neurology visits (ARR 0.93; 95% CI: 0.87–0.99) were slightly less frequent. However, immigrants had higher rates of hospitalization during the diagnosis year (ARR 1.20, 95% CI: 1.04–1.39), and had greater use of outpatient neurology (ARR 1.17, 95% CI: 1.12–1.23) but fewer ED visits (ARR 0.86; 95% CI: 0.78–0.96). In the first post-diagnosis year, immigrants continued to have greater numbers of outpatient neurology visits (ARR 1.16; 95% CI: 1.10–1.23), but had fewer hospitalizations (ARR 0.79; 95% CI: 0.67–0.94). Conclusions Overall, our findings were reassuring concerning health services access for immigrants with MS in Ontario, a publicly funded health care system. However, immigrants were more likely to be hospitalized despite greater use of outpatient neurology care in the year of MS diagnosis. Reasons for this may include more severe disease presentation or lack of social support among immigrants and warrant further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W3041181261,"The growth of administrative data made available publicly, often in near-real time, offers new opportunities for monitoring conditions that impact community health. Urban blight—manifestations of adverse social processes in the urban environment, including physical disorder, decay, and loss of anchor institutions—comprises many conditions considered to negatively affect the health of communities. However, measurement strategies for urban blight have been complicated by lack of uniform data, often requiring expensive street audits or the use of proxy measures that cannot represent the multifaceted nature of blight. This paper evaluates how publicly available data from New York City’s 311-call system can be used in a natural language processing approach to represent urban blight across the city with greater geographic and temporal precision. We found that our urban blight algorithm, which includes counts of keywords (‘tokens’), resulted in sensitivity ~90% and specificity between 55% and 76%, depending on other covariates in the model. The percent of 311 calls that were ‘blight related’ at the census tract level were correlated with the most common proxy measure for blight: short, medium, and long-term vacancy rates for commercial and residential buildings. We found the strongest association with long-term (>1 year) commercial vacancies (Pearson’s correlation coefficient = 0.16, p < 0.001). Our findings indicate the need of further validation, as well as testing algorithms that disambiguate the different facets of urban blight. These facets include physical disorder (e.g., litter, overgrown lawns, or graffiti) and decay (e.g., vacant or abandoned lots or sidewalks in disrepair) that are manifestations of social processes such as (loss of) neighborhood cohesion, social control, collective efficacy, and anchor institutions. More refined measures of urban blight would allow for better targeted remediation efforts and improved community health."
https://openalex.org/W3042112880,"Among the first steps in inflammation is the conversion of arachidonic acid (AA) stored in the cell membranes into leukotrienes. This occurs mainly in leukocytes and depends on the interaction of two proteins: 5-lipoxygenase (5LO), stored away from the nuclear membranes until use and 5-lipoxygenase activating protein (FLAP), a transmembrane, homotrimeric protein, constitutively present in nuclear membrane. We could earlier visualize the binding of 5LO to nanodiscs in the presence of Ca2+-ions by the use of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on samples negatively stained by sodium phosphotungstate. In the absence of Ca2+-ions 5LO did not bind to the membrane. In the present communication, FLAP reconstituted in the nanodiscs which could be purified if the His-tag was located on the FLAP C-terminus but not the N-terminus. Our aim was to find out if 1) 5LO would bind in a Ca2+-dependent manner also when FLAP is present? 2) Would the substrate (AA) have effects on 5LO binding to FLAP-nanodiscs? TEM was used to assess the complex formation between 5LO and FLAP-nanodiscs along with, sucrose gradient purification, gel-electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. It was found that presence of AA by itself induces complex formation in the absence of added calcium. This finding corroborates that AA is necessary for the complex formation and that a Ca2+-flush is mainly needed for the recruitment of 5LO to the membrane. Our results also showed that the addition of Ca2+-ions promoted binding of 5LO on the FLAP-nanodiscs as was also the case for nanodiscs without FLAP incorporated. In the absence of added substances no 5LO-FLAP complex was formed. Another finding is that the formation of a 5LO-FLAP complex appears to induce fragmentation of 5LO in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W3040997356,"Background The current international physical activity guidelines for health recommend children to engage in at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) daily. Yet, accurate prevalence estimates of physical activity levels of children are unavailable in many African countries due to the dearth of accelerometer-measured physical activity data. The aim of this study was to describe the prevalence and examine the socio-demographic correlates of accelerometer-measured physical activity among school-going children in Kampala city, Uganda. Methods A cross-sectional study design was used to recruit a sample of 10–12 years old school-going children (n = 256) from 7 primary schools (3 public schools and 4 private schools) in Kampala city, Uganda. Sedentary time, light-intensity physical activity (LPA), moderate-intensity physical activity (MPA) and vigorous-intensity physical activity (VPA) were measured by accelerometers (ActiGraph GT3X+ [Pensacola, Florida, USA]) over a seven-day period. Socio-demographic factors were assessed by a parent/guardian questionnaire. Weight status was generated from objectively measured height and weight and computed as body mass index (BMI). Multi-level logistic regressions identified socio-demographic factors that were associated with meeting physical activity guidelines. Results Children’s sedentary time was 9.8±2.1 hours/day and MVPA was 56±25.7 minutes/day. Only 36.3% of the children (38.9% boys, 34.3% girls) met the physical activity guidelines. Boys, thin/normal weight and public school children had significantly higher mean daily MVPA levels. Socio-demographic factors associated with odds of meeting physical activity guidelines were younger age (OR = 0.68; 95% CI = 0.55–0.84), thin/normal weight status (OR = 4.08; 95% CI = 1.42–11.76), and socioeconomic status (SES) indicators such as lower maternal level of education (OR = 2.43; 95% CI = 1.84–3.21) and no family car (OR = 0.31; 95% CI = 0.17–0.55). Conclusion Children spent a substantial amount of time sedentary and in LPA and less time in MVPA. Few children met the physical activity guidelines. Lower weight status, lower maternal education level and no family car were associated with meeting physical activity guidelines. Effective interventions and policies to increase physical activity among school-going children in Kampala, are urgently needed."

We apply eight machine learning techniques, including naive Bayes classifier (NB), support vector machine (SVM), elastic net regression (ENET), logistic regression (LR), lasso regression (LAR), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), boosted regression tree (BRT) and random forest model (RF). The RF method is selected as the best model for classification. Out of 33 features considered in this study, we identify 12 variables as relatively important risk factors for VTE. Finally, we examine the interaction impacts of BMI on these important VTE risk factors. We conclude that the impacts of risk factors on VTE incidence are varying across different BMI groups, and the variations are different for different risk factors. Therefore the interaction impacts of BMI on the other risk factors have to be taken into account in order to better understand the incidence of VTE."
https://openalex.org/W3042145812,"A retrospective study of admission data of 401 West Indian manatees (Trichechus manatus latirostris) presented to the David A. Straz Jr. Manatee Critical Care Center at ZooTampa at Lowry Park (ZooTampa) for rehabilitation from August 1991 through October 2017. Causes of admittance, location of rescue, gender, and age class were all recorded for each manatee admitted. Admittance categories as defined by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) included watercraft collisions, natural causes, entanglement, entrapment, orphaned calves, captive born, mothers of rescued calves, calves of rescued mothers, human, and other. The admitted population was primarily from the southwest and northwest coasts and related waterways of Florida. The gender difference was relatively equivocal (54% female) while the adults comprised 79% of the admissions. The overall total admissions increased steadily over the study period as did the admissions for each individual categories of admission. Watercraft collisions and natural causes combined were 71% of all admissions for the entire study period and are the dominant causes of admission. Watercraft collisions are more likely to occur during May through October, whereas natural causes of admittance are more likely to occur between December and March. Rehabilitated manatees may reduce overall manatee mortality and can provide insight into population-based health concerns if evaluated appropriately. Future efforts can incorporate physical examination findings, hematology, biochemistry profiles, and ancillary diagnostic testing to continue to improve the individual welfare of this marine mammal in its natural range. Admissions data could also potentially serve the wider conservation and recovery efforts if it is proven that the data obtained is at least as informative as that obtained by the carcass salvage program. Limited conservation resources could then be re-directed as new challenges arise with the expanding population and potentially expanding range of this species."

BRS implantation was opted in younger patients (53.7 vs. 62.6 years, p < 0.001) with low-risk profiles, and intravascular image-guided PCI was more preferred in the BRS group (60.3% vs. 27.2%, p < 0.001).At 1-year follow-up, no differences in the rate of DOCE and device thrombosis were observed between patients with AMI treated with BRS and those treated with DP-EES. Our data suggest that imaging-guided BRS implantation in young patients with low risk profiles could be a reasonable strategy in the setting of AMI."
https://openalex.org/W3041357634,"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the physical form of starter and inclusion of hay in the diet of preweaning dairy calves on performance, digestibility, ruminal development, and mRNA expression of genes involved in ruminal metabolism. Holstein × Gyr crossbred male calves (n = 38 1day old) were assigned to 3 treatments for 9 weeks: Control (n = 13; pellet starter with 4 mm diameter and 18 mm length and 4% steam-flaked corn), Ground (n = 12; same starter of the control but ground pass through a 4.0 mm sieve), or Ground plus 5% chopped Tifton hay GH (n = 13). All calves were fed 4 L/d of whole milk up to 63 d of age and were abruptly weaned at 64 d of age. Water and diets were offered ad libitum. Samples of ruminal contents were obtained from all animals at 30, 45, and 60 d of age to evaluate pH, ammonia nitrogen, and volatile fatty acids (VFA). At 55 d of age, an apparent digestibility assay was performed using 18 animals (n = 6/ treatment). At 65 d of age, the 18 animals were euthanized to evaluate the development of the digestive tract. The physical form of starter and the dietary inclusion of hay did not influence starter intake (Control 326 g/d, Ground 314 g/d and GH 365 g/d), daily weight gain (Control 541g/d, Ground 531g/d and GH 606g/d), feed efficiency, apparent nutrient digestibility, energy partitioning, nitrogen balance, ruminal pH, ammonia nitrogen concentration, VFA, the development of the digestive tract and the mRNA expression of genes involved in AGV metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W3040753575,"Background The impact of nutritional supplements on weight gain in HIV-infected children on antiretroviral treatment (ART) remains uncertain. Starting supplements depends upon current weight-for-age or other acute malnutrition indicators, producing time-dependent confounding. However, weight-for-age at ART initiation may affect subsequent weight gain, independent of supplement use. Implications for marginal structural models (MSMs) with inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) are unclear. Methods In the ARROW trial, non-randomised supplement use and weight-for-age were recorded monthly from ART initiation. The effect of supplements on weight-for-age over the first year was estimated using generalised estimating equation MSMs with IPTW, both with and without interaction terms between baseline weight-for-age and time. Separately, data were simulated assuming no supplement effect, with use depending on current weight-for-age, and weight-for-age trajectory depending on baseline weight-for-age to investigate potential bias associated with different MSM specifications. Results In simulations, despite correctly specifying IPTW, omitting an interaction in the MSM between baseline weight-for-age and time produced increasingly biased estimates as associations between baseline weight-for-age and subsequent weight trajectory increased. Estimates were unbiased when the interaction between baseline weight-for-age and time was included, even if the data were simulated with no such interaction. In ARROW, without an interaction the estimated effect was +0.09 (95%CI +0.02,+0.16) greater weight-for-age gain per month’s supplement use; this reduced to +0.03 (-0.04,+0.10) including the interaction. Discussion This study highlights a specific situation in which MSM model misspecification can occur and impact the resulting estimate. Since an interaction in the MSM (outcome) model does not bias the estimate of effect if the interaction does not exist, it may be advisable to include such a term when fitting MSMs for repeated measures."
