https://openalex.org/W2323566388,"Pancreatic insulin-producing β-cells have a long lifespan, such that in healthy conditions they replicate little during a lifetime. Nevertheless, they show increased self-duplication after increased metabolic demand or after injury (that is, β-cell loss). It is not known whether adult mammals can differentiate (regenerate) new β-cells after extreme, total β-cell loss, as in diabetes. This would indicate differentiation from precursors or another heterologous (non-β-cell) source. Here we show β-cell regeneration in a transgenic model of diphtheria-toxin-induced acute selective near-total β-cell ablation. If given insulin, the mice survived and showed β-cell mass augmentation with time. Lineage-tracing to label the glucagon-producing α-cells before β-cell ablation tracked large fractions of regenerated β-cells as deriving from α-cells, revealing a previously disregarded degree of pancreatic cell plasticity. Such inter-endocrine spontaneous adult cell conversion could be harnessed towards methods of producing β-cells for diabetes therapies, either in differentiation settings in vitro or in induced regeneration. The insulin-producing β-cells of the pancreas are long lived and replicate little during a lifetime, but can duplicate upon injury or metabolic demand. Work in a transgenic mouse model in which β-cells are nearly almost completely ablated shows that adult α-cells, normally responsible for producing the peptide hormone glucagon, can be spontaneously reprogrammed to become β-cells. This unexpected display of pancreatic cell plasticity suggests possible diabetes therapies involving either differentiation settings for in vitro cell production or induced regeneration in vivo. And the production of new models for selective and total cell killing could reveal previously unrecognized cell plasticity in other organs. In the pancreas, insulin-producing β-cells are long-lived and generally replicate seldom. They can do so, however, after increased metabolic demand or after injury. Here, a new transgenic model is developed in which β-cells are nearly completely ablated in mice. If given insulin, these mice survive, and grow new β-cells. Lineage-tracing shows that these new β-cells come from α-cells, revealing a previously disregarded degree of pancreatic cell plasticity."

Whereas the genomic locations of several pluripotency transcription factors have been reported, the spectrum of their interaction partners is underexplored. Here, we use an improved affinity protocol to purify Oct4-interacting proteins from mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Subsequent purification of Oct4 partners Sall4, Tcfcp2l1, Dax1, and Esrrb resulted in an Oct4 interactome of 166 proteins, including transcription factors and chromatin-modifying complexes with documented roles in self-renewal, but also many factors not previously associated with the ESC network. We find that Esrrb associated with the basal transcription machinery and also detect interactions between transcription factors and components of the TGF-β, Notch, and Wnt signaling pathways. Acute depletion of Oct4 reduced binding of Tcfcp2l1, Dax1, and Esrrb to several target genes. In conclusion, our purification protocol allowed us to bring greater definition to the circuitry controlling pluripotent cell identity.

Embryo-derived stem cells: Of mice and men.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 435-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (1020) Google Scholar). This self-renewal capacity is regulated by a set of transcription factors including Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 (Niwa, 2007Niwa H. How is pluripotency determined and maintained?.Development. 2007; 134: 635-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). ESCs are particularly sensitive to dosage alterations in Oct4; a 50% increase or decrease in the level of Oct4 causes differentiation into cells expressing markers of endoderm and mesoderm or trophectoderm, respectively (Niwa et al., 2000Niwa H. Miyazaki J. Smith A.G. Quantitative expression of Oct-3/4 defines differentiation, dedifferentiation or self-renewal of ES cells.Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar). Oct4 also plays a central role in the reprogramming of both human and mouse fibroblasts into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (Okita et al., 2007Okita K. Ichisaka T. Yamanaka S.

Oct4 is one of a set of reprogramming factors that usually also includes Sox2, Klf4, and c-myc (Hochedlinger and Plath, 2009Hochedlinger K. Plath K. Epigenetic reprogramming and induced pluripotency.Development. 2009; 136: 509-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar, Yamanaka, 2009Yamanaka S. A fresh look at iPS cells.Cell. 2009; 137: 13-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). Sox2, Klf4, and c-myc can be replaced by family members such as Sox1, Sox3, Klf2, Klf5, L-Myc, and N-Myc, but without Oct4 no reprogramming occurs (Nakagawa et al., 2008Nakagawa M. Koyanagi M. Tanabe K. Takahashi K. Ichisaka T. Aoi T. Okita K. Mochiduki Y. Takizawa N. Yamanaka S. Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells without Myc from mouse and human fibroblasts.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 101-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar). Recently, genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses in mouse ESCs have identified the genomic binding sites of Oct4 and a number of other ESC transcription factors (Chen et al., 2008bChen X.

Oct4 clusters with a variable but overlapping set of transcription factors at many genomic locations, including promoters and enhancers (reviewed in Chambers and Tomlinson, 2009Chambers I. Tomlinson S.R. The transcriptional foundation of pluripotency.Development. 2009; 136: 2311-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Clusters with a relatively high number of different transcription factors appear to correlate with ESC-specific expression of the nearby gene (Chen et al., 2008bChen X. Xu H. Yuan P. Fang F. Huss M. Vega V.B. Wong E. Orlov Y.L. Zhang W.

An extended transcriptional network for pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2008; 132: 1049-1061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). The mechanism for this molecular clustering may have similarities with the partnership of Oct4 with Sox2. Oct4 and Sox2 have low affinity for each other in solution (Ambrosetti et al., 1997Ambrosetti D.C. Basilico C. Dailey L. Synergistic activation of the fibroblast growth factor 4 enhancer by Sox2 and Oct-3 depends on protein-protein interactions facilitated by a specific spatial arrangement of factor binding sites.Mol.

The high-mobility-group domain of Sox proteins interacts with DNA-binding domains of many transcription factors.Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: 1735-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), yet this affinity is critical for the cooperative binding of Oct and Sox proteins to adjacent sites on DNA (Ambrosetti et al., 1997Ambrosetti D.C. Basilico C. Dailey L. Synergistic activation of the fibroblast growth factor 4 enhancer by Sox2 and Oct-3 depends on protein-protein interactions facilitated by a specific spatial arrangement of factor binding sites.Mol.

Crystal structure of a POU/HMG/DNA ternary complex suggests differential assembly of Oct4 and Sox2 on two enhancers.Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 2048-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Therefore, identifying the interaction partners of transcription factors important for pluripotency could add novel components to the pluripotency transcriptional network and help to elucidate the assembly mechanism of transcription factor clusters. However, physical interactions between ESC transcription factors remain underinvestigated. Low-affinity interactions between transcription factors together with the generation of sufficient ESC material for biochemical purification complicate an effective search for interaction partners. To address these drawbacks, we improved the FLAG-affinity-based protein purification protocol. By using only small amounts of starting material, we initially purified FLAG-tagged Oct4 and its interacting proteins from mouse ESCs. Subsequently, we purified four of the identified Oct4-interacting ESC transcription factors: Sall4, Esrrb, Dax1, and Tcfcp2l1. The resulting interaction network contains many transcriptional regulators and chromatin-modifying complexes known to play roles in ESC self-renewal, as well as transcriptional regulators not previously affiliated with pluripotency. We find associations between transcription factors and several signaling pathways and identify a physical connection between the ESC transcription factor Esrrb and the basal transcription machinery. Thus, our methodology allowed for a much more detailed view of the physical interactions between factors that act in the ESC pluripotency network. We have previously described a mouse ESC line in which, under self-renewing conditions, all the Oct4 protein in the cell has an N-terminal triple FLAG-tag (F-Oct4) (van den Berg et al., 2008van den Berg D.L. Zhang W. Yates A. Engelen E. Takacs K. Bezstarosti K. Demmers J. Chambers I. Poot R.A. Estrogen-related receptor beta interacts with Oct4 to positively regulate Nanog gene expression.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 5986-5995Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Both F-Oct4 and the parental ZHBTc4 cells have a normal ESC morphology (Niwa et al., 2000Niwa H. Miyazaki J. Smith A.G. Quantitative expression of Oct-3/4 defines differentiation, dedifferentiation or self-renewal of ES cells.Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (2857) Google Scholar, van den Berg et al., 2008van den Berg D.L. Zhang W. Yates A. Engelen E. Takacs K. Bezstarosti K. Demmers J. Chambers I. Poot R.A.

Biol. 2008; 28: 5986-5995Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) and express normal levels of ESC markers Sox2, Sall4 (Figure S1A available online), Klf4, Dax1, Zfp42, and Eras (Figure S1B). This indicates that the F-Oct4 protein present in the F-Oct4 cells maintains their ESC identity. We prepared nuclear extracts from F-Oct4 cells and ZHBTc4 cells, which do not express F-Oct4 and serve as a control. FLAG-affinity purifications were performed from 1.5 ml of nuclear extract (equivalent to ∼4 × 108 cells) with an improved protocol in which near-physiological salt conditions, low detergent concentrations, and low-adherence tubes were employed (see Experimental Procedures for details). Benzonase nuclease was added to the extract to remove the remaining DNA (Figure S1C), thereby eliminating protein interactions mediated indirectly by DNA bridging. Virtually all F-Oct4 in the extract was bound to the FLAG-antibody beads and subsequently eluted by FLAG peptide competition (Figure S1D). An SDS polyacrylamide gel of the eluted fractions, stained with a sensitive Colloidal Coomassie protocol, showed Oct4 as the predominant band in the F-Oct4 sample (Figure 1A ). The control sample showed only one prominent band, which was also present in the F-Oct4 sample but was otherwise devoid of major contaminants. This indicates that our FLAG-mediated purification of Oct4 has a very good signal to background ratio. The presence of multiple bands of lower intensity in the F-Oct4 lane suggests that Oct4 interacts with a variety of proteins at substoichiometric levels. The majority of Oct4 runs at approximately its own molecular weight on a gel filtration column (Figure S1E), unlike a stable complex such as NuRD. Therefore, most Oct4 interactions are likely to be weak and do not survive the 4 hr gel filtration procedure, in which dissociation causes an irreversible loss of the interaction. To independently verify candidate F-Oct4-interacting proteins, we also immunoprecipitated endogenous Oct4 from nuclear extracts of a different ESC line, 46C (Ying et al., 2003Ying Q.L. Stavridis M. Griffiths D. Li M. Smith A. Conversion of embryonic stem cells into neuroectodermal precursors in adherent monoculture.Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 183-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar), with an antibody that captured all Oct4 from the extract (Figure S1F). Although we used the same buffer conditions and low-adherence tubes, this procedure gives higher background compared to the FLAG-affinity purification (Figure 1B), because proteins that bind nonspecifically to the antibody beads or the tubes cannot be excluded from the eluate by FLAG-peptide elution, as they can in the FLAG purification strategy. We analyzed three independent F-Oct4 purifications and the endogenous Oct4 immunoprecipitation by mass spectrometry (Table 1). A representation of the identified proteins by a more quantitative measure, emPAI score (Ishihama et al., 2005Ishihama Y. Oda Y. Tabata T. Sato T. Nagasu T. Rappsilber J. Mann M. Exponentially modified protein abundance index (emPAI) for estimation of absolute protein amount in proteomics by the number of sequenced peptides per protein.Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 1265-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar), is shown in Table S1. Our list of more than 50 putative Oct4-associated proteins (Table 1) contains 22 transcription factors of which half have a role in maintaining pluripotency (Table 2). These include Sall4, Klf5, Zfp143, Esrrb, and Sox2, the best-characterized Oct4 partner for which 3D structures of the Oct4-Sox2-DNA ternary complex have been reported (Reményi et al., 2003Reményi A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 1449-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). We also identified a number of chromatin-modifying complexes (CMCs). All of the subunits of the transcriptional repressor NuRD were specifically present, except for Rbbp4 (high background prevented inclusion of Rbbp4 in Table 1). We detected subunits from the chromatin-remodeling complexes SWI/SNF and Trrap/p400, the Lsd1 histone demethylase complex, and components of the polycomb repression complex 1 (PRC1).Table 1Oct4-Interacting Proteins as Identified by Mass Spectrometry Analysis of Purified Oct4 SamplesProteinAccessionFlag#1Flag#2Flag#3Oct4-IPAverage MascotMascotaMascot score for the specified protein in the Oct4 sample, purified by FLAG affinity or Oct4 immunoprecipitation (Oct4-IP).

Open table in a new tab Thresholds for inclusion of the identified proteins are in Experimental Procedures. See also Table S1. Next we examined the presence of some of the identified interactors in Oct4 immunoprecipitates by immunoblotting. Indeed, we find that NuRD subunit Mta2 (Figure 1C), spalt-like protein Sall4, histone-demethylase Lsd1 (Figure 1D), Sall1, and Wdr5 (Figure S1G) coprecipitate with Oct4, whereas immunoprecipitates of Mta2 (Figure 1E) and Wdr5 (Figure S1H) contain Oct4. Recently, it was suggested that a subset of the NuRD subunits (Mta1 and 2, Gatad2a and Gatad2b, Hdac1 and 2) forms an Oct4/Nanog-associated complex called NODE (Nanog- and Oct4-associated deacetylase; Liang et al., 2008Liang J. Wan M. Zhang Y. Gu P. Xin H. Jung S.Y. Qin J. Wong J. Cooney A.J. Liu D. Songyang Z. Nanog and Oct4 associate with unique transcriptional repression complexes in embryonic stem cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 731-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). We found that Oct4 binds the classical NuRD complex, as it was originally defined (Zhang et al., 1999Zhang Y. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Analysis of the NuRD subunits reveals a histone deacetylase core complex and a connection with DNA methylation.Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar), including catalytic subunit Mi2β and Mbd3 and Rbbp7 (Table 1). Immunoblotting confirmed this; the proportionate amount of antigen detected for Mi2β, Mbd3, Mta1, and Mta2 was the same in FLAG-Oct4 and Mta2 IP samples (Figure 1F). This suggests that Oct4-bound NuRD is similar or identical to classical NuRD in its composition and argues against the existence of Oct4-bound NuRD subcomplexes, such as NODE. Proteins that interact with Oct4 may be expected to be Oct4 cofactors in gene regulation and have DNA binding profiles that overlap with Oct4. Recently, two studies reported the genome-wide binding sites of different sets of ESC transcription factors (Chen et al., 2008bChen X. Xu H. Yuan P. Fang F. Huss M. Vega V.B. Wong E. Orlov Y.L.

Five of the Oct4-interacting transcription factors identified here (Sox2, Nac1, Tcfcp2l1, Esrrb, Dax1) were investigated in those studies and were found to colocalize frequently with Oct4 (Table 2), including at the promoters of important pluripotency genes such as Nanog and Oct4 (Chen et al., 2008bChen X.

Phenotypes are documented for ∼60% of the identified Oct4-interacting proteins (Table 2). Of these, ∼65% (21/32) of the tested factors (Table 2) affect the ability of ESCs to remain undifferentiated. This includes most of the aforementioned transcription factors and subunits of all the identified Oct4-associated chromatin-modifying complexes (Table 2), except for the Lsd1 complex. We then investigated whether genes encoding Oct4-interacting proteins are bound and regulated by Oct4. Gene expression profiling data from ZHBTc4 ESCs, which express Oct4 from a doxycycline-repressible transgene (Sharov et al., 2008Sharov A.A. Masui S. Sharova L.V. Piao Y. Aiba K. Matoba R. Xin L.

Xu H. Yuan P. Fang F. Huss M. Vega V.B. Wong E. Orlov Y.L. Zhang W.

An extended transcriptional network for pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2008; 132: 1049-1061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1057) Google Scholar). We find that 14 factors (26%) are encoded by genes bound by Oct4 that are downregulated after 48 hr of doxycycline treatment (Table 2). This correlation of Oct4 binding and transcriptional regulation by Oct4 increases the interdependence of the associated proteins with Oct4, as previously observed (Wang et al., 2006Wang J. Rao S. Chu J. Shen X. Levasseur D.N. Theunissen T.W. Orkin S.H. A protein interaction network for pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2006; 444: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). Having established that our FLAG-affinity purification protocol identifies novel interactions that are independently verifiable and biologically relevant, an expanded network of Oct4 interactions was sought. Sall4, Esrrb, Dax1, and Tcfcp2l1 were selected for purification because of their consistent presence in all Oct4 purifications (Table 1). The spalt-like transcription factor Sall4 is important for stabilizing ESC self-renewal (Yuri et al., 2009Yuri S. Fujimura S. Nimura K. Takeda N. Toyooka Y. Fujimura Y. Aburatani H. Ura K. Koseki H.

During vertebrate embryogenesis, vascular patterning is initially guided by conserved genetic pathways that act before circulation. Subsequently, endothelial cells must incorporate the mechanosensory stimulus of blood flow with these early signals to shape the embryonic vascular system. However, few details are known about how these signals are integrated during development. To investigate this process, we focused on the aortic arch (AA) blood vessels, which are known to remodel in response to blood flow. By using two-photon imaging of live zebrafish embryos, we observe that flow is essential for angiogenesis during AA development. We further find that angiogenic sprouting of AA vessels requires a flow-induced genetic pathway in which the mechano-sensitive zinc finger transcription factor klf2a induces expression of an endothelial-specific microRNA, mir-126, to activate Vegf signalling. Taken together, our work describes a novel genetic mechanism in which a microRNA facilitates integration of a physiological stimulus with growth factor signalling in endothelial cells to guide angiogenesis."

Despite the recent flurry of studies, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms and players that drive ESC self-renewal and differentiation is still limited. The POU transcription factor Oct4, also termed Pou5f1, is a central player in ESC self-renewal and differentiation into specific lineages. Levels of Oct4 must be tightly regulated to maintain the ESC status. A decrease in Oct4 levels by 50% induces differentiation toward the trophectoderm lineage, whereas a 50% increase causes differentiation into mesoderm and endoderm (Niwa et al., 2000Niwa H.

Oct4 plays an essential role in early development given that loss of Oct4 in the mouse embryo causes the failure of the inner cell mass to develop (Nichols et al., 1998Nichols J. Zevnik B.

Oct4 regulates transcriptional programs to maintain ESC pluripotency primarily in collaboration with transcription factors Sox2 and Nanog (Boyer et al., 2005Boyer L.A. Lee T.I. Cole M.F.

Also recently, various other factors have been functionally linked to Oct4 and Nanog, after identification of their binding partners by affinity purification and mass spectrometry (Wang et al., 2006Wang J. Rao S. Chu J. Shen X. Levasseur D.N. Theunissen T.W. Orkin S.H. A protein interaction network for pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2006; 444: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, Liang et al., 2008Liang J. Wan M. Zhang Y. Gu P. Xin H. Jung S.Y. Qin J. Wong J. Cooney A.J. Liu D. Songyang Z. Nanog and Oct4 associate with unique transcriptional repression complexes in embryonic stem cells.Nat. Cell Biol. 2008; 10: 731-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). These studies have revealed a compact regulatory module responsible for ESC pluripotency (Orkin et al., 2008Orkin S.H. Wang J. Kim J. Chu J. Rao S. Theunissen T.W. Shen X. Levasseur D.N. The transcriptional network controlling pluripotency in ES cells.Cold Spring Harb. Symp. Quant. Biol. 2008; 73: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). To further elucidate the ESC transcriptional network, we have carried out an unbiased and extensive study of Oct4-associated proteins, using an affinity purification and mass spectrometry approach. In contrast with a previous similar study (Wang et al., 2006Wang J. Rao S. Chu J. Shen X. Levasseur D.N. Theunissen T.W. Orkin S.H. A protein interaction network for pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Nature. 2006; 444: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar), epitope-tagged Oct4 was expressed under the control of Oct4's endogenous promoter to keep the natural transcriptional regulation. The epitope tagging strategy circumvents the need for specific antibodies and facilitates a generic purification procedure that results in cleaner and higher yield samples than traditional immunoprecipitation experiments. Our data significantly expands the current repertoire of Oct4-associated proteins, thereby shedding light on the complex regulatory circuitries of ESCs. The Oct4 interactome provides a useful resource to investigate the mechanisms of Oct4 function and regulation and to explore the basic principles underlying stem cell biology. To investigate the molecular network around Oct4/Pou5f1, we used an epitope-tagging affinity purification strategy. We modified the SPA tag (Zeghouf et al., 2004Zeghouf M. Li J. Butland G. Borkowska A. Canadien V. Richards D. Beattie B. Emili A. Greenblatt J.F. Sequential Peptide Affinity (SPA) system for the identification of mammalian and bacterial protein complexes.J. Proteome Res. 2004; 3: 463-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) containing the 3× FLAG epitope and a calmodulin binding peptide (CBP) separated by a TEV cleavage site, by adding an extra TEV site to improve cleavage efficiency (Figure S1A available online). The FTAP was fused at the C terminus of the Oct4 coding region by recombineering into a BAC clone containing full-length Oct4. This was then integrated into the Hprt locus of ESCs by recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) (Prosser et al., 2008Prosser H.M. Rzadzinska A.K. Steel K.P. Bradley A. Mosaic complementation demonstrates a regulatory role for myosin VIIa in actin dynamics of stereocilia.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2008; 28: 1702-1712Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The whole procedure is depicted in Figure S1B. Expression levels of the Oct4-FTAP fusion protein were ∼30% that of endogenous Oct4 expressed from two alleles (Figure S1C), close to what should be expected given that it is expressed from an extra copy of the gene and avoiding interference with the ESC phenotype, as shown by the expression of ESC markers by the transgenic clone (Figure S1C). The tandem affinity tag allows single- and double-affinity purifications. We first performed three independent one-step purifications on whole-cell extracts from both Oct4-FTAP-expressing and control unmodified cells (Figure 1A ). Eluates were separated by gel electrophoresis, and whole lanes were excised into several regions, digested, and analyzed by nano-liquid chromatrography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). MS results files from each lane were merged and searched against IPI with Mascot. The data is available in the PRIDE database (Martens et al., 2005Martens L. Hermjakob H. Jones P. Adamski M. Taylor C. States D. Gevaert K. Vandekerckhove J. Apweiler R. PRIDE: The proteomics identifications database.Proteomics. 2005; 5: 3537-3545Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) (www.ebi.ac.uk/pride). The data was converted with the PRIDE Converter (Barsnes et al., 2009Barsnes H. Vizcaíno J.A. Eidhammer I. Martens L. PRIDE Converter: Making proteomics data-sharing easy.Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 598-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) (http://code.google.com/p/pride-converter). The criteria for peptide and protein identification are detailed in Experimental Procedures. Mass spectrometry analysis resulted in the identification of 92 proteins (excluding Oct4 itself) that were present in all Oct4-FTAP purifications, but not in controls (Table 1). The identification of some of the interacting proteins was confirmed by Western blotting (Figure 1B). These data considerably expand the list of published Oct4 binding partners and represent a major extension of the sets reported in two similar studies (Liang et al., 2008Liang J. Wan M. Zhang Y.

We next performed tandem affinity purification, although yields were not high because of the low levels of tagged Oct4 and purification efficiency. We identified seven proteins of the 92, mainly members of NuRD, Sall proteins, and transcription factors E3 and EB (Table S6). We believe these constitute the highest-affinity interactors, given that they can endure a more stringent purification. Although yielding small numbers of interactors, this purification is still at the level of previous similar studies (Liang et al., 2008Liang J. Wan M. Zhang Y. Gu P. Xin H. Jung S.Y. Qin J. Wong J.

https://openalex.org/W2065339494,"Human pluripotent stem cells offer promise for use in cell-based therapies for brain injury and diseases. However, their cellular behavior is poorly understood. Here we show that the expression of the brain-specific microRNA-9 (miR-9) is turned on in human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) derived from human embryonic stem cells. Loss of miR-9 suppressed proliferation but promoted migration of hNPCs cultured in vitro. hNPCs without miR-9 activity also showed enhanced migration when transplanted into mouse embryonic brains or adult brains of a mouse model of stroke. These effects were not due to precocious differentiation of hNPCs. One of the key targets directly regulated by miR-9 encodes stathmin, which increases microtubule instability and whose expression in hNPCs correlates inversely with that of miR-9. Partial inhibition of stathmin activity suppressed the effects of miR-9 loss on proliferation and migration of human or embryonic rat neural progenitors. These results identify miR-9 as a novel regulator that coordinates the proliferation and migration of hNPCs.

The clinical efficacy of grafted progenitor cells critically depends on their ability to migrate to the appropriate sites in the adult central nervous system without unwanted proliferation and tumor formation. However, little is known about the cellular behavior of hNPCs derived from hESCs or how their proliferation and migration are coordinated. Although experiments in rodent models have provided important molecular insights into these cellular processes (e.g., Cobos et al., 2007Cobos I. Borello U. Rubenstein J.L.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, noncoding RNAs of ∼21–23 nucleotides that regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level (Ambros, 2001Ambros V. microRNAs: Tiny regulators with great potential.Cell. 2001; 107: 823-826Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1350) Google Scholar, Hobert, 2008Hobert O. Gene regulation by transcription factors and microRNAs.Science. 2008; 319: 1785-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (673) Google Scholar). They mostly destabilize target mRNAs or suppress their translation by binding to complementary sequences in the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) (Filipowicz et al., 2008Filipowicz W. Bhattacharyya S.N. Sonenberg N. Mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation by microRNAs: Are the answers in sight?.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (3921) Google Scholar). However, miRNAs also target 5′UTRs or coding regions and, in a few cases, upregulate expression of their target mRNAs (Tay et al., 2008Tay Y. Zhang J. Thomson A.M. Lim B. Rigoutsos I. MicroRNAs to Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2 coding regions modulate embryonic stem cell differentiation.Nature. 2008; 455: 1124-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1098) Google Scholar, Vasudevan et al., 2007Vasudevan S. Tong Y. Steitz J.A. Switching from repression to activation: MicroRNAs can up-regulate translation.Science. 2007; 318: 1931-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (2072) Google Scholar). Many miRNAs are developmentally regulated and expressed in tissue-specific patterns, indicating important functions in development (Bushati and Cohen, 2007Bushati N. Cohen S.M. microRNA functions.Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2007; 23: 175-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (2155) Google Scholar, Zhao and Srivastava, 2007Zhao Y. Srivastava D. A developmental view of microRNA function.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 189-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Despite rapid progress in understanding their functions, the precise roles of many miRNAs in the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of hESCs and hESC-derived hNPCs remain unknown. Several miRNAs have been implicated in neuronal development in model organisms (Kosik, 2006Kosik K.S. The neuronal microRNA system.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2006; 7: 911-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (646) Google Scholar, Gao, 2008Gao F.B.

One, miR-9, is 100% conserved at the nucleotide sequence level from flies to humans, but its expression patterns and developmental functions are not conserved across species. In Drosophila, miR-9a is expressed in epidermal cells in developing embryos and in wing discs, where it ensures the precise specification of sensory organ precursors (SOPs) by downregulating Senseless in non-SOP cells and also affects wing development through dLMO (Li et al., 2006Li Y.

In zebrafish, miR-9 is expressed in the developing brain (e.g., in regions adjacent to the midbrain-hindbrain boundary) and promotes neurogenesis by suppressing Her5 and Her9 (Leucht et al., 2008Leucht C. Stigloher C. Wizenmann A. Klafke R. Folchert A. Bally-Cuif L. MicroRNA-9 directs late organizer activity of the midbrain-hindbrain boundary.Nat. Neurosci. 2008; 11: 641-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In rodents, miR-9 is specifically expressed in the brain and is abundant in neurogenic regions in embryos and adults (Deo et al., 2006Deo M. Yu J.Y. Chung K.H. Tippens M. Turner D.L. Detection of mammalian microRNA expression by in situ hybridization with RNA oligonucleotides.Dev. Dyn. 2006; 235: 2538-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). It has been implicated in embryonic Cajal-Retzius cell differentiation (Shibata et al., 2008Shibata M. Kurokawa D. Nakao H. Ohmura T. Aizawa S.

Posttranscriptional regulation of BK channel splice variant stability by miR-9 underlies neuroadaptation to alcohol.Neuron. 2008; 59: 274-287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), and adult neural progenitor differentiation (Zhao et al., 2009Zhao C. Sun G. Li S. Shi Y. A feedback regulatory loop involving microRNA-9 and nuclear receptor TLX in neural stem cell fate determination.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 365-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar). However, the exact functions of miR-9 in hNPCs are unknown. The mRNA targets of a specific miRNA can shift rapidly through evolution, and there are many more miRNAs in humans than in rodents (Ambros and Chen, 2007Ambros V. Chen X. The regulation of genes and genomes by small RNAs.Development. 2007; 134: 1635-1641Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, Bartel, 2009Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs: Target recognition and regulatory functions.Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14675) Google Scholar). Moreover, miRNAs are potential molecular targets of therapeutic approaches. Thus, it is vital to understand the unique functions and targets of each miRNA in human cells. Here we demonstrate a novel essential role for miR-9 in coordinating the proliferation and migration of hESC-derived hNPCs at their early stage of maturation. We also identify the mRNA encoding stathmin, a protein that increases microtubule instability, as a novel key target of miR-9 to mediate its effects in these biological processes. Moreover, hNPCs without miR-9 showed enhanced migration when transplanted into the embryonic mouse brain or the adult brain of a mouse model of stroke. These studies identify a novel function for miR-9 in hNPCs. To differentiate H9 hESCs into postmitotic neurons, we combined two protocols (Li and Zhang, 2006Li X.-J. Zhang S.C. In vitro differentiation of neural precursors from human embryonic stem cells.Methods Mol. Biol. 2006; 331: 169-177PubMed Google Scholar, Zhang et al., 2001Zhang S.C. Wernig M. Duncan I.D. Brüstle O. Thomson J.A. In vitro differentiation of transplantable neural precursors from human embryonic stem cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 1129-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar) with some modifications. This differentiation process includes neural induction, expansion of homogenous populations of hNPCs, and neuronal maturation (Figure 1A ). Initial multilineage differentiation was induced by forming embryoid bodies (EBs), followed by neural induction and rosette formation in the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and serum-free N2 supplement for 12 days as described (Zhang et al., 2001Zhang S.C. Wernig M. Duncan I.D. Brüstle O. Thomson J.A. In vitro differentiation of transplantable neural precursors from human embryonic stem cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 1129-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). The appearance of elongated cells radially arranged in rosettes is the hallmark of neuroepithelial cells in the neural tube (Elkabetz et al., 2008Elkabetz Y. Panagiotakos G. Al Shamy G. Socci N.D. Tabar V. Studer L. Human ES cell-derived neural rosettes reveal a functionally distinct early neural stem cell stage.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 152-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). Rosette cells were isolated and expanded in suspension cultures for about 1 month to allow neurospheres to enlarge. After exposure to brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), dissociated hNPCs from neurospheres differentiated into mostly postmitotic neurons that are immunopositive for the neuronal marker TUJ1 (Figure S1A available online). In vitro neuronal differentiation of hESCs was monitored from the day cells were placed in suspension culture (0 DIV) to 60 DIV by immunocytochemistry and extensive mRNA expression profiling for neural markers. Relative gene expression analysis by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) showed rapid loss of the pluripotent ESC markers NANOG and OCT4 (Figure 1B). The peak expression of the neural markers SOX2 and PAX6 (Figure 1B) upon rosette formation at 16 DIV indicated targeted differentiation to neural lineages, which was further confirmed by immunostaining for nestin and SOX2 (Figures S1C and S1D). Mechanically isolated rosette cells were then propagated in suspension culture to form neurospheres consisting of hNPCs. At this stage, most if not all the cells in neurospheres were immunopositive for nestin and SOX2 (Figures S1E and S1F), and only a few cells expressed neuronal markers such as TUJ1 (Figure S1G). Terminal differentiation of the expanded progenitors (30–45 DIV) over 2 more weeks yielded a cell population (45–60 DIV) that contained more than 70% TUJ1-positive postmitotic neurons (Figure S1A). Accordingly, qRT-PCR showed a marked increase in the expression level of the neuronal marker MAP2 and no expression of the stem/progenitor cell markers SOX2 and PAX6 in terminally differentiated cells (Figure 1B). We also examined molecular markers (Elkabetz et al., 2008Elkabetz Y. Panagiotakos G. Al Shamy G. Socci N.D. Tabar V. Studer L. Human ES cell-derived neural rosettes reveal a functionally distinct early neural stem cell stage.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 152-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar) that indicate different stages of maturation for hNPCs (Figures S1K–S1N). These analyses confirmed the differentiation of hESCs into hNPCs and postmitotic neurons. Next we examined the expression of several miRNAs during neuronal differentiation of hESCs. miR-367, a marker of pluripotent ESCs (Suh et al., 2004Suh M.R. Lee Y. Kim J.Y. Kim S.K. Moon S.H. Lee J.Y. Cha K.Y. Chung H.M. Yoon H.S. Moon S.Y. et al.Human embryonic stem cells express a unique set of microRNAs.Dev. Biol. 2004; 270: 488-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), was highly expressed in hESCs and EBs, but its expression decreased significantly at later stages (Figure 1C). In contrast, miR-124, a miRNA found at high levels in postmitotic neurons (Lagos-Quintana et al., 2002Lagos-Quintana M. Rauhut R. Yalcin A. Meyer J. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Identification of tissue-specific microRNAs from mouse.Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 735-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2636) Google Scholar), was highly expressed in terminally differentiated human neuronal cultures (Figure 1C). miR-9 expression was turned on at 16–20 DIV during neurosphere formation and increased in hNPCs before terminal differentiation (Figure 1C). In situ hybridization confirmed that miR-9 was not expressed in rosette cells but was highly expressed in neurospheres (Figures 1D–1G). A scrambled probe (negative control) showed mere background staining at both stages (Figures 1H–1K). miR-9 was also expressed in MAP2-positive postmitotic human neurons (Figure 1L) and, at lower levels, in human astrocytes (Figure 1M). Expression of miR-9∗, which is processed from the opposite strand of the miR-9 precursor (pre-miR-9), mirrored that of miR-9 (Figure 1C). Pre-miR-9 is expressed from three chromosomes in humans and rodents. Pre-miR-9-2 expression from chromosome 5 correlated with miR-9 expression at different stages of neural differentiation of hESCs (Figure 1C), while pre-miR-9-1 and pre-miR-9-3 were undetectable in hESC-derived hNPCs (data not shown), suggesting little or no expression. hNPCs undergo extensive proliferation during the early neurosphere stage. The temporally regulated expression of miR-9 in hNPCs at this stage raises the possibility that miR-9 may regulate expansion of the NPC pool. Studying loss-of-function phenotypes is a powerful way to elucidate the normal functions of endogenous miRNAs in particular developmental processes. To this end, we used a locked nucleic acid (LNA) antisense probe to knock down miR-9 activity in the early stage of hNPC maturation, when miR-9 just starts to be expressed. Because this probe shares considerable sequence similarity with miR-9∗, we sought to ensure that the probe did not affect the interaction of miR-9∗ and its targets. We cotransfected HEK293 cells with anti-miR-9 and pre-miR-9-2 with artificial reporter constructs containing miR-9 or miR-9∗ binding sites in the 3′UTR. The anti-miR-9 LNA probe specifically inhibited miR-9 function but did not interfere with the interaction of miR-9∗ with its targets (Figure S2A). Transfecting a high percentage of hNPCs in neurospheres is difficult. The best time for efficient transfection of dissociated neurospheres and to characterize targets of miR-9 in early hNPCs is the transition from rosettes to neurospheres at 16 DIV, shortly before miR-9 expression begins. Rosettes were extracted from surrounding cells with dispase at 16 DIV, mechanically dissociated into 10- to 50-cell aggregates, and divided into three suspension cultures for transfection. At 24 hr after transfection with the anti-miR-9 LNA probe, the level of mature miR-9 in hESC-derived neurospheres was markedly reduced and remained at that low level up to 96 hr after transfection (Figure 2A ). Even 6 days after anti-miR-9 LNA transfection, the level of miR-9 remained low (30%–40%). Thus, all the experiments presented in this study examine the functions of endogenous miR-9 in newly formed hNPCs. Anti-miR-9 did not affect miR-9∗ expression in hNPCs (Figure 2B), indicating the specificity of the knockdown. Neurospheres transfected with anti-miR-9 were morphologically similar to controls. Interestingly, loss of miR-9 activity reduced the size of neurospheres 5 days after the knockdown (Figure 2C); at 120 hr, the mean diameter was 145 ± 7 (n = 163) versus 193 ± 11 μm in controls (n = 134) (p < 0.001) (Figure 2D). To confirm this finding in another established system of neural progenitor differentiation, we used rat primary cortical progenitor cells from E14.5 Sprague-Dawley rats (R&D Systems). miR-9 was expressed in embryonic rat cortical NPCs and differentiating neurons and, to a lesser extent, primary astrocytes, as shown by qRT-PCR (Figure S2B). In contrast, miR-124 was highly expressed in postmitotic neurons derived from rat cortical NPCs (Figure S2C). Thus, rodent miR-9 expression in a rat primary culture system seems to mimic human miR-9 expression in hNPCs and their progeny. Loss of miR-9 also decreased the size of rat neurospheres (data not shown), as in hNPCs. TUNEL analysis, performed to examine cell death, revealed that loss of miR-9 activity did not affect the survival of hNPCs in newly formed neurospheres (Figure 2E). We confirmed this result in embryonic rat NPCs (Figure S2D). Furthermore, a lactate dehydrogenase assay showed no increased cytotoxicity after transfection of hNPCs with anti-miR-9 LNA probes (Figure 2F). Thus, miR-9 does not affect cell survival of NPCs, and the decreased size of human neurospheres after miR-9 knockdown probably does not result from increased apoptotic cell death. To assess the proliferation rates of NPCs with or without miR-9 activity, we performed BrdU labeling experiments on hNPCs and rat cortical NPCs. Cell proliferation was markedly decreased when miR-9 activity was lost (Figure 2G). Cell counting analysis of dissociated embryonic rat cortical NPCs (monolayer culture) at different times after anti-miR-9 transfection showed slower proliferation in the absence of miR-9 (Figure S2E). To further confirm this finding, we used WST-1 cell proliferation reagent (Roche Applied Science), a water-soluble tetrazolium salt whose rate of cleavage by mitochondrial dehydrogenases correlates with the number of viable cells in culture. Knockdown of miR-9 slowed the proliferation of hNPCs (Figure 2H) and of rat cortical NPCs in monolayer culture or in suspension (Figures S2F and S2G). These findings strongly indicate that miR-9 is required to promote the proliferation of early human and embryonic rat NPCs. To exclude the possibility that loss of miR-9 resulted in precocious differentiation of hNPCs, we performed the following experiments. Immunostaining of dissociated human neurospheres showed no effect of loss of miR-9 activity on neuronal differentiation. The cells kept their neural progenitor properties, as shown by expression of the progenitor marker nestin at 7 days after transfection of hNPCs (Figures 3A and 3D ). Again, we used rat cortical NPCs and confirmed that loss of miR-9 activity did not lead to precocious differentiation of rat NPCs as indicated by the unchanged proportion of SOX2-, nestin-, TUJ1-, or GFAP-positive rat cells (Figure S3). In a more detailed analysis of the expression of different molecular markers that are useful for following the sequential events controlling neural progenitor maturation and specification (Elkabetz et al., 2008Elkabetz Y. Panagiotakos G. Al Shamy G. Socci N.D. Tabar V. Studer L. Human ES cell-derived neural rosettes reveal a functionally distinct early neural stem cell stage.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 152-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar), we confirmed that loss of miR-9 did not cause precocious differentiation and showed that it may even slow the maturation of hNPCs (Figure 3J). Three days after transfection of anti-miR-9 LNA probe, the levels of the neural progenitor cell markers PAX6 and SOX2 were increased, while the neurogenic transcription factor MEF2C was decreased in the absence of miR-9. PAX6 and SOX2 were more highly expressed in the pluripotent rosette cells at 16 DIV than in neurospheres (Figure 1B). In contrast, MEF2C expression mimicked miR-9 expression during neuronal differentiation of hESCs (Figure S1N). Thus, these findings suggest that miR-9 loss of function delays progression of hNPCs to a more mature neural progenitor fate, indicating that reduced proliferation in the absence of miR-9 activity is not due to their precocious differentiation. Tight coordination of the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of NPCs is essential for the proper development of the nervous system (Ayala et al., 2007Ayala R. Shu T. Tsai L.H. Trekking across the brain: The journey of neuronal migration.Cell. 2007; 128: 29-43Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) and is equally important in the subventricular zone of the adult brain, where miR-9 is highly expressed (Deo et al., 2006Deo M. Yu J.Y. Chung K.H. Tippens M. Turner D.L. Detection of mammalian microRNA expression by in situ hybridization with RNA oligonucleotides.Dev. Dyn. 2006; 235: 2538-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). After knockdown of miR-9 in embryonic rat cortical NPCs, we noticed that many cells migrated radially out of the neurospheres, mainly in chains, onto the plastic substrate (Figures 4C and 4D ). In contrast, 3 or 6 days after transfection of rat cortical NPCs with scrambled probe, the neurospheres remained largely intact, with many fewer cells migrating (Figures 4A and 4B). We quantified this migration phenotype in two ways. We measured the distance from the neurosphere to the nucleus of the most distant cell at various times after transfection (Figure 4E). Second, we counted the number of cells that migrated (Figure 4F). Quantitative analysis of both parameters from a large number of neurospheres demonstrated an essential role of miR-9 in limiting these cells migrating away from neurospheres (Figures 4E and 4F). Next, we determined whether miR-9 also limits the migration of hESC-derived hNPCs at the early neurosphere stage, when miR-9 expression begins. Because hNPCs are difficult to culture and their migratory behavior has not yet been described, we tested several migration assays and culture conditions. The three-dimensional (3D) Matrigel cell migration assay proved most suitable (Gadea et al., 2007Gadea G. de Toledo M. Anguille C. Roux P. Loss of p53 promotes RhoA-ROCK-dependent cell migration and invasion in 3D matrices.J. Cell Biol. 2007; 178: 23-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence indicates that cellular behavior in a 3D environment reflects more accurately the in vivo situation. Neurospheres newly derived from hESCs were embedded in Matrigel/medium gel (1:1) 3 days after transfection with scrambled control or anti-miR-9, and cell migration was monitored (Figures 4G–4L). Within 2.5 hr, filamentous processes were seen outside neurospheres in which miR-9 activity was inhibited (Figure 4J) but not in controls (Figure 4G). Over the first 24 hr, cells migrated from the neurospheres into the matrix, in chains or as individual cells. Both the number of cells that migrated and the distance from the edge of the neurospheres to the nucleus of the most distant migrating cells were significantly greater at 24 and 48 hr after embedding in Matrigel (Figure 4M), at 4 and 5 days after transfection with anti-miR-9, and at later times (data not shown). To further demonstrate that the migratory phenotype did not reflect precocious differentiation and that the cells maintained their neural progenitor properties, we stained cells for markers of NPCs and differentiated neurons or astrocytes 3 days after plating on Matrigel (6 days after transfection). Almost all migratory cells showed robust staining with the nestin antibody, with very few positive for TUJ1 or GFAP (Figure S4). Thus, migratory cells from the neurospheres at this early maturation stage maintained their neural progenitor properties without miR-9 activity. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 3, loss of miR-9 function in the early-hNPCs delayed their maturation process, which further supports our conclusion that miR-9 promotes proliferation and prevents excessive migration of early stage hNPCs. To examine whether loss of miR-9 activity also affects the migratory behavior of hNPCs in vivo, we transfected neurospheres newly derived from hESCs with scrambled or anti-miR-9 LNA probes and transduced them with GFP-FUGW at 16 DIV. Two days after transfection, individual neurospheres with similar diameters were transplanted into the medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) of brain slices from E14.5 C57Bl/6 mouse embryos (Figure 5A ). Four to five days later, many migrating cells maintained their progenitor identity, as shown by positive immunostaining for the progenitor marker nestin and negative staining for the postmitotic neuronal marker TUJ1 (Figures S5A–S5I). We measured the average of the five longest migrations of individual hNPCs in each brain slice. In the absence of miR-9 activity, more hNPCs migrated out from the neurospheres toward the neocortex and migrated 2.8-fold farther than control neurospheres (350 ± 26 μm [n = 34] versus 124 ± 22 μm [n = 29]) (Figures 5B–5D). Migration of NPCs is important during development of the embryonic nervous system and also for repair after injury in the adult brain. To explore whether miR-9 can modulate the migration of transplanted hNPCs toward an injury site in the adult brain, we transfected hNPCs at 16 DIV with anti-miR-9 or control LNA probes. Neurospheres were dissociated 48 hr later, and hNPCs (3 × 104) were transplanted into the striatum of immunodeficient adult mice 1 week after induction of permanent focal ischemia (Figure 5E), as described (Zhu et al., 2008Zhu W. Fan Y. Frenzel T. Gasmi M. Bartus R.T. Young W.L. Yang G.Y. Chen Y. Insulin growth factor-1 gene transfer enhances neurovascular remodeling and improves long-term stroke outcome in mice.Stroke. 2008; 39: 1254-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Migration was assessed 48 hr after transplantation by immunostaining with an antibody against human mitochondria (hMit) and counting hMit-positive cells in four areas: 0–200, 200–400, 400–600, and >600 μm away from the transplantation site (n = 8 mice per group). Control hNPCs were mostly confined to the bolus with limited radial migration (Figure 5F), but more hNPCs without miR-9 activity migrated toward the ischemic areas (Figures 5G and 5H). For instance, no control hNPCs were found beyond 400 μm. However, anti-miR-9-treated hNPCs were seen in the 400–600 μm area in seven of eight mice transplanted and beyond 600 μm in five (Figure 5H). The migrating hNPCs maintained their neural progenitor properties. For instance, migrating hNPCs labeled with hMit antibody did not express TUJ1 (Figures S5J–S5O). Further analysis revealed that miR-9 knockdown increased"
https://openalex.org/W2163067447,"Cell competition was originally described in Drosophila as a process for selection of the fittest cells. It is likely to play an important role in tissue homeostasis in all metazoans, but little is known about its role and regulation in mammals. By using genetic mosaic mouse models and bone marrow chimeras, we describe here a form of cell competition that selects for the least damaged cells. This competition is controlled by p53 but is distinct from the classical p53-mediated DNA damage response: it persists for months, is specific to the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and depends on the relative rather than absolute level of p53 in competing cells. The competition appears to be mediated by a non-cell-autonomous induction of growth arrest and senescence-related gene expression in outcompeted cells with higher p53 activity. p53-mediated cell competition of this type could potentially contribute to the clonal expansion of incipient cancer cells."

https://openalex.org/W2046432988,"Animals must detect water in their environment to stay alive, but how they do it has remained unclear. Now PPK28, a member of the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel family, has been identified as the water taste receptor in Drosophila melanogaster. Other proteins of this family have been implicated in the detection of mechanical and salt stimuli. Animals must detect water in their environment to stay alive, but the molecular basis for water detection has been unclear. Here the essential mediators of water-sensing and drinking in fruitflies have been identified: an ion channel of the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel family, and the sensory neurons that make it. The detection of water and the regulation of water intake are essential for animals to maintain proper osmotic homeostasis1. Drosophila and other insects have gustatory sensory neurons that mediate the recognition of external water sources2,3,4, but little is known about the underlying molecular mechanism for water taste detection. Here we identify a member of the degenerin/epithelial sodium channel family5, PPK28, as an osmosensitive ion channel that mediates the cellular and behavioural response to water. We use molecular, cellular, calcium imaging and electrophysiological approaches to show that ppk28 is expressed in water-sensing neurons, and that loss of ppk28 abolishes water sensitivity. Moreover, ectopic expression of ppk28 confers water sensitivity to bitter-sensing gustatory neurons in the fly and sensitivity to hypo-osmotic solutions when expressed in heterologous cells. These studies link an osmosensitive ion channel to water taste detection and drinking behaviour, providing the framework for examining the molecular basis for water detection in other animals."

As a result, specific therapies to halt or even reverse fibrosis have not been explored. Here, we evaluated the contribution of epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) to intestinal fibrosis associated with a mouse model of CD and also human inflammatory bowel disease. Mice administered intrarectal 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) develop inflammation and fibrosis that resembles CD both histologically and by immunologic profile. We utilized this model to molecularly probe the contribution of EMT to intestinal fibrosis. Additionally, we utilized double-transgenic VillinCre;R26Rosa-lox-STOP-lox-LacZ mice, in which removal of the STOP cassette by Cre recombinase in villin+ intestinal epithelial cells activates permanent LacZ expression, to lineage trace epithelial cells that might undergo EMT upon TNBS administration. TNBS-induced fibrosis is associated with the presence of a significant number of cells that express both epithelial and mesenchymal markers. In the lineage tagged transgenic mice, the appearance of LacZ+ cells that also express the fibroblast marker FSP1 unequivocally demonstrates EMT. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1, a known inducer of EMT in epithelial cells, induces EMT in rat intestinal epithelial cells in vitro, and bone morphogenic protein-7, an antagonist of TGF-β1, inhibits EMT and fibrosis both in vitro and in the TNBS-treated mice.

The role of EMT in intestinal fibrosis has yet to be investigated.Although organ fibrosis was once considered irreversible, recent data from animal models of renal, hepatic, and cardiac fibrosis demonstrate the anti-fibrotic effect of recombinant human bone morphogenic protein-7 (rhBMP-7) (14Zeisberg M.

BMP-7 is a member of the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily and is one of 15 proteins with structural and functional homology (21Zeisberg M. Nephrol. Dial.

BMP-7 was first recognized for its regulatory effect on bone and cartilage formation and is currently employed clinically to accelerate fracture healing (25Cook S.D. Rueger D.C. Clin. Orthop. Relat.

Surg. Am. 2001; 83-A: S151-S158Google Scholar). With respect to organ fibrosis, the anti-fibrotic effect of rhBMP-7 stems from its ability to counteract the pro-fibrotic action of TGF-β1 (17Zeisberg E.M. Tarnavski O. Zeisberg M. Dorfman A.L. McMullen J.R. Gustafsson E. Chandraker A. Yuan X. Pu W.T. Roberts A.B. Neilson E.G. Sayegh M.H. Izumo S. Kalluri R. Nat.

Physiol. 1997; 273: G769-G775PubMed Google Scholar). Receptors for BMP-7 are present on colonocytes (28Grijelmo C. Rodrigue C. Svrcek M. Bruyneel E. Hendrix A. de Wever O. Gespach C. Cell Signal. 2007; 19: 1722-1732Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and systemically administered rhBMP-7 binds with high affinity to the inflamed colon and prevents inflammation in a rat model of CD induced by rectally administered 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) (29Maric I. Poljak L. Zoricic S. Bobinac D. Bosukonda D. Sampath K.T. Vukicevic S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 196: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The aim of our study was to assess the contribution of EMT to intestinal fibrosis associated with both a mouse model of Crohn colitis and human inflammatory bowel disease as well as to explore the mechanisms underlying the anti-fibrotic properties of rhBMP-7 in the inflamed colon.DISCUSSIONIntestinal fibrosis in the form of fibrostenotic strictures is a well described complication of longstanding CD and is thought to occur as a result of chronic inflammation and dysregulated wound healing (2Fiocchi C. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 182-205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar, 3Froehlich F. Juillerat P. Mottet C. Pittet V. Felley C. Vader J.P. Gonvers J.J. Michetti P. Digestion. 2007; 76: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which inflammation leads to fibrosis is only beginning to be understood but likely involves EMT to some degree (13Kalluri R. Neilson E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1776-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). Although various anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents have demonstrated efficacy for active CD, they have little impact on fibrosis once it occurs (3Froehlich F. Juillerat P. Mottet C. Pittet V. Felley C. Vader J.P. Gonvers J.J. Michetti P. Digestion. 2007; 76: 113-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).EMT is a complex process in which epithelial cells lose their phenotypic and functional characteristics and develop features of the mesenchyme. Specifically, the epithelial cell loses polarity, intercellular adhesion molecules, and membrane-bound transporters to develop a specialized cytoskeleton and invasive capacity (19Kalluri R. Weinberg R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 2009; 119: 1420-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (7127) Google Scholar, 37Hay E.D. Acta Anat. 1995; 154: 8-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar).To provide evidence for EMT involving epithelial cells in intestinal fibrosis, we generated double transgenic mice in which intestinal epithelial cells can be lineage-traced by expression of LacZ. By inducing colitis in the Villin-LacZ mice, we were able to demonstrate for the first time that EMT contributes to the pool of activated fibroblasts that accumulate in a murine model of Crohn colitis generated by treatment with TNBS.Activated fibroblasts are the main mediators of fibrogenesis in the colon as in other organs (38Andoh A. Bamba S. Brittan M. Fujiyama Y. Wright N.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 2007; 114: 94-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 39Powell D.W. Mifflin R.C. Valentich J.D. Crowe S.E. Saada J.I. West A.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C183-C201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fibroblasts are a heterogeneous cell population (6Kalluri R. Zeisberg M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 392-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (3468) Google Scholar) and the major populations that are known to mediate fibrosis express FSP1 or α-SMA (8Strutz F. Zeisberg M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 2992-2998Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). FSP1+ fibroblasts have been well characterized during the fibrogenesis of kidney, liver, and heart (14Zeisberg M. Yang C. Martino M. Duncan M.B. Rieder F. Tanjore H. Kalluri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23337-23347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 16Iwano M. Plieth D. Danoff T.M.

Med. 2007; 13: 952-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (1591) Google Scholar) and often derive from resident epithelia via EMT (18Zeisberg M. Kalluri R. J. Mol. Med. 2004; 82: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In our model of colitis, the numbers of both FSP1+ and α-SMA+ fibroblasts increase upon disease induction. The effect of treatment with TNBS is more dramatic on the population of fibroblasts expressing FSP1. Thus, we used this marker for our subsequent experiments.Our experiments suggest that approximately one-third of FSP1+ fibroblasts are derived from intestinal epithelial cells. This result is consistent with our studies of EMT in mouse models of renal (∼35%) (40Zeisberg M. Shah A.A. Kalluri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 8094-8100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and liver (∼45%) (14Zeisberg M. Yang C. Martino M. Duncan M.B. Rieder F. Tanjore H. Kalluri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23337-23347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) fibrosis but may actually be an underestimate because the LacZ transgene is only active in 80% of the cells. Although E-cadherin FSP1 double labeling is insufficient to detect epithelial cells that have fully acquired a fibroblast phenotype, and lost expression of epithelial cell markers, these data further support the idea that EMT occurs in the model of TNBS-induced intestinal fibrosis.To explore the anti-fibrotic effects of rhBMP-7 in this model of CD, a subset of mice receiving TNBS enemas were concomitantly treated with rhBMP-7. As we and others have previously shown, BMP-7 exerts its anti-fibrotic action in the setting of chronic disease of the kidney, liver, and heart at least partially via inhibition of EMT (14Zeisberg M. Yang C. Martino M. Duncan M.B. Rieder F. Tanjore H. Kalluri R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23337-23347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar, 17Zeisberg E.M. Tarnavski O.

Med. 2003; 9: 964-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1170) Google Scholar). Therefore we speculated that enterocytes could contribute to the pool of FSP1+ fibroblasts in the setting of intestinal fibrosis and that inhibition of EMT by rhBMP-7 would inhibit fibrosis. Administration of rhBMP-7 in conjunction with TNBS prevented the epithelial injury and fibrosis seen in the mice treated with TNBS.Previous studies have demonstrated that the TNBS-induced model of Crohn colitis is associated with substantially increased BMP receptor expression (29Maric I. Poljak L. Zoricic S. Bobinac D. Bosukonda D. Sampath K.T. Vukicevic S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 196: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) This finding suggests that administration of rhBMP-7 exerts its anti-fibrotic action via utilization of a pre-existing repair pathway in which colonocytes play a pivotal role (29Maric I. Poljak L. Zoricic S. Bobinac D. Bosukonda D. Sampath K.T. Vukicevic S. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 196: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Our studies do not exclude the possibility that other BMPs are equally effective to prevent intestinal fibrosis. In this regard, BMP-1, BMP-2, BMP-4, and BMP-5 have been found to be expressed in the colon in addition to BMP-7 (41Wang Y. Wang L. Iordanov H. Swietlicki E.A. Zheng Q. Jiang S. Tang Y. Levin M.S. Rubin D.C. J. Clin. Invest. 2006; 116: 1535-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 42Kosinski C. Li V.S. Chan A.S. Zhang J. Ho C. Tsui W.Y. Chan T.L. Mifflin R.C. Powell D.W. Yuen S.T.

U.S.A. 2007; 104: 15418-15423Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar).Anti-TNF-α therapy is associated with a loss of inhibitory effect of TNF-α on TGF-β1 signaling (43Nadkarni S. Mauri C. Ehrenstein M.R. J. Exp. Med. 2007; 204: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). In this regard, our studies demonstrate that TGF-β1 is a potent inducer of EMT and that BMP-7 significantly inhibits TGF-β1-induced EMT even while inhibiting TNF-α. Additional studies are needed to explore possible synergistic effects of the combination of anti-TNF-α therapy and rhBMP-7 in the effective suppression of inflammation and fibrosis in CD. Although controversial, there is some evidence that treatment with infliximab, an anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody, may enhance stricture formation in some patients (44Lichtenstein G.R. Olson A. Travers S. Diamond R.H. Chen D.M. Pritchard M.L. Feagan B.G. Cohen R.D. Salzberg B.A. Hanauer S.B. Sandborn W.J. Am. J.

In these patients, dual treatment may be safer and more efficacious.TGF-β1 is regarded as a principal mediator of intestinal fibrosis (4Rieder F. Brenmoehl J. Leeb S. Schölmerich J. Rogler G. Gut. 2007; 56: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), and it is the most potent inducer of EMT in various organ systems (13Kalluri R. Neilson E.G. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 112: 1776-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2061) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested the capacity of TGF-β1 to induce EMT in adult rat intestinal epithelial cells. The findings in vivo were confirmed in the IEC-6 cell line.Although repeated treatment with TNBS leads to a TH1 T cell inflammatory process that resembles CD both in histopathology and immunology (46Wirtz S. Neufert C. Weigmann B. Neurath M.F. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar, 47Neurath M. Fuss I. Strober W. Int. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 19: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 48Scheiffele F. Fuss I.J. Curr. Protocols Immunol. 2002; (Chapter 15, Units 15–19)PubMed Google Scholar), the role of EMT in human inflammatory bowel disease remains virtually unexplored. A recent paper demonstrated a potential role for EMT in fistulas from a small cohort of patients with CD (36Bataille F. Rohrmeier C. Bates R. Weber A. Rieder F. Brenmoehl J. Strauch U. Farkas S. Fürst A. Hofstädter F. Schölmerich J. Herfarth H. Rogler G. Inflamm. Bowel. Dis. 2008; 14: 1514-1527Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Our finding of colocalized E-cadherin and α-SMA in intestinal resection specimens from patients with active inflammatory bowel disease suggests that EMT likely occurs in human intestinal fibrosis as well. The pooling of samples from patients with CD and ulcerative colitis clearly limits the scope of our interpretation of these human data. Nevertheless, our data support a role for EMT in active human inflammatory bowel disease. Whether the findings are unique to CD or merely a result of active inflammation associated with any number of colitides remains to be established. Analysis of additional samples collected in a prospective and nonpooled manner will be necessary to further characterize this process as it applies to human intestinal fibrosis in general and CD in particular.Our study demonstrates a clear role for EMT in the development of TNBS-induced intestinal fibrosis. As has been demonstrated in the kidney and heart, treatment with rhBMP-7 both in vivo and in vitro prevents EMT associated with interstitial fibrosis. This finding suggests that rhBMP-7 may be an important future therapy for intestinal fibrosis in general and CD in particular.

Over one-third of patients with CD undergo surgery to relieve obstruction related to fibrotic strictures, and many will require repeat interventions because of recurrent disease (3Froehlich F.

https://openalex.org/W2052860512,"Matthew Hurles and colleagues report the sequencing of breakpoints for over 300 CNVs detected in genomes of three individuals, using targeted hybridization-based DNA capture and 454-sequencing. Precisely characterizing the breakpoints of copy number variants (CNVs) is crucial for assessing their functional impact. However, fewer than 10% of known germline CNVs have been mapped to the single-nucleotide level. We characterized the sequence breakpoints from a dataset of all CNVs detected in three unrelated individuals in previous array-based CNV discovery experiments. We used targeted hybridization-based DNA capture and 454 sequencing to sequence 324 CNV breakpoints, including 315 deletions. We observed two major breakpoint signatures: 70% of the deletion breakpoints have 1−30 bp of microhomology, whereas 33% of deletion breakpoints contain 1−367 bp of inserted sequence. The co-occurrence of microhomology and inserted sequence is low (10%), suggesting that there are at least two different mutational mechanisms. Approximately 5% of the breakpoints represent more complex rearrangements, including local microinversions, suggesting a replication-based strand switching mechanism. Despite a rich literature on DNA repair processes, reconstruction of the molecular events generating each of these mutations is not yet possible."
https://openalex.org/W2069790849,"The signal recognition particle (SRP) mediates targeting of nascent proteins to the plasma membrane in prokaryotes and the endoplasmic reticulum in eukaryotes. Secretory and membrane proteins contain a signal peptide at their N-termini, which is recognized by the SRP as it emerges from the ribosome. A universally conserved component of the SRP, known as SRP54, or its bacterial homologue Ffh, binds to the diverse range of signal peptides. In this study Janda et al. present the crystal structure of SRP54 and a signal peptide from Sulfolobus solfataricus, which reveals the mode of signal peptide recognition. Nascent secretory or membrane proteins contain an amino-terminal signal peptide that mediates their targeting to the plasma membrane (in prokaryotes) or endoplasmic reticulum (in eukaryotes). This peptide is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP). A universally conserved component of the SRP is known as SRP54 (Ffh in bacteria). Here, the crystal structure of Sulfolobus solfataricus SRP54 fused to a signal peptide is presented, revealing how the signal peptide is recognized by SRP54. Targeting of proteins to appropriate subcellular compartments is a crucial process in all living cells. Secretory and membrane proteins usually contain an amino-terminal signal peptide, which is recognized by the signal recognition particle (SRP) when nascent polypeptide chains emerge from the ribosome. The SRP–ribosome nascent chain complex is then targeted through its GTP-dependent interaction with SRP receptor to the protein-conducting channel on endoplasmic reticulum membrane in eukaryotes or plasma membrane in bacteria. A universally conserved component of SRP (refs 1, 2), SRP54 or its bacterial homologue, fifty-four homologue (Ffh), binds the signal peptides, which have a highly divergent sequence divisible into a positively charged n-region, an h-region commonly containing 8–20 hydrophobic residues and a polar c-region3,4,5. No structure has been reported that exemplifies SRP54 binding of any signal sequence. Here we have produced a fusion protein between Sulfolobus solfataricus SRP54 (Ffh) and a signal peptide connected via a flexible linker. This fusion protein oligomerizes in solution through interaction between the SRP54 and signal peptide moieties belonging to different chains, and it is functional, as demonstrated by its ability to bind SRP RNA and SRP receptor FtsY. We present the crystal structure at 3.5 Å resolution of an SRP54–signal peptide complex in the dimer, which reveals how a signal sequence is recognized by SRP54."
https://openalex.org/W2091821324,"The small GTPase Rab7 promotes fusion events between late endosomes and lysosomes. Rab7 activity is regulated by extrinsic signals, most likely via effects on its guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) or GTPase-activating protein (GAP). Based on their homology to the yeast proteins that regulate the Ypt7 GTP binding state, TBC1D15, and mammalian Vps39 (mVps39) have been suggested to function as the Rab7 GAP and GEF, respectively. We developed an effector pull-down assay to test this model. TBC1D15 functioned as a Rab7 GAP in cells, reducing Rab7 binding to its effector protein RILP, fragmenting the lysosome, and conferring resistance to growth factor withdrawal-induced cell death. In a cellular context, TBC1D15 GAP activity was selective for Rab7. TBC1D15 overexpression did not inhibit transferrin internalization or recycling, Rab7-independent processes that require Rab4, Rab5, and Rab11 activation. TBC1D15 was thus renamed Rab7-GAP. Contrary to expectations for a Rab7 GEF, mVps39 induced lysosomal clustering without increasing Rab7 GTP binding. Moreover, a dominant-negative mVps39 mutant fragmented the lysosome and promoted growth factor independence without decreasing Rab7-GTP levels. These findings suggest that a protein other than mVps39 serves as the Rab7 GEF. In summary, although only TBC1D15/Rab7-GAP altered Rab7-GTP levels, both Rab7-GAP and mVps39 regulate lysosomal morphology and play a role in maintaining growth factor dependence.

Because membrane fusion is frequently studied using purified yeast vacuoles, much is known about the molecules that regulate Ypt7, the Rab7 ortholog in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (17Haas A.

Gyp7 is the Ypt7 GAP, blocking vacuole fusion by promoting GTP hydrolysis by Ypt7 (20Vollmer P. Will E. Scheglmann D. Strom M. Gallwitz D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 284-290Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 21Eitzen G. Will E. Gallwitz D. Haas A. Wickner W.

Cell Biol. 2008; 182: 1141-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The GEF for Ypt7 may be Vps39. Vps39 facilitates nucleotide exchange on Ypt7 in vitro (23Wurmser A.E. Sato T.K. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 551-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). However, in other studies, Vps39 preferentially bound the GTP-bound form of Ypt7 suggesting that Vps39 may be a Ypt7 effector (24Price A. Seals D. Wickner W. Ungermann C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1231-1238Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 25Seals D.F. Eitzen G. Margolis N. Wickner W.T. Price A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 9402-9407Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Consistent with a model where Vps39 is a Ypt7 effector rather than a GEF, Gyp7 addition causes the release of Vps39 from vacuolar membranes in vitro suggesting that GTP hydrolysis releases Vps39 from Ypt7 (21Eitzen G. Will E. Gallwitz D. Haas A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6713-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). No other candidate Ypt7 GEF has been identified. Regardless of whether Vps39 functions as a GEF, an effector, or fills another role, Vps39 clearly promotes vacuolar fusion. Yeast null for Vps39 exhibit severe vacuolar fragmentation (26Seeley E.S.

In addition, vacuoles lacking Vps39 or exposed to Vps39 antibodies are deficient for fusion in vitro (29Price A. Wickner W. Ungermann C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1223-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). In vitro vacuole fusion is separated into four steps termed priming, tethering, docking, and fusion (reviewed in Ref. 30Ostrowicz C.W. Meiringer C.T. Ungermann C. Autophagy. 2008; 4: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). During the priming phase, cis-SNARE complexes are disassembled, rendering them competent to assemble into the trans-complexes that form during the docking stage and eventually drive membrane fusion. Both a large, hexameric Vps39-containing complex and Ypt7 are required for docking (29Price A. Wickner W. Ungermann C. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1223-1229Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 31Mayer A. Wickner W. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 307-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). The protein complex containing Vps39, Vps41, and the homotypic fusion and vacuole protein sorting (HOPS) complex (Vps11, 16, 18, and 33) may function as a Ypt7 effector in yeast, linking Rab7-GTP to the trans-SNARE pairing that completes the docking stage. After docking, membrane fusion can proceed in the absence of Ypt7 (21Eitzen G. Will E. Gallwitz D. Haas A. Wickner W. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6713-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Whereas lysosomal fusion has been studied in mammalian cells, much less is known about how Rab7 activity is regulated. Multiple Rab GAPs contain a TBC (Tre2/Bub2/Cdc16) domain (32Ishibashi K.

Purified TBC1D15 accelerates GTP hydrolysis by Rab7 in vitro (39Zhang X.M. Walsh B. Mitchell C.A. Rowe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, GAPs are often promiscuous in vitro while exhibiting much more restricted activity in cells (40Pfeffer S. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 856-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). The apparent homolog of yeast Vps39, mammalian Vps39 (mVps39), interacts with mammalian homologs of Vps41 and the HOPS complex (41Richardson S.C. Winistorfer S.C. Poupon V. Luzio J.P. Piper R.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1197-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). mVps39 clearly has an important role in lysosomal trafficking, but its mechanism of action is not completely understood. mVps39 overexpression promotes the centripetal movement of late endosomes/lysosomes in mammalian cells similar to what is seen in cells expressing constitutively active Rab7 (42Caplan S. Hartnell L.M. Aguilar R.C. Naslavsky N. Bonifacino J.S. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 109-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 43Poupon V. Stewart A. Gray S.R. Piper R.C. Luzio J.P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 4015-4027Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). mVps39 also promotes the exchange of Rab5 for Rab7 on endosomes (44Rink J. Ghigo E. Kalaidzidis Y. Zerial M. Cell. 2005; 122: 735-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). These results are consistent with mVps39 functioning as a Rab7 effector, a Rab7 GEF, or performing a function that is independent of Rab7 GTP binding state. Interestingly, the best studied Rab7 effector, RILP, has no yeast homolog. RILP binds selectively to Rab7-GTP and recruits the dynein-dynactin motor complex to facilitate vesicle movement toward the minus end of microtubules (13Cantalupo G. Alifano P. Roberti V. Bruni C.B. Bucci C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 15Jordens I. Fernandez-Borja M. Marsman M. Dusseljee S. Janssen L. Calafat J. Janssen H. Wubbolts R. Neefjes J. Curr.

Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 6494-6506Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). The N terminus of RILP is required to recruit dynein motors, but not to bind GTP Rab7, and thus an N-terminal truncation of RILP functions as a dominant-negative mutant (13Cantalupo G. Alifano P. Roberti V. Bruni C.B. Bucci C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 15Jordens I. Fernandez-Borja M. Marsman M. Dusseljee S. Janssen L. Calafat J. Janssen H.

DN-RILP locks Rab7 in its GTP-bound state despite the fact that it inhibits Rab7-dependent fusion reactions (15Jordens I. Fernandez-Borja M. Marsman M. Dusseljee S. Janssen L. Calafat J. Janssen H. Wubbolts R. Neefjes J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1680-1685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). How mVps39 or TBC1D15 affect the ability of Rab7 to bind its effector RILP has not been previously investigated. To test whether TBC1D15 and mVps39 function as the Rab7 GAP and GEF, respectively, we developed an effector pull-down assay using the Rab7 binding domain of RILP. As a biological correlate, the effects of these proteins on lysosomal morphology and growth factor dependence were monitored in the murine hematopoetic cell line, FL5.12. FL5.12 cells are immortalized, but not transformed and depend upon IL-3 for growth, proliferation, and survival (46Nuñez G. London L. Hockenbery D. Alexander M. McKearn J.P. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 3602-3610PubMed Google Scholar, 47Karnauskas R. Niu Q. Talapatra S. Plas D.R. Greene M.E. Crispino J.D. Rudin C.M.

Cancer. 2005; 114: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). FL5.12 cells and other IL-3 dependent hematopoetic cell lines are often used to investigate the consequences of growth factor withdrawal because artifacts due to the withdrawal of nutrients, vitamins, and poorly defined factors present in serum are eliminated. These cells are also useful because of their distinctive lysosomal morphology. FL5.12 cells contain only 3–5 lysosomes per cell, more closely resembling the vacuolar architecture of yeast than the dispersed lysosomal staining pattern typical of many adherent mammalian cell lines. We report here that TBC1D15 was a selective Rab7 GAP in a cellular context while mVps39 did not affect Rab7-GTP binding state as would be expected for a Rab7 GEF. Both mVps39 and TBC1D15 modulated lysosomal morphology and played a previously unrecognized role as regulators of growth factor dependence. Rab7 antibody (clone Rab7-117) was obtained from Sigma. Human Lamp1 antibody (clone eBioH4A3) was obtained from eBioscience. The Myc antibody (clone 9B11) was obtained from Cell Signaling. The eGFP antibody (clone JL-8) was obtained from Clontech. Secondary antibodies were obtained from LI-COR Biosciences. Complete protease inhibitors were from Roche Diagnostics. BCA reagents used for protein assays were from Pierce Chemical Co. Murine TBC1D15 was amplified by PCR from pSport1 IMAGE clone 30054233 and an N-terminal Myc tag added.

Human GFP-DN-RILP and GFP-RILP were generously provided by Cecilia Bucci (Università del Salento, Lecce, Italy). To generate an mVps39 expression construct, RNA was isolated from FL5.12 cells using a Qiagen RNAeasy kit. The mVps39 cDNA was generated using a Superscript III RT-PCR kit with Platinum Taq (Invitrogen) and TA cloned into the EF6/V5-His vector (Invitrogen). An N-terminal Myc tag was added during RT-PCR. Sequencing of the entire insert identified four mutations in mVps39; this construct was renamed mVps39mut. Wild-type mVps39 was kindly provided by Dr. Robert Piper (University of Iowa) and cloned into pBABEpuro.

All plasmids were sequence confirmed. FL5.12 cells were maintained at low density in RPMI (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% FCS (Mediatech, Hyclone, or Sigma), 500 pm recombinant mouse IL-3 (BD Pharmingen or eBioscience), 10 mm HEPES (Mediatech), 55 μm β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma), antibiotics, and l-glutamine (Mediatech). Cell lines expressing transgenes were used in experiments within 5 days of thawing. Extracellular nutrient limitation was performed in RPMI made from chemical components that contained 10% dialyzed FCS (Invitrogen) in place of standard serum. Hela and 293T cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Mediatech) supplemented with 10% FCS. Transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nucleotides 658–897 of GenBankTM accession number NM001029938 (amino acids 220–299) of the murine RILP protein constituting the Rab7 binding domain of RILP were fused to the C terminus of GST in the pGEX 4T-3 vector (Stratagene). GST-RILP was transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21. 250 ml of LB was inoculated with 1 ml of an overnight culture and grown at 37 °C to an OD of 0.6 to 0.8. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (EMD) was then added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm to induce protein production. The 250-ml culture was incubated for additional 3–4 h at 30 °C, after which the bacteria were spun down, washed with cold PBS, resuspended in 5 ml of cold lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1 m NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, with Complete protease inhibitors), then sonicated. The bacterial lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and 5 ml of cold lysis buffer was added. Proteins were purified by adding 300 μl of a pre-equilibrated 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (GE Healthcare) to the lysate. Beads were incubated with lysates for 30 min. at room temperature then washed with lysis buffer, resuspended as a 50% slurry, and protein levels quantified using the BCA Assay. Mammalian cells to be analyzed in the pull-down were lysed in pull-down buffer (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors). Each pull-down was performed in 1 ml with 300 μg of cell lysate and 30 μg of beads pre-equilibrated in pull-down buffer. Beads were rocked overnight at 4 °C, washed twice with cold pull-down buffer, and bound proteins eluted by adding 2× NuPAGE sample buffer (Invitrogen) and incubating at 72 °C for 10 min. Cells were analyzed on a Becton Dickinson LSR II flow cytometer. Viability was determined by vital dye exclusion (propidium iodide or DAPI, Invitrogen). To evaluate lysosomal morphology, cells were stained with 500 nm Lysotracker Red (Invitrogen) for 30 min. at 37 °C and examined using a Nikon Eclipse TE2000 fluorescence microscope equipped with a Coolsnap CCD camera. Quantitation of the number of lysosomes was performed manually using the tagging function available in ImagePro software. To evaluate Lamp1 clustering, transfected Hela cells growing on coverslips were fixed and permeabilized in IF block (PBS with 10% FCS, 2% paraformaldehyde, 0.3% saponin, and 0.05% sodium azide) for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice in IF wash (PBS with 0.03% saponin) before and after staining with antibodies. FL5.12 cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in serum-free medium with 1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h then washed with ice-cold PBS before labeling on ice with 100 μg/ml biotinylated transferrin (Invitrogen) in serum-free medium with 1% BSA. Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS to remove unbound transferrin and incubated at 37 °C in complete medium with 20% FCS. At the indicated time points, cells were washed in ice-cold PBS with 2% fetal bovine serum and 0.05% sodium azide, fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde (on ice for 30 min. followed by 10 min at room temperature), stained with streptavidin-APC (eBioscience), and analyzed on a BD LSRII flow cytometer. For transferrin recycling assays, cells were labeled with biotinylated transferrin at 37 °C for 1 h before transfer to complete medium containing 20% FCS and permeabilized with saponin during fixation. Where indicated, Rab5 and Rab11 mutant plasmids were introduced by electroporation. TBC1D15 can function as a GAP for Rab7 in vitro (39Zhang X.M. Walsh B. Mitchell C.A. Rowe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, GAPs are often promiscuous in vitro while displaying selective activity in a cellular context. To test whether TBC1D15 serves as a Rab7 GAP in cells, we developed an effector pull-down assay in which the Rab7-binding domain of its effector protein RILP (49Wu J. Tolstykh T. Lee J. Boyd K. Stock J.B. Broach J.R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 5672-5681Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) was fused to GST and used to selectively isolate Rab7-GTP from cell lysates. Pull-down assays on cells expressing Rab7 mutants that are predominantly GDP- (Rab7-T22N) or GTP-bound (Rab7-Q67L) confirmed that Rab7-GTP was selectively isolated by GST-RILP (Fig. 1, A and B) (2Feng Y. Press B. Wandinger-Ness A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 1435-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar, 13Cantalupo G. Alifano P. Roberti V. Bruni C.B. Bucci C.

Biol. 2001; 11: 1680-1685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). To further validate this assay, we evaluated Rab7-GTP binding status in cells expressing mutant or wild-type RILP. In keeping with published results (13Cantalupo G. Alifano P. Roberti V. Bruni C.B. Bucci C. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 15Jordens I. Fernandez-Borja M. Marsman M. Dusseljee S. Janssen L. Calafat J. Janssen H. Wubbolts R. Neefjes J. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 1680-1685Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), both DN-RILP and wild-type RILP increased Rab7-GTP levels (Fig. 1, C and D). The SifA protein from Salmonella enterica interferes with RILP recruitment to the Salmonella containing vacuole, possibly by serving as a competitive inhibitor (45Harrison R.E. Bucci C. Vieira O.V. Schroer T.A. Grinstein S. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 6494-6506Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Unlike DN-RILP, SifA does not alter the Rab7 GTPase cycle (50Marsman M. Jordens I. Kuijl C. Janssen L. Neefjes J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 2954-2964Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). As expected, no change in Rab7-GTP levels was observed in cells expressing SifA (Fig. 1, C and D). These experiments demonstrate that the effector pull-down assay has the dynamic range to detect both reductions and elevations in Rab7-GTP binding. Consistent with the ability of TBC1D15 to function as a Rab7 GAP in vitro (39Zhang X.M. Walsh B. Mitchell C.A. Rowe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), the fraction of Rab7 bound to GTP was reduced in cells expressing TBC1D15 (Fig. 1, C and D). As a functional correlate, we tested whether TBC1D15 overexpression altered lysosomal morphology. TBC1D15 expression led to lysosomal fragmentation (Fig. 2, A and B). The degree of fragmentation was similar to that observed upon expression of the dominant-negative mutant Rab7-T22N. Fragmentation induced by TBC1D15 was not reversed by expression of Rab7-Q67L, possibly because high enough levels of the activated mutant were not achieved. In addition to fragmenting the lysosome, inactivating Rab7 decreases cellular sensitivity to growth factor withdrawal-induced apoptosis (4Edinger A.L. Cinalli R.M. Thompson C.B. Dev. Cell. 2003; 5: 571-582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Cells stably overexpressing TBC1D15 were also protected from growth factor withdrawal-induced death (Fig. 2C). Together, these results are consistent with a role for TBC1D15 as a Rab7 GAP. TBC1D15 can function as a Rab11 GAP in vitro (39Zhang X.M. Walsh B. Mitchell C.A. Rowe T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 335: 154-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and an association between TBC1D15 and Rab5 was detected in yeast two-hybrid assays (51Itoh T. Satoh M. Kanno E. Fukuda M. Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 1023-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To determine whether TBC1D15 might also serve as a GAP for these Rabs, we measured transferrin endocytosis and recycling in cells overexpressing TBC1D15. Transferrin internalization depends on the function of both Rab4 and Rab5 while Rab4 and Rab11 promote transferrin recycling (3Vitelli R. Santillo M. Lattero D. Chiariello M. Bifulco M. Bruni C.B.

U.S.A. 1998; 95: 6187-6192Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Both transferrin internalization and recycling are, on the other hand, independent of Rab7 (3Vitelli R. Santillo M. Lattero D.

To measure transferrin internalization, biotinylated transferrin was bound to FL5.12 cells on ice and its disappearance from the cell surface after warming cells to 37 °C followed using flow cytometry. Despite the fact that lysosomes were severely fragmented, transferrin was internalized at the same rate in TBC1D15 over-expressing and control cells (Fig. 3A). Transferrin internalization was delayed, however, in cells expressing dominant-negative Rab5-S34N. For recycling assays, FL5.12 cells were maintained in media containing biotinylated transferrin for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed, placed in media containing excess unlabeled transferrin, and the clearance of biotinylated transferrin from cells as a result of recycling measured over time. While a GDP-locked mutant of Rab11 reduced the rate of transferrin recycling, cells overexpressing TBC1D15 recycled transferrin with kinetics that were indistinguishable from controls (Fig. 3B). These experiments indicate that in intact cells, TBC1D15 functions as a GAP for Rab7, but not Rab4, 5, or 11. We have therefore renamed TBC1D15 Rab7-GAP. Yeast Vps39 mutants possess a fragmented va"
https://openalex.org/W2030205508,"APOBEC3G (hA3G) is a host inhibitor for human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1). However, HIV-1 Vif binds hA3G and induces its degradation. We have established a screening system to discover inhibitors that protect hA3G from Vif-mediated degradation. Through screening, compounds IMB-26 and IMB-35 were identified to be specific inhibitors for the degradation of hA3G by Vif. The inhibitors suppressed HIV-1 replication in hA3G-containing cells but not in those without hA3G. The anti-HIV effect correlated with the endogenous hA3G level. HIV-1 particles from hA3G(+) cells treated with IMB-26/35 contained a hA3G level higher than that from those without IMB-26/35 treatment and showed decreased infectivity. IMB-26/35 bound directly to the hA3G protein, suppressed Vif/hA3G interaction, and therefore protected hA3G from Vif-mediated degradation. The compounds were safe with an anti-HIV therapeutic index >200 in vitro. LD(50) of IMB-26 in mice was >1000 mg/kg (intraperitoneally). Therefore, IMB-26 and IMB-35 are novel anti-HIV leads working through specific stabilization of hA3G."
https://openalex.org/W2054015330,"Cyclophilin A (CypA) is a ubiquitous cis-trans prolyl isomerase with key roles in immunity and viral infection. CypA suppresses T-cell activation through cyclosporine complexation and is required for effective HIV-1 replication in host cells. We show that CypA is acetylated in diverse human cell lines and use a synthetically evolved acetyllysyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA(CUA) pair to produce recombinant acetylated CypA in Escherichia coli. We determined atomic-resolution structures of acetylated CypA and its complexes with cyclosporine and HIV-1 capsid. Acetylation markedly inhibited CypA catalysis of cis to trans isomerization and stabilized cis rather than trans forms of the HIV-1 capsid. Furthermore, CypA acetylation antagonized the immunosuppressive effects of cyclosporine by inhibiting the sequential steps of cyclosporine binding and calcineurin inhibition. Our results reveal that acetylation regulates key functions of CypA in immunity and viral infection and provide a general set of mechanisms by which acetylation modulates interactions to regulate cell function."
https://openalex.org/W2057090515,"The lineage restriction of prospectively isolated hematopoietic progenitors has been traditionally assessed by bulk in vitro culture and transplantation of large number of cells in vivo. These methods, however, cannot distinguish between homogenous multipotent or heterogeneous lineage-restricted populations. Using clonal assays of 1 or 5 cells in vitro, single-cell quantitative gene expression analyses, and transplantation of mice with low numbers of cells, we show that a common myeloid progenitor (CMP) is Sca-1(lo)lin(-)c-Kit(+)CD27(+)Flk-2(-) (SL-CMP; Sca-1(lo) CMP) and a granulocyte/macrophage progenitor (GMP) is Sca-1(lo)lin(-)c-Kit(+)CD27(+)Flk-2(+)CD150(-/lo) (SL-GMP; Sca-1(lo) GMP). We found that mast cell progenitor potential is present in the SL-CMP fraction, but not in the more differentiated SL-GMP population, and is more closely related to megakaryocyte/erythrocyte specification. Our data provide criteria for the prospective isolation of SL-CMP and SL-GMP and support the conclusion that mast cells are specified during hematopoiesis earlier than and independently from granulocytes."

Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 5634-5638Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Mechanistically, a key role for PKD1 in controlling the activity of the ubiquitous F-actin depolymerizing- and severing factor cofilin via slingshot1L (SSH1L) cofilin phosphatase has been demonstrated. The activity of SSH1L is mainly regulated by its binding to filamentous actin (F-actin), which has been shown to strongly enhance its activity (5Yamamoto M. Nagata-Ohashi K. Ohta Y. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1789-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 6Kurita S. Watanabe Y. Gunji E. Ohashi K. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 32542-32552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of SSH1L at Ser978 by active PKD1, e.g. downstream of RhoA or oxidative stress, generates a 14-3-3 binding motif within an important F-actin binding region, thus resulting in the sequestration of SSH1L away from dynamic actin structures, reducing SSH1 activity and active non-S3-phosphorylated cofilin levels (2Eiseler T. Döppler H. Yan I.K. Kitatani K. Mizuno K. Storz P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). By severing actin filaments, cofilin increases both the availability of G-actin monomers as well as the number of “barbed ends” for polymerization (7DesMarais V. Macaluso F. Condeelis J. Bailly M. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 3499-3510Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Furthermore, severed filaments are the preferred substrate for dendritic nucleation by the Arp complex (8DesMarais V. Ichetovkin I. Condeelis J. Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4649-4660Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 9DesMarais V. Ghosh M. Eddy R. Condeelis J. J.

Localized induction of actin polymerization and the formation of branched actin networks constitute the basis for membrane protrusion and cell motility (2Eiseler T. Döppler H. Yan I.K. Kitatani K.

In line with an upstream regulatory role in the control of these processes, PKD1 and -2 are also capable of binding to F-actin in vitro (1Eiseler T. Schmid M.A. Topbas F. Pfizenmaier K. Hausser A. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 4279-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In the case of PKD1, in vivo F-actin binding has been demonstrated as well, which most likely facilitates an interaction with actin regulatory proteins such as SSH1L (2Eiseler T. Döppler H. Yan I.K. Kitatani K. Mizuno K. Storz P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). We now have identified a second key regulatory signaling pathway of PKD controlling the WAVE2-Arp2/3-complex-driven de novo actin polymerization and lamellipodia extension via the actin-regulatory protein cortactin. Cortactin is an actin-binding protein enriched in lamellipodia of motile cells and at dynamic actin structures such as membrane ruffles (12Weed S.A. Karginov A.V. Schafer D.A. Weaver A.M. Kinley A.W. Cooper J.A. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar), circular dorsal ruffles (13Boyle S.N. Michaud G.A. Schweitzer B. Predki P.F. Koleske A.J. Curr.

Cancer Lett. 2008; 265: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Cortactin was further shown to co-localize with proteins of the Arp2/3 complex at sites of actin polymerization within lamellipodia (12Weed S.A. Karginov A.V. Schafer D.A. Weaver A.M. Kinley A.W. Cooper J.A. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 29-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). It synergistically accelerates Arp complex-mediated actin polymerization (15Weaver A.M.

For microscopy, in the case of Panc89 cell lines, cells were seeded on coverslips coated with CollagenIV (Sigma), whereas MCF-7 cells were seeded on uncoated slips in sterile dishes (Barloworld Scientific) at 80,000 cells/coverslip. Time-lapse live imaging of MCF-7 cells was performed in 4-chamber Cellview glass-bottom dishes (Greiner Bio-one).

FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 4279-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 18Hausser A. Link G. Hoene M. Russo C. Selchow O. Pfizenmaier K. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3613-3621Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 10 min. Pulldown assays were performed by incubation of protein lysates with 10 μg of GST 14-3-3β-coupled to glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with lysis buffer. For immunoprecipitation equal amounts of proteins were incubated with specific antibodies for 1.5 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected with protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) and washed three times with lysis buffer. Precipitated proteins were released by boiling in sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Pall, Germany). Proteins were visualized with alkaline phosphatase-coupled secondary antibodies using nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as substrate or horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies using ECL. In vitro kinase assays were performed by incubating equal amounts of FLAG-M2 (Sigma) affinity purified cortactin and cortactin-S298A as substrate with ∼250 ng of purified PKD1 from Baculo-infected insect cells or purified His-tagged PKD1KD (kindly provided by A. Toker, Harvard). Kinase reactions were performed for 15 min at 37 °C in 30 μl of kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) containing 2 μCi of [α-32P]ATP. To terminate the reaction, 10 μl of 5× SDS sample buffer were added. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE, blotted onto nitrocellulose, and analyzed on a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Quantification was done with ImageQuant software (GE Healthcare). High-speed F-actin binding assays were essentially performed as described (1Eiseler T. Schmid M.A. Topbas F. Pfizenmaier K. Hausser A. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 4279-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). FLAG-M2 affinity purification of cortactin and cortactin-S298A was performed from five 10-cm culture dishes. M2 affinity purification was performed with 100 μl of M2-agarose (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's description. Bound FLAG-cortactin was eluded after extensive washing steps with 3× 200 μl of 100 mm glycine (pH 3.5) in reaction tubes containing 1.5 m Tris (pH 8.8) to buffer the eluate. FLAG-cortactin/FLAG-cortactin-S298A concentrations were subsequently assessed by Bradford assay and purity was tested by SDS-PAGE. High-speed binding assays were done by incubating 2 μg/0.5 μg of cortactin and cortactin-S298A with 10 μg of in vitro polymerized F-actin (AKL99, Cytoskeleton Inc.) for 30 min at room temperature in F-buffer (10 mm imidazole, pH 7.2, 75 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm EGTA supplemented with Complete protease inhibitor (EDTA free) and PhosStop (Roche Applied Science)). Assays were subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at room temperature. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was incubated for 1 h in G-buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 mm ATP) to depolymerize F-actin. Equal amounts of supernatant and pellet fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining or Western blot. Integrated density of bands was quantified using NIH ImageJ. Pyrene-actin polymerization assays with purified proteins were performed as follows. Pyrene-labeled rabbit muscle G-actin (Cytoskeleton Inc.) was diluted to 3 μm in G-buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 mm fresh ATP). In vitro polymerization assays were performed in black 96-well plates (Greiner Bio-one) in a volume of 100 μl. Triplicate wells per reaction condition were assayed: G-buffer; pyrene-actin; pyrene-actin, 50 nm Arp complex (Cytoskeleton Inc.); and pyrene-actin, 50 nm Arp, 400 nm GST-VCA (Cytoskeleton Inc.), as well as pyrene-actin, 50 nm Arp, 400 nm GST-VCA, and 1000 nm FLAG-purified cortactin or cortactin-S298A. Polymerization reactions were started immediately prior to measurement by the addition of 10 μl of 10× F-buffer (Cytoskeleton Inc.). The increase in pyrene fluorescence following polymerization was measured with a Tecan M200 plate reader: excitation, 360 nm, emission, 407 nm every 30 s. To quantify changes in polymerization rate, curves were fitted with Boltzmann sigmoidal equations (GraphPad, Prism). Half-maximal saturated polymerization values (T½max (s)) and % saturation of individual polymerization reactions were calculated from RAW data. Migration assays were performed using 8-μm pore diameter 24-well Transwell filter inserts (Corning). Panc89 cells were seeded at a density of 60,000 cells/insert. Migration was induced by a serum gradient of 10% fetal calf serum for 40 h. The inside of the Transwell insert was wiped with a cotton swab to remove non-migrated cells. Migrated cells were fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and visualized using a wide field fluorescence microscope (Leica) equipped with a CCD camera, and a monochromator light source at ×10 magnification. Results were calculated as the average number of migrated cells/visual field with at least 6 images per filter. 3 μm seed-free G-actin was polymerized in the presence of an equimolar amount Alexa 488-phalloidin in G-buffer to stabilize filaments. Reaction conditions were: 50 nm Arp complex (Cytoskeleton Inc.), 400 nm GST-VCA (Cytoskeleton Inc.), and 1000 nm FLAG-purified cortactin or cortactin-S298A. Polymerization reactions were started by the addition of ×10 F-buffer (Cytoskeleton Inc.). Reactions were terminated after 10 min by the addition of formaldehyde to a final concentration of 4% for 15 min. Samples were quenched with glycine and mounted as 1:10 dilution in Fluoromount G. Filaments were visualized at ×100 magnification by a Leica wide field fluorescence microscope using 510/30 filters. To enhance filament detection, 5 images each (cortactin/cortactin-S298A) were brightness and contrast enhanced, SPE-processed, segmented, and subjected to automatic detection by a 20-infinity filter (NIH ImageJ) after highly branched filaments with >2 branches were singled out manually and excluded from automatic detection. Quantified was the ratio of the total number of filaments (5 images)/filaments with branches >2 and % of branched filaments. Panc89 and MCF-7 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min, washed, quenched with 0.1 m glycine, and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Samples were blocked and stained in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 0.05% Tween 20. Primary as well as secondary Alexa dye antibodies (Invitrogen) were incubated for 2 h. Samples were mounted after extensive washing in Fluoromount G (Southern Biotechnology, AL) and analyzed by a Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (TCS SP2, Leica, Germany) or a LSM 710 (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with the respective ×63 Plan Apo oil immersion objectives. GFP or Alexa 488 were excited with the 488-nm line and fluorescence was detected at 500–535 nm. Alexa 546 and Cy5 or Alexa 633 were excited with the 543 (Leica), 561 (Zeiss), and 633 nm line for Cy5/Alexa 633, respectively. Dyes were detected at 550–620 and 640–720 nm. Images were acquired in sequential scan mode and processed using NIH ImageJ. Acceptor-photobleach FRET experiments were performed with MCF-7 cells stimulated with Heregulin. In brief, MCF-7 cells seeded on coverslips were transfected, serum-starved overnight, and stimulated with 100 ng/ml of Heregulin for 10 min. Samples were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and subjected to immunohistochemistry. FRET measurements were performed by acquiring a time-bleach image series using a LSM 710 confocal laser scanning microscope (Zeiss) equipped with a ×63 Plan Apo oil immersion objective. In experiments with Arp3-Alexa 546 as FRET acceptor, fluorescence of the acceptor was bleached using an intensive 561-nm laser line. For 3-dye “daisy chain” acceptor-photobleach-FRET experiments with WAVE2-GFP as the primary FRET donor, FLAG-cortactin stained with α-FLAG M2-Alexa 633 secondary antibody as the final FRET-acceptor, and F-actin (phalloidin-Alexa 546) as the FRET signal “transducer,” the final acceptor cortactin-FLAG-Alexa 633 was bleached with the 633 laser line. %FRET images were generated with ZEN Software (LSM 710 confocal microscope, Zeiss) using images immediately before and after the bleach. The Bezier bleach ROI and rectangle threshold ROI used to eliminate “off target-bleached pixels” are shown in figures. For the 3-dye daisy chain FRET experiments, RAW data and RAW %FRET values were also calculated by the mean of ROI analysis using ZEN Software. Low level GFP-G-actin expression can be used to measure actin polymerization in vivo (19Lorenz M. DesMarais V. Macaluso F. Singer R.H. Condeelis J. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2004; 57: 207-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We therefore used YFP-G-actin co-transfection to visualize actin polymerization and extension of lamellipodia in MCF-7 cells. For these experiments cells were seeded at a density of 80,000 cells/well in 4-chamber Cellview glass-bottom dishes. Cells were transfected at a ratio of 3:1 with FLAG-vector/FLAG-cortactin/FLAG-cortactin-S298A:YFP-G-actin to visualize polymerization, serum-starved overnight, and stimulated at T120 s after initiation of image acquisition with 100 ng/ml of Heregulin. Time-lapse videos of stimulated cells were generated by acquiring images of YFP fluorescence (excitation YFP, 500/20; emission, YFP, 535/30) every 10 s for 20 min at ×63 magnification with a Leica wide field fluorescence video microscope setup for live cell imaging with a 37 °C heating chamber as well as CO2 supply. Subsequently kymographs were generated with NIH ImageJ plug-ins by plotting the edge of the protruding lamellipodia visualized by YFP-G-actin against time (pixel/10 s) along a 1-pixel line perpendicular to the protrusion front for initially individual protrusions of 6 cells per construct (already showing statistical significance). The protrusion velocity (pixel/min) was calculated from kymographs during the linear phase of extension indicated by white lines in the kymogrames with a respective time difference of 1 min. Using the spatial calibration of images velocity was also calculated as [μm/min]. In line with literature (16Bryce N.S. Clark E.S. Leysath J.L. Currie J.D. Webb D.J. Weaver A.M. Curr. Biol. 2005; 15: 1276-1285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), vector controls displayed reduced protrusion persistence when compared with cortactin and cortactin-S298A cells that did not allow for the same quantification and statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism Software algorithms. Using Panc89 cells derived from pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma we have investigated the role of cortactin and the potential upstream regulatory function of PKD in the control of pancreatic cancer cell motility. Autophosphorylated endogenous PKD colocalized with F-actin at the edge of lamellipodia (Fig. 1, A–C) as well as with cortactin at lamellipodia, in membrane ruffles and at microspikes within the protrusion (Fig. 1, D–F). Autophosphorylated PKD also co-localized with Arp3 at the edge of lamellipodia and in ruffle zones (Fig. 1, G–I), pointing to a putative role of PKD together with cortactin in the Arp complex-mediated actin remodeling. We next used Panc89 cells stably expressing GFP-tagged wild type PKD1 and kinase-inactive PKD1KD (1Eiseler T. Schmid M.A. Topbas F. Pfizenmaier K. Hausser A. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 4279-4287Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) to identify a potential function of PKD and cortactin in the Arp complex-mediated de novo actin polymerization as well as directed cell migration. As demonstrated for endogenous PKD, ectopically expressed PKD1-GFP showed enhanced co-localization with endogenous cortactin and F-actin at membrane ruffles of lamellipodia-like protrusions (Fig. 2A, panels A–J) in these cells. Moreover, both PKD1- and PKD1KD-GFP could be co-precipitated with endogenous cortactin (Fig. 2B). Reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation of ectopically expressed PKD1-GFP and FLAG-cortactin in HEK293T cells confirmed the specificity of this interaction (Fig. 2C). Because PKD and cortactin show overlapping subcellular localization and interaction in Panc89 as well as HEK293T cells, we were prompted to investigate whether cortactin is a direct substrate of PKD and whether respective phosphorylation sites are situated in important structural domains of the protein. Fig. 3A depicts a structural overview of cortactin. The N-terminal region of cortactin harbors an acidic motif (NTA) with DDW consensus sequences, which have been shown to mediate binding of cortactin to Arp3, a member of the 7-protein Arp complex (20Amann K.J. Pollard T.D. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 306-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Cortactin also possesses an extended region of 6½ so-called HS-1 repeats containing dedicated sequence motifs for F-actin interaction. The C-terminal part of the protein harbors a helical domain (H), a proline-rich stretch of amino acids, and an SH3-binding motif (21Daly R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) for recruitment of co-regulatory proteins such as WIP or WISH (21Daly R.J. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 13-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 22Takenawa T. Miki H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1801-1809Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following sequence analysis for PKD consensus phosphorylation motifs, we decided to focus our investigation on Ser298 as a potentially important PKD phosphorylation site with the consensus LAKHES* located in the 6th F-actin binding repeat. As shown in Fig. 3A, the cortactin consensus does not fully match the published PKD consensus sequence because there is no arginine at the −2/3 position (23Hausser A. Storz P. Link G. Stoll H. Liu Y.C. Altman A. Pfizenmaier K. Johannes F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9258-9264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, positively charged histidine and lysine residues at the −2/3 position might be able to compensate for the arginine. Recently, in vivo phosphorylation of this site by PKD has been published, however, neither the biological significance nor mechanistic consequences of this phosphorylation have been addressed in this study (24De Kimpe L. Janssens K. Derua R. Armacki M. Goicoechea S. Otey C. Waelkens E. Vandoninck S. Vandenheede J.R. Seufferlein T. Van Lint J. Cell Signal. 2009; 21: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We thus opted to investigate the biological relevance of this site because it has been demonstrated for a number of F-actin-binding proteins that phosphorylation alters the F-actin binding capacity impacting its specific function (2Eiseler T. Döppler H. Yan I.K. Kitatani K. Mizuno K. Storz P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 5Yamamoto M. Nagata-Ohashi K. Ohta Y. Ohashi K. Mizuno K.

Cell Biol. 2005; 171: 349-359Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of respective consensus sites in some instances also generates 14-3-3 protein binding motifs impacting protein function and biological readouts (2Eiseler T. Döppler H. Yan I.K. Kitatani K. Mizuno K. Storz P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2009; 11: 545-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 18Hausser A. Link G. Hoene M. Russo C. Selchow O. Pfizenmaier K. J.

Using purified PKD1 and FLAG affinity purified cortactin/cortactin-S298A proteins isolated from HEK293T cells, we show here that PKD1 phosphorylates Ser298 in cortactin in vitro (supplemental Fig. S1A). We, furthermore, demonstrate a PKD-dependent in vivo phosphorylation at this site using a site-specific pS298 antibody (24De Kimpe L. Janssens K. Derua R. Armacki M. Goicoechea S. Otey C. Waelkens E. Vandoninck S. Vandenheede J.R. Seufferlein T. Van Lint J. Cell Signal. 2009; 21: 253-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) following PKD knockdown, both for ectopically expressed FLAG-cortactin (Fig. 3B) as well as endogenous cortactin (Fig. 3D). Additional co-expression experiments with FLAG-cortactin, FLAG-cortactin-S298A, and active (CA)/kinase-inactive (KD) PKD1 constructs also support in vivo phosphorylation of this site (supplemental Fig. 1B). To assess, whether phosphorylation of Ser298 in cortactin generates a 14-3-3 binding motif, we performed pulldown assays with GST-14-3-3β-coated beads from HEK293T total cell lysates expressing FLAG-tagged cortactin as well as the cortactin-S298A mutant (Fig. 3C). The S298A muta"
https://openalex.org/W2050913250,"Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a skeletal disorder primarily caused by mutations in the type I collagen genes. However, recent investigations have revealed that mutations in the genes encoding for cartilage-associated protein (CRTAP) or prolyl 3-hydroxylase 1 (P3H1) can cause a severe, recessive form of OI. These reports show minimal 3-hydroxylation of key proline residues in type I collagen as a result of CRTAP or P3H1 deficiency and demonstrate the importance of P3H1 and CRTAP to bone structure and development. P3H1 and CRTAP have previously been shown to form a stable complex with cyclophilin B, and P3H1 was shown to catalyze the 3-hydroxylation of specific proline residues in procollagen I in vitro. Here we describe a mouse model in which the P3H1 gene has been inactivated. Our data demonstrate abnormalities in collagen fibril ultrastructure in tendons from P3H1 null mice by electron microscopy. Differences are also seen in skin architecture, as well as in developing limbs by histology. Additionally bone mass and strength were significantly lower in the P3H1 mice as compared with wild-type littermates. Altogether these investigations demonstrate disturbances of collagen fiber architecture in tissues rich in fibrillar collagen, including bone, tendon, and skin. This model system presents a good opportunity to study the underlying mechanisms of recessive OI and to better understand its effects in humans."
https://openalex.org/W2062855335,"Adenovirus is an important respiratory pathogen. Adenovirus fiber from most serotypes co-opts the Coxsackie-Adenovirus Receptor (CAR) to bind and enter cells. However, CAR is a cell adhesion molecule localized on the basolateral membrane of polarized epithelia. Separation from the lumen of the airways by tight junctions renders airway epithelia resistant to inhaled adenovirus infection. Although a role for CAR in viral spread and egress has been established, the mechanism of initial respiratory infection remains controversial. CAR exists in several protein isoforms including two transmembrane isoforms that differ only at the carboxy-terminus (CAR(Ex7) and CAR(Ex8)). We found low-level expression of the CAR(Ex8) isoform in well-differentiated human airway epithelia. Surprisingly, in contrast to CAR(Ex7), CAR(Ex8) localizes to the apical membrane of epithelia where it augments adenovirus infection. Interestingly, despite sharing a similar class of PDZ-binding domain with CAR(Ex7), CAR(Ex8) differentially interacts with PICK1, PSD-95, and MAGI-1b. MAGI-1b appears to stoichiometrically regulate the degradation of CAR(Ex8) providing a potential mechanism for the apical localization of CAR(Ex8) in airway epithelial. In summary, apical localization of CAR(Ex8) may be responsible for initiation of respiratory adenoviral infections and this localization appears to be regulated by interactions with PDZ-domain containing proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2074114272,"Both hemojuvelin (HJV) and bone morphogenic protein-6 (BMP6) are essential for hepcidin expression. Hepcidin is the key peptide hormone in iron homeostasis, and is secreted predominantly by hepatocytes. HJV expression is detected in hepatocytes, as well as in skeletal and heart muscle. HJV binds BMP6 and increases hepcidin expression presumably by acting as a BMP co-receptor. We characterized the role of hepatocyte HJV in the regulation of BMP6 and hepcidin expression. In HJV-null (Hjv−/−) mice that have severe iron overload and marked suppression of hepcidin expression, we detected 4-fold higher hepatic BMP6 mRNA than in wild-type counterparts. These results indicate that Hjv−/− mice do not lack BMP6. Furthermore, iron depletion in Hjv−/− mice decreased hepatic BMP6 mRNA. Expression of HJV in hepatocytes of Hjv−/− mice using an AAV2/8 vector, increased hepatic hepcidin mRNA by 65-fold and phosphorylated Smad1/5/8 in the liver by about 2.5-fold. However, no significant change in BMP6 mRNA was detected in either the liver or the small intestine of these animals. Our results revealed a close correlation of hepatic BMP6 mRNA expression with hepatic iron-loading. Together, our data indicate that the regulation of hepatic BMP6 expression by iron is independent of HJV, and that expression of HJV in hepatocytes plays an essential role in hepcidin expression by potentiating the BMP6-mediated signaling.

Modification of the donor reveals a new mode of allosteric inhibition in which a bulky substituent prevents conformational changes and thus enzyme activation. Glycosyltransferases are carbohydrate-active enzymes with essential roles in numerous important biological processes. We have developed a new donor analog for galactosyltransferases that locks a representative target enzyme in a catalytically inactive conformation, thus almost completely abolishing sugar transfer. Results with other galactosyltransferases suggest that this unique mode of glycosyltransferase inhibition may also be generally applicable to other members of this important enzyme family."
https://openalex.org/W2044614329,"In the voltage-sensing phosphatase Ci-VSP, a voltage-sensing domain (VSD) controls a lipid phosphatase domain (PD). The mechanism by which the domains are allosterically coupled is not well understood. Using an in vivo assay, we found that the interdomain linker that connects the VSD to the PD is essential for coupling the full-length protein. Biochemical assays showed that the linker is also needed for activity in the isolated PD. We also identified a late step of VSD motion in the full-length protein that depends on the linker. Notably, we found that this VSD motion requires PI(4,5)P2, a substrate of Ci-VSP. These results suggest that the voltage-driven motion of the VSD turns the enzyme on by rearranging the linker into an activated conformation, and that this activated conformation is stabilized by PI(4,5)P2. We propose that Ci-VSP activity is self-limited because its decrease of PI(4,5)P2 levels decouples the VSD from the enzyme."

Bcl-xL is a major anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein required for RPE cell survival, and phosphorylation of Bcl-xL at residue Ser-62 renders this protein pro-apoptotic. In this study, we identify serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) as a key regulator of Bcl-xL phosphorylation at residue Ser-62 in ARPE-19 cells, a spontaneously arising RPE cell line in which Bcl-xL is highly expressed. We found that either PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid or depletion of catalytic subunit α of PP2A (PP2A/Cα) by small interfering RNA enhanced Bcl-xL phosphorylation when activated with hydrogen peroxide and tumor necrosis factor α-induced oxidative stress. Disruption of PP2A/Cα exacerbated oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. PP2A/Cα colocalized and interacted with S62Bcl-xL in cells stressed with H2O2/tumor necrosis factor α. By contrast, the omega-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid derivative, neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1), a potent activator of survival signaling, down-regulated oxidative stress-induced phosphorylation of Bcl-xL by increasing protein phosphatase activity. NPD1 also attenuated the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis by knockdown of PP2A/Cα and increased the association of PP2A/Cα with S62Bcl-xL as well as total Bcl-xL. NPD1 also enhanced the heterodimerization of Bcl-xL with its counterpart, pro-apoptotic protein Bax.

Our laboratory has shown that RPE cells, when induced with oxidative stress, produce and release to the media a stereospecific oxygenation product of docosahexaenoic acid, named neuroprotectin D1 (NPD1) (3Mukherjee P.K.

Hence, NPD1 is a pleiotropic modulator of inflammation resolution (7Serhan C.N. Yacoubian S. Yang R. Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2008; 3: 279-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). NPD1 up-regulates anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL) and down-regulates pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, Bad) in ARPE-19 cells upon exposure to hydrogen peroxide/tumor necrosis factor α (H2O2/TNFα)-induced oxidative stress (3Mukherjee P.K.

Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL protect cells from apoptosis, whereas Bax and Bad promote apoptosis (15Kim R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 336-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 16Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar). Bcl-xL regulates apoptosis by undergoing post-translational modifications, which include phosphorylation and heterodimerization with pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax and Bad), and by subcellularly localizing in the mitochondria (17Basu A.

Bcl-xL is phosphorylated at residue (Ser-62) through c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) in cancer cell lines in response to anti-mitotic drugs (17Basu A. Haldar S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 538: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 20Schmitt E. Beauchemin M. Bertrand R. Oncogene. 2007; 26: 5851-5865Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 21Basu A.

Moreover, Bcl-xL phosphorylation is a universal response to microtubule damage. However, the involvement of a physiological protein phosphatase in the dephosphorylation of Bcl-xL, as well as mediators that modulate Ser-62 removal, remains unclear.Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), a serine/threonine protein phosphatase, has been implicated in the dephosphorylation of Bcl-2 family proteins (23Tamura Y. Simizu S. Osada H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 24Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol.

The A- and B-subunits are ubiquitously expressed and evolutionarily conserved. The B-subunit defines the specific PP2A substrate target and its cellular localization (26Parsons R. Curr. Opin. Oncol. 1998; 10: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The B-subunit targets the catalytic complex (A- and C-subunits) to intracellular sites such as microtubules, the nucleus, and the cytoplasm (27McCright B. Rivers A.M. Audlin S. Virshup D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22081-22089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 28Sontag E. Nunbhakdi-Craig V. Bloom G.S. Mumby M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1131-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). PP2A has been shown to be the major phosphatase involved in the dephosphorylation of Bad (25Chiang C.W. Harris G. Ellig C. Masters S.C. Subramanian R. Shenolikar S. Wadzinski B.E. Yang E. Blood. 2001; 97: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), leading to apoptosis. Moreover, the catalytic subunit of PP2A alone is sufficient to dephosphorylate Bcl-2 (29Deng X. Gao F. May W.S. Blood. 2009; 113: 422-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and Bax, triggering cell death (30Xin M. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18859-18867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar).Although the involvement of PP2A in the regulation of Bcl-xL protein expression is known (31Boon-Unge K.

Fernandez-Luna J.L. Leukemia. 1997; 11: 940-944Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), knowledge of protein phosphatases that dephosphorylates Bcl-xL is scarce, particularly in response to apoptotic stimuli (33Cook S.A.

Chem. 2003; 278: 25542-25547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, given the potent bioactivity of NPD1 on the Bcl-2 family proteins (3Mukherjee P.K. Marcheselli V.L. Serhan C.N. Bazan N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 8491-8496Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 4Mukherjee P.K. Marcheselli V.L. Barreiro S. Hu J. Bok D. Bazan N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13152-13157Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) during oxidative stress, it seems that NPD1 is key in ARPE-19 cell survival. The present study was undertaken to examine the effect of NPD1 in modulating the phosphorylation of Bcl-xL and to identify the specific species of protein phosphatase involved during induced oxidative stress in ARPE-19 cells.DISCUSSIONBcl-xL is a pro-survival member of the Bcl-2 family of proteins that inhibits cell death induced by a number of apoptotic stimuli (40Grillot D.A. González-García M. Ekhterae D. Duan L. Inohara N. Ohta S. Seldin M.F. Nuñez G. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4750-4757PubMed Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 family members each share homology within the BH1–BH4 regions. Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL contains all four homology regions, Bax lacks the BH4 domain, and Bad lacks all three domains except the BH3 death domain (41Zhou H. Hou Q. Chai Y. Hsu Y.T. Exp. Cell Res. 2005; 309: 316-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Bcl-xL is a close homolog of Bcl-2 and is proposed to exert its anti-apoptotic activity in a similar manner. In healthy cells, Bcl-xL is localized primarily to the mitochondria with a smaller fraction residing in the cytosol (36Hsu Y.T. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 3668-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 42Thuduppathy G.R. Craig J.W. Kholodenko V. Schon A. Hill R.B. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 359: 1045-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), and in some cells such as murine thymocytes, it is also localized in the nucleus (18Sedlak T.W. Oltvai Z.N. Yang E. Wang K. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 7834-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (782) Google Scholar). One of the pro-survival functions of Bcl-xL is the inhibition of pro-apoptotic Bax (16Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar). Bax is found in both the cytosol and the mitochondria in many culture cells (36Hsu Y.T. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 3668-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 38Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Upon induction of apoptosis, Bcl-xL and Bax are predominantly membrane-associated (36Hsu Y.T. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 3668-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). Moreover, phosphorylated forms of the Bcl-2 family proteins Bad and Bax are localized exclusively in the cytosol (29Deng X. Gao F. May W.S. Blood. 2009; 113: 422-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 30Xin M. Deng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 18859-18867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). In a spinal cord injury model (43Cittelly D.M. Nesic-Taylor O. Perez-Polo J.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 85: 1894-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), Bcl-xL was shown to be present in the endoplasmic reticulum, nuclei, and cytosol, whereas phosphorylated S62Bcl-xL was absent from the cytosolic fraction in uninjured spinal cord. As early as 15 min after contusion, an up-regulation of the phospho-Bcl-xL in the cytosol was observed. In PC-12 cells treated with vinblastine, there was a correlation between the cytoplasmic S62Bcl-xL levels and apoptosis, suggesting that Bcl-xL phosphorylation is pro-apoptotic (17Basu A. Haldar S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 538: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 43Cittelly D.M. Nesic-Taylor O. Perez-Polo J.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 2007; 85: 1894-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In support of this, subcellular fractionation studies in ARPE-19 cells revealed that S62Bcl-xL was not localized in mitochondrial fractions or in the unstimulated cytosolic fractions. After induction of oxidative stress, S62Bcl-xL was detected as early as 15 min in the cytosol and gradually increased thereafter up to 60 min (Fig. 4). The overall protein level of Bcl-xL remained unchanged in the mitochondria, consistent with previous studies (36Hsu Y.T. Wolter K.G. Youle R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1997; 94: 3668-3672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar). In unstimulated cells, Bax was localized in the cytosol, and a smaller fraction was localized in the mitochondria, and upon induction of oxidative stress, a smaller fraction was translocated to the mitochondria at 30 min (Fig. 4).Apoptosis-promoting agents, including H2O2/TNFα, calcium ionophore, A-23187, and IL-1β, can induce the synthesis of NPD1 via the action of a 15-lipoxygenase-1 enzyme (15-LOX-1) (3Mukherjee P.K. Marcheselli V.L. Serhan C.N. Bazan N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 8491-8496Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar, 44Calandria J.M. Marcheselli V.L. Mukherjee P.K. Uddin J. Winkler J.W. Petasis N.A. Bazan N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 17877-17882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). However, our understanding of the signaling mechanism(s) by which NPD1 promotes cell survival remains fragmentary. Because NPD1 counteracts oxidative stress-induced apoptosis and also up-regulates the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL in ARPE-19 cells (3Mukherjee P.K. Marcheselli V.L. Serhan C.N. Bazan N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 8491-8496Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), it was proposed that NPD1 may act at the transcriptional, translational, and post-translational level to regulate the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-xL. In a previous report, it had been shown that after 1 h of serum starvation and 6 h of 400 and 800 μm H2O2/TNFα induction, total Bcl-xL protein was down-regulated, and 50 nm NPD1 up-regulated this protein (4Mukherjee P.K. Marcheselli V.L. Barreiro S. Hu J. Bok D. Bazan N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13152-13157Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 5Mukherjee P.K. Marcheselli V.L. de Rivero Vaccari J.C. Gordon W.C. Jackson F.E. Bazan N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13158-13163Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The activated (phosphorylated) form of this protein has until now not been studied. We report here that 200 μm H2O2/TNFα induced the phosphorylation of Bcl-xL in ARPE-19 cells after 18 h of serum starvation and that NPD1 down-regulated the same (Fig. 1, A and B). We further demonstrate that NPD1 was not able to down-regulate the phosphorylation of Bcl-xL at higher concentrations, such as 400 and 600 μm H2O2 (Fig. 1B). It has also been demonstrated that reactive oxygen species can influence the phosphorylation of Bcl-2 family proteins. An appropriate amount of reactive oxygen species, usually a small amount, activates phosphokinases and increases the intracellular calcium levels (45Rothstein E.C. Byron K.L. Reed R.E. Fliegel L. Lucchesi P.A. Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2002; 283: H598-H605Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 46Benhar M. Dalyot I. Engelberg D. Levitzki A. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 21: 6913-6926Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). However, a large amount induces peroxidation of DNA, proteins, and lipids, resulting in cell impairments (47Covacci V. Torsello A. Palozza P. Sgambato A. Romano G. Boninsegna A. Cittadini A. Wolf F.I. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2001; 14: 1492-1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 48Dröge W. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 47-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (7355) Google Scholar). Hence, higher concentrations of H2O2/TNFα may increase reactive oxygen species levels in ARPE-19 cells, which might decrease the potency of NPD1. Therefore, the effect observed in Fig. 1B might be a concentration- and time-dependent phenomenon. Taken together, our data suggest that Bcl-xL phosphorylation is an early event (>5 min) with a significant up-regulation from 30 to 90 min under the present experimental conditions. After 60 min, the phosphorylation status was reversed to that observed at 30 min (Fig. 1A). These observations are consistent with phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events occurring much earlier than the appearance of apoptotic features. We cannot rule out the possibility that a much higher concentration of NPD1 might be effective with an increased concentration of H2O2, resulting in a more rapid activation of Bcl-xL.Other studies also demonstrate Bcl-xL phosphorylation at Ser-62 through activation of JNK, thereby inactivating its anti-apoptotic activity (17Basu A. Haldar S. FEBS Lett. 2003; 538: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 21Basu A. Haldar S. Int. J. Oncol. 2008; 33: 657-663PubMed Google Scholar, 22Upreti M. Galitovskaya E.N. Chu R. Tackett A.J. Terrano D.T. Granell S. Chambers T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 35517-35525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrated JNK-mediated activation of S62Bcl-xL in our model system (data not shown) as well. It is possible that dephosphorylation of Bcl-xL mediated by a protein phosphatase may also play a role in regulating its anti-apoptotic activity. Our results further suggest that PP2A is able to function as a Bcl-xL phosphatase because specific disruption of PP2A activity by treatment of ARPE-19 cells with okadaic acid enhanced Bcl-xL phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). Furthermore PP2A expression was observed in the cytosol, consistent with the absence of S62Bcl-xL. In oxidative stress-induced cells, a down-regulation in the expression pattern of PP2A/C was observed as a function of time, correlating with increased phosphorylation of Bcl-xL (Fig. 4). PP2A/C also was found to be localized in the mitochondria of control cells, and oxidative stress enhanced the translocation. Importantly, two homologous proteins that noncompetitively inhibit the phosphatase activity of PP2A, I1PP2A and I2PP2A (49Li M. Makkinje A. Damuni Z. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6998-7002Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 50Kovacech B. Kontsekova E. Zilka N. Novak P. Skrabana R. Filipcik P. Iqbal K. Novak M. FEBS Lett. 2007; 581: 617-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), were not found to be altered in abundance between control or stressed ARPE-19 cells when compared with actin levels in the same sample. These observations are consistent with previous studies demonstrating that C2-ceramide, an activator of PP2A, mediates dephosphorylation of the Bcl-xL homolog Bcl-2 by translocating PP2A to the mitochondria (23Tamura Y. Simizu S. Osada H. FEBS Lett. 2004; 569: 249-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 24Ruvolo P.P. Deng X. Ito T. Carr B.K. May W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20296-20300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Confirmation of PP2A as a Bcl-xL phosphatase was obtained from the results of transfection studies that demonstrated specific knockdown of PP2A/Cα expression by siRNA-increased Bcl-xL phosphorylation (Fig. 2C), which promoted apoptotic cell death (Fig. 3C). In contrast, NPD1 attenuated PP2A/C-mediated cell death (Fig. 3C). Moreover, NPD1 enhanced the interaction between S62Bcl-xL and PP2A/Cα in H2O2/TNFα-induced ARPE-19 cells (Fig. 5B), supporting the notion that NPD1-stimulated Bcl-xL/Bax interaction (Fig. 5A) is associated with the increased availability of total Bcl-xL, presumably on the mitochondrial membrane. It is possible that these interactions disable the pro-apoptotic protein Bax from forming oligomers, thus inhibiting the formation of ion channels on the mitochondria and thus releasing cytochrome c into the cytosol.It has been also demonstrated that PP2A, specifically PP2A/C, can dephosphorylate the Bcl-xL homolog Bcl-2 by directly binding to its BH4 domain (29Deng X. Gao F. May W.S. Blood. 2009; 113: 422-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Pro-survival Bcl-2 family members possess a conserved BH4 domain, and deletion of this domain presumably converts Bcl-2 to a multidomain Bax-like death effector (51Cheng E.H. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K. Hardwick J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar, 52Reed J.C. Zha H. Aime-Sempe C. Takayama S. Wang H.G. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 406: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar), suggesting that the BH4 domain is critical for anti-apoptotic activity. Taken together, we propose that the BH4 domain of Bcl-xL might function as the PP2A “docking site” and a potential bridge for PP2A to access the Ser-62 phosphorylation site located in the loop region adjacent to the N-terminal BH4 domain. This mechanism may contribute to removal of the phosphate of Bcl-xL, leading to inhibition of its pro-apoptotic function.In related studies, the sphingolipid ceramide, which exerts its effect at the subcellular site of production, has been shown to stimulate PP2A activity by binding to the catalytic domain of PP2A (24Ruvolo P.P.

We demonstrate that the omega-3 fatty acid derivative, NPD1, increases PP2A activity (Fig. 3A) and also that NPD1 synthesis is a near universal response to oxidative stress because of its ability to inactivate apoptotic signaling at the mitochondrial level (3Mukherjee P.K.

Bazan N.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007; 104: 13152-13157Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The present study shows that NPD1 can induce dephosphorylation of Bcl-xL in a PP2A-dependent manner and promote ARPE-19 cell survival. Our results also indicate that NPD1 facilitation of PP2A interaction with S62Bcl-xL (Fig. 5B) might increase the dephosphorylation of Bcl-xL and promote Bax/Bcl-xL heterodimerization (Fig. 5A). That NPD1 may facilitate a direct Bax/Bcl-xL interaction through additional regulatory mechanisms can, at this time, not be excluded.Our findings and the demonstration of the involvement of the BH4 domain (a feature inherent only with the anti-apoptotic proteins) in PP2A docking (29Deng X. Gao F. May W.S. Blood. 2009; 113: 422-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) indicate a novel mechanism for NPD1-induced cell survival. NPD1-stimulated Bcl-xL dephosphorylation and/or PP2A-induced dephosphorylation might mediate a conformational change in Bcl-xL resulting in exposure of its BH3 domain, which is normally hidden in the hydrophobic domain of Bcl-xL (55Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.L. Ng S.L. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1279) Google Scholar). Thus, NPD1-induced Bcl-xL dephosphorylation may activate Bcl-xL via a conformational change in the BH3 domain that promotes Bax and Bcl-xL association, and NPD1-activated PP2A may more efficiently facilitate heterodimerization of Bax and Bcl-xL.Taken together, these findings are significant for several reasons. First, the observation of NPD1-induced dephosphorylation of S62Bcl-xL defines a mechanism of controlling the expression of anti- and pro-apoptotic factors in response to oxidative stress. Second, a specific and direct mechanism mediated by an NPD1-activated protein phosphatase has been established in RPE cells. Moreover, NPD1 attenuates laser-induced choroidal neovascularization in vivo in an experimental model of age-related macular degeneration (56Sheets K.G. Zhou Y. Ertel M.K. Knott E.J. Regan Jr., C.E. Elison J.R. Gordon W.C. Gjorstrup P. Bazan N.G. Mol. Vis. 2010; 2: 320-329Google Scholar).In summary, we demonstrate that Bcl-xL phosphorylation in ARPE-19 cells is induced by oxidative stress and that NPD1 enhances PP2A activity, in turn attenuating oxidative stress-induced phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL. These studies, for the first time, identify NPD1 as a novel regulator of the PP2A/C/Bcl-xL interaction. Hence, our results establish a stimulus-specific response in NPD1-dependent phosphorylation of Bcl-xL. NPD1 modulates the activation of this Bcl-2 family member by changing the phosphorylation status in a PP2A-dependent manner and also by enhancing the interaction of its counterpart, pro-apoptotic protein Bax, suggesting a highly coordinated, NPD1-mediated regulation of cell survival in response to oxidative stress.

https://openalex.org/W2063347565,"Chemokines orchestrate the migration of leukocytes in the context of homeostasis and inflammation. In addition to interactions of chemokines with receptors on migrating cells, these processes require interactions of chemokines with glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) for cell surface localization. Most chemokines are basic proteins with Arg/Lys/His residue clusters functioning as recognition epitopes for GAGs. In this study we characterized the GAG-binding epitopes of the chemokine I-TAC/CXCL11. Four separate clusters of basic residues were mutated to alanine and tested for their ability to bind to GAGs in vitro and to activate the receptor, CXCR3. Mutation of a set of basic residues in the C-terminal helix (the 50s cluster, (57)KSKQAR(62)) along with Lys(17), significantly impaired heparin binding in vitro, identifying these residues as components of the dominant epitope. However, this GAG mutant retained nearly wild type receptor binding affinity, and its ability to induce cell migration in vitro was only mildly perturbed. Nevertheless, the mutant was unable to induce cell migration in vivo, establishing a requirement of CXCL11 for GAG binding for in vivo function. These studies also led to some interesting findings. First, CXCL11 exhibits conformational heterogeneity, as evidenced by the doubling of peaks in its HSQC spectra. Second, it exhibits more than one affinity state for both heparin and CXCR3, which may be related to its structural plasticity. Finally, although the binding affinities of chemokines for GAGs are typically weaker than interactions with receptors, the high affinity GAG binding state of CXCL11 is comparable with typical receptor binding affinities, suggesting some unique properties of this chemokine."

Inactivation of ctpA results also in a decrease in the amount of the nitrous oxide reductase, NosZ. This pleiotropic phenotype could be partially rescued by excess copper in the medium, indicating that CtpA is likely a copper transporter that supplies copper-requiring proteins in the membrane with this metal. Although CtpA shares significant sequence homologies with the homeostasis copper efflux P1B-type ATPases including the bacterial CopA and the human ATP7A and ATP7B, disruption of ctpA did not result in any sensitivity to excess copper. This indicates that the CtpA is not crucial for copper tolerance but is involved in the assembly of membrane and periplasmic copper enzymes in this bacterium. The potential roles of CtpA in bacteria in comparison with CopA are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2083053167,"Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) is a physiological response to a decrease in airway O(2) tension, but the underlying mechanism is incompletely understood. We studied the contribution of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Glc-6-PD), an important regulator of NADPH redox and production of reactive oxygen species, to the development of HPV. We found that hypoxia (95% N(2), 5% CO(2)) increased contraction of bovine pulmonary artery (PA) precontracted with KCl or serotonin. Depletion of extracellular glucose reduced NADPH, NADH, and HPV, substantiating the idea that glucose metabolism and Glc-6-PD play roles in the response of PA to hypoxia. Our data also show that inhibition of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration (indicated by an increase in NAD(+) and decrease in the ATP-to-ADP ratio) by hypoxia, or by inhibitors of pyruvate dehydrogenase or electron transport chain complexes I or III, increased generation of reactive oxygen species, which in turn activated Glc-6-PD. Inhibition of Glc-6-PD decreased Ca(2+) sensitivity to the myofilaments and diminished Ca(2+)-independent and -dependent myosin light chain phosphorylation otherwise increased by hypoxia. Silencing Glc-6-PD expression in PA using a targeted small interfering RNA abolished HPV and decreased extracellular Ca(2+)-dependent PA contraction increased by hypoxia. Similarly, Glc-6-PD expression and activity were significantly reduced in lungs from Glc-6-PD(mut(-/-)) mice, and there was a corresponding reduction in HPV. Finally, regression analysis relating Glc-6-PD activity and the NADPH-to-NADP(+) ratio to the HPV response clearly indicated a positive linear relationship between Glc-6-PD activity and HPV. Based on these findings, we propose that Glc-6-PD and NADPH redox are crucially involved in the mechanism of HPV and, in turn, may play a key role in increasing pulmonary arterial pressure, which is involved in the development of pulmonary hypertension."

https://openalex.org/W2041544211,"Although the literature contains many studies on the function of UCP3, its role is still being debated. It has been hypothesized that UCP3 may mediate lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) translocation across the mitochondrial inner membrane (MIM), thus protecting the mitochondrial matrix from this very aggressive molecule. However, no experiments on mitochondria have provided evidence in support of this hypothesis. Here, using mitochondria isolated from UCP3-null mice and their wild-type littermates, we demonstrate the following. (i) In the absence of free fatty acids, proton conductance did not differ between wild-type and UCP3-null mitochondria. Addition of arachidonic acid (AA) to such mitochondria induced an increase in proton conductance, with wild-type mitochondria showing greater enhancement. In wild-type mitochondria, the uncoupling effect of AA was significantly reduced both when the release of O2* in the matrix was inhibited and when the formation of LOOH was inhibited. In UCP3-null mitochondria, however, the uncoupling effect of AA was independent of the above mechanisms. (ii) In the presence of AA, wild-type mitochondria released significantly more LOOH compared with UCP3-null mitochondria. This difference was abolished both when UCP3 was inhibited by GDP and under a condition in which there was reduced LOOH formation on the matrix side of the MIM. These data demonstrate that UCP3 is involved both in mediating the translocation of LOOH across the MIM and in LOOH-dependent mitochondrial uncoupling."

Here we demonstrate that the HOW RNA-binding protein is required for maintenance of CycB and therefore mitotic progression in GSCs and gonialblasts as well as determining the timing of the spermatogonial divisions. HOW is normally expressed in a complementary pattern to Bam in the germline and bam mRNA is bound by HOW in vivo. Ectopic expression of the HOW(L) isoform is associated with a delay in accumulation of Bam to the level required for differentiation, resulting in extra mitotic divisions. Spatiotemporal regulation of HOW expression is therefore required to specify the four spermatogonial transit-amplifying divisions."

Subsequent association of the Teb1 C-terminal domain with TASC confers the capacity for high RAP even though the Teb1 C-terminal domain does not provide a high-affinity DNA interaction site. Efficient RAP also requires suppression of nascent product folding mediated by the central Teb1 DNA-binding domains (DBDs).

https://openalex.org/W2103620024,"The tensile strength of fibrillar collagens depends on stable intermolecular cross-links formed through the lysyl oxidase mechanism. Such cross-links based on hydroxylysine aldehydes are particularly important in cartilage, bone, and other skeletal tissues. In adult cartilages, the mature cross-linking structures are trivalent pyridinolines, which form spontaneously from the initial divalent ketoimines. We examined whether this was the complete story or whether other ketoimine maturation products also form, as the latter are known to disappear almost completely from mature tissues. Denatured, insoluble, bovine articular cartilage collagen was digested with trypsin, and cross-linked peptides were isolated by copper chelation chromatography, which selects for their histidine-containing sequence motifs. The results showed that in addition to the naturally fluorescent pyridinoline peptides, a second set of cross-linked peptides was recoverable at a high yield from mature articular cartilage. Sequencing and mass spectral analysis identified their origin from the same molecular sites as the initial ketoimine cross-links, but the latter peptides did not fluoresce and were nonreducible with NaBH(4). On the basis of their mass spectra, they were identical to their precursor ketoimine cross-linked peptides, but the cross-linking residue had an M+188 adduct. Considering the properties of an analogous adduct of identical added mass on a glycated lysine-containing peptide from type II collagen, we predicted that similar dihydroxyimidazolidine structures would form from their ketoimine groups by spontaneous oxidation and free arginine addition. We proposed the trivial name arginoline for the ketoimine cross-link derivative. Mature bovine articular cartilage contains about equimolar amounts of arginoline and hydroxylysyl pyridinoline based on peptide yields."
https://openalex.org/W1967768427,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS3 protein has two enzymatic activities of helicase and protease that are essential for viral replication. The helicase separates the strands of DNA and RNA duplexes using the energy from ATP hydrolysis. To understand how ATP hydrolysis is coupled to helicase movement, we measured the single turnover helicase translocation-dissociation kinetics and the pre-steady-state P(i) release kinetics on single-stranded RNA and DNA substrates of different lengths. The parameters of stepping were determined from global fitting of the two types of kinetic measurements into a computational model that describes translocation as a sequence of coupled hydrolysis-stepping reactions. Our results show that the HCV helicase moves with a faster rate on single stranded RNA than on DNA. The HCV helicase steps on the RNA or DNA one nucleotide at a time, and due to imperfect coupling, not every ATP hydrolysis event produces a successful step. Comparison of the helicase domain (NS3h) with the protease-helicase (NS3-4A) shows that the most significant contribution of the protease domain is to improve the translocation stepping efficiency of the helicase. Whereas for NS3h, only 20% of the hydrolysis events result in translocation, the coupling for NS3-4A is near-perfect 93%. The presence of the protease domain also significantly reduces the stepping rate, but it doubles the processivity. These effects of the protease domain on the helicase can be explained by an improved allosteric cross-talk between the ATP- and nucleic acid-binding sites achieved by the overall stabilization of the helicase domain structure."

AKT is activated by a multi-step process involving phosphatidylinositide (PtdIns) phosphate-mediated recruitment of AKT and its upstream kinases, including 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), to the inner surface of the cell membrane. PDK1 in the appropriate context phosphorylates AKT at threonine 308 (T308) to activate AKT. Whether PtdIns(3,4,5)Ps (PtdInsP3) binding and AKT membrane translocation mediate functions other than formation of a functional PDK1::AKT complex have not been fully elucidated. We fused complementary fragments of intensely fluorescent protein (IFP) to AKT1 and PDK1 to induce a stable complex to study the prerequisites of AKT1 phosphorylation and function. In the stabilized PDK1-IFPC::IFPN-AKT1 complex, AKT1 T308 phosphorylation was independent of PtdIns, as demonstrated by treatment with Phosphatidylinositol 3 Kinase (PI3K) inhibitors. Further when interaction with PtdIns and the cell membrane was prevented by creating PH-domain mutants of AKT1 (R25A) and PDK1 (R474A), AKT1 phosphorylation on T308 was maintained in the PDK1-IFPC::IFPN-AKT1 complex.

Thus the locus of action of targeted therapeutics can be elucidated by the constitutively active AKT1 complex. Our data indicate that PtdIns and membrane localization are not required for AKT phosphorylation and activation, but rather serve to induce a functional physical interaction between PDK1 and AKT. The PDK1-IFPC::IFPN-AKT1 complex provides a cell-based platform to examine specificity of drugs targeting PI3K pathway components."

The mechanism by which this mutated tyrosine kinase initiates deregulated signals in cells is not completely understood. It is believed that JAK2-V617F requires interactions with homodimeric cytokine receptors to elicit its transforming signal. In this study, we demonstrate that components of heterodimeric cytokine receptors can also activate JAK2-V617F. Expression of IL27Ra, a heterodimeric receptor component, enhanced the activation of JAK2-V617F and subsequent downstream signaling to activation of STAT5 and ERK. In addition, expression of components of the interleukin-3 receptor, IL3Ra and the common beta chain, activated JAK2-V617F as well as STAT5 and ERK. Importantly, expression of IL27Ra functionally replaced the requirement of a homodimeric cytokine receptor to promote the activation and transforming activity of JAK2-V617F in BaF3 cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of IL27Ra was not required to induce activation of JAK2-V617F or STAT5, or to enhance the transforming activity of JAK2-V617F. Expression of IL3Ra or the common beta chain in BaF3 cells also enhanced the ability of JAK2-V617F to transform these hematopoietic cells. However, the heterodimeric receptor component IL12RB1 did not enhance the activation or transforming signals of JAK2-V617F in BaF3 cells. IL27Ra also activated the K539L and R683G JAK2 mutants. Together our data demonstrate that in addition to homodimeric receptors, some heterodimeric receptor components can support the activation and transforming signals of JAK2-V617F and other JAK2 mutants. Therefore, heterodimeric receptors may play unappreciated roles in JAK2 activation in the development of hematopoietic diseases including myeloproliferative neoplasms."

Inefficient polymerase assembly of the three polymerase subunits may contribute to this incompatibility, especially because the known protein-protein interaction domains, including the PA-binding domain of PB1, are highly conserved for each virus type. Here we show that substitution of the FluA PA-binding domain (PB1-A(1-25)) with that of FluB (PB1-B(1-25)) is accompanied by reduced polymerase activity and viral growth of FluA. Consistent with these findings, surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy measurements revealed that PA of FluA exhibits impaired affinity to biotinylated PB1-B(1-25) peptides. PA of FluB showed no detectable affinity to biotinylated PB1-A(1-25) peptides. Consequently, FluB PB1 harboring the PA-binding domain of FluA (PB1-AB) failed to assemble with PA and PB2 into an active polymerase complex. To regain functionality, we used a single amino acid substitution (T6Y) known to confer binding to PA of both virus types, which restored polymerase complex formation but surprisingly not polymerase activity for FluB. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the conserved virus type-specific PA-binding domains differ in their affinity to PA and thus might contribute to intertypic exclusion of reassortants between FluA and FluB viruses."

Ecotropic viral integration site 1 (Evi1) was first identified as a common retroviral integration site in AKXD murine myeloid tumors (1Morishita K. Parker D.S. Mucenski M.L. Jenkins N.A.

The human homologue EVI1 is transcriptionally activated by specific chromosomal abnormalities at 3q26 such as t(3;3)(q21;q26), inv(3)(q21q26), t(3,21), or others (2Morishita K. Parganas E.

These abnormalities lead to the aberrant expression of EVI1 and are associated with human acute myelogenous leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and chronic myelogenous leukemia. High expression of EVI1 is detectable in around 8% of myeloid leukemia cases and is a poor prognostic indicator in myeloid leukemia (4Lugthart S. van Drunen E. van Norden Y. van Hoven A.

In EVI1, two DNA binding domains with seven and three zinc finger repeats bind DNA through specific conserved GATA-like or ETS-like sequence motifs, and they have the potential to interact with both co-repressors and co-activators as a dual transcriptional factor (6Perkins A.S.

Although CtBP binding to EVI1 has been suggested to recruit histone deacetylase complexes (HDACs) and lead to transcriptional repression via chromatin remodeling, specific target genes repressed by EVI1 have not yet been found. On the other hand, the interaction of EVI1 with cAMP-responsive element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP) and p300/CBP-associated factor (P/CAF) was reported to result in the reversible acetylation of EVI1 and in their co-localization in nuclear speckles (11Chakraborty S.

We recently reported that in Evi1-deficient mouse embryos, hematopoietic stem cells are fewer and less able to proliferate just before death at embryonic day 10.5. Moreover, we found that defective hematopoietic stem cells in Evi1-deficient mice were due to down-regulation of Gata2 transcription, which is crucial for hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and development, and that Gata2 was one of the target genes transcriptionally regulated by Evi1 (12Yuasa H. Oike Y. Iwama A. Nishikata I. Sugiyama D. Perkins A. Mucenski M.L. Suda T. Morishita K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1976-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Recently, Evi1 was shown to be necessary for maintaining hematopoiesis in the adult murine hematopoietic system and in transformed leukemic cells (13Goyama S. Yamamoto G. Shimabe M. Sato T. Ichikawa M. Ogawa S. Chiba S. Kurokawa M. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 207-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Therefore, Evi1 is one of the transcriptional regulators essential for maintaining embryonic and adult hematopoietic stem cells, and the regulation of Gata2 by Evi1 is also an important event in hematopoietic stem cell maintenance. In this study, we investigated whether EVI1 regulates GATA2 expression in leukemia cells with high EVI1 expression (EVI1high leukemia) and how EVI1 regulates GATA2 transcription in those leukemia cells. Initially, we found that EVI1high leukemia cells strongly expressed GATA2 mRNA and that transcriptional activation of GATA2 by EVI1 is dependent on the 1S promoter, one of the alternatives to promoter 1 in GATA2 (14Minegishi N.

After the introduction of an Evi1 expression vector into murine leukemia EML-C1 cells, GATA2 transcription was induced by EVI1, whereas knocking down EVI1 transcripts by the introduction of small hairpin RNA (shRNA) down-regulated GATA2 transcription in EVI1high leukemia cell lines. Next, we found that the histone acetyltransferase p300/CBP-associated factor (P/CAF) could bind to EVI1 and acetylated EVI1 in leukemia cells. Lys564 in EVI1 is one of the important residues for the activation of GATA2 transcription by P/CAF acetylation. Finally, we developed specific antibodies that recognize the acetylated Lys564 of EVI1, and we found acetylated EVI1 in UCSD/AML1 cells with EVI1 high expression and in CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells from cord blood, but EVI1 was not acetylated in NT2 neuronal precursor cells. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation PCR and gel mobility shift assays, we found that the binding of EVI1 to the GATA2 promoter region was clearly enhanced by EVI1 acetylation. Therefore, the acetylation of EVI1 is an important modification that regulates the transcriptional activity and the DNA binding activity of EVI1. UCSD/AML1 cells derived from human acute myeloid leukemia (16Oval J. Jones O.W. Montoya M. Taetle R.

After PCR amplification, two cDNA fragments (amino acids 1–232 and 534–1052) were ligated to produce the proline-rich deletion (ΔPR; amino acids 233–533) of EVI1. Deletion of the first zinc finger repeat in DNA binding domain 1, Δ1(1) (deletion of amino acids 1–43), of EVI1 was achieved by PCR amplification from pCMV26-FLAG-EVI1. Deletion of the CtBP binding domain with the repression domain (ΔCtBP + RD, deletion of amino acids 529–732) of EVI1 was inversely PCR-amplified from the plasmid pME18SΔRD (deletion of amino acids 608–732). Site-directed mutagenesis at Lys559, Lys561, or Lys564 to Ala in EVI1 (K559A, K561A, or K564A) was achieved with the PfuTurbo DNA polymerase system (Stratagene). Murine Ctbp2 cDNA provided by Dr. Crossley (9Turner J. Crossley M.

Anti-GATA2 (H-116), anti-P/CAF (H-369), anti-p300 (N-15), anti-CBP (A-22), anti-CtBP (C-1), and anti-EVI1 (N-20) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. A rabbit polyclonal anti-HDAC1 antibody was purchased from Millipore. Mouse monoclonal anti-acetylated lysine antibody was purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. A mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2) antibody was purchased from Sigma. Trichostatin A was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries. An acetylated EVI1 peptide spanning Lys564 (TKRKDE(Ac)KPLTPVP) was synthesized to immunize rabbits. After immunization, a fraction of the specific immunoglobulin recognized by acetylated EVI1 was affinity-purified by binding to a column conjugated with the acetylated EVI1 peptide. Total RNA was extracted from each cell using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Total RNA was converted into cDNA using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Takara-Bio Inc.), and the cDNA was used as a template for PCR. The PCR was carried out by EX Taq polymerase (Takara-Bio Inc.), and the primers used were as follows: for human EVI1, forward 5′-CGAAAGCGAGAAT-3′ and reverse 5′-GGAAGACGTAGTG-3′; for human β-actin, forward 5′-AAGAGATGGCCACG-3′ and reverse 5′-TCCTTCTGCATCCTG-3′; for human GATA2, forward 5′-TGCGTCTCCAGCCTCATCTTCCGCG-3′ and reverse 5′-CGAGCCTTGCTGCGCTGCTT-3′; for human GATA2/1G, forward 5′-CCGGACCGCGTGTTGATGTACCTGG-3′ and reverse 5′-AACTCCTTCACTCTCAGAGGCC-3′; for human GATA2/1S, forward 5′-AAGCGGTCCGCTGAACACC-3′ and reverse 5′-CCACCTGCAGAAGAAGTAGT-3′; for human P/CAF, forward 5′-GCAAGGCCGAGGAGTCTTGTAAA-3′ and reverse 5′-GTTATTCACACCCTGTTCAATGCT-3′. After extraction of total RNA from each cell line using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), the total RNA was converted into cDNA by avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Takara-Bio Inc.). The resulting first-strand cDNA was used for real time RT-PCR using a SYBR Green PCR master mix kit (Applied Biosystems). The primers used were as follows: for human GATA2, forward 5′-CTGCACAATGTTAACAGGCCACTGACCATG-3′ and reverse 5′-CATGGTCAGTGGCCTGTTAACATTGTGCAG-3′; for human EVI1, forward 5′-TTGCCAAGTAACAGCTTTGCTG-3′ and reverse 5′-GGTAGACTTTAGAGAAAGGCC-3′; and for human β-actin, forward 5′-CGGGAAATCGGTGCGTGACAT-3′ and reverse 5′-CTAGAAGCATTTGCGGTGGA-3′. The mRNA levels were detected using an ABI Prism 7000, and the data were analyzed by sequence detection systems software (Applied Biosystems) and normalized to the amount of β-actin mRNA. A DNA-based small hairpin (sh) RNA expression vector (pSIREN-retroQ-ZsGreen plasmid, Takara-Bio Inc.) was used in the EVI1 knockdown experiment. The following sequence was cloned into the BamHI-EcoRI site of the plasmid to create an shRNA against human EVI1 (22Liu Y. Chen L. Ko T.C. Fields A.P. Thompson E.A. Oncogene. 2006; 25: 3565-3575Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar): 5′-GATCGCTCTAAGGCTGAACTAGCAGTTCAAGAGACTGCTAGTTCAGCCTTAGATTTTTTG-3′. A pSIREN-retroQ-ZsGreen-shLuc containing shRNA against luciferase (Takara-Bio Inc.) was used as a control. Retroviral particles were generated using the p10A1 packaging vector (Takara-Bio Inc.) and transient transfection of the 293T cell line, which was carried out by Hilymax liposome transfection reagent (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc.). For retroviral infection, 1 × 106 UCSD/AML1 cells were placed in 6-cm dishes containing 5 ml of retroviral supernatant with 100 ng/ml Polybrene for 24 h. ZsGreen-positive UCSD/AML1 cells were sorted by a JSAN cell sorter (Bay Bioscience) 2 weeks after viral infection. Repression of EVI1 expression was confirmed by RT-PCR as above. COS7 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged EVI1, FLAG-tagged mutant EVI1, and a P/CAF expression plasmid using HilyMax according to the manufacturer's instructions. After culturing for 48 h, the transfected cells were solubilized with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with protease inhibitor (Complete, Roche Applied Science). The lysates were then immunoprecipitated by incubation with an anti-FLAG (M2), anti-P/CAF, anti-EVI1 (N-20), anti-CtBP (C-1), or anti-HDAC1 antibody followed by incubation with protein G beads (Amersham Biosciences). After washing, the bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE, blotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore), and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody or anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Invitrogen). The transfer membrane was developed by ECL PlusTM reagent (GE Healthcare). Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 15 min at room temperature, washed with 0.1 m glycine in TBS for 5 min, permeabilized by 0.1% Triton X-100 in TBS for 10 min, and washed with 0.1 m glycine in TBS for 5 min. Cells were then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in TBS at 4 °C for 1 h prior to incubation with a first antibody (goat anti-EVI1 antibody, rabbit anti-P/CAF antibody, mouse anti-acetyl-lysine antibody, or rabbit anti-acetylated Lys564 EVI1 antibody). Samples were incubated with each first antibody at 4 °C overnight, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated with either Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-goat IgG antibody, Alexa Fluor 546-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody, or Alexa Fluor 555 anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Invitrogen) at 4 °C for 1 h. Nuclei were counterstained with 4′,6-diamino-2-phenylindole (Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Inc.) or TOTO-3 from Molecular Probes (Invitrogen). Samples were enclosed with Prolong Gold antifade (Invitrogen) and observed under a laser-scanning microscope (TCS SP2 AOBS, Leica Microsystems). A GATA2 promoter luciferase assay was performed based on a previous report (12Yuasa H. Oike Y. Iwama A. Nishikata I. Sugiyama D. Perkins A. Mucenski M.L. Suda T. Morishita K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1976-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In brief, the GATA2 promoter construct (pGL3-B7) with luciferase under the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter (pRL-TK) as an internal control was co-transfected with each expression plasmid, such as FLAG-EVI1 or a series of FLAG-EVI1 mutants into 5 × 103 COS7 cells/well (24 well plate) by Hilymax Lipofection reagent. Transfected cells were incubated for 48 h in a CO2 incubator and collected by centrifugation. The luciferase assay was performed using a Dual-Luciferase assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Luciferase activity was measured using a MiniLumat LB9506 (Berthold). A ChIP assay was performed with a ChIP assay kit (Upstate) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After transfection of FLAG-EVI1, FLAG-EVI1K561A, or FLAG-EVI1K564A expression plasmids with GATA2 promoter constructs (pGL2-B7) into COS7 cells with Hilymax transfection reagent, the transfected COS7 cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde and sonicated with a Sonifier 450 (Branson). After cross-linked chromatin fragments were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG M2 antibody, immunoprecipitated chromatin was reverse cross-linked at 65 °C overnight, digested with ribonuclease A and proteinase K, and then purified. Purified DNA fragments were amplified using a pair of primers for the specific EVI1-binding site at the GATA2 promoter, forward 5′-CCTCTGCCTCTCTGCCTCTGCCTC-3′ and reverse 5′-GCATGTTTTCTAATATCCAGGCCT-3′ (12Yuasa H. Oike Y. Iwama A. Nishikata I. Sugiyama D. Perkins A. Mucenski M.L. Suda T. Morishita K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1976-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The same ChIP experiment was done by co-transfection of the EVI1 expression vector with CtBP2 or P/CAF. Gel mobility shift assay was performed using a second generation digoxigenin-labeled gel shift assay kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A FLAG-EVI or a FLAG-EVI1K564A expression plasmid was introduced into COS7 cells with Hilymax Lipofection reagent. After incubation for 48 h, the transfected cells were collected by centrifuge and lysed with lysis buffer. The cell supernatants were used for immunoprecipitation with mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody-conjugated agarose beads. Immunoprecipitated EVI1 protein was washed with phosphate-buffered saline and eluted with 100 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Sigma). Purified FLAG-EVI1 or FLAG-EVI1K564A was mixed with 0.4 ng/μl DIG-labeled double-stranded DNA nucleotides containing the EVI1-binding sequence at the GATA2 promoter region (5′-ACAGTGGTGATGTCCATGTCCCTTTTATTT-3′) (12Yuasa H. Oike Y. Iwama A. Nishikata I. Sugiyama D. Perkins A. Mucenski M.L. Suda T. Morishita K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1976-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) or with 0.4 ng/μl DIG-labeled nucleotides containing cold excess unlabeled nucleotides (0.1 μg/μl) as a competitor. Samples were separated by electrophoresis in 0.2× TBE buffer and blotted to a positively charged nylon membrane (Hybond N+, GE Healthcare) and then cross-linked by a 120 mJ/cm2 cross-linker (UVP). The membrane was incubated with an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-DIG Fab fragment (Roche Applied Science) and then developed with disodium 3-(4-methoxyspiro{1,2-dioxetane-3,2′-(5′-chloro)tricyclo[3.3.1.13,7]decan}-4-yl) phenyl phosphate reagent (Roche Applied Science). Recently, we reported that Evi1 maintained murine hematopoietic stem cells through direct transcriptional activation of the Gata2 gene (12Yuasa H. Oike Y. Iwama A. Nishikata I. Sugiyama D. Perkins A. Mucenski M.L. Suda T. Morishita K. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1976-1987Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). To determine whether EVI1 regulates GATA2 transcripts in human myeloid leukemia cells, various leukemia cell lines with or without EVI1 expression were evaluated for GATA2 expression levels by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1A, human myeloid leukemia cell lines with chromosomal translocations or inversions of chromosome 3q26 (UCSD/AML1, Kasumi-3, and MOLM-1) strongly expressed EVI1 (EVI1high leukemia cells), whereas cell lines without a chromosome 3q26 abnormality (NH, K051, HL-60, THP-1, U937, and OIH-1) expressed very low levels of EVI1 (EVI1low leukemia cells). A GATA2/1S transcript was derived from the distal first exon (1S), which is specifically used in hematopoietic and neuronal cells, and a GATA2/1G transcript was derived from the proximal first exon (1G), which is utilized in various tissues (14Minegishi N. Ohta J. Suwabe N. Nakauchi H. Ishihara H. Hayashi N. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3625-3634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 15Pan X. Minegishi N. Harigae H. Yamagiwa H. Minegishi M. Akine Y. Yamamoto M. J. Biochem. 2000; 127: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Using specific primers for detecting 1S exon-derived transcripts (GATA2/1S), 1G exon-derived transcripts (GATA2/1G), or both GATA2 transcripts (GATA2/T), we performed semi-quantitative RT-PCR. GATA2/T was detected in all of the leukemia cell lines and showed relatively high expression in the EVI1high leukemia cells (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, GATA2/1G was expressed in most of the cell lines; however, GATA2/1S was only detected in three EVI1high leukemia cell lines. These results indicated that EVI1 might specifically regulate the expression of GATA2/1S transcripts in leukemia cell lines. Next, to determine whether the ectopic expression of EVI1 activates GATA2/1S and/or GATA2/1G transcription in leukemia cells, a green fluorescence protein-EVI1 expression plasmid was transfected into stem cell factor-dependent murine EML-C1 cells (19Tsai S. Bartelmez S. Sitnicka E. Collins S. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2831-2841Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and three kinds of GATA2 transcripts were monitored in the EML-C1 cells (Fig. 1B). EVI1, GATA2/1S, GATA2/1G, and both of the GATA2 transcripts (GATA2/T) were faintly expressed in parental EML-C1 cells. After transfection of EVI1, the levels of EVI1 and GATA2/1S transcripts increased at the same time 48 h after the transfection, but the level of the GATA2/1G transcript was unchanged before and after EVI1 transfection. An increase in the GATA2/T and GATA2/1S transcripts of ∼4-fold was detected by real time RT-PCR along with the same up-regulated level of EVI1 expression (Fig. 1C). Thus, the GATA2/1S transcript is specifically up-regulated in EML-C1 by EVI1 expression. To determine whether the GATA2 expression in EVI1high leukemia cells is dependent on EVI1 expression, EVI1 transcripts were knocked down in UCSD/AML1 cells by the transfection of retroviral vectors with small EVI1 hairpin RNA (shEVI1). Green fluorescence protein expression was used as a transfection marker. After sorting green fluorescence protein-positive UCSD/AML1 cells, three independent cell lines (shEVI1–1, shEVI1–2, and shEVI1–3) were established. The expression of EVI1 was significantly suppressed in the shEVI1–1 to shEVI1–3 cell lines as compared with the parental UCSD/AML1 cells and with UCSD/AML1 cells transfected with shRNA for firefly luciferase (shLuc/AML1) or shRNA mock vector (shNega/AML1) as controls (Fig. 1D). Along with down-regulated EVI1 expression, the expression levels of GATA2/T, GATA2/1S, and GATA2/1G mRNA were also significantly down-regulated. Thus, EVI1 enhances GATA2 transcription in EVI1high leukemia cells. After showing that EVI1 activates GATA2 transcription in EVI1high leukemia cells, we next examined the molecular mechanism of transcriptional activation of GATA2. Initially, we looked for an interaction between EVI1 and histone acetyltransferase/transcriptional co-activators such as p300, CBP, and P/CAF. After the EVI1 expression plasmid was transiently co-transfected with p300, CBP, or P/CAF expression plasmids into COS7 cells, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with either anti-P/CAF, anti-CBP, anti-p300, or EVI1 antibodies. The precipitated proteins were then immunoblotted with each antibody, as above. An EVI1-P/CAF complex was precipitated by either anti-EVI1 or P/CAF antibodies (Fig. 2A), but EVI1 did not interact with p300 or CBP (supplemental Fig. S1, A–C). Next, we asked whether P/CAF could enhance the transcriptional activation of GATA2 by EVI1. Various amounts of a P/CAF expression plasmid were co-transfected with an EVI1 expression plasmid along with a GATA2-luciferase promoter/reporter plasmid into COS7 cells. GATA2 transcription was dose-dependently enhanced by P/CAF co-transfection with EVI1 (Fig. 2B), but p300 and CBP did not enhance GATA2 transcription (Fig. 2C). Because EVI1 was acetylated by P/CAF or CBP (11Chakraborty S. Senyuk V. Sitailo S. Chi Y. Nucifora G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44936-44943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we next examined the acetylation of EVI1 after P/CAF co-transfection (Fig. 2D). After transfection of FLAG-tagged EVI1 with or without P/CAF, the precipitated proteins were immunoblotted with either anti-EVI1 or anti-acetylated lysine antibody. Acetylated EVI1 protein was increased after co-transfection with P/CAF into COS7 cells, and the level of acetylated EVI1 protein was significantly enhanced after both EVI1 alone and EVI1 with P/CAF transfection upon treatment with trichostatin A, which is an inhibitor of histone deacetylases (Fig. 2D). To confirm whether endogenous EVI1 is acetylated and whether the endogenous EVI1 and P/CAF form a protein complex in EVI1high leukemia cells, cell extracts of UCSD/AML1 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-acetylated or anti-P/CAF antibodies, and the precipitated proteins were immunoblotted with anti-EVI1 or anti-P/CAF antibodies. As shown in Fig. 2F, EVI1 was significantly acetylated and interacted with P/CAF in EVI1high leukemia cells. To confirm the co-localization of EVI1 and P/CAF and the existence of acetylated EVI1 in the UCSD/AML1 cells, endogenous EVI1 and P/CAF were stained with anti-EVI1 and anti-P/CAF antibodies (upper column), or with anti-EVI1 and anti-acetylated lysine antibodies (lower column) and examined under confocal microscopy.

Refolding of an unfolded protein is efficiently mediated by the Hsc70 system with either type 1 DnaJ protein, DjA1 or DjA2, and a nucleotide exchange factor. A surface plasmon resonance technique was applied to investigate substrate recognition by the Hsc70 system and demonstrated that multiple Hsc70 proteins and a dimer of DjA1 initially bind independently to an unfolded protein. The association rate of the Hsc70 was faster than that of DjA1 under folding-compatible conditions. The Hsc70 binding involved a conformational change, whereas the DjA1 binding was bivalent and substoichiometric. Consistently, we found that the bound (14)C-labeled Hsc70 to the unfolded protein became more resistant to tryptic digestion. The gel filtration and cross-linking experiments revealed the predominant presence of the DjA1 dimer. Furthermore, the Hsc70 and DjA1 bound to distinct sets of peptide array sequences. All of these findings argue against the generality of the widely proposed hypothesis that the DnaJ-bound substrate is targeted and transferred to Hsp70. Instead, these results suggest the importance of the bivalent binding of DjA1 dimer that limits unfavorable transitions of substrate conformations in protein folding."

It catalyzes two reactions to integrate the viral cDNA into the host genome, 3′ processing and strand transfer, but the dynamic behavior of the active site during catalysis of these two processes remains poorly characterized. NMR spectroscopy can reveal important structural details about enzyme mechanisms, but to date the IN catalytic core domain has proven resistant to such an analysis. Here, we present the first NMR studies of a soluble variant of the catalytic core domain. The NMR chemical shifts are found to corroborate structures observed in crystals, and confirm prior studies suggesting that the α4 helix extends toward the active site. We also observe a dramatic improvement in NMR spectra with increasing MgCl2 concentration. This improvement suggests a structural transition not only near the active site residues but also throughout the entire molecule as IN binds Mg2+. In particular, the stability of the core domain is linked to the conformation of its C-terminal helix, which has implications for relative domain orientation in the full-length enzyme. 15N relaxation experiments further show that, although conformationally flexible, the catalytic loop of IN is not fully disordered in the absence of DNA.

https://openalex.org/W2169442396,"Phosphoinositides play key roles in regulating membrane dynamics and intracellular signaling in eukaryotic cells. However, comparable lipid-based signaling pathways have not been identified in bacteria. Here we show that Mycobacterium smegmatis and other Actinomycetes bacteria can synthesize the phosphoinositide, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI3P). This lipid was transiently labeled with [(3)H]inositol. Sensitivity of the purified lipid to alkaline phosphatase, headgroup analysis by high-pressure liquid chromatography, and mass spectrometry demonstrated that it had the structure 1,2-[tuberculostearoyl, octadecenoyl]-sn-glycero 3-phosphoinositol 3-phosphate. Synthesis of PI3P was elevated by salt stress but not by exposure to high concentrations of non-ionic solutes. Synthesis of PI3P in a cell-free system was stimulated by the synthesis of CDP-diacylglycerol, a lipid substrate for phosphatidylinositol (PI) biosynthesis, suggesting that efficient cell-free PI3P synthesis is dependent on de novo PI synthesis. In vitro experiments further indicated that the rapid turnover of this lipid was mediated, at least in part, by a vanadate-sensitive phosphatase. This is the first example of de novo synthesis of PI3P in bacteria, and the transient synthesis in response to environmental stimuli suggests that some bacteria may have evolved similar lipid-mediated signaling pathways to those observed in eukaryotic cells."

To study the role of αIIb extension about the genu, we introduced a disulfide “clamp” between the αIIb thigh and calf-1 domains.

Thus, “cross-clasping” the αIIb headpiece β-propeller domain to the β3 IEGF-4 domain in the tail region via a newly engineered disulfide bond prevented the binding of fibrinogen induced by activating mAb in concert with the activating divalent cation Mn2+, and a similar effect was observed with cross-clasped αVβ3 (16Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). In both cases the loss of ligand binding could be rescued by reducing the cross-clasped receptors with dithiothreitol (DTT). In contrast, the binding of a fragment of fibronectin (Mr = ∼50 kDa) to the ectodomain of αVβ3 activated by Mn2+ was not associated with receptor extension as judged by electron microscopy (22Adair B.D. Xiong J.P. Maddock C. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Yeager M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).To understand better the role of αIIb extension around the αIIb genu region in ligand binding, we selectively clamped the αIIb thigh domain to the αIIb calf-1 domain with a newly engineered disulfide bond created by mutating αIIb Arg597 and Tyr645 to cysteine residues. We directly confirmed the formation of the disulfide bond by mass spectrometry and tested the interaction of both large and small ligands to clamped αIIbβ3, as well as both soluble and immobilized ligands. We also tested the effects of multiple αIIbβ3 activation mechanisms, including Mn2+ and coexpression of normal and mutant αIIb with a mutant β3 subunit that when coexpressed with normal αIIb results in spontaneous fibrinogen binding (N339S) (23Cheng M. Foo S.Y. Shi M.L. Tang R.H. Kong L.S. Law S.K. Tan S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18225-18232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Our data support an important role for receptor extension around the genu for the binding of large soluble ligands induced by some, but not all activation mechanisms. In contrast, restricting αIIb extension about the genu had only a modest effect on αIIbβ3-mediated adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen and no discernable effect on the binding of small soluble ligands. These data provide new insight into the contribution of αIIb extension around the genu to high affinity ligand binding.DISCUSSIONOur studies were designed to elucidate the role of αIIb extension about the genu in αIIbβ3 ligand binding. Previous studies clasping the αIIb β-propeller domain to the β3 IEGF-4 domain suggested a role for extension of αIIb, β3, or both in the binding of fibrinogen to αIIbβ3 when cells were activated by a combination of Mn2+ and an activating mAb (16Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). We have extended these studies by analyzing the effect of an αIIb clamp confined to the region immediately adjacent to the genu and assessing the binding of both high and low Mr soluble ligands, as well as the ability of the mutant receptor to support adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen and bind a ligand-induced binding site antibody whose epitope is on the β3 PSI domain.The αIIb R597C-Y645C clamp was designed based on the predicted proximity of these residues in the αIIb molecular model we constructed using the crystal structure of the bent αVβ3 receptor ectodomains as a template. After these studies were completed, the close proximity of the residues was directly confirmed in the crystal structure of the ectodomain of αIIbβ3 (12Zhu J. Luo B.H. Xiao T. Zhang C. Nishida N. Springer T.A. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 849-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Support for the successful creation of the new disulfide bond came from analyzing both mass spectrometric data and the electrophorectic mobility of αIIb in SDS-PAGE under both nonreducing and reducing conditions.We found that clamped αIIbβ3 has a dramatically reduced ability to bind the soluble ligands fibrinogen (Mr = 340,000) and IgM mAb PAC-1 (Mr = 900,000) induced by the activating mAb PT25-2, which binds to αIIb. The defect could be largely rescued by adding the reducing agent DTT. These studies have the inherit limitation that they depend on the ability of the mAb to bind equally to the normal and clamped receptor. We excluded the possibility that the reduction in ligand binding was due to the clamp altering the binding of PT25-2 by directly measuring PT25-2 binding to cells expressing normal or clamped αIIbβ3 and observing equivalent binding. DTT was able to partially activate the receptor itself and partially rescued the ability of the clamped receptor to increase ligand binding in response to PT25-2. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that DTT treatment reduced the engineered disulfide bond in most, but not all, of the clamped αIIbβ3 molecules, providing an explanation for the partial rescue of ligand binding. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that substituting cysteines for arginine at position 597 and/or tyrosine at position 645 affects ligand binding.In sharp contrast to the findings with fibrinogen and PAC-1, the binding of the lower Mr snake venom kistrin, which contains an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) sequence and does not require exogenous receptor activation, was unaffected by the clamp, indicating receptor extension about the genu is not required for its binding. The smaller Mr of kistrin compared with fibrinogen and PAC-1 may account for the difference in its ability to bind to αIIbβ3 because it is established that short peptides containing the RGD sequence can bind to unactivated platelets (39Beer J.H. Springer K.T. Coller B.S. Blood. 1992; 79: 117-128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Because activating αIIbβ3 with a mAb may not simulate activation by physiologic agonists (10Ye F. Hu G. Taylor D. Ratnikov B. Bobkov A.A. McLean M.A. Sligar S.G. Taylor K.A. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell. Biol. 2010; 188: 157-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), especially because it introduces a large molecule that may cause steric hindrance, we also activated the receptor by coexpression with the activating β3 subunit mutant N339S and by incubation with Mn2+. Cells expressing normal αIIb with the β3 mutant demonstrated high level spontaneous binding of both fibrinogen and PAC-1, and adding an activating mAb had little or no effect. Fibrinogen and PAC-1 both also showed high level binding to cells expressing the clamped αIIb in combination with the β3 activating mutant, and adding an activating mAb also did not affect the results. Additional structural studies are required to assess the mechanisms by which N339S activates the receptor, but it is strategically located in the region of β3 encompassing the β6-α7 loop and α7 helix; the latter have been implicated in controlling ligand affinity because they occupy different locations in the unliganded and liganded β3 crystal structures (11Xiao T.

Arnaout M.A. Science. 2002; 296: 151-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar). Because size-dependent access appears to play a role in αIIbβ3 ligand binding (40Coller B.S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), it is possible that the β3 N339S mutation alters the conformation of the receptor so as to allow greater access to the ligand-binding pocket; alternatively or additionally, it is possible that β3 N339S directly affects the affinity for the ligands either by reorienting Asp251 (12Zhu J. Luo B.H. Xiao T. Zhang C. Nishida N. Springer T.A. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 849-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) or by facilitating the movement of the α1-β1 loop toward the MIDAS so as to bring two of the loop's backbone N atoms close enough to interact with the ligand carboxyl oxygen that does not coordinate the MIDAS (12Zhu J. Luo B.H. Xiao T. Zhang C. Nishida N. Springer T.A. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 849-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Our studies of AP5 binding to the normal and mutant αIIbβ3 receptors provided some data that bear on these issues. Thus, in the absence of ligand, AP5 bound equally well to normal αIIbβ3 and clamped αIIbβ3; αIIbβ3 N339S, however, bound more AP5 than the other receptors, suggesting that the β3 N339S mutation induces conformational changes in the β3 βA (I-like) domain that are propagated to the PSI domain.Mn2+ activation was also able to overcome the defect in binding soluble fibrinogen induced by clamping αIIb. The mechanism by which Mn2+ activates integrin receptors is unknown, but studies swapping different regions of αIIb and αV implicated the calf-2 region as controlling the process (41Kamata T. Handa M. Sato Y. Ikeda Y. Aiso S. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 24775-24783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Ye et al. (10Ye F. Hu G. Taylor D. Ratnikov B. Bobkov A.A.

They interpreted their data as inconsistent with the need for integrin extension for ligand binding, but their study had a number of limitations, including lack of quantitation of the percentage of receptors that mediated ligand binding, the identification of a small subpopulation of receptors that did assume a more upright conformation in the presence of Mn2+, and the absence of cytoskeletal and contractile elements in their system that may play an important role in generating the conformational changes in αIIbβ3 (12Zhu J. Luo B.H. Xiao T. Zhang C. Nishida N. Springer T.A. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 849-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Regardless of the precise mechanisms, the data from the β3 N339S mutant and Mn2+ activation indicate that it is possible under certain circumstances for high Mr ligands to bind to αIIbβ3 receptors that have limited mobility about the αIIb genu.If, as suggested by our data, ligand size is an important determinant of its ability to bind to integrin receptors that have not undergone extension about the α-subunit genu, this may provide an explanation for the finding by Adair et al. (22Adair B.D. Xiong J.P. Maddock C. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Yeager M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) that an ∼50-kDa fragment of fibronectin, which is between kistrin and fibrinogen in Mr, can bind to αVβ3 without evidence of headpiece extension. However, because Mn2+ was used to induce the binding of the fibronectin fragment, and we found that Mn2+ could rescue the ability of the clamped αIIbβ3 receptor to bind soluble fibrinogen, it is not possible to separate the potential contributions of ligand Mr and Mn2+ activation.In contrast to our finding that Mn2+ activation could rescue soluble ligand binding to clamped αIIbβ3, Takagi et al. (16Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar) found reduced soluble fibrinogen binding to cross-clasped αIIbβ3 even in the presence of both Mn2+ and PT25-2. Thus, the alteration induced by cross-clasping differs from that induced by our clamping procedure. Collectively our data and those of Takagi et al. could be explained by postulating that PT25-2 (and perhaps AP5) induces activation via an initial effect on αIIb extension, with subsequent effects on the β3 subunit. The effect of the β3 N339S mutant and Mn2+ may thus be downstream of the effect of PT25-2, but the Mn2+ effect may require mobility between regions of αIIb and β3 that are restricted by the cross-clasp introduced by Takagi et al.Fibrinogen is unusual among αIIbβ3 ligands in that the binding of soluble fibrinogen requires receptor activation, whereas adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen does not (42Coller B.S. Blood. 1980; 55: 169-178Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Lindon J.N. McManama G. Kushner L. Merrill E.W. Salzman E.W. Blood. 1986; 68: 355-362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44Savage B. Ruggeri Z.M.

One possible explanation for this behavior is that activation-induced αIIbβ3 extension is required for the binding of soluble fibrinogen, but not for mediating adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen. To test this hypothesis, we also studied the effect of clamping αIIb about the genu on αIIbβ3-mediated adhesion to fibrinogen. Clamping αIIbβ3 produced little or no reduction in adhesion to fibrinogen immobilized at high density and only a slight reduction in adhesion to fibrinogen immobilized at low density. Thus, αIIb extension about the genu had much less of an effect on αIIbβ3 interactions with immobilized fibrinogen than on binding of soluble fibrinogen. A number of mechanisms have been proposed to account for the difference in requirements for αIIbβ3 binding of soluble fibrinogen versus mediating adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen, including conformational changes in fibrinogen induced by immobilization (47Moskowitz K.A. Kudryk B. Coller B.S. Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 79: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and the potential for multivalent interactions between receptors and ligand molecules stemming from the higher density of fibrinogen achieved with immobilization (43Lindon J.N. McManama G. Kushner L. Merrill E.W. Salzman E.W. Blood. 1986; 68: 355-362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We noted a greater impact of clamping αIIb at the lower fibrinogen coating density, suggesting a correlation with ligand density, but these data need to be interpreted in light of the known impact of fibrinogen coating density on the conformational changes induced by immobilizing the ligand (43Lindon J.N. McManama G. Kushner L. Merrill E.W. Salzman E.W. Blood. 1986; 68: 355-362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Moskowitz K.A. Kudryk B. Coller B.S. Thromb. Haemost. 1998; 79: 824-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The recent study by Zhu et al. (12Zhu J. Luo B.H. Xiao T. Zhang C. Nishida N. Springer T.A. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 849-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar) provides an additional hypothesis, namely adhesion-mediated engagement of the cytoplasmic region of β3 with the cytoskeleton, leading to activation of the receptor via contractile traction forces initiating receptor extension and β3 swing-out. Thus, even an initial low affinity interaction with immobilized fibrinogen could induce higher affinity by this traction activation mechanism. If this is a contributing factor, our data indicate that higher affinity can be achieved even without extension at the genu. Most recently, Ye et al. found that binding of the talin head domain to the cytoplasmic domain of β3 was sufficient to induce both αIIbβ3 extension and PAC-1 binding (10Ye F. Hu G. Taylor D. Ratnikov B. Bobkov A.A. McLean M.A. Sligar S.G. Taylor K.A. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell. Biol. 2010; 188: 157-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar), but this does not exclude an additional contribution to enhanced αIIbβ3 affinity via a traction mechanism (12Zhu J. Luo B.H. Xiao T. Zhang C. Nishida N. Springer T.A. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 849-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar).Binding of ligands to αIIbβ3 is known to induce conformational changes in the receptor (4Kouns W.C.

Chem. 1985; 260: 11107-11114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), resulting in outside-in signaling that leads to profound cellular changes, most dramatically cytoskeletal reorganization and cell spreading (2Shattil S.J. Newman P.J. Blood. 2004; 104: 1606-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Although receptor extension has been postulated to affect ligand binding, little is known about its potential contribution to post-ligand binding events. Therefore, we assessed the effect of clamping αIIb on the ability of the snake venom kistrin (which we demonstrated binds similarly to both normal and clamped αIIbβ3) to expose the AP5 epitope, which is located in the PSI domain of β3 (amino acids 1–6) and becomes more available with ligand binding (5Honda S. Tomiyama Y. Pelletier A.J. Annis D. Honda Y. Orchekowski R. Ruggeri Z. Kunicki T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11947-11954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). As expected, AP5 binding to normal αIIbβ3 was low in the absence of kistrin and increased ∼6-fold in the presence of kistrin. AP5 binding to clamped αIIbβ3 was similarly low in the absence of kistrin, but the addition of kistrin produced less enhancement than was observed with normal αIIbβ3. This was not due to an irreversible alteration in the clamped molecule or reduced expression of surface receptors because treatment with DTT completely rescued the response. Clamping the αIIbβ3 N339S mutant also decreased kistrin-induced AP5 binding. In the crystal structure of the complete ectodomain of αIIbβ3, the AP5 epitope is masked by IEGF-2 in the bent conformation, but it is predicted to be accessible with headpiece extension (12Zhu J. Luo B.H. Xiao T. Zhang C. Nishida N. Springer T.A. Mol. Cell. 2008; 32: 849-861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Thus, our data provide evidence that AP5 epitope exposure secondary to ligand binding requires extension at the genu and raises the possibility that the latter also contributes to outside-in signaling. Moreover, because Zhu et al. reported that the hybrid and PSI domains bury a total 822 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area in the bent receptor compared with a model of the extended receptor, it is also possible that headpiece extension initiated by inside-out signaling contributes to enhanced ligand affinity by reducing the energy barrier for the swing-out motion of the hybrid and PSI domains.It is of interest to compare our data on the clamped receptor with observations on the platelets of a patient with Glanzmann thrombasthenia who had intact αIIbβ3 ectodomains but whose receptors were insensitive to inside-out signaling as a result of a mutation in the β3 cytoplasmic domain (26Chen Y.P. O'Toole T.E. Ylänne J. Rosa J.P. Ginsberg M.H. Blood. 1994; 84: 1857-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Chen Y.P. Djaffar I. Pidard D. Steiner B. Cieutat A.M. Caen J.P. Rosa J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1992; 89: 10169-10173Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The patient's receptors were able to support platelet adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen but not soluble fibrinogen binding in response to agonist stimulation. The similarities between the patient data and the data using clamped αIIbβ3 are consistent with a model in which inside-out signaling acts, at least in part, by inducing extension at the αIIb genu.In conclusion, our data support a role for αIIb extension about the genu in the binding of high Mr, but not lower Mr ligands under some, but not all conditions of activation. Additional data are required to define which pathways of activation are initiated by physiologic and pathologic stimuli. Although there is support for αIIb extension controlling binding of high Mr ligands via an effect on access to the ligand-binding site (40Coller B.S. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), it remains possible that αIIb extension affects the activation responsiveness and/or affinity of the ligand-binding pocket in addition to, or instead of, affecting size-dependent access. One possibility is that the loss of the headpiece-tailpiece interactions that stabilize the β3 hybrid and PSI domains in the bent structure frees the β3 subunit to undergo the swing-out motion and the movement of the α1-β1 loop toward the MIDAS. These data also provide a potential explanation for the difference in activation dependence of soluble fibrinogen binding versus adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen. Finally, our data raise the novel possibility that αIIb extension also contributes to post-ligand binding outside-in signaling by facilitating conformational change in β3. IntroductionThe platelet αIIbβ3 receptor plays an important role in both hemostasis and thrombosis (1Phillips D.R. Charo I.F. Scarborough R.M. Cell. 1991; 65: 359-362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Ligand binding to αIIbβ3 is controlled by an activation process that affects the conformation of the receptor and ligand binding, in turn, can also affect the conformation of the receptor (2Shattil S.J. Newman P.J. Blood. 2004; 104: 1606-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Several different conformations of αIIbβ3 have been identified based on inferences from biochemical analyses (3Parise L.V. Helgerson S.L. Steiner B. Nannizzi L. Phillips D.R. J. Biol.

Thus, “cross-clasping” the αIIb headpiece β-propeller domain to the β3 IEGF-4 domain in the tail region via a newly engineered disulfide bond prevented the binding of fibrinogen induced by activating mAb in concert with the activating divalent cation Mn2+, and a similar effect was observed with cross-clasped αVβ3 (16Takagi J. Petre B.M. Walz T. Springer T.A. Cell. 2002; 110: 599-611Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (914) Google Scholar). In both cases the loss of ligand binding could be rescued by reducing the cross-clasped receptors with dithiothreitol (DTT). In contrast, the binding of a fragment of fibronectin (Mr = ∼50 kDa) to the ectodomain of αVβ3 activated by Mn2+ was not associated with receptor extension as judged by electron microscopy (22Adair B.D. Xiong J.P. Maddock C. Goodman S.L. Arnaout M.A. Yeager M. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 168: 1109-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).To understand better the role of αIIb extension around the αIIb genu region in ligand binding, we selectively clamped the αIIb thigh domain to the αIIb calf-1 domain with a newly engineered disulfide bond created by mutating αIIb Arg597 and Tyr645 to cysteine residues. We directly confirmed the formation of the disulfide bond by mass spectrometry and tested the interaction of both large and small ligands to clamped αIIbβ3, as well as both soluble and immobilized ligands. We also tested the effects of multiple αIIbβ3 activation mechanisms, including Mn2+ and coexpression of normal and mutant αIIb with a mutant β3 subunit that when coexpressed with normal αIIb results in spontaneous fibrinogen binding (N339S) (23Cheng M.

Our data support an important role for receptor extension around the genu for the binding of large soluble ligands induced by some, but not all activation mechanisms. In contrast, restricting αIIb extension about the genu had only a modest effect on αIIbβ3-mediated adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen and no discernable effect on the binding of small soluble ligands. These data provide new insight into the contribution of αIIb extension around the genu to high affinity ligand binding."

Leishmania donovani is a protozoan parasite that is the causative agent of visceral leishmaniasis, a debilitating and often fatal disease in humans. Leishmania spp. are digenetic protozoan parasites that exist as flagellated, motile promastigotes within the alimentary tract and salivary glands of their insect vector, members of the Phlebotomine sandfly family and as nonflagellated, amotile amastigotes within macrophages and other reticuloendothelial cells of the mammalian host. No effective vaccines are available for visceral leishmaniasis—or for that matter any disease caused by protozoan parasites, and therefore chemotherapy offers the only means of defense for the treatment and prevention of leishmaniasis and other diseases of parasitic origin. Unfortunately, the current armamentarium of drugs employed against visceral and other forms of leishmaniasis is far from ideal and is adversely affected by toxicity, protracted and invasive routes of administration, and therapeutic unresponsiveness. As a result, there is an acute need for better and more efficacious drugs to combat the disease. The establishment of an efficacious, parasite-specific regimen for the treatment and prophylaxis of leishmaniasis and other diseases of parasitic origin is contingent upon the exploitation of fundamental biochemical or metabolic discrepancies between the parasite and host. Perhaps the most striking metabolic distinction between protozoan parasites and their mammalian hosts are the pathways by which they produce purine nucleotides. Whereas mammalian cells synthesize purine nucleotides from amino acids and other small molecules, protozoan parasites are incapable of synthesizing the purine ring de novo (1Berens R.L. Krug E.C.

Thus, each genus of parasite has evolved a unique complement of purine salvage enzymes that enables the parasite to scavenge preformed purine bases and nucleosides from its host. L. donovani accommodates four enzymes that are capable of converting host purines to the nucleotide level: hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), 2The abbreviations used are: HGPRThypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferaseXPRTxanthine phosphoribosyltransferaseAPRTadenine phosphoribosyltransferasedCF2′-deoxycoformycinDME-LDulbecco's modified Eagle's LeishmaniaFBSfetal bovine serumPBSphosphate-buffered salinePFGEpulse field gel electrophoresisNi-NTAnickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (XPRT), adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT), and adenosine kinase (2Looker D.L.

The construction and characterization of a conditionally lethal Δhgprt/Δxprt null mutant using targeted gene replacement approaches that exhibit patently atypical growth requirements provided powerful genetic evidence for the hypothesis that all salvage of purine nucleobases and nucleosides by L. donovani ultimately occurs through HGPRT or XPRT and that APRT and adenosine kinase are functionally redundant (10Boitz J.M.

Both the conditionally lethal growth phenotype and the infectivity defect of the Δhgprt/Δxprt knock-out can be circumvented genetically by episomal complementation with either HGPRT or XPRT or pharmacologically by maintenance in dCF plus adenine or adenosine as the exogenous purine (10Boitz J.M.

Chem. 2006; 281: 16084-16089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase xanthine phosphoribosyltransferase adenine phosphoribosyltransferase 2′-deoxycoformycin Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Leishmania fetal bovine serum phosphate-buffered saline pulse field gel electrophoresis nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid. We now report that the ability of the Δhgprt/Δxprt double null mutant to infect Balb/c mice, a well characterized rodent model for visceral leishmaniasis (13Mullen A.B. Baillie A.J. Carter K.C.

This virulence deficit, however, is partially ameliorated in Δhgprt/Δxprt parasites that persist through a 4-week infection in mice. To investigate this persistent phenotype further, we isolated second site suppressors of the Δhgprt/Δxprt mutant under controlled circumstances by exposing the knock-out parasites to a variety of nonpermissive growth conditions in vitro. Δhgprt/Δxprt parasites (Δhgprt/Δxprt[Ino/Hyp]) that could be maintained in inosine, hypoxanthine, adenine, or adenosine in the absence of dCF were isolated after two rounds of selection. We determined that the suppressor mechanism by which these Δhgprt/Δxprt[Ino/Hyp] parasites could survive under conditions that were restrictive for the Δhgprt/Δxprt progenitor was amplification and overexpression of the APRT gene. Moreover, the Δhgprt/Δxprt[Ino/Hyp] growth phenotype could be reconstructed by transfection of an episomal APRT construct into the conditional lethal Δhgprt/Δxprt mutant. Further analysis of the Δhgprt/Δxprt parasites that persisted through the mouse infection implied that APRT amplification was also likely operative in parasite persistence in vivo. [8-14C]Adenine (50 mCi/mmol) and [8-14C]hypoxanthine (51 mCi/mmol) were purchased from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). dCF was obtained from the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD). Unlabeled purine bases, nucleosides, and nucleotides, were bought from Sigma-Aldrich and Fisher. Mouse monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody was obtained from Calbiochem/EMD Biosciences Inc. (La Jolla, CA), and anion exchange filters were acquired from Whatman.

Ni-NTA-agarose beads were from Qiagen, whereas the BiosafeTM Coomassie and protein assay kits were procured from Bio-Rad. All other chemicals and reagents were of the highest quality commercially available. The wild type LdBob L. donovani clone (17Goyard S. Segawa H. Gordon J. Showalter M. Duncan R. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 130: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. Stephen Beverley (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). LdBob was derived from the 1S2D strain (18Dwyer D.M. J. Parasitol. 1972; 58: 847-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 19Holbrook T.W. Palczuk N.C. Am. J. Trop. Med. Hyg. 1975; 24: 704-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar) that had been acclimated for growth as axenic amastigotes (17Goyard S. Segawa H. Gordon J. Showalter M. Duncan R. Turco S.J.

Parasitol. 2004; 34: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The construction and characterization of the Δhgprt/Δxprt knock-out clone that was derived from LdBob by targeted gene replacement and its episomally complemented derivative Δhgprt/Δxprt[pXPRT] have been reported previously (10Boitz J.M. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16084-16089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Wild type, Δhgprt/Δxprt, and Δhgprt/Δxprt[pXPRT] promastigotes were cultured at 26 °C, pH 7.4, in purine-replete modified Dulbecco's modified Eagle's Leishmania (DME-L) medium, as detailed (7Boitz J.M. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 148: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), that was supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) or 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (7Boitz J.M. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 148: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Axenic amastigote forms of wild type, Δhgprt/Δxprt, and Δhgprt/Δxprt[pXPRT] parasites were cultured at 37 °C, pH 5.5, in the synthetic medium as described (17Goyard S. Segawa H. Gordon J. Showalter M. Duncan R. Turco S.J. Beverley S.M. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 130: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 20Debrabant A. Joshi M.B. Pimenta P.F. Dwyer D.M. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The Δhgprt/Δxprt clone was routinely maintained as both promastigotes and axenic amastigotes in 100 μm adenine as a purine and 20 μm dCF, whereas the Δhgprt/Δxprt[pXPRT] “add-back” strain was cultured in 100 μm xanthine without dCF and 50 μg/ml blasticidin to maintain selective pressure for episome expression. Single cell cloning protocols for L. donovani promastigotes have been described (21Iovannisci D.M. Ullman B. J. Parasitol. 1983; 69: 633-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Groups of five 7-week-old female Balb/c mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were inoculated by tail vein injection with 5 × 106 of either wild type, Δhgprt/Δxprt, or Δhgprt/Δxprt[pXPRT] stationary phase promastigotes (10Boitz J.M. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16084-16089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 16Boitz J.M. Yates P.A. Kline C. Gaur U. Wilson M.E. Ullman B. Roberts S.C. Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Prior to injection, each L. donovani strain was cycled back and forth several times between promastigote and axenic amastigote forms (20Debrabant A. Joshi M.B. Pimenta P.F. Dwyer D.M. Int. J. Parasitol. 2004; 34: 205-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar) to revitalize ancillary virulence determinants that might have attenuated as a result of prolonged in vitro culture. Four weeks post-infection, the mice were sacrificed, and their livers and spleens were harvested as reported (16Boitz J.M. Yates P.A. Kline C. Gaur U. Wilson M.E. Ullman B. Roberts S.C. Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Single-cell suspensions from the mouse organs were obtained by passage through a 70-μm cell strainer (BD Falcon, Franklin Lakes, NJ), and the parasite burdens were determined in 96-well microtiter plates employing the limiting dilution assay of Buffet et al. (22Buffet P.A. Sulahian A. Garin Y.J. Nassar N. Derouin F. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2167-2168Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). The growth medium in which the organ-derived wild type, Δhgprt/Δxprt, and Δhgprt/Δxprt[pXPRT] parasites were titered was modified DME-L (7Boitz J.M. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 148: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) supplemented with 5% FBS and 100 μm adenine, 100 μm adenine plus 20 μm dCF, or 100 μm xanthine, respectively. Four weeks after harvest, wild type and persistent Δhgprt/Δxprt parasites that survived the initial infection were reinoculated into a naïve group of mice. Fifteen mice were infected with each strain, and three mice from each group were sacrificed at 2-week time intervals beginning at week 2 and ending at week 10. Parasites recovered from livers and spleens after the second round of infection were enumerated as described above, and the 4-week time points from each mouse experiment were compared. Parasite lines that had suppressed the restricted growth phenotype of the Δhgprt/Δxprt null mutant were isolated by plating knock-out cells under nonpermissive growth conditions, i.e. in a 6-oxypurine source in the absence of dCF, as follows. 5 × 107 Δhgprt/Δxprt promastigotes were plated on semi-solid DME-L medium containing either adenine, adenosine, hypoxanthine, inosine, guanine, guanosine, xanthine, or xanthosine, all at 100 μm concentrations, and supplemented with 20% dialyzed FBS. dCF was omitted in these selective platings. Four clones, designated Δhgprt/Δxprt[Ino], were picked from the inosine plates and expanded in modified DME-L containing 100 μm inosine and 5% FBS. Two of the Δhgprt/Δxprt[Ino] clones were then replated on semi-solid modified DME-L medium supplemented with 20% dialyzed FBS and 100 μm purine in the absence of dCF. After this second round of selection, six clones were isolated from the plates containing 100 μm hypoxanthine as the exclusive purine. These cells were designated Δhgprt/Δxprt[Ino/Hyp]. To assess the abilities of the wild type, Δhgprt/Δxprt, Δhgprt/Δxprt[Ino], and Δhgprt/Δxprt[Ino/Hyp] promastigotes to grow in different purine sources, exponentially growing parasites were washed several times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended at a density of 5 × 104 cells/ml in 1.0-ml aliquots of modified DME-L (7Boitz J.M. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 148: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) containing 100 μm purine and 5% dialyzed FBS, and dispensed into wells of 24-well tissue culture plates (Sarstedt Inc., Newton, NC). After 7–10 days, the parasites were enumerated by hemocytometer. Peritoneal macrophages from Balb/c mice were harvested 5 days after induction by thioglycollate injection (16Boitz J.M. Yates P.A. Kline C. Gaur U. Wilson M.E. Ullman B. Roberts S.C. Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), washed twice in PBS, and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 4 mm l-glutamine, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 4.5 g/liter glucose, and 10% FBS. 2 × 105 macrophages/well were allowed to adhere for ∼12 h at 37 °C to 4-well Lab-TekII chamber slides and then washed once with PBS and replenished with fresh growth medium. Stationary phase wild type, Δhgprt/Δxprt, and Δhgprt/Δxprt[Ino/Hyp] promastigotes were washed twice in PBS and resuspended in macrophage medium, and 2 × 106 parasites were added to each chamber slide well of adherent macrophages and incubated at 37 °C. Residual extracellular promastigotes were removed by gently washing the macrophages three times with PBS 12 h post-infection. The macrophages were rinsed with PBS, and their growth medium was changed daily. After 72 h the macrophages were washed, stained, and enumerated as described (7Boitz J.M. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 148: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 16Boitz J.M. Yates P.A. Kline C. Gaur U. Wilson M.E. Ullman B. Roberts S.C. Infect. Immun. 2009; 77: 756-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The ability of intact parasites to convert [8-14C]hypoxanthine into purine nucleotides was determined by the DE-81 filter disk method of Iovannisci et al. (8Iovannisci D.M. Goebel D. Allen K. Kaur K. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14617-14623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, L. donovani promastigotes were harvested by centrifugation, washed twice in PBS, and resuspended at a density of 1.0 × 108 cells/ml in 1.0 ml of a modified DME-L medium containing 2 μm [8-14C]hypoxanthine (51 mCi/mmol) but lacking albumin, FBS, and hemin. At each time point, 1.0 × 107 parasites were removed, washed once in ice cold PBS, lysed in 50 μl of 1% Triton X-100, and spotted onto a DE-81 filter disk (8Iovannisci D.M. Goebel D. Allen K. Kaur K. Ullman B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14617-14623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The disks were processed as described (6Hwang H.Y. Ullman B. J. Biol.

Monospecific polyclonal antibodies raised against purified recombinant L. donovani APRT, HGPRT, and XPRT proteins in rabbits have been described previously (23Allen T. Hwang H.Y. Wilson K. Hanson S.

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 9.31-9.57Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-α-tubulin antibody (DM1A) produced in mice was obtained from EMD Chemicals (Gibbstown, NJ). Goat anti-rabbit and goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific Pierce Protein Research Products (Rockford, IL). Isolation of genomic DNA and Southern blot analysis were accomplished using conventional protocols (26Sambrook J. Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed.

The immunofluorescence assay was carried out as described (27Zarella-Boitz J.M. Rager N. Jardim A. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2004; 134: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 28Shih S. Hwang H.Y. Carter D. Stenberg P. Ullman B. J. Biol.

The cells were visualized on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope (Carl Zeiss Microimaging, Thornwood, NY) employing 60× oil immersion light and photographed with an AxioCam MRm camera (Zeiss). Axiovision 4.2 software was used to photograph the images. The APRT open reading frame was amplified by PCR from the previously described [pXG-BSD-APRT] episome (7Boitz J.M. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 148: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and inserted into the bacterial expression vector ChampionTM pET200/D-TOPO® that automatically attaches a His6 tag to the NH2 terminus of the inserted gene product. The forward primer that was used to amplify APRT included the sequence CACC before the APRT ATG start codon to allow directional cloning into the pET200/D-TOPO® vector. The amplified DNA construct was then sequenced bidirectionally to ensure the fidelity of the PCR amplification. The chimeric construct was transformed into BL21 StarTM One Shot® E. coli, and the bacterial culture was induced with 1.0 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to synthesize APRT protein from the plasmid as described (29Galazka J. Striepen B. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 149: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). His6-tagged L. donovani APRT was purified by affinity chromatography over a Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) column from E. coli extracts that were prepared by means of a French press as described (29Galazka J. Striepen B. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 149: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) except that the concentration of imidazole in the final wash buffer was increased from 20 to 30 mm. Recombinant LdAPRT was eluted from the Ni-NTA-agarose with 250 mm imidazole as detailed (29Galazka J. Striepen B. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 149: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Separation of the purified recombinant APRT fractions on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subsequent staining with Bio-safeTM Coomassie (Bio-Rad) confirmed the purity of the recombinant protein. A Thermo Labsystems Multiskan Ascent plate reader was employed at 600 nm to determine the protein concentration and yield of the purified APRT after the addition of Bio-Rad Protein Assay reagent (29Galazka J. Striepen B. Ullman B. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2006; 149: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The catalytic activity of purified recombinant APRT protein was ascertained immediately following purification. To determine the linear rate of conversion of hypoxanthine to IMP, 10 μg of purified, recombinant LdAPRT was added to reaction buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phosphoribosylpyrophosphate, and 57 μm [8-14C]hypoxanthine (51 mCi/mmol). The final reaction volume was 35 μl. At each time point over a 2-h time course, 5-μl aliquots were mixed with 2 μl of glacial acetic acid to terminate the reaction (30Kidder G.W. Dewey V.C. Nolan L.L. Arch Biochem. Biophys. 1977; 183: 7-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), spotted onto a Whatman PE SIL G silica gel TLC plate, and developed in dioxane/ammonium hydroxide/water 6:1:5 (v/v/v) (31Sillero M.A. Socorro S.

https://openalex.org/W2114777608,"It is suggested that histone modifications and/or histone variants influence the nucleosomal DNA length. We sequenced both ends of mononucleosomal and dinucleosomal DNA fragments of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus fumigatus, after treatment with the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA). After mapping the DNA fragments to the genome, we identified >7 million mononucleosome positions and >7 million dinucleosome positions. We showed that the distributions of the lengths of the mononucleosomal DNA fragments after 15-min and 30-min treatments with micrococcal nuclease (MNase) showed a single peak at 168 nt and 160 nt, respectively. The distributions of the lengths of the dinucleosomal DNA fragments after 15-min- and 30-min-treatment with MNase showed a single peak at 321 nt and 306 nt, respectively. The nucleosomal DNA fragments obtained from the TSA-treated cells were significantly longer than those obtained from the untreated cells. On the other hand, most of the genes did not undergo any change after treatment. Between the TSA-treated and untreated cells, only 77 genes had ≥2-fold change in expression levels. In addition, our results showed that the locations where mononucleosomes were frequently detected were conserved between the TSA-treated cells and untreated cells in the gene promoters (lower density of the nucleosomes). However, these locations were less conserved in the bodies (higher density of the nucleosomes) of genes with ≥2-fold changes. Our findings indicate that TSA influences the nucleosome positions, especially of the regions with high density of the nucleosomes by elongation of the nucleosomal DNA. However, most of the nucleosome positions are conserved in the gene promoters, even after treatment with TSA, because of the low density of nucleosomes in the gene promoters."
