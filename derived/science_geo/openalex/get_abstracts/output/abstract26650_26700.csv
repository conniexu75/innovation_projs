https://openalex.org/W1515518093,"A new transient expression system has been developed to investigate the function of anion exchangers in vivo. Human 293 cells were cotransfected with AE2 or AE3 cDNA together with a plasmid encoding a cell surface marker protein. Staining of the cells with antibody directed against a cell surface epitope present in the marker protein permitted the detection of cells expressing functional anion exchangers. Intracellular pH (pHi) recording in individual transfectants loaded with the fluorescent pHi indicator, 2',7'-bis(carboxyethyl)-5,6-carboxyfluorescein, was used to determine the flux of HCO3- as a measure of Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity. Cells expressing either anion exchanger displayed significantly enhanced Cl-/HCO3- exchange activity compared with controls expressing only the marker. Transfection with either anion exchanger or with control plasmid resulted in altered intrinsic buffering capacity profiles compared with untransfected controls. Expression of either AE2 or AE3 did not result in changes in resting pHi. The activities of both AE2 and AE3 were stimulated at alkaline pHi, suggesting that an internal protonation site in AE2 and AE3 may regulate their activities. Both exchangers were inhibited reversibly and irreversibly by the anion 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonate with IC50 values of 142 and 0.43 microM for AE2 and AE3, respectively. These data indicate that structural differences in these highly conserved anion exchangers give rise to differences in affinities at the external anion binding site."
https://openalex.org/W1509772502,"The mechanism of plasminogen activation by recombinant staphylokinase was studied both in the absence and in the presence of fibrin, in purified systems, and in human plasma. Staphylokinase, like streptokinase, forms a stoichiometric complex with plasminogen that activates plasminogen following Michaelis-Menten kinetics with Km = 7.0 microM and k2 = 1.5 s-1. In purified systems, alpha 2-antiplasmin inhibits the plasminogen-staphylokinase complex with k1(app) = 2.7 +/- 0.30 x 10(6) M-1 s-1 (mean +/- S.D., n = 12), but not the plasminogen-streptokinase complex. Addition of 6-aminohexanoic acid induces a concentration-dependent reduction of k1(app) to 2.0 +/- 0.17 x 10(4) M-1 s-1 (mean +/- S.D., n = 5) at concentrations greater than or equal to 30 mM, with a 50% reduction at a 6-aminohexanoic acid concentration of 60 microM. Staphylokinase does not bind to fibrin, and fibrin stimulates the initial rate of plasminogen activation by staphylokinase only 4-fold. Staphylokinase induces a dose-dependent lysis of a 0.12-ml 125I-fibrin-labeled human plasma clot submersed in 0.5 ml of citrated human plasma; 50% lysis in 2 h is obtained with 17 nM staphylokinase and is associated with only 5% plasma fibrinogen degradation. Corresponding values for streptokinase are 68 nM and more than 90% fibrinogen degradation. In the absence of a fibrin clot, 50% fibrinogen degradation in human plasma in 2 h requires 790 nM staphylokinase, but only 4.4 nM streptokinase. These results suggest the following mechanism for relatively fibrin-specific clot lysis with staphylokinase in a plasma milieu. In plasma in the absence of fibrin, the plasminogen-staphylokinase complex is rapidly neutralized by alpha 2-antiplasmin, thus preventing systemic plasminogen activation. In the presence of fibrin, the lysine-binding sites of the plasminogen-staphylokinase complex are occupied and inhibition by alpha 2-antiplasmin is retarded, thus allowing preferential plasminogen activation at the fibrin surface."
https://openalex.org/W1496600075,"In eukaryotes, both natural and engineered fusions of ubiquitin to itself or other proteins are cleaved by processing proteases after the last (Gly76) residue of ubiquitin. Using the method of sib selection, and taking advantage of the fact that bacteria such as Escherichia coli lack ubiquitin-specific enzymes, we have cloned a gene, named UBP1, of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that encodes a ubiquitin-specific processing protease. With the exception of polyubiquitin, the UBP1 protease cleaves at the carboxyl terminus of the ubiquitin moiety in natural and engineered fusions irrespective of their size or the presence of an amino-terminal ubiquitin extension. These properties of UBP1 distinguish it from the previously cloned yeast protease YUH1, which deubiquitinates relatively short ubiquitin fusions but is virtually inactive with longer fusions such as ubiquitin-beta-galactosidase. The amino acid sequence of the 809-residue UBP1 lacks significant similarities to other known proteins, including the 236-residue YUH1 protease. Null ubp1 mutants are viable, and retain the ability to deubiquitinate ubiquitin-beta-galactosidase, indicating that the family of ubiquitin-specific proteases in yeast is not limited to UBP1 and YUH1."
https://openalex.org/W1659681861,"Replication protein A (RP-A) is a three-subunit single-stranded DNA-binding protein that has been isolated from human cells. RP-A is essential for SV40 DNA replication and may also be important in genetic recombination. The sequence of a cDNA encoding the 70-kDa subunit of human RP-A is reported. The 616-amino acid predicted open reading frame of the human protein is 31% identical with the 621-amino acid open reading frame of the 70-kDa subunit of RP-A from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Both proteins share a highly conserved putative metal binding domain of the 4-cysteine type. The human cDNA directs production in Escherichia coli of a 70-kDa protein that reacts with a monoclonal antibody directed against the 70-kDa subunit of human RP-A. The recombinant 70-kDa subunit, purified from bacteria, exhibits single-stranded DNA binding activity comparable to that of the complete RP-A complex. The 70-kDa subunit is able to substitute for the complete human RP-A complex in stimulating the activity of DNA polymerase alpha-primase on a poly(dA).oligo(dT) template. However, the 70-kDa subunit alone cannot substitute for the complete RP-A complex in SV40 DNA replication in vitro, suggesting an important functional role for the other subunits."

https://openalex.org/W1599008976,"The conversion of androgens to estrogens is catalyzed by an enzyme complex named aromatase, which consists of a form of cytochrome P-450, aromatase cytochrome P-450 (cytochrome P-450AROM), and the flavoprotein, NADPH-cytochrome P-450 reductase. As a first step toward investigation of the structure-function relationships of cytochrome P-450AROM, we have used computer modeling to align the amino acid sequence of cytochrome P-450AROM with that of cytochrome P-450CAM from Pseudomonas putida and thus create a substrate pocket using the heme-binding region and the I-helix of cytochrome P-450CAM as the template. Site-directed mutagenesis was then carried out at two sites: one at a region that aligns with the bend in the I-helix of cytochrome P-450CAM and the other at a glutamate (Glu302) just N-terminal of this bend, which is predicted to be in close proximity to the C2-position of the androstenedione substrate. To determine the importance of the former region, three mutants were constructed: A307G (Ala307----Gly), P308V (Pro308----Val), and GAGV, which changed -Ile305-Ala306-Ala307-Pro308- to -Gly-Ala-Gly-Val- (the corresponding sequence found in 17 alpha-hydroxylase cytochrome P-450). When these proteins were expressed in COS-1 cells, it was found that the activity of P308V was approximately one-third that of the wild type. These observations are consistent with the concept that Pro308 causes a bend in the I-helix of cytochrome P-450AROM, similar to that observed in cytochrome P-450CAM, which is believed to be important in forming the substrate-binding pocket. The next set of mutants were designed to determine the importance of Glu302 in catalysis. Four mutants were prepared in which Glu302 was changed either to Ala, Val, Gln, or Asp, and the activities of the expressed proteins were examined. It was found that mutations in which the carboxylic acid was replaced were essentially devoid of activity. On the other hand, changing Glu302 to Asp resulted in a two-thirds reduction in the apparent Vmax. These results support the role of a carboxylic acid residue at position 302 in the catalytic activity of cytochrome P-450AROM."
https://openalex.org/W1552003657,"Their cDNA-derived amino acid sequences predict that the 80-kDa subunits of the micromolar and millimolar Ca(2+)-requiring forms of the Ca(2+)-dependent proteinase (mu- and m-calpain, respectively) each consist of four domains and that the 28-kDa subunit common to both mu- and m-calpain consists of two domains. The calpains were allowed to autolyze to completion, and the autolysis products were separated and were characterized by using gel permeation chromatography, calpastatin affinity chromatography, and sequence analysis. Three major fragments were obtained after autolysis of either calpain. The largest fragment (34 kDa for mu-calpain, 35 kDa for m-calpain) contains all of domain II, the catalytic domain, plus part of domain I of the 80-kDa subunit of mu- or m-calpain. This fragment does not bind to calpastatin, a competitive inhibitor of the calpains, and has no proteolytic activity in either the absence or presence of Ca2+. The second major fragment (21 kDa for mu-calpain and 22 kDa for m-calpain) contains domain IV, the calmodulin-like domain, plus approximately 50 amino acids from domain III of the 80-kDa subunit of mu- or m-calpain. The third major fragment (18 kDa) contains domain VI, the calmodulin-like domain of the 28-kDa subunit. The second and third major fragments bind to a calpastatin affinity column in the presence of Ca2+ and are eluted with EDTA. The second and third fragments are noncovalently bound, so the 80- and 28-kDa subunits of the intact calpain molecules are noncovalently bound at domains IV and VI. After separation in 1 M NaSCN, the 28-kDa subunit binds completely to calpastatin, approximately 30-40% of the 80-kDa subunit of mu-calpain binds to calpastatin, and the 80-kDa subunit of m-calpain does not bind to calpastatin in the presence of 1 mM Ca2+."
https://openalex.org/W1654383467,"The structure of the gene encoding a chicken liver receptor, the chicken hepatic lectin, which mediates endocytosis of glycoproteins has been established. The coding sequence is divided into six exons separated by five introns. The first three exons correspond to separate functional domains of the receptor polypeptide (cytoplasmic tail, transmembrane sequence, and extracellular neck region), while the final three exons encode the Ca(2+)-dependent carbohydrate-recognition domain. These results, as well as computer-assisted multiple sequence comparisons, establish this receptor as the evolutionary homolog of the mammalian asialoglycoprotein receptors. It is interesting that the chicken receptor falls into a subfamily of proteins along with the mammalian asialoglycoprotein receptors, since the saccharide-binding specificity of the chicken receptor resembles more closely that of a different set of calcium-dependent animal lectins, which includes the mannose-binding proteins. The portions of the genes encoding the carbohydrate-recognition domains of these proteins lack introns. The results suggest that divergence of intron-containing and intron-lacking carbohydrate-recognition domains preceded shuffling events in which other functional domains were associated with the carbohydrate-recognition domains. This was followed by further divergence, generating a variety of saccharide-binding specificities."
https://openalex.org/W1495814806,"The nature of disulfide-linked structures of apolipoprotein (apo) E3 in the plasma of E3/3 subjects was examined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis performed under nonreducing conditions followed by immunoblotting with apoE-specific antibodies. In addition to the expected presence of the heterodimer apoE3-A-II and monomeric apoE3, a band with an apparent Mr approximately 100,000 was also observed in plasma that had been treated with sulfhydryl-trapping reagents. This band and apoE3-A-II were both eliminated by disulfide reduction, which produced a corresponding increase in monomeric apoE3. Both bands were absent in plasma from a subject with the E4/4 phenotype. In spite of its apparent molecular weight on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the high molecular weight band was demonstrated to represent the disulfide-linked homodimer of apoE3. It was isolated from purified apoE3 preparations that had undergone oxygen-mediated dimerization and shown to elute from a Sephacryl S-300 column in a position with the expected molecular weight of a homodimer. The apoE3 dimer displayed a preference for high density lipoproteins, as determined by agarose chromatography of E3/3 plasma but was stripped from high density lipoproteins by ultracentrifugation. Quantitation of the relative ratios of homodimer, apoE3-A-II, and monomer in the plasma of 22 normolipidemic E3/3 subjects by immunoblotting revealed that the disulfide-linked structures accounted for the majority (approximately 55%) of plasma apoE. Both the homodimer and apoE3-A-II displayed a reduced ability to compete with low density lipoproteins for fibroblast low density lipoprotein receptors (20 and 30% of monomeric apoE3 binding activity, respectively). These results raise the possibility that the amount or availability of receptor-active apoE3 in E3/3 subjects may be rate limiting for metabolic events involving the low density lipoprotein receptor."
https://openalex.org/W1569546742,"A new method for photoaffinity labeling of glucose transporters has been used to compare the effects of glucose-starvation, acute-insulin, and chronic-insulin treatments on the cell-surface glucose transporters in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Starvation alone increased the cell-surface levels of GLUT1 and GLUT4 by approximately 4- and approximately 2-fold, respectively. As shown by Calderhead, D, M., Kitagawa, K., Tanner, L.T., Holman, G.D., and Lienhard, G.E. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 13800-13808) acute-insulin treatment increased cell-surface GLUT1 and GLUT4 by approximately 5- and approximately 15-fold respectively. In contrast to this, chronic-insulin treatment gave a further 3-4-fold increase in both cell-surface and total cellular GLUT1, but availability of GLUT4 at the cell-surface was down-regulated to half the level found in the acute treatment but with no change in the total cellular level. This effect occurred in starved and non-starved cells and suggests that starvation, acute-insulin, and chronic-insulin treatments regulate glucose transporter availability through independent mechanisms. The down-regulation of GLUT4 reached a maximally reduced cell-surface level in 6 h while the rise in GLUT1 reached a maximum after 24-48 h. The rise in GLUT1 appeared to compensate for the decline in cell-surface GLUT4 as glucose transport activity was further increased during the long term treatment with insulin. The down-regulation of GLUT4 due to the chronic-insulin treatment is associated with a marked resistance of the cells to restimulate glucose transport and particularly to recruit further GLUT4 to the cell-surface following an additional insulin treatment. The defect appears to be in the signaling mechanism that is responsible for translocation."
https://openalex.org/W1498869258,"In a previous report (Langner, C. A., Birkenmeier, E. H., Ben-Zeev, O., Schotz, M. C., Sweet, H. O., Davisson, M. T., and Gordon, J. I. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 7994-8003), we characterized the early developmental phenotype of mice that were homozygous for the autosomal recessive fatty liver dystrophy (fld) mutation. Shortly after birth, these mice can be distinguished from their +/? littermates by large pale livers, hypertriglyceridemia, elevations in hepatic apolipoprotein A-IV and apoC-II mRNA levels, and tissue-specific decreases in lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase activities. These traits resolve by the early weaning period. We have now characterized a second feature of this mutation: a peripheral neuropathy that becomes manifest by an abnormal gait at the end of the second postnatal week and persists through adulthood. Electron microscopic studies of sciatic nerves from 4-day-to 1-year-old fld/fld mice demonstrated a variety of abnormalities including thin, poorly compacted myelin sheaths, active myelin breakdown, and enlarged Schwann cell mitochondria and nuclei. Western blot analysis of sciatic nerve homogenates prepared from 1 to 3-month-old fld/fld mice and their +/? littermates indicated that homozygous animals have striking reductions in two peripheral nerve myelin-associated proteins, P0 and P2. The steady-state level of apoE, a protein induced during nerve regeneration, is markedly elevated. Furthermore, two axon-specific proteins, neurofilament 68K and growth-associated 43 protein, display altered expression in adult fld/fld sciatic nerves. High performance thin-layer chromatography revealed deficiencies in phospholipids, glycosphingolipids, and some neutral lipids in fld/fld sciatic nerves harvested during the first several months of life (compared to their +/? littermates). Cholesterol esters were elevated in homozygotes. By contrast, no differences in brain lipids were noted between fld/fld animals and their +/? littermates. These data suggest that the fld mutation is associated with an abnormality of myelin formation (dysmyelination) as well as demyelination and axonal degeneration that persists despite apparent resolution of the neonatal hypertriglyceridemia and associated lipase abnormalities. These findings establish the fld/fld mouse as an excellent model system for analyzing homeostatic mechanisms that modulate lipid metabolism in newborn mice and for examining the pathogenesis of peripheral neuropathies associated with dyslipidemias."

https://openalex.org/W1557051865,"Valyl-tRNA synthetase from mammalian cells is isolated in a high Mr complex with elongation factor 1 (EF-1). This complex, which represents all of the valyl-tRNA synthetase activity and a significant portion of the EF-1 activity in rabbit reticulocytes, contains five polypeptides identified as valyl-tRNA synthetase and the four subunits of EF-1. In this study, we have examined the potential for regulation of the complex by phosphorylation of these components. The valyl-tRNA synthetase.EF-1 complex has been purified by gel filtration and tRNA-Sepharose chromatography from 32P-labeled rabbit reticulocytes stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and compared to the complex purified from control cells. One- and two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography show that valyl-tRNA synthetase and the alpha, beta and delta subunits of EF-1 are phosphorylated in vivo. Phosphorylation of each of the four proteins is increased 2-4-fold in response to PMA. Phosphorylation of valyl-tRNA synthetase in response to PMA is reproducibly accompanied by a 1.7-fold increase in aminoacylation activity, whereas phosphorylation of EF-1 is associated with a 2.0-2.2-fold stimulation of activity, as measured by poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis. These data suggest that stimulation of translational rates in response to PMA is mediated, at least in part, by phosphorylation of valyl-tRNA synthetase and EF-1."
https://openalex.org/W1565483499,"Although amino-terminal transit peptides of chloroplastic precursor proteins are known to be necessary and sufficient for import into chloroplasts, the mechanism by which they mediate this process is not understood. Another important question is whether different precursors share a common transport apparatus. We used 20-residue synthetic peptides corresponding to regions of the transit peptide of the precursor to the small subunit of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (prSS) as competitive inhibitors for the binding and translocation of precursor proteins into chloroplasts. Synthetic peptides with sequences corresponding to either end of the transit peptide had little to no effect on binding of prSS to chloroplasts, but significantly inhibited its translocation. Synthetic peptides corresponding to the central region of the transit peptide inhibited binding of prSS to chloroplasts. Each of the peptides inhibited binding or translocation of precursors to light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b protein, ferredoxin, and plastocyanin in the same manner and to a similar extent as prSS transport was inhibited. The results presented in this paper suggest that the central regions of the transit peptide of prSS mediate binding to the chloroplastic surface, whereas the ends of this transit peptide are more important for translocation across the envelope. Furthermore, all of the precursors tested appear to share components in the transport apparatus even though they are sorted to different chloroplastic compartments."
https://openalex.org/W1620334800,"Chromatin assembly factor I (CAF-I) is a multisubunit protein complex purified from the nuclei of human cells and required for chromatin assembly during DNA replication in vitro. Purified CAF-I promotes chromatin assembly in a reaction that is dependent upon, and coupled with, DNA replication and is therefore likely to reflect events that occur during S phase in vivo. In order to investigate the regulation and mechanism of CAF-I and the replication-dependent chromatin assembly process, we have used the purified protein to raise monoclonal antibodies. In this report we describe the characterization of a panel of monoclonal antibodies which recognize different subunits of the CAF-I complex. We use immunoprecipitation analysis to show that CAF-I exists as a multiprotein complex in vivo and that some of the polypeptides are phosphorylated. In addition, immunocytochemistry demonstrates that CAF-I is localized to the nucleus of human cells. Finally, monoclonal antibodies directed against the individual subunits of CAF-I immunodeplete chromatin assembly activity from nuclear extracts, confirming that CAF-I is a multisubunit protein required for chromatin assembly in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W1573106545,"An enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae which removes the splice junction 2'-phosphate from ligated tRNA appears to require NAD+. This two-component enzyme has been previously implicated in tRNA splicing because of its specificity for substrates bearing an internal 2'-phosphate and because of the absence of other observed proteins that can efficiently catalyze the same activity after fractionation of the extracts. We show here that component I of this enzyme is heat-stable, chromatographs as a small molecule, can be substituted efficiently by NAD+, and comigrates with NAD+ on a reversed-phase column. Dephosphorylation of ligated tRNA in the presence of component I or NAD+ is accompanied by stoichiometric transfer of the splice junction 2'-phosphate to an unidentified acceptor molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1582531808,"Small mammals, including human infants, rely on nonshivering thermogenesis for a substantial portion of their body heat during exposure to cold. This thermogenesis is mediated in large part by the uncoupling protein, which is found exclusively within the inner membrane of brown adipose tissue mitochondria. The sole function of uncoupling protein is to provide a regulated transport pathway for electrophoretic back-flux of H+ ions into the mitochondrial matrix, thereby dissipating the protonmotive force and producing heat. Thus, uncoupling protein is unique with respect to both its physiological role and its tissue expression. We have now achieved high level expression of rat uncoupling protein in yeast, with import into yeast mitochondria at levels, 70-100 micrograms/mg of mitochondrial protein, similar to those observed in brown adipose tissue mitochondria from cold-adapted rats. When the expressed protein was purified and reconstituted into liposomes, the proteoliposomes exhibited GDP-sensitive proton and chloride uniports that were inhibited by GDP with Ki values similar to those obtained with native protein. Moreover, the molecular activities of the expressed protein with respect to Cl- and H+ transport were indistinguishable from those of native protein. The availability of unlimited amounts of functional, expressed uncoupling protein will now permit application of site-directed mutagenesis to the many intriguing aspects of uncoupling protein structure and function."
https://openalex.org/W1546533992,"Infusion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) into tumor-bearing mice led to intravascular clot formation with fibrin deposition in microvessels in the tumor bed in close association with the vessel wall, which could be prevented by active site-blocked factor IXa (IXai). This observation prompted us to examine the role of the intrinsic system in activation of the coagulation mechanism on TNF-stimulated human endothelial cell monolayers and endothelial-derived matrix during exposure to purified coagulation factors or flowing blood. Treatment of endothelial cells in intact monolayers with TNF induced expression of the procoagulant cofactor tissue factor (TF) in a dose-dependent manner, and after removal of the cells, TF was present in the matrix. TNF-treated endothelial cell monolayers exposed to blood anticoagulated with low molecular weight heparin induced activation of coagulation. Addition of IXai blocked the procoagulant response on TNF-treated endothelial cells, and consistent with this, the presence of factor IX/VIIIa enhanced endothelial TF/factor VII(a) factor X activation over a wide range of cytokine concentrations (0-600 pM). When TF-dependent factor X activation on endothelial cells was compared with preparations of subendothelium, the extracellular matrix was 10-20 times more effective. IXai blocked TF/factor VII(a) mediated activated coagulation on matrix, but only at lower concentration of TNF (less than 50 pM). Similarly, enhancement of factor Xa formation on matrix by factors IX/VIIIa was most evident at lower TNF concentrations. When anticoagulated whole blood flowing with a shear of 300 s-1 was exposed to matrices from TNF-treated endothelial cells, but not matrices from control cells, fibrinopeptide A (FPA) generation, fibrin deposition, and platelet aggregate formation were observed. FPA generation could be prevented by a blocking antibody to TF and by active site-blocked factor Xa (Xai) over a wide range of TNF concentrations (0-600 pM), whereas IXai only blocked FPA generation at lower TNF concentrations (less than 50 pM). Activation of coagulation on matrix from TNF-stimulated endothelial cells was dependent on the presence of platelets, indicating the important role of platelets in propagating the reactions leading to fibrin formation. These observations demonstrate the potential of cytokine-stimulated endothelium and their matrix to activate coagulation and suggest the importance of the intrinsic system in factor Xa formation on cellular surfaces."
https://openalex.org/W1602397769,"Previous studies have shown that vascular endothelial cells exhibit a highly active Na-K-Cl cotransport system that is regulated by a variety of vasoactive hormones and neurotransmitters, suggesting that the cotransporter may play an important role in endothelial cell function. In this study, the regulation of endothelial cell Na-K-Cl cotransport was further investigated by probing the stimulus-transfer pathway by which vasoactive agents stimulate the cotransporter. Specifically, three peptides previously shown to stimulate cotransport activity (angiotensin II, vasopressin, and bradykinin) were evaluated. Na-K-Cl cotransport was assessed in cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells as bumetanide-sensitive K+ influx. Stimulation of Na-K-Cl cotransport by angiotensin II, vasopressin, or bradykinin was found to be reduced either by removal of extracellular Ca2+ or by treatment of the cells with 8-(N,N-diethylamino)octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate or 1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid. In addition, the calmodulin antagonist W-7 was found to prevent stimulation of endothelial cell Na-K-Cl cotransport by the three peptides. These findings suggest that regulation of endothelial cell cotransport by these vasoactive peptides may be both Ca(2+)- and calmodulin-dependent. Angiotensin II, vasopressin, and bradykinin were also found to elevate phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis in the cultured endothelial cells. Thus, the possibility that regulation of endothelial Na-K-Cl cotransport by these vasoactive peptides also involves diacylglycerol activation of protein kinase C was investigated. A 10-min exposure of the endothelial cells to low doses of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was found to reduce Na-K-Cl cotransport whether in the presence or absence of angiotensin II, vasopressin, or bradykinin. However, down-regulation of protein kinase C by a 40-h exposure to higher doses of the phorbol ester was found to elevate Na-K-Cl cotransport activity under both control and agonist-stimulated conditions, indicating that activation of protein kinase C results in inhibition of endothelial cell Na-K-Cl cotransport. Thus, protein kinase C activation may serve as negative feedback in the stimulus-transfer pathway by which these agonists regulate endothelial cell Na-K-Cl cotransport."
https://openalex.org/W1549860184,"To clarify the molecular structures of nonspecific cross-reacting antigens (NCAs), a family of glycoproteins antigenically related to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), in human granulocytes, we have screened a cDNA library of human leukocytes using a cDNA probe for the N-terminal domain (domain-N) of NCA-50, an NCA species in tumor cells. In 95 positive clones randomly selected, we identified six NCA or NCA-related cDNA clones including NCA-50, biliary glycoprotein protein a, and W272 (CGM6) which have previously been reported, and three new clones, W236, W264, and W282, encoding three novel NCA species. W236 and W264 consist of a domain-N, a putative transmembrane domain, and a possible cytoplasmic domain. The domain-N of W264 is 89% similar to that of NCA-50 at amino acid level, whereas the domain-N of W236 is only 49 and 43% similar to those of NCA-50 and pregnancy-specific beta 1-glycoprotein-11 (PSG11), respectively, indicating that W236 belongs to a new subfamily within the CEA family. The third clone W282 encodes a protein consisting of a domain-N virtually identical to that of W264 and a short hydrophilic C-terminal domain. W264 and W282 seem to be derived from a single gene by alternative splicing of RNA. These three new species are particularly unique in respect that they lack the repetitive immunoglobulin-related domains that have been universally found in the human CEA gene family members. The biochemical and immunochemical properties of the recombinant proteins of these cDNA clones, however, did not coincide with those of six NCA species previously identified in granulocytes at protein level, suggesting that, in granulocytes, there exist at least 12 NCA or NCA-related species whose expression is under complex control."
https://openalex.org/W1638364901,"Cis-5 double bond in a fatty acid or when encountered through the beta-oxidation of an odd-numbered double-bond unsaturated fatty acid presents as a metabolic block to the further beta-oxidation. Cis-5-fatty acyl-CoA cannot be beta-oxidized to cis-3-enoyl-CoA as suggested by the conventional pathway. Instead, this metabolic block can only be removed through an NADPH-dependent reduction of 5-enoyl-CoA, possibly mediated by a 5-enoyl-CoA reductase. In the case of oleic acid two cycles of beta-oxidation yield cis-5-tetradecenoyl-CoA. This intermediate is then reduced to tetradecanoyl-CoA, which is metabolized further via normal beta-oxidation cycles. The conventional pathway through cis-3-dodecenoyl-CoA does not operate in rat liver."
https://openalex.org/W1543772844,"The promoter of the human gamma-globin gene confers tissue specificity as well as developmental stage specificity to gamma gene expression. Earlier work in our laboratory suggested that a fragment of the gamma-globin promoter between -300 and -137 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site contributed to the developmental specificity of the promoter. In this paper, we have mapped potential regulatory elements within this upstream region of the gamma promoter by a combination of in vitro DNA-protein binding assays and functional determinations of promoter strength in transient expression studies. Four sites between -300 and -130 bind proteins present in nuclear extracts of erythroid and non-erythroid cell lines. Mutation of these binding sites by internal base substitution determined that three of the four influence overall promoter strength in transient assays. We have focused on two protein binding sites, -246 to -212 and -195 to -170, that have been reported to bind erythroid-specific factors. The erythroid binding protein NF-E1 and a ubiquitous octamer protein footprint the -195 to -170 site. While internal mutation of this site did not significantly alter promoter strength, a point mutation at position -175 that is associated with hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin increased the activity of a promoter construct 20-fold in erythroid cells. A detailed mutational analysis of this site suggests that NF-E1 binding is necessary but not sufficient for activation of the promoter by the -175 mutation, and we propose that a second protein or co-activator is required. The nucleotides between -246 and -212 appear to bind a complex of at least three proteins, at the core of which is a protein binding to a string of dA:dT residues. This complex also appears to form on the 3' A gamma-globin enhancer, and homologous sites have been identified within the locus activating region of the beta-globin cluster, suggesting that this element may mediate long range interactions with distant regulatory elements."
https://openalex.org/W1531911432,"The catalytic core protomer of calf thymus DNA polymerase delta (pol delta) was purified to apparent homogeneity by a modified procedure, and its enzymologic mechanism was investigated using a combination of steady-state kinetics and semiquantitative sedimentation binding analyses. Like DNA polymerase alpha (pol alpha), in the absence of a primer, pol delta was able to bind single-stranded but not double-stranded DNA. This, in conjunction with the observation of induced substrate (dNTP) inhibition of pol delta in the presence of a correctly base-paired 2',3'-dideoxyribonucleotide-terminated primer, suggests that pol delta follows an ordered sequential ter-reactant mechanism of substrate recognition and binding similar to that elucidated for pol alpha. Pol delta binds template first followed by primer and then template-directed dNTP. With suitable substrates, addition to incubations of proliferating cell nuclear antigen, the pol delta auxiliary factor, leads to a reduction in Km and increase in Vmax. This suggests that proliferating cell nuclear antigen enhances the processivity of pol delta by increasing both the residence time of pol delta on the DNA template-primer and the rate at which individual nucleotides are incorporated."
https://openalex.org/W1558312262,"Abstract The catalytic antibody 1F7 promotes the rearrangement of chorismate into prephenate. We cloned and sequenced the genes encoding this catalyst to determine the origin of the observed rates and specificity. The antibody cDNAs were modified and inserted into inducible expression vectors. Simultaneous intracellular expression of the light and truncated heavy chains in strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacking natural chorismate mutase resulted in the production of properly folded and assembled Fab antibody. Assembly of the light and heavy immunoglobulin chains is roughly 60-70% efficient in our in vivo system, lagging behind light chain synthesis throughout log and stationary phase. Nevertheless, high intracellular levels of functional Fab antibody (0.1% of total cellular protein) were obtained with an ultra-high copy number plasmid. As yeast-derived 1F7(Fab) catalyzes the chorismate mutase reaction with the same specific activity as antibody isolated from the hybridoma, our expression system now makes possible the application of classical and reverse genetics to the study and improvement of this first-generation abzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1521340052,"Normal rat kidney (NRK) cells cultured in the presence of epidermal growth factor are contact-inhibited at confluent densities. In the additional presence of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, however, cells undergo phenotypic transformation which is accompanied by a loss of contact inhibition. In this study, we show by means of the fluorescence photobleaching recovery technique and a scrape-loading dye transfer technique that quiescent confluent cultures of NRK cells do not show extensive gap junction-mediated intercellular communication. Cells contact-inhibited in the presence of epidermal growth factor also show only limited intercellular communication, although with an enhanced permeability coefficient. Cells phenotypically transformed upon addition of TGF beta, however, show extensive intercellular communication, with a similarly enhanced permeability coefficient. This enhanced intercellular communication induced by TGF beta is paralleled by an increase in intracellular pH. It is concluded that in contrast to what has been observed during tumorigenic transformation, phenotypic transformation of NRK cells induced by TGF beta results in an enhancement of the extent of gap junction-mediated intercellular communication."
https://openalex.org/W1553473199,"Caldesmon is a calmodulin- and actin-binding protein present in both smooth and non-muscle tissue. The present study demonstrates that platelet caldesmon is a substrate for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A). Purified platelet caldesmon has an apparent molecular mass of 82 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and can be phosphorylated in vitro by the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A to a level of 2 mol of phosphate/mol of caldesmon. Phosphorylation of caldesmon by protein kinase A results in a shift in the apparent molecular mass of the protein to 86 kDa. When caldesmon was immunoprecipitated from intact platelets treated with prostacyclin (PGI2) the same shift in apparent molecular mass of caldesmon was observed. Comparison of two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide maps of caldesmon phosphorylated in vitro by protein kinase A with caldesmon immunoprecipitated from intact platelets verified that protein kinase A was responsible for the observed increase in caldesmon phosphorylation in PGI2-treated platelets. The present study demonstrates that although caldesmon is basally phosphorylated in the intact platelet, activation of protein kinase A by PGI2 results in the significant incorporation of phosphate into two new sites. In addition, the effects of phorbol ester, collagen, and thrombin on caldesmon phosphorylation were also examined. Although phorbol ester treatment results in a significant increase in caldesmon phosphorylation apparently by protein kinase C, treatment of intact platelets with thrombin or collagen does not result in an increase in caldesmon phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1493333268,"Several allosterically modulated protein kinases have been shown to be regulated by an autoinhibitory domain located within the kinase molecules. The inhibitory domain has been proposed to act as a inhibitor binding to the substrate binding site of the kinase, thereby blocking the binding of the enzyme's true substrate. In this report, site-directed mutagenesis has been used to further investigate the mechanism of activation of the inhibitory domain of rabbit skeletal muscle myosin light chain kinase. Basic residues within the pseudosubstrate domain (572-573, 577-579, 580-581), which are analogous to the important substrate determinants of the myosin light chain, were found not to be required in order to maintain the kinase in an inhibited state. Two groups of these residues (577-579 and 581-582) were, however, found to be important for high affinity calmodulin binding to the kinase. These data suggest that the autoinhibitory domain of myosin light chain kinase may not function by directly mimicking the light chain substrate."
https://openalex.org/W1498560758,"Abstract By the chemical synthesis of modified insulin B chains and the combination of the synthetic B chains with natural insulin A chains, we have prepared insulin analogs with natural and unnatural amino acid replacements of invariant residue LeuB6. Analogs have been investigated by reference to their potencies for interaction with the insulin receptor (as assessed by competition for 125I-labeled binding to isolated canine hepatocytes) and to their abilities to undergo the structural transitions that are characteristic of insulin self-aggregation (as assessed by the spectroscopic analysis of analog complexes with cobalt). Our results identify that (a) replacement of LeuB6 by glycine has nearly the equivalent effect as deletion of residues B1-B6 in decreasing receptor binding potency of the analog to only about 0.05% of that of insulin; (b) relative to the GlyB6 derivative, replacements that increase the relative hydrophobicity of the residue B6 side chain also increase the relative receptor binding potencies of the resulting analogs; (c) negative steric effects resulting from substitutions by valine, phenylalanine, and gamma-ethylnorleucine limit the potential for enhancing potency as the result of increased hydrophobicity; and (d) two analogs with disparate potency for receptor interaction (those with alanine and gamma-ethylnorleucine at position B6, analogs exhibiting about 1 and 48% of the potency of insulin, respectively) undergo the T6----R6 structural transition in the presence of Co2+ and phenol which is typical of insulin but result in hexameric complexes with greatly reduced stability. We conclude that leucine provides a closely determined best fit at insulin position B6, and we discuss our findings in terms of insulin conformations that may apply to the receptor-bound state of the hormone."
https://openalex.org/W1678391582,"A cDNA clone, which contained the complete rhizopuspepsin structure and the putative proregion, was placed in three different Escherichia coli expression vectors for the synthesis of rhizopuspepsinogen (Rpg). Recombinant Rpgs which were expressed in the cytosol of E. coli as inclusion bodies (cRpg and tRpg) were not active. After solubilization in 6 M urea and refolding by rapid dilution, both of these Rpgs were purified to homogeneity. The third zymogen, pRpg, which was secreted to the periplasmic space of E. coli with an omp leader, was fully active and also was purified. The expression level of pRpg was higher (over 40 mg/liter culture) than that of cRpg (about 1.5 mg/liter culture). Amino-terminal sequence analysis of the zymogens revealed that cRpg and pRpg contain 40 and 51 residues of prosequence, respectively. tRpg, which was expressed under the control of T7 promoter, was synthesized at 500 mg/liter culture and was purified at 50 mg/liter culture. This zymogen contained, in addition to 51 residues of proregion, 16 residues inherited from the expression vector construction. All of these Rpgs spontaneously converted to rhizopuspepsin in solutions of pH less than 5. Each of the conversions was associated with a change of molecular weight as monitored in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis. At least one intermediate of conversion was observed in the pH range of 2 to 3 for both the cRpg and pRpg zymogens. For pRpg and tRpg, kinetic data demonstrated that the Rpg to rhizopuspepsin conversion was accomplished by a first order, unimolecular reaction at pH 2. The first order kinetic constants in this pH at 15 degrees C were 1.1 and 2.4 min-1 for pRpg and tRpg, respectively. The activation rate decreased as pH was raised above pH 2. At pH greater than 3.0, rhizopuspepsin-catalyzed, second-order activation also takes place. Consequently, the recombinant Rpgs are activated by either of two cleavage mechanisms as is the case for pepsinogen. These results also support the hypothesis that Rpg is synthesized in Rhizopus chinensis as a zymogen. Rpg in the host fungus is probably activated by an acid environment of pH less than 5 in the secretory granules to become rhizopuspepsin before secretion."
https://openalex.org/W1505490586,"An approach utilizing fluorescence-activated DNA sequencing technology was used to study the position and frequency of UV-induced lesions in the lacI gene of Escherichia coli. The spectrum of sites of UV damage in the NC+ region of the gene was compared with a published spectrum of UV-induced mutation in lacI (Schaaper, R.M., Dunn, R.L., and Glickman, B.W. (1987) J. Mol. Biol. 198, 187-202). On average, the frequency of UV-induced lesions in the nontranscribed strand was higher than that in the transcribed strand in the region analyzed. A large fraction of mutations occurs at sites of UV-induced lesions in the nontranscribed strand, but not in the transcribed strand. This bias is reduced in an excision repair deficient (UvrB-) strain. In addition, mutations occur overwhelmingly at sites where a dipyrimidine sequence is present in the nontranscribed strand. This bias is also markedly reduced in the UvrB- strain. In light of recent work Mellon and Hanawalt (Mellon, I., and Hanawalt, P.C. (1989) Nature 342, 95-98) describing the preferential removal of cyclobutane dimers from the transcribed strand of the expressed lacZ gene in E. coli, our data suggest that preferential strand repair may have a significant effect on mutagenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1560676268,"The transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) was found to selectively trans-activate one member of the human class I alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) gene family. A comparison of the promoters for the three human class I ADH genes ADH1, ADH2, and ADH3 indicated a very similar pattern of binding sites (sites A-F) for rat liver nuclear proteins located between -10 and -210 base pairs (bp). In all three promoters site A consisted of two binding sites for the transcription factor C/EBP closely flanking both sides of the TATA box, but C/EBP bound with much greater affinity to site A of ADH2. C/EBP also bound at two locations which coincide with site D (-120 bp) and site E (-160 bp) of all three promoters. Cotransfection studies of human hepatoma cells using ADH-cat fusions and a C/EBP expression plasmid indicated that the human ADH2 promoter responded well to C/EBP trans-activation whereas the human ADH1 and ADH3 promoters, which bind C/EBP weakly, responded poorly. Individual mutations in several ADH2 nuclear factor-binding sites allowed the identification of four functional C/EBP-binding sites, i.e. two in site A as well as one each in sites D and E. Also, the ADH2 TATA box was found to be dispensable for C/EBP induction. Compared to ADH2 and ADH3, site A in ADH1 contains four extra base pairs between the two C/EBP motifs, and deletion of these nucleotides increased the C/EBP responsiveness of ADH1 presumably by changing the spacing of the two C/EBP motifs. Thus, sequence divergence of human class I ADH gene family members has led to forms which vary in their responsiveness to C/EBP. We suggest that C/EBP contributes to liver-specific expression of the human class I ADH gene family by selectively inducing the ADH2 gene via a TATA-independent mechanism during liver development."
https://openalex.org/W1480820796,"Abstract Isopenicillin N synthase (IPNS) from Cephalosporium acremonium contains 2 cysteine residues in positions 106 and 255 which are invariant in all IPNS sequences reported to date (Miller, J.R., and Ingolia, T.D. (1989) Mol. Microbiol. 3, 689-695). Although these residues have been postulated to play a role in catalysis (Samson, S.M., Chapman, J.L., Belagaje, R., Queener, S., and Ingolia, T.D. (1987) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 84, 5705-5709) as well as enzyme inactivation (Perry, D., Abraham, E.P., and Baldwin, J.E. (1988) Biochem. J. 255, 345-351) little information exists regarding their oxidation state and reactivity. In this paper, the functions of these cysteines have been addressed by chemical modification techniques in combination with site-directed mutagenesis. In the intact wild type protein, both cysteines are inert toward 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) and iodoacetic acid. However, Cys-106, but not Cys-255, can be slowly modified by N-ethylmaleimide, and its modification is partially blocked by the presence of a substrate analog inhibitor. Complete modification of both cysteines by sulfhydryl reagents requires unfolding of the protein but not the presence of a disulfide reducing agent. The thiol content of IPNS is shown to be the same before and after exposing the enzyme to substrate even though during catalysis the enzyme is rapidly inactivated. The impact on catalysis due to alteration of the cysteines has been assessed using three site-specific mutants: Cys-106----Ser, Cys-255----Ser, and Cys-106,255----Ser. These mutant proteins have been purified as apoenzymes with the nature of the mutation verified by peptide mapping. The stoichiometry of metal required for activity remains as one equivalent of Fe2+/mol of enzyme in the mutants as in wild type IPNS. Compared with wild type, Cys-255----Ser shows a reduction in Vmax by 33%, and an increase in Km by 1.4-fold, while Cys-106----Ser and Cys-106,255----Ser, which have identical kinetic properties, exhibit a decrease in Vmax by 63% but an elevation of Km by 14-fold. The data presented demonstrate that 1) both cysteines are free thiols; 2) Cys-106 is more exposed than Cys-255; 3) substrate-induced inactivation is not caused by cysteine modification; 4) neither cysteine is absolutely essential for bond making or breaking events during catalysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
https://openalex.org/W1556056622,"Prior studies demonstrated that sphingomyelin degradation via a sphingomyelinase antagonized phorbol ester-mediated differentiation of HL-60 cells into macrophages (Kolesnick, R.N. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 7617-7623). The present studies show that phorbol esters induce early sphingomyelin synthesis in HL-60 cells and that this event may play a direct role in development of an adherent macrophage population. A maximally effective concentration of the potent phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA; 1 x 10(-7) M) stimulated an elevation in the sphingomyelin level at 24 h from 560 to 700 pmol/10(6) cells; a peak level of 1400 pmol/10(6) cells was achieved at 48 h. Phosphatidylcholine levels did not change significantly, indicating sphingomyelin synthesis was selective. The phosphatidylcholine:sphingomyelin ratio decreased from 10.3 to 7.9 at 24 h and to 5.3 at 48 h. Phorbol ester-induced sphingomyelin synthesis was biphasic. A burst of synthesis, detectable within 1 h and linear for 4 h, was followed by a prolonged phase at a slower rate. Ceramide synthesis was also biphasic. Ceramide levels decreased initially consistent with activation of the enzyme, phosphatidylcholine:ceramide cholinephosphotransferase and increased during the prolonged phase of sphingomyelin synthesis. During phorbol ester-induced differentiation, an adherent macrophage population was demonstrable by 14 h. This population contained the entire elevation of sphingomyelin levels. This demonstrates that early sphingomyelin synthesis defines a population of cells destined to become adherent macrophages. Studies were performed to directly manipulate sphingomyelin levels. Small unilamellar vesicles containing sphingomyelin did not directly induce macrophage differentiation but rather potentiated the effect of submaximal concentrations of phorbol ester. Sphingomyelin vesicles (2 x 10-6 M) enhanced TPA (5 x 10-10 M)-induced adherence 2-fold from 12 to 24% of the total population. Sphingosylphosphorylcholine (5 x 10-6 M), which may be acylated to sphingomyelin, was similarly effective. Further, exogenous sphingomyelinase, but not various phospholipases A2 and C, induced detachment of adherent macrophages. In sum, these studies demonstrate that phorbol esters induce early, selective synthesis of sphingomyelin in HL-60 cells. This event defines a population of cells destined to become adherent macrophages and may play a direct role in the adherence process."
https://openalex.org/W1492889829,"The mechanism by which a protein integrates posttranslationally into a membrane can involve the composition of the membrane itself, domains within the inserting polypeptide, and a number of associating proteins. Some integral membrane proteins do not accumulate to normal levels when certain pigments are deficient, and this has been interpreted to mean that such proteins may be rapidly degraded when not in a correct complex. Alternatively, pigments could facilitate the movement of some proteins from an aqueous to a lipid environment. To determine whether chlorophyll is absolutely required for the membrane integration of the light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding protein (LHCP) of chloroplast thylakoid membranes, we have expressed LHCP in Escherichia coli that lacks photosynthetic pigments. LHCP is targeted to the bacterial inner membrane by the addition of a bacterial signal peptide and cannot be extracted from these membranes by NaOH, NaBr, or Na2HCO3 but is extracted by 0.2% Triton X-100. Treatment of isolated right-side-out and inside-out bacterial inner membrane vesicles with trypsin reveals that only the amino terminus of LHCP is exposed on the cytoplasmic face, and the remaining portion of the protein is inaccessible. Treatment of the inside-out vesicles with trypsin followed by alkaline extraction shows that LHCP is intrinsic to the membrane and is not anchored solely by the bacterial signal peptide. Chlorophyll, therefore, is not required for LHCP to integrate into a membrane, but in the absence of these pigments this process is observed to be inefficient."
https://openalex.org/W1528793678,"The gene encoding rabbit muscle creatine kinase (CK) has been subcloned into a single plasmid, and the protein expressed in a soluble and functional form in Escherichia coli. The amino terminus, specific activity, and electrophoretic mobility of the E. coli-expressed creatine kinase are all identical with that of creatine kinase purified from rabbit skeletal muscle. Surprisingly, isoelectric focusing shows that the expressed protein displays no less heterogeneity than the tissue-purified material. The identification of the source(s) of this heterogeneity is important for the preparation of highly homogeneous material needed for structural studies and clinical applications. This issue also has implications for studies of the developmental regulation and tissue localization of the various CK genes. Our results allow us to eliminate some of the proposals, such as the presence of multiple alleles, alternative ribosomal initiation sites, and post-translational glycosylation or phosphorylation that have been suggested to explain the presence of the numerous isoforms present in apparently pure preparations of CK."
https://openalex.org/W1554894857,"Abstract We investigated the properties of an artificial chimeric peptide that contains an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-tripeptide, the versatile cell recognition signal of extracellular matrix protein components, coupled to a carboxyl-terminal fragment of the highly specific alpha-thrombin inhibitor, hirudin (residues 53-64): WGRGDSANGDFEEIPEEYL (RGD-hirudin53-64). Hirudin53-64 and RGD-hirudin53-64 inhibited the fibrinogen clotting activity of alpha-thrombin and prolonged the activated partial thromboplastin time of human plasma. In addition, both peptides afforded total protection to thrombin from trypsionolysis. Neither hirudin53-64 nor RGD-hirudin53-64 dramatically interfered with the thrombin-antithrombin inhibition reaction either in the absence or presence of added heparin. alpha-Thrombin-induced platelet aggregation was effectively inhibited by hirudin53-64 and RGD-hirudin53-64. Unlike hirudin53-64, RGD-hirudin53-64 in solution inhibited integrin-mediated endothelial cell and fibroblast cell attachment to polystyrene wells in the presence of fetal bovine serum. Collectively, our results demonstrate that RGD-hirudin53-64 has anticoagulant/antiplatelet aggregation activity attributable to its hirudin sequence and integrin-directed cell attachment activity due to its RGD site. Our results suggest that this chimeric motif may serve as a prototype for a new class of anticoagulants where an integrin-specific sequence targets the peptide to a cell (ultimately through the platelet integrin alpha IIb beta 3) trapped amid a thrombus with ensuing proteinase inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W1608573791,"To assess the molecular architecture of the human erythrocyte skeletal protein 4.1:bilayer interface, the distance between a donor sulfhydryl-specific fluorescent probe attached to a region near the glycophorin-binding domain of protein 4.1 and an acceptor lipophilic probe in the exposed leaflet of inside-out vesicles (IOVs) was measured by fluorescence resonance energy transfer. To prevent aggregation and loss of function, protein 4.1 was labeled in situ on the surface of IOVs, purified, and rebound onto fresh IOVs. The labeled protein 4.1 was similar to the native protein in its gel electrophoretic pattern and its binding affinity to stripped-IOVs (Kd 35 +/- 4 nM). Energy transfer was assessed using two donor-acceptor pairs, 5-[2-[(iodoacetyl)amino]ethyl] aminonaphthalene-1-sulfonic acid and 3,3'-ditetradecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate, or 5-iodoacetamidofluorescein and tetramethylrhodamine phosphatidylethanolamine. Using both donor fluorescence intensity and lifetime quenching measurements, an average distance of 75 +/- 5 A between the probe on the protein and the surface of IOVs was found. In parallel fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies with protein 4.1 and liposomes with a phospholipid composition similar to the inner leaflet of the red cell membrane, a closer distance was found (49 +/- 5 A). Two control experiments validated energy transfer: (a) the spectrum of a mixture of IOVs separately labeled with donor and acceptor was different from the spectrum of the doubly labeled IOVs at identical donor and acceptor concentrations; and (b) no energy transfer was observed following detergent disruption of the geometric relationship between donor and acceptor. Taken together, these observations suggest that membrane-bound protein 4.1 is elongated and that the labeled site is located at a position deep in the 30-kDa N-terminal glycophorin-binding domain of the protein. The data are also consistent with the view that the cytoplasmic tail of glycophorin is interposed between protein 4.1 and the lipids. These experiments represent the first measurement of a distance between a skeletal protein and the lipid bilayer."
https://openalex.org/W1623777379,"The steady-state kinetic behavior of dopamine beta-monooxygenase (D beta M) has been examined over a 1000-fold range of ascorbate concentrations. Kinetic plots exhibit extreme curvature indicative of apparent negative cooperativity in the interaction of D beta M with ascorbate, with a calculated Hill coefficient of 0.15-0.30. The observed cooperativity is found to be independent of enzyme concentration and tyramine and oxygen concentrations, as well as the pH employed for the assay. Similar kinetic data have been obtained with both soluble and purified membrane-derived forms of enzyme. An investigation of the effect of the anion activator fumarate upon the observed kinetic patterns has demonstrated a conversion to a less cooperative kinetic pattern at low pH and high concentrations of fumarate. This phenomenon is attributed to an inhibitory binding of the structurally similar monoanionic species of fumarate to the ascorbate reductant site. A simple model has been used to assess the change in apparent Vmax and Km parameters with increased ascorbate concentrations. At all pH values examined, there is a dramatic decrease in the affinity of D beta M for ascorbate from a Km of approximately 0.05-0.10 mM (ascorbate concentration less than 1 mM) to Km greater than 10 mM at limiting ascorbate; at the same time there is a 3- to 4-fold increase in the limiting Vmax value. Several models have been considered to explain the observed activation of D beta M by high levels of ascorbic acid."
https://openalex.org/W1903618497,"We have studied Ca2+ mobilization mediated by the constitutively expressed muscarinic receptor on a subclone of PC-12 cells. The subclone, ACH2, was isolated with a flow cytometer by selection of single cells that exhibited a strong intracellular Ca2+ response to acetylcholine (ACh). Cell to cell heterogeneity of resting Ca2+ levels was markedly reduced in the subclone and homogeneity of the population response was also dramatically improved. ACH2 cells were highly sensitive to ACh and the Ca2+ response in all cells was blocked by muscarinic antagonists. Membranes from ACH2 exhibited muscarinic binding affinities which were not typical of M1, M2, or M3 receptors but were consistent with the profile of the putative m4 receptor. The same percentage of cells responded to ACh whether or not extracellular Ca2+ was reduced with EGTA, but the response was eliminated in all cells by preincubation with pertussis toxin. Thus, the constitutive m4 receptor on ACH2 cells is efficiently coupled to intracellular Ca2+ release by a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism. Stimulation of the ACH2 cells by bradykinin (BK) evoked a Ca2+ response in 90% of the cells. Prestimulation with BK diminished the magnitude of the muscarinic Ca2+ response but did not reduce the number of cells which responded to ACh. Inhibition was partially attributed to inhibition of a Ca2+ influx pathway in resting cells. Thus, the signaling mechanism coupled to the m4 muscarinic receptor can be inhibited by signals initiated by the BK receptor."

https://openalex.org/W1536832486,"Adenylate kinase has two distinct binding sites for nucleotide substrates, MgATP and AMP. To identify the location of the site that specifically interacts with the adenine ring of AMP, we have substituted Ala, Gly, Val, Gln, and Trp for Leu66 of the recombinant chicken muscle enzyme by site-directed mutagenesis. All the purified Leu66 mutant enzymes exhibited an essentially identical circular dichroism spectrum and had thermal stabilities similar to the wild-type enzyme. Steady state kinetic analysis showed that the Leu66 mutant enzymes have significantly decreased Vmax values and markedly large Km values only for AMP. These results show that the binding site for the adenine ring of AMP in adenylate kinase is presumably located close to Leu66, which is invariant in all the enzymes so far sequenced. Significant inhibition of activities of the mutant enzymes and quenching of the Trp66 fluorescence by substrates suggest that in some Leu66 mutant enzymes, MgATP also binds to the AMP-binding site. Thus, Leu66 of adenylate kinase might play a role in the asymmetric recognition of the adenine ring of AMP from that of MgATP. Furthermore, the hydrophobicity of the residue at position 66 appears to be important for the positive cooperativity of substrate binding."

When nondifferentiated cells were incubated for 20 min with 2 mM H2O2 and 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate to inhibit their protein-tyrosine-phosphatase activity (Heffetz, D., Bushkin, I., Dror, R., and Zick, Y. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 2896-2902), we found marked tyrosine phosphorylation of a single major protein of 53 kDa. Induction of differentiation of HL-60 cells was accompanied by the appearance of an additional major cytosolic tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of 75 kDa (pp75). In dibutyryl cAMP-treated cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of pp75 peaked after 24 h and then declined rapidly. In 1,25(OH)2D3-treated cells, increased tyrosine phosphorylation was detected as early as 2 h and peaked after 3 days, whereas the presence of differentiated phenotypes, assessed by the capacity of the cells to reduce nitro blue tetrazolium, was detected no earlier than 24 h. Doses of 1,25(OH)2D3 as low as 1 nM induced the appearance of pp75 at a stage where almost no differentiation measured by nitro blue tetrazolium reduction was detected. Phosphorylation of pp75 was not stimulated by adriamycin, which induced growth arrest without initiation of differentiation. pp75 could also be detected in U-937, a monocytic cell line that is more advanced in its differentiation state, and also in terminally differentiated circulating human monocytes treated with H2O2/vanadate. pp75 underwent in vitro tyrosine phosphorylation in cytosolic extracts derived from 1,25(OH)2D3-induced HL-60 cells, but not in extracts derived from uninduced cells. Our results raise the possibility that tyrosine phosphorylation of pp75 may be a common early event that heralds the differentiation of HL-60 cells into both the monocytic and granulocytic pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1568583871,"Glycoproteins of the nuclear pore complex are thought to play an important role in the transport of regulatory proteins and ribonucleoproteins across the nuclear envelope. However, the genetic elements and signals that control the expression of nuclear pore glycoproteins are poorly understood. To study the transcriptional regulation of mammalian nuclear pore glycoprotein biosynthesis, we have isolated the gene coding for the major rat nuclear pore glycoprotein p62. The p62 gene consists of a 2941-base pair region that is linear with the full length p62 cDNA with no intervening sequences. Quantitative Southern analysis revealed that the gene is present in single copy. The p62 gene encodes a 525-amino acid open reading frame that directs the synthesis of the 62-kDa pore glycoprotein in vitro and in transfected cultured cells. The 5‘-flanking region contains two potential transcription start sites; primer extension analysis revealed that the furthest upstream site is preferentially used in vivo. When linked to a reporter gene, the 5‘-flanking region of the p62 gene serves as an active promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1510418871,"Abstract The role of intra- and extravesicular ascorbate has been investigated in dopamine beta-monooxygenase (D beta M) turnover using adrenal medulla chromaffin granule ghosts. Resealing of vesicle ghosts with high levels of intravesicular ascorbate leads to viable vesicles, as evidenced from the high rates of the ATP-dependent accumulation of tyramine, Vmax = 14 +/- 1 nmol/min.mg and Km = 20 +/- 6 microM. However, the D beta M-catalyzed conversion of tyramine to octopamine occurs slowly, Vmax = 0.50 +/- 0.13 nmol/min.mg and Km = 29 +/- 18 mM. When ascorbate is present instead in the external buffer, the D beta M rate increases 3.6-fold for a final Vmax = 1.8 +/- 0.2 and Km = 1.2 +/- 0.3 mM. This relatively high rate of enzyme turnover is retained in ghosts resealed with a large excess of ascorbate oxidase, ruling out contamination by intravesicular ascorbate as the source of enzyme activity. The synergistic effect of intravesicular ascorbate was examined under conditions of 2 mM external ascorbate, showing that the enzymatic rate increases 2.7-fold, from 1.2 (0 internal ascorbate) to 3.2 +/- 0.4 nmol/min.mg (saturating internal ascorbate). This result confirms that high levels of internal ascorbate are not damaging to intravesicular D beta M. These studies demonstrate very clearly that external ascorbate is the preferred reductant for the membranous form of D beta M in chromaffin granule ghosts."
https://openalex.org/W1596945751,"An apparent leucine zipper motif was recognized in the predicted amino acid sequence of porcine kidney renin-binding protein (RnBP) by analysis of the nucleotide sequence of a cDNA encoding the protein (Inoue, H., Fukui, K., Takahashi, S., and Miyake, Y. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 6556-6561). To evaluate the role of this motif in the formation of an RnBP-renin heterodimer and an RnBP homodimer, a porcine mutant cDNA involving Leu185----Asp and Leu192----Asp substitutions was constructed and expressed in vitro and in Xenopus oocytes. The mutant protein neither binds to renin nor forms the homodimer. The results strongly suggest that the leucine zipper motif in the RnBP molecule mediates the formation of both the RnBP-renin heterodimer and the RnBP homodimer observed previously. The existence of the motif should facilitate elucidation of the role of RnBP in renin metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1596515194,"Pseudomonas species MA was grown with methylamine as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen enabling the total flow of carbon and nitrogen into this organism to be simultaneously monitored in vivo using 13C and 15N NMR. [13C]Methylamine was rapidly and extensively incorporated into the methyl group of N-methylglutamate during high oxygenation of the cell suspension, but when the oxygenation rate was lower, a significant portion was also found in the methyl group of gamma-glutamylmethylamide. At later times the carbon label was found in intermediates of the serine assimilation pathway, with glutamate derived from the tricarboxylic acid cycle being the most abundant product. Incorporation of [15N]methylamine was only detected as N-methyl[15N]glutamate, but when protein synthesis was inhibited, the label was also detected in the amino nitrogen of glutamate. When oxygenation rates were lower, the 15N-labeled methylamine was found in the methylamide group of gamma-glutamylmethylamide in addition to being incorporated into N-methylglutamate. gamma-Glutamylmethylamide formation was linked to the overall energy state of the cell and was not affected by inhibition of the carbon assimilation pathway. Neither 5-hydroxy-N-methylpyroglutamate nor N-methyl-alpha-ketoglutaramate were detected to any significant extent. A mechanism was proposed for the role of gamma-glutamylmethylamide in the regulation of endogenous nitrogen supplies in this organism."
https://openalex.org/W1655844568,"The imidazole of His-195 plays an essential role in the proposed general base mechanism of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). The structure of the binary complex of CATIII and chloramphenicol suggests that two unusual interactions might determine the conformation of the side chain of His-195: (i) an intraresidue hydrogen bond between its main chain carbonyl and the protonated N delta 1 of the imidazole ring and (ii) face-to-face van der Waals contact between the His-195 imidazole group and the aromatic side chain of Tyr-25. Tyr-25 also makes a hydrogen bond, via its phenolic hydroxyl, to the carbonyl oxygen of the substrate chloramphenicol. Replacement of Tyr-25 of CATIII by phenylalanine results in a modest increase in the Km for chloramphenicol (from 11.6 to 14.6 microM) and a 2-fold fall in kcat (599 to 258 s-1), indicative of a free energy contribution to transition state binding of 0.6 kcal mol-1 for the hydrogen bond between Tyr-25 and chloramphenicol. In contrast, substitution of Tyr-25 by alanine yields an enzyme that is dramatically impaired in its ability to bind chloramphenicol (Km = 173 microM). As kcat for Ala-25 CAT is also reduced (130 s-1), the loss of the aryl group results in a 69-fold decrease in kcat/Km, corresponding to a free energy contribution to binding and catalysis of 2.5 kcal mol-1. In addition to the loss of the hydrogen bond between Tyr-25 and chloramphenicol, the loss of substrate affinity in Ala-25 CAT may be a direct consequence of reduced hydrophobicity of the chloramphenicol-binding site and/or the loss of critical constraints on the precise conformation of the catalytic imidazole. However, as with wild type CAT, inactivation of Ala-25 CAT by the affinity reagent 3-(bromoacetyl) chloramphenicol is accompanied by modification solely at N epsilon 2 of His-195. Hence, the results demonstrate that tautomeric stabilization of the imidazole ring persists in the absence of van der Waals interactions with the side chain of Tyr-25, probably as a consequence of hydrogen bonding between the protonated N delta 1 and the carbonyl oxygen of His-195."
