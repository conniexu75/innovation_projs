https://openalex.org/W3099011804,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic markedly changed human mobility patterns, necessitating epidemiological models that can capture the effects of these changes in mobility on the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)1. Here we introduce a metapopulation susceptible–exposed–infectious–removed (SEIR) model that integrates fine-grained, dynamic mobility networks to simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in ten of the largest US metropolitan areas. Our mobility networks are derived from mobile phone data and map the hourly movements of 98 million people from neighbourhoods (or census block groups) to points of interest such as restaurants and religious establishments, connecting 56,945 census block groups to 552,758 points of interest with 5.4 billion hourly edges. We show that by integrating these networks, a relatively simple SEIR model can accurately fit the real case trajectory, despite substantial changes in the behaviour of the population over time. Our model predicts that a small minority of ‘superspreader’ points of interest account for a large majority of the infections, and that restricting the maximum occupancy at each point of interest is more effective than uniformly reducing mobility. Our model also correctly predicts higher infection rates among disadvantaged racial and socioeconomic groups2–8 solely as the result of differences in mobility: we find that disadvantaged groups have not been able to reduce their mobility as sharply, and that the points of interest that they visit are more crowded and are therefore associated with higher risk. By capturing who is infected at which locations, our model supports detailed analyses that can inform more-effective and equitable policy responses to COVID-19. An epidemiological model that integrates fine-grained mobility networks illuminates mobility-related mechanisms that contribute to higher infection rates among disadvantaged socioeconomic and racial groups, and finds that restricting maximum occupancy at locations is especially effective for curbing infections."
https://openalex.org/W3102258632,"Two-way transmission on mink farms Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a zoonotic virus—one that spilled over from another species to infect and transmit among humans. We know that humans can infect other animals with SARS-CoV-2, such as domestic cats and even tigers in zoos. Oude Munnink et al. used whole-genome sequencing to show that SARS-CoV-2 infections were rife among mink farms in the southeastern Netherlands, all of which are destined to be closed by March 2021 (see the Perspective by Zhou and Shi). Toward the end of June 2020, 68% of mink farm workers tested positive for the virus or had antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. These large clusters of infection were initiated by human COVID-19 cases with viruses that bear the D614G mutation. Sequencing has subsequently shown that mink-to-human transmission also occurred. More work must be done to understand whether there is a risk that mustelids may become a reservoir for SARS-CoV-2. Science , this issue p. 172 ; see also p. 120"
https://openalex.org/W3095016916,"We present an integrated analysis of the clinical measurements, immune cells, and plasma multi-omics of 139 COVID-19 patients representing all levels of disease severity, from serial blood draws collected during the first week of infection following diagnosis. We identify a major shift between mild and moderate disease, at which point elevated inflammatory signaling is accompanied by the loss of specific classes of metabolites and metabolic processes. Within this stressed plasma environment at moderate disease, multiple unusual immune cell phenotypes emerge and amplify with increasing disease severity. We condensed over 120,000 immune features into a single axis to capture how different immune cell classes coordinate in response to SARS-CoV-2. This immune-response axis independently aligns with the major plasma composition changes, with clinical metrics of blood clotting, and with the sharp transition between mild and moderate disease. This study suggests that moderate disease may provide the most effective setting for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W3096816634,"Antibodies are key immune effectors that confer protection against pathogenic threats. The nature and longevity of the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are not well defined. We charted longitudinal antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 in 92 subjects after symptomatic COVID-19. Antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 are unimodally distributed over a broad range, with symptom severity correlating directly with virus-specific antibody magnitude. Seventy-six subjects followed longitudinally to ∼100 days demonstrated marked heterogeneity in antibody duration dynamics. Virus-specific IgG decayed substantially in most individuals, whereas a distinct subset had stable or increasing antibody levels in the same time frame despite similar initial antibody magnitudes. These individuals with increasing responses recovered rapidly from symptomatic COVID-19 disease, harbored increased somatic mutations in virus-specific memory B cell antibody genes, and had persistent higher frequencies of previously activated CD4+ T cells. These findings illuminate an efficient immune phenotype that connects symptom clearance speed to differential antibody durability dynamics."
https://openalex.org/W3105667161,"The current COVID-19 pandemic raises concerns worldwide, leading to serious health, economic, and social challenges. The rapid spread of the virus at a global scale highlights the need for a more harmonized, less privacy-concerning, easily accessible approach to monitoring the human mobility that has proven to be associated with viral transmission. In this study, we analyzed over 580 million tweets worldwide to see how global collaborative efforts in reducing human mobility are reflected from the user-generated information at the global, country, and U.S. state scale. Considering the multifaceted nature of mobility, we propose two types of distance: the single-day distance and the cross-day distance. To quantify the responsiveness in certain geographic regions, we further propose a mobility-based responsive index (MRI) that captures the overall degree of mobility changes within a time window. The results suggest that mobility patterns obtained from Twitter data are amenable to quantitatively reflect the mobility dynamics. Globally, the proposed two distances had greatly deviated from their baselines after March 11, 2020, when WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. The considerably less periodicity after the declaration suggests that the protection measures have obviously affected people’s travel routines. The country scale comparisons reveal the discrepancies in responsiveness, evidenced by the contrasting mobility patterns in different epidemic phases. We find that the triggers of mobility changes correspond well with the national announcements of mitigation measures, proving that Twitter-based mobility implies the effectiveness of those measures. In the U.S., the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on mobility is distinct. However, the impacts vary substantially among states."
https://openalex.org/W3102923342,"The COVID-19 pandemic has had tremendous impact on Americans’ lives including their personal and social behaviors. While people of all ages are affected in some way by the pandemic, older persons have been far more likely to suffer the most severe health consequences. For this reason, how people have responded to mitigating behaviors to COVID-19 may differ by age. Using a nationally representative sample from the longitudinal data of the Understanding America Study (UAS), we examined differentials in behavioral responses to COVID-19 by age and how they changed over the first three months of the pandemic. Behavioral responses and changes in behavior over time differed by age, type of behaviors and time reference. At the beginning of the pandemic (March, 2020), older and younger people were similar in their likelihood of engaging in preventive personal behaviors when controlling for other influences. As the pandemic progressed, however, older people adopted mitigating personal behavioral changes more than younger people, such that about 1–2 months after the pandemic started, older people were more likely to comply with suggested behaviors and regulations including practicing better hygiene, quarantining, and social distancing. One month into the pandemic, older people were less likely than younger people to engage in two of four risky behaviors. The change in risky behavior over time did not differ by age; but both younger and older people were more likely to engage in risky behaviors after two months. Being female, a member of a racial/ethnic minority group, higher socioeconomic status, having more COVID-19 cases in one’s state of residence, a higher perceived risk for infection and dying, and a more left-leaning political orientation were related to adopting more pandemic mitigating behaviors."
https://openalex.org/W3102263761,"Background Available COVID-19 mortality indices are limited to acute inpatient data. Using nationwide medical administrative data available prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection from the US Veterans Health Administration (VA), we developed the VA COVID-19 (VACO) 30-day mortality index and validated the index in two independent, prospective samples. Methods and findings We reviewed SARS-CoV-2 testing results within the VA between February 8 and August 18, 2020. The sample was split into a development cohort (test positive between March 2 and April 15, 2020), an early validation cohort (test positive between April 16 and May 18, 2020), and a late validation cohort (test positive between May 19 and July 19, 2020). Our logistic regression model in the development cohort considered demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity), and pre-existing medical conditions and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) derived from ICD-10 diagnosis codes. Weights were fixed to create the VACO Index that was then validated by comparing area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) in the early and late validation cohorts and among important validation cohort subgroups defined by sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region. We also evaluated calibration curves and the range of predictions generated within age categories. 13,323 individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (median age: 63 years; 91% male; 42% non-Hispanic Black). We observed 480/3,681 (13%) deaths in development, 253/2,151 (12%) deaths in the early validation cohort, and 403/7,491 (5%) deaths in the late validation cohort. Age, multimorbidity described with CCI, and a history of myocardial infarction or peripheral vascular disease were independently associated with mortality–no other individual comorbid diagnosis provided additional information. The VACO Index discriminated mortality in development (AUC = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.77–0.81), and in early (AUC = 0.81 95% CI: 0.78–0.83) and late (AUC = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.78–0.86) validation. The VACO Index allows personalized estimates of 30-day mortality after COVID-19 infection. For example, among those aged 60–64 years, overall mortality was estimated at 9% (95% CI: 6–11%). The Index further discriminated risk in this age stratum from 4% (95% CI: 3–7%) to 21% (95% CI: 12–31%), depending on sex and comorbid disease. Conclusion Prior to infection, demographics and comorbid conditions can discriminate COVID-19 mortality risk overall and within age strata. The VACO Index reproducibly identified individuals at substantial risk of COVID-19 mortality who might consider continuing social distancing, despite relaxed state and local guidelines."
https://openalex.org/W3098068096,"In late December 2019, an emerging viral infection COVID-19 was identified in Wuhan, China, and became a global pandemic. Characterization of the genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial in following and evaluating it spread across countries. In this study, we collected and analyzed 3,067 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from 55 countries during the first three months after the onset of this virus. Using comparative genomics analysis, we traced the profiles of the whole-genome mutations and compared the frequency of each mutation in the studied population. The accumulation of mutations during the epidemic period with their geographic locations was also monitored. The results showed 782 variants sites, of which 512 (65.47%) had a non-synonymous effect. Frequencies of mutated alleles revealed the presence of 68 recurrent mutations, including ten hotspot non-synonymous mutations with a prevalence higher than 0.10 in this population and distributed in six SARS-CoV-2 genes. The distribution of these recurrent mutations on the world map revealed that certain genotypes are specific to geographic locations. We also identified co-occurring mutations resulting in the presence of several haplotypes. Moreover, evolution over time has shown a mechanism of mutation co-accumulation which might affect the severity and spread of the SARS-CoV-2. The phylogentic analysis identified two major Clades C1 and C2 harboring mutations L3606F and G614D, respectively and both emerging for the first time in China. On the other hand, analysis of the selective pressure revealed the presence of negatively selected residues that could be taken into considerations as therapeutic targets. We have also created an inclusive unified database ( http://covid-19.medbiotech.ma ) that lists all of the genetic variants of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes found in this study with phylogeographic analysis around the world."

However, the neuronal circuits that underlie the effects of light on memory are still not well understood. The nucleus reuniens (Re) of the midline thalamus is highly conserved across species and is interconnected with the limbic systems, including the hippocampus (HPC) (Wouterlood et al., 1990Wouterlood F.G.

Notably, the Re is a target of multiple cortical and subcortical brain regions that appears to receive sensory input via different modalities (McKenna and Vertes, 2004McKenna J.T. Vertes R.P.

Lucas R.J. Multiple hypothalamic cell populations encoding distinct visual information.J. Physiol. 2011; 589: 1173-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The Re might therefore be important in mediating the effects of light on memory performance, which depends on the HPC. In this study, by combining conventional neurotracer and transneuronal virus tracing techniques, we identified a di-synaptic visual circuit connecting the retina and the Re in mice. In the retina, a subset of SMI-32-expressing ON-type retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) innervate CaMKIIα neurons in the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus and intergeniculate leaflet (vLGN/IGL), which in turn activate CaMKIIα neurons in the Re. The role of the retina-vLGN/IGL-Re pathway in the regulation of memory performance was investigated using an array of brain circuit interrogation tools, including c-Fos brain mapping, in vivo electrophysiological recording, and chemogenetics. We demonstrate that activation of the retina-vLGN/IGL-Re pathway underlies the spatial-memory-promoting effects of light treatment. To evaluate the effect of light treatment on memory performance, we first kept the home cages of the control and experimental animals on different layers of a custom-designed light cabinet for 3 weeks. The animals in the control group (Co) were housed under a 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. 12 h:12 h light/dark cycle (∼200 lux white ambient illumination). The animals in the experimental group (LT) were also housed under a 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. 12 h:12 h light/dark cycle (∼200 lux white ambient illumination) except for during light treatment (∼0 lux, 1,000 lux, 3,000 lux, or 5,000 lux white ambient illumination from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m.). Then, we assessed the novel object preference and object location memory of the mice using the novel object recognition (NOR) test and novel object location (NOL) test, respectively (Figures 1A and 1B ). We found that, although light treatment did not significantly alter recognition index values in the NOR test (Figure 1C; Figure S1A), it promoted spatial memory assessed by the NOL test in an intensity-dependent manner (Figure S1A), as light treatment at a strength of at least 3,000 lux was required to significantly promote spatial memory (Figures 1C and S1A). In addition, the spatial-memory-promoting effects of light treatment (3,000 lux, 2 h/day, 3 weeks) could last over 2 weeks after light treatment was terminated (Figure S1B). To further confirm whether light treatment (3,000 lux, 2 h/day, 3 weeks) could promote spatial memory, we next conducted the Morris water maze (MWM) to test spatial memory of the location of a hidden platform on the basis of surrounding contextual cues (Figure 1A). We subjected mice in both the Co and LT groups to a 2-day training session (3 trials/day), in which both groups identified the hidden platform over 6 successive training trials and exhibited no significant difference in escape latency (Figure 1D). During the probe trial, the mice in the LT group spent significantly more time exploring the quadrant that previously contained the platform (the target quadrant) (36.64% ± 2.94%), whereas the mice in the Co group explored the target quadrant by chance (20.39% ± 3.62%) (Figure 1E). We also found that light treatment did not significantly change the average velocity during the probe trial (Figure 1E), the optomotor response (OMR) tested under photopic and scotopic conditions (Figure 1F), or the general circadian rhythmicity assessed by the wheel-running test (WRT) (Figures 1G and S1F). These results confirm that long-term exposure to bright-light treatment promotes spatial memory without affecting the motor and visual functions or the circadian rhythm of mice. Next, we further probed which aspects of light treatment are important for its spatial-memory-promoting effects. To determine whether multiple days of light treatment are required to promote spatial memory, we compared the effects of 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 3 weeks, and 4 weeks of light treatment (3,000 lux, 2 h/day) on spatial memory assessed by the NOL test and found that the spatial-memory-promoting effects of light treatment appear to be dose dependent; at least 3 weeks of light treatment was needed to significantly promote spatial memory (Figure S1C). Given that the behavioral tests mentioned above were conducted in the afternoon (1 p.m. to 4 p.m.), to determine whether light treatment (3,000 lux, 2 h/day, 3 weeks) could also promote spatial memory tested in a different circadian phase, we performed the NOL test at night (8 p.m. to 11 p.m.) and found that animals in the LT group also displayed better NOL performance than did the Co group at night (Figure S1D). Finally, we tested whether light treatment applied at a different time of day could also promote spatial memory by performing light treatment (3,000 lux) between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. each day for 3 weeks. We found that light treatment administered during the afternoon also significantly promoted spatial memory (Figure S1E). Given that spatial memory evaluated in the NOL and MWM tests is highly HPC dependent and that synchronous neuronal activity in the HPC is relevant to spatial memory operations (Redish and Touretzky, 1998Redish A.D.

We first exposed the animals to 3 weeks of light treatment (3,000 lux, 2 h/day) and then recorded the local field potentials (LFPs) from the CA1 of the dorsal HPC as the animals performed the NOL test (Figure 2A). We found that gamma oscillation in the CA1 during exploration of the novel location was significantly increased in the LT group (Figures 2B–2D). In contrast, HPC oscillations in the theta and beta ranges were comparable between the Co and LT groups (Figures 2B–2D). In addition, we found that c-Fos expression in the HPC was significantly increased after 3 weeks of light treatment (Figure S2A), which further suggests that long-term exposure to light treatment could affect the neuronal activity in the HPC. To determine the potential brain regions through which light treatment could promote spatial memory and increase HPC gamma oscillation, we examined the effects of exposure to 3 weeks of light treatment (3,000 lux, 2 h/day) on c-Fos expression throughout the brain. In addition to the increased c-Fos expression in visual related-brain regions including the vLGN/IGL and superior colliculus (SC) (Figure S2A), c-Fos expression in the ventral midline thalamic Re was also significantly increased after 3 weeks of light treatment (Figure 2E). Given that growing evidence indicates that the Re is implicated in the regulation of HPC function and spatial memory operation (Loureiro et al., 2012Loureiro M. Cholvin T. Lopez J. Merienne N.

Funct. 2019; 224: 1659-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), we postulated that long-term exposure to light treatment might promote spatial memory and increase HPC gamma oscillation by modulating neuronal activity in the Re. To test this possibility, we first examined the effects of exposure to 3 weeks of light treatment (3,000 lux, 2 h/day) on the intrinsic physiological properties of Re neurons. We found that the current-evoked action potentials, spontaneous firing rate, frequency, and amplitude of the miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) of Re neurons were significantly increased in mice that received long-term exposure to light treatment (Figures 2F–2H), suggesting that long-term exposure to light treatment can increase the excitability of Re neurons by enhancing the excitatory inputs to the Re. Next, we evaluated whether the Re is required for light treatment to promote spatial memory and HPC gamma oscillation by globally silencing Re neurons with tetanus neurotoxin (TetTox), a molecular tool for synaptic inactivation (Xu and Südhof, 2013Xu W. Südhof T.C. A neural circuit for memory specificity and generalization.Science. 2013; 339: 1290-1295Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Three weeks of light treatment was conducted 2 weeks after the injection of AAV2/9-hSyn-TetTox-eYFP in the Re (Figures 2I and 2J). We found that global inactivation of the Re abolished the effects of light treatment on spatial memory and HPC gamma oscillation (Figures 2K–2M). In addition, we found that without light-treatment inactivation of the Re did not significantly alter the spatial memory assessed by the NOL test (Figure S2C). These results indicate that activation of the Re is required for light treatment to promote spatial memory and increase HPC gamma oscillation. In mammals, the retina is the only sensory organ directly responsive to light, and there is no evidence that RGCs can directly innervate the Re (Martersteck et al., 2017Martersteck E.M. Hirokawa K.E. Evarts M. Bernard A. Duan X. Li Y. Ng L. Oh S.W. Ouellette B. Royall J.J. et al.Diverse Central Projection Patterns of Retinal Ganglion Cells.Cell Rep. 2017; 18: 2058-2072Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Thus, the regulatory effects of light treatment on neuronal activity in the Re should be mediated by other brain regions located in the visual pathway. To determine the potential brain regions that might transmit light signals to the Re, we used a transsynaptic tracing method based on a modified rabies virus to examine the vision-related brain regions that could directly innervate the Re. Re neurons were first infected with AAV expressing the rabies glycoprotein and histone-tagged EGFP (Helper), which is required for the replication of rabies virus (Figures 3A and 3B ). Next, SAD-ΔG-DsRed (EnvA) (RV-DsRed) was injected into the Re to infect Helper+ Re neurons (Figures 3A–3C). The double-infected rabies-DsRed+/Glyco-EGFP+ Re neurons (starter cells) produced infectious ΔG-rabies-DsRed that propagated transneuronally to infect the neurons that formed synapses with them (Figures 3B and 3C). In addition to the well-characterized Re input from the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (Vertes et al., 2006Vertes R.P. Hoover W.B. Do Valle A.C. Sherman A. Rodriguez J.J.

Furthermore, c-Fos expression in both the vLGN/IGL and SC was significantly increased after long-term exposure to light treatment (Figure S2A). These results suggest that light treatment might regulate neuronal activity in the Re through activating the vLGN/IGL and SC. To explore which vision-related brain region might be important for the spatial-memory-promoting effects of light treatment, we measured the spatial memory in the NOL and MWM tests after chemogenetic inhibition of Re-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons and Re-projecting SC neurons, respectively, during light treatment (Figure 3D). We first delivered the monosynaptic retrograde transport virus rAAV2/2-Retro-Cre (Tervo et al., 2016Tervo D.G. Hwang B.Y. Viswanathan S. Gaj T. Lavzin M. Ritola K.D. Lindo S. Michael S. Kuleshova E. Ojala D. et al.A Designer AAV Variant Permits Efficient Retrograde Access to Projection Neurons.Neuron. 2016; 92: 372-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar) into the Re (Figure S3A) and infected Re-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons with a Cre-dependent virus encoding the neuronal inhibitor DREADD hM4Di (AAV2/9-DIO-hM4Di-mCherry) (Figure 3E). Three weeks of light treatment (3,000 lux, 2 h/day) was conducted 2 weeks after the virus injection, in which light treatment was performed every day 30 min after i.p. injection of clozapine N-oxide (CNO, 1 mg/kg) (Figures 3D and S3B). We found that chemogenetic inhibition of Re-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons significantly impaired the spatial-memory-promoting effects of light treatment (Figures 3F and S3C). In contrast, chemogenetic inhibition of Re-projecting SC neurons did not significantly alter the spatial-memory-promoting effects of light treatment (Figures 3G, 3H, S3B, and S3D). In addition, we found that without light-treatment inactivation of Re-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons or Re-projecting SC neurons did not significantly alter the spatial memory assessed by the NOL and MWM tests (Figures S3E and S3F). The above results indicate that activation of the vLGN/IGL but not the SC is required for the spatial-memory-promoting effects of light treatment. To determine how the vLGN/IGL regulates neuronal activity in the Re, we delivered rAAV2/2-Retro-Cre into the Re of C57BL/6 mice and a Cre-dependent virus encoding channelrhodopsin-2 and mCherry (AAV2/9-DIO-ChR2-mCherry) into the vLGN/IGL (Figures 4A and S4A). Next, we optogenetically activated vLGN/IGL-Re projections and recorded postsynaptic currents from Re neurons (Figure 4B). Optogenetically activating vLGN/IGL-Re projections evoked exclusively excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in 39.68% of recorded neurons, but both EPSCs and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in 36.51% of recorded neurons, in which the amplitude of EPSCs was higher than that of IPSCs (Figures 4C). Besides, the recorded postsynaptic currents were completely blocked by the application of TTX and recovered by the application of TTX/4-AP (Figure 4D), indicating that the postsynaptic currents recorded in Re neurons were elicited by direct synaptic connections between Re-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons and the recorded Re neurons. Furthermore, the excitatory effects of vLGN/IGL-Re projections could be blocked by the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist NBQX, while the inhibitory effects could be blocked by the GABAA receptor antagonist picrotoxin (PTX) (Figure 4E). In addition, we found that all recorded Re neurons that could respond to blue light stimulation were CaMKIIα neurons, which could further project to the CA1 of the HPC and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) (Figures 4B, S4B, and S4C). These results indicate that vLGN/IGL neurons transmit predominantly excitatory input to Re CaMKIIα neurons. To determine whether vLGN/IGL excitatory neurons could directly innervate the Re, we delivered a virus encoding a red fluorescent protein, mCherry (AAV2/9-CaMKIIα-mCherry), into the vLGN/IGL of C57BL/6 mice to selectively infect CaMKIIα neurons, after which we injected green fluorescent latex microspheres (retrobeads) into the Re to label Re-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons in a retrograde manner (Figure S4D). We found that approximately 94.1% of retrobeads-labeled Re-projecting neurons were colabeled with mCherry (Figure S4E). The above results indicate that a subset of vLGN/IGL CaMKIIα neurons activate Re CaMKIIα neurons through direct projections. In light of our finding that activation both Re neurons and Re-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons is required for the spatial-memory-promoting effects of long-term exposure to light treatment, we tested whether long-term activation of the vLGN/IGL-Re pathway could also promote spatial memory. We first delivered rAAV2/2-Retro-Cre into the Re and bilaterally infected Re-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons with a Cre-dependent virus encoding the neuronal activator DREADD hM3Dq (AAV2/9-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry) (Figure 5A). The Re-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons were activated daily via i.p. injection of CNO (1 mg/kg) for 3 weeks (Figures 5B and 5C). Long-term activation of Re-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons significantly promoted spatial memory in the NOL and MWM tests (Figures 5D, 5E, S5A, and S5B), which was accompanied by increased excitability of Re neurons (Figures 5F, 5G and S5C). In addition, long-term activation of Re-projecting vLGN/IGL neurons also significantly increased HPC gamma oscillation during the NOL test (Figures 5H and 5I). To further confirm whether long-term activation of the vLGN/IGL-Re pathway is sufficient to promote spatial memory, we next injected the monosynaptic antero"

This can be accomplished through metaproteomics, which characterizes the protein expression of microbiomes. Several software tools exist for analyzing microbiomes at the functional level by measuring their combined proteome-level response to environmental perturbations. In this survey, we explore the performance of six available tools, to enable researchers to make informed decisions regarding software choice based on their research goals. Tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomic data obtained from dental caries plaque samples grown with and without sucrose in paired biofilm reactors were used as representative data for this evaluation. Microbial peptides from one sample pair were identified by the X! tandem search algorithm via SearchGUI and subjected to functional analysis using software tools including eggNOG-mapper, MEGAN5, MetaGOmics, MetaProteomeAnalyzer (MPA), ProPHAnE, and Unipept to generate functional annotation through Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Among these software tools, notable differences in functional annotation were detected after comparing differentially expressed protein functional groups. Based on the generated GO terms of these tools we performed a peptide-level comparison to evaluate the quality of their functional annotations. A BLAST analysis against the NCBI non-redundant database revealed that the sensitivity and specificity of functional annotation varied between tools. For example, eggNOG-mapper mapped to the most number of GO terms, while Unipept generated more accurate GO terms. Based on our evaluation, metaproteomics researchers can choose the software according to their analytical needs and developers can use the resulting feedback to further optimize their algorithms. To make more of these tools accessible via scalable metaproteomics workflows, eggNOG-mapper and Unipept 4.0 were incorporated into the Galaxy platform."
https://openalex.org/W3104647550,"Aberrant expression of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) H19 and microRNA (miR)-29b has been implicated in the complications of diabetes mellitus (DM). As a common and important complication of DM, diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is characterized by high incidence and poor prognosis. Herein, we explored the role of lncRNA H19 in wound healing of DFU. Differentially expressed DM-related lncRNAs were initially screened by microarray data analysis. DFU models were then induced in DM mouse models. The functional role and interaction of lncRNA H19, miR-29b and FBN1 in DFU were subsequently determined by examining the proliferation, migration, and apoptosis of fibroblasts after silencing H19, inhibiting or overexpressing miR-29b and FBN1. According to microarray-based analysis, lncRNA H19 was upregulated in DM. In the ulcerative edge tissues of DFU, high expression of lncRNA H19 and FBN1 and low expression of miR-29b were observed. FBN1 was identified to be a target gene of miR-29b. LncRNA H19 could competitively bind to miR-29b, and then, inhibited its expression, which consequently upregulating FBN1. Silencing of lncRNA H19 led to inhibited proliferation, migration, and enhanced apoptosis of fibroblasts, accompanied by downregulated FBN1 but upregulated miR-29b, which diminished the expression of TGF-β1, Smad3, FN, and Col-1 and reduced extracellular matrix accumulation. Altogether, upregulation of lncRNA H19 can elevate the expression of FBN1 through competitively binding to miR-29b, which enhances the proliferation, migration, and inhibits apoptosis of fibroblasts, thus facilitating the wound healing of DFU."
https://openalex.org/W3105224624,"Tropical forest restoration initiatives are becoming more frequent worldwide in an effort to mitigate biodiversity loss and ecosystems degradation. However, there is little consensus on whether an active or a passive restoration strategy is more successful for recovering biodiversity because few studies make adequate comparisons. Furthermore, studies on animal responses to restoration are scarce compared to those on plants, and those that assess faunal recovery often focus on a single taxon, limiting the generalization of results. We assessed the success of active (native mixed-species plantations) and passive (natural regeneration) tropical cloud forest restoration strategies based on the responses of three animal taxa: amphibians, ants, and dung beetles. We compared community attributes of these three taxa in a 23-year-old active restoration forest, a 23-year-old passive restoration forest, a cattle pasture, and a mature forest, with emphasis on forest-specialist species. We also evaluated the relationship between faunal recovery and environmental variables. For all taxa, we found that recovery of species richness and composition were similar in active and passive restoration sites. However, recovery of forest specialists was enhanced through active restoration. For both forests under restoration, similarity in species composition of all faunal groups was 60–70% with respect to the reference ecosystem due to a replacement of generalist species by forest-specialist species. The recovery of faunal communities was mainly associated with canopy and leaf litter covers. We recommend implementing active restoration using mixed plantations of native tree species and, whenever possible, selecting sites close to mature forest to accelerate the recovery of tropical cloud forest biodiversity. As active restoration is more expensive than passive restoration, both strategies might be used in a complementary manner at the landscape level to compensate for high implementation costs."
https://openalex.org/W3104001696,"According to moral foundations theory, there are five distinct sources of moral intuition on which political liberals and conservatives differ. The present research program seeks to contextualize this taxonomy within the broader research literature on political ideology as motivated social cognition, including the observation that conservative judgments often serve system-justifying functions. In two studies, a combination of regression and path modeling techniques were used to explore the motivational underpinnings of ideological differences in moral intuitions. Consistent with our integrative model, the “binding” foundations (in-group loyalty, respect for authority, and purity) were associated with epistemic and existential needs to reduce uncertainty and threat and system justification tendencies, whereas the so-called “individualizing” foundations (fairness and avoidance of harm) were generally unrelated to epistemic and existential motives and were instead linked to empathic motivation. Taken as a whole, these results are consistent with the position taken by Hatemi, Crabtree, and Smith that moral “foundations” are themselves the product of motivated social cognition."

However, little is known how different PSL attributes, such as illuminance, light temperature, uniformity and glare, affect people's FoS in different contextual settings. The present study aims to bridge this knowledge gap by developing a model linking different PSL attributes with FoS, while controlling for individual, locational, environmental and temporal factors. To develop such model, the study employs a novel interactive user-oriented method, based on a specially-designed mobile phone application–CityLights TM . Using this app, a representative sample of observers reported their impressions of PSL attributes and FoS in three cities in Israel, following a set of predetermined routes and points. As the study shows, higher levels of illumination and uniformity positively affect FoS, while lights perceived as warm tend to generate higher FoS than lights perceived as cold. These findings may guide future illumination polices aimed at promoting energy efficiency while ensuring urban sustainability."

We confirm the EP3γ splice variant has both constitutive and agonist-sensitive activity to inhibit cAMP production and downstream beta-cell function, with both activities being dependent on the presence of beta-cell Gαz. A crucial factor in the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is failure of beta cells to adapt their secretory phenotype and/or mount a compensatory increase in mass in the face of peripheral insulin resistance (1Alejandro E.U.

Aspects Med. 2015; 42: 19-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In the beta cell, cAMP is a critical second messenger essential for proper beta-cell function (2Tengholm A. Gylfe E. cAMP signalling in insulin and glucagon secretion.Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2017; 19 Suppl 1: 42-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Synthesis of cAMP is primarily regulated by G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) and their associated heterotrimeric G protein complex. GPCR action and cAMP signaling are essential in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) response and ability of the beta cell to compensate under stress (2Tengholm A. Gylfe E. cAMP signalling in insulin and glucagon secretion.Diabetes Obes. Metab. 2017; 19 Suppl 1: 42-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A variety of T2D therapeutics bind to and activate the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP1R), which acts through Gs-subfamily proteins to increase the catalytic activity of adenylyl cyclase and downstream cAMP production (3Skugor M. Medical treatment of diabetes mellitus.Cleve Clin. J. Med. 2017; 84: S57-S61Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Conversely, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by G proteins of the Gi/o subfamily reduces cAMP levels and negatively regulates beta-cell function (4Kimple M.E. Neuman J.C. Linnemann A.K. Casey P.J.

Therefore, many questions remain as to the precise molecular and cellular mechanisms by which Gαz loss protects from hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance and whether beta-cell EP3 is actually a viable target for T2D therapeutics. In this study, we use islet transcriptomic analysis and beta-cell–specific Gαz-null (βKO) mice in the C57BL/6J (B6J) background to demonstrate, in the absence of alterations in the overall EP3 expression or activity of agonist-dependent EP3 variants, Gαz has differential effects on beta-cell function and mass depending on the pathophysiological context of the model. We have previously shown that male B6N mice deficient in a protein-coding exon of Gnaz, the gene encoding for Gαz, are fully protected from hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance, even after up to 26 to 30 weeks of consuming a 45 kcal% fat diet (HFD) starting at 11 weeks of age (8Kimple M.E.

Chem. 2012; 287: 20344-20355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). HFD feeding in Gαz KO mice approximately doubles functional beta-cell mass, independent of any changes in the weight gain, food intake, or insulin resistance as compared with WT HFD-fed controls (8Kimple M.E. Moss J.B. Brar H.K. Rosa T.C. Truchan N.A. Pasker R.L. Newgard C.B. Casey P.J. Deletion of GalphaZ protein protects against diet-induced glucose intolerance via expansion of beta-cell mass.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 20344-20355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To determine potential molecular pathways by which Gαz might influence the beta-cell compensation response, we performed a shorter (16-week) diet study—a feeding regimen chosen to limit potential confounding effects of long-term uncontrolled hyperglycemia—and isolated islets for exon array analyses. As with our previous cohort (8Kimple M.E. Moss J.B. Brar H.K. Rosa T.C. Truchan N.A. Pasker R.L. Newgard C.B. Casey P.J. Deletion of GalphaZ protein protects against diet-induced glucose intolerance via expansion of beta-cell mass.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 20344-20355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), there were no differences in baseline blood glucose or insulin tolerance by genotype (Fig. 1, A–B). After 16 weeks of control diet (CD) or HFD feeding, both HFD-fed groups were significantly heavier than CD-fed groups, and there were no differences in the body weight by genotype (Fig. 1C). The 4- to 6-h fasting blood glucose levels of WT HFD-fed mice were mildly elevated as compared with CD-fed animals (Fig. 1D), and Gαz loss essentially ameliorated the mild fasting hyperglycemia and oral glucose intolerance of male B6N mice after 16 weeks of HFD feeding (Fig. 1E). Gαz loss again had little-to-no effect on the development of insulin resistance, whether quantified by two-way ANOVA of the percentage baseline blood glucose curves (Fig. 1F, left) or by one-way ANOVA of the area under the curves from Y = 0 (Fig. 1F, right). Total islet RNA was subjected to exon-array gene chip analysis. Islet gene expression results from 5 WT CD-fed mice, 5 KO CD-fed mice, 4 WT HFD-fed mice, and 3 KO HFD-fed mice passed quality control tests and were used for downstream analysis. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed samples from each group segregated together, with islets from KO HFD-fed mice having the greatest differentiating gene expression profile among the four groups. The top 100 most significantly differentially expressed (SDE) genes across all comparisons are shown in Figure 2A, and the gene symbols according to their placement in the dendrogram can be found in Table S1. Of 16,291 expressed genes, 18 genes were SED (adjusted p-value < 0.05) between WT and KO CD-fed mice, 30 genes were SDE between WT CD-fed and HFD-fed mice, 4573 genes were SDE between WT and KO HFD-fed mice, and 7312 genes were SDE between KO CD-fed and HFD-fed mice (Fig. 2B). We applied a principal component analysis to all expressed genes and found the first two principal components accounted for approximately 50% of the variance in the levels of gene expression (Fig. 2C). The complete data set can be found in the NCBI gene expression omnibus database as accession ID GSE154325. To validate the microarray results by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), we selected from among the top 50+ upregulated and downregulated SDE genes between WT HFD and KO HFD (Tables S2 and S3, respectively) based on potential mechanistic relevance to a beta-cell secretion or the replication phenotype. These included genes encoding GPCRs (cholecystokinin A receptor; melanocortin 5 receptor; P2Y purinoceptor 14), regulators of GPCRs or G proteins (arrestin domain containing 4; regulator of G protein signaling 16), secreted peptides (Galanin; hepcidin antimicrobial protein; trefoil factor 2), metabolic enzymes producing secreted or excreted peptides or other factors (gamma-glutamyltransferase 1, phospholipase A2 group 1b), and cell-cycle genes (cyclin E2 [Ccne2]; cyclin-dependent kinase 10). The directionality of expression change between the two groups was validated for each gene, with many of these changes being statistically significant (Fig. 2, D–E). Notably, Ccne2 and cyclin-dependent kinase 10 were actually lower in islets from KO HFD-fed mice, with Ccne2 being significantly so (Fig. 2E, right bars). We identified pathways in which SDE genes were involved using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. Although there were no pathways in either analysis that were significantly different in islets from WT versus KO CD-fed mice, islets from HFD-fed mice showed significant changes in gene expression across several pathways when compared with diet or genotype controls (Fig. 3A). Focusing specifically on KEGG pathways altered between islets of HFD-fed WT versus KO mice, several pathways had decreased gene expression in KO mice, including protein-turnover related pathways such as those regulating the proteasome, ribosome biogenesis, RNA polymerase, RNA degradation, protein export, proteolysis, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, spliceosome, N-glycan biosynthesis, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, autophagy, mitophagy, and lysosome handling (Fig. 3, A–B and Table S4). (As nearly all the genes in the “metabolism” and “sphingolipid metabolism” pathways were components of other KEGG pathways, these were excluded in the heat map shown in Fig. 3A for clarity). Only four KEGG pathways were upregulated in HFD-fed KO islets versus HFD-fed WT islets—glycerolipid metabolism, protein digestion and absorption, fat digestion and absorption, and pancreatic secretion (Fig. 3, A–B and Table S4). Interestingly, these are the same four pathways significantly downregulated in WT CD versus WT HFD islets (Fig. 3C and Table S5). KO mice showed the inverse relationship, in that fat digestion and pancreatic secretion, as well as olfactory transduction, were upregulated by HFD feeding (Fig. 3C and Table S6). In all three comparisons, pancreatic secretion was the most significant differentially regulated KEGG pathway in HFD feeding (downadjusted p-value = 5.027 × 10−10, WT CD versus WT HFD; upadjusted p-value = 3.71 × 10−9, WT HFD versus KO HFD; and upadjusted p-value = 1.0 × 10−2 KO HFD versus KO CD). Figure 3D shows a diagram of the Log2 fold-change of the SDE genes in the pancreatic secretion pathway in WT HFD versus KO HFD, with a number of these as known regulators or effectors of cAMP signaling in the beta cell. These gene expression changes after 16 weeks of HFD feeding are associated with significantly higher ex vivo islet insulin secretion after 26 to 30 weeks of HFD feeding (Fig. 3E), at the same time that glucagon secretion is lower in islets from HFD-fed KO mice as than in WT mice (Fig. 3F). Therefore, the resistance of Gαz KO mice to HFD-induced glucose intolerance appears due to enhanced insulin secretory capacity and not a primary effect of Gαz loss on beta-cell replication. Furthermore, owing to the wholesale shift in pancreatic secretion pathways, many of which are associated with cAMP signaling, it is unlikely any one gene or handful of genes is responsible for this phenotype. Gαz protein expression is limited to the brain, retina, platelets, and pancreatic islets (10Kimple M.E. Manning D. G protein alpha z.

Handbook of Cell Signaling. 2nd Ed. Cambridge, MA2009: 1649-1653Google Scholar). To prove the effect of Gαz loss on protection from glucose intolerance is beta cell specific, we repeated the original extended HFD feeding study using a previously generated and validated βKO transgenic line in the B6J background (6Fenske R.J. Cadena M.T. Harenda Q.E. Wienkes H.N. Carbajal K. Schaid M.D. Laundre E. Brill A.L. Truchan N.A. Brar H. Wisinski J. Cai J. Graham T.E. Engin F. Kimple M.E. The inhibitory G protein alpha-subunit, galphaz, promotes type 1 diabetes-like pathophysiology in NOD mice.Endocrinology. 2017; 158: 1645-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Like the full-body Gαz KO mice in the B6N substrain, 12-week-old βKO had nearly identical glucose and insulin tolerance as their WT controls (Fig. 4, A–B). After 28 weeks of CD or HFD feeding, both HFD-fed groups were significantly heavier than CD-fed mice, with no differences in weight by genotype (Fig. 4C). As with the original B6N study (8Kimple M.E. Moss J.B. Brar H.K. Rosa T.C. Truchan N.A. Pasker R.L. Newgard C.B. Casey P.J. Deletion of GalphaZ protein protects against diet-induced glucose intolerance via expansion of beta-cell mass.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 20344-20355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), fasting blood glucose and glucose tolerance were severely impacted by HFD feeding in WT B6J mice: effects that were significantly decreased in βKO mice (Fig. 4, D–E). Yet, in contrast to our previous study, but consistent with prior B6J HFD studies (17Hogan M.F. Ravnskjaer K. Matsumura S. Huising M.O. Hull R.L. Kahn S.E. Montminy M.

High fat feeding unmasks variable insulin responses in male C57BL/6 mouse substrains.J. Endocrinol. 2017; 233: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), insulin sensitivity was only mildly affected by long-term HFD feeding and did not differ by genotype (Fig. 4F). Experimental evidence of the increased insulin sensitivity of lean B6J mice comes from the fact several young mice or CD-fed mice, regardless of the genotype, had to be rescued with glucose injection 30, 45, or 60 min after insulin injection (noted by ˆ in Fig. 4, B–F). In all of our previous studies in the B6N substrain, we have never had to rescue a mouse because of hypoglycemia during insulin tolerance tests (ITTs) (M.E.K., personal observations). Gαz KO mice in the B6N background display a synergistic increase in beta-cell replication with HFD feeding, resulting in significantly increased beta-cell mass (8Kimple M.E. Moss J.B. Brar H.K. Rosa T.C. Truchan N.A. Pasker R.L. Newgard C.B. Casey P.J. Deletion of GalphaZ protein protects against diet-induced glucose intolerance via expansion of beta-cell mass.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 20344-20355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Yet, although βKO mice in the B6J background have identical T2D protection as full-body Gαz KO mice in the B6N background, there is no individual or synergistic effect of HFD feeding or Gαz loss on the percentage of Ki67-positive beta cells (Fig. 5A). Although the mean Ki67 positivity of HFD-fed βKO beta cells is lower than that of the other three groups, this is not statistically significant (Fig. 5A, right), and, when the results are plotted on the same axis as those from the original HFD study in the B6N background (8Kimple M.E. Moss J.B. Brar H.K. Rosa T.C. Truchan N.A. Pasker R.L. Newgard C.B. Casey P.J. Deletion of GalphaZ protein protects against diet-induced glucose intolerance via expansion of beta-cell mass.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 20344-20355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), none of the data points exceed the mean Ki67 positivity of even CD-fed B6N beta cells (Fig. 5B). This phenotypic difference is also apparent in a lack of enhancement of the beta-cell fractional area in B6J mice by Gαz loss or HFD feeding (Fig. 5C). Although we did not record pancreas weights in the present study to calculate beta-cell mass, our original study found the greater influence of HFD feeding on beta-cell mass was the islet size/volume (8Kimple M.E. Moss J.B. Brar H.K. Rosa T.C. Truchan N.A. Pasker R.L. Newgard C.B. Casey P.J. Deletion of GalphaZ protein protects against diet-induced glucose intolerance via expansion of beta-cell mass.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 20344-20355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar): a value that may be hidden in beta-cell fractional area calculations if the volume of the pancreas is greater. Therefore, to be able to directly compare the results of our two studies, we normalized the insulin-positive slide area from densiometry analyses to the mean of their own WT control group, revealing the significant enhancement in Gαz KO insulin-positive area by HFD feeding in the B6N substrain is lost in the B6J substrain (Fig. 5D). A lack of effect of Gαz loss on beta-cell mass in the B6J substrain is further supported by quantifying islet insulin content, which is unchanged in HFD-fed βKO B6J mice (Fig. 5E), as compared with the 2-fold enhancement found in HFD-fed KO B6N mice (8Kimple M.E. Moss J.B. Brar H.K. Rosa T.C. Truchan N.A. Pasker R.L. Newgard C.B. Casey P.J. Deletion of GalphaZ protein protects against diet-induced glucose intolerance via expansion of beta-cell mass.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 20344-20355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Of all of the metabolic phenotypes tested (weight gain, insulin sensitivity, fasting blood glucose, and glucose tolerance), the only phenotype that was significantly different between our two studies was the apparent effect of HFD feeding on insulin sensitivity. Using the blood glucose levels at baseline and 30, 60, and 90 min after insulin challenge—the time points consistent among all of our studies—we calculated insulin areas under the curve (AUCs). Even at baseline (11 weeks of age), B6N mice are much less insulin sensitive than B6J mice, with insulin AUCs approximately one-third greater (Fig. 5F). Long-term CD feeding had little effect on insulin AUCs in either substrain, and, while the mean ITT AUC was higher in both HFD-fed groups than their own baseline, this was only statistically significant in the B6N background (Fig. 5F). Finally, long-term HFD feeding in the B6N background approximately doubled the ITT AUC, representative of the severe insulin resistance characterized in our previous work (8Kimple M.E. Moss J.B. Brar H.K. Rosa T.C. Truchan N.A. Pasker R.L. Newgard C.B. Casey P.J. Deletion of GalphaZ protein protects against diet-induced glucose intolerance via expansion of beta-cell mass.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 20344-20355Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). These substrain-specific differences are not a factor of beta-cell Cre expression, as insulin sensitivity of Cre-negative littermates was nearly identical (data not shown). Islets isolated from WT or Gαz βKO mice after 28 weeks of CD or HFD feeding were treated ex vivo with basal (1.7 mM) or stimulatory (16.7 mM) concentrations of glucose, the latter with or without 10-nM exendin-4 (Ex4), which acts through the cAMP-stimulatory GLP1R to potentiate GSIS (see model in Fig. 6G). Islets from all groups secreted more insulin in response to 16.7-mM glucose versus 1.7-mM glucose, although this difference was not statistically significant in islets from WT HFD-fed mice (Fig. 6A, solid versus dotted bars). Islets from both CD-fed groups had a strong (∼3-fold) potentiating response to 10-nM Ex4, whether shown as the ng/ml secreted insulin (Fig. 6A, solid versus diagonally striped bars) or the proportion of individual islet preparations secreting more insulin in glucose + Ex4 than glucose alone (Fig. 6B). In both cases, islets from WT HFD-fed B6J mice were essentially nonresponsive to Ex4 (Fig. 6, A–B). Islets from HFD-fed Gαz βKO mice, on the other hand, had a remarkably improved potentiation of GSIS with Ex4 (Fig. 6A), and all islet preparations were Ex4 responsive (Fig. 6B). The arachidonic acid metabolite, PGE2, is the most abundant native ligand for the cAMP-inhibitory EP3. Circulating PGE metabolite levels are elevated in human subjects with diabetes and in mouse models of the disease, including the extended HFD model used in this work (8Kimple M.E. Moss J.B. Brar H.K.

Weighted analyses and structural equation models were used. The results revealed that 8.8% were cybervictims, 3.1% were cyberaggressors and 4.9% cybervictims-cyberaggressors in Spain; whereas 8.7% were cybervictims, 5.1% were cyberaggressors and 14.3% were cybervictims-cyberaggressors in Ecuador. Cybervictimization could be predicted in both countries by means of self-deprecation and social skills, although the meaning of some skills was different depending on the country. Cyberaggression could be predicted in both countries by means of empathy, assertiveness, and conflict-resolution skills, as well as by communicative and relational skills. Self-deprecation was a predictor of cyberaggression only in Spain. These results are discussed, and educational inferences are drawn for prevention."
https://openalex.org/W3106473538,"Due to the large number of negative tests, individually screening large populations for rare pathogens can be wasteful and expensive. Sample pooling methods improve the efficiency of large-scale pathogen screening campaigns by reducing the number of tests and reagents required to accurately categorize positive and negative individuals. Such methods rely on group testing theory which mainly focuses on minimizing the total number of tests; however, many other practical concerns and tradeoffs must be considered when choosing an appropriate method for a given set of circumstances. Here we use computational simulations to determine how several theoretical approaches compare in terms of (a) the number of tests, to minimize costs and save reagents, (b) the number of sequential steps, to reduce the time it takes to complete the assay, (c) the number of samples per pool, to avoid the limits of detection, (d) simplicity, to reduce the risk of human error, and (e) robustness, to poor estimates of the number of positive samples. We found that established methods often perform very well in one area but very poorly in others. Therefore, we introduce and validate a new method which performs fairly well across each of the above criteria making it a good general use approach."

Two pathogenic mechanisms, which may not be mutually exclusive, have been proposed for FDD and FBD: 1) loss of BRI2 function; 2) accumulation of amyloidogenic mutant BRI2-derived peptides, but the mechanistic details remain unclear. We have previously reported a physiological role of BRI2 in excitatory synaptic transmission at both presynaptic termini and postsynaptic termini. To test whether pathogenic ITM2b mutations affect these physiological BRI2 functions, we analyzed glutamatergic transmission in FDD and FBD knock-in mice, which carry pathogenic FDD and FBD mutations into the mouse endogenous Itm2b gene. We show that in both mutant lines, spontaneous glutamate release and AMPAR-mediated responses are decreased, while short-term synaptic facilitation is increased, effects similar to those observed in Itm2bKO mice. In vivo and in vitro studies show that both pathogenic mutations alter maturation of BRI2 resulting in reduced levels of functional mature BRI2 protein at synapses. Collectively, the data show that FDD and FBD mutations cause a reduction of BRI2 levels and function at synapses, which results in reduced glutamatergic transmission. Notably, other genes mutated in Familial dementia, such as APP, PSEN1/PSEN2, are implicated in glutamatergic synaptic transmission, a function that is altered by pathogenic mutations. Thus, defects in excitatory neurotransmitter release may represent a general and convergent mechanism leading to neurodegeneration.

Targeting these dysfunction may offer a unique disease modifying method of therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative disorders. ITM2b/BRI2 gene is a gene that codes a type II membrane protein called BRI2. The immature BRI2 precursor (imBRI2) is cleaved at the C-terminus by proprotein convertase to produce the mature NH2-terminal BRI2 (mBRI2) and a COOH-terminal peptide of 23 amino acid called Bri23 (1Choi S.I. Vidal R. Frangione B. Levy E. Axonal transport of British and Danish amyloid peptides via secretory vesicles.FASEB J. 2004; 18: 373-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Two autosomal dominant mutations in ITM2b/BRI2 cause FDD and FBD. The FDD mutation consists of a 10-nucleotide duplication one codon before the normal stop codon (2Vidal R. Revesz T. Rostagno A. Kim E. Holton J.L. Bek T. Bojsen-Møller M. Braendgaard H. Plant G. Ghiso J. Frangione B.

A. 2000; 97: 4920-4925Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This produces a frameshift in the BRI2 sequence generating a precursor protein 11 amino acids larger than normal. In the British kindred, a point mutation at the stop codon of BRI2 results in a read-through of the 3’-untranslated region and the synthesis of a BRI2 molecule containing 11 extra amino acids at the COOH-terminus (3Vidal R. Frangione B. Rostagno A. Mead S. Révész T. Plant G. Ghiso J. A stop-codon mutation in the BRI gene associated with familial British dementia.Nature. 1999; 399: 776-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Convertase-mediated cleavage of immature mutant Danish and British BRI2 generates two distinct 34 amino acid long peptides, called ADan and ABri, respectively. Both peptides are deposited as amyloid fibrils. For clarity, we will refer to the wild-type imBRI2 as BRI2-Bri23, to the Danish mutant imBRI2 as BRI2-Adan, and to the British mutant imBRI2 as BRI2-ABri. Since all three imBRI2 proteins form the same mBRI2 polypeptide, all mBRI2 proteins will be referred to as mBRI2. Using a genetic approach to inactivate Itm2b in either presynaptic (CA3), or postsynaptic (CA1), or both (CA3+CA1) neurons of the hippocampal Schaeffer-collateral pathway (SC–CA3>CA1 synapses) in mice, we found a physiological role of Bri2 in the excitatory synaptic transmission (4Yao W. Yin T. Tambini M.D. D'Adamio L. The Familial dementia gene ITM2b/BRI2 facilitates glutamate transmission via both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Loss of Bri2 impairs glutamatergic neurotransmitter release and AMPAR-mediated responses in SC–CA3>CA1 synapses by a presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanism, respectively. This evidence suggests that Bri2 facilitates glutamate transmission via both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanism. Given the relevance of excitatory synaptic transmission to cognition and that BRI2 mutations cause neurodegeneration and dementia in humans, we tested whether the pathogenic Danish and British dementia mutations will alter, one way or another, this physiological function of BRI2. To test this hypothesis, we studied glutamatergic neurotransmission in SC–CA3>CA1 synapses of mice carrying the pathogenic Danish and British dementia mutations (Itm2bD/D and Itm2bB/B mice) into the Itm2b mouse gene (5Tamayev R. Matsuda S. Fa M. Arancio O. D'Adamio L. Danish dementia mice suggest that loss of function and not the amyloid cascade causes synaptic plasticity and memory deficits.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Generation and initial characterization of FDD knock in mice.PLoS One. 2009; 4e7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We choose a knock-in (KI) approach because: a) KIs mimic familial dementia genetics and make no assumption about pathogenic mechanisms; b) expression of mutant genes is controlled by endogenous regulatory elements, thereby allowing us to test the hypothesis in a biologically relevant model organism. This strategy allows examination of the effects of pathogenic Itm2b mutations on the function of Bri2 in excitatory synaptic transmission on both presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons of the Schaeffer-collateral pathway. Itm2bD/D and Itm2bB/B mice were derived as described previously (5Tamayev R. Matsuda S. Fa M. Arancio O. D'Adamio L.

Generation and initial characterization of FDD knock in mice.PLoS One. 2009; 4e7900Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To test whether these pathogenic mutations alter the synaptic function of Bri2 in the excitatory synaptic transmission at SC–CA3>CA1 synapses (4Yao W. Yin T. Tambini M.D. D'Adamio L. The Familial dementia gene ITM2b/BRI2 facilitates glutamate transmission via both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), we compared the following genotypes: Itm2bWT/WT, Itm2bKO/KO (mice carrying two knockout Itm2b alleles), Itm2bD/D (mice carrying two Itm2b alleles with the Danish mutation), and Itm2bB/B (mice carrying two Itm2b alleles with the British mutation). Synaptic transmission was studied in 4 to 6-month-old Itm2bWT/WT (three males and three females), Itm2bKO/KO (three males and three females), Itm2bD/D (three males and three females), and Itm2bB/B (four males and three females) mice. First, we analyzed miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSC), the frequency of which is also determined, in part, by the probability of synaptic vesicles release (Pr) (8Zucker R.S. Regehr W.G. Short-term synaptic plasticity.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 355-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2875) Google Scholar): a decrease in Pr leads to a decrease in frequency and vice versa. As previously shown (4Yao W. Yin T. Tambini M.D. D'Adamio L. The Familial dementia gene ITM2b/BRI2 facilitates glutamate transmission via both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and in accord with the hypothesis that endogenous Bri2 facilitates glutamate release, the frequency of mEPSC was reduced in Itm2bKO/KO mice (Fig. 1, A–C). The British and Danish Itm2b mutations acted analogously, both causing a reduction in the frequency of mEPSC (Fig. 1, A–C). The amplitude of mEPSC is dependent on postsynaptic AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptor (AMPAR-mediated responses). Consistently with our previous report, the amplitude of mEPSC was significantly decreased in Itm2bKO/KO mice (Fig. 1, D, E and G). Like for the mEPSC frequency, Itm2bD/D and Itm2bB/B mice showed a phenotype similar to Itm2bKO/KO animals (Fig. 1, D, E and G). The decay time of mEPSC was slightly higher in all mutant lines: however, this slight increase reached statistical significance only for the Itm2bD/D mice (Fig. 1F). Next, we measured AMPAR and NMDAR-dependent synaptic responses. Consistent with the hypothesis that Bri2 boosts AMPAR-mediated responses, the AMPA/NMDA ratio was reduced in Itm2bKO/KO mice (Fig. 1H). Once again, a similar decrease was observed in Itm2bD/D and Itm2bB/B mice (Fig. 1H). Finally, we examined the effect of Itm2b inactivation and pathogenic mutations on paired-pulse facilitation (PPF). PPF is a form of short-term synaptic plasticity that is determined, at least in part, by changes in Pr of glutamatergic synaptic vesicles (SV): inversely to mEPSC frequency, a decrease in Pr leads to an increase in facilitation and vice versa (8Zucker R.S. Regehr W.G. Short-term synaptic plasticity.Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 355-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2875) Google Scholar). Previous studies on older mice showed that PPF at 50 ms interstimulus interval (ISI), but not at 200 ms ISI, was significantly increased in Itm2bKO/KO mice (4Yao W. Yin T. Tambini M.D. D'Adamio L. The Familial dementia gene ITM2b/BRI2 facilitates glutamate transmission via both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). In this set of studies, facilitation at 50 ms ISI was increased in Itm2bKO/KO: however, this increase did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 1I). This discrepancy with our previous report is probably due to the lower number of recordings analyzed here. Yet, both Itm2bD/D and Itm2bB/B mice showed increased PPF as compared with control Itm2bWT/WT animals at 50 ms ISI (Fig. 1). Overall, our data indicate that Itm2b inactivation and both Danish and British pathogenic Itm2b mutations alter glutamatergic synaptic transmission at excitatory hippocampal SC–CA3>CA1 synapses analogously. The evidence that genetic inactivation of Bri2 expression in pre- and postsynaptic neurons reduced excitatory synaptic transmission at hippocampal SC-CA3>CA1 synapse indicates that neuronal, and perhaps synaptic, mBri2 expression is important for physiological glutamate transmission. To determine whether the synaptic impairment in Itm2bB/B and Itm2bD/D mice is associated with loss of mBri2 at synapses, we examined Bri2 expression in synaptoneurosome fraction (Fig. 2A shows the quality of synaptosomal fractions) prepared from whole brain lysates of 4 to 6-month-old mice (n = 6 for each genotype). We observed the following: 1) Bri2 is present in synaptoneurosomes (Fig. 2, A–B); 2) only mBri2 is found in synaptoneurosomes (Fig. 2, A–B), which is consistent with the evidence that only mature Bri2 transported to surface membrane (9Matsuda S. Matsuda Y. Snapp E.L. D'Adamio L. Maturation of BRI2 generates a specific inhibitor that reduces APP processing at the plasma membrane and in endocytic vesicles.Neurobiol. Aging. 2011; 32: 1400-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar); 3) mBri2 expression is significantly and similarly reduced in Itm2bB/B and Itm2bD/D mice compared with Itm2bWT/WT mice (Fig. 2, B–C). These results may explain why glutamatergic synaptic transmission is similarly affected in Itm2bKO/KO, Itm2bB/B, and Itm2bD/D mice. The synaptoneurosome preparation includes synaptic elements from both excitatory and inhibitory neurons. To ascertain Itm2b mRNA expression in various neuronal populations, we analyzed publicly available scRNA-seq to test Itm2b mRNA coexpression with GABAA-receptor (Gabra1, Gabrb3, Gabrg2), AMPA-receptor (Gria1, Gria2, Gria3, Gria4), and NMDA-receptor (Grin1, Grin2a, Grin2b) genes. This analysis shows similar levels of coexpression of Itm2b with these neuronal markers (Fig. 2D). In addition, we determine coexpression of Itm2b with Slc32a1, which encodes for the vesicular inhibitory amino acid transporter Viaat and is a marker of inhibitory neurons, Slc17a7 and Slc17a6, which encode for vesicular glutamate transporter 1 Vglut1 and vesicular glutamate transporter 2 Vglut2, respectively, and are markers of excitatory neurons. The results suggest that Itm2b mRNA is equally expressed in excitatory and inhibitory neurons (Fig. 2D). This data suggest that it will be worth, in future experiments, testing the role of Bri2 and the effects of the Danish and British mutations on GABAergic transmission as well. To investigate how the British and Danish pathogenic mutations affect BRI2 expression, we transfected HeLa cell with constructs driving expression of either BRI2-Bri23, BRI2-Adan, or BRI2-ABri fused to a Flag-peptide epitope at the NH2-teminus (ITM2bF-WT, ITM2bF-D, and ITM2bF-B, driving expression of F-BRI2-Bri23, F-BRI2-Adan, and F-BRI2-ABri, respectively). The levels of mF-BRI2 were significantly higher in Itm2bF-WT lysate as compared with Itm2bF-B and Itm2bF-D (Fig. 3, A–B). Also, the levels of F-BRI2-Bri23 were significantly higher compared with F-BRI2-ADan and F-BRI2-ABri (Fig. 3, A–B). In addition, the ratio of mF-BRI2 to immature F-BRI2 precursor proteins was lower in Itm2bF-B and Itm2bF-D as compared with Itm2bF-WT transfected cells: this difference was highly significant for Itm2bF-D samples (Fig. 3, A–B). Although potential differences in transfection efficiencies may be confounding factors, together these data suggest that the British and Danish pathogenic mutations reduce stability and maturation of precursor BRI2-ADan and BRI2-ABri as compared with wild-type BRI2-Bri23. To further analyze the effect of pathogenic mutation on BRI2 polypeptides trafficking to cell membranes, HeLa cells transfected with BRI2 constructs were surface biotinylated, and the lysates were precipitated with streptavidin (SA) beads to isolate cell membrane proteins (fraction B). Unbound fraction (supernatant fraction U) contains proteins that are not present on the cell membrane and/or exposed to extracellular space. Analysis of the total lysate (T) and fractions B and U confirmed that mBRI2, but not BRI2-Bri23, BRI2-Adan, and BRI2-ABri, was present on the cell surface (fraction B, Fig. 3, C–D). Given the reduction in mBRI2 levels, Itm2bF-B and Itm2bF-D transfected cells presented significantly reduced levels of mBRI2 localized to the plasma membrane compared with Itm2bF-WT transfected cells (fraction B, Fig. 3, C–D). Plasma membrane BRI2 undergoes an additional cleavage by ADAM10 in its ectodomain (10Martin L. Fluhrer R. Reiss K. Kremmer E. Saftig P. Haass C. Regulated intramembrane proteolysis of Bri2 (Itm2b) by ADAM10 and SPPL2a/SPPL2b.J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 1644-1652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). This cleavage releases a soluble variant of BRI2 and a membrane-bound BRI2 N-terminal fragment (BRI2-NTF). As shown in Figure 3C, BRI2-NTFs are visible (and are biotinylated indicating the presence on plasma membranes) in cells transfected with WT BRI2 but not FDD and FBD mutant BRI2, supporting the notion that more mBRI2 is generated from BRI2-Bri23 as compared with BRI2-ADan and BRI2-ABri. While in synaptoneurosome (Fig. 2B) the two pathogenic mutations seem to reduce equally mBri2 levels, there is a more pronounced difference for BRI2-ADan than BRI2-ABri on mBRI2 in HeLa cells, suggesting that the Danish and British mutations may impair maturation of Bri2 in a quantitatively distinct manner in different cell types.Figure 5Distinct degradation pathways of wild-type and mutant Bri2 forms in primary neuron isolated from Itm2bWT/WT, Itm2bB/B, and Itm2bD/D mice.

A, BRI2 is synthesized in the ER as an immature precursors (BRI2-Bri23) that is cleaved in the Golgi apparatus at the C-terminus by proprotein convertase to produce the mature (mBRI2) and the COOH-terminal peptide Bri23. mBRI2 is transported to the plasma membrane where it can undergo an additional cleavage by ADAM10 in its ectodomain. This cleavage releases sBRI2 and the membrane-bound BRI2-NTF. Both mBRI2 and BRI2-NTF are endocytosed and degraded by the lysosomes. B, the Danish mutation changes the last amino acid of BRI2 and adds 11 additional amino acids at the COOH-terminus. The British mutations add 11 extra amino acids, which are different from those added by the Danish mutation, at the COOH-terminus as well. A fraction of immature mutant Danish (BRI2-ADan) and British (BRI2-ABri) BRI2 traffic to the Golgi where convertase cleavage generates mBRI2 and two distinct 34 amino acid long peptides, called ADan and ABri, respectively. ADan and ABri can form amyloid fibrils. It is important noting that mBRI2 produced by these pathogenic precursors is identical to the wild-type mBRI2. Large fractions of BRI2-ADan and BRI2-ABri are targeted for ERLAD. It is likely that the ADan and ABri sequences may cause misfolding of BRI2-ADan and BRI2-ABri in the ER.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To better describe trafficking of wild-type and mutant BRI2 proteins, we transfected the F-BRI2 constructs in N2A cells with differentiation and visualized the distribution of BRI2 polypeptides by immunocytochemistry (Fig. 4A). This experiment is not used as a proxy for synaptic localization of BRI2. We defined two types of BRI2 staining patterns: identifiable surface membrane staining (compatible with plasma membrane BRI2 localization) versus internal staining compatible with BRI2 localization in endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, and/or other cytosolic organelles (Fig. 4B). Based on these parameters, we quantified a significant reduction of cells with identifiable surface membrane staining but a significant increase in cells with internal staining in Itm2bF-B and Itm2bF-D transfected cells compared with Itm2bF-WT transfected cells (Fig. 4C). Consistent with these changes, surface biotinylation of transfected N2A cells showed reduced levels of mBRI2 localized to the plasma membrane in Itm2bF-B and Itm2bF-D transfected cells compared with Itm2bF-WT transfected cells (Fig. 4C). Also, in this experiment, BRI2-NTFs are visible and detectable on the plasma membrane in cells transfected with WT BRI2 but not FDD and FBD mutant BRI2 In summary, these observations indicate that pathogenic mutation reduces maturation and plasma membrane localization of mBRI2. Transmembrane proteins that enter the ER, but fail to attain the native structure, are rapidly degraded to prevent toxic accumulation of aberrant gene products. These proteins are delivered to endo-lysosome for clearance by autophagic and nonautophagic pathways collectively defined as ER-to-lysosomes-associated degradation (ERLAD) (11Fregno I. Molinari M. Proteasomal and lysosomal clearance of faulty secretory proteins: ER-associated degradation (ERAD) and ER-to-lysosome-associated degradation (ERLAD) pathways.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2019; 54: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To investigate whether such a mechanism could underlie the maturation deficit and the reduction of mBRI2 caused by the Danish/British mutations, we prepared primary hippocampus neurons from Itm2bWT/WT, Itm2bB/B, and Itm2bD/D mice. Primary neurons were treated with the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine. The first noteworthy observation is that without treatment, the steady-state levels of mBri2, Bri2-NTF as well as the ratio of m/im forms of Bri2 were significantly reduced in Itm2bB/B and Itm2bD/D neurons as compared with Itm2bWT/WT neurons (Fig. 5A). This observation parallels what seen in cell lines expressing human wild-type and mutant BRI2. The evidence that chloroquine significantly reduced the LC3A I/LC3A II and LC3B I/LC3B II ratios indicates inhibition of lysosome-mediated degradation. In contrast, GAPDH levels are not changed by chloroquine treatment indicating specificity and lack of toxicity (Fig. 5, A–B). In neurons derived from Itm2bWT/WT hippocampi, chloroquine caused a significant and predominant accumulation of mBri2, suggesting that mBri2 may be degraded by lysosome after endocytosis from plasma membranes. In contrast, chloroquine treatment caused exclusively a considerable accumulation of BRI2-ABri and BRI2-ADan in Itm2bB/B and Itm2bD/D neurons, respectively (Fig. 5, A–B). Our studies suggest that BRI2-ADan and BRI2-ABri may be targeted for ERLAD. The evidence that ADan and ABri peptides tend to aggregate and form amyloid deposits (2Vidal R. Revesz T. Rostagno A.

However, a fraction of BRI2-ADan and BRI2-ABri must escape lysosomal degradation and traffic through the trans-Golgi where a convertase removes the ADan and ABri peptides, since: 1) ADan and ABri peptides are produced in humans carrying the Danish and British mutation, respectively (2Vidal R.

In the central nervous system, these maturation anomalies lead to partial loss of mBri2 in synaptoneurosomes (Fig. 2), reduced glutamatergic neurotransmitter release, and AMPAR-mediated responses in Itm2bB/B and Itm2bD/D animals (Fig. 1). Although future studies are needed to assess whether these excitatory synapses dysfunctions described here are pathologically relevant, the evidence presented here is noteworthy because also other genes mutated in Familial forms of dementia, such as APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2, are implicated in glutamatergic synaptic transmission.

https://openalex.org/W3102985049,"Understanding the factors that influence predator-prey dynamics requires an investigation of oscillations in predator and prey population sizes over time. However, empirical studies are often performed over one or fewer predator generations. This is particularly true for studies addressing the non-consumptive effects of predators on prey. In a previous study that lasted less than one predator generation, we demonstrated that two species of parasitoid wasps additively suppressed aphid populations through a combination of consumptive and non-consumptive effects. However, the non-consumptive effects of one wasp reduced the reproductive success of the other, suggesting that a longer-term experiment may have revealed antagonism between the wasps. The goal of our current study is to evaluate multi-generation consumptive and non-consumptive interactions between pea aphids ( Acyrthosiphon pisum ) and the wasps Aphidius ervi and Aphidius colemani . Aphidius ervi is a common natural enemy of pea aphids. Aphidius colemani is a non-consumptive enemy that does not consume pea aphids, but negatively affects pea aphid performance through behavioral disturbance. Large field cages were installed to monitor aphid abundance in response to the presence and absence of both species of wasp over four weeks (two parasitoid generations). We found that the non-consumptive enemy A . colemani initially controlled the pea aphid population, but control in the absence of parasitism was not sustainable over the long term. Aphidius ervi suppressed pea aphids through a combination of consumptive and non-consumptive effects. This suppression was more effective than that of A . colemani , but aphid abundance fluctuated over time. Suppression by A . ervi and A . colemani together was complementary, leading to the most effective and stable control of pea aphids. Therefore, promoting a diverse natural enemy community that contributes to pest control through consumptive and non-consumptive interactions may enhance the stability of herbivore population suppression over time."

A total of 737 women were recruited from two sites, a community health clinic (n = 413) and a referral clinic (n = 324) in the Eastern Cape Province. Cervical clinician-collected (FTA cards and Digene transport medium) and vaginal self-collected specimens were tested for HR-HPV using the hpVIR assay (FTA cards) and Hybrid Capture-2 (Digene transport medium). There was no significant difference in HR-HPV positivity between clinician-collected and self-collected specimens among women from the community-based clinic (26.4% vs 27.9%, p = 0.601) or the referral clinic (83.6% vs 79.9%, p = 0.222). HPV16, HPV35, and HPV33/52/58 group were the most frequently detected genotypes at both study sites. Self-sampling for HPV testing received a high positive response of acceptance (77.2% in the community-based clinic and 83.0% in referral clinic). The overall agreement between hpVIR assay and HC-2 was 87.7% (k = 0.754). The study found good agreement between clinician-collected and self-collected genital specimens. Self-collection can have a positive impact on a cervical screening program in South Africa by increasing coverage of women in rural areas, in particular those unable to visit the clinics and women attending clinics where cytology-based programs are not functioning effectively."

After excluding 100 patients who were beyond Milan criteria, with incomplete lab data, or had follow-up less than three months, a total of 349 patient cases were compiled and their baseline characteristics, further treatment modalities after tumor recurrence and survival were analyzed. Results After a median follow-up of 36.2 months, 92 patients had expired. The majority of patients were male (59.9%) with a median age of 64.3 years (range:38–88). The cumulative 5-year overall survival (OS) rates after treatment for recurrent HCC was 67.2%. On multivariate analysis, end-stage renal disease(Hazard ratio (H.R.) = 2.33, p = 0.021), m-ALBI grade 2a (H.R. = 2.86, p = 0.003) and m-ALBI grades 2b or 3 (H.R. = 2.30, p = 0.009), APRI greater than 1 (H.R. = 1.92, p = 0.036) and 2 nd recurrence occurring within 1 year (H.R. = 2.69, p&lt;0.001) were significantly associated with worse survival. The cumulative 5-year 2 nd recurrence rate was 87.4%. On multivariate analysis, male gender (H.R. = 1.47, p = 0.01), age greater than 65 years (H.R. = 1.72, p&lt;0.001), an alpha fetoprotein level greater than 20ng/ml (H.R. = 1.41, p = 0.016), surgical treatment for recurrent HCC (H.R. = 0.25, p = 0.007), tumor number greater than 1 (H.R. = 1.35, p = 0.046), and IDR developing within 2 years (H.R. = 1.67, p = 0.001) were prognostic factors for 2 nd recurrence. Conclusion Our study suggested that presence of end-stage renal disease, m-ALBI grades 2 and 3, APRI &gt;1 and time to 2 nd HCC recurrence were all associated with overall survival while the 2 nd HCC recurrence was associated with male gender, age ≥65 years, α-fetoprotein level &gt;20 ng/mL, non-surgical therapy, time to IDR, and tumor number&gt; 1."
https://openalex.org/W3048023842,"RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has allowed for transcriptional profiling of biological systems through the identification of differentially expressed (DE) genes and pathways. A total of 80 steers with extreme phenotypes were selected from the University of Florida multibreed Angus-Brahman herd. The average slaughter age was 12.91±8.69 months. Tenderness, juiciness and connective tissue assessed by sensory panel, along with marbling, Warner-Bratzler Shear Force (WBSF) and cooking loss, were measured in longissimus dorsi muscle. Total RNA was extracted from muscle and one RNA-seq library per sample was constructed, multiplexed, and sequenced based on protocols by Illumina HiSeq-3000 platform to generate 2×101 bp paired-end reads. The overall read mapping rate using the Btau_4.6.1 reference genome was 63%. A total of 8,799 genes were analyzed using two different methodologies, an expression association and a DE analysis. A gene and exon expression association analysis was carried out using a meat quality index on all 80 samples as a continuous response variable. The expression of 208 genes and 3,280 exons from 1,565 genes was associated with the meat quality index (p-value ≤ 0.05). A gene and isoform DE evaluation was performed analyzing two groups with extreme WBSF, tenderness and marbling. A total of 676 (adjusted p-value≤0.05), 70 (adjusted p-value≤0.1) and 198 (adjusted p-value≤0.1) genes were DE for WBSF, tenderness and marbling, respectively. A total of 106 isoforms from 98 genes for WBSF, 13 isoforms from 13 genes for tenderness and 43 isoforms from 42 genes for marbling (FDR≤0.1) were DE. Cytoskeletal and transmembrane anchoring genes and pathways were identified in the expression association, DE and the gene enrichment analyses; these proteins can have a direct effect on meat quality. Cytoskeletal proteins and transmembrane anchoring molecules can influence meat quality by allowing cytoskeletal interaction with myocyte and organelle membranes, contributing to cytoskeletal structure and architecture maintenance postmortem."
https://openalex.org/W3098318979,"Precision medicine holds great promise for improving health and reducing health disparities that can be most fully realized by advancing diversity and inclusion in research participants. Without engaging underrepresented groups, precision medicine could not only fail to achieve its promise but also further exacerbate the health disparities already burdening the most vulnerable. Yet underrepresentation by people of non-European ancestry continues in precision medicine research and there are disparities across racial groups in the uptake of precision medicine applications and services. Studies have explored possible explanations for population differences in precision medicine participation, but full appreciation of the factors involved is still developing. To better inform the potential for addressing health disparities through PM, we assessed the relationship of precision medicine knowledge and trust in biomedical research with sociodemographic variables. Using a series of linear regression models applied to survey data collected in a diverse sample, we analyzed variation in both precision medicine knowledge and trust in biomedical research with socioeconomic factors as a way to understand the range of precision medicine knowledge (PMK) in a broadly representative group and its relationship to trust in research and demographic characteristics. Our results demonstrate that identifying as Black, while significantly PMK, explains only 1.5% of the PMK variance in unadjusted models and 7% of overall variance in models adjusted for meaningful covariates such as age, marital status, employment, and education. We also found a positive association between PMK and trust in biomedical research. These results indicate that race is a factor affecting PMK, even after accounting for differences in sociodemographic variables. Additional work is needed, however, to identify other factors contributing to variation in PMK as we work to increase diversity and inclusion in precision medicine applications."
https://openalex.org/W3103640239,"Climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events, such as extended heat waves and droughts in the northern hemisphere. Besides affecting ecosystems worldwide, these changes in climate patterns will also affect the environmental health of human populations. While the medical community is mostly concerned with the negative impact of climate change, there might also be some beneficial effects. In this study we used laboratory data from a large university clinic in Germany (n = 13 406), to test for any detectable impact of two extreme summers on Vitamin-D [25(OH)D] plasma concentrations over a six year period (2014–2019). For the two years with extreme summers (2018 and 2019) the 25(OH)D plasma concentrations were significantly higher than in the previous four years (p &lt; 0.001). A time series analysis (autoregressive term, AR, φ = 0.84, with an AR of one indicating a persistent effect) showed that 25(OH)D concentrations rise by 0.04 nmol/l (95% CI: 0.04–0.05 nmol/l) per hour of sunshine. The incidence of vitamin D deficiency was generally high (60% for 2014–2017) but dropped by 10% in 2018 and 2019. As such, the summers of 2018 and 2019, which are among the hottest and driest in Germany since the start of modern climate recordings, had a measurable positive effect on 25(OH)D plasma levels of the examined population. Given that 25(OH)D deficiency is widespread in higher latitudes, this implies that while mostly considered negative, climate change might also confer some health benefits with regard to vitamin D related medical conditions."
https://openalex.org/W3097994498,"Prohibitin 1 (Phb1) is a pleiotropic protein with multiple functions in mammalian cells including cell cycle regulation and mitochondrial protein stabilization. It has been proposed as a potential therapeutic target for a variety of diseases including inflammatory diseases. In this study, we investigated the potential immune-modulatory functions of Phb1 and anti-inflammatory properties of S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) using macrophages, which play a major role in the innate immune system. The results showed that expressions of Phb1 mRNA and protein were reduced in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells ( p &lt;0.05). Phb1 knockdown further ameliorated the mRNA expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL10 in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. SAMe significantly attenuated LPS-induced inflammatory responses such as IL-1β, IL-10, Nos2, and NO production in the presence of siPhb1 . Luciferase reporter assay was conducted to determine the mechanisms underlying the effects of Phb1 and SAMe on the immune system. The luciferase activity of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) was significantly increased in LPS-treated RAW 264.7 cells. In addition, the luciferase reporter assay showed increased NF-κB activation in Phb1 knockdown RAW 264.7 cells ( p &lt;0.1) and SAMe treatment attenuated the NF-κB luciferase activity in Phb1 knockdown RAW 264.7 cells. Based on the results, we concluded that Phb1 possibly modulates the inflammatory response whereas SAMe has an anti-inflammatory effect on Phb1 knockdown macrophage cells. Furthermore, Phb1 expression level has potential properties of affecting on innate immune system by modulating the NF-κB signaling pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3102502550,"Calcium salts of long-chain fatty acids (CSFA) from linseed oil have the potential to reduce methane (CH 4 ) production from ruminants; however, there is little information on the effect of supplementary CSFA on rumen microbiome as well as CH 4 production. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of supplementary CSFA on ruminal fermentation, digestibility, CH 4 production, and rumen microbiome in vitro . We compared five treatments: three CSFA concentrations—0% (CON), 2.25% (FAL) and 4.50% (FAH) on a dry matter (DM) basis—15 mM of fumarate (FUM), and 20 mg/kg DM of monensin (MON). The results showed that the proportions of propionate in FAL, FAH, FUM, and MON were increased, compared with CON (P &lt; 0.05). Although DM and neutral detergent fiber expressed exclusive of residual ash (NDFom) digestibility decreased in FAL and FAH compared to those in CON (P &lt; 0.05), DM digestibility-adjusted CH 4 production in FAL and FAH was reduced by 38.2% and 63.0%, respectively, compared with that in CON (P &lt; 0.05). The genera Ruminobacter , Succinivibri o, Succiniclasticum , Streptococcus , Selenomonas . 1 , and Megasphaera , which are related to propionate production, were increased (P &lt; 0.05), while Methanobrevibacter and protozoa counts, which are associated with CH 4 production, were decreased in FAH, compared with CON (P &lt; 0.05). The results suggested that the inclusion of CSFA significantly changed the rumen microbiome, leading to the acceleration of propionate production and the reduction of CH 4 production. In conclusion, although further in vivo study is needed to evaluate the reduction effect on rumen CH 4 production, CSFA may be a promising candidate for reduction of CH 4 emission from ruminants."
https://openalex.org/W3103361812,"More virulent and aggressive races of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ), the pathogen causing wheat stripe rust, have been spreading around the world since 2000 causing large grain yield losses. A better understanding of the genome and genetic diversity of these new Pst races will be useful to develop new strategies to ameliorate these losses. In this study, we generated an improved genome assembly of a post-2000 virulent race from the Western USA designated as PST-130. We implemented a haplotype phasing strategy using the diploid-aware assembler, Falcon-Unzip and new long-read technology from PacBio to phase the two genomes of this dikaryotic organism. The combination of these new technologies resulted in an improved PST-130 assembly with only 151 contigs (85.4 Mb, N50 of 1.44 Mb), and a complementary assembly (haplotigs) with 458 contigs (65.9 Mb, N50 of 0.235 Mb, PRJNA650506). This new assembly improved gene predictions resulting in 228 more predicted complete genes than in the initial Illumina assembly (29,178 contigs, N50 of 5 kb). The alignment of the non-repetitive primary and haplotig contigs revealed and average of 5.22 SNP/kb, with 39.1% showing &lt;2 SNP/kb and 15.9% &gt;10 SNP/kb. This large divergent regions may represent introgressions of chromosome segments from more divergent Pst races in regions where a complete sexual cycle and recombination are possible. We hypothesize that some of the divergent regions in PST-130 may be related to the European “Warrior” race PST-DK0911 because this genome is more similar to PST-130 (3.18 SNP/kb) than to the older European race PST-104E (3.75 SNP/kb). Complete phasing of additional Pst genomes or sequencing individual nuclei will facilitate the tracing of the haploid genomes introduced by the new Pst races into local populations."
https://openalex.org/W3103660449,"Purpose To identify a gene signature for the prognosis of breast cancer using high-throughput analysis. Methods RNASeq, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), copy number variation (CNV) data and clinical follow-up information were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and randomly divided into training set or verification set. Genes related to breast cancer prognosis and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) with CNV or SNP were screened from training set, then integrated together for feature selection of identify robust biomarkers using RandomForest. Finally, a gene-related prognostic model was established and its performance was verified in TCGA test set, Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) validation set and breast cancer subtypes. Results A total of 2287 prognosis-related genes, 131 genes with amplified copy numbers, 724 gens with copy number deletions, and 280 genes with significant mutations screened from Genomic Variants were closely correlated with the development of breast cancer. A total of 120 candidate genes were obtained by integrating genes from Genomic Variants and those related to prognosis, then 6 characteristic genes (CD24, PRRG1, IQSEC3, MRGPRX, RCC2, and CASP8) were top-ranked by RandomForest for feature selection, noticeably, several of these have been previously reported to be associated with the progression of breast cancer. Cox regression analysis was performed to establish a 6-gene signature, which can stratify the risk of samples from training set, test set and external validation set, moreover, the five-year survival AUC of the model in the training set and validation set was both higher than 0.65. Thus, the 6-gene signature developed in the current study could serve as an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer patients. Conclusion This study constructed a 6-gene signature as a novel prognostic marker for predicting the survival of breast cancer patients, providing new diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for breast cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W3105707952,"Background The cerebral thrombin system is activated in the early stage after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Expression of thrombin leads to concentration dependent secondary neuronal damage and detrimental neurological outcome. In this study we aimed to investigate the impact of thrombin concentration and activity in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with ICH on clinical outcome. Methods Patients presenting with space-occupying lobar supratentorial hemorrhage requiring extra-ventricular drainage (EVD) were included in our study. The CSF levels of thrombin, its precursor prothrombin and the Thrombin-Antithrombin complex (TAT) were measured using enzyme linked immune sorbent assays (ELISA). The oxidative stress marker Superoxide dismutase (SOD) was assessed in CSF. Initial clot size and intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) volume was calculated based on by computerized tomography (CT) upon admission to our hospital. Demographic data, clinical status at admission and neurological outcome were assessed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 6-weeks and 6-month after ICH. Results Twenty-two consecutive patients (9 females, 11 males) with supratentorial hemorrhage were included in this study. CSF concentrations of prothrombin (p &lt; 0.005), thrombin (p = 0.005) and TAT (p = 0.046) were statistical significantly different in patients with ICH compared to non-hemorrhagic CSF samples. CSF concentrations of thrombin 24h after ICH correlated with the mRS index after 6 weeks (r 2 = 0.73; &lt; 0.005) and 6 months (r 2 = 0.63; &lt; 0.005) after discharge from hospital. Thrombin activity, measured via TAT as surrogate parameter of coagulation, likewise correlated with the mRS at 6 weeks (r 2 = 0.54; &lt; 0.01) and 6 months (r 2 = 0.66; &lt; 0.04). High thrombin concentrations coincide with higher SOD levels 24h after ICH (p = 0.01). Conclusion In this study we found that initial thrombin concentration and activity in CSF of ICH patients did not correlate with ICH and IVH volume but are associated with a poorer functional neurological outcome. These findings support mounting evidence of the role of thrombin as a contributor to secondary injury formation after ICH."
https://openalex.org/W3098703163,"Objective The gastrointestinal environment in which drug products need to disintegrate before the drug can dissolve and be absorbed has not been studied in detail due to limitations, especially invasiveness of existing techniques. Minimal in vivo data is available on undisturbed gastrointestinal motility to improve relevance of predictive dissolution models and in silico tools such as physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models. Recent advances in magnetic resonance imaging methods could provide novel data and insights that can be used as a reference to validate and, if necessary, optimize these models. The conventional method for measuring gastrointestinal motility is via a manometric technique involving intubation. Nevertheless, it is feasible to measure gastrointestinal motility with magnetic resonance imaging. The aim of this study was is to develop and validate a magnetic resonance imaging method using the most recent semi-automated analysis method against concomitant perfused manometry method. Material and methods Eighteen healthy fasted participants were recruited for this study. The participants were intubated with a water-perfused manometry catheter. Subsequently, stomach motility was assessed by cine-MRI acquired at intervals, of 3.5min sets, at coronal oblique planes through the abdomen and by simultaneous water perfused manometry, before and after administration of a standard bioavailability / bioequivalence 8 ounces (~240mL) drink of water. The magnetic resonance imaging motility images were analysed using Spatio-Temporal Motility analysis STMM techniques. The area under the curve of the gastric motility contractions was calculated for each set and compared between techniques. The study visit was then repeated one week later. Results Data from 15 participants was analysed. There was a good correlation between the MRI antral motility plots area under the curve and corresponding perfused manometry motility area under the curve (r = 0.860) during both antral contractions and quiescence. Conclusion Non-invasive dynamic magnetic resonance imaging of gastric antral motility coupled with recently developed, semi-automated magnetic resonance imaging data processing techniques correlated well with simultaneous, ‘gold standard’ water perfused manometry. This will be particularly helpful for research purposes related to oral absorption where the absorption of a drug is highly depending on the underlying gastrointestinal processes such as gastric emptying, gastrointestinal motility and availability of residual fluid volumes.

https://openalex.org/W3101233883,"Accurate methods for tracking individuals are crucial to the success of fisheries and aquaculture management. Management of migratory salmonid populations, which are important for the health of many economies, ecosystems, and indigenous cultures, is particularly dependent on data gathered from tagged fish. However, the physical tagging methods currently used have many challenges including cost, variable marker retention, and information limited to tagged individuals. Genetic tracking methods combat many of the problems associated with physical tags, but have their own challenges including high cost, potentially difficult marker design, and incompatibility of markers across species. Here we show the feasibility of a new genotyping method for parent-based tagging (PBT), where individuals are tracked through the inherent genetic relationships with their parents. We found that Rapture sequencing, a combination of restriction-site associated DNA and capture sequencing, provides sufficient data for parentage assignment. Additionally, the same capture bait set, which targets specific restriction-site associated DNA loci, can be used for both Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss and Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha . We input 248 single nucleotide polymorphisms from 1,121 samples to parentage assignment software and compared parent-offspring relationships of the spawning pairs recorded in a hatchery. Interestingly, our results suggest sperm contamination during hatchery spawning occurred in the production of 14% of offspring, further confirming the need for genetic tagging in accurately tracking individuals. PBT with Rapture successfully assigned progeny to parents with a 98.86% accuracy with sufficient genetic data. Cost for this pilot study was approximately $3 USD per sample. As costs vary based on the number of markers used and individuals sequenced, we expect that when implemented at a large-scale, per sample costs could be further decreased. We conclude that Rapture PBT provides a cost-effective and accurate alternative to the physical coded wire tags, and other genetic-based methods."
https://openalex.org/W3103186777,"This study deals with 3D laser investigation on the border between the human lymph node T-zone and germinal centre. Only a few T-cells specific for antigen selected B-cells are allowed to enter germinal centres. This selection process is guided by sinus structures, chemokine gradients and inherent motility of the lymphoid cells. We measured gaps and wall-like structures manually, using IMARIS, a 3D image software for analysis and interpretation of microscopy datasets. In this paper, we describe alpha-actin positive and semipermeable walls and wall-like structures that may hinder T-cells and other cell types from entering germinal centres. Some clearly defined holes or gaps probably regulate lymphoid traffic between T- and B-cell areas. In lymphadenitis, the morphology of this border structure is clearly defined. However, in case of malignant lymphoma, the wall-like structure is disrupted. This has been demonstrated exemplarily in case of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. We revealed significant differences of lengths of the wall-like structures in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma in comparison with wall-like structures in reactive tissue slices. The alterations of morphological structures lead to abnormal and less controlled T- and B-cell distributions probably preventing the immune defence against tumour cells and infectious agents by dysregulating immune homeostasis."

In addition to SAMS-1, three other SAMS paralogs have been identified in C . elegans . However, their roles in longevity regulation have never been explored. Here, we show that depletion of sams-5 , but not sams-3 or sams-4 , can extend lifespan in worms. However, the phenotypes and expression pattern of sams-5 are distinct from sams-1 , suggesting that these two SAMSs might regulate DR-induced longevity via different mechanisms. Through the genetic epistasis analysis, we have identified that sams-5 is required for DR-induced longevity in a pha-4/FOXA dependent manner."
https://openalex.org/W3011365539,"Introduction Infection with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is highly prevalent worldwide, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, where anaemia is also widespread. HIV infection is known to be associated with anaemia and various other haematologic alterations, but little data on correlation with immunological and virologic conditions in treatment-naïve patients and impact on mortality are available. Our study aims to investigate hematologic features in HIV-infected individuals in Malawi and Mozambique and assesses possible correlations with early morality. Material and methods We conducted a retrospective analysis of baseline data (general details, nutritional status, full blood count and HIV infection progress data) and 12 months follow-up status for HIV+ adult patients in 22 health facilities in Malawi (11 sites) and Mozambique (11 sites) run by DREAM program. Anagraphic details, anthropometric characteristics, full blood count, CD4+ count and Viral Load data were collected from electronical medical records (EMR) for all the HIV-positive, treatment-naïve patients starting care in the sites in the period January 2007 –December 2016. Follow-up status after one year since enrolment in care was also considered. All the data extracted from the EMR were included in a dataset and then analysed. Univariate and multivariate analysis were conducted through logistical regression to investigate associations, and survival analysis analysed in a Cox regression model. Results On the whole, 22.657 patients were included; severe and moderate anaemia were observed in 1.174 (8,2%) and 4.703 (21,9%) patients respectively. Gender, nutritional status, CD4+ count, and viral load (VL) were associated with anaemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Among 21.166 fully evaluable patients, 8.494 (40,1%) had at least one cytopenia. Any cytopenia was present in 1/3 of patients with normal nutritional status and less advanced HIV infection, and it wouldn’t be diagnosed in a basic HIV care setting. During the first year of treatment, 1.725 subjects (7,6% of the entire sample) died. Anaemia, lower Red blood cells and platelets counts correlated with mortality in the first year of care, independently by body mass index, haemoglobin, CD4+ count and VL. Conclusions Notwithstanding anaemia is known to be associated with HIV infection at diagnosis, full blood count is not routinely performed in many African countries. Our results emphasize that including the study of a broader set of parameters in the routine HIV care services in Sub-Saharan Africa would provide significant clinical information able to predict other alterations and poor outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W3036814862,"We create a network model to study the spread of an epidemic through physically proximate and accidental daily human contacts in a city, and simulate outcomes for two kinds of agents—poor and non-poor. Under non-intervention, peak caseload is maximised, but no differences are observed in infection rates across poor and non-poor. Introducing interventions to control spread, peak caseloads are reduced, but both cumulative infection rates and current infection rates are systematically higher for the poor than for non-poor, across all scenarios. Larger populations, higher fractions of poor, and longer durations of intervention are found to progressively worsen outcomes for the poor; and these are of particular concern for economically vulnerable populations in cities of the developing world. Addressing these challenges requires a deeper, more rigorous understanding of the relationships between structural poverty and epidemy, as well as effective utilization of extant community level infrastructure for primary care in developing cities. Finally, improving iniquitous outcomes for the poor creates better outcomes for the whole population, including the non-poor."

This study examines the reallocation of waking movement behaviors on adiposity, cardiovascular, and quality of life indicators among low-income, majority Hispanic preschool-aged youth (2–5 years) with overweight. Methods Participants wore an ActiGraph monitor (waist) and completed adiposity, cardiovascular, and health-related quality of life health assessments. Covariates included age, sex, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. The isotemporal substitution approach was employed to address study aims. Results Complete data were available for 131 preschoolers. For boys, reallocating 5 minutes of stationary time with light intensity, moderate to vigorous intensity, or total physical activity showed a relation with beneficial reductions in adiposity indicators; for girls, these relations were statistically null. For boys and girls, reallocating 5 minutes of stationary time [-2.2 (95% CI: -3.7, -0.7) mmHg], light intensity [-2.1 (95% CI: -3.7, -0.7) mmHg], or moderate intensity activity [-2.7 (95% CI: -5.0, -0.4) mmHg] to vigorous intensity activity was related to favorable systolic blood pressure. Reallocating 5 minutes of stationary time to moderate to vigorous intensity activity [0.6 (95% CI: -1.0, -0.1) mmHg] or total physical activity [-0.2 (95% CI: -0.3, -0.01) mmHg] was related to lowered systolic blood pressure. Reallocating 5 minutes of stationary time to moderate to vigorous intensity activity [0.6 (95% CI: -1.1, -0.02) bpm] was related to lowered resting heart rate. No significant results for quality of life were found. Conclusion Reallocation of time from stationary time to other movement behaviors is associated with several favorable adiposity and cardiovascular health outcomes among preschool children with overweight and obesity."
https://openalex.org/W3102071437,"Background Glaucoma represents the second main cause of irreversible loss of eyesight worldwide. Progression of the disease is due to changes around the optic nerve, eye structure and optic nerve environment. Focusing on primary congenital glaucoma, which is not completely understood, we report an evaluation of an untested mutation (c.182G&gt;A, p.Gly61Glu) within the CYP1B1 gene in the context of microglia, astrocytes and mesenchymal stem cells. We investigated the behaviours of these cells, which are needed to maintain eye homeostasis, in response to the CYP1B1 mutation. Methods and results CRISPR technology was used to edit normal CYP1B1 genes within normal astrocytes, microglia and stem cells in vitro . Increased metabolic activities were found in microglia and astrocytes 24 hours after CYP1B1 manipulation. However, these activities dropped by 40% after 72 hrs. In addition, the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP)/NADPH reducing equivalent process decreased by 50% on average after 72 hrs of manipulation. The cytokines measured in mutated microglia showed progressive activation leading to apoptosis, which was confirmed with annexin-V. The cytokines evaluated in mutant astrocytes were abnormal in comparison to those in the control. Conclusions The results suggest a progressive inflammation that was induced by mutations (p.Gly61Glu) on CYP1B1 . Furthermore, the mutations enhanced the microglia’s loss of activity. We are the first to show the direct impact of the mutation on microglia. This progressive inflammation might be responsible for primary congenital glaucoma complications, which could be avoided via an anti-inflammatory regimen. This finding also reveals that progressive inflammation affects recovery failure after surgeries to relieve glaucoma. Moreover, microglia are important for the survival of ganglion cells, along with the clearing of pathogens and inflammation. The reduction of their activities may jeopardise homeostasis within the optic nerve environment and complicate the protection of optic nerve components (such as retinal ganglion and glial cells)."
https://openalex.org/W3103544872,"Introduction The adult congenital heart disease population with repaired tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is subject to chronic volume and pressure loading leading to a 40% probability of right ventricular (RV) failure by the 3 rd decade of life. We sought to identify a non-invasive signature of adverse RV remodeling using peripheral blood microRNA (miRNA) profiling to better understand the mechanisms of RV failure. Methods Demographic, clinical data, and blood samples were collected from adults with repaired TOF (N = 20). RNA was isolated from the buffy coat of peripheral blood and whole genome miRNA expression was profiled using Agilent’s global miRNA microarray platform. Fold change, pathway analysis, and unbiased hierarchical clustering of miRNA expression was performed and correlated to RV size and function assessed by echocardiography performed at or near the time of blood collection. Results MiRNA expression was profiled in the following groups: 1. normal RV size (N = 4), 2. mild/moderate RV enlargement (N = 11) and 3. severe RV enlargement (N = 5). 267 miRNAs were downregulated, and 66 were upregulated across the three groups (fold change &gt;2.0, FDR corrected p&lt;0.05) as RV enlargement increased and systolic function decreased. qPCR validation of a subset of these miRNAs identified increasing expression of miRNA 28-3p, 433-3p, and 371b-3p to be associated with increasing RV size and decreasing RV systolic function. Unbiased hierarchical clustering of all patients based on miRNA expression demonstrates three distinct patient clusters that largely coincide with progressive RV enlargement. Pathway analysis of dysregulated miRNAs demonstrates up and downregulation of cell cycle pathways, extracellular matrix proteins and fatty acid synthesis. HIF 1α signaling was downregulated while p53 signaling was predicted to be upregulated. Conclusion Adults with TOF have a distinct miRNA profile with progressive RV enlargement and dysfunction implicating cell cycle dysregulation and upregulation in extracellular matrix and fatty acid metabolism. These data suggest peripheral blood miRNA can provide insight into the mechanisms of RV failure and can potentially be used for monitoring disease progression and to develop RV specific therapeutics to prevent RV failure in TOF."
https://openalex.org/W3101110095,"Background For patients initially diagnosed with metastatic Her2-positive breast cancer (MHBC), we intended to construct a nomogram with risk stratification to predict prognosis and to explore the role of local surgery. Methods We retrieved data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Kaplan–Meier (KM) method and log-rank test were used for the selection of significant variables. Cox regression analysis and Fine-Gray test were utilized to confirm independent prognostic factors of overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS). A nomogram predicting 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year OS was developed and validated. Patients were stratified based on the optimal cut-off values of total personal score. KM method and log-rank test were used to estimate OS prognosis and benefit from local surgery and chemotherapy. Results There were 1680 and 717 patients in the training and validation cohort. Age, race, marriage, T stage, estrogen receptor (ER) status, visceral metastasis (bone, brain, liver and lung) were identified as independent prognostic factors for OS and BCSS, while histology was also corelated with OS. C-indexes in the training and validation cohort were 0.70 and 0.68, respectively. Calibration plots indicated precise predictive ability. The total population was divided into low- (&lt;141 points), intermediate- (142–208 points), and high-risk (&gt;208 points) prognostic groups. Local surgery and chemotherapy brought various degrees of survival benefit for patients with diverse-risk prognosis. Conclusions We constructed a model with accurate prediction and discrimination. It would provide a reference for clinicians' decision-making. Surgery on the primary lesion was recommended for patients with good physical performance status, while further study on optimal surgical opportunity was needed."
https://openalex.org/W3103629334,"DNA methylation and histone tail modifications are interrelated mechanisms involved in a wide range of biological processes, and disruption of this crosstalk is linked to diseases such as acute myeloid leukemia. In addition, DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) activity is modulated by several regulatory proteins, including p53 and thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG). However, the relative role of histone tails and regulatory proteins in the simultaneous coordination of DNMT3A activity remains obscure. We observed that DNMT3A binds H3 tails and p53 or TDG at distinct allosteric sites to form DNMT3A–H3 tail-p53 or –TDG multiprotein complexes. Functional characterization of DNMT3A–H3 tail-p53 or –TDG complexes on human-derived synthetic histone H3 tails, mononucleosomes, or polynucleosomes shows p53 and TDG play dominant roles in the modulation of DNMT3A activity. Intriguingly, this dominance occurs even when DNMT3A is actively methylating nucleosome substrates. The activity of histone modifiers is influenced by their ability to sense modifications on histone tails within the same nucleosome or histone tails on neighboring nucleosomes. In contrast, we show here that DNMT3A acts on DNA within a single nucleosome, on nucleosomal DNA within adjacent nucleosomes, and DNA not associated with the DNMT3A–nucleosome complex. Our findings have direct bearing on how the histone code drives changes in DNA methylation and highlight the complex interplay between histone tails, epigenetic enzymes, and modulators of enzymatic activity.

Carried out by DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A), de novo 5-methylcytosine patterning of mammalian DNA is a major epigenetic modification frequently associated with transcriptional repression (1Maunakea A.K.

The plethora of posttranslational modifications to specific residues within the amino-terminal tails of core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) forms another epigenetic process leading to the activation or repression of genes (3Berger S.L. The complex language of chromatin regulation during transcription.Nature. 2007; 447: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (1986) Google Scholar). Mammalian transcriptional regulation relies on the extensive crosstalk between histone modifications and DNA methylation, and changes in this interplay are a major contributor to human cancers. For example, genome-wide epigenetic profiling reveals that genomic loci with H3K36me2/3, H3K9me3, and H3K4me0 correlate with enrichment of de novo DNA methylation (4Weinberg D.N. Papillon-Cavanagh S.

Intragenic DNA methylation alters chromatin structure and elongation efficiency in mammalian cells.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 1068-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Furthermore, alterations to the interplay between DNA methylation and modifications to H3K4/K27 contribute to the altered expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (CDKN2B or p15) gene observed in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (9Paul T.A. Bies J. Small D. Wolff L. Signatures of polycomb repression and reduced H3K4 trimethylation are associated with p15INK4b DNA methylation in AML.Blood. 2010; 115: 3098-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms that underpin these correlations between changes in histone modifications and DNA methylation remain obscure, as is the contribution of regulatory proteins in this context. We envision two plausible situations (Fig. 1B), starting with the physical recruitment of DNMT3A (Fig. 1B, I.) or DNMT3A in complex with distinct regulatory proteins (Fig. 1B, II. and V.), through its well-known interactions with histone tails. In this model, DNMT3A acts as a reader of histone marks (Fig. 1B, I., II., and V.) with histone tails modulating enzymatic activity (Fig. 1B, I., II., and V.) or alternatively with histone tails primarily recruiting DNMT3A and regulatory proteins playing a dominant role in the modulation of enzymatic activity (Fig. 1B, II. and V.). An additional scenario derives not from a physical association of DNMT3A and particular histone marks but rather the regulatory proteins associated with DNMT3A serving as a reader of histone marks (Fig. 1B, VI.), and the enzymatic activity of DNMT3A modulated by regulatory proteins or a combination of regulatory protein–histone tail interactions (Fig. 1B, VI.). Clearly, these mechanisms are not mutually distinctive. The crystal structure of a DNMT3A–DNA Methyltransferase 3 Like (DNMT3L) heterotetramer in complex with a histone H3 peptide (residues 1–21) reveals that DNMT3A binds histone tails via its conserved ATRX-DNMT3-DNMT3L (ADD) domain while simultaneously accommodating DNMT3L at the tetramer interface (Fig. 1A) (10Guo X.

Structural insight into autoinhibition and histone H3-induced activation of DNMT3A.Nature. 2015; 517: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). To date, insights on the combinatorial effect of regulatory proteins and histone H3 tails in the modulation of DNMT3A activity have focused solely on DNMT3L, which is complicated by the fact that both DNMT3A and DNMT3L bind H3 tails via the ADD domain (Fig. 1B, V. and VI.)

The interactions between DNMT3A and nucleosomes and regulatory proteins like DNMT3L is further modulated by other regulatory proteins such as tumor suppressor p53 (p53) or thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG), which involve DNMT3A surface regions that are shared with DNMT3L (13Sandoval J.E.

While there is no evidence for the direct interactions of p53 or TDG with histone tails, their genomic locations are associated with specific histone modifications and indirectly mediating changes to the modifications of histone tails (15Mungamuri S.K.

Thus, these proteins clearly contribute to the modulation of epigenetic mechanisms. Although the related interactions between DNMT3A and nucleosomes remain largely uncharacterized, several studies have investigated this relationship in histone modifying enzymes. For example, the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 4 associates with histone H3 tails within a single nucleosome (intranucleosomal interactions), whereas heterochromatin protein 1α binds individual histone H3 tails in adjacent nucleosomes (internucleosomal interactions) (17Feng Y. Wang J. Asher S. Hoang L. Guardiani C. Ivanov I. Zheng Y.G. Histone H4 acetylation differentially modulates arginine methylation by an in cis mechanism.J. Biol.

The relationship between DNMT3A and histone H3 tails is inherently intricate as DNMT3A plays a dual role as a reader of histone H3 tails and a writer on nucleosomal DNA (10Guo X. Wang L. Li J.

Furthermore, when the possible combinations of biologically significant complexes involving regulatory proteins are considered (Fig. 1B), the complexity of the dynamics associated with epigenetic control is evident. Our current understanding of the allosteric modulation of DNMT3A activity is limited to studies focusing on the individual roles of histone H3 tails, regulatory proteins, or the interplay between DNMT3L and histone H3 tails (7Ge Y.-Z.

Our interest here is to explore the relative role (dominant or passive) of histone H3 tails and regulatory proteins in the modulation of DNMT3A activity to better understand the potential crosstalk between histone H3 tails and regulatory proteins and how this translates into meaningful biological outcomes. Our approaches rely on human-derived synthetic histone H3 tails, mononucleosomes or polynucleosomes, the regulatory proteins p53 and TDG, and a modified pulse–chase assay along with florescence anisotropy assays. Our work provides novel insights into the dynamic interplay between distinct epigenetic mechanisms as well as a better understanding of the regulation of enzyme activity in protein complexes consisting of modulators that bind distinct allosteric sites. DNMT3A simultaneously accommodates DNMT3L and histone H3 tails through interactions at distinct surfaces (Fig. 1A) (10Guo X. Wang L. Li J. Ding Z. Xiao J. Yin X. He S. Shi P. Dong L. Li G. Tian C. Wang J. Cong Y. Xu Y. Structural insight into autoinhibition and histone H3-induced activation of DNMT3A.Nature. 2015; 517: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In conjunction with a distinct co-crystal structure of DNMT3L bound to H3K4me0 peptide (PDB 2PVC) (11Ooi S.K.T. Qiu C. Bernstein E. Li K. Jia D. Yang Z. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Lin S.-P.

However, this model does not entirely explain the relationship between DNMT3L and histone H3 tails in the simultaneous regulation of DNMT3A activity in DNMT3A–DNMT3L–H3 complexes as the same activation is observed in the absence of DNMT3L (19Li B.-Z. Huang Z. Cui Q.-Y. Song X.-H. Du L. Jeltsch A. Chen P. Li G. Li E. Xu G.-L. Histone tails regulate DNA methylation by allosterically activating de novo methyltransferase.Cell Res. 2011; 21: 1172-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, this model leaves unanswered whether histone tails primarily recruit DNMT3A, while DNMT3L plays a dominant role in the modulation of DNMT3A activity (Fig. 1B, V.), or DNMT3L primarily recruits DNMT3A, and the activity of DNMT3A is modulated by DNMT3L or a combination of DNMT3L–histone H3 peptide interactions (Fig. 1B, VI.). To elucidate the role of histone H3 tails and regulatory proteins in the coordination of DNMT3A activity, we assessed the dynamics and functional consequences of complexes involving DNMT3A, histone H3 peptides (H3K4me0 and H3K4me3) and two previously characterized regulatory proteins of DNMT3A (p53 or TDG) whose cellular functions have been associated with the presence of specific histone modifications (13Sandoval J.E.

We previously used fluorescence anisotropy to characterize the interactions between the catalytic domain of DNMT3A and p53 on a fluorophore-labeled oligonucleotide (5′ 6-FAM-labeled duplex DNA [GCbox30]) containing a single recognition site for DNMT3A (14Sandoval J.E.

Importantly, the modulation of DNMT3A activity on DNA by p53 and TDG does not occur with other DNA cytosine methyltransferases, which argues against these effects deriving from competition by these regulatory proteins resulting from DNA binding (13Sandoval J.E. Reich N.O. The R882H substitution in the human de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A disrupts allosteric regulation by the tumor supressor p53.J. Biol.

Li G. Tian C. Wang J. Cong Y. Xu Y. Structural insight into autoinhibition and histone H3-induced activation of DNMT3A.Nature. 2015; 517: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), increasing concentrations of unlabeled H3K4me0 peptide to a fixed concentration of DNA-bound DNMT3A (Fig. 2A ) increases the fluorescence anisotropy signal, reflecting the formation of DNA-bound DNMT3A–H3K4me0 complexes. Similarly, preformed DNMT3A–p53 (Fig. 2A ) or DNMT3A–TDG (Fig. 2A ) complexes on DNA displayed an increase to the initial anisotropy signal with a corresponding increase in H3K4me0 peptide concentration, suggesting the formation of higher order DNMT3A heterotetramers in complex with H3K4me0 peptide on DNA. Given that DNA-bound DNMT3A heterotetramers with p53 (Fig. 2A ) or TDG (Fig. 2A ) can accommodate H3K4me0 peptide, we sought to assess the relative role of H3K4 and regulatory proteins (p53 or TDG) in the simultaneous modulation of DNMT3A enzymatic activity. As previously observed (19Li B.-Z. Huang Z. Cui Q.-Y. Song X.-H. Du L. Jeltsch A. Chen P. Li G. Li E. Xu G.-L. Histone tails regulate DNA methylation by allosterically activating de novo methyltransferase.Cell Res. 2011; 21: 1172-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), preincubation of DNMT3A with H3K4me0 peptide results in activation of enzymatic activity (Fig. 2B ), whereas preincubation of DNMT3A with H3K4me3 peptide (Fig. 2A ) results in comparable levels of activity as reactions without H3 peptides (Fig. 2B ), although DNMT3A binds both peptides in vitro (10Guo X.

Structural insight into autoinhibition and histone H3-induced activation of DNMT3A.Nature. 2015; 517: 640-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Additionally, we observed a roughly 50% decrease in DNMT3A activity in control reactions consisting of DNMT3A–p53 (Fig. 2B ) or DNMT3A–TDG (Fig. 2B ) preincubations as previously reported (13Sandoval J.E. Reich N.O. The R882H substitution in the human de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A disrupts allosteric regulation by the tumor supressor p53.J. Biol.

Association of Dnmt3a and thymine DNA glycosylase links DNA methylation with base-excision repair.Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 390-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In equilibrium reactions where DNMT3A and H3K4me0 peptide were preincubated with individual regulatory proteins, we observed that inhibition of DNMT3A activity by p53 (Fig. 2B ) or TDG (Fig. 2B ) is dominant over H3K4me0 peptide activation of DNMT3A (Fig. 2A ). Under similar experimental conditions, the presence of H3K4me3 peptide does not disrupt modulation of DNMT3A methylation activity by p53 (Fig. 2B ) or TDG (Fig. 2B ). In fact, preincubation of DNMT3A with p53 or TDG in the presence of H3K4me0 or H3K4me3 peptides led to comparable levels of DNMT3A-dependent methylation as reactions consisting of DNMT3A with only p53 (Fig. 2B ) or TDG (Fig. 2B ). To further challenge the dominant modulatory effect of p53 or TDG over H3K4me0 or H3K4me0 peptides on DNMT3A observed, we then evaluated the functional outcome of adding equimolar concentrations of individual regulatory proteins (ratio of 1:1 regulatory protein to 150 nM tetramer DNMT3A) to DNMT3A–H3K4me0 or DNMT3A–H3K4me3 complexes that are actively methylating DNA. Like reactions at equilibrium (Fig. 2B), the addition of p53 (Fig. 2C ) or TDG (Fig. 2D ) to actively methylating DNMT3A–H3K4me0 complexes disrupted H3K4me0 peptide-mediated stimulation of DNMT3A activity (Fig. 2, C–D ). Furthermore, actively catalyzing DNMT3A–H3K4me3 peptide complexes (Fig. 2, E–F ) are responsive to the addition of p53 (Fig. 2E ) or TDG (Fig. 2F ). While H3K4me0 is associated with gene silencing, trimethylated histone H3K4 (H3K4me3) sites are associated with active gene promoters (21Fischle W. Talk is cheap--cross-talk in establishment, maintenance, and readout of chromatin modifications.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 3375-3382Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These results do not derive from direct p53 or TDG competition with DNMT3A binding to the DNA (Fig. S6) (13Sandoval J.E. Reich N.O. The R882H substitution in the human de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A disrupts allosteric regulation by the tumor supressor p53.J. Biol.

Our results indicate that in DNMT3A–H3 tail-regulatory protein complexes (Fig. 2A), regulatory proteins play a dominant role in the simultaneous coordination of DNMT3A activity despite the methylation state H3K4 (Fig. 2, B–F). Elucidating the spatial relationship between epigenetic enzymes and their substrates (intranucleosomal or internucleosomal action, Fig. 3A) is essential to truly understand nucleosome-protein interactions and the structural basis of epigenetic gene regulation. Several studies have characterized this relationship in the context of histone-modifying enzymes (17Feng Y. Wang J. Asher S. Hoang L. Guardiani C. Ivanov I. Zheng Y.G. Histone H4 acetylation differentially modulates arginine methylation by an in cis mechanism.J. Biol.

Chem. 2014; 289: 6850-6861Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, the molecular arrangement between DNMT3A and nucleosome substrates remains less well characterized (Fig. 3A). The primary focus has been on whether the enzyme methylates linker DNA or the DNA wrapped to form the nucleosome, which at this point remains unclear. To provide insights into the orientation of DNMT3A relative to nucleosome substrates, we assessed the accessibility of exogenous (non-nucleosomal substrate) H3K4me0 peptide or DNA to DNMT3A-mononucleosome complexes (Fig. 3, B–F). We initially assessed whether the N-terminus of DNMT3A contributes to DNMT3A–mononucleosome interactions. Consistent with previous findings, the catalytic domain of DNMT3A (Δ1–611) (Fig. S1, ) and the prokaryotic CpG DNA methyltransferase M. SssI (Fig. S1, ) displayed reduced activity on unmodified mononucleosomal substrates relative to full-length DNMT3A (Fig. S1, ) (12Zhang Y. Jurkowska R. Soeroes S. Rajavelu A. Dhayalan A. Bock I. Rathert P. Brandt O. Reinhardt R. Fischle W. Jeltsch A. Chromatin methylation activity of Dnmt3a and Dnmt3a/3L is guided by interaction of the ADD domain with the histone H3 tail.Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; 38: 4246-4253Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 22Gowher H. Stockdale C.J. Goyal R. Ferreira H. Owen-Hughes T. Jeltsch A. De novo methylation of nucleosomal DNA by the mammalian Dnmt1 and Dnmt3A DNA methyltransferases.Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9899-9904Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We then assessed the effect of increasing concentrations of H3K4me0 peptide on the activity of DNMT3A using mononucleosomes as a substrate (Fig. 3B). Unlike reactions consisting of free DNA (Fig. 2), an increase in the concentration of H3K4me0 peptide did not alter the enzymatic activity of DNMT3A on mononucleosomal DNA (Fig. 3B). Thus, the association of DNMT3A to intrinsic (mononucleosomal) H3 tails appears to perturb the activation of DNMT3A by H3K4me0 peptide. To additionally challenge this notion, we then monitored changes in the fluorescence anisotropy of FAM-labeled H3K4me0 (1Maunakea A.K. Nagarajan R.P. Bilenky M. Ballinger T.J. D’Souza C. Fouse S.D.

https://openalex.org/W3099071423,"Body size is commonly associated with biological features such as reproductive capacity, competition, and resource acquisition. Many studies have tried to understand how these isolated factors can affect the body pattern of individuals. However, little is known about how interactions among species in multitrophic communities determine the body shape of individuals exploiting the same resource. Here, we evaluate the effect of fruit infestation, parasitism rate, and seed biomass on size, allometric and asymmetric patterns of morphological structures of insects that exploit the same resource. To test it, we measured 750 individuals associated with the plant Senegalia tenuifolia (Fabaceae), previously collected over three consecutive years. Negative allometry was maintained for all species, suggesting that with increasing body size the body structure did not grow proportionally. Despite this, some variations in allometric slopes suggest that interactions in a multitrophic food web can shape the development of these species. Also, we observed a higher confidence interval at higher categories of infestation and parasitism rate, suggesting a great variability in the allometric scaling. We did not observe fluctuating asymmetry for any category or species, but we found some changes in morphological structures, depending on the variables tested. These findings show that both allometry and morphological trait measurements are the most indicated in studies focused on interactions and morphometry. Finally, we show that, except for the fluctuating asymmetry, each species and morphological structure respond differently to interactions, even if the individuals play the same functional role within the food web."
https://openalex.org/W3103382093,"Triuret (carbonyldiurea) is an impurity found in industrial urea fertilizer (<0.1% w/w) that is applied, worldwide, around 300 million pounds each year on agricultural lands. In addition to anthropogenic sources, endogenous triuret has been identified in amoeba and human urine, the latter being diagnostic for hypokalemia. The present study is the first to describe the metabolic breakdown of triuret, which funnels into biuret metabolism. We identified the gene responsible for triuret decomposition (trtA) in bacterial genomes, clustered with biuH, which encodes biuret hydrolase and has close protein sequence homology. TrtA is a member of the isochorismatase-like hydrolase (IHL) protein family, similarly to BiuH, and has a catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of 6 x 105 M-1s-1, a KM for triuret of 20 μM, and exquisite substrate specificity. Indeed, TrtA has four orders of magnitude less activity with biuret. Crystal structures of TrtA in apo and holo form were solved and compared with the BiuH structure. The high substrate selectivity was found to be conveyed by second shell residues around each active site. Mutagenesis of residues conserved in TrtA to the alternate consensus found in BiuHs revealed residues critical to triuret hydrolase activity but no single mutant evolved more biuret activity, and likely a combination of mutations is required to interconvert between TrtA, BiuH functions. TrtA-mediated triuret metabolism is relatively rare in recorded genomes (1-2%), but is largely found in plant-associated, nodulating, and endophytic bacteria. This study suggests functions for triuret hydrolase in certain eukaryotic intermediary processes and prokaryotic intermediary or biodegradative metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W3105289772,"Background An estimated 10% of male adults have split or dribbled stream leading to poor hygiene, embarrassment, and inconvenience. There is no current metric that measures male stream deviation. Objective To develop a novel method to measure spray in normal and abnormal anatomical conformations. Design, setting, and participants We developed a novel platform to reliably describe spray. We used cadaveric tissues and 3D Printed models to study the impact of meatal shape on the urinary stream. Cadaveric penile tissue and 3D printed models were affixed to a fluid pump and used to simulate micturition. Dye captured on fabric allowed for spray detection. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis Spray pattern area, deviation from normal location, and flowrates were recorded. Computational fluid dynamic models were created to study fluid vorticity. Results and limitations Obstructions at the penile tip worsened spray dynamics and reduced flow. Ventral meatotomy improved flowrate (p&lt;0.05) and reduced spray (p&lt;0.05) compared to tips obstructed ventrally, dorsally or in the fossa navicularis. 3D models do not fully reproduce parameters of their parent cadaver material. The average flowrate from 3D model was 10ml/sec less than that of the penis from which it was derived (p = 0.03). Nonetheless, as in cadavers, increasing obstruction in 3D models leads to the same pattern of reduced flowrate and worse spray. Dynamic modeling revealed increasing distal obstruction was correlated to higher relative vorticity observed at the urethral tip. Conclusions We developed a robust method to measure urine spray in a research setting. Dynamic 3D printed models hold promise as a methodology to study common pathologies in the urethra and corrective surgeries on the urine stream that would not be feasible in patients. These novel methods require further validation, but offer promise as a research and clinical tool."

More specifically, we examine the existence of significant differences in the degree to which family members and professionals trust each other. We also propose that their joint participation in collaborative teams (VI) will improve trust (VD). Specifically, our teams (experimental condition) designed and implemented collaborative projects with the participation of professionals and family members. Participants in the control condition did not participate in the collaborative projects. Our results confirmed that family members trust professionals more than professionals trust family members. Their joint participation in collaborative projects improved professionals’ trust in family members over time, compared to the control condition. The effect of collaborative projects was not significant for family members’ trust in professionals."
https://openalex.org/W3104549142,"While many languages are in danger of extinction worldwide, multilingualism is being adopted for communication among different language groups, and is playing a unique role in preserving language and cultural diversities. How multilingualism is developed and maintained therefore becomes an important interdisciplinary research subject for understanding complex social changes of modern-day societies. In this paper, a mixed population of multilingual speakers and bilingual speakers in particular is considered, with multilingual defined broadly as zero, limited, or full uses of multiple languages or dialects, and an evolutionary dynamic model for its development and evolution is proposed. The model consists of two different parts, formulated as two different evolutionary games, respectively. The first part accounts for the selection of languages based on the competition for population and social or economic preferences. The second part relates to circumstances when the selection of languages is altered, for better or worse, by forces other than competition such as public policies, education, or family influences. By combining competition with intervention, the paper shows how multilingualism may evolve under these two different sources of influences. It shows in particular that by choosing appropriate interventional strategies, the stable co-existence of languages, especially in multilingual forms, is possible, and extinction can be prevented. This is in contrast with major predictions from previous studies that the co-existence of languages is unstable in general, and one language will eventually dominate while all others will become extinct."
